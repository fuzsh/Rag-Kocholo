        "text": "Amazon Commissions Earned\n\nThe 1981 film “Reds“ will officially be getting a “40th Anniversary Edition“ Blu-ray Disc release on November 30th via Paramount Home Entertainment. The film, directed by, co-written by, and starring Warren Beatty, co-starred Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Edward Herrmann, Gene Hackman, Paul Sorvino, and Maureen Stapleton. The movie, in 1982, was nominated for twelve Academy Awards (including “Best Picture”), and it won a total of 3 Oscars (including “Best Director”).\n\nThis has received a new 4K restoration, from the original negative, supervised by director Warren Beatty which was also approved by the cinematographer, as detailed below.\n\n” … REDS, newly restored under Beatty’s supervision. The film was restored and remastered from the original negative in 4K with High Dynamic Range using a vintage print from the Paramount archives as a reference, which was approved by Academy Award®-winning* cinematographer Vittorio Storaro. “\n\nAs you’ll notice, there’s some mention of 4K and HDR (high dynamic range) there, which means that you can someday expect a 4K UHD Blu-ray — given they [Paramount] have gone to this much effort in the restoration process. The tech specs for the release have not yet been fully detailed, but you can expect a 1080p HD video presentation and a lossless sound mix. Stay tuned for an update on that. You can now find the Blu-ray available for preorder over at Amazon. The release will come with a digital code (copy) of the film. I’d speculate ahead of time that the digital version included might even be in 4K with HDR — as mentioned is available. Bonus materials set to be included with the release are listed below.\n\nThe new Blu-ray set boasts over an hour of legacy bonus content.

The story of a radical American journalist embroiled in the Bolshevik revolution mesmerized critics and audiences alike and remains as relevant today as when it was originally released on December 25, 1981.\n\nOn November 30, 2021, Paramount Home Entertainment will debut a new two-disc Blu-ray set of REDS, newly restored under Beatty’s supervision. The film was restored and remastered from the original negative in 4K with High Dynamic Range using a vintage print from the Paramount archives as a reference, which was approved by Academy Award®-winning* cinematographer Vittorio Storaro.\n\nPunctuated by interviews with real-life activists and witnesses to the revolution, REDS became an instant classic, transcending time with its eternal tale of human passion, conviction, and frailty. In addition to Beatty, the film boasts an outstanding cast including Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Edward Herrmann, Gene Hackman, Paul Sorvino, and Maureen Stapleton, whose performance won her an Academy Award® for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.\n\nThe engrossing depiction of the love story between activists John Reed (Beatty) and Louise Bryant (Keaton) set against the outbreak of World War I and the rise of communism in Russia, REDS garnered 12 Academy Award® nominations and won three**, including Best Director for Beatty, who also took home every other major directorial award of the season. The Oscar®-nominated screenplay was written by Beatty and Trevor Griffiths.\n\nThe new Blu-ray set boasts over an hour of legacy bonus content, as well as access to a Digital copy of the film.
