        "text": "Paul Celan was born on 23 November 1920 as Paul Antschel, the sole son of German-speaking Jewish parents in the then Romanian city of Czernowitz. After completing school in 1938, he began studying medicine in Tours, France, but returned to Romania a year later to complete a degree in Romance studies. In 1942, Celan’s parents were deported to a labour camp. In the autumn of that year, his father died of typhoid, and his mother was shot. Between 1942 and 1944, Celan was made to do forced labour in several Romanian camps. From 1945 to 1947 he worked as an editor and translator in Bucharest and began to publish his first poems. In 1948, he moved to Paris, where he lived until his death. That same year, he met Ingeborg Bachmann, and in 1951, Celan met the artist Gisèle de...\n\nNelly Sachs was born into a liberal Jewish family of entrepreneurs on December 10, 1891 in Berlin. In 1940, after the death of her father, she went into exile in Sweden with her mother and became a Swedish citizen in 1953. She was the first woman to receive the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1965 and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1966 together with Samuel Agnon. Nelly Sachs died in Stockholm on May 12, 1970, the day of Paul Celan’s funeral."
