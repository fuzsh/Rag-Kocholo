        "text": "Nelly Sachs was born on the 10th December 1891 in Schoneberg, an affluent area of Berlin, to a wealthy Jewish German family.\n\nShe grew up in a very protective family.\n\nMental health issues affected her throughout her life in the form of hallucinations, paranoia, mutism and various other breakdowns.\n\nShe spent a number of years in mental institutions, but always found a way to continue to write.\n\nNelly 1910\n\nAs a young girl she became fascinated with the works of the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, Selma Lagerlof and began a correspondence with her.\n\nSachs also became good friends with Hilde Domin (Palm), a German poet who emigrated to Italy in 1932 with her husband, then finally, to the Dominican Republic in 1940, to avoid the ‘Nazi menace’.\n\nSachs fled Nazi Germany with the help of Lagerlof, on the last flight to Sweden in 1940.\n\nShe took her aged mother with her, but sadly, both her mother and Lagerlof died soon after.\n\nNelly became a Swedish citizen in 1952.\n\nHer poetry is described as being lyrical and mystical.\n\nHer early work was influenced by German Romanticism, Christian imagery and an early, unhappy relationship with a non-Jewish man.\n\nHe was later killed in a concentration camp.\n\nWhen Sach’s learnt of his death, her poetry evolved in a way that\n\n“bound up his fate with that of her people and wrote many love lyrics ending not only in the beloved’s death, but in the catastrophe of the Holocaust. Sachs herself mourns no longer as a jilted lover but as a personification of the Jewish people in their vexed relationship to history and God.\n\nSachs’ fusion of grief with subtly romantic elements…allowed her to develop\n\nself-consciously from a German to a Jewish writer, with a corresponding change in her language: still flowery and conventional in some of her first poetry on the Holocaust, it becomes ever more compressed and surreal.”\n\n(wikipedia)\n\nShe was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1966 along with Shmuel Yosef Agnon.\n\nThe Academy stated that\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1966 was divided equally between Shmuel Yosef Agnon\n\n“for his profoundly characteristic narrative art with motifs from the life of the Jewish people” and Nelly Sachs “for her outstanding lyrical and dramatic writing, which interprets Israel’s destiny with touching strength”.\n\nSachs observed that Agnon represented Israel whereas “I represent the tragedy of the Jewish people”.’\n\n(wikipedia)\n\nHer later poetry explored an eclectic religious transcendentalism.\n\nSin, vulnerability, suffering, redemption, rebirth, grace and peace were some of her recurring themes.\n\nHer poems regularly referenced earlier pieces (metafiction again!) which caused some commentators to say that she only ever wrote one poem, with numerous components.\n\nI certainly struggle to understand all the layers of imagery in the few poems I’ve read so far.\n\nPerhaps Sachs needs to be read in her entirety, in chronological order?\n\nSachs died of cancer on the 12th May 1970 in Sweden.\n\nYou’ve Lost Your Name\n\nYou’ve lost your name\n\nbut the world rushes up\n\nand offers you a grand choice\n\nYou shake your head\n\nyet your beloved\n\nonce found you the needle in the haystack\n\nHark: he’s calling you now\n\nTranslation Catherine @Beauty for Ashes\n\nWhoever Comes from the Earth\n\nWhoever\n\ncomes from the Earth\n\nreaching for the moon\n\nor\n\nother heavenly mineral flower –\n\nwill soar high\n\nwounded by blasts\n\nof memory\n\nshot from the explosive burst of yearning\n\nfor\n\nout of Earth’s painted night\n\nhis winged prayers arise\n\nout of daily destructions\n\nseeking the inner pathways of the eyes. Craters and arid seas\n\nfilled with tears\n\ntravelling through starry stations\n\nescaping from dust and ashes. Everywhere the Earth\n\nis building its colonies of homesickness.\n\nNot to land\n\non the oceans of addicted blood\n\nonly to sway\n\nin the luminous music of ebb and flood\n\nonly to sway\n\nto the rhythm of the unscathed\n\nmark of eternity:\n\nlife – death –\n\nTranslation by Catherine @Beauty for Ashes\n\nO The Chimneys\n\nJob 19:26\n\n“And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God”\n\nO the chimneys\n\non the carefully planned dwellings of death\n\nWhen Israel’s body rose dissolved in smoke\n\nthrough the air –\n\nTo be welcomed by a chimney sweep star\n\nTurned black\n\nOr was it a ray of the sun?\n\nO the chimneys!\n\nPaths of freedom for the dust of Jeremiah and Job –\n\nWho dreamed you up and built stone upon stone\n\nThe path of smoke for their flight?\n\nO dwellings of death\n\nSet out so enticingly\n\nFor the host of the house, who used to be the guest –\n\nO you fingers\n\nLaying the stone of the threshold\n\nLike a knife between life and death –\n\nO you chimneys\n\nO you fingers\n\nAnd Israel’s body dissolves in smoke through the air!\n\nTranslation by Catherine @Beauty for Ashes\n\nNelly Sachs by Helga Tiemann, 1968\n\nAlways\n\nAlways\n\nwhere children die\n\nthe quietest things become homeless.\n\nSunsets wrapped in a mantle of pain\n\nwhere the dark soul of the blackbird\n\nlaments the approach of the night –\n\nsoft winds wafting\n\nover trembling grasses\n\ndousing the ruins of light\n\nand sowing death –\n\nAlways\n\nwhere children die\n\nthe firefaces of the night\n\nburn up in their lonely secret –\n\nand who knows of the signposts\n\ndeath sends out:\n\nscent of the tree of life,\n\ncockcrow shortening the day\n\nmagic clock bewitched into the nurseries\n\nby the grey horror of autumn –\n\nwaters rippling on the shores of dark\n\nthe rushing, tugging sleep of time –\n\nAlways\n\nwhere children die\n\nthe mirrors of their doll’s houses\n\nare hung with a breath,\n\nseeing no more the dance of the\n\nfinger puppets\n\ndressed in satin of children’s blood;\n\na dance that stands still\n\nlike a far-off moonworld\n\nin a telescope\n\nAlways\n\nwhere children die\n\nstone and star\n\nand so many dreams become homeless.\n\nTranslation by Catherine @Beauty for Ashes\n\nBewitched indeed!\n\nBewildered as well.\n\nPoetry appreciation doesn’t come naturally to me.\n\nIt’s a learned process.\n\nI feel like she’s writing way above my level to understand.\n\nI feel her poems rather then understand them.\n\nThe Nobel Prize states\n\nThe fate of the Jewish people casts a dark shadow over the 20th century. It is also the basis for Nelly Sachs’ literary works. She borrows subjects for her poetry from the Jewish beliefs and mysticism, but her authorship is also strongly coloured by Nazi persecution of the Jews, with the horrors of the death camps as its ultimate expression. Nelly Sachs’ poetry combines echoes from the poetry of ancient religious texts with modernist language.\n\nThe Nelly Sachs website has a number of her poems in German and English which I used as a starting point.\n\nI also found a wonderful blog hosted by Catherine @Beauty for Ashes.\n\nShe is gradually translating Sach’s poems into English and welcomes commentary and discussion about interpretation.\n\nCatherine kindly gave me permission to use four of her translations above.\n\nPlease take the time to visit her page (she has the original poem plus her translation on each post).\n\nIt is truly an extraordinary thing she is doing to bring Sach’s work to a wider audience.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPublished by This Reading Life\n\nView all posts by This Reading Life"
