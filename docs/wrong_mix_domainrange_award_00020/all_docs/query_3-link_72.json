        "text": "Attend the book launch of Joshua Weiner's translation of Nelly Sachs' Flight & Metamorphosis.\n\nRegister for the event.\n\nFrom the publisher:\n\nThis central collection by the poet, dramatist, and Nobel laureate Nelly Sachs—newly translated from the German by Joshua Weiner (with Linda B. Parshall)—reveals the visionary poet’s remarkable power of creation and transformation.\n\nSo far out, in the open,\n\ncushioned in sleep.\n\nIn flight from the land\n\nwith love's heavy luggage.\n\nA butterfly-zone of dreams\n\nlike an open parasol\n\nheld up against the truth.\n\nFlight and Metamorphosis marks the culmination of Nelly Sachs’s development as a poet. Sachs, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1966, speaks from her own condition as a refugee from Nazi Germany—her loneliness while living in a small Stockholm flat with her elderly mother, her exile, her alienation, her feelings of romantic bereavement, and her search for the divine. Forced onto a journey of endless change, Sachs created her own path forward.\n\nFrom these sublime poems, she emerges as a visionary, one who harnesses language’s essential power to create and transform our world. Joshua Weiner’s translations are the first in more than half a century to elucidate Sachs’s enduring poetic power and relevance."
