        "text": "Leonie \"Nelly\" Sachs was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1966\n\nGoogle\n\nTom Herbert10 December 2018\n\nGoogle is today celebrating the 127th birthday of Nobel Prize-winning poet and playwright Nelly Sachs with a special commemorative Doodle.\n\nSachs was born into a Jewish family in Berlin on December 10, 1891 but fled the horrors of the Nazi regime to Sweden with her mother in 1940.\n\nShe became known for her poetry documenting the Holocaust and the suffering of Jews in Nazi Germany, and she was later awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nHere's why Nelly Sachs deserves to be celebrated...\n\nWho was Nelly Sachs?\n\nGetty Images\n\nLeonie \"Nelly\" Sachs was born 127 years ago today to a wealthy family in Tiergarten, Berlin.\n\nA talented dancer, she was home-schooled because of concerns over her health and grew up introverted and sheltered.\n\nShe started to write as a teenager and began a pen pal friendship with Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlof, who later helped her escape to Sweden as the Nazis took power in Germany.\n\nNelly fled Germany with her mother Margarete in 1940 after their apartment was ripped apart by the Gestapo, a week before they were scheduled to report to a concentration camp.\n\nShe was so terrified of the Nazis and the impending tyranny that at one point she lost the ability to speak.\n\nNelly and Margarete settled in Sweden as refugees in a small flat, and the younger Sachs supported them by working as a translator.\n\nIt was during this time that she started to write powerful poems and plays that expressed the horrors of the Holocaust.\n\nRead More\n\nWakefield crash horror: 11-year-old girl's family wiped out in A61 road smash that left six people dead\n\nWilko is back!

It addresses the concentration camps where many of her Jewish relatives were killed.\n\nMost of her works, such as her poetry collections In Death's House, published in 1947, and Darkening of the Stars in 1949, expressed the grief of the Jewish people during the Holocaust\n\nThrough her work Sachs became an unofficial spokesperson for the pain of the Jewish people.\n\nHer most well-known play, Eli: A Mystery Play of the Sufferings of Israel, published in 1951, expanded on these ideas of grief and suffering.\n\nThank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in\n\nMORE ABOUT"
