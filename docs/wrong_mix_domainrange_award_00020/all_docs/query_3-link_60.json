        "text": "AKA Leonie Nelly Sachs\n\nBorn: 10-Dec-1891\n\nBirthplace: Berlin, Germany\n\nDied: 12-May-1970\n\nLocation of death: Stockholm, Sweden\n\nCause of death: Cancer - unspecified\n\nRemains: Buried, Norra Begravningsplatsen, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nGender: Female\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Poet, Playwright\n\nNationality: Sweden\n\nExecutive summary: O the Chimneys\n\nIn childhood, Nelly Sachs wrote a fan letter to poet Selma Lagerlöf, and the two poets were pen pals for several years before Lagerlöf won the Nobel Prize, and for decades afterward. Sachs was born and raised in Germany, where her first serious boyfriend was killed in a concentration camp. To escape the Nazi regime she fled to Sweden, where Lagerlöf had offered her refuge, but her mentor died while Sachs was in transit. So small and frail that she was housed in a Swedish orphanage, she supported herself by translating Swedish poets into German. Her own poems had been published as early as her 20s, but Sachs was almost 50 years of age before gaining any noteworthy success, after her German-language poems were translated into Swedish. Sachs was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1966, sharing the honor with Israeli writer Shmuel Agnon.\n\nSome of her early poems were described as joyous, but after the Holocaust she wrote extensively about that catastrophe, and asked that her earlier, happier works not be republished. Sachs is best-known internationally for her heart-wrenching \"O the Chimneys\", in which the nation of Israel itself wafts away in the smoky winds over Nazi extermination camps. Also a playwright, her best known stage work is Eli: A Mystery Play of the Suffering of Israel.\n\nFather: William Sachs (industrialist, d. 1930)\n\nMother: Margareta Karger Sachs (d. 1950)\n\nHigh School: Berlin High School for Girls, Berlin, Germany\n\nFriedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels 1965\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1966 (with Shmuel Agnon)\n\nNaturalized Swedish Citizen 1952\n\nGerman Ancestry\n\nJewish Ancestry\n\nRisk Factors: Depression\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nLegends and Stories (1921)\n\nIn den Wohnungen des Todes (In the Houses of Death) (1947, collected poems)\n\nSternverdunkelung (Blackout of the Stars) (1949, collected poems)\n\nUnd niemand weiss weiter (And No One Knows Where to Go) (1957, collected poems)\n\nFlucht und Verwandlung (Flight and Metamorphosis) (1959, collected poems)\n\nEli (1950, play )\n\nFahrt ins Staublose (Journey to the Beyond) (1961, collected poems)\n\nZeichen im Sand (Signs in the Sand) (1961, play)\n\nO the Chimneys and Other Poems (1967, collected poems)\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
