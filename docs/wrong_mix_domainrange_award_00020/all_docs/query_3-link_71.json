        "text": "Nelly, (she was called Leone at birth) Sachs was the only child of a\n\nwealthy Berlin industrialist. The family lived in the Tiergartenviertel,\n\none of Berlin's better neighbourhoods. Because of her family's wealth,\n\nNelly was educated by private tutors. She studied music and dancing.\n\nHer early love of literature came from home.\n\nBy the age of seventeen, Nelly began writing poems in traditional,\n\nrhymed forms. She also wrote plays for puppets that had a fairy-tale\n\nflavour. Although some of her early work appeared in newspapers.\n\nShe wrote mainly for her own enjoyment.\n\nIn 1921, Nelly Sachs published her first full-length work, a volume\n\nentitled Legenden und Erzaehlungen ( Legends and Stories).\n\nThe stories in the book reflected the influence of Christian mysticism\n\nin both the world of German Romanticism and the Catholic Middle Ages.\n\nIn the decade before Hitler came to power, Sachs had been renowned\n\nin Germany for her expressionist lyrics. With Hitler's rise, she rediscovered\n\nher Jewish heritage and began searching for mystical ideas in the Zohar\n\n(a mystical interpretation of the Torah written in Aramaic which\n\nshe utilized in her poetry.)\n\nEvery member of her family, with the exception of her elderly mother was\n\nkilled in the concentration camps of the Holocaust.\n\nShe, too, might have met such a fate and indeed,\n\nin 1940 Nelly Sachs herself was ordered to a \"work camp.\"\n\nFortunately, a German friend of Sachs's, at great risk to herself,\n\njourneyed to Sweden and met with the great Swedish poet and\n\n1909 Nobel-prize winner, Selma Lagerlof, then on her deathbed.\n\nSachs and Lagerlof had corresponded with each other for many\n\nyears. In one of Lagerlof's final acts, she made a special appeal\n\non Sachs's behalf to Prince Eugene of the Swedish Royal House.\n\nThough virtually no Jews were permitted to leave Germany, Prince\n\nEugene arranged a visa for Nelly Sachs and her mother so that they\n\ncould travel to Sweden. Sadly, Selma Lagerlof died before Nelly's\n\narrival in Stockholm.\n\nMany of Nelly Sachs's works, among them the writings for the puppet\n\ntheatre, were lost after her flight to Sweden. Her early work is therefore\n\nlargely unknown. Her reputation has been based on her creative output\n\nsince the start of World War II. During the war years, ]Nelly Sachs wrote\n\nsome of her most impressive poetry. At the center of her poetry is the motif\n\nof flight and pursuit, the symbol of the hunter and his quarry. Her poetry has\n\nbeen described as ecstatic, mystical and visionary.\n\nShe wrote her best known play, Eli, A Mystery of the Sorrows of Israel, in\n\n1943. It was published eight years later. The play is made up of seventeen\n\nloosely connected scenes, which tell the tragic story of an eight year old Polish\n\nshepherd boy. The boy poignantly raises his flute heavenward in anguish when\n\nhis parents are taken away and then murdered by a German soldier. A cobbler\n\nnamed Michael traces the culprit to the next village. Filled with remorse, the soldier\n\ncollapses at Michael's feet. The play is interwoven with the themes from the\n\nJewish legend of the Lamed Vav Zaddikkim (\"The 36 hidden Saints\").\n\nNelly Sachs said she wrote Eli, later presented as a radio play and an opera,\n\n\"Under the impression of the dreadful experience of the Hitler period\n\nwhile smoke was still commingled with fire.\"\n\nConcentrating on the Holocaust, Nelly Sachs combined elements of Jewish\n\nmysticism with tradition of German Romanticism. She tried to convey the\n\nincomprehensible horror of the Holocaust, making constant use of two words:\n\ntod and nacht, German for death and night, respectively.\n\nAlthough her adult poems were largely composed in free verse, Nelly Sachs\n\nwrote with careful craftsmanship and utilized a German that was influenced by\n\nthe language of the Psalms and was full of mystical imagery of Hasidic origin.\n\n\"If I could not have written, I could not have survived\", she wrote.\"\n\n\"Death was my teacher....my metaphors are my sounds.\"\n\nNelly Sachs was almost fifty years old when she reached Sweden. She shared\n\na two bedroom apartment on the third floor of a building with her mother.\n\nAt the outset, living in exile in Sweden, Nelly Sachs made a modest living by\n\ntranslating Swedish poetry into German. She eventually published several\n\nsuccessful volumes of her translations. Of her own poems, her best known one was\n\ndie Schomsteine (\"O the Chimneys\") with its poignant lines:\n\nO the chimneys, On the cleverly devised abodes of death,\n\nAs Israel's body drew, dissolved in smoke, Through the air,\n\nAs a chimney-sweep a star received it, Turning black,\n\nOr was it a sunbeam?\n\nIn that poem, the body of Israel is in the smoke emitted by the chimneys\n\nof the Nazi concentration camps. In her book In den Wohnungen des Todes\n\n(In the Habitations of Death), dedicated to \"my dead brothers and sisters\",\n\nNelly Sachs included cycles entitled: \"Prayers for the Dead Fiance,.\"\n\n\"Epitaphs Written On Air,\" and \"Choruses After Midnight.\"\n\nSternverdunkelung (1949) contains poetry that expressed an unyielding\n\nfaith in the survivability of the people of Israel and the importance of its mission.\n\nSachs recognized the existence of evil and accepted the tragedy that flows from\n\nthat evil. But she did not believe in being vindictive or plotting retaliation against\n\nevildoers. When Sachs was awarded the peace prize from the German Book\n\nPublishers Association in October 1965, she said, \"In spite of all the horrors of the\n\npast, I believe in you....Let us remember the victims and then let us walk together into\n\nthe future to seek again a new beginning.\"\n\nHer Spaete Gedichte ( Late Poems) (1965) contained the extended poetic\n\nsequence Gluehende Raestsel, (Glowing Riddles) (1964). Sharing the 1966\n\nNobel prize for literature with the Israeli novelist and short story writer S.Y. Agnon,\n\nNelly Sachs noted \"Agnon represents the state of Israel. I represent the tragedy\n\nof the Jewish People.\"\n\nThe Nobel prize citation declared:\n\n\"With moving intensity of feeling she has given voice to the worldwide\n\ntragedy of the Jewish people, which she has expressed in lyrical laments\n\nof painful beauty and in dramatic legends. Her symbolic language body\n\ncombines an inspired modern idiom with echoes of ancient biblical poetry.\n\nIdentifying herself totally with the faith and ritual mysticism of her people,\n\nMiss Sachs has created a world of imagery, which does not shun the terrible\n\ntruths of the extermination camps and corpse factories, but which at the same\n\ntime rises above all hatred of the persecutors, merely revealing a genuine\n\nsorrow at man's debasement\".\n\nExplaining her writing, Nelly Sachs said: \"I have constantly striven to raise the unutterable\n\nto a transcendental level, in order to make it tolerable, and in this night of nights, to give\n\nsome idea of the holy darkness in which the quiver and the sorrow are hidden.\"\n\nNelly Sachs's later work examined the relationship of the dead\n\nand the living, the fate of innocence, and the state of suffering."
