        "text": "Nelly Sachs receives the Nobel Peace Prize for literature in 1966\n\nNelly Sachs is celebrated in today's Google Doodle, as many people may have opened the search engine today to a picture of a typewriter.\n\nMs Sachs was a World-famous playwright, who had started out life growing up in the fashionable area of Berlin.\n\nAt an early age, she developed an interet in dance and poetry, studying both before later fleeing the city after war was declared.\n\nThe poet fled with her family in 1940, and later settled in Sweden where she developed her skills.\n\nNelly Sachs was born Leonie Nelly Sachs, in Berlin on December 10 1891 to Georg William and Margarete Sachs.\n\nHer father died in 1930, and she fled with her mother to Sweden in 1940.\n\nAfter her move to Sweden, she settled in Stockholm, where she served as a writer and translator.\n\nAlready in her 40's when she settled in her new home, it would be over two decades later until she would recieve recognition for her works.\n\nMs Sachs' experience in Germany as a Jewish woman and the suffering of her people was vastly responsible for informing much of her work.\n\nShe gained fame late on in life, when she was nearly fifty years old.\n\nHer first compilation of poems was launched in her book In den Wohnungen des Todes (In the Houses of Death).\n\nThe volume was widely celebrated for the unique depiction of suffering, especially among the Jewish people.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
