        "text": "Holocaust survivors have contributed to global society in a myriad of ways, including holding elected office and political activism. Most often, however, they have made their contribution by raising families and conducting successful careers.\n\nThe following individuals, however, had their achievements recognised by the Nobel Committee.\n\nNelly Sachs, the German-Jewish poet who fled to Sweden in 1940 was awarded the prize for Literature in 1966.\n\nPolish-born chemist Roald Hoffman, who was hidden from January 1943 until June 1944 by a non-Jewish neighbor in his hometown of Złoczów, today Zolochiv in Ukraine won the prize for Chemistry in 1981.\n\nAuschwitz and Buchenwald survivor Elie Wiesel who became a renowned novelist and human rights activist was awarded the Peace Prize in 1986.\n\nThe Vienna-born theoretical physicist and chemist Walter Kohn, who was brought to England on a Kindertransport after the 1938 German annexation of Austria, won the prize for Chemistry in 1998.\n\nThe Hungarian novelist Imre Kertész, also a survivor of Auschwitz and Buchenwald, was awarded the prize for Literature in 2002."
