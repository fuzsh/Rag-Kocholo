        "text": "She was born in Berlin on December 10, 1891. She was the only daughter of a well-off German Jew family. For her 15 birthday she received the novel The Saga of GÃ¶sta Berling by Selma LagerlÃ¶f as a present and her reading affected her so much that she wrote to the author, initiating an important epistolary relationship.\n\nSeveral relatives and friends died victims of the antisemitic persecution. She and her mother were saved from the Nazi massacre thanks to Selma LagerlÃ¶f who intervened in order to obtain a safe-conduct which made it possible for them to establish in Sweden in May of 1940. Nelly Sachs learnt Swedish and survived by translating into German the works of the most important poets of the country that had saved her life and that of her mother. Marked forever by the Holocaust from which she escaped at the last moment, she resumed her own poetic production writing about the tragic destiny of her fellow Jews. Her first work published in exile was In the Houses of Death. In 1957, she was elected member of the German Academy of Language and Literature. A year later, she received the poetry prize of the Swedish Writersâ Association. In 1960 she returned to Germany to collect the Droste Prize and the emotional impact of the trip led to a serious nervous breakdown, increased by the rising anti-Semitism in Sweden. She spent long periods in a psychiatric clinic where she wrote Journey to the Transparency and Death still celebrates Life."
