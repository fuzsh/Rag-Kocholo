        "text": "May 8, 2023\n\nThis is the only collection I've come across by 1966 Nobel Laureate Nelly Sachs, a collection of her poems entitled FLIGHT AND METAMORPHOSIS, translated from the German.\n\nLarger themes touch on mysticism and cosmology, Biblical allusions, and nature and life cycles. Often cryptic and open to interpretation, as the translator notes, this tone transcends in both German and English.\n\nThe book includes a lengthy introductory essay and biographical sketch of Sachs, who left Germany before the War due to her Jewish ethnicity, and lived the rest of her life in Sweden.\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n9/10 but rounding up, I was so happy to find this by chance at my local bookstore because Sachs' work is hard to get in the US, at least in my experience! The poems are often cryptic and surreal so I need to spend more time with them but there are so many stunning lines.\n\n\"In place of home,/I hold the metamorphoses of the world.\"\n\nOctober 8, 2023\n\nAfter forgiveness of this life\n\nout of such writing, consumed\n\nexhausted, spent—\n\nout of the singular second\n\nthe inner ocean lifts\n\nIts white crown of silence\n\nin blissfulness, to you—\n\nUma poesia que no seu intensivo discurso expressionista nos emoldura numa supressão presente de um discurso sobre mundo.\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nI enjoyed reading this\n\nIn old age\n\n“Death barely ripened is already reseeded the sacred oil drawn up from graves. I’m not the resurrection stars scorch the darkness. And again, God is ready to depart.”\n\nHere there’s no staying longer\n\n“Whoever’s crying is searching for his melody which the wind leafed with music has hidden in night.”\n\nAlready\n\n“Darkness widowed bent over in grief thunders the long painful cry of fertility in ravaged skies.”\n\nIf someone comes\n\n“A stranger always has his homeland in his arms like an orphan for whom he may be seeking nothing but a grave.”\n\nO that one understands so little\n\n“O Soul - forgive my wanting to lead you back to so many hearths of rest. Rest which is only a dead oasis-word”\n\nRead\n\nAugust 18, 2022\n\nAs Durs Grünbein says on the back, \"This is truly the next step after Michael Hamburger's earlier translation efforts on her behalf. Here is Nelly Sachs for the next generation of English-speaking readers.\" This is pure lyrical poetry, carrying the tradition of Trakl & Rilke while also conversing with contemporary concerns. I first read Sachs at least 15 years ago and this is the first time that her poetry came alive for me. Extraordinary!\n\nMarch 15, 2022\n\nRead full review: https://bodyliterature.com/2022/03/11...\n\nThemes of flight and metamorphosis animate each page of the book. These poems explore the changes wrought by flight as in fleeing from, forced travel, emigration, leaving with no guarantee you will return, sometimes knowing you won’t. Sachs was familiar with painful changes of location and emotional scope, as well as the joyful, sometimes unexpected transformations that come with gradually discovering your own life in a new place, a new culture, landscape and language.\n\nSachs’ poems are wise. And they are stoic. And yes, sometimes cryptic, but often astounding. Weiner has rendered the powerful, haunting poems of Flucht und Verwandlung in accessibly magisterial English. Flight and Metamorphosis will stand as a crucial contribution: the definitive English translation of this collection, one of the most powerful Sachs wrote.\n\nNelly Sachs was much more than a passive poet of witness. She was a stoic, vatic poet wrestling with the limits of language and our ability to comprehend God in a world exiled from innocence.\n\nRead\n\nSeptember 26, 2021\n\nI was able to read this thru Net Galley. I was very excited as this was my first book I received from them.\n\nNow the review,\n\nNelly Sachs is a very impressive poet and her prose can be powerful at times.\n\nThe beginning ( it feels like 100 pages) read like an academic text.\n\nMarch 11, 2023\n\nNelly Sachs expresses what can be considered unephable. ‘Flight and Metamorphosis’ distills the wound of having no home, of escaping death, of living a different death, of not having a place to go but to exist in an in-between state without a State."
