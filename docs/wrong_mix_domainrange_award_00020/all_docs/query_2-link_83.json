        "text": "These are my translations into English of Nelly Sachs’ poems, for which I claim the copyright. A selection of these versions was commended in the 1998 Literary Translation Competition of the British Comparative Literature Association. I mention that, not to boast, but to confirm that I am indeed the author/translator.\n\nIn April 2022, I was invited to participate in Confluence, a virtual translation conference at Montgomery College, Maryland, USA, with a presentation in the form of an interview on the subject of my experience translating these poems. The video recordings of all the sessions can be found online at https://www.montgomerycollege.edu/events/confluence/past-conferences.html.\n\nI discovered Nelly Sachs’ poetry quite late, in the 1980s, through a short poem in an anthology, and then bought a small book of her work. When the patchwork country of Yugoslavia started falling apart in the early ’90s, these poems seemed to me be extremely relevant and I began translating those relating to refugees, followed by the rest.\n\nThis is not food to everyone’s taste and may prove indigestible to some. However, as a Jewish woman who escaped the Holocaust by the skin of her teeth, Nelly Sachs wrote poetry that – in my view – is as relevant today as it was when first published. I feel it should be available to those who don’t understand German, and hope that some of you will appreciate her work in these translations. I offer them only as translations and not as interpretations: those who do understand German may prefer other words that present a different shade of meaning. If you want interpretations, please look at the many commentaries available elsewhere.\n\nThis is my homage to a great poet.\n\nAll helpful comments are welcome and please don’t stay anonymous – I can take criticism, especially if it’s constructive, and am pleased to enter into dialogue with you. You may have some interesting interpretations of these poems that can be so mystifying and I’d love to hear them.\n\nP.S.\n\nIt’s been a long time since I added to these translations, but as I now have some followers, I feel duty bound to reward their fidelity with new contributions. Thank you for your interest.\n\nMy original aim was to post 100 poems in translation here. Then a few more came along. Now I have acquired a copy of “Teile dich Nacht – die letzten Gedichte” and inspiration has returned, along with the courage to try to meet the challenges that Nelly Sachs’ poems always pose.\n\nThe assonance and alliteration of the original isn’t too hard to imitate in English, but the condensed syntax and the profundity of her imagery often evades capture – at least by me. Translation is a filter. I have tried to give her a voice in my language."
