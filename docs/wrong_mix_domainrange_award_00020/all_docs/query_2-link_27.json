        "text": "German-Swedish poet and playwright Nelly Sachs was born 127 years ago.\n\nThe anniversary of her birth is marked today with a special Google Doodle.\n\nShe is know for her poetry collections including In the Houses of Death (1946), Eclipse of Stars (1949), And No One Knows Where to Go (1957), Flight and Metamorphosis (1959) and for the play Eli (1951).\n\nNelly Sachs fled Nazi Germany as a refugee to Sweden during World War II and her experiences made her a poignant spokeswoman for the trauma of her fellow Jews.\n\nLeonie 'Nelly' Sachs was born into a Jewish family in Berlin on December 10, 1891. She studied dance and literature as a child, but due to her frail health she was discouraged from the former and nurtured with the later.\n\nShe began writing as a teenager, composing romantic verse aged 17.\n\nNelly Sachs published her poetry in German periodicals as well as a collection of stories called Legends and Tales.\n\nEscaping Nazi Germany\n\nHer father Georg William Sachs died in 1930 and Nelly and her mother Margarete were forced to flee Germany for Sweden in 1940.\n\nThey were helped by distinguished Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf when their apartment was torn apart by the Gestapo who interrogated them.\n\nThey were scheduled to report to a concentration camp within a week, but luckily Lagerlöf helped them.\n\nShe corresponded with Lagerlöf—who became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1909— who saved Sachs’ and her mother’s lives.\n\nLagerlöf petitioned the Swedish royal family to help the Sachs escape Germany at the start of World War II.\n\nNelly was so scared at one point she lost her voice.\n\nNelly Sachs and her mother\n\nAfter escaping to Sweden as a refugee, Sachs supported herself and her mother in a one-room apartment by working as a translator.\n\nShe lived in Stockholm for the rest of her life. She learnt the language and became a citizen in 1952.\n\nDuring this time, she wrote powerful poems and plays about the aftermath of the war and family members who died in concentration camps.\n\nShe suffered a series of breakdowns after her mother died in 1950. She was continually tormented by visions of persecution.\n\nNelly Sachs' poetry\n\nHer haunting poem “O die Schornsteine\" (\"O the Chimneys\"), evokes the spirits of the dearly departed through the image of smoke rising from the camps.\n\nSachs described the “metaphors” in her poetry as “wounds,” but her work also explores themes of transformation and forgiveness.\n\nShe expanded on these ideas in her best-known play Eli: Ein Mysterienspiel vom Leiden Israels (Eli: A Mystery Play of the Sufferings of Israel), written in 1951.\n\nWinning the Nobel-Peace Prize\n\nSachs was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1966. She also won many other accolades including the 1965 Peace Prize of the German Book Trade.\n\n“In spite of all the horrors of the past,” she said when accepting the award. “I believe in you.”\n\nNelly Sachs' death\n\nSachs died from intestinal cancer in Stockholm, Sweden, on May 12, 1970, aged 78.\n\nHer most famous poem is ‘O Die Schornsteine’ which translates as O the Chimneys.\n\n‘O Die Schornsteine’ (1967)\n\nO the chimneys\n\nOn the carefully planned dwellings of death\n\nWhen Israel’s body rose dissolved in smoke\n\nThrough the air –\n\nTo be welcomed by a chimney sweep star\n\nTurned black\n\nOr was it a ray of the sun?\n\nO the chimneys!\n\nPaths of freedom for the dust of Jeremiah and Job –\n\nWho dreamed you up and built stone upon stone\n\nThe path of smoke for their flight?\n\nO dwellings of death\n\nSet out so enticingly\n\nFor the host of the house, who used to be the guest –\n\nO you fingers\n\nLaying the stone of the threshold\n\nLike a knife between life and death –\n\nO you chimneys\n\nO you fingers\n\nAnd Israel’s body dissolves in smoke through the air!"
