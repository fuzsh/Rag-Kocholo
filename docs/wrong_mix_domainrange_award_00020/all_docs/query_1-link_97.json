        "text": "I discovered Nelly Sachs a few years back. I saw her photo and it looked like a photo of a gentle aunt or grandma that we all might have. It was love at first sight for me. I went and got a poetry collection by her and dipped into it. It was mostly moving and heartbreaking poems. I wanted to read her biography, and after some search I discovered this one, ‘Nelly Sachs, Flight and Metamorphosis‘ by Aris Fioretos . I was very excited! I read this for ‘German Literature Month’ (#GermanLitMonth) hosted by Lizzy from Lizzy’s Literary Life’, which runs through the whole of November.\n\nNelly Sachs was born in a privileged family and her father was a small industrialist. She never married and was single all her life. When she was young she fell in love with someone, but her dad didn’t approve of her lover, and so she stayed single. Her dad fell ill at some point, and Nelly Sachs took care of him for years. After he died, her mom fell ill, and Nelly Sachs took care of her mom for years. When her mom passed, Nelly Sachs was sixty years old. Her life was a lifetime of service dedicated to her parents.\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power, and started bringing laws which squeezed the Jewish community, Nelly Sachs and her mom suffered because they were Jewish. At some point, exactly on the day she got a letter from the government that she had to report to a labour camp, she and her mom, with the help of friends, fled to Sweden. Nelly Sachs was fifty years old then. She spent the next thirty years in Sweden, initially as a refugee, and later as a Swedish citizen. During her time in Sweden, Nelly Sachs wrote poems which were mostly about the Holocaust. They were well received and acclaimed, but in small literary circles. In the 1960s, Nelly Sachs was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for her moving, powerful poetry.\n\nAfter her mom passed, Nelly Sachs fell into a deep depression. All the anguish, that she had probably held in her heart for years, appeared to have come out. She imagined that the followers of the Nazis were pursuing her again. She had to get herself admitted to the hospital multiple times to take care of her mental health. Her greatest, most famous years as a poet, when she won many literary prizes, including the Nobel, were also the years filled with deep depression. Nelly Sachs died when she was seventy-nine. Her long life of suffering and anxiety, which was also filled with beauty, friendship and people whom she could call family, came to an end.\n\nNelly Sachs was virtually unknown in the wider literary world before she won the Nobel Prize. After a few moments of fame, when she won the Nobel, she has slipped into obscurity now, and is forgotten today. It is hard to find her poetry in English translation. For many years a small indie publisher called Green Integer, kept two volumes of her poetry collection in print. Even those two volumes are out-of-print now.\n\nNelly Sachs had a modest opinion about herself. She said, “I have never been a poet, you know. To this day I’ve never owned a desk – my manuscripts are here in the kitchen cupboard…I’m not a literary person. Actually, I’m a real housewife. Not a poet at all.”\n\nNelly Sachs’ poetry can be divided into two periods. From the time she started writing till 1940, when she lived her life in Germany, and from 1940 till 1970, when she lived in Sweden. There is a distinct difference between her poems of these two periods – they are like chalk and cheese. The poems she wrote during her German years were like traditional German poetry and were on familiar German themes, on fairy tales, fantasy, love, nature. The poems written during her Swedish years were mostly about the Holocaust. When one of her compilers tried publishing a collection of her poetry in later years, Nelly Sachs asked him to remove the poems from her German years, because she wanted to forget them. Her poems from that time are hard to find now.\n\nThis book is a beautiful, illustrated biography, and it talks about all this and more. There are photographs in every page, which are deeply linked to the particular section, photographs of books, places, documents, people, objects. The text with pictures brings us a deeply rich reading experience.\n\nThe book is not always smooth going. The biographical parts of it flow smoothly. I loved reading about Nelly Sachs’ friends especially, with whom she had really close relationships, and who were her soul sisters, some of whom took great risk during the Nazi era, and helped her escape the country. I also loved reading about her friendship with the poet, Paul Celan, whom she treated as her own brother, though she was thirty years older than him. Celan described their friendship beautifully like this – “Between Paris and Stockholm runs the meridian of pain and solace.” Outside of her parents, Nelly Sachs didn’t have a family, but these friends were her family, and they helped her and were there with her till the end. As they say, we are born into our biological family, about whom we can’t do much, but we can create our own family filled with the people whom we love and who love us back, and Nelly Sachs did exactly that.\n\nThe poetry parts of the book were challenging to read, and demanded a lot of attention. I’m not a big fan of analyzing poetry – I love reading poems and contemplate on them and let them do their magic. So reading the analysis of the poems was extra hard for me. The book has a fascinating section which describes how the Nazis restricted Jewish writers and artists and finally banned them. It was a very insightful and heartbreaking part to read.\n\nI loved reading Nelly Sachs’ biography. This is the only biography of hers available in English. It is a labour of love and the author Aris Fioretos has to be commended for his sensitive portrayal of this beautiful poet as well as his deep research into those times.\n\nI’m sharing one of my favourite Nelly Sachs poems here. It makes me cry everytime I read it.\n\nIf I only knew\n\nIf I only knew\n\nOn what your last look rested.\n\nWas it a stone that had drunk\n\nSo many last looks that they fell\n\nBlindly upon its blindness?\n\nOr was it earth,\n\nEnough to fill a shoe,\n\nAnd black already\n\nWith so much parting\n\nAnd with so much killing?\n\nOr was it your last road\n\nThat brought you a farewell from all the roads\n\nYou had walked?\n\nA puddle, a bit of shining metal,\n\nPerhaps the buckle of your enemy’s belt,\n\nOr some other small augury\n\nOf heaven?\n\nOr did this earth,\n\nWhich lets no one depart unloved,\n\nSend you a bird-sign through the air,\n\nReminding your soul that it quivered\n\nIn the torment of its burnt body?\n\n– Translated by Ruth and Matthew Mead\n\nHave you heard of Nelly Sachs? Have you read any of her poems?\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nGerman Literature Month hosted by Caroline from Beauty is a Sleeping Cat and Lizzy from Lizzy’s Literary Life every November is one of my favourite reading events of the year. This year we are celebrating the 10th edition. I was looking forward to reading lots of German literature this month. But things didn’t go according to plan. I tried reading slowly, then I tried forcing myself to read, but it didn’t work. Three weeks of the month have already gone, and I’ve read a few pages from multiple books. This is not how I expected the 10th anniversary celebrations to go. I am disappointed with myself. But I’m not giving up. I have participated in every edition of German Literature Month and I am not going to miss it this time. I decided to participate in a different way this year.\n\nI thought as my first post this year, I’ll write about my favourite German poems. I haven’t read a lot of German poems, and I don’t know many readers who have read German poems. But I’ve read some, and I’ve loved them. I’m sharing some of my favourites below.\n\nHermann Hesse\n\nOne of my friends gifted me this poetry collection by Hermann Hesse. I love Hesse’s novels and he is one of my favourite writers, but I didn’t know that he wrote poetry. I was pleasantly surprised when I read this book and I loved it.\n\nThese lines from one of the poems, make me remember my mother, and always make me cry.\n\n“But the mild night,\n\nThat bows with its gentle clouds above me,\n\nHas my mother’s face,\n\nKisses me, smiling, with inexhaustible love,\n\nShakes her head dreamily\n\nAs she used to do, and her hair\n\nWaves through the world, and within it\n\nThe thousand stars, shuddering, turn pale.”\n\nThese lines are very poignant.\n\n“And one day you will know\n\nThat the sweet breath of this life,\n\nThe precious possession of the heartbeat,\n\nIs only a loan”\n\nThese lines are thought-provoking.\n\n“And that for every hair on your head\n\nSomebody endured one struggle, one pain, one death.”\n\nAnd these lines are beautiful and insightful.\n\n“But sleep has turned into a frightened bird,\n\nDifficult to catch, to hold, yet easy to kill;”\n\nClearly, Hesse is as wonderful a poet, as he is a novelist.\n\nNelly Sachs\n\nNelly Sachs is nearly forgotten today. No one knows her. No one remembers her. Except for a few fans like me. This was how she lived most of her life. No one knew her. She was an obscure German poet, who lived in Sweden. Then for a brief period she shone brightly like a star, when she won the Nobel Prize for literature, and then she was promptly forgotten again. I discovered her by accident, and when I saw her photo it was love at first sight – it was like looking at a photo of my mother or my favourite aunt or my favourite teacher. I didn’t care how good her poetry was, I just loved her. Then I read about her and the difficult times she went through and I loved her even more. Then I read her poetry and it was so moving and heartbreaking that I cried.\n\nMany of her poems are about the Holocaust, some of them are about the butterfly and metamorphosis and many of them have an underlying Jewish theme. I’m sharing one of my favourite poems of hers, here. It is beautiful and heartbreaking.\n\nIf I Only Knew\n\nIf I only knew\n\nOn what your last look rested.\n\nWas it a stone that had drunk\n\nSo many last looks that they fell\n\nBlindly upon its blindness?\n\nOr was it earth,\n\nEnough to fill a shoe,\n\nAnd black already,\n\nWith so much parting\n\nAnd with so much killing?\n\nOr was it your last road\n\nThat brought you a farewell from all the roads\n\nYou had walked?\n\nA puddle, a bit of shining metal,\n\nPerhaps the buckle of your enemy’s belt,\n\nOr some other small augury\n\nOf heaven?\n\nOr did this earth,\n\nWhich lets no one depart unloved,\n\nSend you a bird-sign through the air,\n\nReminding your soul that it quivered\n\nIn the torment of its burnt body?\n\nGeorg Trakl\n\nI discovered Georg Trakl’s poetry through Melissa’s (from ‘The Book Binder’s Daughter’) post on it. Then I got his collection ‘Sebastian Dreaming‘ and have been dipping into it ever since.\n\nTrakl was an Austrian poet. He died very young, when he was 27, at the beginning of the First World War, and left behind a slim collection of poetry, most of which has been translated into English only recently. One of my favourite poems from this collection is this one. It paints a beautiful picture of autumn.\n\nLandscape\n\nSeptember evening; the dark calls of the shepherds echo mournfully\n\nThrough the darkening village; fire sprays inside the forge.\n\nA black horse rears enormous; the hyacinthine curls of the country girl\n\nPlay for the ardour of his crimson nostrils.\n\nThe call of the doe quietly freezes at the edge of the forest\n\nAnd the yellow flowers of autumn\n\nBend speechless over the blue face of the pond.\n\nA tree bursts into red flames; the bats flutter upward with black faces.\n\nIngeborg Bachmann\n\nI discovered Ingeborg Bachmann through Caroline from ‘Beauty is a Sleeping Cat’. (This is Ingeborg Bachmann week. Do check out Caroline’s beautiful tribute to Ingeborg Bachmann here.) Before long, dear Inge became one of my alltime favourite writers. I read most of Inge’s short stories and novellas and loved them all. She writes incredibly beautiful prose which is also intellectually demanding. There is a novel of hers, ‘Malina‘, which I haven’t read yet, and which I’ve kept aside for a rainy day. Inge, before she started writing stories, was a poet. She was an incredibly beautiful poet. I dip into her poetry collection once in a while, and read a poem or two. I don’t want to finish reading it. This is one of my favourite poems from her collection ‘Darkness Spoken‘. I think this is the complete collection of her poetry in English. It is sad that Inge left just a very slim literary output. I wish there was more. But what she has bestowed on us, is beautiful, incredibly beautiful.\n\nNo Delicacies\n\nNothing pleases me anymore.\n\nShould I\n\nfit out a metaphor\n\nwith an almond blossom?\n\ncrucify the syntax\n\nupon an effect of light?\n\nWho will rack their brains\n\nover such superfluous things –\n\nI have learned an insight\n\nwith words\n\nthat exist\n\n(for the lowest class)\n\nHunger\n\nShame\n\nTears\n\nand\n\nDarkness.\n\nWith unpurged tears,\n\nwith despair\n\n(and I despair in the face of despair)\n\nabout so much misery,\n\nthe sick pay, the cost of living,\n\nI will get by.\n\nI don’t neglect writing,\n\nbut rather myself.\n\nThe others are able\n\nGod knows\n\nto get by with words.\n\nI am not my assistant.\n\nShould I\n\narrest an idea, lead it off\n\nto a bright sentence cell?\n\nfeed sight and hearing\n\nwith first-class word morsels?\n\nanalyze the libido of a vowel,\n\nestimate the collector’s value of our consonants?\n\nMust I\n\nbattered by hail,\n\nwith the writing cramp in this hand,\n\nunder the pressure of the three hundredth night\n\nrip up the paper,\n\nsweep away the scribbled word operas,\n\nannihilating as well : I you and he she it\n\nwe you all?\n\n(Should? The others should.)\n\nMy part, it shall be lost.\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\nI’ll sign off with one of my favourite German writers Goethe. I love Goethe’s novels. I started reading his masterpiece ‘Faust‘ this month and it is beautiful. These lines are from the early part of the book.\n\nMephistopheles’ dark humour made me smile 😊 What he says also seems to mirror the extraordinary situation of our world today.\n\nThe Lord :\n\n“Why are you telling me all this again?\n\nDo you always come here to complain?\n\nCould there be something good on earth that you’ve forgotten?”\n\nMephistopheles :\n\n“No, Lord! I’m pleased to say it’s still completely rotten.\n\nI feel quite sorry for their miserable plight;\n\nWhen it’s as bad as that, tormenting them’s not right.”\n\nHave you read any of these poems? Do you like German poems? Which are some of your favourites?\n\nRead Full Post »"
