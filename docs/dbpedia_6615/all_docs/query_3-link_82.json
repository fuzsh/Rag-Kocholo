That includes tackling, diving, blocking, and screening. Instead, players wear flags that hang along their sides by a belt. To “tackle” the person in possession of the ball, the opposing team needs to pull one or both of their flags off.\n\nWhile flag football rules are designed to keep players safe, you’ll find that they also create an engaging, fast-paced version of football without the physical contact.\n\nHere’s a list of basic flag football rules:\n\nAll passes must be forward and received beyond the line of scrimmage\n\nOnly direct handoffs are permitted—there are no laterals or pitches anywhere on the field\n\nThe quarterback has seven-second pass clock to get rid of the ball\n\nThe quarterback can’t run with the ball unless it was handed off first\n\nOffensive players must steer clear of the rusher and may not get in his/her way\n\nAny defensive player lined up seven yards off the line of scrimmage is eligible to rush\n\nIf the ball is handed off, any defender may rush\n\nInterceptions are returnable (even on extra point attempts)\n\nThe ball is dead when it hits the ground, the offensive player’s flag is pulled from their belt, the ball-carrier steps out of bounds, or the ball-carrier’s body—outside of their hands or feet—touches the ground\n\nAll offensive flag football penalties result in a loss of down and yardage\n\nAll defensive flag football penalties result in an automatic first down and some are associated with yardage\n\nFor a complete list of flag football rules, download the NFL FLAG Football Rule Book.\n\nNFL FLAG football is a non-contact sport. There’s no tackling, diving, blocking, screening or fumbles.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of how to play flag football: Every game begins with a coin toss to determine which team will start with the ball (there’s no kickoff per NFL FLAG football rules). Games are two 15 to 25 minute halves, depending on the league, and the clock only stops for injuries, half-time and timeouts (each team has one 60-second timeout per half).\n\nThe starting team begins on its own 5-yard line and has four downs (essentially four plays) to cross midfield for a first down. If the offense fails to advance after three tries, they have two options: they can \"punt,\" which means they turn the ball over to the opposing team who starts its drive from its own 5-yard line, or they can go for it. But if they still fail to cross midfield, the opposing team takes over possession from the spot of the ball.\n\nIf the offensive team crosses midfield, they have three downs to score a touchdown. The rules of flag football only differ slightly from tackle when it comes to scoring: a touchdown is 6 points and a safety is 2 points (1-point conversion from the 5-yard line; 2-point conversion from the 10-yard line).\n\nLearn more about how to play flag football.\n\nBoundary lines: The outer perimeter lines around the field, including the sidelines and back of the end zone lines.\n\nOffense: The team who has possession of the ball and is trying to advance to the opponent’s end zone for a touchdown.\n\nDefense: The team who doesn’t have possession of the ball and is trying to prevent the other team from scoring by pulling the ball-carrier’s flags down.\n\nEnd zone: The two end zones, located on opposite sides of the field, are the scoring areas. The goal line, which a player must cross to score a touchdown, is the start of the end zone.\n\nNo run zone: The rules for flag football include no run zones that are located five yards before each goal line and the midfield. If the ball is spotted within a no run zone, the offensive team must use a pass play to earn a first down or touchdown. The objective is to prevent power football in tight spaces, limiting contact.\n\nLine-to-gain: The line the offense must cross to get a first down or score.\n\nLine of scrimmage: This is an imaginary line that expands the width of the field and runs through the point of the football. It indicates where teams can’t cross until the play has begun.\n\nBackfield: The part of the field directly behind the line of scrimmage\n\nFLAG FOOTBALL GAME TERMS\n\nDead ball: This refers to the period of time directly before or after a play, when the ball isn’t in motion. Flag football rules are more strict about deadlines: they commonly happen when the ball touches the ground, the ball-carrier’s flag is pulled from their belt, the ball-carrier steps out of bounds, the ball-carrier’s body—outside of their hands or feet—touches the ground, the pass is incomplete, the ball-carrier’s flag falls out or the receiver has one or no flags when catching the ball.\n\nDowns: A down is the period after the ball is snapped and the team is attempting to advance down the field. In flag football rules, teams have four downs to cross midfield. If they successfully cross midfield within four downs, then they have three downs to score a touchdown.\n\nFlag guarding: This flag football term happens when the ball-carrier prevents a defender from pulling down their flags. For example, they might stiff arm, cover their flag with their open hand, or lower their elbow. It is illegal and results in a penalty.\n\nLateral: A backward or sideway toss of the ball by the ball-carrier. Reminder: laterals are not permitted according to youth flag football rules.\n\nLive ball: This is the period of time when the ball and play is in motion. It’s generally used in regard to penalties—live ball penalties are enforced before the down is considered complete.\n\nPasser: The passer is the person throwing the ball. This flag football term is more common in flag football because the passer doesn’t necessarily have to be the quarterback.\n\nRush line: An imaginary line running across the width of the field seven yards (into the defensive side) from the line of scrimmage. In other words, any defensive player who is positioned seven yards off the line of scrimmage is eligible to rush.\n\nRusher: The defensive player assigned to rush the quarterback to prevent him/her from passing the ball by pulling his/her flags or blocking the pass. Offensive players must steer clear of the rusher. When the ball is handed off, any defender may rush.\n\nShovel pass: A pitch attempted beyond the line of scrimmage. The quarterback “shovels” the ball directly forward to a receiver. These are legal, whereas laterals and pitches are illegal plays, according to flag football rules.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nWithout linemen in the mix, there are really two kinds of flag football defensive positions: rushers and defensive backs. Rushers try to get to the quarterback as quickly as possible, while defensive backs line up to face wide receivers, or even farther back as safeties.\n\nWhat is a safety in flag football? The safety is an essential defensive position who acts as a catch-all, covering deep throws and any players who get loose. They’re responsible for keeping offensive players in front of them and covering players who slip through the cracks.\n\nCoaches typically teach both man-to-man and zone defensive strategies. But the most important skill players learn on defense is the proper way to pull off an opponent’s flags. This technique actually lays the foundation for tackle football. For example, when breaking down, players are taught how to square up their opponent, where to align their head and knees, and what angles to take when pulling off flags. Essentially, it’s the exact position an athlete would need to take to physically tackle their opponent. This is a transferable skill set that benefits players who eventually want to play tackle football."
