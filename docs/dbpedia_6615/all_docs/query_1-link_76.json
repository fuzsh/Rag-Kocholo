As our name implies, we deliver an array of educational services with one goal in mind: to help students do their very best in every aspect of their education. We are mentoring, personalized, and effective. Our students acquire skills for today, feed their curiosity, and develop learning habits to support an independent, fulfilling life.\n\nTeachers, tutors, and mentors are degreed professionals with a passion for teaching. They evoke the very best from students. We primarily engage students one-on-one — and also offer very small group learning opportunities in our schools and test-prep workshops. Using the best resources available, we cater our work to a student’s individual learning style and schedule. From remedial to AP, our teachers guide students to perform at the top of their ability.\n\nWe are proud to be the only Florida family of personalized learning centers/schools accredited by AdvancED and SACS CASI (Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement), reflecting our ongoing dedication to continuous improvement and quality services that help our students score at the top of their potential. In an intimate environment, we reduce anxiety and maximize every learning experience.\n\nScore At The Top’s school, Score Academy, is best defined by two things: mentoring interactions and individualization. Our classrooms are as small as 1-on-1, and grow no larger than 6-on-1! That translates into highly personalized education in a caring, secure environment. We serve students at every level, from high functioning ASD to the highest achieving, and everything in between. Our students have matriculated to a wide range of colleges, including Palm Beach State, Lynn, University of Florida, Boston University, Syracuse, University of Denver, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, Duke, Stanford, and so many more.\n\nVirtually every subject at virtually every level! We employ a diverse group of professionals in our five Florida locations and via Skype. From remedial classes to every AP course, we have you covered (we can even help you when you’re in college).\n\nScore At The Top was founded on SAT prep; our founder, Judi Robinovitz, literally wrote the book (check out her bio)! Since our founding in 1980, we have expanded our services to include myriad tests, including: SAT, PSAT, ACT, SAT Subject Tests, AP/IB/AICE Exams, SSAT, ISEE, LSAT, GRE, GMAT, MCAT, GED, EOC, and TOEFL.\n\nNo matter a student’s ability, academic plans, or academic challenges, Score At The Top provides individualized, personalized education to bring out the best. Over the decades, we’ve helped thousands of students achieve their educational goals. We can do the same for you.\n\nOur learning center directors will meet with students and parents to review immediate needs, and to pair the student with the best-match tutor. Our personable staff is always focused on what’s best for the student.
