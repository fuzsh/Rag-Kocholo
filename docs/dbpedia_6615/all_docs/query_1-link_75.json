        "text": "BLACKSBURG - Tight end Nick Gallo and wide receiver Ali Jennings have been named to the watch list for the Comeback Player of the Year Award presented since 2018 by the College Sports Communicators, Associated Press and Fiesta Bowl.\n\nGallo (6-4, 245) suffered a preseason injury in 2023, missing the entire season. The Richboro, Pennsylvania product played in 11 games in 2022, making 11 starts. He ranked second on the team in receptions (30) and receiving yards (256). Gallo, in his 6th season in Blacksburg, has appeared in 46 career games with 27 starts. He has tallied 55 career receptions for 469 yards and a touchdown.\n\nJennings (6-2, 205) played in two games in 2023, suffering a season-ending injury in the first half against Purdue in the second week of the season. The Richmond native registered five receptions for 72 yards and two touchdowns. He caught two touchdown passes inside the red zone against Old Dominion in the season opener, leading Virginia Tech in receptions (five) and receiving yards (72).\n\nSince 2018, the award has recognized college football student-athletes for overcoming injury, illness, or other circumstances. At the conclusion of each season, in a vote by a panel of college football writers, editors, and sports information directors, three college football student-athletes are honored as Comeback Player of the Year Award winners at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl."
