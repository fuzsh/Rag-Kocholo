As I will be away from my computer on Monday, I’m going to go ahead and offer up my thoughts and observations on it now. Consider these my ahead-of-Monday Musings, y’all.\n\nLet’s get to it.\n\nFirst Half\n\nCam Ward’s first pass was a completion to Xavier Restrepo on a comeback route. Do with that information what you will. It was a well thrown ball with zip and anticipation. Love to see that.\n\nA few plays later, he found X again, and 7 broke free from Jadais Richards’ attempted tackle for a huge gain inside the 10. Great individual effort by Restrepo. Not so much from Miami’s first-team corner.\n\nAnd the first score went to Isaiah Horton for a 5-yard touchdown. Drag across the field, Horton was wayyyyyyyyyyy in front of Darryl Porter, Jr. Walk in touchdown.\n\nReese Poffenbarger threw a dart on a deep crosser to TE Riley Williams. Perfect ball placement. Williams was flagged for a tackle of a defender on the next play that wiped out a nice run by Ray Ray Joseph. Whoops.\n\nRaul Aguirre, Jr. got a “sack” on third and long. He was one of the guys Mario talked about being a standout in spring practice.\n\nJoseph skied for a catch and held it while being upended. Not a huge gain, but an acrobatic catch and kept it through contact with the ground. Not bad.\n\nChase Smith forced a fumble by Emory Williams on first down, which eventually led to a punt three plays later after Williams missed a wide-open Michael Redding III for a first down.\n\nWard avoided a sack by flipping a nifty little toss to Elijah Lofton for a positive gain. That’s the kind of instincts you want to see from your QB.\n\nJacurri Brown was the fourth of four quarterbacks to see the field right before the end of the first quarter and he took off for a very long gain across the field. He capped that drive with a long backfoot lob to TE Jackson Carver for a touchdown. There’s been a lot of talk this week about Brown and the fourth quarterback spot. Well, Brown at least acquitted himself pretty well on Saturday, for whatever that’s worth.\n\nWard avoided pressure and threw a strike to Restrepo along the sideline. Like, he was running backwards and towards the sideline and threw it right on the money to X, who got a foot down. Probably his most impressive throw of the day. He hit X again later in the drive for a touchdown. A connection is in the works, it seems.\n\nPoffenbarger missed an open Joseph on an out route on 4th and 3. Gotta hit that pass.\n\nWesley Bissainthe tackled Lofton on 4th and 2, and he got up and went and told Ward all about it. Must have been some barking happening on the sideline. That wasn’t just a word or two. That was walking with him for a few seconds and yapping. Don’t tell these guys it’s just an exhibition.\n\nShemar Kirk broke free after pulling in a nice pass from Willliams and ran for a gain of around 63 yards. Marcellius Pulliam and Demetrius Freeney both had a shot at him, but he got away and took off across the field. Williams hit Joseph on a short crosser for a touchdown on 4th and 6.\n\nWard converted a 2nd and 20 with a nice throw, catch, and run to Jojo Trader. Man, #6 looks fast with the ball in his hands. Ward finished 17/23 for 260 yards with 2 touchdowns in the first half. I know the defense can’t really be that physical, but......bro. That’ll work. He’s looked very impressive thus far.\n\nPlenty of big plays with the score 17-14 at the break.\n\nSecond Half\n\nTreVonte’ Citizen (I think; the numbers on the jerseys today don’t all match up with the team’s online roster) coughed the ball up, and Savion Riley came up with the recovery. Ahmad Moten got a big paw in there and knocked it out. Hey, amid a big offensive day, the defense finally rose to the occasion.\n\nWard hooked up with Horton again for another chunk gain (not easy to get these yardage totals with no live box score). Horton has looked very good today.\n\nFreeney made up for the long Kirk catch with a pick six of QB Judd Anderson. He stayed on the receiver’s inside hip and jumped in front of a ball that should never have been thrown and took it back for the touchdown.\n\nKirk pulled in another long catch, this time from Brown. He looked over his inside shoulder into the sun and pulled it in. Ran right by Souleymane Bangoura and Brown’s throw was on the money.\n\nUnfortunately, a Brown botched handoff with Ny Carr ended up in a fumble that was recovered by Marquise Lightfoot. Defense was opportunistic in the second half with three takeaways.\n\nSo, there you have it. I thought the offense mostly won the day, especially in the first half. Ward was excellent, but I thought all four quarterbacks had encouraging moments. The defense was overall much better in the second half. Regardless, it’s pretty tough to fully evaluate the defense with very limited contact.\n\nWhat stood out to you all? Let’s hear it."
