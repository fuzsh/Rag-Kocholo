        "text": "Vision Test\n\nThe minimum level of acceptable vision for full driving privileges is 20/40.Â If a driver must wear glasses or contact lenses to meet this standard, Restriction B will be placed on the license.\n\nPersons who cannot meet this standard may be licensed to drive in daylight hours only, denied a license or required to submit a yearly examination depending on the nature of the vision problem.\n\nKnowledge (Written) Test\n\nThe Nevada knowledge test for a Class C, non-commercial license consists of 25 multiple-choice questions.\n\n80 percent or better is a passing score. The test will stop when you have reached 20 correct answers or six incorrect.\n\nThe knowledge test is available to take online at KnowToDrive Nevada. These results are transmitted to the DMV automatically for the purposes of issuing instruction permits or driver licenses. The test is available in both English and Spanish. Touch-screen devices are not compatible with the online exam - only computers with front-facing cameras or camera peripherals.\n\nKnowledge tests are also available in DMV offices on touch-screen computers in English and Spanish. The system also offers audio.\n\nOnline Practice Test\n\nSkills (Driving) Test\n\nYou must pass the knowledge test and obtain an instruction permit for a given class of license or endorsement before you schedule your skills test.\n\nSkills tests are administered by appointment. Rural offices do not offer stand-by tests. Not all DMV locations offer all tests.\n\nPlease have your instruction permit number or social security number ready when you call or schedule online. You must call to cancel a test.\n\nOnline Scheduling\n\nLas Vegas Area - (702) 486-4368\n\nReno/Sparks/Carson City - (775) 684-4368\n\nThe examiner will perform a safety inspection on your vehicle and check your registration and insurance. Vehicles must be properly registered and insured.\n\nYou do not have to use your own vehicle, but you must have a vehicle in the same license class as you are applying for. You may not use a rental car.\n\nMost beginning drivers under 18 must present a driver's education Certificate of Completion and a Beginning Driver Experience Log.\n\nSee Motorcycle Skills Test for a preview of the motorcycle course and test requirements.\n\nSee Commercial Drivers License to schedule a skills test for Class A or B, commercial Class C or Endorsements.\n\nPlease do not leave your children unattended while you take a skills test. Skills tests will be canceled if there is no responsible party available to supervise small children.\n\nInterpreters\n\nKnowledge (Written) Test\n\nAn applicant who has a lack of English or Spanish language skills may use an interpreter during a written examination for a non-commercial driverâs license, driver authorization card or instruction permit.\n\nInterpreters must attest that they are approved by a governmental agency, court, educational institution, or non-profit advocacy group by presenting a letter from the approving agency. This is submitted with an application (DMV 502). See DMV Approved Translators/Interpreters.\n\nAt each test, the interpreter must submit an Affidavit of Oath for Interpreters/Translators (DLD 11).\n\nThe applicant must bear any cost of the interpreterâs services. Interpreters may not provide services for family members.\n\nSkills (Drive) Test\n\nThe Department does not allow interpreters to be present during any drive test."
