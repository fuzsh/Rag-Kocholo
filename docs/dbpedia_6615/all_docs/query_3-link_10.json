        "text": "Quality of Life\n\nQuality of life encapsulates the wellbeing and satisfaction of a city’s residents, reflecting the intersection of various socioeconomic factors. This category provides insights into the liveability and attractiveness of a city, which can play a role in migration patterns, talent retention and the overall happiness of residents.\n\nHow we score and rank the 1,000 cities in the Quality of Life category\n\nIn the Quality of Life category we assess the benefits of living in each city and residents’ wellbeing, covering financial and health outcomes, as well as access to amenities. The indicators we use are:\n\nLife expectancy\n\nIncome per person\n\nIncome equality\n\nHousing expenditure\n\nRecreation & cultural sites\n\nInternet speed\n\nEnvironment\n\nWith climate change at the forefront of international, national, and urban policymaking, the relevance of this category is undeniable. The Environment category evaluates a city’s commitment to environmental sustainability and its predisposition to climate change risks; environmental sustainability is critical for ensuring long-term resilience.\n\nHow we score and rank the 1,000 cities in the Environment category\n\nIn the Environment category we assess the natural environment of each city on climate change-related issues. The indicators we use are:\n\nAir quality\n\nEmissions intensity\n\nNatural disasters\n\nTemperature anomalies\n\nRainfall anomalies\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance is the basic foundation for city prosperity across the other four categories. Good governance fosters trust, social cohesion, and equitable access to opportunities, while poor governance can lead to inefficiencies, corruption, and social unrest.\n\nScores in the Governance category are calculated at the national level rather than the city level, meaning that every city in a given country is given the same score for a given indicator.\n\nHow we score and rank the 1,000 cities in the Governance category\n\nIn the Governance category we assess measure the political stability of a city and the degree to which residents’ rights are protected. The indicators we use are:\n\nInstitutions\n\nPolitical stability\n\nBusiness environment\n\nCivil liberties"
