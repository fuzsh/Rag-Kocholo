The SAT is scored on a scale of 400 to 1600 and a 1600 is the best possible result. A score of 1100 indicates that you answered a slightly above average number of questions correctly on the exam.\n\nIs An 1100 SAT Score (58th Percentile) Good?\n\nA score of 1100 on the SAT puts you at the 58th percentile, meaning you scored higher than 58% all 2 million+ test takers. Earning an 1100 makes you eligible to apply to most colleges and universities as a decent candidate. More selective and elite institutions require higher scores for competitive consideration, but outside of those a score of 1100 meets (and 8% exceeds!) expectations.\n\nWhat Colleges Can I Get Into With an SAT Score of 1100?\n\nThere are a sizable number of colleges and universities where an SAT score of 1100 is competitive and we’ve assembled a list of them below. Remember no SAT score by itself guarantees admission, but all of these institutions have established a precedent of accepting students with scores of 1100.\n\nShould I Retake the SAT with an 1100 Score?\n\nReview your colleges and universities list and see what scores they accept most frequently. They often are provided in a 25th and 75th percentile. If the majority of the institutions on your list have an 1100 or near there as their 75th percentile, it means that you’re likely a good candidate for acceptance.\n\nIf your SAT score is closer to their 25th percentile or below, it would be worthwhile to retake the exam, especially if you’re still in your junior year. On average, students retaking the SAT improve their scores by 60-70 points, which would make your application more competitive, which is always a good thing.\n\nIf you’re going to retake the SAT, The College Board recommends six to eight weeks to prepare for taking the exam again. In that time, complete a few practice tests by obtaining a book of sample SATs or by visiting the free SAT practice website. If there’s enough time, sign up for a test prep class offered by your high school or hire a tutoring service specializing in SAT preparation.\n\nAs for seniors, now is the time to ensure that the rest of your application is as marketable as it can be. Because a score of 1100 provides many college options to choose from, a great personal essay or list of after school activities can be immensely helpful in getting accepted to your first choice. Set aside time to compose a persuasive essay and have your college counselor read it over to offer a critique. Also, reach out to the teachers who made an impact on your high school career and ask them to compose a letter of recommendation.\n\n1100 SAT to ACT Equivalent\n\nAn 1100 SAT score is equivalent to a 22 on the ACT. However, there are some key differences between these two tests, including in time management, tools used, and even content. If the SAT doesn’t seem to be working for your test-taking style, it may be worthwhile to take a practice ACT and see if the results are better for you.\n\nScholarships for a 1100 SAT Score\n\nScholarships that require a certain ACT or SAT score, or GPA, are referred to as “merit” scholarships. With an 1100 SAT score, you’ll likely be eligible for some merit aid, but you’ll also want to search for scholarships based on your extracurriculars, life circumstances, and passions! Use our extensive database to begin your search!\n\nView all scholarships\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs 1100 a good SAT score?\n\nWhen identifying a “good” score and a “not-so-good” score, we weigh it based on opportunity — an 1100 SAT score makes you a decent candidate at a variety of colleges. Under those guidelines, yes, an 1100 SAT is a good score.\n\nWhat colleges can I get into with a 1100 SAT score?\n\nA good number of colleges accept an 1100 SAT score. Among many other Target institutions, you can consider Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis, Washington State University, and Texas State University.\n\nWhat percentile is a 1100 SAT score?\n\nAn 1100 SAT falls in the 58th percentile, meaning that a score of 1100 is better than 58% of all other 2 million-odd test takers.\n\nWhat is the ACT equivalent of a 1100 SAT score?\n\nAn 1100 SAT score is equivalent to a 22 on the ACT. Keep in mind that there are a few key differences to these tests, so the score you earn on one test may not be the same score you earn on the other.\n\nWhat scholarships can you get with a 1100 SAT score?\n\nScholarships based on academic achievements, like the ACT, SAT, or GPA, are considered “merit” scholarships. An 1100 may make you eligible for some merit scholarships, but not all. On top of searching for merit aid, though, you should also search for scholarships based on your extracurriculars, life circumstances, and passions. You can get started using our extensive database and build up your nest egg to offset college tuition.\n\nView all scholarships\n\nFounded in 1890, Washington State University is the state's first land-grant university.
