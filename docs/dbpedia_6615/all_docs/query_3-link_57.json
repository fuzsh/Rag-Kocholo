        "text": "Joining the San Francisco family\n\nThe type of position that you apply for will determine which hiring process you go through.\n\nThe hiring process for exempt positions is not subject to civil service rules and is less formal than the path for Permanent Civil Service positions, but exempt roles afford fewer rights and protections to both applicants and employees. The main difference is an exempt application, usually, does not require an exam. The team hiring for an exempt role will set up a hiring process unique to that team, typically consisting of interviews.\n\nMost City jobs are Permanent Civil Service, or PCS, meaning that the hiring process is driven by Civil Service Rules, and candidates will have to take at least one form of exam. We have described the PCS hiring process below, from a high level, but each job or job class may have a slightly different process.\n\nAs a local government employee you will be part of a team that is responsible for protecting the health and well-being of the more than a million people that live and work in San Francisco. This may mean that you have access to sensitive information, public funds, or you may be directly involved in providing face-to-face citizen services. To protect the safety of our residents as well as fellow employees, you will be required to go through some final checks before you can start work.\n\nQualification verification: We are required to verify the information that you provided in your application. This process may involve providing us with your transcripts, diplomas, and certifications, as well a calling references from your previous employers.\n\nBackground checks: All employees must go through a background check. For most employees this involves taking fingerprints and requesting records from California and the FBI (LiveScan check). Under City ordinance, the records that are returned are compared to the individual requirements of the position, so simply having records does not directly disqualify you from employment with the city.\n\nCongratulations on making it to the onboarding step, we are so excited to have you join our team. While every department and team handles these last steps a little bit differently, there are a few things that we can tell you to prepare for your first day:\n\nHiring information: You will receive an automated email requesting some final pieces of information to help us get you onto payroll quickly. Please keep an eye on your inbox for this form and complete it as soon as possible.\n\nPrepping for your first day: The individual handling your onboarding will provide you with more information, but on your first day you should be prepared to fill out some forms related to tax witholding and getting paid. Be sure to bring two forms of ID to complete employment eligibility forms and a voided check if you wish to enroll in direct deposit."
