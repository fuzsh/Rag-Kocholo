However, our opinions are our own. See how we rate products and services to help you make smart decisions with your money.\n\nThe average credit score in the US is 717, according to a report from FICO.\n\nHigh interest rates and lingering inflation contribute to more missed payments and debt levels.\n\nMinnesota has the highest average credit score at 742, while Mississippi has the lowest average at 680.\n\nPeople with higher credit scores tend to qualify for better interest rates on borrowed money, have access to the best credit cards, and can even pay less for insurance. You'll also have an easier time applying for an apartment rental.\n\nWith so much riding on your credit score, it can be useful to see where you stand compared to others like you, whether it be where you live or how old you are. Here is the average credit score broken down across generations, state, and years.\n\nWhat is the average credit score?\n\nThe average FICO credit score in the US is 717, according to the latest FICO data. The average VantageScore is 701 as of January 2024.\n\nDefinition and explanation\n\nCredit scores, which are like a grade for your borrowing history, fall in the range of 300 to 850. The higher your score, the better.\n\nThe FICO model of credit scoring puts credit scores into six categories:\n\nVery poor: 300-579\n\nPoor: 580-600\n\nFair: 601-660\n\nGood: 670-739\n\nVery good: 740-799\n\nExceptional: 800-850\n\nBased on this scoring system, the average American has a good credit score. But, average credit scores varies by location and age.\n\nAverage credit score by age\n\nThe average credit score looks very different between age groups. As credit scores are calculated on credit and borrowing history, older people have higher credit scores on average due to a more extensive borrowing history.\n\nMeanwhile Gen Z lags behind because they've had less time to build credit, and many members of Gen Z simply aren't old enough to have a credit score. Here's how it breaks down by age group, according to data from Experian:\n\nAverage credit score by state\n\nFinances look very different across all 50 states, and the average credit score looks pretty different, too. While Mississippi has the lowest average credit score at 680, Minnesota has the highest credit score at 742. Here's the average credit score in each US state and the District of Columbia as of 2022, according to data from Experian:\n\nAverage credit score by year\n\nAmericans have more consumer debt than ever before, holding an average debt of $104,215 and a total of $17.50 trillion in 2023. Despite historic levels of debt, the average credit score continues to rise. Americans actually have better credit than ever.\n\nThe average score has increased by nearly 30 points in the past decade. Here's how it's risen, according to FICO data from April of each year:\n\nThe period spanning from June 2009 until early 2020 became America's longest-running period of economic expansion, which ended due to the brief, pandemic-induced recession. This extended period of growth yielded low unemployment rates. This could have contributed to America's rising credit scores, with more people possessing the means to pay back debt on time.\n\nIf your own score isn't rising, there is plenty of information available on the credit industry and how to raise your credit score. There is also an abundance of credit-builder products available that widen accessibility, boosting the average credit score over time. The best credit builder loans don't require a credit check or a credit score. Some credit builder products come straight from the credit bureaus themselves, such as Experian Boost, which reports regular payments like utility bills and streaming service subscription fees.\n\nThere have even been changes in how credit scores are calculated, which can further improve average credit scores. For example, paid collections under $500 have been removed from consumers' credit reports and are no longer reported. Changes to how medical debt affects your credit score have also improved consumers' credit histories.\n\nHow are credit scores used?\n\nCredit scores are calculated using information about your borrowing, like your credit utilization ratio, the number and types of accounts you have open, and your repayment history. All of that information is drawn from your credit report, which has a detailed borrowing history.\n\nEveryone has credit scores based on data gathered by the three major credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. There are two main credit scoring algorithms, known as FICO and VantageScore. While each one uses a slightly different calculation, your scores should generally be within a similar range.\n\nCredit scores are used to determine approval for financial products like mortgages, credit cards, and personal loans. Interest rates and loan terms will be assessed based on your credit score and payment history. Credit scores are even used for apartment rentals, car insurance, and, in some cases, employment.\n\nKeeping track of these scores is crucial if you want to build credit. You should never be paying to view your credit score. You can usually access your scores for free through your lender or financial institution. You can also access your credit score free online from sites like Credit Karma.\n\nIt's a good idea to check your credit report regularly, too. You can get three annual reports, one from each credit bureau, which you can access through AnnualCreditReport.com. It's not uncommon for a report to contain an error affecting your score, but it's up to you to find any such error. If you do find one, you can dispute your credit report with the agency.\n\nFactors influencing the average credit score\n\nPayment history\n\nThis is the most important factor and has the biggest impact on your score. A positive payment history is best; even one late or missed payment can negatively impact your score. Be sure to make all payments on time.\n\nCredit utilization\n\nThis is the amount of your available credit that you're using. Keeping your available credit high and your debts low can help your score.\n\nCredit mix\n\nThis refers to your different loan accounts, such as credit cards, mortgages, student loans, and car loans. Being able to handle a mix of different credit accounts can positively impact your credit score.\n\nLength of credit history\n\nThe length of time you've had credit can also impact your score. The longer you have had positive credit history the better it is for your score.\n\nHow to strengthen your credit score\n\nYour credit scores play a big role in your financial freedom. It figures into everything from qualifying for a mortgage or credit card to the rate you pay on your auto insurance. Bad credit can make your life difficult. But there are always things you can do to improve your credit score, including:\n\nMaking all your loan, credit card, and other monthly payments on time is essential\n\nPay off debts and bring past due accounts current\n\nPay your credit card balances in full each month\n\nAvoid applying for new credit unless you really need it\n\nKeep unused credit accounts open\n\nIf you don't have any credit history, it becomes challenging to borrow, making it hard to build a credit history. That's why some credit card issuers provide specific secured credit cards for people to use temporarily to build credit from scratch. You can also see our picks for the best starter credit cards here.\n\nYou can also use a credit-builder product, like a debit card that reports payments to the credit bureaus or a credit-builder loan, to build a credit history. The best credit builder loans don't require a credit history, so you can qualify even if you've never borrowed money before.\n\nYou can subscribe to a credit monitoring service to help you keep track of your progress. The best credit monitoring services are even free.\n\nFrequently asked questions about average credit scores"
