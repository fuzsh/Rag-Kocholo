        "text": "Oregon Corrections Enterprises (OCE) Industries:\n\nContact Center\n\nEmbroidery Shop\n\nGarment Factory\n\nLaundry\n\nPlease contact the institution for a full list of programs and services.\n\nAbout the Facility:\n\n​Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution (EOCI) was authorized in 1983 by the 62nd Legislative Assembly as the first medium-security adult male correctional facility established outside Marion County. Until its conversion to a prison, EOCI had been a state mental hospital, with most of the buildings originally constructed in 1912-13. The first adults in custody were received on June 24, 1985. The 1682-bed facility is Pendleton´s fourth largest employer.\n\nThe institution has 19 separate general population housing units, comprised of 596 dormitory structured beds and 897 cell-structured beds, a 99-single occupancy cell Disciplinary Segregation Unit, and an eight bed Infirmary.\n\nEOCI contracts with Blue Mountain Community College (BMCC) to provide education services at the institution. Approximately 1,000 AICs have received either a GED certificate or an adult high school diploma since the education program began in 1986.\n\nNew Directions Education Project was formed in 1999 by a group of people who felt that individuals should have more than a GED to start their lives upon release. Donations were sought from churches, civic groups, individuals and eventually from foundations to pay for tuition, textbooks, and supplies so that BMCC would provide instructors to teach college-transfer classes at EOCI.\n\nEOCI is the state´s only facility where the internationally-recognized \"Prison Blues\" line of blue denim clothing is manufactured. The garment factory is one of two prison industries programs operating at the facility. The prison´s commercial laundry cleans clothing and other items for EOCI and Snake River Correctional Institution, in addition to Pendleton´s local high school, the city´s fire department, the Pendleton Convention Center, and Krusteaz Flour Mill.\n\nPlease contact the institution for a full list of programs and services.​\n\nAbout the Facility:\n\n​Santiam Correctional Institution (SCI) was constructed in 1946 and used as an annex to the Oregon State Hospital for mental health patients. In 1960 the building was acquired by Fairview Home and given the name Frederic Prigg Cottage.\n\nIn 1977 Prigg Cottage opened as a minimum custody pre-release center to ease overcrowded conditions at Oregon State Penitentiary, Oregon State Correctional Institution and Oregon Women's Correctional Center. During the 1980's, Prigg Cottage evolved into Corrections Division Release Center, the Department of Corrections Release Center, and finally, in 1990 became SCI. For efficiency SCI and Mill Creek Correctional Facility were administratively joined in 1992 under the management of one superintendent.\n\nThe institution places individuals in a full range of jobs and programs. Many of the labor-type jobs are in the form of crews contracting with state agencies, local organizations, and private industry within a 60-mile radius of Salem, Oregon. A variety of cognitive, substance abuse, transition and education programs are available to AICs housed at SCI. The prison complex sits on a 12-acre parcel with nine acres inside the perimeter fence."
