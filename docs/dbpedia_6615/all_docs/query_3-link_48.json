Heavy rains, poor drainage, and even nearby construction projects can put you at risk for flood damage.\n\nFlood maps are one tool that communities use to know which areas have the highest risk of flooding. FEMA maintains and updates data through flood maps and risk assessments.\n\nFloods don’t follow city limits or property lines. Using a flood map, you can see the relationship between your property and the areas with the highest risk of flooding. There is no such thing as a “no-risk zone,” but some areas have a lower or moderate risk.\n\nHow to View and Obtain Flood Maps\n\nChange Your Flood Zone Designation\n\nOnce the data analysis is done, preliminary flood maps will be available for review. Before your community decides to adopt the maps, you have 90 days to submit technical data to support an appeal to the map.\n\nAny time after your community adopts the maps, you can submit data to amend or revise the flood map through the Letter of Map Change (LOMC) process.\n\nProducts and Tools\n\nGuidance and Partners\n\nManage Risk\n\nContact Us\n\nFor additional information or assistance, contact a Map Specialist in the FEMA Mapping and Insurance eXchange (FMIX)."
