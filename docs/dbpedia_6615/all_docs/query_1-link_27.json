        "text": "Score At The Top Learning Centers & Schools have been family owned and operated since 1980, when Judi Robinovitz, Certified Educational Planner, started the company in New Jersey. Capitalizing on her background as a passionate student at the top of her class, and on her professional experience at Educational Testing Service (the company that created the SAT for the College Board), Judi provided 1-on-1 academic tutoring, SAT prep, and college counseling services to high-school students. When the demand for her services quickly exceeded the capacity of her home office, she hired and trained additional tutors to help prepare students for the SAT and tutor them in academic subjects. Judi actually started her tutoring career as a high-school student, tutoring her peers in advanced math courses. (She’s a self-proclaimed math nerd!)\n\nWhen Judi moved to Florida in 1992, with the encouragement of her husband Alan, she opened the first physical Score At The Top Learning Center in Vero Beach. The center was designed to provide students and their families with academic support and guidance beyond what was available in local schools.\n\nLured by Boca Raton families whose children drove up to Vero Beach to meet with Judi and her staff, Judi and Alan opened a second Score At The Top Learning Center in Boca Raton in 1996. Word-of-mouth rapidly spread about the success of Score At The Top students, and the Boca Raton center quickly grew from a handful of tutors in a 1,000-square foot Learning Center to 25+ tutors in its current space of over 6,000 square feet – in Boca Raton’s first LEED gold-certified green building!\n\nWhen Judi moved to northern Palm Beach County in 2000, her tutors from Boca Raton and Vero Beach traveled there to tutor students in their homes. Judi also hired and trained several local professionals to provide quality tutoring and test-prep services to these north-county students. Within a year, Judi and Alan solidified their physical presence in Palm Beach Gardens by opening their third Score At The Top Learning Center. Like the previous facilities, the Palm Beach Gardens center has continued to flourish – attracting students from all over northern Palm Beach, Martin, Saint Lucie, and Indian River counties, and adding more than 40 professionals to the tutoring staff.\n\nThree years later, Judi and Alan sold the original center in Vero Beach in order to open another Score At The Top Learning Center in Wellington to support the increasing demand for tutoring and guidance services from families both nearby and from as far away as Orlando and Tampa. In addition to providing academic services to hundreds of student living in these areas, the Wellington center provides a complete 1-on-1 education for students from all over the country who spend the winter months competing at Wellington’s international Winter Equestrian Festival (W.E.F.).\n\nAt the urging of many of our Broward County families, we opened Score At The Top Learning Center in Coral Springs/Parkland in 2007. Shortly thereafter, Jason Robinovitz joined his parents in the family business. After practicing law for five years, Jason decided to follow in his parents’ entrepreneurial footsteps as both the Director of the Coral Springs/Parkland center and the Chief Operating Officer of the company. Jason expanded Score At The Top’s reach in Broward County by opening a satellite center in Weston in the summer of 2010. That same year we opened a satellite center in West Palm Beach to serve the growing needs of our families in northern Palm Beach County.\n\nThrough Jason’s insight and technological savvy, Score At The Top began offering virtual tutoring services to students from all over the world. Jason plans to continue the company’s growth by opening additional centers in Florida and other states.\n\nAll Score At The Top Learning Centers are accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement (SACS CASI) and AdvancED. Accreditation reflects our commitment to continuous improvement and expansion of services to include an accredited ONE-on-ONEprivate-school education in an individualized environment substantially different from that of a traditional classroom – thus our name change from Score At The Top Learning Centers to Score At The Top Learning Centers and Schools. As accredited schools, we enroll students in grades K through 12 on a rolling basis throughout the year, offer summer school at all grade levels, and individual courses for credit throughout the year for students who want to enhance their curriculum or improve their GPA. We are proud of the fact that virtually all Score At The Top graduates have continued their education in 4-year Florida and out-of-state universities.\n\nWe hope you’ll send your child to us to score at the top of his or her potential!\n\nScore At The Top has become a vital presence in the communities we serve by providing specialized programs in local schools for students, parents, and teachers:\n\nCollege Admissions Camp\n\nBoca Raton Community High School (every summer since 2004)\n\nSuncoast\n\nWellington\n\nTest-Taking Strategy Workshop for the PSAT/SAT or ACT\n\nBoca Raton Community High School\n\nDonna Klein Jewish Academy\n\nFAU High School\n\nG-Star School of the Arts\n\nJupiter Christian School\n\nNorth Broward Preparatory School\n\nOlympic Heights High School\n\nSpanish River High School\n\nWeinbaum Yeshiva High School\n\nWellington Christian School\n\nDuke Talent Search SAT Workshop\n\nArthur I.
