        "text": "Cities A List 2023\n\n120 cities, stretching from Canada to the Philippines, have been named as global leaders in environmental action, ambition and transparency on CDP’s annual cities A List.\n\nThe A List, which was started by CDP in 2018, recognizes cities that have received the highest score for their transparency and bold climate action, and celebrates their achievements, vision and commitment in the fight against climate change.\n\nMany cities are building on the momentum in their environmental action, making it mainstream to their operations. This is reflected in the growing number of cities that are consistently receiving an ‘A’, despite the tightening criteria to achieve this. This is particularly noticeable in the Global South, with cities in Ecuador, Peru and Jordan receiving their second ever A; cities in Chile and Malaysia receiving their third A; and cities in Argentina and South Africa receiving their sixth A.\n\nWhat is an A List city?\n\nTo score an A, among other actions, a city must:\n\ndisclose publicly through CDP-ICLEI Track;\n\nhave a city-wide emissions inventory; and\n\nhave published a climate action plan.\n\nThe scoring criteria for emissions reduction targets have been strengthened in a move towards aligning with science-based climate targets. An A List city must also complete a climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) and have a climate adaptation goal to demonstrate how it will adapt to climate hazards.\n\nCity climate leadership in action\n\nThis year, 939 cities reporting through CDP-ICLEI Track were scored by CDP, with 13% receiving an A. These cities are demonstrating their climate leadership through concerted and effective action, as they report taking four times as many mitigation and adaptation measures as non-A List cities.\n\nFor example, CDP analysis shows that renewable energy use is rising among A List cities, with some cities such as San Francisco (84%), Quito (86%) and Trondheim (91%) reporting that renewable energy makes up the vast majority of their energy consumption.\n\nYou can read more examples of A List action in our press release."
