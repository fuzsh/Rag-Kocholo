        "text": "Judi Robinovitz is a Certified Educational Planner with more than 30 years of experience in education. Specializing in educational counseling, she is the author of numerous books, articles, and software on test preparation and college planning. Robinovitz has been a featured speaker at national educational conferences and schools. To keep pace with current educational trends, Robinovitz continually travels across America to assess colleges, boarding schools, and therapeutic boarding schools and wilderness programs.\n\nDuring her tenure at Educational Testing Service, Robinovitz served as technical liaison to the College Board, the Law School Admission Council, and the Graduate Record Examination Board. She spearheaded the College Board's SAT prep software and made major contributions to their test preparation books. Frequently taking the SAT, Robinovitz scored a perfect 1600 multiple times.\n\nConsulting to two private schools in Boca Raton, Yeshiva High School and Donna Klein Jewish Academy, Robinovitz created their college guidance programs and served as Director of College Guidance to the first five graduating classes of each school.\n\nAs an active member of the Independent Educational Consultants Association, the National Association for College Admission Counseling, and the Secondary School Admission Test Board, Robinovitz is part of a professional network of admission directors, educators, psychologists and other educational consultants. She is also a member of the National Learning Disabilities Association and the Orton Dyslexia Society.\n\nRobinovitz studied at Harvard University, Rutgers University, and the University of Connecticut. She holds graduate and undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science, both with highest honors. She is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nJason Robinovitz, the Chief Operating Officer of all Score At The Top Learning Centers, oversees each Center’s day-to-day operations, ensuring the delivery of top quality educational support and guidance services to client families. As team leader for our staff of more than 100 educators, Jason is in charge of strategic decision-making, including best practice policies, customer service, staffing, training, marketing, systems, and technology.\n\nJason is also involved in educational consulting services for college, boarding school, and law school clients. Meeting with students, Jason specializes in directing pre-law and future law-school students toward the extracurricular activities that will help position them for success. Skillfully guiding them through the application and essay process, Jason helps students distinguish themselves from the rest of the applicant pool. He also works with families seeking therapeutic placements for their children, identifying the “best fit” schools and programs for them and interfacing with these schools and programs to ensure successful placements.\n\nAs an active member of the Independent Educational Consultants Association, the National Association for College Admission Counseling, and the Secondary School Admission Test Board, Robinovitz is part of a professional network of admission directors, educators, psychologists and other educational consultants. Additionally, Robinovitz is a founding member of the National Test Prep Association, the first non-profit industry group for test prep professional nationwide.\n\nJason graduated from the University of Denver with a BSBA in Finance and concentrations in Real Estate and Leadership. Three years later, he graduated from Emory University School of Law with a concentration in business and corporate law. Jason practiced medical malpractice law for five years before joining Score At The Top. He is a member of the Florida Bar.\n\nJason is the son of Judi Robinovitz, founding owner of Score At The Top Learning Centers.\n\nNatalina Maiorino is the Controller for all Score at the Top/Score Academy locations. She has over 25 years experience in the accounting field, having worked in the transportation, law, and construction industries. But working at Score has been her most challenging and rewarding by far. She has applied her expertise to streamlining procedures and processes, and to identifying cost reductions that ensure optimal operations at each Score center\n\nWhen, Score At The Top adopted LearnSpeed (LS), a web-based educational service software application, Natalina became the go-to person. Much to her credit, the software developers at LearnSpeed have come to rely on Natalina for incisive critique and suggestions “from the trenches.” A truly sweet, symbiotic relationship. Score Chief Operating Officer Jason considers Nat his right-hand woman in all matters pertaining to the comprehensive software tool. She also assists Jason with general Operations, Human Resources, management training, and, of course LearnSpeed training for new tutors and teachers: she’s the LS Guru!\n\nNatalina is a first-generation Canadian of Italian descent. She grew up speaking Italian at home, English in school, and French (Québécois) around her neighborhood. Score’s polyglot has a smile that brightens the hallways wherever you find her! Natalina relocated with her husband to the Sunshine State from chilly Canada and has never looked back. She loves wearing open toed shoes year round, having left windshield scraping behind, north of the border. Now, it’s the salt life near the beach, in view of the ocean.\n\nOur Nat holds a Bachelor Degree in Accounting from FAU, and a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from Western Governors University.\n\nKathy, the director of our Palm Beach Gardens Learning Center, brings an eclectic mix of experiences to the position. Having grown up an army brat with typical family moves from posting to posting, she easily acquired the ability to quickly make anyone feel comfortable and at home.\n\nHer family eventually put down roots in Alabama where Kathy attended the flagship state university University of Alabama (Roll Tide!). She graduated in 1997 with a BS in Human Environmental Sciences and a concentration in Child Development. She has put this degree into practice in her own life: Kathy has homeschooled her two children for over a decade. Immersed at home in her children's education, Kathy understands the effort that goes into creating an engaging, successful education milieu. To the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and to the challenges of college applications and testing, she adds a wealth of personal knowledge and experience as both educator and parent. She has applied these skills in other domains, too: she and her husband held the position of Student Ministers at their church for many years. In that role, Kathy helped teens and their parents navigate the sometimes rough and stressful waters of adolescence.\n\nToday, drawing heavily on her years of tutoring at Score At The Top, Kathy can put together an educational plan that best meets a student’s academic needs – from struggling learners and children on the spectrum to accelerated and gifted students.\n\nWhether you're seeking tutoring, test prep, or a course for credit, Kathy will be the one to coordinate the process. With her depth of experience, Kathy oversees all support services in our Learning Center; collaborates with our Head of School when families have an interest in enrolling their students in our private school; and works with homeschooling families in curriculum design, course scheduling, and enrichment planning. In all aspects of her work, she regularly discusses the most effective teaching techniques, materials, and creativity applied to learning. Kathy also stays in close touch with local schools, setting up test-prep workshops and college-planning seminars on their campuses, and organizing AP review sessions, summer-school classes, and courses for academic credit.\n\nYou’ll enjoy your partnership with Kathy; she promotes educational performance, helping all students to “learn to love to learn.” Her passion for education is contagious!\n\nLaura Hall, a seasoned educator with a focus on individualized learning, serves as the Learning Center Director in Wellington. Originally from Florida, she holds a Bachelor of Science in International Affairs from Florida State University and a Master of Education from Florida Atlantic University. Laura also engaged in education policy advocacy in Washington DC during her academic career.\n\nPrior to joining Score At The Top, Laura specialized in higher education, specifically in the areas of student affairs and admissions counseling. Her pivot to K-12 education is anchored by her commitment to personalized learning, a philosophy that aligns seamlessly with the core values of Score At The Top. She views education as an enduring asset that withstands the challenges of time and circumstance, an ethos that informs her leadership approach at Score Academy Wellington.\n\nWithin the Score At The Top framework, Laura collaborates closely with educators, parents, and students to deliver exceptional educational and support services. She is relentless in her focus on helping students reach their academic objectives without compromise, regardless of individual goals or life situations.\n\nOutside of her professional life, Laura maintains an active lifestyle that includes biking, running, and beach activities. She is a devoted dog owner to Lola, a Labrador Retriever, and Bindi, a Miniature Australian Shepherd. Her background as a competitive high school tennis player gives her unique insight into the demands faced by student-athletes. Laura eagerly embraces her role at Score Academy and looks forward to contributing to the educational journey of students in the Wellington community.\n\nBorn and raised in South Florida, Celine Badal grew up a few miles from our Coral Springs location. She attended University of Central Florida, graduating with a Bachelor’s in Communication Sciences and Disorders and a minor in Psychology. While attending UCF, Celine was a member of the Mental Health Association of Central Florida and volunteered to assist stroke patients with aphasia.\n\nAfter college, Celine worked with individuals with autism and tutored students with cognitive, speech, and developmental disabilities. The importance of education was instilled in her from a young age, and she owes her academic success to her parents who constantly reminded her that education and knowledge are personal assets which no one could ever take away. This generated a passion for working with children and continually seeking opportunities to help students find and grow into their best selves.\n\nCeline motivates and supports students so that they understand the importance of curiosity, education and academic growth. Her most recent experience to date involved working with K-12 students in Title I schools in Broward, Palm Beach, and Miami-Dade counties into which she integrated her interests and passion by overseeing academic enrichment programs for hundreds of students. She provided ongoing professional development as well as parental engagement workshops.\n\nA second-generation Trinidadian, Celine comes from a close-knit, but rather large family. She enjoys cooking, spending time with family and friends, and travelling. She has recently been accepted into Florida Atlantic University’s Master’s Degree Program in Educational Psychology. Celine is excited to be part of the Score Family and looks forward to further expanding our Coral Springs location.\n\nAs personal assistant to Judi Robinovitz, Leslie brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to her position at Score At The Top. Raised in New York City, she attended Boston University and earned her BS in Communications with a specialty in Public Relations. Leslie worked in the entertainment industry as a publicist for the music business prior to becoming an executive in her family's business, Beverly Storage Co/ArtPack International, specialists in international logistics. Her company's clientele included four U.S. Presidents, six Governors and countless celebrities. In 1997, Leslie relocated with her husband & daughter to Boca Raton, where she worked as assistant librarian for the American Heritage School of Boca/Delray.\n\nAs a former client who successfully used the college-planning, SAT-prep, and academic-support services available at Score At The Top Learning Center for her daughter, Leslie brings a unique perspective to her position. This, combined with her knowledge of the educational landscape and her ability to engage clients, has made her a great asset. Often Leslie is the first contact clients have with Score At The Top, and they have found her to be a warm, welcoming and professional presence, helping them to understand the benefits of relying on Score At The Top for all of their children’s academic needs."
