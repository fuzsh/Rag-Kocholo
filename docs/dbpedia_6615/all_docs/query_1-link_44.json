        "text": "Judi Robinovitz is a Certified Educational Planner with more than 30 years of experience in education. Specializing in educational counseling, she is the author of numerous books, articles, and software on test preparation and college planning. Robinovitz has been a featured speaker at national educational conferences and schools. To keep pace with current educational trends, Robinovitz continually travels across America to assess colleges, boarding schools, and therapeutic boarding schools and wilderness programs.\n\nDuring her tenure at Educational Testing Service, Robinovitz served as technical liaison to the College Board, the Law School Admission Council, and the Graduate Record Examination Board. She spearheaded the College Board's SAT prep software and made major contributions to their test preparation books. Frequently taking the SAT, Robinovitz scored a perfect 1600 multiple times.\n\nConsulting to two private schools in Boca Raton, Yeshiva High School and Donna Klein Jewish Academy, Robinovitz created their college guidance programs and served as Director of College Guidance to the first five graduating classes of each school.\n\nAs an active member of the Independent Educational Consultants Association, the National Association for College Admission Counseling, and the Secondary School Admission Test Board, Robinovitz is part of a professional network of admission directors, educators, psychologists and other educational consultants. She is also a member of the National Learning Disabilities Association and the Orton Dyslexia Society.\n\nRobinovitz studied at Harvard University, Rutgers University, and the University of Connecticut. She holds graduate and undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science, both with highest honors. She is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nJason Robinovitz, the Chief Operating Officer of all Score At The Top Learning Centers, oversees each Center’s day-to-day operations, ensuring the delivery of top quality educational support and guidance services to client families. As team leader for our staff of more than 100 educators, Jason is in charge of strategic decision-making, including best practice policies, customer service, staffing, training, marketing, systems, and technology.\n\nJason is also involved in educational consulting services for college, boarding school, and law school clients. Meeting with students, Jason specializes in directing pre-law and future law-school students toward the extracurricular activities that will help position them for success. Skillfully guiding them through the application and essay process, Jason helps students distinguish themselves from the rest of the applicant pool. He also works with families seeking therapeutic placements for their children, identifying the “best fit” schools and programs for them and interfacing with these schools and programs to ensure successful placements.\n\nAs an active member of the Independent Educational Consultants Association, the National Association for College Admission Counseling, and the Secondary School Admission Test Board, Robinovitz is part of a professional network of admission directors, educators, psychologists and other educational consultants. Additionally, Robinovitz is a founding member of the National Test Prep Association, the first non-profit industry group for test prep professional nationwide.\n\nJason graduated from the University of Denver with a BSBA in Finance and concentrations in Real Estate and Leadership. Three years later, he graduated from Emory University School of Law with a concentration in business and corporate law. Jason practiced medical malpractice law for five years before joining Score At The Top. He is a member of the Florida Bar.\n\nJason is the son of Judi Robinovitz, founding owner of Score At The Top Learning Centers.\n\nNatalina Maiorino is the Controller for all Score at the Top/Score Academy locations. She has over 25 years experience in the accounting field, having worked in the transportation, law, and construction industries. But working at Score has been her most challenging and rewarding by far. She has applied her expertise to streamlining procedures and processes, and to identifying cost reductions that ensure optimal operations at each Score center\n\nWhen, Score At The Top adopted LearnSpeed (LS), a web-based educational service software application, Natalina became the go-to person. Much to her credit, the software developers at LearnSpeed have come to rely on Natalina for incisive critique and suggestions “from the trenches.” A truly sweet, symbiotic relationship. Score Chief Operating Officer Jason considers Nat his right-hand woman in all matters pertaining to the comprehensive software tool. She also assists Jason with general Operations, Human Resources, management training, and, of course LearnSpeed training for new tutors and teachers: she’s the LS Guru!\n\nNatalina is a first-generation Canadian of Italian descent. She grew up speaking Italian at home, English in school, and French (Québécois) around her neighborhood. Score’s polyglot has a smile that brightens the hallways wherever you find her! Natalina relocated with her husband to the Sunshine State from chilly Canada and has never looked back. She loves wearing open toed shoes year round, having left windshield scraping behind, north of the border. Now, it’s the salt life near the beach, in view of the ocean.\n\nOur Nat holds a Bachelor Degree in Accounting from FAU, and a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from Western Governors University.\n\nLeAnn Elder is the Head of School in our Boca Raton location. She is a licensed architect with an extensive educational background – a B.S. from The University of Virginia and a Master's in Architecture from Harvard University. She studied abroad in Vicenza, Italy, while at UVA. At both UVA and Harvard, LeAnn was chosen for a variety of Teaching Assistantships, including a unique opportunity to teach an architecture program to middle school girls. As a result, she went on to design and teach a summer architecture program for high school students while attending Harvard. Her passion for teaching led to community service projects, which included introducing inner-city children to architecture with the help of the Baltimore City Arts Council. Since arriving in Florida, she has taught at FAU, and has passed her Florida teaching exams for all middle school subjects, high school math, technology, and health.\n\nAs an architect, LeAnn designed a house that was featured in a magazine (an extraordinary, contemporary design, one into which the Robinovitz family could easily move!) and has worked for firms in both Maryland and Florida. Her background in architecture accounts for her attention to detail and ability to make certain that disparate pieces come together to form a unified whole, no matter what the scale.\n\nBeyond her own lifelong commitment to education and extracurricular activities, including her current interests in playing the piano and lifting weights, she is a mother of two who loves mentoring her own children. They love to learn, play the piano and swim competitively on a swim team. Motherhood for LeAnn brought a shift of emphasis from the computer-dominated world of architecture to those qualities that touched on what she was truly passionate about – education and children.\n\nLeAnn came to Score Academy with an enthusiasm to succeed and a strong belief in our mission. She was originally hired as the Center Director and Head of School but after 4 years of extraordinary success and growth, she now concentrates solely on Score Academy. She is extremely passionate about our school and leads all of our full-time enrolled students and part-time course for credit students. LeAnn’s position as Head of School has allowed her to fully optimize her strong and enthusiastic commitment to growing and further developing Score Academy and helping to reach as many students as possible. LeAnn oversees all of our professional teaching staff, working collaboratively with our parents, students, and teachers to ensure top-quality educational and support services for our students and their families.\n\nRobin attended Vanderbilt University's Peabody College of Education, receiving undergraduate and graduate degrees there. She then moved to New York City and began teaching at a 6-12 school in the South Bronx. After 3 years, she came to her senses and moved back to Florida, where, since 2006, she has worked in the Palm Beach County public schools as a teacher, professional development and curriculum specialist, and school administrator. She has dedicated her life's work to identifying students’ strengths, and utilizing community-based and school resources to meet their needs and help them find a pathway to success. She has worked with every grade level, from 4-year-old VPK children to high school graduates; from students and families in need of safety and security first, to the top students at Suncoast High School. From each experience Robin learned that the one-size-fits-all model does not meet current student needs in today’s global economy.\n\nRobin is a wife and mother of two. Parenting has given Robin an even deeper understanding of how important her role is as Head of School. When it comes to serving her families, no request is too small, no worry too insignificant – if it matters to you, it matters to Robin. She believes that it’s an honor and a privilege to be entrusted with your child's well-being and educational success every day. She treats every child as her own. Robin is excited to be at Score Academy and working with the unique and special students and families of the Palm Beach Gardens area.\n\nLaura Hall, a Florida native, serves as the Head of School at Score Academy Wellington. Her academic journey began at Florida State University, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in International Affairs. She further honed her passion for education at Florida Atlantic University, completing a Master of Education. During her time at Florida State, Laura took her advocacy to Washington DC, applying her efforts towards education policy reform on Capitol Hill.\n\nBefore stepping into her current role, Laura's career was focused in higher education, including student affairs and admissions counseling. Her transition to K-12 education was fueled by a lifelong commitment to student personalized learning, a value instilled in her from a young age. Laura believes that education is a personal asset that remains unyielding against time and circumstance. This foundational belief has shaped her leadership at Score Academy Wellington.\n\nLaura's philosophy for the school is deeply rooted in inclusivity and individualized learning. She works collaboratively with parents, students, and teachers to ensure top-quality educational and support services. Laura places emphasis on ensuring that no student has to compromise on their academic goals, regardless of their unique pursuits or circumstances.\n\nOutside of school, Laura is a proud dog mom to a Labrador Retriever, Lola, and a Miniature Australian Shepherd, Bindi. As a former competitive high school tennis player, she understands the pressures student-athletes face. In her free time, she enjoys biking, running, and beach outings. Laura is excited to be a part of the Score Academy team and working with parents and students in the Wellington community.\n\nBorn and raised in South Florida, Celine Badal grew up a few miles from our Coral Springs location. She attended University of Central Florida, graduating with a Bachelor’s in Communication Sciences and Disorders and a minor in Psychology. While attending UCF, Celine was a member of the Mental Health Association of Central Florida and volunteered to assist stroke patients with aphasia.\n\nAfter college, Celine worked with individuals with autism and tutored students with cognitive, speech, and developmental disabilities. The importance of education was instilled in her from a young age, and she owes her academic success to her parents who constantly reminded her that education and knowledge are personal assets which no one could ever take away. This generated a passion for working with children and continually seeking opportunities to help students find and grow into their best selves.\n\nCeline motivates and supports students so that they understand the importance of curiosity, education and academic growth. Her most recent experience to date involved working with K-12 students in Title I schools in Broward, Palm Beach, and Miami-Dade counties into which she integrated her interests and passion by overseeing academic enrichment programs for hundreds of students. She provided ongoing professional development as well as parental engagement workshops.\n\nA second-generation Trinidadian, Celine comes from a close-knit, but rather large family. She enjoys cooking, spending time with family and friends, and travelling. She has recently been accepted into Florida Atlantic University’s Master’s Degree Program in Educational Psychology. Celine is excited to be part of the Score Family and looks forward to further expanding our Coral Springs location."
