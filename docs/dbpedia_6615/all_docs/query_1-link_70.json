        "text": "STANFORD, Calif. – The 2023 national runner-up, Stanford will prepare for the 2024 season with an exhibition match against San Jose State on Friday at 6:30 p.m. The Cardinal enters the season ranked No. 2 in the nation according to United Soccer Coaches.\n\nThe 2024 season will be Paul Ratcliffe’s 22nd at the helm of the program, as he leads the Cardinal into its inaugural year playing in the ACC. In 21 seasons as head coach, the Stanford women have won three national championships, reached six NCAA finals, won 10 Pac-12 titles, played in 10 College Cups, and reached the NCAA third round in 14 of the past 18 seasons. The Cardinal has advanced to the College Cup in 10 of the last 16 years.\n\nStanford returns 20 players from last year’s squad, including 37 of its 54 goals. The Cardinal averaged 2.16 goals per game to rank second in the Pac-12, while also posting 13 shutouts and limiting opponents to just .595 goals against to lead the conference and rank 14th nationally.\n\nThe Cardinal finished 2023 with a 20-1-4 overall record and posted an 8-0-3 mark in its final season in the Pac-12 Conference. Current junior Jasmine Aikey was named 2023 Pac-12 Midfielder of the Year, highlighting a group of 10 Cardinal on All-Pac-12 teams. Of those 10 All-Conference selections, seven return for the 2024 season. The Cardinal matched a national-high with four players on the 2023 United Soccer Coaches All-Pacific Region first team, with Aikey and fellow junior Elise Evans being lauded.\n\nTurning in a spectacular sophomore season, Aikey was a semifinalist for the MAC Hermann Trophy and a finalist for the Honda Award. She also earned her first All-America selection, claiming first-team honors, while Evans placed on the third team.\n\nSan Jose State finished the 2023 season at 3-10-6, including 1-7-3 in the Mountain West Conference. Senior Kennedy Mayo enters her senior season after garnering a spot on the Mountain West Conference All-Newcomer Team a year ago. Mayo started 10 conference matches and scored a pair of goals with two assists in conference play. Head Coach Tina Estrada is in her eighth season as part of the Spartan women’s soccer program, including her third at the helm.\n\nFollowing the exhibition match, Stanford will officially open the 2024 season at San Francisco on Thursday, August 15. The clash with the Dons is set for 6 p.m. and will be streamed live on ESPN+."
