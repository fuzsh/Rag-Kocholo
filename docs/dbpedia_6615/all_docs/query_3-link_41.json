        "text": "The government limits competition for certain contracts to businesses in historically underutilized business zones. It also gives preferential consideration to those businesses in full and open competition.\n\nJoining the HUBZone program makes your business eligible to compete for the program’s set-aside contracts. HUBZone-certified businesses also get a 10% price evaluation preference in full and open contract competitions.\n\nHUBZone-certified businesses can still compete for contract awards under other socio-economic programs they qualify for.\n\nThe HUBZone map changed on July 1, 2023. Check the new HUBZone map now to determine whether your principal office and employees are located in a HUBZone. Your firm’s eligibility to participate in the program might be impacted if your principal office is located, or your employees reside, in an area that no longer qualifies as a HUBZone. Learn how to navigate the updated HUBZone map.\n\nEvery five years the HUBZone program is required to update the HUBZone designations to ensure the program continues to serve the communities that are most in need of assistance. Most areas stay the same but some change. The 2023 map will be updated again in July 2028 to reflect changes to Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs) and Qualified Non-Metropolitan Counties (QNMCs), in 2026 to reflect expiring Redesignated Areas, and throughout any year to reflect new and expiring Governor-designated covered areas and Qualified Disaster Areas as appropriate. Learn about the different types of HUBZone Designations.\n\nCertified HUBZone firms that are no longer eligible as of July 1, 2023 due to the map change may continue to participate in the HUBZone program through their following annual recertification.\n\nSBA is committed to helping all current HUBZone firms during this transition. For additional questions, contact your local SBA district office or email the HUBZone Help Desk.\n\nBefore you can participate in the HUBZone program, you must be certified by SBA. Review the Top Tips for HUBZone Certification Tip Sheet and take these steps to get HUBZone certified. You can also find information about the program and eligibility guidelines in SBA's latest FAQ.\n\nMake sure you have a SAM.gov account.\n\nRegister for an SBA Connect account and request access to the HUBZone portal. View the instructional video.\n\nApply for HUBZone certification in the HUBZone portal. Log in to SBA Connect and select “HUBZone” before completing the prompts.\n\nCheck your email (including spam folder) for time-sensitive instructions to electronically verify your application within 2 business days.\n\nSubmit all requested supporting documentation within three business days; your submission cannot be assigned for eligibility review until all required documents are submitted. Be prepared to respond to requests for additional information from the HUBZone team within 5 business days. Failure to do so may result in a decline or withdraw of your application.\n\nCheck that your status was updated in DSBS and SAM. Within 48 hours of your approval, SBA will automatically update your status in DSBS and SAM.\n\nRead the instructions carefully to make sure you provide all the necessary information.\n\nEligibility workbook tool\n\nSBA is testing an eligibility workbook tool designed to help applicants organize, calculate, and present information related to their principal office and employee residency. Filling out the workbook tool and uploading it as part of your application will help expedite SBA’s review of your HUBZone application. We will be collecting feedback about the tool via email to hubzone@sba.gov. If you wish to utilize the workbook, please follow the link above, download it in Excel to your computer, input the information using the instructions on the first tab, save your completed workbook to your computer, and upload it with the other required documents as part of your application submission. If you have questions about the workbook tool, reach out to hubzone@sba.gov or join one of our open calls every Tuesday and Thursday from 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m. ET via toll-free number: 208-391-5817; Conference ID: 278 449 067, where members of our team answer questions to help firms navigate the certification process.\n\nDocument checklists\n\nThere is a new and improved supporting documents checklist.\n\nYou will be required to submit different supporting documentation based on your ownership structure.\n\nYou’ll need to recertify for the HUBZone program once a year. There is no limit to the length of time a business can participate as long as it continues to qualify. A program examination will be required at least every three years.\n\nHUBZone businesses must notify SBA if their business is involved in a merger or acquisition or if HUBZone residency drops below 20% while performing on a HUBZone contract.\n\nSBA may visit HUBZone businesses unannounced and conduct program examinations to verify the accuracy of any certification made or information provided as part of the HUBZone application or recertification process. For more information about continuing eligibility, view the Recertification Fact Sheet."
