        "text": "The knockout bracket at Euro 2024 is complete with the final round of group matches over.\n\nThe top two teams in each group go through to the round of 16, along with the four best runners-up.\n\nThis is how the group stage played out.\n\nQUALIFIED: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, Switzerland\n\nELIMINATED: Albania, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Scotland, Serbia, Ukraine\n\nTIEBREAKERS:\n\nIf teams are equal on points, they will be separated by the following criteria:\n\n1. Head-to-head points\n\n2. Head-to-head goal difference\n\n3. Head-to-head goals scored\n\nIf three teams are level on points, a mini-league is created only involving the results of the matches between the teams in question.\n\n4. If after applying stages 1-3 some teams are still level, it is reapplied just to those teams. For instance, England, Slovenia and Serbia are level on points; after applying 1-3, England are first but Slovenia and Serbia cannot be separated in the three-team mini-league. The direct head-to-head between Slovenia and Serbia would determine second place.\n\nIf teams still cannot be separated, the following are applied:\n\n5. Group goal difference\n\n6. Group goals scored\n\n7. Penalty shootout, if the two teams are playing each other on the final matchday\n\n8. If they don't play each other, lower disciplinary points (1 point yellow, 3 points red via two yellows, 3 points direct red, 4 points yellow followed by direct red)\n\n9. European qualifiers overall ranking, unless Germany are involved. If Germany are involved, then it would be a random drawing of lots.\n\nGroup A\n\nResults:\n\nGermany 5-1 Scotland\n\nHungary 1-3 Switzerland\n\nGermany 2-0 Hungary\n\nScotland 1-1 Switzerland\n\nSwitzerland 1-1 Germany\n\nScotland 0-1 Hungary\n\nGermany snatched back top spot in the group by scoring a 92nd-minute equaliser against Switzerland, dropping them to second.\n\nHungary left it even later to get a victory in their game against Scotland, finding a winning goal in the last of 10 minutes of added time. That moved Hungary up to third on three points, though with goal difference of -3. In the end they missed out as the fourth-best third-placed team had three points and goal difference of 0.\n\nGroup B\n\nResults:\n\nSpain 3-0 Croatia\n\nItaly 2-1 Albania\n\nCroatia 2-2 Albania\n\nSpain 1-0 Italy\n\nAlbania 0-1 Spain\n\nCroatia 1-1 Italy\n\nMattia Zaccagni scored in the eighth minute of stoppage time to send Italy automatically through to the round of 16, earning a 1-1 draw with Croatia. Results in other groups meant Zaccagni's goal eliminated Croatia, as they could not be one of the best third-placed teams.\n\nSpain, who had already sealed top spot, wrapped things up with a 1-0 win over Albania, who finished bottom.\n\nGroup C\n\nResults:\n\nSlovenia 1-1 Denmark\n\nSerbia 0-1 England\n\nSlovenia 1-1 Serbia\n\nDenmark 1-1 England\n\nEngland 0-0 Slovenia\n\nDenmark 0-0 Serbia\n\nWithout doubt the most uninspiring group at Euro 2024. England claimed top spot with a 0-0 draw against Slovenia, while Serbia couldn't get the win they needed against Denmark: Again 0-0.\n\nSlovenia are guaranteed to be a best third-placed team.\n\nDenmark and Slovenia had identical records, with the Danes finishing second on six yellow cards to Slovenia's seven.\n\n- Will England play Netherlands in round of 16?\n\nGroup D\n\nResults:\n\nPoland 1-2 Netherlands\n\nAustria 0-1 France\n\nPoland 1-3 Austria\n\nNetherlands 0-0 France\n\nFrance 1-1 Poland\n\nNetherlands 2-3 Austria\n\nAustria claimed a stunning win over Netherlands, which coupled with France's surprise draw against Poland meant it was Austria who topped the group.\n\nNetherlands may feel they escaped for failing to capitalise on France's slip, with tie against Romania.\n\nGroup E\n\nResults:\n\nRomania 3-0 Ukraine\n\nBelgium 0-1 Slovakia\n\nSlovakia 1-2 Ukraine\n\nBelgium 2-0 Romania\n\nUkraine 0-0 Belgium\n\nSlovakia 1-1 Romania\n\nThe group ended as it began, with all four teams level on four points.\n\nRomania were the surprise group winners, with Belgium going through in second.\n\nFour points was enough for Slovakia to get through in third, while Ukraine became the first team to go out of the Euros on four points under this format -- as they finished bottom.\n\nGroup F\n\nResults:\n\nTurkey 3-1 Georgia\n\nPortugal 2-1 Czechia\n\nGeorgia 1-1 Czechia\n\nTurkey 0-3 Portugal\n\nCzechia 1-2 Turkey\n\nGeorgia 2-0 Portugal\n\nPortugal won the group with a game to spare, but their shock 2-0 defeat to Georgia in the final match saw the team ranked 74th in the world, in their first-ever tournament, go through in third.\n\nTurkey went through in second, with a late 2-1 win against bottom-of-the-group Czechia.\n\nRanking of best third-placed teams\n\nThe four best runners-up will go through to the round of 16.\n\nThis format has been in place for two previous editions, and both times four points secured progress. At Euro 2020, Ukraine sneaked through on three points. At Euro 2016, both Northern Ireland and eventual winners Portugal made it on three points.\n\nThis time two teams again made it through on three points, with Hungary slipping out of the top four right at the end.\n\n- Why England play Netherlands in round of 16\n\nThe third-place ranking is determined first by:"
