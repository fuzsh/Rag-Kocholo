Everything from starting, how to build, to actually selling online. I took every possible advice whether it's legal, educational, informational, mentoring, everything. I've relied on SCORE. SCORE has been my secret weapon, I must say.\"\n\nThe Chaga Company\n\n\"Pete Slosberg is GOLD. From securing my position in the market, redefining our sales sheet, providing guidance on the core values and driving force of the company, recommending new marketing strategies, and suggesting unique customer acquisition approaches.\"\n\nSilver Slice Bakery\n\n\"I encourage business start-ups and seasoned business owners to utilize SCORE services to grow their business. It WORKS especially if you do the work. The training is impeccable and the mentors are the best part of working with SCORE. The mentors are not only knowledgeable about business and share their personal business experiences, but they also help you find out what your transitional skills are from leaving a job to starting a business, plus they are very kind and listen to you.\"\n\nPreparture\n\n\"There are challenges when it comes to being black in America. I see that as an opportunity to show why a partnership or a collaboration is actually needed. I needed someone from SCORE to provide me with strategic road-map focus, as Preparture at the time seemed broad. Meeting with Steven Lome helped me set goals and milestones.\"\n\nUni Uni Bubble Tea\n\n\"When you go to the SCORE website you can actually choose different mentors from the list. You can see their credentials, their experiences. You can be matched with the one that can help you most. SCORE is the start point for your business.\"\n\nOD Greens\n\n\"I have recommended SCORE to every veteran or entrepreneur I have come across. My team was patient, flexible, and insightful, and they brought a variety of different perspectives to our meetings. I can honestly say that I would not have been able to do it without them. Their encouragement and practical knowledge helped me to transform my idea into a reality.\"\n\nSCORE Mentorship\n\nAsk a Mentor Series\n\nAre you curious about how SCORE mentors can help your business grow?

Your mentor will ask you questions about what’s working in your business (and what’s not) and will seek to understand what you’re hoping to achieve in working with them. They will provide answers to your business questions, connect you to local and national resources, and will recommend workshops and events to help you fill any knowledge gaps that might exist.\n\nIf at any point, you need a different expert – because you need different expertise or if you don’t feel your mentor is the best fit – you can request additional support from other SCORE mentors in our network.\n\nWe can work with you using different communication methods, including phone, video, email and in-person meetings. We can provide support for a simple business question or work with you through complex business challenges. You can with your mentor(s) as often as you need, for the life of your business. We provide support for all stages of the business lifecycle. This means that we’re here to help you if you’re thinking about starting a business, managing a business, growing your business, selling or exiting your business.\n\nTo get started, simply use our mentor search or enter your zip code in the field above to complete a mentoring request. This will be sent to the appropriate mentor or chapter who will respond within 48 hours.\n\nWhen you enter your zip code in the field above, you’ll be taken to our mentoring request form. We’ll use the information that you provide in that form to find your ideal expert. More specifically, we’ll work to understand your business question(s) and compare that to the mentor profiles in our database to find an expert that matches your needs.\n\nIf you have a more general question, we’ll pair you with a local expert who can work with you to identify your area of greatest need and will coach you on that topic. If necessary, your mentor will invite other SCORE subject matter experts to help if you have questions on several different topics.\n\nThe time to get matched varies based on your business question, but typically you should hear from a mentor within 48 hours. Once you hear from your mentor, you can work with them to schedule your first mentoring appointment at a time that is convenient for both of your schedules.\n\nYes! Your mentor will attempt to contact you 3 times upon receiving your mentoring request. They will email you and text you (if you select text notifications), so make sure you check your junk folders and whitelist emails sent from @scorevolunteer.org and @score.org.\n\nClient confidentiality is an institutional principle at SCORE. This means that a SCORE client’s confidentiality does not reside with a single volunteer or chapter but is maintained as confidential within SCORE.\n\nSCORE volunteers cannot sign any client’s confidentiality agreements or any Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA), but the client’s confidentiality is covered in the volunteer’s agreement with SCORE.\n\nThis agreement to maintain client confidentiality - as well as other values that are integral to the client relationship - is confirmed in writing in the SCORE Code of Ethics. Among other things, our Code of Ethics directs our volunteers as follows:\n\nAlways place the business interests of SCORE clients first.\n\nProtect the confidentiality of all client information so that it remains within SCORE.\n\nAll SCORE mentors are required to sign this agreement annually.\n\nSCORE mentors can help businesses in all industries. We have experts in a variety of fields, including professional services, retail, arts, entertainment, recreation, food services, accommodations, travel, marketing & advertising, health care, social assistance, real estate and more.\n\nRegardless of your industry, our mentors are knowledgeable in all areas of business and can answer your questions about popular topics such as sales, marketing, finance, accounting, management, and technology.\n\nA SCORE mentoring relationship lasts as long as you need it! That can mean a few meaningful sessions to achieve a specific goal or overcome a challenge. Or, it can be a SCORE mentoring relationship that lasts for years, when you always have a trusted advisor for the life of your small business.\n\nA mentoring session is a confidential, personalized conversation with a business expert to answer a question or to solve a problem that you’re facing.\n\nSCORE mentoring sessions are collaborative meetings between the small business owner and the SCORE mentor. They are typically scheduled for an hour and can be held virtually, through online meetings, phone calls, email, or even in person if you would like to be paired with a local mentor. You can share your business goals, progress, challenges, and questions during these sessions. SCORE mentors will offer advice, resources, and insights so you gain clarity on your next best steps.\n\nWhen you first meet with your mentor, they will ask you questions about your business and your goals. This will help them understand how to best support you and answer your business questions. They will leverage their personal experience and knowledge to help you avoid common challenges and mistakes. If they do not have the expertise you need, they may invite another mentor to participate in the meeting.\n\nOnce you discuss your initial business question, they may ask you to complete business templates or to review resources on SCORE.org. Additionally, they may recommend SCORE or partner workshops or resources to meet your needs. They will also schedule a follow-up session to ensure you’re on the right track and to keep supporting your business.\n\nTo make the most of your mentoring experience, we recommend being prepared with a business question or challenge that you can work on with your mentor. If you’re starting a business, we recommend being prepared with a business idea before you request a mentor. If you’re not sure what type of business you want to start, consider using our Startup Roadmap to help you define your business idea. If you already own a business, come to your meeting prepared with the issue you need to resolve or the goal that you’d like to achieve.\n\nOther tips to make the most of your mentoring include:\n\nChecking your inbox for emails from SCORE.\n\nBe ready to actively participate in your session. This means bringing specific questions that we can answer, engaging in discussions about your business, and challenging the mentor's ideas & suggestions if you don't fully understand them.\n\nIf your business is already in operation, please be willing to share your history, recent financials, cash flow, and business plan. This will give your mentor a much-needed understanding of your current operations so they can suggest ideas about how/where to improve.\n\nBe open and honest in the discussion.\n\nBe willing to meet with your mentor over a period of time. Many of the questions that we receive will take more than one meeting to answer. Remember, mentoring is always free and you can meet with your mentor as often as needed (based on schedule and availability).\n\nKeep in mind that SCORE mentors will not do the work for you. We are here as guides and advisors but we’ll ask you to do the work. This is to help you develop the skills and knowledge needed to manage your business.\n\nWhen you’ve achieved success with your mentor, submit a success story for our website. This will allow us to celebrate your accomplishments and spread the word about your business. Your story could be featured in SCORE’s national media releases and marketing efforts, which will build awareness for your business.\n\nConsider attending a SCORE workshop to complement your mentoring. We offer educational webinars, workshops and events online and in your local community. This will help you strengthen your knowledge and expand your business network."
