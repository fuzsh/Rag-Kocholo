China is second with 25, and Australia is at third with 18.\n\nTeam USA to play in both men's and women's basketball semifinals\n\nAmericans aren't ones to take basketball lightly, a fact that's showing at the 2024 Paris Games as both the men and the women head into the semifinals.\n\nToday's game in the women's tournament ended with the Americans besting Nigeria 88-74. Team USA is stacked with some WNBA superstars, including A'ja Wilson, who led the team with 20 points.\n\nThe Las Vegas Aces star played with other notable names, such as Brittany Griner, Diana Taurasi, Breanna Steward and Napheesa Collier.\n\nThe men's team will play Serbia tomorrow, while the women are set to compete against Australia on Friday.\n\nFirst medal for U.S. artistic swim team in 2 decades is especially sweet for Anita Alvarez\n\nand\n\nWhen the U.S. claimed silver today in artistic swimming, it was extra special for Anita Alvarez, who was competing in her third Games.\n\nDuring the 2022 World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, the Buffalo native lost consciousness during the competition and sank to the bottom of the pool. Alvarez’ coach rescued her, but she was out for nearly two minutes.\n\n“I remember swimming the routine and being so present,” she told NBC News. “And then all of a sudden waking up, looking up at the sky and all these medical people were around me.”\n\nAlvarez pushed herself to return to the sport and was medically cleared to compete in the Games. Her silver medal was the U.S.’ first in the sport since 2004.\n\nChina won gold — its first in the sport — and Spain took bronze.\n\nIn his first Olympics, American Kenneth Rooks made a bold choice — and it paid off big.\n\nWith less than two laps to go in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, Rooks, a former NCAA champion at Brigham Young University, moved to the front and held off a strong charge on the finishing straight to claim silver.\n\nSoufiane El Bakkali of Morrocco took gold, and Abraham Kibiwot of Kenya rounded out the podium.\n\nRooks and Evan Jager (2016 silver) are the only American men to win medals in the event since 1984.\n\nThrough eight days of track and field competition at the Paris Games, the U.S. men have won a medal in every event on the track.\n\nThe scoop on the bell track and field winners are ringing\n\nA cheerful ringing is pouring out from Stade de France, the Olympic track and field stadium, but it’s not applause from the stands.\n\nIt’s from a bell.\n\nAfter they win their track and field events, gold medalists get to ring a giant bell in the stadium. Athletes like American runners Gabby Thomas and Noah Lyles have pulled on the rope to make it ring loud and proud.\n\nThe bell is from Normandy, France, and was created at a foundry — a factory that crafts metal castings — called the Fonderie de Cloches Cornille Havard, or Cornille Havard Foundry in English. The workshop was built in 1865, according to the foundry’s official website.The bell, which was present for other field events during the first week of the Olympics, including rugby, is now being rung exclusively by gold medalists in the track and field events.\n\nThe bell will be taken to Paris' famed Notre-Dame, the medieval Gothic cathedral on the Île de la Cité, an island in the Seine. From there, it will be placed among the smaller bells set in the spire inside the roof, which was rebuilt after it was ravaged by fire in April 2019.\n\nQuincy Hall adds to U.S. runners' gold rush\n\nWith a quarter of the 400-meter race to go, a medal didn't look likely for Quincy Hall of Kansas City, Missouri. But he closed the fastest of anyone in the field and won gold by 0.04 seconds with a time of 43.40.\n\nThe U.S. won gold in this event at seven straight Olympics from 1984 to 2008 but had only one medal (LaShawn Merritt, 2016 bronze) in the last three Games.\n\nThis is only Hall’s second year as a 400-meter specialist; before last year, he focused on the 400-meter hurdles. He was an NCAA hurdles champion at South Carolina.\n\nMatthew Hudson-Smith of Great Britain broke his own European record on his way to silver, and Muzala Samukonga of Zambia crossed the line third. That's the third Olympic medal across all sports for the country.\n\nTeam USA dominates men's 200 meters as 3 Americans qualify for the final\n\nTeam USA has an excellent chance at the gold as the men's 200-meter final tomorrow will feature three American runners racing for the podium.\n\nNoah Lyles is looking for a repeat after he earned a gold in a photo finish in the men's 100 meters this week. Lyles, 23, won both events at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, finishing the 200 meters in 19.52 seconds.\n\nHe'll be competing against fellow Americans Kenny Bednarek and Erriyon Knighton, who also have excellent times in the 200-meter race and rank behind Lyles in the world standings. Both men's personal bests fall just slightly behind Lyles' time in Budapest, offering him stiff competition.\n\nArguably, the biggest competition for the American men is Botswana's Letsiles Tebogo, ranked No. 4 in the world. He has run excellent heats throughout the qualifying races, and his personal best time for the 200 meters is 19.50 seconds.\n\nAnother showdown for pole vault favorites\n\nWhen the U.S.' Katie Moon and Australia's Nina Kennedy faced off at the 2023 World Championships, they decided to share gold medals rather than participate in a jump-off. But with an Olympic gold on the line, that wouldn't do today.\n\nAfter 3½ hours and 123 total jumps, Kennedy walked away with the top prize in Paris.\n\nMoon, who was looking to repeat her Tokyo performance, settled for silver.\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone will be running for gold tomorrow in the 400-meter hurdles, a race she's the favorite to win.\n\nPart of the reason for her success? Her relationships, she says.\n\nShe says being married has changed her life for the better and helped her become stronger on and off the track.\n\nSkateboarding: American Tom Schaar celebrating his silver\n\nTom Schaar, a 12-time X Games skateboarding medalist, has a taste of Olympic glory after his silver medal finish today in men's park skateboarding.\n\nAustralian Keegan Palmer defended his Olympic gold medal after he landed an impressive 93.11-point run, and Brazil's Augusto Akio took bronze.\n\nThe U.S. is still looking for its first skateboarding gold\n\nGolf: Celine Boutier thrills French fans with 65\n\nCeline Boutier fired a 65 to lead after Round 1 of the Olympic women’s event. Watch and hear from the French favorite at Le Golf National.\n\nSkateboarding: 51-year-old Olympic newcomer says he had the time of his life competing in Paris\n\nAndy Macdonald may have spent decades as a professional skateboarder, but the veteran athlete was an excited newcomer at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nMacdonald, 51, was cheered on today by fellow skateboarding legend Tony Hawk, 56, as he became the oldest skateboarder to compete in an Olympic Games. Macdonald went pro in 1994 and is decades older than his fellow Team Great Britain skateboarders, 16-year-olds Sky Brown and Lola Tambling.\n\nMacdonald, a 23-time X Games champion, zipped through the skate park during the preliminaries, showing off flashy moves, including a Madonna and a body varial 540.\n\nWhile he didn’t win a medal, Macdonald called the experience the thrill of his professional career.\n\n“I could have fallen on every run and just be as happy as I am now. It doesn’t matter,” Macdonald told Olympics.com after the event. “It’s just been the experience of a lifetime.”\n\nA gold medal ceremony years in the making for skaters\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nIt wasn’t the typical medal ceremony at the Summer Olympics in Paris. But after 2½ years, the nine members of the U.S. figure skating team were awarded their gold medals today after the Russian team was disqualified.\n\nUkrainian president praises athletes after two gold medals\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised his country’s athletes today after a boxer scored a gold medal.\n\n“Another gold medal for Ukraine at the Olympics in Paris! Boxer Oleksandr Khyzhnyak has taken the first place,” Zelenskyy said on X. “Thank you for your strength, your confidence, and for this important victory!”\n\nKhyzhnyak defeated Nurbek Oralbay of Kazakhstan today in the final, earning Ukraine’s first gold in the men’s middleweight class.\n\nWorld record holder Yaroslava Mahuchikh won gold for Ukraine in women’s high jump Sunday, earning her first Olympic medal.\n\n“I jump for my Ukrainian people, my Ukrainian nation,” said Mahuchikh, who fled her hometown near the Russian border soon after that country's invasion in 2022.\n\n“Since the war, mentally I get stronger than I was before,” she said. “I will not give up at the Olympics.”\n\nWater polo: High drama in the pool as Serbia’s Jakšić scores game-winner at buzzer\n\nWith 3 seconds remaining, Serbia’s Nikola Jakšić scored a game-winning goal to give his team a win over Greece and advance to the men’s water polo semifinals.\n\nOlympic Muffin Man is not a fan of swimming in the Seine\n\nHenrik Christiansen, known online as the Olympic Muffin Man, is not impressed by Paris' Seine after he had to swim in the river in preparation for the men's 10-kilometer marathon swimming event.\n\nChristiansen is one of Norway's best distance swimmers, but he has become famous these last two weeks for his obsession with a chocolate muffin served at the Olympic Village. His funny TikTok videos found new focus today after having to swim in the controversial waters.\n\nThe first video Christiansen posted used a disparaging sound bite from former \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" star Nene Leaks, panning the camera to the Seine. He was dry in that one.\n\nHis next video shows him in his swim gear, clearly wet.\n\n\"I'm not ashamed to admit it; it's hell in there,\" Christian mouths in the video. \"It's horror. You have to be a certain type of person to survive.\"\n\nFans say Caeleb Dressel gives serious ‘dad energy’ in TikTok fail\n\nU.S. swimmer Caeleb Dressel was giving “dad energy,” according to fans, when he participated in a popular TikTok trend with other Olympians.\n\nIn the nearly 1-minute clip, shared by U.S swimmer Gretchen Walsh, Dressel, 27, looks confused as other athletes say, “Just give me my money,” one after the other.\n\nAs the athletes go on, they get a round of applause from the group, but when it comes Dressel’s turn, he tells them he doesn’t know what to do.\n\n“No, dude. I’m not doing it. I don’t get it,” he says, laughing.\n\nHowever, the group of athletes keep egging him on.\n\n“Come on,” they say.\n\nDressel then participates in the trend and gives it his best shot. However, when he says, “Just give me my money,” like everyone else, he looks confused about whether he did it right.\n\n“Is that how it ends?” he asks as everyone laughs.\n\n“How am I supposed to do it?” he says.\n\n“I think the TikTok is great just like that,” someone replies off camera.\n\n“No, dude. I’m not doing it. I don’t get it,” he says, laughing.\n\nHowever, the group of athletes keeps egging him on.\n\nOne says, “He’s got such Dad energy 😭.”\n\nA third writes, “You did him SO wrong!!! 😂😂😂.”\n\nA fourth adds, “Not you picking on the dad? 😂.”\n\nDressel won two gold medals and a silver. In total, he now has 10 Olympic medals, nine of them gold.\n\nBeach volleyball: For first time, Team USA will wear no medals\n\nAnd then there were none — no American teams left in the beach volleyball competition, that is.\n\nMiles Partain and Andy Benesh fell 2-0 to Qatar today and missed out on the semifinals.\n\nThe remaining women's beach volleyball team was knocked out of the competition yesterday.\n\nThis is the first time since beach volleyball made its Olympic debut in 1996 that no American team (men or women) will win a medal.\n\nBasketball: U.S. beats Nigeria 88-74 on way to women's semifinal\n\nThe U.S. entered the final quarter of the game with an almost 20-point cushion. When the final buzzer sounded, it came away with an 88-74 win over Nigeria.\n\nEvery member of the American team scored. A’ja Wilson led with 20 points, followed by Jackie Young with 15.\n\nThe team held off Nigeria's smart defensive moves with passing plays that opened up the court to score.\n\nTeam USA will advance to the women's basketball semifinal against Australia on Friday.\n\nAthletics: U.S. takes silver in steeplechase\n\nThe U.S.' Kenneth Rooks took silver in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, almost catching up to Morocco's Soufiane El Bakkali but ultimately coming in second.\n\nKenya's Abraham Kibiwot took the bronze.\n\nEl Bakkali became the first man in almost a century to successfully defend his gold medal, and the silver was a remarkable triumph for Rooks.\n\nThe race was dramatic, as Ethiopia's Lamecha Girma was looking to upgrade his silver from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to a gold. The defending silver medalist ran into a barrier and fell, however, remaining on the ground for the remainder of the race. Girma had to be carried out of the field on a stretcher.\n\nBasketball: U.S. leads Nigeria 52-33 in women's quarterfinal\n\nTeam USA took the second quarter by storm, doubling their score and leading by almost 20 points in the women's quarterfinal game.\n\nWrestling: Sarah Ann Hildebrandt wins gold in 50 kg freestyle\n\nAfter winning bronze in Tokyo, Team USA's Sarah Ann Hildebrandt has come back to win the gold, after a dominant match in the women's freestyle 50-kilogram final.\n\nHildebrandt was initially set to face off against India's Vinesh Phogat, until news broke earlier today that Phogat had failed her weigh-in and was disqualified from the competition.

She was also part of a fun-to-watch passing play that led Breanna Stewart to make a 3-pointer with an assist from Chelsea Gray early on in the game.\n\nNigeria played an impressive first quarter, capitalizing on rebound opportunities and free throws. Pallas Kunaiyi-Akpanah led the team in defensive rebounds and scored 4 points in the first 10 minutes of play.\n\nPole vault: Katie Moon wins silver, Australia's Kennedy takes gold in brilliant final showdown\n\nDefending American gold medalist Katie Moon had almost done it again. But in the heart-racing final moments of the women's pole vault final, she fell just short to take the silver, as Nina Kennedy took the gold for Australia.\n\nAfter Moon chose to pass on her second 4.90 attempt, she had only two attempts to clear the 4.95, and would have won the gold if she did so and Kennedy missed hers. But Moon failed to take off on her first attempt, then dropped the bar on her second.\n\nKennedy was the only one to clear both the 4.85 and 4.90 on her first attempts.\n\nAlysha Newman, bringing the most smiles and personality to her performance, celebrated her bronze, winning Canada's first-ever women's pole vault medal and setting a national record of 4.85.\n\nThe waiting game in pole vault, before your competitors are done their turns, adds a tough mental battle to the physical one. It couldn't be clearer in this final that lasted over three hours.\n\nBoxing: Lin Yu-ting headed to gold medal bout\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nLin Yu-ting won her Olympic semifinal bout by unanimous decision on Wednesday night as the featherweight from Taiwan advanced to the gold medal match.\n\nShe outclassed Turkey’s Esra Yıldız Kahraman and will step into the ring next on Saturday night at center court of famed Roland-Garros Stadium.\n\nThat’s where she’ll face either Nesthy Petecio of the Philippines or Poland’s Julia Szeremet.\n\nIt’s been a difficult week for Lin, who has had to endure unverified allegations by the Russian-backed International Boxing Association regarding her and Algerian welterweight Imane Khelif’s gender qualifications.\n\nBasketball: U.S. women face off against Nigeria in quarterfinal game\n\nThe women's basketball quarterfinal is underway as the U.S. plays Nigeria in the knockout portion of the tournament.\n\nA'ja Wilson already led Team USA to a strong start making the first basket of the game, but it was quickly equalized by Nigeria's Promise Amukamara. Wilson offered an assist to teammate Napheesa Collier to get back in the lead in the first few minutes.\n\nThe winner of this game will play Australia on Friday.\n\nTrack: Quincy Hall wins gold in 400-meter\n\nAmerican Quincy Hall won gold in the men’s 400-meter, finishing the race in 43.40 seconds.\n\nGreat Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith won silver, while Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga took home the bronze.\n\nHall was trailing during the final stretch of the race before a frantic sprint down the stretch allowed him to overtake multiple runners, including Hudson-Smith, who was leading.\n\nHall celebrated by making a snow angel on the track.\n\nMichael Norman, the only other American in the race, finished last.\n\nPole vault: Katie Moon seeks back-to-back golds\n\nThe final stretch of the women's pole vault final is underway, and Team USA's Katie Moon is jumps away from defending her Tokyo gold.\n\nAfter clearing the first four heights with seemingly effortless confidence, Moon missed the 4.85-meter bar but cleared it on her second, and she sits in the second-place position.\n\nCurrently in the gold-medal position is Australia's Nina Kennedy, with whom Moon shared the 2023 World Championship title. In third is Canada's Alysha Newman, with Switzerland's Angelica Moser right behind after passing on her third 4.85 attempt.\n\nArtistic swimming: Team USA wins silver for first medal in 20 years\n\nand\n\nAfter moonwalking upside-down to Michael Jackson's \"Smooth Criminal\" during one of their routines, Team USA's artistic swimmers are now silver medalists, ending the country's 20-year medal drought in the sport.\n\nWhile their technical routine scored the fourth highest in points, it was the team's free and acrobatic routines that lifted them to second place.\n\nAfter performing the best routine of each category, China finally won its first gold medal in the sport, after winning silver at the past three Olympics.\n\nDaniella Ramirez, who just missed out on the Tokyo Olympics, took a moment to reflect on bringing home the silver.\n\n\"Looking at what happened on day one to be here and everything that’s happened in the past four years. I mean, it’s been a roller coaster — but I’m so glad that we’re ended up here,\" she said. \"And I’m just so grateful for this team. There’s nothing more magical than this team.\"\n\nAnita Alvarez, who made an amazing comeback after nearly dying in the pool after fainting two years ago, also said winning the silver had a special significance for her.\n\n\"Just to be out here with the team, and it’s even more special getting to experience it with probably the rest of these people around me, because they’ve helped me through difficult times, and we’ve all helped each other overcome our own fears and struggles,\" Alvarez said. \"So it just means so much to, you know, to be here.\"\n\nArtistic swimming: Team USA looks to break its 20-year medal drought\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nA sea of lights (iPhones) is filling a darkened Aquatics Centre as we are now minutes away from the start of the artistic swimming final round.\n\nIf Team USA maintains its second-place position, it would be the first time in 20 years that artistic swimming brings home an Olympic medal.\n\nWater polo: U.S. moves into semifinals, defeating Australia 11(4)-10(3)\n\nFor the first time since 2008, the U.S. men's water polo team will move into the semifinals.\n\nThe Americans played Australia during an extremely tight match where they held a one-point lead only briefly in the fourth quarter, after which Australia scored to tie with the U.S. again, 10-10.\n\nAfter the two teams ran the clock out, they advanced into a penalty shoot-out to decide the winner.

Sure, I'm bummed about how I performed, but I can't help but accept and acknowledge the massive strides I made in the face of headwinds and the winding roads I traveled to reach my goals.\"\n\nManuel said that she was \"filled with even more passion for the sport than before\" and listed several of her achievements during this Olympic cycle, including winning two silver medals in the women's 4x100 and 4x200 freestyle relays.\n\n\"I know that I am so much more than a swimmer,\" Manuel added, expressing pride in her character beyond her races.\n\nShe concluded her note with words of encouragement, telling her audience to \"write [their] own story.\"\n\n\"The journey means nothing if you're not doing it for you! Take pride in the struggle, be an unstoppable force, persevere with patience and course... That's when you win!\"\n\nVolleyball: Poland beats U.S., 3-2, in nail-biting semifinal match\n\nPoland has knocked the U.S. out of the finals. The team beat the U.S. 3-2, forcing the extremely close match into an equally tight fifth set. In the fourth match point, Poland got the job done, advancing to the finals for the first time in decades.\n\nThe last time Poland medaled in volleyball was in 1976.\n\nPoland will play the winner of the France-Italy match for gold. The U.S. will play the loser for bronze.\n\nSkateboarding: Australia wins park finals with gold\n\nAustralia's Keegan Palmer, 21, successfully defended his gold medal from the 2020 Olympics, winning the men's park final after an impressive first run score of 93.11 that he never relinquished.\n\nHis gold in Paris marks Australia's second in park, after Arisa Trew, 14, won the women's park final on Tuesday.\n\nUSA's Tom Schaar won silver in his Olympic debut, with a best score of 92.23 in his second run, getting cheers from Snoop Dogg, NBA star Devin Booker and skateboarding legend Tony Hawk who were in attendance.\n\nBrazil's Augusto Akio earned bronze with a best score of 91.85 in his third and final run.\n\nWeightlifting: Hampton Morris wins bronze to end USA's 40-year drought\n\nTwenty-year-old weightlifter Hampton Morris became the first American man to win an Olympic weightlifting medal in four decades, after winning the bronze in the men’s 61-kg division.\n\nAfter finishing the snatch session in fifth, Morris' podium chances rested on his clean and jerks. He missed his first clean attempt but increased his second to 172 kg and made the lift, boosting him to third place. For his final clean and jerk, he attempted a world record of 178 kg but was unable to follow through. Still, Morris celebrated his historic bronze medal.\n\nChina's Li Fabin won gold, defending his title from Tokyo, after setting an Olympic snatch record of 167 kilograms, or 315 pounds.

Gold medals were placed around the necks of the U.S. athletes, and silver for Japan. After the ceremony and all smiles, they posed for photos with the Eiffel Tower behind them.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. finished second to the Russian Olympic Committee, or ROC. However, ROC athlete Kamila Valieva tested positive for a banned substance, leading the International Olympic Committee to declare that no medals would be presented for the team event.\n\nTeam USA launched the More Than Medals campaign to push for a final decision, and on July 25, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the U.S. would be awarded gold.\n\nThe final podium was announced Friday, with the ROC awarded bronze and Japan silver. Canada finished fourth and, despite an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Committee, wasn't moved up to third place.\n\nVolleyball: U.S. and Poland tied 1-1 in semis\n\nEveryone is on the edge of their seats at the Paris Expo, as the U.S.' volleyball team makes a last minute comeback to take the second set of the match against Poland, tying with them 1-1.\n\nThe Americans won the set 27-25, reigniting hope of moving to the finals.\n\nThe two teams will play for best of five sets.\n\nBasketball: Kevin Durant breaks Lisa Leslie's Olympic record and gives her a shoutout\n\nKevin Durant assisted the U.S. in its quarterfinal victory against Brazil, earning a new Olympic record in the process.\n\nDurant scored 11 points, bringing his Olympic career total to 494.

She was named All-American seven times and became the first Ivy League athlete to win an NCAA sprinting championship, setting a record time in the event.\n\nWatch: Gabby Thomas talks about her first gold with 'TODAY'\n\nIs there anything Gabby Thomas can't do?\n\nAfter winning a gold medal, Thomas sat down with Savannah and Hoda to talk about her accomplishments in Paris, which included topping a podium for the first time ever.\n\nThomas, a Harvard grad and University of Texas master's degree-holder, said that winning gold was the thing she is proudest of.\n\n\"This took a lot of years and it took a lot of patience, and people don't see that journey,\" Thomas said. \"Every year, every month, every minute was very intentional for this moment.\"\n\n\"I don't think I've ever worked this hard for anything in my life,\" she said.\n\nVolleyball: Poland takes first semifinals set vs. U.S.\n\nWorld No. 1 team Poland takes the first set in its match against the U.S.\n\nThe gold medal favorites are facing off against Team USA, which must make a comeback in this set to stay in contention for the top two podium spots.\n\n'That's America's foot': Internet goes crazy for goalie Alyssa Naeher\n\nSome might say that goalies are the unsung heroes of soccer, but the internet is singing for U.S. goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher after she managed to block a shot with the side of her cleat.\n\nIt was an opportunity for Germany to tie the game in the last minute of extra time against the U.S. women's soccer team in yesterday's game, but Naeher saved the day. She jumped into the air but the ball went low, so she just managed to tip the ball in the other direction.\n\nThe goal would have been likely called offside anyway, but that doesn't take away from how cool it was.\n\n\"Alyssa Naeher or BRICK WALL. Save of a LIFETIME,\" one X user wrote.\n\nSome spectators were just in pure disbelief, one writing simply, \"Alyssa Naeher are you joking.\"\n\n\"that's america's foot,\" one person captioned the image.\n\nVolleyball: USA vs. Poland semifinals underway\n\nThe semifinal match between the U.S. and Poland is underway.\n\nThe U.S. faces a challenge against gold-medal favorite Poland. Neither of them took a spot in the podium last Olympics, but both have a shot this year.\n\nPoland last took home an Olympic medal in 1976 when they won gold, and the U.S. is looking to break a comparatively shorter 20-year streak without hardware.\n\nPoland beat Slovenia 3-1 yesterday, and the U.S. beat Brazil by the same margin.\n\nOpen water swimmers train in Seine for 10-kilometer races\n\nOlympic open water swimmers trained in the long-polluted Seine River today after Paris organizers determined it was safe to dive in.\n\nA two-hour training session was held on a cool, cloudy morning, providing the only chance for swimmers to familiarize themselves with the picturesque course through the middle of the French capital.\n\nWorld Aquatics canceled a test run yesterday because of concerns over fluctuating bacteria levels in the waterway. Despite massive efforts to clear the Seine, water quality has been a constant concern throughout the Games.\n\nDozens of swimmers — from 2016 Olympic champion Sharon van Rouwendaal to Ireland’s Daniel Wiffen, competing in open water for the first time — dove into the Seine one day before the women’s 10-kilometer marathon event. The men’s race is set for Friday.\n\n“I think if anyone’s saying they’re not concerned at all, they’re probably lying,” Austrian swimmer Felix Auboeck said. “I am concerned. I just hope and trust the organization in the sense that they let us in when it’s safe enough to do so. But, of course, you’re concerned because no one wants to get ill or sick.”\n\nThink your Olympic dream is over? 51-year-old skateboarder Andy Macdonald may say otherwise\n\nOlympic skateboarding has been dominated by teens both in its debut in Tokyo and again here in Paris, but that hasn’t stopped 51-year-old Andy Macdonald, a father of three who is representing Britain in the men’s park event, from making his Olympic debut in Paris.\n\nA skateboarding legend who won the first of his eight X Games gold medals in 1996, Macdonald was born and raised in Massachusetts and lives in southern California, but switched his allegiances to Britain earlier this year to make the Games through his English-born father.\n\n\"People come at me like: Is it weird? You’re the old guy at the skate park, you’re 50 and there are all these teenagers. No, it’s not weird because I was there first and I never left,\" Macdonald told the Financial Times. \"I’m like a sponge, just taking it all in. Just the experience of being an Olympian. If they have a medal for who has the most fun, I got the gold locked up for sure.\"\n\nA medal for fun? Maybe, but unfortunately, an Olympic medal will be beyond his grasp. Macdonald hasn’t made the final — his best run of 77.76 in today’s prelims was not enough to qualify. Team USA will have two riders, though, with Tom Schaar and Tate Carew in the final at 11:30 a.m. ET.\n\nHow do synchronized swimmers keep their hair so immaculate?\n\nToday marks the final of the team acrobatic routine event of synchronized swimming — known as artistic swimming in the Olympics.\n\nOne burning question you may have after watching is how the swimmers' hair remains intact without swimming caps. Well, former Team USA athlete Mariya Koroleva revealed all to Vogue back in 2016. The answer? Gelatin!\n\n\"It’s like unflavored Jell-O — we mix it with water, and it turns into a gooey mixture,\" she said. \"You comb or brush that into your hair, put it up in a bun, and put a headpiece over that, so when it dries, it gets really hard and your hair doesn’t fall out when you swim.\"\n\nThe final of the team event will begin at 1:30 p.m ET and the U.S. swimmers will need to get past China if they want to notch another gold.\n\nThe men's steeplechase is today. But what is it?\n\nThe men's steeplechase is one of the Olympics' most eye-catching track and field events. The 3,000-meter race takes athletes over fixed barriers and a water jump.\n\nThe barriers are not to be confused with hurdles — they span several lanes and are fixed in place so don't fall down. They are slightly lower than hurdles and athletes need to clear them 28 times over the race's seven laps. The water jump is unique to the steeplechase: A sloping, 2-foot-deep water pool lies behind one of the barriers. Racers have to make it over the water once each lap.\n\nThe event evolved in the 1800s as a race between two towns' church steeples that would traverse hedges and streams. Today's steeplechase originated at Oxford University in England and made its Olympic debut in 1920.\n\nTeam USA's men last medaled in 2016 — Evan Jager took silver — but first-time Olympian Kenneth Rooks will be hopeful after he claimed the NCAA title for the event last year. The gold may be a battle between world-record-holder Lamecha Girma of Ethiopia and reigning Olympic champion Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco. Bahrain's Winfred Yavi broke the world record to claim gold in the women's event last night. The men's event is today at 3:43 p.m. ET.\n\nSailing: Reineke places ninth in dinghy\n\nAmerica’s Erika Reineke crossed the finish line in sixth place at the end of the women’s dinghy medal race in Marseille. The 30-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, placed ninth overall in her Laser dinghy.\n\nShe came behind the Netherlands' Marit Bouwmeester, who won gold, with Anne-Marie Rindom of Denmark in second and Line Flem Hoest of Norway in third.\n\nReineke qualified for the U.S. Olympic Team this year after three previous unsuccessful attempts. Her philosophy: “Never. Stop. Fighting.”\n\nSee Paris Olympics gymnastics arena transform to basketball court\n\nThe Bercy Arena in Paris had been home to Simone Biles and company for the gymnastics events of the Games.\n\nBut with the gymnastics over, the arena has been transformed to host the final stages of the basketball tournament after the group stages were hosted in Lille.

It is the first time an individual medal has been awarded for speed climbing after the discipline was combined with lead and boulder for its Olympic debut in Tokyo.\n\nBasketball: Barkley says men need to be 'really careful' in Serbia semifinal\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Charles Barkley says the U.S. men’s basketball team should win gold in Paris, but need to guard against complacency in Thursday’s knock-out game. \"They only have to beat you one time,\" he told NBC’s Maria Taylor.\n\nBarkley also praised the women’s basketball team, and reflected on his own experience as an Olympian. Check out the rest of his conversation with NBC News.\n\nWorld Cup winner Narasaki out of sport climbing men’s combined\n\nTomoa Narasaki, the seven-time Climbing World Cup winner, has been knocked out of the sport climbing men’s combined in the semifinal, despite earning second place in the boulder round Monday.\n\nAfter Wednesday's lead round, the 28-year-old Japanese rock climber's overall points placed him tenth overall. Only the top eight athletes advance to the final.\n\nSport climbing men’s combined consists of two disciplines: lead and boulder. Athletes must compete in both, with their scores combined to determine their overall ranking.\n\nHuge collision in men’s 5,000m heat\n\nHere's the footage of that big men's 5,000m collision we told you about.

Authorities didn’t reveal what specific online remarks He is being investigated for.\n\nMany Chinese social media users hailed this decision, with one posting on Wednesday that \"that’s exactly how it should be... they deserve to be severely punished.\"\n\nIn recent years, toxic fan culture has spread across Chinese social media and has led to a rise in cyber-abuse and the spreading of rumors against athletes.\n\nSmith: Advancing to gold final means \"absolutely everything\"\n\nSophia Smith's game-winning goal late Tuesday took the USWNT through to the women's soccer gold medal game. Smith's goal was the difference when Team USA beat Germany 1-0 in extra time. America's women will face Brazil on Saturday.\n\nWomen's Golf: Nelly Korda's title defense off to a poor start\n\nThere's still a long way to go, but Team USA's Nelly Korda's Olympic title defense has gotten off to a poor start. She sits at two-over-par through the first nine holes of the opening round.\n\nThe defending Olympic champion bogeyed the first hole at Le Golf National with further bogeys following at holes four and seven. The world number one has just birdied the par-five ninth, however, so perhaps her round is about to get back on track.\n\nTeam USA's Lilia Vu is in the early stages of her opening round. The current leader is Norway's Celine Borge, who sits at three-under-par through 10 holes.\n\nHockeyroo arrested after allegedly trying to buy cocaine in Paris\n\nand\n\nAn Australian hockey player has been arrested in Paris, the Australian Olympic Committee has confirmed, with local authorities saying the player was arrested after attempting to obtain cocaine.\n\nIn a statement, the country's Olympics committee said: \"The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) has confirmed an Australian hockey team member is in custody after being arrested in Paris on August 6th.\"\n\n\"No charges have been laid. The AOC is continuing to make enquiries and arrange support for the Team member,\" the statement said.\n\nThe public prosecutor’s office in Paris told NBC News that overnight police officers witnessed a drug deal involving cocaine in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, with the alleged buyer being a 28-year-old member of Australia's hockey team. Both the seller and the buyer were arrested and remain in police custody.\n\nAustralia’s men's and women’s field hockey teams — known as the Hockeyroos — were knocked out of the Olympics earlier this week at the quarterfinal stage.\n\nChaos in men's 5,000m heat as four runners tumble on final straight\n\nA group of four athletes were sent tumbling to the ground after being caught in a tangle of legs on the final straight of a dramatic men's 5,000 meters heat.\n\nThe fall seemingly put the athletes out of contention for the final.\n\nAfter the race, Great Britain's George Mills was furious and confronted France's Hugo Hay, who Mills believed was responsible for the incident. Hay didn't fall and qualified for the final, but Mills and the other fallers failed to finish in the top eight of the heat. Mills finished 30 seconds behind the leaders.\n\nOfficials could reinstate them for the final, but it is up to their discretion. There was more drama in the second of the two heats with a cameraman caught crossing the track right as the athletes ran past.\n\nIndian wrestler disqualified before gold medal bout after coming in overweight\n\nAn Indian wrestler has been disqualified from the gold medal bout of the women's 50kg freestyle event after failing to make weight this morning.\n\nVinesh Phogat, who on Tuesday became the first Indian woman to qualify for an Olympic wrestling final, was due to take on Team USA's Sarah Hildebrandt for gold this evening, but the Indian Olympic Association confirmed in a statement on 'X' that Phogat would not be allowed to compete after weighing in 'a few grams' over the 50kg weight limit this morning.\n\nPhogat had stunned reigning Japan's Olympic champion Yui Susaki, who is seen as the best female wrestler in the world having never lost a bout, in the quarterfinals and had been guaranteed either gold or silver having made the final. Rules dictate wrestlers have to make weight on the morning of both days of the two-day event and failure to do so results in instant disqualification.\n\nHildebrandt will now face Cuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, who had been beaten by Phogat in the semifinals, in the gold medal bout at the Champ-de-Mars Arena tonight.\n\nIsraeli athletes receive threats in Paris as tensions simmer over Gaza\n\nIsrael’s Olympic team has said some athletes have received threats, as they compete in Paris amid broader tensions over the war in Gaza and the threat of wider conflict in the Middle East.\n\nYael Arad, president of the Israeli National Olympic Committee, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that team members had received \"centralized\" threats meant to generate \"psychological terror\" in athletes, without giving further details.\n\nTom Reuveny, a 24-year-old Israeli athlete who won a gold in windsurfing over the weekend, was among those who said he’s received threats. Politics \"should be put aside\" during the Games, he told AP during a memorial Tuesday for 11 Israeli athletes killed during the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is a lot of politics involved — not in the Games — of the people who don’t want us to compete and don’t want us to be here,\" Reuveny said. \"I’ve gotten quite a few messages and threats.”\n\nMasai Russell wins 100-metre hurdles heat as she hopes to keep Team USA streak alive\n\nMasai Russell is safely through to the semifinals of the women's 100-metre hurdles after winning her heat at the Stade de France this morning.\n\nRussell, who ran the fastest time in the world this year at the U.S. Olympic trials, posted a time of 12.53 seconds, qualifying third fastest overall.\n\nTeammates Alaysha Johnson, 12.61 seconds, and Grace Stark, 12.72 seconds, also did enough to qualify for Friday's semifinals.\n\nThis is an event that Team USA has a strong pedigree in, winning at least one medal in each of the last six Olympic Games in the women's 100m hurdles, even sweeping all three podium positions in Rio. It's the longest active medal streak for Team USA in track and field events.\n\nRomanian Prime Minister boycotting closing ceremony after Chiles ruling\n\nRomania's Prime Minister, Marcel Ciolacu, has said he will boycott Sunday's closing ceremony after a \"scandalous situation\" saw a Romanian gymnast lose out on a bronze medal to Team USA's Jordan Chiles.\n\nAna Barbosu had started celebrating a bronze medal as she sat in third place with all of the routines completed in Monday's floor final. However, her celebrations proved to be short-lived after an inquiry into Team USA gymnast Chiles' score was granted by judges.\n\nThat meant Chiles' score was upgraded by 0.1 points, enough to leapfrog Barbosu into the bronze medal position, leaving the Romanian in tears.\n\n\"I decided not to attend the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics, following the scandalous situation in the gymnastics, where our athletes were treated in an absolutely dishonorable manner,\" Ciolacu said in a Facebook post. \"To withdraw a medal earned for honest work on the basis of an appeal ... is totally unacceptable!\"\n\nSpain claims race walking mixed relay gold\n\nSpanish duo Alvaro Martin and Maria Perez have taken gold in the race walking mixed relay event this morning, comfortably seeing off pairs from Ecuador and Australia to top the podium.\n\nMartin, who also won gold in the men's 20km race walk earlier in the Games, and Perez took the victory in two hours and 51 minutes, finishing 51 seconds ahead of Ecuador's Brian Daniel Pintado and Glenda Morejon. Australia claimed bronze.\n\nGabby Thomas flies to 200m gold in Paris\n\nGabby Thomas was golden in the women’s 200m final on Tuesday, winning her first Olympic title as Julien Alfred of Saint Lucia finished second and America's Brittany Brown took third.

In the race, each participant completes two alternating legs of just over 10km with the male athlete starting the race and the female athlete finishing.\n\nThe race is now in its final stages, with Spain's pair looking likely to win as long as the Ecuadorians and Australians, currently in second and third, don't stage a late surge.\n\nTeam USA did not qualify for this event, nor did they qualify for the individual 20km race walk events held earlier in the Games.\n\nAll eyes on Nelly Korda as women's golf gets underway\n\nAfter Scottie Scheffler produced an incredible final round to take gold in the men’s golf event Sunday, Team USA are hoping to sweep the golf golds for a second straight Games. Now it's the women's turn. Their event got underway this morning and takes place through Saturday.\n\nTeam USA's Nelly Korda is hoping to defend her title from Tokyo. She has had a historic year on the LPGA tour becoming the first player since 2013 to win six LPGA titles since January. It was the perfect start to the year, but the Floridian's form has tailed off in recent months and she missed the cut at both the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship. Still, if Korda is on it at Le Golf National, she will be hard to stop.\n\nTeam USA's Lilia Vu is also worth looking out for. The world number two was the breakout star of 2023, taking two of the five majors on her way to being named LPGA Player of the Year. A back injury has hindered her this year, but she returned in June coming second at the PGA Championship. \"To me, an Olympic Gold would rank a little higher than a Major,\" Vu said. \"It’s more than just golf. It’s the Olympics which is the best athletes all over the world.\"\n\nSouth Korean duo Amy Yang and Jun Young Ko pose a threat to America's golfers, while New Zealand's Lydia Ko (a silver medalist in Rio and a bronze medalist in Tokyo) will hope to complete the set in Paris.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics Day 12: here’s what to look out for.\n\nGood morning!
