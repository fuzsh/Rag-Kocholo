The relationships you make with your peers will make you a better student in and outside of the classroom—and provide you with a professional network for life.\n\nSee where 100 years of momentum will take you\n\nKansas City, Missouri, has been home to KCU for over 100 years. Throughout our history, we’ve built strong community ties, particularly in our historic northeast neighborhood. Now, KCU is proud to call Joplin, Missouri, a second home.\n\nPreparing you to answer the call\n\nYour dream may be to make a difference in the life sciences as a physician, psychologist, dentist, researcher or scientist. Our drive is to help you realize that dream by providing the highest quality educational programs that prepare you to meet the heath care needs of the future.
