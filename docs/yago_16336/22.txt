Brace yourselves: Zack Morris and Kelly Kapowski — the fictional couple that melted young hearts in the ’90s on “Saved by the Bell” — are probably divorced, says executive producer Peter Engel.

During a recent interview with TVLine, Engel gave a rundown of where he thinks each member of the show would be today and said he didn’t believe the the pair would have stayed together.

“Probably not,” he said. “Well, they’d be married — but not to each other.”

Some fans of the show will likely blame the botched marriage on the fact that Zack and Kelly — played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Tiffani Thiessen, respectively— tied the knot in Las Vegas just one year after graduating from Bayside High.

Those who remember “Saved by the Bell: The College Years” would probably point to Kelly’s affair with her anthropology professor and say Zack should have never popped the question to begin with.

Engel — who is promoting his new memoir “I Was Saved by the Bell: Stories of Life, Love, and Dreams That Do Come True” — said Kelly likely has children now and “her own cooking show on the Food Network,” much like Thiessen.

“Zack would probably be the host of a game show or talk show, or he’d be managing a hedge fund,” he added. “Slater would be a high school football coach, Screech would be Bill Gates, Jessie would have just lost to Donald Trump [and] Lisa would probably be Vera Wang, or a buyer at Neiman Marcus.”
