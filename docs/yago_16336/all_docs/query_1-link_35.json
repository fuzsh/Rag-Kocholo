So who did Zack said \"I do\" to over the weekend? Sadly, not to Kelly Kapowski.\n\nMark-Paul exchanged vows with advertising executive Catriona McGinn at the Sunstone Winery in Santa Ynez, California. Before the wedding, Mark-Paul told People that he was very involved in the planning.\n\n\"I'm too type-A to let it happen around me,\" he said. \"We're trying to make it as traditional as possible. It's going to be fun!\"\n\nHere's a peek at the Neil Lane engagement ring he proposed with last year.\n\nPost-wedding, the two are planning on \"eating our assess off\" in Italy.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nThoughts on Zack Morris' wedding? How do we feel about that engagement ring?\n\nThe ring is pretty enough, but I feel like I'm getting a little bored with Neil Lane engagement rings with platinum halo settings! (Exhibit A. Exhibit B. Exhibit C.)\n\nMore celebrity wedding stuff:\n\nMichelle Williams and Jason Segel Are NOT Engaged (Yet!)
