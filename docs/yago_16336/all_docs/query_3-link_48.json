        "text": "Tiffani Thiessen is celebrating the 27th wedding anniversary of her \"Saved by the Bell\" character, Kelly Kapowski, with longtime love interest Zack Morris, portrayed by Mark-Paul Gosselaar.\n\nNearly three decades ago, Thiessen's character married Morris on the two-hour movie finale of the series, which ran for four seasons from 1989 to 1993. To mark the occasion, the actress posted a snap with Gosselaar on her Instagram page Thursday.\n\n\"Happy 27th Anniversary Kelly & Zach! Way to keep the love going. #friendsforever #tbt,\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nIn July, the actress posted a throwback photo showing her and fellow \"Saved by the Bell\" alumni Lark Voorhies and Elizabeth Berkley. In the picture, the celebrities can be seen posing for the camera while wearing stylish hats.\n\nIn the caption, she noted, \"#tbt We should have formed a band. Waitâ€¦\"\n\nThiessen reprised her role as Kelly in the show's reboot, which premiered on Peacock in November 2020.\n\nThe actress plays a supportive wife to Morris who returns to the show as the governor of California. His character closes down several low-income schools and sends the students to better-performing schools, including Bayside High.\n\nThiessen only had nice things to say about the reboot, its creator Tracey Wigfield and the new wave of actors who are taking over the show.\n\n\"Tracey, who created the show, has done an amazing job. It's funny, it's witty, but it has a ton of heart and the new kids are amazing,\" she told Entertainment Tonight in a March interview. \"They're super, super talented and for me, personally, it was fun to go back and play Kelly and work with Mark-Paul and deal with the whole Zack-Kelly thing. It was actually a lot of fun.\"\n\nThiessen, who was only 15 when \"Saved by the Bell\" was launched, also shared her thoughts about her co-stars who are actually older than roles they are playing. According to her, they are at the right age to handle fame and success and navigate the world of entertainment."
