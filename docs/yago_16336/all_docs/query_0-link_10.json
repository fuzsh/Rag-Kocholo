        "text": "Post by sternrogers01 on\n\n...According to Peter Engel\n\nIt seems not every ’90s TV couple is destined to end up like Full House‘s Becky and Jesse, or even Boy Meets World‘s Cory and Topanga.\n\nDuring a recent interview with Saved by the Bell executive producer Peter Engel, TVLine learned that Zack Morris and Kelly Kapowski — Bayside High School’s class couple of 1993, who went on to elope in Las Vegas just one year after graduation — simply weren’t built to last.\n\n“Probably not,” Engel said when asked if Zack and Kelly would still be married today. “Well, they’d be married — but not to each other.”\n\nOnce you’ve processed that revelation, here’s a rundown of where Engel thinks each member of the Bayside Six (sorry, Tori!) would be today:\n\nZack would probably be the host of a game show or talk show, or he’d be managing a hedge fund; Slater would be a high school football coach; Screech would be Bill Gates; Jessie would have just lost to Donald Trump; Lisa would probably be Vera Wang, or a buyer at Neiman Marcus; and Kelly would be married with children and have a cooking show on the Food Network, which [Tiffani Thiessen] has — and I watch!\n\ntvline.com/2016/12/01/saved-by-the-bell-zack-kelly-divorced-peter-engel-interview/\n\nPost by Allie Kitsune on\n\nZack couldn't have a chance as a game show host, as he wasn't a former stand-up comedian or washed-up sitcom star (within the SBTB universe of course).\n\nIf anything, Zack would be a sleazy divorce lawyer or personal injury lawyer.\n\nOr used car salesman.\n\nPost by Reflecto on\n\nZack couldn't have a chance as a game show host, as he wasn't a former stand-up comedian or washed-up sitcom star (within the SBTB universe of course).\n\nHe WAS head of \"Zack Attack\", so he was a one-hit wonder...he could have snuck in the same way Mark McGrath managed to get through the game show host foot in the door, though...\n\nPost by sfvega on\n\nImagine Zack Morris crying over his 11th beer in a row while everyone in the bar moans that \"Friends Forever\" plays over the jukebox yet again.\n\n7 \"Friends Forever\" followed by one \"It's Not Unusual\" and right back to \"Friends Forever\"\n\nPost by SHAKEMASTER TV9 is Don Knotts on\n\nZack couldn't have a chance as a game show host, as he wasn't a former stand-up comedian or washed-up sitcom star (within the SBTB universe of course).\n\nHe WAS head of \"Zack Attack\", so he was a one-hit wonder...he could have snuck in the same way Mark McGrath managed to get through the game show host foot in the door, though...\n\nBut that was all a dream though. By the college years his career trajectory wasn't game show host, which by the mid-90s was not a high profile job anymore, they weren't on primetime.\n\nI second him being a lawyer. Probably try to scam his way to a win, but Kelly convinced him to do things the right way and it all ends up well for him. Until the divorce I guess.\n\nPost by chazraps on\n\nZack and Kelly are divorced. Doug and Patti never got together. Love is a lie, 90s kids.\n\nThat couple who met on The Real World are still married and happy."
