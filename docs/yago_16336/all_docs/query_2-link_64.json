        "text": "To celebrate the upcoming 30-year anniversary of the teen sitcom “Saved by the Bell,” its cast broke bread for a reunion dinner this past weekend.\n\nThe gathering included cast members Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Zack Morris), Mario Lopez (A.C. Slater), Tiffani Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski) and Elizabeth Berkley (Jessie Spano), although a couple of former students of the fictional Bayside High School, Screech Powers (Dustin Diamond) and Lisa Turtle (Lark Voorhies), were AWOL.\n\nThe group posted several photos on Instagram, including one from Thiessen that was captioned “Friends forever…,” referencing a song by the show’s fictional band, Zack Attack.\n\nSpouses were also welcome, as Thiessen was joined at the dinner party by her husband Brady Smith, as was Lopez’s wife Courtney Laine Mazza, who commented on Thiessen’s group pic, “I’m so full. I can’t move.”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BwgSPW3pPCp/?utm_source=ig_embed\n\nLopez also posted a video of the gang, joking in the caption, “Credit card roulette comin’ up!” along with the hashtag “#OldSchool.”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BwgSkUqHPbW/\n\nThis wasn’t the first time the cast has reunited. Lopez and Thiessen made cocktails together last August on “Ellen.”\n\n“Saved by the Bell” ran for four seasons from 1989 to 1992."
