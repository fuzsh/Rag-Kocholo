        "text": "Saved by the Bell is an American TV sitcom that was very popular in the 90s. So much so, it now has now reached cult classic status. If you haven’t seen it, it’s about a group of close friends in high school battling through their teenage years together.\n\nEvery millenial I know wanted to be like one of the three main girls – Kelly, Lisa or Jessy. Personally, I always wanted to be like Kelly Kapowski. I decided to re-do the characters as they would be in 2020, so here goes:\n\nJessie Spano\n\nHer character: Jessica “Jessie” Spano lives next door to her friend, Zack Morris, who regularly visits her by climbing through her window. Jessie is arguably the smartest in her friend group, though she has some controversial opinions. She is a second wave feminist. She is often the first to speak up when she feels something isn’t right. Jessie dated A.C. Slater, and were such an underrated couple throughout the show.\n\nEarrings / Cardigan / Band Tee / Jeans / Ankle Boots / Rucksack\n\nHer in 2020: I see Jessie as a confident girl who is very sure of herself, both in her actions and in her own skin. She is a firm believer in equality and campaigns for feminism. She has a blog where she notes down her sometimes controversial opinions on what’s happening in the world, as well as in conversations on Twitter. She loves crime documentaries. She’s the editor in chief of the school newspaper and yearbook and a straight A student. Her rebellious streak comes out in her fashion choices, such as a rock band tee.\n\nKelly Kapowski\n\nHer character: Kelly Kapowski was the head cheerleader and captain of the volleyball, swim, and softball teams at Bayside High. She’s a pretty, sporty, popular girl in school, though she was well liked, and certainly not a mean girl. During the later years of her time in high school, she started dating fellow student Zack Morris, and after an on / off relationship, the two eventually got married and lived happily ever after. True high school sweethearts. Awwww!\n\nCropped Hoodie / Sports Bra / Workout Leggings / Trainers\n\nHer in 2020: Kelly is sporty, so of course, she’s going to have an extensive wardrobe rammed full of yoga pants in all different colours and styles. She is a girlie girl and loves the colour pink. She instagrams everything, and goes to places just to get the perfect photo to add to her feed or story. She makes TikToks of her time in the gym and cheerleading. She’s a family girl, and likes being close to home. She’s writing a health and fitness blog, and hopes to have her own sportswear brand one day.\n\nLisa Turtle\n\nHer character: Lisa Turtle is trendy, outgoing and confident. She is the clique’s fashion expert and the gossip queen of Bayside High. She comes from a rich family; so she can have whatever she wants in terms of fashion. Lisa’s goal is to become a world famous fashion designer. Her child friend and fellow classmate, Screech, has a huge crush on her and is always looking for a chance to get the two together.\n\nFedora / Earrings / Tunic / Ankle Boots / Rucksack\n\nHer in 2020: Lisa is the number one customer of the bank of mum and dad. It’s how she can afford to wear things like those gorgeous Chloe boots. She’s memorised the card numbers, and is a regular shopper in stores like Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and House of Fraser. She’s a keen photographer. She wants to be a kept woman and is looking for a rich, handsome stranger to sweep her off her feet, and keep her in her designer labels. She shares photos of her outfits on her Facebook and Instagram. She tweets along with TV shows she watches and has been on Tinder longer than she cares to admit.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this how you see these girls in 2020? Please comment below."
