        "text": "When I was growing up, my favorite TV show was \"Saved by the Bell.\" Kelly Kapowski, played by Tiffani Amber Thiessen, was a legend to me and so many other girls.\n\nMy favorite episode? When Zach Morris and Kelly got married. Their love story was something so cute. Obviously things are much different now, but that show was super popular back when I was younger.\n\nTiffani and her beautiful family recently visited Maine.\n\nBy the look of the photos, they may be vacationing on Sebago Lake.\n\nShe says, \"Maine, you truly are one magical place. Thank you for giving us the most special week with our family. Until next time\"\n\nTiffani adored Maine, and the comments on her photos were lighting up with joy that she was here.\n\nI picture that she relaxed by the water, enjoyed some delicious lobster, and indulged in all the traditional Maine activities we know and love. It's always fun to see our favorite stars enjoying the same simple pleasures that make our state of Maine so special. According to her Facebook page, she was here for a full week.\n\nNow, back to Saved by The Bell. I can't talk about the Kelly Kapowski without sharing the legendary skit from Jimmy Fallon with the Saved by the Bell crew.\n\nTo this day, I watch and laugh so hard. It was an absolute blast from the past and so nostalgic.\n\nHe reunited the original cast members, and portrayed a student and went back to Bayside High!\n\nGuys, it was perfect comedic timing and the skit was filled with hilarious references to classic episodes, quirky '90s fashion, and memorable catchphrases.\n\nSo, when any cast member from our beloved '90s television shows visits Maine and falls in love with it, we have to share the news!\n\nTiffani adored Maine and we can't wait for her to visit again soon!"
