        "text": "The schedule for the Character Review posts will be changing to Friday (or Saturday at the latest from now on).\n\n*I apologize for not posting last week. There is only so much energy in a day.\n\n*Warning: This post contains spoilers about the characters from the television show Saved by the Bell. Read at your own risk if you have not watched the program. There is something to be said about a well-written, human character. They leap off the page and speak to us as if they were right in front of us, as flesh and blood human beings, instead of fictional creations.\n\nThere is a stereotype about the high school cheerleader. She is pretty, but there is nothing upstairs. She is also popular and usually the other half of one of the jocks.\n\nIn Saved by the Bell, Kelly Kapowski (Tiffani Thiessen) is an all-American girl and the head cheerleader at Bayside High School. In addition to the cheerleading squad and being on top of her schoolwork, Kelly is also a member of several sports teams. One of seven children, she is used to financial stress and has learned to make do with what she has.\n\nWhile in high school, Kelly has a series of romantic relationships. After she chooses Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) over A.C. Slater (Mario Lopez), their relationship is on and off for a number of years. After college, they decide to elope in Las Vegas, to the chagrin of their parents.\n\nWhen we last see Kelly, she and Zack are still together and have a teenage son.\n\nTo sum it up: Kelly is intelligent, compassionate, driven, and not bowed down by life’s challenges. Though she is sometimes not the smartest book in the library (but who isn’t sometimes?) it is her openness and genuineness that had endeared her to generations of fans.\n\nWhich is why she is a memorable character."
