        "text": "Tiffani Thiessen began modeling and acting when she was just 8 years old—her first commercial was for Peaches and Cream Barbie—but it wasn't until her breakout role as the all-American cheerleader Kelly Kapowski on Saved by the Bell that she became a household name. The actress appeared on the sitcom until its final season and joined the spinoff, Saved by the Bell: The College Years.\n\nElizabeth Berkley was first drawn to show business through dance. In 1988, she appeared in her first movie, Frog, and picked up small parts until her big break as Jessie Spano in Saved by the Bell. She appeared on the show until its fourth and final season, but did not reprise her role for the spinoff.\n\nWhen her role on the popular sitcom ended, Berkley made the jump to film. In 1995, she landed a role in the film Showgirls and the following year appeared in The First Wives Club, alongside Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, Bette Midler, and Sarah Jessica Parker. The actress has also starred in both CSI: Miami and The L Word, and most recently published a New York Times best-selling book, Ask Elizabeth.\n\nOriginally from Nashville, Tennessee, Lark Voorhies started acting at 11 years old. Her first major role was in Saved by the Bell as Lisa Marie Turtle. She was on the show until the end of the series, but also appeared on Days of Our Lives, The Bold and the Beautiful, and In the House during her stint on Saved By the Bell.\n\nThe former cast member hasn't stayed in touch with her costars and recently aired her feelings on The Dr. Oz Show about not being included in the NBC reboot. The actress has also been open about her struggle with mental health and her battle with Bipolar Disorder.\n\nSince the show ended, Diamond has had a series of personal and professional setbacks. In 2006, he directed and released his own sex tape, featuring himself and two other women, though he later stated that he used a body double for the explicit scenes. A few years later, he released a book Behind the Bell, in which he discusses his time on set. His former castmates were upset at the allegations that they mistreated him and remain estranged from him. And in 2014, Diamond was arrested for stabbing a man in a bar fight, was sent to jail for three months, and placed on parole. Today, the comedian remains out of the spotlight and will not appear in the reboot series.\n\nBefore he was the goofy principal at Bayside High, Dennis Haskins worked as a music manager and talent agent. He later got into TV with roles on The Twilight Zone and Magnum P.I., but his role as Principal Belding on Saved by the Bell was his most well-known.\n\nSaved by the Bell's TV movie was emotional enough without a surprise visit from their mentor, Principal Belding. Yep, Haskins returned for an appearance in the spinoff and reprised his role for a skit on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon in 2015. Haskins has steadily appeared in minor roles in both television and film since the show ended.\n\nAlonzo's character was written off of the show after writers realized who was watching. \"It became apparent that we were appealing to the teens,\" creator Peter Engel told Today. \"We didn’t need that type.\" Alonzo moved on to roles on sitcoms like Full House and Murphy Brown, and most recently appeared on Modern Family.\n\nAfter her spot on Saved by the Bell, Remini landed a starring role in The King of Queens, alongside Kevin James. The show was a huge success and ran from 1998 until 2007. In 2013, Remini left the Church of Scientology and has since been a critic and activist against the religion, appearing in the award winning docu-series, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath. Most recently, she starred in The Second Act alongside Jennifer Lopez."
