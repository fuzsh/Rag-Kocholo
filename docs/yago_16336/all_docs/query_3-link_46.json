        "text": "The executive producer of Saved By The Bell has admitted he thinks the show’s central romance wasn’t built to last.\n\nKelly Kapowski (Tiffani-Amber Thiessen) and Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) were voted Bayside High’s class couple of 1993. Viewers later saw them getting married in Las Vegas.\n\nHowever, executive producer Peter Engel has claimed their relationship would eventually have fizzled out. When TVLine asked if Kelly and Zack would still be married in 2016, Engel replied: “Probably not. Well, they’d be married — but not to each other.”\n\nEngel also gave his thoughts on what each of the show’s main characters would be up to now. “Zack would probably be the host of a game show or talk show, or he’d be managing a hedge fund; Slater would be a high school football coach; Screech would be Bill Gates; Jessie would have just lost to Donald Trump.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued: “Lisa would probably be Vera Wang, or a buyer at Neiman Marcus; and Kelly would be married with children and have a cooking show on the Food Network, which [Tiffani Thiessen] has — and I watch!”\n\nREAD MORE: The Stars Of ‘Saved By The Bell’ – Where Are They Now?\n\nRecommended\n\nMeanwhile, Mark-Paul Gosselaar has recently apologised for a “racist” episode of the show that has always haunted him: ‘Running Zack’ from November 1990, which tells the story of Zack Morris’ apparent Native American ancestry.\n\nEarlier this year, the restaurant in which ‘Saved By The Bell’ was partly set opened for real – take a look inside here."
