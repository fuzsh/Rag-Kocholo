Mark, who also serves as the shows executive producer, revealed he will be in at least three episodes. For Tiffani, Mark says, “As far as I know, she will be in an episode or two with me.” Mark also explained why he’ll only be in a few episodes, “It wasn’t necessarily because of our desire to do it. It was more of a commitment to other things. The fact that ABC is allowing me to do something for NBC, I’m super gracious that they’re allowing me to do that.” Mark currently has a full-time role on Mixed-ish.\n\nJust last year, NBC Universal broke the news about their plans to launch Peacock, a brand new streaming service and a Saved by the Bell revival would be the first (or one of the first shows) to debut on their new service. At the time Mark told Variety, “I read it in the trades just like everybody else this morning. Honestly, I was never approached. I woke up to the news this morning with a kind of ‘huh’ response.”\n\nSince then, the news surrounding the revival show have been confirmed and Mark is back in the hot seat, getting in Zach mode. Mark posted a photo on Instagram with the caption reading, “One of these blondes is going be Zack Morris.”\n\nThe original Saved by the Bell began in 1989 and wrapped in 1993. he show followed six high school students and their principal, Mr. Belding. The show then had two-spin off series: Saved by the Bell: The College Years and Saved by the Bell: The New Class. The series also had two films, Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style and Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas.\n\nAccording to ET Canada, “In the reboot, grown-up Zack is now governor of California, whose decision to close down numerous low-income schools throughout the state sends the students in those schools to higher-performing schools, including Bayside.”"
