        "text": "That he is a saint.\n\nNote that everybody in the documentary -even the former assistant of the late cardinal Suenens- treated this with mild skepticism. The former assistant -Guido Heybraut- did add that the king was like a shepherd: 'who tried to steer his flock to green pastures. But he can not do more, he can't force his sheep to eat.'\n\nNote that cardinal Danneels also elaborates about the 'secret of the king'. It is discussed in the fourth part of the documentary. Also note the speech on behalf of a victim of human trafficking & forced prostitution during the funeral service.\n\nIn the last years of his reign the king read a book by a journalist on the matter, which shocked him deeply. I still remember reading in the newspaper how the king had his limousine stopped in a dodgy part of Antwerp, where he spoke to the victims. He tried to use his influence decision makers, he attended meetings to push them into action.\n\nThe journalist -Chris de Stoop- shares an anecdote in the documentary how he was invited to the palace to discuss his findings. The night before he had a bit to much to drink in the café and upon arrival home he fell from the stairs. The king saw the wound on his forehead and declared that it could not be a coincidence, the day before a nephew fell in a hole on the palace grounds (Amedeo I suspect, as prince Joachim would have barely been able to walk in 1992), 'it must be the work of the devil, he pushed you off the stairs because you are fighting for the good'.\n\nPart 4:\n\nI have read extensively in French and English on the life of his late Majesty, and while I am convinced of his inherent decency and especially his passionate love for Christ, I am not quite sure that I believe he was a saint.\n\nAfter his marriage and especially toward the end of his short life his life he was certainly moving toward sanctity, however.\n\nMuch thanks Marengo. ?\n\nI saw King Felipe paying respect to the sitting statue of King Baudouin in the Courtyard of Villa Astrida in Motril and next was a simple white plastic chair.\n\nyesterday on TV we were told the last day of our beloved King.\n\nThe King was so often sitting on a terrace on the white plastic chair where He could see everything and nobody could seee him.\n\nOn 31 July after being on his boat during hot hours (not good for his heart) he was sitting on his terrace.\n\nThe clock said \"diner time\" but the King did not come. He often did not come , so they waited waited and then \"his garde de corps\" went to the terrace and saw the King dead. There is no hospital in Motril. They asked a Cardiolog to come and he said the King died a long time ago from a heart attack. The hour of his dead was the hour when his dead body was found 21 .30 pm\n\nWe saw for the first time inside the villa Astrida the statue representing our King on holiday in Motril . He is sitting and is dressed how he was at Motril, completely different as in Belgium.\n\nWe saw this Evening on RTL a film : Baudouin , les derniers jours very moving and interesting. We saw for the first time the inside of the Villa Astrida in Motril and even their Bedroom. Also films with Fabiola spanish family.\n\nThen we saw again how the so sad and unexpected news and the events that happened 30 yeard ago.\n\nI recall I was utterly shocked when I heard the news,seemed incredible,unbelieveble as the week before he was here in NL for a State Visit.Really a shock.\n\nThankfully I received his what we call `bidprentje`,a small photo with a mini obituary.His funeral was impressive,all the Royal and Imperial guests ...well almost all...walked behind the coffin through the streets from the Palace to the Cathedral.I say almost all,as HM Queen Elisabeth II was taken to the cathedral directly from the airport that morning.As a Reigning Monarch she attended the funeral of another Reigning Monarch,as one does and is done.\n\nBut the Emperor and Empress of Japan didn´t think it beneath themselves to walk either,an impressive sight,as all joined Queen Fabiola walking through Brussels.I have regularly visited his tomb,or rather their tomb,at Laeken since."
