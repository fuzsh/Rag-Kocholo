        "text": "Immediate success for the tallest tower in the world\n\nThe 1889 Exposition Universelle received millions of visitors. Amongst them, 1,953,122 came to see the Eiffel Tower, in other words almost 12,000 a day! The Tower was met with immediate success.\n\nFrom the very first week, though the lifts were not yet in service (they would be from the 26th May), almost 30,000 visitors climbed the monument using the staircase, that is to say 1,710 steps to the top !\n\nAt the time, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest tower in the world and people from all countries went to the heart of the French Capital to admire this architectural masterpiece.\n\nThe public hurried to experience not only the dizzy heights of the ascent, but above all an unprecedented view over Paris, since no one had yet seen the view from an aeroplane.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower has attracted among its copious number of celebrity visitors the French actress Sarah Bernhardt, the Prince of Wales (future King Edward VII) and the Princess of Wales, George I of Greece, le Shah of Persia, Prince Baudouin and other, more unexpected guests such as one certain American: he had long hair, a broad hat and tan-coloured chaps. It was William F. Cody, known by the name of Buffalo Bill.\n\nOn the 10th July, the President of the French Republic, Sadi Carnot, very satisfied with his visit, offered a sum of 200 Francs to the Eiffel Tower employees and a sum of 100 Francs to the Figaro printing staff!\n\nSend your letters by balloon!\n\nAn unusual attraction was proposed to the public : send your letters by balloon! In its edition : \" Imprimée dans la Tour Eiffel\" (\"Printed on the Eiffel Tower\") on the 29th August, Le Figaro reported: \"the Tower’s company is doing its utmost to increase the number of attractions in favour of its clientele. It has just decided to soon put up for sale, on all of the Tower’s floors, small balloons and cheap parachutes arranged in such a way that one can attach a letter to them. The sender’s address will be left blank. We wish the Tower’s parachutes the same success as its postcards! \". Indeed, the Eiffel Tower was to thank for the increasing popularity of the postcard in France, and it was at the request of visitors in 1889 that the Tower's administration put the renowned \"Libonis\" on sale, named after its famous engraver. The oldest postmark stamped on a postcard showing the Eiffel Tower is the 21st August 1889."
