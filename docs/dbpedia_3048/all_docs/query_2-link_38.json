        "text": "Paris – Bonhams announces the appointment of Baudouin de Reviers as Wine Specialist for Continental Europe based in France. Baudouin will take up this role with immediate effect (10 June 2024).\n\nFollowing the success of the first Wine and Spirit sales in Paris in 2021 and the more recent appointment of Amayès Aouli as Global Head of Wine and Spirits, Baudouin's appointment marks the continued growth of Bonhams' Wine Department in Europe.\n\nUnder the direction of Amayès, Baudouin will work closely with Oliver Wiseman, Senior Specialist for Wine, and Laurent Latil, Sale Coordinator.\n\nBaudouin de Reviers, Bonhams' Wine Specialist in Paris, commented: \"I am delighted to join Bonhams' Wine Department and look forward to using my experience and knowledge to deliver great wine sales and projects in Europe.\"\n\nAmayès Aouli, Bonhams' Global Head of Wine and Spirits, said: \"It is a great pleasure to welcome Baudouin to the team. With a wealth of international experience in both the wine and auction worlds, his solid knowledge will strengthen Bonhams' European wine expertise and enable Europe's finest collections to find a global stage.\"\n\nBorn in Champagne, Baudouin completed his studies at KEDGE Business School in Bordeaux where he received a master's in Wine Management. He went on to work for Château Coutet in Barsac, France and Pernod-Ricard in Mexico. After two years at Idealwine in Hong Kong, Baudouin worked for Château de Pommard in Burgundy, France, before then joining Sotheby's Wine in 2021 as a specialist.\n\nBaudouin speaks French, English and Spanish."
