        "text": "In 1064 in England, King Edward is still without heirs. Very attached to Normandy where he found refuge for 30 years, he naturally turns to William to predict his succession to the throne.\n\nBetrayed by Harold, his vassal, William became King of England after the Battle of Hastings in 1066. He settled his power and founded a powerful Anglo-Norman kingdom. The Conqueror establishes an inventory of the men and wealth of the country (The Domesday Book) and creates many buildings including the Tower of London, erected with stones of Caen. Before dying in 1087, he settled his succession and entrusted to two of his sons the Duchy of Normandy and the Kingdom of England. William and his wife Mathilda both are burried in Caen in the abbeys they founded. The descendants of William reign over Normandy and England until 1204, date of the attachment of the duchy to the royal domain of France.\n\nAt the core of the Bayeux Tapestry’s narrative is William, the seventh Duke of Normandy, who ascended as the Conqueror after being crowned in England on Christmas Day of 1066. He became one of the most formidable monarchs in Western Europe during the Middle Ages. Born illegitimately in Falaise in 1027 to Robert the Magnificent, Duke of Normandy, he was commonly known as William the Bastard.\n\nMatilda of Flanders married William, Duke of Normandy, in 1050 at Rouen (France). She was a distant cousin, the daughter of Count Baldwin V of Flanders. Their marriage was initially forbidden by the Pope due to consanguinity, yet it proceeded nonetheless. To receive the Church’s absolution, William consented to establish two abbeys in Caen: the Abbey of Sainte-Trinité (the Ladies’ Abbey) and the Abbey of Saint-Étienne (the Men’s Abbey). Often referred to as “Queen Matilda’s Tapestry,” the origin of the Bayeux Tapestry has been romantically linked to this notion of a grieving “Penelope,” embroidering in wait for her Duke husband’s return."
