        "text": "Fiat 125 Years: La Dolce Vita\n\nIn 1899 Fiat is born. It marks 125 years of the 'Sweet Life' of beautiful Italian cars. Fast cars also, often made even faster by Carlo Abarth. Autoworld celebrates both brands from the 4th of July untill the 1st of September.\n\nTo the Expo\n\nAbarth - 75 Years\n\nCarlo Abarth, the man behind the famous scorpion brand, had speed in his DNA. He knew how to turn that DNA into technical ingenuity like no other. Abarth, often mentioned in the same breath as Fiat, knew how to squeeze performance out of any car, often resulting in success on race tracks or in rallies. The scorpion brand turns 75 this year and Autoworld is honouring the founding father of tuning from 4 July to 1 September during their 'Dolce Vita' summer.\n\nTo the expo\n\nWhen automotive design becomes art\n\nCan a car be considered art? It all depends on your definition of art. By the Bauhaus streak, it was argued that art can also have a function, rather than just being a work of art in itself. With that in mind, there are enough arguments to consider automobiles as art, more than a means of transportation. Let alone cars being used as a canvas or being the subject of art. From the 7/9 to 15/12, Autoworld recites the car as an art object in 'When Cars Become Art.'\n\nTo the Expo\n\nRoyal Cadillac series 62\n\nIn 1954, the Belgian Royal Palace’s car fleet expanded significantly with the addition of this Cadillac Series 62 convertible, which became the official parade vehicle. Featuring specifications ahead of its time for 1955, it proudly bore the Belgian number plate “1” and was predominantly used by King Baudouin. This iconic car would not only mark royal milestones but also be part of some of the most memorable moments in Belgian history.\n\nRead more\n\nVisit Brasserie Bagnole\n\nAfter your visit to Autoworld, indulge in a delicious lunch or small bite at Brasserie Bagnole. In addition to lunch, an extensive menu of delightful sweets is available! All with a view of the temporary exhibition!\n\nTo Brasserie Bagnole"
