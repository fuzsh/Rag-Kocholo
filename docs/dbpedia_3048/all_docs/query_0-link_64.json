        "text": "The forthcoming wedding of the crown prince to a fetching bourgeoise has given the country something to smile about after a monumental series of national scandals and crises. The government hopes the marriage on Dec. 4 will revive national pride and perhaps halt what many observers see as the slow fragmentation of Belgium.\n\nThe monarchy is one of the few institutions widely accepted by both the Dutch-speaking Flemings in the north and the French speakers in the southern Wallonia region and the French-speaking enclave of Brussels. The reasoning is that anything that strengthens the monarchy also strengthens the tenuous bonds between north and south. But at the same time, Belgium's bipolar tensions are being highlighted by the country's fourth major institutional revision since the 1960s, which began this month.\n\nFollowing a centuries-old custom, Prince Philippe and his fiancée, Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz, are making a series of ceremonial visits, known as joyeuses entrees, to the towns that may one day form part of their realm.\n\nIn this pluvious country, however, it seems that a little rain must fall on every parade. The media have latched onto rumors of an indiscretion more than 30 years ago by the prince's father, King Albert II. The buzz is that the king has an out-of-wedlock daughter in London, a 31-year-old artist named Delphine.\n\nLong before Albert acceded to the throne on the death of his brother, Baudouin, in 1993, there were rumors of a rift between Albert and his Italian-born queen, Paola. These rumors were floating around again a couple of years ago but were largely ignored. Now that they have surfaced in a one-line reference in book about Queen Paola by an 18-year-old author who can hardly be described as a serious historian, the question is: Why is the press making so much fuss about the stories?\n\nOne answer, supplied by a French-speaking historian, Francis Balace, is that the book — \"Paola — From the Dolce Vita to Queen\" — which was published only in Dutch, has been promoted by nationalist or separatist elements in Flanders to counter the royal wedding feel-good factor. The author, Mario Daneels, denies any contact with the Flemish nationalists.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
