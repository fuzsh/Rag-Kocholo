Susan Lucci, born Dec. 23, 1946, got her big break in the role of Erica Kane on All My Children in 1970 (for which this portrait was taken). She would go on to play the role for 41 years, until the show ended in 2011.

The actress had many memorable moments on the show, and that includes 11 weddings (if you count her re-marriages to the same men, and one vow renewal). Here's one from 1978, to Richard Shoberg's Tom Cudahy ...

... and a 1993 wedding (her first of two) to Dimitri Marick (Michael Nader), which Lucci counts as one of her favorites: "We did a traditional ceremony with lots and lots of candles," she told PEOPLE of the lavish Russian Orthodox nuptials. "It was very beautiful."

Life doesn't imitate art for Lucci, though: She has been married to Helmut Huber since 1969. "Throwback to mid 70's/before babies—Dancing with my handsome husband at Club A!!! SO much fun!!!" she captioned this pic.

Her streak-busting win in 1999 not only landed her that coveted Emmy — she also nabbed the cover of PEOPLE! (And the gown she wore for the cover is now in the Smithsonian.)

Also in 2008, Lucci helped the cast of All My Children ring in their 10,000th episode — and it marked a milestone for her as well, when she joined the rarefied club of soap opera stars who played their character for more than 40 years.

All My Children's cancellation didn't slow Lucci down one bit. She landed recurring roles on shows including Hot in Cleveland and Devious Maids (pictured).

In 2018, the star, then 72, made a serious splash when she was photographed in a strapless red one-piece in Barbados. The Internet buzz was so big, she ended up posing in this swimsuit for Harper's Bazaar that year. And though she works hard to stay in shape (she swears by this Pilates chair!), she says a lot of her ageless appearance is due to her mindset.

"People look at me and say 'Wow, she doesn't seem old, but she is old,' " she told PEOPLE. "Meanwhile, the reality is if you're strong, you're beautiful, no matter what age you are."

The star (pictured here at the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women Red Dress Collection fashion show in 2020) is also a big advocate for heart disease education, after discovering a 90 percent blockage in one of her arteries in 2018 despite her daily exercise regimen and healthy diet.

"I want to do some good with what I've been through," Lucci told PEOPLE. "If I can help in any real way, I want to. Everyone's symptoms are different but I felt compelled to share mine. Even if it's one person I help, that's someone's life."

The actress continues to stay busy (did we mention her QVC line?) and shares many of her fun adventures on Instagram. Will she ever retire? "Retirement is not even in my vocabulary," she told Closer Weekly.
