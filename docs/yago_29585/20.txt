Susan Lucci may be legendary for her four decades as Erica Kane on ABC's "All My Children" (1970-2011), but that's certainly not all she's done. Among her other big gigs:

MAFIA PRINCESS (1986 NBC movie) -- At the height of the networks' docudrama craze, Lucci grabbed great ratings as mob boss Sam Giancana's daughter. Tony Curtis played her dad.

LADY MOBSTER (1988 ABC movie) -- She went all out to avenge her dead parents. Her co-star: Michael Nader, who, as "All My Children's" Dimitri Marick, married Erica Kane twice.

DALLAS (1990-91 CBS series) -- Producers hired "the Larry Hagman of daytime" to provoke Bobby and J.R. Ewing in the nighttime soap's final network season.

EBBIE (1995 Lifetime movie) -- Feminized update of "A Christmas Carol" starred Lucci as mean department store boss Elizabeth "Ebbie" Scrooge.

DANCING WITH THE STARS (2008 ABC) -- Lucci lost to current "DWTS" co-host Brooke Burke Charvet, coming in sixth (ahead of Cloris Leachman and Kim Kardashian).
