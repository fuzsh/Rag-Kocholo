        "text": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Devane Marick is a fictional character from All My Children, an American soap opera on the ABC network. The role was portrayed by Finola Hughes from 1999 to 2001. The character is the twin sister of fan favorite General Hospital character Anna Devane, who Hughes also brought to All My Children from 2001 to 2003. In 2017, Hughes reprised the role on General Hospital, when Alex began posing as Anna, and continued in the role until 2021. Finola Hughes was cast as Alexandra Devane in 1999. At first, it was unknown what character she would portray. Alexandra debuted on July 23, 1999. Hughes left in the fall of 2000 for maternity leave and returned in February 2001. Alex left on July 9, 2001, to Budapest, Hungary. Hughes reprised her role as Alexandra on General Hospital, beginning April 5, 2017, masquerading as Anna; the duplicity wasn't revealed until May 12, 2017. Hughes ended her reprisal role of Alexandra on June 8, 2017. Hughes reprised the role from March 18 to 21, 2019. In 2020, Hughes once again reprised the role of Alex while portraying Anna from October 30 to November 9. Alexandra and new husband, Dimitri Marick, were headed back to town from London to break the news of their marriage. Before they could tell the good news, Dimitri fell ill and subsequently died. She elected to remain hidden at the airport while Dimitri and his loved ones traveled to Seaview Hospital to see if there was anything the doctors could do to resurrect Dimitri. Alex finally made her presence known when Edmund Grey asked that an autopsy be done on his brother to determine the cause of his death. Alex stepped forward and announced an autopsy would not be performed. Edmund said he was Dimitri's brother and would decide what was to be done. It was then Alex dropped the bombshell that she was the new Mrs Marick. Erica Kane did not take well to the news Dimitri had found another lover. Many doubted Alex's sincerity and feelings for Dimitri, but Peggy and Brooke English both could see the affection in her eyes."
