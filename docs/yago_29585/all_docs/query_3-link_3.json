        "text": "Inspired by a conversation/argument with a friend, my personal ranking of the many love interests of the one and only Ms. Kane*:\n\n1. Dimitri Marick - I started watching the show in 1994 and always liked Erica with Dimitri (well, until he slept with Maria, then it was kind of ruined). I've recently been watching what I can find of the 80s and 90s and have finally seen the beginning of this relationship and it's reconfirmed how much I like them as a couple. They're so glamorous and dramatic together.\n\n2. Jack Montgomery (1989-91) - the first go-round of Erica and Jack was so sexy and fun that it's easy to understand why the show kept returning to the well.\n\n3. Adam Chandler - not a love match, but Susan Lucci and David Canary were gold together. Their second marriage was greatly entertaining, even though it feels like it came about as a back up plan after the actor who was playing Charlie was let go.\n\n4. David Hayward - I've heard that they were broken up because TPTB wanted Erica to be single while playing out Bianca's coming out story. I wish they'd gotten them back together rather than putting David with Dixie.\n\n5. Mike Roy - I haven't been able to see any of their relationship in the 80s, but I enjoyed their rapport when he returned briefly in the late 90s.\n\n6. Jack Montgomery (2003-2006) - I have a great fondness for this period of their relationship, if only for the family scenes that also included Bianca, Kendall, Greenlee, and Reggie.\n\n7. Jeremy Hunter - this is just such a classic, OTT soap opera relationship. Every time I think of Erica stuck on the collapsing fire escape while Jeremy swings towards her in slow motion, or Erica getting onto the ladder of the helicopter, it just puts a smile on my face.\n\n8. Travis Montgomery - Lucci and Larkin Malloy had good chemistry, but he could be such an ass. You got Barbara pregnant, dude. You don't get to be sanctimonious about Erica's fling with Jack.\n\n9. Jack Montgomery (1998) - their brief reunion, broken up when Erica had closure sex (or whatever you want to call it) with Mike Roy.\n\n10. Charlie Brent - the relationship never got far off the ground and the actor was there and gone in a flash, but I can see why the show gave it a try since it played into so much history.\n\n11. Chris Stamp - I never cared for Chris or really understood why Erica was with him other than the fact that he was played by Jack Scalia.\n\n12. Jeff Martin (2006 version) - blah. We all knew it was coming when they brought Jeff back to town, but it felt so forced and it was part of that terrible abortion retcon.\n\n13. Jack Montgomery (1994) - less a relationship than a straight up plot device that functioned to break up Jack and Laurel and delay Erica and Dimitri's reunion.\n\n14. [Literally anyone]\n\n15. Ryan Lavery - what even was this? This was about the time I stopped watching the show.\n\n* I've never seen Erica's relationships with Chuck Tyler, Phil Brent, Nick Davis, original Jeff Martin, Jason Maxwell, Tom Cudahy, Brandon Kingsley, Kent Bogard."
