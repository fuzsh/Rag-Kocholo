        "text": "He was 76.\n\nNader died in his Northern California home with his wife Jodi Lister and their rescue dog Storm by his side, his manager Richard Schwartz confirmed.\n\n“With heavy heart, I’m sharing the news of the passing of my beloved, Michael,” Lister said via a statement. “He was a beautiful and fascinating man with many talents and skills. I will miss him forever.”\n\nLister and Nader were married for nearly two decades: “We had 18 wonderful years together with the many dogs we fostered and adopted.”\n\nNader played Dex Dexter, the third husband of Joan Collins’ character Alexis Colby, on the primetime ABC soap opera “Dynasty” from 1983 to 1989. The cast reunited in March for a virtual fundraiser for research into COVID-19 survivors experiencing long-haul symptoms, like “Dynasty” star Emma Samms."
