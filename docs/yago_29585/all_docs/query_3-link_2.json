        "text": "Post by Principessa on\n\nThis is such an difficult question to answer. Assuming that most people are going to say that one-half of their favorite pairing was the love of Erica's life, I'm going to have to go with multiple people here.\n\nI think it's definitely possible to love multiple people in your lifetime and that you might not find your \"one true love\" and I think that might be Erica.\n\nI would have to say that Jack came closer than any other man. They had a relationship that lasted on and off for over twenty years. They obviously ran back to each other for a reason, but I feel like if he WAS the love of her life, they wouldn't have broken up and gotten back together xx amount of times. Which I guess is typical, and is considered long-term soap relationship.\n\nAfter all, a soap would be boring if a pairing stayed together forever!\n\nPost by ellabelle on\n\nI think the love of Erica's life was ultimately Erica herself. She was obviously motivated later in the show to protect her children, but her primary motivation has always been her own self-interest. She's a deeply wounded, vulnerable, selfish person who wants all-encompassing love, but on her own terms. I think she wants to have that unconditional love from a man that she should have had from her father, but at the same time, I think she fears it and doesn't want to give too much of herself. She is willing to try to change for someone, but that's never going to last, so she has to be with someone who not only understands her but realizes that he can't change her or make her into something she's not. She's not going to be happy staying at home and baking cookies with her children or grandchildren all the time, no matter how much she may enjoy the occasional bout of domesticity.\n\nMike Roy, Dimitri Marick, and David Hayward all seemed to understand that. The relationship with Mike was doomed by his 'death' and unfortunately, by Nick Surovy's unwillingness to sign a long-term contract with AMC. If he'd been willing to stay on longer than 6 months in 1998, I think there's a darn good chance Erica would have chosen Mike. The relationship with Dimitri was ultimately doomed by circumstance - Kendall, Richard Fields, Erica's poor mental state, the trial, Anton, Erica's fall and the resulting drug addiction, Jonathan Kinder, Dimitri's one night stand with Maria, the loss of Erica's baby was all just too much for them to get past. I still believe they had a lot of unfinished business as a couple and that they would have eventually reconciled had ABC not fired Michael Nader for his drug problems. The relationship with David was brief in comparison to Dimitri or Jack, but he saw her in a way that a lot of other men didn't and still found her beautiful even when her face was scarred. He didn't really try to change her either, but I think they were both too hurt by life by that point to be willing to give in enough to make a relationship work long-term.\n\nWhen AMC ended on ABC in 2011, I was really irritated that Erica and Jack broke up (again) because I sort of assumed it would be left open ended - maybe they'd decide to go to Hollywood together and try to work it out. I felt like I'd been watching them try to get together and stay together for such a long time that it was kind of unsatisfying to see him get angry with her (again) because she wasn't what he wanted her to be (again) and then storm out on her (again), but enough time has passed that I'm okay with how it all ended. And honestly I think the ending with Erica on her own, surrounded by drama with her dreams just within her grasp but her still struggling romantically really IS true to her and to her story."
