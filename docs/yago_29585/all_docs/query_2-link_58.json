        "text": "Heartbreaking news to report this Wednesday morning. Michael Fairman TV has learned exclusively that Michael Nader, best known for his role as “Dex” Dexter on ABC’s original version of Dynasty, and as Dimitri Marick on All My Children, has died at the age of 76.\n\nNader passed away on Monday, August 23rd at 11:30am from an untreatable form of cancer at his home in Northern California with his wife, Jodi by his side, and Michael’s rescue dog, Storm.\n\nIn an exclusive statement to MFTV, Michael’s wife, Jodi Lister expressed: “With heavy heart, I’m sharing the news of the passing of my beloved, Michael. We had 18 wonderful years together with the many dogs we fostered and adopted. Recently, Michael was so thrilled to reconnect with his friends from the cast of Dynasty during Emma Samms virtual event to help raise funds for Long-Covid research. Michael was working on a book about his life and addiction at the time of his death. He was a beautiful and fascinating man with many talents and skills. I will miss him forever.”\n\nMichael’s acting career spanned several decades. His first soap role was that of Kevin Thompson on As the World Turns (1975-1978, then the primetime soap, Bare Essence (1983) as Alexi Theopolous, before landing on Dynasty later that year as Alexis Colby’s (Joan Collins) third husband, “Dex”. Nader remained with the series until its cancellation in 1989.\n\nWhen All My Children came calling, Michael took on the role of Erica Kane’s (Susan Lucci) magnetic husband, Dimitri Marick, a role he played from 1991-1999, then again in 2000-2001. Michael returned to AMC during Prospect Park’s online revival of the series in 2013.\n\nThroughout his TV and motion picture career Nader also appeared in: The Flash, Law and Order: SVU, Cold Case, Gidget, Beach Blanket Bingo, The Great Escape II: The Untold Story, Lady Mobster (with Susan Lucci) the miniseries, Lucky Charms, to name but a few.\n\nMichael is survived by his wife of 18-years, Jodi, stepmother Lillian, sister Stephanie, daughter Lindsay, ex-wife Robin, son-in-law Trevor, and granddaughter Juniper.\n\nA Zoom memorial will be planned at a later date.\n\nShare your thoughts and remembrances of Michael, and send condolences to his loved ones, in the comment section below.\n\nKelly Ripa is now officially a Disney Legend! The morning talk show host and former All My Children star (ex-Hayley Vaughan Santos) received the honor over the weekend at the D23 event in Anaheim, California, and the home of Disneyland.\n\nThe ‘legend’ honors goes to those individuals who have significantly influenced the Walt Disney Company. Ripa received the recognition for her work in television over her three-decade career, beginning with All My Children, followed by close to a quarter-century of hosting Live! You can catch the ceremonies as they begin to stream on Monday, August 12th on DisneyPlus.\n\nRyan Seacrest presented Ripa with the honors, marking a reunion of the two who co-hosted Live! together for six seasons, before Seacrest made the decision to move back to the West Coast full-time (the talk show is shot in New York City). Upon Seacrest’s exit, Ripa’s real-life husband and former AMC co-star Mark Consuelos, (ex-Mateo Santos) took over the co-hosting gig and the ratings have seen an impressive increase ever since.\n\nTaking to the podium to accept her honoes, Kelly shared, “Thank you so much, and Ryan, thank you from the bottom of my heart.” She joked, “I’m just so glad that you finally found something else to host.”\n\nRipa continued, “This feels surreal for me, and I want to thank Bob Iger (CEO, Walt Disney Company) for this truly magical experience.” As she spoke to the cameras and the audience she also remarked, “I know what you’re thinking. Why her ? What has she ever done?”\n\nKelly said proudly that she has been with the same company for 34 years, “which my great good fortune. I owe everything to Disney. Not only my career, but my entire immediate family.”\n\n“I met my smokin’ hot husband (Mark Consuelos) on the set of All My Children 30 years ago, and from there we made our own three children (Lola, Michael and Joaquin) right backstage in the Disney Labs.” In jest, Kelly added, “HR has asked me to remind everyone of their strict, no hidden Mickey policy. Being a ‘Disney legend’ is just the pixie dust on top of the Sundae. Thank you so very much, so honored.”\n\nTaking to Ripa’s Instagram post on the event were Mark Consuelos, himself, who said, “The woman, the myth, the Disney Legend!!! Proud of you babe!!!!” In addition, former on-screen sister-in-law, now GH’s Natalia, Eva LaRue (ex-Maria, All My Children) expressed, “OH, MA, GAWD- Amazing!

Brooks, James Cameron, Jamie Lee Curtis, Steve Ditko, Harrison Ford, Mark Henn, Frank Oz, Joe Rohde and John Williams.\n\nWhat do you think about Kelly Ripa becoming a Disney Legend? Comment below.\n\nThe soap opera world has been in mourning over the weekend, with the news of the death of Esta TerBlanche, who played Gillian Andrassy Lavery on ABC’s All My Children from 1997-2001.\n\nEsta’s leading man during her run in Pine Valley was Cameron Mathison (ex-Ryan Lavery, AMC now, Drew Quartermaine, GH). The love story of Ryan and Gillian was complex. He believed that Gillian was a wealthy princess; and she believed Ryan made enough money to support her. When Ryan discovered that Gillian was penniless, he chose to stay with her and the two were eventually married. Later, Gillian was killed when TerBlanche wanted to return to her native South Africa.\n\nIn an exclusive statement to Michael Fairman TV on Sunday, Mathison expressed, “Esta was somebody very, very close to my heart. We both came to New York around the same time and basically started and learned acting together. Ryan and Gillian are such a beautiful sweet couple … and hold a very, very special place in my heart.”\n\nSpeaking on TerBlanche’s love of animals and reconnecting with her in 2023, Cameron recounted, “Esta was literally one of the sweetest kindest people I’ve eve met. When she heard that my dog (Red) was sick and paralyzed last year, she volunteered to take him for a few days to try to care for him to give me a break. We hadn’t really been in touch for a long time so it came out of nowhere and after spending time with her, he learned how to walk again. 🙏”\n\nIn closing Mathison shared, “She was just a beautiful soul and had a healing spirit.” TerBlanche died unexpectedly on Thursday. The cause of death has not yet been determined.\n\nCameron also took to his Instagram Story on Sunday, sharing some images of himself and Esta with one said from All My Children, which read,”RIP my sweet princess.”\n\nWhen All My Children came to its conclusion in 2011, Ryan was reunited with Gillian one more time when he received a ‘heavenly’ visit from his princess. Now with TerBlanche’s death, it makes the scenes all the more poignant. Watch it below.\n\nShare your thoughts on Cameron’s sentiments on the death of his AMC co-star, Esta TerBlanche, and let us know if you were a Ryan and Gillian fan via the comment section below.\n\nEsta TerBlanche who played All My Children’s Gillian Andrassy Lavery died in her Los Angeles home at the age of 51.

Police contacted her younger brother Henko who lives in New York, who in turn contacted her family in South Africa.\n\nBurget Mueller, EP of Egoli said of Esta: “She was the epitome of professionalism, always well prepared and brought joy to set. She was beloved under her colleagues and we were very proud of her when she left to go to America and found fame there with All My Children.”\n\nTaking to Facebook, Esta’s PR rep, Lisa Rodrigo added, “I can not believe I am posting this. It’s with a heavy heart that my friend and client Esta TerBlanche passed away Thursday of natural causes. An autopsy report is pending. I am still processing and in shock. Esta was a beautiful soul in and out. I was proud to know her and work with her. More to come in the days ahead. Thank you for the messages so far. If I haven’t gotten to you, I will soon. May she RIP with the angels that she is.”\n\nTerBlanche appeared on All My Children from 1997-2001 and the love story of Ryan (Cameron Mathison) and Gillian was one of the most popular of the day. She later returned for the AMC series finale in 2011.\n\nIn story, Ryan believed that his beloved Gillian was a princess; and she believed Ryan made enough money to support her. He was blackmailed into marrying her by Liza, who threatened to report his taking kickbacks from advertisers if he didn’t go through with the wedding. When Ryan discovered that Gillian was penniless, he chose to stay with her and they married on, April 9, 2001.\n\nWhen TerBlanche wanted to return to her native South Africa, Gillian was killed-off when an assassin mistook her for Anna Devane and killed her. Gillian’s heart was then donated to save the life of Laura English.\n\nAt the time of her death, Esta was an animal activist, and she told Soap Opera Digest in a very recent interview: “At the moment, I am knee-deep into some animal projects. I grew up on a game farm, and just love animals. I’m working with a rescue project for some prairie dogs. And my Persian cat just had kittens, so there’s a lot of feeding going on around my house.” Esta also shared that she was eager to get back into acting, while also working on her South African cancer foundation Create Your Breakthrough.\n\nMichael Fairman TV sends our condolences to Esta’s family, loved ones and friends during this difficult time.\n\nNow below, share your remembrances and thoughts on the passing of All My Children’s Esta TerBlanche via the comment section.
