        "text": "Susan Lucci may be legendary for her four decades as Erica Kane on ABC's \"All My Children\" (1970-2011), but that's certainly not all she's done. Among her other big gigs:\n\nMAFIA PRINCESS (1986 NBC movie) -- At the height of the networks' docudrama craze, Lucci grabbed great ratings as mob boss Sam Giancana's daughter. Tony Curtis played her dad.\n\nLADY MOBSTER (1988 ABC movie) -- She went all out to avenge her dead parents. Her co-star: Michael Nader, who, as \"All My Children's\" Dimitri Marick, married Erica Kane twice.\n\nDALLAS (1990-91 CBS series) -- Producers hired \"the Larry Hagman of daytime\" to provoke Bobby and J.R. Ewing in the nighttime soap's final network season.\n\nEBBIE (1995 Lifetime movie) -- Feminized update of \"A Christmas Carol\" starred Lucci as mean department store boss Elizabeth \"Ebbie\" Scrooge.\n\nDANCING WITH THE STARS (2008 ABC) -- Lucci lost to current \"DWTS\" co-host Brooke Burke Charvet, coming in sixth (ahead of Cloris Leachman and Kim Kardashian)."
