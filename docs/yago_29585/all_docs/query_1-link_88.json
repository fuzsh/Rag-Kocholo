        "text": "I really can't see how this is going to work. Primetime soapy dramas about rich people haven't done that well on network t.v. in awhile, especially on ABC. I feel like this might be able to work on Hulu- I thought the Prospect Park version was done pretty well. I just wasn't feeling the \"Miranda is a not-lesbian being bullied for being a lesbian\" storyline...it was incredibly lame and the show seemed to forget that they're in a liberal area like 2018 suburban Philadelphia. It would have made way more sense if Miranda had hooked up with the guy and he sent her nudes all over and she was slut-shamed for that.\n\nAnyway, I wish them the best of luck but this makes way more sense on Hulu. Or they could have done an 18-minute version along with One Life to Live and given them the Spew time slot. Or this could have moved to Oprah's Own network. They have several soapy dramas there that have been running for awhile, and they probably would have upped the Jesse/Cassandra family element which would have been a plus.\n\nI also wonder if we're treating the 2013 reboot as canon. I don't think Haley and Mateo showed up, so there isn't much they'd have to disregard if we assume they're the main characters.\n\nI'd assume most of the characters will be recast. They might keep Miranda and AJ as 16-year olds. They'd actually be the right age.\n\nQuote\n\nI think the main reason the new Dynasty is working is because it has very little plot and is mostly a showcase for women's clothing and interior design.\n\nBingo. It is mainly to hang out with Liz Gillies for an hour each week and that's why it works. Also, Netflix saved its ass and that's why they're approaching syndication levels of episodes. The CW rarely cancels shows, especially ones that are filmed for cheap like Dynasty.\n\nDallas flopped in my opinion because Jesse Metcalfe is just not a good dramatic leading man. He's cute and he's perfect for Hallmark movies, but he simply could not lead a drama.\n\nEdited December 19, 2020 by methodwriter85\n\nOn 3/13/2021 at 10:49 PM, Steph J said:\n\nI recently got into some 1987 episodes (unfortunately the channel that I was watching, which appeared to have much of the year, got deleted from Youtube. I've picked up the year at archive.org but it has some pretty lengthy gaps between episodes). Some highlights include:\n\n* Mark's addiction story leading to his intervention (I'm amazed that Mark LaMura didn't snag an Emmy for this because he was fantastic)\n\n* Ross and Natalie's affair. It feels weird to say so, because I know that it ends with him raping her, but they were really hot at the start. I also like how other threads were woven in - Palmer falling for Natalie, Ellen and Ross being at odds over her desire to be there for Mark, Nina returning and being suspicious of Natalie's motives towards Palmer as well as Ross' feelings for Natalie, Jeremy finding out and his reaction speaking to his and Natalie's past - to increase the complexity and tension of the situation\n\n* Erica Kane, race car driver\n\n* Angie and Jesse finding their marriage undermined by the returns of his friend Yvonne (who I gather he had an affair with, but someone correct me if I'm wrong) and her father. Lots of great work by Debbi Morgan and Darnell Williams\n\n* Hunter Tylo's classic face\n\n* It's also interesting to me to see teenage Cecily going after teenage Charlie because I don't recall that part of their history ever coming up when the two got together during the 90s\n\nI'm hoping someone can explain to me what the deal was with Stuart's first wife (I didn't even know he had a wife before Cindy) kidnapping Erica. I saw a clip where she has Erica bound and gagged, but the earlier part of this story is missing so I have no context for it.\n\nI started watching right after these story lines (summer job had it on during lunch).\n\nWas the Ross and Natalie affair before she married Palmer or did they have a fling after she became Mrs. Palmer Courtland? When I started watching, Palmer was suspicious and kept setting up traps for them to be alone together, so he could catch them, but Natalie always tried to convince Ross she loved Palmer. The breakdown of Ellen and Ross's marriage was well done. Noone was a great actress, it is too bad they got rid of her and Mark (I loved the filler scenes of Mark, Mona and Erica while they discussed her latest crisis).\n\nMissed Erica the race car driver, but the results of that weekend were Erica's summer story where she is desperate to hide her pregnancy (and inconvenient morning sickness) from Travis while she clashed with Barbara. I know I am not alone in that it was Lucci's comedic timing that made me notice her.\n\nAngie and Jessie seemed headed for divorce and wonder if they would have if Darnell was not leaving the show and they reunited them so they could be together by the time of his hospital death scene.\n\nCecily was originally written as a young Erica. She was desperate to break-up Julie and Charlie (Phil and Tara) and even used a parentage secret that sent Julie running away similar to Erica telling Phil he who his parents were that sent him running. The said, she did actually seem truly remorseful for the consequences and while still wanting Charlie for awhile longer did not seem as underhanded after that, and started to evolve more into the lovable character whose scheming was more comical by the time she and Nico were together. While Julie and Cecily became friends - they hated each other back in high school and Charlie did not exactly think highly of Cecily.\n\nI missed most of the the issues with Stuart's first wife, but I think she actually might have loved Adam and I think she had a long resentment of Erica and how things changed when Adam married her. My guess is the kidnapping story did not make a lot of sense, but they used it as a plot device to establish Travis as a hero character and move him closer into Erica's orbit. I wonder how Travis would have ended up had he stayed with the show longer. I know he was largely a white hat sort of character early on, but he certainly showed a more vindictive and manipulative side the second part of his tenure.\n\nRegarding Kendell and the reboot -- at this point the Kendell character would probably be considered to old for what the TV execs seem to want for their soaps now, and will probably be the supporting matriarch character while her daughter/children are the main characters. That said, while people tend to think of Erica vs. Brooke or Erica vs. Natalie, Lucci and Larue had some good chemistry and it would be a shame to not see them tangle if this somehow does make it to the screen.\n\nI had completely forgotten about Liza and Ryan - and barely remember anything about it. Another thing the show messed up was a potentially great couple of Liza and Adam. Liza went from being Adam's equal \"I am you\" and became just another victim wife. I am not sure why they even had the third marriage because she immediately started blaming threatening to leave him for things he had done -- and they did not even bother to come up with anything new. The things she was harping on him about were things that had come out during the second marriage. Not that anyone should stay in a marriage and be lied to and victimized, but they really missed the boat in not making Liza and Adam partners in crime and not trying to make Liza a victimized heroine.\n\nA semi-related, and probably unpopular opinion. As sweet and unexpected as Marion and Stuart were - in the long term it took a lot of fun out of the Marion character and at the same time shifted Stuart from being Adam's conscience to being to simply being judgmental (and in real life - Adam would probably deserve it). Marion and Stuart's main job was to show up and tell him to stop being mean to Liza in stereo.\n\nI also liked Ryan with Gillian and the first round of Kendell. He and Kendell had good chemistry whereas I did not think he and Greenlee really worked. That is why it was so hard to believe they were drawn to each other while he was with Kendell especially since their earlier affair while he was on the outs with Gillian and she from Leo was toxic ad we were supposed to be toxic. And did the whole - Ryan got mad at Kendell for trying to prevent Greenlee from ruining their wedding by marrying Greenlee, the person who was trying to ruin their wedding - ever make sense?\n\nI liked early love to hate Greenlee -- but the Greenlee-Ryan-Kendell thing got old. She had good chemistry with Kendell, but the alternate stories where they were enemies - then best friends - then enemies -etc. grew tiresome. I also preferred her dynamic with Roger as her father than Jack. He and Mary added some blue blood disfunction that had been missing since Phoebe went back-burner. The purpose of her relationship with Jack seemed solely to be used whenever they wanted to break up him and Erica. They really did not spend much time developing the actual relationship. It also made her dynamic with Erica more one note and boring. They had some great scenes early on but it evolved always arguing about either Kendell or Jack - no shades to their relationship.\n\nAnother unpopular opinion. Krystal and Babe could have been great characters. The actresses were decent and the show needed some new trouble-makers to stir things up. If they would have kept Babe as the vixen schemer she was when she first showed up (maybe tone done the Sami Jo from Dynasty imitation) and kept Krystal as more of the gold digger with tones of original Opal - they could have been fun. It also did not help that they decided to change the characters to Babe is love and Earth Momma -- without adjusting their storyline. They were still doing horrible things but we were supposed to be on their side. I am not ) sure who thought it was a good idea to have Babe kidnap a second baby while there was so much negative reaction to the first baby she kidnapped...\n\nI will mainly never forgive Babe and Krystal because of their storyline generating a scene where Tad tells Joe about the baby switch and Dr. Joe Martin says that is too bad and is sympathetic - but does not seem to be bothered that Bianca, who he delivered after her mother had a week long sweeps related fever dream, the granddaughter of one of his oldest friends, and the daughter (who had the labor that induced flashbacks) of someone he has known since she was in high school and has had a long, complicated history including being related by marriage - twice, think her baby was dead. The paragon of Pine Valley virtue for four decades destroyed like that.\n\nIn the end it was a combination of too much Carey women, the endless Greenlee-Kendell - I hate you - you are my best friend - I hate you -- that satin killer - death by pancakes - ruining a fantastic amoral potentially long-term antagonist like Vanessa and making her a psychotic drug lord (did any of that timeline make sense) who had to be killed off, and probably what pushed me over the edge to take it off my VCR - Tad burying a man alive -- torturing him -- him dying a horrible death - people guessing Tad did it and feeling bad for him - and then Tad's one big emotional scene about it was really more him being mad at Dixie than feeling any guilt about killing someone in a horrible way.\n\nI just remembered Deadly Santa -- where the Christmas miracle was Tad and Dixie's daughter ends up in Pine Valley because she was in a car accident that killed the only parents she had ever known. We were supposed to say - yes - Christmas miracle - for a deadly car accident orphaning a girl so she can eventually be reunited. Am I hallucinating or was Julia's, who became kind of an adoptive mother, viewed as another positive because it was one more obstacle from reuniting a little girl with her cold blooded killer bio Dad - she just needed to lose one more person she loved.\n\nWow - that was rambling - not sure I have ever written that much about the show. Despite all that, it really was the one daytime soap I really watched and enjoyed it from mid-80s through most of the 90's and for about the first five years of the 2000s thought it had some bright spots and had the potential to operate on all cylinder's again.\n\nAlexa was great at being a schemer with flashes of vulnerability (which I suspect is how young Erica was). They had Krystal appear initially in a hotel room with a random hook-up and you could tell from her phone conversation with Babe she was not a great mother who would use her daughter to get money. That might have made more compelling and made Babe more relatable. By the time Krystal showed up in Pine Valley a few weeks later, something must have changed behind the scenes, because she was the best mother ever.\n\nFetal pig -- wonder what Lucci really thought of that story. I remember Tad figured it out, like the medical procedure of stealing the fetus was a reasonable thing. As bad of an idea as the unabortion was -- there actually could have been some good drama -- tension between Erica and the Martins - the fall-out of Josh knowing - his uncle killing his adoptive father. Instead once the reveal was done it shifted to the drama being over Josh liking Babe, because Babe did not have enough screen time I guess.\n\nI am having all of these repressed memories --- someone had the idea to pair a minor girl with autism with an older serial killer, who was no fine, because the \"cut the bad out\" which also caused him to talk like he was a five year old boy.\n\nI really did overall enjoy the show -- Laura's Death (enjoy might not be the right word for that) - the Brooke-Adam-Dixie-Tad was classic soap, the original Montgomery Brother triangle, Adam-Erica and the mess involved with everything Will related with some early Wildwind, Richard Fields, most of the Erica-Dimitri stuff, Edmund/Brooke/Maria, Bianca's coming out, the original Hayward disfunction before Vanessa became a drug lord, Palmer's takedown/revenge on Adam leading to the return of Dixie's baby etc.\n\nNot storyline related, but loved any filler scenes with Mona, Mark and Erica or family scenes in general. They were largely to update people who might have missed a few days by summarizing what had been happening (probably a pre-VCR thing), but those scenes really did help establish family relations and give them some depth and realness."
