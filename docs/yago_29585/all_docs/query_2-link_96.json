        "text": "Dimitri Marick is making a comeback to \"All My Children.\"\n\nThe Online Network announced on Monday that Michael Nader will reprise his role on the June 3 episode.\n\n\"I got a call from executive producer Ginger Smith who said Prospect Park is relaunching 'All My Children' online. She said, 'We'd love for you to come back.' And I said, 'You want me, you got me.' Being back, is like being home,\" Nader said in a statement.\n\nApparently, Brooke English (Julia Barr) will offer Dimitri a job as the head of one of Chandler Enterprises new divisions, Chandler Media, which he will gratefully accept.\n\nNader first appeared on the soap in 1991 and later became a power couple with grande dame Erica Kane (Susan Lucci).\n\nSince leaving the show in 2001, Nader has appeared on \"Law & Order: SVU and \"Cold Case.\" Previously, he appeared “As the World Turns,” \"Dynasty\" and “Magnum P.I.”\n\nNew episodes of \"All My Children\" are available Monday-Thursday via The OnLine Network, Hulu and Hulu Plus."
