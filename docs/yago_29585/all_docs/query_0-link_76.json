        "text": "Kendall Hart is a fictional character from All My Children, an American soap opera on the ABC network. The character was portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar from February 24, 1993, to July 3, 1995,[1] and by Alicia Minshew from January 2002 until the show's series finale on September 23, 2011.[2] On March 7, 2013, it was announced that Minshew would guest star on the Prospect Park's continuation of All My Children. She appeared on the second July 8 episode.[3]\n\nKendall is the daughter of Erica Kane, a child conceived when Erica was raped on the night of her 14th birthday by movie matinee idol Richard Fields. Emerging as one of daytime television's most popular and layered characters,[4][5] Kendall was originally written as a complex villain, described as a \"complicated bad girl\"[6] and \"the scheming daughter of the biggest schemer of them all, Erica Kane,\"[7] but was later reformed. The writers scripted her as a heroine,[8] while keeping devious aspects of the character intact."
