        "text": "Condolences are pouring in after word of Michael Nader’s (ex-Dimitri Marick, “All My Children”; ex-Dex Dexter, “Dynasty”) passing continues to spread throughout the soap opera community. The actor died on Monday, August 23 after a battle with an untreatable form of cancer. His wife, Jodi Lister, and the family’s rescue dog, Storm, were by his side.\n\nEarly this morning, Susan Lucci (ex-Erica Kane, “All My Children”) posted a heartfelt message about Nader on Instagram, saying he was “so handsome, so talented—so wonderful and beloved as ‘All My Children’s DIMITRI MARICK—and a great love of ‘Erica Kane.’” She added, “I am so lucky to have played opposite Michael—playing some of the most romantic scenes ever—dancing in palaces in Budapest, our gorgeous Greek Orthodox wedding, complete with crowns. Michael was a doll to work with and to know.”\n\nWith his big break coming as he played opposite Joan Collins on “Dynasty,” Nader became a leading heartthrob in the 1980s. Collins said on Instagram of her former co-star’s passing, “Very sad to hear of the death of my onscreen husband and lover #michaelnader aka #dexdexter – I loved working with him and his character was a wonderful mixture of tough and tender. #alexis was crazy to keep on rejecting him!”\n\nCady McClain (ex-Dixie Cooney, “AMC”; et al.) noted that “Michael was always a joy to work with, and one of the funniest human beings I ever met. I feel so blessed to have crossed his path and been able to watch him work his magic.” She further shared, “I know he felt the love and appreciation of his colleagues and I’m grateful our discussions were always deep or kind.” McClain shared a photo of herself with Nader on the red carpet in 2013 for the “All My Children” online reboot. “Note his book and bookmark! Only Michael would carry it on the red carpet,” she commented of the photo.\n\nEva LaRue said, “So heartbreaking to hear about the passing of Michael Nader! The sweetest man, with the best stories and the funniest out takes! Thank you for the endless belly laughs around that Wildwind dining table at #AMC ! You will be remembered with so much Love! All my prayers and sympathy to his family. Rest peacefully sweet man.”\n\nSeveral actors took to LaRue’s posting, including Vincent Irizarry (ex-David Hayward, “All My Children”), who said, “OMG, my heart is breaking!!! Loved dear Michael, working opposite him in both ‘Pine Valley’ and in Jackie Collins’ ‘Lucky Chances.’ So, so sad to hear of his passing. Yes, @evalarue , the sweetest man, and ABSOLUTELY the funniest outtakes…” Kelly Ripa (ex-Hayley Vaughan Santos, “All My Children”) commented, “Oh no…… Such a gem of a human being.” She used a “heartbroken” emoji to emphasize her response. Cameron Mathison (Drew Cain, “General Hospital”; ex-Ryan Lavery, “All My Children”) used four consecutive “prayer” emojis in response.\n\nWinsor Harmon (ex-Del Henry, “All My Children”; ex-Thorne Forrester, “The Bold and the Beautiful”) said, “I loved him!! He took me under his wing and really helped everyone in that whirlwind storyline involving all you guys Eva!! He was egoless and really loved our craft!! Heartbreaking.”\n\nDondré T. Whitfield (ex-Terrence Frye, “All My Children”) responded, saying, “Wow. Haven’t seen him in years. So sad to see the Brother. He was very nice to me during my ‘Pine Valley’ time. RIP Nader.”\n\nNader is survived by Lister, his daughter Lindsay from a previous marriage, son-in-law Trevor and granddaughter Juniper."
