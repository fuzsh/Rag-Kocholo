        "text": "São Tomé and Principe is a member of the Paris Convention and the Madrid Protocol.\n\nThe Industrial Property Law of São Tomé and Principe is silent on whether recognition is given to trade mark applications which are filed in terms of the Madrid Protocol which designate this country. It would appear, however, from the context of the provision in the Industrial Property Law which recognises and gives effect to São Tomé and Principe’s treaty obligations, that there was an intention to implement these treaties.\n\nApplications may be filed as national applications and, in appropriate circumstances, claiming convention priority in terms of the Paris Convention. International applications filed in terms of the Madrid Protocol may also designate São Tomé and Principe.\n\nProvision is made for the registration of trade marks for goods and for services, and for collective marks.\n\nNo express provision is made for defensive marks.\n\nTypes of trademark registrable\n\nService marks are registrable. Multi class applications are acceptable. There are provisions for the registration of COLLECTIVE MARKS. There are no provisions for the registration of DEFENSIVE MARKS or SERIES MARKS.\n\nDocuments required for trademark registration\n\nCopy of power of attorney, simply signed.\n\n15 prints of the mark.\n\nPriority document (if applicable), with verified Portuguese translation.\n\nRenewals\n\nTrademarks are valid for an initial period of 10 years. Renewal every 10 years\n\nDocuments required for renewals\n\nCopy of power of attorney, simply signed.\n\nDocuments required for assignments/mergers\n\nCopy of power of attorney, simply signed.\n\nDeed of Assignment or other instrument of title, notarized with verified Portuguese translation.\n\nDocument required for change of name\n\nCopy of power of attorney, simply signed.\n\nCertificate of Change of Name, with verified Portuguese translation.\n\nDocuments required for change of address\n\nSimple copy of the Certificate of Registration. Copy of power of attorney, simply signed.\n\nDocuments required for licenses/registered users\n\nCopy of power of attorney, simply signed.\n\nLicense Agreement, with verified Portuguese translation.\n\nSão Tomé and Principe is a member of the Paris Convention and the PCT.\n\nPatent protection is available via a national filing.\n\nAlthough São Tomé and Principe is a member of the PCT, the national laws have not yet been amended to cater for the PCT. Accordingly, it is not clear whether enforceable rights will be obtained via PCT national phase filings in São Tomé. The Law does contain a general provision to the effect that the provisions of any international treaty concerning IP to which São Tomé and Principe is a party, are applicable and supersede national law. This provision provides a basis for PCT applications.\n\nFiling Requirements\n\nRegistry practice has not yet been established. The following information will be updated from time to time as more information becomes available.\n\nNational Phase PCT Application\n\nAt present, we advise applicants to lodge the same documents as for a non-PCT application, plus the following:\n\nCopy of International Publication\n\nCopy of International Search report\n\nCopy of International Preliminary Report on Patentability\n\nPatent of Invention\n\nPower of Attorney (can be late filed).\n\nSpecification, claims and abstract in Portuguese (required on the day of filing).\n\nFormal drawings, if applicable, (required on the day of filing).\n\nAssignment of Invention (can be late filed).\n\nPriority document with verified Portuguese translation of the covering page (can be late filed).\n\nDuration and Renewal\n\nThe term of a patent is twenty years from the filing date. Renewal fees fall due annually from the first anniversary of the filing date.\n\nSão Tomé and Principe is a member of the Paris Convention and the Hague Agreement.\n\nAlthough São Tomé and Principe has acceded to the Hague Agreement, the national law has not yet been amended to provide for international applications designating São Tomé. Accordingly, it is not clear whether enforceable rights can be obtained in that manner. The Law does contain a general provision to the effect that the provisions of any international treaty concerning IP to which São Tomé and Principe is a party, are applicable and supersede national law.\n\nDesign protection is available by way of a national filing.\n\nFiling Requirements\n\nPower of Attorney\n\nDrawings or photographs that adequately represent the subject matter of the industrial design\n\nAn indication of the kind of products for which the industrial design is to be used.\n\nCertified copy of priority document, if priority claimed, with verified Portuguese translation).\n\nAssignment document\n\nDuration and Renewal\n\nDesign registration is valid for an initial term of five years from the filing date, which is renewable upon payment of the required fees for two further terms of five years each. A grace period of six months is provided for late payment of renewal fees"
