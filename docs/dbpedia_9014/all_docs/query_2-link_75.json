        "text": "Overview\n\nKantata provides a multi-currency feature, allowing foreign markets to utilize project and resource cost rates in their local currencies. Each currency has its own symbol, ISO code, name, and format.\n\nCurrency Format\n\nEach currency in Kantata OX has a specific format that determines where the decimal separator is located, which type of separator is used, and where the currency symbol appears.\n\nThe majority of currencies in Kantata OX use a “.” as the decimal separator. However, certain currencies use a “,” as the separator. For example, an amount of 199.99 is formatted as $199.99 in USD but 199,99 € in EUR.\n\nTo determine the format for a specific currency, please refer to the Format column in the table below.\n\nNote: There currently isn’t an option to configure localization formatting in Kantata OX.\n\nExporting Currencies\n\nWhen exporting financial data to a CSV or Excel file in Analytics, all currency fields will export using “.” as the default decimal separator in the currency columns. This is done to ensure that the currencies will display in your preferred localization preference when opening the exported document in a spreadsheet software.\n\nNote: You may need to first set your preferred localization preference in your spreadsheet software to utilize this option.\n\nCurrency Chart\n\nRelated Articles\n\nForeign Exchange Overview\n\nForeign Exchange Access Group Set\n\nSupported Currency ISO Codes and Formats\n\nWhat are Access Groups?\n\nImport Exchange Rates from a CSV File\n\nHow to Create a New Access Group\n\nKantata OX API"
