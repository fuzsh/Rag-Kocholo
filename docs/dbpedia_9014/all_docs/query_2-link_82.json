        "text": "Geography\n\nSao Tome and Principe is an island state in the Atlantic Ocean right on the equator. The dwarf state has a total area of only 960 km² (371 mi²) and a total coastline of 209 km (129.9 mi). This land area is about 1.2 times the size of New York City. Sao Tome and Principe is thus one of the smallest countries in Africa by area and ranked 188th worldwide. A considerable share of the inhabitants (76%) belongs to the urban population. Almost every third resident lives in São Tomé.\n\nThe highest mountain peak (Pico de São Tomé) is at 2,024 meters. Besides the two main islands, the country has 6 other small islands. Sao Tome and Principe has no direct neighbors. The distance between New York City and the Capital São Tomé is about 9,210 km (5,723 mi)."
