        "text": "If you’re planning a trip to Sao Tome and Principe - or planning to move there to live, work or study - you’ve got an exciting time ahead. As the Sao Tomean Dobra (STD) is the official currency in Sao Tome and Principe you’ll need to find convenient ways to spend in STD while you’re there.\n\nThis guide walks through how to use the Revolut card in Sao Tome and Principe for convenient and secure transactions, and offers some handy hints about making your money go further when you’re abroad.\n\nCan I use the Revolut card in Sao Tome and Principe?\n\nIf you are a resident of Australia and have a Revolut card - or if you’re thinking of getting one - you’re probably wondering: can I use my Revolut card to pay for things in Sao Tome and Principe?\n\nThe answer is yes, you can use the Revolut card for everyday spending in Sao Tome and Principe. You can use the card to pay for things in Sao Tomean Dobras with competitive exchange rates and low transaction fees. This guide walks through how you’ll be able to use your Revolut card to help manage your travel spending.\n\nUnfortunately, the Revolut card is not yet available for residents of Sao Tome and Principe. You may find that Wise is a better option for residents; check whether Wise is available below.\n\nSee alternatives to Revolut\n\nWhat happens if I move to Sao Tome and Principe?\n\nRevolut does not offer cards in Sao Tome and Principe, so your card may stop working. You may still be able to use other services, such as money transfers.\n\nWhile your ATM card will work in Sao Tome and Principe it’s useful to know that cash is still the preferred payment method for many merchants.\n\nYou’re unlikely to be able to use your card in smaller stores and restaurants, so carrying cash is essential.\n\nCarrying a low cost ATM card when you’re in Sao Tome and Principe is still a smart idea, so you can take out cash when you do find an ATM. You may also be able to use your card in larger hotels or restaurants, particularly in tourist areas.\n\nHowever, keeping some cash on you at all times, as well as your card or cards is a smart plan, so you’re prepared no matter what happens.\n\nThe Sao Tomean Dobra (STD) is the official currency in Sao Tome and Principe.\n\nYou can exchange your AUD before you leave Australia if you’d like - but bear in mind that you won’t be able to spend AUD in Sao Tome and Principe. If you arrive with cash in your pocket you’ll need to exchange it locally, which may come with unexpected costs, and take time out of your trip unnecessarily.\n\nA better plan for lots of people is to get a travel card for spending in STD while in Sao Tome and Principe, with low costs and secure transactions."
