These are frequent questions in the 3D printing community. There were already few calculators online, but we felt like they were always either too simple, overlooking important steps (such as print preparation), or very complicated with many inputs, but no default values to start with. So we decided to create our own calculator ðŸ™‚\n\nSimply load a gcode file or input the print time and filament weight manually. The calculator is already pre-filled with most common values, but you can edit all of them. And in the end, you can share the result or print a summary."
