        "text": "Who should monitor blood pressure at home?\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends home monitoring for all people with high blood pressure to help their health care professional know if treatments are working. Home monitoring can also be used to confirm the diagnosis of high blood pressure. However, home monitoring does not replace regular doctor visits. Do not stop taking blood pressure medication without checking with your health care professional regardless of your readings during home monitoring.\n\nMonitoring at home is especially important for:\n\nAnyone diagnosed with high blood pressure.\n\nPeople starting or changing high blood pressure treatment to find if it’s working.\n\nPeople who need closer monitoring. This is especially true for people with risk factors for high blood pressure and/or conditions related to high blood pressure.\n\nChoosing a home blood pressure monitor\n\nThe AHA recommends an automatic, cuff-style, upper arm (biceps) monitor.\n\nWrist and finger monitors are not recommended. They give less reliable readings.\n\nChoose a monitor that has been validated. If you are unsure, ask your health care professional or pharmacist for advice or find options at validatebp.org(link opens in new window).\n\nWhen choosing a blood pressure monitor for a senior, person who is pregnant or child, make sure it is validated for them.\n\nMake sure the cuff fits. Measure around your upper arm and choose a monitor that comes with the correct cuff size.\n\nOnce you’ve purchased your monitor, take it to your next appointment.\n\nHave your health care professional check to see that you are using it correctly and getting the same results as the equipment in the office. Plan to bring your monitor in once a year, or as directed by the company, to make sure the readings are accurate.\n\nHow to use a home blood pressure monitor\n\nDiscuss how to use your home blood pressure monitor with your health care professional. It’s important to have them make sure your home monitor is accurate and that you have the correct cuff size and fit. A cuff that is the incorrect size will cause an inaccurate blood pressure reading.\n\nWhen preparing to take your blood pressure:\n\nPlan ahead. Don’t smoke, drink caffeinated beverages or exercise within 30 minutes before taking your blood pressure. Empty your bladder.\n\nDon't take the measurement over clothes. Remove the clothing over the arm that will be used to measure blood pressure.\n\nYou can use either arm. Usually there is not a big difference between readings on them.\n\nBe still. Allow at least five minutes of quiet rest before measurements. Don’t talk or use the phone.\n\nSit correctly. Sit with your back straight and supported (on a dining chair, rather than a sofa). Your feet should be flat on the floor. Do not cross your legs. Support your arm on a flat surface. The middle of the cuff should be placed on the upper arm at heart level. Check your monitor's instructions for an illustration or have your health care professional show you how.\n\nMeasure at the same time every day. Take the readings at the same time each day. Talk with your health care professional about how often to take your blood pressure.\n\nTake multiple readings and record the results. Each time you measure, take two readings one minute apart. Record the results using a printable (PDF) tracker. If your monitor has built-in memory to store your readings, take it with you to your medical appointments. Some monitors may also let you upload your readings to a secure website.\n\nDownload a PDF sheet that shows you how to measure your blood pressure properly. Also available in Spanish, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese.\n\nKnow your numbers\n\nLearn what the numbers in your blood pressure reading mean.\n\nBlood Pressure Chart BLOOD PRESSURE CATEGORY SYSTOLIC mm Hg (upper number) and/or DIASTOLIC mm Hg (lower number) NORMAL LESS THAN 120 and LESS THAN 80 ELEVATED 120 – 129 and LESS THAN 80 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (HYPERTENSION) STAGE 1 130 – 139 or 80 – 89 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (HYPERTENSION) STAGE 2 140 OR HIGHER or 90 OR HIGHER HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS (consult your doctor immediately) HIGHER THAN 180 and/or HIGHER THAN 120\n\nNote: Only a doctor or other medical professional can confirm a high blood pressure diagnosis. They also can evaluate low blood pressure numbers.\n\nDownload this chart:\n\nEnglish PDF | JPEG\n\nSpanish PDF | JPEG\n\nTraditional Chinese PDF | JPEG\n\nLoading...\n\nKnow Your Numbers\n\nIs your blood pressure in a healthy range? The best way to know is to get it checked.\n\nThen, enter your numbers into this calculator to see which blood pressure category you are in.\n\nGet Started\n\nSystolic Pressure\n\nUsing your most recent blood pressure measurement, what is your systolic (upper) number?\n\n119 or lower\n\n120-129\n\n130-139\n\n140-179\n\n180 or higher\n\n1 of 2\n\nBack Next\n\nDiastolic Pressure\n\nUsing your most recent blood pressure measurement, what is your diastolic (lower) number?\n\nLess than 80\n\n80-89\n\n90-119\n\n120 or higher\n\n2 of 2\n\nBack\n\nNormal Blood Pressure\n\n{{item.value}}\n\nCongratulations! Your blood pressure is normal. Keep up the good work. Stick with these heart-healthy habits.\n\nElevated Blood Pressure\n\n{{item.value}}\n\nYou have elevated blood pressure. Unless steps are taken to control it, elevated blood pressure can turn into high blood pressure.\n\nWork with your health care team to get your blood pressure in the normal range. Lifestyle changes can help.\n\nHigh Blood Pressure Stage 1\n\n{{item.value}}\n\nYou have high blood pressure Stage 1. Your health care professional should prescribe lifestyle changes. They may add medication based on your risk of heart disease or stroke. Medication should also be added if you have conditions such as diabetes, heart failure and kidney disease.\n\nHigh Blood Pressure Stage 2\n\n{{item.value}}\n\nYou have high blood pressure Stage 2. Your health care professional should prescribe lifestyle changes and medication to lower your blood pressure. You may need one or more medications to keep your blood pressure in a healthy range.\n\nHypertensive Crisis\n\n{{item.value}}\n\nYou may be in hypertensive crisis.\n\nWait five minutes.\n\nTake your blood pressure again.\n\nIf your readings are still high, call your health care professional right away.\n\nCall 911 if your blood pressure is higher than 180/120 and you are having chest pain, shortness of breath, back pain, numbness, weakness, change in vision or difficulty speaking.\n\nUh oh, it appears that there was a network issue.\n\nBack\n\nIf you get a high blood pressure reading\n\nA single high reading is not an immediate cause for alarm. If you get a reading that is higher than normal, take your blood pressure a second time. Write down the results of both measurements. Check with your health care professional to see if there’s a health concern or whether there may be problems with your monitor.\n\nIf your blood pressure readings are suddenly higher than 180/120 mm Hg, wait at least one minute and test again. If your readings are still very high, contact your health care professional immediately. You could be having a hypertensive crisis.\n\nCall 911 if your blood pressure is higher than 180/120 mm Hg and if you are having new signs or symptoms that may include:\n\nChest pain\n\nShortness of breath\n\nBack pain\n\nNumbness\n\nWeakness\n\nChange in vision\n\nDifficulty speaking\n\nConfusion\n\nDizziness\n\nVomiting\n\nKeep a blood pressure journal\n\nOne blood pressure measurement is like a snapshot. It tells what your blood pressure is at that moment. A record of readings taken over time provides a more complete picture of your blood pressure. This can help you work with your doctor to make sure that your treatments to reduce your blood pressure are working."
