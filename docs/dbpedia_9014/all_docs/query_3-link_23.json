        "text": "The Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe has redenominated the nation’s currency in conjunction with the launch of its new banknote and coin series.\n\nCelebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary this year, the central bank is launching the new series to showcase the wildlife of the island nation. The series consists of six new banknotes and five new coins.\n\nIn a statement, the central bank said 1 new dobra would be equal to 1,000 of the previous dobras. 10,000 dobras is currently worth $0.49.\n\n“The\n\nOnly users who have a paid subscription or are part of a corporate subscription are able to print or copy content.\n\nTo access these options, along with all other subscription benefits, please contact info@centralbanking.com or view our subscription options here: http://subscriptions.centralbanking.com/subscribe\n\nYou are currently unable to print this content.
