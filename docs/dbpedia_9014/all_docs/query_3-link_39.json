        "text": "If you’re planning a trip to Sao Tome and Principe - or planning to move there to live, work or study - you’ve got an exciting time ahead. As the Sao Tomean Dobra (STD) is the official currency in Sao Tome and Principe you’ll need to find convenient ways to spend in STD while you’re there.\n\nIf you already hold a Wise card you might be wondering if it can be used in Sao Tome and Principe.\n\nUnfortunately, at the time of research, this isn’t possible - but keep reading, as there are some great alternatives, like the Revolut card which you might want to consider, as well as some handy hints about making your money go further when you’re abroad.\n\nCan I use the Wise card in Sao Tome and Principe?\n\nIf you are a resident of the USA and have a Wise card - or if you’re thinking of getting one - you’re probably wondering: can I use my Wise card to pay for things in Sao Tome and Principe?\n\nUnfortunately, at the time of writing, the Wise card is not available for use in Sao Tome and Principe. But don’t worry - we’ve got a great alternative to introduce - the Revolut card. Read on to learn more about the Revolut card, including how to use the card in Sao Tome and Principe to help you plan your travel spending.\n\nUnfortunately, the Wise card is not yet available for residents of Sao Tome and Principe. You may find that Revolut is a better option for residents; check whether Revolut is available below.\n\nSee alternatives to Wise\n\nWhat happens if I move to Sao Tome and Principe?\n\nYou can continue using your Wise card until it expires, but you will not be issued a new card as Wise does not offer the card in Sao Tome and Principe. You may be able to continue using other Wise services, such as money transfers.\n\nWhile your ATM card will work in Sao Tome and Principe it’s useful to know that cash is still the preferred payment method for many merchants.\n\nYou’re unlikely to be able to use your card in smaller stores and restaurants, so carrying cash is essential.\n\nCarrying a low cost ATM card when you’re in Sao Tome and Principe is still a smart idea, so you can take out cash when you do find an ATM. You may also be able to use your card in larger hotels or restaurants, particularly in tourist areas.\n\nHowever, keeping some cash on you at all times, as well as your card or cards is a smart plan, so you’re prepared no matter what happens.\n\nThe Sao Tomean Dobra (STD) is the official currency in Sao Tome and Principe.\n\nYou can exchange your USD before you leave the USA if you’d like - but bear in mind that you won’t be able to spend USD in Sao Tome and Principe. If you arrive with cash in your pocket you’ll need to exchange it locally, which may come with unexpected costs, and take time out of your trip unnecessarily.\n\nA better plan for lots of people is to get a travel card for spending in STD while in Sao Tome and Principe, with low costs and secure transactions."
