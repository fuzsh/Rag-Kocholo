Travelling to S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe

With its different currency, banking system, and money customs, figuring out the best way to pay in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe if you travel there can be tricky. Fortunately, many forms of payments have become ubiquitous around the globe, including:

Credit cards: Cards from VISA and Mastercard are accepted in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, especially in touristy establishments.

Debit cards: Debit cards linked to your bank account let you make purchases at point-of-sale terminals and withdraw cash.

Cash: Having some dobra banknotes could help for small purchases, tipping, and emergencies. You can typically exchange currency at a bank or exchange bureau before or upon arrival.

Mobile payments: Mobile payment services like Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Alipay are an increasingly popular way to pay, but you'll need to check beforehand how available these methods are in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe.

Prepaid travel cards: A reloadable debit card with a dobra balance can give you good value, security, and convenience.

Of these methods, using a prepaid travel card is almost always the best way to pay in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe because they generally incur lower fees on dobra currency exchange than credit cards or bank debit cards do. Moreover, many prepaid travel cards let you hold multi-currency balances, allowing you to dodge DCCs and other sneaky fees while travelling ‚Äî all while providing the same level of security and convenience as you're used to from your credit or debit card!

Depending on where you're from, you may be able to find a prepaid travel card from your bank. Still, we recommend using a global provider like Revolut because it offers excellent exchange rates, multi-currency balances, and a travel debit card that allows you to spend on your holiday like a local and enjoy peace of mind after each tap, swipe, or cash withdrawal.

Revolut is only available in the United States, the United Kingdom, the EU/EEA, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Azerbaijan, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and Chile. If you live in Canada or New Zealand, the Wise Account is another excellent option to consider. If you're from any other country, we recommend checking out what multi-currency cards are available in your country or whether your bank offers any similar products.
