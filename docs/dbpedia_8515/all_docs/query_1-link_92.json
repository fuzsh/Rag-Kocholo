        "text": "We report here a detailed petrographic study accompanied by the first whole-rock major and trace element geochemical analyses as well as the first Sr and Nd isotope data for the Kroonstad Group II Kimberlite Cluster. Hypabyssal kimberlite is described from the Lace, Voorspoed and Besterskraal North kimberlite pipes. The Lace kimberlite is a monticellite phlogopite kimberlite with mineralogy and geochemistry more similar to typical Group I kimberlites. The Voorspoed kimberlite is an aegirine and sanidine bearing kimberlite and along with the geochemistry shows a more evolved composition relative to the Lace kimberlite. The Besterskraal North kimberlite is a highly evolved type Group II kimberlite containing abundant K-richterite, sanidine, aegirine and leucite. The magma evolutionary trend is linked to a variation in olivine macrocryst abundance. The Lace unevolved magma contains abundant olivine macrocrysts and has not been affected by significant fractionation whereas the Voorspoed and Besterskraal North kimberlite contain far fewer olivine macrocrysts, which indicates that significant fractionation has affected these magmas en route to the surface. We evaluate the potential for fractionation to result in differentiation of a common parent magma or magma generated from a common source en route to the surface. This process is complicated by the fact that olivine macrocrysts are essentially xenocrysts within the magma and the loss of these xenocrysts will not affect the primary magma composition. Furthermore we present two alternate hypotheses for the evolution of the magmas; a) contamination en route to the surface and b) varying degrees of partial melting at the source. The evolutionary trend is also linked with diamond characteristics. In particular diamond parcels at the Voorspoed pipe between 1906 and 1911 were deficient in large stones, which indicate that fractionation has likely also removed the large stones from the Voorspoed magma along with the olivine macrocrysts."
