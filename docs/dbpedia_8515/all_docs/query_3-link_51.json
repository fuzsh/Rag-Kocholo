        "text": "a NB: With the exception of the captions which were written by the author of the particular photograph, much of the copy has been written in the first person by Charlie, who was based at Bloemfontein from 1968 to 1979. Where others have written the notes this is indicated in italics.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAmong the first items issued to me when I started work in Bloemfontein in February 1968 were an orange Chevvy bakkie and the current OFS Working Time Book. Having just returned to RSA from the UK where railways were in plummeting decline it was refreshing to hold the inch-thick WTB that showed >300 workings in and out of town each day – and nearly all steam (within six months it was 100 %). It took a while for me to realise that South Africa was booming and SAR was frantically trying to keep up with the surging traffic. I was assigned an office to share with a Dutchman, Koos Den Houting (not an Afrikaner) and my boss was Hannes Dekker, District Engineer for Bloemfontein, who pronounced the ‘K’ word in the guttural way that only a natural-born Afrikaner could. As an aside; the first thing Koos told me (elatedly) was that the England cricket tour was off because our PM wouldn’t allow them to bring D’Oliviera. That’s when I found out his hero was Dr Verwoerd. My camera was second drawer down in my new desk, which was less than three minute’s brisk walk from Platform 2. My wyk as Assistant Engineer (and later, District Engineer) was from De Bloem to Hamilton and Kloofeind to Sannaspos. For the next eleven years I worked in this place that Les described (and illustrated) so eloquently inPart 1 of this chapter. Many times I had to explain my mysterious disappearances during working hours to my boss. He was generally reasonably tolerant.\n\nDuring 1969 I was promoted to District Engineer in charge of New Works within the same boundaries described above, which included the Marshalling yard, the Passenger station, the Locomotive Running shed, the Mechanical Workshops and the locomotive water supplies at Kloofeind, Glen and Sannaspos (the latter involved a major project: a new dam on the Modder River including an eleven mile pipeline to Sannaspos station to improve the reliability of locomotive water supplies there – and this in 1970…..). There was a lot going on. My new office was at Estoire, situated between the up-and-down passenger main, the up-goods departure road and the down freight bypass completed in 1965. As if this noisy location wasn’t enough, the main access track for Bloemfontein’s domestic freight was almost within touching distance of the office’s south wall (please refer to Bruno’s map). On this line there were no load restrictions and at regular intervals 100-wagon haulers would rumble by at walking pace making phone communication impossible. The southbound freight bypass was on 1/100 and approaching trains could be heard for several minutes until they hammered past our east window with a deafening crescendo. It was easy to tell the difference between a 15F (or a 23) and any other class, my most memorable being 15A 1824, unrebuilt, on a heavy down freight c 1971. And even that was not all: the shunting leads at the north end of the hump-yard grid were located adjacent to the west fence of the RE's camp; throughout the day one was regaled with the racket of heavy engines fetching sorted loads and kicking them off into the departure tracks.\n\nThe foregoing set the stage for my most productive years as an amateur railway photographer. In the course of four years in the UK I had the good fortune to meet many world-famous photographers, not least among them being AE (Dusty) Durrant, and upon my return, Allen Jorgensen, American by birth and probably the finest railway photographer to visit these shores.\n\n3. In April 1969 the 30th anniversary of the Blue Train was celebrated by running it with steam from Johannesburg to Cape Town. Railwaymen entered into the spirit of the occasion, especially in Bloemfontein – home of the legendary 16Es. The photo shows 16E 855 “Johannesburg” about to take 434-up, the East London-Johannesburg express out of Platform 3, preparatory to working the anniversary train from Johannesburg to Klerksdorp a few days later. Les has provided us with the authentic background to this photo:\n\n\"Early in 1969 the Historic Transport Association instigated the running of a special steam-hauled Blue Train between Johannesburg and Cape Town. John Silver of the HTA was given the task of arranging the motive power with Reg Tarpey. After John arranged the sequence of engine power for the trip, I was asked to join the HTA and get involved with the arrangements. John’s favourite SAR locomotive was the class 23 and he organized for several 23s to be involved but not one single 15F! I took him to task on this, indicating that in the past, 15Fs handled the Blue between JHB and Klerksdorp and also between Touws River and Cape Town but it was too late to make any changes. Even the use of my favourite class of engine, the 16E, was wrong in that the 16Es did not work the air-conditioned Union Limited in 1939 – it was considered too heavy if signals brought the train to a stand at Kamfersdam north of Kimberley. It was felt that the 16E would have difficulty in restarting the train on the gradient up to Kimberley.*\n\nIn any event, the two 16Es that were sent up to Krugersdorp Loco in late March were No's 855 “City of Johannesburg” to work the special Blue and 859 “City of Bloemfontein” as a back-up in case anything went wrong. Happy to say that 855 performed perfectly on the actual trip. 859 was used as a Guinea-pig to test an equivalent goods load to Welverdiend and return on the 9th of April – this test also went off without a hitch. Both 16Es did what was asked of them. Note that 855 handled the Blue on the 1st leg from JHB to Klerksdorp and back.\"\n\n* But see the following note from Les, received a couple of days after the above:\n\n\"Further to my earlier comments on the use of a 16E on the special Blue Train, we actually had both air-conditioned lounge cars type B-3 on that run, adding an additional 42 tons to the load. With this additional load on our minds, I was standing with Frank Holland in the vestibule of the leading coach behind 855 as she tackled Hamberg Bank up to Roodepoort. Driver I.H. Cooper was in charge with Senior Fireman S.P.F. Potgieter and Loco Inspector P.H. van Rooyen on the footplate. Driver Cooper had 855 drifting down the bank from Florida towards the climb up past Hamberg and Frank had beads of sweat on his forehead, wondering if 855 was going to cope up the bank. As we swept into the hollow of the descending bank from Florida, I kept saying – Driver Cooper – open her up – open her up!!!! He eventually opened her regulator and we started the climb. She felt the grade but did not falter – she climbed with her exhaust bark telling everyone on board that she was not going to stall and she didn’t - topping the grade as we rounded the curve through Roodepoort station in grand style!\n\nSo, maybe the loco staff in 1939 over-reacted, thinking that the 16E would have had trouble handling the new air-conditioned Union Limited up the bank from Kamfersdam to Kimberley. To be fair, they did refer to a 16E starting the train if held by signals but back in those days, the Union Limited was very seldom held by signals anywhere! Remember the “pound-a-minute” being docked off any signalman holding the Ltd for any unnecessary reason!\n\nA final word: On the return and final leg of the trip, we travelled between Bank and Randfontein on-route to JHB – a road that included curve after curve up fairly steep gradients and 855 again performed impeccably – this time with Driver P.J.A. van Wyk, Fireman J.P. Werner and Loco Inspector van Rooyen! Food for thought.......\"\n\n15. Train 132 could almost always guarantee an interesting assortment of coaching stock. Apart from the movement of a variety of interesting vehicles to Kroonstad to change out those used on the branch lines there, it was also one of the last in the pecking order for modern vehicles and here is an almost uniform consist of clerestory coaches in April 1975. This was possibly an aftermath of the demands following the Easter weekend, often viewed by Main Line Passenger Services staff as being more demanding than the Christmas peak, being concentrated over a much shorter four-day period. It was not unusual to find the passenger yards around the country being empty on the Thursday evening before Good Friday as every vehicle with round wheels was used to move passengers. It is unfortunate that the number of the leading articulated coach was not recorded as it may have travelled this route on the Orange Express between 1946 and 1956 - no less than nine of the 25 type C-22’s, built in 1928 for use on the Union Limited and Union Express until 1939 when the first air-conditioned Blue Train entered service, were painted in Orange Express colours in 1947. These articulated coaches with three bogies were based on the design principles of Nigel Gresley (later Sir) of the London and North Eastern Railway in England who favoured articulation as a means of reducing the tare weight of coaching stock. By 1978 most had been withdrawn from revenue service, the last three being withdrawn in 1980. Note a number 3 pasted over the 1, indicating that the coach is being used as a third-class coach, as has been done on the following three of what appear to be second class vehicles. Drastic times often call for drastic measures, here the demand for third-class accommodation in Bloemfontein exceeded the availability of third-class vehicles. It would appear that it was a bad day in the office for the driver and fireman on the class 23 as it was already priming and the goods guards van on the train had not even left the confines of the station. Miraculously at the critical moment the sun broke through an otherwise 100% overcast sky.\n\n16. Bloemfontein saw many special trains for the military. There was a large camp outside Bloemfontein where training was done, and exercises were held so Bloemfontein saw many such trains. These were considered of strategic importance and as such their movement kept as secret as possible. Blinds had to be drawn so that the public could not see that the trains were occupied by military personnel, this requirement mostly adhered too by the majority of regiments but also occasionally ignored by others. You can imagine how frustrating that was to an enthusiast like your photographer on his way to and from military training who just wanted to watch the trains and who risked life and limb, not only for his country, but also just to open the blind a crack to watch what was going on outside while lying head to the window on the middle bunk of an overcrowded 2nd class compartment. These trains often ran to the schedules of regular trains which only ran on certain days of the week, such as the Orange Express, even if it was just over a portion of the route, e.g. Kimberley to Durban as experienced by your photographer. In this photograph a train of new recruits is heading north behind a class 23 no doubt to another training camp with the strange positioning of a goods guard’s van behind the locomotive, followed by a coach for railway catering staff. In the 1980’s provision was made for no less than 200 second class coaches just for military purposes. Date: August 1975\n\n67. Looking north from the footbridge near Hamilton early on a May morning in 1969. On the left a Class 23 and a 25NC have teamed up on 02662 block manganese ore en route from Postmasburg to Maydon Wharf, Durban (those B bogies look empty but be assured, they are loaded to the Plimsoll line. You can just see the heaps of super-dense lumps of manganese and the train is in fact a full load, 2360 tons on 140 axles). On the right 23cl 3229 “Springs” is on southbound wayside goods No 993; while in the background another cl 23 is coming around the corner on 23-down to Burgersdorp and East London. In the background is the exhaust trail of 509-down to Lynchfield. There are four moving trains in this picture and no, Briggs, this is neither a sandwich nor a photoshop job.\n\nUntil the Postmasburg branch electrification was energised near the end of 1966, block loads of manganese ore were hauled by steam over the 520 miles from Postmasburg to Harrismith. For five years prior to this, condensers displaced by the electrification from Touws River to Beaufort West worked from Postmasburg to Bloemfontein, whence relays of OFS power worked through to Harrismith via Kroonstad. However, the most interesting time was when ore traffic first began to take off in the late fifties when caboose-working was instituted. I first heard about the operation upon my transfer to New Works in April 1969. There was a clerk there, Faan Fouché, who had joined SAR as a fireman in the late 1950’s. He told me the following:\n\nPairs of Class 23s with a caboose attached worked in 21-day cycles out of Bloemfontein. The crews were supposed to work eight hours on and eight hours off but by agreement they worked twelve hour shifts instead. Each cycle began with the picking up of a string of 26 empty AZ hoppers and van in Bloemfontein’s Down block load yard.\n\nThese were taken through to Postmasburg, with engines recoaling at Kamfersdam, outside Kimberley. There they picked up 26 AZ hopper wagons loaded with super-heavy manganese and a van (an approximate load of 2360 tons) and worked through to Kroonstad where the loads were remarshalled into 1500 ton bites for the 1-in-66 grades east of there. At Kroonstad the loaded AZ’s were exchanged for empties and the whole cycle repeated. According to Faan it took roughly two days to complete a loaded/empty cycle over the full route and they managed an average ten cycles on each three-week tour of duty. Faan was a bit vague on dates but I gathered that the workings started sometime during 1959 and continued until the condensers took over the section from Postmasburg to Kamfersdam (the junction just north of Kimberley) about 1962, after which caboose working was discontinued. No reason for this was given by Faan but it could have been that two condensers (at 108ft each!), + caboose + 26 loads + guards van were too long for the loops.\n\nAt none of the refueling points (that is, Postmasburg, Kamfersdam, Hamilton and Kroonstad) were the facilities situated such that coaling could be done with the engines attached to their trains. For example, at Hamilton the train was simply left standing on the main line while the engines uncoupled and moved to the coaling plant situated there. No watering or fire-cleaning could be done at Hamilton so this was done at Kloofeind and Glen. There were four such block loads of iron ore despatched to Maydon Wharf every 24 hours, including Sundays. According to Faan they were always worked by pairs of 23’s and this was borne out by an old work colleague, Ralph Knott, who actually saw the trains. To my regret I neither saw nor photographed them. I remember Ralph predicting that the 23’s would be the first of the big main-line engines to go because of the strenuous nature of this work and he was right.\n\nBy February 1968 caboose working had stopped but block loads of manganese ore from Postmasburg to Maydon Wharf were still coming through at a rate of four every 24hrs. However, by this time steam was only coming on at Beaconsfield and engines were once more being changed in the traditional manner at Bloemfontein, Kroonstad and Bethlehem.\n\n71. 21-down to Springfontein with w/f 16DA 875 approaching Hamilton in July 1968. These wide-firebox 16DAs with their 60sq ft hand-fired grates were not popular with firemen but they seemed to be underrated machines. One who appreciated their good qualities is Les: \"Back in the late 1940s/early 1950s, Bloemfontein engines worked 4-up all the way to Johannesburg, returning the following morning on 11-down. Engine 875 working 4-up was at the head end when a young HLP was waiting to join the train at Vereeniging for the express run to JHB via Kliprivier and Germiston. She carried the name “Margie” and this was my first taste of riding behind a wide-box 16DA. This turn was worked by 16DAs and 16Es up until 1953. The Bloemfontein men were relieved at Vereeniging by Braamfontein crews because they were not familiar with colour-light signals. When I was spending a lot of time in company with Frank Garrison, he told me that #875 back in her Kimberley days (pre-1939, when she was allocated to Beaconsfield), was painted overall blue by her regular crew. They apparently did this because they were part of the Union Limited link working through to Johannesburg. Frank added that the engine crews were tough in those days – it was a long haul all the way from Kimberley to JHB. With this in mind, Charlie McLean also told me that in the 1930s Braamfontein men worked passenger trains all the way to Bloemfontein, even on trains like 11-down, stopping at all stations with class 16C engines!\"\n\n128. This is plate 63 from Victor Hand's \"A Steam Odyssey\". If you are without this book you should get it. Apart from many SAR scenes from the sixties and seventies, and brilliant photos from all over the world, it is the best known cure for the blues that I know about.\n\nHere is Victor's description of how this triple action shot came about: \"Just east of Bloemfontein passenger station the Noupoort main line crosses above the Bethlehem line. South African photographer Charlie Lewis, who lived in Bloemfontein, thought it might be possible to photograph three moving steam trains at this location and he set about making the necessary arrangements. Charlie worked for SAR and knew everyone. He would begin before dawn, visiting the stationmaster, yardmaster and dispatcher and talking with engine crews as they went on duty. Watches had to be synchronised and everyone instructed to watch the movement of the other trains and to make smoke as required. Lewis had tried this shot many times and often got two trains but the third was elusive. One Friday night I was having dinner with Charlie and Melly and the suggestion was made that we try the triple shot in the morning. Arrangements were made and the shot worked! It was my first try.\"\n\n140. Until December 1972 Bloemfontein had quite a comprehensive steam-operated suburban service. Then it was suddenly terminated without warning; SAR was not in the business of winning friends and influencing people. Almost five years earlier this was the evening line-up with 21-down, the 5:12 pm mixed to Springfontein just departing from platform 3 on the left, then 107-down, the 5:19 pm to Kloofeind, ready to depart from platform 4 and the 5:25 to Thaba Nchu from platform 6 on the right. All these trains had 16DAs. In the right background the 12R yard pilot was still sorting coaches.\n\nDid I say 'winning friends'? 21-down's 88-mile run was completely unadvertised. Why SAR bothered with it is a mystery. Here are the notes for train 21 in the Working Time Book:\n\n\"Conveys workmen and passengers for points between Bloemfontein and Springfontein. Conveys direct traffic for Springfontein and the Koffiefontein branch. Must not be used to perform intermediate work. Conveys bogie stock only. May run before time between Edenburg and Springfontein.\" [that last sentence is highlighted by SAR, not me! Pity the poor would-be passenger (assuming he knew about the train) who arrived at his station only to find it left ten minutes ago....]\n\nOne more observation: those thick pipes paralleling the tracks across the bridge were used to provide compressed air for the Westinghouse Electro-pneumatic points machines and colour-light signalling installation which was brought into use in 1958 (see Part 1 of this chapter).\n\n144. We took renowned author and MD of the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway, John Snell, to Bloemfontein locoshed on a Saturday morning in October 1969. He spotted 10C 776 looking forlorn on a back road, took a fancy to her and inquired as to the possibility of getting her out on the line. We put the idea to Gert Coetzee who not only arranged for her to haul Sunday's 08:40 am to Melorane but had her beautifully bulled up. Those were the days......\n\nAn additional note from our coach fundi, Peter Stow: \"Apart from the locomotive, the suburban coaches are of interest. The three represent each version of steel locomotive-hauled suburban coach imported and placed in service between 1949 and 1951. The first is a 6-door 3rd , the second a 5-door 2nd and the third a 4-door 1st . A unique consist. Also of interest is the use of a van at one end only, a practice unique to the OFS and Transvaal Systems, possibly dating back to CSAR days but considered a complete no-no on the Natal and Cape Systems\n\nwhere a van at both ends was insisted upon, even when it was pointed out that elsewhere on the network only one van was used. SAR did have its idiosyncrasies.......\""
