Orange Free State. This province has the most evenlydistributed population of all the provinces, reflecting the agricul-tural conditions of the eastern and central districts and themoderately heavy pastoral industry of the drier west. Most 152 SOUTHKKN AFRICA of the small but evenly distributed towns are more than 4, 000feet above sea-level. In the western rain-shadow area, thetowns are smaller and more widely spaced. The population exceeds 660, 000, about two-thirds of whomare not white. The average density is 12-67 ; the rural densityis 9-96. Bloemfontein is the only large town, and its populationis only 55, 000. The only other town whose population exceeds10, 000 is Kroonstad. Most of the others have a local importanceonly. Like most of the rivers of the Tableland, those of theOrange Free State are too deeply trenched for towns to grow upnear their banks.. Distribution of Asiatics.[One dot denotes 1000 people.] Natal. The area of this province is 35, 284 square miles ; itspopulation in 1921 was 1, 429, 398. Natal is thus the smallest ofthe four provinces (7-47%) ; but it has 20-63% of the populationof the Union, representing also the highest density (40-51).Owing to even temperatures, good rainfall, and the possibility ofclose agriculture, the coastal lowlands may be described as almostdensely populated. Areas with an elevation of over 4, 500 feet, however, are sparsely populated. The towns, of which there is a considerable number, are evenlydistributed, except in the western highlands and in Zululand ; inthe lowlands of the latter there is an almost complete absence ofeven the smallest towns. The largest town is Durban (population151, 000 ; density 1475) ; about one-third of the population isEuropean. Pietermaritzburg is the only other large town, whilstthe third largest is Ladysmith (about 6, 500)."
