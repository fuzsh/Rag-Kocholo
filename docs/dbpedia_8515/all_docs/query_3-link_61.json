The district was formed in 1974 by the merger of the city of Canterbury (then a county borough) with adjoining areas. Canterbury city has a population of about 47,000, whereas the district, covering a much wider area, has a population of some 140,000.\n\nCanterbury Jewish Community\n\nThere was an important Jewish community in Canterbury in the medieval period.\n\nSome believe that the modern Jewish community is the second oldest community in Britain (after London), with Jews having settled there in significant numbers following resettlement in England in the seventeenth century, although definite data is available only from 1760. The community began to decline in the nineteenth and had become defunct by the mid-twentieth century.\n\nBy about the 1970s, Jews living in Canterbury and neighbouring areas, including Hythe and Whitstable, as well as Folkestone, formed themselves into a group for social and cultural events.\n\nJewish Congregations in Kent\n\nJewish Communities of England home page\n\nPage created: 4 November 2005\n\nData significantly expanded and notes added: 19 January 2024\n\nPage most recently amended: 24 January 2024\n\nResearch and formatting by David Shulman\n\nExplanation of Terms | About JCR-UK | JCR-UK home page\n\nContact JCR-UK Webmaster:\n\njcr-ukwebmaster@jgsgb.org.uk\n\n(Note: This is to contact JCR-UK, not the above Congregation)\n\nTerms and Conditions, Licenses and Restrictions for the use of this website:\n\nThis website is owned by JewishGen and the Jewish Genealogical Society of Great Britain.
