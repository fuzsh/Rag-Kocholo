        "text": "Andrew Mlangeni, the last surviving co-defendant convicted with Nelson Mandela in 1964 at the Rivonia Trial, which exposed to the world the harsh segregationist policies of apartheid in his native South Africa and helped define the battles lines in the struggle there against white minority rule, has died in Pretoria. He was 95.\n\nHis death was confirmed on Wednesday by the office of President Cyril Ramaphosa, which said Mr. Mlangeni had died overnight at a military hospital after being admitted because of an abdominal complaint.\n\nAll eight men accused of sabotage at the trial were given life sentences and served long prison terms. Mr. Mandela’s was the longest, 27 years, until his release in 1990 as South Africa began a remarkable transformation to fully democratic elections in 1994.\n\nMr. Mlangeni served 26 years as Prisoner 467/64 (Mr. Mandela was 466/64), much of the time on Robben Island; he was released in 1989. Unlike the charismatic Mr. Mandela, who became South Africa’s first Black president, Mr. Mlangeni cast himself in a more self-effacing role.\n\nAn official biography, written for his charitable foundation in 2017, was entitled “The Backroom Boy,” a reference to his clandestine activities in the underground resistance and, perhaps, to the language of apartheid, when white bosses routinely referred to adult Black underlings as “boy.”\n\nWhen Mr. Mlangeni arrived under heavy guard on Robben Island in 1964, he and other Black convicts in the group were issued prison uniforms with short trousers usually reserved for schoolchildren.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
