Structured psychiatric interviews were conducted to elicit the information. The majority of the participants were young male Africans with low educational levels and poor socio-economic status. Crimes against human beings were the most common ones committed by the offenders. The lifetime prevalence of mental disorders was 54.7%. Personality disorders, followed by substance and addictive disorders, were the most prominent disorders among the study sample. Other psychiatric disorders noted were depressive disorders, schizophrenia, intellectual disabilities and neurocognitive disorders. The results show that mental disorders in prisons go undetected and untreated, meaning that competency to stand trial and criminal responsibility are not always observed. There is a need to conduct more empirical studies on the prevalence and incidences of mental disorders in South African prisons.\n\nKey words: correctional service centres, crime, demographic information, health facilities, mental disorders, offenders, prevalence\n\nIntroduction\n\nInternational epidemiological studies have found that mental disorders are more common in correctional service centres than expected, with major psychiatric disorders being 10 times more prevalent than in the general population (Andreoli et al., 2013). These findings are also supported by Watzke, Ullrich, and Marneros (2006), who pointed out that mental illness in prisons is particularly prevalent, and that the admission rate to correctional service establishments has increased in many countries over the past few years. Other authors such as Zabala-Baños et al. (2016) explain that this phenomenon of the high prevalence of mental disorders in prisons has affected the composition and typology of prison populations, as well as both criminal and behavioural patterns.\n\nAlthough the findings of epidemiological studies on mental health disturbances among prisoners may vary from country to country, the high prevalence of mental illness among prisoners remains the common factor. Data on the prevalence of mental illness in correctional service establishments are of utmost importance for the management of mental diseases, costing, planning and policy formulation by the departments of correctional services and health (Brown, Hirdes, & Fries, 2015). The available literature indicates that risk factors such as social exclusion and inadequate healthcare provisions in correctional service facilities largely contribute to the development of mental disorders in convicted offenders (López, Saavedra, López, & Laviana, 2016).\n\nThere is a rapid growth in the admission rate of prisoners in the correctional service facilities across different countries, with about 10 million prisoners at any time across the globe. In light of these recently published statistics, the frequency of mental disorders in detained offenders has become a debated subject. Lafortune (2010) reports that although there has been a significant increase in the prison population in the last two decades, a large number of prisoners admitted with mental illnesses are undiagnosed and untreated, most of which are missed on admission. The identification and treatment of mental disorders in detained offenders can be difficult if the disorder was missed on admission to correctional services (Graf et al., 2013). Based on the published literature, the high prevalence of mental illnesses among offenders has become a global concern. Correctional centres worldwide are populated with a burden of more than nine million prisoners (Sepehrmanesh, Ahmadvand, Akkasheh, & Saei, 2014).\n\nStandardised routine screening of mental illness on admission could significantly reduce the number of untreated prison inmates and therefore ensure early psychiatric interventions (Parsons, Walker, & Grubin, 2001). Regarding the aforementioned background information, it can be said that mental illness in correctional service facilities may be a heavy burden for government budgets (Al-Rousan, Rubenstein, Sieleni, Deol, & Wallace, 2017). Generally, the provision of mental health services requires adequate and expensive physical and human resources. Sadly, undetected and untreated mental illnesses may result in fatal outcomes. Therefore, regular administration of screening tools in correctional facilities is of the utmost importance. The incidence of suicide among prisoners is reportedly higher than that in the general population (Osasona & Koleoso, 2015).\n\nThis global occurrence of the marked prevalence of mental health issues is likely also to affect South Africa. It is important to note that there is a dearth of data regarding the occurrence of mental disorders in South African correctional and rehabilitation facilities. Naidoo and Mkize (2012) write that South African correctional service centres are the most populated ones in Africa. In March 2015, South Africa had a total prison population of 159,241 according to the World Prison Brief, which ranked it 11th on a scale of the largest prisoner populations globally. It is against this background that the researchers decided to conduct a study on the prevalence of mental disorders in the Bizzah Makhate prison in Kroonstad, South Africa. This is where Winnie Mandela was incarcerated in 1975 during the struggle against apartheid.\n\nThe South African government’s policy is that researchers should focus on their local communities in order to meet their needs; the principal researcher herself is part of the Kroonstad community. The documentation and description of the incidence and prevalence of mental disorders in correctional service centres will assist the government of South Africa in meeting the basic mental health needs of the inmates.\n\nEthical considerations\n\nPermission to conduct this study was obtained from the National Department of Correctional Services, Pretoria. The research was approved by the Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee (HSREC) of the University of the Free State (UFS). Informed consent was obtained from each participant, which was written in three of the South African official languages (English, Afrikaans and Sesotho). Participants’ confidential information was used only for the purpose of the study, and the personal particulars of the participant are not reflected in any documents published.\n\nAim of the study\n\nThe study aimed to determine the prevalence of mental disorders among offenders admitted at the health establishments in Bizzah Makhate Correctional Service Centre, Kroonstad, South Africa. In addition, participants’ socio-demographic characteristics and associated contributing factors were also studied.\n\nResearch questions:\n\nWhat is the prevalence of mental disorders among offenders admitted at health facilities in Bizzah Makhate Correctional Centre?\n\nWhat are the socio-demographic characteristics of those offenders admitted in those facilities?\n\nWhat are the crimes committed by those offenders?\n\nIs there any association between the diagnoses and crimes?\n\nMethod\n\nThe Moqhaka Municipality in South Africa was selected as a geographical area for the completion of this research, at the Bizzah Makhate Correctional Centre (formerly known as Kroonstad Prison), which accommodates 2,205 inmates. The study was conducted among offenders admitted at the health facilities within this correctional service centre. This was a quantitative, descriptive and empirical study. A systematic sampling technique was used for this purpose; systematic sampling is a sophisticated sampling method, which is practical when conducting a study in a population size where the researcher will not be including everyone but selecting possible candidates at equal intervals (Bless, Higson-Smith, & Sithole, 2015).\n\nAdditionally, systematic sampling designs are commonly used methods, which make data collection much more straightforward and are likely to guarantee less biased sample selection (Huang, 2004; Valentine, Affleck, & Gregoire, 2009). Verma, Singh, and Singh (2014) clarify that this method of sampling is simpler, convenient and efficient. It allows researchers to select a sample starting from a fixed point and to continue selecting possible participants at equal intervals, taking into consideration the large number (800) of offenders being evaluated and treated monthly at the health facility of the Correctional Service centre concerned (Bizzah Makhate Prison). The study participants consisted of 150 offenders admitted at the health facilities of the prison in 2018. As of October 2018 there were approximately 800 inmates. The researchers (mental health professionals) decided to select every fourth healthcare service user to be included in the study sample. Other inclusion criteria were that participants were between 18 and 65 years old. Both genders were represented in the sample. Those who were gravely ill and those who were under 18 were excluded from the study because they were not competent to give informed consent. Moreover, interviews were conducted; the duration of the study was six months.\n\nInstruments\n\nStructured psychiatric interviews were conducted to elicit data. The current literature indicates that structured psychiatric interviews are considered to be valid and reliable for modern research and clinical work (Nordgaard, Revsbech, Saebye, & Parnas, 2012). This type of research instrument provides data on preliminary identification including demographic information and examinees’ main complaints, personal description and history of illness (MacKinnon & Yudofsky, 1986; Nordgaard, Sass, & Parnas, 2013). The most crucial component of the psychiatric interview is the Mental Status Examination (MSE), which consists of physical appearance, attitude and behaviour, thought processes, perception, mood and affect, state of consciousness, orientation, memory, insight and judgment, tempo of speech, level of intelligence, mode of thinking, and both hypothalamic and autonomic functions. Lastly, it gives provision for diagnostic formulation. The authors used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM–5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD–10; World Health Organisation, WHO, 1992) diagnostic criteria. The researchers conducted a pilot study on five participants in order to investigate the practical feasibility of the study and the validity and reliability of the psychiatric interview.\n\nData analysis\n\nThe statistical and descriptive analyses were performed in the form of frequencies and percentages for the categorical data and means, standard deviations, medians and percentiles for the continuous data. Quantitative research is a method of collecting data and presenting in numerical means such as tables, charts, graphs and statistics (O’Hara, Carter, Dewis, Kay, & Wainwright, 2011).\n\nResults\n\nOne hundred and fifty offenders participated in this scientific investigation. The sociodemographic characteristics of the participants are presented in .\n\nTable 1.\n\nVariableFrequency%Cumulative frequencyCumulative percentageAge (years) 18–2511677.311677.3 26–351912.713590.0 36–50128.014798.0 51–6532.0150100.0Sex Male12986.012986.0 Female2114.0150100.0Race Black14496.014496.0 Caucasian21.314697.3 Coloured42.7150100.0Marital status Single12583.312583.3 Married2013.314596.7 Divorced32.014898.7 Widowed21.3150100.0District Fezile Dabi2617.32617.3 Lejweleputswa7248.09865.3 Mangaung2013.311878.7 Thabo Mofutsanyana117.312986.0 Xhariep2114.0150100.0Education None42.742.7 Grades 1–85637.36040.0 Grades 9–117348.713388.7 Grade 12128.014596.7 Undergraduate21.314798.0 Postgraduate32.0150100.0Employment status Unemployed/looking for job2919.32919.3 Unemployed/not looking for job3322.06241.3 Formal employment64.06845.3 Informal employment3322.010167.3 Self-employed106.711174.0 Disability grant42.711576.7 Pensioners3523.3150100.0\n\nThe majority of the study sample consisted of males (86%), and mainly black Africans (96%) followed by coloured participants. More than 80% of the research population was composed of single individuals. Almost 50% of them did not finish Grade 12 (secondary school education), while fewer than 5% were in possession of tertiary qualifications. There are five districts in the Free State Province, namely Fezile Dabi, Lejweleputswa, Mangaung (the capital city of the province), Thabo Mofutsanyana and Xhariep; Bizzah Makhathe Correctional Centre is located in Fezile Dabi. However, 48% of the study sample originated from Lejweleputswa, the neighbouring district of Fezile Dabi. Participants’ history of unemployment before incarceration was relatively high, ranging around 40%. A marked portion of these prisoners were on a pension and/or social grant before imprisonment. The crimes committed by the study subjects are presented in .\n\nTable 2.\n\nFrequency%Criminal behaviour Assault2114.0 Robbery4127.3 Murder3926.0 Hijacking3624.0 Possession of illegal firearm42.7 Attempted murder21.3 Rape74.7 Kidnapping64.0 Other4731.3Property crimes Fraud10.7 Burglary3422.7 Arson21.3 Malicious damage to property85.3Organisational criminality White-collar116.7 Organised583.3Public crimes Drugs1610.7 Alcohol10.7 Multiple drug use53.3 Illegal drug business10.7 Sex-related crimes10.7 Public violence1510.0 Other32.0\n\nCrimes against other human beings dominated the distribution of the offences among the sample: criminal acts such as robbery (27.3%), murder (26.0%), motor vehicle hijacking (24.0%) and assaults (14.0%), which are crimes characterised by aggression and violence. Smaller numbers of prisoners were convicted of rape (4.7%) and kidnapping (4.0%). As far as property crime is concerned, it was found that burglary and malicious damage to property were common criminal acts. A notable portion of the study population was convicted of substances-related crimes such as illegally dealing with alcohol and drugs, while 10.0% of the prisoners were found guilty of public violence crimes. Psychiatric diagnoses among the offenders are depicted in .\n\nTable 3.\n\nDisordersFrequency%Lifetime prevalence of mental disorders8254.7Intellectual disability74.7Schizophrenia spectrum96.0Bipolar and related disorders42.7Depressive disorders128.0Neurocognitive disorders42.7Personality disorders3825.3Substance and addictive disorders2315.3Anxiety disorders10.7\n\nAs reflected in , some participants manifested signs and symptoms of mood, anxiety, psychosis, substance use and addictive disorders, personality disorders and intellectual disabilities. It was found that the lifetime prevalence of mental disorders among the prisoners was 54.7% according to DSM–5 criteria. Besides the high prevalence of personality disorders among the participants, the second prevalent diagnosis was substance and addictive disorders, accounting for 15.3% of participants. The researchers also found the notable prevalence of major depressive disorder (8.0%) and schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders at the rate of 6.0%, while 4.7% of the study population was diagnosed with intellectual disabilities. The least prevalent mental disorders were anxiety (0.7%) and neurocognitive, bipolar and related disorders (2.7%). Regarding comorbidity, it was found that 8.7% of the participants who were diagnosed with personality disorders had comorbidity of substance-related and addictive disorders. There were also minor comorbid manifestations of personality and neurocognitive disorders among those who were suffering from depressive disorders and schizophrenia.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe results of the study illustrate that young males (individuals aged between 18 and 35 years) are more vulnerable to committing crimes. This finding is in accordance with what was reported by Diamond, Wang, Holzer, Thomas, and Des Anges (2001), who also reported the same trend in the United States. At the time of the assessment, it was also noted that the majority of the prisoners were of single marital status, most of whom were black Africans. These results are not surprising, and are proportional to the population distribution of South Africa according to the 2011 Census (Statistics South Africa, 2012).\n\nThe mental status among the prisoners in Bizzah Makhate Correctional Service is markedly different from what was reported in Spain. In Spanish prisons, Vicens et al. (2011) found that 44.0% of their study participants were single; this is in contrast to what was found in this study, where more than 80% of the offenders were of single marital status.\n\nIt was found that the majority of the prisoners participating in this study did not complete Grade 12 (secondary/high school education). This might be the reason why the majority of these participants were not formally employed due to their lack of skills required in the labour market. In this study, one surprising finding was that the large portion of this prisoner population was from Lejweleputswa rather than Fezile Dabi, where the centre is geographically located. In general, the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants in this study, in terms of age, gender, education levels and unemployment at the time of their incarceration, are similar to what was reported in Spain by Zabala-Baños et al. (2016).\n\nIt is concerning that the majority of crimes were directed toward other human beings. In this study, it was found that the assault, murder, robbery and motor vehicle hijacking rates were high. These forms of crimes, especially assault and murder, were also reported in Germany by other authors such as Watzke et al. (2006). It was also found that more females than males were found guilty of murder and assault, while sex-related crimes were only perpetrated by men. As far as robbery is concerned, both men and women were almost equally responsible for this type of crime, while motor vehicle hijacking was committed by men only. The fact that the violent crimes were committed by both genders is worrying. Furthermore, it is notable that both male and female prisoners were almost equally criminally responsible for malicious damage to property.\n\nIndividuals diagnosed with intellectual disabilities were more often accused of rape (28.0%) and assault (15.0%), while those who were suffering from schizophrenia were also more likely to commit violent and aggressive crimes such as assault (33.0%), rape (28.4%) and murder (25.0%). Those who presented with bipolar and related disorders were mostly involved in malicious damage to property and burglary, which, combined, accounted for 72.0% of all crimes. Assault was more commonly committed by females than males diagnosed with bipolar mood disorders; 27.4% of males diagnosed with bipolar and related disorders were found guilty of sex-related crimes, especially rape. The notable prevalence of mental disorders among the participants in Bizzah Makhate Correctional Service Centre is of great concern. It has been documented by various forensic mental health professionals that a mental illness itself may affect the faculties of competency to stand trial and the associated criminal responsibility. The finding that the prevalence of mental disorders was more than 50% is troubling. The fact that a marked portion of this study sample was diagnosed with mental disorders such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders and other psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders, intellectual disabilities and neurocognitive disorders is a worrying factor regarding the administration of criminal justice. Under the South African Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977, Sections 77 (competency to stand trial), 78 (criminal responsibility) and 79 (psychiatric report on the mental status of the accused; Department of Justice & Constitutional Development, 1997) require that people appearing before courts of law should be able to understand and follow legal proceedings and must have the mental capacity to understand the charges before them and be able to give sound instructions to their defence team. There are questions about whether all the participants who were diagnosed with intellectual disabilities and schizophrenia were fairly adjudicated by the criminal justice system before being sentenced to prison.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe results of this study confirmed what has been reported in the international literature: mental disorders are common in prison populations. It was found that prisoners at the correctional service centre studied were generally young males of a low socio-economic status. Furthermore, the criminal acts committed were mainly directed at human beings rather than at property. Severe mental disorders such as substance abuse/use disorders, personality disorders, mood disorders (such as major depressive disorder), intellectual disabilities and schizophrenia were found to be relatively prevalent among this study population.\n\nIt appears that a large number of admitted offenders with mental disorders go undetected, undiagnosed and untreated, including at the Bizzah Makhate Correctional Service Centre. The authors recommend the standardised routine screening of the signs and symptoms of mental illness during admission. Early detection and intervention may facilitate the better management of mental disorders in prisons. This will help to reduce the possibility of violent and suicidal behaviours among inmates. It is also recommended that prisoners presenting with intellectual disabilities be placed in specially designated units because they are vulnerable to abuse and other forms of exploitation by the hard-core criminal elements in these centres.\n\nAdditionally, the criminal justice system should always take into consideration the constructs of competency to stand trial and criminal responsibility before sentencing the alleged offenders. This study provides a general picture of the prevalence and incidence of mental health issues in correctional service centres in South Africa. Moreover, it will contribute to the international literature regarding the mental health in prison populations. Furthermore, the study has the capacity to assist policy-makers and managers to meet the primary mental health needs of the offenders. Although the study provides valuable information on mental disorders in prisons, it should be interpreted with caution as far as the making of generalisations is concerned, taking into consideration the small study sample and restricted area of research. The study was conducted in health establishments within the Bizzah Makhate Correctional Centre and therefore did not cover the whole prisoner population in this centre. Lastly, access rules and regulations at the correctional service centres in South Africa should be relaxed to some degree, and be user-friendly, in order to allow academics and scientists to be able to conduct scientific research in this facilities.\n\nEthical standards\n\nDeclaration of conflicts of interest\n\nMosa Bonolo Modupi has declared no conflicts of interest\n\nNathaniel Lehlohonolo Mosotho has declared no conflicts of interest\n\nHelene Engela le Roux has declared no conflicts of interest\n\nEthical approval\n\nAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee [National Department of Correctional Services, Pretoria, and the Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee (HSREC) of the University of the Free State (UFS)] and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n\nInformed consent\n\nInformed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study"
