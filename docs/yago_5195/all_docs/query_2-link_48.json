        "text": "Jenna Luche-Thayer\n\nJenna Luche-Thayer\n\nSenior Advisor - US Government, United Nations, non-profits, corporate social responsibility programs\n\nPublished Oct 9, 2018\n\nFRIENDS,\n\nThe following article was written by Angelica Johannson. It is worth your time to read!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is a difference between some kids and other kids\n\n\"Mom, why is there a difference between kids and other kids, and why are some children important and are getting help - but others are not?\"\n\nThe question came from my 10 year old son Marcus, when the whole family had gathered in front of the TV last Friday to watch the CHILDREN OF THE WORLD GALA.\n\nI know what I WANT to answer, after 45 years as a student of the world's most important commodity product, namely man himself. But I do not want my son to know that answer. Yet, unfortunately, he knows too all well that his laconic question is true, and he has his own experience of why. He still remembers his suffering. His unfortunate destiny, whose consequences and implications are too serious for Swedish healthcare and politics to allow to be even be whispered about, was to be born with congenital borreliosis, Lyme disease, that is, an infected mother infects her fetus, which is therefore born sick with a reduced immune system.\n\nThe Taboo is so total, that all science that proves that what my son and many other children with him suffers from, which is something that can be prevented and treated if knowledge were allowed, has, to date, been actively and consciously silenced by those who say that \"the children are the most important thing we have.\"\n\nI lost a child many years ago, and since then I have safeguarded the health of my children, and if I had known then, what I know today, Emma would still be alive. I was forced to acquire unique knowledge, which one normally should not have, during autodidactic studies of research reports and studies, in discussion and consultation with international experts in the field, for the 8 years since we received the diagnosis and insight to the disease - to understand what I could do to protect and save my other children from suffering the same fate.\n\nSo Marcus received international care and is currently in remission and I hope he will remain as healthy and strong as he became with right medication remedies and care. All at my family’s expense, because we had to pay privately.\n\nToday I head an association, VIDAS, where we among other things work for other children to get the right healthcare in their own country. I am also a member of an international organization that is very active to make global change, and as such, we influence the WHO and the UN in their work with standard diagnostic codes, called “ICD codes” (International Codes of Diseases).\n\nDue to Sweden's current attitude and politics, I have seen many parents and children, unnecessarily, suffer and, in too many cases, die, because mothers do not get knowledge of proper care, in time, in Sweden, but have to seek help and care beyond our borders to protect or alleviate and cure what threatens the children's lives and health.\n\nTwo months ago, the message came that we were successful in our intention to change the Lyme codes –although more complications still need recognition. In May 2019 the WHO will begin implementation of their ICD11 to include code 1C1G .2 Congenital Lyme Borreliosis. And last Saturday, it was announced that Canada will recognize maternal-fetal transmission of Lyme, which will save many children's lives. All 193 member states will adhere to the new codes by January 2022.\n\nWhen will Sweden, which have made itself reputation as a humanistic, scientific and fair nation, follow suit and prove to my sons, brothers and sisters of fate, that their experiences belong to the past, and no longer is true - or even \"trueish\" to use the famous author Tage Danielsson's words? Then we will see if I have the accountable answer for Marcus.\n\nThis upcoming weekend, I will attend the Nordic Consensus Congress for Lyme borreliosis –with the WHO’s decision in my back pocket."
