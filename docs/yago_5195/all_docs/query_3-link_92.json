        "text": "The creative project for my Master of Philosophy Creative Writing was conceived as a time-slip fantasy for 8 to 12-year-old readers with the working title Time Squad. It tells the story of an 11-year-old girl, Tiggy, who moves to Brisbane after her mother inherits the family’s overgrown ‘ancestral home’. Tiggy and her new neighbour Hamish discover the ghost of the original owner, Sir Harry Barnard, has set them a quest. In fulfilling the quest they solve a series of century-old puzzles and challenges and finally reveal the full magic of the old house. The book is designed as the first in a light-hearted optimistic holiday adventure series written for emerging readers and pursuing themes of the environment, Australian identity, what it means to be an Australian girl, our history – both personal and national – and the ghosts who speak to us from it. However, I found issues such as divorce, family conflicts and financial difficulties emerging as I wrote, pushing my optimistic adventure novel into domestic issues-based territory. At some level, I seemed to believe that writing well for contemporary children needed to involve serious life issues. This led me to ask two questions in my critical paper ‘Putting the Child back into Children’s Literature’. What qualifies as excellent children’s literature for younger readers today? And, are younger readers well served by that standard? This exegesis uses the work of developmental psychologist Jean Piaget and Gough and Tunmer (The Simple View of Reading) to create an understanding of younger readers’ systems of thought, modes of cognition, decoding skills and life experience. Applying this developmental framework to five years of winning books from the peak children’s literature awards of the Newbery Medal (USA), Carnegie Medal (UK) and Children’s Book Council of Australia Book of the Year, the analysis concludes that eight out of 15 awardwinning novels did not meet younger readers on their development curve. This was predominantly caused by a traumatic reality which set too high a listening comprehension (LC) factor for Gough and Tunmer, and in Piaget’s terms, required a higher stage of development than the concrete operational younger reader. A trend toward prizing issues-based literature has developed which may explain the initial pressure I felt as a writer to move away from my creative vision for Time Squad. Recognising that the movement toward prizing realist, trauma-based texts may not serve younger readers allowed me to justify alternate solid ground for excellence in positioning the themes, characters, settings, language and plot in Time Squad closer to my original creative vision, better meeting 8 to 12-year-olds on their development curve. An optimistic outdoor holiday adventure, functional families, simple language and a happy ending are still worthwhile for contemporary younger readers.\n\nThis paper provides a critical analysis of the portrayal of the girl-child by Erna Muller in It all goes wrong (2014) and When you dance with the crocodile (2014). The two novels were selected using purposive sampling as they primarily characterise girl-children as protagonists. The researchers employed the African feminist literary theory as argued by Chukwuma (2006) in this study. The African feminist literary theory was used to study how the girl-child is portrayed in a patriarchal world. Content analysis was used to examine the depiction of the girl-child in the two novels. The study revealed that in both novels the girl-characters make independent decisions and act on them, while other characters such as adults and boys play secondary roles. The study found that Erna Muller portrays the girl-child as innocent, open minded, caring, adventurous, assertive, compasssionate and brave. All in all, it can be concluded that Muller uses the two novels to empower the girl-child. Introduc..."
