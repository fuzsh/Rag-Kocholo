(Basically to tell them about open source, scale-out, reference customers, and most importantly: Don't sell Cluster on your own, call me first.) Being a Telecom Sales Engineer, I was sent to tour the Ericsson account team meeting, the Nokia account team meeting, and for logistical reasons even the Siemens account team meeting that was at the same location as the Nokia team.\n\nEach meeting had nicer and nicer dinners, but the Ericsson account team meeting in Stockholm was clearly the winner. The dinner was set in the City Hall restaurant (Stadshuskällaren), which is also were they serve the Nobel gala dinners. Our menu was a copy of the 1981 Nobel menu, served on the authentic Nobel porcelain.\n\nI thought that if I was going to be at a Nobel gala dinner (clone), I wanted to give an \"acceptance speech\". Since Physics was my university major, I chose the below well known Swedish monologue about nuclear power. My monologue was well received - a related factoid is that the official entertainment for our dinner was embarrasingly un-funny, so at least my monologue saved something of the evening.\n\nThe original monologue was performed in 1979 by acclaimed Swedish comedian Tage Danielsson. Sweden had in 1980 a referendum where a majority voted against using nuclear power (to this day Sweden still uses it though). The accident in Harrisburg was the major nuclear disaster of that day, Chernobyl would only happen 6 years later.\n\nThe main joke in the Swedish original actual plays on the words \"sanning\" (truth, fact) and \"sannolikhet\" (likelihood, probability) where the literal translation of likelihood is \"like truth\". Unfortunately this is not possible to translate into English, but I tried to make a funny monologue around the original idea.\n\nI've also found an independent translation here https://www.swedishenglishtranslation.com/danielsson.htm, but decided to perform my own translation instead. I concluded the other translation does an even poorer job of translating the un-translatable joke.\n\nThis is the youtube video of the original Tage Danielsson performance. Happy Midsummer!\n\nAbout likelihoods\n\nTage Danielsson, \"Under Dubbelgöken\", 1979\n\nTranslation: Henrik Ingo, 2008\n\nLikelihood. I reckon that is something that is\n\nlikely to be a fact. I mean, not\n\ntruly a fact, but like a fact. And it is therefore\n\nwith regret that I've noticed - likely\n\ndue to the current downturn in the economy - that it\n\nseems we cannot really afford to get true facts anymore, but\n\nonly likelihoods. This I regret, because the\n\nlikelihoods are not always as reliable as true facts are. For\n\ninstance, sometimes the likelihood can be very different before\n\nand after.\n\nI mean, for instance, before Harrisburg... I mean before\n\nit was highly unlikely\n\nthat what happened in Harrisburg could ever happen. But then when it\n\nhad happened... well then the likelihood went straight up to 100\n\npercent, so that it became almost like a fact that it had happened.\n\nBut then only almost\n\na fact. This is what puzzles\n\nme. Because there are still those that will say (at least quietly to\n\nthemselves) that what happened in Harrisburg, well it was so highly\n\nunlikely, that likely maybe it didn't really happen at all. The whole\n\nSocialdemocratic party has in fact been waiting for half a year now\n\nto get a report on whether what happened in Harrisburg really\n\nhappened or not, so that they could then finally decide whether they\n\nwill think that nuclear power is as dangerous as it would be if what\n\nhappened in Harrisburg really happened. But now I heard that they\n\nfinally have made up their mind, and it seems they have decided that\n\nwhat happened in Harrisburg really didn't happen,\n\nbut that on the other hand we need to have much better\n\nsecurity in our\n\nnuclear plants so that it\n\ndoesn't happen here too!\n\nAnd it is\n\nunderstandable that they are in doubt, because I've read that based\n\non all the likelihood calculations, such an accident is\n\nlikely to happen only about once in thousands of years! So in that\n\ncase it is of course quite unlikely that it would already have\n\nhappened by now, don't you think! No, it is of course much\n\nmore likely that it would have happened much later. And that of\n\ncourse gives quite a different perspective on things... because, I\n\nmean, that is then something we cannot know today... what might be\n\nthen... or... I don't know.\n\nThen there is this other thing that is important to\n\nremember to take into account in those likelihood calculations, which\n\nis that IF it after all\n\nwould turn out to be a fact that what happened in Harrisburg really\n\nhappened - against all odds\n\n- then the likelihood for it to happen again...\n\nwell that's just so ridiculously small that... you know, in a way you\n\ncould say that it was really good that what happened in Harrisburg\n\nreally happened, because now we can be almost certain that it cannot\n\nhappen again! Or at least not in Harrisburg! And at least not at the\n\nsame time as the last one happened!\n\n... No ... The\n\nlikelihood for that is so small that it is negligible.\n\nAnd a negligible likelihood means that it doesn't really exist.\n\nExcept just a little bit.\n\nAll of this is of course a bit complicated for the\n\naverage person. So to have a referendum on such a complex issue is\n\nlikely not a very good idea, since most people will just wrongly\n\nconclude that what happened in Harrisburg really did happen. They'll\n\njust take it as a fact."
