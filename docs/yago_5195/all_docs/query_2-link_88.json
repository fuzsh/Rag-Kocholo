What film made you fall in love with cinema?\n\nWhen I was a kid I got the DVD for Pirates of The Caribbean. I remember watching the full movie and then the extra-disc with the behind the scenes footage and being completely mesmerized by the stunts and the sheer volume of work that goes into making a movie.\n\n11. Your favorite film theatre? What do you like about it?\n\nA small cinema in the archipelago named Blidö Bio. During my childhood, we always took the boat to this particular cinema in the summers, and it is where I have had some of my earliest memories of film.
