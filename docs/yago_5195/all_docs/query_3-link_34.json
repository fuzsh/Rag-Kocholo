        "text": "Humans have been on a suidal path for 50 years. I believe the only thing that MIGHT save us is a shift in consciousness. From having ego as the operating system to putting our heart and soul in the drivers seat. It´s sounds complicated, but all it requires is WILLINGNESS.

That soundtrack goes hard. But then again, I'm a sucker for a good musical. I'm also a sucker for a great read. When I saw a book titled \"Barnum\" - I had to check it out. It was quite a surprise to me that Barnum's life looked a lot different from the movie. Diving into the world of P.T. Barnum through Robert Wilson's book has been an absolute delight. He was a man driven by boundless energy, and unwavering optimism. Wilson captures Barnum's resilience, especially during moments of crisis. His ability to remain cool-headed amidst chaos was nothing short of remarkable. What struck me most was the multifaceted nature of Barnum. While some paint him with a single brushstroke, his story reveals a more nuanced portrait. You've likely heard the famous Barnum quote, \"there's a sucker born every minute\". Only, there is no evidence that he ever spoke it. He certainly never wrote it. Barnum lived with a zest for life, great humor, and the ability to navigate the peaks and valleys. Barnum's story is a life well-lived, filled with lessons, adventures, and a spirit worth emulating. He faced challenges, even enduring injustice for his beliefs, yet he held firm. To raise awareness of the corrupt legal system, he voluntarily went to prison instead of paying bail. Barnum's life wasn't without controversy or setbacks. In an era of quick judgments, it's essential to appreciate the depth of historical figures. Barnum's tale isn't just a spectacle; it's a narrative of resilience, innovation, and a celebration of embracing life in all its forms. This book has been a reminder that amidst historical criticism, there's a wealth of lessons and inspiration waiting to be discovered. #Books #BookReflections #Reading #Resilience\n\nShakespeare's First Folios: now on display in a high-tech Fort Knox. The Folger Shakespeare Library's newly unveiled vault is a dazzling spectacle, housing a collection of First Folios that's both priceless and, well, pricey.
