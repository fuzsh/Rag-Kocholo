        "text": "Filmoteca Española, the Instituto Universitario del Cine Español de la Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando present the largest film exhibition on Picasso in the framework of the Picasso Celebration 1973-2023.\n\nFilmoteca Española, the Instituto Universitario del Cine Español Carlos III de Madrid and the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, organize this cycle that presents an overview of Picasso's multifaceted relationship with cinema, in the largest film exhibition on the painter in the last quarter of a century.\n\nAs Manuel Palacio, curator and author of the text that introduces the cycle points out, \"Picasso has become a galaxy in which each activity of his many artistic orbits forms its corresponding planetary systems. There is, then, a Picasso and cinema system, which relates the painter, his work, his iconography, with the moving image\". This cycle seeks to help understand the systemic relationships in which cinema and Picasso connect: as a collaborator in film creation, as witnessed by his participation in The Picasso Mystery (Henri - Georges Clouzot, 1955); when cinema turns him into a filmic subject, through his representation in biopics immortalizing his figure, one of the most recognizable in the art world. \"Of course, Picasso as an icon image transcends his artistic work. To immortalize his figure, undoubtedly one of the most recognizable in the art world, photography collaborated decisively. His print with a striped sailor shirt by Robert Doisneau was just one of the many snapshots taken by an artist who, as they say, loved the camera.\n\nPicasso loved cinema. There are references that he used to go to Parisian movie theaters in the company of Apollinaire to enjoy the films of Charles Chaplin in the 10's of the 20th century. In the following decades, various testimonies indicate his regular attendance to film screenings and premieres in the Paris of the thirties and forties, in fact, he met Dora Maar at the press premiere of the left-wing film, shot in cooperative, The Crime of Mr. Lange by Jean Renoir (1936).\n\nThe cycle Misterio Picasso (1973-2023) takes up the title of Clouzot's film, and is part of the series of events organized by the National Commission for the Commemoration of the anniversary of Picasso's death. The sessions have been grouped in several blocks, with the hope of helping to better understand the roughness of the \"Picasso system\" and the planets that connect him with the cinema and the Spanish and Catalan culture. Without forgetting the exhibition of some international films of recognized prestige for the history of cinema.\n\nApril 8, 2023 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the death of the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, an event that will mark the celebration of his work and artistic legacy in France, Spain and internationally.\n\nThe governments of France and Spain have agreed to work together on an international program through a bi-national commission that brings together the cultural and diplomatic administrations of the two countries.\n\nThe Picasso Celebration 1973-2023 revolves around some fifty exhibitions and events to be held at renowned cultural institutions in Europe and North America that together address a historiographical analysis of his work. The commemoration, accompanied by official celebrations in France and Spain, will make it possible to take stock of research and interpretations of Picasso's work, especially during the major international symposium in the fall of 2023, which, moreover, coincides with the opening of the Centre d'Etudes Picasso in Paris.\n\nThe Musée national Picasso-Paris and the Spanish National Commission for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the death of Pablo Picasso are pleased to support this exceptional program.\n\nThe cycle will be presented at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando on March 30, at 12:00, in an event presented by Valeria Camporesi, director of Filmoteca Española, and Manuel Palacio, curator of the cycle. Admission will be free.\n\nCommissariat\n\nManuel Palacio\n\nVenues\n\nPRESENTATION OF THE CYCLE\n\nRoyal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando. Guitarte Hall. Thursday, March 30, 12:00 noon.
