        "meta_description": "So, this is Christmas.. by The Second Hand Orchestra, released 05 December 2023\n\n1. Nu så kommer julen\n2. Happy X-mas (War is over)\n3. Jingle Bells\n4. Räven raskar över isen (jam)\n5. White Christmas\n6. Raska fötter springa tripp, tripp, tripp\n7. Fairytale of New York\n8. Det strålar en stjärna\n9. Karl Bertil Jonssons julafton\n10. O Holy Night\n11. Happy New Year\n12. Auld Lang Syne\n\nThe conductor says:\r\n&quot;CHRiSTMAS SONGS? Well, yes...\r\nPerhaps we don’t need another generic, big budget Christmas album with the same glossy arrangements for the 101st time... \r\nBut this is not one of those. \r\n\r\nThe working title for the album was ”The Second Hand Orchestra – chewing the home-cooked christmas candy”. \r\nAnd the idea was to bring back the love we once had for these songs, so we decided to go into a studio with free minds and have some loose jams. Some of the songs we could not remember fully, so we focused on specific parts and others we knew (too well) and had to play around with them a little to make them ours. While not being professionals at cooking christmas candy, we really put our love into this and yes, you can eat as many as you like!&quot;\r\n-\r\n\r\nThe Swedish 8-piece DIY orchestra (with a loose line up of ace musicians coming and going) is led by Karl Jonas Winqvist who also is the label founder of Sing a song fighter and a producer (James Yorkston,the Senegalese acts Wau Wau Collectif, and Assiko Golden Band De Grand Yoff, Vumbi Dekula&#39;s &quot;Congo Guitar&quot; and many more..). \r\n\r\nThe Second Hand Orchestra has previously released three inventive, charming instrumental albums that UK label and store Honest Jon&#39;s described sounding as a &quot;lo-fi, homegrown mix of unreleased demos from Penguin Café Orchestra and Moondog&quot;. \r\n\r\nThe orchestra have recently made the soundtrack for the award winning documentary &quot;Det krokiga och det raka (crooked lines of beauty)&quot; which was aired on Swedish national Tv and is now making the film festivals rounds.\r\n\r\nIn 2024 the second hand orchestra (who also feature Lina Langendorf from Langendorf United on horns) will for the 3rd time act as the backing band on the new James Yorkston album (out on Domino) which also feature Nina Persson (the cardigans).\r\nBut with many tricks on their sleeves they have now cooked up an amazing, playful Christmas album full of life.",
