        "text": "Sweden recently issued its annual Christmas stamps, a favorite with youngsters and adults.\n\nFive nondenominated stamps, each worth 4.5 kronor, depict images from a popular animated television show featuring cartoon characters. The show, adapted from Tage Danielsson's 1964 book, \"Tales for Children Over 18 Years,\" has been televised in Swedish every Christmas Eve for 27 years.\n\nSwedish 'Robin Hood' honored\n\nThe stamps relate the story of 14-year-old Karl-Bertil Jonsson, a bespectacled lad who works in the post office in Stockholm during the holidays. His idol is Robin Hood -- and while sorting mail, he diverts packages addressed to children of affluent families to those of the poor.\n\nHis father discovers the switch. At first he is overcome by shame, but his feelings turn to pride when he learns that the rich families are pleased the gifts have gone to less-fortunate children.\n\nThe stamp designs are caricatures of Karl-Bertil, his father and recipients of the gifts.\n\nHistoric church also featured\n\nFour other Christmas stamps, each worth 8 kronor, feature churches renowned for their striking architecture.\n\nThe Kiruna Church, located in Lapland, is a wooden structure with large windows. On its roof are 12 gilt sculptures, with such names as Inspiration, Rapture, Pride, Love and Sorrow. The church was built between 1909 and 1912 in a design resembling a Laplander's hut.\n\nThe Tensta Church bell tower in eastern Uppland was built in 1756, but its large bell was cast in 1512, making it the oldest surviving bell in Sweden.\n\nThe Habo Church in Vastergotland, western Sweden, was built in the 17th century and features baroque and rococo paintings.\n\nThe history of the Sundborn Church, built in 1755 in Dalarna, in central Sweden, includes an interesting story of celebrated artist Carl Larsson. In 1905, Larsson took responsibility for the church's decoration after the untimely death of his artist son, Ulf, that same year.\n\nCarl initially felt uninspired and could not pursue his artistic endeavor. Shortly after, he regained his spirit and offered to paint the church at no cost. The result? Walls festooned with angels, flowers, doves, tendril designs and arabesques.\n\nInformation on the stamps is available at www.posten.se/stamps.\n\nMixed results\n\nSemi-postal stamps have experienced mixed results in many countries as an increasing number of postal patrons regard them as a tax and refuse to purchase them. The stamps are printed with two numerals; the first as the postal fee and the second, followed by a plus sign, is a surcharge for a charity or other social causes.\n\nThe United States has issued two semi-postals and both have been successful, the U.S. Postal Service reported.\n\nIn 1998, a breast cancer research semi-postal was issued worth 40 cents: 32 cents for first-class letter rate and 8 cents for research. Since then, 412.2 million semi-postals have sold, reaping $28.8 million for research.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Postal service issued a 45-cent Heroes semi-postal honoring rescuers of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack: 37 cents for the letter rate and 8 cents for the rescue effort. Since then, 65.5 million stamps have sold, netting $5.5 million.\n\nBoth semi-postals now sell for 45 cents, with 8 cents benefiting the causes.\n\nXDominic Sama is stamps columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer."
