Beautifully brought to life by Sven’s ingenious illustrations, this book offers suggestions for crafts and activities that use what nature has to offer: make bird food, grow seeds, create pretty necklaces and toys, build a mini composter, measure the wind and rain, and make a beautiful ice lantern. Learn how you can help animals and plants by collecting, fixing, crafting, building, exploring and baking. By making creative use of things from around the house and garden, readers young and old can discover how much of what surrounds us can be reused and recycled. Fun, climate-friendly and affordable!\n\n“If you are a Findus and Pettson fan you will love this book and will find lots to do throughout the year.” –Saffia Farr, Juno Magazine, issue 38\n\n“A calendar of craftiness from my long term Swedish sweethearts, Findus and Pettson.” –Playing by the book\n\nAbout the authors\n\nEva-Lena Larsson and Kennert Danielsson are based at Gothenburg Botanical Garden, where they work with horticultural therapy and environmental education. With this book they want to share the joy of nature activities, whether it is growing plants, building windmills, baking currant cakes or just being outdoors. Recycling is a keyword in the book and the only limit is your imagination.\n\nIn total over 18 million copies of Pettson and Findus books have been sold worldwide and they have been translated into 55 languages. A Year With Findus was originally published as Pyssla med Findus by Opal bokförlag."
