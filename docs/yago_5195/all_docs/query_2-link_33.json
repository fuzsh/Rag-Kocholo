        "text": "I hope I’m doing this right, it seemed like the best place to ask this question.\n\nWhat is your favorite site / method for uploading your music in order to share with others? I have heard lots of things about numerous websites people use to upload their music, but I’d like to get the opinions of people from here. When I first started doing my own thing, I got on board with clyp.it, but after returning there after such an extensive hiatus, I find that they no longer allow uploading for free, which was arguably the greatest thing about it.\n\nI could also return to using my ancient YouTube channel, which then prompts another question in the same line for people who use this method: what is the best software for recording to this end? Personally, all I’d need is a good screen capture program to do what I like with that.\n\nThank you for your time\n\nI think you’re right about spreading your music out there to as many places as possible. I do want to add one post script to the discussion on Spotify. I’ve of course heard many arguments/complaints about Spotify and the little money that they pay out for streaming, however, I just finished a course on this subject by Steven Melin, who is a very successful indie film/game composer and has a lot of music on Spotify and Audio Jungle.\n\nHe did a comparison between a number of different music streaming sites/services, what they pay for streams or downloads and level of site traffic. What he found was that, although Spotify doesn’t pay out the biggest amount among streaming services, they receive near 40% of all music streaming traffic and therefore actually pay out the biggest amount to artists. He’s reaching around $1000+ total for just Spotify plays, but this of course is because he’s uploaded around 100+ of his tracks, and most are associated with popular games.\n\nHis point was that if you can write quality music and write, write, write consistently, putting them on Spotify is a real solid option. BUT, yes, put your out to as many places as possible.\n\nThere are two points that you have said that are important.\n\nFirst, you need quality tracks. Quality tracks are tracks that are similar to what people hear what they love, and most likely all of them are from people who know what they do aka. professionals or at least a really good level (they have the tools, knowledge, and talent to pull those tracks out.)\n\nSecond, the traffic and/or connection to already popular topics (games, tv-shows, movies, featured artists, etc.)\n\nBoth things you can only have if you are doing it for years, building connections, building repertoire, building your brand & name in the industry. All of it takes a lot of time and effort. And that’s what most people don’t see first. They only see the “end-result”. Like: “That’s the reference…”. But in my opinion, it’s wrong to see or analyze this way. It’s not what other people achieved and what they say what they think what “possible” is. It’s first truly understanding and being aware of what they actually did to get to where they are today and what they have now.\n\nAs well, don’t forget that what they did so far maybe worked out pretty well due to the market situation. It doesn’t mean that someone who starts out today or has those goals will achieve it even with putting in the same or even more work into it, due to the fact that the markets are changing very quickly today. For example: What happens if Spotify goes broke tomorrow? Just hypothetical. And most of your attention was there? You worked for years to achieve what others told you they’ve achieved the last 6 years, and suddenly you see it doesn’t work nearly well for yourself.\n\nFirst, the attention should be only to your main craft and passion. Building your “character”, like in a video game. And in parallel, you’ll see after a while what platform or service, or library, or website goes into the direction that you like most in terms of ROI. aka. you start focusing even more on that one or two.\n\nBut before all that you should and everybody else too, of course, answering the most important question: What do you really want? Do you want to make money by making music? Do you want “fame”?\n\nWhat I actually mean by that is that people who start out or are about to take the next step in how to make a business in that business are focusing too much on the money game. And that’s why I believe so many are quitting after a while as they look at others what they “promise” them, not really, but that’s what all people see $$$ and after a while realize that they never achieve those numbers or clicks, or views, or whatever. And then they ask why it doesn’t work out. And when you look at it, you quickly see what the issue is: lack of focus, lack of persistence, lack of passion, lack of durability, lack of social interaction, lack of thousands of other components that are required to get to that level everyone wants to “achieve”. Start with that first, and no matter the platform or website or whatever the market is telling you there is, you’ll get it sooner or later with that intention.\n\nWow. Yeah! Great stuff. That article is basically the direction I was talking about.\n\nI think one of the most important sentences there is what Jim Carrey has said. People will realize that money is NOT the answer.\n\nAnother very important fact is that at least 75% of people don’t live their life with purpose. There are so many times I asked myself that question, and I still ask myself quite often…maybe not every day…but at least x-times a month what I actually did to help and serve others. That’s such a strong question to ask. As if you can’t answer it, you are exactly those 3 out of 4 who don’t have a purpose of life.\n\nThe article is brutal. It’s exactly the way what it is about. However, there are so many things inside, you need another article to go into that. Too much stuff to talk about.\n\nWhat I liked the most is what I have said before. It’s not about music. Music is just a small part of it. It all starts in your head and your inner self. If that is not “tuned” right, you are missing the point. A very big point is “expectations”. I really like that, as I can personally relate to it. It’s not only your personal expectations but as well what others expect from you. And that’s the point where a lot of people die off when doing things they love the most. It takes time to find the right balance to set the expectations just right, so you can progress. But if they are too high or too low, you’ll never be the person you could be. What I have found out for me is that I don’t care anymore what other people expect from me if that doesn’t resonate with what I expect from myself.\n\nAnother important point is that the article is not what young talents could understand instantly. You need to go through some phases of life to more or less “get” what Jake has written there. I mean even older people still don’t understand the principles he describes. Like “buying things to impress others”. But that’s what society has taught us from the very beginning. Because we think automatically that if we don’t have something, like a specific car, phone, or even plugin, we are not “worth” it. So to be “worth it”, they suggest us to buy it, so we later understand that we never needed it.\n\nThere is a very good documentary on Netflix called “Minimalism - Less is now”. It’s great. And it shows exactly where we as humans are now. I think the greatest thing is to realize that you really don’t need a lot of stuff to be satisfied with your life. And when you have found out what it is, you’ll see that you don’t need “more” to be happy. But again, it all starts inside yourself. That’s what Jim Carrey means: You can’t buy happiness."
