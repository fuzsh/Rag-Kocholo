        "text": "ALL those kids in New York who have been longing to see a movie in the original Swedish can now throng to the 23d Street Triplex, where ''Ronja Robbersdaughter'' opens today. The adventures of Ronja, the spunky daughter of the leader of a medieval band of rovers, or, more plainly, robbers, and Birk, the son of the leader of a rival band, have reportedly been seen by a quarter of the Swedish population, which must mean every prepubescent in the land.\n\nThe rovers are as merry as Robin Hood's men and more musical if less kempt. Their choruses, a robust sort of Gregorian chant, grow on one, unlike their high jinks, which just weigh on one - although it's not often you get to see such hulks cavorting in the snow in the altogether.\n\nTheir leader, Mattis, ''the mightiest rover in all these forests'' (played with gusto by Borje Ahlstedt), overflows with affection for his only child, Ronja, who at the age of 11 goes forth to ready herself for life and leadership of the band. In the forest, she meets, in addition to wholesome Birk, cowardly gray dwarfs; vicious vultures called vittras who shriek words like ''claw,'' ''kill'' and ''hunt children'' (but do no damage whatever); cutely curious little folk who are always asking ''What for?,'' and the Dark Spirits who try to draw Ronja to them. She also leaps the Devil's Gap, strolls through the Wolf's Gorge and finds shelter in the Bear's Cave. Astrid Lindgren, a writer popular with the younger sets of several countries for ''Pippi Longstocking,'' drew on Nordic myth for her screenplay.\n\nRonja and Birk (Hanna Zetterberg and Dan Hafstrom in their first movie roles) take turns saving each other from mild dangers. They make a pretty pair, bickering affectionately, romping through the shimmering glades and skinny dipping in the shimmering waters. Their adventures, as directed with glints of humor by the late Tage Danielsson, should inspire no nightmares, and not a drop of blood is shed in the battles between the rival bruisers. It's a picturesque movie, filled with advertisements for Sweden's crashing waterfalls, deep woods and stony caverns. Some touches of animation, mainly involving those vittras, are worked in smoothly with the photography."
