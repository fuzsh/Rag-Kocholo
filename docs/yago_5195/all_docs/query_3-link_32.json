        "text": "“ I wanted to say I'm sorry. But it's just that you're already so rich and happy without that present. So that I wanted to see that it spread a little sunshine on the lower rungs of society's ladder. „ ~ Christopher apologizing to Mr. Bergendahl for stealing his Christmas gift.\n\nChristopher Jonsson (or Karl-Bertil Jonsson in the original swedish version) is the titular main protagonist of the famous comical tale Christopher's Christmas Mission by Tage Danielsson, as well as all subsequent retellings and adaptations. He is a 14 year old swedish boy who works as a mail sorter and makes up a plan to take rich people's Christmas packages and give to the poor.\n\nIn the famous 1975 swedish animated short film based on the book, he's voiced by Per Andrén.\n\nBiography[]\n\nChristopher Jonsson is a 14 year old swedish boy who works as a mail sorter at the postal office. He sorts packages and letters and daydreams about becoming like his favourite hero, Robin Hood. He decides to be like Robin Hood, take from the rich and give to the poor. So he makes a plan to steal parcels addressed to people with titles like \"director\" and with an annual salary over 50 000 a year, even a gift to his own father. On Christmas Eve he dresses in his father's Santa suit and goes to town with his sack full of the stolen parcels and randomly gives them to poor, unemployed and outcast people in the town. Even though the gift may not always fit the receiver, for example an old widow getting a bottle of Aqua Vera (aftershave), they are still very happy and grateful for at least getting a gift. The people honour him and they celebrate and sing together at a pub. On Christmas Day Auntie Martha calls Christopher's mother and asks her about a gift she'd send. Mrs. Jonsson says they haven't gotten any gift from her and asks Christopher if he knows anything about this. He tells the truth about his plan to steal presents and that he has given them to poor outcasts. His father is really angered by this, scolders him and sends him to bed while saying he'll have to apologize to everyone he stole from.\n\nThe next day Christopher and his father goes to the home of Mr. Bergendahl and Charles says his son wants to apologize for stealing a Christmas gift. Christopher apologizes but explains he only wanted to spread a little happiness to less fortunate people. Mr. Bergendahl isn't angered by Christopher's actions, instead he honours the boy and thanks him. Christopher and his father travels to many people Christopher stole from and they all say the same thing. Charles eventually understands that his son actually did something good and honours together with other people he stole from. They arrive at home and Charles tells the whole family that Christopher is a very kind and humble human being and that he's proud of what he did.\n\nCultural impact[]\n\nChristopher's Christmas Mission, or its original swedish title \"Sagan om Karl-Bertil Jonssons Jul\", (lit. \"The Tale of Karl-Bertil Jonsson's Christmas\") was first published in the book \"Sagor för barn över 18 år\", (lit. \"Tales for children over 18 years\") by Tage Danielsson. In 1975 an animated short film was made based on the story and it has since become a classic in swedish culture, with it being shown traditionally on Christmas Eve every year. With classic lines like \"Ska du lukta på glöggen pojk?\" (eng. \"Would you like to sniff the spiced wine son?\") and \"Jag har närt en kommunist vid min barm!\" (eng. \"I've harboured a communist in my breast!\") being known by many people. A debate about the moral character of the fairy tale has been sparked a few years ago when SVT (Sweden's Television Stock Company) started broadcasting the Christmas fairy tale annually, with critics arguing that it was political and that stealing is not on par with the traditional Christmas spirit, and others defending it. Danielsson himself was troubled that there was too serious an analysis of the saga."
