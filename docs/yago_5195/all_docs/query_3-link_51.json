A guide to decolonial theory and practice by Sandew Hira published by Amrit Publishers more specifically. Aligning with emerging discussions regarding the need to trouble the colonially framed ways of mainstream academia and academic writing itself, I – like an increasing number of scholars, including Sandew Hira – attempt to present these reflections in what may appear as unconventional writing. This paper is organized in six sections that talk to the human condition across the territories of the contemporary planet based on situating and historicizing its narrative as a response to emerging decolonial waves that have so far marked academic settings differently across the global North and the global South, including my open-ended reading of Sandew Hira’s 2023 volume. In lieu of a standard summary, this reflective paper functions as an expanded teaser to the volumes rich and troubling offerings.\n\nOddities? Three Notes from Early October 2023 and Opening Thoughts1\n\n4/10 2023\n\nNote 1\n\nThe world is at odds (or so it seems).2 The Russian-Ukrainian war became a new layer to other “unraveling’s” with the increasing strides right-wing and neo-Nazi movements have made inside and outside European nation-states in recent years, the individual men (often men, but not always men), who strike at the heart of civilized existence through acts of violence against ordinary people in European and USA spaces, the continuing waves of desperate human beings traversing the Mediterranean waters in dingy vessels, perishing in attempts to reach what is perceived as a better existence and being pushed back into the waters by the more developed and civilized powers … this list of oddities is loooonnggg.\n\nNote 2\n\nSweden, the nation-state where I live and work in3 is at odds (since at least 2015, and more so since the last elections in 2020). The escalation of inequities between the rich and the poor, between those who live in cities, in its suburbs and rural areas, between whites and coloreds,4 between able-bodied and those marked by functionality issues, between men and women … can no longer be brushed aside. Inequities, despite all rhetoric, constitute the norm. The escalation of physical violence in the shape of shootings and explosions in public spaces and living areas that increasing marks and kills ordinary people who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time is seen as unprecedented in the history of this nation-state … this list of oddities is also looonnggg.\n\n9/10 2023\n\nNote 3\n\nA “new” war erupts in Israeli-Gaza territories on 7/10 2023. This October 2023 war is the 16th major conflict in this territory since 1948. While the Israeli-Gaza territories factually lie geographically outside the continent of Europe,5 the war itself has its basis on the entangled events related to the 1939–1945 war in European territories that we have learnt to label as “World War ii” and the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Using a “mobile gaze”6 allows us to trouble the naturalization of some of the oddities here. The very creation of the new state was based on the European holocaust where estimates put 6 million European Jews as being terminated and many displaced to other parts of Europe and beyond by European Nazis. About 5 million “other” groups are also estimated as being terminated by the European Nazis. These include people with disabilities (a group that was targeted before the Jews), Roma, Sinti, Polish people, Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexual people, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.\n\nHistorical evidence suggests that Hitler and the Nazis were inspired by the concentration camp facilities created by white European colonizers in other parts of the planet, including in the United States. The horrific wrong-doings by the Nazis in the 1930s and first half of 1940s saw decisions being made regarding the setting up of the State of Israel by powers in Europe and North America, including the geopolitically Northern/Western framed UN.7 An-other oddity lies in why no similar decisions were made regarding the “other” targeted and terminated populations. Of further significance is that the creation of Israel occurred in tandem with, and through the termination of the British, i.e., another European colonial, occupation of the land of Palestine; the decision to divide the British occupied colonized Palestinian territory into separate Jewish and Arabic states, with Jerusalem as an internationally administered city led – not surprisingly – to a direct war in 1948; 15 other wars have followed, many of which have involved neighboring nation-states; a direct consequence of these conflicts has been a major exodus of Palestinian people and the demolition of Palestinian territory across time (see Figure 1). Thus, each war led to an expansion of Israeli territories and further occupation of Palestinian land.\n\nA Mobile Gaze on the Notes\n\nBoth descriptions in Notes 1 and 2 are skewed in different ways. First, the world is bigger than European territories and its near-lying geographies. While it is but one geography on the planet, Europe is intimately interconnected with other continents across time. Thus, we may surmise that instead of the world, it is the continent of Europe that is at odds, when we look at the going-on’s listed in Notes 1 and 2, and in particular what we call western and northern Europe in contemporary times; furthermore, this continent has and continues to be tightly entangled with the going-on’s in other continents across time. Second, these understandings draw on the myths and imaginaries of superiority self-subscribed to and conferred on this continent across time and the linear universal trajectories that mark what is hegemonically infused into the concept (societal) development. Third, ahistorical gazing at past and contemporary miss-deeds at best, and atrocities against humanity at worst are the outcomes of such naturalized thinking. Thus, the very essence of equating war, other heinous acts of violence, continuing inequities as being a mark of something that is odd or has gone amiss needs interrogation from a mobile gaze across time and space.\n\nA key salient point for present purposes that Note 3 offers is that ahistorical gazing on oddities and atrocities committed in contemporary times need illumination also from a number of alternative epistemological stances. Drawing attention to – re-membering8 – the erased dimensions of the violence perpetuated by European powers and peoples from the territories of Europe across the planet across time constitutes a salient issue that can be gleamed from Sandew Hira’s 2023 volume:\n\nThe colonizers were white Europeans. The colonized were people of color. The early colonizers were financed by the emerging mercantile capitalist class and the later colonizers by the industrial capitalist class. Colonization changed in the course of time with changing instruments of subjugation. Taking over other peoples land, committing brutal genocides, enslaving millions of people and forcing millions of other people into different forms of forced labor were initially the main instruments of subjugation, oppression and exploitation.\n\np. 85–6\n\nMy use of different oddities presented as three notes written in early October 2023 as a starting point in this reflective paper aims to draw attention to the need for center-staging decolonial and southern thinking for hopeful epistemological and existentially sustainable futures. I have in my recent writings discussed the central need for recognizing Epistemological and Existentiality as key dimensions of Sustainability, under which other sustainability dimensions (like ecological, economic, social, cultural sustainability) can be subsumed.9 This idea regarding the primacy of epistemic and existential sustainable for hopeful futures resonates with Sandew Hira’s project where he offers rich reflections on Decolonizing The Mind, dtm.\n\nDecolonial, Decolonization, Decolonizing\n\nDrawing upon recent shifts, that are either understood as having started with or received fodder from the 2015 Rhodes must fall, rmf movement in South African Higher Educational Institutions (hei s) that spread to the heart of the colonial European Empire, more specifically the UK, and thereafter beyond, Sandew Hira writes that academics has been “shaken” by\n\nthe subject of coloniality:10 how knowledge production has been colonized … There are thousands of groups around the world like rmf. They use the decolonial banner in their struggle against racism, imperialism and other forms of injustice. They are located in all parts of the world, from the global North to the global South.\n\np. 24\n\nGiven that the relatively young decolonial “struggle” has reached hei s, Sandew Hira argues that the theory of knowledge i.e., epistemology, has become central in decolonial narratives and the pressing contemporary need lies in transcending epistemology in order to “develop a comprehensive, coherent and integral theoretical framework” that is relevant for building “a new world civilization11” (p. 69, italics added). Using the stans of “reverse logic”, Sandew Hira outlines hopeful futures by pushing for an understanding of the contemporary human condition and the worlds colonial past by casting colonialism, not capitalism, at the core of the analysis, and through the use of “an institutional and civilizational approach” (p. 73). Suggesting that there are multiversal ways of attending to such an enterprise, his central contribution in this volume is through the idea/concept of “mental slavery” regarding inaccuracies at best, and falsehood at worse, that have become naturalized as the given. It is this that gives rise to the need for Decolonizing The Mind, dtm – the title of the 2023 volume that forms the basis for my reflective paper. dtm is inspired from the celebrated author-scholar Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s 1981 volume “Decolonizing the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature”.12\n\nThrough rich illustrations from across the planet and across time, Sandew Hira offers two layers in the analysis of mental slavery and colonizing the mind routines: (i) knowledge production, and (ii) “mechanisms of indoctrinating colonial concepts into the minds of the people” (p. 84). He offers three methods for studying these mechanisms and illustrates these pedagogically: (i) case studies, (ii) the study of handbooks for colonization of the mind,13 and (iii) studying institutions of knowledge transfer. These together offer the reader the three-pronged main task that the author has set up for himself and that is flagged across the volume:\n\n(i)present a critique of the Eurocentric theoretical framework,\n\n(ii)present alternative theoretical frameworks for understanding the world,14 and\n\n(iii)translate knowledge through actions, institutional policies and social movements.\n\nIt is the third step that potentially and more clearly sets this volume apart from many other offerings regarding postcolonial, decolonial and southern thinking.15 Postcolonial theories differ from decolonial theories in that the latter transcend mechanisms of colonization after formal political independence and instead focus on illuminating “the rise of a world system that uses all kinds of mechanisms to ensure the control of the colonizer over the colonized” (p. 69). This resonates with the distinction that has been made between colonialism and coloniality.\n\nContrasting the two existing theories of liberation, Liberalism and Marxism, both of which have emerged from European territories, are credited as having European genealogies, are infused by a linear universal ethos and have existed for a couple of centuries,16 Sandew Hira points out that “Decolonial theory as an explicit theory of liberation is only a few decades old”, has emerged globally, has a multiversal ethos and needs further refinement (p. 1). Arguing that knowledge making constitutes a central dimension of decolonial thinking, epistemology\n\nis not an academic exercise. Policies of governments and institutions are based on knowledge. So, there is a direct link between epistemology and politics … Under the pressure of social movements outside and inside the universities the topic of decolonizing the curriculum is now firmly on the agenda of many university boards and ministries of education in some countries.17\n\np. 69\n\nA situated reflection is that the noun decolonization can at best be considered a newcomer in the territories that make up the contemporary nation-state of Sweden. This means that a decolonizing of the curriculum is a task that lies in the future trajectory of the nation-state I live and work in. Academics in the nation-state of Sweden, positioned as being part of the global North, have as yet to be “shaken”, let alone touched by decolonization. Thus, it is not surprising that decolonizing the curriculum i.e., the verb related to making changes to the curriculum, has not impacted the nation-state in ways that have swept, for instance the UK, another nation-state I lived and studied in at an earlier point in my academic career. As a contrast to hei s in Sweden, its neighbor Denmark is currently witnessing a decolonizing of its hei.18 The point being that there is need to acknowledge that the pace with which decolonial thinking has and is shaping shifts within hei (acknowledged as becoming more visible since the 2015 rmf movement) remains highly differentiated across nation-states in what is territorially seen as the north-south or west-east. The question I and others have asked in relation to this dichotomy can be framed as follows: north and south or west and east of what on a planet spinning around a star in the solar system in the known universe, in particular in our analogue-digital existence?19 Here it is equally important to acknowledge that the vocabularies in circulation regarding the territories of the north-south (or whatever other vocabularies we find relevant to point to these) are metaphors that point to the privileged-marginalized, haves-deprived, etc. within all territories. Thus, there exists a south in the north, a north in the south and these need address in terms of dtm.\n\nWhat is Happening in What Appears to be Happening?20 Unlearning for Relearning to Turn Over a New Leaf\n\nSandew Hira illustrates his thesis of Decolonizing The Mind, dtm through a list of 34 mechanisms through which the mind is colonized and that he argues “are enforced by a whole system of economic, political, social and cultural domination” (p. 106). To give a flavor of their nature, the themes of the first 15 mechanisms are listed here (in the order taken up in Chapter 4.521):\n\nProducing and spreading lies,\n\nDivide and rule,\n\nThe use of hypocrisy and double standards,\n\nThe organization of amnesia (loss22 of memory),\n\nUse intimidation to silence voices of critique,\n\nThe promotion of the idea that politics is a struggle between good and evil,\n\nUse of instrument of demonization to prevent conflict resolution,\n\nHumanizing the criminal and dehumanizing the victim,\n\nShift the focus from the message to the messenger,\n\nShut down the outlets that provides answers to Western propaganda,\n\nPresent a white minority as an international majority,\n\nUsing good grade scales for bad phenomena,\n\nBlaming the victim for the crime,\n\nPresenting ethics as facts, and\n\nUse the house negro23 to assure the colonizer that they are loved by the colonized.\n\nThe oddities pertaining to the latest war that erupted in Israeli-Gaza territories on 7/10 2023 (see Note 3 above) finds resonance in these mechanisms. I was compelled to return to these 34 mechanisms after 7/10 2023 and ask myself the following types of queries:\n\n–what is happening in what appears to be happening?\n\n–what media consumption habits enable certain ways of understanding wars and other atrocities?\n\n–who is producing and spreading what lies?\n\n–why are media discussions almost completely devoid of historical facts?\n\n–which parties are demonizing what and to what effect?\n\n–what is the nature of the blame-game in this conflict – at the present moment, across time …\n\nMy list of questions became loooonnnnggg as I re-read the 34 mechanisms outlined in the volume after 7/10 2023. Are these types of troublings symptomatic of metal slavery and is the task of dtm to liberate one from colonialism of the mind?\n\nSandew Hira describes each mechanism and offers responses to many of them through a dtm stance (presented across pages 106–120), thus unpacking his contribution to decolonial theory as concrete practices. This then constitutes an important way in which the sub-title of the volume is operationalized: A guide to decolonial theory and practice.\n\nChapters 7 to 12 in the volume engage with how six different areas of scientific knowledge systems can be salvaged from the linear universalizing ethos of Eurocentric framings and delivered to the entanglements of multiversal epistemologies. The scientific domains covered in these chapters thus constitute contributions towards decolonizing theory through concrete practices. The domains covered include,\n\ndecolonizing mathematics and the natural sciences (chapter 7),\n\ndecolonizing world history (chapter 8),\n\ndecolonizing economic theory (chapter 9),\n\ndecolonizing social theory (chapter 10), and\n\ndecolonizing cultural theory (chapter 11).\n\nGiven my own migrancy within and across different academic domains, I miss a similar focus on the educational sciences and the language sciences. These are areas for future dtm engagements.24\n\nAn important point that Sandew Hira cautions against is a complacency in seeing lists of mechanisms of colonizing the mind as the end of what dtm sets out to accomplish. Instead, he calls for using the mechanisms for gaining insights into how they are related to one another and “how they interact with each other to form a complex system of colonizing the mind”, and in equal measure he calls for “developing the counter mechanisms to decolonize the mind” (p. 120). Sandew Hira invites the reader to dialogue with him on his offerings (p. 572). It is questioning the givens that people, including scholars, across the planet have been socialized into accepting as the natural that, he suggests, is in need of dtm. Adding to Sandew Hira’s invitation, I’d like to push for this as not being an issue of north-south or west-east, not least given the northern/western monopoly in how hei is organized and colonized.25 Rather, the type of thinking offered through dtm is – following Sandew Hira – what everyone everywhere needs to engage with in terms of what I and others have called for: “On the need to un-learn for re-learning”26 and the need for “Turning over a new leaf”.27\n\nSandew Hira’s volume offers the reader major funds of knowledge for unpacking the taken-for-granted myths of the hegemonic European suppositions related to Enlightenment. A key issue that sets this volume apart from other literature is its push for transcending the now relatively well-known critique of the European genealogy regarding a linear universal knowledge production process by consolidating the “scattered landscape of concepts that are not necessarily related to each other and might even contradict other decolonial concepts” and addressing the “practical implications of decolonial theory … for social movements and progressive governments” (p. 15).\n\nOther Ideations and Some Caveats\n\nAs noted earlier, Sandew Hira richly illustrates his ideas with examples that he draws from across the planet. This needs to be seen as a strength of the volume. Another strength is that despite his unflinching critique of the ways in which 500 years of colonialism that springs from how the powers and peoples of European territories have shaped the world, Sandew Hira transcends an essentialist gaze on thinkers’ geographical fixities and pushes for considering the ideational basis of their alignments. Thus, European thinker George Hegel’s unilinear Eurocentric ideas regarding the history of the world as the basis of “the development of the Idea of Freedom” from the 18th and 19th centuries finds echo in the Japanese-US-Eurocentric 20th century scholar of colour, Francis Fukuyama’s parallel thinking. The genealogy of such thinking builds importantly on the classical Eurocentric concept of Enlightenment wherein history is understood as moving “in a linear way, from barbarism to modernity” (p. 40), rather than in the territorial “locus of enunciation” of the bodies of scholars.28 This type of thinking is furthermore, I have argued elsewhere, necessitated in contemporary analog-digital times where scholars mobility is complex.29 Another illustration can be seen through the contributions to decolonial thinking by scholars who acknowledge multiple allegiances across southern Abya Yala spaces, i.e., what we have learnt to call South American territories and their situatedness in northern Abya Yala, i.e., North American territories. Or the multiple allegiances that Sandew Hira himself or scholars from the continents of Africa, Asia and other previously colonized territories make salient when contributing to decolonial and southern thinking from their situatedness in and across sites of past and present hegemonies – primarily European and northern Abya Yala territories. The salient issue here is that if and when scholars’ loci of enunciation become reduced to a singular (previous or present) geography of birth or citizenship (or their parent’s genealogy), this seriously risks becoming counter-productive to the tasks of decolonial thinking i.e., dtm.\n\nThe focus on scholar’s locus of enunciation can also be augmented by, what I will here call the “locus of knowledge production”. Transcending the north-south or west-east territorial localities regarding where knowledge is produced, this latter concept alludes to the singular and totalitarian role that hei s are seen as playing in the epistemological enterprise. Sandew Hira argues that knowledge production needs to be understood as a far broader enterprise than how it is framed in hegemonic terms and differentiates furthermore between western and westernized universities to make a further key point: “Knowledge is produced inside and outside universities, but in Westernized societies the universities are the centers of knowledge production” (p. 123, my emphasis). Westernized universities can be found in all territories on the planet. Understandings of what counts as valid knowledge produced at universities is used by stakeholders that are diverse: scientists themselves, lay people, policy makers, social groups, etc. Such knowledge usage builds on the trajectories of dissemination of knowledge through academic publishing channels (conferences, journals, books etc. wherein the oral and written word and some named-languages are privileged), through media and culture, etc. When there are discrepancies regarding what is seen as constituting valid knowledge in relation to colonialism – the critical issue that arises is whose version can be taken as the correct one, if there is a correct version or whether there is scope to accept multiple “truths”? Sandew Hira illustrates this critical point through the case of the European Christopher Columbus: was he a hero that the world should continue to honor with newer statues to augment the 600 that have already been erected for the progress he has contributed to the world or was he a criminal …\n\nwho opened the door to genocide and enslavement of the indigenous people of Abya Yala (the Americas) and the European enslavement of Africans. The 600 monuments should be brought down and destroyed and his crimes should be exposed in the textbooks on the history of the world.\n\np. 124\n\nSuch issues are used to illustrate conundrums for approaching the question of what constitutes valid knowledge, and what de facto gets codified in the term scientific knowledge which then becomes “the basis for educational policies” (p. 124). A fundamental faultline here builds on the taken-for-granted superiority claimed by and conferred on European science where there is a confusion between correct and free thinking. Here true science is understood as being built on objectivity i.e., something is either true or false, while dimensions of right and wrong are relegated to ethics i.e., subjective dimensions. Such a distinction relates fundamentally to the historical genealogy of European epistemology that evolved in opposition to Christian theology.\n\nThe key issue is that the evolution of scientific knowledge was not shaped by such an opposition in alternative epistemologies across the planet: both the objective (truth-falsehood) and the subjective (ethics i.e., right and wrong) dimensions of knowing were and are seen as being inseparable parts of scientific knowledge in these epistemologies. While European knowledge building takes place through observation (leading to understandings regarding data collection) and reasoning (in terms of induction, deduction and validation), Sandew Hira presents the central idea of “conceptual thinking” as the basis of alternative epistemologies (illustrated through dtm). Here it is a concept that is central; for instance, in the instance of “the discovery of the continent of America by Christopher Columbus” – which is approached through observations or “a collection of facts about the object of knowledge production” that can respond adequately to the question “what happened?” (p. 131). It is the analysis of the observations that “offers a framing and a storyline with a certain logic that makes us understand why the natural and social reality is how it is and how it has developed” (p. 131). Here the very positionality or the locus of enunciation of the storyline – from which position can we understand the discovery narrative as opposed to the discovery of territories that were already inhabited and the storyline of a crime against humanity that played out thereafter – is critically important. Theory – in this “conceptual thinking” ethos – is made up of a “collection of interrelated concepts that provides a bigger picture of the natural and social reality” and it is here that the “ethical component has practical consequences”; these relate to emotions that in turn are consequential for our response to the original question of “what happened?” (p. 132). Sandew Hira maintains that there are four crucial differences between Eurocentric and dtm and alternative epistemologies: the former\n\n(i)does not distinguish between knowledge and lies,\n\n(ii)uses the same research methods for generating knowledge about human society and the natural world (thus reducing the importance of human relationships in knowledge work),\n\n(iii)is based on a two-value logic (rather than a multi-logic ethos) of true or false that is applicable only to static situations, and\n\n(iv)is confined to understanding what has happened or what is going on and thus has no methodology for envisaging knowledge about the future.\n\nThe second point in this list is particularly pertinent to issues of positionality since epistemologies of natural and social worlds differ in terms of the object of knowledge (i.e., what is being researched) and the subject of knowledge (i.e., who is doing the researching) – this can be separated in the former, not in the latter.\n\nSandew Hira’s emphasis on bringing in history as a key dimension to unpack contemporary atrocities – physical and epistemological – is, as highlighted earlier, a crucial dimension of dtm. Multiple histories – and particularly those that have been erased from the singularly framed collective memories – are in crucial need of “re-memory”30 for making our futures hopeful; this constitutes another important message of Sandew Hira’s volume. Bringing into focus the present-day state of the world through acknowledgements of how shifts in “instruments of subjugation” deployed in the processes of colonization and how these have marked and shaped our present are crucial, Sandew Hira argues through a multitude of examples. Public memory is created and enshrined not only in institutions like libraries, museums, monuments, digital resources, cultural industries and media, but significantly also in and through educational institutions across K-12 and hei s. How the major genocides committed across the 500 years of colonialism are erased from memory is a vile illustration of how such processes evolve and are maintained. Thus, for instance, and without belittling the atrocities involved, we need to trouble why the main – perhaps the only – history of genocide that gets highlighted in our re-memory is a European one?31 Such a query is critically relevant to the epistemological task from a dtm stance. It calls for troubling of the continuing place accorded to selective genocides that are remembered while others are erased from our collective memory. The much larger numbers of casualties and the brutalities that colonialism inflicted in the name of Enlightenment and superiority across the planet across 500 years remain unaccounted for in the singular grand narratives of our times.\n\nTaking over other peoples land, committing brutal genocides, enslaving millions of people and forcing millions of other people into different forms of forced labor were initially the main instruments of subjugation, oppression and exploitation.\n\np. 86\n\nThe Abya Yala Holocaust was followed by another unimaginable crime against humanity: trans-Atlantic enslavement. The foundations of the current world economy (including production, transportation, finance, consumption) was based on this crime. The systematic kidnapping of Africans over several centuries and enslaving them to work under brutal circumstance in Abya Yala took a huge toll on human lives. It led to a disaster in Africa … which lost a massive part of her young and industrious population … At least 12 million people were loaded in the floating prison ships for enslavement in Abya Yala. At least two million people lost their lives during the trans-Atlantic crossing and humdreds of millions were enslaved in the 300–400 years of enslavement … Hundred of millions of lives were destroyed by this system.\n\np. 279\n\nThe epistemological task here lies in asking how it is possible that the storyline we i.e., European and northern Abya Yala settler communities have built up – continue to privilege the atrocities of one Holocaust where an estimated 11 million humans were terminated, and completely, or mostly, erase the centuries of colonial atrocities wherein “[h]undreds of millions of lives were destroyed”? The Swedish case is further illustrative here. Despite its complicity in the slave trade, colonial wrong-doings in the Caribbean in the past and continuing crimes against its indigenous populations, children in its schools even in the 21st century are shielded from learning about such distressing facts.32 Such erasures continue to enable the aura of superiority that frames the Swedish nation-states image out in the world.33\n\nThe issue of selective acknowledgement of crimes against humanity and erasures is one of two points that can be noted with regards to the epistemological task of hei. The second relates to the shifts in instruments of subjugation across timespaces. This too needs careful study if hopeful presents and futures can be imagined. Thus, interrogating continuing colonial naturalizations in how vocabularies re-enforce hegemonic regimes and how, not paying attention to the multiple and intersecting positionalities of who is doing the (de)colonial work of liberation, why, in what ways, etc. needs emphasis.34 While acknowledging that “[c]hanging terminology can be an arduous enterprise” (p. 20), Sandew Hira’s important troubling of naturalized vocabularies constitutes a key dimension of dtm.\n\nDecolonizing academic language is part of decolonizing the university [… and] Decolonizing the universities also means taking a fresh look at how knowledge produced from a pluriversal perspective can find its way to large sections of the population outside the regular institutions of education and the media.\n\np. 400\n\nIn addition to the European renaming of Abya Yala to America,35 the 2021 launching of a petition by the Māori Party to reclaim the name Aotearoa from the te reo Māori language for what we have learnt to call New Zealand, and ongoing petitions by Sami to reclaim Sami names from the imposed Swedish names constitute illustrations that re-center multiversal framings.\n\nThe stance that Sandew Hira takes is to pedagogically use the terminologies of indigenous peoples as an effort to support these efforts. Here a caveat is that the term “Indian” is retained in the volume for the peoples of Abya Yala, even though Sandew Hira presents far-reaching consequential critique on how the European Christopher Columbus’ navigational mistakes and subsequent atrocities in Abya Yala can be seen as the start of the colonial era. Following his own logic of dtm, it is unclear why Sandew Hira uses “World” instead of “European” for what we have learnt to call the two wars in the 20th century; both wars emerged in and were fought primarily through the agencies of European powers (including its allies across the Atlantic) primarily on European territories, even though they drew on the human power of the colonized peoples they ruled over in other parts of the planet.\n\nGenre, Style and Cover\n\nSandew Hira’s writing style aligns interestingly with mainstream academic textual practices with important disruptions of conventions. He uses non-indented paragraphs without space, calls the chapter sections paragraphs when cross-referencing to draw the readers’ attention to other dimensions of his arguments, points the reader to a tapestry of illustrations both internally in the book and outside of it. The genre and style the reader meets in this volume gives rise to issues regarding who we scholars write for, why we write in the manner we write, who has decreed that the mainstream writing genre is how it should be, what referencing habits we take for granted and why we adhere to them in a slavish manner …36 These are not innocuous queries, and while I have raised them in earlier southern framed reflective texts, I am not alone in doing so. Aligning with the idea to multiversify academic writing, like Sandew Hira, I disturb some academic conventions in this reflective paper, including the mainstream genre of writing a review. In lieu of a standard summary of Sandew Hira’s 2023 volume, my attempt has been to think with the authors’ offerings and take the dtm framework to task by using it to make sense of the oddities (or rather the non-sense) playing out in contemporary human existence (see the three Notes that illustrate some oddities). The 572-page volume’s rich and troubling offerings are outlined unconventionally here, dialogically.\n\nThe narrative style of Sandew Hira’s volume is pedagogical even though there are repetitions and, despite what orientations and alignments a reader might have when they come to this 572-page volume, Sandew Hira gets the reader to think with him and his ideas. The narrative style can come out as being jarring at times. For instance, when historical and/or contemporary figures and powers are labelled with less-than flattering adjectives: “Columbus the Criminal” (p. 96), “butcher Ariel Sharon’s visit to the Al-Agnar mosque in Jerusalem” (p. 507), “bullying of the West” (p. 520) etc. Here, taking a step back and thinking with the author, i.e., taking a dtm stans, the reader is invited to ask whether it is the mainstream narratives the majority on the planet have so successfully been socialized to believe as the truth, or whether it is the mental slavery that the majority need to be shaken from that gives rise to jarring feelings when the reader is confronted by such unconventional academic languaging? This is an important question and is perhaps constitutive of the dtm agenda of “providing another narrative” (p. 12). Furthermore, given that these ideas are far from simple, repeated close readings of different parts of the volume can be necessary for a Euro-situated and Euro-thinking scholar who may not (as yet) have met decolonial waves that have, since 2015, come ashore hei, if they are to gain traction from the volume’s argumentation.\n\nA distraction in the volume are the unnecessary typos that the reader meets across its pages. While most are merely annoying (spellings and grammar related typos, jumbled numbers [establishment of Oxford University presented as 1906, rather than 1096, p. 396]), a couple are more glaring: sub-section numbering in Chapter 13.4.3 is incorrectly displayed in the table of contents (p. 11) and incorrectly marked inside the chapter (p. 498; there is also an incorrect cross-referencing on p. 503). A re-print of the volume should iron out these inconsistencies.\n\nThe volume cover is pedagogical and hope-inducing despite the horrific story it builds upon. It illustrates the history of resistance against colonialism in both deeds and words. The cover represents what the last Aztec ruler of Tenochtitlan, Cuauhtémoc, narrates in 1521, a year after becoming an 18-year-old ruler and having lost the battle to drive the Spaniards out:\n\nOur sun is now hidden from view. The face of our sun has disappeared, and has left us in complete darkness. But we know it will return again, that it will rise again, and it will begin to illuminate us anew.\n\np. 67\n\nCuauhtémoc was tortured and held in captivity for over three years before being executed. Arguing that another better world is indeed possible, Sandew Hira offers five ethical principles for the basis of a new world civilization (pp. 516–520); the principles’\n\nof justice and solidarity,\n\nof human dignity,\n\nof harmony,\n\nof pluriversalism, and\n\nof non-interference.\n\nThese principles, he convincingly argues, build on imagining “a world in which simple dreams of peace, love and prosperity can come true … probably in less than fifty years” (p. 522).\n\nObituary to Epistemic Violence and Continuing Coloniality\n\nThe primacy of decolonial and southern thinking is crucial for epistemic and existential sustainability for enabling hopeful futures for both the planet and its human, non-human and material constituents. In my reading of Sandew Hira’s call for Decolonizing The Mind, dtm, to enable imagining a new world, I note an alignment with the speech of the Swedish poet, author, director, actor and comedian, Tage Danielsson (see Figure 2); this speech is titled “advice to a newborn child” and was delivered on the occasion of the UN day, 24 October 1982. Sandrew Hira and Tage Danielsson’s calls build on socializing minds through the centrality of remembering with the intent to upfront a new existence where peace is privileged. Nothing can be achieved if epistemic violence is allowed to be buried in the continuing grand narratives of falsehood, Sandew Hira pushes us to recognize.\n\nSuch invitations by thinkers across the territories of the north and south need to be heeded with the utmost sincerity and seriousness both within and outside hei. Putting peace first requires concerted efforts by all – those historically marginalized and wronged, and those privileged and party to the injustices perpetuated on others. Returning to the three Notes and mobile gaze framed reflections in the introduction of this paper, remembering and acknowledging wrong-doings are a precursor to unlearning for relearning so that foundations of peace can be created. These foundations are our primary hope for ending epistemic violence and continuing coloniality in all territories on the planet.\n\nOddities? Three Notes from Early October 2023 and Opening Thoughts1\n\n4/10 2023\n\nNote 1\n\nThe world is at odds (or so it seems).2 The Russian-Ukrainian war became a new layer to other “unraveling’s” with the increasing strides right-wing and neo-Nazi movements have made inside and outside European nation-states in recent years, the individual men (often men, but not always men), who strike at the heart of civilized existence through acts of violence against ordinary people in European and USA spaces, the continuing waves of desperate human beings traversing the Mediterranean waters in dingy vessels, perishing in attempts to reach what is perceived as a better existence and being pushed back into the waters by the more developed and civilized powers … this list of oddities is loooonnggg.\n\nNote 2\n\nSweden, the nation-state where I live and work in3 is at odds (since at least 2015, and more so since the last elections in 2020). The escalation of inequities between the rich and the poor, between those who live in cities, in its suburbs and rural areas, between whites and coloreds,4 between able-bodied and those marked by functionality issues, between men and women … can no longer be brushed aside. Inequities, despite all rhetoric, constitute the norm. The escalation of physical violence in the shape of shootings and explosions in public spaces and living areas that increasing marks and kills ordinary people who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time is seen as unprecedented in the history of this nation-state … this list of oddities is also looonnggg.\n\n9/10 2023\n\nNote 3\n\nA “new” war erupts in Israeli-Gaza territories on 7/10 2023. This October 2023 war is the 16th major conflict in this territory since 1948. While the Israeli-Gaza territories factually lie geographically outside the continent of Europe,5 the war itself has its basis on the entangled events related to the 1939–1945 war in European territories that we have learnt to label as “World War ii” and the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Using a “mobile gaze”6 allows us to trouble the naturalization of some of the oddities here. The very creation of the new state was based on the European holocaust where estimates put 6 million European Jews as being terminated and many displaced to other parts of Europe and beyond by European Nazis. About 5 million “other” groups are also estimated as being terminated by the European Nazis. These include people with disabilities (a group that was targeted before the Jews), Roma, Sinti, Polish people, Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexual people, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.\n\nHistorical evidence suggests that Hitler and the Nazis were inspired by the concentration camp facilities created by white European colonizers in other parts of the planet, including in the United States. The horrific wrong-doings by the Nazis in the 1930s and first half of 1940s saw decisions being made regarding the setting up of the State of Israel by powers in Europe and North America, including the geopolitically Northern/Western framed UN.7 An-other oddity lies in why no similar decisions were made regarding the “other” targeted and terminated populations. Of further significance is that the creation of Israel occurred in tandem with, and through the termination of the British, i.e., another European colonial, occupation of the land of Palestine; the decision to divide the British occupied colonized Palestinian territory into separate Jewish and Arabic states, with Jerusalem as an internationally administered city led – not surprisingly – to a direct war in 1948; 15 other wars have followed, many of which have involved neighboring nation-states; a direct consequence of these conflicts has been a major exodus of Palestinian people and the demolition of Palestinian territory across time (see Figure 1). Thus, each war led to an expansion of Israeli territories and further occupation of Palestinian land.\n\nA Mobile Gaze on the Notes\n\nBoth descriptions in Notes 1 and 2 are skewed in different ways. First, the world is bigger than European territories and its near-lying geographies. While it is but one geography on the planet, Europe is intimately interconnected with other continents across time. Thus, we may surmise that instead of the world, it is the continent of Europe that is at odds, when we look at the going-on’s listed in Notes 1 and 2, and in particular what we call western and northern Europe in contemporary times; furthermore, this continent has and continues to be tightly entangled with the going-on’s in other continents across time. Second, these understandings draw on the myths and imaginaries of superiority self-subscribed to and conferred on this continent across time and the linear universal trajectories that mark what is hegemonically infused into the concept (societal) development. Third, ahistorical gazing at past and contemporary miss-deeds at best, and atrocities against humanity at worst are the outcomes of such naturalized thinking. Thus, the very essence of equating war, other heinous acts of violence, continuing inequities as being a mark of something that is odd or has gone amiss needs interrogation from a mobile gaze across time and space.\n\nA key salient point for present purposes that Note 3 offers is that ahistorical gazing on oddities and atrocities committed in contemporary times need illumination also from a number of alternative epistemological stances. Drawing attention to – re-membering8 – the erased dimensions of the violence perpetuated by European powers and peoples from the territories of Europe across the planet across time constitutes a salient issue that can be gleamed from Sandew Hira’s 2023 volume:\n\nThe colonizers were white Europeans. The colonized were people of color. The early colonizers were financed by the emerging mercantile capitalist class and the later colonizers by the industrial capitalist class. Colonization changed in the course of time with changing instruments of subjugation. Taking over other peoples land, committing brutal genocides, enslaving millions of people and forcing millions of other people into different forms of forced labor were initially the main instruments of subjugation, oppression and exploitation.\n\np. 85–6\n\nMy use of different oddities presented as three notes written in early October 2023 as a starting point in this reflective paper aims to draw attention to the need for center-staging decolonial and southern thinking for hopeful epistemological and existentially sustainable futures. I have in my recent writings discussed the central need for recognizing Epistemological and Existentiality as key dimensions of Sustainability, under which other sustainability dimensions (like ecological, economic, social, cultural sustainability) can be subsumed.9 This idea regarding the primacy of epistemic and existential sustainable for hopeful futures resonates with Sandew Hira’s project where he offers rich reflections on Decolonizing The Mind, dtm.\n\nDecolonial, Decolonization, Decolonizing\n\nDrawing upon recent shifts, that are either understood as having started with or received fodder from the 2015 Rhodes must fall, rmf movement in South African Higher Educational Institutions (hei s) that spread to the heart of the colonial European Empire, more specifically the UK, and thereafter beyond, Sandew Hira writes that academics has been “shaken” by\n\nthe subject of coloniality:10 how knowledge production has been colonized … There are thousands of groups around the world like rmf. They use the decolonial banner in their struggle against racism, imperialism and other forms of injustice. They are located in all parts of the world, from the global North to the global South.\n\np. 24\n\nGiven that the relatively young decolonial “struggle” has reached hei s, Sandew Hira argues that the theory of knowledge i.e., epistemology, has become central in decolonial narratives and the pressing contemporary need lies in transcending epistemology in order to “develop a comprehensive, coherent and integral theoretical framework” that is relevant for building “a new world civilization11” (p. 69, italics added). Using the stans of “reverse logic”, Sandew Hira outlines hopeful futures by pushing for an understanding of the contemporary human condition and the worlds colonial past by casting colonialism, not capitalism, at the core of the analysis, and through the use of “an institutional and civilizational approach” (p. 73). Suggesting that there are multiversal ways of attending to such an enterprise, his central contribution in this volume is through the idea/concept of “mental slavery” regarding inaccuracies at best, and falsehood at worse, that have become naturalized as the given. It is this that gives rise to the need for Decolonizing The Mind, dtm – the title of the 2023 volume that forms the basis for my reflective paper. dtm is inspired from the celebrated author-scholar Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s 1981 volume “Decolonizing the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature”.12\n\nThrough rich illustrations from across the planet and across time, Sandew Hira offers two layers in the analysis of mental slavery and colonizing the mind routines: (i) knowledge production, and (ii) “mechanisms of indoctrinating colonial concepts into the minds of the people” (p. 84). He offers three methods for studying these mechanisms and illustrates these pedagogically: (i) case studies, (ii) the study of handbooks for colonization of the mind,13 and (iii) studying institutions of knowledge transfer. These together offer the reader the three-pronged main task that the author has set up for himself and that is flagged across the volume:\n\n(i)present a critique of the Eurocentric theoretical framework,\n\n(ii)present alternative theoretical frameworks for understanding the world,14 and\n\n(iii)translate knowledge through actions, institutional policies and social movements.\n\nIt is the third step that potentially and more clearly sets this volume apart from many other offerings regarding postcolonial, decolonial and southern thinking.15 Postcolonial theories differ from decolonial theories in that the latter transcend mechanisms of colonization after formal political independence and instead focus on illuminating “the rise of a world system that uses all kinds of mechanisms to ensure the control of the colonizer over the colonized” (p. 69). This resonates with the distinction that has been made between colonialism and coloniality.\n\nContrasting the two existing theories of liberation, Liberalism and Marxism, both of which have emerged from European territories, are credited as having European genealogies, are infused by a linear universal ethos and have existed for a couple of centuries,16 Sandew Hira points out that “Decolonial theory as an explicit theory of liberation is only a few decades old”, has emerged globally, has a multiversal ethos and needs further refinement (p. 1). Arguing that knowledge making constitutes a central dimension of decolonial thinking, epistemology\n\nis not an academic exercise. Policies of governments and institutions are based on knowledge. So, there is a direct link between epistemology and politics … Under the pressure of social movements outside and inside the universities the topic of decolonizing the curriculum is now firmly on the agenda of many university boards and ministries of education in some countries.17\n\np. 69\n\nA situated reflection is that the noun decolonization can at best be considered a newcomer in the territories that make up the contemporary nation-state of Sweden. This means that a decolonizing of the curriculum is a task that lies in the future trajectory of the nation-state I live and work in. Academics in the nation-state of Sweden, positioned as being part of the global North, have as yet to be “shaken”, let alone touched by decolonization. Thus, it is not surprising that decolonizing the curriculum i.e., the verb related to making changes to the curriculum, has not impacted the nation-state in ways that have swept, for instance the UK, another nation-state I lived and studied in at an earlier point in my academic career. As a contrast to hei s in Sweden, its neighbor Denmark is currently witnessing a decolonizing of its hei.18 The point being that there is need to acknowledge that the pace with which decolonial thinking has and is shaping shifts within hei (acknowledged as becoming more visible since the 2015 rmf movement) remains highly differentiated across nation-states in what is territorially seen as the north-south or west-east. The question I and others have asked in relation to this dichotomy can be framed as follows: north and south or west and east of what on a planet spinning around a star in the solar system in the known universe, in particular in our analogue-digital existence?19 Here it is equally important to acknowledge that the vocabularies in circulation regarding the territories of the north-south (or whatever other vocabularies we find relevant to point to these) are metaphors that point to the privileged-marginalized, haves-deprived, etc. within all territories. Thus, there exists a south in the north, a north in the south and these need address in terms of dtm.\n\nWhat is Happening in What Appears to be Happening?20 Unlearning for Relearning to Turn Over a New Leaf\n\nSandew Hira illustrates his thesis of Decolonizing The Mind, dtm through a list of 34 mechanisms through which the mind is colonized and that he argues “are enforced by a whole system of economic, political, social and cultural domination” (p. 106). To give a flavor of their nature, the themes of the first 15 mechanisms are listed here (in the order taken up in Chapter 4.521):\n\nProducing and spreading lies,\n\nDivide and rule,\n\nThe use of hypocrisy and double standards,\n\nThe organization of amnesia (loss22 of memory),\n\nUse intimidation to silence voices of critique,\n\nThe promotion of the idea that politics is a struggle between good and evil,\n\nUse of instrument of demonization to prevent conflict resolution,\n\nHumanizing the criminal and dehumanizing the victim,\n\nShift the focus from the message to the messenger,\n\nShut down the outlets that provides answers to Western propaganda,\n\nPresent a white minority as an international majority,\n\nUsing good grade scales for bad phenomena,\n\nBlaming the victim for the crime,\n\nPresenting ethics as facts, and\n\nUse the house negro23 to assure the colonizer that they are loved by the colonized.\n\nThe oddities pertaining to the latest war that erupted in Israeli-Gaza territories on 7/10 2023 (see Note 3 above) finds resonance in these mechanisms. I was compelled to return to these 34 mechanisms after 7/10 2023 and ask myself the following types of queries:\n\n–what is happening in what appears to be happening?\n\n–what media consumption habits enable certain ways of understanding wars and other atrocities?\n\n–who is producing and spreading what lies?\n\n–why are media discussions almost completely devoid of historical facts?\n\n–which parties are demonizing what and to what effect?\n\n–what is the nature of the blame-game in this conflict – at the present moment, across time …\n\nMy list of questions became loooonnnnggg as I re-read the 34 mechanisms outlined in the volume after 7/10 2023. Are these types of troublings symptomatic of metal slavery and is the task of dtm to liberate one from colonialism of the mind?\n\nSandew Hira describes each mechanism and offers responses to many of them through a dtm stance (presented across pages 106–120), thus unpacking his contribution to decolonial theory as concrete practices. This then constitutes an important way in which the sub-title of the volume is operationalized: A guide to decolonial theory and practice.\n\nChapters 7 to 12 in the volume engage with how six different areas of scientific knowledge systems can be salvaged from the linear universalizing ethos of Eurocentric framings and delivered to the entanglements of multiversal epistemologies. The scientific domains covered in these chapters thus constitute contributions towards decolonizing theory through concrete practices. The domains covered include,\n\ndecolonizing mathematics and the natural sciences (chapter 7),\n\ndecolonizing world history (chapter 8),\n\ndecolonizing economic theory (chapter 9),\n\ndecolonizing social theory (chapter 10), and\n\ndecolonizing cultural theory (chapter 11).\n\nGiven my own migrancy within and across different academic domains, I miss a similar focus on the educational sciences and the language sciences. These are areas for future dtm engagements.24\n\nAn important point that Sandew Hira cautions against is a complacency in seeing lists of mechanisms of colonizing the mind as the end of what dtm sets out to accomplish. Instead, he calls for using the mechanisms for gaining insights into how they are related to one another and “how they interact with each other to form a complex system of colonizing the mind”, and in equal measure he calls for “developing the counter mechanisms to decolonize the mind” (p. 120). Sandew Hira invites the reader to dialogue with him on his offerings (p. 572). It is questioning the givens that people, including scholars, across the planet have been socialized into accepting as the natural that, he suggests, is in need of dtm. Adding to Sandew Hira’s invitation, I’d like to push for this as not being an issue of north-south or west-east, not least given the northern/western monopoly in how hei is organized and colonized.25 Rather, the type of thinking offered through dtm is – following Sandew Hira – what everyone everywhere needs to engage with in terms of what I and others have called for: “On the need to un-learn for re-learning”26 and the need for “Turning over a new leaf”.27\n\nSandew Hira’s volume offers the reader major funds of knowledge for unpacking the taken-for-granted myths of the hegemonic European suppositions related to Enlightenment. A key issue that sets this volume apart from other literature is its push for transcending the now relatively well-known critique of the European genealogy regarding a linear universal knowledge production process by consolidating the “scattered landscape of concepts that are not necessarily related to each other and might even contradict other decolonial concepts” and addressing the “practical implications of decolonial theory … for social movements and progressive governments” (p. 15).\n\nOther Ideations and Some Caveats\n\nAs noted earlier, Sandew Hira richly illustrates his ideas with examples that he draws from across the planet. This needs to be seen as a strength of the volume. Another strength is that despite his unflinching critique of the ways in which 500 years of colonialism that springs from how the powers and peoples of European territories have shaped the world, Sandew Hira transcends an essentialist gaze on thinkers’ geographical fixities and pushes for considering the ideational basis of their alignments. Thus, European thinker George Hegel’s unilinear Eurocentric ideas regarding the history of the world as the basis of “the development of the Idea of Freedom” from the 18th and 19th centuries finds echo in the Japanese-US-Eurocentric 20th century scholar of colour, Francis Fukuyama’s parallel thinking. The genealogy of such thinking builds importantly on the classical Eurocentric concept of Enlightenment wherein history is understood as moving “in a linear way, from barbarism to modernity” (p. 40), rather than in the territorial “locus of enunciation” of the bodies of scholars.28 This type of thinking is furthermore, I have argued elsewhere, necessitated in contemporary analog-digital times where scholars mobility is complex.29 Another illustration can be seen through the contributions to decolonial thinking by scholars who acknowledge multiple allegiances across southern Abya Yala spaces, i.e., what we have learnt to call South American territories and their situatedness in northern Abya Yala, i.e., North American territories. Or the multiple allegiances that Sandew Hira himself or scholars from the continents of Africa, Asia and other previously colonized territories make salient when contributing to decolonial and southern thinking from their situatedness in and across sites of past and present hegemonies – primarily European and northern Abya Yala territories. The salient issue here is that if and when scholars’ loci of enunciation become reduced to a singular (previous or present) geography of birth or citizenship (or their parent’s genealogy), this seriously risks becoming counter-productive to the tasks of decolonial thinking i.e., dtm.\n\nThe focus on scholar’s locus of enunciation can also be augmented by, what I will here call the “locus of knowledge production”. Transcending the north-south or west-east territorial localities regarding where knowledge is produced, this latter concept alludes to the singular and totalitarian role that hei s are seen as playing in the epistemological enterprise. Sandew Hira argues that knowledge production needs to be understood as a far broader enterprise than how it is framed in hegemonic terms and differentiates furthermore between western and westernized universities to make a further key point: “Knowledge is produced inside and outside universities, but in Westernized societies the universities are the centers of knowledge production” (p. 123, my emphasis). Westernized universities can be found in all territories on the planet. Understandings of what counts as valid knowledge produced at universities is used by stakeholders that are diverse: scientists themselves, lay people, policy makers, social groups, etc. Such knowledge usage builds on the trajectories of dissemination of knowledge through academic publishing channels (conferences, journals, books etc. wherein the oral and written word and some named-languages are privileged), through media and culture, etc. When there are discrepancies regarding what is seen as constituting valid knowledge in relation to colonialism – the critical issue that arises is whose version can be taken as the correct one, if there is a correct version or whether there is scope to accept multiple “truths”? Sandew Hira illustrates this critical point through the case of the European Christopher Columbus: was he a hero that the world should continue to honor with newer statues to augment the 600 that have already been erected for the progress he has contributed to the world or was he a criminal …\n\nwho opened the door to genocide and enslavement of the indigenous people of Abya Yala (the Americas) and the European enslavement of Africans. The 600 monuments should be brought down and destroyed and his crimes should be exposed in the textbooks on the history of the world.\n\np. 124\n\nSuch issues are used to illustrate conundrums for approaching the question of what constitutes valid knowledge, and what de facto gets codified in the term scientific knowledge which then becomes “the basis for educational policies” (p. 124). A fundamental faultline here builds on the taken-for-granted superiority claimed by and conferred on European science where there is a confusion between correct and free thinking. Here true science is understood as being built on objectivity i.e., something is either true or false, while dimensions of right and wrong are relegated to ethics i.e., subjective dimensions. Such a distinction relates fundamentally to the historical genealogy of European epistemology that evolved in opposition to Christian theology.\n\nThe key issue is that the evolution of scientific knowledge was not shaped by such an opposition in alternative epistemologies across the planet: both the objective (truth-falsehood) and the subjective (ethics i.e., right and wrong) dimensions of knowing were and are seen as being inseparable parts of scientific knowledge in these epistemologies. While European knowledge building takes place through observation (leading to understandings regarding data collection) and reasoning (in terms of induction, deduction and validation), Sandew Hira presents the central idea of “conceptual thinking” as the basis of alternative epistemologies (illustrated through dtm). Here it is a concept that is central; for instance, in the instance of “the discovery of the continent of America by Christopher Columbus” – which is approached through observations or “a collection of facts about the object of knowledge production” that can respond adequately to the question “what happened?” (p. 131). It is the analysis of the observations that “offers a framing and a storyline with a certain logic that makes us understand why the natural and social reality is how it is and how it has developed” (p. 131). Here the very positionality or the locus of enunciation of the storyline – from which position can we understand the discovery narrative as opposed to the discovery of territories that were already inhabited and the storyline of a crime against humanity that played out thereafter – is critically important. Theory – in this “conceptual thinking” ethos – is made up of a “collection of interrelated concepts that provides a bigger picture of the natural and social reality” and it is here that the “ethical component has practical consequences”; these relate to emotions that in turn are consequential for our response to the original question of “what happened?” (p. 132). Sandew Hira maintains that there are four crucial differences between Eurocentric and dtm and alternative epistemologies: the former\n\n(i)does not distinguish between knowledge and lies,\n\n(ii)uses the same research methods for generating knowledge about human society and the natural world (thus reducing the importance of human relationships in knowledge work),\n\n(iii)is based on a two-value logic (rather than a multi-logic ethos) of true or false that is applicable only to static situations, and\n\n(iv)is confined to understanding what has happened or what is going on and thus has no methodology for envisaging knowledge about the future.\n\nThe second point in this list is particularly pertinent to issues of positionality since epistemologies of natural and social worlds differ in terms of the object of knowledge (i.e., what is being researched) and the subject of knowledge (i.e., who is doing the researching) – this can be separated in the former, not in the latter.\n\nSandew Hira’s emphasis on bringing in history as a key dimension to unpack contemporary atrocities – physical and epistemological – is, as highlighted earlier, a crucial dimension of dtm. Multiple histories – and particularly those that have been erased from the singularly framed collective memories – are in crucial need of “re-memory”30 for making our futures hopeful; this constitutes another important message of Sandew Hira’s volume. Bringing into focus the present-day state of the world through acknowledgements of how shifts in “instruments of subjugation” deployed in the processes of colonization and how these have marked and shaped our present are crucial, Sandew Hira argues through a multitude of examples. Public memory is created and enshrined not only in institutions like libraries, museums, monuments, digital resources, cultural industries and media, but significantly also in and through educational institutions across K-12 and hei s. How the major genocides committed across the 500 years of colonialism are erased from memory is a vile illustration of how such processes evolve and are maintained. Thus, for instance, and without belittling the atrocities involved, we need to trouble why the main – perhaps the only – history of genocide that gets highlighted in our re-memory is a European one?31 Such a query is critically relevant to the epistemological task from a dtm stance. It calls for troubling of the continuing place accorded to selective genocides that are remembered while others are erased from our collective memory. The much larger numbers of casualties and the brutalities that colonialism inflicted in the name of Enlightenment and superiority across the planet across 500 years remain unaccounted for in the singular grand narratives of our times.\n\nTaking over other peoples land, committing brutal genocides, enslaving millions of people and forcing millions of other people into different forms of forced labor were initially the main instruments of subjugation, oppression and exploitation.\n\np. 86\n\nThe Abya Yala Holocaust was followed by another unimaginable crime against humanity: trans-Atlantic enslavement. The foundations of the current world economy (including production, transportation, finance, consumption) was based on this crime. The systematic kidnapping of Africans over several centuries and enslaving them to work under brutal circumstance in Abya Yala took a huge toll on human lives. It led to a disaster in Africa … which lost a massive part of her young and industrious population … At least 12 million people were loaded in the floating prison ships for enslavement in Abya Yala. At least two million people lost their lives during the trans-Atlantic crossing and humdreds of millions were enslaved in the 300–400 years of enslavement … Hundred of millions of lives were destroyed by this system.\n\np. 279\n\nThe epistemological task here lies in asking how it is possible that the storyline we i.e., European and northern Abya Yala settler communities have built up – continue to privilege the atrocities of one Holocaust where an estimated 11 million humans were terminated, and completely, or mostly, erase the centuries of colonial atrocities wherein “[h]undreds of millions of lives were destroyed”? The Swedish case is further illustrative here. Despite its complicity in the slave trade, colonial wrong-doings in the Caribbean in the past and continuing crimes against its indigenous populations, children in its schools even in the 21st century are shielded from learning about such distressing facts.32 Such erasures continue to enable the aura of superiority that frames the Swedish nation-states image out in the world.33\n\nThe issue of selective acknowledgement of crimes against humanity and erasures is one of two points that can be noted with regards to the epistemological task of hei. The second relates to the shifts in instruments of subjugation across timespaces. This too needs careful study if hopeful presents and futures can be imagined. Thus, interrogating continuing colonial naturalizations in how vocabularies re-enforce hegemonic regimes and how, not paying attention to the multiple and intersecting positionalities of who is doing the (de)colonial work of liberation, why, in what ways, etc. needs emphasis.34 While acknowledging that “[c]hanging terminology can be an arduous enterprise” (p. 20), Sandew Hira’s important troubling of naturalized vocabularies constitutes a key dimension of dtm.\n\nDecolonizing academic language is part of decolonizing the university [… and] Decolonizing the universities also means taking a fresh look at how knowledge produced from a pluriversal perspective can find its way to large sections of the population outside the regular institutions of education and the media.\n\np. 400\n\nIn addition to the European renaming of Abya Yala to America,35 the 2021 launching of a petition by the Māori Party to reclaim the name Aotearoa from the te reo Māori language for what we have learnt to call New Zealand, and ongoing petitions by Sami to reclaim Sami names from the imposed Swedish names constitute illustrations that re-center multiversal framings.\n\nThe stance that Sandew Hira takes is to pedagogically use the terminologies of indigenous peoples as an effort to support these efforts. Here a caveat is that the term “Indian” is retained in the volume for the peoples of Abya Yala, even though Sandew Hira presents far-reaching consequential critique on how the European Christopher Columbus’ navigational mistakes and subsequent atrocities in Abya Yala can be seen as the start of the colonial era. Following his own logic of dtm, it is unclear why Sandew Hira uses “World” instead of “European” for what we have learnt to call the two wars in the 20th century; both wars emerged in and were fought primarily through the agencies of European powers (including its allies across the Atlantic) primarily on European territories, even though they drew on the human power of the colonized peoples they ruled over in other parts of the planet.\n\nGenre, Style and Cover\n\nSandew Hira’s writing style aligns interestingly with mainstream academic textual practices with important disruptions of conventions. He uses non-indented paragraphs without space, calls the chapter sections paragraphs when cross-referencing to draw the readers’ attention to other dimensions of his arguments, points the reader to a tapestry of illustrations both internally in the book and outside of it. The genre and style the reader meets in this volume gives rise to issues regarding who we scholars write for, why we write in the manner we write, who has decreed that the mainstream writing genre is how it should be, what referencing habits we take for granted and why we adhere to them in a slavish manner …36 These are not innocuous queries, and while I have raised them in earlier southern framed reflective texts, I am not alone in doing so. Aligning with the idea to multiversify academic writing, like Sandew Hira, I disturb some academic conventions in this reflective paper, including the mainstream genre of writing a review. In lieu of a standard summary of Sandew Hira’s 2023 volume, my attempt has been to think with the authors’ offerings and take the dtm framework to task by using it to make sense of the oddities (or rather the non-sense) playing out in contemporary human existence (see the three Notes that illustrate some oddities). The 572-page volume’s rich and troubling offerings are outlined unconventionally here, dialogically.\n\nThe narrative style of Sandew Hira’s volume is pedagogical even though there are repetitions and, despite what orientations and alignments a reader might have when they come to this 572-page volume, Sandew Hira gets the reader to think with him and his ideas. The narrative style can come out as being jarring at times. For instance, when historical and/or contemporary figures and powers are labelled with less-than flattering adjectives: “Columbus the Criminal” (p. 96), “butcher Ariel Sharon’s visit to the Al-Agnar mosque in Jerusalem” (p. 507), “bullying of the West” (p. 520) etc. Here, taking a step back and thinking with the author, i.e., taking a dtm stans, the reader is invited to ask whether it is the mainstream narratives the majority on the planet have so successfully been socialized to believe as the truth, or whether it is the mental slavery that the majority need to be shaken from that gives rise to jarring feelings when the reader is confronted by such unconventional academic languaging? This is an important question and is perhaps constitutive of the dtm agenda of “providing another narrative” (p. 12). Furthermore, given that these ideas are far from simple, repeated close readings of different parts of the volume can be necessary for a Euro-situated and Euro-thinking scholar who may not (as yet) have met decolonial waves that have, since 2015, come ashore hei, if they are to gain traction from the volume’s argumentation.\n\nA distraction in the volume are the unnecessary typos that the reader meets across its pages. While most are merely annoying (spellings and grammar related typos, jumbled numbers [establishment of Oxford University presented as 1906, rather than 1096, p. 396]), a couple are more glaring: sub-section numbering in Chapter 13.4.3 is incorrectly displayed in the table of contents (p. 11) and incorrectly marked inside the chapter (p. 498; there is also an incorrect cross-referencing on p. 503). A re-print of the volume should iron out these inconsistencies.\n\nThe volume cover is pedagogical and hope-inducing despite the horrific story it builds upon. It illustrates the history of resistance against colonialism in both deeds and words. The cover represents what the last Aztec ruler of Tenochtitlan, Cuauhtémoc, narrates in 1521, a year after becoming an 18-year-old ruler and having lost the battle to drive the Spaniards out:\n\nOur sun is now hidden from view. The face of our sun has disappeared, and has left us in complete darkness. But we know it will return again, that it will rise again, and it will begin to illuminate us anew.\n\np. 67\n\nCuauhtémoc was tortured and held in captivity for over three years before being executed. Arguing that another better world is indeed possible, Sandew Hira offers five ethical principles for the basis of a new world civilization (pp. 516–520); the principles’\n\nof justice and solidarity,\n\nof human dignity,\n\nof harmony,\n\nof pluriversalism, and\n\nof non-interference.\n\nThese principles, he convincingly argues, build on imagining “a world in which simple dreams of peace, love and prosperity can come true … probably in less than fifty years” (p. 522).\n\nObituary to Epistemic Violence and Continuing Coloniality\n\nThe primacy of decolonial and southern thinking is crucial for epistemic and existential sustainability for enabling hopeful futures for both the planet and its human, non-human and material constituents. In my reading of Sandew Hira’s call for Decolonizing The Mind, dtm, to enable imagining a new world, I note an alignment with the speech of the Swedish poet, author, director, actor and comedian, Tage Danielsson (see Figure 2); this speech is titled “advice to a newborn child” and was delivered on the occasion of the UN day, 24 October 1982. Sandrew Hira and Tage Danielsson’s calls build on socializing minds through the centrality of remembering with the intent to upfront a new existence where peace is privileged. Nothing can be achieved if epistemic violence is allowed to be buried in the continuing grand narratives of falsehood, Sandew Hira pushes us to recognize.\n\nSuch invitations by thinkers across the territories of the north and south need to be heeded with the utmost sincerity and seriousness both within and outside hei. Putting peace first requires concerted efforts by all – those historically marginalized and wronged, and those privileged and party to the injustices perpetuated on others. Returning to the three Notes and mobile gaze framed reflections in the introduction of this paper, remembering and acknowledging wrong-doings are a precursor to unlearning for relearning so that foundations of peace can be created. These foundations are our primary hope for ending epistemic violence and continuing coloniality in all territories on the planet."
