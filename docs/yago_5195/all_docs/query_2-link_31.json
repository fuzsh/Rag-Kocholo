        "text": "According to the Swedish cinema owners’ association Sveriges Biografägare Förbund (SBF), although cinema-going was relatively stable in 2019 with 16 million tickets sold - down 3% from 2018 - local films accounted only for 13.2% of the market, with 2,102,109 admissions, one of the lowest points in decades. In revenue terms, Swedish films were down 11.7% to SEK 225,955,610 (€21.2m).\n\nThe results were all the more disappointing as Swedish films in 2018 had improved their performance by 5% in admissions compared to the previous year, and upped their market share to 18.7%.\n\nIn its statement, SBF noted that the market share for Swedish films would have been even worse - around 10% - if it wasn’t for the 2019 Christmas releases Sune-Best Man and A Piece of My Heart (both produced by Unlimited Stories) that sold 160,359 and 166,632 tickets respectively.\n\nUnlike in 2018 when three Swedish films passed 250,000 admissions (A Moon of My Own/ 413,817, Solsidan-The Movie/ 387,435 and The Cake General 291,710), last year’s biggest local success was the animated film Bamse and the Thunderbell, released at Christmas 2018, which sold 220,029 tickets in 2019. Tuva Novotny’s Britt-Marie Was Here based on Fredrik Backman’s best-selling eponymous book, was the second most successful Swedish film of 2019 with 211,846 admissions.\n\nThe documentary Hasse & Tage by Jane Magnusson featuring the Swedish comic legends Hasse Alfredson and Tage Danielsson, was the sixth biggest Swedish film with 151,498 admissions.\n\nIn an official statement, Peter Fornstam, head of SBF said Swedish film is in crisis and in serious need of re-evaluation. “We need good Swedish films to attract cinemagoers,” he said, suggesting for audiences to be involved at an earlier stage and for professionals to dare “considering commercial aspects in the creative process.”\n\nQuizzed by nordicfilmandtvnews.com over her take on the downward trend for Swedish films, Anna Serner, CEO at the Swedish Film Institute said: “The main reason is that the audience prefers to watch Swedish films on other platforms. This is a global trend and a hard challenge. We need more knowledge about the audiences' preferences and we need stronger films,” she affirmed, adding: “There are no simple solutions and I believe we need to respect the fact that the consumption of films can happen with good experience at home as well. The challenge for the industry is the business model.”\n\nFor her, one of the challenges for the Swedish film industry is “the lack of facts and figures about consumers’ consumption on the various platforms.”"
