        "text": "A warm welcome to Uppsala International Literary Festival. This is the sixth festival since it began in 2018.\n\nThis year’s festival is a response to political and military threats to democracy and human rights. This is especially relevant given the presence of war that once again casts a shadow over Europe as well as the ongoing revolt against oppression in Iran. We see attacks on established democracies and opposition to democratic struggle against authoritarian regimes. Margaret Atwood reminds us that “War is what happens when language fails” and we see this in recent rhetoric of Russian leaders that distorts reality, relying instead on demagogy and the demonization of others to cover or excuse their own crimes against humanity.\n\nThe abuse of power and language to manipulate peoples’ emotions is evident in many other conflicts from Rwanda and the Balkans to the on-going internal conflicts in Iran, Iraq, and Turkey.\n\nAnd yet, in all such situations, literature presents resistance by testifying to truths. Even if it speaks from the place of a victim this is also a step in the direction of reparation, liberty, and reconciliation.\n\nIn that spirit, this year’s festival collaborates with the research program Democracy and Higher Education at Uppsala University. Research is fundamental for processes of democratization to flourish not only in societies fraught by violent conflict, but also in the context of polarized culture wars that presently divide normally stable democracies. Literature has the power to shed light on different points of view and to represent society in all its complexity. It can help marginalized or silenced voices be heard and it teaches us about democracy in the making. Researchers and students need to draw on that knowledge and at the same time the expertise of scholars can offer important historical and social contextualization to those questions that literary texts raise.\n\nIt has been said that during the communist era the retelling of Russian literature helped prisoners to survive the Gulags and today Russian authors speak of their own nation-state as a perpetual arch-enemy.\n\nWe will discuss books dealing with crimes committed in the Soviet Union, Russia, Ukraine, Bosnia, Rwanda, Iraq, Iran, and Turkey, but also books about how hate has taken root also in Sweden.\n\nTo speak with two Swedish authors, filmmakers and comedians, Tage Danielsson and Hasse Alfredsson:\n\nWe who are doomed to live in the era of distress?\n\nWhat do we do now? Which language should we address?\n\nWe would like to extend our infinite gratitude to the municipality of Uppsala, the Swedish Culture Council, the Swedish Academy and Democracy and Higher Education at Uppsala University.\n\nOnce again, a warm welcome!\n\nProgram 2023\n\nThursday 23 March – Akademibokhandel Uppsala\n\n18.00, The Faith of Iraq, told from Finland\n\nThe Finnish-Iraqi writer, poet and director Hassan Blasim ended up in Finland after he fled the war and the censorship in Iraq.
