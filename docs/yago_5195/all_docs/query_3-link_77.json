        "text": "Listed as Sweden's first animated movie.\n\nHans Alfredsson (in his late 30s when this movie was made) playing an old man that ends up on a retirement home. I can't say that I bought his performance, he just came off as a young person playing an older man. The live-action sequences are very slow and pretty mediocre.\n\nIt's when the animation begins that the movie shows what it really is. It's a very 60s style with both colors and wide and wavy character designs. It's hard to even imagine how it was done with so little information about animation back then. The humor is pretty dark sometimes and it even had me wonder if this would be suitable for kids today at all?\n\nPerhaps the trippiest film I've seen yet. This is the first animated feature film made in Sweden, and the first animated film directed by Per Åhlin, and based on those facts, this film is pretty impressive! My only critique is that the plot could've been executed a little better, but overall I like this a lot!\n\nIt was really fun to see Tage Danielsson and Per Åhlin come together in a movie so old by their standards and that they created such an interesting animation. They both work together nicely as directors and styles of both indivuals are given space to be clear to the viewer. And we can't forget about Hans Alfredson who helped out with the writing and acting. Taking in consideration that this is Åhlins first movie and the first movie with some added animation to it in Sweden, this is a good movie. But it's just not very enjoyable most of the time and I never felt interesting in finding out what was going to happen next."
