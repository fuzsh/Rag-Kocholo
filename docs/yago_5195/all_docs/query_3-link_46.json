        "text": "The natural environment around Ronja is also full of supernatural beings. Primarily it is populated with fantastic, more or less dangerous powers that are out to get you. Researcher Vivi Edström has pointed out that Astrid Lindgren takes up a dialogue with forest romanticism, forest terror and the forest fairy tale tradition. From those fairytales we remember the trolls and the giants, the harpies and the elves. But Astrid created her own mystical forest inhabitants that are reminiscent of traditional fairy tale characters, whilst they also represent something new: grey dwarfs, wild harpies, rumphobs… That Astrid Lindgren was protective of her creations was something one Swedish school book publisher became painfully aware of, when in a textbook about religion – in connection with an excerpt from Ronja, the Robber’s daughter – they had written that the grey dwarfs “in reality were ordinary stones in the forest”. In a letter to the publisher in 1985 Astrid Lindgren wrote the following: “And who is it that is taking the liberty of such a meddlesome, or dare I say simple-minded interpretation? The grey dwarfs, mark my words, are the most gruesome little living creatures (though cowardly) that ever frightened a child out of its wits. And, as long as I live, no adult interpreter and destroyer is going to come and fool 6,000 children, or so, into thinking that ‘in reality’ there are no fairy tales.”\n\nJust as she created new forest inhabitants, Astrid also made up new names, words and expressions that she uses in the book. And, as the story is set in the middle ages it was important that the language and names of people and places would sound authentic and true to the times. Several of the first names have a very special background. Lena Törnqvist tells in her book “Man tar vanliga ord – att läsa om Astrid Lindgren” (Take ordinary words – Reading about Astrid Lindgren) (2015) that they are derived from Astrid’s school atlas of the Swedish alps. Ronja’s name is taken from the Ju-ronjaure-kåtan, northwest of the town of Arjeplog and the names of the robbers Fjosok (Fooloks) and Tjegge (Shaggy) come from the lakes Fjosoken and Tjeggevas.\n\nBefore the book was released, the name Ronja was practically non-existent. Nowadays it’s a name used in several countries – in Sweden alone 5529 women and one man have Ronja as their first name –and the name Lovis is increasing among newborns. Tage Danielsson’s well-loved Swedish film version from 1984 has naturally also contributed to the popularity of the book and the name. In addition to the character names there are other more or less new words and expressions in Ronja the Robber’s Daughter that have also found their way into the Swedish vocabulary, for example rumphobs and spring shout."
