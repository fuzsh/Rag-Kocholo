        "text": "I know when you go to a museum, you should focus on the art. But for me, the architecture of the Joan Miró Museum is something really special. I love the rough concrete surfaces, and how the light is entering the building.\n\nThe museum is made up by three individual buildings; the studio where Miró started to work in 1956, and a late 18th century Mallorcan house that the artist used as a second painting and sculpture studio. And these buildings are just in the way the artist left them. The feeling is that he just went out for a little while.\n\nBut it is the third building that my heart beats a bit extra for, It is called the Moneo Building, and is the headquarter of the foundation. It opened in 1992 and is designed by the well-known architect Rafael Moneo.\n\nMoneo’s building provides the Fundació Miró Mallorca with exhibition space, a library, an auditorium, offices, a shop and café.\n\nIf you want to find out more; check out their homepage\n\nI think that most of us are attracted by older houses, but when it comes to renovate them, many choose the easy way out and modernizes them completely. To preserve the original features takes a good eye to know what to keep and what to do with them, but mostly it’s about having patience and respect for the past.\n\nLast year I shot a beautiful project here on Mallorca, that made me reflect over the beauty of the history. It was a big renovation but it was done without loosing the character of the original building. And not least from an environmental perspective, how much interior details that just needs a little tender love and care to become a masterpiece.\n\nProject made by Durietz Design and if you want to see more about the house, click here.\n\nPernilla Danielsson is a Swedish photographer that has been living on Mallorca for almost a decade. For more 20 years she was working next to photographers as an Art Director until she finally took the step to follow her passion and become one too. It all started with the idea of capturing the beauty of every day through her Instagram account @lifestyle_mallorca and only using natural light as her help.\n\nSoon she got recognized for her mix of scenic and interior pictures from the island and got featured in international magazines such as House and Garden, Harper’s Bazaar Arabia, Elle Decoration Sweden, The Spaces, Times Luxx and Hello India among others. A part from editorial content, she also has assignments with several high end brands to do lifestyle photography. Last year the beautiful book “Balearic Retreats” was released by Beta Publishing and she had 16 pages with her pictures for an interior project made by DuRietz Design.\n\nShe says “The essence of my photography is what I call “soul photography”. I love to catch a feeling and create a time capsule of that instant moment for people to remember. No matter if it is people or places, everything has a story to tell. And I love to be a part of that story telling.”\n\nMore Pernilla at her instagram: www.instagram.com/lifestyle_mallorca/\n\nPernilla is part of the European creative team at Fantastic Frank."
