Tage Danielsson (5 February 1928, Linköping – 13 October 1985) was a Swedish author, actor, poet and film director. He is best known for his collaboration with Hans Alfredson in the comedy-duo Hasseåtage.

Danielsson matriculated at the University of Uppsala in 1949, where he got involved in student theatre of Östgöta Nation and became a member of the Juvenalorden, as well as serving as vice president of the Uppsala Student Union.

After graduation, from 1955 and onwards, he worked at Sveriges Radio, and from 1959 to 1962 he was the manager for its entertainment department. At his time at SR he came in contact with Hans Alfredson. After having worked together as writers at SR they later also started to work together outside of the radio as writers for other comedy acts, such as Povel Ramel and his entertainment company Knäppupp, before deciding to quit their jobs at SR and start their own company. In 1961 they started the entertainment production company AB Svenska Ord together.

Svenska Ord in general, and Danielsson in particular, excelled in making scorching comments on current events in an illusorily naive and outward-lookingly friendly way that often succeeded to endear even political opponents to his particular brand of humorist humanism. He was also a constant campaigner behind the scene for causes ranging from Anti-Apartheid to Anti-Nuclear to social solidarity, and a regular contributor to the anarcho-syndicalist newspaper Arbetaren.

In 1980 he received an honorary doctorate at Linköping University.
