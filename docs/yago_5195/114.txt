Peter Picasso

In 2023, it will be 50 years since the death of Pablo Picasso. It is also 45 years since the release of the movie Picasso’s Adventure, directed by Tage Danielsson. The film was largely shot in Tomelilla. The main characters include Hans Alfredson, Gösta Ekman and Margaretha Krook.

When the artist Peter Johansson was invited to exhibit at Tomelilla konsthall in 2023, he suddenly had a vision: It would be an exhibition inspired by Picasso’s adventures!

During the summer, Tomelilla konsthall, Hasse &amp; Tagemuseet and the square in Tomelilla will host Peter Johansson’s major art project Peter Picasso.

Site-specific installations and sets will create a backdrop for a number of short films.

“Not that it can compete with the fantastic movie that I love and have seen so many times. But Hasse &amp; Tage have been my role models both artistically and humanistically throughout my creative life so my exhibition Peter Picasso will be more of a contemporary art event, loosely based on Picasso’s adventures. A tribute to the movie and everyone involved.”
