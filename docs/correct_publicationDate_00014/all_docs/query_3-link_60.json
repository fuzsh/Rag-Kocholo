        "text": "Virtual environments such as games and animated and \"real\" movies require realistic sound effects that can be integrated by computer synthesis. The book emphasizes physical modeling of sound and focuses on real-world interactive sound effects. It is intended for game developers, graphics programmers, developers of virtual reality systems and training simulators, and others who want to learn about computational sound. It is written at an introductory level with mathematical foundations provided in appendices.\n\nLinks to code examples and sound files can be found on the Downloads/Updates tab."
