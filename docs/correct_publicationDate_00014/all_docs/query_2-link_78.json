        "text": "BY DAVID WILLSONR\n\nIn the January/February 2011 issue of The VVA Veteran we published David Willson’s “A Few Well-Chosen Words,” which reviewed the poetry of the Vietnam War. We asked Willson to review that literature again, but this time to show what veteran-poets have written about the peace.\n\nVietnam War poetry also deals with the challenges and struggles veterans have with PTSD, married life, fatherhood or motherhood, careers, further educationuniversal concerns that Vietnam War veteran poets have turned their talents and attention to. I trawled through hundreds of Vietnam War poetry books and chapbooks, and enjoyed the pursuit of the perfect poems for this piece. I found enough poems and produced enough comments and thoughts for a hundred-page essay. I’ll present just a sliver of that here.\n\nMany poets tell us that there is life after our war, and that life is worth living and worth writing poetry about. Not all of our poets say that, but many do. Life after war is often hard, and the writing about that life can be angry and filled with blame, but it also can possess forgiveness.\n\nMany Vietnam veterans returned home and got on with their lives and had great, productive lives. Others did not. There are no statistics on this that I trust. How could there be? It’s a subjective thing, a personal determination if your life has worked out. When we returned to The World on the so-called Freedom Bird (I never heard either of those expressions in Vietnam), our return could be a rocky experience, and Vietnam War poetry shows us what that could look likewhat forms that could take. Expectations were high, often unrealistic. Some young returnees actually expected a paradea delusion that always puzzled me.\n\nWe hadn’t left Hitler dead in his bunker, Mussolini hanging by his heels, or Tojo in whatever oblivion was designated for him. It was business as usual in Vietnam. And at home as well. A parade was out of the question. There was no counseling for us, nobody to talk to. So many of us wrote poetry. Poured out our souls. Some of it was fine stuff and some of it was not so fine. I’ve searched for honesty in the writing and will start off with a short poem by John Wilson that cannot be faulted for its bald honesty and for how it expresses feelings that I have seen in hundreds of Vietnam War memoirs, novels, and poems. This is from Wilson’s book, Coming Home: Reflections of Vietnam. Wilson served as a Navy journalist in Vietnam.\n\nHeal With Time\n\nI’m many years older now\n\nAnd the emotions should be gone\n\nBut, it seems there is no escape\n\nFrom my time in Vietnam\n\nMostly, I remember going there\n\nWith Patriotism and Pride\n\nThen Coming Home again\n\nScorned and Pushed Aside\n\nWilson’s short poetical reflection is a summation of the point-of-view of an enormous number of Vietnam veterans. His poem is an accessible crowd-pleaser, written as directly as he can make it. For contrast, look at Horace Coleman’s poem from his book, In the Grass.\n\nIt Was Jane Fonda’s Fault\n\nor College Again\n\nStirring us up.\n\nLooking good.\n\nMaking sense.\n\nToo many of us had\n\nweirdly & recently\n\nseen people buy it.\n\nTim Butz\n\n(of later Counterspy fame)\n\ncame by a day or so afterwards.\n\nOrganized and left.\n\nDoing it again\n\nsome place else\n\nFonda went.\n\nWhen we reached our assembly point,\n\npeople used old habits to pick leaders\n\n(date of rank).\n\nThe little I had was enough,\n\nSo I led ’em out singing:\n\n“And it’s one, two, three,\n\nwhat are we fighting for?”\n\nAnd we really knew this time,\n\nstraggling toward a building\n\nI sat in.\n\nAfter we searched and destroyed\n\nsome “Vietnamese villagers”\n\nright in the middle of ROTC’s\n\nnew tin soldier party,\n\nwe talked to the crowd.\n\nA smug kid student\n\n(must have had a\n\nhigh draft number\n\nand a low “reality IQ”)\n\nthought he’d shut me up by saying,\n\n“Well, you must know; you’ve been there.”\n\nI splattered his face with,\n\n“Try thinking for yourself,\n\ninstead of believing\n\nwhoever yells loudest!”\n\nthen bounced a Bronze Star ribbon\n\noff a colonel so conditioned\n\nhe almost returned\n\nthe knife sharp salute\n\nI gave him as I left.\n\nThis poem might not be a crowd-pleaser, but it pleased me. It is also not immediately accessible, but like much good poetryor fine wineit rewards persistence and repeated exposure. It also brings home the oft-denied truth that some Vietnam veterans were comfortable returning from their war to college and antiwar demonstrations. I did it myself. Coleman’s fine book is filled with poems of great quality. Much of it is fun to read. Thought-provoking, too.\n\nMarilyn McMahon, in her chapbook Works in Progress, delineated the future that some of us had in store due to exposure to bad stuff. We were told in grade school to believe in “Better Living Through Chemistry,” but our Weekly Readers lied to us about so much, and lulled us into being trusting automaton-citizens. So we bathed daily in Agent Orange and paid the price later. McMahon says it better in her poem, “Knowing.” Below the title of her poem is this quote:\n\n(“Recent research indicates that Dioxin is the most potent toxin ever studied.” …news report, September 1987).\n\nKnowing\n\nI watched the helicopters\n\nFlying slowly north and south\n\nalong the DaNang river valley,\n\ntrailing a grey mist\n\nwhich scattered the sun\n\nin murky rainbows.\n\nI never wondered if I knew\n\nall I ought to know\n\nabout what we were doing.\n\nI knew that it was called\n\ndefoliation,\n\nthat the spray would destroy\n\nthe hiding places of snipers\n\nand ambushing guerillas.\n\nI did not know to ask:\n\nat what price?\n\nEvery evening,\n\nthe sunset choppers arrived\n\nfilled with soldiers burning\n\nfrom jungle fevers:\n\nmalaria, dengue, dysentery.\n\nWe took them directly\n\nto the cooling showers,\n\nstripped their wet\n\ndirt encrusted uniforms\n\nas we lowered their temperatures\n\nand prepared them for bed.\n\nI did not ask where they had been,\n\nwhether they or the uniforms I held\n\nhad been caught in the mist,\n\nwhether defoliation\n\nhad saved their lives.\n\nI did not know to ask.\n\nI knew part of the price\n\nwhen nine other women\n\nwho had watched the helicopters\n\nand seen the mist\n\ntalked of their children:\n\nJason’s heart defects, and\n\nAmy’s and Rachel’s and Timothy’s.\n\nMary’s eye problems.\n\nThe multiple operations\n\nto make and repair digestive organs\n\nfor John and Kathleen and little John.\n\nHow lucky they felt when one child was born healthy\n\nwhole.\n\nHow they grieved\n\nabout the miscarriages\n\none, two, three, even seven.\n\nTheir pain, their helplessness,\n\ntheir rage when\n\nMarianne died of leukemia at 2,\n\nand Michelle died of cancer at 2 1⁄2.\n\nTheir fear of what might yet happen.\n\nI knew more\n\nwhen I watched my parents\n\ncelebrate their fortieth\n\nwedding anniversary,\n\nfour children, three grandchildren\n\nsitting in the pews.\n\nI knew what I would never know,\n\nwhat the poisons and my fears\n\nhave removed forever from my knowing.\n\nThe conceiving, the carrying of a child,\n\nthe stretching of my womb, my breasts.\n\nThe pain of labor.\n\nThe bringing forth from my body a new life.\n\nI choose not to know\n\nif my eggs are\n\nmisshapen and withered\n\nas the trees along the river.\n\nIf snipers are hidden\n\nin the coils of my DNA.\n\nThis long poem is both hard and easy to read. Conversational about death, loss, and what shea woman who volunteered to be an Army nurse in Vietnamgave up without knowing the price for serving. McMahon speaks for all of us who have had our lives derailed by exposure to dioxins, with an anguished but dispassionate and scientific voice, as suits a person with her medical training.\n\nHeartbreaking stuff to read, but necessary for all to read. Not just for veterans of that ancient war we served in, but for general citizens, to provoke them to think about the butcher’s bill being levied on the young who serve in our current wars. Their many deployments expose them to chemicals and violent forces that will cost them their health and their livesand the country trillions of dollars. As the late Pete Seeger (a fellow veteran) asked, “When will we ever learn?”\n\nTime for two shorter poems written by veterans who returned and successfully had families and who were able to protect, nurture, and enjoy their children. The lucky ones. David Vancil served in Vietnam for a year as an officer and an advisor. He has written poetry of that year in his book, The Homesick Patrol. This poem is from a more recent book, Night Photo, which deals with some of what he has done since his war.\n\nGeese Flying over the Basketball Goal\n\nTerre Haute, Indiana\n\nAbove us two geese rose from the nearby pond,\n\ndisturbed by our game, wings spread low overhead.\n\nWe stopped playing and looked up, listening\n\nto their honking complaints. They were so close,\n\ntheir legs dangled down. As if a rebound,\n\nit seemed we could’ve leapt up and easily grabbed them.\n\nBut why would we? Laughing instead, we watched\n\ntheir wings straining as slowly they climbed higher.\n\nBall on her hip, my daughter didn’t complain\n\nfor a change when they’d gone and I called it a night.\n\nVancil came back from his war, got more education, worked as a librarian and a professor, and wrote this lyric poem about the joy of spending time with his daughter. No bitterness here, only joy.\n\nAnother poem with a lot of joy is this one by W.D. (Bill) Ehrhart.\n\nCoaching Winter Track in Time of War\n\nThe boys are running “suicides”\n\non the football field today:\n\nten-yard increments out to the fifty\n\nand back again, push-ups in between.\n\nIt’s thirty degrees, but they sweat\n\nlike it’s summer in Baghdad,\n\ncurse like soldiers, swear to God\n\nthey’ll see you burn in Hell.\n\nYou could fall in love with boys\n\nlike these: so earnest, so eager, so\n\nready to do whatever you ask, so\n\nfull of themselves and the world.\n\nHow do you tell them it’s not that simple?\n\nHow do you tell them: question it all.\n\nQuestion everything. Even a coach.\n\nEven a president. How do you tell them:\n\nask the young dead soldiers coming home\n\neach night in aluminum boxes\n\nnone of us is allowed to see,\n\nan army of shades.\n\nYou tell the boys “good work” and call it a day,\n\nstand alone in fading light while\n\nmemory’s phantoms circle the track\n\nlike weary athletes running a race\n\nwithout a finish line.\n\nEhrhart is a Marine Corps veteran who became a coach and teacher of young men, and it is easy for him to visualize them dead in aluminum boxes. The Vietnam War informs and infiltrates everything Ehrhart does. He has learned from his war. The poem’s joy is leavened with a sense of dread. It’s taken from a book of essays, The Last Time I Dreamed About the War.\n\nLeroy Quintana wrote a classic volume of Vietnam War poetry dealing with his tour of duty, Interrogations. He has also written many books of poetry about his family and friends. Here is one of those poems from his book, The History of Home.\n\nTony\n\nThe winter I returned from Vietnam\n\nGrandpa told me Tony had been found\n\nfrozen to death in his pickup.\n\nIt was said he drank a lot; perhaps the mass layoffs.\n\nHe was good at marbles; swung an axe\n\nwith the strength, precision of somebody twice his age.\n\nHis father, I think, had abandoned the family.\n\nIn our First Holy Communion photo,\n\nhe is holding a candle,\n\nhis right hand over his heart,\n\nand smiling, wearing a new suit.\n\nTwenty years later the mines have been closed.\n\nI’m reading between the lines, but I feel that Quintana is saying that perhaps he was lucky to have been in warm and sunny South Vietnam, luckier than Tony, anyhow. Quintana survived to become a college professor and an acclaimed poet, but this is all we know of Tony. This isn’t quite a poem saying that the war had benefits for us, but it comes close. That war is in our bones and our souls. The proof is Quintana’s poem, “Eight Years After Vietnam.”\n\nI.\n\nEight years after Viet Nam\n\nI still walk the jungles in camouflage\n\nmy M-16 mind\n\non recon patrol\n\non city streets,\n\nin restaurants, bars, buses,\n\nduring breakfast, at work,\n\nmorning noon and\n\nnight,\n\nneighbors, relatives and friends, everybody\n\neven my family\n\nall have slant eyes\n\nI watch their movements\n\nlisten to their words\n\nrecord everything in notebooks\n\nII.\n\nNine years after Viet Nam\n\nwhere friendly woodchoppers by day\n\nwould be Viet Cong by night\n\nI’m still on recon patrol.\n\nEverybody has slant eyes.\n\nIt’s an M-16 world.\n\nTeacher by day, tonight\n\nI’m at the trigger\n\nof an electric typewriter.\n\nThis paper has yellow skin.\n\nThis poem has slant eyes.\n\nThis ultimate PTSD poem is from Quintana’s book, Sangre. There are many PTSD poems, but this one chills my blood and keeps me from searching the heap of poetry books for another. This one will do for all of the others.\n\nR.S. Carlson served his year in Vietnam, but these many decades later still is working that time out of his soul. This poem is from his book, Waiting to Say Amen.\n\nVeni Emmanuel\n\nSurprising\n\nhow well washed\n\nwe come, blood\n\non our hands,\n\nto take the\n\ncake bodied\n\nbefore us\n\ninto small\n\npieces and\n\neaten by\n\nlight of the\n\ntrick candle\n\nwe never\n\nreally\n\ncan blow all\n\nthe way out\n\nFor many of us, the war is that trick candle that we can never blow out. I’ve been trying since 1967 to do so. As you can see from this article, I have not been successful. For good reason, blood and fire often appear as images in the poetry of Vietnam War poets. Dennis Ward Stiles wrote Saigon Tea. Another of his books, The Fire in Which We Burn, contains his poem, “Today.”\n\nToday\n\nI did not want anything\n\nto die today. No bird. No mouse.\n\nNo worm. No ant. No blade of grass.\n\nI wanted each living life\n\nto wake in peace\n\nand fall asleep in perfect comfort.\n\nMosquitoes, bats, elephants, all.\n\nNo new skulls\n\nNo toothy jawbones\n\nIn the pastures.\n\nNo roadside crumpled carcass.\n\nNo insect spattered against glass.\n\nNo shriek of chain-saw ravishing a tree.\n\nNot a whiff of fresh-cut hay.\n\nNo mortal hurt of any kind.\n\nEven as the sun vanished\n\nand dark took hold\n\nwhile the slaughter continued\n\nand the heavens marched by\n\nin cold silence\n\nI did not want anything to die.\n\nI wanted blood to be honey.\n\nI wanted stars to be bees.\n\nStiles’s poem is life-affirming, filled with hope. A similar sentiment is expressed in this small piece of verse from Jerry Neren’s book-length poem, Once Upon a Time in Vietnam.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Vietnam.\n\nIn this new world of mine,\n\nI’ve laid my weapons down,\n\na pile of weaponry\n\nas high as a thousand-year-old redwood tree\n\nand ten times wider than the tree is high:\n\nthe rifle and slingshot,\n\nthe hand grenades and spray cans of pesticide,\n\nthe bomber and boomerang,\n\nthe M-16, harpoon and fishing lures,\n\nthe missiles and bug-zappers,\n\nthe sticks and stones,\n\nthe mousetrap and rattrap and rod and reel,\n\nthe battleship and bayonet,\n\nthe ant poison and fly swatter,\n\nthe helicopter gunship and hunting bow,\n\nthe decoys and duck calls,\n\nthe fighter plane and fishing pole,\n\nthe flypaper and flame thrower,\n\nthe mortars and rockets,\n\nthe land mines and landing nets,\n\nthe ammo belts and bowie knife,\n\nthe tanks and artillery,\n\nthe napalm bombs and high explosive bombs,\n\nthe small-game gun and big-game gun,\n\nthe handgun and shotgun and blowgun and machine gun,\n\nthe barrels of Agent Orange.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nno sooner would I march off to war again,\n\nthan desecrate my parents’ graves…\n\nThis gives the reader an idea where Neren now stands on war. I stand there beside him. I did not raise my sons to be soldiers. There have been Willsons in America’s wars since the Revolutionary War, and all since then, up to and including the Vietnam War. But none after.\n\nSome of us had a harder time than others with getting on with our lives. In his book, Lost Lambs, Bill Bauer introduces us to Larry, who had a strike or two against him. This poem gives more reasons why some of us are done with war. Bauer served in Vietnam in 1969 with his activated National Guard unit.\n\nLarry’s Lament\n\nSylvia knew Larry knew,\n\nand Larry knew she knew\n\nshe was lying,\n\nknew about the difference\n\nno left leg would mean,\n\nknew that metal thing\n\nthey called a leg\n\nwasn’t a leg nearly like\n\nhis blown off leg,\n\nand Larry knew after Thanksgiving Dinner\n\nat his parents’ house, her smile off center,\n\nshe knew she wouldn’t be\n\ncoming around very often\n\nin the holiday dress\n\nhe bought her before he left,\n\nwouldn’t be coming around\n\nno time except\n\nevery other minute\n\nin his mind\n\nLarry is no longer a normal American and never will be again. That was true for many of us, but Larry couldn’t run. Couldn’t hide. Every time I go to the Seattle VA Hospital to see my oncologist to find out if my multiple myeloma is on the march again, I pass by the area where the people go to get treatment for their missing limbs. Usually the elevator has one or two of these folks aboard. It makes for a sobering ride. That could have been me. Easy to imagine. Then I feel lucky just to have this fatal disease. Puts things into perspective for me. Since I read this poem, I now imagine that it is Larry in that elevator with me.\n\nFred Rosenblum served in the Marines in Vietnam, 1967-68. His poem “Festive Skies” deals with some of the same issues as the first poem in this article by John Wilson, but Rosenblum ratchets up the images. This is from his book, Hollow Tin Jingles.\n\nFestive Skies\n\nI haven’t visited that wall\n\nwhere my country buried me\n\nnor visited the structure\n\nof so-called empathy\n\nlest I be reminded\n\nand revive the numbing reality\n\nbut thanks for the slap in the face\n\nthe spit in the eye\n\nthe shun me shame me\n\nknife me in the pride\n\nthanks for the perpetual zombie silence\n\nthat I brought home to those who would forsake me\n\nthose families and friends\n\nwho weren’t calling us\n\n‘heroes’ back then\n\nRosenblum’s poem about The Wall in Washington is one of many by veteran poets, but he gets at things that all of us felt when we came home, but many of us never dared voice for fear of being considered bitter or maladjusted whiners.\n\nI’ll end with a poem from Jon Forrest Glade’s fine volume of poetry, Photographs of the Jungle, which should be on every Vietnam veteran’s shelf of the best books of our war. Glade served with the 101st Airborne in 1969 in the A Shau Valley as a pointman. His poem, “Walking Wounded,” exemplifies how all of us should support other veterans, no matter how different our tours of duty were. Because if we don’t help each other, who will we turn to?\n\nWalking Wounded\n\n(Denver, 1969)\n\n“This is Colfax,” the bus driver said,\n\n“Seventeenth is two blocks north.”\n\nThe man with the white cane said,\n\n“When I got on the bus\n\nyou told me you could stop on the\n\nforty-one hundred block of seventeenth.”\n\n“It’s just two blocks north.”\n\n“Look, I’m newly blind.\n\nI can’t cross the street without help.”\n\nThe bus driver said, “I’m sorry,\n\nbut there’s nothing I can do.”\n\nIt was none of my business,\n\nbut I butted in. “Give me a transfer.\n\nI’ll walk him over\n\nand catch the next bus.”\n\nHe got off without any help.\n\nHe had a nasty scar\n\nthat ran diagonally across his face.\n\nHis left eye was covered with gauze;\n\nthe other eye was blue,\n\nand I think made of glass.\n\nI told him I was a GI, too,\n\nanother patient from Fitz.\n\nI said I was on crutches,\n\nso I couldn’t take his arm,\n\nbut he could hang on\n\nto the hood of my coat.\n\nPeople stared. It’s not everyday\n\nyou see the crippled\n\nleading the blind."
