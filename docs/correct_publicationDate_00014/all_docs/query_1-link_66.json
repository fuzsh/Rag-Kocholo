        "text": "Virtual, augmented and mixed reality (VR, AR and MR) infiltrated not only gaming, industry, engineering, live events, entertainment, real estate, retail, military, etc., but as surveys indicate, also healthcare and education. In all these areas there is a lack of software development experts for VR, AR and MR to meet the needs of practice. Therefore, our intention at the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Matej Bel University in Bansk√° Bystrica, Slovakia, is to focus on the education and enlightenment of these areas. The aim of this article is to show the role of interactivity in different VR applications and its impact on users in three different areas: gaming, healthcare and education. In the case of one application of Arachnophobia, we also present the results of the research using a questionnaire.\n\nSUMMARY Research in virtual reality (VR) is a relatively young field, which has shown considerable growth in recent years, as the development of new interactive technologies has inevitably impacted the more traditional sciences and arts. This is more evident in the case of novel interactive technologies that fascinate the broad public, as has always been the case with virtual reality. The increasing development of VR technologies has matured enough to expand research from the military and scientific visualization realm into more multidisciplinary areas, such as education, art and entertainment. Consequently, virtual reality interfaces interaction techniques and devices have improved greatly in order to provide more natural and obvious modes of interaction and motivational elements. In spite of various concerns and objections regarding the appropriateness and educational efficacy of virtual reality, there remain compelling reasons for believing that virtual environments warrant serio..."
