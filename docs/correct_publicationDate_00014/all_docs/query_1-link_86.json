The document discusses several key aspects of virtual reality (VR) and metaverses. It notes that VR systems have three main characteristics - immersion, interaction, and optical fidelity. Immersion determines how much a user feels cognitively transported to an alternative world. Metaverses enhance immersion to make users feel more part of virtual activities. Embodied digital avatars in 3D virtual worlds allow for identity construction and a sense of presence with others. The creation of customizable avatars is an important part of the Roblox metaverse. Risks of metaverses include their potential influences on cognition, emotions and behaviors as well as challenges of equipment costs, physical health and safety issues, psychological impacts, ethical concerns, and data privacy risks.",
