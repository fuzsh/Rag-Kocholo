        "text": "March 2006\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Systemic Task Force was established in 2005 under the leadership of Commissioner Leslie E. Silverman. Chair Cari M. Dominguez charged the Task Force with responsibility for examining the Commission's systemic program and recommending new strategies for combating systemic discrimination. The findings and recommendations of the Task Force are presented in this Report.\n\nThe Task Force embarked on its work with the recognition that the Commission cannot effectively combat discrimination without a strong nationwide systemic program. Through interviews, focus groups and surveys of EEOC staff and external stakeholders, the Task Force gathered information and ideas regarding the Commission's current efforts at addressing systemic discrimination, the obstacles the agency faces, and the ways in which the agency more effectively could combat systemic discrimination.\n\nThe Task Force concluded that EEOC has successfully investigated, conciliated and litigated numerous systemic cases. For example, in recent years, the agency has addressed systemic sex discrimination at a large manufacturing facility and at a major Wall Street firm. It also has successfully challenged race discrimination in meat processing plants and a nationwide chain of clothing stores, as well as systemic disability discrimination at a major airline.\n\nThe Task Force, however, also found many opportunities for improvement. For example, we found that EEOC does not consistently and proactively identify systemic discrimination. Instead, the agency typically focuses on individual allegations raised in charges. There are few incentives for working on systemic cases, and the Commission's systemic efforts are neither coordinated nor consistent throughout the country. In addition, the Commission's technology framework does not support a nationwide systemic practice.\n\nThe Task Force developed numerous recommendations in order to address these and other findings. The recommendations build on the agency's past successes, capitalize on existing strengths, and maximize the effectiveness of EEOC's tools and resources. They are designed to ensure that the Commission has a coordinated, strategic and nationwide systemic program.\n\nSection I of this Report discusses EEOC's unique role in combating systemic discrimination, the work of the Task Force, the business case for change and the principles that should guide the EEOC's systemic program in the future. Section II addresses the identification and development of systemic charges, Section III addresses the investigation of systemic charges and Section IV addresses systemic litigation. Finally, Section V lists the Task Force's recommendations.\n\nThe Task Force believes that combating systemic discrimination should be a top priority at EEOC and an intrinsic, ongoing part of the agency's daily work. Some of the Task Force's most important recommendations include:\n\nSystemic Investigations. Districts should develop and submit to headquarters Systemic Plans that specify the steps each district will take to identify and investigate systemic discrimination and that describe how this work will be accomplished. Districts with significant systemic experience should partner with other districts, and staff with significant systemic experience should serve as team leaders, team members or mentors on systemic charges in other offices. Together, the Systemic Plans should ensure a coordinated, national approach to combating systemic discrimination.\n\nSystemic Litigation. EEOC should staff systemic lawsuits based on the needs of the case, rather than based on the office where the case arose. EEOC should determine the expertise needed in a particular case (e.g., expertise in large case management, statistics, relevant substantive areas and/or the industry at issue) and assign staff who have the necessary knowledge and experience.\n\nField and Headquarters Roles. The investigation and litigation of systemic cases should be performed solely in the field. Headquarters should support the field's systemic program through assistance with partnering, coordination, and legal and data analysis. Headquarters also should provide litigation support services.\n\nIncentives. EEOC should create incentives through performance plans and other means to encourage the field to: successfully identify, investigate and litigate systemic cases; partner with other offices and staff on systemic cases; and develop systemic expertise among staff. To enable districts to devote the resources necessary for systemic investigations, the Commission should modify office goals and transfer charges where appropriate.\n\nStaffing. EEOC should address staffing needs to ensure the success of a nationwide systemic program, including creating a number of GS-13 Lead Systemic Investigator and GS-12 Systemic Litigation Analyst positions in the field and filling expert positions within the Office of Research, Information and Planning (ORIP) and Research and Analytic Services (RAS) to support the field's systemic program. Some ORIP experts should work in field offices.\n\nTechnology. EEOC should ensure that its technology infrastructure supports a seamless nationwide systemic practice. The agency should link its charge data to EEO-1 Survey data, provide staff with the software and hardware necessary to litigate complex systemic cases and ensure that staff in different offices who work together on systemic cases can communicate and share information effectively.\n\nEnhancing Expertise. EEOC should enhance systemic expertise among staff through a variety of means, including partnering opportunities with other staff, formal and informal training, partnerships with other agencies and organizations, the formation of an internal systemic website that has materials relevant to systemic case development, and the creation of an electronic bulletin board or listserv to facilitate communication among staff working on systemic cases.\n\nAdvisory Committee. EEOC should create an internal Advisory Committee to help ensure that the systemic investigation program is effective nationwide. This Committee should not serve a management function but rather should assess the agency's overall effectiveness in combating systemic discrimination and serve as a resource on systemic matters.\n\nProactive Prevention. In support of its efforts to prevent discrimination and educate employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities under the federal anti-discrimination laws, EEOC should educate the public about systemic trends, issues and cases.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEEOC Is Uniquely Equipped to Combat Systemic Discrimination\n\nThe Work of the Systemic Task Force\n\nThe

INTRODUCTION\n\nCongress created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1964, charging it with the mission of eradicating discrimination in the workplace. When the Commission received litigation authority in 1972, a new era of enforcement began, with a strong focus on identifying, investigating, and litigating cases of systemic discrimination. In the ensuing years, EEOC, while under increasing pressure to manage individual cases more efficiently, has continued its efforts to address systemic discrimination.\n\nThe Commission's Systemic Task Force was established in 2005, forty years after the Commission first opened its doors. The Task Force was charged by Chair Cari M. Dominguez with responsibility for reassessing how the Commission addresses systemic discrimination, and for recommending new strategies for enhancing the Commission's systemic program.\n\nThe Task Force, led by Commissioner Leslie E. Silverman, is comprised of fourteen additional EEOC employees from the field and headquarters including management and a bargaining unit representative.1 The Task Force convened in headquarters for two days in April and three days in August, 2005, and conducted many other subgroup meetings and teleconferences. As a result of those meetings and of numerous interviews and other fact-gathering efforts that are described below in section B, the Task Force developed recommendations that are intended to enhance and refocus the Commission's systemic efforts so that systemic work becomes a pervasive and integrated enforcement and litigation practice throughout the agency.\n\nThe Task Force has defined systemic cases as \"pattern or practice, policy and/or class cases where the alleged discrimination has a broad impact on an industry, profession, company, or geographic location.\" This section of the Report provides an overview of (1) EEOC's unique role in combating systemic discrimination; (2) the work of the Task Force; (3) the business case for why change is needed; and (4) a description of the principles that must guide the Commission's new systemic program. Section II of the Report addresses the identification of systemic discrimination; Section III discusses the investigation of systemic discrimination; Section IV focuses on systemic litigation; and Section V lists the Task Force's recommendations.\n\nA. EEOC Is Uniquely Equipped to Combat Systemic Discrimination\n\nWhen Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq., making it illegal for employers to discriminate based on race, color, sex, national origin or religion, it authorized EEOC to investigate charges of discrimination, including classwide discrimination.2 Title VII also gave EEOC Commissioners the authority to issue charges on their own initiative (\"Commissioner Charges\").3\n\nCongress greatly expanded the agency's ability to address systemic discrimination when it amended Title VII in 1972.4 These amendments relaxed the standards for issuing Commissioner Charges,5 gave EEOC authority to file suit when conciliation efforts failed,6 and gave EEOC the authority to pursue pattern or practice cases.7 Congress subsequently granted EEOC authority to enforce the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),8 the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA),9 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).10 With that increased authority came increased responsibility for investigating and litigating systemic discrimination.\n\nAs Congress recognized, employment discrimination cannot be eradicated without a focus on its systemic manifestations.11 Thus, to effect workplace change, the Commission must have a nationwide systemic practice that proactively and strategically recognizes and addresses patterns of discrimination that have a broad impact.\n\nEach year EEOC receives approximately 80,000 charges of discrimination. Some contain allegations of systemic discrimination against a class of applicants or employees and, in other instances, EEOC expands the scope of the investigation of individual charges to address systemic discrimination. Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA each provide that an individual must file a charge with EEOC as a prerequisite to filing suit under the statute. Thus, EEOC serves as the national repository for virtually all formal allegations of employment discrimination brought under federal law. Congress conferred broad authority on EEOC to investigate these allegations, subpoena evidence, and seek classwide relief, all of which enable this agency to uncover, combat and eradicate systemic discrimination.\n\nIn addition to having this unique role and responsibility in combating systemic discrimination, EEOC has a unique ability to identify potential systemic cases. The agency has access to substantial data, including information on employment trends and demographic changes, that can help identify possible systemic discrimination. This data gives EEOC particular insight into areas such as hiring discrimination, where victims of discrimination often are not aware that they may have been denied employment based on unlawful criteria. Such information, combined with the Commission's ability to use either a Commissioner Charge (under Title VII or the ADA) or a Directed Investigation (under the ADEA or the EPA) where a possible victim of discrimination has not filed a charge, provides EEOC with the crucial tools needed to uncover systemic employment discrimination. 12\n\nFor several reasons, EEOC is also uniquely positioned to litigate systemic cases. First, unlike private litigants, EEOC need not meet the stringent requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in order to maintain a class suit in federal court. Second, as a practical matter, EEOC may be able to bring certain systemic cases that the private bar is not likely to handle, for example, where the monetary relief might be limited, the focus is on injunctive relief, or the victims are in underserved communities. EEOC also can file ADEA suits against state entities and obtain monetary relief, whereas private litigants are limited by sovereign immunity to obtaining only injunctive relief in such cases.13 Finally, the Task Force believes that EEOC's nationwide presence permits it to act as a large yet highly specialized law firm with a unique role in civil rights enforcement.\n\nB. The Work of the Systemic Task Force\n\nAs noted above, the Task Force set out to determine how the Commission could do systemic work more effectively. Pursuant to the Chair's directive, the Task Force focused on the establishment and delivery of a meaningful systemic practice rather than on the sources or amount of funding that would be required, because the Task Force cannot predict what the agency's budget will be over the next several fiscal years and is not in a position to assess the needs of other Commission programs. The Task Force did, however, aim to be prudent and practical in each of its recommendations so as to make its proposed program realistic and deliverable.\n\nIn order to accomplish its mission, the Task Force:\n\n(1) examined the current methods that EEOC uses - both in headquarters and the field - to seek out, investigate and litigate cases of systemic discrimination;\n\n(2) evaluated whether any changes should be made with respect to the current methods or structure of systemic efforts, both in headquarters and the field; and\n\n(3) sought to recommend ways in which the Commission can improve its methods and/or revamp its systemic efforts so that the agency can more efficiently and effectively combat systemic discrimination.\n\nThe Task Force engaged in extensive efforts to gather relevant information, including the following:\n\nSurvey to EEOC District Directors and Regional Attorneys - The Task Force began its work by developing and disseminating a survey to the District Directors and Regional Attorneys in each of the Commission's district offices.14 Through this effort, the Task Force was able to gather information about a variety of matters, including each district's efforts at addressing systemic discrimination, the type of assistance each has received from headquarters staff in the past, and the resources and assistance needed to develop and process systemic cases.\n\nEEOC Focus Groups - The Task Force conducted numerous focus groups with field and headquarters staff who have systemic experience, including investigators, enforcement supervisors, managers, directors, and attorneys.\n\nExternal Stakeholder Meetings - The Task Force conducted meetings with external stakeholders, including a broad spectrum of plaintiff and defense attorneys specializing in EEO class action litigation, civil rights advocates, representatives of the business community, and former EEOC Commissioners.\n\nMeetings with Academic Researchers - The Task Force conducted a focus group with academic researchers from several universities who are authorized to work with the Commission's charge or EEO-1 data 15 to conduct academic research pursuant to the Inter-Governmental Personnel Act of 1970.\n\nInput From Other Government Agencies - The Task Force reached out to EEOC's federal, state and local partners. It conducted meetings with career and political officials at the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor. In addition, the Task Force surveyed and conducted a focus group with EEOC's state and local fair employment practice partners.\n\nOpen Forum for EEOC Employees - The Task Force solicited input from the entire EEOC staff via an email from Commissioner Silverman inviting their comments on how the Commission could best combat systemic discrimination.\n\nA list of the many individuals and organizations that provided input to the Task Force is set forth in Appendix B.\n\nC. The Business Case: Why Change Is Needed\n\nThe Task Force determined that there are compelling business reasons to change the agency's current systemic program and practices based on the past successes, best practices and shortcomings the Task Force identified. In particular, the Task Force believes the following findings compel change:\n\nInsufficient and Imbalanced Utilization of Existing Strengths - The Task Force discovered pockets of systemic expertise in the field and in headquarters that are not being utilized to their full potential, mostly because of inadequate staffing, lack of properly directed resources and lack of incentives. Strengths found include individuals with expertise in matters such as management of large investigations, statistical analyses and applications, database construction, expert selection, electronic discovery and litigating large class cases.\n\nBecause these abilities are scattered throughout the field and headquarters, field strengths are utilized only on an ad hoc basis, and some field offices do not take advantage of available headquarters resources, EEOC needs to shore up its strengths and improve coordination. The new systemic program, as described in the following sections of this Report, will seek to use these existing strengths to the agency's strongest advantage.\n\nLack of Proactive, Consistent Efforts at Identifying Systemic Discrimination - The Task Force found that over the past decade, there has been a significant decrease in proactive efforts to identify systemic discrimination through research and analysis. Moreover, no office or unit is responsible for looking at the \"big picture\" nationwide - e.g., proactively reviewing charge data, survey data submitted by employers or other information in order to identify possible instances of systemic discrimination.\n\nDearth of Commissioner Charges - As a result of decreased efforts to identify systemic discrimination in a proactive way, there has been a precipitous decline in the number of Commissioner Charges, from an average of nearly 40 per year in the 1990s to only several in the past few years. The decline in Commissioner Charges followed, and possibly was an unintended consequence of, the Commission's 1995 adoption of the Priority Charge Handling Procedures (PCHP).16\n\nLack of Incentives - The Task Force concluded that there is a lack of incentives for devoting resources to systemic cases. In fact, many employees in the field perceive a disincentive to working on systemic cases due to the emphasis on inventory management. District Directors' performance plans and office goals no longer address systemic discrimination, office goals are not adjusted adequately to account for systemic charge development, and many employees in the field perceive that the development of systemic cases is not a Commission priority.\n\nLack of a National Perspective - The Task Force concluded that the Commission does not operate as a cohesive entity attempting to address systemic discrimination wherever it exists. Although the Commission has offices throughout the country, the agency does not utilize all available resources nationwide in determining how best to address systemic discrimination. Moreover, the current system does not encourage offices to collaborate to achieve the most effective results.\n\nLack of Training/Expertise Development - The Task Force found that there are skill gaps among enforcement and legal staff. Also, there has not been sufficient training on how to identify or develop systemic charges and not enough attention paid to developing staff expertise in systemic work.\n\nInsufficient Data - The Task Force believes that the Commission is hampered in its efforts to identify systemic discrimination by certain insufficiencies in the data the agency collects and by limitations in the manner in which the data can be utilized by staff.\n\nIn light of the breadth and scope of these findings, the Task Force determined that the Commission's current approach for dealing with systemic discrimination is in need of fundamental change. A new systemic program also is integral to effectuating EEOC's Five-Point Plan, which Chair Dominguez adopted in 2001, and the agency's Strategic Plan, which the Commission approved, that sets forth the strategy for accomplishing the goals of the Five-Point Plan.17 The Five-Point Plan requires EEOC to use available tools and deploy resources strategically in order to have a meaningful impact on discrimination in today's workplaces. It also calls for EEOC to examine emerging workplace trends and issues and to conduct annual reviews of economic indicators, demographic trends, employer practices, and industry literature, in order to make calculated decisions about which issues merit the agency's attention. Similarly, the Strategic Plan requires that EEOC engage in high impact litigation and publicity efforts that change the workforce status of affected groups and/or improve employment policies, practices, or procedures in affected workplaces.\n\nD. Principles That Must Guide EEOC's Systemic Program\n\nThe Task Force determined that in order to be effective, the Commission's new systemic program should be guided by the following principles:\n\nThe Commission Must Make Systemic Work A Top Priority - It is imperative that the Commission make the identification, investigation, and litigation of systemic discrimination a top priority. EEOC's highest management must recognize that addressing systemic discrimination is a critical, intrinsic, and ongoing part of the Commission's work. It should not be seen as simply a special agency project or initiative: it must be the Commission's ongoing practice. The Commission should expect EEOC employees at all levels to contribute to combating systemic discrimination. As such, the Commission must take all steps necessary to foster a culture that finds systemic work important, challenging and rewarding, and that supports systemic work with clear incentives, including modified performance plans and appropriate adjustments to goals and incentives.\n\nThe Commission Must Redeploy Resources and Cultivate and Support a Nationwide Systemic Practice - It is critical that the Commission provide staff, training, technology, financial resources and incentives to the systemic program.\n\nThe Commission Must Improve Methods of Identifying and Investigating Systemic Discrimination - The Commission has considerable resources and tools to assist in efforts to identify and combat systemic discrimination, but must ensure they are used effectively. For example, with respect to staff resources, the agency must identify the persons who have particular expertise and rely on them to identify and investigate systemic cases and to share their expertise. With respect to technology, the agency must better utilize the tools it has to identify possible discrimination, seek ways to make those tools even more useful in identifying and investigating systemic discrimination, and develop additional tools to assist staff in identifying and combating systemic discrimination.\n\nThe Investigation and Litigation of Systemic Cases Should Be Performed in the Field, with Headquarters Support - As presently constituted, the agency's only dedicated systemic program is housed in headquarters. The agency's systemic program has undergone numerous changes and reorganizations since it first was established in 1972. See Appendix C (Historical Background: EEOC's Systemic Efforts). The Task Force believes that investigation and litigation should be performed in the field, and not in headquarters, for a number of reasons. As a practical matter, almost all of EEOC's investigations and litigation, including systemic cases, are conducted in the field. The field can investigate and litigate on a regional or national basis as effectively as a headquarters systemic unit, especially because field offices have a natural pipeline of charges and are not restricted by jurisdictional lines in addressing discrimination beyond an office's borders. The Task Force believes that instead of investigating and litigating cases, headquarters should have a different, equally critical, role to play: supporting the field systemic program by providing technical guidance, analysis, assistance and support and by helping promote cooperation and collaboration between offices.\n\nThe Commission's Efforts at Combating Systemic Discrimination Must Be Nationwide - The Commission's systemic program must address systemic discrimination throughout the country, regardless of where EEOC offices, or EEOC employees with the most systemic expertise, are located. EEOC should have a \"big picture\" perspective on where the problems are and address them accordingly, by using Commission resources available nationwide. The systemic program must cover a wide range of issues and bases. In addition, the effort should be coordinated throughout the country, so that offices are not duplicating work or competing with each other but rather are collaborating, partnering, mentoring and supporting one another.\n\nEvery Office Must Make Efforts to Combat Systemic Discrimination - The Commission's systemic program must be a critical part of the work - the standard practice - in each district. The Task Force rejects the idea that systemic work should be conducted in only a small number of select offices that have particular systemic expertise. Because identifying, investigating and litigating systemic cases is an integral part of the agency's mission, it should be done in all EEOC offices. Moreover, isolating this task in certain offices would discourage the identification of systemic discrimination nationwide, discourage expanding the investigation of individual charges to address systemic allegations where appropriate, and interfere with the goal of expanding expertise.\n\nThe Systemic Program Must Encourage Collaboration - In light of the Commission's limited resources, the reality that certain offices and certain employees have particular expertise and experience in systemic cases, and the need to marshal the resources and expertise that the agency has in order to be as effective as possible, the systemic program must encourage collaboration among offices and districts. By creating incentives to share credit and resources, the program can also encourage strong collaboration between the field and headquarters and between different offices in headquarters. Moreover, increased collaboration will serve to broaden the Commission's expertise in systemic cases.\n\nThe Field Should Be Encouraged to Process Systemic Cases as Appropriate - Some employees expressed a reluctance to initiate or investigate systemic cases due to a concern that it would be extremely difficult to close the case even if the evidence did not suggest discrimination. Districts should exercise proper judgment and close systemic cases whenever it is appropriate, such as when a review of the information on hand indicates that further investigation is not likely to uncover evidence substantiating the allegations. Similarly, if it appears that a systemic investigation should be narrower than originally anticipated (geographically, or by basis or issue), the district should exercise appropriate judgment and narrow the scope of the investigation.\n\nWith these principles in mind, the Task Force made findings and developed recommendations related to the three critical steps involved in combating systemic discrimination: identifying, investigating and litigating systemic cases.\n\nII. IDENTIFYING SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION\n\nA. Background\n\nThe Task Force believes that the first critical step in strengthening and expanding the Commission's systemic program is improving the agency's ability to identify systemic discrimination. Based on that tenet, the Task Force sought to identify the methods and tools the agency currently has to identify systemic discrimination and to analyze their use and effectiveness. This section of the Report identifies the existing methods and tools; sets forth the deficiencies the Task Force found related to identifying systemic discrimination; and concludes by setting forth the Task Force's recommendations for improvement.\n\nThe primary tools and methods the agency presently has to identify and develop systemic discrimination charges are:\n\nCharges filed by members of the public - Virtually all of EEOC's approximately 80,000 charges each year come from members of the public who visit or write to an office and allege employment discrimination. Most charges allege individual and not classwide discrimination. During Intake, or while a charge is under investigation, agency employees may consider whether it would be appropriate to address possible systemic discrimination as well.\n\nIMS - The Commission's Information Management System (IMS) is an informational database that tracks all charges filed with EEOC and all litigation to which EEOC is a party. The IMS application itself allows users to run reports on charge and litigation data. Some field and headquarters staff also can run more sophisticated, ad hoc reports using a software tool called BRIO/Hyperion (\"BRIO\").\n\nEEO Surveys - EEOC annually collects from private employers with 100 or more employees, and most federal contractors with 50 or more employees, information by job category on their employees' race, sex and national origin on the EEO-1 form. On a biennial basis, EEOC collects similar data from referral unions, which file an EEO-3 form; state and local governments, which file an EEO-4 form; elementary and secondary level school districts, which file an EEO-5 form; and institutions of higher education, which file an IPEDS report with the Department of Education that serves as the Commission's EEO-6 report.\n\nEEO-1 Desktop - The Commission's EEO-1 Desktop program gives agency employees access to EEO-1 data submitted since 1995 and allows employees to aggregate the data by industry and geography and to run comparative analyses of establishments.\n\nOffice of Research, Information and Planning, and Research and Analytic Services - The Office of Research, Information and Planning (ORIP) staff includes social science analysts with extensive experience in using statistical and social science techniques to support investigations and analyze workforce data, including the EEO-1. Upon request from the field, ORIP analyzes data to assist offices in identifying systemic discrimination. ORIP also conducts studies on selected industries or professions. Also, ORIP has developed an internal website called the Integrated Statistical Information Site (ISIS) that provides certain reports based on IMS data, including charge trends and reports by office or industry. The field currently does not have access to ISIS. In addition to ORIP, Research and Analytic Services (RAS) in the Office of General Counsel (OGC) also has experts who assist in identifying systemic discrimination, although they primarily work on litigation.\n\nOGCNet - OGCNet is an internal threaded email system whereby OGC attorneys in the field and headquarters can pose questions and issues about their cases and exchange information with attorneys in other offices.\n\nInput from stakeholders, members of the public and sister agencies - An important part of any office's enforcement efforts is outreach to stakeholders and other members of the community. As part of these outreach sessions, agency employees may become aware of potentially important issues involving discrimination in their communities. EEOC can also obtain important information from other agencies, such as the Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCCP) at the U.S. Department of Labor and state and local Fair Employment Practice Agencies (FEPAs).\n\nReview of publicly available information - EEOC employees learn of employment discrimination trends or issues from newspapers or other publicly-available information. This information can be used to expand the investigation of individual charges or can form the basis of a Commissioner Charge or Directed Investigation.\n\nCommissioner Charges and Directed Investigations - Section 706(b) of Title VII, incorporated by reference by § 107(a) of the ADA, empowers Commissioners to file charges to permit investigation of employers or other covered entities identified as possible violators even where no individual has filed a charge.18 Under the ADEA and EPA, EEOC may conduct a Directed Investigation even where no individual has filed a charge. (See endnote 12.)\n\nB. Findings\n\nThe Task Force discovered that agency employees are not aware of - and therefore not utilizing - all tools available to them to identify systemic discrimination. We also found that most of the agency's existing methods of identifying possible systemic discrimination are not used in an organized, consistent or calculated manner. As such, the Task Force believes that there is great room for improvement with respect to the accessibility and usefulness of existing data, efforts to obtain additional data, internal expertise and support, and incentives for identifying and developing systemic cases.\n\n1. Access to, and Usefulness of, Existing Data\n\nThe Task Force found that the basic data available to the Commission - including charge data, EEO-1 data and U.S. Census data - is not linked, which interferes with the Commission's ability to identify possible systemic discrimination effectively. We learned that IMS data is often less accurate than EEO-1 data with respect to the proper name, location and industry of employers, because charging parties, rather than employers, provide the IMS information. The Task Force also found that most investigators cannot access nationwide IMS data from their desktops, which would be useful in determining whether there are multiple charges on the same issue and basis against a particular respondent. Also, IMS does not track certain information that may be useful in identifying systemic cases. We also found that the EEO-1 information available to investigators is not consistently current and does not allow for more sophisticated, user-friendly analyses.\n\nWhen the Commission does obtain useful systemic data, it is not consistently or reliably shared between headquarters and the field or among field offices. In addition, the information that serves as the basis for EEOC's public reports on workplace trends is not shared with the field for purposes of identifying systemic discrimination.\n\n2. Efforts to Obtain Additional Data\n\nThe Task Force found that efforts to obtain workforce data beyond the existing systems are uneven. There is no strategic effort to obtain trend information through outreach to community organizations or academics. Also, there is no plan to identify proactively important economic indicators such as the growth and decline of particular segments of the workforce. Instead, those Commission field offices that have an interest in systemic discrimination drive the Commission's identification of systemic discrimination by reaching out to obtain data.\n\n3. Internal Expertise and Support\n\nThe Task Force determined that there is a wide range of expertise among Commission staff, including investigators and attorneys, with respect to identifying and developing systemic charges. There is little if any user-friendly, easily accessible guidance on the Commission's website or elsewhere providing information about how to identify or develop systemic charges. There is no network for field investigators conducting systemic work to pose questions or share information.\n\nThere are too few expert labor economists and statisticians in ORIP and RAS to conduct analyses of data proactively and in response to field requests. The experts in ORIP who provide support for systemic investigations are not in a distinct division or organizational unit within ORIP. There are no headquarters employees in OGC or the Office of Field Programs (OFP) designated to provide assistance or support related to the development of systemic charges.\n\n4. Incentives\n\nCurrently, Commission investigators are not encouraged through performance standards or other means to use existing data, including EEO-1 data, as part of the development of systemic charges. As discussed in Section III.B.3., many employees believe there are disincentives to identifying and developing potential systemic cases.\n\nThe Task Force found that there is little incentive to expand individual charge investigations. Several plaintiffs' attorneys informed the Task Force that some EEOC field offices sometimes discourage or even refuse to accept allegations of class discrimination in charges.\n\nThere is also little incentive to develop Commissioner Charges or Directed Investigations, which we believe are important tools in the effort to combat systemic discrimination, as many victims of discrimination do not come to EEOC because they fear retaliation, do not know about their rights, or are unaware of the discrimination (particularly where the issue is hiring). Some staff in the field mistakenly believe that proposed Commissioner Charges are subject to multiple layers of headquarters review and some believe that Commissioners are reluctant to sign proposed Commissioner Charges.\n\nC. Recommendations\n\n1. The Commission Should Link, Track and Distribute Data More Effectively\n\nIn order to better identify possible systemic discrimination, EEOC must begin by utilizing the data it routinely collects in a more comprehensive and strategic way, particularly with respect to charge data in EEOC's IMS system and data from EEO-1 Surveys.\n\na. EEOC Must Link Charge Data to EEO Survey Data\n\nThe Task Force believes it imperative that the agency link the charge data in IMS with the employment data in the EEO-1 and other EEO Surveys so that the data in EEO-1 reports can easily and automatically be imported into IMS.19 If IMS is linked with the unique employer identifiers used in the EEO-1 form, EEOC can improve the accuracy of the data in the IMS system, decrease the amount of time necessary to enter data into IMS and more easily track and retrieve data about charges filed, particularly with respect to data on multiple charges on the same basis filed against the same employer. Recognizing the importance of this recommendation, members of the Task Force have met with staff in the Office of Information Technology (OIT) and developed system requirements for the necessary modification to IMS. (These are addressed in Section V.E. and endnote 37, infra).\n\nb. EEOC Should Enhance the IMS System\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission modify the informational categories in IMS, which track matters such as the type of discrimination and issues alleged in each charge. This will allow the agency to designate and track systemic investigations more accurately and collect data on issues that are of particular interest to the Commission, but not currently tracked in IMS (e.g., identifying job categories at issue). The agency should also improve the report-writing capabilities of IMS.20 In addition, the Task Force recommends that the agency enhance the IMS reports that are planned for the ISIS and BRIO applications; these applications should be expanded to include more reports relevant to detecting possible systemic discrimination, such as reports that more closely identify trends. EEOC employees should be able to produce ad hoc reports based on their analytical needs.\n\nc. EEOC Should Enhance the Delivery of EEO-1 Data and EEO-1 Desktop Reports\n\nThe Task Force has several recommendations related to the EEO-1 Surveys. While we recognize that EEO-1 data alone is of limited use in revealing systemic discrimination, we believe there are ways to make the data more useful to the Commission. First, the Task Force recommends that the Commission integrate U.S. Census data into the EEO-1 Desktop, which will allow staff to construct Census-based availability estimates.\n\nSecond, the Commission should improve the internal processing of the EEO-1 Surveys by making the data available to EEOC staff on an internal website. (Currently, each office must separately update and maintain the software and data sets.)\n\nThird, the Task Force believes that it takes too long to make EEO-1 data available to staff. The Task Force recommends that the Commission expedite the delivery of this data so as to make it available to staff by the end of each calendar year.\n\nFourth, we recommend enhancements to the reports generated by the EEO-1 Desktop. This application allows employees to easily retrieve EEO-1 Surveys submitted by employers and to run certain analyses of EEO-1 data. The Task Force found that the EEO-1 Desktop is a very useful tool; however, the Task Force recommends enhancements with respect to the system's analytic capabilities and the reports it generates.\n\nFifth, the Task Force suggests incorporating a geographical information system (GIS) component into the EEO-1 Desktop. This would allow users who want to compare establishments or populations in a certain geographic area to select the desired area using a map rather than merely a list of counties. The Task Force learned that the Department of Justice has access to a GIS system and finds it user friendly and valuable in helping to identify possible discrimination.\n\nd. EEOC Should Expand Access to the Data It Collects\n\nThe Task Force believes that the Commission should give field staff greater access to relevant data, and additional tools with which to analyze the data, in order to increase their effectiveness at identifying systemic discrimination. We therefore recommend that the Commission give relevant staff in the field greater direct access to IMS data and report-writing software (including BRIO and ISIS) so that they can search and generate reports using nationwide charge data. In addition, the Task Force recommends that investigators and attorneys experienced in working with EEO-1 data (and relevant supervisors and managers) be given access to SAS, a statistical software package, and SAS-based EEO-1 data sets to allow them to conduct more sophisticated analyses of data.\n\n2. EEOC Should Engage Its Stakeholders and Federal, State and Local Partners in Efforts to Identify Systemic Discrimination\n\nThe Task Force believes that field offices and headquarters staff should use outreach opportunities with national and local community based organizations, workers, academic researchers, and the plaintiffs' bar to identify possible systemic discrimination. The Task Force also recommends that the field collaborate with their FEPA partners to identify possible systemic discrimination via joint outreach endeavors, efforts to encourage FEPAs to inform EEOC about possible systemic discrimination they become aware of, and other appropriate means. The Task Force further encourages coordination between the Commission and its sister agencies at the federal level, particularly the Department of Justice, the Office of the Solicitor at the Department of Labor, and OFCCP.\n\n3. ORIP Should Take a Primary Role in Analyzing Data\n\nThe Task Force recommends that ORIP enhance its efforts at analyzing data for the purpose of identifying systemic discrimination. ORIP should focus on the \"big picture\" from national and regional perspectives. Among other things, ORIP should examine nationwide and regional charge data, EEO-1 data, Census data and other data sources.\n\nIn addition, ORIP should work closely with the field to learn about local issues and concerns and to obtain information about particular charges of interest. ORIP also should identify local academicians who periodically are willing to discuss research on local economic trends with field offices. To facilitate collaboration between ORIP and the field, the Task Force recommends that each district designate a person who can serve as the primary point of contact for ORIP on issues related to the identification of systemic discrimination.\n\nThe Task Force further recommends that ORIP gear formal studies towards identifying systemic discrimination for possible enforcement action. In order to determine relevant topics for these studies, ORIP staff should consult with the field, appropriate headquarters offices and stakeholders.\n\nAs discussed more fully in Section III.C.8., the Task Force believes that the Commission will need to hire additional staff to enable ORIP to meet the needs of the Commission's new systemic program. We recommend that some of the new staff should be placed in the field.\n\nWe further believe that performance standards for the ORIP employees who support the field's systemic program should reflect these responsibilities.\n\n4. The Commission Must Effectively Utilize the Information Gathered and Alert Staff to Possible Systemic Discrimination\n\nThe Task Force believes that it is crucial that the Commission provide pertinent information about possible systemic discrimination to field employees. Thus, the Task Force makes the following recommendations:\n\na. ORIP Should Prepare User-Friendly Reports\n\nInformation collected and analyzed about possible systemic discrimination is useful only if it is shared with front line staff in a user-friendly format. To that end, the Task Force recommends that ORIP prepare succinct reports tailored for particular districts or regions. These reports, which should be used for enforcement purposes, should include data on economic trends, demographic shifts, and nationwide themes and patterns. ORIP should also identify bases, issues, industries or employers of interest.\n\nb. The Commission Should \"Flag\" Matters of Interest in IMS\n\nThe Task Force believes that some of the issues, bases, industries and/or employers of interest ORIP identifies, in consultation with OFP and OGC, should be flagged in the IMS system, so that investigators and other field staff can be alerted as early as the Intake stage and follow up as appropriate.\n\nc. Districts Should Identify Priority Issues\n\nThe Commission should encourage each district to designate its own priority systemic issues.21 This will allow investigators and other Intake staff to identify certain types of issues at the earliest stage. Because these are likely to be regional or local concerns, the Task Force believes it would be beneficial for districts to share these priorities with their FEPA partners.\n\n5. The Commission Should Encourage Collaboration Among Offices\n\nThe Task Force believes that EEOC should focus on systemic discrimination wherever it occurs. This national approach will require greater coordination and cooperation between offices in the field, between the field and headquarters, and among offices within headquarters. In particular, because systemic discrimination frequently crosses the jurisdictional boundaries of the EEOC's districts, the districts should share information and ideas related to identifying systemic discrimination, including their systemic priority issues lists, with other districts and with headquarters. Each district should identify an employee responsible for coordinating with ORIP, OFP and OGC on identifying systemic discrimination. The Task Force recognizes that this recommendation puts added responsibility on the field at every level - from Intake personnel to the District Directors - and, as such, that implementing it will require resources, support and encouragement from all of headquarters.\n\n6. Districts Should Develop Systemic Plans\n\nAs discussed more fully in Section III, the Task Force recommends that each district develop a Systemic Plan which outlines the district's strategy for identifying and investigating systemic discrimination.\n\n7. The Commission Should Enhance Expertise Among Staff and Provide Useful Guides and Other Materials\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission develop expertise among staff in identifying systemic discrimination. We further believe that the Commission should create an internal website that includes materials related to the identification and development of systemic charges, such as guidelines and sample documents, and create an electronic bulletin board or listserv to foster communication. (See fuller discussion of these issues in Sections III.C.5., 6.)\n\n8. The Commission Should Encourage Efforts at Addressing Systemic Discrimination Through Expanded Charge Investigations Where Appropriate\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission reaffirm its policy that individuals may allege class discrimination in charges and ensure that staff are aware of this position. While districts have the responsibility to determine when to expand an investigation to address class issues, individuals (and third parties) have the right to file class charges if they so desire.\n\nThe Task Force further recommends that management in headquarters and the field encourage expanding the investigation of individual charges and investigating class allegations in charges, where appropriate.\n\nBecause most potential systemic cases are (or should be) designated as A-1 charges, the Commission should reaffirm the principle that A-1 cases should not be sent to the mediation program without the concurrence of the Regional Attorney.\n\n9. The Commission Should Encourage Efforts at Addressing Systemic Discrimination Through Commissioner Charges and Directed Investigations Where Appropriate\n\nIn order to be proactive in identifying systemic discrimination, the Task Force believes that EEOC also should use the data it collects through IMS and EEO-1 Surveys and the data it reviews from the U.S. Census and other sources to pursue possible discrimination via Commissioner Charges and Directed Investigations where there is no appropriate charge with which to pursue the issue. The development of Commissioner Charges and Directed Investigations ordinarily should be based on the thorough consideration of factors such as current economic conditions, demographic data, relevant labor markets, industry data, underserved areas or populations and charge data. We believe that Commissioner Charges and Directed Investigations should be a regular part of EEOC's systemic enforcement efforts.\n\na. Commissioner Charges\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission issue a memorandum explaining the procedures for initiating and investigating Commissioner Charges, as set forth in PCHP.22 The Task Force also suggests that the Commission clarify the type of evidence and information that should be included in a Commissioner Charge proposal. The Task Force believes that the following information should be included in each proposal:\n\nThe respondent's size and type of work it performs;\n\nThe reason a Commissioner Charge should be issued; and\n\nA description of the information or preliminary evidence supporting the allegations that discrimination may have occurred (this can be based on a variety of sources, including news reports, ads, statistics, or anecdotal information).\n\nFurther, the Task Force recommends that OGC legal staff and employees in ORIP and OFP be designated to serve as contact people for field offices developing Commissioner Charges. These employees should be available if a field office wishes to seek headquarters assistance or guidance in researching or preparing a proposal (this should involve assisting the field, not performing oversight).23 They also should facilitate communication between Commissioners and the field, if requested.\n\nIn addition, the Task Force recommends that when new Commissioners arrive, the agency educate them on the Commissioner Charge process. Commissioners should be encouraged to work closely with a field office when they have an idea for a Commissioner Charge that they would like the field to pursue (to ensure that the field office supports the proposed investigation) and when they are reviewing a field proposal.24 Commissioners also should be encouraged to have realistic expectations regarding the amount of evidence available for a Commissioner Charge25 and to recognize that early closure of an investigation may be appropriate where the evidence does not support the allegations.\n\nBecause the Task Force found that the Commissioner Charge approval process has been hampered by delays in recent years, we believe that Commissioners' Offices should be urged to respond to proposed Commissioner Charges in a timely manner, and that the Office of the Executive Secretariat should ensure that the Commissioners follow the review process.\n\nFinally, to encourage offices to propose Commissioner Charges aimed at routing out systemic discrimination, the Task Force recommends that, for an initial two-year period, the Commission provide incentives to District Directors and Regional Attorneys for submitting systemic Commissioner Charges that are approved by a Commissioner.26 The issue of incentives for addressing systemic discrimination is addressed more fully in Section III.C.4.\n\nb. Directed Investigations\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission encourage District Directors and their designees to initiate Directed Investigations when they have sufficient indication of systemic discrimination under the ADEA or the EPA. The Task Force recommends that the Commission promote the use of Directed Investigations as part of the agency's overall effort at combating systemic discrimination and issue a memorandum explaining the procedures for initiating a Directed Investigation.\n\nIn addition, the Task Force suggests that the employees designated in OGC, OFP and ORIP to assist field staff in preparing or investigating Commissioner Charges also be available to the field for questions or assistance regarding Directed Investigations in systemic cases.\n\nIII. INVESTIGATING SYSTEMIC CHARGES\n\nA. Background\n\nThe Task Force reviewed the history of the agency's efforts at combating discrimination through the investigation of systemic charges. As discussed in Appendix C, beginning in about 1979, each district office had a separate systemic unit comprised of approximately four to six systemic investigators who were responsible for developing, investigating and conciliating Commissioner Charges in their districts. OFP had extensive oversight over the field's systemic program. The systemic units were phased out in the mid to late 1990s, following the Commission's adoption of PCHP.\n\nSince that time, districts have investigated systemic discrimination using a variety of organizational approaches. For example, in some offices, one or two experienced systemic investigators typically investigate all of the systemic charges. Other offices pull together a team of investigators to investigate each systemic case; in some offices, attorneys are also assigned to the investigative team. Some offices treat systemic charges in the same manner as other charges.\n\nAs discussed in Appendix C, there is also a small complement of systemic investigators working with attorneys in OGC's Systemic Litigation Services (see also endnote 35).\n\nThis Section addresses the Task Force's findings regarding what has worked and what has not worked in EEOC's investigation of systemic charges and recommends reforms to the process to maximize the efficient use of resources and improve effectiveness.\n\nB. Findings\n\nThe Task Force found some instances of successful systemic investigations, most of which involved close coordination between the enforcement and legal staff. Many of these successful systemic investigations resulted in significant litigation (see Section IV.B. of this Report). We also found a few instances in which systemic investigations culminated in conciliation agreements that the Respondents agreed to publicize. For example, the Commission conciliated a case against a nationwide chain of hair salons involving alleged race discrimination in hiring, promotion and termination; the case settled for $3.5 million, and the company agreed to put in place several measures designed to prevent discrimination in the future. The Commission also publicly conciliated a Commissioner's Charge involving a high-end restaurant chain's alleged failure to recruit and hire women for food server positions; the employer agreed to pay $500,000 in relief and voluntarily implemented changes in its employment practices, which included mandatory hiring discrimination training and more effective applicant tracking and record-keeping systems.\n\nThe Task Force learned that, although there have been a few instances in which districts have partnered with one another to conduct a systemic investigation, this is a rare occurrence. (One recent example of successful partnering occurred in the investigation of Abercrombie & Fitch, where two districts worked together to investigate and settle (through a consent decree) allegations of discrimination against Black, Hispanic, Asian and female applicants and employees.)\n\nThe Systemic Task Force identified the following areas for improvement with respect to the Commission's efforts to investigate systemic discrimination.\n\n1. The Commission's Approach to Systemic Investigations\n\nThe Task Force found that the Commission does not have a strategic, coordinated approach to investigating systemic discrimination nationwide. Also, EEOC districts rarely collaborate with each other on systemic investigations. In addition, the Task Force found that in cases where there are indications of class or broad systemic discrimination, many EEOC employees are reluctant to expand an investigation beyond the individual charging party, the named facility and/or the particular EEOC office's geographical boundaries, for a variety of reasons.\n\n2. Consistency of Efforts to Investigate Systemic Discrimination\n\nThe Task Force found that the Commission does not investigate systemic discrimination consistently throughout the country. While some districts pursue these cases vigorously, other offices focus on different priorities, and some offices simply lack the necessary staff, expertise or experience to pursue systemic investigations.\n\n3. Priorities and Incentives\n\nThe Task Force learned that many employees believe that investigating systemic discrimination is not a Commission priority. District Directors have not had goals related to addressing systemic discrimination since approximately 1994. Many people reported that efforts to achieve office goals in other areas, such as outreach and inventory management, make it difficult to devote necessary resources to systemic cases. In response to the Task Force's survey to District Directors and Regional Attorneys, over 90% of the district offices stated that workload constraints prevented their district from devoting staff time to systemic cases. One hundred percent stated that an adjustment to office goals would be helpful in assisting their districts in pursuing systemic investigations.\n\nSimilarly, many employees told the Task Force that there are not adequate incentives for developing or investigating systemic cases. In fact, many employees felt that there are disincentives for doing this type of work, because it interferes with achieving inventory management goals. Eighty-five percent of the District Directors and Regional Attorneys who responded to the Task Force's survey identified \"lack of incentives\" as an obstacle in developing large systemic cases. The vast majority of the Commission employees with whom the Task Force conferred expressed the desire to perform more work on systemic cases, but indicated they believe the Commission's current priorities and incentives discourage such work.\n\n4. Staffing\n\nMany employees advised the Task Force that in order to carry out a vigorous systemic program, the field would need additional staff, particularly investigators (especially those with systemic expertise). In addition, the Task Force learned that some of the Commission's best systemic investigators have moved to management or mediation positions in order to obtain a promotion beyond the GS-12 level, thereby further depleting the number of seasoned systemic investigators.\n\n5. Enhancing Expertise\n\nWhile the Commission has many employees throughout the country who have strong skills and broad experience in developing and working on systemic cases, a significant portion of the agency's workforce does not have the requisite expertise. The Task Force learned that many employees do not know how to use the primary tools and resources that are critically important in systemic cases, including EEO-1 Desktop, EEOSTAT, EXCEL, and Census data. Very few employees have access to or know how to use BRIO (software that analyzes charge data from IMS) or SAS (software that conducts sophisticated analyses of data). Investigators who work on systemic cases do not have access to, or training in, CaseSoft, which is litigation management software that attorneys sometimes use in class cases.\n\nMany employees lack expertise in substantive matters including: identifying possible systemic discrimination (at Intake, during an investigation or based on data analysis); determining what evidence is needed in a systemic case; analyzing statistical data (including how and when to seek expert assistance); and applying the correct legal standards. Many employees need to develop skills in practical areas such as: working with electronic information; managing the multitude of documents or computerized records that are typically needed in systemic cases; tracking and communicating with large numbers of witnesses or aggrieved persons; and conciliating large systemic cases.\n\nMany individuals advised the Task Force that not every investigator is particularly suited for, or interested in, working on systemic cases, and that it would be best to develop expertise in staff who have strong analytical and organizational skills, an aptitude for statistics, and an interest in working on systemic cases.\n\nThe Task Force also found that the agency does not have user-friendly, easily accessible tools and guides for helping employees develop or investigate systemic charges. There is little if any information related to systemic work on the Commission's internal website (InSite). Moreover, finding information on that website can be difficult. The Task Force found that staff working on systemic cases want the opportunity to communicate electronically with one another using a bulletin board or listserv.\n\n6. Expert Services\n\nThe Task Force found that there are too few research and technical experts in headquarters to provide sufficient guidance and support for the field's systemic investigations (there are currently three experts in ORIP who perform this function), and the need for this type of assistance will expand greatly if the Commission adopts the Task Force's recommendations. Moreover, the experts do not have the requisite access to necessary journals, subscription services, studies and technological tools.\n\n7. The Headquarters Systemic Investigations Program\n\nSince approximately 1997, the headquarters systemic investigations unit has been part of OGC (see Appendix C). For a number of years, the unit has focused on cases designed to develop the law rather than large class cases. Members of the public do not file charges with headquarters, so there is no stream of charges from which the unit can develop systemic investigations.\n\nAlthough most of the individuals who spoke with the Task Force about the headquarters systemic unit focused on whether there should be a headquarters litigation unit (see discussion in Section IV.B.2. of this Report), some people specifically addressed the investigations function. Some spoke in favor of having an investigations unit in headquarters. However, most people advocated eliminating the investigation function from headquarters. Many suggested that a separate national systemic investigative office was not necessary because the field can perform this work as well, or better. Several commented on the difficulty of developing investigations from headquarters because only the field is connected to the pipeline of charges. Some felt that systemic work should be done in the field because field employees are more knowledgeable about local trends and issues, have closer ties to local community groups, and have more opportunity to learn about discrimination through Intake and the investigation of other charges.\n\n8. Ensuring the Success of the Commission's Systemic Program\n\nThe Commission does not have an entity at headquarters or elsewhere specifically responsible for reviewing the agency's effectiveness in identifying or investigating systemic cases. Both the field and headquarters have important roles to play in maintaining an effective systemic practice, and within headquarters, there are multiple offices that must contribute to the success of the program (particularly ORIP, OFP and OGC). No one office currently has responsibility for looking at the totality of the program and evaluating its effectiveness. Past headquarters efforts at overseeing the systemic program in the field were criticized widely as ineffective and highly burdensome.\n\nC. Recommendations\n\n1. All Districts in the Field Should Investigate Systemic Cases\n\nThe Task Force believes that all EEOC districts throughout the country should investigate systemic cases, because combating systemic discrimination is such an essential part of the Commission's responsibilities. We considered but rejected the suggestion that systemic investigations be conducted by only a few select offices that have been particularly successful in this area. We believe that combating systemic discrimination must be every district's practice.\n\nSystemic discrimination occurs nationwide and the Commission should be investigating it nationwide.\n\nHowever, the Task Force recognizes that not every office currently has the staff, expertise or experience to investigate systemic cases successfully on its own. Therefore, as discussed more fully below, we recommend that the Commission strongly encourage partnering and mentoring in order to ensure that systemic cases are investigated effectively throughout the country, and to promote the development of expertise.\n\n2. Districts Should Develop Systemic Plans\n\nIn order to ensure a coordinated, strategic, effective agency-wide approach to identifying and investigating systemic discrimination, the Task Force recommends that each district develop a Systemic Plan. The District Director and the Regional Attorney for each district should jointly prepare the Plan and update it annually (or more often, if necessary). As discussed more fully below, districts should submit Plans to OFP and OGC who should review the Plans and ultimately negotiate an annual Plan with each district.\n\nTogether, the plans should reflect a coordinated, national approach to combating systemic discrimination. As discussed below, this will require coordination between districts and sharing of resources between offices. Thus, while the Task Force envisions a Systemic Plan for each district, the Plans should be interdependent.\n\na. The Systemic Plan Should Address How the District Will Identify and Investigate Systemic Discrimination\n\nThe Task Force believes that the Systemic Plan should address two critical issues. First, it should describe the specific steps that each district will take to identify and investigate systemic discrimination. The Plan may address the investigation of existing charges and/or the development of Commissioner Charges or Directed Investigations. While the Plan should be as detailed and specific as possible, it should also be flexible enough to allow a district to change course if necessary. For example, if, after investigating a charge in accordance with a Systemic Plan, an office determines that it is unlikely that the respondent violated the law, the office should exercise appropriate judgment and dismiss the charge and then, in consultation with OFP and OGC, promptly modify the Plan to address other possible systemic discrimination.\n\nSecond, the Plan should describe how the identification and investigation of systemic discrimination will be accomplished, taking into consideration the district's strengths and resources. As indicated above, the Task Force believes that some districts can perform systemic work on their own with current staff, while others cannot because they lack resources or staff with the necessary skills and expertise. In light of this, and in order to ensure that the Commission is effectively addressing systemic discrimination nationwide, the Task Force recommends that the Commission encourage districts to collaborate with other offices and/or with particular staff members in other districts who have systemic expertise. In constructing approaches to accomplishing this work, the Task Force foresees a variety of possibilities, including offices with significant systemic experience partnering with other offices to jointly identify and investigate systemic discrimination,27 or select staff (investigators, attorneys, supervisors, etc.) who have specific expertise working on systemic charges with another office (e.g., as a team member, team leader, or mentor).28 In determining which approach to adopt, the Task Force recommends that districts take advantage of their existing resources and strengths district-wide (including all offices that are a part of that district) and address gaps. We make no recommendation as to how staff working on systemic cases within a particular district should be structured (i.e., whether there should be designated systemic teams or units, dedicated systemic investigators or hybrid teams, etc.); we believe that districts should determine the structure that will work best for them, in accordance with their Systemic Plan.\n\nRegardless of the approach adopted, the Task Force believes that there must be close coordination between legal and enforcement staff throughout the identification and investigation of systemic cases.\n\nb. Headquarters Should Assist the Field in Developing Systemic Plans\n\nThe Task Force recommends that OFP, OGC and ORIP assist districts in formulating their Systemic Plans by identifying potential partner offices and specific field or headquarters employees with relevant expertise. As discussed in Section II, headquarters staff should also work with districts to identify possible systemic discrimination to be addressed as part of the Systemic Plan.\n\nc. OFP and OGC Should Negotiate and Ultimately Approve Systemic Plans for Each District\n\nOnce proposed Plans are submitted, OFP and OGC should consult with ORIP and the advisory committee discussed in subsection C.12. below. In reviewing the Plans, OFP and OGC should ensure that each Plan is appropriate for the particular district, and that the Commission as a whole is addressing systemic discrimination in an effective and strategic way (this includes, among other things, ensuring that the systemic program addresses discrimination nationwide, and addresses diverse bases and issues).\n\nUltimately, OFP, OGC and each district should negotiate a Systemic Plan that is tailored for that district and contributes to the Commission's overall efforts to combat systemic discrimination nationwide. The final plans should be reviewed and approved by the Director of the Office of Field Programs and the General Counsel (or the General Counsel's designee). The Task Force believes that the Plans must require results, and that they may require adjustments to other office goals (see Section III.C.4. below). We recommend that District Directors and Regional Attorneys be evaluated on their success in effectively identifying, investigating and conciliating systemic cases, consistent with their Systemic Plan (see endnote 30, infra).\n\n3. The Commission Should Ensure Adequate Staffing on Systemic Cases and Create a Lead Systemic Investigator Position\n\nHaving a sufficient number of staff with the necessary expertise is critical to the success of the systemic program. We believe that it is especially important to ensure that the offices that partner with less experienced offices have sufficient staff to continue to perform their own systemic work.\n\nIn addition, the Task Force recommends that the Commission create and fill at least five GS-13 lead systemic investigator positions.29 To accomplish this, we recommend that offices that believe they have qualified employees submit justification memoranda requesting the position for their offices, and that OFP select from among district applicants. We believe that these positions should be filled with incumbent staff, who, based on their demonstrated expertise and quality work on systemic cases, could serve as mentors and team leaders on systemic investigations both within and outside of their districts. Creation of this position will allow the Commission to retain highly skilled staff in a critical role and will enhance a culture of excellence at the Commission.\n\n4. The Commission Must Create Incentives for Developing Systemic Cases\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission create incentives through evaluations and other means to encourage the field to successfully identify and investigate systemic cases, in accordance with the district's Systemic Plan.30 Thus, the effective development and investigation of systemic cases should be included as one of the expected results in the leadership element of the District Directors' performance plans.31 In addition, the Task Force recommends that the Commission create incentives to encourage the field to successfully contribute to the Commission's national program of combating systemic discrimination, through partnering, mentoring or other methods and to develop expertise among staff in the identification and investigation of systemic discrimination.\n\nIn order to make it possible for districts to devote the resources necessary for systemic case investigations, the Task Force believes that the Commission may need to make adjustments in some offices, such as reducing a district's outreach or production goals, \"backing out\" a certain percentage of staff time (such as 10% or 15%) or transferring cases from one district to another if additional staff resources are not available or expected. These adjustments also should be offered to offices that are willing to partner with, or provide staff resources to, other offices. The Task Force recommends that the districts and OFP address these types of adjustments during the negotiation of each office's Systemic Plan. (See Section IV.C.4. regarding incentives for systemic litigation.)\n\nFinally, the Task Force believes that effective work on systemic cases, including effective partnering and mentoring, should be recognized as part of the Commission's awards programs and any incentive pay plans.\n\n5. EEOC Should Enhance Systemic Expertise Among Staff\n\nThe Task Force believes that the Commission should continue to enhance systemic expertise among staff, including expertise in technological, substantive and practical matters as discussed in Section III.B.5. supra, using a variety of approaches. EEOC should use partnering and mentoring opportunities to pair employees who have performed high quality work on systemic cases with less experienced staff to work together on specific systemic investigations as a training and development tool. Although there are numerous employees at the Commission who are very skilled at identifying or investigating systemic cases, their skills are often underutilized. Employees with less expertise - especially those with strong analytical and organizational skills, an aptitude for statistics, and a strong interest in this area - could benefit greatly by working on systemic cases with their more experienced peers.\n\nEEOC should develop systemic expertise through formal training sessions, such as the training program on class case development and litigation that the Commission conducted successfully several years ago. Staff with practical experience in developing and litigating systemic cases should serve as trainers.\n\nEEOC should use informal, case-based training in field offices. This would be particularly useful once an office begins working on a particular systemic case.\n\nEEOC should promote the development of expertise through self-education and e-learning. The Commission should make available articles, books, videos and other materials that employees can use to develop their own knowledge and skills. (See also Section III.C.6. below, regarding the development and posting of materials.) Also, the Commission should improve its internal website (InSite), particularly the search function, to make it easier to find relevant materials.\n\nEEOC should provide training on CaseSoft, the litigation support software used by Commission attorneys, to some field investigators and other enforcement staff working on systemic charges, and make the software available on their desktops.\n\nEEOC should form strategic partnerships with outside agencies and groups to increase training opportunities and maximize Commission resources, such as possible joint training initiatives with the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, OFCCP and FEPAs related to systemic discrimination. The Commission should also partner with private organizations, such as the American Bar Association, the National Employment Lawyers Association and the Impact Fund, to provide joint training or to make arrangements for EEOC employees to attend their class discrimination training programs. (The Task Force believes that outside training and conferences can be very valuable not only because they provide formal training, but also because they can allow employees who already have expertise to network with others who perform the same kind of work and share experiences, which helps bolster confidence and morale.)\n\nTo facilitate the sharing of expertise among staff, EEOC should create an electronic bulletin board or listserv which would allow investigators and attorneys working on systemic charges to communicate with their peers regarding systemic cases and generate awareness of and interest in systemic cases for new and inexperienced investigators and attorneys.\n\nThe Task Force believes that in addition to providing training and development opportunities to field staff, EEOC should also offer such opportunities to the headquarters staff who focus on systemic discrimination issues, including the experts in ORIP and OGC.\n\n6. EEOC Should Create an Internal Website and Post Materials Related to Systemic Case Development\n\nThe Task Force recommends that EEOC collect and create materials related to combating systemic discrimination, and post them on an internal website devoted to systemic issues. Such materials should include:\n\na systemic manual;\n\ninterview guides;\n\nchecklists;\n\nquestionnaires;\n\nsample documents used in systemic investigations;\n\nconciliation guides;\n\ninformation about offices' best practices (for example, on Intake, case management, and outreach related to systemic discrimination);\n\ncase studies;\n\napproved Commissioner Charges (including brief descriptions of the issues and bases, and the evidence presented in the proposal); and\n\na list of contact people for follow-up discussions.\n\n7. Headquarters Should Not Have a Dedicated Systemic Investigations Unit\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission eliminate the headquarters systemic investigation function.32 We believe EEOC should conduct systemic investigations in the field, not in headquarters.\n\n8. Experts in ORIP Should Take a Primary Role in Providing Substantive Assistance to the Field on Systemic Investigations\n\nUpon request from the field, or consistent with Systemic Plans, headquarters employees should provide substantive assistance and guidance during systemic investigations, particularly with respect to reviewing and analyzing evidence and conducting statistical analyses. Headquarters employees should also help with investigative planning and strategy, drafting requests for information and case management. We believe that the research and technical experts in ORIP should be primarily responsible for providing this type of assistance during the systemic identification and investigation stages.\n\na. The Commission Should Devote Additional Resources to Expert Services for Systemic Investigations, Create a Distinct Unit, and Place Some Experts in the Field\n\nIn order to provide substantive assistance on systemic investigations and help the field in identifying systemic discrimination through analyses of data and other methods (see Section II, supra), the Task Force believes that the Commission will need to hire several additional experts in ORIP. The most immediate needs are for two labor economists, two social scientists, one industrial psychologist and one research assistant. We further believe that at least some of this additional staff should be located in the field, not in headquarters, so that they can work more closely with field staff. In addition, we recommend that ORIP create a distinct division containing all of the systemic support functions.\n\nThe Task Force also recommends that other resources be provided to ORIP (and RAS), including greater access to necessary journals and online subscriptions and enhanced technological tools, including the latest version of the SAS software (SAS-9) as well as periodic appropriate upgrades and updates of these tools. (We recommend that the agency provide access to many of these resources, including access to subscriptions such as Hoovers.com, to field staff as well.)\n\nb. Experts for Investigation and Litigation Should Remain In Separate Departments\n\nThe Task Force recognizes that in addition to the experts in ORIP, there are also experts working in RAS in OGC. The experts in ORIP provide substantive assistance on investigations, while the experts in RAS work primarily on cases in litigation.33 At various times in the past, all of the Commission's experts worked together in one division, but since 1994, the experts have been divided between two headquarters offices.\n\nThe Task Force considered whether the Commission should continue to keep the expert functions separate. Employees stated that when the experts all were located in the same department, they spent virtually all of their time on litigation matters, due to the demand for this type of assistance and the court-imposed deadlines, and had little time to assist on investigations. Because of time constraints and strategic advantages to having separate experts for investigations and litigation, the Task Force recommends that the Commission retain the current structure, and continue to have experts devoted primarily to assisting in investigations and others devoted to litigation.\n\n9. OGC and OLC Also Should Provide Substantive Assistance to the Field\n\nAppropriate OGC and Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) headquarters staff also should provide assistance to the field during systemic investigations, upon request or as part of a district's Systemic Plan. OGC headquarters attorneys are available to provide substantive guidance to field attorneys regarding systemic investigations. In addition, OLC attorneys are available to provide substantive guidance to field investigators and attorneys regarding legal issues during the development of systemic charges.\n\n10. Headquarters Staff Should Support the Field in Partnering and Coordination and Provide Other Assistance as Needed\n\nThe Task Force believes that headquarters staff in OFP, OGC and ORIP should assist the field in partnering, coordination, and other operational and logistical matters related to systemic charges. Support of the field's systemic program should be a vital part of the activities of these offices.\n\nHeadquarters staff in OFP and OGC should assist the field in establishing partnerships among offices and should identify employees in the field and headquarters who have expertise in relevant areas and can assist districts on particular systemic investigations.\n\nHeadquarters staff also should help with inter-office coordination on systemic claims. For example, when a district intends to investigate discrimination outside of its geographic boundaries, headquarters staff should work with the office to ensure coordination and avoid duplication of effort by multiple districts. OFP and ORIP also should work together to identify instances when more than one office is investigating similar claims against the same respondent and communicate this information to the field. Where appropriate, OFP should assist the field in coordinating the investigations or facilitate the transfer of related charges from one office to another in order to maximize efficiency.\n\nThe staff in RAS and ORIP should assist the field in identifying outside vendors and experts when necessary for investigations, including vendors able to perform data entry or database management, or persons with expertise beyond that available in-house.\n\nHeadquarters library staff should continue to assist the field in conducting research, particularly with respect to locating individuals and finding information about businesses or industries. This may require redeploying other headquarters staff to the library.\n\nFinally, headquarters staff should assist the field by enhancing technology in support of systemic investigations; facilitating the creation of materials, such as systemic manuals and guides for investigators; posting systemic materials on an internal website; facilitating communication between employees working on systemic investigations; and providing, or coordinating, training to field staff designed to enhance expertise in systemic cases.\n\n11. The Commission Should Increase Coordination with its Sister Agencies and FEPA Partners to Address Systemic Discrimination\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission work more closely with its sister agencies to combat systemic discrimination. The Task Force met with high level officials in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, and in the Solicitor's Office and OFCCP at the Department of Labor, all of whom expressed interest in working together to address systemic discrimination.\n\nWhere it appears that a state or local government has engaged in systemic discrimination in violation of Title VII or the ADA, the Task Force recommends that the Commission make an increased effort to communicate and coordinate with the Department of Justice. We also suggest that OGC and/or OFP designate an employee responsible for coordinating with the Department of Justice on an ongoing basis, particularly with respect to systemic cases.\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission also coordinate more closely with the Solicitor's Office and OFCCP at the Department of Labor. We understand that the Commission and OFCCP are working collaboratively on at least one systemic investigation at the present time, and we believe that both agencies will benefit from this cooperative approach.\n\nThe Task Force also recommends that the Commission expand efforts to partner with FEPAs on systemic investigations. In many instances, it will be beneficial to share information or conduct joint investigations in systemic cases.\n\n12. The Commission Should Create an Advisory Committee to Help Ensure that the Agency's Systemic Practice is Effective\n\nThe Task Force believes that it is critical that the Commission create a Committee of Advisors for Systemic Enforcement (\"CASE\") responsible for helping to ensure that the agency combats systemic discrimination effectively. CASE should not perform an oversight function or create an additional layer of approval or management for the field. Rather, CASE should be a useful source of assistance and support. Specifically, CASE should be responsible for:\n\nreviewing the agency's systemic efforts to see if they are nationwide and strategic and include a diversity of issues and bases and emerging areas of discrimination;\n\nevaluating the program's success from a national perspective and submitting semi-annual reports to the Commissioners and to the field that address:\n\ncurrent systemic enforcement efforts including identification, investigations, and litigation;\n\nan assessment of the issues, bases, geographic regions, industries, and/or emerging types of discrimination that the Commission should address more effectively; and\n\nstrategies for addressing the identified potential areas of enforcement\n\nassisting the field in identifying and pursuing systemic discrimination;\n\nserving as a resource on systemic matters, including providing guidance and advice on:\n\nthe field's Systemic Plans, upon request;\n\nthe content of the systemic enforcement website;\n\nthe systemic enforcement manual; and\n\nother tools and training developed to assist the field on systemic cases, and\n\nassisting the agency on systemic enforcement issues and strategies.\n\nWe recommend that CASE be comprised of a cross-section of no more than nine staff members from both the field and headquarters including: a District Director, a Regional Attorney, a Mentor or Lead Investigator, a Trial Attorney, and personnel from ORIP, OGC, and OFP. The composition of the committee could change over time.34 We recommend that CASE select a leader and determine how it will assign tasks among its members.\n\nCASE members should be selected based upon their systemic enforcement experience and expertise. In performing their work, they should consult with Commissioners and their staffs, field offices, headquarters offices, stakeholders, academics and FEPA leadership, as appropriate. Headquarters offices (e.g., OFP, ORIP, OGC, OIT) and field offices should provide information to the group as needed.\n\n13. The Commission Should Educate The Public On Systemic Trends, Issues and Cases As Part of Its Effort to Proactively Prevent Discrimination\n\nThe Task Force believes that as a complement to its enforcement efforts, the Commission should use outreach opportunities to educate employers and other members of the public about systemic discrimination, including trends and issues the agency has identified. This could include outreach focused on a particular geographic region, industry or size of employer. (See related discussion in Section IV.C.8. of this Report.)\n\nIV. LITIGATING SYSTEMIC CASES\n\nA. Background\n\nVirtually all of the Commission's systemic litigation is initiated and prosecuted by attorneys in field offices. Litigation is almost always handled by the office in which the underlying charge arose. Some offices have more systemic expertise and experience than others.\n\nIn addition to the systemic activity in the field, in headquarters OGC houses a small unit called Systemic Litigation Services (SLS), which has both investigative and legal staff.35 (The agency's past headquarters systemic efforts and organizational structure are discussed in Appendix C of this Report). SLS changed its focus in approximately the late 1990s from litigating systemic cases to searching for issue-oriented cases for possible development from the charge stage forward.\n\nThis section addresses the Task Force's findings related to the agency's systemic litigation efforts and recommends changes to enhance the agency's effectiveness and use of resources.\n\nB. Findings\n\nThe Task Force found numerous instances of successful systemic litigation. Systemic cases resolved by the field legal units during the past few years include: Carl Buddig & Co. (discrimination against African Americans in hiring and women in assignment at a meat processor with four plants); Rent-A-Center, Inc. (sex discrimination against women in hire, discharge, and terms and conditions of employment at the nation's largest rent-to-own business); Dial Corporation (sexual harassment of female employees at an Illinois production facility of a major manufacturer of soap products); Northwest Airlines, Inc. (disability discrimination action challenging airline's policy of excluding individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes and those taking anti-seizure medications from equipment service employee and aircraft cleaner positions); and Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. (sex discrimination against female professional employees of a global financial services firm in promotion opportunities, compensation, and terms, conditions, and privileges of employment). In addition, legal units have worked together effectively on a number of systemic as well as other cases. For example, offices partnered effectively on litigation against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (coordinated resolution of 13 pending ADA lawsuits).\n\nWith respect to the Commission's systemic litigation practice, the Task Force found areas for improvement with respect to: how attorneys are assigned to systemic lawsuits; the role of headquarters; incentives; enhancing expertise; paralegal staffing; and prefiling issues.\n\n1. Attorney Staffing on Systemic Cases\n\nThe Task Force found that in staffing systemic cases, the Commission does not sufficiently capitalize on the strengths and expertise of its staff nationwide but rather tends to have the staff in the office where the charge originated handle the litigation. Participation by staff with relevant expertise from other offices has been on an ad hoc rather than formalized basis. EEOC staff and outside attorneys, including some of the leading employment discrimination attorneys in the country, recommended to the Task Force that the Commission staff systemic cases based on experience, skills and interest. They suggested that as Commission attorneys develop expertise in a substantive or technical area, the Commission should turn to those attorneys to assist in, or even lead, the prosecution of other cases that require similar expertise"
