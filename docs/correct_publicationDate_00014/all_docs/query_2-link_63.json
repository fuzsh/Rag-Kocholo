        "text": "This is Not an Israel Sermon\n\nYom Kippur 5784\n\nAs I begin my remarks this Yom Kippur morning, there is one thing I want you to know: this is not a sermon about Israel.\n\nBut I want to share with you an eye-opening conversation about Israel this summer, when I was at Camp Havaya, an amazing Reconstructionist Jewish summer camp in the Poconos. I was privileged to serve as faculty there for a week in July, so, along with getting to enjoy camp life and seeing my kids be campers and make new friends, I led services and learning sessions for staff and campers of all ages.\n\nI decided I would lead some sessions on the situation in Israel, because a crucial vote on judicial reform was coming up in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, and I felt it was important that the camp community, this amazing, idyllic bubble of Jewish life tucked away in the woods, consider their connection to Israel, another amazing expression of Jewish culture and ideals across the pond from them.\n\nI wanted to find out what these kids knew and felt about Israel, but I really had no clear expectations about how the conversation would go. One session was with the oldest campers, and I have to say that I was so impressed with their thoughtfulness, and their level of care and knowledge of Israel. No one asked, “How does this relate to us?” or, “Why are we discussing Israel?”\n\nThe conversation included their counselors, many of whom happen to be Israeli. Camp Havaya, like many North American Jewish camps, employs counselors, specialists and educators through the Jewish Agency for Israel. They participate fully in camp life, teach Israeli and Jewish culture, and serve as role models for campers and staff. In 2023, 1,500 Shlichim worked at 158 camps across North America.\n\nThese Israeli counselors, as you might expect, themselves have different views about what is unfolding in Israel. They really helped me understand the complexities of the situation, and they gave me deeper insight as to why Israelis feel so deeply, one way or another, about what is going on. One young man likened the problem to other challenges Israel has faced in the past, and said that he wasn’t worried that the judicial overhaul would have a lasting impact on Israel. But most others disagreed. One counselor, in response, stated definitely, “If this bill passes, we can kiss Israel as a democracy goodbye.”\n\nJust so everyone is aware, ever since this current government formed in December 2022, there has been massive civil unrest in Israel. Every week this year, at the conclusion of Shabbat, Israelis of all stripes have poured into the streets of every major city and many smaller ones, protesting the judicial overhaul the government is pushing. Millions of people, from the religious to the secular, from activists and to those who never imagined they would attend a demonstration. Every week, continuously, for 39 weeks.\n\nMany Israelis feel that this crucial vote, that passed in late July, which strips the Israeli Supreme Court of certain powers, is just a first step in removing key checks and balances in the government, and would pave the way for the governing coalition — the most conservative and nationalist in Israel’s history — to create a more authoritarian and less pluralist society. The government and its supporters, on the other hand, say the change would enhance democracy by making elected lawmakers freer to enact what voters chose them to do. The dispute reflects a painful schism in Israeli society; arguably Israel’s biggest domestic crisis in its history.\n\nBut I share this conversation at Camp Havaya with you because of what happened next. One camper, herself about 15 years old, asked the Israeli counselor, “What can we do to support you?” And he answered, “Just having this conversation is so important. It shows that you care about what is happening in Israel. Israelis often feel alone in the world. Now I don’t feel so alone.” He said it was important that American Jews keep talking about what is happening in Israel, whether it is just trying to understand the issues or speaking out more broadly.\n\nSo no, this sermon is not about Israel. This sermon is about us – Am Yisrael, we, the people of Israel. There aren’t so many of us – about 7 million Jews in North America, another 7 million in Israel, and 1 million more worldwide. Yet we are so divided! Beyond the differences in language, culture, and religious practice, the ocean of misunderstanding around our values, our priorities, and our support for Israel is widening. That’s part of why the camp shlichim program is so important.\n\nI have been thinking a lot about Am Yisrael lately, especially after our beloved Rabbi Judy Abrahamson passed this summer. She was an ardent supporter of Israel, the country, and she and Martin visited Israel as often as they could. But I think she believed even more passionately in Am Yisrael. She was a consummate teacher, mentor, friend – a builder of Am Yisrael in every way. She would drop anything to help someone. It wasn’t just because she was a nice person, or had a giant heart, which she did. She saw it as her responsibility. She lived by the principle Kol Yisrael arevim zeh ba’zeh. All of Israel is responsible for one another. We are, more than a faith or religion, we Jews are a people who stand in solidarity with one another.\n\nI want to also state emphatically that Am Yisrael also includes anyone who throws their lot in with the Jewish people, whether you were raised Jewish or not, or whether or not you converted. You are a part of Am Yisrael if you count yourself as part of a Jewish family, if you stand with us during times of celebration or challenge.\n\nWe, as a nation, are borderless and boundless. We may not live in Medinat Yisrael, the modern State of Israel, but we are part of its diverse people, and what happens in Israel affects Jews worldwide, for better or for worse.\n\nWe also recognize, as Am Yisrael, that Eretz Yisrael, the ancient land of Israel, is our spiritual homeland. Eretz Yisrael is the Israel of the Bible, and it’s the Israel we yearn for in our prayers. Eretz Yisrael is distinct from Medinat Yisrael even though they share much of the same physical territory. Medinat Yisrael is the modern state of Israel, including its government, while Eretz Yisrael is thousands of years old, the land of Abraham and King David, the prophets, and the Holy Temple and its priestly caste. Eretz Yisrael is our holy land, just as Yom Kippur is our holiest day.\n\nOn Yom Kippur, in biblical times, the high priest would make expiation, meaning a holy reparation, for all of Am Yisrael. He would enter the holiest place in the Temple, known as the Holy of Holies, and utter God’s most holy name. So you can picture it – all the holiest parts of the world coming together to heal and strengthen that sacred connection between God and the world.\n\nSo this is why I come to you, on this most holy day, to suggest that we make a repair. We need to heal this divide within Am Yisrael. We need to figure out how to talk about Israel. And that is going to make a lot of people here, including myself, uncomfortable.\n\nYou know the saying – two Jews, three opinions. We have very strong opinions and deep feelings about Israel. One congregant told me, “I am liberal on just about every issue, but when it comes to Israel, I am more conservative and protective about Israel.” She is not alone in that sentiment. When we talk about Israel, we risk being at odds with one another about something most holy and precious to us that goes to the core of our identity as Jews.\n\nSome of you have shared with me that you feel that you don’t know enough about Israel to have an opinion. Some of you may feel angry about the choices of the Israeli government today. Still others feel uncomfortable voicing an opinion because we don’t live in Israel – we only see the headlines, we don’t experience the day-to-day joys and challenges of life in Israel.\n\nMany of us feel that Israel needs more defending and championing than it gets, especially considering what an absolute miracle it is that the modern State of Israel even exists and thrives as it does. Sadly, it is so often vilified in the press, on college campuses, and social media, and that Israel has become a soft target for antisemites.\n\nWell, I have many good things to say about Israel – an incredibly beautiful and holy homeland for world Jewry, a deeply rich and dynamic cultural center of Jewish life, and a place where I’ve been blessed to live four times in my lifetime, and to visit a few times more. I am excited to visit Israel again this winter, God willing, with my family. But I am not someone who thinks that Israel can do no wrong.\n\nThe State of Israel was created with certain ideals that in many ways it strives and fails to live up to. Israel’s Declaration of Independence proclaims that it shall “be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions,” and more. We as Am Yisrael need to hold Medinat Yisrael to that promise.\n\nAs Rabbi Beth Kalish shared with her congregation recently, “Israeli democracy is not perfect. Palestinian citizens of Israel live within the democratic structure of the state, but face systemic discrimination. Mizrachi Jews, whose families immigrated to Israel from other Middle Eastern countries, are still disadvantaged in Israeli society compared to Ashkenazi Jews, and Ethiopian Jews are the victims of racism. There is economic inequality in Israel, as well as sexism, bigotry, xenophobia, and religious extremism. And… Palestinians who live in the West Bank under Israeli occupation, who are not citizens of Israel, live without democratic rights and face indignities and suffering that we cannot continue to ignore. Standing for democracy in Israel should not mean working for a return to the prior status quo, but working instead toward a fuller expression of Israeli democracy.”\n\nAnd I agree. Much like the United States, another country I love, I offer my criticisms and opinions because I believe in it and I care about its people and its place in this world.\n\nAs countries go, Israel is very young. Some of us here can remember when Israel, surrounded by enemies, was fighting for its survival as a fledgling nation. Israel’s army and infrastructure have developed amazingly since those early years, with the help of the American Jewish community and the American government. As its economy stabilized, our concern centered on Israel’s safety and security. Do you know it has been exactly 50 years since the Yom Kippur War, and 30 years last week since the Oslo Accords were signed?\n\nBack in 1993, it was a lot easier to talk about Israel. It was a time of optimism and hope for peace. Imagine, an Israeli prime minister and a Palestinian leader shaking hands on the White House lawn!\n\nBut all that feeling came crashing down when that same prime minister, Yitzkhak Rabin, was assassinated on November 4, 1995, after a peace rally. That was one of the moments that I remember exactly where I was when I heard. And his killer was a fellow Israeli, a religious zealot who some called a hero.\n\nReflecting on that moment, and the one Israel is facing now, I can say that it is extremism and divisions within our own people, not external attacks, that are our greatest threats to Israel’s existence\n\nIsrael’s president, Isaac Herzog, has warned that the current schism could lead to civil war. This controversial bill has set off such chaos and pain because it is rooted in a far deeper rift among competing sections of Israeli society about what it means to be a Jewish state. Yedidia Stern, a law professor who was involved in last-minute efforts to broker a compromise between the opposition and the ruling coalition, told the NYTimes, “This is a symbol or manifestation of a major, deeper lack of trust between parts of Israeli society.” He described Israel as a country of four tribes: religious nationalists, ultra-Orthodox Jews, secular Jews and Arabs — the first two of which are now in power. Though allies, they do not share an identical agenda but collectively form a growing right-wing bloc that poses a challenge to the social groups that have long dominated Israel.\n\nAs part of that conversation at Camp Havaya, one Israeli counselor shared that, shortly before he was due to come to the US for camp, he was arrested after attending one of these demonstrations. He shared that the police were more violent than was warranted. He did not get into details in front of the campers, but he said that he feared that because of an increased sense of division and anger in the country, that there was less restraint in how the police were responding to the opposition. He pointed to the recent unprecedented level of settler attacks and abject violence on Arab villages in the West Bank.\n\nThese kinds of reports may make us uncomfortable, defensive, or angry. After all, he is just one voice, right? But that voice is naming a certain basic lack of trust, and that you will hear echoed from people from every political persuasion in Israel. How do you rebuild from that?\n\nWe need to listen to the pain of Israelis – not to offer advice, or criticism, but to listen and support. They are the other half of the beating heart that is Am Yisrael. This is a sacred opportunity to heal and come together.\n\nUnfortunately, the American Jewish community doesn’t have a great history in that department. We have avoided having those hard conversations about Israel – about Palestinians, its security situation, the Occupation. “American Jews have not developed the muscle that we now need to respond to this regime,” as Rabbi Sharon Brous, a Conservative rabbi who serves the community called IKAR in Los Angeles, put it. So now, we’re not sure exactly what to do.\n\nIn February, thee Israeli journalists Matti Friedman, Yossi Klein Halevi and Daniel Gordis, who often interpret and defend Israel’s actions for a mainstream, more conservative Zionist audience, wrote an unprecedented open letter in The Times of Israel pleading for American Jews to get involved before it’s too late, saying: “The changes afoot will have dire consequences for the solidarity of Israel’s society… None of us is an alarmist. But this is a moment for alarm.”\n\nWe need to exercise the Israel muscle, if not for the sake of Medinat Yisrael, but for the sake of Am Yisrael. Because what happens in Israel directly impacts Jews worldwide. You can see it, tragically, in the rise of anti-semitism, which is well documented by the Anti-Defamation League and other organizations. Am Yisrael is stronger when Medinat Israel is secure and at peace. When Israel is weaker, more isolated and vulnerable, regardless of who you might say is to blame, the diaspora Jewish community is more vulnerable as well.\n\nWe have sinned. Al chet she’chatanu lifanecha. We have turned the other way. We have remained silent. We have claimed helplessness. We have played the blame game. We have stated we have no partner for peace when in truth we ourselves never sought out a partner. We have gotten defensive, and we have not bothered to hear the other side of the story. We have disengaged, we have not visited Israel, nor have we reached out to Israelis to offer our support. We have not educated ourselves or our children, and we have not faced uncomfortable truths about Israel’s history and its present circumstances.\n\nAnd, I have sinned. As your rabbi, I haven’t pushed us to have difficult conversations as well as I could have. Why? Because it’s hard and tricky and emotional. And, because I haven’t wanted to risk hurting any of you and causing discomfort or shame.\n\nBut, you know, a little shame isn’t so bad! The feeling of shame, or boosha, is a wake up call to our conscience. Rabbi Angela Buchdahl recently gave a Rosh haShana sermon about this very topic, teaching that, “We feel [shame] when we recognize we are not living up to our ideals. And, if you take the Hebrew root letters of Boosha: Bet-Vav-Shin, and reverse them, they spell SHUV – RETURN.” We certainly need to move beyond shame in order to truly make a change.\n\nIf American Jews don’t figure out how to champion the ideals that Israel represents and how to lovingly hold Israel accountable to them, then do we know how to respond to criticisms about Israel from outside the Jewish community, or to anti-Semitic threats?\n\nIt doesn’t matter where in the political spectrum you are, or whether you approve of the current Israeli government or not. They are doing what they are doing in your name, in the name of all of the Israels. We need to reclaim our moral voice with regard to Israel.\n\nAs liberal American Jews, we have a lot of power when it comes to Israel, but we aren’t used to flexing it. We can voice our concern to American Jewish organizations that speak on our behalf, like our local Federation, AIPAC, JStreet, and the Jewish Council for Public Affairs.\n\nWe also need to support organizations in Israel that support our values – pluralism, democracy, diversity, equal rights, and human rights. This is not a time to be silent or remain neutral.\n\nMost of all, don’t give up. The situation is complicated, but stay engaged, ask questions, begin conversations, invite speakers. And when the discussion becomes heated, get quiet and listen.\n\nWe are all responsible for one another, Kol Yisrael arevim ze bazeh. This is stated in the Talmud, Tractate Shevuot 39a, in a discussion of the domino effect of sin. If one Jew sees another Jew at the verge of sinning, they have an obligation to step in and help. This phrase is the basis of the notion of communal responsibility in Jewish law.\n\nWe are inextricably connected, in challenging but also beautiful ways. THe nation of Israel is not defined by its land or geographic boundaries – it is defined by its people.\n\nToday our people are scattered throughout the world. But, on Yom Kippur, when we remember our Temple and the High Priest making atonement for all of us, we return to the knowledge that we are one people, Am Yisrael, each of us imperfect, but together whole.\n\nGmar chatima tova – may we be sealed for goodness in the New Year.\n\nRosh HaShana Sermon 5784\n\nSometime in late spring of 2018, I received a call from Elissa Gruenberg. Some of you may know her; she is the wife of Rabbi Josh Gruenberg, who used to serve Beth El, around the corner from us. They were moving, and so they were getting rid of a lot of stuff. “I have the Barbie motherload, and I’m coming over,” she said. It was not a question. Ten minutes later, we were blessed with over 40 Barbie dolls of all varieties and conditions, including some Kens, an enormous pile of Barbie clothing, shoes, and accessories, Barbie cars, and of course, a Barbie Dream House complete with furniture. Thank God for our large unfinished basement. Until that point, we had 0 Barbies in the house, and there was a reason for that.\n\nI grew up with Barbies and loved them. I had my assorted Barbies marry my one Ken doll countless times. As I grew up, of course, I dispensed with dolls in favor of feminist literature. I viewed Barbie critically. Sure, she was the first mature, adult doll girls could play with where we didn’t have to play the part of mommy to our baby doll, and she had beautiful, fashionable clothes that reflected her varied hobbies and ambitions. But her body was frightfully, unrealistically skinny and her features too perfect. I rejected the impossible standard of beauty Barbie represented, and resolved that none of my kids would own them.\n\nFast forward to summer 2023. Not only did I see the Barbie movie in the theater, but I took my husband, my parents, our au pair Bea, and my three impressionable daughters to see it with me. On my birthday. As a proud Smith College alumna, I had been hearing about the Barbie movie through all my Seven Sisters women’s college channels. People were raving about the director, Greta Gerwig, a graduate of Barnard, and what she was creating in the Barbie movie. Fully aware of the love/hate relationship that many girls and women have for Barbie, she incorporates the movie around this conflict, creating a Barbie world vs a Real world. I went into the theater knowing that I would be seeing an unapologetically feminist movie.\n\nIt’s Rosh haShana, the birthday of the creation of all worlds, so I don’t mind telling you that Gerwig completely flips the Genesis narrative on its head, creating a Barbie world that women run. Whereas it states in the book of Genesis, “The Lord God said, “It is not good for man to be alone; I will make a fitting helper for him… He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that spot. And the Lord God fashioned the rib that He had taken from the man into a woman; and He brought her to the man,” here, in this beginning, Barbie, in her pink, perfectly happy Barbie world, is fully empowered, and Ken is the one born of Barbie’s flesh. He is the definition of a sidekick, without an identity independent of her. It is as if Mattel, the toy company that produces the doll and serves as a kind of villain in the film, had said two years after making Barbie, “It is not good for Barbie to be alone; I will make a fitting helper for her.”\n\nIf you haven’t yet seen the movie, by the way, this rabbi thinks it’s worth your while. I don’t think there will be any true spoilers this morning, but if there are, I will atone for them on Yom Kippur.\n\nTruly, this movie is wild and wonderful retelling of the Creation story, with Barbie and Ken booted from their bubble gum Garden of Eden to grapple with the apparent brokenness of the Real World, which include patriarchy, objectification, and sullen Bratz doll type girls who think Barbie is the root of their problems. In this world, women and girls have put their Barbie dolls away because in so many ways, the Barbie ideal is dated and problematic, tone deaf to the messiness of the actual embodied world.\n\nIt is hilarious, and heartbreaking at times, to see Barbie and Ken grapple with the revelation that, in this Real World, men appear to run the show. As they learn about the patriarchy, the viewers are taken through all the different stages and waves of feminism. But, none of this was new to me. What I wasn’t expecting was for Barbie to have an existential crisis about being, of all things, human.\n\nThe professor Brendan Myers wrote that “At the beginning of the film, Barbie is an object. She’s so perfect, that she isn’t even interesting… And Ken is an object, too: in fact he wants to be an object, for as the narrator tells us he feels entirely unfulfilled unless Barbie is looking at him. And then, Barbie drops the existential question: “Any of you guys ever think about dying?”\n\nThat, for me, is when things got interesting. Because, you see, as Barbie evolves, it becomes clear that the movie is not about the patriarchy or the war of the sexes, it is about the messiness and beauty of being human.\n\nBut why would Barbie, the living embodiment of perfection, want to be human?\n\nThroughout the movie, this main Barbie is called Stereotypical Barbie, and somehow, over the course of the movie, she feels she no longer fits into a stereotype or a particular narrow idea. “I’m not really sure where I belong anymore,” Barbie says to Ruth Handler, the little Jewish woman who created the Barbie doll. Ruth is the closest thing Barbie has to a mother. Indeed, she is her creator. Barbie asks Ruth, essentially, “Who am I? What is my purpose? What now?” Barbie is seeking a purpose of her own; she has grown beyond someone else’s perception of her.\n\nIt is a poignant moment that we as humans might relate to when we experience growth or transition. Perhaps we want something different for our lives than what our parents want for us. Perhaps we thought we would be happy in this job or that relationship, but it isn’t what we thought it would be, or perhaps we have changed. Being human is surprising, as we try to meet the future as it unfolds, only to find out we are different from who we used to be. As we evolve, we might question our purpose. What our next steps should be are anything but clear. But herein lies the blessing.\n\nPirkei Avot, the rabbinic text Ethics of the Fathers, in chapter 4, mishnah 3 tells us, “Do not disparage anyone, and do not shun anything. For you have no person who does not have their hour, and you have no thing that does not have its place.” Let’s take this opportunity, at this head of the year, to invite in the uncertainty, the messiness, some would say the pregnancy of this moment. Let us grant ourselves the gift of some space at this juncture in our lives to each consider: What was I made for? What is my place now?\n\nIn the movie, Billie Eilish sings:\n\nI used to float, now I just fall down\n\nI used to know but I’m not sure now\n\nWhat I was made for\n\nWhat was I made for?\n\nWhat is it that makes someone human? Is it that we have feelings, are mortal, have memory? That we have a sense of selfhood apart from others’ perceptions of us, that we have hopes/dreams?\n\nAs humans, we are made of feelings. We often live in our mind and heart. About experiencing humanity, Ruth says to Barbie: “Take my hand, close your eyes. Now, feel.” Close your eyes, she says, because it isn’t in the seeing that we experience being human; it is in the feeling. The joy, the pain of loss, even confusion.\n\nIt strikes me that being human is to have an internal experience no one else can fully know.\n\nRabbi Joy Ladin, one of the first out transgender rabbis, shared with Krista Tippett, the producer of the NPR show On Being, in an interview some years ago, her experience of not growing up as female, reflecting that, “one of the terrible things that we do to girls and women in this culture is that we stare at them. It’s also terrible to not be seen. The artifact of femininity, of attractiveness, of what we judge when we judge girls and women beautiful, often, I think, don’t feel to girls and women like they’re being seen as who they are.”\n\nFor Joy Ladin, gender was a lens through which she was able to forge an identity and be seen for who she truly was and that is why she finally transitioned in her mid-40s. She shared, “In early transition, it feels like you have no skin at all. There’s nothing between you and the world. There is no sense of identity… You are who you are seen as being, which is pretty hard to live through. But at those moments, I thought, “Oh, my God, you’re seeing me; I’m not monstrous.” Through her transition, she was able to express her inner self in a visible, physical form.\n\nAs I age, I feel myself being released from that “artifact of femininity” and I allow myself to experience my own inner world, my feelings, as what is beautiful. Experiencing our humanity means going within and appreciating the beauty that no one can see but yourself, to be in touch with the spark of the divine within you, from which you were created.\n\nSo, this Rosh haShana, close your eyes and ask yourself, “What is the beauty within you? What makes you feel truly alive?”\n\n‘Cause I, I\n\nI don’t know how to feel\n\nBut I wanna try\n\nI don’t know how to feel\n\nBut someday, I might\n\nSomeday, I might\n\nThere is a loneliness in being human, especially as no one can truly know our inner experience. So, another essential part of being human is in the striving to share who we are and to see others as they are.\n\nThe Jewish theologian Martin Buber, called this sacred kind of relating the “I-Thou” connection. He described the necessary, superficial transactional interactions we must have every day with people out in the world as “I-It” connections, but I-Thou meetings were for him the most important aspect of human experience. “All real living is meeting” he would say. When one meets another as Thou, the uniqueness and separateness of the other is acknowledged without obscuring the relatedness or common humanness that is shared.\n\nIt is such a relief when you feel that someone sees you in a way that isn’t some kind of projection, but as Rabbi Joy Ladin described, is actually more like a mirror, reflecting the beauty of yourself back to you. We are blessed to have the kind of connections where you feel your soul connects with another in a way that you feel understood, appreciated, and seen.\n\nAnd, a central human need is in being able to share that spiritual connection from one generation to the next. Ruth says to Barbie: “We mothers stand still, so our daughters can look back to see how far they’ve come.” That might be the movie’s most profound and poignant line.\n\nIn parenting, our lives are not our own. Our lives function to a degree in raising up our children, and to the extent that is true, we must stand still, we must contract to give the next generation room to become.\n\nBut even so, we have a frightening amount of power in shaping the next generation. That is a sermon unto itself. But as I get older, and have the blessing of being perhaps a less tortured soul than I was in my youth, I see that my life is much more about sharing wisdom and perspective I’ve gleaned over time and the connections I can forge across different generations. Human life is finite, but the relationships we can build and the influence we can have is truly infinite.\n\nRabbi Joy Ladin shared that as she emerged from her gender transition and felt a certain wholeness of self, only then was she really to serve God, where she voluntarily felt, “You know what [God]? You’ve given me so much. What can I do for you?”\n\nThis Rosh haShana, we might ask ourselves, “How can I be of service? What particular wisdom do I have to offer?”\n\nAnd, while we are so much the products of our families and our history, I’ve come to realize that a third key aspect of being human is in the power and potential of getting to write our own story.\n\nBarbie tells Ruth: “I want to do the imagining; I don’t want to be the idea.”\n\nIdeas are intoxicating. To live in a world of ideas takes us out of our bodies; takes us beyond and away from the present moment. We might think that if we can harness ourselves to ideas, we might escape our failures and our decrepitude – our aging bodies, cellulite, warts, disease, weakness and fatigue, not to mention the many emotions that feel at times completely out of our control.\n\nBut we, you and I, we are ultimately not ideas. We are bodies. We are born, and we die. “Ideas live forever, humans not so much,” Ruth warns Barbie.\n\nTakin’ a drive, I was an ideal\n\nLooked so alive, turns out I’m not real\n\nJust something you paid for\n\nWhat was I made for?\n\nWe are not toys. A toy is molded by someone else, it is a product of someone’s creative vision. Once it is fashioned, it is finished. Although we can change its clothes or imagine different roles for it, it does not age and it does not die. A toy is an idea – eternal, unchanging, exactly opposite of what a human is. But it’s “worse” than that – a toy is an idealized version of a human that then actual humans, impressionable girls, measure ourselves against. It can have a huge impact on society, as we have seen with the Barbie doll. How can you compete with an object that is made to be perfect?\n\nWe are inundated with images of perfection. On television, with competitions that are all about being the best. On social media, which is full of posts portraying our lives as shining, happy, and perfect, showing none of the ugly. In our professions and in school, our work product must be impeccable. The skill of being “merely human” is becoming a lost art. But mistakes are always possible because we are not perfect.\n\nAnd that is a blessing! Where there is perfection, there is no room for growth. I believe we were created purposefully as perfectly imperfect, so that we could learn and evolve over a lifetime. We need only look to the creation story of the Garden of Eden, when Adam and Eve immediately make a mistake and reap the consequences. The whole of Genesis is a lesson in human imperfection and striving.\n\nWhile we can’t undo our past, and we can’t control how the present may unfold, we do have the ability to shape how we might understand a particular experience, and that is through the story we tell about ourselves. If you are interested in how our stories can be healing and redemptive, I invite you to attend Dr. Molly Collins’ discussion session on Yom Kippur afternoon.\n\nAnd I have to say, this might be what I love most about this holiday of Rosh haShana, and about Judaism as a whole: that we can choose how we move forward. This is the art of becoming human.\n\nAnd further, we are responsible. It’s not just a choice; we are on the hook. As it states in Torah, but is more clearly spelled out in later rabbinic writings, God created us as partners in the ongoing work of creation. The Jewish God is not a toy maker who simply wants to play with his toys, or a puppeteer who directs our every move; God needs us to be actively and freely engaged in the work of creation.\n\nThis is the bittersweet, poignant irony of being human – though we age and ultimately pass away, while we are here we as humans get to be creators. And as such, we have the ability to recreate ourselves thoughtfully, courageously, compassionately. There is such power and incalculable value in our finite lives. In the words of the poet Mary Oliver: What is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?\n\nThis Rosh haShana, we might take some time to reflect on this central question: What were you made for? What were you brought here to do?\n\n‘Cause I, I\n\nI don’t know how to feel\n\nBut I wanna try\n\nI don’t know how to feel\n\nBut someday, I might\n\nSomeday, I might\n\nI reflect on what I do as a rabbi, what it is we are trying to create together as Kol Emet. I think about myself as a mother, raising my three kids in a world whose future is quite uncertain as the planet warms. As they take their Barbie toys out and dust off the Dreamhouse brought up from the basement, how do I prepare them for this world that is emerging? And, as a 40 something woman whose hair is turning to silver and as wrinkles gather around my lips and eyes, I wonder: am I doing what I was brought here to do? Am I using this one precious body with wisdom and gratitude, to build relationships, to love fully, to bring joy and healing to this super messy world?\n\nAs we begin 5784 I hope we can spend some time, as Barbie does, familiarizing ourselves anew with the equal pain and exquisiteness of becoming human. May this awareness soften us, and shape us into more forgiving and more compassionate, humane human beings. May we consider what is truly important, and let it give us focus and courage.\n\nShana Tova u’Metuka – May it be a good and sweet year.\n\n“Thoughts and Prayers and the Cries of the Heart”\n\nWhen I think about what I might write about for the High Holidays, I ask myself, “What is the sermon I need to hear right now?” Another question might be, “what do you, this congregation, need to hear?” But my thinking is one, that I must speak from my heart. And, also that perhaps what I am wrestling with, you are too.\n\nIt might surprise you to know that I struggle with prayer. Yes, as a rabbi, I probably approach prayer differently than a Jew in the pew. Stating the obvious, I do it for a living. But I love Hebrew, the language of prayer and of Torah – I love its cadence and its structure. There are certain prayers that are etched in my mind and heart, that connect me to places and people and feelings, because prayer has been a part of me my whole life in different ways. I also find great comfort in services, in a community of worshippers, in having a minyan there that holds one’s sorrows and joys. At Thursday morning minyan, we grieve together when a name goes from the mi shebayrach list to the list of names I recite before Kaddish. And, recently we rejoiced when someone who had been saying family members names for the mi shebayrach prayer for years didn’t need to say them any more. There is no question that my prayers are a comfort and a balm, and a link to community and the Jewish people.\n\nBut, lately, that has not been enough for me. I have become uncomfortable with prayers that are just comforting. I wonder, how do my prayers affect me, change me, change the world? I have spent a lot of time making ancient prayer more accessible to us modern Jews. But I worry that we’ll leave here today thinking, ok, we’ve prayed, now we’ve done enough to wipe the slate clean.\n\nI think we are all too familiar with the phrase “thoughts and prayers” which has become, for me and for many of us, I think, hollow and goading. Offering one’s sympathy, one’s attention and compassion is an appropriate response to a natural disaster, like a tornado or hurricane. Like the devastation that Hurricane Ian wrought, for example. Offering our prayers is a way to express care, even if we are unable to offer any other support.\n\nBut we know that is not the only way this phrase has been deployed. I remember it first being used in 1999, after the school shooting in Columbine Colorado. That was the year after I graduated college, my first year living in Philadelphia. But now my entire adult life has been full of mass shootings, many in schools, but also in workplaces, in malls, on the streets, and in places of worship. There have been several just this past week, one notably at a Philadelphia school in which a 14 year old was killed. There are too many to keep track of, too many to offer thoughts and prayers for, and not much else.\n\nI am no stranger to gun violence and death, and I imagine, after so many years of this, you must be too. I was a student in Israel in 2002 when two of my fellow classmates were killed in an act of terrorism at Hebrew University. My friend Gali, who I knew from that time in Israel, lost her father Rami Cooks in 2012 in a mass shooting at his place of business in Minneapolis in which four others were also killed, just a year after I danced with them at Gali’s wedding. He died a hero defending his coworkers from a disgruntled employee. It was the day after Yom Kippur. And, as many of you know, I lost my dear friend Jerry Rabinowitz in the Tree of Life shooting almost 4 years ago, as he was heading toward the sounds of gunshots in an effort to help others in the synagogue. And now, as a parent of three precious kids who have attended public school since last year, I am scared and heartsick and angry on a whole new level.\n\nOn Yom Kippur we pay heed to the martyrs and heroes who have died in defense of their faith. Traditionally we invoke their names and the horrors they withstood to make us think about our own sense of faith and our convictions while we are alive. But where is our faith? What do we believe?\n\nWe call people like Jerry and Rami heroes, but for what cause? Do their deaths spur us to act, so that our country will be safer, so that our kids will be more protected from gun violence? Rami and Jerry were not martyrs for any cause – they were simply in their places of worship and business, where they were supposed to be. They were not sticking their necks out – they were simply being decent human beings. They should have been safe. Just like children in school should be safe.\n\nJust saying that last line is surreal. I remember thinking in 2012 that after Sandy Hook, things would have to change. But here we are ten years later, and in Uvalde Texas 19 children and 2 educators were murdered in their classroom by a gunman who legally bought $2K of guns, ammunition, and explosives on his 18th birthday two weeks earlier. Why? How? And why is the only thing people can offer in response are “thoughts and prayers?”\n\nNow don’t get me wrong – I’m pro-prayer. But when it is used as a cover for inaction, then prayer itself is sullied. And people, understandably, are turned off from prayer and religion.\n\nOne popular Facebook post said recently, “Prayers are dangerous. Prayers are a way for people to convince themselves they’ve done something when they’ve actually done nothing. Prayers seem to absolve people from taking responsibility of demanding change… Prayers ensure that the problem will persist.”\n\nI think that post is actually a theologically astute critique. Prayer that blesses the status quo and doesn’t lead to individual and social transformation is hypocritical, and it should be called out for what it is.\n\nThe prophets of the second Temple period called out the hypocrisy of those who came before God with their supplications, but who go out into the world and are not good neighbors or are ethical in business.\n\nThe prophet Amos said,\n\nI loathe, I spurn your festivals,\n\nI am not appeased by your solemn assemblies.\n\n..Spare Me the sound of your hymns,\n\nAnd let Me not hear the music of your lutes.\n\nBut let justice roll down like waters,\n\nand righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.\n\nWe have been witness to so many terrible injustices in this country, and it has taken a heavy toll on our energy, our spirit, and our faith. A warming planet, pandemic, systemic racism and white nationalism, economic uncertainty, the specter of war. What kind of world are we leaving for our children? To witness the magnitude of the problems and the suffering invokes dreadful feelings of helplessness. Moreover, these problems did not manifest themselves overnight; they are born of decades of festering inaction. It’s not just helplessness; we live with a deficit of hope.\n\nWe have become numb, and that is completely understandable. Sometimes it feels like the most we can do is to offer thoughts and prayers.\n\nBut I’d like us to do better than that. I am grateful we have holidays like Rosh haShana and Yom Kippur to encourage us to self-reflect and take a hard look at ourselves and how we got here. We release the empty, false vows we couldn’t keep with Kol Nidre, we confess our sins collectively as we sing Al Chet, and spend the day limiting the physical needs and desires of our bodies so we can focus on the cries of our hearts. And the Haftarah of Yom Kippur from Isaiah, expressly calls out both our hypocrisy and our sense of overwhelm.\n\nAnd God said:\n\nOpen up, open up, Clear a path!\n\nClear away all obstacles\n\nFrom the path of My People!…\n\nFor your sin of greed\n\nI grew angry and smashed you,\n\nI even hid My face.\n\nYet you wander off the path as your own heart,\n\nwayward, takes you.\n\nI see the path you need —- and I will heal you…\n\nHas God been hiding God’s face from us? If so, where can we find the face of God in this troubled world, peering out, waiting for us to seek God out? How do we get out of this hopelessness, and wake up to life again?\n\nOur Haftarah calls, “Cry out aloud, don’t hold back, Lift up your voice like the shofar!” But how do we do that? And what good would it do anyway?\n\nPerhaps we need a reset conversation on prayer, because I think that when Jews say prayer, we might think of all the ancient Hebrew prayers in the prayer book that are scripted and ordered and recited at particular times of the day and year. I want to explore more the function of prayer – what true praying should be and do.\n\nThe great exemplar of the prayer-cry is Moses. In the Deuteronomy 3:1, he beseeches God to let him enter the Land of Israel, after God decrees that as a consequence for a seemingly minor infraction, he will not be able to enter the Land with his people, who Moses has guided through the wilderness for 40 years. Now, Moses was our greatest leader and teacher, the one who spoke to God panim el panim – face to face; the one who had a relationship with God like no other. And his heartfelt, poignant prayer request is denied. Repeatedly!\n\nAnd here, I think Moses’ prayer is instructive: prayer isn’t about asking for something, and thinking you’ll get your wish. The early rabbis of the Talmud were amazed: they exclaim how if Moses of all people, being righteous in so many ways doesn’t get his prayer, then who can!\n\nThey then declare: “There are ten terms which can denote prayer, and they are: צעקה, נאקה, רנה, פגיעה,” ביצור, קריאה, נפול, ופילול, ותחנונים שועה” that is: tears, outcry, moaning, song, pleading, seeking refuge, calling out for comfort, falling down, seeking judgment, supplication.\n\nNotice that few of those descriptions are particularly happy, or connote a comfortable experience. The great 20th century Orthodox rabbi and theologian, Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits writes that, “In its original form, prayer is not asking God for anything; it is not a request. It is a cry; an elementary outburst of woe, a spontaneous call in need; a hurt, a sorrow, given voice…. It is not asking, but coming with one’s burden before God. To pray means to make God the confidant of one’s sorrow and need.”\n\nTaylor McFarlan Miller, a devout Christian and a survivor of a college shooting, writes in her book, When Thoughts and Prayers Aren’t Enough, that she never thought of leaving God or religion. In fact, God was the One who she cried to and yelled at. “I never had to become so intimately close to the God who bottles my tears and binds my wounds. After the shooting, I had to confront God with a lot of questions and doubts and fears. And he met me in every single one. I learned that God is still God when the healing doesn’t come, when the nightmares don’t go away and the prayers are answered in ways you didn’t ask for.”\n\nBut what if you don’t have a personal relationship with God or even believe in God? It can feel pointless or silly to pray when one does not have a sense that anyone is listening and responding. But I don’t think that should stop a person from really praying.\n\nMuch of traditional liturgy, however beautiful its imagery, reflects a theology of an all powerful God, a King, who can make miracles and can even raise a person from the dead. Now, I don’t believe in that kind of supernatural God, and I have had more than one person tell me that they actually prefer the prayers in Hebrew, because then at least they wouldn’t have to contend with their meaning! That kind of language can be an obstacle to prayer for someone who doesn’t share that belief.\n\nBut I don’t think our ancestors were primitive peasants who wrote prayers so literally. By that I mean that when we pray the Morning Blessings and thank God for making blind to see, I don’t think they actually believed that God magically makes blindness disappear anymore than God causes blindness. I don’t think they really believed God was actually some King in the clouds either. Rather, they used religious metaphors to invoke awe and wonder, to wake us up to the everyday miracles that happen in our lives everyday.\n\nMy teacher from RRC, Rabbi Jacob Staub, who came here to Kol Emet for my installation, writes movingly, “The answer to our prayers comes not from a supernatural God but from our own transformed hearts.” Put differently, prayer, it seems to me, isn’t about influencing God so God will change. Rather, prayer is about changing the one who prays.\n\nMost of us turn to prayer only when we are in pain or we want something. But if we exercise the prayer muscle when things are good, and even on the everyday, normal days when nothing spectacular is happening, we might realize that the good really outweighs the bad, that there are so many things to be grateful for, even amazed with.\n\nAnd, that, some would say this is in fact the most important thing, The great 20th century theologian and activist Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel famously wrote that “Our goal should be to live life in radical amazement, [to] get up in the morning and look at the world in a way that takes nothing for granted. Everything is phenomenal; everything is incredible; never treat life casually. To be spiritual is to be amazed.”\n\nPrayer makes us susceptible to becoming amazed and to live life with a sense of awe. Awe motivates people to do things that enhance the greater good, and that is a scientific fact. A 2015 study published in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that awe helps bind us to others, motivating us to act in collaborative ways that enable strong groups and cohesive communities. Participants in the study who reported experiencing more awe in their lives, who felt more regular wonder and beauty in the world around them, were shown to be more generous to the stranger, cooperated more, shared more resources and sacrificed more for others. Awe imbues people with a different sense of themselves, one that is smaller, more humble and part of something larger.\n\nWe live in an awe-deprived society. We spend more and more time working and commuting and less time outdoors and with other people. Attendance at arts events — live music, theater, museums and galleries — has dropped over the years. A broad societal shift that has been widely observed over the past 50 years: People have become more individualistic, more self-focused, more materialistic and less connected to others. We are a more divided society.\n\nTo reverse this trend, insist on experiencing more everyday awe: actively seek out what gives you hope and what gives you goose bumps, be it in looking at trees, the night sky, patterns of wind on water or witnessing the good of others — the teenage upstanders, the mitzvah-makers, the young child who explores the world in a state of wonder, the person who presses on against all odds.\n\nAnd pray – express it all, and don’t bottle it up; let God or other people hold your cries and prayers. Pray to feel and pray to live. Pray to be changed. Pray to change the world.\n\nWe must never accept that one mass shooting, one lost life, is ever okay. Our tradition teaches that “Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.”\n\nWe cannot bring back the lives stolen from us, but we do have power and agency to prevent further deaths. Even just one death, it’s a whole world. I think about the life of my beautiful friend Jerry, and I am in awe at the life he lived, the kindness he exuded, the lives he helped as a physician treating the elderly and those with AIDS, the ways he contributed to his community. I think about Rami Cooks, who left behind a beautiful, loving family, whose lives he still shapes. His daughter Gali and her wife Keren had a daughter a few years ago, whom they named after Rami. She was born on Rami’s birthday. Now that’s awesome.\n\nGun violence is taking so many lives every single year, with 40,000 deaths on average. After 3500 mass shootings in the last decade, and 27 school shootings this year, it is easy to slip into feelings of helplessness.\n\nThe influential lawyer Sherrilyn Ifill notes that feelings of helplessness benefit the status quo, and we need to resist that. She writes, there is a “concerted effort right now to convince you that “nothing can be done.” It is designed to make you give in to the exhaustion of this moment. Don’t believe it. It’s a lie. We have power if we mobilize it.”\n\nOn Yom Kippur, as we sit here today without finery, without food in our bellies, without the distractions of home and work, we are forced to lay down our excuses, our defenses, our accusations, even our laments. Our memories, our heart’s cries, our prayers are all we have.\n\nPrayer is the voice of our authentic response to life. And it is meaningless unless it does not lead not only to action, but also to ultimately take responsibility. When Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel was asked upon his return from the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights march with Dr. Martin Luther King, “Did you find time to pray?” He famously answered, “I prayed with my feet.”\n\nIndeed, that is the kind of prayer I seek. Put down that mahzor, if it holds you back. Let us pray with our feet, our hands, our voices. Let us use our pain and our awe to wake up to what is possible in ourselves and in the world.\n\nI’d like to close with a poem-prayer by Amanda Gorman, which she wrote after the shooting in Uvalde:\n\nEverything hurts,\n\nOur hearts shadowed and strange,\n\nMinds made muddied and mute.\n\nWe carry tragedy, terrifying and true.\n\nAnd yet none of it is new;\n\nWe knew it as home,\n\nAs horror,|\n\nAs heritage.\n\nEven our children\n\nCannot be children,\n\nCannot be.\n\nEverything hurts.\n\nIt’s a hard time to be alive,\n\nAnd even harder to stay that way.\n\nWe’re burdened to live out these days,\n\nWhile at the same time, blessed to outlive them.\n\nThis alarm is how we know\n\nWe must be altered —\n\nThat we must differ or die,\n\nThat we must triumph or try.\n\nThus while hate cannot be terminated,\n\nIt can be transformed\n\nInto a love that lets us live.\n\nMay we not just grieve, but give:\n\nMay we not just ache, but act;\n\nMay our signed right to bear arms\n\nNever blind our sight from shared harm;\n\nMay we choose our children over chaos.\n\nMay another innocent never be lost.\n\nMaybe everything hurts,\n\nOur hearts shadowed & strange.\n\nBut only when everything hurts\n\nMay everything change.\n\nOn Abortion and the Mystery of Life\n\nI recently went to get my pre-Rosh haShana haircut, and my hairdresser, who is a devout Catholic, was very excited to see me. She sees it as a good omen when I am on her schedule. We talk about a few things, our families, the royal family, and then she asks, “So, what are you talking about for the High Holidays?” I hesitate, not knowing how she is going to react. “Abortion.” I say. “Great!” she says enthusiastically. “Why, great?” I ask. She says, “Well, if you can’t talk about it, who can?”\n\nSo that’s what I am going to talk about today, I guess! And here is why I think it’s proper and important to discuss it today, in synagogue, on Rosh haShana, the birthday of the world, in case you aren’t my Catholic hairdresser and are wondering. Abortion is a religious issue, and one we avoid talking about because it’s become a political issue too. I’m glad that we as a congregation will be talking about further in a few weeks, to learn a bit more about the Jewish textual sources that underpin our current and historical attitudes concerning abortion.\n\nBut our texts, laws, and history are just part of what makes it a religious issue. Religion comes into play whenever we talk about the meaning of life and its mysteries. How did this world come to be? When does life begin, and when does it end? Why is each creature and indeed every creation on this Earth unique, even ones that share the exact same DNA? Is there a soul? What is our purpose in the short amount of time we are granted on this earth? These are fundamentally religious and spiritual questions and in particular, these are the questions we ask during Rosh haShana, when our liturgy declares, “Hayom harat olam – Today the world (or eternity) was conceived.”\n\nOne of the main functions of religion is to encourage us to find meaning in the liminal places. Liminal is an adjective from the Latin that literally means, “on the threshold.” It is that transitional, ambiguous space that can often make people feel scared or vulnerable. The moment of death is certainly a liminal space, but so it is birth. Beginnings are fraught with uncertainty, like starting a new year. The liminal place can be a place of transformation if we are able to open to it – to explore, wonder, and be curious.\n\nReligion seeks to imbue us with a sense of wonder about those liminal moments. On Rosh haShana, we tell the story of the creation of the world. And this is the way our Torah begins, “Breishit bara Elohim” – “In the beginning, when God began to create…” Everything was tohu v’vohu, a jumbled mix, and God came and created order from chaos, discerned darkness from light, day from night, sky from earth, and earth from water. And God created life in its incredibly diverse forms and said “it is good.” And that culminated in the creation of human beings, b’tzelem Elohim, in the image of God.\n\nEvery religion has its account of what happened in the beginning, how the world came into being. But I don’t believe the Torah comes to tell us what actually happened, or to explain away the mystery. Rather, I find that the more one studies the text, the more mystery and ambiguity one finds. Were days then like days now? Was there a kind of big bang?\n\nA religious person is drawn into mystery, and to marvel at the mystery of life and its origins. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, the great 20th century prophet and activist wrote about the proper function of religion: “It is not utility that we seek in religion, but eternity. The criterion of religion is not in its being in agreement with our common sense but in its being compatible with our sense of the ineffable.”\n\nI am aware that for others, religion is where they come for concrete answers to life’s big questions and where they find a sense of certainty in a very uncertain and fast-paced world. But for me, the function of Judaism and religion as a whole is not to build walls of certainty; rather, through Torah, it provides us with a mirror with which to reflect and look deep within the self and in humanity as a whole.\n\nTake the story that we are reading today for Rosh haShana – the traditional telling of the birth of Isaac after Sarah, having given up on ever becoming a mother, becomes pregnant in her old age. Subsequently, Sarah convinces Abraham to banish Hagar, the maidservant Sarah gave to Abraham to procreate with so that he would have an heir with whom to build a nation as God promised. Now Sarah has a son, she feels threatened by Hagar and her son Ishmael, who is older than Isaac.\n\nThere are many ways to read this story, as you have heard me share over the course of many years and many Rosh haShanas! And this year, I see an enslaved woman, whose very name Hagar means “foreigner,” forced to lie with Abraham and then to give birth. She is not given any choice in the matter. Just look at the verbs that get used in the process of her son Ishmael’s conception:\n\nוַתִּקַּ֞ח שָׂרַ֣י אֵֽשֶׁת־אַבְרָ֗ם אֶת־הָגָ֤ר הַמִּצְרִית֙ שִׁפְחָתָ֔הּ מִקֵּץ֙ עֶ֣שֶׂר שָׁנִ֔ים לְשֶׁ֥בֶת אַבְרָ֖ם בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן וַתִּתֵּ֥ן אֹתָ֛הּ לְאַבְרָ֥ם אִישָׁ֖הּ ל֥וֹ לְאִשָּֽׁה׃\n\nSo Sarai, Abram’s wife, took her enslaved-woman, Hagar the Egyptian—after Abram had dwelt in the land of Canaan ten years—and gave her to her husband Abram as wife.\n\nShe is taken, and she is given – she is not asked, and she has no agency in the matter. Then, when we see Hagar and Ishmael pushed out into the wilderness because Sarah does not want Ishmael to share an inheritance with Isaac she again has no voice, choice, agency. We see Abraham give her a bit of food and water and send her out into the wilderness with no recourse, no means of survival, no way to save her son.\n\nYou could say this is “just” an interpretation, but we always read scripture through the lens of our lives and our concerns. Enslaved Black people in colonial America read the theology of liberation in the story of the Exodus from Egypt, just as Jews persecuted in medieval Europe read Abraham as a model of absolute faith in the face of crisis.\n\nToday, as a Jewish woman in a post-Roe America, I see both Hagar and Sarah as women without full personal bodily autonomy fighting each other for supremacy in a world where only men have power and agency. Of course, in a biblical patriarchal society this is assumed, but from my vantage point it is poignant and painful to see echoes of their drama still playing out today, even though ostensibly we live in a very different kind of society.\n\nI see women today facing immense pressure and also quietly struggling to become pregnant, and it is not uncommon. I see women and girls becoming pregnant when it wasn’t their choice, and facing immense social stigma. I see people of color shamed for having many children, and then also shamed for wanting to limit their family size. I see women and couples suffering through miscarriage and stillbirth, not knowing how to handle their grief or even understand their feelings.\n\nJosh and I tried for years to become parents. Getting pregnant for us wasn’t the hard part – it was the staying pregnant part. We suffered several miscarriages before conceiving our oldest child, who is now ten. And we suffered through more miscarriages after her birth as well. One time, the last time, I suffered what is called a “missed miscarriage” where the pregnancy was no longer viable after a certain point, but weeks later, my body hadn’t receive that message.\n\nWaiting for a miscarriage to happen naturally when you know your pregnancy isn’t viable can take an emotional toll. And, if the miscarriage doesn’t happen spontaneously, or it happens but incompletely, it can be a dangerous situation for the pregnant person. So what is the treatment for an early miscarriage? You could take a pill, which causes your body to miscarry over the course of a few days, but this can be in the comfort of your home. There is also an outpatient procedure to surgically remove the pregnancy, known as a “D&C.” We chose to have a D&C, because we didn’t want to prolong our grief a minute longer, and so too our healing.\n\nA D&C is a common and necessary procedure, since as many as one quarter of pregnancies result in miscarriage, and a missed miscarriage is also common. But that procedure has become a political hot potato, because about 90% of early abortions are performed using this procedure. Doctors now worry whether they will be under scrutiny for recommending or performing any D&C. A missed miscarriage is just one of a thousand different healthcare scenarios where a D&C might be considered as part of a person’s care. And now, with every state having different laws and those laws being challenged, in-flux, and misunderstood, there is fear, confusion, and despair.\n\nNow, my story is not unique or remarkable. But it was a very emotionally difficult decision for us to make. And now I realize how very fortunate and privileged I was – to have a loving and supportive spouse, to be gainfully employed, and to be able to have a D&C as an affordable option not far from my home and to receive full and accurate healthcare information and advice. Even back then, a few years ago, as I bounced around from clinics and offices in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, I could see an enormous difference in care based on the laws of the particular state.\n\nReading of Hagar’s exile and how she cries out to God, in some ways I feel that tragically not much has changed. Hagar, the maidservant, gives voice to the people who are impacted most, harmed most, even if their stories are not told, even if they do not make the media as much. These are Black, Indigenous, people of color, immigrants, youth, people in rural communities, those living below the poverty line; they are trans and nonbinary people.\n\nAbortion access is about the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities. This is a basic human right. The physical, spiritual and emotional burden that comes as part of the amazing ability to grow a human in one’s body that should be able to be shared by one’s community, one’s family, one’s doctor, and one’s God. It should not be made heavier by societal stigma and shame or frankly misogynistic laws that liken necessary, medically and emotionally time-sensitive healthcare to murder.\n\nI do realize that for those on the religious right, abortion is a huge issue. And they are very vocal about it because they believe that life begins at conception and stopping the development of a pregnancy is murder. And they have every right to be vocal, if they do it legally.\n\n(It must also be said that Christians hold a multiplicity of attitudes about abortion, which my hairdresser also let me know about. She, as a devout Catholic, believes that, as a religious issue, abortion is a matter of conscience and shouldn’t legislated by the courts. She also told me to tell you all that she is not alone in this thinking among her Catholic friends and community.)\n\nFor what it’s worth, the majority, accepted Jewish position, based on a number of legal texts I won’t get into here, is that life begins at birth. But I don’t believe the right question here is “when does life begin?” We can never know exactly the moment life begins, no matter what any religion claims.\n\nRather, I believe we should be asking “how can we honor life?” Our response to that question will clarify our priorities, spur our actions in our community, and amplify our voice in the public arena. And Jews should speak just as loudly on this issue, because as my Catholic hairdresser knows, this is a religious issue.\n\nWe should not let one religion claim to be the definitive religious voice on this issue. And that’s why I am proud to have been asked to serve on the clergy advisory council for Keystone Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that provides education, programs, and advocacy for youth and adults throughout Central and Eastern PA.\n\nWhat might a Jewish religious response to reproductive healthcare sound like? As with any questions I have, I turn to our holy text. I read about Sarah’s laughter when an angel first comes to tell her that she will bear a child in her old age. I also relate to Hannah, who we just read about in our Haftarah, in her tears and distress about not being able to conceive as she bargains with God and fate. This is a common trope found throughout the Torah, known as the motif of the barren woman – virtually all the biblical matriarchs have difficulty either conceiving or being pregnant.\n\nWhy? What is the message here? Perhaps the text is telling us: life – it is not in your control; it was never in your control. The beginning of life and the timing of death are completely out of all of our hands, no matter what science or politics wants to say about it. Perhaps this is why we read this text on Rosh haShana, of all days.\n\nWhat does it mean if, like Sarah, you give up on being able to carry a child yourself and decide to use a surrogate? What does it mean if, like Hannah, you can’t get pregnant? What does it mean if you lose the pregnancy, or if it isn’t viable? Or what if you are unable to carry a child to term without great risk to your own life? Could it mean that God doesn’t intend for you to become a parent, at least at that moment? If this is so, then why were you created? When the biblical matriarch Rebekah was at last carrying twins after a period of barrenness, and the twin pregnancy was causing her great distress, Rebekah cries out, “Lama anochi? Why am I?”\n\nWhy indeed? Why are we? It is exactly these weighty questions that we must face at the beginning of a new year. And what if you feel that now is not the right time to bring a child into the world, or that you aren’t meant to be a parent at least right now, or that it would be too harmful to continue a pregnancy – those are deeply individual discernments and decisions that aren’t for anyone else to pass judgment on. Again, that is also why abortion is a religious issue and a right, similar to one’s right to wear a kippah or hijab in public or to circumcise your child.\n\nWe typically think of Rosh haShana as the “birthday of the world,” a cosmic birthday party, if you will. But if that were all it was, we should be centering our prayers not so much on ourselves and teshuva but on the natural world and our relationship toward it – to respect, protect and tend to it. This is deeply necessary work, especially in an age of climate crisis.\n\nBut if you notice, the liturgy of Rosh haShana focuses much more on doing the work of repentance, repair, return. It centers on teshuva, the idea that you can change your fate and alter the course of your life for the better. Why is that?\n\nBecause, Rosh haShana is also considered the birthday of humanity. There is a debate in the Talmud about the exact date the world was created. Some sages maintained that it was the first of Tishrei, that is, today. But other sages assert that in fact, the world was born on the 25th of Elul, six days ago. That would make today in fact the sixth day of creation, which is the day human beings were created.\n\nIf so, then today is the day we are reminded that all people are created in the image of God. Today we celebrate humanity in all its messy and glorious diversity, and today we celebrate our choice, our freedom, our agency, our lives.\n\nThe central message of Rosh haShana is that you have agency, more power than you know – to make mistakes, to own up to them, and to choose how you live your life in the best way possible going forward. Rosh haShana comes to tell us that you can start anew, you can create your destiny – you are not slaves to your past and thus you have a responsibility to your future, and the future unfolding of the world.\n\nSo, if we must expect this for ourselves, so too must we make it possible for everyone to have agency, to choose the course of their lives, to discern their lives’ purpose.\n\nWhen I struggled with miscarriages, one after the other, I questioned if God meant me to have children. Perhaps my true purpose lay elsewhere. And, then, as Josh held our first child as she cried in protest at being yanked from the comfort of the womb, I sang to her a song that I had sung throughout being pregnant with her. With a look of startled recognition, she instantly quieted down. In that moment, I instantly saw that my life’s purpose was forever altered.\n\nOn Rosh haShana, we examine our lives and we ask: Why are we? How can we honor life? What are we meant to create and to birth into the world?\n\nThe first line of our Torah portion today is Genesis, Chapter 21, “Ve’Adonai pakad et Sarah,” meaning God took note of Sarah as promised.” On Rosh haShana, we humbly ask that God take note of us, heed our prayers, and help us honor life. May we be blessed with a renewed sense of life and clarity of purpose.\n\nShana tova u’metuka\n\nWhen September came, it brought a wave of cool air and clear skies. Bring on apple picking, crisp fall days, and campfire nights! While I managed to squeeze a lot of fun into the summer, I was happy to turn my back on the terrible heat and humidity, and constant storms that often came with flash flood and tornado warnings, ominous signs of climate change and a warming planet.\n\nLike so many of you, I just want release and relief from the enormity of the problems that face us. I worry what kind of life and what kind of planet my children will inherit. We have never truly been the masters of our own fates, but during more stable times we could pretend that we were, at least for stretches of time. We could embark on a career, and plan for our future. We could extract resources from our Mother Earth, and pretend that she could give endlessly. We could elect a new president, and expect a peaceful transition. We could anticipate a vacation, and assume it would happen. We could prepare High Holiday services without multiple contingencies!\n\nBut our world has been rocked to its very foundations. This past year, the pandemic upended our ability to plan, and feel safe in so many settings we took for granted only a short while ago. Political instability has riven our democracy and society. And climate catastrophe is rapidly overtaking us, shattering – almost unimaginably – even our ability to trust in the flow of the seasons.\n\nWe find ourselves living in extremely disorienting and challenging times. We didn’t want this to be so, nor did most of us expect such a rapid unraveling, but here we are. How in heaven’s name do we move forward?\n\nDuring the High Holidays we pray that God will help us return. Return us from climate disaster, return us from illness and fear.\n\nBut the High Holidays do not promise us a return to normalcy, or to the past. They urge us to wake up to the urgency of the present moment, and the call of the future. These holidays, alas, are not “feel good” celebrations. More than at any other time of the year, the High Holidays urge us to awaken to awe – to the amazingness of life on this planet, but also to how fragile and precious it is. These Days of Awe come to tell us – just as people are constantly changing, the world is changing too. Our work in this season is to awaken to this changing present and future.\n\nBut it isn’t just the High Holidays; the whole of Jewish tradition and practice is centered around humility in face of change. It is built into the very rhythm of our existence, our calendar, the cycles of our seasons.\n\nTake Shabbat. Long before the existence of the modern labor movement, the Torah taught us that every seventh day we are required to cease from labor and to relinquish control over those who work for us, both human and animal. Every seventh day we reset our awareness, so that we would remember that we are distinct human beings apart from our achievements, created by God, and that we are fortunate recipients of life, not lords of this earthly domain.\n\nMore dramatically, every seventh year our ancestors in the land of Israel observed a sabbatical year. In Hebrew this year is called a Shmita year.\n\nThe word shmita itself means to “release,” as in opening up a clenched hand to free what is held there.” Leviticus 25:2-4 states: “The earth shall have a Divine sabbath. Six years shall you sow your field and six years shall you prune your vineyard and gather her produce. The seventh year is a Sabbath of Sabbaths to the land, a Sabbath to the Divine.”\n\nShmita is the seventh year in a recurring cycle of sacred sevens that traces its count back more than 2,500 years. Shmita, like Yom Kippur, is called a Shabbat Shabbaton – a Sabbath of Sabbaths. Rabbi Arthur Waskow says that it is Shabbat to its exponential power – Shabbat to its fullest, Shabbat with your whole soul.\n\nShmita has not been fully observed according to biblical proscription since the fall of the Second Temple 2000 years ago, and technically its laws would only apply to Jews living in the land of Israel. A form of it continues in Israel in strictly observant communities, but even so taken literally it’s a huge burden, wholly incompatible with modern life.\n\nBut aspects of it live on in modern society. It is traditional, for example, for certain vocations, including my own, to take a sabbatical, a period of time for rest and renewal, every seven years. I had a sabbatical, half which was taken just before the pandemic began in January and February of 2020, the other half which was delayed and finally taken in April and May of this year. That period of time was so valuable to me – indeed, I was able to release from old patterns and find a new rhythm that was healthier and more sustainable for me, my family, and this congregation. It was a gift, and I would argue that it is more than valuable, it is necessary. Not just for me, but for everyone, and the planet itself as well.\n\nWell, this year we all get this gift, should you choose to receive it. This year, 5782, starting on Rosh haShana ten days ago, is a shmita year.\n\nGiven that we as liberal Diaspora community aren’t bound to the laws of shmita, what might the concept of shmita offer us as a spiritual ideal? Our goal would not be to restore a straight-up seventh-year sabbatical, but to embed and enrich our communal and individual lives with “Shmita-consciousness.”\n\nShmita lifts up a radical and extraordinary vision; that an entire society can reset itself under more equitable conditions, and that it can even allow cultivated lands that support the society to also rest and revitalize. Perhaps it might offer wisdom about how to live in a more sustainable rhythm with the earth? Maybe it could help us to more gracefully accept losses and changes as the pandemic stretches on? Perhaps it might even teach us how to open to a new, more just, more loving, more holy kind of normal?\n\nFittingly, I’ve chosen seven lessons we might learn from shmita this year.\n\n1 – Rest!\n\nWe need the rest in order for the active parts to have meaning. Resting reminds us that we are more than what we produce. Rest can be generative, it can also allow us to step out of production mode and just be in a sacred state of being.\n\nRest is sacred and holy. A rest is not a void – we learn this from music! The rest is an essential part of the groove. The late great Charlie Watts, the drummer of Rolling Stones, was a master of pulling back and playing as few beats as possible for what was needed to get people dancing.\n\nLetting things rest can mean giving something permission to emerge.\n\nCassady Rosenblum, who recently quit her job as a producer at “Here & Now,” a NPR program and went to live with her parents in West Virginia, wrote a great opinion piece last month in the NYT called “Work is a False Idol.” In it she writes, “Here in the hills, the new silence of my days, deepened by the solitude of the pandemic, has allowed me to observe the state of our planet in the year 2021 — and it looks to be on fire, as our oligarchs take to space. From my view down here on the carpet, I see a system that, even if it bounces back to “normal,” I have no interest in rejoining, a system that is beginning to come undone.”\n\nShe continues, “In her poem “The Summer Day,” Mary Oliver asks, “Tell me, what is it you plan to do/ with your one wild and precious life?” My reply, for now, is simple: Sit on the porch. It’s not half-bad. For what is the porch if not a place to chat with neighbors, to marvel at the hummingbird at the feeder, to listen to the wind in the chimes? An altar for cynics, an altar for the erotic, an altar for the future.\n\nShmita, in its call to rest, is an altar for the future.\n\n2 – Rupture!\n\nA few days ago I attended a funeral for a wonderful man, the father of a dear friend of mine. At the funeral, his daughter passed out buttons that said, “Why Be Normal?” because he wasn’t normal and she wasn’t normal and that was ok. Perhaps it’s time we all figure out how to be okay with not being normal. Shmita forces a rupture, upending what we might grow accustomed to thinking is normal, perhaps so that a new paradigm can emerge.\n\nIn a beautiful piece in the Financial Times last year, entitled ‘The Pandemic is a Portal’ Arundhati Roy asks: “What is this thing that has happened to us? It’s a virus, yes. In and of itself it holds no moral brief. But it is definitely more than a virus. Some believe it’s God’s way of bringing us to our senses. Others that it’s a Chinese conspiracy to take over the world. Whatever it is, coronavirus has made the mighty kneel and brought the world to a halt like nothing else could. Our minds are still racing back and forth, longing for a return to “normality”, trying to stitch our future to our past and refusing to acknowledge the rupture. But the rupture exists. And in the midst of this terrible despair, it offers us a chance to rethink the doomsday machine we have built for ourselves. Nothing could be worse than a return to normality. Historically, pandemics have forced humans to break with the past and imagine their world anew. This one is no different. It is a portal, a gateway between one world and the next. We can choose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world.”\n\nThe pandemic, in a way, has been a sabbatical for us. It has humbled us, forced us to simplify our lives and consider what the most important things in life are. It has been a gift in that sense.\n\n3 – Reframe!\n\nLet’s be clear: the way we’ve been doing things is not sustainable. We are tied into an economic system that glorifies private ownership and that rewards greed. Both our society and our natural world are teetering as a result. The gap between the rich and the poor grows obscenely out of balance, and the balance of nature itself has now become so disrupted by our greed that we are beginning to experience the catastrophic results.\n\nFor the Torah, the concept that people can own the earth is the height of hubris, an absurdity and a desecration. The idea that the land out of which we are formed is ours to exploit and extract from endlessly is an obvious recipe for disaster. And so the Torah insists that, if we do not provide the land with its regular sabbaticals, and maintain a right relationship with it, then there will be natural consequences. The land will no longer sustain us: Lev 26:43 warns “The land will spit you out, so that it can make up for the sabbatical years that you denied it.”\n\n4 – Return!\n\nShmita calls us to return to the land, to each other, and to God. The Torah recognizes that it is human nature to forget that God truly provides for all we have. In the book of Deuteronomy, God says to the Israelites: Be careful when you come into the land that I God am giving to you. In the euphoria of arrival and your quick successes, the defeat of your enemies, the fertility of your flocks, the rain watering your fields, you’ll soon forget My role in bringing you here. You’ll get haughty. You’ll look around and say aloud “I alone did THIS.” And you’ll be wrong.\n\nBut this is not about God’s ego. This is about the damage we do to ourselves when we believe it is only thanks to our individual strength, fortitude and wisdom that we achieve success. Because when things don’t go the way we want, we sometimes shoulder the responsibility and forget to look for help. We forget that we are inextricably linked to family, friends, community, and God.\n\nShmita calls us to return to one another, to share our burdens, and to be humble in our blessings. This year, we can make the choice to shift the focus from one of individual accomplishment, acquisition and entrepreneurship, to one of community, faith, and collective responsibility, a far more sustainable model than the trope of the “self-made man” – for us and for future generations.\n\n5 – Release!\n\nShmita envisions a year of radical release, releasing fields from cultivation and letting the land lie fallow, eating only what grows on its own, releasing debts, so that anyone who had been indentured due to their debt was freed, and redistributing food so all can access. A farmer’s fields are open to all.\n\nYou might think this is an impossible feat, especially in today’s world. But shmita challenges us to trust in the earth’s abundance, in one another, and in God. Shmita calls for us to release our tight fist – ultimately, for me it is a spiritual practice of acknowledging our vulnerability and humanity, and to keep our greed and fear in check. To neutralize our greed, amassing and hoarding the earth’s produce, we are to take only what we need, and share whatever the land spontaneously grows with all who wish to eat—rich and poor alike as well as domestic livestock and the native wildlife. By letting go in all these ways we may come to recognize that, without the land belonging to us, it can still produce, to quote Gandhi “enough for everyone’s needs, but not for everyone’s greed.”\n\nOur tradition recognizes that greed is inherent in human nature. Deut. 15:9-10 warns us: “Beware lest you harbor the selfish thought, ‘the sabbatical year is approaching’ and you refuse to give to your needy kin. Rather, give readily and have no regrets when you do so, for in return YHVH your God will bless you in all your efforts and in all your undertakings.” A commentary on this text (Midrash Sifrei Devarim #43) states: “Human beings rebel against God only from satiety.” And this is what we must guard against. Accumulation of wealth leads to entitlement and arrogance. When we are greedy, we stop up the flow of blessing in which we all share.\n\nIt is tempting to stock up on toilet paper or whatever seems to be cleaned out of the shelves at the grocery store (these days it is dairy products), but we must not let fear or greed get the better of us. Even in our individualistic, capitalistic society we can practice shmita-consciousness, sharing our abundance and generously giving what we can.\n\nBeginning October 10, I will be teaching a three-part class called “A Generous Spirit” in which we will discuss Jewish values and money, scarcity and abundance, and mitzvah of giving. I hope you will join me!\n\n6 – Relief\n\nWe must give the earth relief from human overuse and depredation, and that’s a huge task, but it can be addressed one mitzvah at a time. I am excited that our Tikkun Olam committee has chosen to focus on shmita as its theme for the year, as we explore ways as a community we can do more with less, feed our neighbors, and be better stewards of the land. We’ll have dinner in the sukkah on Sept 25 with Cathy Snyder, Founder and Director of Rolling Harvest Food Rescue. We will learn about shmita and how we can incorporate its concepts into local farming and feeding. And on October 9 we’ll have a gleaning event at the Gravity Hill Farm as we learn about the mitzvah of gleaning fields to share with our neighbors in need. Lastly, I invite you to check out the Buy Nothing flyer in your Shana Tova bags, which is a great way to practice doing more with less and being stifled with all that we have. There are so many ways to bring shmita-consciousness into our individual and communal practice – it is very exciting to explore all the opportunities!\n\n7 – Restore!\n\nLastly, and perhaps the most challenging – Shmita calls us to forgive all debts. Everyone should be able to reset, particularly the stranger, the immigrant, the servant or low-wage worker, the orphan and widow (see Deut. 15). Shmita is the biblical path out of the cycle of servitude and poverty.\n\nLife today is vastly different than in biblical times, but we are still sadly quite familiar with the burden of debt ,whether it is our mortgage on our homes, college loans we have been repaying for decades, or the medical bills piling up. This concern is especially concerning during a global pandemic, which tests the strongest health care systems – even as tens of millions of Americans remain un- or under-insured, and billions around the world struggle with inadequate resources.\n\nA modern shmita practice would challenge us to reduce our own debt and the debt of the neediest among us. Kol Tzedek, a Reconstructionist synagogue in West Philadelphia, is working on abolishing the equivalent of $2.5 million in medical debt. By raising $25,000, they would eliminate $2.5 million in health care bills because hospital systems sell unpayable debt at discounted rates.\n\nImagine having no debt, and the kind of freedom it would enable on every scale. When one isn’t burdened by debt, one is less concerned with the need to make money at a certain level or inhibited to follow one’s dreams regardless of what one could earn. One can plan for the future proactively and build a more sustainable future.\n\nIsn’t that what we desperately need? I believe these extraordinary times call for the radical vision such as shmita. I pray that we come out the other side on this pandemic stronger, wiser, and more interdependent. I pray that this sabbatical year brings us closer to a sustainable human presence on the earth. I pray that perhaps we can also release one another, on this Yom Kippur Day, from any accumulated resentments, any sense of being owed something.\n\nToday, let us remember who we are and whose we are; that we are here but for a short time, and that the most enduring aspect of our lives is not what we consume but what we leave behind.\n\nTzom Kal – May you have a meaningful fast and a transformative holiday.\n\nMa Tovu ohalecha yaakov – how beautiful are your tents O Jacob, your dwelling places O Israel…it is an amazing blessing to be sharing this tent with you this morning. If you knew all the work over the last month that went into making this set up work…it is wonderful to see you all here, and here (wave to zoomers) this morning.\n\nI have talked about the ingenuity and resilience of our community over the past 18 months, but I must say that from where I stand now it feels in a way like it was preparation for the last month, a month when we realized that in spite of all the mask wearing, isolating, and vaccinating this thing is not over. And yet, here we are. I need to express my gratitude to everyone who, in their own way, kept us together over this year and a half, and really made us stronger than ever. Adversity does indeed inspire creativity and it has revealed a strength in our community as well.\n\nThat is not to say that we are not exhausted and heart worn. Life for me feels more out of my control than ever before. The High Holidays come this year with a message: Accept your losses, accept help. We can’t do it alone. Have a little faith and let God hold you sometimes. In the past year and a half the importance of community is clearer to me more than ever. Amidst these challenging times, as a Jewish community we ground ourselves in the transcendent – in prayer, tradition, respect for humanity, acts of kindness and justice.\n\nAnd the pandemic had its own message – don’t continue to do things the way you always have because “tradition.” You must respond to the present moment, to the needs of your community. More than just being responsive, you must live into the future and who you want to become if you are to thrive. And this too is the central message of the HHDs. You must expand your tent. And so I’d like to explore what that means for us as a community today\n\nKol Emet is a beautiful tent. Our beauty is not just aesthetic, though we are blessed with our beautiful grounds and sacred space. Our tent is exemplified by kindness, and a love for meaningful, evolving, creative Judaism. It is a living Judaism, a doing Judaism, a Judaism for our times, where we respond to the present moment with honesty and nuance, drawing from the deep well of Jewish values. As a Reconstructionist Jewish congregation, we are inspired by our tradition but not bound by it. And as much as I am your spiritual leader, our members govern our community and truly drive its Jewish vision and mission.\n\nLet me share an example of this. Kol Emet, since its inception, has welcomed and included interfaith families in a way that was pretty radical 30 years ago. And I’d say we’re still ahead of the game. We invite everyone in our community to be involved, have a voice, and get involved in our committees regardless of their religious background or how much they know. We allow any adult to come up to the bimah for a Torah honor. We count every adult in a minyan.\n\nIt is not that we are blind to difference. We at Kol Emet have long recognized that people who weren’t raised Jewish bring their own religious and personal perspectives to bear in the Jewish community that are important and beneficial. We know that it is important that we seek diversity in our committees, even and especially in religious matters. Our Ritual Committee invites the perspectives of those who weren’t raised Jewish, or who have young kids at home to make services and holidays accessible and relevant to everyone.\n\nI want to point out that this is more than just Kol Emet policy; over time it has shaped our identity and our synagogue culture. Rather than being united by an assumption of our shared background, we have evolved into a congregation that is united by our values, by how we treat one another, and by our spiritual practice.\n\nBut naturally, we have boundaries – as every community or congregation should. We must have boundaries to protect our community norms, our progressive Jewish values, and our sacred tradition. We must stand for something even when, or especially when it feels hard. However, as a Reconstructionist synagogue, we are much more focused on our positive mission and than in erecting walls to keep the wrong people out.\n\nBut we also must set boundaries for our physical safety. Unfortunately this is the world we live in and we need to think in this way. The sad reality is that 59.1% of all hate crimes motivated by religious bias in the US in 2020 were anti-Jewish (https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/facts-and-statistics). I could give a whole other sermon on anti-semitism, or racism, and I have. The reality is that we always need to balance being welcoming and accessible with looking out for our safety, and this is not just a challenge unique to Kol Emet.\n\nBut it must be said that communities also set boundaries in ways that are more unspoken, implicit, reflexive, even unintentional. And it’s important that we acknowledge this so that we can become aware of our unconscious biases and fears. For example, if somebody comes in that we don’t recognize, we might come up to them and talk to them and try to find out about them. If we somehow feel that something is off, we might start getting worried.\n\nBut how do we determine whether someone fits in, or doesn’t, in a synagogue setting? That is often a more subconscious process of looking for something recognizably Jewish, like a star around a person’s neck, or a Jewish sounding last name, or even facial features that look familiar.\n\nI say this with great compassion for those of us who grew up with Jewish people and Jewish community looking or behaving in a certain way, or sounding or eating in a certain way. Certainly, in the United States, Ashkenazi culture, ritual, language, and food have been the norm for over 100 years. Between 1880 and the onset of restrictive immigration quotas in 1924, over 2 million Jews from Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Romania came to America. The character of American Jewry was transformed, as the Eastern Europeans became the majority. Before that time, interestingly, the American Jewish community largely adhered to Sephardic ritual customs particularly in Jewish hubs including Newport, R.I., New Amsterdam (later New York), Philadelphia.\n\nNow, again, in the last thirty years, while we weren’t looking, the American Jewish landscape has transformed yet again. Just look at our community – Jewish last names are no longer reliably Rosenbaum or Katz; they are also Boswell, O’Rourke, and Santarsiero. This is indicative of the changing face of the Jewish community in America as we continue to integrate into the diverse fabric of American society.\n\nThe recent 2020 Pew population study (https://www.pewforum.org/2021/05/11/jewish-americans-in-2020/) gives us some perspective on these changes. 72% of Jews married since 2010 are married to non-Jews. That is compared an 18% intermarriage rate of Jews who married before 1980. Now, this is not necessarily bad for the Jews. The adult Jewish population in America has been fairly stable in percentage terms, while rising in absolute numbers, roughly in line with the growth of the U.S. population. And, as one might expect, like the overall U.S. population, Jews appear to be growing more racially and ethnically diverse as one might expect with intermarriage.\n\nNow, approximately 1 in 10 Jews identify with other racial or ethnic categories. Among Jews ages 18 to 29, however, the share who identify as a race or ethnicity other than white rises to 15%. Overall, 17% of Jews surveyed – including 29% of Jewish adults under the age of 30 – live in households in which at least one child or adult is Black, Latinx, Asian, non-White multiethnic, or multiracial. I should note that Jewish families of color and Jewish interfaith families are not necessarily the same thing, though there may be some overlap.\n\nThat diversity is reflected at Kol Emet, and especially so in our religious school. And I write this sermon because of them. Our kids are awesome – they learn in many different ways and have wide-ranging abilities and talents. They also have diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds, and gender and sexual orientations. We need to ensure that every part of them is seen, welcomed and appreciated in our community.\n\nMordechai Kaplan, the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, who was also a student of sociology, wrote about assimilation, that word so often used in a negative sense in describing Jewish integration into American society. (“Active, Not Passive, Assimilation” article in A Different Light ed. by Noam Zion and Barbara Spectre with excerpts from “The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion,” 1937) He wrote that it actually means two opposite things. In one sense, to BE assimilated is to passively integrate into the dominant culture, leaving one’s particular heritage behind. But in another sense, to actively assimilate means to take the best of the principles and ideals of the greater society into one’s particular heritage or culture or religion. Jews have actually done this for millenia. We’ve taken European foods like kugel, challah, and bagels and made them Jewish food. American Jews have integrated Eastern practices like yoga and meditation into our spiritual practice in congregational life.\n\nSo yes, we are engaged in active assimilation here at Kol Emet. We bring Jewish values and ancient wisdom forward to address the changes and challenges in American society. And we bring American values and practices into our rhythm here at Kol Emet. That’s why our tagline is “Judaism for today’s world.”\n\nBut yes, to answer the critics, with all this assimilation there is a danger of staying true to our heritage. But then, there is also a danger of our heritage remaining static as everything changes around us. One hundred years ago, Rabbi Kaplan was greatly concerned about Jewish practice remaining stagnant and prayer being done by rote while American values of democracy, pluralism, and egalitarianism were embraced in the public sphere. We have to change with the times, regardless, and this is something the Reconstructionist movement has always recognized.\n\nAnd so, seeking home in synagogue life are people – adults, kids – who are interfaith, multiracial, multinational, LGBTQ. And just as we are demanding that our Jewish selves be embraced fully in American life, they expect no less – that the Jewish community welcome every part of who they are as well.\n\nBy they, I really should say “we” – after all, my own family is interfaith, bi-racial, and multinational. And I would not be a rabbi, or maybe even Jewish at all, if my then-Christian, Swiss mother and my Jewish New Yorker father weren’t accepted in the Jewish community at every step of their journey. But I myself have been told in Jewish spaces, and after services that I have led, that I don’t look Jewish, and that my daughter is too blond to be Jewish. I have been questioned about my “exotic” Jewish heritage, which is not Ashkenazi, but Sephardic, as my grandmother was born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica. I have experienced the assumption that I should know Yiddish or least have heard it in my home growing up. In fact, I heard Hebrew of Western Sephardic vocalization mixed with Judeo-Spanish, or Ladino, (and of course a lot of Patwa and curse-words if you were blessed to know my grandmother).\n\nI bring up my experience because unfortunately these experiences are not unique to me. Jews come from all parts of the world – we speak different languages, speak Hebrew with different accents, have different musical and culinary traditions. But somehow there is an implicit assumption in too many Jewish spaces that Jews are Ashkenazi and that they are white. Indeed, unfortunately these “othering” experiences are more pronounced for Jews of color. This spring, at our Shabbat services, we had the blessing of hearing from Zohara Armstrong, my study partner and a Jew of color, about her negative and positive experiences in Jewish spaces.\n\nJust a few weeks ago another landmark study called “Beyond the Count” came out, which surveyed the experiences of 1000 Jews of Color in the US.
