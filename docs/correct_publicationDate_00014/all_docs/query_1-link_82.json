        "text": "Virtual Assembly (VA) is one of the key technologies in advanced manufacturing field. It is a promising application of virtual reality in design and manufacturing field. It has drawn much interest from industries and research institutes in the last two decades. This paper describes a process for integrating an interactive Virtual Reality-based assembly simulation of a digital mockup with the CAD/CAM infrastructure. The necessary hardware and software preconditions for the process are explained so that it can easily be adopted by non VR experts. The article outlines how assembly simulation can improve the CAD/CAM procedures and structures; how CAD model preparations have to be carried out and which virtual environment requirements have to be fulfilled. The issue of data transfer is also explained in the paper. The other challenges and requirements like anti-aliasing and collision detection have also been explained. Finally, a VA simulation has been carried out for a ball valve assemb...\n\nAssembly operations are a key component of modern manufacturing systems. Designing, planning, and conducting assembly operations represent an important part of the cost of a product. Virtual reality provides an efficient and cost-effective solution to manufacturing design, planning, and prototyping. Still there are certain issues (such as data translation, integration of various hardware and software systems, and real-time collision detection) faced while applying this advanced technology to the assembly domain. For example, existing works focus on using virtual reality systems and environments mainly to design new products and to plan for assembly. Little focus has been given to develop virtual reality environments that contribute to train operators on assembly operations and to bridge the gap between design and implementation/execution of assembly. Therefore, the research work presented in this article focuses on developing a fully functional virtual manufacturing assembly simulat...\n\nThe goal of this work is to investigate whether estimates of ease of part handling and part insertion can be provided by multimodal simulation using virtual environment (VE) technology. The long-term goal is to use this data to extend computer-aided design (CAD) systems in order to evaluate and compare alternate designs using design for assembly analysis. A unified, physically-based model has been developed for modeling dynamic interactions and has been built into a multimodal VE system called the Virtual Environment for Design for Assembly (VEDA). The designer sees a visual representation of objects, hears collision sounds when objects hit each other, and can feel and manipulate the objects through haptic interface devices with force feedback. Currently these models are 2D in order to preserve interactive update rates. Experiments were conducted with human subjects using a two-dimensional peg-in-hole apparatus and a VEDA simulation of the same apparatus. The simulation duplicated a...\n\n— Mixed reality (MR) is a hybrid reality where real and virtual objects are merged to produce an enriched interactive environment. Virtual Reality (VR) has been used in the simulation of production processes such as the product assembly and the execution of industrial tasks. Augmented reality (AR) has been widely used as an instructional tool to help the user to perform the task in real world conditions. Most of these works were focused on solving technical problems, specific to the type of application but they did not take advantage of the achievements realized in both VR and AR technologies. This paper presents a mixed reality system that integrates virtual assembly environment with augmented reality. This approach is mainly based on the development of a hybrid tacking system for the synchronization of the virtual and the real hand of the user. The evaluation of this Mixed Reality approach showed a statistically significant improvement of the user performance in the assembly task execution, compared to the task realized in virtual environment."
