        "text": "Mimicking physical odor sensations virtually can present users with a real-time odor synthesis that approximates what users would smell in a virtual environment, e.g., as they walk around in virtual reality. To this end, we devise a Smell Engine that includes: (i) a Smell Composer framework that allows developers to configure odor sources in virtual space, (ii) a Smell Mixer that dynamically estimates the odor mix that the user would smell, based on diffusion models and relative odor source distances, and (iii) a Smell Controller that coordinates an olfactometer to physically present an approximation of the odor mix to the user's mask from a set of odorants channeled through controllable flow valves. Through a three-part user study, we found that the Smell Engine can help measure a subject's olfactory detection threshold and improve their ability to precisely localize odors in the virtual environment, as compared to existing trigger-based solutions.\n\nTY - GEN\n\nT1 - The Smell Engine\n\nT2 - 29th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces, VR 2022\n\nAU - Bahremand, Alireza\n\nAU - Manetta, Mason\n\nAU - Lai, Jessica\n\nAU - Lahey, Byron\n\nAU - Spackman, Christy\n\nAU - Smith, Brian H.\n\nAU - Gerkin, Richard C.\n\nAU - Likamwa, Robert\n\nN1 - Funding Information: This research was supported by the NSF Next Generation Networks for Neuroscience Program (Award 2014217), the ASU Interplanetary Initiative, the ASU School of Life Sciences, the ASU School of Arts, Media and Engineering, the ASU School for the Future of Innovation in Society, the ASU Mayo Clinic Seed Grant, and National Institutes of Health (NIDCD R01DC017757 and R01DC018455, NINDS U19NS112953).
