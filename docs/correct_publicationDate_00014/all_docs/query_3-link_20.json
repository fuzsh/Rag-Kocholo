First describing the physics of sound, synthesis, and sampling, we discuss the software methods used to accomplish our goal of teaching users about the relationship between timbre and wave shape through the use of the Unity game engine. The software allows a user to draw a waveform and have the unique timbre that corresponds be output back to the user. Complex and unique waveforms can be modeled in this manner to be analyzed for distinct tone qualities that are otherwise be difficult to recreate. We observe users’ understanding of wave shapes and the relationship to tone quality through asking questions before and during a software test to ascertain any improvement in understanding.",
