        "text": "Join Health Students for a Healthy Climate on Thursday, April 23, at 6:00 p.m. via Zoom for a climate conversation hosted by the College of Veterinary Medicine. This will be an open discussion about animal health as it relates to the environment and human health.\n\nWhile we work to expand environmental health discussions in our own curriculum at the University, students currently wishing to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the environment and human health can take this free, online course offered by the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nMedical Students for a Sustainable Future (MS4SF) is dedicated to uniting students invested in the health of our planet and patients by providing medical students with tools to make a difference at their institution and in the community through advocacy, curriculum reform, research and climate-smart healthcare.\n\nBecoming a member will connect you to a network of passionate students and keep you up-to-date with concise, monthly emails. There are infinite ways to become involved, and we are in great need of more medical student voices advocating for environmental health. MS4SF is an independent, medical student-led group advised and supported by Health Care Without Harm, an international non-governmental organization.\n\nCoalition for Advancing Climate Health Education (CACHE)\n\nCACHE is a group of students and faculty aimed at advancing environmental health in our curriculum by integrating relevant information in existing lecture structures and developing new lectures and elective courses. The group will meet once every quarter to re-evaluate progress, using the Planetary Report Card as a guide.\n\nTake Survey\n\nUSCF National Survey\n\nThe survey consists of approximately 20 questions and takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. You will generate your own study identifier (no names will be associated with the survey responses) to allow for maintenance of confidentiality, as well as to link data collected from you in the future when this survey is distributed again to track changes in student perceptions as climate health curricula changes over time. Survey responses will be saved on a secure, password-protected storage service, and only designated study personnel will have access to study data. If you are interested in participating, please click this link on your computer, tablet, or smartphone to complete the survey by June 14.\n\nTake Survey"
