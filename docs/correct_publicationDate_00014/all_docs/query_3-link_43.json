        "meta_description": "Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are rapidly developing technologies that offer a wide range of applications and enable users to experience digitally rendered content in both physical and virtual space. Although the number of studies about the different use of VR and AR increases year by year, a systematic overview of the applications of these innovative technologies in intensive care medicine is lacking. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a detailed summary of how VR and AR are currently being used in various areas of intensive care medicine. We systematically searched PubMed until 1st March 2023 to identify the currently existing evidence for different applications of VR&nbsp;and AR for both health care providers in the intensive care unit and children or adults, who were in an intensive care unit because of a critical illness. After screening the literature, a total of 59 studies were included. Of note, a substantial number of publications consists of case reports, study plans or are lacking a control group. Furthermore, study designs are seldom comparable. However, there have been a variety of use cases for VR and AR that researchers have explored. They can help intensive care unit (ICU) personnel train, plan, and perform difficult procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, vascular punctures, endotracheal intubation or percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. Patients might benefit from VR during invasive interventions and ICU stay by alleviating stress or pain. Furthermore, it enables contact with relatives and can also assist patients in their rehabilitation programs. Both, VR and AR, offer multiple possibilities to improve current care, both from the perspective of the healthcare professional and the patient. It can be assumed that VR and AR will develop further and their application in health care will increase.",

        "text": "VR as a tool for health care providers to improve clinical practice\n\nAdult intensive care medicine\n\nVR might assist in educating and training healthcare professionals [2] (Fig. 2) as intensive care treatment strategies are often complex and require not only theoretical knowledge but also practical preparation. In a randomized controlled trial of 381 participants, Nas et al. evaluated the value of VR for learning cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). They reported comparable chest compression rates but an inferior compression depth compared with face-to-face training [11]. The research on VR/AR in this field is generally very heterogeneous [12]. Wolff et al. developed a VR training environment to improve the traditional training for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [5]. Bronchoscopy is another important tool for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in ICU patients and performing this procedure can be challenging. Colt et al. created a virtual reality bronchoscopy simulation. Through the acquired skills after VR training, five novice physicians were comparable to four experienced physicians regarding dexterity, speed, and accuracy in the model [13]. In a prospective randomized study with 60 healthcare providers, Chiang et al. evaluated 15-min VR-based learning on tracheostomy care. The use of VR materials increased significantly participants' self-efficacy (increased familiarity, more self-confidence, and less anxiety) and the positive impact persisted until 3 to 4 weeks later [14].\n\nPediatric intensive care unit\n\nCaring for patients in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (PICU) can be particularly challenging [15], and aspects such as performance, knowledge, self-efficacy, and learner satisfaction are of great importance. In terms of these endpoints, Yu et al. evaluated the effects of a VR simulation program on nursing students. In three scenarios, the interventional group (n = 25) experienced a 40-min VR simulation and routine practice, and the control group (n = 25) only did routine practice. The use of VR resulted in a significant increase in high-risk neonatal infection control performance, self-efficacy, and learner satisfaction [16]. Yang et al. investigated in a non-randomized controlled study the impact of VR neonatal resuscitation program among others on knowledge, problem-solving, or degree of anxiety [17]. The VR group (n = 29) participated in a neonatal resuscitation gamification program, while the simulation group (n = 28) participated in high-fidelity simulations of neonatal resuscitation and online lectures. The control group (n = 26) had only online lectures on neonatal resuscitation. VR and simulation groups achieved significantly higher levels of neonatal resuscitation knowledge and learning motivation than the control group. Furthermore, VR application was found to be effective in increasing problem-solving ability and self-confidence compared to the others groups. However, anxiety was lowest in the simulation group. Ralston et al. investigated VR-based simulation of two scenarios: ectopic junctional tachycardia and low cardiac output syndrome in the early postoperative period and acute respiratory failure in a patient with suspected coronavirus disease [15]. All six pediatric cardiac critical care physicians successfully navigated the VR environment and met the critical endpoints such as connect the patient to the pacemaker and correctly overdrive pace or intubate the patient and connect to the ventilator. Farra et al. compared the success of VR training versus web-based clinical updates for emergency evacuation in a newborn ICU. Although there was no significant difference in terms of cognitive assessments and self-efficacy, the VR group performed statistically and clinically better in the live exercise [18]. Agasthya et al. evaluated a VR tutorial for endotracheal intubation. Participants of the interventional group completed a 19-min immersive guiding and the control group listed the steps from memory. Both groups demonstrated their skills with traditional manikins and were scored on a 24-point checklist. There was no significant difference between the groups [19].\n\nVR as a tool for healthcare providers to reduce stress\n\nStress is a common phenomenon in the intensive care unit for both patients and health care providers. In a study with 66 ICU nurses investigated Nijland et al. the effect of VR on perceived stress levels. Sixty-two percent of the ICU nurses, who used VR-Relaxation during their breaktime reported VR to be helpful to reduce stress [20]. Bodet-Contentin et al. also showed in a study of 88 intensive unit caregivers that the use of VR could improve the efficiency of the breaks [21].\n\nPatient experiences with VR during and after ICU-stay\n\nAdult intensive care\n\nFrom the patients' perspective, intensive care treatment is associated with a number several symptoms such as pain [1]. If one now modulates attention, environmental conditions, and mood with VR, this can reduce the attention devoted to pain [22] (Fig. 3). Mosso-VÃ¡zquez et al. used VR to present different immersive environments such as Cliff or Dream Castle to 67 patients after cardiac surgery [23]. The results were evaluated with a Likert scale and almost 90% of the patients reported a decreased level of pain experienced post-therapy with VR. Esumi et al. evaluated VR in a patient whose pain after a fasciotomy for acute compartment syndrome could not be adequately controlled and opioid-related side effects, such as respiratory depression, have occurred. The use of VR led to a 25â75% dose reduction in fentanyl administration and the concomitant alleviation of respiratory depression [24]. In a randomized, prospective study of 200 cardiac surgery patients, Laghlam et al. demonstrated that VR application was equivalent to conventional treatment with oxygen and nitrous oxide in terms of reported pain scores during removal of chest tube [25]. Markus et al. focused on the technical and procedural feasibility of VR in daily routine and showed that the VR application takes almost an hour for setup, instruction, VR therapy, and cleaning. Especially in smaller centers such programs would be difficult to implement due to lack of staff and resources [26]. Hoffman et al. demonstrated in their study with 11 burn-injured patients the positive effects of 3-min VR application during wound care on pain relief and a positive correlation between the immersive strength of VR and its pain-relieving effect [27]. However, Faber et al. showed that the effect would be less after three consecutive days [28].\n\nDue to discomforts such as aggressive noises, lights, and a lack of information, the intensive care units are often associated with negative feelings such as anxiety or stress for patients [7]. MerliotâGailhoustet et al. investigated in a randomized trial EâCHOISIR (ElectronicâCHOIce of a System for Intensive care Relaxation) the effects of different electronic relaxation devices on the reduction of overall discomfort, pain, anxiety, dyspnea, thirst, lack of rest feeling and stress in sixty ICU-patients. The patients received four relaxation sessions (standard relaxation with TV or radio, music therapy, and two VR systems with real or synthetic motion pictures). In the group with synthetic motion pictures the overall discomfort, pain, and stress could be significant decrease, while the real motion pictures were associated with a reduction in lack of rest. Both VR-Systems led to a significant decrease in anxiety. Three adverse events might occur: claustrophobia, dyspnea, and agitation. However, in general cybersickness (occurrence of symptoms such as headaches or nausea during VR use) rarely occurred [29].\n\nHaley et al. evaluated in a pilot study 5-min VR sessions in 10 mechanically ventilated patients. VR therapy proved to be a potential means of managing anxiety in this patient group without the occurrence of predefined safety events or cybersickness [30]. The quality of sleep could also be positively influenced by the use of VR. In a study with 100 patients, it was shown that due to the VR application, the sleep quality was significantly better but the total sleep time and light sleep time did not differ between the groups [31].\n\nHypnosis has been used in the management of acute and chronic pain for a long time [32]. Rousseaux et al. tested a âvirtual reality hypnosisâ in patients undergoing cardiac surgery comparing VR to control patients, hypnosis without VR, and VR without hypnosis. All four techniques were used one day before and one day after surgery [33, 34]. However, in their randomized-controlled study with 100 patients, there were no significant differences regarding the outcome measures (anxiety, pain, fatigue, relaxation, physiological parameters, and opioid use) between the groups [35].\n\nTo evaluate the usefulness of VR for reducing sensory overload and deprivation in the ICU Jawed et al. put VR goggles on 15 ICU patients for 15 min and exposed them to relaxing beach videos with nature sound effects. Most patients tolerated the headsets well and reported the positive effects of VR therapy on anxiety and stress [36]. Naef et al. investigated how long visual and auditory stimuli should be provided to intensive care unit patients. In their study, visual stimuli should not exceed 10 â 15 min, while auditory stimuli should not exceed one hour to prevent negative side effects [37].\n\nSuvajdzic et al. used a combined approach to prevent delirium in ICU patientsâThe DREAMS system (Digital Rehabilitation Environment-Altering Medical System) [38], which combined an immersive digital reality acquisition system with a measurement system. The VR environment consisted of a commercially available VR headset. The measurement was sophisticated: it includes physiologic sensors 3-axis wearable accelerometers, a video camera, and environmental sensors for light and noise exposures for measurement of movement, physiologic and emotional responses to assess the movement, physiologic and emotional responses. In addition, an electroencephalogram sensor measures the sleep quality and response to therapy [39]. The DREAMS system has so far only been used in a small feasibility study with 59 non-intubated ICU patients and was well-received but there was no significant effect on physiologic measures, pain, or sleep [40].\n\nFamily support also plays a big role for the patients in the ICU [41]. Therefore, He et al. used the fifth generation plus virtual reality (5G + VR) equipment to establish visitation channels for patients and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic. They showed in a cohort study with 141 ICU patients that after 5G + VR visitations, the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) decreased significantly, along with a significant reduction in the proportion of delirium [42].\n\nICU patients often experience not only delirium but also other neurocognitive impairments [43]. In this context, Turon et al. examined in a pilot study the benefits of VR-assisted early neurocognitive stimulation in 20 critically ill adult patients [44]. The simulation includes a virtual avatar that accompanies patients, helped them orient to time, delivered instructions, motivated them to complete exercises, and encouraged them to relax. This application was found to be feasible, safe, and reliable, and stimulated cognitive functions. Navarra-Ventura et al. evaluated also a VR-based neurocognitive intervention during ICU stay in 34 critically ill patients. A 1-month follow-up that these patients had better working memory scores and showed up to 50% less non-specific anxiety and depression compared to the control group [45].\n\nEarly mobilization of ICU patients improves patient outcomes and reduced hospital stay length [46]. Gomes et al. used Nintendo Wiiâ¢ in 60 adult ICU patients to increase their physical activity [47]. Activity levels were light to moderate on a modified Borg scale and a majority of patients expressed a desire to play the videogame during their upcoming physical therapy sessions. The study from Parke et al. utilized a similar approach: Xbox Kinect Jintronix software targeting arm, leg, and trunk strength, range of motion, and endurance in 20 adult ICU patients [48]. Most patients found the activity enjoyable, and easy to understand, as well as motivating to continue participating.\n\nICU stay constitutes a considerable psychological burden for patients. In several studies, Valke et al. investigated the effects of ICU-specific virtual reality on mental health [49,50,51,52]. In one of them with 104 patients the group evaluated three and six months after ICU treatment, repetition of 14-min VR modules about ICU treatment improves subjective well-being and quality of life. VR resulted in a reduction of post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression scores, and the effect was still present six months after exposure. Although the mental health was also initially better this effect was no longer observed after six months.\n\nPediatric intensive care unit\n\nThe stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) can be an emotional and stressful experience for both children and parents [53]. In a pilot study with 32 critically ill children, Badke et al. investigated the feasibility and satisfaction of virtual reality in the PICU. All participants enjoyed using the technology, and 84% expressed interest in using it for a longer period. The positive effects were also observed among the parents, with 100% reporting satisfaction while watching their children use virtual reality. Moreover, parents reported that their children were calmed by VR [54]. In another study by this group with 115 critically ill children, the positive influence of VR on engagement and physiologic effects such as heart rate variability was confirmed [55].\n\nKucher et al. [56] and Hoffmann et al. [8] evaluated VR for better pain management and both were able to show positive effects. Abdulsatar et al. investigated the feasibility and safety of using Nintendo Wiiâ¢ in a pilot-trials with 12 critically ill children [57]. The application improved upper limb activity but grip strength did not change significantly from baseline. Lai et al. used VR on two adolescents suffering from Covid-19. The patients could choose from various active games such as boxing and non-active games such as racing. The authors conclude that VR gaming improved participantsâ affect and alertness, motivating them to engage more in early mobilization therapy [58]."
