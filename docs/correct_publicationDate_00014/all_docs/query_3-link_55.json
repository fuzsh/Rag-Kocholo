Techniques for distributing components of sound across basic and mesh-like geometry surfaces are discussed. A virtual-world audio environment supporting a listener avatar and various spatially extensive sound sources is described, and forms of source-to-listener distance attenuation are outlined with their roles in sound localization of spatially extensive sound sources. The implementation described herein takes form as an audio plug-in, of which the behavior, usage details, and compatible host applications are mentioned.",
