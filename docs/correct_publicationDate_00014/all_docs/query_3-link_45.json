        "meta_description": "The relationship between people and digital information has been changing all the time. On the one hand, people can obtain an enormous amount of information from texts, images and videos in various ways. On the other hand, from keyboard, mouse, touch screen to voice, the interactive modes of information are getting closer to the five natural senses of the human being. The popularity of the virtual world will promote the evolution of the relationship once again. The presentation of information will move toward the integration of virtual and real information, and the interaction of information will step toward a totally new form driven by technologies such as image recognition and gesture recognition.",
