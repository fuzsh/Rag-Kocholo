        "meta_description": "Synthesis & Other Virtual Realities — Rosenblum, Mary — &#34;A major new talent. . .one of the strongest debuts in recent science-fiction history, &#34; wrote Lucuis Shepard not long ago about emergent superstar Mary Rosenblum. And just as Shepard himself was the most powerful new short-story writer of the previous decade, so has Ms. Rosenblum come forth as a compelling voice in the 1990s in a sequence of nouvelles, set primarily within the near-future West Coast, exploring the persistence of humanity amid a nightmarish landscape of desiccated ecologies, disintegrating societies, and bewildering techniques: &#34;Water Bringer, &#34; &#34;Entrada, &#34; &#34;The Centaur Garden, &#34; &#34;Second Chance, &#34; &#34;Synthesis, &#34; &#34;Flood Tide, &#34; &#34;The Rain Stone, &#34; and &#34;Stairway.&#34;",
