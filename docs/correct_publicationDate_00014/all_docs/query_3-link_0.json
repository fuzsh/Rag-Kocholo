        "text": "Mary Rosenblum attended the prestigious Clarion West Writers Workshop in 1988 and sold her first Science Fiction story there, to the editor of Asimov's Magazine. Her career took off and she never looked back! Winner of the Compton Cook and Sideways Awards, finalist for the Hugo and Nebula, she went on to publish many Science Fiction and mystery novels with New York publishers, as well as a host of critically acclaimed short stories in multiple genres. She began teaching writing more than fifteen years ago and has twice been invited back to teach at the Clarion West Writers Workshop. Today she helps new authors publish and promote their work successfully and safely as a Literary Midwife, through her business The New Writers Interface and is the author of multiple handbooks for the new writer.\n\nWhen she's not writing or working on client manuscripts, she flies a small plane as an instrument rated pilot."
