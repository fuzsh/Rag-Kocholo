        "text": "Abstract\n\nAs virtual environments—in the form of videogames and augmented and virtual reality experiences—become more popular, it is important to ensure that they are accessible to all. Previous research has identified echolocation as a useful interaction approach to enable people with visual impairment to access virtual environments. In this article, we further investigate the usefulness of echolocation to explore virtual environments. We follow a participatory design approach that comprised a focus group session coupled with two fast prototyping and evaluation iterations. During the focus group session, expert echolocators produced a series of seven design recommendations, of which we implemented and trialed four. Our trials revealed that the use of ambient sounds, the ability to place landmarks, directional control, and the ability to use pre-recorded mouth-clicks produced by expert echolocators improved the overall experience of our participants by facilitating the detection of openings and obstacles. The recommendations presented and evaluated in this article may help to develop virtual environments that support a broader range of users while recognising the value of the lived experience of people with disability as a source of knowledge.\n\nAppendix\n\nA Questions That Guided the Focus Group and Post Evaluation Interviews\n\nA.1 Questions That Guided the Focus Group Session\n\n–\n\nWhat is your preferred method of echolocation (tongue clicks, clapping, stomping) and why?\n\n–\n\nYou all use environmental sounds to negotiate your surroundings. Could you go into more detail? How are these sounds different in the sense of the information that they give?\n\n–\n\nDo you have any experience with binaural recordings?\n\n–\n\nWhat would be the best way to describe the effect of using echolocation?\n\n–\n\nWhat would be, for you, the perfect echolocating sound?\n\n–\n\nHow did the echolocation-enabled virtual world you’ve been exposed to compare to the lived experience you have as echolocators?\n\n–\n\nHow did everyone feel about the directional cues provided in the echolocation-enabled virtual world you’ve been exposed to? How would you improve them?\n\n–\n\nHow does the presence of objects in a physical room affect your echolocation?\n\n–\n\nWe have been talking mostly about in-door spaces. How does echolocation change in out-door spaces?\n\n–\n\nIf you were able to enhance your echolocation through a device or something that you would carry it with you, what would that something look like?\n\n–\n\nHow or when did you first realize you were echolocating?\n\n–\n\nHow did you learn to echolocate?\n\n–\n\nWalk me through a normal day in your life and tell me what role echolocation plays in it.\n\n–\n\nWhat’s the image that you get in your mind when you use echolocation?\n\n–\n\nWhat elements can hinder your ability to echolocate?\n\nA.2 Questions That Guided the Post Interview After the First Evaluation Session\n\n–\n\nPlease describe the layout you have recreated. Was it the same layout in both trials?\n\n–\n\nWhat information did the use of the ventilation sounds convey?\n\n–\n\nHow did the use of ventilation sounds improved or worsened the experience when compared to the previous sterile environment you had been exposed to in the past?\n\n–\n\nHow did changing the volume of the fans affect the experience?\n\n–\n\nWhat was your opinion about the coins?\n\n–\n\nHow else would you convey landmarks?\n\n–\n\nHow did the use of coins improve or worsened the experience when compared with the previous sterile environment you had been exposed to in the past?\n\nA.3 Questions That Guided the Post Interview After the Second Evaluation Session\n\n–\n\nPlease describe the layout you have recreated. Was it the same layout in both trials?\n\n–\n\nWhat was the impact of having control over the direction in which the character moved?\n\n–\n\nWith the addition of the control in direction came a change in the layout of the controls in the Xbox controller. What are your thoughts about that?\n\n–\n\nHow were the recorded clicks different from the artificial clicks?\n\n–\n\nWhat was your opinion about the cane sounds?\n\n–\n\nHow do the cane sounds compare to the clicking sounds?\n\n–\n\nWhat are your final thoughts on the four options we have tried: ambient noises, the coins as landmarks, fixed compass points, and recorded clicking sounds?\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nJérémy Albouys-Perrois, Jérémy Laviole, Carine Briant, and Anke M.
