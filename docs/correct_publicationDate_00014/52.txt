Defy Distance: How to Use Virtual Reality to Engage Youth

Are your patrons craving connection? Are you looking for ways to engage middle and high school students through global awareness?

Laura McGinty and TuesD Chambers are staff members at Ballard High School with a goal of building community and encouraging global awareness by defying distance through VR. They will share protocols, lesson ideas, and ways to engage family and community members in virtual reality. And, in the process, create ways for people to connect with one another.

Project LIT Leads the Way to School-Wide Reading Culture

Promote reading and build a school-wide reading culture with the student-led Project LIT Community, a national grassroots literacy movement. From in-school student and teacher challenges to LIT lunches and even parent involvement in the reading lives of students, we'll look at how the student-created Project LIT reading lists can center a school's reading culture around the lived realities of their students. In addition, the Project LIT Community focused on rewriting the narrative of what literature is deemed worthy of academic study and authentically advocates for greater diversity in our libraries and classrooms.
