        "text": "Really does it need any explanation? This is the 3rd step in my simple little 4 step system for goal achievement. Not only do we do this to keep our goal, dream or vision in the forefront of our mind. By writing it down daily we are trying to impress it into our subconscious. We're doing this by incorporating other senses than just the thought that's in our mind. We're using, touch with the movement of the pen in our hand. We're using sight as we see ourselves writing it down, we're reading what we're writing, and we're visualizing ourselves in the moment when the goal's been achieved. It does not matter if you're striving to hit a new level in business or in your personal life. Heck, maybe your big goal, dream or vision is to be the best county fair stage performer in the world, who juggles chainsaws while hypnotizing blue ribbon farm animals. WRITE IT DOWN.\n\nDo you see the elephant in the room? If you are a parent of school-age children, I know you are having a fantastic summer, but I want to say I see you. I SEE YOU: • Maneuvering the schedules before, during, & after work • Handling all the logistics • Trying to figure out what to provide kids in terms of infrastructure - Especially with middle and high school kids - Attempting to provide growth and independence without seeming negligent or helicopter → I bring this up because every interaction I am having these days with parents of school-age kids is met with this guilt. → Summer is hard because society teaches us that we should pretend to be stay-at-home parents with all sorts of freedom and liberties to make summer the dreamy blast we see on social media. → So, I tell you to keep going and say you are doing a good job. Our kids will remember more good than we realize. Nothing is more important than time. ✅ So choosing to be present in the time we do have is the priority. ENJOY the rest of your summer! How are you making time to be present with your children this summer?\n\nWhy is August so humid? You can point the finger at corn for playing a significant role in the sticky heat. I grew up in Iowa and still live in Iowa and didn’t know this fact until this summer. It’s another great reminder to not just spend time learning about places far away, but also to get curious about the very place you call home. Get curious about your state, your city, your community, the history of your neighborhood. It’s amazing the stories and facts you can collect about places you feel you already know so well. Discover answers to things you never questioned. Find your inner 3 year old and start asking “why”. I never questioned why it was humid in August. It just was. My clients have to deal with me asking “why” to their statement “it’s just how we have always done it.” Digging into that “why” never fails to uncover information that illuminates new ways forward. Get curious. It makes life so much more interesting. #iowacorn #corn #cornfields #cornfield #iowasummer #iowalife #iowalove #getcurious #leadershipdevelopment #leadershipskills\n\nWorld Braille Day, observed on January 4th annually, is a global initiative to raise awareness about the importance of Braille in promoting equal access to information for visually impaired individuals. Established by the United Nations, this day commemorates Louis Braille's birthday, the inventor of the tactile reading and writing system that has empowered millions worldwide. Braille plays a crucial role in fostering inclusive education, as approximately 90% of visually impaired individuals live in developing countries, facing challenges in accessing education and employment. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 2.2 billion people globally experience vision impairment or blindness, underscoring the urgency of promoting Braille literacy. Despite its significance, Braille usage faces a decline in some regions due to technological advancements. By promoting World Braille Day, we advocate for a more inclusive society where everyone, regardless of visual ability, can participate fully in education and employment opportunities. #AllianceHealthcarePK #BrailleDay #DisabilityAwareness"
