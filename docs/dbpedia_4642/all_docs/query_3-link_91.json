All music used by Media Molecule in the story mode can be obtained in the player's Popit for use in Create Mode. This music falls into two categories: regular music, with a clear starting and stopping point, and Interactive Music, which allows the level creator to set which instruments are heard at any given point in their level. A creator's musical selection may be added to via Downloadable Content, and as with all other items collected in LittleBigPlanet, the full musical library may be imported into LittleBigPlanet 2 and LittleBigPlanet 3.\n\nTracks which are heard in the game but not obtainable for level creators (excluding via glitches) are also noted on this page.\n\nLinear Music[]\n\nStory[]\n\nIcon Normal icon (to be filled) Name Artist Level(s) Heard In Level Obtained In Original Or Licenced?
