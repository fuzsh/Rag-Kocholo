        "text": "Picture this: I'm sitting in the plush office of a record company A&R Director. He swings in his executive leather chair, fingering the keys to his new BMW. On his desk, a portable phone and an A4 Filofax; to his right a hi-fi system resembling a Richard Rogers building: to his left, a waste disposal unit... for demo tapes.\n\nHis secretary calls on an internal phone. A young artist is waiting in reception, claiming he has an appointment. \"Tell him to come back this afternoon, or tomorrow - or next week... or something. I'm busy being interviewed by a journalist,\" the A&R man snorts dismissively. He resumes his inventory of all the hit acts he's signed and the propositions he's declined from budding Madonnas wanting to sleep their way to the top. I bring up the subject of music. \"Music?\" his eyes glitter with delight. \"Fuck music, let's make money.\" He falls off his chair in paroxysms of laughter, pointing to the gallery of gold discs that adorn his office wall.\n\nFact or fiction? Probably a bit of both. But it's a fitting caricature of the way A&R departments are perceived by most aspiring musicians. Indeed, from the outside there can be few aspects of the music business surrounded by such an aura of myth. It's not difficult to see why. The A&R man is the point of entry to a world of fame and riches. Once the ink has dried on the contract, the whole music business machinery moves into gear, thrusting the artist into the public eye. Consequently, the world inhabited by these gate-keepers abounds with stories of promises made and broken, dreams fulfilled and shattered.\n\nOnce inside this world, past the corporate fa√ßade and the CIA-trained secretaries, A&R looks a little different. As a profession it's as precarious as politics, with reputations lost just as quickly as they're won. As a business it's as circumscribed as any other, with A&R departments answerable to what Jeff Young describes as, 'men in grey suits' shouting, \"Bottom line! bottom line!\"\n\nYoung is the recently appointed A&R Director of MCA Records. It's an unmentionably early hour of the morning and we're sitting in his Soho office, feasting on take-away toast and cappuccino. Dressed in American-style sweatshirt and jeans, Young chomps and chats with great enthusiasm. His days as a Radio 1 DJ are now firmly behind him, but he still likes to trade in extravagant language. \"Coalminers wives get paid danger money,\" he explains, \"I get paid grief money.\" What kind of money are we talking about? \"Well that depends on who you are,\" he generalises, \"Scouts can earn between ten or 15 grand, with a company car thrown in. A good A&R Manager can earn 60 or 70 grand, whilst successful A&R Directors can earn upwards of 100 grand and considerably more if they've been doing it for a while.\"\n\nYoung continues his 'Beginners' Guide to A&R... \"the normal structure of an A&R department is Director, Manager, Scout. The Scouts scout, the Managers each have their own bunch of artists and the Director runs the team. At MCA, like elsewhere, there's a weekly A&R meeting where we discuss the progress of acts we've signed, we play new tapes and also screen what other companies are looking at.\" 'Screen?' - sounds like industrial espionage. \"There's nothing underhand about it; it's just a question of having the chance to say no. There's nothing worse than learning that an act has been signed somewhere else and you never even got a chance to hear them. That's when the fur really flies,\" he explains, his hands mimicking flying fur.\n\nAnnie Roseberry claims not to worry about what other companies are up to. She's Vice-President of A&R at the American company, Elektra, and heads their A&R operations in this country. \"I'm pretty laid back,\" she explains, slumbering in her chair. Her angular face evinces an occasional smile. \"A lot of people get really worried about what other people are doing. I don't care. They can do whatever they want.\" It takes a while to decide whether this is hubris on her part or simply self-assurance. Probably the latter. After all, hubris doesn't pay the bills.\n\nShe runs a smaller outfit than Jeff Young, with a modest roster of artists, so the system is a little different to that of the bigger record companies. She works closely with a single A&R Manager and writes weekly reports on everything she sees and hears - which includes the few dozen tapes arriving at Elektra's offices every week. \"They all get listened to,\" she insists. \"They're logged into a book just in case someone calls up.\"\n\nAt CBS, where she worked for eight years, she remembers up to 100 tapes pouring into the office each week. \"In most record companies, it's the junior members of staff who listen to the tapes and then refer them upwards. It's the same here, but they do all get listened to and they get a reply. One or two are followed up, but 99% are just not good enough.\"\n\nJeff Young agrees. \"I've never signed a band on the basis of an unsolicited tape.\" And EMI's senior A&R Manager, Dave Ambrose, adds his voice to the chorus. His department receives \"loads of unsolicited tapes, but they are generally very poor. You know, the kid who's played it to his best friend who tells him it's great\". Norman Jay, at Phonogram's Talkin' Loud, is adamant that sending tapes willy-nilly is a loser's game. \"Sometimes, I might follow up a tape with a phone call. But in the end, it's usually not what I'm looking for.\"\n\nThis, of course, is little comfort to the many thousands of aspiring musicians for whom sending in tapes seems like the only way to alert record companies to their music. But Jay has some pearls of wisdom to offer. \"If some mad rock 'n' roll kid sends me a tape, he's got it all wrong.\" 'Rock 'n' roll', in case you had any doubts, is not Jay's bag. \"I tell kids to do some research, find the label that's doing the stuff you to do, a label that's sympathetic. Don't just come to us because we can put your record out. That's what knobs off the A&R man and makes him say, 'I don't want to know'.\" He pauses, screws up his face and scratches his chin. \"You know, I really think the direct approach is just wrong. You need to engineer a situation where the A&R man comes to you. Create a noise, and they'll come to you, they'll want to give you money.\" Jay returns to the 'knob' theme... \"If you go cap in hand, they'll want to knob you off.\"\n\nGarrulous and expansive, Mick Clarke is firmly ensconced in a modest terraced house in West London where he is A&R Director of Virgin's 10 Records. \"I remember the days,\" he says with an air of maturity which seems strangely at odds with his T-shirt and shorts, \"I remember the days at Virgin when we had to see three people in the morning and three people in the afternoon, straight off the street. They'd bring their tapes or their guitars and every day I'd have to sit and listen to music I didn't understand, music I hated, which is crazy. I found myself in the ludicrous position of having to judge music I wasn't in a position to judge. So I'd tell people that I shouldn't really be listening to them, and they'd get quite upset... I was abused and almost attacked once.\"\n\nSo we can take it that Mick is none too keen on an open door policy at 10 Records? \"It's not that,\" he replies in descending tones. \"I understand that people have high hopes for their tapes and I do try to see people who really believe in their stuff and who try to convince me it's something I will want to hear. But A&R is not just about sitting round listening to tapes. Signing a band is just the start of it; you then have to develop the artists, decide on studios, producers, what track to release and what strategy to pursue.\"\n\nYou might expect Ashley Newton to agree with Clarke. After all, they are both on the same side. Newton is head of A&R and joint MD at Circa Records which has recently assumed responsibility for all of Virgin's subsidiary labels. Newton's office looks like something straight out of the Conran shop. And Newton himself exudes the confidence of someone who has just had a shave and put on a fresh shirt. \"When I was at Island we had open days consisting of a succession of 40 minute meetings. It's important to make your company accessible. But an open door policy is simply not cost-effective - to have two or three staff spending all their time in meetings with bands, most of whom will not be appropriate.\"\n\nLike the rest of his peers, Newton's signings have come through his own personal network. \"You simply can't ignore people you know who are tuned into what you want. It's a pre-existing filtering process.\"\n\nSo where does that leave the up and coming artist? Dave Ambrose waxes philosophical. \"There is no easy way. It's a bitch, but that's the way it is. Even so, if a band is good they will be signed.\" Do you you really think so? \"Yes, if they play the right clubs, they will be heard. A&R people are sharper and more aggressive than they used to be. They are out there.\"\n\nJeff Young is also confident that not too many acts slip through the net cast by his department. \"What tends to happen,\" he explains, \"is that bands which are good have also got a bit more wit and charm than the regular outfit. Sometimes you may miss one but anyone who writes good songs will eventually come across someone who can help them - like a lawyer, a DJ or a producer. Alternatively, they create a stir at a local level. It's not easy to keep secrets. We have a network of contacts across the country, and if we don't find the bands, we'll follow up on someone who has.\"\n\nA&R departments habitually shadow each other according to John Giacobbi, former BMG lawyer and now head of Entertainment Law Associates. \"A&R departments are very narrow-minded,\" he opines. \"They're more worried about job security than anything else, so they won't take risks. They follow each other with a lemming-like fervour. But those who do take the risks often reap the rewards.\" He cites the example of The Gipsy Kings. \"Nobody would take their first album. Nobody wanted to stick their neck out.\"\n\n\"An open door policy is simply not cost-effective - to have two or three staff spending all their time in meetings with bands, most of whom will not be appropriate\""
