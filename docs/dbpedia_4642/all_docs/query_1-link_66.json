        "text": "At Kimberly-Clark McGuire was responsive for the $1.4bn redesign of Kleenex and the redesign that re-established the Cottonelle brand. Prior to Kimberly Clark she held the role of chief culture officer for Colourful Brands, where she co-wrote ‘Brand Bible: The Complete Guide to Building, Designing and Sustaining Brands’.\n\nOf the appointment, Jonathan Sands, founder and chairman of Elmwood, said: “There is no greater compliment than a Fortune 100 design leader joining our studio. Effectiveness is what matters, and Jessie is grounded in the business imperative of design. We expect her to play a pivotal role in our US expansion.”\n\nMcGuire added: “So many US categories are ripe for change. Their leaders can only effect it when the right talented people push them to think about the business in an altogether different way. Not many agencies are willing or able to do that. Elmwood is.\n\n“Elmwood’s maverick spirit is ideal for companies that are ready to transcend playing it safe. We give them the brand bravery to make a business difference with design. My job is to sell in the most challenging, thought provoking work. It’s an invigorating place to be.”\n\nAs strategy director McGuire will bring a client perspective to the job of brand design for Elmwood’s roster of global and local clients."
