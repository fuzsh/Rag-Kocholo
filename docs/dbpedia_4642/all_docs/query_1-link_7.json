        "text": "maggie...@webtv.net wrote in message\n\n<21117-39...@storefull-153.iap.bryant.webtv.net>...\n\n>Can anyone explain how Universal Music Group has been organized since\n\n>the MCA/Polygram merger? What labels are still in existence and which\n\n>have been eliminated?\n\nI'm not sure if UMG knows which labels are still around! Actually, most of\n\nthe \"old\" label names are still in use, but they are more symbolic than\n\nanything else. For example, Sheryl Crow and Sting still are on A&M Records,\n\nbut there is no separate A&M Records corporate structure anymore. And there\n\nis still a Motown Records (Brian McKnight is on the label), but it, too, has\n\nno meaning except as a name.\n\nI think that all the labels were consolidated into several groups. The\n\npop/rock/R&B were divided into three units:\n\n-- \"Island Def Jam\" (Def Jam, Del Soul, Island, Rounder, Capricorn)\n\n-- \"Interscope Geffen A&M\" (Dreamworks, Outpost, Almo Sounds, DGC, A&M)\n\n-- \"Universal Motown\" (Motown, Republic, Universal, MCA)\n\nThe rest are:\n\n-- Universal Classics (classical. Labels: Decca, Deutsche Grammophon,\n\nPhilips). For the first time ever, the releases on Decca overseas are also\n\non Decca in the USA, and the old \"London\" label is no more as \"Decca\" has\n\nmore international cachet.\n\n-- Verve Music Group (jazz. Labels: Verve, GRP, Impulse!)\n\n-- UMG Nashville (labels: MCA Nashville and Mercury)\n\n-- Universal Music Enterprises (the back catalog division. Labels: Hip-O,\n\nUniversal Special Markets)\n\nVarese Sarabande/Varese Vintage still seems to be quasi-independent (it\n\noperates separately but is distributed by UMG).\n\n>\n\n>Is Mercury Records still around? Is it strictly a country music label\n\n>now?\n\n>\n\nMercury (in the US anyway) seems to be 100 percent country now: Shania\n\nTwain, Eric Heatherly, Kathy Mattea, Terri Clark, Shane Minor... Those\n\nnon-country artists who were on Mercury (Ringo Starr, Hanson) are now on\n\nIsland, I think. Also, most of Mercury's 45s come out as part of the MCA\n\nNashville numbering system (first six digits of the nine-digit number are\n\n088 172).\n\nIf you care more, do a search on \"Universal Music Group\" on Yahoo and go to\n\nthe corporate site.\n\nTim Neely\n\nGoldmine magazine\n\nmaggie...@webtv.net wrote in message\n\n<5311-39...@storefull-154.iap.bryant.webtv.net>...\n\n>It's interesting how some labels that were relatively small and hadn't\n\n>been around that long before the merger seem to be highly emhasized now,\n\n>while others have fallen in stature.\n\nI think a lot had to do with which company heads didn't bail out at the time\n\nof the merger! UMG paid Chris Blackwell a lot of money for Island, so they\n\nweren't about to make that label name disappear. Interscope, which started\n\nthe 1990s as a boutique label in the Atlantic/Atco family, is the biggest\n\nsurprise to me, considering how its association with \"gangsta rap\" in the\n\nmiddle of the 90s made it a hot potato for awhile, bouncing from one\n\ndistributor to another. But Jimmy Iovine stayed around for the merger, so\n\nhe got to keep his label. :)\n\n>\n\n>I'm surprised with what happened to Mercury. Mercury was traditionally\n\n>Polygram's flagship (pop/rock/r&b, as well as country) label in the U.S.\n\nIt was founded in 1945 and by 1950 was already considered a \"major label.\"\n\nAs it was based in Chicago, it always had a cross-section of music\n\n(everything from jazz to blues -- there was a big CD box set with nothing\n\nbut Mercury blues records at one point). Frankie Laine's success helped put\n\nit on the map, and Patti Page's kept it there.\n\nIn the early 1970s it was bought by Polydor, the big German record company.\n\nAt first the new company, which originally comprised Mercury, Philips and\n\nVertigo in the US, was called \"Phonogram.\" Once German Polydor bought (and\n\nfolded) MGM Records, it became \"PolyGram.\" For a while, it appeared as if\n\nMercury was going to become a country label in the very early 1980s -- the\n\nnon-C&W releases on the label trickled to a precious few. But the\n\nconsolidation of all the PolyGram labels around 1983 (that's when the goofy\n\nsix- to nine-digit catalog numbers started) helped make Mercury a major\n\nacross-the-board player again.\n\n>As recently as the late '80s/early '90s Mercury had a sizable\n\n>non-country artist roster (John Mellencamp, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, ABC,\n\n>Kiss, Rush, Van Morrison, Tears For Fears, Kool & The Gang, Cinderella,\n\n>the Scorpions, Swing Out Sister....). Obviously, a lot of those artists\n\n>have disappeared from the scene and/or left the label.\n\nMellencamp is now on Columbia. Both Cinderella and Scorpions I think are on\n\nCMC International, home for most of the 1980s metal or hard-rock artists\n\nthat stopped selling for the big boys. I think Def Leppard's material is now\n\non its own Bludgeon Riffola label, which UMG distributes. Kiss is on the\n\nreactivated Casablanca label. Rush, last I noticed, was on Atlantic (that's\n\nwhere the band went in 1989). Van Morrison is, I think, with Virgin.\n\n>\n\n>I guess Mercury wasn't able to react to the changes of the '90s\n\n>pop/rock/r&b fields very well,\n\nThat seems correct. Other than holdovers from the 1980s, I can't think of\n\ntoo many big non-country Mercury artists of the 1990s except Hanson.\n\nand UMG figured they already had too many\n\n>labels in those fields, so they decided to have Mercury concentrate on\n\n>country only.\n\nIn 1995, there was a box set called \"50 Years of Country Music on Mercury.\"\n\nAnd Shania was (still is) selling absurdly high numbers of CDs. Having\n\nMercury be a country label is not that surprising -- I think it would have\n\nevolved that way anyway, much as Dot Records did in the 1970s and (for the\n\nmost part) US Decca in the early 1970s.\n\nTim Neely\n\nGoldmine magazine\n\nMy understanding of the history of the Polygram labels is like this\n\n(picked up from various things I've read and heard and my experiences\n\ncollecting records; this may not all be totally accurate):\n\nPolygram was formed in the early/mid 1960s when two large German-based\n\nrecord companies, Polydor and Phonogram, merged. The new company called\n\nitself \"Polygram\", combining the names of its two consituent companies\n\n(POLYdor + phonoGRAM = POLYGRAM).\n\nRight around the same time, Polygram (or one of its corporate\n\npredecessors) bought U.S.-based Mercury Records. Over the next few\n\nyears, Polygram introduced some of its European imprints like Phillips\n\nand Fontana in the U.S., as what amounted to subsidiaries of Mercury.\n\nBoth of these labels were gone from the U.S. by the early/mid '70s.\n\nFontana made a brief comeback in the U.S. around the end of the\n\n'80s/beginning of the '90s, once agian as an affilate of Mercury.\n\nThe Polydor label was launched in the U.S. in 1969. I'm not sure what\n\nits status is today, but I don't think U.S. Polydor ever approached U.S.\n\nMercury in size or importance during the '70s,'80s, or early '90s.\n\nVertigo was another of the Polygram \"family\" of labels. Although it\n\nseems to have been a fairly important label in the U.K., Canada, and\n\nelsewhere, the Vertigo name was never used much in the US, and I don't\n\nknow much about the label's history outside the US. There were a couple\n\nof attempts to launch it here under Mercury distribution, once in the\n\nmid-'70s and again around 1990. Most of the artists who were on Vertigo\n\nin the UK and Canada were on Mercury in the US.\n\nAround 1974, Polydor took over US distribution for MGM Records, a label\n\nwhich had seen better days at that point. Around 1977, MGM sold its\n\nnon-soundtrack operations (including the back catalog) to Polydor.\n\nMGM's soundtrack operations continued--albeit just barely--until about\n\n1982 or 1983, and continued to be distributed by Polydor. After the MGM\n\nlabel shut down, MGM's relationship with Polydor ended, and some of the\n\nsoundtrack material was later issued on other labels.\n\nAround 1981, Polydor took control of RSO Records, which it had been\n\ndistributing for several years. RSO was operated as a subsidiary of\n\nPolydor for a couple of years, then was folded into Polydor around 1983\n\nor 1984.\n\nAlso around 1981, Mercury bought the Casablanca label, which was reeling\n\nfrom the loss of its most important executive (Neil Bogart, who had left\n\nto found Boardwalk Records, and passed away soon after) and most\n\nimportant artist (Donna Summer, who defected to Geffen Records).\n\nCasablanca had earlier taken control of 20th Century Records, so Mercury\n\nacquired the rights to that label's catalog as well. Casablanca was\n\noperated as a subsidiary of Mercury for a couple of years, then folded\n\ninto Mercury around 1983 or 1984 (although I have seen a few Casablanca\n\nreleases that came out later than that; I'm not sure what the story was\n\nthere).\n\nIn another transaction that also took place around '81, Polygram bought\n\n\"UK Decca\"/ London. It is my understanding that Decca/ London was not\n\nconsidered to be under Mercury or Polydor but was a separate division of\n\nPolygram. London had very little pop/rock/r&b presence in the US during\n\nthe '80s (the company didn't own the rights to the name \"Decca\" in the\n\nU.S. at the time, so all of its U.S. releases were under the London\n\nname) and I think Polydor may have actually handled its U.S.\n\ndistribution for a while.\n\nIn the early '80s, Mercury distributed Dee-Lite Records (best known as\n\nthe home of Kool & The Gang) and Riva Records (best known as the home of\n\nJohn Cougar Mellencamp). By the latter half of the decade both of these\n\nartists had moved to Mercury (taking their back catalogs with them) and\n\ntheir original labels apparently no longer existed. I don't know much\n\nabout these labels and what happened to them or exactly what their\n\nrelationship with Mercury was.\n\nDuring the last several years before the Universal merger, Polygram\n\nseemed to be pursing an agressive expansion policy, taking over several\n\nother labels, including U.S.-based A&M (1989?) and Motown (early/mid\n\n'90s?) and British-based Island (1990?).\n\nIn article <3662-39A...@storefull-153.iap.bryant.webtv.net>,\n\n<maggie...@webtv.net> wrote:\n\n> My understanding of the history of the Polygram labels is like this\n\n> (picked up from various things I've read and heard and my experiences\n\n> collecting records; this may not all be totally accurate):\n\n>\n\n> Polygram was formed in the early/mid 1960s when two large German-based\n\n> record companies, Polydor and Phonogram, merged.

The Phonogram-Polydor merger that formed PolyGram was in the\n\nmid-'70s, not mid-'60s. In the '60s, Mercury distributed Philips and\n\nFontana under license from Philips.\n\nBefore Polydor launched as a U.S. label in 1969, it licensed recordings\n\nto various U.S. labels. The Beatles' \"My Bonnie,\" recorded for Polydor\n\nand produced by Bert Kaempfert (who also recorded for Polydor), was\n\nlicensed to U.S. Decca (at the time, no relation to U.K. Decca). By\n\n1964, Polydor was licensing stuff to Atlantic, which is how The\n\nBeatles' version of \"Ain't She Sweet\" wound up on Atco.\n\nIn England, Robert Stigwood's Reaction and RSO labels were distributed\n\nby Polydor, which is how The Bee Gees and Cream wound up on Atco in the\n\nU.S. When Stigwood formed RSO, it was distributed in the U.S. by\n\nAtlantic for several years until he switched it to PolyGram\n\ndistribution just in time for the \"Saturday Night Fever\" and \"Grease\"\n\nsoundtracks.\n\nMeanwhile, MGM Records was the U.S. distributor for Polydor's classical\n\nlabels, Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft (DGG) and Archiv. Just as\n\nPhilips eventually bought its U.S. distributor (Mercury), Polydor\n\neventually bought its U.S. distributor (MGM). Polydor also merged with\n\nU.K. Decca (London Records in the U.S.) in the mid-'70s. The U.S. Decca\n\nlabel was eventually folded into MCA Records, which was bought by\n\nSeagram (the distillery). When Seagram bought PolyGram in 1998, this\n\nbrought the U.S. and U.K. Decca labels back together under the\n\nUniversal Music umbrella, so artists can once again be on Decca\n\nworldwide.\n\nAnd now, the whole mess (including Universal Studios as well as\n\nUniversal Music) has just been sold to Viviendi S.A. of France."
