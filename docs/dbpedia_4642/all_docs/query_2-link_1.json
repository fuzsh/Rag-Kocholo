        "text": "This week, a large portion of the music business shut down for Blackout Tuesday, a day meant to disrupt business as usual and take a stand against racial injustice.\n\nThe initiative, which played out mostly on social media with black squares and hashtags, was met with mixed responses: support from those who said they’d use the day constructively; and criticism from those who saw the pausing of mostly white-owned companies for one day as tone deaf, or worse — an attempt to appear supportive to the black artists from whom they profit. (After many companies failed to make clear if or how they’d be donating money, Warner Music Group announced the creation of a $100 million fund on Wednesday.)\n\nI’m the U.S. general manager of the British independent record label 4AD, and on Monday, I thought about my position as a music executive with a black father and a white mother. Devastated by the recent police killings of black people, I wanted to react appropriately. My company decided to close on Tuesday and encourage our staff to use the day productively. I made plans to write, listen to music by the black artists I love and reconnect with a black music executive whom I admire.\n\nWhen I was 23 years old in 1995, my Seattle rock band the Lemons signed to Mercury Records. As my bandmates and I sat in a palatial midtown Manhattan office, we faced the label’s president, Ed Eckstine, the first black person appointed president of a major American record label. (Motown retained its black leadership after it was bought by MCA.) I felt drawn to Eckstine’s confident, booming voice and his larger-than-life presence. This is what a record label president is like, I thought. I was in awe of him.\n\nEckstine, now 66, grew up in the music business, the son of the big band singer Billy Eckstine. He spent summers in the 1960s on tour with his father: a few weeks with an orchestra at a Jewish resort in the Catskills; a few weeks at a mostly Italian resort in the Poconos; and a few weeks on the Chitlin’ Circuit — the Apollo and other black theaters.\n\nWhen Ed Eckstine was 18, he took a job at Quincy Jones’s Qwest Productions, a joint venture with Warner Bros., where he worked with Michael Jackson, Rufus & Chaka Khan and New Order. After 11 years at Qwest and a short period with Clive Davis at Arista, Eckstine settled at Polygram Records, where he found great success with his first two signings to its Wing Records imprint: the former Miss America Vanessa Williams and the Oakland R&B group Tony! Toni! Toné!\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
