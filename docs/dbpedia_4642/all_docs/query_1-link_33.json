        "text": "“Nothing in this treaty has changed the known level of risk for what is an ambitious project. In some respects, the agreement of the treaty-level document between the three countries can be interpreted as a risk reduction measure,” Australian naval expert Jennifer Parker said.\n\nBy Colin Clark\n\n“We’re a long way down that path and really, that’s the thing that we need to [figure out] first,” Richard Marles, Australia’s deputy prime minister and defense minister, told Breaking Defense.\n\nBy Colin Clark and Aaron Mehta\n\nCollin Joh, an analyst at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies of Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, noted that this effort is part of a “progression from just bilateral to trilateral, and now quadrilateral maritime cooperative activity (MCA) formats” in the region.\n\nBy Colin Clark\n\n“This new contract further ensures these workers have certainty in Australia’s national naval shipbuilding and sustainment enterprise, and helps to grow the workforce required to build and sustain Australia’s future nuclear-powered submarines,” Sen. Katy Gallagher, the Finance Minister, said.\n\nBy Colin Clark\n\nSeparately Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said, “We need that infrastructure on the west coast and so it’s going to be really important to put that in place… . We have some time in order to do it, but not a lot of time.”\n\nBy Colin Clark\n\nSpeaking to Breaking Defense, Pat Conroy, defense industry minster, pushed back on the idea the Boeing-made drone would be considered for ISR only.\n\nBy Colin Clark\n\n“You know, gone are the days where we wait for years, and then something gets delivered. What we’ve got now is every nine months there’s going to be a release internally,” Air Commodore Benjamin Sleeman, director-general for integrated air and missile defense, said.\n\nBy Colin Clark\n\n“Singapore, however, will have to somehow de-conflict cooperation with the United States with the digital and cyber cooperation programs it also has with the PRC,” Ian Chong, associate professor at the National University of Singapore, told Breaking Defense.\n\nBy Colin Clark\n\n“The delivery of these uncrewed aerial systems in 2025 … is a significant demonstration of Defence and industry’s strong partnership, and intent to enhance the speed at which we introduce capabilities in support of current and future Defence requirements,” said Australian minister for defense procurement Pat Conroy.\n\nBy Colin Clark\n\n“We’re confident that regardless of who occupies the White House, [AUKUS] will continue to go from strength to strength,” Matt Thistlethwaite, assistant Australian defense minister, told Breaking Defense\n\nBy Colin Clark and Aaron Mehta\n\nThe “Drone Coalition Common Fund” was established within a new Memorandum of Understanding signed by the coalition members that also “provides a framework” for the group’s “core activities.”\n\nBy Colin Clark\n\n“I think we still believe that China … does not create undue areas of friction and tension that can escalate in ways that are unpredictable and dangerous,” Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said.\n\nBy Colin Clark"
