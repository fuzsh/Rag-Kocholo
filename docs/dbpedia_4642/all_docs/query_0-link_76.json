        "meta_description": "Assessing the baseline perfusion and perfusion reserve after acetazolamide (ACZ) challenge is a common method for the evaluation of patients with cerebrovascular disease. Most previous studies using H215O PET applied the bolus injection technique. There is considerable discrepancy regarding the optimal time point of imaging after ACZ injection. The purpose of this study was to continuously monitor cerebral blood flow (CBF) after ACZ using constant-infusion H215O PET. Methods: Four patients with stenoses of an internal carotid artery and 6 with moyamoya disease were studied. H215O was continuously infused, and data were recorded in 1-min frames. After equilibration of H215O, 5 min of baseline data were acquired, and then 1 g of ACZ was administered intravenously and data collection continued for 10–22 min. Arterial blood was continuously drawn for absolute quantification of CBF. Results: The arterial 15O concentration remained generally stable during scanning, and the cerebellar blood flow fluctuations of the 5 baseline scans were small. The scan-to-scan difference was 6% (difference of 2 successive scans/mean). In the nonpathologic areas, the increase in CBF started 1–2 min after administration of ACZ. The largest fraction of the increase occurred from 0 to 10 min. The ratio of CBF in pathologic areas to CBF in cerebellum showed an initial decrease that stabilized after 5 min. Conclusion: A continuous-infusion protocol is a viable alternative to single bolus injections for the assessment of cerebral perfusion status. Such a protocol is advantageous when the time course of CBF after an intervention is not known. With continuous monitoring, the optimal time point for evaluation of a certain parameter can be chosen post hoc. Furthermore, the time course of CBF itself may allow the definition of new parameters for evaluating perfusion status in cerebrovascular patients, both for assessment before a revascularization procedure and for follow-up. A limitation of the present study is the relatively small number of patients with each type of cerebrovascular disease and the lack of healthy subjects.",

        "text": "PET\n\ncerebral blood flow\n\nacetazolamide\n\ncarotid stenosis\n\nmoyamoya disease\n\nAcetazolamide (ACZ) challenge is commonly used to assess perfusion status in patients with cerebrovascular disease (1,2). The increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) after ACZ is often referred to as the perfusion reserve (PR) and is one of the important parameters for assessing perfusion status. In normal gray matter, the ACZ-induced increase in CBF is on the order of 30%–40% (3,4). A decreased PR indicates compromised perfusion. According to the literature, CBF demonstrates a typical response to ACZ. However, there exists a discrepancy with regard to the optimal time point of imaging. Published studies have found that after a rapid increase, a maximum should be reached between 10 and 25 min (5,6) and is followed by a prolonged plateau of more than 30 min (5). These findings suggest that imaging should be performed during that plateau phase. However, Kuwabara et al. found that imaging 5 min after ACZ is superior if a potential early steal phenomenon is not to be missed (7). They also reported that imaging at 5 min is preferable for assessing preoperative CBF changes in patients with occlusive cerebrovascular disease (8). To circumvent this problem of determining the optimal time point, we used constant-infusion H215O PET to continuously monitor the time course of CBF after ACZ in 4 patients with an internal carotid artery stenosis and 6 with moyamoya disease. The name for this disease was coined by Suzuki. It is characterized by abnormal vascular networks at the base of the brain. Moyamoya means “something hazy just like a puff of cigarette smoke drifting in the air” (9). The abnormal vessels are thought to function as collaterals in the presence of stenotic or occlusive lesions at the ends of the internal carotid arteries. The clinical hallmarks of the disease depend on age. Younger patients most often suffer from the consequences of hemodynamic insufficiency, such as transient ischemic attacks. Typically, blood flow is most compromised in the cerebral hemispheres, whereas the cerebellum and the deeper structures are spared."
