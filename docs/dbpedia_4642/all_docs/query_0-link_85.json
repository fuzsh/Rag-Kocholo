        "text": "We sought to imitate angiographic cerebral circulation time (CCT) and create a similar index from baseline CT perfusion (CTP) to better predict vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Forty-one SAH patients with available DSA and CTP were retrospectively included. The vasospasm group was comprised of patients with deterioration in conscious functioning and newly developed luminal narrowing; remaining cases were classified as the control group. The angiography CCT (XA-CCT) was defined as the difference in TTP (time to peak) between the selected arterial ROIs and the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). Four arterial ROIs were selected to generate four corresponding XA-CCTs: the right and left anterior cerebral arteries (XA-CCTRA2 and XA-CCTLA2) and right- and left-middle cerebral arteries (XA-CCTRM2 and XA-CCTLM2). The CCTs from CTP (CT-CCT) were defined as the differences in TTP from the corresponding arterial ROIs and the SSS. Correlations of the different CCTs were cal...\n\nWe investigated the association of multisection CT angiography (MSCTA) and perfusion CT (PCT) for the characterization of vasospasm secondary to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Among 27 patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular vasospasm investigated by digital subtraction angiography (DSA), 18 underwent both cerebral PCT and MSCTA. For the remaining 9, only PCT or MSCTA could be performed. MSCTA was compared with DSA for the detection and characterization of vasospasm on 286 intracranial arterial segments. PCT maps were visually reviewed for mean transit time, relative cerebral blood flow, and relative cerebral blood volume abnormalities and were qualitatively compared with the corresponding regional vasospasm detected by DSA. Vasospasm was grouped into 2 categories: mild-moderate and severe. The depiction of vasospasm by MSCTA showed the best sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy at the level of the A2 and M2 arterial segments (100% for each), in contrast to the carotid sipho...\n\nPurpose:Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) has been performed to predict which patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage are at risk of developing delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Patients with severe arterial narrowing may have significant reduction in perfusion. However, many patients have less severe arterial narrowing. There is a paucity of literature evaluating perfusion changes which occur with mild to moderate narrowing. The purpose of our study was to investigate serial whole-brain CTP/computed tomography angiography in aneurysm-related subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) patients with mild to moderate angiographic narrowing.Methods:We retrospectively studied 18 aSAH patients who had baseline and follow-up whole-brain CTP/computed tomography angiography. Thirty-one regions of interest/hemisphere at six levels were grouped by vascular territory. Arterial diameters were measured at the circle of Willis. The correlation between arterial diameter and change in CTP values, cha...\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate computed tomography perfusion (CTP) during admission baseline period (days 0-3) in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (A-SAH) for development of vasospasm. Retrospective analysis was performed on A-SAH patients from Dec 2004 to Feb 2007 with CTP on days 0-3. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) maps were analyzed for qualitative perfusion deficits. Quantitative analysis was performed using region-of-interest placement to obtain mean CTP values. Development of vasospasm was determined by a multistage hierarchical reference standard incorporating both imaging and clinical criteria. Student&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s t test and threshold analysis were performed. Seventy-five patients were included, 37% (28/75) were classified as vasospasm. Mean CTP values in vasospasm compared to no vasospasm groups were: CBF 31.90 ml/100 g/min vs. 39.88 ml/100 g/min (P &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.05), MTT 7.12 s vs. 5.03 s (P &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.01), and CBV 1.86 ml/100 g vs. 2.02 ml/100 g (P = 0.058). Fifteen patients had qualitative perfusion deficits with 73% (11/15) developed vasospasm. Optimal threshold for CBF is 24-25 mL/100 g/min with 91% specificity and 50% sensitivity, MTT is 5.5 s with 70% specificity and 61% sensitivity and CBV is 1.7 mL/100 g with 89% specificity and 36% sensitivity. These initial results support our hypothesis that A-SAH patients who develop vasospasm may demonstrate early alterations in cerebral perfusion, with statistically significant CBF reduction and MTT prolongation. Overall, CTP has high specificity for development of vasospasm. Future clinical implications include using CTP during the baseline period for early identification of A-SAH patients at high risk for vasospasm to prompt robust preventative measures and treatment.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical value of serial single photon-emission computed tomographic (SPECT) measurements after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: Thirty-two patients were studied prospectively during the first 26 days after SAH with repeated SPECT measurements, clinical examinations, and transcranial Doppler recordings. Time trends were analyzed with a general linear model. A final SPECT measurement was performed after 1 year. RESULTS: A mean of 2.6 (range, 1–5) SPECT measurements revealed a significant (P = 0.001) quadratic curve consistent with initial hypoperfusion and then with hyperperfusion during the acute stage. SPECT findings were significantly associated with transcranial Doppler recordings (P = 0.016) and clinical assessments (P = 0.008). Patients fulfilling clinical and transcranial Doppler criteria for vasospasm demonstrated a more pronounced relative hypoperfusion-hyperperfusion time course. A multivariate logistic regression analysis identifi...\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate disturbance of perfusion and infarct patterns attributable to cerebral vasospasm (CVS) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). One hundred seventeen patients with aneurysmal SAH specifically selected at high risk for CVS were enrolled in this prospective study. One hundred twelve patients underwent surgical (n=63) or endovascular (n=59) therapy. For assessment of CVS, relative diameter changes of proximal and distal vessel segments on follow-up angiography at day 7+/-3 after SAH were analyzed in relation to baseline measurements, and cerebral circulation times were measured. Postprocedure MRI was undertaken selectively at four time points: within 3 days, between days 4 and 6, day 7 to 14, and day 15 to 28 from onset of SAH, including perfusion- and diffusion-weighted images. Procedure-related lesions were excluded and CVS-associated infarct patterns analyzed. Occurrence of angiographic CVS was as high as 87.5% between days 7 and 14 and 52...."
