        "text": "Pay-A$-You-Throw\n\nPay-As-You-Throw (PAYT) is a fee-for-service system that allows residential and commercial customers to pay for the amount of waste they produceinstead of paying a fixed fee or tax for solid waste services. PAYT creates a direct, economic incentive for citizens and businesses to reduce the amount of waste generated, and to increase recycling and composting activities. Communities in Montana that have implemented PAYT systems have realized savings in waste disposal costs.\n\nWhy is PAYT such a great program? Because PAYT can be customized to meet the unique needs of each community and can result in dramatic declines in the amount of waste going into landfills, thereby reducing solid waste costs.\n\nIn 1993, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued new rules for waste disposal which, while designed to minimize pollution from solid waste, increased costs to small communities across Montana. Many small landfill districts in Montana are looking for ways to keep the lid on their waste management costs and PAYT may be the answer.\n\nCan PAYT work in your community? PAYT works in communities that have alternative programs in place for waste management, such as recycling and composting services. The Air, Energy and Pollution Prevention Bureau can help your community research available recycling and composting opportunities so that your community can implement a customized PAYT program.\n\nBozeman's Pay A$ You Throw Program\n\nThe City of Bozeman implemented a Pay-As-You-Throw (PAYT) program in 1991. Bozeman was the first city to try this program in Montana and was the only community with a program in place until the City of Lincoln implemented one in 1995.\n\nBozeman established a PAYT program to extend the life of the landfill and give residents some control over their garbage fees. Residents pay for garbage disposal in two ways under Bozeman's PAYT program. A flat fee or base rate is established by the City Commission and assessed to annual tax bills. This ensures that revenue is generated to cover some basic costs of solid waste services. Residents choose the other payment method and rate depending on the volume of garbage they actually throw away and how much they recycle. PAYT programs usually increase municipal recycling rates by encouraging residents to separate recyclable items from their trash, reducing the volume and costs of the trash they do throw away.\n\nInitially, Bozeman used a tag and bag system that required citizens to purchase tags that were then attached to garbage bags placed for pickup. The tags tracked themselves by how many sold. The city based the estimates and projections for their new PAYT program on how many bags sold. Tags were purchased at City Hall for 20 or 30 pound bags. Roger Sicz, Bozeman's Street and Sanitation Superintendent, noted that it is difficult to estimate the volumes of bags but this risk must be accepted as part of the cost of doing business. Residents disposed of sofas or white goods by estimating the weight and attaching one tag per 30 pounds.\n\nIt took residents time to get used to the new program and the need to stop at City Hall to purchase tags. Some unhappy residents chose to change their garbage service to a private hauler because of the inconvenience. Over time, residents became more familiar with the program and were less frustrated.\n\nNow Bozeman offers residents automated garbage service utilizing multi-sized totes. This makes it more convenient for residents to participate in the City's program. Residents choose either a 35, 65, or 100 gallon sized tote to fit their disposal needs and recycling habits. Bozeman continues to offer the tag/bag system and still sells some tags every year but the automated garbage collection program is more popular.\n\nResidents paying for the 35-gallon tote choose between pick up once per week or pickup just once per month with fees scaled accordingly. Households choosing once per month pickup use a different colored lid on their tote, which is set out the first week of every month. The City does not offer once per month pick up for the 65 and 100-gallon totes.\n\nHouseholds base their tote size choices on family size, buying habits, and the amount of waste they recycle. Bozeman has six organizations offering drop-off recycling services to residents. Bozeman does not offer curbside pickup of recyclables. Organizations include small volunteer nonprofits offering aluminum can recycling as part of their fundraising efforts, larger nonprofit cooperatives specializing in recycling services, and recycling businesses collecting diverse materials.\n\nRecycling is an essential part of a successful Pay-As-You-Throw program because it gives residents choices regarding the amount of waste they throw away. Communities considering PAYT need to establish recycling opportunities before or at the same time that PAYT is implemented. Communities with recycling already available often see participation rates increase when volume-based pricing is established.\n\nRoger Sicz, former Street and Sanitation Superintendent, states that \"Waste volumes definitely decreased due to more recycling and the life of the landfill was extended somewhat. However private haulers also dump in the landfill and we don't know how much their customers participate in recycling because their bills are not tied to the volume of trash they throw away. But we know recycling rates have increased and I believe that people are also practicing source reduction at the point of purchase.\"\n\nFor more information on Bozeman's Pay-As-You-Throw program, call the City of Bozeman at 406-582-2332.

Traditional PAYT programs are a fee-for-service system that allows residential and commercial customers to pay for the amount of waste they produce instead of paying a fixed fee or tax for solid waste services. PAYT is attractive because it creates a direct, economic incentive for citizens and businesses to reduce the amount of waste generated, and to increase recycling and composting activities.\n\nLewis and Clark County's program was modified so that participants will not see a major change in the way they pay for solid waste disposal and will continue to pay the assessment fee through their taxes. This assessment fee from 1993 through 1998 was maintained at the same level. Participants experienced their first fee increase in six years when the County increased the fee by 5.4% in 1999. County officials hope that by implementing PAYT they can avoid or delay further fee increases because the program will ensure that all participants are paying their fair share for waste disposal. As the program matures officials will be able to determine if fee adjustments (up or down) are warranted.\n\nIn preparation for effective decision-making, the county implemented a permit system in 1995 and started gathering the data needed to assess accurate fees for waste disposal. Permits were assigned to each homeowner and business and the county began to track the amount of garbage disposed of by individual permit holders. Will Selser, Solid Waste Manager for Lewis and Clark County, explained that a voluntary limit of two-tons (4,000 pounds) per year was established and originally worked just fine. Eventually the amount being disposed of increased and it became apparent that some participants were generating more than the two tons of waste for which fees were assessed. In fact, the County determined that approximately 14% of permit holders disposed of more than two tons annually. In 1999, the District paid $124,000 to cover the disposal of this extra waste.\n\nSelser stated that after examining all the data, the district chose to implement a modified PAYT program with an enforceable limit of two tons per year and strict enforcement of the requirement for permits to be shown before access to the transfer station or landfill. In the past, attendants were more flexible, but strict adherence to the permit policy is necessary to accurately assess fees and ensure that permit holders are charged only for waste they generate. Anyone without a permit may return later with the permit or may choose to pay a minimum of $9.50 (400-lbs. maximum) to dispose of their load right away.\n\nA credit of two tons per permit holder will be carefully tracked and attendants will issue a warning as permittees approach the upper limit. Upon exceeding the limit, another warning is mailed to the property owner and any additional waste is charged at the rate of 2.4 cents per pound. For billing purposes, the permit year will change to a fiscal year ending on June 30th. Invoices for waste charges beyond the two-ton credit will be mailed out after the end of the fiscal year. Any invoices left unpaid by the due date will be placed on the property's tax notice as unpaid debt.\n\nThe Scratchgravel Solid Waste District's PAYT program includes all county residents except those in East Helena, Augusta, Lincoln and Helena. Helena officials hope to implement a PAYT program in the future and the City of Lincoln has had one in place for several years.\n\nFor more information on Lewis and Clark County's program contact Sherrel Rhys at 406-227-1189. For information on PAYT and implementing a program in your community, contact Dusti Johnson, Recycling and Marketing Development Specialist, at 406-841-5253.\n\nScales Not Needed For PAYT Programs\n\nThe benefit of scales to weigh waste no doubt contributed to the ability of Lewis and Clark County to accurately track tonnage per permit holder and establish baselines for beginning a PAYT program. However, other communities in Montana have successfully implemented PAYT programs without the expensive scales that are often cost-prohibitive to smaller communities.\n\nLincoln's program has been a model for other communities such as Sanders and Granite Counties. Waste from Lincoln is collected at a container site and transported to Great Falls for disposal. The attendant at the container site uses a hand-held tri-corder to scan bar codes on cards held by users of the site. The codes contain information such as the property identification number used by the county for tax assessment.\n\nTri-corders cost approximately $1,000 at computer supply stores and are an inexpensive way for communities to gather data and charge fees according to the amount of waste disposed of by individual users. Computer software packages can be purchased to assist with compiling data, generating annual disposal rates of users and determining annual fees.\n\nLack of scales does not prevent Lincoln from tracking the amount of waste being disposed of by individual users. The attendant uses general volume guidelines to estimate and manually enter the amount of waste per user into the tri-corder. For example, a conventional garbage can is estimated to hold about .15 yard. A short-bed pickup with the load rising a little above the sides would hold about 2 yards and a long-bed pickup would hold about 2.5 yards. Six garbage bags would hold about a yard. In 1998, Laura Nicolai (at that time an employee of the Lincoln Refuse District) stated that the estimation system was remarkably accurate. Estimates were within about 100 cubic yards per year or equivalent to a 1% variation, as shown by the amount of waste actually deposited in the containers.\n\nRaise Money and Compete for Prizes\n\nAluminum, Paper & Cardboard\n\nMoney can still be made from recycling aluminum cans, paper, and usually but-not-always, cardboard. Prices do fluctuate in response to changing market conditions.\n\nSort and separate recyclables according to grade – this increases the value of the recyclables and should result in a higher price for your collected commodities.\n\nBe aware that choosing a single-stream or co-mingled program which does not require sorting, will also generate less revenue.\n\nIf producing consistently “clean” (i.e., no unwanted materials included) recyclables, work with your local recycler to obtain premium prices for the material you provide.\n\nWhen contracting for services, tie the prices paid to current, published prices. For instance, include contract language that guarantees a return of 80 percent of current prices as listed on the Yellow Board, American Metals Market, and similar commodity markets. You may ask for copies of the publication showing regional and national prices referenced for that particular sale.\n\nTerraCycle\n\nTerraCycle offers national programs (\"Brigades\") to collect previously non-recyclable or hard-to-recycle waste. Most programs offer a donation for each item collected for recycling, in addition to free shipping.\n\nMany programs to choose from;\n\nWebsite has pictures of the products manufactured from the recyclables;\n\nNo fee (in most cases);\n\nFree shipping;\n\nCan recruit business partners and citizens to have collection boxes and designate your school to receive the proceeds;\n\nBrigades available: drink pouches, plastic bags, Kraft Cheeses, Neosporin Tubes, Aveeno Beauty containers, candy cookie wrappers, cereal bags,and much more. All pay about 2 cents per item.\n\nReturning Electronics for Cash\n\nThe following program offers the following features:\n\n13 yrs and older can register to sell products;\n\nMust be able to answer questions about item’s condition;\n\nSearches Internet to find best prices (similar to travel sites);\n\nAllows comparison of offers;\n\nDoes NOT accept non-working items for recycling; but will find recycling locations near you;\n\nItems entered one at a time; and\n\n‘Our Impact’ button leads to information about best-selling items and brands.\n\nPrinter Cartridges\n\nSome printer cartridge recyclers will also collect cell phones, but you may get more in return from a business specializing in cell phone refurbishment.\n\nStaples\n\nCollect spent printer cartridges and take them to Staples for a $3 reward. Just sign up for a Staples reward account and check with your local stor to verify the acceptable cartridges and get details. (The Staples website quotes a $2 reward, but the a Montana store confirmed a $3 reward.)Staples recently changed their program to allow one account holder to drop off no more than 10 cartridges per month.\n\nRecycle printer cartridges and accumulate points to acquire equipment and supplies, although you can choose to receive a check instead. FundingFactory also accepts cell phones, but better prices may be realized through a business specializing in cell phone refurbishment. FundingFactory offers FREE shipping materials, promotional and business support supplies, live customer service representatives and your own online account. FundingFactory also holds contests for additional bonuses and prizes.\n\nNo signup fees;\n\nFree container;\n\nFree tools and marketing material;\n\nCash returned, not a points program;\n\nPrices are published on their website to see what you will be paid;\n\nMust include pricing list with shipment; and,\n\n$15 penalty for any laser cartridges received.\n\nSource Reduction and Consumer Spending\n\nWe currently produce and consume goods at an unprecedented rate. The process starts with extracting raw materials and ends with disposing of used products. The result?\n\nresource depletion\n\npollution\n\nloss of valuable habitat\n\nwaste management problems, and often\n\nsocial and environmental injustice\n\nConsuming less, and reusing or remanufacturing products can cut waste and the need for disposal.\n\nWatch The Story of Stuff for an insightful and entertaining explanation of the far-reaching effects of our daily decisions.

Such links are not endorsements of any products or services in such sites and no information in such sites has been endorsed or approved by the Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nDaily Habits:\n\nIf you can’t recycle it – don’t buy it. Avoid purchasing goods that you know will end up in the garbage. For instance, bottled water – if you can’t recycle plastic bottles in your town, avoid buying bottled water and carry a reusable water bottle instead.\n\nBuy durable goods. If your budget will allow it, consider purchasing more durable goods. They may be more expensive initially, but they will last longer and are generally better quality.\n\nSwap and Trade. Look for opportunities to network with friends and co-workers to obtain needed tools, materials, or goods to avoid purchasing an item that you’ll only use once or twice.\n\nVisit garage sales and second-hand stores.\n\nUse online swap groups, such as:\n\nFreecycle.org\n\nBookmooch.com\n\nBusinesses can use theMontana Materials Exchange to list unwanted materials or look for needed materials. This Montana State University Extension Service Program encourages recovery and reuse of diverse materials that would otherwise be discarded.\n\nDo without. Do youreally need that new video game, book, knick-knack or trinket? Can you enjoy it without having one of your own? Control impulse-buying by walking away first and giving yourself time to evaluate whether you really need something or just want it because it struck your fancy.\n\nHomes\n\nDo you recycle at home? Do you know what can be recycled in your town?\n\nMany people love Montana’s wide open spaces and the small town atmosphere that exists even in our larger cities. Montanans appreciate the lack of crowds, rush hour traffic, and industrial smoke stacks found in more populated and more industrialized areas of the U.S.\n\nWhat does this have to do with recycling? Well, the same things that make Montana the special and uniquely beautiful place that it is, also make full-scale and wide-spread recycling difficult. Because of Montana’s low population and the fact that major industrial centers are long distances away, collecting recyclables and shipping them to markets in other states can make programs expensive to implement and maintain. These challenges can be addressed and many communities in Montana offer recycling programs for certain commodities, such as aluminum cans, bi-metal cans, newspaper, cardboard, and magazines.\n\nEven communities without organized recycling programs often have some outlets for recycling certain commodities. To find out what can be recycled in your town, DEQ suggests:\n\nContact your local public works department.\n\nVisit theEarth911.comwebsite. Just type in your zip code to find recycling locations and learn what and where to recycle near you. If there is no local recycling, the site lists the nearest recycling centers.\n\nVisit theRecycle Montana website. This organization maintains a website listing locations across Montana that accept certain materials for recycling.\n\nRecycling is just one way to reduce the amount of trash you throw away. Source Reduction means taking steps to reduce the amount of trash you generate in the first place. Consider using the following strategies to generate less trash:\n\nBuy in bulk.\n\nBuy only what you need.\n\nStop Junk Mail.\n\nChoose recyclable packaging. (If plastic is not recycled in your town, and aluminum cans are, buy soda cans instead of plastic bottles.)\n\nLearn more about source reduction at the EPA website.\n\nBozeman's Tag and Bag Systems\n\nBozeman now has curbside recycling available and no longer has a landfill within City limits. The program described here no longer exists, but may still be duplicated by interested communities. To find out more, click Contact Us below. A Recycling & Marketing Development Specialist will be in touch to assist you.\n\nCommunities often choose this system to save implementation costs associated with purchasing garbage containers of diverse sizes. Another advantage of the tag and bag system is that it allows residents to continue with a familiar practice (using garbage bags) while introducing them to the concept of paying for just what they throw away.\n\nDisposal fees are often \"hidden\" on property tax assessments or may be seen as a flat rate on water bills. Residents, when asked, often do not know the amount of money they spend on garbage disposal by the month or the year. By purchasing tags and not hiding the costs, residents see both the real costs of garbage disposal services as well as the financial impacts of their own purchasing and disposal habits.\n\nSchools\n\nSchool Laboratory Chemical Clean-Outs\n\nGardens from Garbage - Great Falls Schools\n\nMany resources exist for teachers wishing to discuss and encourage recycling. The nonprofit, Recycle Montana, advocates for increased recycling and sponsors a classroom education program.\n\nIn addition to these programs, educators and school administrators will find the following resources helpful: Manual for Implementing a School Recycling Program .\n\nClean Air Zone Montana\n\nThis program discourages school bus idling to reduce diesel exhaust exposure for children.

This activity has taken on considerable momentum in recent years. Glass recycling has grown more rapidly than that of any other commodity except aluminum beverage containers. Montana is still trying to establish infrastructure for recycling in general. Glass is only a small part of a larger problem that Montana faces in regard to recycling. Currently glass has a small and limited market, especially in Montana.\n\nGlass is 100 percent recyclable but brings many challenges to Montana because of our low population. This works against us in that we do not generate \"enough\" glass to lure glass bottling plants to Montana and we do not produce enough consumer glass to be an effective source for a full scale recycling program. The challenge of not having bottling plants close to Montana requires shipping glass out of state. The transportation costs to ship recyclables hundreds of miles for processing is often cost-prohibitive. These two factors push glass into the aggregate market as a low value commodity. The equipment used to process the glass is very expensive and many businesses cannot produce enough glass cullet (recycled container glass) to pay for the expense of operation.\n\nGlass Facts\n\nGlass constituted 5.5 percent of the U.S. municipal solid waste stream by weight and 1.5 percent by volume. An estimated generation of glass for Montana in 2007 was 47,893 tons.\n\nGlass is heavy and weighs 2,800 lbs per yard.\n\nAll glass food and beverage containers can be recycled.\n\nRecycling a glass jar saves enough energy to light 100-watt light bulb for 4 hours or power a computer for 25 minutes.\n\nRecycling glass instead of making it from silica sand reduces mining waste by 70 percent, water use by 50 percent, and air pollution by 20 percent.\n\nFor every 96 tons of recycled container glass used, one ton of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is reduced.\n\nMarkets and Manufacturers\n\nContainer glass is the highest and best use for glass cullet. Other consuming markets include filtration, sand blasting, fiberglass and decorative items.\n\nContainer manufacturers need clean glass cullet and are interested in using more in their manufacturing processes. Some of the manufacturers are finding it hard to receive quality clean cullet because of single stream recycling.\n\nThe U.S. is home to 50 glass factories in 23 states.\n\nMarket Challenges for Wyoming Glass Recycling\n\nHealth Facts\n\nGlass is pH neutral\n\nNo known problems associated with incompatibility with other chemicals\n\nNo known acute or chronic effects from overexposure to glass cullet\n\nGlass does not cause silicosis\n\nIt is important to recycle glass along with other recyclables. However creating a recycling program offers many challenges. In order to achieve a successful long-term recycling program, Montana needs to: create a strong infrastructure, establish efficient, affordable and convenient collection systems, and to develop \"markets\" for recyclables.\n\nEven with these overwhelming challenges, the staff at the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) works hard to increase recycling opportunities, to develop markets for the recyclables collected here, and to increase public awareness of current recycling opportunities.\n\nAnnual Savings & Greenhouse Gas Impacts from Recycling\n\nRecycled Savings per Consumed Product Recovered Glass\n\n(Tons)\n\nBTUs\n\n(Millions)\n\nOil\n\n(Barrels) Greenhouse Gases\n\n(Tons)\n\nTrees\n\n(Count)\n\nElectricity\n\n(KWh)\n\nWater\n\n(Gallons)\n\nLandfill Diversion 3,000 10,799 1,982 320 51,000 12,300,000 21,000,000 111,000 10,000 35,996 6,605 1,066 170,000 41,000,000 70,000,000 370,000\n\nContamination is the Killer in Glass Recycling\n\nThe amazing thing about glass is that it is 100 percent recyclable. It does not wear out and can be recycled over and over again without any reduction in the quality of new glass products. All types of glass have different chemical make-ups that alter their capability to be recycled. Container glass is the only glass that can be turned into cullet to be sold back to bottling plants for the use of furnace-ready cullet. Glass manufacturers have extremely high standards, any foreign material that makes it past the glass recycling processing equipment can cause imperfections in containers, making it potently unsafe to the consumer. This is a big liability concern for the glass manufacturer. The success of glass recycling depends on good quality glass coming back for processing, free from contamination.\n\nWhat Contaminates Glass?\n\nSome glass products are not suitable for recycling. They contain heavy metal oxides that can contaminate recycled glass and result in imperfection and poor quality product. Even the smallest amount of contamination will alter the chemistry of glass recycling, making the final product unusable. Contaminants include:\n\nCeramics (dinner plates, coffee mugs)\n\nWindow glass & mirrors\n\nPlastic, tin, aluminum lids/tabs\n\nPyrex glass\n\nWired glass\n\nCrystal & drinking glasses\n\nLight bulbs or tubes\n\nExample of ceramic contamination.\n\nJust one ounce of ceramic can contaminate a whole ton of glass. The whole ton of glass then has to go to the landfill, because there is no way to efficiently separate out the contamination.\n\nExample of iron contamination\n\nMany people wonder why there are three colors used in the manufacturing of glass bottles. The reason is a simple. Most products are placed in clear bottles, called flint, to enhance product appeal. However, some products degrade if exposed to sunlight. Bottling companies make green or amber (brown) glass to enable longer product shelf life. This is why bottling plants only accept one of the three colors for processing. There is no special equipment to separate glass into three colors, so separation is done by hand. This may be performed by the recycler collecting the glass or by the public dropping off glass at separating bins. Rinsing containers to remove traces of food and beverages helps with odors that attract insects and rodents. Also, be careful not to break the containers when depositing the glass into collection bins, this ensures better safety for yourself and recycling workers. Quality control is a job we must all perform!\n\nPlease only deposit glass bottles and jars in the recycling bins!\n\nGlass Pulverizer\n\nAt one time, a mobile glass pulverizer, owned by Headwaters Cooperative Recycling, helped meet some of the challenges regarding recycling glass in Montana. The pulverizer processed scrap glass into cullet (aggregate) which was appropriate for the uses described below. Unfortunately, Headwaters closed down and the pulverizer was sold to an out-of-state buyer. That mobile pulverizer is no longer available. However, several other pulverizers are in operation in Montana.\n\nHow it operated:\n\nThe pulverizer was mounted on a trailer with a generator powered by biodiesel. The pulverizer produced 3/8-inch and 1/8-inch minus cullet. Cullet is reduced glass that resembles gravel or fine sand.\n\nBelow are some of the potential uses for glass cullet:\n\nThe 1/8-inch minus glass cullet (fine sand) can be used in bunkers on golf courses. It forms an abrasive dry layer on the land surface, thereby creating conditions that can deter earthworms and add stability. Inter-particle friction is relatively high, making glass sand less susceptible than rounded natural sands to particle interpacking and compaction. It also improves drainage.\n\nGlass cullet as a fluxing agent in brick manufacturing\n\nIn brick manufacturing, the principal raw material is clay supplemented with other materials such as sand, stains and select minerals. Recent research suggests that brick firing temperatures can be reduced by up to 100 degrees Celsius when glass is added at a rate of 10 percent by weight to the clay mix.\n\nGlass cullet as a granular base material\n\nPulverized and screened glass cullet can be used as a granular base material. Recent studies of glass aggregate properties suggest that properly processed waste glass is well suited for use as a granular base material.\n\nThe Northern Plains Resource Council, located in Billings, used glass cullet in their parking lot, using the pave2 www.invisiblestructures.com recycled pad as the base with glass cullet as the filler.\n\nGlass cullet use in septic tank drain fields\n\nSand filters are part of a non-proprietary anaerobic septic treatment system in which the sand acts as a mechanical and biological filter. Research suggests that using crushed recycled glass in place of sand may lower construction costs and improve the overall performance of the treatment system. A subdivision built in the Helena area used glass cullet instead of sand and gravel in the filter septic treatment system.\n\nGlass cullet as landscaping material\n\nThe pulverizer’s processing method, which removes sharp edges of recycled glass to produce a safe alternative to gravel, sand and other landscape materials, has allowed glass cullet to become a high-profile design element. From rooftop gardens and pathways to hotel lobbies and private homes, cullet is replacing gray river rock with a splash of color. The Helena YMCA used glass cullet for paths around its community gardens.\n\nThe DEQ works hard to explore opportunities to recycle glass locally. The department recognizes that expensive hauling costs prohibit recycling programs that rely on out-of-state markets to pay for collected glass. Instead, as with other recyclables, Montana must encourage local businesses or programs to utilize collected materials. Such local businesses or “markets” contribute to cost-effective recycling programs and avoid expenses related to shipping recyclables out of state to industrial processors.\n\nObjective\n\nThe Montana Department of Environmental Quality’s long term objective is to have market development projects establish local glass recycling opportunities. As stated earlier, transportation of glass over long distances for processing makes finding local uses vital to glass recycling in Montana. DEQ’s hopes are to showcase pilot projects to provide credibility that recycled glass cullet can be used in a wide variety of applications that will stimulate demand for the product, and offer a sustainable solution to rural glass recycling. These local markets make a significant impact on the glass cullet market value, especially for added value applications.\n\nThe following are examples of pilot projects throughout Montana communities using recycled glass cullet.\n\nNorthern Plains Resource Council Glass Parking lot, located in Billings, at 220 South 27th Street.\n\nThe parking lot was designed for water conservation. The recycled glass cullet (3/8-inch-minus in size) was placed on a grid of geotextile fabric, which holds the glass cullet in place and allows water to permeate the ground, rather than running into the city’s storm drains.\n\nThe DEQ and the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) teamed up to use 1,000 tons of recycled glass from the Boulder landfill in a road project known as the \"Curve,\" northeast of Whitehall. Specifications were written to allow the use of the pulverized glass in a 10 percent uniform pugmill-mix for the base course. The project was very successful and the contractor is willing to use the product for future road projects.\n\nMDT Road Project: Whitehall, Montana\n\nEliminate: An onsite Wastewater Treatment Company, located in Belgrade (below)\n\nEliminate is incorporating glass cullet into the coating of its proprietary product: MetaRocks. These rocks provide for nitrogen reduction and overall advanced wastewater treatment. This innovative and environmentally sound practice has given a green spin to the treatment and disposal of waste water.\n\nBillings Fly Ash & Recycled Glass Cullet Project\n\nThis project used recycled glass and fly ash as a unique alternative to a standard concrete floor. The High Plains Architects new office building located in Billings had this beautiful floor installed. The floor is composed entirely of pulverized glass and Class 'C' fly ash. There is no gravel, sand, or Portland cement in the two-inch topping slab. The concrete, which has a buff color without any added pigments, was batched by Knife River. After a short curing period, the two-inch topping slab was ground by ProCrete, revealing the multi-colored glass cullet. Finally, the slab was sealed with soy-based finish from Refuge Sustainable Building Center.\n\nThe floor is one of many green building features in the 2,000-square foot space built by Tim Davis Construction. High Plains Architects anticipates receiving LEED Platinum certification from the U.S. Green Building Council for the project.\n\nMissoula Federal Credit Union Project, Missoula\n\nThis is a ground-breaking project with far reaching environmental benefits. It could potentially help change the way construction is approached worldwide. This building will be replacing traditional Portland cement, both structurally (i.e., footings, foundations, slabs, sidewalks, driveways, exterior classing panels, countertops, and flooring) and aesthetically. This will be the first known building in the world to replace all concrete with recycled glass and fly ash. This new cutting-edge mixture of glass and fly ash helps conserve resources. Traditional concrete production is estimated to consume about 10 percent of the world’s resources.\n\nThe commercial building (6,711 square feet) used more than 1,000 tons of glass and fly ash in the project. The building sets the mark in saving energy and resources.\n\nHayfield Subdivision in Helena\n\nSand filters are part of a non-proprietary anaerobic septic treatment system in which the sand acts as a mechanical and biological filter. Research suggests that using crushed recycled glass in place of sand may lower construction costs and improve the overall performance of the treatment system. Engineers working on the project for a new subdivision in Helena worked on final approval to replace the sand and gravel used in the sand filter septic treatment system with the glass cullet.\n\nHayfield has used cullet as septic tank drain field and drain pipe bedding instead of sand\n\nThe Importance of Plastic\n\nPlastics are modern, synthetic materials. Plastics are oil and gas based, and consume less than four per cent of our oil and gas reserves. The superior properties of plastics, such as their hygiene (clean or free from disease causing microorganisms), their fluid and air barrier capacities, and their light weight and durability contribute significantly to our health and quality of life. The tremendous growth of the plastics industry is expected to continue. The factors that have contributed to this growth include the energy efficiency of plastic. All studies show that it takes less energy to make a product from plastics than just about any other material. As plastics continue to demonstrate that they are a safe and reliable alternative to traditional materials, new applications will emerge.\n\nWhy are there so many different types of plastics?\n\nThe reason is that the actual type of plastic used is determined by the demands of the application. For example, if the plastic bottle needs to be squeezable, like a mustard bottle, then it’s going to be made of a different plastic from one that doesn’t need to be squeezable, like a milk jug.\n\nAll plastics are not created equal. Some seal in moisture or seal out air more effectively than others. Some are stronger, some lighter, some easier to work with, and some are more economical than other plastics to process. Each plastic type brings a unique blend of properties to the packaging design table and has been engineered to package a particular type of product. For example, PET plastic or \"1\" plastic, has been specially designed to help soft drinks remain carbonated. This plastic has been designed for an excellent gas and moisture barrier, making it the ideal choice for other applications as well, such as edible oils and salad dressings.\n\nRecycling Plastics\n\nThe Department of Environmental Quality promotes recycling and works to develop markets for recyclables within the state. Recycling of all plastic bottles is strongly encouraged, primarily PET 1 and HDPE 2 bottles, because there are well-established end-markets for these types of plastics. Markets for recyclables are the key to recycling success. By building these new markets for other types of plastics, the ease of recycling for all types of plastic will be as available as those for HDPE 2.\n\nDeveloping local businesses or markets for recyclables is key to successful long-term recycling in Montana. Establishing local markets for recycled materials is important for a number of reasons, including: reduced need to transport collected materials over long distances; reduced need to import raw materials and end products; expansion of the local manufacturing sector; creation of employment opportunities; preservation of natural resources; and expansion of the local tax base.\n\nWhy Is Recycling Plastics Important?\n\nRecycling and reuse of plastics have the obvious benefit of decreasing the amount of used plastics that end up in landfills. With increased plastics recycling, fewer natural resources need to be extracted to produce virgin plastic. Producing new plastic from recycled material uses only two-thirds of the energy required to manufacture it from virgin raw materials. Five two-liter recycled PET bottles produce enough fiberfill to make a ski jacket; 36 recycled bottles can make one square yard of carpet.\n\nIn addition, a great amount of plastic waste is found in the world's oceans. \"The world now uses 230 million pounds of plastic annually ... much of this is for one-trip packaging that is thrown out within a year of production, on average. Because the plastic that enters the ocean tends to fragment, it is likely to remain in the environment for hundreds, if not thousands, of years,” notes Richard Thompson, a researcher at Plymouth University, U.K., who has published two studies on plastics in oceans and the effect on marine animals.\n\nHow You Can Recycle Plastics\n\nRecycle Your Plastics - This site is designed to offer an easy-to-use gateway for information on plastics recycling.\n\nVisit Where To Recycle or go to www.Earth911.org to find out what kinds of plastics can be recycled in your area.\n\nFollow these tips when Recycling Plastics\n\nRinse your bottles.\n\nRemove caps from bottles. Caps are made from a different kind of plastic and contaminate the plastic.\n\nStomping your plastic bottles before placing the crushed bottles in the proper recycling bins will save your community money. So STOMP IT!\n\nCheck with your recycler to see what kinds of plastic the business handles and only put the kinds of plastics your recycler accepts in the bin. Also, unless your recycler asks for more than bottles, only place bottles in recycling containers.\n\nDEQ staff provide assistance to local and state government employees wishing to learn more about reducing waste, recycling more, and using natural resources wisely.
