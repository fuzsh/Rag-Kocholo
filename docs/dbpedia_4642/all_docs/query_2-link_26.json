Where most people fall short is in the follow-up: nurturing connections over time, prioritizing them, staying in touch, finding ways to deepen those relationships, and ultimately giving back.\n\nAs I discuss in my e-book Stand Out Networking and in my LinkedIn Learning Professional Networking course, it’s nice that you connected with someone online after you met them at a cocktail party, but if that’s the end of it, they’re not actually a connection. In fact, in a month or two, you may see an online contact and wonder, Who was that, again? Here are three strategies to make your follow-up far more effective and turn casual connections into real relationships.\n\nPrioritize. Networking, when done well, is about making tough choices. We can’t prioritize everyone; focusing on everyone means focusing on no one. Ideally, we concentrate on people we genuinely like and would enjoy spending time with, people we can learn from, and (sometimes) people who are in a similar enough professional orbit that we can help them and they can help us. As long as you truly like and value your prioritized contacts, that’s not disingenuous; that’s what friendship is.\n\nMy friend Keith Ferrazzi, author of the famed networking book Never Eat Alone, suggests taking the time to develop a Relationship Action Plan and categorizing your contacts based on how well you know them: 3 is a trusted contact, 2 is an acquaintance, 1 is someone you’ve met, 0 is for people you don’t know, and -1 is for people with whom you have a strained relationship. Ask yourself: Who do you want to spend time with, rather than simply letting networking happen to you?\n\nSet a Schedule. Once you’ve prioritized your contacts, set a schedule to check in with them regularly. Maybe you want to get in touch with your top contacts at the start of every month, or you might prefer to talk to a few per week. Do what’s most comfortable for you. If your priority list is very small, a simple calendar reminder might be enough; if you want to keep in touch with more people, you might consider a contact management system to help you keep track.\n\nAs you expand your network over time, you may discover that the group you keep in close touch with this year may look very different two years from now. Allow people to fluidly move in and out of your core group, but don’t lose sight of them. Maybe someone you contact on a monthly basis becomes someone you contact once every three months; that’s OK and normal. The key is staying in close enough touch so that they don’t forget you.\n\nCreate Tiers. You can keep in touch with your contacts in different ways, and at different intensity levels. In Stand Out Networking, I profile marketing expert Michael Katz, who practices a four-step approach to contacting his network, carefully matching frequency to priority. To his general email list, he sends out a biweekly email newsletter, reminding them about his services through the advice and stories he shares. Second, he has a smaller circle of approximately 350 clients, prospects, and other people he wants to keep in closer touch with. “I e-mail them systematically and frequently,” Katz says. “No agenda, no sales objective. I just stay in touch with personal messages.”\n\nThird, he leverages the truly old-fashioned power of snail mail to send out cards to 100 key contacts. “Nobody gets snail mail anymore (except for junk and bills), so they really stand out,” he says. “They’re so retro, they’re cutting-edge. I’ve had people call me up to thank me. Amazing!” Finally, he has at least one face-to-face meeting each week. His strategy ensures he’s keeping in light touch with almost everyone he knows, but is reaching his most important contacts more regularly and in greater depth.\n\nWhatever your follow-up strategy, the key is applying it regularly. Your network determines the opportunities you’re exposed to. Developing robust connections will pay dividends, both personal and professional, for the rest of your life.\n\nDorie Clark is a keynote speaker, marketing strategist, and executive coach who teaches at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business.
