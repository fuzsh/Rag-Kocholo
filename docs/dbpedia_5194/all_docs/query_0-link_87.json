        "text": "Hi,\n\nthis site is about my bicycle trip from my now hometown Katrineholm, Sweden to COP26 in Glasgow, Scootland, Great Britain.\n\nWhy was I biking to the COP26? In short: It is a sustainable way to travel and I hope, I can make a difference by biking all the way as a 71-year-old. I hope, the political leaders of the world will understand, that they have to act now, when a 70+ year old woman is coming by bike. I know, it is a dream, but sometimes dreams come true and if I do not try, I can never change anything.\n\nWhat means COP26? COP is a shortening for UN Climate Change Conference and the no 26 is for, because it is how it is count. You can read more about COP26 by following the link. The COP 21 was held in Paris from 30th November to 12th December 2015. Negotiations resulted in the adoption of the Paris Agreement on 12th December, governing climate change reduction measures from 2020. In real, not much has changed in benefit for the climate.\n\nWhen and where did I start? I started 1st September 2021 in Katrineholm, Sweden.\n\n.\n\n1st SEPTEMBER 2021\n\nKatrineholm – Norrköping; 77 km; host: Peder af Geijerstam (warmshowers)\n\nAfter month of preparations and looking for travel buddies, it finally was time to start the ride. The plan was to use “warmshowers” and “couchsurfing” for the overnight stays. Even this a sustainable way to travel. There were some hosts, who already had invited me and that felt good. Other hosts I have to find on the way. Most hosts does not like requests more than a week in advance and a lot of hosts are happy about last-minute-requests as well. Though, I had my fingers crossed, that I wanted to find hosts in every town or village with overnight stays. – I did not find any travel buddies, but that did not really matter, because I am used to traveling by my own.\n\nBy the way, it is too dangerous to ride the Highway 55 between Katrineholm and Norrköping by bike, therefore I had to ride around 70 km instead for 40 km, using minor roads.\n\nI thought, I need to charge my bike battery around halfway av my day-trip, but actually it was not necessary by using assistance level 2 and 3 most of the time.\n\nIt was a wonderful day, biking on small roads enjoying nature and even some deer crossing the road. I came close to the home av MaryAnn, my vegetable supplier, but not close enough to greet her. Once I used the forest as a bathroom, the other time I found a rest area. There were some camper vans as well and I had to trust that the travelers won’t take anything and they didn’t. I imagine, that people with camper vans have so much money, that they are not interested in stealing.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI used maps.me most of the day, but when the app told me, that I have to take a fenced and closed road, I switched to Google Maps. It worked fine, because I was already close enough to my goal for the day – to Norrköping.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBy the way, my smartphone run out of charge, though I took a rest and charged it by my power-bank – enough for being able to continue, meanwhile I had a snack. At that time I was in an old village, called Virå bruk.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLater, I made a stop to message my host, that I soon will arrive and by that, I read an email message of a journalist, working in Norrköping. He was interested in, to write about my trip. We agreed to meet the next day. By the way, in Katrineholm no journalist did met me in the city-park, but I had hoped. Nearly outside, I met a woman of my circle of acquaintances, who was on her daily walk, stopped by and wished me good luck on my travel. I was very happy about it. Luckily, I have had friends at home for some days. They left today. Before they left, they did take photos of me.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIt was a little difficult to reach my hosts home because of street work, which parted his street. Finally I found my way and his address. Peder did take my bike up into his apartment on the third floor for security reasons and you have to know, that the house does not have an elevator. He also carried my big bags up. I only tog my cooler bag and a cotton bag with groceries, which was not even filled to the top. Close after showing me his apartment, especially the bathroom and the kitchen, he had to work online for an hour again. I think it is amazing, how he lays the jigsaw without being stressed. In the contrary, he was calm and very nice.\n\nDuring dinner, which was a salad with beans, carrots and rice as a side dish – as simple it was as delicious it was, we talked about our travels, of course and were going to sleep around 10pm, because we had to be up early the upcoming day.\n\n.\n\n2nd September 2021\n\nNorrköping – Linköping; 48 km; host: Heinz Ericson (warmshowers)\n\nWe took an early good-bye after Peder had carried down my panniers and my bike. I had plenty of time to fasten my panniers on my bike, even he already had left for work. I also ate a banana and had a mouth full of a cold coffee drink from a bottle.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAfterwards I was going to the city center. I stayed on S:t Pedersgatan / corner Gamla Rådstugugatan on a bench with my bike close to me. It was only +10°C, though it was a little cold, but it may become worse soon. I waited for an email from a reporter av Folkbladet, which I have got soon. He asked me, if 10am would be fine for an interview. It was only 8:30am, though I asked him, if it was possible to meet earlier and explained the situation for him. Meanwhile I was waiting for him I really needed a bathroom. A driving school, right at this corner was already open and I was allowed to use their bathroom, having my bike directly in front of one of their big windows. The assistant at the counter agreed to have an eye on it. Though I was ready to meet the reporter and we met at 9:30am. After the interview I asked him to email his text to me before publishing and told him my bad experiences from Katrineholm and Gnesta. He accepted my wish and luckily sent me the text in the afternoon, because there were two wrong facts in it. He promised to correct them. He also had taken some photographs with a Canon system camera – even when I was cycling.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nGoing by bike to Linköping should have been very easy, but I had head wind most of the time. The landscape was not as flat as I remembered. Therefore I got concerned about my battery – using much more as I expected. Fortunately it is not very far between the two cities and I arrived around 2:30pm at my host. My battery had not run out off charge, but was close to it. I also was happy about the wide shoulders on the highway I was using. It was a very secure road.\n\nCoincidentally I met my warmshowers host outside the house of his apartment with his trash. He welcomed me, opened the front door and told me to park my bike under the stairs, because it is saver than outside. The door is always locked.\n\nHe showed me around in his apartment, cooked a coffee for me, served some Digestive, butter and cheese and told me then, he has to continue working. It was really nice, giving me that time even I arrived earlier than expected.\n\nWhen his work was done, we had a chat at the patio e.g. about climate issues and nuclear energy. We also have seen a hedgehog.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLater he cooked a meal – a vegetable pot, which was delicious. Even we were talking about different issues during the meal, we continued our chat afterwards and actually had discussions about different faith and humanism. I really enjoyed it. He also invited me for an vanilla ice-cream with bananas and plum jam. It was very good.\n\nAround 10pm we said good night after we had agreed about the time for breakfast.\n\n.\n\n3rd September 2021\n\nLinköping – Tokarp Lyckebo; 80 km; host: Jon and Matilda Forsärla (mp/Naturskyddsföreningen via fb)\n\nMy host Heinz served a good and generous breakfast. He also followed me on his bike to help me find my way further. I am very grateful to him.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe weather was nice, but a little cloudy today, even it was a little windy. Heinz told me, it was the perfect weather for biking. Even this day, there was no incident. I was going by bike to Mjölby, but during that ride, Google sent me via an odd dirt road, I never had chosen by myself. In Great Britain they call this kind of road “Bridleway”. There were three farms on the side of this road and in front of the last one was a “Mind the dog” sign. I had to go through there anyway, but fortunately there was no dog. At a gas station I used the bathroom and bought a yogurt drink. Later I stopped at the outskirts of Mjölby and had lunch sitting on a bench.\n\nAfterwards I tried to find highway 32 by Google maps. It took a while, but finally I was on it. There was much more traffic as I expected, especially more trucks. The shoulder was very small and sometimes even smaller. Therefore I did not feel safe.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIn the town of Boxholm I took a rest, because I understood, that I have to charge my battery – it will not last all the way to my host for this night. I found the Boxholms New Viennacafe. I parked my e-bike at their outdoor place, entered and told them, that I will have something soon and asked, if I am allowed to charge my battery. That was OK and I ordered a cappuccino and a bit of carrot cake. I was sitting at the café for around one and a half hour and I was not asked to leave. There was also a group of men sitting at a table. They were there, when I was entering and still when I was leaving. They started a small talk with me. One of them told me, that I should not use the highway 32 from the town of Sommen to Tranås, but the older road, called Mjölbyvägen. I already read this on maps.me. He added useful tips.\n\n.\n\nThe Boxholms “Nya Wienercafé”\n\n.\n\nI was happy, when there was a bike path from the town of Sommen and it continued on an old road with much less traffic and no trucks.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIn Tranås I met my new host: Jon Forsärla outside his work space, the firefighters. We were biking together to his home. The road was mostly going uphill and Jon also rides an e-bike. By the way, I was allowed to choose the path: Mostly dirt road or mostly paved road. I chose, of course, the latter. At the short part of dirt road I was unlucky and close to fall with my bike, but it did not happen. Entering the yard of the F. home, I was blind by the sun and was laying down my bike on the ground, but really slowly.\n\nAll went well and I was welcomed by the rest of the family. I got to know the children and the wife. The parents shortly renovated their kitchen. The most eye-catching details are the spoons as handles on the cupboard doors and the drawers. It was taco-evening. It is a kind of a different world to be hosted by a family with young kids. The parents had their things to do and luckily, they had WiFi. Jon asked me, if I have hosts all the way, therefore I answered him, that I don’t have any for Värnamo yet. He offered, to find me a host. I was very grateful for it. I will see, if he succeeds. We continued sitting around the kitchen table och were chatting a little. Matilda, the woman in the house, told me, that they have tried to get couch-surfers, but did not have any, because they are living at the countryside.\n\nI have got an email from the reporter of Folkbladet. The article about my “BikingForFuture” was on side 6, but there was also a notice on the front-page:\n\nLater, Jon changed a couch into my bed, but with a cozy mattress on the top. It was nice to sleep on it.\n\nThe Forsärla couple and I have a lot in common. We both care for the environment. None of us has a car and we like to have guests. We also know the same Green Party member. I thought, it was for him, I was invited to this family, but actually it was because of my blog.\n\nBy the way, both Jon and I have written to the Tranås’ newspaper, that I will come to Tranås. Jon got a thank you for the information. I didn’t get anything and also they missed their chance, because tomorrow I won’t be in Tranås anymore. I will go the shortest way further.\n\n.\n\n4th September 2021\n\nTokarp Lyckebo – Jönköping; 74 km; host: Hojjat Erfani (couchsurfing)\n\nI awoke twice during the night. The first time I only was to the bathroom and immediately to bed again. The other time was around a quarter past three. I did continue with my blog, wrote to Jönköping’s and Värnamo’s newspapers. Around six o’clock, the family awoke and breakfast was already before 8am. I forgot to take my medicines, but did it before leaving. For breakfast there was a lot to choose and they explained, that they usually have it this way for their children – that they find something they like.\n\nAfter breakfast I was first in the bathroom brushing my teeth etc. Not many minutes later I left – after photos were taken:\n\n.\n\nThe children have the unusual names Frey and Gro.\n\n.\n\nI was only using paved roads this day and mostly without Google Maps. I thought, I can remember where I should go and find my way easily. I had to go to the left twice, but I was counting wrong I found out, when I came to a dirt road. Though I was going back. Later I saw a sign to the little town of Sunhultsbrunn I was on my way to. In the continuing direction was another name. Later I found out, I should have continued straight, because I soon entered a bigger road, which was not fun to go by bike. Sometimes it feeled very dangerous, because this road also had a tiny shoulder only. Before I came to Sunhultsbrunn I saw the highway 132 and that was the one I should use, which I did, but I did not come through all the towns and villages I know and should have passed. Maybe this way was shorter. Anyway I nearly run out of battery and asked at a service shop with an automatic gas station for allowance to charge my battery. I did get it, had a coffee and a cake and updated my blog meanwhile I was waiting. All the time it was easy to have my eyes on my bike. Though I had left it with the panniers.\n\nBy the way a reporter from Värnamo Nyheter did contact me by email and I answered him during my lunch, which I ate sitting on a bigger stone. I had already continued, when he called me, though I had to stop. By the traffic, I could not really hear him, but I understood that he was awaiting me today in Värnamo. I had to tell him, that I will arrive in Värnamo the next evening. He told me, he need a picture of me – which I later sent him by email. I did not here anything of him for hours.\n\nI continued on my way and had to use the serpentines down to the town of Huskvarna. I had been a little afraid for going there by bike, but fortunately it was working well. Huskvarna is the sister-town of Jönköping. There was a point, I didn’t understand Google maps. I had to cross a European highway, but could not see, where. There was a bridge, but for me it seemed, it was for trains. I called my host and told him, where I am – in the hope, I will get some help. Unfortunately he thought, I was closer to his home, but sent me his directions by Whats App. This was exactly the same, which I was using. When I had followed Google maps directions and was for the second time at the same gas station, I was entering it and asked the shop assistant, how to cross the highway and he told me, the bridge is for pedestrians and cyclists and also, where I could enter it. The cycle pass was very close to the street, which Google maps did not tell me. It only told me the name of the street.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nGoing further it first went well, but soon I had the sun in my eyes and it was hard to see the cyclist and pedestrians, which came against me. At one point, two cyclist met me on the site of the cycle pass, one on the pedestrians site and there also was a pedestrian. I had to go between them and I shouted, I cannot see well because of the sun. Nobody cared, but it was going well. I don’t know, what the cyclist, going on the pedestrians pass was thinking, but he must have been a bit crazy.\n\nWhen Google told me (again), that I was understanding it’s direction wrong, I started pushing my bike. There were so many opportunities, I had to check the map all the time and it was hard to know, where to continue when I was told: southwards. Finally I was close, but felt, I might be wrong again. Therefore I asked an elderly lady, who was walking her dog. Luckily she had the same goal as I and I could follow her. By the way, I was following the wrong street, when I met her. Soon we were at the described house and I was looking for the correct number, because it had two entrances. At the bell system I tried to choose the name of my host, when he was coming out of the house, welcoming and helping me.\n\nFirst we were going downstairs to the garage by elevator and put my bike there. He told me, it is safe there. We did take my panniers to the elevator, he was carrying the most of my luggage. When we were at the fourth floor, we entered his apartment.\n\nHis wife welcomed me as well and I was offered to choose somewhere to sit, though I chose the most comfortable place on the couch, because I had a little pain in my butt. They have a beautiful dog, a Golden Retriever. He loves to greet people, but because my light allergy against dog and cats hair, he was held calm and a bit out off my way.\n\nI don’t really remember, what we were talking about, but I remember, that it was an interesting conversation. Two of the subjects where about painting, because he is an artist and about, how they were coming to Sweden. When they left their homeland Iran, they first lived in India for ten years. The reason for leaving Iran was the government/politics. They did not like the Shah either. What they really like is democracy.\n\nI was invited to an Iranian meal. It was vegetarian only because I am a vegetarian and was an Aubergine dish with walnuts, Iranian bread and a cucumber dip similar to Tzatziki. That was such a delicious meal and the cucumber dip was a very good supplement to the Aubergine dish.\n\nWe were now talking about customs and traditions in different countries, especially in Mexico and Iran. They showed a documentary about Iran as well. There were so many beautiful art expressions and also a lot of ancient culture. I would like to see that country as well. I was told, I could knock every door and the people living there will give me a bed for the night and food to eat.\n\nWe were going to bed around a quarter past ten. Actually when they asked if I was tired some minutes before, I told them, I am not. It was magic that I became sleepy so fast.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n5th September 2021\n\nJönköping – Värnamo (Ulås); 98 km; host: Peder Thorén (Naturskyddsföreningen)\n\nIn the middle of the night Jon messaged me, that I have got a host. It is a member of the board at Naturskyddsföreningen i Värnamo. He is living some kilometers outside town.\n\nI was awake around 7am and tog my medicine and stayed up, but my host was still sleeping – we had agreed about 8am. I was happy, that I could take both my medicines before breakfast and I didn’t need to apologize for waiting to eat breakfast. They served both tea and coffee as well as honey and an Iranian jam plus two different kind of bread. I was happy with this breakfast. At the end, we tasted a ginger shot, but it was very hot. It felt, like it burnt my tung, though I was served a cup of tea and I was surprised, because it helped immediately.\n\nAfter I had taken a shower – I am really surprised about all the famous equipment in their apartment, even they pay around 10.000 SEK/month for the one bedroom apartment, time was come to take good bye. It was later, that I am used to, but that I only realized afterwards. They helped me with all my things I have to carry and they were right, my bike had been safe during the night. Last but not least they showed me the shortest way out of town. Even this I was very happy about.\n\nLeaving Jönköping in the direction of Värnamo is by heavy cycling. Without my e-bike it would have been very hard and I should have pushed my bike for more than one km. I took a rest, when I was out of town and during this my alarm clock told me, it was already high noon.\n\nBy the way, Google maps made me confused at one point (next right, then left plus next left, then right) and I was happy to meet a couple of cyclists, who told me the correct direction. Later Google told me too early to go to the left and still later, it want me to take unpaved road. I did not do it, but as soon as possible I stopped a car and asked for the correct way. I had to go back to the place, where I had turned left. The rest to Vaggeryd was easier. There I have seen a Preem gas station, where I could both buy something to eat as well as I could charge my battery. Here I read an email, offering me a bed for a night in English (in the subject). The name of the sender was Swedish. There was no more information. I answered her, that she was the second one in line and I already had agreed staying at the first ones home.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe shop assistant was great. First she told me, that I don’t need to feel stressed for charging my battery. I bought a meal. Later she invited me to a cappuccino and also sent bananas with me. She told me, that she could not sell the bananas anymore, because they were getting brown. She explained, that I could go all the way to the next town by a bicycle path and also told respectively showed me the direction. I was not able to remember all of it, though I asked a young woman, who was out and running, when I did not remember the directions. It was very easy to come to the next town, to Skillingaryd.\n\nTo leave Skillingaryd in the right direction however was a problem. I had to ask Google maps and it was directing me to a dirt road – I was turning around, but could stop a car and ask for help. They told me, that it only was around 500m of dirt road, then I had to go the the right and later to the left. I thanked them and did push my bike the 500m. I did as I was taught, but unfortunately, I was too early to go to the left. Therefore I came after a while to another dirt road, but it seemed to be OK to ride. Unfortunately after a while it got so bad and also was going downhill, that I had to push my bike again. I also slipped on the surface which made it hard for me to hold my bike, but I succeeded. I was happy, when, after more than one km, the road was paved again. Now it was accompanying a railroad. After some kilometers I reached a village and the road was crossing the railroad there. It was the village to which I should have come by paved road all the way. I was very happy when I after a while saw the sign of Värnamo kommun. Even it was the outer border, I understood, that I do not need Google maps for a while.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThere were no hills any more and I could ride my bike in a good speed. Entering Värnamo I had to decide in which direction I had to go and I chose the town center. Fortunately I did choose right. Anyway I had to contact my host for this night for the directions. First I tried by text, but got no answer. Then I tried to call him, but the answering machine was activated, though I asked pedestrians. The first two had never heard about the village of Ulås or the address Ulåsledet. Afterwards I asked a small group of pedestrians and two of them started to explain, but my phone was ringing. It was my host. He asked me, where I am and by his answer, I understood that he knows the town very well. Luckily I only had to go further. Anyway, I had to call him one more time. Less than halfway, he met me and I was very grateful for that, because it already became dark. My light was working great meanwhile he did neither have a light nor wear a helmet.\n\nAt his home, I had to put a “waterproof plaid” over the bike for not getting wet, because the bike had to be outside. Peder invited me for a dinner (a Felix pie). We were also talking about the environment and biodiversity.\n\nLater he made his bed for me and he was sleeping on his couch. Even I told him, that I could sleep on the couch, he insisted, that I had to sleep in his bed.\n\n.\n\n6th September 2021\n\nVärnamo – Ljungby; 45 km; host: Daniel Elwér (warmshowers)\n\nI awoke several times during the night and also got cramps in my feet – mostly the right one. Luckily I felt asleep again every time. At 7am I took my medicine. Peder awoke at that time and asked me, if I wanted breakfast. Though I told him, I first have to take another medicine and breakfast can wait. He was happy to have time to sleep a little more.\n\nWhen I had taken my medicines, I cared about my bike battery and a power-bank as well. Afterwards I checked the trip of the day, wrote a tips to the newspaper in the next town, where I will stay, wrote a reference for my host in Jönköping and updated my blog somewhat. Unfortunately the connection was to bad for uploading photos. – The photo of my host in Ulås and me I uploaded at Daniel’s home, where I had WiFi.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI had no problems at all in going to my next destination – to Ljunby. I took a photo, when entering Kronobergs län, which is a part av Småland. I have seen Canada geese and stopped for a photo as well. From the place Lagan there was a bike path all the way to Ljungby. A part of it is called “Banvallen” and is a part of the bike path network Sweden.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDaniel, my new host, really pampered me. He shared his WiFi with me, serves everything I want and bring it to me. I was sitting on his balcony meanwhile he was working (he works from home) and in between his job he served me coffee with chocolate and dates as well as goat milk. Actually goat milk in the coffee is tasting good.\n\nFor the shower he provided me a towel and I also was allowed to use his soap, but I used my own soap. It feels so good to have a shower in a clean home. I used the WiFi, when he was working and even, when he was out for errands. By the way, he carried my panniers as well as my bike into his apartment on the second floor.\n\nHe also served me a late lunch and in the evening we cooked together (with his ingredients). We had vegetables, bought by a Reko-ring, from the oven together with a salad (he also has a garden outside the town). We were still sitting with the kitchen table and talking about the lifestyle, he would like to have – a small house at the countryside with a garden, growing vegetables etc and also about traveling until we were going to sleep around 10pm, but I actually sent some emails and requests to hosts in Denmark. He offered me his bed, but I insisted to sleep on the couch. By the way, in Sweden we have a proverb: With friends we are sitting in the kitchen, with strangers in the living room.\n\n.\n\n7th September 2021\n\nLjungby – Markaryd; 55 km; host: Lucas Berglund (couchsurfing)\n\nI had a good sleep during the night even I woke up twice – for using the bathroom. I also got cramp in my feet, but not as long and not as hard as the night before. Finally I awoke a quarter past six and heard Daniel leaving the apartment. He had told me the evening before, that he uses to go jogging in the morning.\n\nI was to the bathroom and sent then a message to my host for the next night, telling him, that I am in Ljungby and a guess, when I will arrive at his home. He answered immediately and told me, he will be at home at 5pm. Then I used Google maps and saw, that he is living outside Markaryd – in Timsfors, actually 5 km before entering that town. I also did see, that it was not so far to Markaryd as I remembered. I had split the tour in staying in Ljungby and Markaryd, because all the way to Markaryd from Värnamo would have been too long. Therefore I sent a new message to this host.\n\nDaniel told me, he will email the chairman of the City Council (maybe he will be interested in to meet me) before he made breakfast for me. The chairman did not answer before I left.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDaniel had explained in which direction I have to continue. Actually Google maps agreed with him at the start. Later it told me to go to the left on a dirt road. I hesitated, but the road was not bad, though I continued. After a while Google maps told me to go to the right, what was not possible, because the road I should use now, was only allowed for vehicles with special allowance. I turned around and was going back. At the junction, where I had turned into the dirt road, I stopped a car and ask the driver, an old man with a beard, which way to go to Markaryd (my goal for the day). He told me, there is a motorway and I replied, there should be another road close to the motorway. Finally he answered “to the left” and then it is signed. I was on the road again, where I first came from, turned left, where possible and was happy, that there was a bike path. Most of the time, there were bike paths beside the roads. Once I also was directed to a very small, but paved road. I used the highest assistance level nearly all the time, because I had only to go between 50 and 60 km. By the way, I discovered, that Google maps distances sometimes are incorrect and it can differ about 200m. At one point, I was directed to turn to the right, where no road was to turn into. I need to have that in mind next time, when I am asked to turn into dirt roads.\n\nI had got two phone calls from the company “3”. I know that, because I tried to call back the first time and the answering machine told me. I sent a message, that I am going by bike and therefore don’t have the possibility to answer. After the second call, they stopped calling me. I also had contact with Moa, a journalist at the newspaper “Smålänningen”. We agreed a time and place to meet. Furthermore I have got an email from the chairman of the board at Naturskyddsföreningen in Helsingborg. Unfortunately she could not help me, but promised to find someone else for my overnight stay, which she didn’t.\n\nI arrived 5 min before the agreed time and at the agreed place meeting Moa. She had a lot more questions as the other journalists before. She was writing down all my answers. Anyway, I asked her to send me the text before publishing it, which she promised.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI was at Lucas home half an hour earlier as he arrived. Julia, a neighbor, came over and talked with me. She told me how good Lucas is working with the garden and how handsome he is as well as the house from the inside is cute.\n\nTime was running fast and Lucas arrived by car. He is working too far from home to make it without car. He first showed me the rooms in his house and afterwards he showed me his garden – the flowerbeds and the vegetables.\n\nLater, in the kitchen, when Lucas prepared our dinner and even afterwards we were talking about doctor / patient related issues. It was the first time a doctor had time to listen to me since I am back in Sweden (from my jobs abroad). I also could ask him about different medical issues like autoimmunity and COVID-19. He was very good in explaining.\n\nIf I remember right, we were going to bed around 10pm and he had told me, that he will leave for work at 8m. I slept in the room under the roof with morning sun.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n8th September 2021\n\nMarkaryd – Åstorp; 67 km; Milano hotel\n\nEven I awoke in time to leave with Lucas, I was too tired to get up. Though I didn’t take my medicine either, but later. Lucas was up half an hour before he left. He did not only manage to dress, but also had a coffee and sandwich.\n\nI made him company during breakfast, but I just had taken my second medicine and had to wait for half an hour more. He trusted me so much, that he left a key to me and asked me to leave it, when I was leaving the house as well. I promised – and did, of course.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAround 10am I was ready to leave. I took my bike out of the shed, where it had been during the night and packed it. After a while I had finished and was going further.\n\nI have not found a host in Scania yet and tried it with Facebook. I also was waiting for answers of the four couchsurfing hosts in Helsingborg I requested to stay days ago. I never got an answer of one of them. Furthermore I was in contact with the board at Naturskyddsföreningen, as I already wrote. Unfortunately I couldn’t get a host this way either, because of health related problems of the intended hosts.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI really was thinking to try my luck at the firefighters in Åstorp, where I had arrived with a very low battery, when I saw a sign for a hotel. Actually I had to ask pedestrians for the directions, because there were no more signs. The first one told me, he don’t know, he is only working here. The other one gave me the exact directions. Well there, the reception was closed and I was rounding the house for asking at the pizzeria Milano – the same name as the hotel has, but they were not related. Though I went back and checked the Internet. First I found out, that there is no hostel in Åstorp, then I saw, there may be no vacant room and finally I found the website for this hotel. There was an opportunity to book a room, but I was not sure, that it would be cared for that booking soon. Therefore I called the owner. He was driving a car and the connection was really bad. He told me, that he is on his way to the hotel and will arrive in half an hour. I waited for him. He only had an empty hut for 715 SEK (70 EUR)/night. That was the one I have seen on the Internet. I rented it, because I felt, I have no other choice.\n\nThe owner put my bike on the patio of that hut, for locking it to the railing. I put all my belongings into the hut, tried the offered WiFi, which was very bad and only worked somewhat outside the hut. I was going to that pizzeria Milano and had a vegetarian pizza. The owner was not service-minded and spoke in a raw tone – in the same way the owner of the hotel had spoken to me before. Maybe it is related to the area. After a rest I walked to a nearby grocery shop and bought some food. Back at the hut I was sending a request to Susan in Rødbyhavn, Denmark. My host for Vordingborg i Denmark was already fixed. I also tried to update my blog, but I was too tired and going to sleep.\n\n.\n\n9th September 2021\n\nÅstorp – Helsingborg – Ramlösa – Malmö; 25 km + 8 km + 2 km. Host: My daughter Maria\n\nI slept like I have done at my hosts, during the trip – no better, no worse. I didn’t use the shower. It didn’t look inviting, even I think, it was somewhat clean. I had the breakfast of the food I had bought the evening before and cooked two eggs in the electric kettle.\n\nWhen I left at 10:30am (it got late because of the breakfast) the owner of the hotel came to me for collecting the key. He might have seen, when I attached my belongings to my bike. The official check-out time was 11am at the latest.\n\nMy first stop (Helsingborg) depended on, that I was visiting my son Marcus there. We had a late lunch together, which we cooked together, a chat (of course) and a barbecue with two neighbors of him. Unfortunately I had soon to leave afterwards.\n\nI was going further by train of three reasons. I was tired of biking and really in need of a rest, I had not got a host in Helsingborg and I had planned to visit my daughter Maria as well as she had booked the laundry room for the upcoming day (for washing my dirty clothes).\n\nFrom the closest train station only “Pågatåg” (the regional trains in Scania) are going. I was happy, that there was no need to go to the train station in the city center. Anyway, even on these trains one is allowed to take a bike on board. I was not sure, that I could use the elevators at the train station (for the size only), though I tried to find out, if I could. I couldn’t find that on the Internet, but I could chat with the train company and I was told, it should be possible. Though I tried after I had said good-bye to my son Marcus.\n\nIt was only eight km to the train station. Before I took the elevator down to the rails, I had to install an app for booking and paying for my trip. Fortunately I could get in my bike into the elevator, but it was no space at all left between the door and the bike.\n\nFinally, the train I had booked my ticket for, arrived. There was only one car of four for carrying bikes. Luckily I had seen at the train before, how a girl entered with her bike. The first place for bikes was already occupied, therefore I had to round it and take the next place, but it was difficult. I have got help of the ticket collector.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe young man with his bike left soon and in Lund a young woman entered with her bike. She told me, she has the same panniers as I and even in the same color. We did chat with each other. I could see and hear, that she was not comfortable with the Swedish language. She now told me, that she is from Germany and studying in Lund. She added, that she tries to speak Swedish at the university, but people are switching to English instead to help her using Swedish, though I continued to speak Swedish with her. When I was leaving the train with my bike, she helped me to leave.\n\nIn Malmö they have elevators, really big enough for bikes. It was easy to move up from the underground. Looking for the way out of the railway station, I found out, that there only is one opportunity for bikes, wheelchairs, prams and strollers. I used that one, of course. I used Google maps to find the directions to my daughter. By my experiences with Google maps I did not trust it. Though I was pushing my bike to my daughter’s place.\n\nShe is living in an apartment house for students. There are neither names nor bells outside the doors and I had to call her. Soon she came down and helped me to put my bike in a save place. Then we were taking the elevator to the sixth floor, where her apartment is.\n\nShe shared a meal with me, we had a short chat and afterwards we were going to bed.\n\n.\n\n10th September 2021\n\nThis day was my first official day off, but actually the day before I did not go by bike a lot either. I really needed this day off – and should have needed it a couple of days before. I was tired – the whole of me. I also finally got time to update the list of my hosts and check, where I am missing one. Anyway, the most important was the feeling about the trip. I was no longer really sure, that I can do it – the whole one, I mean. I wondered, if I just should turn back home, but then I was thinking about my mission and also, that I had met a journalist from the newspaper “Sydsvenskan”, this morning, who will write about my trip.\n\nI decided to try and go further by bike the next day. I also thought, that it is good, that I have put in a day off once a week. I know now, that it is really necessary for me.\n\nMy daughter used the laundry and I did my laundry, too. I only had dirty clothes for one washing machine, of course. I think the laundry room and the booking system is good, but my daughter told me, that she don’t like the big windows, so everyone, who passes by, can see, what one put in or take out the drying cabinets. When I was thinking about that, I agreed with her. There also is a football table in the laundry room and I am wondering, why it is standing there. The art, in the contrary, I really like. It illustrates the history of Malmö and especially of this area.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMy daughter served me breakfast and lunch, though I invited her for dinner. I was looking for a real restaurant, but Malmö is an expensive town. At the end, we chose a pizzeria. I had invited my son Daniel as well, but he was too tired and told me, he has to go to sleep.\n\nWhen we were going to the pizzeria, we first turned for the wrong way, but then we found the right direction. It was nice to see a little more of the new area of Malmö.\n\nI had a Falafel plate with French fries and my daughter had a chicken plate with French fries. Back at home we were going to bed early again.\n\n.\n\n11th September 2021 – Entering Denmark\n\nMalmö – Kastrup Airport – Vordingborg; 98 km from Kastrup Airport to Vordingborg; host: Klaus Michael Jensen (varmshowers)\n\nFor crossing “The Sound” (a strait) between Sweden and Denmark we have to take the train, because no bicycles or pedestrian are allowed on the bridge. I was at the train station around 10am and took the first train I could catch. It was announced, that it should be a short train, which means a train with only three cars, but it was a long one. I didn’t see all the people sitting in the low floor department, though I entered. All fold-able seats were occupied and nobody raised, when I entered with the bike, therefore i was staying in the passage. The ticket collector neither said anything nor checked the tickets. I always thought, these low floor departments were mainly for prams, strollers and bikes and people only was allowed to sit there if available. When it was time to leave at the station Kastrup Airport, I thought, all the people with suitcases will leave, too. I was wrong. Most of those people were going further and I had to ask them, to make space for me and my bike.\n\nOut of the train, I was lucky, I did see the signs for the elevators straight above my head. There were lots of people going to the elevators with their luggage, prams or strollers. I waited until all the others had left by the elevators. Meanwhile I was waiting for the elevator coming down again, some more travelers came and queued with me. I asked them for using the other elevator, where only three persons where waiting by telling the newcomers, that the elevator will be full, when I have entered with the bike. First they were going to queue for the other elevator, but suddenly they were going further, I think, they were looking for the escalator instead. I had to wait for a while, before the elevator was at my level again. I was going up one floor only – to the hall for arrivals. There I tried to find my way out. The doors were not suitable for leaving by bike, I thought, but then an information assistant proved me wrong. I had expected, that she would show me the place, where I officially could enter Denmark – with the whole procedure – that I had to show them my COVID-19 vaccination document etc, but she did not.\n\nOutside the building, I first took a picture for you:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nand then I tried to find the way out of the area. I guessed the One Way Road was the one to use and it was right. When I came to the main-street, I was wondering in which direction I should go and asked Google maps for help, but it couldn’t find my exact position. First I was going in that direction I thought, I have to go, then I ask a worker and he explained to me. I thanked him so much and was going by my bike as he told me, but a couple of streets further, I had to ask again. The first three or four couldn’t answer me, because they didn’t speak English or they didn’t understand my question.\n\nFinally I was going into the right directions. After a while I was looking for a gas station or a café for recharging my battery. I hoped, I found one at my side of the street, that I don’t need to cross the street. I passed by some, but they all did neither have a shop nor a toilet. When I did not find one for a long time, I anyway crossed the street, but instead of the usual shop at a gas station, there were only a flower-shop. The owner or seller did deny to charge my battery. Luckily my battery had some energy left. After a long while I came to Tureby and found, what I was looking for:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe gas station and shop had CCTV and i had put my e-bike directly under one of the cameras, without knowing it. I asked here, if I am allowed to charge my battery and I was. I bought a snack and was waiting outside for taking care about my bike. From time to time I checked my battery, if it was charged enough. It took a long time before it was – for continuing on my trip.\n\nI had messaged my upcoming host, that I’ll be late. He answered, he is at home. During the rest of the ride it became dark. I first tried to use the bike path, when there was, but there were no lights on that bike path and no white lines. The light of the bike was not good enough to see the whole wide of the path and to espy the vegetation on the side of it, therefore I was cycling on the road again.\n\nFinally I reached the house of my host, opened the gate, put in my bike into the garden and closed the gate again (of course). I ringed the bell and was welcomed, but had to ask for, where to have my bike. Klaus, my host, showed me to the back part of his garden. There was a small passage to it, between two parts of a hedge. I nearly did not come through, but he told me, it is OK. I had to carry all my luggage by myself into the house. Klaus asked me, if I have had dinner and I answered “no, unfortunately I have not had time for it”. Though, he offered me the usual dinner of the house, I think it was – bread, cold cuts and something to drink. We later had a short conversation and a young men joined in. It was him, who was more talk-active, even it stayed at the questions about my route, but starting with, that Klaus had been cycling all of South America.\n\nI was expected to go to bed after the meal, but they were concerned, that I did not have bed-linen or a sleeping-bag with me. They put a sheet on the bed and a thin, lightweight sleeping-bag. Klaus also told me, that breakfast was at 7:30am next day and added, that I have to bike further.\n\n.\n\n12th September 2021\n\nVordingborg – Rødbyhavn; 66 km; host: Susan Daniels (couchsurfing)\n\nI became cold during the night, but anyway I have had some hours of sleep. I was up in good time and had all my things ready before breakfast. I was dressed as well, of course. I was very surprised when I saw, that the people of the house (now there was also a little girl) already have had breakfast. The men where sitting in armchairs, reading newspapers. The woman asked me, what I want for breakfast. I answered porridge, because she just held an empty porridge pot in her hands. Some minutes later I was served breakfast, which was porridge, raisins, watermelon and tea. I asked for milk and had the porridge with raisins and milk.\n\nDuring this breakfast, the woman was sitting at the table with me for telling me, that warmshowers is just what the name says: a warm shower. I told her, that on warmshowers hosts describe, what they are offering. She was interested in to see the app and the text Klaus had written. She was surprised about, that the notice was “private room, camping space, bathroom access – dinner provided, breakfast provided – laundry”. – He has not changed it yet 😉 (The latest I checked it was on 22nd Nov this year.)\n\nThe atmosphere was cold all the time, maybe they are different to male warmshowers guests. Anyway, they were very different to the Danish people I know. Before I left, he asked me to write something in his guest book. I did, but it was only a short notice, thanking for bed and board.\n\nI biked further in the direction of Rødbyhavn. Google sent me via a beautiful cycle path.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLater the paths were not so beautiful any more. Actually there were no bigger problems to find my way, but once. However, I found it out very quickly. I arrived at Susan’s home earlier than expected. Her garden gate was open, though I put my bike there and also tog a seat in one of her garden chairs.\n\nI had to wait a quite long while, before she arrived. First she thought I was one of her B&B guests, but then she understood better. Not being a B&B guest meant, that I could not put my bike a bit longer into her garden, but that, actually, did not matter. She explained, that she mostly has B&B guests, but sometimes takes couchsurfing guests as well and that she had accepted my request, because I will go such a long way. She also added, it would be too expensive for her, if she would welcome couch-surfers more often.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWhen she showed me “my” room, there were three beds in it, but nice anyway. The stairs up to the first floor were steep, like it is common in Denmark. The tiny bathroom was on the “1 1/4 floor”, the tiniest floor I ever have seen. She asked me for my own sheets and I explained, that I am traveling light as well, that I was not thinking about that, because we don’t need to have sheets with us in Sweden. Though she told me, I have to buy a sleeping-bag of silk in Hamburg, because they are not heavy at all and don’t need a lot of space. I remembered, I have had such one on my first part of my “travel around the world”, but can’t remember, why I don’t have it anymore.\n\nDespite this harsh comment, Susan and I had good conversations during my stay. She also served dinner and breakfast and did have the breakfast table beautiful decorated. Even here I was early to bed.\n\n.\n\n13th September 2021 – Entering Germany\n\nRödbyhaven – ferry; 2 km; Puttgarden – Neustadt in Holstein; 85 km; host: Kirsten Jöllenbeck\n\nI left Susan’s home together with her. Meanwhile she was going to work, I was going by bike to the ferry to cross the Baltic Sea. There is no other opportunity I know. Susan had explained to me, how to go to the ferry as well as how to continue in Germany.\n\nI had read on the Internet, that the ferry is going every twenty minutes, but when I arrived at the top of my lane after I had paid the fee at the counter, of course, I read, that the next ferry was at 9:40am. Time of my arrival was around 8:50am. By the way, I had to pay 116 SEK and was told: No coins. Though I gave the cashier 120 SEK – and got a 5 SEK coin as change.\n\nMeanwhile I was waiting for the ferry, I was thinking about, how I could manage to cycle upwards the ramp. When I saw the ferry come in, it was not tied at the pier I expected. First I could not see the ramp for the cars. Finally, I was advised to go forward just a couple of meters. I had to wait there until all the trucks and cars were on board. When a car with a caravan had passed, I was asked to follow it. I was cycling as fast as I could for not being a reason for delay. I had not to use the ramp, I came to the department for trucks and buses. At the ferry, I had to go to the most right there is. There were two places for motorbikes and bikes and a simple belt for them. I did not know, how to use that, though I was shown. It was very simple indeed. The service employee told me, to take my valuables with me and I showed him, that I already had.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI had to go upstairs – to the 6th floor, where the restaurants and the shops are. People were advised to use face masks, but I did not realize that in time and had left mine in my panniers. I saw people looking at me suspicious, but in the shop, where I bought a Ritter Sport chocolate and something to drink, the cashier didn’t say anything. I stayed away from the crowds, but when it was time to go down the stairs to the cars etc, I ended up in the middle of them.\n\nBefore I left the ferry, I had opened my European COVID-19 vaccination document as a PDF on my smartphone, but I did not need it. I was not checked. I also had heard of Susan, that not everyone was checked any longer, that they only make spot checks.\n\nI was looking for the road to the right, but biking in the first one, it was continuing in the wrong direction, though I was going back and tried the next one, which was correct. I now was cycling on the island of Fehmarn, looking for the way to the Fehmarn Sound bridge. There were cycle paths most of the way and also a lot of signs for the cycle pass, but I missed the one for the bridge and ask a citizen in the village of Strukkamp. She told me, there is no way from Strukkamp up to the bridge and added, that I have to go the next to the right and then to right again. I tried that, but I could not enter the bridge anyway, but was soon back in the village of Fehmarnsund (where I had started to look for the bridge). I took another round and luckily found a sign for the bridge. I became confused after a while and asked a cyclist, who seemed coming from the direction of the bridge and he really was coming down from it. He described, that there is a bicycle path up to the bridge at the end of the road and added, that I have to go there, where other cyclists are coming from. So I did.\n\nAt the end I have seen that steep (upwards) path. There was a sign, that cyclist have to unmount their bike, so I did, but some others were trying to bike there and had to go off their bike when meeting other bikers. Also on the bridge, the bike path was very small and for bikers in both directions. In addition to that, roadwork was ongoing. Though I pushed my bike all the way over the bridge, but most cyclist did ride their bikes. There was a little problem, meeting me with my panniers on the bike.\n\nFor leaving the path down from the bridge, one had to open a gate, which was not easy with my heavy equipment, but I did it all by my own. Fortunately there was a bench very close to that gate, where I had my lunch.\n\nThe original plan was to visit an ex-class-mate in Kiel, but she was not at home since 7th September for a few days, though I could use a shorter route instead and had less stress.\n\nOn the way to Neustadt in Holstein, Google showed me the wrong way again, therefore there were some extra kilometers again. It was a similar situation like in that harbor, where I was not allowed to go further.\n\nAt around 6pm I was in front of the house of Kirsten. She has her own health care company. Actually it is only her and she is a podiatrist. She has her company in a special room in her home and on the window of that room is her company’s name.\n\nWhen I ringed the bell, she opened with her grown up son behind her. I asked for her, because at that stage I didn’t know, that “only” she was working there. She told me, she is, looking confused for a moment and then she quickly understood, that I was her couch-surfer.\n\nShe did care about me well, introduced her son and cooked delicious pancakes with plums for all of us. Later we were talking about children etc and had an interesting, cozy time together until we were going to bed. Her son did show me a self-made giraffe in glazed ceramics. It was very beautiful. I was sleeping on the couch in the winter-garden. Should the sky had been cloudless, I would have seen the stars.\n\n.\n\n14th September 2021\n\nNeustadt in Holstein – Lübeck; 35 km; host: Andreas Schneiderbanger (couchsurfing)\n\nI knew, Kirsten had to work from 7am and would not have time to say good-bye to me this morning, though we already had done that the night before.\n\nI did not have a hurry, because I only had to go fore around 30 km this day. When I had taken my medicines Kirsten surprised me with breakfast, served at the bed. She told me, she had got a cancellation. We had time for a chat, before she had to go back to work. Around half an hour later I was on the road again.\n\nI had my lunch at an Asian restaurant in the city of Bad Schwartau, because I could sit outside and check my bike all the time. A kind guest came out and offered me to take a photo of me, the meal and the bike with my camera with the words “you are never on your pictures”. I was happy about it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI mainly could follow the road 75, there were bicycle path on the side of it. I really like that and that is also, what I wish, we would have in Sweden. It would e.g. reduce the number of kilometers between Katrineholm and Norrköping nearly half.\n\nUnfortunately (and I am ashamed about it), close to my hosts home, in the outskirts of the city of Lübeck, I tried to shorten a little to enter a cycle path, but the curb was too high, which I had not seen in time. I fell with my bike. I didn’t hurt me. Even it was on the side of the road and not a hinder, the cars on the other side stopped and two drivers were coming to help me. The first one helped me on my feet and also raised my bike. The other one told me, where I had to go ;-). Another accident happened to me not far away. I couldn’t stop in time at a junction, when I thought, I was on the wrong way – on the path for pedestrians and cyclists. I ended up in a hedge. Two teenage girls, who have seen that, shouted something and I answered “ursäkta”, which is Swedish and means “sorry”. They didn’t try to speak to me anymore. I was more careful, of course, when I continued and arrived at Andreas’ home around half an hour later.\n\nI was chocked, when I saw the house, he was living in. I was wondering if he became unemployed and/or if his profile on couchsurfing is a fake. I didn’t feel safe there. I won’t leave my bike for a moment, though I messaged him to come and meet me. It took a while before he came – from the rear of the house. His home was 100% different as I had expected and very clean. Moreover, it was beautiful decorated. Everyone could see, that he loves the sea. He also told me, that the rent is low and he loves his backyard. He had made it into an oasis with quirky figured out details like the two benches on the flight of stairs (with longer and shorter legs). We put my bike in his yard meanwhile he told me, that none ever had stolen things from his yard.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHe already had prepared a meal (with pasta), but did talk so much – explaining me all about his apartment and his way to treat couch-surfers and other guests as well as about the books he is writing. He also told me, that he has to go to the post office and pick up a parcel. Furthermore he had to go to the supermarket (the only one for the whole suburb) and buy cat litter and more. After a while, we were really walking to the named places. Unfortunately the supermarket did not have cat litter, but Andreas bought a lot of food. He had to pick up the parcel further away at a kind of box station. He didn’t do it this day.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBack at his home we had the pasta meal and continued with our chat. We had so much to talk about, though it became late. Before we were going to bed, I asked him, when I have to leave. He told me, breakfast will be at 9am.\n\n.\n\n15th September 2021\n\nLübeck – Hamburg; 48 km; host: My friend Michael and family\n\nAndreas served me breakfast and chatted a while about the same subjects from the day before. Unfortunately I had to interrupt him and tell him, that I have to leave soon. It was already around 11pm and it started raining, when I was on the road again.\n\nIt did rain the entire day and my friend Michael sent me a message around 3pm, asking me how and where I am. He offered to pick me up by a rented car, but I denied – mostly because of the costs.\n\nI also was a little unlucky, when I came to the village of Neritz. There had been a sign for Bargteheide as well, but it was pointing in another direction, therefore I thought I was wrong at the beginning of the village of Neritz. In addition to that, the street now had cobblestones and was hard to use by bicycle. Though I turned around, looking for the right one. That other cycle path was first using a street, where farm transports were allowed. In the beginning, it was full of soil and really slippery as well as it was going downwards. I did push my bike for that. The paved road became a track across the fields. Therefore I continued to push my bicycle. The end of that dirt road was at the other side of the village of Neritz. I could continue on a bike path, which was like most of the bike paths I had used in Germany: Often too narrow, damaged by roots of the trees close to it and sometimes also horse poo on it.\n\nFinally I was in Bargteheide and messaged Michael, that I was there, asking for a commuter train in this small town. It was still raining, but I was happy, that I had found a roof, under which I could be with my bike. Michael’s answer was, that there is a commuter train from this town, but from the next little town, Ahrensburg-West, the subway is going. He added, that this subway is going all the way to his home, but it takes a while and if I would change the line, I would arrive faster. I answered, that I hate to change trains of any kind with my bike.\n\nI continued biking, now in the direction of Ahrensburg. There was no sign for Ahrensburg-West. I didn’t use Google maps, because my smartphone was low on battery and I couldn’t charge it, because it had become wet even I had it in my special bag all the time. Arriving in Ahrensburg I tried to find my way by checking Google maps, because of the lack of signs for Ahrensburg-West here as well. I have seen, that I was going in the wrong direction and turned around, but had to ask pedestrians, where I finally had to go, which was good. Otherwise I would have taken a wrong direction again.\n\nWell at the underground station I was going to the elevator, but there was a sign, that and where I have to buy my ticket before going down to the tracks by the elevator. I did so and tried to pay with my debit Visa card as well as with my debit Master card, but the vending machine did not accept them. Now I had to find an ATM and I was lucky, there was a branch of a bank close, too and it had an ATM, easy to reach. I took 100 EUR out off the machine and got 2 x 50. I hoped, that will do it. Unfortunately the vending machine only accepted notes up to 20 EUR. I asked a woman (the only person around) at the nearby bus stop for change, but she had not. I had to go back to the ATM and fetch 10 EUR, which was possible.\n\nBack at the vending machine I bought a ticket by putting in the station Fuhlsbüttel, where I had to go to. The ticket was for 3.40 EUR. Now I was going to the tracks by the elevator. I am happy about the clear signs at every underground station, though it was easy to see on which side of the platform I had to wait. I was not sure, if there was a special car for bikes, though I was asking a young man, who was there with his bike as well. He told me, there is not. I can use which car ever, if there are no bikes already.\n\nAround 10 minutes later I entered a car and I had to hold hard in my bike all the time, even I had tilted my bike against a rack in the middle of the space in between the doors. The ride was for 58 minutes and my bike just fitted in the elevator at the target station. First time, the doors did not close, though I had to give my bike another position. It went well and Michael was waiting for me. He pushed my bike to his home.\n\nMichael and his wife now rent two apartments in the same house. One is on the first floor and the other one on the floor above – under the roof. That apartment is dedicated for work. I did get a room in the apartment under the roof, but the meals and conversations we had together in the other apartment. I also got my laundry done this evening. I was happy, I could care for my wet clothes and used my long undergarment instead. By the way, I had not used the rain cover for my shoes, because I was afraid, that it won’t be safe riding with them, therefore my shoes were very wet and I had to dry them.\n\nI have got the WiFi password of Michael without asking and did update my blog somewhat when I was back in “my” room, but I was too tired and had to go to sleep instead for continuing.\n\n.\n\n16th September 2021\n\nThis day was fortunately a day off. After a late breakfast I was updating my blog a little more, because Michael was working and my clothes not dry yet. We had also talked about the climate crisis and Michael told me, the three characteristics he wishes most for his nearly 3-year-old daughter. The first he named was sympathy.\n\nIn the middle of the day I had a cold, short shower and dressed. Afterwards I was downstairs with my friends family and did get to know his little daughter. She was shy in the beginning, but later she was talking with me, too. She is very sweet in all meanings.\n\nIn the late afternoon I took the underground to another friend of mine and his family. When I arrived, the children’s grandparents were still there, but they did leave soon. Lars and his wife have two children – a 5-year-old boy and a 2-year-old girl. The kids were very active now and actually all the time before and after the evening meal. I think, it depended on my presence. The kids seem to be used to grandparents and other relatives, but not to friends like me, who they meet for the first time.\n\nI was at Michael’s again around 10:30pm. Lars had insisted to drive me there. Even this evening I updated my blog somewhat.\n\n.\n\n17th September 2021\n\nHamburg – Hammah; 65 km; host: Peter Seifert (couchsurfing)\n\nI had to go further and fortunately my shoes were dry now. The evening before I had used them with plastic bags inside. Michael and I had breakfast together again, than I packed. His wife has short working days on Fridays, though I did meet her, before I left.\n\nI had decided to take the S-Bahn (a commuter train) to St. Pauli Landungsbrücken and then the ferry to Finkenwerder, biking from there for not needing to face the traffic in town. Michael did push my bike to the S-Bahn station Ohlsdorf, which is the closest one. On the way there, he bought me the vegetarian sausage salad, which I wanted to buy and a buttermilk as well. The train was waiting, when we arrived, though I did not have any waiting time. This train had no rack in the middle (between the doors) and actually it was easier to handle my bike in there.\n\nI did ride an extra round in Finkenwerder, because of the different names Google maps told me and in real. When I discovered, that the other real name was only for a very short distance, I understood that I was right. Out off Finkenwerder, the road was following the seawall. It was a really nice ride with special, pretty houses to see. They are not only built half-timbered, they also have roofs of reed. Unfortunately I did not take the time to take photos.\n\nWhen I was looking for a bench to have my lunch, I soon found a real good place for it. It was a little hut and actually nearly perfect. It would have been perfect, if there had bin a loo as well.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nContinuing, the road did leave the seawall after a while and was going throughout forest. Here, the bike paths were not so good anymore. Lots of villages I saw this day were road villages. This means, the houses are build along only one road. Also my goal village was such one. Anyway, when Google maps told me at the end of this easy ride, that I have reached my goal and it is on my right hand side, it was incorrect. The house, I was looking for, was on the other side of the road and a little bit further.\n\nWhen I was looking for the number of the house, I was waited. Peter waved to me from an open window on the upper floor. He looked very happy. His wife was at the front door, holding their 2 and a half year old daughter on her arms. It was a very happy welcome.\n\nWith all my stuff in the house and my e-bike in the garage, I was asked, what I would like to drink: Coffee or tea and I answered hot chocolate, please. I was just feeling for it and tried, if it was possible to get.\n\nPeter was very happy about my wish and told me, I will get a real Spanish hot chocolate. He had bought the powder in Spain some years ago. It took a while and did not really look like Spanish chocolate, but it tasted usual chocolate and was hot as well as sweet.\n\nAfterwards they showed me the most of their house, then Peter and his wife started with cooking dinner as well as he were chatting with me about my trip, the environment etc.\n\nWe have had the hot chocolate in the kitchen, but the dinner was served in the living room, where Peter had lit a fire in the fireplace. All of us around the table, I suddenly felt home and like I am staying with friends I have known for a long time. It really was strange.\n\nWe had discussions and where telling stories until late. We also talked about my lack of an upcoming host. I had tried for Osterholz-Scharmbeck as well as for Bremen, but had not got any answer. Peter told me, I should go via Worpswede – a well-known artist village. I was looking for a youth-hostel there and was happy to find one. On their page, it looked like there were still many rooms available. In addition to that, there was no need to cross the town of Bremen while going from Worpswede to Bad Zwischenahn (my next goal). I was happy for their advice.\n\n.\n\n18th September 2021\n\nHammah – Lilienthal; 71 km; host: None – I booked a hotel room last minute at “The Flying Guinea Fowl”\n\nI had breakfast with this lovely family in their living room and was ready to go around 10am. Peter checked my tires and pumped them up before he took photos of all of us together and promised to sent copies to me. Directly afterwards it was time to say good-bye. I will always remember this stay as very special.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThis day I actually took the time and made a photo of one of the pretty and typical houses for the area:\n\n.\n\n.\n\n… and later of another one:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nEven this day was very easy to ride and I was happy, when I arrived around 4pm in the town of Worpswede. I made the 1000 km full close to the place of Elm:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI directly was going to the hostel and tried my luck to get a bed. There was no receptionist, but an advice, to pick up the phone nearby and dial a short number. So did I. Unfortunately I was told, that there was no empty bed, though I tried to find a bed somewhere else. I did neither find any by booking.com nor by air b&b, but by the homepage of the tourism information. I tried to book the cheapest one, but only got the answer, that my request will be answered in a while. Meanwhile I was waiting for the answer, I was using booking.com again, looking for a bed close by. I hadn’t got an answer of the tourist information (by the way, I never did) when I booked a room in Lilienthal – around 10 km away. I still had some battery left and hoped, I will make it all the way there.\n\nIt was working! The town of Lilienthal was larger than I had expected, there was a tram as well. I think it connects the town with a larger town close by, the town of Bremen.\n\nThe hotel had a none human check-in, that means I had to pay for the night in a kind of vending machine, got my code for the house and the room as well as the room number. Well in front of the door of my room I used the code, but I could not open the room. I had to try several times, because the handle (just a long button to turn) was not working well – it slipped. First I sent a message to the hotel, but the answer was, we’ll get back to you within 24 hours. Though I tried more times and luckily finally it worked.\n\nThe room was under the roof and the space over the head would have been very low, if I had not decided to move the pillow to the other side of the bed. There was also a comfortable armchair and a desk in the room as well as a wardrobe. The bathroom was nice.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI did take a walk into town looking for a restaurant. The first place served pizza, I thought, but they only baked pizzas for orders. One could not eat there. Anyway, they were busy with the four ovens they had. After a while I came to a Greek restaurant. I read their menu, finding out, that they serve vegetarian meals as well. There were four of them to choose. Though I entered the restaurant and asked for a table. Luckily there was one for two and there was no reservation on it. The restaurant was full. I ordered the grilled vegetables with aubergine etc. I also got a salad, which I didn’t touch, because I became full anyway. I had an apple spritzer to drink. The whole meal was for 15.50 EUR and I gave 2 EUR as a tip. The waiter seemed to be a little disappointed before I did gave the tip, but grateful then. I think, it depended on, that I gave him a 20 EUR note as well as 50 cents. Therefore he was not expecting a tip.\n\nBack at the hotel I tried to update my blog, but didn’t get a lot done, because I was too tired.\n\n.\n\n19th September 2021\n\nLilienthal – Rostrup, Bad Zwischenahn; 80 km; host: Lydia Eibach (warmshowers)\n\nI had to leave the hotel room before 10am and I did 9:30am. There were already a male cleaner working on this floor. When I opened my door, he hurried downstairs and hid himself.\n\nFinally I had all my panniers etc carried downstairs, I left the house and packed my bike. I was going further soon, but found, that I have to cross the city of Bremen in it’s entire length. It went well. It actually was a comfortable route, even I sometimes felt like I was sent back and forth.\n\nI was looking for a gas station or an open shop, but it was Sunday. Not even the Lidl supermarket was open. Finally I found an open bakery. I did not have anything left to eat – I had eaten the last egg and the rest of the vegetarian sausage salad for breakfast, but a bar of chocolate, therefore I bought a croissant and an “American”, which is a special round cake with sugar icing. That was my lunch and I had it later, sitting in a bus booth.\n\nThe trip went well and I arrived at my destination for the day around 5pm. My host was not at home and I did not know, when she will come, because she was not answering my messages. I became nervous and tried to get in touch with another host, but meanwhile I was writing the request, my host arrived together with her boyfriend. She apologized so much. She had mixed up the weekdays, she told me. She welcomed me.\n\nHer boyfriend cooked the dinner, a chili sin carne sin chili 😉 and Lydia was chatting with me – about my trip and other travels (mine and hers).\n\nAll of us had dinner together, than he was going to the loft. Lydia and I continued chatting. When I had asked her, which subject she studies, she told me, she is studying to become a GP. Afterwards all was about health service etc. She also told me, that I can take pain killers, when my knees are hurting as well as I could buy an ointment against the inflammation in my knees at a drugstore. Furthermore she pointed out, that a drugstore is very close and gave me the directions. Even this day I was going to bed around 10pm – after Lydia had left the room.\n\n.\n\n20th September 2021 – Entering The Netherlands\n\nRostrup, Bad Zwischenahn – Blijham (Winschoten); 80 km; host: Anneke Hidding and family (warmshowers)\n\nI left Lydia and her boyfriend around 10am. The guy was one of the gentlemen, who helped me with my luggage, but Lydia helped me as well. Her boyfriend was interested in the technical details of my bike, especially the brakes. That was my opportunity to ask, how long my rear brake will work and he told me: around 30,000km. I was happy about that, because I had worried, that it don’t last so long at all.\n\nEven this day I was lucky. The weather was dry and the cycle path quite good. For the most it was flat.\n\nI entered the area of Ostfriesland and I have got that wonderful feeling, that I am soon in the Netherlands, what means, I have been coming a lot further since I started 1st September and it will be my 4th country, Sweden included, which I am riding my bike through on my way to my goal.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI was not only cycling throughout Leer, but also some small villages. At the countryside I found a bakery and café and stopped to buy some bread. They had a kind of very small pizzas, but unfortunately none vegetarian. Therefore I bought a big bun with cheese on the top and a croissant. I was sitting in the garden and finally, before continuing I used the bathroom.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nGoogle maps showed me roads off the grid and that way I was entering the Netherlands. I think, there was a bridge over a small river or stream. On both sides of it was a boom. On the German side I saw a bicycle and a man coming out off the bushes. It might have been a German officer. I don’t know, but he was looking surprised. I have got the idea, that this border was not used often.\n\nOn the side of the Netherlands none was watching. I just continued and also checked, if that really has been the border. The road was paved in the next village, but there was no cycle path (fietspad). I continued after the signs on the road as well as by Google maps. After around 30 minutes I arrived at my host’s home and they were already looking for me.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWhen I entered the street, where my host has her home, I decided to push my bike, because it was a dirt road.\n\nWell there, I was very welcomed by my host Anneke and her two eldest daughters: Janthe and Laura. Now also Anneke’s husband Robert showed up. I was shown the bed under the roof, where I could sleep and was then invited for dinner, which we had on the patio for lack of space in the house. The parents had decided to renovate a part of the house. It actually was the kitchen and the living room – they will have water piped underfloor heating and I was told, that it is hard to find craftsmen, because of the pandemic every house owner will renovate it’s house. Anneke manages the situation very well, has very good organized and the parents really work together to make it work, e.g. the camper van is put directly beside the main door of the house and Anneke is cooking there. I was also told, that they are lucky and have had dry weather all the time during which they could not eat in the house.\n\nDuring dinner I also got to know the youngest girl in the house: Sien and her brother Walt.\n\nI was not allowed to help with anything and was told, that I have been cycling all the day while Anneke has had a day off. We spent a couple of hours in their couch together, which they had moved into the master bedroom. Luckily the bathroom is working, so is the shower.\n\nBy the way, Anneke asked me quite early after my arrival, if I have hosts for all places in the Netherlands. When I told her, that I have no host for Groningen – maybe you remember, that I had a host in Yde, close to Groningen. Unfortunately the whole family had got the flew and since I knew that, I did look for a host i Groningen instead, which also had been my first choice. Anneke offered me to ask her brother to host me, who lives in Groningen. I agreed and she got a positive answer on her question.\n\n.\n\n21st September 2021\n\nBlijham to Groningen; 47 km; host: Jeroen Eefting (warmshowers)\n\nThe bike ride from Blijham to Groningen was like the bike rides in Northern Germany – even here was horse poo on the bike paths and also the bike paths were damaged off and on. It was getting better the closer I came to Groningen. However there was no longer a very need for Google maps, because of the signs on the bike path.\n\nUnfortunately, also in Groningen road work was ongoing, but the worst challenge in the traffic where the four-way-junctions, where all cyclists have to move at the same time. It was especially hard for me, because I am not so fast on the pedals and not riding so fast either like the people living in the Netherlands. I really was afraid a couple of times, that other cyclists would crash into my bike. I was happy, when I had found my hosts home and could put my bike aside.\n\nWhen I arrived, my host was still at work. Twice a week, he works as a postman. He starts at high noon and picks up the post sorted for streets and numbers.\n\nThere is a little yard with benches between the houses for one, where he is living. I took a seat on a bench and was waiting for him.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIf I remember right, I was waiting for an hour, but time did not feel long. He welcomed me and by entering his tiny house, he apologized for the mess, telling me, that it was for the short notice he had not have time to prepare the house for me. Together we put my bike in his backyard and he gave me a key, telling me, that the key both fits for the door to the backyard and the front-door.\n\nSoon he also told me, that these houses are in the social living program and added, that he has a diagnosis within the autism spectrum, get some money from the state, works as a postman two days a week, delivers medicine two days a week and volunteers one day a week in a secondhand shop. Furthermore he told me, that he was trying to take a master in social geography, but missed two exams. He is lucky, that he don’t need to pay back the students loan, because at that time still the old law was in effect. Nowadays that is changed. Also the law for social benefits for people with diagnoses has changed. Under the new rules, he would not be entitled to the benefit he gets.\n\nHe was then asking for my plans and what I want to eat for dinner and breakfast. I told him, that I will eat out and also go to a supermarket for something for my breakfast. He was happy about it – not so much for the money, but for the not expected situation. He also told me, that he always cooks his lunch for two days in a row and that he is not a good cook.\n\nHe explained, how to go to the city center, which is pretty close by walking. Soon I left for exploring the city of Groningen. In the direction I had to go I saw an interesting building – like a half of a globe and was going there, but first I did buy a soft ice-cream. The owner, of the place where I bought it, did not act service-minded. Though I decided not to buy there anything more. I was disappointed by the “half globe”, because it was only a café. I continued further to the center and came to the “Grote Markt”. Almost on one side of it where restaurants with tables and chairs on the marketplace. I chose one of them and ordered a Falafel in bread (it was not possible to get it with French fries) as well as a beer. After this dinner I was walking further, looking at all the beautiful old houses.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAt another marketplace there was an impressive building with columns at the entrance. I was very surprised, when I found a supermarket inside. Anyway, I took the opportunity and bought some food for breakfast. I was walking around a little longer, before I was going back to Jeroen’s home. He was coming home a few minutes later than me.\n\nWe had another chat – e.g. he explained, that the building with the columns and the supermarket inside had been a market hall. We were going to bed soon.\n\n.\n\n22nd September 2021 – Groningen\n\nI had breakfast around 9pm, but stayed in the house, updating my blog. After lunch, I walked to the city center again, but following a canal. I was disappointed, because of the seaweed and surprised, that birds and wild ducks were swimming in that sludge.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBack in the city center I took a lot of photos of beautiful buildings and also came to another canal.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nJeroen had recommended a vegan / vegetarian restaurant, before I left his home this day and I was going there for dinner. They opened at 5pm and I was their first guest, but soon they had more guests. Reading the menu, I understood, that their dishes are spicy and I asked, if there were none spicy dishes as well. The waiter offered to talk with the chef for a none spicy dish – the most expensive of them 🙄. When I well had got it served, it was spicy anyway. I only could eat part of it. For getting full, I was interested in a dessert and asked for the menu. Actually the desserts were very expensive, which even the main dishes were. I did not order a dessert. Anyway I had to pay 19.50 EUR and only have had a glass of water with the main dish.\n\n.\n\nInterior of the restaurant “bla bla” and the dish I paid for.\n\n.\n\nOn my way back to my host I entered a supermarket and bought waffles as well as yogurt. I had some of the waffles as a dessert, before I was going to sleep. – Jeroen was at home, when I arrived. He was watching TV and switched it off, when I talked with him.\n\n.\n\n23rd September 2021\n\nGroningen – Meppel; 77 km; host: Inge Leonora de Ouden (warmshowers)\n\nI left Jeroen at 8:30am this day, because the weather forecast promised rain in the afternoon. Unfortunately it was quite a bit windy. Some gusts did move my bike and me sideways, others came from the front and made it hard to succeed forward. I tried to save as much battery as possible to make it all the way to Inge’s home in Meppel.\n\nInge had invited me via the group warmshowers on Facebook. She told me, she is a Jehovah’s Witnesses, but we do not need to talk about God. I will see, if she really can help it. Otherwise I have to find another host. Most of the way I was riding my bike on the side of canals. I was afraid, that a wind gust could carry me into the canal, though I rode on the wrong side of the bike path.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI took a rest around 11am in a little village, when I saw a bench and ate cooked eggs, camembert and waffles as a dessert. I got full of it.\n\nAfter around three hours of biking, I was so tired of fighting the wind, I was going off my bike and pushing it for a little while. I also tried the battery lasting during the entire trip. Therefore I only used assistance level 3. Around 2pm it started drizzling, but not for long. Finally I reached the town of Meppel. I only had 10% of battery left and, when I was close to Inge’s home, only 4%, though I did push my bike the last km, that my battery will work properly in the future as well.\n\nI was welcomed by Inge and she showed me, where I could put my bike. I took my stuff into the room, she had showed me and I was offered coffee, which I really wished now. She also served a specialty from the Netherlands, a kind of hard waffle which was filled with jam and I liked.\n\nInge has two dogs at home. One of them moved in recently. Both are 14 years old. We had a conversation about my trip, COP26 and related subjects, before Inge had to take a walk with the dogs and offered me to follow as well as taking the route throughout the city center. Soon we were on our way, but I had forgotten to take my smartphone with me, that means I cannot present photos of beautiful or special houses of Meppel. Nearly back at her apartment again, it started drizzling again.\n\nSoon it was time for dinner – Inge eats dinner at 5pm. She had cooked a kind of vegetarian macaroni box. When we had finished eating, we stayed seated and were talking about family, art (she makes beautiful paintings), needlework and related subjects.\n\nShe also served tea with “cheese hearts” before we were going to bed. They were tasting very good – I could have eaten all there were.\n\nI could not fall asleep for a while for different reasons, though I updated my blog and I am happy, that I can present an up-to-date blog now.\n\n.\n\n24th September 2021\n\nMeppel – Apeldoorn – Beekbergen; 80 km; host: Krista van Velzen (warmshowers)\n\nThere is not much to write about my trip this day. It was as usual, even quite cold (around +14°C, which I feel cold, when biking). There were the usual Google maps issues. I didn’t see much of Apeldoorn, because Google maps did send me via the suburbs, which I actually appreciate. I don’t like cycling in the bigger cities. There is too much traffic, even cyclists as well as too many traffic lights, which means too many stops and starts. Anyway, when I found the address, there were some houses there with only one number. The biggest one had been a sanatorium for people who were suffering from tuberculosis. I had to message Krista and ask her, in which house she is living.\n\nKrista had messaged me before, that I was invited for a dinner with people from Extinction Rebellion on my arrival day as well as she told me, the press will be there.\n\nShe was herself disappointed, that she only was invited for talking in the local radio and no press was interested in my trip.\n\nThe dinner was a tasty soup and a fruit salad. There were Krista and her boyfriend, a father with his son and daughter and another man. Krista explained, that the group recently started and they hope for more members soon. One of them left an envelop, which another member, who could not make it to this meeting, had left for me. There were 50 EUR in that envelop. I could not refuse that gift.\n\nI had asked for a soft chair, when I arrived, though, when we moved out into the garden for dinner, the chair was moved out as well. I also was asked about the day before and if I have had a good sleep. When I told them, that I was freezing the night before and did not sleep well, they did put the heating on in “my” room.\n\nWhen the other members had left, Krista started a conversation, asking me more about myself etc. She also told me, that the rent for that house is cheap, because the owner has not decided yet, what he wants to do with it and they can have to move out very quickly. We were to bed around 11pm and an early day was awaiting us. It was really hot in the room, they lend me, though I switched off the heating.\n\n.\n\n25th September 2021\n\nBeekbergen – Utrecht; 78 km; host: Adrian\n\nWe were up quite early and breakfast was already ready, when I came down to the living-room. Directly afterwards we packed – Krista and Michel were going to a demonstration with the motto “More bikes no bombs” and I was going further.\n\nMy host in Utrecht is not (yet) a couchsurfing or warmshowers host. It was my former host Lucas, who had helped me with this contact. When Google maps told me, that I had arrived at his home, I was confused. I was looking for all the houses respectively doors, which should be in this area. I could not see the number of the house from some meters away, though I was going closer to it. The house has a name: Berk (Birch/Birke/Björk) and then I saw the numbers. Each apartment has an own number like otherwise houses have. I ringed the bell and it activated a security system. Adrian could see me by a camera. He did speak Swedish with me, what I realized, when I had answered in English. He was coming down soon and he helped me with my bicycle and put it into his store room. The panniers, battery etc did we take with us into his apartment on the fourth floor. Luckily, there is an elevator in the house he lives.\n\nAdrian has been working in Sweden for a lot of years, therefore he speaks Swedish and Lucas and he know each other from that time.\n\nWe took a walk together to a supermarket and came throughout a park. On the other side of the park is a shopping center. Meanwhile he bought something, he needed, I did buy, something I want. I still had the cheese from the farner’s shop, though I bought bread and also a smoothy as well as a banana and a yogurt.\n\nBack at his home he served dinner soon. He was setting the table very nice, even with a candle. We had a soup with broccoli, spinach and chick peas, which I liked. The main dish was a warm pasta creation with vegetables and more. He served a salad as well, which was spicy. He told me then, he put some chili in. If I remember right, we also had a dessert.\n\nWe were talking during the meal and he decided soon to start with couchsurfing, because he likes to get to know people and has discussions with them and learn of their experiences.\n\nUnfortunately I had to try to change my itinerary and find a host for Harwich, because I finally had decided not to go to Calais for crossing the channel. I have two reasons for it. On the one hand side, I could not find hosts in the South of the Netherlands, Bruges (BE) and Calais (FR). On the other side, I get more and more tired by biking day after day. I hope, I will make it to Glasgow. The shortened route gives me also the opportunity to make less km a day – if it fits with the beds for the nights. I did not get a lot done this evening, I cannot really see, which opportunities there are in minor places. – Adrian was watching TV meanwhile I tried to change my itinerary.\n\n.\n\n26th September 2021\n\nUtrecht – Rotterdam; 65 km; host: Hanneke Vis (warmshowers)\n\nThis Sunday I was on my way further a little earlier than usual. Adrian had to leave for his Sunday swimming training at 10:30am. I did not have to leave earlier than usual, but it just happened, that I was on my way half an hour earlier than usual. Adrian did take photos of me and also made a selfie with both of us. In addition to that he told me, that I am welcome even on my way home (like most of my hosts did).\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI had only to go by bike in around 60 km, but they felt very long – maybe because of the warm weather. I had not come very far, when I was wondering, if I was on the right way, when a woman on a moped asked me, what I am looking for and then described the route for me. She also told me, that there are minor road works on that route, but I could push my bike through. Actually I could ride my bike all the time, because the work was only on the road and, because of it was Sunday, no work was done and the bike path not impacted.\n\nI had messaged my new host, Hanneke, that I will arrive around 2pm, but couldn’t make it. Though I was happy, when I read she will not be at home before 4:15pm. Around halfway I found a bench to sit and have my lunch – close to a town center and a church nearby, which clock did play a short melody every quarter of an hour. Even it was nice, if I would live there, I think I would not like too hear it so often. By the way, there was a biker sitting on that bench, when I arrived. Meanwhile I was taking my lunch off the bike and locked it, he was going further.\n\nI didn’t make it to 4:15 either. I became so tired, when there were another construction work by which the road was closed and I continued in the only possible direction, but Google maps told me several times “make a u-turn”. Fortunately I found a bench, where I could sit for a while. I locked my bicycle, because I was afraid to fall asleep. I did not fall asleep, because I was afraid, that someone could steel my panniers, but the rest was helping me to finally arrive at Hanneke’s home. During the other half of the day’s ride, I used assistance level 4 and 5. The Netherlands are not so very flat here.\n\nI was already awaited, when I finally arrived. I had sent another message, when I had sat on that bench. Close to my host’s home, I had pushed my bike again. Otherwise it was not possible to read the names of the street, which was necessary. When I arrived, there was not the name of my host at the door, even I was at the right one. Though I sent another message to her. She opened the front door av the house immediately.\n\nHere in Rotterdam every apartment has it’s own number, similar to, but different as I described you that house in Utrecht. Here the apartments in the house have a number and a capital letter. The apartment on the ground floor has the letter A behind the number, on the second floor the letter B etc.\n\nTogether did Hanneke and I carry my bike into her garden. Lucky us, that she lives on the first floor and has a garden. I had taken off the panniers, the battery etc before we carried the bike into the house, of course.\n\nHanneke really welcomed me. After a short chat she served dinner. We were talking about warmshowers, hosting, couchsurfing etc until around 9pm, when she was going to bed, because she had an early morning next day.\n\n.\n\n27th September 2021\n\nI had a day off in Rotterdam and was first taking the PCR-test, which is mandatory for being allowed to enter England – even for fully vaccinated people. By that I finally know, how to take such a test properly. The male nurse did it first in my mouth – not really as long back as I thought, one has to do and then, with the same stick in my nose, which did tickle.\n\nI continued to the town center by walking and came throughout a tunnel, called the Maastunnel. It was only for pedestrians and cyclists, but there were two floors. The upper floor was for cyclists and the lower floor for pedestrians. In front of the cyclists floor was an officer each on both sides, that people were using the correct floor. For coming down to the cyclist floor, there were escalators. From that floor to the pedestrians floor were stairs, but there was also en elevator on each side of the tunnel. The tunnel inside was very simple, only on the wall above the escalators were paintings as well as there were photos on the side of the escalators, which seems to be old and a little difficult to use. Anyway, most of the cyclists were handy, taking there bikes up and down by the escalators. The tunnel itself was not decorated. Leaving the entrance on the other side, I saw another nice painting.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWhile I continued into the city, I was coming along a harbor, where tourist boats were anchored. One of them offered “as much you can eat pancakes” during the sightseeing, but they were not working on Mondays.\n\nOn the other side of the road was the “Euromast” – a tower with a restaurant, a sightseeing platform and more. Eating at the restaurant, one was forced to pre-book and upon arrival show the ticket, an ID and the COVID-19 vaccination or similar. For sightseeing only there were no restrictions. As an elderly person I only did have to pay one (1) EUR less than younger adults. The restaurant was on platform 4, the sightseeing platform was on level 5. From there it was possible to take stairs to a kind of elevator to go up to 185 meters. I was happy with the sightseeing platform and took some photos. I also watched two barges leaving respectively entering a lock. I can tell you, that I have seen all of Rotterdam ;-).\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe next place to name was the museums-park. There were flowers still in bloom.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI thought, I already was in the city center, when I saw the statue below, but Google maps was right this time, telling me, I was not.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSoon I came too an area with a lot of restaurants and beautiful buildings. The area was called the “Witte de Withkwartier”.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAt a combined café / bicycle shop I had a smoothie (vanilla, mango, banana) and a bit of an apple-cinnamon-cake. Unfortunately the smoothie did taste synthetic, even it had been in a blender and the cake tasted mostly cinnamon and only had a few, very small pieces of apple. I paid 9.50 EUR. Both together, were not worth its price.\n\nI was looking for the Market Hall, because I thought, I will find there genuine Dutch food. I checked all the stalls when I finally was there, but only the cheese seemed to be originally Dutch. There were two stalls with cheese. One of them had three packs of small cheese, made by cow, goat and sheep each. They also had bigger cheese, but it seemed, they only sold the three-packs and the others were for decoration only. At the other stall with cheese, one could buy bigger and smaller parts as wished from a lot of different kind of cheese. Unfortunately it was first crowded at this stall and when I returned to it, nobody was there.\n\nFurthermore there was a Portuguese stall. There were e.g. “pastel de nata” sold. I could not resist the temptation and bought two – one I had thought for my host.\n\nI was still hungry, though I had a meal as well. I chose a Lebanese counter. They had lots of different dishes, but I was afraid, that they would be too spicy, therefore I only ordered a warm sandwich with Brie and avocado. The sales assistant had recommended the cheese with walnut and honey and I was surprised, when I had both, walnut, honey and avocado on it. I had a bottle of still water as well.\n\nFinally on my way out of the market hall, it had started raining. First I waited indoors, but when it came a little less rain I started walking. My rain jacket is not really waterproof even it officially is. Therefore it does not help to put something under the jacket. I realized that soon and decided to eat the pastel de nata, when the rain became heavier again. I was standing in a roofed gate at that time. Afterwards I walked further in the direction, where I was coming from – I had no problems to remember it. Only a few minutes later I was taking protection under another roof, because the rain became heavier again. I was happy, that I had found that one, because the rain increased. When I continued, it was still raining, but not so much anymore. I found the way back to the tunnel, partly with the help of the signs for pedestrians. You have to know, that the signs for bicycles and pedestrians are similar in size, but not in colors.\n\nI entered the tunnel, happy not to get more vet. Leaving the tunnel, it had stopped raining. Anyway, I checked Google maps to find the shortest way “home”. I could not have it on all the time, because my phone was low in battery and I had not taken a power-bank with me.\n\nSoon I entered Hanneke’s apartment, I charged my phone by a power-bank, checked my messages and started updating my blog.\n\nHanneke came home earlier than expected, but tired. She watched TV for around half an hour and was then using her smartphone, though I continued updating my blog and I was happy about, that I could do that.\n\n.\n\n28th September 2021 – Entering Great Britain\n\nRotterdam – Hook of Holland – Harwich; 35 + 5 km; host: None, I had a room at the Goodlife Guesthouse.\n\nI was up early, because Hanneke had to leave early for her job and we had to mov"
