        "text": "METHOD DETAILS\n\nGeneration of chemosensory receptor QF2 and Split-QF2 knock-in strains\n\nT2A-QF2 gene-sparing stop codon replacement lines were generated using the strategy outlined in Matthews et al. (2019). sgRNAs were placed as close to the stop codon as possible and donor constructs were designed to remove the stop codon and replace it with an in-frame cassette containing the T2A ribosomal skipping sequence and the QF2 transcription factor or Split-QF2 domains, comprising the QF2 activation domain QF2-AD, or the QF2 DNA-binding domain QF2-DBD. This strategy spares the function of the gene at the locus being targeted, expresses QF2 or Split-QF2 domains in the cells specified by enhancers at the locus. Insertions were marked by the 3xP3 enhancer expressing a fluorescent protein. To identify effective sgRNAs, 5 candidate sgRNAs per gene were first injected into separate pools of 500 Liverpool embryos and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated cut rate was evaluated as previously described (Kistler et al., 2015). Either a single sgRNA or 2 sgRNAs with the highest cut rates were then chosen to be injected with donor plasmids to target chemosensory gene loci using homology-directed repair. sgRNAs targeted the respective gene near the stop codon, target sequence with protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) underlined:\n\nIr25a: GTTTGTGTGCGTGTCCGTA TGG\n\nIr76b: GTATTACACTTATCTAAATA TGG\n\nIr8a: GTCACGCTTGTTGTACAGGG CGG, GAACAATTTGAACAAGGTCG TGG\n\nGr3: GTTAGTGATGCATAATATGA CGG\n\nOrco: GTCACCTACTTCATGGTGT TGG\n\nsgRNA DNA template was prepared by annealing oligonucleotides as described (Kistler et al., 2015). In vitro transcription was performed using HiScribe Quick T7 kit (NEB E2050S) following the manufacturer’s directions. Following transcription and DNAse treatment for 15 min at 37°C, sgRNA was purified using RNAse-free SPRI beads (Ampure RNAclean, Beckman-Coulter A63987), and eluted in Ultrapure water (Invitrogen, 10,977–015).\n\nDonor plasmids were constructed by Gibson assembly using the following fragments for QF2 lines:\n\npUC19 digested with XbaI and BamHI\n\nLeft and right homology arms: Gr3 (left: 1.9 kb, right: 1.6 kb), Ir25a (left: 1.8 kb, right: 1.6 kb), Ir76b (left: 1.2 kb, right: 2.2 kb), Ir8a (left: 1.7 kb, right: 1.7 kb), Orco (left: 1.2 kb, right: 1.3 kb) generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Liverpool genomic DNA as a template\n\nA 2.6 kb fragment containing T2A-QF2-SV40, 3xP3-dsRed, PCR-amplified from a previously assembled vector (ppk10779-T2A-QF2-SV40, 3xP3-dsRed, Addgene accession #130667)\n\nFor Split-QF2 lines, donor plasmids were constructed by generating fragments using PCR from the indicated template with indicated primers in Data S1 and assembled using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB E5520S):\n\nIr25a-T2A-QFAD::Zip+-SV40-3xP3-eYFP-SV40 was composed of:\n\nPlasmid backbone with Ir25 homology arms from Ir25a-T2A-QF2 plasmid (6 kb)\n\nT2A-QFAD::Zip+-SV40 sequence from (Riabinina et al., 2019), fragment synthesized by Genewiz, sequence in Data S1 (1.5 kb)\n\n3xP3-EYFP-SV40 from pDSAY (Addgene, #62291) (1.2 kb)\n\nOrco-T2A-Zip–::QFDBD-SV40-3xP3-dsRED-SV40 was composed of:\n\nPlasmid backbone with Orco homology arms and 3xP3-dsRED-SV40 from Orco-T2A-QF2 plasmid (6.3 kb)\n\nT2A-Zip–::QFDBD-SV40 synthesized by Genewiz, sequence in Data S1 (1.5 kb)\n\nFor all QF2 and Split-QF2 constructs, the stop codon of the endogenous gene was removed and the PAM sequences corresponding to the sgRNAs used for injection were modified by PCR mutagenesis during Gibson assembly by introducing synonymous codon substitutions to protect the sequence from Cas9 cleavage while retaining the amino acid identity. Plasmids were isolated using an endotoxin-free plasmid midiprep kit (Macherey-Nagel) for QF2 lines and NucleoBond Xtra Midi Endotoxin-Free plasmid kit (Clontech 740,420.50) for Split-QF2 lines and eluted in ultrapure water prior to injection. Donor plasmids are available at Addgene (accession numbers #162520–162526). Approximately 2,000 wild-type Liverpool strain Ae. aegypti embryos were injected with a mix containing recombinant Cas9 protein (PNA Bio, CP01) at 300 ng/μL, sgRNAs at 40 ng/μL and donor DNA plasmid (300 ng/μL for QF2 lines, 600 ng/μL for Split-QF2 lines) at the Insect Transformation Facility at the University of Maryland Institute for Bioscience & Biotechnology Research. Embryos were hatched and surviving G0 males and females were crossed to wild-type Liverpool mosquitoes and their G1 offspring were screened for fluorescence indicating positive stable germ line transformants. For QF2 lines, the fidelity of insertion was verified by PCR and Sanger sequencing. One representative line for each chemosensory receptor QF2 knock-in was selected for further study. QF2-driven expression patterns were examined by crossing to QUAS-CD8:GFP-3xP3-ECFP and/or QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s-3xP3-ECFP.\n\nA technical problem arose in the construction of the QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s-3xP3-ECFP plasmid that caused only a single copy of dTomato to be introduced into the mosquito, rather than the brighter tandem dTomato or tdTomato that is more conventionally used. Nevertheless we found that dTomato is sufficiently bright for our experiments (Shaner et al., 2004).\n\nAll lines were outcrossed to wild-type Liverpool mosquitoes for at least 3 generations prior to being used in experiments. For Split-QF2 lines, a single family with the correct insertion was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing for Ir25a-QF2-AD and Orco-QF2-DBD. To propagate these lines, a male founder was chosen to cross to wild-type Liverpool females. Animals were then back-crossed to Liverpool for at least 2 additional generations. To evaluate if the Split-QF2 system was functional in Ae. aegypti, Ir25a-QF2-AD was crossed to QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s. The resulting Ir25a-QF2-AD, QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s animals were then crossed to Orco-QF2-DBD. Expression of the dTomato reporter was observed in larval antennae and subsequently confirmed in adult antennae and brains.\n\nQUAS transgenic strains\n\nQUAS-CD8:GFP-3xP3-ECFP and QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s-3xP3-ECFP transgenic strains were described previously (Matthews et al., 2019). Two independent insertions of the QUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s-3xP3-ECFP reporter line (Jové et al., 2020; Matthews et al., 2019) were used in this study. These are located on different chromosomes and were used according to the crossing scheme needed for a given experiment. See Data S1 for details.\n\nChemosensory receptor mutant strains\n\nThe three chemosensory receptors mutant strains used in this study was previously described: Ir25aBamHI/BamHI (De Obaldia et al., 2022), Gr34/4 (McMeniman et al., 2014), Orco16/16 (DeGennaro et al., 2013). Gr34/4 and Orco16/16 were generated in the Orlando background (here referred to as +/+ORL) and the Ir25aBamHI/BamHI mutant was generated in the Liverpool background (here referred to as +/+LVP). To account for possible difference in genetic background the +/+ORL strain was used as the controls in all experiments where the Gr34/4 and Orco16/16 mutants were used, and the +/+LVP strain was used as the control in experiments where the Ir25aBamHI/BamHI mutant was used.\n\nTranscript abundance estimates of Ae. aegypti OR, IR, and GR genes\n\nExpression values for adult sugar-fed, non-blood-fed female sensory tissues were retrieved from the Ae. aegypti L5 genome GitHub repository (https://github.com/VosshallLab/AGWG-AaegL5) at this link: https://github.com/VosshallLab/AGWG-AaegL5/raw/master/AGWG%20AaegL5%20Chemoreceptor%20TPM.xlsx. These expression values reflect libraries from a previous transcriptome study (Matthews et al., 2016) that had been aligned to the Ae. aegypti genome (AaegL5) and chemosensory receptor geneset annotation reported in units of Transcripts Per Million (TPM) (Matthews et al., 2018). The number of genes from each of three gene families (ORs, IRs, and GRs) with expression values above the indicated threshold were plotted in and and are available in Data S1.\n\nWhole brain fixation and immunofluorescence\n\nDissection of adult brains and immunofluorescence was carried out as previously described (Matthews et al., 2019). 6-14-day-old mosquitoes were anesthetized on wet ice. Heads were carefully removed from the body by pinching at the neck with sharp forceps. Heads were placed in a 1.5 mL tube for fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 M Millonig’s Phosphate Buffer (pH 7.4), 0.25% Triton X-100, and nutated for 3 h. Brains were then dissected out of the head capsule in ice-cold Ca+2-, Mg+2-free PBS (PBS, Lonza 17-517Q) and transferred to a 24-well plate. All subsequent steps were done on a low-speed orbital shaker. Brains were washed in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 (PBT) at room temperature 6 times for 15 min. Brains were permeabilized with PBS, 4% Triton X-100, 2% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch #005-000-121) for ~48 h (2 nights) at 4 °C. Brains were rinsed once and then washed with PBT at room temperature 6 times for 15 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.25% Triton X-100, 2% normal goat serum for ~48 h (2 nights) at 4 °C. Brains were rinsed once then washed in PBT at room temperature 6 times for 15 min. Secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.25% Triton X-100, 2% normal goat serum for ~48 h (2 nights) at 4 °C. Brains were rinsed once then washed in PBT at room temperature 6 times for 15 min. Brains were equilibrated overnight in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories H-1000) and were mounted in Vectashield. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Brp/nc82 (mouse; 1:50, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank – see below) and/or anti-GFP (rabbit: 1:10,000; Life Technologies A-11122). The secondary antibodies used in all experiments except Figures S1A and S1P were anti-mouse-Cy5 (1:250; Life Technologies A-10524) and anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11034). In Figures S1A and S1P, the secondary antibody was anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11001) and in Figures S1A and S1P, the secondary antibodies were anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11005) and anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11034).\n\nPurification of nc82/Brp monoclonal antibody\n\nHybridoma cells expressing monoclonal antibody nc82 (Antibody Registry ID: AB_2314866), which recognizes the D. melanogaster Brp protein (Wagh et al., 2006) developed by Erich Buchner were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, created by the NICHD of the NIH and maintained at The University of Iowa, Department of Biology, Iowa City, IA 52242. Frances Weis-Garcia and the members of the MSKCC Antibody and Bioresource Core Facility subsequently used these hybridoma cells to purify this monoclonal antibody. The hybridoma was adapted to Gibco Hybridoma-SFM (Cat # 12,045,084) and 1% fetal bovine serum prescreened for ultra-low levels of bovine Ig. Antibody expression was confirmed and the adapted hybridoma was inoculated into the cell compartment of the Corning CELLine Disposable Bioreactor (Cat # 353, 137) in 15 mL of Hybridoma-SFM + 0.5% fetal bovine serum (production media) at 3 million viable cells/ml. The media compartment of the flask contained 350 mL of production media. The bioreactor was incubated at 37°C with 7% CO2 for 3 days, at which time the cells and media containing nc82 were harvested. 30 million viable cells from the harvest were re-inoculated back into the cell compartment in 30 mL fresh production media. The media in the media compartment was replaced the following day with 650 mL production media. Three days later, the media in the media compartment was replaced with 1,000 mL production media, with the next harvest 3 days later (7 days after the previous harvest). Cells were harvested weekly and fed biweekly until the desired amount of monoclonal antibody was reached. After the first harvest, each one contained about 3 mg of monoclonal antibody nc82/mL production media. The harvests to be purified were pooled, centrifuged at 12,855 x g for 15 min 6.5 mg/run were loaded onto a Cytiva (formerly GE Life Sciences) 1 mL HiTrap Protein G HP antibody purification column (Cat # 29,048,581) at 1 mL/min. The column was then washed with 0.02 M Sodium Phosphate (pH 7.0) before the monoclonal antibody was eluted with 0.1 M Glycine-HCl (pH 2.7). One mL fractions were collected and immediately neutralized with 60 mL of 1.0 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The harvest, flow through and fractions from the peak were run on an a 10% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Cat # 345-0010) to confirm purity and determine which should be pooled. The pooled fractions of monoclonal antibody were dialyzed into PBS overnight using dialysis tubing (Spectrum 132,544) with a 50 kDa MWCO. Another 10% SDS-PAGE was run, and the concentration determined using the absorbance at 280 using an extinction coefficient of 1.43.\n\nGeneration of the Ir25a polyclonal antibody\n\nRabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against Ir25a by Proteintech Group Inc. Antibodies were raised against a protein fusion of the 67 C-terminal amino acids of Ir25a and glutathione S-transferase. cDNA corresponding to the C-terminal region was inserted into the expression vector PGEX-4T using primers TTTTGGATCCAAATACCGCAAGAACGTAAAG and TTTTCTCGAGTTAGAAACGA GATTTAAAGTTG and expressed in bacterial strain BL21. A purified 31 kDA fusion protein was used to immunize 2 rabbits. Serum was affinity purified to a final concentration of 450 μg/mL and tested by whole mount antenna immunofluorescence comparing +/+LVP to Ir25aBamHI/BamHI. Antibodies from one of the two rabbits were found to selectively label +/+LVP antennae, and only this antibody was used in all further studies.\n\nFemale antennal lobe confocal imaging\n\nAll brains were imaged using a Zeiss Inverted LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 25x/0.8 NA immersion-corrected objective unless otherwise noted. Glycerol was used as the immersion medium to most closely match the refractive index of the mounting medium Vectashield. Antennal lobes in , , , S1, S2, S3, and S4 were imaged at either 1024 x 1024 or 2048 x 2048 pixel resolution in X and Y with 0.5 μm Z-steps for a final voxel size of either 0.0615 × 0.0615 × 0.5 μm3 or 0.1230 × 0.1230 × 0.5 μm3. Both conditions oversampled relative to the objective resolution and no differences were noted between imaging conditions. The laser intensity and gain were adjusted along the z axis to account for a loss of intensity due to depth and care was taken to avoid saturation and ensure that the deepest glomeruli were visible for segmentation. We note that all confocal imaging was conducted in a manner that would maximize our ability to visualize the boundaries between glomeruli and to determine the presence or absence of a given fluorophore in each glomerulus, and was not intended as a quantitative measure of fluorescence intensity. 3xP3 was used as a promoter to express fluorescent proteins as markers for the knock-ins and QUAS transgenes used in this study, and care was taken to distinguish expression derived from the 3XP3 promoter from the expression of the QF2 driver and QUAS effector lines under investigation. 3xP3 drives expression in the optic lobes, as well as some cells in the dorsal brain. Neither area overlaps with the antennal lobes. As reported previously (Matthews et al., 2019), we saw no 3xP3-driven expression in the antennal lobes in the reporter lines alone (data not shown). Representative antennal lobe images presented in the figures were cropped to remove 3xP3-driven expression elsewhere in the brain.\n\nMale brain and female subesophageal zone confocal imaging\n\nAll male brains ( , , , , and ) and all female subesophageal zones (Figure S4G) were imaged using a Zeiss Inverted LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 25x/0.8 NA immersion-corrected objective. Glycerol was used as the immersion medium to most closely match the refractive index of the mounting medium Vectashield. Brains were imaged at 1024 X 1024 pixel resolution in X and Y with 0.5 μm Z-steps for a final voxel size of 0.2372 × 0.2372 × 0.5 μm3 (male brain) or 0.2076 × 0.2076 × 0.5 μm3 (female subesophageal zone). The laser intensity and gain were adjusted along the z axis to account for a loss of intensity due to depth and care was taken to avoid saturation and ensure that the deepest regions of the brain were visible. Confocal images of the brain were processed in ImageJ/FIJI (NIH) (Schindelin et al., 2012).\n\nAdditional technical notes on expression and projection patterns in subesophageal zone\n\nIr25a-expressing neurons send extensive projections to the subesophageal zone, with axons terminating in the anterior and posterior regions. There is a small cluster of glomeruli in the central subesophageal zone that receives dense innervation as well (Figure S4). Orco-expressing neurons do not project to the anterior region and send sparse projections to the posterior subesophageal zone and subesophageal zone glomeruli (Figure S4). Innervation by the neurons that co-express Orco and Ir25a send projections only to the posterior-ventral subesophageal zone, with the densest innervation in the medial region and sparser lateral arborizations (Figure S4). Ir25a complexes can mediate detection of volatile odorants and gustatory cues.\n\nAntennal lobe glomerulus quantification\n\nConfocal images of the antennal lobes in , , , S1, S2, S3, and S4 were processed in ImageJ/FIJI (NIH) (Schindelin et al., 2012). The number of glomeruli was quantified as follows: a single region of interest (ROI) was manually drawn around each glomerulus at a section approximately central along the z axis. Every glomerulus was outlined and an ROI set was collected that contained the outlines of all glomeruli. Glomeruli were then separated into two groups, GFP-positive and GFP-negative glomeruli, as determined by eye. A count of each was made to determine the number of glomeruli labeled by each line as well as the total number of glomeruli. The ROIs were flattened along the z axis to enable representation of the data in two dimensions in , , S1, S2, S3, and S4. The left antennal lobe in 3 brains was analyzed for each genotype in except for Gr3, for which the left antennal lobe was analyzed in 1 brain, and both left and right antennal lobes were analyzed in an additional 4 brains in Figure S1. Although we were able to recognize general regions of the antennal lobe, the interindividual variability made it impossible to identify most glomeruli by shape alone. We therefore have not attempted to name and number every glomerulus in Ae. aegypti as has been done in previous studies (Ignell et al., 2005; Shankar and McMeniman, 2020). As noted by Ito et al. (2014), there is considerable confusion about the use of coordinate axes in the brains of animals in general and insects in particular. The glomeruli in the antennal lobe of Ae. aegypti were originally named by Ignell et al. (2005) using a set of coordinate axes that differ from those consistently used in D. melanogaster (Couto et al., 2005; Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005; Grabe et al., 2015; Laissue et al., 1999; Stocker et al., 1990). A recent study of the antennal lobe of Ae. aegypti renamed glomeruli to account for this discrepancy in coordinate axes (Shankar and McMeniman, 2020), and throughout this paper we use the same coordinate axes they have implemented. While Shankar and McMeniman renamed most antennal lobe regions and glomeruli, they chose not to rename the MD (Medio-Dorsal) cluster of glomeruli comprising MD1, MD2, and MD3 whose sensory input derives from the maxillary palp. We have observed in our study that the MD glomeruli are medial, but they are not notably dorsal, and therefore refer to them as Glomerulus 1, Glomerulus 2, and Glomerulus 3 in this paper for simplicity. While there is utility in naming glomeruli, we suspect that the Ae. aegypti mosquito antennal lobe atlas will be refined in the future with the advent of new genetic tools that will unambiguously allow the field to distinguish and name genetically identifiable glomeruli. We found that the size, shape, and number of antennal lobe glomeruli in Ae. aegypti was variable from animal to animal. It is possible that the boundaries between glomeruli are not easily distinguished by synaptic staining and that specific glomeruli will become identifiable once there are genetic tools available that label smaller populations of OSNs. The anatomical variability we see is consistent with both the original map that identified 50 glomeruli (Ignell et al., 2005), which divided glomeruli into 3 classes based on their variability in location, as well as a recent study that looked specifically at the size and shape of glomeruli across animals (Shankar and McMeniman, 2020) and revised the original map to a count of ~80 glomeruli. Shankar and McMeniman named and numbered these glomeruli across animals, but they noted that they were only able to consistently identify 63 glomeruli. This is similar to the ~65 glomeruli we observed in our work. While there is not yet a clear consensus on the exact number of antennal lobe glomeruli in Ae. aegypti, the number of chemosensory receptors expressed in the antenna and maxillary palp is at least twice as large as any of the estimates of glomerulus number. The variability in antennal lobe structure appears at first to contrast with D. melanogaster, where each glomerulus can be clearly identified and named. However, we note that the antennal lobe map in D. melanogaster has been refined with the advent of new genetic techniques, starting with 35 glomeruli in the original atlas (Stocker et al., 1990), then modified to 40 glomeruli (Laissue et al., 1999), and further refined in numerous studies (Couto et al., 2005; Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005; Tanaka et al., 2012) including a recent count of 54 (Grabe et al., 2015) and 58 (Task et al., 2022) glomeruli. We have refrained from naming glomeruli in Ae. aegypti at this time because we believe that a more stereotyped arrangement will emerge as new genetic lines are generated that allow cell-type-specific labeling. A recent study in the mosquito An. gambiae using mosquitoes that label Orco-expressing olfactory neurons also noted that the antennal lobe was variable between animals relative to D. melanogaster (Riabinina et al., 2016). It is therefore possible that mosquito antennal lobes are more variable than Drosophilids (Grabe et al., 2015; Prieto-Godino et al., 2017). Variability in olfactory bulb structure is seen even in the mouse, Mus musculus, where the principles of olfactory organization were first established (Schaefer et al., 2001; Strotmann et al., 2000; Zou et al., 2009). The exact size and location of glomeruli can vary between animals more than initially appreciated and appears to be determined by both genetic factors and activity in OSNs during the early life of the animal. In D. melanogaster, glomerulus size is highly genetically determined and correlates strongly with the number of OSNs that innervates each glomerulus (Grabe et al., 2015). Whether the variability in glomerulus size in the mosquito is due to activity-dependent changes in structure or other factors remains to be seen.\n\nAdditional technical notes on expression and projection patterns of chemosensory receptor knock-in strains\n\nOrco-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP.\n\nWe noted that the intensity of GFP varies between glomeruli in this driver line, with some bright and others comparably dim. We speculate that this is due to a combination of the variability in Orco expression levels in individual neurons and variability in the density of innervation in individual glomeruli. A large region of the anterior ventral antennal lobe was previously referred to as the Johnston’s organ center and was thought to comprise a single large glomerulus (Ignell et al., 2005). In other insect species, Johnston’s organ mediates detection of auditory cues. Consistent with a recent study (Shankar and McMeniman, 2020), we segmented this region into multiple glomeruli based on anatomical boundaries revealed with Brp immunofluorescence. Glomeruli in this region are innervated by Orco-expressing neurons, calling into doubt the original report that these glomeruli process auditory stimuli and suggesting instead that they serve an olfactory function. In support of this hypothesis, the analogous area of the An. coluzzii antennal lobe has been shown to receive projections from Orco-expressing OSNs (Riabinina et al., 2016). We also observed GFP projections into the subesophageal zone in Orco-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP animals, which appear to derive from expression in the proboscis, the primary taste organ in insects. This is consistent with similar expression in An. coluzzii (Riabinina et al., 2016) and functional data in An. gambiae showing that olfactory responses are detected in this gustatory organ (Kwon et al., 2006).\n\nIr25a-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP.\n\nThe intensity of GFP projections varies between glomeruli in this driver line, with some bright and other comparably dim, as noted for Orco-QF2. The brightest glomeruli are primarily medial and anterior. We see the dimmest innervation in the area previously described as Johnston’s organ center as well as in the central antennal lobe. Labeling was also seen in other areas of the brain, most notably the subesophageal zone and anterior mechanosensory motor center.\n\nIr8a-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP.\n\nDepending on the brain being analyzed there were either 2 or 3 medial glomeruli labeled in this line. In the cases where there were 3 medial glomeruli, this third medial glomerulus was innervated by a few large-diameter axons. These were larger and sparser than the smaller axons that densely innervated most other glomeruli in this line. We also note that there are 2–3 cell bodies that express GFP located in the cell body rind lateral to the antennal lobe (rALl). We are unable to definitively describe where these cells project without genetic reagents that selectively label these cells, but they appear to send bilateral processes that cross the midline within what appears to be the saddle to innervate the anterior mechanosensory motor center outside the antennal lobe. All naming is in accordance with the new insect brain nomenclature presented in Ito et al. (2014).\n\nIr76b-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP.\n\nIn addition to projections to the antennal lobe, this line shows innervation of the subesophageal zone of the brain.\n\nGr3-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP.\n\nAll antennal lobes in this line show innervation of a single glomerulus (also referred to as ”MD1” and here referred to as “Glomerulus 1”; (Ignell et al., 2005; Shankar and McMeniman, 2020). In several brains, we saw a second small medial glomerulus that derives its innervation from the antenna and is in a small medial cluster of landmark glomeruli midway down the anterior-posterior axis closest to the center of the brain. Innervation appears to come from only a few axons. This low and variable reporter expression is consistent with the low level of expression of Gr3 in the antennal transcriptome (Matthews et al., 2016). Because this line only shows innervation of these 1–2 glomeruli, we analyzed all glomeruli only in the single brain in , and additionally analyzed 8 more antennal lobes in 4 brains for the presence or absence of labeling in these two glomeruli. We analyzed both left and right antennal lobes from 4 brains and found that in 3 of the 4 brains there was a second glomerulus in one or both antennal lobes (Figure S1). The presence of the second glomerulus was not specific within a single animal as we found all variations of presence and absence of this glomerulus across both antennal lobes in these 4 animals. In some Gr3-QF2>QUAS-mCD8:GFP animals, we detected a small number of processes that extended beyond the antennal lobe and into the higher brain, although the exact termination site varied. We never saw CO2-evoked activity in the variable second glomerulus or these projections outside the antennal lobe. Images in Figure S1 were taken as described above with the following changes: Secondary antibodies used were anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11005) and anti-Rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Life Technologies A-11034). Images were taken using a Zeiss Inverted LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.4 Oil DIC objective. Images were taken at 1024 x 1024 in XY to generate images with a final voxel size of 0.1384 × 0.1384 × 0.5 μm3. Images were scored as containing GFP in one or two glomeruli.\n\nAdditional technical notes on expression and projection patterns of Split-QF2 strains\n\nAll antennal lobe immunofluorescence in , , and S4 was carried out as described above with slight modifications to utilize the 15xQUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s effector line. The same primary antibodies were used because of the structural similarity between GCaMP6s and GFP. Intrinsic dTomato was detected without antibody amplification, as it retained fluorescence after fixation and staining. Brp (Cy5), dTomato, and GCaMP6s (Alexa Fluor 488) were imaged as three separate confocal channels as described above. Glomeruli labeled by dTomato completely overlapped with those labeled by GCaMP6s immunofluorescence, so both channels were used during the quantification of positive and negative glomeruli. dTomato labeling was used to generate sample images. There was no staining in the antennal lobes of the individual split effector lines crossed to 15xQUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s (n = 3 per genotype) ( and S4).\n\nAntennal lobe anterograde dye fill\n\nFor images in Figure S1, mosquitoes were anesthetized on wet ice until immobile and then transferred to a cold dissection dish. A single antenna or maxillary palp was loaded with Texas red conjugated dextran (Molecular Probes D3328) diluted 10 mg in 100 μL external saline (103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM 2-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES), 1.5 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.3, osmolality adjusted to 275 mOsm/kg). To load the dye a small drop (approximately 0.5–1 mL) of dye was placed onto the surface of the dish and the animal was moved such that the intended cut-site on a single antenna or maxillary palp was placed in the drop of dye. The antenna or maxillary palp was then removed with sharp forceps and a fine scalpel (F.S.T 10315-12) while it was submerged in the dye. Care was taken to remove the maxillary palp proximal to the fourth segment, to include all the capitate-peg sensilla, and to remove the antenna near the base but to leave the antennal pedicel completely intact. The animal remained immobile on ice with the antenna or maxillary palp submerged and the dye was loaded for 2–5 min. After this time the animal was placed in a small soup cup with access to 10% sucrose and returned to standard rearing conditions overnight to give the dye time to diffuse throughout the neurons and fill the length of the axon. The next morning dissection of adult brains and immunofluorescence was carried out as described above.\n\nAntennal lobe 3D reconstructions\n\nIn an attempt to develop a map of the Ae. aegypti antennal lobe, 3 brains from the +/+LVP strain were immunolabeled with Brp to identify the boundaries between antennal lobe glomeruli. The left antennal lobe in each brain was independently reconstructed from confocal sections taken with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40NA oil immersion objective, at 1024× 1024 pixel resolution in X and Y with 0.5 μm Z-steps for a final voxel size of either 0.1318 × 0.1318 × 0.5 μm3 using the software Imaris (Bitplane). Although the area previously termed Johnston’s organ center was considered a single glomerulus in a previous study (Ignell et al., 2005), we noted anatomical boundaries in this region, suggesting that it contains multiple glomeruli. This observation is consistent with recently published work (Shankar and McMeniman, 2020) and this area was segmented by an individual researcher to generate the final reconstructions. Two of these are shown in Figure S1. Each glomerulus was manually segmented into an individual surface using Surpass View. We were consistently able to identify the three glomeruli innervated by the maxillary palp, previously termed MD1, MD2 and MD3 (Ignell et al., 2005) which we refer to in this study as Glomerulus 1, Glomerulus 2, and Glomerulus 3 ( and ). The overall structure of the antennal lobe varied considerably from animal to animal and although we were able to identify certain regions and certain landmark glomeruli including those that are targeted by the maxillary palp, we were unable to assign an unambiguous identity to every glomerulus, as is possible in D. melanogaster (Couto et al., 2005; Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005). This variability makes it essentially impossible to identify a given glomerulus between animals and we therefore have decided to avoid referring to glomeruli by previous naming schemes, including MD1, MD2, MD3. An authoritative atlas of the Ae. aegypti antennal lobe awaits genetic reagents that label subpopulations of sensory neurons that will permit the field to refer to glomeruli by their molecular identity.\n\nAntennal whole mount immunofluorescence\n\nWhole-mount immunofluorescence of adult antennae was performed as described (Riabinina et al., 2016) with modifications. 7-11-day-old Liverpool mosquitoes were immobilized on ice, decapitated and heads and placed in 1 mL ZnFA fixative solution (0.25% ZnCl2, 2% paraformaldehyde, 135 mM NaCl, 1.2% sucrose and 0.03% Triton X-100) for 20–24 h at room temperature in the dark. Next, the heads were washed three times for 30 min each with HBS buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 25 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% Triton X-100). Antennae were carefully removed in HBS on ice and placed in 400 μL HBS in 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. After a brief wash in HBS, the tissue was incubated in 400 μL 80% methanol/20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution for 1 h at room temperature, washed for 5 min in 400 μL 0.1 M Tris pH 7.4, 0.03% Triton X-100 solution and incubated in 400 μL blocking solution (PBS, 5% normal goat serum (Jackson 005-000-121), 1% DMSO and 0.3% Triton X-100) for at least 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Next, the tissue was placed in a 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes containing 400 μL blocking solution with primary antibodies [rabbit anti-Orco EC2 (Larsson et al., 2004), 1:50, Vosshall lab; chicken anti-GFP,1:200, Aves GFP-1020] and submerged and held in a water bath sonicator (Branson m1800) for 30 s at the high setting. Next, the tubes were placed on a rotator for 2 days at 4°C in the dark, after which the sonication procedure was repeated. The tubes were placed on a rotator for 2 additional days (for a total of 4 days) at 4°C in the dark. Next, the tissue was washed 5 × 30 min each at room temperature in PBS, 1% DMSO and 0.3% Triton X-100. Secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 Plus, 1:200, Thermo Fisher A-32732, anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488, 1:200, Thermo Fisher A-11039) and nuclear dye (TO-PRO-3 Iodide, 1:400, Thermo Fisher T3605) were added to the blocking solution, and tubes were sonicated as described above and incubated for 4 days at 4°C in the dark with the sonication repeated after 2 days of incubation. The tissue was then washed 5 × 30 min at room temperature in PBS, 1% DMSO and 0.3% Triton X-100, rinsed in PBS and mounted in Slow Fade Diamond for confocal imaging.\n\nAntennal whole-mount immunofluorescence with Ir25a antibody\n\nThis protocol was performed as previously described (Basrur et al., 2020) with modifications. Six-to 11-day-old female mosquitoes were anesthetized on wet ice, decapitated, and placed in 1.5 mL 5 U/mL chitinase (Sigma C6137) and 100 U/mL chymotrypsin (Sigma CHY5S) in 119 mM NaCl, 48 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM HEPES, 1% DMSO buffer on ice. Heads were incubated on a ThermoMixer (Eppendorf 5,382,000,023) at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by 55 min in a rotating hybridization oven at 37 °C. Heads were then rinsed once and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 1X Ca+2, Mg+2 free PBS, and 0.03% Triton X-100 for 24 h at 4 °C on a rotator. All subsequent 4 °C steps used a nutator, and room temperature steps used a rotator. Heads were washed for 30 min at room temperature at least three times in 1X PBS with 0.03% Triton X-100 (0.03% PBT). Antennae were then dissected into 0.5-mL microfuge tubes and dehydrated in 80% methanol/20% DMSO for 1 h at room temperature. Antennae were washed in 0.03% PBT for 30 min at room temperature, and blocked/permeabilized in 1X PBS, 1% DMSO (Sigma 472,301), 5% normal goat serum, 4% Triton X-100 for 24 h at 4 °C. Antennae were washed for 30 min at least five times with 0.03% PBT, 1% DMSO, 5% normal goat serum at 4 °C, and then moved to primary antibody in 1X PBS, 1% DMSO, 5% normal goat serum, 0.03% Triton X-100 for 72 h at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-Apocrypta bakeri Orco monoclonal antibody #15B2 (1:50 dilution, gift of Joel Butterwick and Vanessa Ruta), and rabbit anti-Ir25a (1:50 dilution). Orco monoclonal antibody and Ir25a polyclonal antibody specificities were verified in Ae. aegypti by staining orco mutant and Ir25a mutant antennae, respectively ( - ). Antennae were washed for 30 min at least five times with 0.03% PBT, 1% DMSO at room temperature, and then washed overnight in the same solution. Antennae were then moved to secondary antibody (1:200) in 1X PBS, 1% DMSO, 5% normal goat serum, 0.03% Triton X-100 for 72 h at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo A-11001) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 Plus (Thermo A32732). Antennae were washed for 30 min at least five times with 0.03% PBT, 1% DMSO at room temperature, and then washed overnight in the same solution. Antennae were rinsed in 1X PBS, rinsed three times in Slowfade Diamond (Thermo {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"S36972\",\"term_id\":\"480499\"}}S36972), and mounted in Slowfade Diamond.\n\nWhole mount antennal and maxillary palp RNA in situ hybridization\n\nRNA was detected in whole mount antenna and maxillary palp using the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) technique as previously described (Choi et al., 2018) with modifications. Probes, amplifiers, Probe Hybridization Buffer, Amplification Buffer, and Probe Wash Buffer were purchased from Molecular Instruments. Full list of probe lot numbers can be found in Data S1. 5-8 day-old Liverpool mosquitoes were anesthetized on wet ice, manually decapitated with forceps, and heads with antennae and the proboscis were digested in a chitinase-chymotrypsin solution (119 mM NaCl, 48 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM HEPES, 5 U/mL chitinase (Sigma-Aldrich C6137-50UN), 100 U/mL alpha-chymotrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich CHY5S-10VL), 2% DMSO) (Manning and Doe, 2017) at 37°C for 30 min (antennae) or 1 h (maxillary palps) in a Fisher Isotemp oven and subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100 on a rotator at 4°C overnight. Heads were washed 4 times on ice for 10 min each in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20. Antennae or maxillary palps were dissected in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 on ice and dehydrated with a graded series of methanol/0.1% PBS-Tween: 25% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, 50% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, 75% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, and two washes of 100% methanol for 10 min on ice. Tissues were incubated overnight in 100% methanol at −20°C and were subsequently rehydrated with a series of graded methanol/0.1% PBS-Tween-20: 75% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, 50% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, 25% methanol in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min on ice, and two washes of 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min each on ice. Tissue was digested in 20 μg/mL Proteinase K (Thermo Fisher AM2548) in 0.1% PBS-Tween for 30 min at room temperature and washed twice with 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 10 min each at room temperature. Tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 for 20 min at room temperature and washed 3 times for 10 min each in 0.1% PBS-Tween-20 at room temperature. Tissue was incubated in Probe Hybridization Buffer at room temperature for 5 min and then in 37°C pre-warmed Probe Hybridization Buffer rotating in a hybridization oven for 30 min 8 pmol of each probe set was prepared in 37°C pre-warmed Probe Hybridization Buffer and tissue was incubated in probe solution at 37°C in a hybridization oven for 2 nights. Tissues were washed in 37°C pre-warmed Probe Wash Buffer 5 times for 10 min each at 37°C. Tissues were washed twice in 5X SSC 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 10 min each. Tissues were pre-amplified in room temperature Amplification Buffer for 10 min 18 pmol hairpins were separately prepared by heating 6 μL of 3 μM stock of hairpins H1 and H2 at 95°C for 90 s on an Eppendorf Mastercycler and allowing to cool to room temperature in a dark drawer for 30 min. Hairpins were resuspended in 100 μL amplification buffer and tissues were incubated in this hairpin solution in the dark on a rotator at room temperature overnight. Tissues were washed 5 times for 10 min each in 5X SSC 0.1% Tween 20 and mounted in SlowFade Diamond (Thermo Fisher {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"S36972\",\"term_id\":\"480499\"}}S36972) on glass slides with coverslips for confocal imaging.\n\nWhole mount antennal, maxillary palp, and proboscis dTomato visualization\n\n7-14-day-old Ir25a-QF2, Orco-QF2, Ir25a-QF2AD, Orco-QFDBD, and Ir25a-QF2AD Orco-QFDBD>15XQUAS-dTomato-T2A-GCaMP6s mosquitoes were anesthetized on wet ice, manually decapitated with forceps and heads with antennae, proboscises, and maxillary palps were immediately fixed in 1 mL 4% paraformaldehyde, 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100, on a rotator in the dark at 4°C overnight. Heads were washed 3 × 30 min each in 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100 at room temperature, then antennae, proboscises, and maxillary palps were carefully removed and placed in 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100. Next, antennae, proboscises, and maxillary palps were placed in a solution of 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100, 1% DMSO, and a 1:400 dilution of TO-PRO-3 (Thermo Fisher T3605) for 24 h at 4°C in the dark. Antennae, proboscises, and maxillary palps were then washed 5 × 30 min each in 1X PBS, 0.03% Triton X-100 at room temperature in the dark, washed once with 1X PBS, transferred to a well of SlowFade diamond to remove excess PBS, and mounted in SlowFade Diamond for confocal imaging.\n\nAntennal and maxillary palp confocal imaging and cell quantification\n\nImages of peripheral tissues were acquired with a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 Inverted LSM 880 NLO laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) with a 25x/0.8 NA or 63x/1.4 NA immersion-corrected objective at a resolution of 3096× 3096 pixels or 2048 × 2048 pixels. When comparing dTomato fluorescence across genotypes, image acquisition parameters were kept consistent. When necessary, tiled images were stitched with 20% overlap. We note that all confocal imaging was conducted in a manner that would maximize our ability to visualize the presence or absence of each fluorophore and was not intended as a quantitative measure of fluorescence intensity. Confocal images were processed in ImageJ (NIH). Because the antenna is a cylindrical structure, when whole antennal segments are mounted on a slide and imaged on a confocal microscope, signal can be easily detected from the region closest to the coverslip and confocal objective, but signal is weaker when imaging the side further from the coverslip and objective. For the purposes of consistent quantification, we only quantified cell numbers from the region closest to the coverslip (red rectangle in Figure S3E). For quantifying expression in the maxillary palp, only the dorso-lateral region of the fourth maxillary palp segment was analyzed. (yellow rectangle in Figure S3F). Quantification of co-expression in antennae and maxillary palps was done in ImageJ (NIH) using the Cell Counter plugin. Cells in each channel were manually marked independently of the signal in the other channels. After cells in each channel are marked, and markers were then merged. Cells that were labeled with multiple markers (co-expressing cells) were then marked with a third marker (Figures S3G-S3L). Cell counts were then imported into Microsoft Excel and R for analysis.\n\nAntenna dissection for snRNA-seq\n\nApproximately 100–250 female +/+LVP mosquitoes aged 6–8 days post-eclosion were anesthetized on wet ice for 10 min. Mosquitoes were then placed in a 70 μm cell strainer (Falcon 08-771-1). The cell strainer containing the anesthetized mosquitoes was placed in a 60 mm Petri dish (Corning 430,166), and ice-cold molecular-grade 100% ethanol was gently poured into the cell strainer for 5 s. The cell strainer with ethanol-rinsed mosquitoes was then transferred to a new 60 mm Petri dish and ice-cold Schneider’s Medium (Gibco 21,720,024) was poured into the cell strainer to rinse. Approximately 20 mL of ice-cold Schneider’s medium was poured into a 100 mm Petri dish (Corning 430,293) on wet ice or reusable ice pack (Cooler Shock, mid-size freeze pack). Schneider’s Medium-rinsed mosquitoes were transferred from the cell strainer to the 100 mm Petri dish. A new 70 μm cell strainer (pluriSelect 43–10070) with walls trimmed with a sterile razor blade to a height of 0.5–0.75 cm was placed into the same 100 mm Petri dish. The antennae were then removed using forceps and placed into the cell strainer. Antennae were rinsed approximately every 10 min by agitating the cell strainer and pipetting fresh ice-cold Schneider’s Medium into the cell strainer. Dissection of each sample was limited to 90 min to ensure nuclei integrity, and when 90 min elapsed or all mosquitoes dissected, antennae were transferred into a DNA LoBind 1.5 mL tube (Eppendorf 022,431,021) pre-wet with Schneider’s Medium. The cell strainer with antennae was inverted with forceps into the tube and approximately 300 μL ice-cold Schneider’s Medium was pipetted into the cell strainer to release antennae into the Eppendorf tube. The sample was then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C until ready for nuclei extraction. A total of approximately 750-1300 antennae were collected for each snRNA-seq batch, collected across four 90-min dissection sessions. Two batches of female antennae were processed for the snRNA-seq data presented in this paper. All tissue was collected at Rockefeller University. Batch 1 was processed at Rockefeller University (including nuclei extraction, 10X Genomics run, library preparation and sequencing), and Batch 2 was shipped on dry ice and processed at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nBatch 1 (Rockefeller antenna sample) nuclei extraction\n\nNuclei extraction of mosquito antennae was performed as previously described (McLaughlin et al., 2021) with modifications. Dissected antennae were thawed on wet ice, and all subsequent steps were performed on wet ice unless otherwise noted. Once samples were thawed, antennae were centrifuged in a benchtop microcentrifuge for 5–10 s, Schneider’s Medium was removed and replaced with 100 μL of homogenization buffer (McLaughlin et al., 2021). Antennae from multiple dissection sessions were combined into a single DNA LoBind 1.5 mL tube using a low-retention repel polymer technology 200 μL filter tip (TipOne 11,821,830), with ~1 mm from the distal end trimmed using a sterilized and RNAse away-treated (Thermo Fisher 7000TS1) razor blade. With no more than 500 μL buffer present in the tube, tissue was ground for 30–60 s with a pellet pestle motor (Kimble 749,540-0000) and RNase-free pestle (Kimble 749,521-0590). The volume of buffer was brought up to 1000 μL with additional ice-cold homogenization buffer. Next, a 1 mL Dounce tissue grinder and pestle set (Wheaton 357,538) that had been autoclaved at 121 °C for 4 h the previous day was pre-wetted with homogenization buffer. Using a low-retention (repel polymer technology) 1000 μL filter tip (TipOne 11,821,830), samples were transferred into the Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were released by homogenizing with 20 strokes of the loose pestle, and 40 strokes of the tight pestle. Next, a low-retention 1000 μL tip was used to remove ~500 μL of the suspension. The suspension was filtered through a 40 μm Flowmi filter (Bel-Art H13680-0040) into a pre-wet 20 μm PluriStrainer (pluriSelect 43-10020-40) in a 1.5 mL LoBind Eppendorf tube. The second ~500 μL antennae nuclei suspension was then filtered the same way into the same Eppendorf tube. The suspension was then divided equally into two 1.5 mL LoBind Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 500xG at 4°C. The supernatant was gently discarded without disturbing the pellet. Next, pellets were resuspended in 100 μL 1X PBS, 1% BSA, 10 μL/mL RNAse inhibitor (Roche RNAINH-RO) by pipetting 5 times with a low-retention 1000 μL tip, combined and pipetted to re-suspend and break up cell clumps 15 more times. The suspension was then filtered three times by running it through a Flowmi filter into a 10 μm strainer (pluriSelect 43-10010-40) in a 1.5 mL LoBind Eppendorf tube. To ensure nuclei were not clumping, 10 μL of the suspension was removed and stained with acridine orange and propidium iodide (Logos Biosystems, LGBD10012). The concentration of nuclei was determined by counting cells on a Luna FX7 automated cell counter (Logos Biosystems L70001).\n\nBatch 1 (Rockefeller antenna sample): 10X Genomics, library preparation and sequencing\n\nSingle cell 3’ expression Libraries were generated using Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead kit Version 3.1 (10X Genomics PN1000269). Standard protocols from 10X Genomics were followed to generate the dual index libraries. Due to the small nucleus size (4–5 μm in diameter), 17 cycles were used for cDNA amplification and 13 cycles for index PCR. The quality and quantity of the libraries were assessed on Agilent TapeStation, the library was sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using 100 cycle SP flowcell and 800 million paired reads were generated (read 1 = 28 bp, read 2 = 90 bp).\n\nBatch 2 (Baylor antenna sample): Nuclei extraction\n\nNuclei extraction from mosquito antennae were performed as previously described (Li et al., 2022) with modifications. Fresh homogenization buffer (Li et al., 2022) was prepared and kept on ice. Samples were thawed from −80°C on wet ice, spun down in 100 μL Schneider’s Medium using a bench top spinner, and as much medium as possible was discarded. Antennae from multiple dissection sessions were combined into a single 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube using a low-retention 200 μL filter tip (Rainin 30,389,240) with ~1 mm from the distal end trimmed using a sterilized and RNAse away-treated (Thermo Fisher 7000TS1) razor blade (VWR 10835-965) and 100 μL Homogenization buffer was added. The sample was ground with a pestle motor (Kimble 6HAZ6) for 30–60 s on wet ice. 900 μL homogenization buffer was added, and 1000 μL homogenized sample was transferred into the 1 mL Dounce tissue grinder set (Wheaton 357,538) that had been autoclaved at 200°C for >5 h or overnight a day in advance. Nuclei were released by 20 strokes with a loose Dounce pestle and 40 with a tight Dounce pestle on ice, taking care to avoid bubbles. 1000 μL of the sample was filtered through a 5 mL cell strainer (35 μm), and then filtered using 40 μm Flowmi (BelArt, H13680-0040) into 1.5 mL EP tube, centrifuged for 10 min at 1000xG at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded with care not to disturb the pellet. The nuclei were resuspended using 500 μL 1xPBS/0.5%BSA with RNase inhibitor (9.5 mL 1x PBS, 0.5 mL 10% BSA, 50 μL RNasin Plusby) pipetting at least 20 times to completely re-suspend the nuclei. Sample were filtered using 40 μm Flowmi into a new 5 mL fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) tube and kept on wet ice.\n\nBatch 2 (Baylor antenna sample): FACS sorting, 10X genomics, library preparation, sequencing\n\nFACS sorting was done using a BD FACSAria III Cell Sorter to collect nuclei (for FACS plots and gates, see Data S1). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst-33342 (1:1000; >5 min). Hoechst-positive nuclei were collected into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with 500 μL 1x PBS with 0.5% BSA as the receiving buffer (RNase inhibitor added). For each 10X Genomics run, all nuclei were collected. Approximately 15,000 nuclei were collected from the antennae. Nuclei were spun for 10 min at 1000XG at 4°C, and then resuspended using 43.2 μL 1x PBS with 0.5% BSA (RNase inhibitor added). Since the yield of nuclei was low, all nuclei were loaded onto a 10X Genomics controller. 10X Genomics sequencing libraries were prepared following the standard protocol from 10X Genomics 3′ v3.1 kit with following settings. All PCR reactions were performed using the Biorad C1000 Touch Thermal cycler with 96-Deep Well Reaction Module. 13 cycles were used for cDNA amplification and 16 cycles were used for sample index PCR. As per 10X Genomics protocol, 1:10 dilutions of amplified cDNA and final libraries were evaluated on Agilent 4200 TapeStation. Single-cell RNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer with minimum sequencing depth of 50,000 reads/cell using the read lengths 28bp Read1, 8bp i7 Index, 91bp Read2.\n\nMaxillary palp dissection, nuclei extraction, FACS sorting, 10X genomics, library preparation, and sequencing\n\nMaxillary palp dissections were conducted as described for the antenna. A total of 2,448 total maxillary palps were collected across fifteen 90-min dissection sessions at Rockefeller. These samples were shipped on dry ice and processed at Baylor College of Medicine. Nuclei extraction and FACS was performed at Baylor as described for the Batch 2 antenna sample with approximately 7,000 nuclei collected (for FACS plots and gates, see Data S1). 10X Genomics, library preparation, and sequencing was done as described above for the Batch 2 antenna sample.\n\nsnRNA-seq analysis: cell identification, ambient RNA removal, batch combination, and neuron classification\n\nAlignment and initial cell identification:\n\nThe Ae. aegypti genome (AaegL5.0, GCF_002204515.2 on NCBI) was indexed using Cell Ranger (version 6.0.2). FASTQ files generated from 10X Genomics 3′ gene expression libraries were mapped to the indexed genomes and gene counts in each cell were calculated by CellRanger (version 6.0.2). Intron signals were included by specifying the –include-introns parameter for cellranger count. From this point onward, data were further processed and analyzed using R and RStudio (R Core Team, 2021; R Studio Team, 2020).\n\nAmbient RNA removal:\n\nDecontX from the Celda package (antenna: version 1.10.1, maxillary palp: 1.8.1) (Wang et al., 2021) was chosen for removing the ambient RNAs produced during nuclei preparation. Raw and filtered reads generated from Cell Ranger were compared by DecontX to obtain decontaminated reads (Figures S5A and S7A). The decontaminated reads were rounded by the R base:round function and the decontaminated matrices were generated by the DropletUtils package (version 1.14.2) (Griffiths et al., 2018).\n\nDecontaminated expression matrices were loaded into the Seurat package (antenna: version 4.1.0, maxillary palp: 4.0.5) (Satija et al., 2015), filtering for cells with a minimum total features of 200 and genes expressed in a minimum of 3 cells for the maxillary palp, and 12 cells for the antenna (determined by evaluation of the distribution of cells per feature). Multiplets were identified by DoubletFinder (version 2.0.3) (McGinnis et al., 2019). The pK with maximum AUC was chosen for DoubletFinder. The multiplet numbers were estimated by the multiplet rate table on the 10X Genomics website. DoubletFinder-defined multiplets were excluded for the downstream analysis.\n\nCell filtering (antenna):\n\nCells expressing a total number of features within the lowest 3% of each batch were excluded. As a further precaution against the inclusion of potential multiplets, we only included cells with the number of detective genes less than the median of gene number plus 3 median absolute deviations (MADs) for the analysis. Cells with more than 5% of mitochondrial transcripts were excluded (Figures S5C-S5E).\n\nCell filtering (maxillary palp):\n\nCells with extreme gene numbers or abundant mitochondria transcripts were removed using Seurat (Satija et al., 2015). We excluded nuclei expressing fewer than 400 or greater than 4000 genes. Nuclei with more than 5% of mitochondrial transcripts were excluded. Genes expressed in fewer than 3 nuclei were removed (Figures S7B-S7D).\n\nNormalization and dimensionality reduction (maxillary palp):\n\nExpression matrices of remaining nuclei were loaded into the Seurat package and processed by Seurat (version 4.0.5) (Satija et al., 2015). The analyses applied default parameters of Seurat unless specified. Expression matrices were normalized using NormalizeData() function. Highly variable genes were selected using FindVariable-Features(). The data were scaled using the ScaleData() function with the vars.to.regress = c(’nCount_RNA′) parameter to regress out the effect of the total counts. The scaled data were dimensionally reduced using the RunPCA() function. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was used for visualizing the non-linear dimensionality reduction with 1–50 dimensions. Nuclei were clustered using the Louvain algorithm ( ).\n\nNormalization, dimensionality reduction, merging and batch correction (antenna):\n\nWith little previous explicit research on the detailed composition of the mosquito antenna and few known gene markers for mosquito cell types, analysis pipeline decisions on the remaining cells were weighed holistically by the following criteria: (1) interrogating the data for possible technical artifacts, and (2) how well putative chemosensory cell types separated, here defined as a group of cells expressing the same chemosensory receptor gene or combination of receptor genes. Future research into cell populations in the antenna may uncover information on which to further “ground-truth” and refine this analysis pipeline.\n\nInitially, we applied either LogNormalize() and SCTransform() to normalization our data for analysis. Log-normalized data appeared hampered significantly with low UMI gene counts frequently resulting in high normalization scores (data not shown). Additionally, our batches were sequenced at different depths, a technical factor which sctransform is designed to address (Hafemeister and Satija, 2019). Therefore, we applied sctransform for normalization, scaling, and identification of highly variable genes for downstream analysis. Sctransfrom-normalized data were dimensionally reduced using the RunPCA() function. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was used for visualizing the non-linear dimensionality reduction with 1–50 dimensions. Nuclei were clustered using the Louvain algorithm (Figures S5G and ).\n\nWe performed two independent snRNA-seq experiments on the antenna to collect a greater number of nuclei for our analysis. After filtering, the two batches were merged and renormalized. To correct principal component analysis (PCA) embeddings and remove the batch effects, we performed either harmony (version 0.1.0) (Korsunsky et al., 2019) or canonical correlation analysis (CCA) implemented in Seurat (Satija et al., 2015), also comparing the resulting clusters to the uncorrected data population (data not shown). The two batches of antenna snRNA-seq data were combined using merge(). For CCA-based integration, batches were split using and SplitObject() functions in Seurat. Split objects were normalized and selected for highly variable genes independently. 3,000 features used for the integration were selected by the SelectIntegrationFeatures() and PrepSCTIntegration() functions in Seurat. Two batches were then integrated using the FindIntegrationAnchors() and IntegrateData() functions. For harmony-based correction, batch-corrected dimensions were obtained using the RunHarmony() function. Batch-corrected samples using both methods were then analyzed following the procedures described in the previous section from scaling to clustering to identify cluster-specific genes. Harmony was selected as the batch-correction the final dataset and the generation of the final figures in this paper. Any subsequent clustering was done on Harmony-corrected PCs.\n\nNeuron cluster identification:\n\nCells were dimensionally reduced as described above and with a clustering resolution of 1. To classify cells as neurons, we first identified genes that are orthologous to the neuronal marker genes used in D. melanogaster using BLASTP. Four mosquito genes, LOC5565901, LOC5570204, LOC5564848, and LOC5570381, are orthologous to the D. melanogaster neural markers, synaptotagmin 1 (syt1), embryonic lethal abnormal vision (elav), cadherin-N (CadN), and bruchpilot (brp), respectively. We saw that expression largely overlapped with the OSN co-receptors Orco, Ir25a, Ir76b, and Ir8a, consistent with the idea that these are neuronal markers. We defined neural clusters based on the expression of syt1, elav, CadN, and brp, and clusters expressing at least three neuronal markers in more than 50% of cells in the corresponding cluster were defined as neural clusters (Figures S5I, S7F, and S7G). The remaining cells were reprocessed using RunUMAP(), RunTSNE(), FindNeighbors() and FindClusters().\n\nNeuron cluster identification (antenna):\n\nBefore dimensionality reduction of the final neuron population, clusters 3 and 45 were also removed because in some iterations of the pipeline the central neural cluster they did not meet our criteria for classification as “neurons”. In addition to low expression of neural markers and variable quality control metrics, it was ambiguous whether these were legitimate neural clusters (Figures S5G-S5I). For more data on clusters 3 and 45, see Data S1.\n\nCluster resolution testing (antenna neurons):\n\nFindClusters() was tested using the following resolutions: 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 1.7, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.7, 4.0. Between each resolution, cells were assessed for chemoreceptor expression changes in cluster assignment. Cluster separations were evaluated for “validity” using heatmaps for chemosensory receptor gene expression – essentially whether a cluster separation identified populations with distinct expression of chemosensory genes. For instance, cluster 3 at resolution 3.7 split at resolution 4.0 into cluster 40, primarily Or44-expressing cells and cluster 6, primarily non-Or44 expressing cells in cluster 6. Some mutually exclusive receptors could not be separated by high clustering resolution, such as asterisk-marked clusters in , in addition to Figures S5L and S5M), indicating that sometimes cluster categorization was driven by general transcriptome characteristics and not solely by chemoreceptor expression. Bulked over the neuron population, 185 chemoreceptor genes had SCT-corrected UMI counts of 2 or above (Figure S5F; full plot in Data S1). 121 were identified as highly variable genes by sctransform when normalized after batch merging. If the remaining 64 chemoreceptors were appended to the highly variable gene list, and principal components re-run, it did not a noticeable difference for cluster identities (data not shown).\n\nExpression criteria (antenna):\n\nNeural clusters were then examined for ligand-selective receptor and co-receptor expression. For ligand-selective receptors, we define “expression” of a gene within a cell as being expressed above a sctransform normalized expression value of 1 (Figure S6A). Because sctransform performs via adjusting UMI values, this also corresponds to an adjusted UMI value of 2 or above. We define “co-expression” as genes that meet this criteria in 10 or more cells within our identified neuron population. The chord plots compare the sctransform-adjusted UMIs ( ) and non-adjusted UMIs (Figure S5J), with the same but fewer chords appearing in the sctransform chord plot.\n\nCo-receptors Ir25a, Ir76b, Ir8a have similar overall expression levels in the tissue with other highly expressed ligand-selective receptors, so we applied the same criteria for these co-receptors (Figures S5F and S6). Orco, conversely, is expressed overall at an order of magnitude higher than other chemoreceptors, likely why it leads to the contamination of other cells, including non-neurons (Figure S5A). Therefore, for Orco we raised the definition of “expression” to a normalized expression value of 2, corresponding to an sctransform-adjusted UMI value of 6.\n\nDetermination of minimum number of chemosensory cell types in antenna:\n\nWithin our chemosensory neuron population, we define “cell type” as a population of neurons expressing the same chemosensory receptors. By examining cluster chemoreceptor expression, we determined that there are at least 35 chemosensory cell types in the antenna. Clusters with high levels of LOC5575210, a gene orthologous to D. melanogaster gene no mechanoreceptor potential C (nompC), were excluded. High cluster resolution was needed to separate some clusters containing mutually exclusive chemoreceptor expression (see cluster resolution testing above). However sometimes cells with the same chemoreceptor expression were also separated by clustering, resulting in “duplicate” clusters, although there may be differences in expression of these clusters for expression of other genes (clusters 4 and 22, clusters 13 and 18, clusters 12 and 41, cluster 9 and 5). Cluster 26 has no apparent ligand-specific chemoreceptor expression ( and S6A). We arrived at the total number of cell types according to this scheme: (42 total clusters) - (2 clusters with nompC) - (1 cluster with no apparent ligand-specific chemoreceptor expression) - (4 “duplicate” clusters) = 35 chemosensory cell types. Figure S6A also illustrates these chemoreceptor expression-defined cell types. 35 is a conservative estimate of chemoreceptor cell types since there are instances of multiple populations of chemosensory cell types co-clusters such as the ligand-specific IR cells in cluster 0 (Figures S5L and S5M). In addition, transcript “drop outs” make it difficult to determine if cells within a cluster that have low or sparse expression of a given gene mean that there are additional heterogeneity along distinct subtypes of these lower expressed chemoreceptors, or this is a result of sampling limitation of snRNAseq. Based on this, we believe that there are more than 35 cell types.\n\nAntenna cell marker heatmap (on total cell population):\n\nThe heatmap in was generated using normalized expression values and the ComplexHeatmap package in R (R Core Team, 2021). Epithelia-, glia-, and neuron-enriched genes in the D. melanogaster antenna were considered as references of the corresponding marker genes in Ae. aegypti. Mosquito genes LOC5564305, LOC5570152, LOC5576812 were used as markers for epithelia cell clusters and are orthologolous respectively to D. melanogaster genes grainy head (grh), farkas (far), pyrokinin 1 receptor (pk1-r). Mosquito genes LOC110678282, LOC110678282, LOC110676862, were used as markers for putative glial cell clusters and are orthologus respectively for reversed polarity (repo, LOC110678282), viking (vkg, LOC110678282), aristaless (al, LOC110676862), were used for glial cell clusters. Neural cell markers syt1, elav, CadN, and brp, were used as listed above with the addition of LOC5567355, an orthologue to paralytic (para).\n\nAntenna tSNE plot:\n\nTo generate tSNE plots in Figure S5G of all antennal nuclei and of antennal neurons, expression matrices were first normalized, selected for highly variable genes, and scaled using sctransform. Scaled data were applied to the RunTSNE() with 1–50 dimensions. All antenna nuclei and antennal neurons were clustered using the Louvain algorithm with resolutions 1 and 4 respectively.\n\nAntenna dot plot:\n\nThe dot plot of cluster-enriched chemosensory receptors in was based on the DotPlot() function in Seurat (Satija et al., 2015) and customized using the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016). The scaled mean normalized expression and expression percentage of each chemosensory receptor was calculated by the DotPlot() function. The hclust() function was used to cluster genes.\n\nAsterisk-marked clusters:\n\nCo-clustering of different cell types within a cluster was marked to indicate that apparent co-expression of chemoreceptors within a cluster is not always indicative of co-expression within individual cells. Inversely a cluster with no apparent chemoreceptor expression may have some cells that express chemoreceptors at low levels. We determined that when cells that exhibited co-clustering but expressed different chemoreceptor cell types were mutually exclusive cell types according to cells’ highest expressed receptor within the cluster. For example see clusters 0 and 3 (Figures S5L and S5M). Co-clustering for asterisks-marked clusters can also be observed by looking at clusters in Figure S7A. For cluster heatmaps, see Data S1.\n\nTriangle-marked clusters:\n\nLower or more sparsely expressed chemoreceptors that are co-expressed on a cluster-level or when we looked at the scaled average expression but do not explicitly pass our stated threshold for co-expression are marked with a triangle. These also do not appear in the chord plot in , which depicts only the co-expression relationships that clear our threshold. We used scaled average expression for the dot plot as a means of investigating expression of these chemoreceptors. For instance, Ir41m does not meet our co-expression with Ir41L. Ir41m′s specific expression in cluster 38 appears high on a scaled (Z score) of average expression because Ir41m has specific expression to cluster 38 (see and S6A). These genes provide important context for other highly expressed genes (e.g., that in cluster 38, Ir93a may not be expressed as a singular ligand-specific chemoreceptor, but co-expressed with other genes, potentially Ir21a). For this reason, we did not omit these genes from the dot plot.\n\nAntenna chord plot:\n\nThe chord plot of co-expressed chemosensory receptor in and S5J was generated using the chorddiag package in R (R Core Team, 2021). A list of 184 receptor genes was generated from the matrix data and co-receptors Orco, Ir25a, Ir76b and Ir8a were excluded. Receptors that express UMI at 2 or above were considered as positively expressed. Each expressed chemosensory receptor was iteratively compared to the expression of the remaining chemosensory receptors in the corresponding nuclei. If more than 10 nuclei expressed two chemosensory receptors simultaneously, these two receptors were considered as co-expressed chemosensory receptors and visualized using the chorddiag package. uses sctransform-adjusted UMI values, and Figure S5J uses UMI values from the RNA assay in the final Seurat object.\n\nAntenna chemoreceptor scatterplot:\n\nThe count scatterplot in Figure S5F was generated by summing the counts across all cells within each batch for each chemosensory receptor. The sum counts were plotted using the geom_point() function of the ggplot2 package in R (R Core Team, 2021; Wickham, 2016).\n\nAntenna chemoreceptor expression heatmaps:\n\nThe heatmaps in , S6A, and S5L-S5P were generating using the DoHeatmap() function on sctransform-normalized expression data. Cells were filtered by either subsetting by cluster identity or for normalized expression of a given gene. Clusters are ordered by co-receptor expression, chemoreceptor genes are ordered by cluster expression. In Figures S5L and S5M, cells are dimensionally reduced and clusters re-assigned at a resolution of 4 to visualize cell gene expression similarities within a cluster. LOC5575210 expression (ortholog of D. melanogaster nompC) is likely to not be expressed in chemosensory cells but expressed in the neural population at a similar level to other highly expressed chemoreceptor genes (Figure S6A; Data S1), thus is included as a non-quantitative demonstration of potential background noise.\n\nAntenna violin plots:\n\nGene expression feature plots were made using the command VlnPlot() on normalized expression values.\n\nMaxillary palp: tSNE, heatmap, chord plot, dot plot, expression feature plot\n\nThe tSNE of maxillary palp nuclei in was generated similarly to the antenna tSNE, with cluster resolution adjusted to 2.5. The heatmap of all maxillary palp nuclei in and was plotted as described for the antenna heatmap. The dot plot of all maxillary palp abundant receptors in Figure S7O was plotted as described for the antenna heatmap. The maxillary palp chord plot in was processed similarly to the antenna one. Maxillary palp gene expression feature plots were made using the command FeaturePlot() on normalized expression values.\n\nMaxillary palp scatterplot:\n\nThe co-expression scatterplot in Figures S7M and S7N was based on the normalization expression from each single nuclei for a pair of chemosensory receptors. The normalization values were plotted using the geom_point() function of the ggplot2 package in R (R Core Team, 2021; Wickham, 2016).\n\nMosquito preparation for single-sensillum recordings\n\nFemale mosquitoes from two wild-type and three mutant strains (+/+ORL, +/+LVP, Ir25aBamHI/BamHI, Gr34/4 and Orco16/16) five to seven days post-emergence, were anesthetized on wet ice for 1–2 min. An individual mosquito was then glued onto a piece of double-sided sticky tape on a microscope slide (76 × 26 mm) and secured by a piece of tape covering the thorax and abdomen. The maxillary palps were immobilized using a short segment of human hair placed over the basal part of the maxillary palps. The sensilla of the maxillary palps were subsequently visualized using an Olympus light microscope (BX51WI; LRI Instrument AB, Lund, Sweden) at 750×. A continuous humidified stream of synthetic air (Strandmöllen AB, Ljungby, Sweden) was passed over the maxillary palp (2 L min−1) via a glass tube (7 mm i.d.), terminating 10 mm from the maxillary palps, to avoid desiccation.\n\nSingle-sensillum recordings from maxillary palp capitate peg sensilla\n\nElectrophysiological recordings from capitate peg sensilla were made and analyzed according to previously described protocols (Ghaninia et al., 2019; Majeed et al., 2016). In brief, two tungsten microelectrodes, electrolytically sharpened in 10% KNO2 solution, were used as reference and recording electrodes. The reference electrode was inserted into the eye and the recording electrode was positioned at the base or shaft of the sensillum using a piezo motorized micromanipulator (Märzhäuser Wetzlar GmbH & Co. KG, Wetzlar Germany) until electrical contact was established. Extracellular signals from the OSNs housed in the capitate peg sensilla were amplified and recorded using a high-impedance probe (universal single ended probe) and a USB-acquisition controller (IDAC-4) (Ockenfels Syntech GmbH, Buchenbach, Germany). Extracellular spikes were differentiated based on amplitude as A, B, and C, according to standard nomenclature (Ghaninia et al., 2019; Majeed et al., 2016), and manually counted using Autospike 3.7 (Ockenfels Syntech GmbH). The response to odorant stimuli were analyzed by subtracting the number of spikes 0.5 s post-stimulus from the number of spikes 0.5 s pre-stimulus, and the outcome was multiplied by two to obtain a spike/sec measurement. In cases where the neuronal response was high enough to result in pinching of the spike train (>150 spikes/sec), the number of spikes post-stimulus were counted for the first 100 ms and then multiplied by 5, as the inter-spike frequency is constant once the neuron is activated maximally. Neurons were classified as responders or non-responders based upon whether their odorant response was above or below a 30 spikes/sec threshold, respectively.\n\nOdorant stimulus delivery for single-sensillum recordings\n\nOdorants used in were selected for the highest purity available (>98%): R-(−)-1-octen-3-ol (PubChem CID: 6992244, Penta Manufacturing 15–18900); acetone (PubChem CID: 180 Sigma A4206); hexyl amine (PubChem CID: 8102, Sigma 219,703); triethyl amine (PubChem CID: 1146, Sigma T0886). All odorants were diluted into a large stock solution that was used throughout each entire experiment to avoid variability in concentrations. Serial decadic dilutions of acetone, hexyl amine, and triethyl amine were made in MilliQ ultrapure water (18 MΩ resistance) and 1-octen-3-ol was diluted in paraffin oil (EMD Millipore #PX0045-3). Aliquots of 10 μL of each compound and dilution was pipetted onto a piece of filter paper (5 × 20 mm) placed inside a Pasteur pipette. Similar volumes of MilliQ ultrapure water and paraffin oil were used as controls. Stimulus cartridges were used within 5 min after loading, and only used once. For dose-response analysis using CO2, gas cylinders containing metered amounts of CO2 (300, 600, 1200, 4800 ppm) and oxygen (20%), balanced by nitrogen (Strandmöllen AB, Ljungby, Sweden) were used as previously described (Ghaninia et al., 2019). Odorants were introduced by passing a 0.5 s air puff through the Pasteur pipette using a stimulus controller (Ockenfels Syntech GmbH) into the airstream passing over the maxillary palps through a hole in the glass tube, 10 cm upstream from the preparation."
