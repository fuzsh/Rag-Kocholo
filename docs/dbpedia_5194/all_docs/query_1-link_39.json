        "text": "Tempcon Group’s subsidiary Claessons transport in Ljungby has changed its name to Tempcon Ljungby. At the same time, they are moving to new premises on Näsvägen 4 in connection with the garage opened by the sister company Tommy Nordbergh åkeri. The name change takes place after a period of change work to clarify a new initiative with a changed organization and a strengthened offer to the market. At the same time, it becomes even clearer that you are part of the Tempcon family.\n\nThe company already has a well-developed distribution network that covers most of Småland and Halland, supplemented by traffic to and from Skåne. To this can then of course be added the sister companies’ line network, which means solving assignments that extend throughout the Nordic region and all the way down to the BeNeLux countries.\n\nThe company will continue to offer the high level of service that it has become known for and the flexible solutions that customers are used to, regardless of whether it is a package, courier or goods.\n\n– As a customer at Tempcon Ljungby, we want customers to focus on what they are good at and we help them with the logistics, says Rickard Granqvist, CEO of Tempcon Ljungby. Handling high-quality and temperature-sensitive goods is our everyday life.\n\n– The company has a history of just over 15 years, so the name change should now be seen as a bit of a fresh start, Granqvist continues. At the same time, we become even clearer in our offer to the market as we tailor the arrangements for our customers and the goal is to continue to maintain a high minimum level in terms of service to them."
