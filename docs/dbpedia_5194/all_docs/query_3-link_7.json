        "text": "Taxonomy\n\nThe multigene analyses resulted in 95 well-supported clades correlating to 243 isolates of Diaporthe ( , ). Fifteen new species are described, nine of which were isolated from medicinal plants (Aspidosperma tomentosum, Maytenus ilicifolia, Schinus terebinthifolius, Spondias mombin) in Brazil (clades 5, 9, 11, 23, 30, 31, 34, 35 and 36). Twenty-eight clades contain ex-type strains of presently known species, or strains accepted as authentic for the species name or which could be designated as epitypes in the present study, and were therefore well-resolved (7, 8, 12, 14, 17, 20–22, 24, 26–28, 40, 42, 43, 45, 48–50, 63, 64, 69, 71, 72, 84 and 91–93). The sexual-asexual relationship was resolved for several taxa, and is reported below. New combinations in Diaporthe are introduced below for several Phomopsis names that represented well-resolved taxa. Several potential epitypes were identified during this study, which are discussed below.\n\nDiaporthe acaciigena Crous, Pascoe & Jacq. Edwards, Persoonia 26: 123. 2011\n\nSpecimen examined. Australia, Victoria, Otway Ranges, Anglesea, S38°23′21.7″ E144°11′12.7″, on leaves of Acacia retinodes, 16 Oct. 2009, P.W. Crous, I.G. Pascoe & J. Edwards (holotype CBS H-20581, ex-type culture CPC 17622 = CBS 129521).\n\nNotes — Clade 43 contains the ex-type culture of D. acaciigena isolated from Acacia retinodes in Australia. This species is morphologically similar to D. amygdali (clade 42) (Crous et al. 2011), and closely related to D. pustulata (clade 44).\n\nDiaporthe acerina (Peck) Sacc., Syll. Fung. (Abellini) 1: 611. 1882\n\nBasionym. Valsa acerina Peck, Ann. Rep. N.Y. State Mus. Nat. Hist. 28: 73. 1876. 1874.\n\nSpecimen examined. Unknown, from Acer saccharum, Sept. 1927, L.E. Wehmeyer (CBS 137.27).\n\nNotes — Clade 39 is represented by D. acerina, isolated from Acer saccharum. This species is genetically similar to D. perjuncta (clade 40). It is known to occur in Europe and North America on dead limbs and trunks of Acer pseudoplatanus, A. saccharinum, A. saccharum, A. spicatum, and Acer sp. (Aceraceae) (Spielman 1985, Farr et al. 1989).\n\nDiaporthe alleghaniensis R.H. Arnold, Canad. J. Bot. 45: 787. 1967\n\nSpecimen examined. Canada, Ontario, on branches of Betula alleghaniensis, June 1972, R.H. Arnold (ex-type culture CBS 495.72 = ATCC 24097 = DAOM 45776).\n\nNotes — Clade 64 contains the ex-type strain of D. alleghaniensis, isolated from Betula alleghaniensis in Canada. Diaporthe alleghaniensis causes canker and dieback of B. alleghaniensis, B. lenta, B. papyrifera and B. pendula in Canada (Arnold 1975), but has also been reported from Japan (Farr & Rossman 2012).\n\nDiaporthe alnea Fuckel, Jahrb. Nassauischen Vereins Naturk. 23–24: 207. 1870 (1869–1870)\n\n= Phomopsis alnea Höhn., Sber. Akad. Wiss. Wien, Math.-naturw. Kl., Abt. 1 115: 681 (33 of repr.). 1906.\n\nSpecimens examined. Unknown, on Alnus sp., June 1946, S. Truter (CBS 146.46); on Alnus sp., Aug. 1947, S. Truter (CBS 159.47).\n\nNotes — Clade 61 consists of two isolates from Alnus (presumably collected in the Netherlands). Diaporthe alnea causes dieback of Alnus glutinosa (alder) and A. incana (grey alder). It has been reported from Europe, Russia and the USA (Munk 1957, Oak & Dorset 1983, Moricca 2002, Mel’nik et al. 2008, Farr & Rossman 2012).\n\nDiaporthe ambigua Nitschke, Pyrenomycetes Germanici 2: 311. 1870\n\nSpecimens examined. Italy, Sicily, Catania, on Platanus acerifolia, G. Granata (CBS 127746 = IMI 395956); Perugia, on Helianthus annuus, Mar. 1987, A. Zazzerini (CBS 187.87). – Portugal, Vale Andeiro, on Foeniculum vulgare, J.M. Santos (CBS 123210 = Di-C003/10, CBS 123211 = Di-C002/9). – South Africa, Western Cape Province, from Pyrus communis, deposited 2002, S. Denman (ex-epitype culture CBS 114015 = CPC 2657); Western Cape Province, on crown of Aspalathus linearis, 15 May 1997, J.C. Janse van Rensburg (CBS 117167 = CPC 5414).\n\nNotes — Clade 26 represents D. ambigua, which contains two isolates previously misidentified as D. scabra (CBS 127746) and D. helianthi (CBS 187.87), and four isolates of D. ambigua, including the ex-epitype culture. Diaporthe ambigua is an important pathogen of Malus domestica, Prunus salicina and Pyrus communis in South African fruit orchards. Infection by D. ambigua is associated with sunken lesions with longitudinal cracks on affected fruit trees. The fungus rapidly kills nursery rootstocks, but also kills mature rootstocks over a longer period of time (Smit et al. 1996). This species is also found as saprobe on wild fennel (Santos & Phillips 2009). It has been reported on Aspalathus linearis (van Rensburg et al. 2006), Foeniculum vulgare, Malus domestica (Smit et al. 1996, Santos & Phillips 2009), Malus sylvestris (Crous et al. 2000), Prunus spp. (Smit et al. 1996, Mostert et al. 2001a), Pyrus communis (Nitschke 1867), Pyrus ussuriensis (Tai 1979) and Vitis vinifera (van Niekerk et al. 2005). It is widely distributed, and is known from China, Cuba (Tai 1979), Germany (Nitschke 1867), South Africa (Smit et al. 1996), UK (Dennis 1986) and the USA (Washington) (Shaw 1973).\n\nDiaporthe ampelina (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) R.R.

Pycnidial wall consisting out of two regions of textura angularis; the outer region brown, 2–3 cells thick, 5–7 μm wide, inner region brown, 3–4 cells thick, 7–15 μm wide, with the outside cells compressed. Conidial mass globose or in cirrhi, white, pale-yellow to yellow, but predominantly pale-yellow. Alpha conidiophores cylindrical, some filiform, rarely septate and branched, 5–35 × 1–3 μm (av. = 25 × 2 μm). Alpha conidiogenous cells subcylindrical, tapering towards the apex, collarettes and periclinal thickening present, 3–19 × 1–2 μm (av. = 10 × 1.5 μm). Alpha conidia commonly found, fusoid-ellipsoidal, apex acutely rounded, base obtuse to subtruncate, multi-guttulate with guttules grouped at the polar ends, rarely biguttulate, (7–)9.5–10.5(–13) × (1.5–)2–3(–3.5) μm (av. = 10 × 2.5 μm). Beta conidiophores ampulliform to subcylindrical, rarely branched, 10–34 × 1–2 μm (av. = 26 × 1.5 μm). Beta conidiogenous cells subcylindrical, tapering towards the apex, collarette and periclinal thickening present, 7–14 × 1–2 μm (av. = 11–1.5 μm). Beta conidia less common than alpha conidia, straight, curved or hamate, 20–25 × 0.5–1 μm (av. = 23–1 μm). Gamma conidia rarely observed, fusoid to subcylindrical, apex acutely rounded, base subtruncate, multi-guttulate, 12–18 × 1.5–2 μm (av. = 15 × 2 μm). Description adapted from Mostert et al. (2001a).\n\nSpecimens examined. France, Bordeaux, Naujan-et-Postiac, on Vitis vinifera (Cabernet Sauvignon grapevine), May 1998, P. Larignon (PREM 56460 neotype, ex-neotype culture CBS 114016). – Italy, Perugia, on Vitis vinifera, May 1980, A. Zazzerini (CBS 267.80 = CPC 2671). – Turkey, from Vitis vinifera, 1 Dec. 2001, M. Erkan (CBS 114867 = CPC 4708). – USA, California, on Vitis vinifera, J.D. Cucuzza (CBS 111888 = ATCC 48153 = CPC 2673).\n\nNotes — Grove (1919) distinguished P. ampelina (K 58408) from P. viticola by its external appearance on the host. However, Mostert et al. (2001a) re-examined the type specimen, and found alpha conidia to be ellipsoid-fusoid, 8–12 × 2.5–3.5 μm, within the range of P. viticola (Mostert et al. 2001a: f. 29), and thus considered them to be synonymous. Udayanga et al. (2012) proposed D. neoviticola as a nom. nov. for P. viticola, but this name is superfluous, as the older epithet ‘ampelina’ has precedence and should be adopted.\n\nDiaporthe ampelina (clade 53) is a well-resolved species. It causes cane and leaf spot and infections of pruning wounds of Vitis and Ampelopsidis spp. (Vitaceae). Several species of Diaporthe can infect the host and cause variable symptoms in different parts of the vine (canes, leaves and fruits) causing considerable confusion in the taxonomy of these species on grapevine (Phillips 1999, Scheper et al. 2000, Mostert et al. 2001a). Merrin et al. (1995) studied the variation of Diaporthe in Australia using morphology. They identified two taxa (Phomopsis taxon 1 and taxon 2), which cause cane and leaf blight of Vitis spp.; and taxon 2 was identified as showing more resemblance to P. viticola. Mostert et al. (2001a) studied the species occurring on grapevines in South Africa using morphological, cultural, molecular and pathological characterisation and clarified the taxonomy of this complex. Diaporthe ampelina (= Phomopsis viticola, D. neoviticola, Phomopsis taxon 2 from Australia) was found to be the cause of cane and leaf spot disease, and was neotypified. Although the sexual morph has never been reported, Santos et al. (2010) found both MAT loci to be present in this species, and showed that it is heterothallic. However, the sexual morph could not be induced in culture by crossing opposing mating types.\n\nDiaporthe amygdali (Delacr.) Udayanga, Crous & K.D. Hyde, Fung. Diversity 56: 166. 2012\n\nBasionym.

Uddin (CBS 115620 = FAU 1005).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe amygdali (clade 42) is the causal agent of twig canker and blight of almonds (Prunus dulcis) and peach (P. persica) wherever these hosts are grown (Diogo et al. 2010). It was first described as Fusicoccum amygdali causing cankers on almonds in France (Delacroix 1905). Tuset & Portilla (1989) re-examined the type specimen of F. amygdali and, based on morphology and symptomatology, they considered that it would be best accommodated in the genus Phomopsis. Clade 42 contains the ex-epitype strain (CBS 126679), five Phomopsis amygdali isolates from Prunus dulcis in Portugal, from P. persica in USA, P. salicina in South Africa, and from Vitis vinifera in South Africa.\n\nDiaporthe anacardii (Early & Punith.)

Mugnai (CBS 100871). – Portugal, Malveira da Serra, Sintra, on Foeniculum vulgare, A.J.L. Phillips (CBS 123215 = Ph-C133/1).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe angelicae (clade 17) is known to cause stem decay in several hosts including Heracleum sphondylium (Apiaceae) and Foeniculum vulgare (Apiaceae) in Europe and North America (Santos & Phillips 2009). Wehmeyer (1933) not only linked the conidial form of Phomopsis asteriscus to the sexual state Diaporthopsis angelicae, but also stated that Diaporthe berkeleyi was a synonym of Diaporthopsis angelicae. However, Castlebury et al. (2003) showed that Diaporthopsis is a synonym of Diaporthe, and also designated an epitype for D. angelicae.\n\nDiaporthe arctii (Lasch) Nitschke, Pyrenomycetes Germanici 2: 268. 1870\n\nBasionym. Sphaeria arctii Lasch, in Rabenh., Klotzsch. Herb. Vivum Mycol.: no. 1046. 1846.\n\n≡ Phomopsis arctii (Lasch) Traverso, Fl. Ital. Crypt., Pars 1: Fungi. Pyrenomycetae. Xylariaceae, Valsaceae, Ceratostomataceae: 226. 1906.\n\nSpecimen examined. Unknown, from Arctium sp., Sept. 1925, A.W. Archer (CBS 136.25).\n\nNotes — There are several clades that contain isolates previously identified as D. arctii (clades 16, 19, part 2 and 67, part 4). We suspect that clade 19 may represent the real D. arctii, as it is basal to D. subordinaria, and Wehmeyer (1933) regarded the latter (from Plantago lanceolata) as synonym of D. arctii (from Arctium).\n\nDiaporthe arecae (H.C. Srivast., Zakia & Govindar.) R.R. Gomes, C. Glienke & Crous, comb. nov. — MycoBank MB802924\n\nBasionym. Subramanella arecae H.C.

Srivastava (isotype CBS H-7808, ex-isotype culture CBS 161.64). – Suriname, on fruits of Citrus sp., Oct. 1975, I. Block (CBS 535.75).\n\nNotes — The Diaporthe isolate from citrus (CBS 535.75) could well be distinct, but more strains are required to resolve this clade (clade 87).\n\nDiaporthe arengae R.R. Gomes, C. Glienke & Crous, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB802925;\n\nEtymology. Named after the host genus from which it was collected, Arenga.\n\nPycnidia in culture on PNA sporulating poorly, subglobose, up to 250 μm diam, black, erumpent; cream conidial droplets exuding from central ostiole; walls consisting of 3–6 layers of medium brown textura angularis. Conidiophores hyaline in upper region, pale brown at base, smooth, 0–6-septate, branched, densely aggregated, cylindrical, straight to sinuous, 10–60 × 2.5–4 μm. Conidiogenous cells 8–15 × 1.5–2.5 μm, phialidic, cylindrical, terminal and lateral, with slight taper towards apex, 1–1.5 μm diam, with visible periclinal thickening; collarette not flared, up to 2 μm long when present. Paraphyses not observed. Alpha conidia aseptate, hyaline, guttulate, fusoid-ellipsoid, tapering towards both ends, apex subobtuse, base with flattened hilum, (5–)6–7(–9) × (2–)2.5(–3) μm. Gamma conidia not observed. Beta conidia rarely observed, subcylindrical, aseptate, smooth, hyaline, apex bluntly rounded, base truncate, tapering absent to very slight, curved, 20–25 × 1.5 μm.\n\nCulture characteristics — Colonies covering dish after 2 wk in the dark at 25 °C. On MEA surface with fluffy aerial mycelium, pale luteous, in reverse orange with patches of sienna. On OA umber with patches of sienna and saffron, in reverse umber with patches of saffron. On PDA surface with fluffy white aerial mycelium, umber with patches of saffron, in reverse umber with patches of pale luteous to luteous.\n\nSpecimen examined. Hong Kong, Victoria Peak, from Arenga engleri, 7 Oct. 1999, K.D. Hyde (holotype CBS H-21104, culture ex-type CBS 114979 = HKUCC 5527).\n\nNotes — The Diaporthe species occurring on palms are summarised by Fröhlich et al. (1997). Diaporthe arengae (clade 81) is distinguished from known species based on a combination of its conidial morphology and host.\n\nDiaporthe aspalathi E. Jansen, Castl. & Crous, Stud. Mycol. 55: 71. 2006\n\nBasionym. Diaporthe phaseolorum var. meridionalis F.A. Fernández, Mycologia 88: 438. 1996 (non D. meridionalis Sacc., Syll. Fung. 1: 638. 1878).\n\nSpecimens examined. South Africa, Western Cape Province, Clanwilliam, Langebergpunt, in branch on Aspalathus linearis, J.C. Janse van Rensburg (ex-type culture CBS 117169 = CPC 5428); in crown on Aspalathus linearis, 17 Oct. 1997, J.C. Janse van Rensburg (CBS 117168 = CPC 5420); on Aspalathus linearis, 2 Dec. 1996, S. Lamprecht (CBS 117500 = CPC 5408).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe aspalathi (clade 93) causes soybean stem canker in the South-eastern USA (Fernández & Hanlin 1996), and is not closely related to D. phaseolorum as might be expected. Although morphologically similar, this species clustered apart from the reference strain of D. phaseolorum (clade 4). Diaporthe aspalathi is also the main causal organism of canker and dieback of rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), and not D. phaseolorum as reported earlier (Smit & Knox-Davies 1989a, b, van Rensburg et al. 2006).\n\nDiaporthe australafricana Crous & Van Niekerk, Australas. Pl. Pathol. 34: 33. 2005\n\nSpecimens examined. Australia, on Vitis vinifera, 1 July 1995, R.W.A. Schepers (ex-type culture CBS 111886 = CPC 2676). – South Africa, on V. vinifera, 1 Nov. 1997, L. Mostert (CBS 113487 = CPC 2655).\n\nNotes — Clade 49 contains two isolates of D. australafricana, one of them being the ex-type strain (CBS 111886), which is a sibling species of D. viticola in clade 50 (van Niekerk et al. 2005). Both species were described from Vitis vinifera, but D. australafricana is thus far only known from grapevines in Australia and South Africa.\n\nDiaporthe batatas Harter & E.C. Field, Phytopathology 2: 121. 1912\n\nSpecimen examined. USA, on Ipomoea batatas, Feb. 1921, L.L. Harter (CBS 122.21).\n\nNotes — Clade 8 consists of a single strain of D. batatas isolated from Ipomoea batatas in the USA. This species and D. phaseolorum have in the past been considered as varieties, namely D. phaseolorum var. batatatis and D. phaseolorum var. batatae. However, the genetic data revealed no homology between the two species. Although it is not certain if CBS 122.21 (culture sterile) is an ex-type strain of D. batatas, it is regarded as authentic for the name.\n\nDiaporthe beckhausii Nitschke, Pyrenomycetes Germanici 2: 295. 1870\n\nSpecimen examined. Unknown, from Viburnum sp., Sept. 1927, L.E. Wehmeyer (CBS 138.27).\n\nNotes — Clade 47 is represented by D. beckhausii, which was isolated from Viburnum sp. (origin unknown, presumably North America, whereas the species was originally described from Viburnum collected in Germany). Diaporthe beckhausii is known from woody stems of Betula sp., Cydonia japonica, Elaeagnus angustifolia, Halesia sp., Menispermum canadense, Menispermum sp., V. opulus, Viburnum sp. and V. tinus in temperate North America and Europe (Farr & Rossman 2012).\n\nDiaporthe brasiliensis R.R. Gomes, C. Glienke & Crous, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB802926;\n\nEtymology. Named after the country where it was collected, Brazil.\n\nConidiomata pycnidial, globose to conical, immersed, scattered or aggregated, brown to black, ostiolate, 70–160 μm wide, 60–140 μm tall, necks 60–130 μm tall, outer surface smooth; pycnidal wall consisting of brown, thick-walled cells of textura angularis; conidial mass globose, white to pale-luteous. Conidiophores hyaline, cylindrical, filiform, straight to curved, 1–3-septate, (17–)20–27(–30) × 2(–4) μm. Alpha conidiogenous cells hyaline, cylindrical, filiform, straight to curved, collarette flared, with slight periclinal thickening, (7–)8–12(–14) × 2(–3) μm. Alpha conidia hyaline, ellipsoid to irregular, apex bluntly rounded, base obtuse to subtruncate, bi- to multi-guttulate, 6–7(–8) × 2–3 μm. Beta and gamma conidia not observed.\n\nCulture characteristics — Colonies on PDA flat, with an entire edge, surface mycelium dense and felty, buff, grey-olivaceous or olivaceous-grey; colonies covering dish after 2 wk at 25 °C in the dark; reverse olivaceous, dull green, olivaceous-buff. On OA raised, entire edge, surface mycelium dense felty, smoke-grey to grey-olivaceous; reverse purplish grey to pale purplish grey, grey olivaceous or olivaceous buff. On MEA raised, with an entire edge, buff, smoke-grey, with patches of olivaceous-grey and vinaceous-buff; reverse dark mouse-grey, buff.\n\nSpecimens examined.

Vrandečić (ex-neotype culture CBS 127268).\n\nNotes — Clade 91 is represented by two isolates of D. caulivora on Glycine soja and G. max, respectively obtained from Canada (CBS 178.55) and Croatia (ex-neotype: CBS 127268). The soybean canker species complex was recently treated by Santos et al. (2011).\n\nDiaporthe celastrina Ellis & Barthol., J. Mycol. 8, 4: 173. 1902\n\nSpecimen examined. Unknown, on Celastrus scandens, Sept. 1927, L.E. Wehmeyer (CBS 139.27).\n\nNotes — Strains from the USA are required to confirm the identity of this culture (clade 66).\n\nDiaporthe chamaeropis (Cooke) R.R. Gomes, C. Glienke & Crous, comb. nov. — MycoBank MB802927;\n\nBasionym. Phoma chamaeropis Cooke, Grevillea 13 (no. 68): 95. 1885.\n\n≡ Phomopsis chamaeropsis (Cooke) Petr., as ‘Phomopsis chamaeropis’, Ann.

Conidiophores hyaline, smooth, 1–5-septate, branched, densely aggregated, cylindrical, straight to sinuous, 10–50 × 2–2.5 μm. Conidiogenous cells 10–20 × 1.5–2 μm, phialidic, cylindrical, terminal and lateral, with slight taper towards apex, 1–1.5 μm diam, with visible periclinal thickening; collarette not observed. Paraphyses not observed. Alpha conidia aseptate, hyaline, smooth, guttulate, fusoid to ellipsoid, tapering towards both ends, straight, apex subobtuse, base subtruncate, (5–)6–8(–9) × 2(–2.5) μm.

Beta conidia spindle-shaped, aseptate, smooth, hyaline, apex acutely rounded, base truncate, tapering from lower third towards apex, curved, (20–)22–27(–30) × 1.5(–2) μm.\n\nCulture characteristics — Colonies covering dish after 2 wk in the dark at 25 °C. On OA with moderate aerial mycelium, surface dirty white with patches of pale olivaceous-grey, reverse with patches of dirty white and sienna. On MEA surface dirty white with patches of olivaceous-grey, reverse sienna, with patches of luteous. On PDA surface olivaceous-grey with patches of dirty white, reverse iron-grey.\n\nSpecimens examined. Croatia, Rab, slope behind Hotel ‘Imperial’, on dead branch of Spartium junceum, July 1970, J.A. von Arx (CBS 753.70). – Greece, Thessaloniki, dead part of leaf of Chamaerops humilis, Aug. 1981, H.A. van der Aa (CBS 454.81).\n\nNotes — Conidial dimensions closely fit those provided in the original description (on Chamaerops humulis from Czechoslovakia; Uecker 1988), suggesting that these cultures (clade 77) could be authentic for the name.\n\nDiaporthe cinerascens Sacc., Syll. Fung. (Abellini) 1: 679. 1882. —\n\n= Phoma cinerescens Sacc., Michelia 1 (no. 5): 521. 1879.\n\n≡ Phomopsis cinerascens (Sacc.) Traverso, Fl. Ital. Crypt. Pyrenomycetae 2, 1: 278. 1906.\n\nConidiomata pycnidial, sporulating poorly on MEA, globose, up to 300 μm diam, black, erumpent; creamy-luteous conidial droplets exuding from central ostioles; walls consisting of 3–6 layers of medium brown textura angularis. Conidiophores hyaline, smooth, 1–3-septate, branched, densely aggregated, cylindrical, straight to sinuous, 17–30 × 2–3 μm. Conidiogenous cells 8–18 × 2–3 μm, phialidic, cylindrical, terminal and lateral, with slight taper towards apex, 1.5–2 μm diam, with visible periclinal thickening; collarette mostly absent, slightly flared when present, up to 2 μm long. Paraphyses not observed. Alpha conidia aseptate, hyaline, smooth, guttulate, fusoid to ellipsoid, tapering towards both ends, straight, apex subobtuse, base subtruncate, 7–8(–9) × (2.5–)3 μm. Gamma conidia aseptate, hyaline, smooth, ellipsoid-fusoid, apex acutely rounded, base subtruncate, 8–12 × 3 μm. Beta conidia not observed.\n\nCulture characteristics — Colonies covering dish after 2 wk in the dark at 25 °C. On MEA with profuse aerial mycelium, surface dirty white, reverse ochreous with patches of umber. On PDA with sparse aerial mycelium, surface olivaceous-grey, reverse iron-grey. On OA surface with moderate aerial mycelium, olivaceous-grey to pale olivaceous-grey.\n\nSpecimen examined. Bulgaria, Kostinbrod, Plant Protection Institute, on branch of Ficus carica, 1995, E. Ilieva (CBS 719.96).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe cinerascens (clade 76) represents a European species occurring on Ficus, so the present culture could be authentic for the name, as the conidial dimenions match those provided in the original description. This species was orginally associated with canker and dieback of Ficus spp. in Italy (Saccardo 1879), and the causal organism identified as Phomopsis cinerascens (sexual morph: Diaporthe cinerascens) by Grove (1935). Diaporthe cinerascens affects all commercial figs in California (Ogawa & English 1991), and is found in several geographical locations of the world (Hampson 1981, Anderson & Hartman 1983, Benschop et al. 1984, Banihashemi & Javadi 2009). Ficus spp. are important exotic garden ornamentals across the USA and Canada as well as in the tropics.\n\nDiaporthe citri F.A. Wolf, J. Agric. Res. 33, 7: 625. 1926\n\n= Phomopsis citri H.S. Fawc., Phytopathology 2, 3: 109. 1912.\n\nSpecimens examined. Brazil, on seed of Glycine max, A. Almeida EMBRAPA/PR (LGMF 946 = CPC 20322). – Italy, unknown host, June 1939, G. Goidánich (CBS 199.39). – Suriname, Paramaribo, on decaying fruit of Citrus sinensis, Apr. 1932, N.J. van Suchtelen (CBS 230.52).\n\nNotes — Clade 6 is represented by three isolates. One isolate (CBS 199.39) was previously identified as D. conorum from Italy, while another originates from soybean seed collected in Brazil (LGMF 946), and the third isolate is from Citrus sinensis in Suriname (CBS 230.52). Because D. conorum is regarded as synonym of D. eres (clade 67), we tentatively refer to this clade as D. citri, awaiting more isolates from Citrus. Diaporthe citri is a serious pathogen that is widely distributed, and associated with melanosis and stem-end rot of citrus fruits (Punithalingam & Holliday 1973, McKenzie 1992, Mondal et al. 2007, Farr & Rossman 2012).\n\nDiaporthe convolvuli (Ormeno-Nuñez, Reeleder & A.K.

Turkey, isolated from leaves with anthracnose on Convolvulus arvensis, D. Berner (CBS 124654 = DP 0727).\n\nNotes — Phomopsis convolvuli (clade 3) was originally described from diseased leaves of Convolvulus arvensis in Québec (Ormeno-Nuñez et al. 1988). The isolate of Phomopsis convolvuli studied here (CBS 124654), was found causing anthracnose on field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), a troublesome perennial weed to many important agricultural crops in the world, and was considered potentially useful as biological control agent (Kuleci et al. 2009).\n\nDiaporthe crataegi (Curr.)

Netherlands, Maassluis, on twig of Elaeagnus sp., May 1972, J. Gremmen (CBS 504.72).\n\nNotes — In culture CBS 504.72 (clade 73) primarily produces beta conidia (spindle shaped, 16–22 × 2 μm, thus wider than seen on average in most other species); alpha conidia rarely observed, fusoid-ellipsoidal, 7–10 × 2–3 μm, thus correlating with dimensions of Phomopsis elaeagni (Sacc.) Petr., which is a homonym of P. elaeagni Sacc. Furthermore, conidial dimensions of the asexual state of D. elaeagni are not known. Additional collections and type studies are thus required to resolve the complex occurring on Elaeagnus.\n\nDiaporthe endophytica R.R. Gomes, C.

Wehmeyer (1933) described this species on more than 60 hosts, and listed several synonymies based on morphological data. A detailed morphological study is required to designate a suitable epitype strain for D. eres, and to resolve the status of all its purported synonyms.\n\nDiaporthe eugeniae (Punith.) R.R. Gomes, C.

Phillips (CBS 111553).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe foeniculacea (clade 78) was originally described from Foeniculum vulgare in Portugal, and represents an older name for D. theicola and D. neotheicola. There are many described species that occur on Foeniculum vulgare (wild fennel). Among them, P. theicola and its teleomorph D. neotheicola (Santos & Phillips 2009), and D. foeniculacea, the causal agent of stem necrosis of fennel. Phillips (2003) redescribed D. foeniculacea, and established the sexual-asexual connection between D. foeniculacea and Phomopsis foeniculina. The synonymy of D. neotheicola under D. foeniculacea is based on the fact that the cultures matching the original descriptions are in fact genetically identical. However, as there are no ex-type strains of D. foeniculacea, this synonymy strongly relies on the earlier opinion of Phillips (2003). Either way, this matter can only be resolved once an epitype has been designated for D. foeniculacea, fixing the application of the name. We recommend that additional collections linked to stem necrosis of fennel in Portugal are obtained, before this decision is made.\n\nDiaporthe ganjae (McPartl.) R.R. Gomes, C.

McPartland (holotype HA 10987, ex-type culture ILLS 43621 = CBS 180.91).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe ganjae (clade 24) is known only from the original collection taken from wilted, dead leaves of Cannabis sativa in Illinois, USA (McPartland 1983). Phylogenetically D. ganjae is closely related to an isolate identified as D. manihotia (CBS 505.76), isolated from Manihot utilissima in Rwanda (clade 25).\n\nDiaporthe gardeniae (Buddin & Wakef.)

Ribaldi (CBS 288.56).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe gardeniae (clade 59) causes gardenia canker in Gardenia jasminoides, G. lucida and Gardenia sp. (Farr & Rossman 2012). This disease is considered as serious (Tilford 1934, Huber 1936, Miller 1961). It was originally observed in 1894 in England (Cooke 1894), and has since been reported from the USA (Preston 1945) and India (Mathur 1979). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, including roots, stems and leaves (McKenzie et al. 1940), although cankered stems are the most diagnostic symptoms for this disease.\n\nDiaporthe helianthi Munt.-Cvetk., Mihaljč. & M.

Yield reductions of up to 40 % have been recorded in Europe (Masirevic & Gulya 1992) including the former Yugoslavia as well as France where it was considered a major pathogen of sunflower (Battilani et al. 2003, Debaeke et al. 2003). Diaporthe helianthi is also widespread in the sunflower growing regions of the USA (Gulya et al. 1997). The wide geographic distribution, and high genetic variability of the pathogen lead to the evolution of new strains that could be more aggressive, causing large yield losses and a decline in disease control (Pecchia et al. 2004, Rekab et al. 2004).\n\nDiaporthe cf. heveae 1\n\nSpecimen examined. Brazil, São Paulo, from Hevea brasiliensis, Apr. 1997, D.S. Attili (CBS 852.97) (originally identified as Phomopsis heveae).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe heveae and Phomopsis heveae were both described from Hevea in Sri Lanka, and could represent the same species. Two isolates deposited in CBS under this name, CBS 852.97 (from Hevea brasiliensis in Brazil) and CBS 681.84 (from Hevea brasiliensis in India) were shown to represent two distinct species (clades 46 and 80, respectively). However, as both were found to be sterile, their taxonomy could not be resolved.\n\nDiaporthe cf. heveae 2\n\nSpecimen examined. India, Kerala, Kottayam, in leaf on Hevea brasiliensis, Sept. 1984, K.

Wehmeyer (ex-type culture CBS 194.36).\n\nNotes — Clade 27 comprises the ex-type culture of D. strumella var. longispora isolated from Ribes sp., and forms a sister clade with D. sclerotioides (clade 28). Diaporthe strumella is found on woody limbs, especially of Ribes spp. in temperate North America and Europe (Farr & Rossman 2012). As D. strumella var. longispora is morphologically clearly a distinct species, we elevate this variety to species status.\n\nDiaporthe lusitanicae A.J.L. Phillips & J.M. Santos, Fung. Diversity 34: 118. 2009\n\nSpecimen examined. Portugal, Lisbon, Oeiras, Estação Agronómica Nacional, stem of Foeniculum vulgare, 14 Aug. 2007, J.M. Santos (ex-type cultures CBS 123212 = Di-C001/5, CBS 123213 = Di-C001/3).\n\nNotes — This species (clade 21) was described in 2009 on senescent stems of Foeniculum vulgare (wild fennel) in Portugal by Santos & Phillips (2009).\n\nDiaporthe manihotia Punith., Kavaka 3: 29. 1976 (1975)\n\n= Phomopsis manihotis Swarup, L.S. Chauhan & Tripathi, Mycopathol. Mycol. Appl. 28, 4: 345. 1966.\n\nSpecimen examined. Rwanda, on leaves of Manihot utilissima, 9 July 1976, J. Semal (CBS 505.76).\n\nNotes — Phomopsis manihotis (clade 25 as D. manihotia) causes leaf spot of cassava (Manihot esculenta), though the disease is also referred to as Phomopsis blight of tapioca. Severe infection leads to defoliation and stem lesions. Affected areas become shrivelled with numerous pycnidia embedded in the tissue. On severely infected stems the bark starts to gradually peel off, leading to partial or total girdling. The disease is known from Africa (Ethiopia, Nigeria), Asia (India), Central America and West Indies (S.E. Dominica), and South America (Colombia) (Sarbhoy et al. 1971, Mathur 1979, Farr & Rossman 2012).\n\nDiaporthe mayteni R.R. Gomes, C. Glienke & Crous, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB802939;\n\nEtymology.

Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia 42: 235. 1890\n\nSpecimen examined. Unknown, from Sambucus canadensis, Sept. 1927, L.E. Wehmeyer (CBS 143.27).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe megalospora (clade 15) is known on Sambucus canadensis from North America (Wehmeyer 1933, Hanlin 1963, Farr & Rossman 2012). Fresh collections are required to designate an epitype, and fix the genetic application of the name.\n\nDiaporthe melonis Beraha & M.J. O’Brien, Phytopathol. Z. 94, 3: 205. 1979\n\n= Phomopsis cucurbitae McKeen, Canad. J. Bot. 35: 46. 1957.\n\nSpecimens examined. Indonesia, Java, Muneng, Exp. Station, on Glycine soja, Sept. 1987, H.

Shivas (ex-type culture CBS 129519 = CPC 17026).\n\nNotes — Clade 84 represents D. musigena, isolated from Musa sp. in Australia (Crous et al. 2011).\n\nDiaporthe neilliae Peck, Ann. Rep. N.Y. State Mus. Nat. Hist. 39: 52. 1887 (1886)\n\nSpecimen examined. Unknown, on Spiraea sp., Sep. 1927, L.E. Wehmeyer (CBS 144.27).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe neilliae (clade 60) was originally described from Spiraea sp. from North America. The origin of the present isolate, however, remains unclear (presumably North America).\n\nDiaporthe neoarctii R.R. Gomes, C. Glienke & Crous, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB802940,\n\nEtymology. Named after its superficial resemblance to Diaporthe arctii.\n\nConidiomata pycnidial, ampulliform to finger-like, aggregated, dark brown to black, immersed, ostiolate, 300–450 μm wide, 200–670 μm tall, with prominent necks 240–560 μm long, outer surface covered with hyphae; pycnidal wall consisting of brown, thick-walled cells of textura angularis; conidial mass globose, pale yellow. Conidiophores hyaline, ampulliform to subcylindrical, filiform, branched above the septa, tapering towards the apex, rarely septate, (12–)13–17(–18) × (2–)3 μm. Conidiogenous cells hyaline, subcylindrical, filiform, straight, tapering towards the apex, collarette flared, periclinal thickening prominent, (10–)11–13(–14) × (1.5–)2(–3) μm.

On MEA umber with patches of greyish sepia, umber in reverse. On PDA fuscous-black on surface and in reverse.\n\nSpecimen examined. USA, New Jersey, isolated from Ambrosia trifida, May 2001, G. Bills (holotype CBS H-21094, ex-type culture CBS 109490 = GB 6421 = AR 3450).\n\nNotes — Isolates originally identified as D. arctii cluster in clades 19 and 67 ( ). Diaporthe neoarctii (clade 16) was isolated from Ambrosia trifida in New Jersey, USA, and differs morphologically from the ex-type culture of D. arctii (alpha conidia 7 × 3–3.5 μm) (clade 19). Based on these differences D. neoarctii is described as a novel species.\n\nDiaporthe nobilis complex\n\nSpecimens examined. Germany, Münster, on stem of Laurus nobilis, Feb. 1939, Kotthoff (CBS 200.39). – Japan, isolate from Pinus pentaphylla bonzai plant imported from Japan into the Netherlands, May 1979, G.H.

Muntañola-Cvetkovic (CBS 338.89).\n\nNotes — Clade 62 is poorly resolved in this dataset, but has some internal structure, suggesting that it contains several potentially distinct species. More isolates would be required to resolve their taxonomy. Isolates in this clade were originally identified as Phomopsis fukushii (on Pyrus pyrifolia, New Zealand), P. conorum (on Pinus pentaphylla, the Netherlands), P. castanea (on Castanea sativa, UK), Diaporthe perniciosa (Malus pumila, New Zealand), D. pulla (on Hedera helix, Yugoslavia) and D. nobilis (on Laurus nobilis, Germany).\n\nDiaporthe nomurai Hara, in Hara, Diseases of cultivated plants: 140. 1925. —\n\nConidiomata in culture on OA sporulating poorly, globose, up to 300 μm diam, black, erumpent; cream conidial droplets exuding from central ostioles; walls consisting of 3–6 layers of medium brown textura angularis.

On MEA surface isabelline, reverse sepia. On OA surface pale mouse grey with concentric rings of mouse grey; reverse mouse grey. On PDA surface and reverse fuscous-black, with sparse aerial mycelium.\n\nSpecimen examined. Japan, on Morus sp., Dec. 1929, K. Togashi (CBS 157.29).\n\nNotes — Clade 58 represents D. nomurai from Morus sp. in Japan. Diaporthe nomurai is known from hosts such as Morus alba, M. bombycis, M. latifolia and Morus sp. (Farr & Rossman 2012).\n\nDiaporthe novem J.M. Santos, Vrandečić & A.J.L. Phillips, Persoonia 27: 14. 2011\n\n= Phomopsis sp. 9 van Rensburg et al., Stud. Mycol. 55: 65. 2006.\n\nSpecimens examined. Brazil, endophytic in petiole on Maytenus ilicifolia, July 2007, R.R. Gomes (LGMF 943 = CPC 20319). – Croatia, Slavonija, in seed on Glycine max, Sept. 2008, T. Duvnjak (holotype CBS H-20462, ex-type cultures CBS 127270 = 4-27/3-1, CBS 127271 = 5/27/3-3, CBS 127269 = 5-27/3-1). – Romania, Calugareni, Distr. Mizil, living leaves on Polygonatum odoratum, 31 July 1970, O. Constantinescu (CBS 354.71).\n\nNotes — Clade 22 represents D. novem (Santos et al. 2011), and contains an endophytic isolate (LGMF 43) from Maytenus ilicifolia, one isolate previously identified as Diaporthe pardalota on Polygonatum odoratum from Romania, and three isolates of D. novem which includes the ex-type isolate. Isolate LGMF 943 represents higher genetic variation than the other isolates, and appears to represent a different species. Since this isolate did not sporulate, further morphological characterisation was not possible and we refrain from excluding it from the species pending collection of more strains to clarify its status.\n\nDiaporthe novem was reported as pathogen of Aspalathus linearis (van Rensburg et al. 2006) as Phomopsis sp. 9. It was recently described as pathogen of Glycine max (Santos et al. 2011). This species was also reported on Hydrangea macrophylla (Santos et al. 2010), Helianthus annuus and Vitis vinifera (Santos et al. 2011). It is known to occur in Brazil, Romania, Croatia, Italy (Rekab et al. 2004), Portugal (Santos et al. 2010) and South Africa (van Niekerk et al. 2005, van Rensburg et al. 2006).\n\nDiaporthe oncostoma (Duby) Fuckel, Jahrb.

France, Hte Savoie, Aigueblanche-Bellecombe, outlet of river Morel in Isère, on dead branches of Robinia pseudoacacia, 17 July 1978, H.A. van der Aa (CBS 589.78). – Germany, Wolfenbüttel, on leaf spot of Robinia pseudoacacia, 15 Nov. 1996, H. Butin (CBS 100454); Berlin, on leaf of Ilex aquifolium, Nov. 1985, M. Hesse (CBS 809.85). – Russia, on Robinia pseudoacacia, June 2000, L. Vasilyeva (CBS 109741 = AR 3445).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe oncostoma (clade 70) has been considered to be a saprobic, or low virulence pathogen, which plays some role in natural pruning and self-thinning of black locust forests (Robinia pseudoacacia) (Vajna 2002). However, this fungus has been reported as a causal agent of canker and severe dieback disease of black locust in Russia (Scerbin-Parfenenko 1953) and in Greece (Michalopoulos-Skarmoutsos & Skarmoutsos 1999).\n\nAlthough isolate CBS 809.85 was obtained from Ilex aquifolium in Germany, we treat it as belonging to D. oncostoma, as it matches the other strains phylogenetically as well as morphologically.\n\nDiaporthe oxe R.R. Gomes, C. Glienke & Crous, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB802941;\n\nEtymology. The word ‘oxe’ is an expression used in northeastern Brazil that means amazement or surprise, in relation to the number of novel species isolated as endophytes from medicinal plants in Brazil.\n\nConidiomata pycnidial ampulliform to finger-like, eustromatic, convoluted to unilocular, semi-immersed, scattered, dark brown to black, ostiolate, 60–170 μm wide, 60–220 μm tall; necks variable in length, 20–150 μm, outer surface covered with hyphae; pycnidal wall consisting of brown, thick-walled cells of textura angularis; conidial mass globose or exuding in cirrhi, pale-luteous to cream or pale-yellow.

Austria, from Ulmus glabra, Oct. 2001, A.Y. Rossman (ex-epitype culture CBS 109745 = ARSEF 3461 = AR 3461).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe perjuncta (clade 40) is associated with fallen branches of Ulmus campestris and U. glabra (Ulmaceae). This species is found in Austria, Germany and Portugal. Diaporthe perjuncta is distinguished from D. viticola and D. australafricana based on morphology and DNA sequence data (van Niekerk et al. 2005). Pathogenicity studies and endophytic isolation of ‘D. perjuncta’ from grapevines in Australia and South Africa in fact represent isolates of D. australafricana (Mostert et al. 2001a, Rawnsley et al. 2004, van Niekerk et al. 2005).\n\nDiaporthe perseae (Zerova) R.R.

Mengistu (CBS 116019); Mississippi, from Aster exilis, Oct. 2003, A. Mengistu (CBS 116020).\n\nNotes — Clade 4 represents isolates of D. phaseolorum. It includes two endophytic isolates from Maytenus ilicifolia collected in Brazil, one isolate previously misidentified as D. melonis (CBS 257.80), two isolates respectively from Caperonia palustres and Aster exilis in the USA (Mengistu et al. 2007), one isolate from Olearia cf. rami, and one from Actinidia chinensis. The ITS and TEF1 sequences of this clade are similar to sequences (GenBank {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"U11323\",\"term_id\":\"508880\",\"term_text\":\"U11323\"}}U11323, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"U11373\",\"term_id\":\"508930\",\"term_text\":\"U11373\"}}U11373 and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"EU222020\",\"term_id\":\"171917951\",\"term_text\":\"EU222020\"}}EU222020, respectively) of a well-characterised isolate of D. phaseolorum (ATCC 64802 = FAU458). By accepting this clade as authentic for D. phaseolorum, we follow the precedent set by van Rensburg et al. (2006), Mengistu et al. (2007) and Santos et al. (2011).\n\nDiaporthe pseudomangiferae R.R. Gomes, C. Glienke & Crous, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB802945;\n\nEtymology.

Dominican Republic, from Mangifera indica, P. de Leeuw, ATO-DLO, Wageningen (holotype CBS H-21105, culture ex-type CBS 101339). – Mexico, on fruit peel of Mangifera indica (CBS 388.89).\n\nNotes — Although these isolates (clade 82) were originally described as representative of P. magiferae (dead leaves of Mangifera indica, Pakistan), they differ in having larger conidiomata, longer conidiophores and larger alpha conidia.\n\nDiaporthe pseudophoenicicola R.R. Gomes, C. Glienke & Crous, sp. nov. —MycoBank MB803839;\n\nEtymology. Named after its morphological similarity to Diaporthe phoenicicola.\n\nConidiomata pycnidial on MEA, up to 400 μm diam, erumpent, globose with neck; ostiole exuding yellow-orange conidial droplets; walls consisting of 3–6 layers of medium brown textura angularis. Conidiophores hyaline, smooth, densely aggregated, 1–3-septate, branched, cylindrical, straight to curved, 12–45 × 1.5–3 μm. Conidiogenous cells phialidic, cylindrical, terminal and lateral with slight apical taper, 12–20 × 1.5–2 μm, with visible periclinal thickening; collarette flared, 2–5 μm long. Paraphyses hyaline, smooth, cylindrical, 1–3-septate, extending above conidiophores, straight to flexuous, unbranched or branched, up to 100 μm long, and 3 μm wide at base.

On MEA surface dirty white with patches of sienna, reverse umber with patches of sienna. On OA surface dirty white with patches of sienna. On PDA surface ochreous with patches of olivaceous-grey, reverse iron-grey with patches of ochreous.\n\nSpecimens examined. Iraq, Prov. Basrah, Shalt El Arab, showing dieback on Mangifera indica, 1976, M.S.A. Al-Momen (CBS 176.77). – Spain, Mallorca, Can Pastilla, dead tops of green leaves on Phoenix dactylifera, 27 May 1969, H.A. van der Aa (holotype CBS H-21106, culture ex-type CBS 462.69).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe pseudophoenicicola (clade 89) is distinct from D. phoenicicola (conidia 8–12 × 2–2.5 μm; Uecker 1988) by having shorter, and wider alpha conidia. A similar strain was isolated from Mangifera indica in Iraq (CBS 176.77), suggesting that this species has a wider host range.\n\nDiaporthe pustulata Sacc., Syll. Fung. (Abellini) 1: 610. 1882\n\nSpecimens examined. Austria, on Acer pseudoplatanus, Oct. 2001, A.Y. Rossman (CBS 109742 = AR 3430 and CBS 109760 = AR 3535); Raab, Au Wald, on Prunus padus, Oct. 2001, A.Y. Rossman (CBS 109784 = AR 3419).\n\nNotes — Clade 44 contains one isolate from Prunus padus and two isolates from Acer pseudoplatanus, all isolated from Austria. Clade 56 contains another isolate on Prunus padus from Sweden. Clearly there are two different species from Prunus, one isolated in Austria and another in Sweden. Because D. pustulata was originally described on Acer pseudoplatanus, we tentatively apply this name to isolates in clade 44. To clarify the status of isolates in clades 44 and 56, however, additional isolates and a comparison with type materials would be required.\n\nDiaporthe raonikayaporum R.R. Gomes, C. Glienke & Crous, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB802947;\n\nEtymology. Raoni + Kayapo = after the name of a leader (Raoni) of the indigenous Kayapo ethnic tribe in Brazil. The Kayapos are inhabitants of the Amazon region in Brazil. They use the medicinal plant Spondias mombin, from which this species was isolated, as adornment or ornament, and for its medicinal properties.\n\nConidiomata pycnidial, globose to conical or ampullifom, eustromatic and convoluted or unilocular, scattered, dark brown to black, immersed, ostiolate, 110–200 μm wide, 50–130 μm tall, with prominent necks 40–140 μm long, outer surface smooth or covered in hyphae; pycnidal wall consisting of brown, thick-walled cells of textura angularis; conidial mass globose or exuding in cirrhi, white to pale-luteous. Conidiophores hyaline, ampulliform to subcylindrical, filiform, branched above the septa, tapering towards the apex, 1–3-septate, (16–)17–22(–26) × (2–)3 μm. Conidiogenous cells hyaline, subcylindrical, filiform, straight to curved, tapering towards the apex, collarette not flared, periclinal thickening prominent, (5–)7–9(–10) × (2–)3 μm. Alpha and gamma conidia are formed in the same conidiogenous cells. Alpha conidia hyaline, oblong to ellipsoid, apex bluntly rounded, base obtuse to subtruncate, bi- to multi-guttulate, (6–)7(–8) × (2–)3 μm. Beta conidia not observed. Gamma conidia hyaline, fusoid to subcylindrical, slightly curved, apex bluntly rounded, base obtuse to subtruncate, bi- to multi-guttulate, or eguttulate, (7–)9–11(–13) × (1–)2 μm.\n\nCulture characteristics — Colonies on PDA flat, with an entire edge, aerial mycelium forming concentric rings with cottony texture, olivaceous-buff, isabelline to honey on surface; colonies reaching 63 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 °C; reverse pale purplish grey to smoke-grey. On OA flat, with an entire edge, aerial mycelium forming concentric rings, white, olivaceous on surface, colonies reaching 31 mm diam; reverse buff and greenish olivaceous. On MEA flat, with a lobate edge, aerial mycelium forming wooly concentric rings, olivaceous-grey, greenish olivaceous and patches of amber on surface, colonies reaching 51 mm diam; reverse brown-vinaceous.\n\nSpecimen examined. Brazil, Pará, Redenção, endophytic species isolated from leaf of Spondias mombin (popular name Cajazeira and Taperebá), July 2007, K. Rodriguez (holotype CBS H-21097, ex-type culture CBS 133182 = LGMF 923 = CPC 20299).\n\nNotes — Endophytic isolate (clade 31) from medicinal plant in Brazil.\n\nDiaporthe rhoina Feltgen, Vorstud. Pilzfl. Luxemb., Nachtr. III: 145. 1903\n\nSpecimen examined. Unknown, on Rhus toxicodendron, Sept. 1927, L.E. Wehmeyer (CBS 146.27).\n\nNotes — This species (clade 95) was originally described on Rhus typhina from Luxembourg. European isolates of this pathogen will need to be collected to confirm the identity of CBS 146.27, which is presumably of North American origin.\n\nDiaporthe saccarata (J.C. Kang, L. Mostert & Crous) Crous, comb. nov. — MB802948\n\nBasionym. Phomopsis saccarata J.C. Kang, L. Mostert & Crous, Sydowia 53, 2: 230. 2001.\n\nSpecimen examined. South Africa, Western Cape Province, Jonkershoek Mountains, Stellenbosch, on cankers of Protea repens, Mar. 1999, S. Denman (ex-type culture CBS 116311 = CPC 3743).\n\nNote — Diaporthe saccarata (clade 71) is known to cause a canker disease on shoots of Protea repens in South Africa (Mostert et al. 2001b).\n\nDiaporthe schini R.R. Gomes, C. Glienke & Crous, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB802949;\n\nEtymology. Named after the host genus from which it was isolated, Schinus.\n\nConidiomata pycnidial, eustromatic, multilocular, immersed to erumpent, ostiolate, dark brown to black, scattered or aggregated, 80–270 μm wide, 70–240 μm tall, prominent necks 70–220 μm long, outer surface covered with hyphae; pycnidal wall consisting of brown, thick-walled cells of textura angularis; conidial mass globose, pale-luteous to cream. Conidiophores hyaline, subcylindrical, filiform, rarely branched, tapering towards the apex, 0–1-septate, (11–)12–17(–20) × (2–)3(–4) μm. Conidiogenous cells hyaline, subcylindrical and filiform, straight, tapering towards the apex, collarette not observed, with prominent periclinal thickening 5–6(–7) × (1–)2 μm. Beta conidia hyaline, smooth, curved or hamate (14–)22–28(–30) × (1–)2 μm. Alpha and gamma conidia not observed.\n\nCulture characteristics — Colonies on PDA flat, with a lobate margin, surface mycelium sparse, felty and appressed, buff, honey to isabelline; colonies reaching 30 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 °C; reverse greyish sepia, smoke-grey. On OA with a lobate margin, surface mycelium flat, sparse, felty and appressed, smoke-grey, olivaceous-grey, or olivaceous buff; colonies reaching 21 mm diam; reverse pale mouse-grey to olivaceous-grey or buff. On MEA with a lobate margin, surface mycelium flat, dense, felty and appressed, buff with umber patches; colonies reaching 30 mm diam; reverse dark mouse-grey, umber, with patches of isabelline or luteous.\n\nSpecimen examined. Brazil, Paraná, Curitiba, endophytic species isolated from leaf of Schinus terebinthifolius (popular name Aroeira), July 2007, J. Lima (holotype CBS H-21093, culture ex-type CBS 133181 = LGMF 921 = CPC 20297); same collection details (LGMF 910).\n\nNotes — Other than D. schini (clade 11), additional endophytic isolates were also obtained from Schinus terebinthifolius in Brazil, but these are morphologically different and cluster in clades 5 and 9 (D. endophytica and D. terebinthifolii).\n\nDiaporthe sclerotioides (Kesteren) Udayanga, Crous & K.D. Hyde, Fung. Diversity 56: 166. 2012\n\nBasionym. Phomopsis sclerotioides Kesteren, Neth. Jl. Pl. Path. 73: 115. 1967.\n\nSpecimens examined. Netherlands, Maarssen, on root of Cucumis sativus, June 1967, H.A. van der Kesteren (ex-type culture CBS 296.67 = ATCC 18585 = IMI 151828 = PD 68/690); Roermond, on root of C. sativus, Dec. 1976 (CBS 710.76 = PD 76/674).\n\nNotes — Diaporthe sclerotioides (clade 28) was originally described from roots of Cucumis sativus in the Netherlands. This species has subsequently been reported to cause black root rot of Citrullus lanatus, Cucurmis sativus, C. ficifolia, C. maxima and C. moschata in various countries in the world (Udayanga et al. 2011).\n\nDiaporthe scobina Nitschke, Pyrenomycetes Germanici 2: 293. 1870\n\n= Phomopsis scobina Höhn., Sber. Akad. Wiss. Wien, Math.-naturw. Kl., Abt. 1 115: 681 (33 of repr.). 1906.\n\nSpecimen examined. Scotland, living and dead twig of Fraxinus excelsior, Feb. 1938, J.A. MacDonald (CBS 251.38).\n\nNotes — Clade 38 is represented by D. scobina isolated from Fraxinus excelsior in Scotland. The fungus is known on this host from Scotland and Poland (Mulenko et al. 2008, Farr & Rossman 2012).\n\nDiaporthe sojae Lehman, Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 10: 128. 1923\n\n≡ Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae (Lehman) Wehm., The genus Diaporthe Nitschke and its segregates 47: 1933.\n\n= Phomopsis longicolla Hobbs, Mycologia 77: 542. 1985.\n\n≡ Diaporthe longicolla (Hobbs) J.M. Santos, Vrandečić & A.J.L. Phillips, Persoonia 27: 13. 2011.\n\nSpecimens examined. Croatia, on Glycine max stem, Sept. 2005, K. Vrandečić (specimen CBS H-20460, culture CBS 127267). – Italy, Bologna, from Glycine soja, 1986, P. Giunchi (specimen CBS H-16776, culture CBS 100.87). – Unknown, on Glycine soja (‘Blackhawk’) mature stem, A.A. Hildebrand (CBS 180.55 = ATCC 12050 = CECT 2024). – USA, Mississippi, from Euphorbia nutans, A. Mengistu (CBS 116017 = DP 0508) and from Glycine max, Oct. 2003, A. Mengistu (CBS 116023); on Glycine soja seedling, J. Marcinkowska (CBS 659.78 = NRRL 13656).\n\nNotes — Isolates of D. phaseolorum var. sojae clustered in two distincts clades (clade 1, D. sojae; clade 7, D. melonis). Diaporthe sojae causes pod and stem blight of soybean, while P. longicolla is known to cause seed decay (Santos et al. 2011). Several authors have found it difficult to distinguish them based on disease symptoms alone, and usually report them together (Almeida & Seixas 2010). Hobbs et al. (1985) described P. longicolla as a different species to D. sojae (Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae) based on morphological characters. Both symptom types, however, have also been linked to the same species (Kulik 1984, Morgan-Jones 1989, Kulik & Sinclair 1999). Considering their genetic similarity based on the five genes studied here, disease etiology and common host, it appears that these isolates belong to the same species, which is distinct from D. phaseolorum (clade 4). Diaporthe sojae (clade 1) is an older name than D. longicolla, and is therefore applied to this clade.\n\nDiaporthe sp. 1\n\nSpecimens examined. Brazil, EMBRAPA/PR, on Glycine max seed, A. Almeida (LGMF 947 = CPC 20323). – Germany, Bielefeld, human abscess, K. Plechulla (CBS 119639 = B 11861).\n\nNotes — Isolates from clade 2 appear to represent a novel species, Diaporthe sp. 1 (sterile). It is represented by CBS 119639, isolated from an abscess of a male patient in Germany, and isolate LGMF 947, obtained from soybean seeds in Brazil. Isolates from this clade share a low genetic homology to isolates of the clade 4 (D. phaseolorum; , part 1).\n\nDiaporthe species commonly described from soybean were also reported as opportunistic human pathogens. In 1999, a species of Phomopsis was reported as etiological agent of a subcutaneous infection on the finger of an immunosuppressed farmer and this genus was added to the list of fungi capable to cause human disease (Sutton et al. 1999). In 2011, D. sojae (as Phomopsis longicolla), a known pathogen of soybean, was identified as causing skin infection in an immunocompromised patient after kidney transplantation. The authors believed that this patient acquired the fungus at least 5 yr before, when he had contact with seeds or soybean plants in Equatorial Guinea (Garcia-Reyne et al. 2011).\n\nAnother phytopathogenic species also described in soybean, Diaporthe phaseolorum, was reported causing osteomyelitis in patients with positive serology for human lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), disturbing the immune response. The patient was a farmer and inoculation occurred possibly through injury with Amaranthus spinosus thorns (Iriart et al. 2011).\n\nDiaporthe sp. 2\n\nSpecimen examined. Brazil, on petiole of Maytenus ilicifolia, July 2007, R.R. Gomes (LGMF 932 = CPC 20308).\n\nNotes — Sterile, endophytic isolate from medicinal plant in Brazil, which appears to represent a novel species (clade 29).\n\nDiaporthe sp. 3\n\nSpecimen examined. Scotland, on Pseudotsuga menziesii, Mar. 1929, G.G. Hahn (CBS 287.29).\n\nNotes — Clade 32 was tentatively named Diaporthe sp. 3, and is represented by a single isolate previously identified as Phomopsis conorum, and obtained from Pseudotsuga menziesii in Scotland. This clade was not resolved, because there are at least eight different conifer species without any ex-type cultures (Udayanga et al. 2011).\n\nDiaporthe sp. 4\n\nSpecimen examined. Brazil, endophytic in petiole on Maytenus ilicifolia, July 2007, R.R. Gomes (LGMF 944 = CPC 20320).\n\nNotes — Sterile endophytic isolate (clade 33) from a medicinal plant in Brazil, appearing to represent an undescribed species.\n\nDiaporthe sp. 5\n\nSpecimen examined. Italy, from Acer opalus, W. Jaklitsch (CBS 125575).\n\nNotes — This isolate (clade 37) represents a novel species occurring on Acer, which will be treated separately as part of another study (W. Jaklitsch, pers comm.).\n\nDiaporthe sp. 6\n\nSpecimens examined. Hong Kong, University Drive, on fruit of Maesa perlarius, 18 Dec. 2000, K.D. Hyde (CBS 115595 = HKUCC 10129, CBS 115584 = HKUCC 7784).\n\nNotes — The two strains (clade 85) studied here were originally identified as P. pittospori (described from Pittosporum twigs, USA, California), which seems highly unlikely, as they were isolated from fruit of Maesa perlarius in Hong Kong. Unfortunately both strains proved to be sterile, so their identity could not be confirmed.\n\nDiaporthe sp. 7\n\nSpecimen examined. India, Bangalore, on Anacardium occidentale, Aug. 1978, H.C. Govindu (CBS 458.78).\n\nNotes — The identity of the present isolate (identified as Phomopsis anacardii) could not be confirmed, as the culture proved to be sterile. However, phylogenetically (clade 88) it represents a distinct taxon from D. anacardii (clade 69), and when recollected, should be described as new.\n\nDiaporthe sp. 8\n\nSpecimen examined. Brazil, from Aspidosperma tomentosum, K. Rodriguez (LGMF 925 = CPC 20301).\n\nCulture characteristics — Colonies covering dish after 2 wk in the dark at 25 °C, with moderate aerial mycelium. On PDA surface ochreous, reverse pale luteous. On OA surface and reverse luteous. On MEA surface pale luteous, reverse orange to apricot.\n\nNotes — Although this isolate (clade 90) appears to represent an undescribed species based on phylogenetic data, it proved to be sterile. As we presently only have a single strain of this taxon, its treatment will have to await further collections.\n\nDiaporthe stictica (Berk. & Broome) R.R. Gomes, C.
