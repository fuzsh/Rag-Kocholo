        "text": "Automation in warehouses\n\nBohumil Tejnicky, VertiFlex\n\nBoth people and machines have their limits and we are currently very close to those limits. In intralogistics, automation is the muscle that must be controlled by the brain in the form of software and together they make life easier for a human. Mechanically, machines are close to perfection, but it is only when they are used properly that they can achieve unforeseen possibilities. Let's look at specific cases of how machines and humans can be helped by artificial intelligence in intralogistics.\n\nAt VertiFlex, we enjoy finding new and smart solutions that help maximize the performance of machines and people. Let us take a little look back in time. In 1995, my colleague, Pavel Kraus, brought elevator technology to the Czech Republic. Ten years later, we made the first pick-to-light installation linked to a higher-level warehouse management system (WMS). In 2015, another ten years later, the use of automated technology is changing to primarily picking technology. Two years ago, VertiFlex installed a vertical stacker with a double lift. Since last year, the WMS has been using artificial intelligence, thanks to our VertiNode Ai software. Our ambition is to make the Czech Republic an innovative leader in automated intralogistics.\n\nFrom the projects we have implemented, we can see that the demand for smart solutions that bring high added value is growing rapidly. Installations of vertical stackers with double lift technology, so-called Twin, or double lift and double shelf depth, so-called Double, significantly outperform traditional vertical stackers with a single lift. The twin technology allows two shelves to be transported at the same time, which helps to pick items faster. While picking is in progress from the first shelf, the Compact Twin will load the next shelf according to the pick list and place that shelf in a waiting position on the available space in the lift. When the first pick from the pick list is confirmed, the shelf is moved back to the lift, the second shelf is moved directly from the waiting position and the next pick from the order pick list is started. In addition, the bottom position of the lift is located below the drive and therefore reaches the ground. It is therefore possible to increase the capacity of the vertical stacker by a further 5% compared to other solutions.\n\nDouble stacker technology goes even further and offers more storage capacity in a limited space thanks to its double depth. Compared to conventional vertical stackers, this solution offers 200% of storage capacity in only 160% of the footprint of the machine. The automation possibilities are far from over. Combining vertical stackers with highly efficient conveyors creates a unique synergistic Dynamic technology that provides superior and efficient handling of goods while delivering high reliability. Compact Dynamic is a fully automated man-to-man goods transport solution that enables the handling of different plastic box variants. Advantages include fast installation and the ability to develop and expand the technology on the fly. In the event of service interventions, only the specific module is disconnected.\n\nThe machine is the muscle that helps the person to do the work. Our VertiNode Ai software solution develops the capabilities of the stand even further. By using artificial intelligence, it is possible to efficiently defragment stock, dividing the automated warehouse into individual zones with different turnover rates. The software enables automatic continuous scoring of items according to historical data on material movements while maintaining a sufficient buffer in each zone to target the storage of material on receipt. During night downtime, the system automatically defragments items based on available data and prepares items for first picking.\n\nArtificial intelligence in the warehouse space performs performance defragmentation of the stackers and plans the placement of material in each stacker to ensure that each stacker is evenly loaded and performs in a balanced manner. The system performs automatic ABC analysis and suggests the placement of goods throughout the system for maximum performance and highest picking efficiency. Order picking is expedited by features such as order grouping for fastest throughput, estimating order completion time, shelf pre-picking, or pre-picking based on traffic estimates from historical data.\n\nThe AI system also helps reduce errors when picking materials or goods with features such as weight checking, where the system does not need to know the weight in advance but learns as it is used. Artificial intelligence is also able to warn of suspicious operations and alert the operator to possible errors. During picking, the system also uses visual guidance for faster picking - checking positions and alerting on the correct location of the item, photographing material by location. When the number of operators is higher, the automatic checking is performed using wristbands, colour identification, etc.\n\nControl and evaluation are important for performance evaluation and as a source of data for the learning process of the AI system itself. The collected data and statistics serve as information for the management of machine and operator performance, alerting them to the need for service interventions in case of fluctuating machine performance. The data provides an overview of the amount of work performed and can create an estimate of future workload and help evaluate the time performance series.\n\nA major advantage of the VertiNode Ai software solution is its open API, which is compatible with a range of systems and makes it easy to deploy in a corporate environment. Over the past two years, we have also become convinced of the need for disinfection in the workplace. One of the options is the built-in automatic ozone disinfection of stored material and the entire vertical stacker area.\n\nIt is not only functionality that makes a man alive! We also offer the option of individual design of the outer cladding, whether the reason is work safety and uniform colouring of the machinery or the use of the stackers, for example, directly in the area of the business unit or simply the desire for a friendly working environment for warehouse employees.\n\nOne of our implementations that incorporates almost all of the above is the delivery of four Compact Twin vertical stackers to Madal Bal in ZlÃ­n. For Madal Bal, which specialises in online sales, the stackers were supplied with a bespoke cladding in the client's corporate design. The vertical stackers work together via VertiNode Ai software. VertiNode Ai is also linked to the warehouse management system (WMS). The loading of goods and their subsequent picking is thus managed using artificial intelligence (Ai), which optimises the maximum capacity utilisation of each stacker over time based on data from the WMS system.\n\nThe vertical stackers are complemented by a picking rack working on the principle of Pick-to-Light technology. Colour-coded confirmation buttons and colour selection allow multiple operators to work simultaneously in the picking zone. This system allows for an increase in the number of picked orders.\n\nVertiFlex strengthens its position as a logistics solutions integrator and establishes a strategic partnership with Geek+\n\nAutomation in logistics has been a frequently discussed topic in recent years and there are many opinions on its deployment across industries. However, companies today don't just see automation of internal logistics processes as a tool for increased operational efficiency or operational cost savings in this area. More and more companies see automation and robotics in warehouses as a solution to the lack of staff for manual operations in the future.\n\nVertiFlex is a very dynamically developing purely Czech company and specializes in the integration of logistics technologies with an emphasis on automation of operations. VertiFlex stands on three basic pillars. The first pillar is the company philosophy and a team of people who have many years of pan-European experience in warehouse automation and intralogistics. The second pillar is its own unique VertiNode Ai software for automated logistics, built on the latest artificial intelligence technologies. The third pillar is strategic partnerships with the leading logistics automation vendors.\n\nAnd it is in this area that VertiFlex has strengthened its position as a logistics solutions integrator and established a new strategic partnership with Geek+, a leading supplier of robotic technology for logistics. This move will strengthen Vertiflex's position in the rapidly expanding automated logistics solutions sector, particularly in the area of robotics. The new partnership will bring more opportunities to design suitable automation solutions and their ideal integration into an efficient logistics unit with a promising return on investment.\n\nâThere are a number of manufacturers and suppliers on the market in the field of automation of logistics operations. Our goal is not to offer everything. Our goal is to bring the customer a maximally efficient system with high added value of functional integration into a single unit where operations are coordinated by a sophisticated artificial intelligence softwareâ, says Managing Partner of VertiFlex, Bohumil Tejnicky.\n\nVertiFlex will work with Geek+, as well as other partners, on logistics solutions for a wide range of industries from manufacturing to e-commerce, with an emphasis on optimizing warehouse management, increasing efficiency and reducing operational costs.\n\nAccording to VertiFlex CEO, Pavel Kraus, this partnership is an important step for both companies. VertiFlex strengthens its market position and becomes a major player in the robotic warehouse systems market. Geek+ gains a strong and dynamically growing partner in the Central European region with excellent capabilities in the integration and implementation of complex logistics solutions. The partnership will bring new opportunities for innovative solutions for customers looking to improve their logistics processes and increase the efficiency of their warehouse operations."
