        "meta_description": "Abstract. A multi-rotor drone has been adapted for studies of volcanic gas plumes. This adaptation includes improved capacity for high-altitude and long-range, real-time SO2 concentration monitoring, long-range manual control, remotely activated bag sampling and plume speed measurement\ncapability. The drone is capable of acting as a stable platform for various instrument configurations, including multi-component gas analysis system (MultiGAS) instruments for in situ\nmeasurements of SO2, H2S, and CO2 concentrations in the gas plume and portable differential optical absorption spectrometer (MobileDOAS) instruments for spectroscopic\nmeasurement of total SO2 emission rate, remotely controlled gas sampling in bags and sampling with gas denuders for posterior analysis on\nthe ground of isotopic composition and halogens. The platform we present was field-tested during three campaigns in Papua New Guinea: in 2016 at Tavurvur, Bagana and Ulawun volcanoes, in 2018\nat Tavurvur and Langila volcanoes and in 2019 at Tavurvur and Manam volcanoes, as well as in Mt. Etna in Italy in 2017. This paper describes the drone platform and the multiple payloads, the various measurement strategies and an algorithm to correct for different\nresponse times of MultiGAS sensors. Specifically, we emphasize the need for an adaptive flight path, together with live data transmission of a plume\ntracer (such as SO2 concentration) to the ground station, to ensure optimal plume interception when operating beyond the visual line of\nsight. We present results from a comprehensive plume characterization obtained during a field deployment at Manam volcano in May 2019. The Papua New\nGuinea region, and particularly Manam volcano, has not been extensively studied for volcanic gases due to its remote location, inaccessible summit\nregion and high level of volcanic activity. We demonstrate that the combination of a multi-rotor drone with modular payloads is a versatile solution to\nobtain the flux and composition of volcanic plumes, even for the case of a highly active volcano with a high-altitude plume such as\nManam. Drone-based measurements offer a valuable solution to volcano research and monitoring applications and provide an alternative and\ncomplementary method to ground-based and direct sampling of volcanic gases.",

        "text": "1.1âThe use of drones for studies of volcanic plumes\n\nThe use of drones for volcanic plume studies was pioneered by Faivre-Pierret et al.Â (1980), who employed a fixed-wing drone equipped with in situ sensors to measure the composition of the volcanic plume of Mt. Etna, together with correlation-spectrometry-derived (COSPEC; Stoiber etÂ al., 1983) fluxes of H2O, SO2, HCl and HF. This was an unmanned research aircraft that demanded high expertise and complex field operations. More recently, McGonigle et al.Â (2008) employed an unmanned helicopter equipped alternatively with a multi-component gas analysis system (MultiGAS; Aiuppa etÂ al., 2005; Shinohara, 2005) and a portable differential optical absorption spectrometer (MobileDOAS; Galle etÂ al., 2003) system to measure the flux of CO2 and SO2 from the crater rim of Vulcano Island, Italy. This was a proof-of-concept study that demonstrated the utility of a commercial system to acquire proximal measurements, although the vehicle still required a level of piloting expertise. The first use of a multi-rotor platform capable of reaching a high-elevation plume was reported by Mori et al.Â (2016), who performed measurements with a multi-rotor drone in the eruptive plume of Ontake volcano and measured SO2, CO2, H2S, H2O and HCl concentrations, employing a combination of MultiGAS and MobileDOAS instruments. The authors reported various problems, such as the need to properly shield electrochemical sensors used in MultiGAS units from electromagnetic interference derived from the drone motors or radio telemetry. Similar work was conducted by RÃ¼diger et al.Â (2018), who measured the plumes of Masaya, Stromboli and Turrialba volcanoes and studied the ageing of halogenic species using drone-mounted denuder samplers. De Moor et al.Â (2019) and Stix et al.Â (2018) used a multi-rotor drone to perform MultiGAS and MobileDOAS measurements and to collect plume samples for posterior carbon isotopic speciation analyses. They also measured plume speed by letting the drone drift freely with the winds at plume level. Mandon et al.Â (2019) also used a multi-rotor drone and a sampling unit to collect high-temperature filter pack samples of volcanic gases at White Island volcano, which were characterized geochemically, focusing on the composition of trace metal aerosols. At Villarrica, comparison of the plume chemistry measured directly above the lava lake (using a drone-mounted gas analyser) and downwind on the crater rim (using a traditional ground-based instrument) simultaneously showed how volcanic plumes can dilute and homogenize over short distances ofÂ <â150âm, especially in turbulent crater environments (Liu etÂ al., 2019). Furthermore, Schellenberg et al.Â (2019) described in-plume ash collection at long range using fixed-wing vehicles at Fuego volcano (Guatemala), and Syahbana et al.Â (2019) launched a fixed-wing aircraft with sensors for H2O, CO2 and SO2 that were essential for a successful assessment of eruptive activity of Mt. Agung in 2017. This short account is intended to highlight representative studies using drones as platforms for volcanic plume measurements; more comprehensive reviews, including the broader applications of drones in volcanology, can be found in Villa et al.Â (2016) or James et al.Â (2020).\n\nThe above-mentioned studies show different aspects of the capabilities of drones to reach volcanic plumes and vents and perform measurements with various levels of complexity. Our study combines multiple aspects of these independent developments to show that the same unit can be used to achieve the above-mentioned goals in a single field experiment, with maximum field operability in terms of portability and a reduced number of people required for the measurement, i.e. usually only two. These features make our approach a practical solution to expand the use of drones for routine monitoring of volcanic plumes.\n\n2.3âMobileDOAS for remote measurement of SO2 emission rate\n\nSince 2002 an instrument referred to as MobileDOAS (Galle etÂ al., 2003; Johansson, 2009) has been used increasingly to replace the previously used COSPEC instrument (Stoiber etÂ al., 1983) for measurements of volcanic SO2 gas emission rate. Both MobileDOAS and COSPEC instruments use the diffused UV solar radiation as a light source for the determination of the total column of SO2 above the instrument, which is calculated using absorption spectroscopy. During a typical measurement, the instrument is moved in such a way that it passes under the gas plume in a direction close to perpendicular to the plume transport direction while simultaneously recording spectra and GPS location. Thus, by correcting for deviations from traversing the plume perpendicularly using GPS data and using DOAS evaluation algorithms to derive SO2 total columns along the track, the total number of SO2 molecules in a cross-section of the gas plume can be derived. This quantity is then multiplied by wind speed at the centre of mass of the plumeÂ â i.e. plume speedÂ â to derive the gas emission rate.\n\nThe main sources of error in these measurements are âdilutionâ of the absorption signal due to simultaneous collection of skylight that has been either transmitted through the plume or scattered from outside of the plume (MillÃ¡n, 1980; Mori et al., 2006) and limited knowledge of the plume speed (Galle etÂ al., 2010).\n\nMobileDOAS measurements from a drone platform offer several advantages compared to traditional approaches (e.g. RÃ¼diger etÂ al., 2018; De Moor etÂ al., 2019): regardless of infrastructure (roads) and topography, traverses can be made in a direction perpendicular to the plume direction. Measurements can be made at an elevated altitude, thus reducing the effects of light dilution, and plume speed can be determined reasonably accurately by the methods described in Sect.Â 2.2.\n\nGeneral details of the MobileDOAS hard- and software are given in Johansson et al.Â (2009). Details specific to our drone-mountable version of the instrument are provided in TableÂ A1 (AppendixÂ A). A schematic view of the MobileDOAS instrument is shown in Fig.Â 3.\n\nDownload\n\nThe MobileDOAS instrument is built into a plastic case with clamps adapted to a platform on the drone in a balanced position, and it is powered from a 12/5âV power cable from the drone that was permanently active. Thus, the MobileDOAS could be installed on the drone platform, and the MobileDOAS software could be started up, or data from the MobileDOAS could be backed up, without the main drone power turned on, thereby saving battery power. While the MobileDOAS software is active, a stream of basic information (time, position, SO2 column density) is transmitted in real time via an independent radio link from the instrument. These real-time data help the pilot to guide the drone and ensure a complete traverse of the plume. The full traverse can be visualized upon landing, by connecting an external computer to the instrument computer running MobileDOAS.\n\n2.4âMultiGAS for in situ measurement of gas composition\n\nMobileDOAS and ScanDOAS are used to obtain SO2Â â and under some circumstances also BrO (LÃ¼bcke etÂ al., 2014)Â â emission rates from the ground using remote-sensing techniques. However, to obtain the relative concentrations of other volcanic species, such as CO2 and H2S, direct measurements must be conducted within the plume itself; high atmospheric background concentrations or weak optical absorption of these species preclude robust detection by remote-sensing methods. The most common method used for this is multi-component gas analyser systems (MultiGAS; Aiuppa etÂ al., 2005; Shinohara, 2005). MultiGAS-type instruments generally consist of several small sensors (typically electrochemical or optical), with low power consumption, connected to a micro-computer and sometimes a data link for real-time data transfer. The instrument is typically installed in a gas-exposed location (e.g. a crater rim), often proximal to the vent location. Although its installation may be labour-intensive and sometimes risky, this method is generally straightforward. However, on many volcanoes, approaching the summit area would represent an enormous riskÂ â this is the situation at Manam. In such cases, performing the in-plume measurements using a drone is an attractive possibility. An obvious requirement here is the ability of the drone to reach high altitude as well as having long endurance. This is emphasized further by the fact that many of the sensors used have slow response times, while the gas concentrations (especially close to the vent where the signal is stronger) may vary quickly within seconds due to dilution and turbulent wind conditions. Under these conditions, it is preferable to expose the sensors to the volcanic gas for as long a sampling duration as possibleÂ â ideally at least several minutes. Short time fluctuations in concentration and plume location also imply that the ability to monitor a gas tracer (such as SO2) in real time is desirable to âchaseâ high-concentration sites. This is of course not guaranteed when the drone is sent in autopilot, unless an adaptive flight routine based on a plume tracer is implemented.\n\nMultiGAS units combine information from different sensors to determine the mixing ratios of different species. In our present system, these quantities are determined according to the following processes:\n\nFor SO2 and H2S. The target gas is pumped into a chamber to which the electrochemical sensors are exposed. The signal generated by the electrochemical effect from an electrode exposed to the gas of interest is subtracted from the signal of a reference electrode inside the system This differential signal is proportional to the gas mixing ratio. The proportionality is linear within a certain range and depends to some degree on temperature, pressure and the concentration of interfering species. These proportionality and disturbance factors are determined by calibration.\n\nFor CO2.\n\nThe same gas sample is passed through a cavity illuminated by two infrared beams with wavelengths centred in and out of an absorption band of CO2.\n\nUsing BeerâLambert's extinction law, the local concentration of CO2 is determined.\n\nTo get the mixing ratio, further corrections are needed for temperature, pressure and relative humidity, which should be established by calibration.\n\nDownload\n\nFor the case of H2O, the mixing ratio can be derived from measured relative humidity, pressure and temperature, following known thermodynamic laws (see AppendixÂ B). If the measurement of such variables is done inside the sampling circuit, the H2O mixing ratio of the sample can be determined simultaneously to the other species. Our system, however, measures these variables only inside the instrument box, so the mixing ratio is representative of ambient gas passively diffusing in the interior of the unit; H2O therefore varies differently than the other species as it is determined from outside of the closed system. The schematic layout of the MultiGAS instrument used in this study is shown in Fig.Â 4, and technical specifications of the sensors are given in AppendixÂ A.\n\nData from this unit are transmitted through an independent data link and visualized on the ground using self-developed software used for tracking emissions from ships (Beecken etÂ al., 2015; Mellqvist etÂ al., 2018). This visualization is the basis to fine-tune the position of the drone for the sampling of more concentrated regions of the plume.\n\nTo obtain the mixing ratios representative of the volcanic emission, it is necessary to correct for the contribution from the same species present in the background atmosphere. Ideally, such a measurement should be done at similar ambient conditions (i.e. pressures, temperature) to those expected inside the plume, unless the corrections for different conditions are known precisely.\n\nWhen two sensors have different response time characteristics, the signals they measure will have different amplitude and shape and be time-shifted with respect to the input signals depending on the frequency content of the input. This âdistortionâ of the input signals can be large when a rapidly fluctuating signal is measured for a short time; i.e. the instrument basically records only the transient signal. This could be the case with MultiGAS measurements on a flying drone in a turbulent plume. These effects must be considered to reproduce the input signal and subsequently analyse it (for example, taking the ratio of two signals such as CO2/SO2 ).\n\nHowever, if only the ratio of the signals, and not their instantaneous amplitudes, is sought, it is enough that the dynamic constants are similar. Alternatively, the true amplitudes may be obtained if the input signals have variations in timescales longer than the characteristic response times of the sensors, and the measurement is taken for a time longer than the response time of the sensor. This can be achieved in two ways, either by selecting carefully the characteristics of the sensors or by exposing them to a near-constant signal. To achieve the latter, a practical solution is to take a sample of the gas and then expose the sensors to the sampled gas for a time long enough to achieve the correct amplitudes. Our system fulfils these two criteria: the sensors have similar response characteristics, and the MultiGAS incorporates a bag and pump unit that makes it possible to take samples of the plume and then expose it to the sensors for several minutes i.e. on the ground (see Sect.Â 2.5). In this mode the gas from the Teflon bag is circulated through the detectors in a closed loop, thereby exposing the detectors for the constant gas concentration in the sample for several minutes. Another advantage here is that any possible losses, i.e. wall effects, could be monitored and compensated for. This method was however not tested in the actual field campaign because the limited gas samples were instead used for isotopic composition analyses.\n\nA detailed analysis of the problems encountered when combining data from sensors with different response times is given in the following section.\n\n2.4.1âCorrection of time-response differences in MultiGAS sensors\n\nWhen measurements are made with combined data from several sensors having a different response time, e.g. measurements of the ratio CO2/SO2 using a MultiGAS instrument, great care must be taken.\n\nIn this measurement procedure, three characteristic times are important:\n\nthe time of variability in gas concentration, tv;\n\nthe sampling time, ts;\n\nthe response time of the sensor, t90 (meaning the time to reach 90â% of the true signal for a step change in concentration, higher than the detection limit).\n\nThe first characteristic is determined by variability in emission, variability caused by local turbulence at the point of measurement and variability caused by relative transit of the drone with respect to the plume. The second characteristic is determined by the sampling rate of the instrument and the time required for exchange of the gas sample inside the measurement cavity. By the third characteristic, we mean the dynamic response time of the sensor. Because sensors often operate according to different principles, the sensor response times are usually different; this may introduce artefacts in the mixing ratios, which would then result in wrong molar ratios for the different species, as discussed by Aiuppa etÂ al.Â (2005), Shinohara (2005), Roberts etÂ al.Â (2017) and Liu etÂ al.Â (2019).\n\nDrone MultiGAS measurements are normally performed by hovering in a region of high gas concentration. This means that the relative motion of gas parcels is mostly determined by local turbulence. Farther away from active vents, concentration heterogeneities are largely smoothed out, but the signal is very weak. Therefore, strong signals are usually subject to high variability.\n\nOur MultiGAS intakes a flow of 0.5âLâminâ1 (â¼â10â5âm3âsâ1), which means that for a measurement cell section of â¼â10âcm2, the flow speed is in the order of 0.01âmâsâ1. This results in a negligible dynamic pressure in relation to atmospheric pressure inside the measurement cavity. The relation between the sampling and variability time is determined by the Nyquist criterion. The instrument would only be able to capture signals with frequency fluctuations lower than half the sampling frequency accurately (in practice, a much higher sampling frequency is required). Our MultiGAS takes a sample every second, so variations with frequencies higher than 0.5âHz cannot be properly captured. Such dynamic changes in plume composition are assumed to be improbable for most typical scenarios. The CO2 sensor has a cavity with dimensions of 153âmmâÃâ30âmmâÃâ36âmm; i.e. the sampling volume of 0.17âL is exchanged in a time of about 20âs. For the electrochemical sensors, the response time depends on the transport through the membrane, dissolution in the electrolyte, reaction time and sampling. Thus, differences in sensor geometry and measurement principle produce differences in response times, even if the gas flow rate remains constant (i.e. with the same pump).\n\nThe response time depends on the dynamic properties of the sensor and the nature of the signal. For first-order sensors, only one energy-storing and one energy-dissipating component dominate, and oscillatory behaviours are neglected. For such sensors, the dynamical response can be modelled through the differential equation (e.g. Pallas-Areny and Webster, 1991):\n\n(1) x ( t ) = a 0 y ( t ) + a 1 d y ( t ) d t ,\n\nwhere x(t) is the time-varying input signal (e.g. mixing ratio of SO2), y(t) is the time-varying measured signal (e.g. voltage of the SO2 electrochemical sensor), dy/dt is the first derivative of the measured signal with respect to time, and a0 and a1 are constants identified with the response time (Ïâ=âa1/a0 ) and static sensitivity of the sensor (K=1/a0 ).\n\nThe dynamical time-response factor defines a delay in the response of the measured signal in relation to the input signal. If the input signal is a step function, one usually relates this factor by the time required for the sensor to achieve a certain level of the signal, for example 90â%. Periodical signals will be affected by an error in amplitude and by a shift caused by the frequency response of the sensor. The steady-state amplitude response to a signal of angular frequencyÂ Ï is given by k/[(ÏÏ)2+)]0.5 . The shift is given by tanââ1(ÏÏ). An arbitrary signal can be represented by a Fourier sum of periodical signals, and for linear systems, the response of the sensor is obtained by superposition of the responses to the monochromatic signals (Pallas-Areny and Webster, 1991).\n\nWe correct our signals based on these conditions:\n\nSensors of the MultiGAS instrument can be accurately modelled as first-order systems.\n\nThe input signals of different sensors measured at the same time are highly correlated.\n\nVariability of the gas concentration occurs at a characteristic time much shorter than the exchange time in the sensor.\n\nThe total measurement time is much larger than the exchange/diffusion time in the sensor.\n\nThe first assumption is supported by the design and laboratory characterization of the electrochemical and optical sensors. The second assumption requires that the molar ratio of different species is constant and homogeneous within the time of measurement. Sampling a heterogeneous mixture would produce different ratios at different times, complicating both the measurement and the interpretation of the results. In volcanic emissions, drastic changes in molar ratios within minutes are unlikely if the gases come from the same source. But if the plume mixes emissions from different vents, or if large local heterogeneities affect the chemistry or condensation of different species unequally (e.g. for plumes with heterogeneous concentration of ash), changes in gas molar ratios can occur, even on short timescales (Kelly etÂ al., 2013). The third condition ensures that enough information is available for finding a unique solution because the high variability in the signal is required for the cross-correlation analysis, and the fourth condition is required to reduce the error caused by sampling over different exchange/diffusion times of the sensors.\n\nDownload\n\nBased on the first assumption, our method starts with the two measured signals (e.g. yCO2(t) and ySO2(t) ) and constructs from them their derivatives (dyCO2(t)/dt and dySO2(t)/dt ) by simple numerical approximation, which works fine as long as the sampling time is short (i.e. as long as large variability in timescales shorter than the sampling rate is not expected). Based on the second assumption, we expect that a simple scaling exists between the two input signals, defining a constant ratioÂ r (râ=âxCO2(t)/xSO2(t) ). Now we simply iteratively vary the time-response factors of the two signals and look for the combination that maximizes the cross-correlation between the reproduced inputs according to Eq.Â (1) (see AppendixÂ B for an implementation of this method). This method works best for strongly fluctuating signals, rich in information for the correlation analysis. FigureÂ 5 shows an example of this method applied to field measurements of a very dynamical signal obtained in the crater of Tavurvur volcano (Papua New Guinea) in 2016 using the Sunkist instrument.\n\nThis method is quite general for the correction of the dynamic response of the sensors. It obviates time-consuming and frequent characterization of the response time in a laboratory and accounts for the fact that the sensors may change their dynamic characteristics when exposed to different conditions in the field, relative to the lab. Of course, calibration is still desirable to check for possible changes in offset and sensitivity of the sensor over time.\n\n2.5âBag sampling unit for gas composition and isotopic analysis\n\nIn some cases, real-time measurements in the gas plume are not possible, either because longer measurement time is needed to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio or because the measurement requires an analytical technique that is more complex than can be performed in situ on a drone platform. In such cases, acquiring a sample of the plume gas using a drone carrying a sample bag and a pump may be a viable option. For successful sampling of the most concentrated region of the plume, real-time data transmission of a plume tracerÂ â such as SO2Â â to the drone operator on the ground (in combination with manual flight control to respond accordingly) is advantageous; however, this can be technically challenging, especially for long-range flights.\n\nMeasurement of the carbon isotope composition of volcanic CO2 is a key example of an application that requires in-plume sample collection. Carbon isotope analyses are performed using instrumentation such as isotope ratio mass (IRMS) spectrometers (Chiodini etÂ al., 2011; Sharp, 2007), bench-top infrared spectroscopic analyses (Fischer and Lopez, 2016; Rizzo etÂ al., 2014; van Geldern etÂ al., 2014) or cavity ring down spectroscopy (Lucic etÂ al., 2015). While the bench-top spectroscopic techniques are much more portable than IRMS systems and do not require a vacuum, they still depend on a stable 110 or 220âV power source and pressurized calibration and dilution gasesÂ â facilities that are not always available in remote field locations. The spectroscopic techniques generally require a sample volume of about 300âmL at atmospheric pressure and temperature. This can be accomplished by directly placing the instrument in the volcanic plume (Rizzo etÂ al., 2014, 2015) or by collecting a plume or fumarole sample in an appropriately sealed and non-reactive container (i.e. Tedlar sample bags) for subsequent analyses by spectroscopy (Fischer and Lopez, 2016). The application of drones for this purpose is advantageous over the use of helicopters due to the lower operational cost and smaller scale logistics, as well as avoiding sample contamination by gases present in the helicopter exhaust (Fischer and Lopez, 2016).\n\nDuring our fieldwork at Manam volcano, we used two payloads to sample the plume. In the first, we equipped our drone with four Tedlar sampling bags. Each bag was connected to a small rotary pump triggered by a timer. The drone operator positioned the drone in the plume, at which point the sample was collected by a timed trigger. The duration of sample collection was approximately 45âs at an approximate flow rate of 1âLâminâ1. A valve system was not necessary because the pump also functioned as a valve once it stopped pumping. The second system was similar, but here the pump (at 0.5âLâminâ1) could be remotely controlled, and only one Tedlar bag was used. After return of the samples to the ground, the valves on the Tedlar bags were closed, and the samples were analysed by a Delta Ray infrared spectrometer. In addition to collecting samples from the plume, a clean air sample was collected upwind and at the same elevation as the plume. In principle, the analytical procedure followed that described in Fischer and Lopez (2016). Due to the remote location of Manam island and the difficulty encountered when obtaining calibration and CO2-free air gases in-country, we developed an air purification system that utilized a bicycle pump and CO2 scrubber, Sulfolimeâ¢, obtained from PP systems Inc., to produce pressurized CO2-free air. This system allowed the production of essentially unlimited amounts of CO2-free air with CO2 contents ofÂ <â0.7âppm, as measured using the Delta Ray. The calibration gas was pure CO2 obtained from a local distributor. Prior to analysis, the C isotope composition of this gas was not known, and we therefore collected a sample of this gas to analyse back in the Volatiles Laboratory at the University of New Mexico using the Delta Ray and standard calibration gases. Therefore, we were not able to determine the exact C isotope compositions of the samples in the field but were able to adjust the pure CO2 calibration gas to the concentration of CO2 measured in the bag sample by setting the corresponding CO2 concentration in the Delta Ray software. We then retroactively corrected all our measurements using the values obtained for the field calibration gas.\n\n2.6âPlume sampling of halogens using a denuder system\n\nBesides H2O, CO2 and SO2, halogens are among the major constituents of volcanic emissions (Textor etÂ al., 2004). The discovery of bromine monoxide (BrO) in volcanic plumes and the correlation of the simultaneously gained BrO/SO2 ratio with volcanic activity by automatized instruments (LÃ¼bcke etÂ al., 2014) made BrO/SO2 a promising volcano monitoring tool. To utilize BrO/SO2 ratios for monitoring volcanic activity, an understanding of ongoing bromine chemistry in the plume is essential. For a detailed discussion on bromine chemistry in volcanic plumes, see Gutmann et al.Â (2018) and references therein. Besides BrO, no other bromine species can be detected by remote-sensing instruments. Therefore in situ methods have been developed recently for the determination of reactive bromine (BrX) and hydrogen bromide (HBr) (RÃ¼diger etÂ al., 2017; Gutmann etÂ al., 2020, respectively). The new methods reveal the downwind conversion of released HBr to other bromine species with time in a volcanic plume.\n\nBromine speciation can be measured using gas diffusion denuder systems. Gaseous molecules are derivatized in situ by an organic coating at the inner walls when pumped through gas diffusion denuders. Analysis of bromine speciation has been carried out for two different bromine species. HBr has been determined by 5,6-epoxy-[1,10]-phenanthroline-coated denuders (Gutmann etÂ al., 2020), and BrX (such as Br2, BrCl, HOBr) and reactive chlorine species (ClX) were detected by 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene-coated denuders (RÃ¼diger etÂ al., 2017). Samples were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography or gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, at the University of Mainz, Germany, after returning from the field.\n\nFor the detection of SO2 a compact MultiGAS-type system called âSunkistâ (RÃ¼diger etÂ al., 2018) was used, which contained an electrochemical CiTiceL 3MST/F sensor. The calibration of the electrochemical SO2 sensor followed Arellano et al.Â (2017). The Sunkist also measures ambient pressure and temperature. Since the thermometer is inside the isolated box and is affected by running instruments, only temperatures at the beginning of the flight were considered. The temperature at the starting position was 26ââC for the first flight and 32ââC for the second. Assuming a vertical temperature gradient of â5âKâkmâ1 and an approximate flight height of 2000âm, 16 and 22ââC were estimated for calculations, respectively.\n\nDenuders were connected by PTFE tubes to a micro pump providing 200âmLâminâ1 for each denuder. Denuder sampling does not provide time-resolved samples and instead yields an average concentration for the whole exposure interval (i.e. an average per flight). Since results obtained with environmental denuders predict that these bromine species usually only appear within the volcanic plume, we calculate their plume concentrations based on the known duration of exposure in the plume as detected by the SO2 sensor. FigureÂ 6 shows a photo of the drone, with denuders and Sunkist, mounted on the drone and ready for take-off.\n\nDownload\n\nA blank correction for denuder results was performed by subtracting analysis results from coated denuders that travelled alongside samples but did not sample any air.\n\nBackground environmental blanks were sampled at the starting position of flights. For subtraction of background environmental blanks, the atmospheric concentration of samples (ppb) was calculated for the total flight time. After blank subtraction, the atmospheric concentration of the bromine species was calculated for the duration in the plume (estimated based on SO2 signals).\n\nLimits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were calculated via 3 and 10Â times deviation of the coated denuder blanks (n=3), respectively. LOD and LOQ are dependent on sampling time and the processing method in the laboratory and are, therefore, calculated for each sample separately.\n\n3.6âHalogen concentrations\n\nOn 27Â May 2019, we achieved two successful flights with the denuder system where detection of SO2 indicated that we had entered the plume. In both flights we detected SO2 in two positions, each at different altitudes, consistent with the observation of two source regions for summit emissions (Fig.Â 14). The maximum SO2 concentrations were 1.74 and 1.87âppm in flightÂ 1 and 1.22 and 4.62âppm in flightÂ 2 for peakÂ 1 andÂ 2, respectively. Detected SO2 concentrations were averaged for each time we entered the plume. SO2 concentration for each flight was averaged proportionally to the sampling duration in the plume (TableÂ 2).\n\nDownload\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nFor both denuder types, an environmental blank was sampled at the starting position on the ground. For HBr the denuder results were within the deviation of unsampled but coated denuders. For reactive bromine, the environmental blank values were the highest values of the whole campaign (BrX: 0.2âppb for 3âL sampling volume). In addition, the amount of reactive chlorine was higher than that of reactive bromine in this sample only (ClX: 0.4âppb for 3âL sampling volume). Therefore, we infer that this sample was either contaminated or the location in the grass close to the sea does not represent the atmospheric conditions encountered during the flight. Alternatively, we subtracted an environmental blank sampled 10âd earlier in a pre-campaign at Tavurvur volcano, at an altitude of 104âm upwind on the flank of the volcano and above barren volcanic rock (17Â May 2019, BrX: 0.002âppb, ClX: 0.000âppb). The result of the environmental blank of HBr was within the deviation of coated denuders not used for sample collection.\n\nAverage concentrations of all analysed bromine and chlorine species based on the duration of exposure in the plume and their calculated LOD and LOQ are given in TableÂ 2. Results were just below the LOD for both bromine species in flightÂ 1. Bromine results for flightÂ 2 were below the LOQ but above LOD. ClX was below LOD in both samples. The ratio of the bromine species to SO2 varies between the two flights from 30âÃâ104 to 44âÃâ104 for HBr/SO2 and 3âÃâ104 to 5âÃâ104 for BrX/SO2 from flightÂ 1 toÂ 2, respectively, while the ratio between the two bromine species BrX/HBr stays stable (flightÂ 1: 0.10, flightÂ 2: 0.12).\n\nAlthough measurement results were below the LOQ, we were able to detect HBr and BrX in the plume of Manam volcano with our two flights. The observed BrX/HBr ratio of 0.10â0.12 is relatively low compared to previous detected ratios of approximately 0.30 within the first minute in Masaya's plume (RÃ¼diger etÂ al., 2021). Observed bromine evolution in Manam plume seems to follow the trend for high Br/S ratios suggested by Roberts et al.Â (2014)."
