        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis large multicenter study verifies the AIR-score as a valid and reproducible instrument with high discriminating capacity especially for advanced appendicitis. It defines groups of patients with low, medium, and high probability of appendicitis with high sensitivity and specificity. A large proportion (47.5%) of the patients without appendicitis were assigned to the low risk group and 32.5% of all complicated appendicitis were assigned to the high risk group, showing its utility as basis for a safe risk-adapted management that can help in identifying patients in need of urgent surgical evaluation and minimising unproductive hospital admissions and abdominal explorations.\n\nThe clinical diagnosis and diagnostic imaging are the pillars in modern management of patients with suspicion of appendicitis, but the optimal management algorithm is still controversial. Routine imaging in unselected patients is not recommended because of the high frequency of false-positive and false-negative diagnosis in patients with low or high prevalence of appendicitis, respectively [3–5, 14]. Routine CT scanning in unselected patients with a mean prevalence of 32% will give an estimated PPV of only 70% [7]. Imaging will thus over diagnose appendicitis in patients with a low clinical probability and cannot rule out appendicitis in patients with high clinical probability. A meta-analysis of the cost-effectiveness of imaging strategies in children concluded that imaging is not cost-effective for patients with a risk of appendicitis <16% or >95% and that the imaging approach should be tailored on the basis of a patient’s pretest probability of appendicitis [15].\n\nMany algorithms propose a risk-differentiated strategy but do not specify how the risk can be determined or only give a general reference to “typical history and clinical findings”. Clinical scoring systems are instruments to determine the probability of appendicitis in the individual patient [16]. The AIR score is based on mainly objective inflammatory markers which may explain the high reproducibility of the score in different settings and irrespective of the experience of the examiner. The AIR score has been recommended in two recent reviews with a reference to its usability and diagnostic performance [16, 17]. It has been compared with the Alvarado score in 11 studies and performed better in 10 of them [1, 18–26]. It has been prospectively validated in patients with suspicion of appendicitis in 12 previous studies [1, 10, 18–21, 23, 26–30], in most cases with similar results to the present study.\n\nThe AIR score was designed with a focus on ruling out patients with complicated appendicitis from the low risk group. These patients can safely be observed as outpatients with planned repeat examination. The few cases with complicated appendicitis in this group (0.7%) were diagnosed at the repeat examination after observation. A large proportion of the patients can thus be saved the costs of further diagnostic workup or hospital admission. This may also allow some patients with mild appendicitis to resolve spontaneously with no treatment [31].\n\nAnother aim was to identify patients with high probability of appendicitis that need an urgent surgical evaluation and a probable abdominal exploration. Some 9.2% of the patients are classified as high probability with a prevalence of appendicitis of 84%, of which the majority had complicated appendicitis (66%). One-third of all patients with complicated appendicitis was assigned to this group. The PPV was very high in patients aged <15 years (96%) and in men (89%). This may motivate an abdominal exploration with no further diagnostic work-up as imaging cannot rule out appendicitis in patients with high probability of appendicitis and a differential diagnosis is less likely. In women and patients aged ≥40 years, a diagnostic imaging may however be indicated due to the lower PPV (84% and 83%, respectively).\n\nImaging can identify differential diagnoses which may need further treatment or work-up. This is more common in older patients. In the present study, one patient with alternative diagnosis needing surgery was diagnosed in the low probability group and two patients in the high probability group.\n\nMonitored in-hospital observation with repeat examination is the traditional management that has stand the test of time. In the intervention part of the STRAPPSCORE study, the patients with an intermediate AIR-score were randomised to early imaging or a period of observation followed by repeat scoring and selective imaging. We found no advantage of routine diagnostic imaging compared with observation and selective imaging [10].\n\nThe strength of the present study is its size and prospective, multicentre design, which verifies the validity of the AIR score in various settings and in the hands of physicians with varying experience. The score performed better in patients below age 15 years and in women, which are regarded as especially challenging. This support that the AIR score is applicable to all patients with suspected appendicitis irrespective of age or sex.\n\nA weakness is the missing values of which the proportion of neutrophils was the most frequent. This reflects the logistic difficulties when introducing new methods in emergency departments with involvement of many actors that are constantly changing over time. The reported estimates should however be valid with low probability of bias as we used multiple imputation [32].\n\nThe data were collected between 2009 and 2012. Some may question if these data are still valid. However, the criteria for the appendicitis diagnosis (transmural neutrophil invasion or imaging suggesting appendiceal abscess or phlegmon) has not changed since 2012. The seven variables used in the AIR-score are still all used routinely to the same extent as in 2012. There is no new laboratory examination reported that have replaced the variables included in the score. The association of the AIR-score with the appendicitis diagnosis have therefore not been influenced by the time that has passed. The sensitivity, specificity, and discriminating capacity for at least complicated appendicitis should be valid also today in all the subgroup analyses.\n\nHowever, the quality of diagnostic imaging has improved since 2012 and its usage has increased. As a consequence more cases of mild appendicitis that previously was allowed to resolve undiagnosed are now detected, as shown by an increasing incidence rate of uncomplicated appendicitis in recent decades. In the previous report of the randomised trial comparing immediate imaging with an observation period followed by selective imaging, we thus found more patients diagnosed with mild appendicitis in the imaging arm which may have resolved undiagnosed in the observation arm [10]. As we have followed up all cases, we can with confidence claim that we have not missed any patient needing treatment.\n\nThe effect of this could be a lower sensitivity for appendicitis at the low cut off. However, throughout the manuscript, we emphasise that the aim is to identify patients with complicated appendicitis with high sensitivity, whereas we do not aim at ruling out patients with mild appendicitis at the low cut-off point. We therefore suggest planned re-examination of the patients with low probability. We think this is certainly valid also in this era.\n\nThis large external validation of the AIR score verify the validity and replicability of the AIR score but shows a need to adjust the originally proposed cut-off point for the low probability. It performed especially well in children and women which are regarded as the most challenging groups for diagnosing appendicitis. The score can be used as a decision support for a risk-stratified management adapted to the probability of appendicitis. This may help minimising unproductive hospital admissions and abdominal explorations and in selection of patients for urgent surgical evaluation and diagnostic imaging."
