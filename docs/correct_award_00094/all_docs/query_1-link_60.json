        "text": "The Nobel Prize\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are awards that are given each year for special things that people or groups of people have achieved. They are awarded in six areas: physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace and economics.\n\nThe prizes come from a fund that was created by the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. He wanted to use some of his money to help make the world a better place to live.\n\nMany organizations, chosen by Alfred Nobel himself, determine who receives the prizes. Each award consists of a gold medal, a diploma and a lot of money. Prizes can only be given to individuals of all races, countries and religions. Only the Peace Prize can also be given to a group.\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were handed out on December 10, 1901 - five years after Alfred Nobel’s death. Nobel was a chemist, engineer and inventor whose most famous invention , dynamite, made him a rich man. Although he gave the world such a deadly weapon, Nobel was always against wars and violence. He therefore left a lot of money that was to go to those who did a lot for mankind.\n\nOfficials at first handed out only five prizes a year. The prize for economics was first awarded in 1969. In some years prizes have not been awarded because there were no worthy candidates\n\nAll prizes are presented in Stockholm, Sweden, only the Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway.\n\nFamous Nobel Prize Winners\n\nYear\n\nField\n\nWinner\n\nCountry\n\n1901\n\nPhysics\n\nWilhelm Röntgen\n\nGermany\n\n1921\n\nPhysics\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nGermany\n\n1945\n\nMedicine\n\nSir Alexander Fleming\n\nGreat Britain\n\n1954\n\nLiterature\n\nErnest Hemingway\n\nUSA\n\n1972\n\nLiterature\n\nHeinrich Böll\n\nGermany\n\n1973\n\nMedicine\n\nKonrad Lorenz\n\nAustria\n\n1977\n\nPeace\n\nAmnesty International\n\n-----------\n\n1993\n\nPeace\n\nNelson Mandela\n\nSouth Africa\n\nDownloadable PDF Text- and Worksheets\n\nText and Worksheets available at our shop\n\nRelated Topics"
