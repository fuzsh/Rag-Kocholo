The courage to stand up for one's beliefs; encouragement to meddle in public affairs; and unconditional activism in support of dignity and human rights were characteristics of the writer Heinrich Böll. The Foundation is committed to that tradition.\n\nWho was Heinrich Böll?\n\nWhat are his most important novels?\n\nHow did he go about his work?\n\nWas Böll an active member of a political party?\n\nHow formative was his time as a soldier in WW2?\n\nHow important was religion for him?\n\nWhy was Böll dubbed «the conscience of the nation»?\n\nHow and why did he champion human rights?\n\nWhere did Böll spend his life?\n\nWhy was Ireland so important to Böll?\n\nDid Böll address environmental concerns?\n\nWhy did Böll fight the tabloid «BILD»?\n\nWhy should Böll still be read?\n\nTimeline\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nPhoto credits and literature"
