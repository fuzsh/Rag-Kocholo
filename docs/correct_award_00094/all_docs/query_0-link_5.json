        "text": "STOCKHOLM, Oct. 19—The 1972 Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded today to Heinrich Boll for his contribution to “a renewal of German literature” in the postwar era.\n\nMr. Boll, a 54‐year‐old West German novelist, short‐story writer and playwright, was cited for the “sensitive skill” and “broad perspective” of his diverse works, dealing with the impact of war as well as Christianity's role in a bleak, despairing world. His recent stories include satirical thrusts at empty conventions of today.\n\n[Mr. Boll said in Athens, where he was visiting, that he would give part of the prize money to help jailed writers and their families. ]\n\nThe prize carries a cash award equivalent to about] $100,000. It will be formally, presented, along with other, Nobel prizes, on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death in 1896 of Alfred B. Nobel, the Swedish‐born inventor of dynamite, a bachelor who amassed a fortune.\n\nThe brief announcement was made this afternoon in the old section of Stockholm in a meeting room of the Swedish Academy, which selects the annual Nobel literature laureate.\n\nKarl Ragnar Gierow, permanent secretary of the academy and former director of the Stockholm National Theater, said that the coveted prize was being awarded to Mr. Boll “for his writing, which through its combination of a broad perspective on his time and a sensitive skill in characterization has contributed to a renewal of German literature.”\n\n‘German Year’ Was Seen\n\nAlthough Mr. Bell's selection had been a closely guarded secret before the prize announcement, there had been wide speculation in Stockholm that 1972 was “the German year” for the literature prize.\n\nWithin an hour after the announcement, afternoon Stockholm newspapers carried detailed biographies of Mr. Boll, while several bookstores placed in windows prominent —and obviously prepared—displays of the author's photograph and books.\n\nMr. Brill was selected by the 18‐member academy, composed of Swedish authors, critics and teachers. Nearly 1,000 persons, including former Nobel Prize winners, international authors and literature professors, had been invited to nominate candidates.\n\nIn recent years the winners have been chosen from disparate geographical areas. Last year the prize was given to Pablo Neruda, the Chilean poet. In 1970, Aleksandr Solzhenitzyn, the Soviet novelist, was named. The previous winners were Samuel Beckett, the Irishborn writer, and Yasunari Kawabata of Japan.\n\nMr. Boll is the first German citizen to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature since Thomas Mann won it in 1929. Hermann Hesse, born in Germany, was a Swiss citizen when he won the prize in 1946. The late poet Nelly Sachs, who was born in Germany and wrote in German, was honored in 1966, but she was a Swedish subject.\n\nMr. Boll, who was born in Cologne, the son of a sculptor, served as a German infantryman in World War II: His first novels, both bitterly antiwar, were “Adam, Where Art Thou?” and “The Train Was on Time.” They were published in the United States in the early nineteen‐fifties.\n\nHis later novels, “Acquainted With the Night,” and “The Unguarded House” (published in the United States as “Tomorrow and Yesterday”), dealt with the aftermath of the war, the problems of men obsessed with death, the economic revival of postwar Germany.\n\nMr. Boll's best‐known novels in the United States are “Bil‐Wards at Half Past Nine,” dealing with three German generations, published in the American edition in 1962, and “The Clown,” an expression of heartbreak at the Germany that the author has seen emerging from the war. It was published in the United States in 1965.\n\nMr. Boll's most recent novel, “Gruppenbild Mit Dame,” published last year, was cited by the Academy as “his most grandly conceived work. McGraw‐Hill has scheduled it for publication next March under the title, “Group Portrait With Lady.”\n\nWork Is Characterized\n\nDiscussing the scope of the writer's works, the academy said:\n\n“Boll has seldom moved any distance from the established landmarks of realistic narrative. He has shown less aptitude and interest in experiments with form than many other writer who is leaving his mark on modern literature in Germany and elsewhere.\n\n“Yet he has declared ‘Ich brauche wenig wirklichkeit’ (‘I need very little reality’), a word to note, coming from one who is regarded and who perhaps regards himself a realistic narrator. The reality he needs so little is that of the classic 19th‐century novel, the reality that after a meticulou's study of detail is faithfully reproduced.\n\n“Boll is highly proficient at the method but employs it ironically.”\n\nThe academy's statement added: “It is not the smallest German miracle that after such years of destitution a new generation of writers, thinkers and researchers was ready so soon to shoulder their country's and their own essential task in the spiritual life of our time.”"
