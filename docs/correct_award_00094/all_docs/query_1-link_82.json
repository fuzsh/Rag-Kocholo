        "text": "For almost 120 years, every December 10, Stockholm has celebrated a national holiday — Nobel Day (Nobeldagen), commemorating the award ceremony of the Nobel Prize winners. This award for breakthrough scientific discoveries and inventions, outstanding cultural achievements, and public service is considered the most respected and influential on the planet.\n\nSelecting Nobel Prize winners takes place in advance. It involves about 300 professionals of the highest category, scientists, and organizations around the world. The winners are awarded in five categories: physics, chemistry, physiology and medicine, literature, and peace promotion around the world (Peace Prize). Adjacent to this list is the Nobel Prize in Economics, launched by the Bank of Sweden in memory of its founder Alfred Nobel.\n\nThis year, they changed the usual order of awarding the Nobel Prizes because of the pandemic. In Stockholm, the traditional Nobel Prize ceremony and the banquet in the city hall have been canceled. They'll be replaced with a television ceremony with inclusions from several countries. In Norway, where the Peace Prize is awarded, they moved the ceremonial events from the City Hall to the University of Oslo. Last, its walls saw the event 30 years ago. However, the awards are still happening, since Nobeldagen is one of the most principal and anticipated events in the intellectual life not only of Sweden and Norway but also of all progressive humanity.\n\nThe prestigious award was created under the will of the Swedish scientist and philanthropist, industrial magnate and inventor of dynamite Alfred Nobel, who sent all his money to its prize fund. Carrying out the patron's last will, annually on the day of his death, the managers of the Nobel Foundation award honorary prizes and cash prizes to \"to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.\"\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901. Today, about a thousand people and organizations are on the list of Nobel laureates.\n\nIn the past, the primary reason for Ukrainians being absent in the Nobel lists was one condition for official participation in the competition for world intellectuals. The condition was the statehood of the people, whose representatives claim a top award, i.e. what our country was deprived of for many decades. We shouldn't forget that nominating Ukrainian laureates in literature negatively influenced the impending sword of the punitive totalitarian regime. Ukrainian writer Oksana Zabuzhko aptly remarked on this: \"Let us not forget that Ukrainian authors until recently couldn't participate. As soon as the Nobel Prize was looming, the nominees were killed by disinterested parties, extremely careful the Nobel Prize, the loudest microphone in the world, didn't fall into the hands of Ukrainians. The fate of Vasyl Stus isn't the only example. In fact, it's a big reason Bazhan refused the nomination. He wanted to live a little longer.\"\n\nToday, Ukraine has restored independence, so its citizens can enter the privileged circle. Although it's unrealistic to discuss the near future of Ukraine's claims to the Nobel Prize now. Lack of proper conditions for scientific research, insufficient funding for science, meager salaries and pensions, lack of interest in new research and projects by the Ukrainian government and society make Ukrainian scientists uncompetitive in the global \"scientific market,\" prevent modern science from developing in Ukraine and cause an outflow of brains to highly developed countries with better living and working conditions. Ukraine needs fresh ideas, new initiatives, and substantial financial investments in the intellectual field more than ever. There's hope that current conditions won't be the final verdict, because, despite everything, our scientists are actively involved in international scientific life.\n\nThough we don't have our own Nobel laureates yet, Ukraine can still be rightfully proud of its Nobel Prize-winning children as citizens of other countries. These are scientists and writers of Ukrainian descent, born in our country, who studied and began their activity or lived and worked in Ukraine for a long time.\n\n\"The greatest achievement of human genius is its ability to understand things that it can no longer imagine.\" Leo Landau\n\nPhysics was the area of prizes that Alfred Nobel first mentioned in his 1895 will. In the late nineteenth century, many people considered physics to be the most advanced science, and perhaps Nobel also agreed. His own research was also closely related to physics. During the entire award's existence, 9 scientists with Ukrainian ancestors received the award in physics.\n\nIsidor Rabi (1898-1988) was an American physicist born in the Lemko region, in the town of Rymanów (now Poland). He received the Nobel Prize in 1944 \"for resonance method for recording the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei.\"\n\nPolykarp Kusch (1911 – 1993) was an American physicist of Ukrainian descent, a native of Germany; a descendant of Ukrainians. He was a winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1955. In co-authorship with Willis Eugene Lamb, he received the Prize for \"accurate determination that the magnetic moment of the electron was greater than its theoretical value.\"\n\nIgor Yevgenyevich Tamm (1895–1971) was a theoretical physicist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1958. From 1898 to 1913 he lived and studied in Kropyvnytskyi (Yelisavetgrad), later entered the University of Edinburgh, completed his first year, and later returned to his homeland.\n\nLev Landau (1908-1968) was one of the most famous physicists of the Soviet era, taught and conducted research at the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology, Kharkiv University, and Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute. He received the Nobel Prize in 1962 \"for his pioneering theories for condensed matter, especially liquid helium.\"\n\nMurray Gell-Mann (1929-2019) was an American theoretical physicist of Jewish descent. He was a son of Ukrainian immigrants: mother was from the village of Basaltove, Rivne region; father was from Chernivtsi. He was a laureate of 1969 \"for his contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions.\"\n\nPyotr Kapitsa (1894-1984) was a Soviet physicist. The scientist's father, Colonel Leonid Kapitsa, is a Volyn native of Ukrainian-Polish origin. His mother came from the Ukrainian nobles, Stebnytskys. He was a laureate of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978 \"for his basic inventions and discoveries in the area of low-temperature physics.\"\n\nHeorhyi Kharpak (Georges Charpak) (1924-2010) was a French physicist from Dubrovytsia in the Rivne region (born into a Jewish family). He is considered one of the most talented experimental scientists. He was a winner of the 1992 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his invention and development of particle detectors, in particular the multiwire proportional chamber.\"\n\nDavid Gross (1941-) is an American physicist. The scientist's mother was born in Ukraine. His father is the famous scientist Bertram Myron Gross, the son of immigrants from the Zakarpattia region. He was a laureate of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004, for the \"discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interactions\" (with Frank Wilczek and H. David Politzer).\n\nSerge Haroche (1944-) is a French physicist. The scientist's mother, Valentina Rubleva, is from Odesa. He was a winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics (with David Wineland) for \"ground-breaking experimental methods to measure and manipulate individual quantum systems.\"\n\n\"If you want to make an excellent gift for your children or grandchildren, buy a stereomicroscope. If you want to make a gift for your school or university, buy a stereomicroscope.\" Daniel Shechtman\n\nChemistry was an important component in Alfred Nobel's work. The development of his inventions, and the technological processes he used, were based on knowledge of chemistry. That is why chemistry was the second area that Nobel mentioned in his will. Six chemists, descendants of Ukrainian immigrants, won this prestigious award.\n\nHerbert Charles Brown (1912-2004) was an American chemist of Jewish descent, the son of a Zhytomyr native. He was a laureate of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1979.\n\nRoald Hoffman (1937-) was born in Zolochiv in the family of engineer Hillel Safran, a graduate of the Lviv Polytechnic, and Clara Safran, a teacher. He was a laureate of the Nobel Prize in 1981 for the \"theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions.\" The words \"Ukraine–a land of contentment of my heart\" belong to him.\n\nSidney Altman (1939-) is a Canadian and American molecular biologist of Jewish descent, son of Victor Altman, a collective farmer from the Ukrainian village of Chornyi Ostriv, who emigrated from Ukraine in 1934. He was a laureate of the 1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (with Thomas Cech).\n\nIrwin A. Rose (1926-2015) was an American biologist of Jewish descent, the son of Harry Royze, a native of the Odesa region, and his wife, Ella Greenwald. He was a laureate of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, co-authored with Avram Hershko and Aaron Ciechanover for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.\n\nWalter Kohn (1923-2016) was an American theoretical physicist and chemist. His mother was born in Brody in the Lviv region. He was a laureate of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998, for the creation of electron density functional theory.\n\nDaniel Schechtman (1941-) is an Israeli physicist and chemist, the grandson of a native of Bila Tserkva. He was a winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011, \"for the discovery of quasicrystals.\"\n\n\"Man can use science to correct the imperfections of his nature.\" Illia Mechnykov\n\nAlfred Nobel stressed that prizes should be awarded for scientific work that gives maximum benefit to humanity. The Nobel Prize medal in physiology or medicine depicts an allegorical figure of \"Medicine\" holding an open book on its lap. In another hand, it holds a bowl into which water pours from a rock. Nearby, a girl is suffering from thirst. The inscription in Latin says: \"Inventas vitam juvat excoluisse per artes.\" This line is taken from Virgil's poem \"Aeneid\" and can be translated roughly: \"They who bettered life on earth by their newly found mastery.\"\n\nMasters of medicine who had ancestors from Ukrainian lands:\n\nIllia Mechnykov (1845-1916) was a Nobel Laureate in Physiology and Medicine. Ukrainian scientist, author, and founder of many theories and scientific teachings in biology, who graduated from Kharkiv University.\n\nSelman Abraham Waksman (1888-1973) was an American scientist, a native of Nova Pryluka village, Lypovetsyi Uyezd, Kyiv Governorate (now the Vinnytsia region). The 1952 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for his discovery of streptomycin, the first antibiotic effective against tuberculosis.\"\n\nGeorge Wald (1906-1997) was a scientist in the fields of physiology and medicine. George Wald's father was born in a Ukrainian village near Przemyśl. He was a winner of the Nobel Prize for discoveries related to the primary physiological and chemical visual processes of the eye, with Haldan Keffer Hartline and Ragnar Granit in 1967.\n\nRosalyn Sussman Yalow (1921-2011) was an American biophysicist. The family of the scientist's father Simon Sussman emigrated from Ukraine. She received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1977, \"for the development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.\"\n\nCesar Milstein (1927-2002) was an Argentine immunologist of Jewish descent and the son of migrants from the Podolsk governorate. He was a laureate of the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1984 \"for theories concerning the specificity in control and development of the immune system and the discovery of the principle for production of monoclonal antibodies.\"\n\nEric Kandel (1929-) is an Austrian and American neurobiologist, psychiatrist, professor of biochemistry. Son of Ukrainian immigrants: scientist's mother was from Kolomyia, Ivano-Frankivsk region; father was from Olesk, Lviv region. He was a laureate of the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology \"for his research on the physiological basis of memory storage in neurons.\"\n\nH. Robert Horvitz (born May 8, 1947, in Chicago, United States) is an American biologist whose grandmother was born in Novgorod-Siversky, Ukraine. He's a winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 2002, \"for the discoveries concerning genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death\" (with Sydney Brenner and John E. Sulston).\n\nRalph Steinman (1943 – 2011[13]) was a Canadian and American immunologist and cytologist of Jewish origin, son of Stary Ostropil native, Khmelnytskyi region. He was a winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine (with Bruce Butler and Jules Hoffman) \"for his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity.\"\n\n\"I think a hero is someone who understands the degree of responsibility that comes with his freedom.\" Bob Dylan\n\nAlfred Nobel's personal library numbered thousands of volumes of specialized and fiction literature in various languages. In his final years, he tried his hand at not only being a scientist but also a writer, writing fiction. Literature was the fourth area mentioned by Nobel in his will.\n\nThe generous Ukrainian land has given the world an entire galaxy of Nobel Prize-winning writers who have discovered their creative potential in other countries.\n\nIvan Bunin (1870-1953) first lived and married in Odesa, then lived in Poltava.
