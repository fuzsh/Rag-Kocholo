And to imagine critics, far in the future, deploying lofty new terms to explain what it is that makes Keegan’s fiction work.” —Maud Newton, The New York Times Book Review\n\n“[Keegan’s] . . . collections have drawn comparisons to William Trevor and Anton Chekhov . . . [She] crafts stories out of small details and insight . . . like poetry. . . . Claire Keegan is the real deal.” —Keith Donohue, “You Must Read This” NPR.com\n\n“[A] stunning second collection . . . Keegan’s stories are the literary counterparts to Picasso’s Blue Period paintings. . . . Keegan’s first collection, Antarctica, led to comparisons with Raymond Carver, but Annie Proulx, with her distilled, poetic prose and attunement to remote landscapes, is a closer match.” —Heller McAlpin, San Francisco Chronicle"
