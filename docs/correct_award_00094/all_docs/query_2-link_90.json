        "text": "By: Kinsey Bushart Freelancer\n\nThis year Bob Dylan became the first American to win a Nobel Prize since novelist Toni Morrison back in 1993. Dylan is also the first ever songwriter to be awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in the 112 years since the award was created, and the newest person awarded with the honor of being the top most inspirational and developed literary creators.\n\nBob Dylan began his singing, songwriting, writing and art career in 1959 at the age of 18. In the 75-year-old’s long career, he has gathered the admiration of millions of people around the world with his poetic and inspirational lyrics. In his time as a revered icon, Dylan gathered quite the following, especially in the 1960s when some of his most influential as well as controversial songs were released. At that time he was considered an unofficial spokesman on the issues in America and he also addressed said issues in his lyrics and movements.\n\nDylan was touring while the broadcast of his Nobel Prize was announced but since the Nobel Committee decided to award the Nobel Prize in literature to Bob Dylan, they have not been able to contact the artist except through his manager. Since they have yet to receive a confirmation of acceptance from Dylan, the committee has given up attempting to award the icon this prestigious honor. The ceremony will go on as planned, even if Dylan is not there to accept it.\n\nContact the author at kbushart16@wou.edu"
