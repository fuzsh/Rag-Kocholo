        "text": "Kathleen Winter, a Lecturer in Creative Writing for the Department of English, was awarded a solo writer's residency on Achill Island, County Mayo, Ireland, in early January, 2024. The award from the Heinrich Böll Foundation granted her two weeks at the Heinrich Böll Cottage, a family home formerly owned by the German author, who won the Nobel Prize in 1972. Winter has been an admirer of Böll's novels and stories ever since she studied his work with Gayatri Spivak at the University of Texas as an undergraduate. Professor Winter was delighted to have this opportunity to write poems and prose at the desk of one of her literary heroes, and to have a starkly beautiful island to explore when she finished working for the day."
