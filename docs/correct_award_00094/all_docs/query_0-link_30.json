        "text": "Although 11 of his books have been published here to good reviews, the award of the 1972 Nobel Prize for Literature to Heinrich Böll for his “contribution to the renewal of German literature” has made little impression in America. Solzhenitsyn, Beckett, even Neruda — among recent prizewinners — seem closer to home. Böll's many novels, stories, articles and plays have won him a large popular following in both West and East Europe, and he is also a conspicuous political gadfly in Germany. But for most Americans, and for many writers and critics in Europe, the more aggressive and innovative Günter Grass is certainly as well‐known and often more admired. And though they are less familiar here, Jakov Lind and Peter Handke of Austria, Uwe Johnson of Germany and Max Frisch of Switzerland are also impressive literary figures who have helped resuscitate the German language.\n\nImplicitly acknowledging these other writers, and conceding the relative conservatism of Boll's techniques, the Nobel Prize committee remarked in its citation “Böll has seldom moved any distance from the established landmarks of realistic narrative. He has shown less aptitude and interest in experiments than many other writers who are leaving their marks on modern literature in Germany and elsewhere.”\n\nOf course it's true that Nobel Prize winners are expected to be traditional, grand and good; moral uplift often seems to count for more than craft. Yet, as with Solzhenitsyn, there is indeed an exemplary moral directness to Böll's writing. He has been a steady and prolific worker for 25 years: he was the first to struggle out of the ruins of the German language (as Ernst Pawel put it) and he has continued to strike out at the corruptions and fatuities of postwar Germany with the same clear strength that was so attractive years ago. Like Joseph Heller, who is almost the only major American writer to have praised him, Böll is an expert on wartime jargon and bureaucratic stupidity seen from the bottom up. Böll, too, is an ironic realist who sacrifices a smooth surface for a blunt “comic” truth; he has a very sharp eye for social detail and a fine ear for actual speech; and he is unashamed to talk of good and evil, love and hate.\n\nHis new book, “Group Portrait With Lady,” was rightly singled out by the Nobel Prize committee as “his most grandly conceived work”; it is as warm and rich as any foreign novel published here in the last few years, and it surely deserves the popularity of “The Tin Drum,” “One Hundred Years of Solitude” and “The First Circle,” It is a far from perfect work of art—and it is not the literary equal of these other three but it is full of strong human feelings, it surveys nearly all of German society over 50 years, and no less than 60 people surround the “lady” of the title.\n\nOne must add immediately that Böll is remarkable for his sensitivity to his women characters: among American male writers only Updike approaches him in this. Böll's decision to put a woman in the center of his new novel seems to have freed him from the earnest anecdotal simplicity and the ponderous impacted irony that marred many of his earlier books. It may be that the more direct expression of his strong erotic and moral affection for women has released literary energy blocked by the anger he so often feels toward German men and masculine society. Böll may run on too long in this book, but he isn't struggling with form: for once the many flashbacks don't drag the present action to a halt. The book flows freely; it isn't jammed up—as were the “The Clown” and “Billiards at Half‐Past Nine,” for all their acclaim.\n\nThe plot of the new novel is deliberately banal, circumstantial, the stuff of common life. At 48, Leni Pfeiffer faces eviction from her apartment in Cologne. Though she rents out rooms, she still cannot keep her creditors at bay. She is a widow; her only son is in jail for forging checks to get her off the hook; without his income (he's a garbage man) she cannot hold on.\n\nIn the New Germany, Leni's “sloppy ways”—her total indifference to profit and property — are anomalous. The building she is in doesn't yield enough income, her roomers are foreign laborers; it's precisely in this atmosphere, says her landlord, that “collectivist not to say communistic illusions may thrive.” No matter that she has lived here all her life, that she's known the landlord for 30 years, that his grandson was her son's godfather when he was christened during an air raid at the end of the war. Times change. Loyalties shift. There's always money to be made, no matter what the going ideology. Only a fool cares about words like decency, charity, love. Even in Blill's Catholic Cologne.\n\nPeople talk about Leni as loose woman: she's rebuffed several men and they've begun to gossip jealously now that she's taken up with one of the Turks who rent her rooms. But despite a “veritable genius for sensuality” (which Böll describes as a kind of innocent erotic grace, a sign of spiritual favor; not lust) she has had only four lovers in her nearly 50 years. Much of the novel tells this tale.\n\nLeni's first suitor was killed before he could propose; he was 17, on home leave in 1939 and too shy to rush things, though Leni was willing. Her husband was killed three days after the wedding. Her “true” love and father of her son was a Soviet P.O.W. who was killed in a stupid mine accident in Lorraine after spending 18 almost idyllic months with Leni—if “idyllic” can describe a clandestine wartime love affair between a Russian prisoner (who was in fact a devotee of German songs and poetry) and a pure Aryan girl who didn't give a fig for politics. (Their love affair was carried on in a cemetery in the closing days of the war, when air raids were the only time for trysts.) Finally there's the stolid Turkish garbage man, by whom she's pregnant, a man Leni pities more than loves.\n\nNow her chief pleasures seem to be eating two crisp rolls for breakfast, playing Schubert piano sonatas, and working on a curious scientific painting in honor of a nun she knew at boarding school in the 1930's, a nun who had been born a Jew, became a heretical Catholic and died during the war, and whom Leni sacrilegiously associates with the Virgin Mary. (Böll is playing games with this, for his novel is a “portrait” too, and it's clear that as the “lady” of the title Leni is herself a secular incarnation of the Virgin.)\n\nTo paint what he pretends is a “purely factual” portrait of Leni, Böll appears in the book as “the Author,” working as combination investigative reporter, sociologist and detective. In this guise he interviews the 60 characters who know or have known Leni at various points in her life. What emerges from this wry pseudo‐documentary is also a social portrait of Cologne from the 1920's to the present, a Joycean evocation of a city and its people.\n\nIn his zealous pursuit of “the truth about Leni” the Author interviews her best friend Margret, a German Molly Bloom dying of syphilis at a local charity hospital; three nuns who “educated” Leni; a music critic who has heard her sing and play the piano from across the courtyard for 30 years; a municipal parks employe who tends a cemetery which he uses after hours as a private park; a retired ex‐thief, ex‐pimp, ex‐con, ex‐Communist, ex‐Nazi real‐estate tycoon who had employed Leni as a funeral‐wreath maker during the war; an ex‐Communist newspaper dealer who refuses on Marxist principles to stock the new pornography; a retired lady florist (actually a Jew and a Rhineland Separatist —twice anti‐Nazi) who worked with Leni making the funeral wreaths. And many others, including a nun in Rome, whom the Author—abandoning the last of his pretense to valueneutral research—elopes with.\n\nThe charm of Blill's novel lies in the loving accumulation of mundane details, this mixture of the commonplace and bizarre. By tracing Leni Pfeiffer's life through half a century of German history, Btill has written a novel celebrating common humanity —or as he puts it, “natural human innocence,” which remains unbroken by the weight of politics, war, depression and boom.\n\nIn addition to presenting this crowd of characters, each vociferously insisting on his or her own individuality, Böll carefully instructs us in the ways of the world: There are several accounts of elaborate financial scandals; a fascinating disquisition on changing styles of funeral wreaths; samples of bureaucratic language peculiar to periods before, during and after the war; excerpts from Nazi Army manuals (how to wash, how to salute); and bits of testimony by Albert Speer and Alfred Rosenberg on Soviet P.O.W. slave‐labor conditions. Boll does not merely sketch in local types for color; he shows us much of the evil of men in groups, of institutions, with their sinister jargon and endless finagling. Like a modern Dickens, Boll mixes social satire, sentiment and a thousand city voices. Leni is a German Little Dorrit—a figure of beleaguered virtue shining in a world of vice, misery, destitution, a world vigorously portrayed with comedy, bitterness, sorrow and tenderness.\n\nIt is true that BOIL can be too sentimental; at times he indulges in a kind of labored whimsy, and he does unfortunately force a too easy, optimistic conclusion to the plot. He obviously loves his characters more than art, but he has created them so well that we cannot judge him harshly—we read on. In fact he often wins affection for his faults: he tends to overqualify himself ironically, but this is always in the service of truth, not vanity; and he slows his narrative at points to make a further distinction or add another voice with more “evidence,” but in this too be is mocking his mock ‐ sociological method and gently drawing attention to the artiface of his novel.\n\nThe book is a Brechtian collage: Boll assembles his material to demonstrate that, even in Germany, life goes on beneath the surface and the lies of history, despite the concussive power of institutions, ideologies and individual rapacity. By going into biographical detail, Boll dramatizes the impossibility of generalizing, about people, makes us feel the vast gaps that exist between political slogans and moral actualities, between those who slyly ride with the times and those who, like Leni, may lose their wealth, their family, their social position and all the world, but gain their souls.\n\nThis anticlerical, Roman Catholic novelist has thus written a secular story about the workings of grace in a venal society. Seldom in recent years has such a society been so carefully and patiently portrayed. Böll's mundane heroine moves through this fallen world with something of the unselfconscious moral beauty of Faulkner's Negroes and Solzhenitsyn's prisoners. What is especially attractive is that Boll achieves all this without cant; he does not wear his morality on his sleeve. He has indeed epitomized his life work in this book: It reminds us of the virtues and the charms of old‐fashioned European Catholic humanism, and it gives old ‐ fashioned pleasures."
