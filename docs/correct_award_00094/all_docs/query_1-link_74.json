        "text": "1 / 91\n\nullstein bild Dtl. // Getty Images\n\n1931: First prize awarded posthumously\n\nErik Axel Karlfeldt was the first Nobel winner to be awarded posthumously. The Swedish poet was alive during the nomination and deliberation process but died six months before the Literature Prize was announced. As of 1974, the rules were changed so that awards can only be given posthumously if the winner dies after the announcement but before the formal award is bestowed.\n\n2 / 91\n\nHistorical // Getty Images\n\n1932: Author of 'The Forsyte Saga' wins\n\nJohn Galsworthy, author of \"The Forsyte Saga,\" was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. The chronicle of English life became a hugely popular miniseries in 1967 on American public television.\n\n3 / 91\n\nImagno // Getty Images\n\n1933: Nazis accuse prize winner of jewel smuggling\n\nIvan Bunin, the first Russian writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, departed Russia after the 1917 revolution and settled in France as a permanent exile. His books were banned by Soviet authorities due to his anti-Bolshevik writing. To accept his Nobel Prize in Stockholm, Bunin had to travel through Germany, where he was arrested by the Nazis and falsely accused of smuggling jewels. The Nazis forced him to drink a bottle of castor oil before letting him go.\n\n4 / 91\n\nBettmann // Getty Images\n\n1934: Winners determine cause of anemia\n\nThree Americans shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their research into anemia, when the body's red blood cell count is low. George Whipple found dogs formed new blood cells by eating diets of liver, kidney, meat, and apricots, and George Minot and William Murphy applied those findings to humans with pernicious anemia. They also delved into the cause of pernicious anemia: a shortage of vitamin B12.\n\n5 / 91\n\nullstein bild Dtl. // Getty Images\n\n1935: Nobel winner held in concentration camp\n\nThe 1935 Peace Prize was awarded to Carl von Ossietzky, a journalist and critic of Nazi Germany who was being held in a concentration camp. Hitler would not allow him to accept the prize. He died in 1938 in a prison hospital. Also in 1935, married couple Frédéric Joliot and Irène Joliot-Curie won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Joliot-Curie was the daughter of Marie Curie and Pierre Curie, also Nobel Prize winners.\n\n6 / 91\n\nKeystone // Getty Images\n\n1936: Norway's royal family skips ceremony\n\nThe Norwegian royal family chose not to attend the Nobel ceremony following the controversial choice of German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky to win the Peace Prize. Critics said the prize decision would provoke Germany. The royal family offered no official explanation for skipping the ceremony, but it was widely believed that Norway wanted to distance itself from the prize selection.\n\n7 / 91\n\nBettmann // Getty Images\n\n1937: Nobel Prize in Physics highlights advancements from accidents\n\nAmerican physicist Clinton Davisson won the Nobel Prize partly by accident. When he was testing the hypothetical relation between particle velocity and wavelength, he bombarded a nickel block with electrons and measured how they scattered. But when the nickel was baked at high heat after accidental contamination, the structure of its atoms changed, as did the patterns of the electrons, proving the hypothesis.\n\n8 / 91\n\nUniversal History Archive // Getty Images\n\n1938: Nazis force winner to turn down prize\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1938 was awarded to Richard Kuhn, a Austrian biochemist who researched vitamins and carotenoids. He was forced by Nazi authorities to turn down the prize, and forfeit the prize money, but he was awarded the medal and diploma following World War II.\n\n9 / 91\n\nullstein bild Dtl. // Getty Images\n\n1939: Two winners made to decline Nobels\n\nGermany's Adolf Butenandt won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research into sex hormones that would be used in the development of oral contraception. Like Richard Kuhn in 1938, he was forced by the Nazis to decline the prize but was able to accept the certificate and medal in 1949. Germany's Gerhard Domagk, whose research led to the development of antibiotics, also had to turn down the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine but got it after the war.\n\n10 / 91\n\nHulton Deutsch // Getty Images\n\n1940: World War II halts Nobels\n\nNo Nobel prizes were awarded in 1940 due to World War II. Norway was occupied by German forces, and Adolf Hitler was angry about the 1936 Peace Prize awarded to Carl von Ossietzky, a journalist who disclosed that Germany had been secretly rearming, a violation of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I. Ossietzky was tried and convicted of treason.\n\nYou may also like: Counties with the highest rate of food-insecure children\n\n11 / 91\n\nDonaldson Collection // Getty Images\n\n1941: Nobel winners flee Europe\n\nNot only were no Nobel Prizes awarded while the world was locked in war, but a significant brain drain was underway that would see Europe lose many of its brilliant thinkers. By 1941, a dozen Nobel-winning scientists had left for England and the United States, including physicists Niels Bohr, a winner in 1922; Albert Einstein, who won in 1921; and Enrico Fermi, who won in 1938.\n\n12 / 91\n\nHulton Deutsch // Getty Images\n\n1942: Idea of United Nations, future winner, takes hold\n\nWhile no Nobel Prizes were awarded, 1942 was the year that the name United Nations was coined by President Franklin Roosevelt in a declaration by 26 nations to stand together against the Axis powers. Founded three years later, the United Nations—along with its agencies, programs, and staff—has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize a dozen times.
