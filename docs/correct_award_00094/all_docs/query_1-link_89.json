        "text": "No, not exactly a cheery story for the festive season, The Train Was on Time is by the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1972, Heinrich Böll, (1917-1985). It was in the pile of books that I had set aside for Novellas in November…\n\nMy edition is from the short-lived Penguin European Writers series of seven. It consisted of\n\nThe Train Was on Time (1949) by Heinrich Böll\n\nA Moth to a Flame (1948) by Stig Dagerman\n\nThe Lady & The Little Fox Fur (1965) by Violette Leduc, see my review\n\nThree Summers (1946) by Margarita Liberaki (abandoned)\n\nThe Beautiful Summer (1949) by Cesare Pavese\n\nDeath in Spring (1986, posthumous) by Mercè Rodoreda, see my review of a different edition\n\nWomen (1933) by Mihail Sebastian\n\nAlas, Penguin could not get its description right. Andreas is twenty-three, not twenty-four, and considering that the coincidence of his age and his birthday falling in the same month as the girl Olina’s takes up some pages in what is a very short book, one wonders how such a silly mistake could have been made.\n\nTwenty-four-year-old Andreas, a disillusioned German soldier, is travelling on a troop train to the Eastern Front when he has an awful premonition that he will die in exactly five days. As he hurtles towards his death, he reflects on the chaos around him – the naïve soldiers, the painfully thin girl who pours his coffee, the ruined countryside – with sudden, heart-breaking poignancy. Arriving in Poland the night before he is certain he will die, he meets Olina, a beautiful prostitute, and together they attempt to escape his fate…\n\nAs with The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum (1974), which I reviewed here, Böll uses irony extensively. Anna Funder in her Introduction refers to Böll’s preoccupation with subservience to authority as the root of totalitarianism, but makes no mention of Andreas’s numerous references to praying for the Jews. The Train Was on Time was first published in 1949 as Germany was trying to come to terms with the Holocaust, when people all over the world were reeling in horror at the knowledge that trains transported millions of Jews to their deaths. Those trains were ‘on time’ too, and the irony of this nightmare journey is that whereas the soldier Andreas knows he is destined for death on the battlefield, the Jews being deported from all over Europe did not know their fate. Significantly — considering the pervasive postwar denials about what was known at the time — this character Andreas knows about the fate of the Jews and that he should pray for them. Other than Böll being a Catholic himself, I am not sure if there is any significance in Andreas being Catholic rather than Protestant. Perhaps someone else can enlighten me.\n\nOn the first page of The Train Was On Time, Böll alerts the reader to the importance of language, in what seems to be a rather strange paragraph:\n\nNow and again what appears to be a casually spoken word will suddenly acquire a cabalistic significance. It becomes charged and strangely swift, races ahead of the speaker, is destined to throw open a chamber in the uncertain confines of the future and to return to him with the deadly accuracy of a boomerang. Out of the small talk of unreflecting speech, usually from among those halting, colourless goodbyes exchanged beside trains on their way to death, it falls back on the speaker like a leaden wave, and he becomes aware of the force, both frightening and intoxicating, of the workings of fate. To lovers and soldiers, to men marked for death and to those filled with the cosmic force of life, this power is sometimes given, without warning; a sudden revelation is conferred on them, a bounty and a burden… and the word sinks down inside them. (p1-2)\n\nFor Andreas, it’s as he boards the train that the word ‘soon’ enters him like a bullet and almost imperceptibly penetrating flesh, tissues, cells, nerves, until at some point it caught, like a barbed hook… His fate dawns on him as he tries to calculate where and when his ultimate destination might be and he is suddenly overwhelmed by the shock of fear. He realises he will never again see that station, his friend, or even a man he’d abused.\n\nReminiscent of the way Jews were packed into trains so tightly that some of them were crushed to death en route, Andreas and his fellow soldiers are squeezed into the carriage for their journey. Andreas sits down on his pack because there’s nowhere else to put it, and…\n\n… tried to arrange his legs as comfortably as possible: he stretched the left one carefully past the face of one sleeping soldier, and placed the other one across a piece of luggage that was shielding the back of another.\n\nIn another irony, they jam the door shut with their bodies so that others may not enter, an allusion to the way that the Jews were locked and bolted into the carriages from the outside so that they could not get out.\n\nOnce the reader becomes alert to these resonances, Böll’s theme seems to be on every page. German guilt pervades the narrative. Here, Andreas is berating himself for ill-treating a whore:\n\nIt’s a terrible thing to maltreat a person because that person seems ugly to you. There are no ugly people. That poor soul. God forgive me twenty-four hours before my death for having pushed away that poor, ugly, shivering whore…\n\n[…]\n\nIf I could only cry. I can’t even cry over all these things. I feel heartsick and contrite and terrible, but I can’t cry over them. (p.57)\n\nOn the next page he becomes overwhelmed by the enormity of a world war, and how it touches everyone (Two billion was the approximate population of the world before the war; the war dead are estimated to be close to 40 million.)\n\nAndreas wanted to pray, he wanted desperately to pray; first, all the prayers he had always said, and then a few more of his own, and then he wanted to say over the names, to begin to say over the names, of all the people he had to pray for, but then he thought that was crazy, to say all those names. You would have to include everybody, the whole world. You would have to say two billion names…. forty million, he thought… no, two billion names it would have to be. You’d simply have to say everyone. (p. 58)\n\nAnother theme to follow through on a re-reading is the breakdown of order for which the German regime was notorious. It’s not clear whether Andreas’s passive resistance is deliberate or not. He almost misses the train i.e. it is ‘on time’ but he is not; and though he has brought his steel helmet and rucksack, he has forgotten to bring his rifle. Nobody else seems to notice, and he doesn’t seem very bothered that he is going into battle without a weapon:\n\nMy rifle, he thought, it’s standing propped up in Paul’s wardrobe behind his raincoat. He smiled. ‘That’s right, mate,’ said the blond fellow. ‘Forget your troubles and join the game.’ (p.10)\n\nOne of the soldiers with him is in a need of a shave, and barricaded inside their compartment with no supervision, they soon get drunk. There are partisans about, but arrangements to guard the train are haphazard. One of the men knows how to get around the paperwork in Lvov so that they can have a good time there.\n\nThe Train Was on Time is the story of one soldier and his existential crisis en route to war, but it is also a story about much more than that.\n\nThe translation by Leila Vennewitz is enhanced by vivid imagery, and maintains a melancholy tone appropriate to the story.\n\nOther reviews are at Stu at Winston’s Dad and at Kaggsy’s Bookish Ramblings."
