        "text": "685\n\nApplication Deadline: June 15th, 2022\n\nThe Dr. Norman E. Borlaug Award for Field Research and Application, endowed by the Rockefeller Foundation, is presented every October in Des Moines, Iowa, by the World Food Prize Foundation.\n\nThis $10,000 award recognizes exceptional, science-based achievement in international agriculture and food production by an individual under the age of 40. Awardees emulate the same intellectual courage, stamina and determination in the fight to eliminate global hunger and poverty demonstrated by Dr. Norman Borlaug as a young scientist working in Mexico in the 1940s and ’50s.\n\nDr. Judith Rodin, former President of The Rockefeller Foundation, announced during the 25th World Food Prize Laureate Award Ceremony in 2011 that her Foundation would commit $1 million to endow this annual award in honor of Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, whose early work in Mexico was supported by The Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nThe award diploma incorporates the image of Dr. Borlaug at work in the fields of Mexico, as shown on the left. The image was created by artist John Collier and hangs as a tapestry in the Hall of Laureates.\n\nThe award presentation is appropriately held in the historically preserved and environmentally renovated World Food Prize Hall of Laureates. This $29.8 million project restored the century-old Des Moines Public Library and transformed it as a special tribute to Nobel Peace Prize winner and World Food Prize founder Dr. Borlaug.\n\nFor More Information:"
