        "text": "Much has been written about Norman Borlaug the agricultural scientist and humanitarian whose achievements are recognized with many accolades; to add to those writings is a difficult task. This brief paper is an attempt to provide a personal perspective on Norman Borlaug that can come only from someone who has worked closely with him throughout his professional life. I have endeavored to recollect my early impressions of working with Borlaug as a wheat breeder in Mexico and to highlight his innovative approach to wheat breeding, as well as his views on global population and food security, fertilizers, organic agriculture, biotechnology, and conventional academia. His work ethic was instrumental in his vision for the international agricultural system as an instrument of change in the world. His spirit serves as a reminder to future agricultural scientists that the battle must be vigorously engaged and can be won."
