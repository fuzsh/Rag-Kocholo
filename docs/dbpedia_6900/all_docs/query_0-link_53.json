        "text": "A Global Partnership This isn't a mission Millennium Fellowship can tackle alone. It's a global partnership that involves governments, businesses, and individuals. It's a call to action for all of humanity to come together and address the scourge of hunger. You too can play a part in the MCF SDG 2 project. Whether it's supporting local farmers, reducing food waste in your home, or advocating for policies that promote food security, your actions can help turn the dream of a hunger-free world into a reality. In the face of the daunting challenge of hunger, the MCF SDG 2 project reminds us that our collective efforts can truly make a difference. It's a testament to the power of humanity to come together and create positive change, one meal at a time.\n\nAt Pact, we believe in working together with local communities to tackle climate change and promote sustainable natural resource management. Our projects in Indonesia, Malawi and Rwanda are just three examples of our commitment to conservation and ecosystem restoration. Our MANGROVE SAHABAT TAMBAK LESTARI (MESTI) project in Indonesia is addressing the challenges faced by shrimp farmers who clear mangroves to make room for shrimp ponds. By promoting sustainable aquaculture practices, supporting farmers' business capacity, and enabling sustainability certifications, we are improving environmental health and empowering local communities. In Lake Malawi, we are working to protect the lake's rich biodiversity and ensure sustainable fisheries management by 2024 through our REFRESH program. By promoting self-sustaining fish populations and healthy aquatic habitats, we are helping fishers maintain their livelihoods and protect this important natural resource. In Rwanda, our Iluminating Small Scale Mining program is improving safety, productivity, and sustainability in the mining sector by introducing rechargeable headlamps that are powered by solar energy or the national grid connection. By replacing disposable battery-powered flashlights with more practical and durable equipment, we are making a real difference in the lives of women and men who work in this industry. At Pact, we believe that by working with local communities and promoting sustainable practices, we can make a positive impact on the environment, natural resources, and people's lives. https://lnkd.in/eUNTe2xM David Bonnardeaux Nicole Perkins Baddou Todd Kirkbride Kevin Gomez Dr. James McQuilken\n\nAustralian Environmental Grantmakers Network (AEGN) have launched their new Nature Funding Framework, which presents priorities and opportunities for its members to protect, restore and manage nature and realise the full potential of their giving. Philanthropy has a vital role to play in scaling up the existing solutions and building new and emerging initiatives to respond to the interlinked nature and climate crises. That said, it cannot and should not replace the role and necessity of public funding, but it can leverage the success of the strong #privatelandconservation sector, which is already delivering on-the-ground capacity and existing domestic investment. With whole-of-government support, a significant uplift in public and private investment, and strong policy mandates, we can achieve so much more for nature.\n\nThere are more than 167,000 registered charities in the U.K. alone and our focus on funding experts in biodiversity expands across the world üåé We believe that funding is a 2-way process. It is as much our responsibility to seek out excellent organisations as it is the responsibility of NGOs to find funders. So, how can we ensure that we find out about and connect with all of the organisations doing work in this space? 1. As we get more involved in the sector, we meet and hear about organisations through newsletters and events ü§ù 2. We are members of the Environmental Funders Network, who are doing fantastic work in connecting the dots within the sector üå≥ 3. We conduct our own desk-based research, listen to podcasts, and read articles üìë 4. In our recent website relaunch, we included a 'Tell Us About You' form. It simply asks for contact details and a link to further information so that we can then carry out our own due diligence üíª One of the funders in our network heard about the form and told us, 'I am fully intending on stealing that!'. Since launching our new strategy in August, we have discovered 30+ biodiversity-focused organisations that we had never come across before! And, half of those came through our 'Tell Us About You' form. If you know of any brilliant organisations working on the biodiversity crisis, direct them here ‚û° https://lnkd.in/eT_CD-ic And, please use the comment section below to share any other ideas on how we can best discover organisations! ‚¨á #partnership #funding #fundingbiodiversity #fundingnature #collaboration #grantmaking #philanthropy Becky Holmes Lauren Gupta"
