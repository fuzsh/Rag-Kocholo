        "text": "​\n\nNorman Borlaug was famous for his work to increase agricultural production and, more specifically, for his contribution with the Green Revolution. He received many recognitions for his work, including winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Through the Green Revolution, Borlaug exponentially increased food production worldwide and, as a result, saved billions from starvation.\n\nIn 1944, Borlaug took a research position for the Rockefeller Foundation’s Cooperative Mexican Agricultural Program in Mexico. In the next sixteen years, Borlaug formed a strain of high-yield, disease-resistant, semi-dwarf Mexican wheat for impoverished farmers who worked with diseased and low-producing crops.\n\nBorlaug combined the wheat varieties with modern agricultural technology and significantly improved wheat production and food security in Mexico. Borlaug was also approached by India and Pakistan for this wheat variety to be grown to help with their food shortage issues. India can now autonomously produce food for its country due to Borlaug’s innovative work. This strain of wheat has also been used in several other countries in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Additionally, Borlaug created a wheat-rye hybrid that was employed to grow fruitful varieties of rice. This new hybrid helped benefit many developing nations.\n\nCENTERED ON CHRIST\n\n​\n\nIn his book, “Norman Borlaug on World Hunger,” Borlaug discussed the basic need for food and referenced drought and famine described in the Bible. He noted that in Genesis, Joseph was made wise by God. He was able to combat the coming famine and inform Pharaoh how to avoid it. Borlaug also recognized the need for technology to help developing nations produce food for basic means of living.\n\nBorlaug stated, “In my own lexicon, creative work is the best medicine that God has given to men and women to work for the benefit of the family, community, nation, and lastly the world at large.” He credited God for the work that he accomplished in giving him innovative thinking.\n\nBorlaug also specifically referenced the human population beginning with Adam and Eve and expanding to around 250 million people by the time of Christ."
