        "text": "When Norman Borlaug set out after World War II to develop an ultra-resilient strain of wheat in Mexico, he had no idea the impact his work would have. Borlaug’s wildly successful efforts to increase crop yields came to be known as the “Green Revolution” and earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his role in fighting global hunger. But over time, the midwestern agronomist’s methods came under increasing attack, with critics decrying his work’s profoundly negative impact on rural farmers and the environment. To learn more about Borlaug's world-changing, American Experience spoke with Raymond C. Offenheiser, the William J. Pulte Director of the Pulte Institute for Global Development and Distinguished Professor of the Practice at the Keough School of Global Affairs.\n\nOriginally published at pbs.org on April 3, 2020."
