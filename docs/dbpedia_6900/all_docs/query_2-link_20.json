        "text": "(1914–2009). American agricultural scientist Norman Borlaug dedicated his life to alleviating world hunger and in the 1940s helped initiate what became known as the Green Revolution—a series of technological advances in crop production that enabled many developing countries to overcome the threat of famine and, in some cases, become agriculturally self-sufficient. For his efforts in applying new science and technology to the solution of one of humanity’s most urgent problems, Borlaug was awarded the Nobel prize for peace in 1970. (See also Nobel prizes.)\n\nNorman Ernest Borlaug was born on March 25, 1914, in Cresco, Iowa. He studied plant biology and forestry at the University of Minnesota and earned a Ph.D. in plant pathology there in 1941. As a research scientist for the Rockefeller Foundation’s agricultural program in Mexico from 1944 to 1960, Borlaug succeeded in developing new strains of wheat that dramatically increased crop yields. Wheat production in Mexico multiplied threefold during those years. Borlaug later helped expand the program to other countries; high-yielding “dwarf” wheat imported in the mid-1960s was responsible for a 60 percent increase in harvests in Pakistan and India, for example."
