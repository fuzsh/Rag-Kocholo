        "text": "Agricultural scientist Norman Borlaug, the father of the \"green revolution\" who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in combating world hunger and saving hundreds of millions of lives, and who is often credited as the Legend who \" saved more lives than any other person who has ever lived\" is no more. He died Saturday(13th September) in Texas, a Texas A&M University spokeswoman said. He was 95.\n\nBorlaug died just before 11 p.m. Saturday at his home in Dallas from complications of cancer, said school spokeswoman Kathleen Phillips. Phillips said Borlaug's granddaughter told her about his death. Borlaug was a distinguished professor at the university in College Station.\n\nThe Nobel committee honored Borlaug in 1970 for his contributions to high-yield crop varieties and bringing other agricultural innovations to the developing world. Many experts credit the green revolution with averting global famine during the second half of the 20th century and saving perhaps 1 billion lives. Thanks to the green revolution, world food production more than doubled between 1960 and 1990. The countries of Indian Sub continent have benifited from the high yielding varieties. In 1970s when India was importing millions of tons of grain to feed it's people Norman's green revolution is the blessing that came in disguise. In this page we will try to present his biography , his achievements in Brief.\n\nGallery\n\nBelow are the various pictures of Norman Borlaug borrowed from various websites .. click on an image to zoom in place, use arrows to surf through the images..( requires javascript)\n\nBiography\n\nA central figure in the \"green revolution\", Norman Ernest Borlaug was born on a farm near Cresco, Iowa, to Henry and Clara Borlaug. An eclectic, pragmatic, goal-oriented scientist, he accepts and discards methods or results in a constant search for more fruitful and effective ones, while at the same time avoiding the pursuit of what he calls \"academic butterflies\". A vigorous man who can perform prodigies of manual labor in the fields, he brings to his work the body and competitive spirit of the trained athlete, which indeed he was in his high school and college days. After completing his primary and secondary education in Cresco, Borlaug enrolled in the University of Minnesota where he studied forestry. Immediately before and immediately after receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in 1937, he worked for the U.S. Forestry Service at stations in Massachusetts and Idaho. Returning to the University of Minnesota to study plant pathology, he received the master's degree in 1939 and the doctorate in 1942.\n\nIn 1944 he accepted an appointment as geneticist and plant pathologist assigned the task of organizing and directing the Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program in Mexico. This program was a joint undertaking by the Mexican government and the Rockefeller Foundation. Within twenty years he was spectacularly successful in finding a high-yielding short-strawed, disease-resistant wheat.\n\nIt was on the research stations and farmers' fields of Mexico that Dr. Borlaug developed successive generations of wheat varieties with broad and stable disease resistance, broad adaptation to growing conditions across many degrees of latitude, and with exceedingly high yield potential.\n\nThese new wheat varieties and improved crop management practices transformed agricultural production in Mexico during the 1940's and 1950's and later in Asia and Latin America, sparking what today is known as the \"Green Revolution.\n\nImpact on India and Asia\n\nExternal Links\n\nBorlaung's History\n\nWikipeida\n\nNobel Prize Lecture"
