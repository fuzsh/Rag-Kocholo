        "text": "I've listened to Grover Gardner more than my wife\n\nIt might be 50 years old, but William Shirer's book is just as gripping and just as important today as ever. It is amazingly well researched and the perspective of someone that was a close and personal observer to much of the Nazi period.\n\nYes, it is long. At 57 plus hours, my wife reckons I've listened to Grover Gardner more than I've listened to her in 15 years of marriage. But Mr Gardner stays claim and steady throughout and never gets upset at my \"what?\" His narration is absolutely first class. One can't imagine a better combination than Shirer and Gardner.\n\nPersonal impressions or Historical Facts\n\nI don't normally have much interest in books about wars, but bought this book out of a primarily historical interest. I found it well written, interesting, long and perhaps having greater detail than a mediocre level of interest would require. For a general-interest listener, it may be a little too long and cumbersome. However, interest is maintained most of the time. (I am looking forward to getting back to a lighthearted novel now!) :-)\n\nThe audio book is well read by Grover Gardner.\n\nMy only qualm is that - as a listener specifically interested in historical facts - the author intersperses the book with too many of his personal feelings and impressions. Initially, we are bombarded by his concept of Hitler as the village idiot, and later he calls him the \"insane genius\". As a thinking being, I would prefer, after 7 Parts of accurate historical facts, to draw my own conclusions. In all likelihood, Hitler was neither of the two.\n\nThe book is focussed primarily on military history. I would perhaps have enjoyed more about the daily lives of civilians, and what they were experiencing, as opposed to minute military details. But that's just my personal preference, and as i've mentioned - I'm not too interested in wars.\n\nOverall, a very good and interesting read.\n\nThe definitive book on Third Reich and its Men\n\nWhere does The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich rank among all the audiobooks you’ve listened to so far?\n\nWilliam Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is easily among the top five history books I've read or listened to. Too be sure, some of the premier historians of this era, such is Richard Evans, may not agree that my characterization. But in my opinion, the fact that Shirer is a journalist, as distinct from an actual historian, should not be held against him.\n\nShirer's account of the history of the Reich - from the rise of the NSDAP brownshirts in the early 1930s, to the Reichstag fire and the death of the Weimar Republic, to the capture of Austria, Munich, the Battle of Britain, the aborted Operation Sealion, the launching of Barbarossa, and the ultimate dashing of Hitlers ambitions at the gates of Stalingrad and Moscow in 1941 and 1942 - is simply without parallel,\n\nThe book is meticulously researched, and Shirer's presence as a correspondent stationed in Berlin during the late 1930s and early 1940s make his analysis of the events of this period all the more insightful and intriguing. His insights Shirer derives from his first-hand experience in observing and even interacting with many of the leading men of the Party (Rohm, Strasser, etc), the Reich - (Goering, Himmler, etc), and the Wehrmacht - (Halder, Guderian, Kleist, etc.) - may be biased, but they are also brilliant and illuminating.\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich?\n\nThe meeting between Hitler, Ribbentrop, and Molotov to sign the Nazi-Soviet Pact, as British bombers streak overhead. The diary of General Halder. The halting of the Wehrmacht at the gates of Moscow in Dec. 1941. The descriptions of Hitler's speeches to party drones at meetings of the Reichstag, such as it existed at the time, and especially his rebuttal of FDR's letter requesting assurances of his peaceful intentions regarding the countries on his borders. Wow, what a time, and what a tradjedy - kudos to Shirer for recording in a manner that makes it come alive so many decades later.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nFar too long. But it's that good, yes.\n\nAmazing buy for a single credit\n\nWould you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?\n\nabsolutely. It might be too long for some people's taste but it is an entertaining 50+ hours\n\nWhat other book might you compare The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich to and why?\n\nIf you liked listening to Grover Gardner, don't mind at all long audio books, and enjoy history, Shelby Foote's 3 volume history on the American Civil War is another great audiobook.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nI enjoy that Shirer actually put forth concepts about how and why the German's were susceptible to Nazi control of Germany. However these are controversial and critical of the German people of this time which might turn some people off. In a nutshell, Shirer states that the Germans were subservient and use to taking orders w/o question, preferring structure and order to civil liberties, that and Germans love David Hasselhoff.\n\nI learned so much from this book....\n\nWould you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?\n\nThis is a biography which deserves accolade. This seems both balanced and human - drawing from many sources from both sides of the divide. The narrative lays bare the man that symbolizes all that is evil - his strengths and weaknesses. Yet in this man there are fleeting moments of humanity and a vision too unbelievable to imagine of anyone living at that time in the Western world. And his henchmen? How could he dominate and influence these to the extent that he did. How could man have such hatred of fellow man? Hilter was a man steeped in a philosophy that could not be spoken, and he did everything he could to achieve his aims with no sense of what was fair or legal. How a man from so humble origins came thus requires a book like this to string things together. Although only one historical version, a mean feet for the author and the (almost) 'in period' narrator who's diction takes me back to the 50s and 60s. A great listen. I could not stop listening and now I am sorry it has ended. A true classic. I could never have read it.\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich?\n\nThe death of Hitler\n\nWhich character – as performed by Grover Gardner – was your favorite?\n\nMany characters.\n\nWas there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?\n\nMany things.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nAmazing story"
