        "text": "He thus positions his hefty new work as a tool as much as a story and an analysis, for he argues, “Only by examining individual personalities and their stories can we reach an understanding of the perverted morality that made and sustained the Nazi regime, and by doing so perhaps learn some lessons for the troubled era in which we live.”\n\nThat’s it — a few spare sentences in the Introduction and one in the Conclusion. No thumping of the name Trump, no pointing to Putin, no allusions to Orbán. In nearly 500 pages of mini-biographies — Hitler, of course, but also sketches of the principal figures of Nazism, the well-known and the historically near-obscure alike — Evans doesn’t pound home the point, returning to it only in the very last sentence, when he suggests, ever so delicately, “We can perhaps start to recognize the threats that democracy and the assertion of human rights are facing in our own time, and take action to counter them.”\n\nThere is another fashion in which this look backward is a product of our own time, more than three-quarters of a century after the destruction of Nazism and the death of Hitler and the conviction of many of his co-conspirators. The work of his historian colleagues — the opening of old material and discovery of new resources — has provided fresh insights into both the leaders and followers of the movement that sought to conquer Europe and create a modern empire, more enduring and powerful than that of Great Britain, which stood alone in opposing the Axis powers in 1940 until joined by the United States after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nEvans acknowledges that what we might describe as historiography by biography has been discredited in recent decades, for how can we countenance the offshoots of the “great man” approach to history when history’s story has been so thoroughly contaminated by the actions of so-called and self-proclaimed “great men”? Even so, he plugs on, in large measure because we now know so much more about the top figures and the bottom-feeders who made Nazi Germany and unmade democratic Europe.\n\nHe starts with Hitler himself, and in meditations that consume nearly a fifth of the book, begins with a blunt statement: “For the first thirty years of his life, Adolf Hitler was a nobody.” As a World War I combatant he “learned to be hard and ruthless and to be indifferent to suffering and death.” Shortly after the guns were silenced, Hitler was speaking of Jews as carriers of a “racial tuberculous” and was displaying the ability to declaim “in a frenzy of emotion into a quasi-religious apotheosis.” His imprisonment after the failed Beer Hall Putsch wasn’t the onerous experience of legend; he had visitors 524 times in just over a year.\n\nEvans argues that Hitler’s early support came less from business executives (the conventional belief) than from small donors (the new view). He had “a rage and hatred against Socialists and Communists and democrats and indeed virtually everybody who did not support him that also consumed his rank-and-file followers as well as his cheerleaders and acolytes.”\n\nThe remaining pages — large enough to comprise a book on their own — set out those cheerleaders and acolytes.\n\nEvans examines the depths (and often the shallowness) of their antisemitic beliefs and probes how much (and often how little) they were motivated by ideology and hatred and how personal ambition and, in some cases their own lack of purpose, propelled them into the embrace of Nazism — or how they merely drifted into its wretched arms. Evans’s earlier books set out the vicious infighting among top Nazis (and the falling in love with Hitler and falling out of favor with Hitler, as well), but these sketches show the personal tensions and costs.\n\nWe see, for example, how Hermann Göring (the “second man in the Third Reich”) became an ardent prosecutor of the war against the Jews but eventually faded from favor, just as Ernst Röhm (an organizer of the beer-hall episode who had a taste for paramilitary operations) fell out of Hitler’s favor, and how Joseph Goebbels (the propaganda minister who was the object of neither fear not respect) perfected the art of “listening to Hitler’s soul and amplifying it back to him.”\n\nThey are all here: the gaffe-prone Joachim von Rippentrop (chosen as foreign minister “because he would do as he was told”); the ideologue Alfred Rosenberg (who provided “a systemic underpinning for the antisemitism of the Nazi Party); and the execrable Rudolf Hess (who held the empty title of deputy fuhrer and who “found in Hitler and the Nazi movement a cause that would give his life meaning and purpose”). There also are lesser-known characters such as Hans Frank (who mastered the piano music of Chopin and was known as the Butcher of Poland); Wilhelm Ritter Von Leeb (the “quintessentially typical army officer” who nonetheless told Hitler that “German soldiers don’t shoot women and children”); and Karl Brandt (Hitler’s personal physician who eventually imperiled the mentally ill and severely handicapped).\n\nThe verdict: “All of them had choices, none of them was forced to do what they did,” Evans reminds us. “In one way or another, however, they willingly surrendered their moral authority to Hitler.” History may not repeat itself but, as Mark Twain taught us, sometimes it rhymes. And sometimes there are rhymes, but not reason.\n\nHITLER’S PEOPLE: The Faces of the Third Reich\n\nBy Richard J. Evans\n\nPenguin Press, 624 pages, $35"
