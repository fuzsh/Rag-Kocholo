        "text": "Investigating the Holocaust\n\nInvestigating the Holocaust is a series of short videos that trace the history of the Nazi Party from its inception through World War II and the policies that led to the murder of millions of innocent people.\n\nThese short videos are derived from Nuremberg: Its Lesson for Today, a powerful, feature-length documentary film made with restored footage from the 1946 production titled, “Nurnberg.” The videos feature original film footage used as evidence by the International Military Tribunal at the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg, Germany -- the most famous courtroom drama in modern times, and the first to make extensive use of film as evidence.\n\nThe FDR Presidential Library and Museum has also produced an accompanying Curriculum Guide to introduce students to the Holocaust through historical materials drawn from the FDR Library’s archives and this recently remastered documentary.\n\nThe Curriculum Guide can be accessed here»\n\nProduced in 1946-1947 by Stuart Schulberg under the supervision of Pare Lorentz for the U.S. War Department, the “Nurnberg” film presented footage shot during the many months of trials, alongside an array of documentary evidence used by the prosecutors to demonstrate aggression, atrocities, and war crimes committed by the Nazis. The film was released in Germany in 1948, but because of its controversial content, it was not shown in the United States. These new video segments come from a meticulously restored version by filmmaker Sandra Schulberg, daughter of original producer Stuart Schulberg.\n\nInvestigating the Holocaust is part of the Henry Morgenthau Jr. Holocaust Collections Project, a pathfinding initiative to discover and share unique but dispersed Holocaust subject material across the Roosevelt Library’s archival holdings. This video series provides viewers with background historical context and primary source evidence helpful to investigate or analyze the Roosevelt Administration’s response to the Holocaust.\n\nThe documentary has been edited into 14 segments, to be released weekely starting June 19th. Eventually each segment will be linked to thematically-related documents from the Roosevelt Library’s archival collection. Additional primary source material is available for research online in FRANKLIN.\n\nThe Pare Lorentz Center at the FDR Library, with generous funding from the New York Community Trust, created this video series. Special thanks to Sandra Schulberg for permission to use her fully restored documentary."
