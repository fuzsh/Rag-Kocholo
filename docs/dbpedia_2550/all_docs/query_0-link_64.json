        "text": "On Aug. 19, 1934, the German public voted 90 percent in favor of Chancellor Adolf Hitler becoming Führer und Reichskanzler (“leader and chancellor”), a new title created after the death of President Paul von Hindenburg earlier in the month.\n\nIn its front-page report of the voting in The New York Times, Frederick T. Birchall wrote: “The endorsement gives Chancellor Hitler, who four years ago was not even a German citizen, dictatorial powers unequaled in any other country, and probably unequaled in history since the days of Genghis Khan. He has more power than Joseph Stalin in Russia, who has a party machine to reckon with; more power than Premier Mussolini of Italy who shares his prerogative with the titular ruler; more than any American President ever dreamed of.”\n\nThe new position was the culmination of Hitler’s 19-month rise to power that began in January 1933 with his appointment as chancellor. Hitler consolidated his powers through legislative acts such as the March 1933 Enabling Act, which gave Hitler’s cabinet full legislative powers. He also violently eliminated his rivals; less than two months before becoming Führer, he ordered the killing of Ernst Röhm and other leaders of the Nazi paramilitary group the SA, also known as “brownshirts,” in a purge known as the “Night of the Long Knives.”\n\nAs chancellor, Hitler had already started implementing an aggressive foreign policy and a campaign of oppression against the Jewish population, beginning with a call for a boycott of Jewish businesses in April 1933.\n\nHe continued this course of action as Führer. In 1938, the campaign against the Jews became violent, and soon escalated into genocide. In 1939, the Nazi invasion of Poland marked the start of World War II.\n\nHitler’s reign ended in 1945 when he chose to commit suicide rather than surrender to the Allied powers. Today, he and the Third Reich are remembered as the embodiment of evil and as a reminder that unchecked power can have catastrophic consequences.\n\nConnect to Today:\n\nHitler came to power through primarily democratic means, as the German public — devastated by economic ruin after the First World War — was receptive to a strong, nationalist ruler who could restore financial stability and national pride.\n\nIn a 2008 editorial for The New York Times , the Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw asserted that there are some modern “echoes” of Hitler’s rise: “Today, too, skillful politicians around the globe have proved adept at manipulating populist sentiment and using democratic structures to erect forms of personalized, authoritarian rule.”\n\nStill, he argued, today’s neo-fascist movements have no hope of moving beyond the political margins into mainstream power and even the most brutal of modern authoritarian rulers will never wield as much power as Hitler: “But neither in their acquisition of power nor in their use of it do modern authoritarian rulers much resemble Hitler. … Mercifully, what happened in Germany in 1933, and its aftermath, will remain a uniquely terrible episode in history.”\n\nDo you believe it is possible in this day and age for someone to seize full control of a government through democratic means? Or do you think it is unlikely that a leader with as much authority as Hitler will ever be voted into power again?\n\nLearn more about what happened in history on Aug. 19 »"
