        "text": "There are many things that have been and still can be said about this vile book. What I wish to point to is that Mein Kampf reveals how Imperial Japan’s emergence as a modern industrial power challenged the extreme racial hierarchy of human beings Hitler defended. How could such a fanatical racist as Hitler, world history’s most unflinching advocate of “Aryanism,” explain Japan’s ascent?\n\nA close reading of the text clarifies Hitler’s muddled, yet undeniably sincere attempts to resolve this conundrum, irresolvable within his biologistic framework. He admitted that during the Russo-Japanese War, he had supported Japan, having done so for purely racial reasons (a defeat for Tsarist Russia weakened the principal supporter of the Slavs, a group he despised, living under Habsburg rule). However, he went on to explicitly praise Japanese naval policy. “There, on principle, the entire emphasis was laid on giving every single new ship superior fighting power over the presumable adversary. The result was a greater possibility of offensive utilization of the navy,” Hitler wrote. These words indicate he followed the concerns among the imperialist states, especially the United States, about the size and capability of the Japanese navy, which led to the 1921-22 Washington Naval Conference—and sympathized with Japan.\n\nLater in the text, Hitler, seemingly self-conscious of what his comments about Japan portended for his wretched racial theories, proposed a threefold categorization of humankind. “If we were to divide mankind into three groups the founders of culture, the bearers of culture, the destroyers of culture,” he stated, “only the Aryan could be considered as the representative of the first group.” Blithely dismissing all contrary evidence from the study of the human past, Hitler attributed to the “Aryan” the chief role of creating culture and civilization around the globe throughout history. “From him originate the foundations and walls of all human creation, and only the outward form and color are determined by the changing traits of character of the various peoples. He provides the mightiest building stones and plans for all human progress and only the execution corresponds to the nature of the varying men and races.” This analogy with construction served him so as to solely credit the essential structures of civilizations to “Aryans.”\n\nThat same analogy also allowed Hitler some room for maneuver to accommodate Japan’s modernization. The Nazi leader asserted, “In a few decades, for example, the entire east of Asia will possess a culture whose ultimate foundation will be Hellenic spirit and Germanic technology, just as much as in Europe. Only the outward form—in part at least—will bear the features of Asiatic character.” Thus, only the non-essential elements of Imperial Japan’s newly acquired international status actually derived from Japanese culture itself. Hitler characterized this situation as one where “European science and technology are trimmed with Japanese characteristics.”\n\nHe elaborated, “the present Japanese development owes its life to Aryan origin.” Referring back to the American Commodore Matthew Perry’s 1853 expedition to open Japan to commerce, the “progress” made by Japanese society owed everything to “Aryan” initiative. Merely the surface aspects of this society, ran the so-called logic of this argument, bore fundamentally Japanese traits. “If beginning today,” Hitler predicted, “all further Aryan influence on Japan should stop, assuming that Europe and America should perish, Japan’s present rise in science and technology might continue for a short time; but even in a few years the well would dry up, the Japanese special character would gain, but the present culture would freeze and sink back into the slumber from which it was awakened seven decades ago by the wave of Aryan culture.”\n\nFully evident in Mein Kampf are the contortions Hitler undertook to square Japan’s “present rise” with his reprehensible dogma of the innate inferiority of non-Aryan peoples. Of utmost importance, though, is that recognition of the twists taken in these passages shows us how Hitler could appreciate and admire what the Japanese achieved. Elsewhere in the memoir, he praised, against criticisms he thought emanated from Britain’s Jewish community, the project of building a “Japanese national state” then in motion. Here he sounded much like figures like Haushofer.\n\nLooking ahead to 1933 and beyond, Hitler’s ability to secure conceptual space within his worldview for explaining Japan’s success while retaining the racist analytic of superiority/inferiority remained. Yet, strikingly, Hitler’s approbation for the Japanese waxed during this period. Soon he seemed convinced that a whole range of elements of Japan’s political, economic, and military power flowed from its own distinctive culture. The relation of “foundations and wall” to “trim” and “execution” did reverse to some degree in his thinking.\n\nUndoubtedly, the onset of the Shōwa Era with the coronation of Hirohito as emperor in 1926, the subsequent crushing of the Japanese Left, the entrenchment of ultra-nationalists in many spheres of the country’s life, most prominently its military, and the move into Manchuria in 1931 fostered Hitler’s enthusiasm for a Berlin-Tokyo Axis in the mid-1930s. Though, to my knowledge, he never repudiated the perspective set forth in Mein Kampf, he acquiesced in effect to some real revision of his racism to justify this alliance. Showing that is the aim of two future articles.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nHitler, Adolf. Mein Kampf. Translated by Ralph Manheim. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1943.\n\nLaw, Ricky W.
