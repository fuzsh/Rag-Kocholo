Provides a new perspective on the relationship between the DNVP and the Jews, and particularly on the Nazis’ intense animosity against the DNVP and the bourgeoisie.” · Stanley G. Payne, Hilldale-Jaume Vicens Vives Professor Emeritus of History, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nDescription\n\nOn 30 January 1933, Alfred Hugenberg's conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) formed a coalition government with the Nazi Party, thus enabling Hitler to accede to the chancellorship. This book analyzes in detail the complicated relationship between Conservatives and Nazis and offers a re-interpretation of the Nazi seizure of power - the decisive months between 30 January and 14 July 1933. The Machtergreifung is characterized here as a period of all-pervasive violence and lawlessness with incessant conflicts between Nazis and German Nationals and Nazi attacks on the conservative Bürgertum, a far cry from the traditional depiction of the takeover as a relatively bloodless, virtually sterile assumption of power by one vast impersonal apparatus wresting control from another. The author scrutinizes the revolutionary character of the Nazi seizure of power, the Nazis' attacks on the conservative Bürgertum and its values, and National Socialism's co-optation of conservative symbols of state power to serve radically new goals, while addressing the issue of why the DNVP was complicit in this and paradoxically participated in eroding the foundations of its very own principles and bases of support.\n\nHermann Beck is Professor of History at the University of Miami, where he teaches German and Modern European History. He has been a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and a Fellow at the Berliner Historische Kommission. The author of The Origins of the Authoritarian Welfare State in Prussia: Conservatives, Bureaucracy, and the Social Question, 1815-1870, he has also contributed articles to American and European journals, including among others, The Journal of Modern History, The Journal of Contemporary History, Central European History, and German History.\n\nSubject: History: 20th Century to Present\n\nArea: EuropeGermany\n\nSubject Codes\n\nLC: DD240 .B3389 2008\n\nBL: YK.2009.a.3594\n\nBISAC:\n\nHIS014000 HISTORY/Europe/Germany;\n\nHIS037070 HISTORY/Modern/20th Century\n\nBIC:\n\nHBLW 20th century history: c 1900 to c 2000;\n\nHBJD European history\n\nContents\n\nExpand ToC\n\nPreface\n\nIntroduction\n\nChapter 1.
