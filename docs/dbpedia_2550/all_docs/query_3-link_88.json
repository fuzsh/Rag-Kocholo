        "text": "In recent years, many victims of violence have written memoirs in which they seek out and confront the perpetrators who harmed them. The opposite is rare. Few perpetrators seek out their victims, let alone write books about them. But fifty years ago this month, Melita Maschmann, a former Nazi, published just such a book.\n\n“Fazit,” which was translated as “Account Rendered” in 1964, is the memoir of a woman who, as a fifteen-year-old and against her family’s wishes, joined the Hitler Youth. Before and during the Second World War, Maschmann worked in the high echelons of press and propaganda of the Bund Deutscher Mädel, the girls’ section of the Nazi youth organization, and, later, she supervised the eviction of Polish farmers and the resettlement of ethnic Germans on their farms. Arrested in 1945 at the age of twenty-seven, she completed a mandatory de-Nazification course and became a freelance journalist.\n\nSoon after her release from internment in 1948, Maschmann wrote a letter to a Jewish former classmate with whom she had the kind of passionate friendship common among adolescent girls. She didn’t know if her friend had made it out of Berlin before the war, or if her mother (whose address she had obtained) would pass the letter on. “I don’t know if it reached you,” the author writes. “Since then I have often continued my conversation with you, awake and in dreams, but I have never tried to write any of it down. Now, today, I feel impelled to do so. I was prompted to this by a trivial incident. A woman spoke to me in the street and the way she held her head suddenly reminded me quite strikingly of you. But what is the real reason which made me sit down and write to you as soon as I came in? Perhaps in the intervening years I have, without being aware of it, prepared an account within me which must be presented.”\n\n“Account Rendered” is written in the form of a second book-length letter. “With you as a witness,” the author writes, in a painful, exhaustive, seemingly scrupulous portrait of her younger self, “I should like to try once more to go over the result of my reflections on the past. You will compel me to be much more precise than I could be if left to myself.”\n\nMaschmann is acutely aware that her friend might view her project as self-justifying, but writes, “Even the element of fate in a person’s life does not dispose of individual guilt, I know that. What I hope, dare to hope, is that you might be able to understand—not excuse—the wrong and even evil steps which I took and which I must report, and that such an understanding might form the basis for a lasting dialogue.”\n\nMaschmann elaborated on her purpose to Hannah Arendt in 1963, in a letter that expressed her desire to help former Nazi colleagues reflect on their actions, and to help others “better understand” why people like her had been drawn to Hitler. (Their brief correspondence can be read online.)\n\nA deft writer and practiced propagandist who understood the power of a vivid quote, detail, or anecdote, Maschmann portrayed herself as a girl who came of age in a culture imbued with the shame of Germany’s defeat in the First World War. “Before I understood the meaning of the word ‘Germany,’ I loved it as something mysteriously overshadowed with grief…,” she writes. Her wealthy parents, avid newspaper readers and members of the conservative German National Party, complained about “the chaotic squabbling of Parliament” and the millions of people out of work, but had a sign affixed to their door that read “No Hawkers or Beggars.” Melita sympathized with them, and with the maid, chauffeur, and house seamstress. The latter wore an embossed metal swastika under the lapel of her coat, spoke movingly of Hitler, and was instrumental in Melita’s resolve “to follow a different road from the conservative one prescribed for me by family tradition.” The book documents twelve years of following that road.\n\n“Account Rendered” appeared at a time when Arendt’s phrase “the banality of evil” was making its way into public conversation, and while the West German parliament was debating the statute of limitations on crimes committed by Nazis. Some critics found the text candid and forthright; others considered it defensive, prevaricating, and melodramatic. Some of Maschmann’s former colleagues, Nazis who were issued kerosene with which to burn their documents at the end of the war, viewed it as a betrayal, and never forgave her for writing it.\n\nIn Germany, the book went through eight editions (the last in 1987) and was added to high-school reading lists in some school districts. It became part of Germany’s private, public, and scholarly debates over its own history. Historians of the Nazi period—Daniel Goldhagen and Claudia Koonz, among others—used “Account Rendered” as a primary source. Women’s studies researchers tried to discover in it the mentality of a female perpetrator. Students of memoir used the text to showcase the vagaries of personal narrative; sociologists looked for a relation between the literary work and the cultural setting from which it arose. Some readers questioned Maschmann’s reliability as a narrator, her motivation, and whether or not she was representative of ordinary Germans. They theorized about the Jewish friend to whom the memoir is addressed: Was she a construct, a composite, or a reality?\n\nNo one could answer those questions, because soon after the book’s publication, its author effectively disappeared from public view. She had found a guru, Sri Anandamayi Ma, a woman venerated as a “living saint,” in India. Maschmann took a Hindu name, lived in Indian ashrams, and returned to Germany only on brief family visits every two or three years.\n\nI had never heard of Melita Maschmann until a friend, the former editor Arthur Samuelson, described “Account Rendered” as one of the most interesting memoirs he had ever read. My husband and I republish classic non-fiction as e-books at Plunkett Lake Press, and we were intrigued. “I found in the memoir someone who had been overtaken by history,” Samuelson told me. “Someone who was struggling to make sense of what no longer made sense, and to understand why it had once done so. And someone whose best self had been attracted to Nazism.”\n\nWe read the book and began to research its history.\n\nFirst, we located Maschmann’s remaining family in Germany and France. According to her sister-in-law, now in her nineties, Maschmann had trouble finding friends and establishing a postwar life. She travelled, took some university courses, and freelanced for newspapers. In 1962, she toured Afghanistan and India and, after publishing her memoir, decided to leave Germany.\n\nAmong the scholars who continue to be intrigued by Maschmann is Dagmar Reese, the author of “Growing Up Female in Nazi Germany.” She recalled that she had come across a footnote in an essay by the late Irmgard Klönne suggesting that Maschmann’s Jewish friend was not a literary construct but an actual person: Marianne Schweitzer, the daughter of the physician Ernst Schweitzer and Franziska Körte Schweitzer of Berlin. We located her at her home in La Jolla, California, and she almost hung up when we called, thinking we were telemarketers.\n\nAt ninety-five, Schweitzer is an impressively sharp, brisk, and busy woman, who attends a weekly yoga class and still volunteers at the San Diego Museum of Man. She told us that in the spring of 1933, when she had just turned fifteen and was failing Latin and math, her mother had her transferred to a new high school, where Melita became her best friend. They did their homework together, discussed literature, and exchanged confidences. “Melita was quick, articulate, and gregarious—a joiner,” Schweitzer recalled. “She was bored at home with her conventional and conservative parents, and joining the Nazis was a way for her to rebel against them. I came from a more progressive, artistic family, and I was more of a loner, a listener and observer.”\n\nAt first, Marianne and Melita agreed about politics. “We were both idealistic Weltverbesserer who wanted to make the world better, except that she wanted to improve the German Nazi world while I wanted to improve all of mankind. Gradually, these discussions erupted into serious conflict. Melita joined the B.D.M., the Hitler youth organization for girls, and became what I call a hundred-and-fifty-per-cent Nazi. I was horrified. She persuaded me to attend meetings where Hitler would speak; her intent was to have me convert. I told her in no uncertain terms that he sounded like a hysterical fanatic and that I couldn’t understand how an educated, highly intelligent person like her could possibly be impressed by him. She told me that I was not able to appreciate his greatness because I had Jewish blood.”\n\nEighty years later, Marianne recalls that she found this remark ridiculous. Until 1932, she hadn’t known she “had Jewish blood.” The Schweitzers observed Christmas and Easter, and belonged to the Lutheran Church. Her mother’s family was Aryan by Hitler’s standards, but that year her father revealed that his parents were Jews who had been baptized as adults. The family’s prospects dramatically changed.\n\nAs a Mischling, or “half-Jew,” Marianne was allowed to remain in school. In 1936, Melita suddenly disappeared. Marianne recalls being devastated that Melita had left without a word, and pressed Dr. Flashar, their favorite teacher, for answers. The Maschmanns, she explained, had decided that Melita needed more rigorous academic preparation for her Abitur (end-of-school exam), and had transferred her to a boarding school. (In the memoir, Maschmann writes that they sent her away to curtail her Nazi activities.)\n\nIn the fall of 1937, Melita reappeared to the Schweitzers, asking to renew the friendship. In “Account Rendered,” she admits that the Gestapo had enlisted her to spy on the family, who were suspected of hosting an anti-Nazi group in their home.\n\nOn the evening of November 1st, a contingent of Gestapo men entered and searched the Schweitzers’ house. There was no secret meeting, but Marianne’s older sister was arrested for conspiracy to commit high treason and was sent to a concentration camp, where she remained until July, 1938. Their mother was also arrested, and was released after a week. “I fetched her from prison and will never forget how shabby she looked and how badly she smelled,” Marianne wrote me. “I still feel ashamed to have been so repelled by her appearance.”\n\nDuring Kristallnacht, in November, 1938, Ernst Schweitzer was arrested and badly beaten, and Franziska Körte Schweitzer redoubled her efforts to get the family out of Germany. Most of them wanted to remain in Berlin, but Marianne, remembering family friends who had visited from America when she was a child, had long dreamed about California. She and her father left for England in 1939, and Marianne learned of the outbreak of the Second World War onboard an ocean liner to New York. Her elder sister stayed behind, married an Aryan, and gave birth to two children before the war’s end. One of their brothers died fighting for Germany on the Russian front. Her parents and remaining brother got to New York by the end of the war. During those six years, Marianne went to school. She attended Bryn Mawr on a scholarship for three years, graduated, then obtained a master’s in anthropology from Yale in 1945. She had married and was forgetting her German when, in October of 1948, her mother passed on Melita’s first letter.\n\n“Eleven years of world history have passed,” Melita wrote. “Then we were children, now we are people who have been marked by life… Is it possible to go back to the great friendship of our youth?”\n\nMarianne doesn’t remember exactly how she felt when she received the letter, but she did not answer it. In February, June, and August of 1950, she received more letters, in which Melita confessed to spying and wrote, “I have always been ashamed about what happened in 1937.” And “I am happy that you are in the U.S. and say nix to all things German while I try to heal the breaks with people and renew our friendship.”\n\nIn 1954, Marianne moved to Panama, where her husband worked for a U.N. agency and she taught German at the National University. In 1963, she and several other Latin American German instructors were invited by the Goethe Institute to visit Germany. Melita had maintained contact with members of Marianne’s family who had remained there; she begged Marianne to visit. In the spring of 1963, just before “Account Rendered” was published, Melita handed the manuscript to Marianne, who read it and stayed at Melita’s home that night to discuss it.\n\n“To say our meeting did not go too well would be an understatement,” Marianne told me. “I was utterly shocked by what I read. I hadn’t realized the extent of her activities during the war. I was confused, hurt, overwhelmed, and unable to talk about it. She cried when we said good-bye. I did not. In retrospect, I would say she behaved in a direct, straightforward way, and I did not. I never saw her again.”\n\nMarianne moved back to the United States and, in 1964, became an instructor of German at the University of California. She felt disinclined to enter into the emotional turmoil of a relationship with Melita, “even though she kept on writing to me from India, where she became a disciple of an Indian guru. I rejected her attempts to renew our relationship and, though I remained fond of my German relatives, I rejected Germany.”\n\nMarianne did not write about herself until 2006, when, at the age of eighty-eight, she was going through her papers and came upon Melita’s letters. She extracted what interested her, typed it up, and threw out the originals. “I didn’t think they would be of interest to anyone. I am now very sorry that I didn’t keep at least one. Thinking about it now, eighty years after we met, I can say that Melita’s betrayal and Hitler’s destruction of what I valued in Germany are reasons why I do not think of myself as a German.\n\n“I give her credit for having the courage to write and publish ‘Fazit’ at the time she did. In 1963, nobody I met admitted to having been a Nazi. She may have been the first German, and certainly the first German woman, who tried to face her past with honesty. No other book at that time said, unequivocally, ‘I was a Nazi, and here’s why.’ I am certainly treated well in her memoir, with insight and respect. Melita eventually came to be horrified by Nazism, and I believe she really meant the book as an apology.”\n\nMelita Maschmann died in Germany in 2010, after suffering for over a decade from Alzheimer’s. She never married and had no children.\n\nHelen Epstein blogs for artfuse.org and is the author of six books, including “Where She Came From: A Daughter’s Search for her Mother’s History” and “Children of the Holocaust.” Melita Maschmann’s “Account Rendered” is published by Plunkett Lake Press.\n\nAbove: Hulton Archive/Getty"
