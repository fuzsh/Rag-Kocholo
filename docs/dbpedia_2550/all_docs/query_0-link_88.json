        "text": "Camps in which people were imprisoned without regard to the accepted norms of detention. An essential part of Nazi systematic oppression, they were constructed almost immediately after Hitler came to power in Germany. They were used for the imprisonment of all “enemies of the Third Reich.” In the beginning (1933-1936), the camps primarily imprisoned political and ideological opponents of the regime, (e.g. Communists, Social Democrats et.al.) Later (1936-1942), Concentration Camps were expanded and non-political prisoners (e.g. Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, handicapped and other “asocials”). The extensive camp system of over 9000 camps and sub-camps included labor camps, transit camps, prisoner of war (POW) camps and extermination camps. Death, disease, starvation, crowded and unsanitary conditions and torture were a daily part of concentration camp life.\n\nWhen the German army was trapped between the Soviet Army to the east and the advancing Allied troops from the west, the Germans evacuated the camps in 1944 and forced the prisoners to march westward to Germany. During these marches the Jews were starved, brutalized, and killed. Few survived the experience; the paths traveled were littered with bodies. Although death marches occurred throughout the war, the largest and deadliest occurred during the last phase. It is estimated that 250,000 died in death marches between the summer of 1944 and the end of the war, in May 1945.\n\nSS officer, head of the “Jewish section” of the Gestapo. He participated in the Wannsee Conference (January 20, 1942) and was Instrumental in implementing the “Final Solution” by organizing the transportation of Jews to death camps from all over Europe. At the end of World War II he was arrested in the American zone of Berlin. However, he escaped, went underground, and disappeared. On May 11, 1960, members of the Israeli Secret Service uncovered his whereabouts and smuggled him to Israel from Argentina. Eichmann was tried in Jerusalem (April-December 1961), convicted and sentenced to death. He was executed on May 31, 1962.\n\nMobile killing squads of the Security Police and SS Security Service. They consisted of four units (A,B,C, D), and followed the German armies into the Soviet Union in June 1941. Their task was to kill all Jews, mental and defectives and Soviets. They were supported by units of the uniformed German Order Police and auxiliaries of volunteers from (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Ukraine). Their victims were executed by shooting and were buried in mass graves from which they were later exhumed and burned. At leaset 1.3 million Jews were killed in this manner.\n\nAn Itallian word, it refers to a quarter or street separated from the other parts of the city, in which Jews lived in the Middle Ages. The Nazis revived the Italian medieval ghetto and created their compulsory “Jewish Quarter” (Wohnbezirk), where all Jews from the surrounding areas were forced to reside. The ghettos, surrounded by barbed wire or walls, were overcrowded, unsanitary and sealed from the world without food, medicine and heat. Daily, people died in the streets from starvation and disease. The Germans constantly harassed the Jewish residents of the ghetto, randomly seizing people on the streets, raiding their apartments, and subjecting them to beatings and humiliation, leaving them to die in the streets. The ghettos were established mainly in Eastern Europe (e.g. Lodz, Warsaw, Vilna, Riga, Minsk). All ghettos were eventually liquidated and the Jews, Gypsies and others were deported to extermination camps.\n\nJoined the Nazi party in 1924, and in 1933, became Hitler’s Minister of Propaganda and Public Information. He decided that “all un-German” books would be burned on May 10, 1933. He controlled the media and was also one of the creators of the “Fuhrer” (the leader) myth, an important element in the Nazis’ successful plan for support by the masses. He supervised the publication of Der Sturmer and conducted the propaganda campaign against the Jews. On the day followiong Hitler’s death, Goebbels and his wife committed suicide in Hitler’s bunker, after first ordering the murder of their six children, all under the age of thirteen.\n\nDeputy and close aide of Hitler from the earliest days of the Nazi movement, who participated in Hitler’s “Beer Hall Putsch” (the failed attempt by Hitler and his associates to overthrow the German Weimar Republic on November 9, 1923). Hess believed he could persuade the British to make peace with Hitler. To further his idea Hess flew to Scotland prior to Hitler’s invasion of the former Soviet Union. Arrested by the British, Hitler promptly declared Hess insane. Hess was tried at Nuremberg, found guilty, and sentenced to life in prison. He was the only prisoner in the Spandau prison in Berlin, Germany, until he committed suicide in 1987.\n\nFormer naval officer who joined the SS in 1932, after his dismissal from the German Navy. He headed the Reich Security, which included the Gestapo, and organized the Einsatzgruppen, which systematically murdered Jews in occupied Russia during 1941-1942. Heydrich was appointed Governor of Bohemia and Moravia and was asked by Goring to implement the “Final Solution” to the “Jewish Question.” In January 1942 Heydrich presided over the Wannsee Conference, where the implementation of the “Final Solution” was discussed. On May 29, 1942 Heydrich was assasinated near Prague, by a member of the Czech resistance. In retaliation the Nazis destroyed the Czech town of Lidice and murdered all its men. To honor Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazis gave the code name “Operation Reinhard” to the destruction of Polish Jewry.\n\nFuhrer und reichskanzler (Leader and Reich Chancellor). Although born in Austria, he settled in Germany in 1913. At the outbreak of World War I, Hitler enlisted in the Bavarian Army, became a corporal and received the Iron Cross First Class for bravery. Returning to Munich after the war, he joined the newly formed German Workers Party, whichc was soon reorganized, under his leadership, as the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP). In November 1923, he unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly bring Germany under nationalist control. When his coup, known as the “Beer-Hall Putsch,” failed, Hitler was arrested and sentenced to 5 years in prison. It was during this time that he wrote Mein Kampf. Serving only 9 months of his sentence, Hitler quickly reentered German politics and soon outpolled his political rivals in national elections. In January 1933, Paul vom Hindenburg (Reich President) appointed Hitler chancellor of a coalition cabinet. Hitler, who took office on January 30, 1933, immediately set up a dictatorship. In 1934, the chancellorship and presidency were united in the person of the Fuhrer. Soon, all other parties were outlawed and opposition was brutally suppressed. In addition, he initiated antisemitic policies and programs. By 1938, Hitler implemented his dream of a “Greater Germany,” by the annexation of Austria, the Sudetenland and, finally, Czechoslovakia itself. On September 1, 1939, Hitler’s armies invaded Poland. By this time western democracies realized that no agreement with Hitler could be honored and World War II had begun. Although initially victorious on all fronts, Hitler’s armies suffered setbacks after the United States joined the war in December 1941. The war was obviously lost by early 1945, but Hitler insisted that Germany fight to the death. On April 30, 1945, Hitler committed suicide rather than be captured alive.\n\nA religious sect, originating in the United States, and organized by Charles Taze Russell. The Witnesses base their beliefs on the Bible and have no official ministers. Recognizing only the kingdom of God, they refuse to swear allegiance to any worldly power; to salute the flag; to bear arms in war; and to participate in the affairs of government. Therefore, the Witnesses were persecuted as “enemies of the state.” About 10,000 Witnesses from Germany and other countries were imprisoned in concentration camps during World War II. Of these, about 2,500 died.\n\nPoland’s second largest city. The Lodz economy was based on the textile industry, much of which was established by the local Jewish population. Home to a large Jewish working class, Lodz was a center for Jewish culture and social political activities. On September 8, 1939, the Germans occupied Lodz, and on April 11, 1940 renamed the city Litzmannstadt, after the German general Karl Litzmann who had conquered it in World War I. In April 1940, Lodz became the site of the first major ghetto established by the Nazis, who forced all Jews from Lodz and the surrounding areas into the ghetto. The Lodz Ghetto was sevely overcrowded and lacked food, medicine and heat. Daily people died of starvation and disease. In January 1942, the Germans began raiding the ghetto and rounding up Jews for deportation to the Chelmno Extemination Camp. By September 1942, the ghetto was almost empty. Only able bodied men and women were kept alive for forced labor. In the spring of 1944 the Germans liquidated the ghetto, clearing street by street and transporting the remaining Jews to the Auschwitz Concentration Camp and to the Chelmno Extemination Camp. The ghetto was liquidated by the fall of 1944.\n\nAdolf Hitler’s autobiography, written in 1924 during his imprisonment in the Landsberg prison for his role in the “Beer Hall Putsch” (the failed attempt by Hitler and his associates to overthrow the German Weimar Republic on November 9, 1923). In his book, Hitler details his plan for the future of Germany, including his foreign policy and his racial ideology to make Europe judenrein (“Jew-free.”) The Germans, belonging to the “superior” Aryan race, have a right to living space (Lebensraum) in the East, which is inhabited by “inferior” Slavs. Throughout the book, Hitler accuses the Jews of being the source of all evil. Unfortunately, most of the people who read Mein Kampf (except for Hitler’s admirers) did not take him seriously and believed the book to be the ravings of a maniac.\n\nSS physician at Auschwitz from 1943-1944 who conducted inhuman medical experiments, especially on twins and Gypsies. Mengele used human beings as “guinea pigs” and subjected them to x-rays, mutilations, diseases and toxic injections. Inmates called him the “Angel of Death” because he, by a simple gesture of his hand pointing to the left or right, would seal a new arrival’s fate. Those considered too weak or too old were sent to the gas chambers; those whom he considered able to work were sent to concentration or labor camps. After the war, Mengele spent time in a British internment hospital but disappeared, went underground, escaped to Argentina and later to Paraguay, where he became a citizen in 1959. He was hunted by Interpol, Israeli agents, and Simon Wiesenthal. In July 1985, forensic experts in Brazil exhumed the body of a man who died in 1979 in a drowning accident and they identified him as Mengele.\n\nGerman Protestant Pastor who headed the Confessing Church during the Nazi regime. During World War I Niemoeller distinguished himself in the German Navy. He was ordained as a minister in 1924, and in 1931, became pastor of Dahlem parish in Berlin, where his naval fame and his preaching drew large crowds. In 1937, he assumed leadership of the Confessing Church. Subsequently, he was arrested for \"malicious attacks on the state,\" given a token sentence and made to pay a small fine. After he was released, he was re-arrested on direct orders from Adolf Hitler. He spent the next seven years in Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps, usually in solitary confinement. Despite this, at the beginning of World War II, the patriotic Niemoeller offered his services to the German Navy, but was refused. In 1945, he was released by the Allies, and became an avowed pacifist who supported a neutral, disarmed and unified Germany. The following statement is attributed (but never recorded officially) to Martin Niemoeller and authenticated by Niemoeller's second wife and widow, Sibylle Niemoeller. Taken from the The Christian Century, Dec. 14, 1994, v. 111, n. 36, p. 1207(1):\n\n\"First they came for the communists, but I was not a communist--so I said nothing. Then they came for the social democrats, but I was not a social democrat--so I did nothing. Then came the trade unionists, but I was not a trade unionist. And then they came for the Jews, but I was not a Jew-- I did little. Then when they came for me, there was no one left who could stand up for me.\"\n\nTwo anti-Jewish statutes enacted in September 1935 during the Nazi party's national convention in Nuremberg. The first, the Reich Citizenship Law, deprived German Jews of their citizenship and all pertinent, related rights. The second, the Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor, outlawed marriages of Jews and non-Jews, forbade Jews from employing German females of childbearing age, and prohibited Jews from displaying the German flag. Many additional regulations were attached to the two main statutes, which provided the basis for removing Jews from all spheres of German political, social, and economic life. The Nuremberg Laws carefully established definitions of Jewishness based on bloodlines. Thus, many Germans of mixed ancestry, called \"Mischlinge,\" faced antisemitic discrimination if they had a Jewish grandparent.\n\nA ficticious, infamous publication written in Paris, in 1894, by members of the Russian Secret Police who claimed to offer conclusive evidence of the existence of a Jewish conspiracy to take over the world by creating feuds among Christians, corrupting and undermining established systems. The Protocols were adapted from a nineteenth century French satire by a French lawyer Maurice Joly against Napoleon III (Dialogue aux enfers entre Montesquieu et Machiavel – Dialogue in Hell between Montesquieu and Machiavelli. Brussels: 1864). Although it has long been repudiated as an absurd and hateful lie, the protocols are still being published and distributed around the world by white supremacists and others who are committed to intolerance and the hatred of Jews.\n\nA cattle boat carrying 769 Jewish refugees, which left Constanta, Romania in December 1941, bound for Palestine (pre 1948 Israel), which was governed by the British mandate. Having been promised entry visas for Palestine, the Struma docked in Istanbul, Turkey. Upon arrival, there were no visas for them. The British did not grant the refugees visas and the Turkish authorities refused to transfer them to a transit camp until other arrangements would be made. On February 23, 1942 the Struma was tugged by the Turkish police, with no food, water or fuel on board, out to the Black Sea, where it was struck erroneously by a torpedo from a Soviet submarine. Only one passanger survived.\n\nEstablished in early 1942 outside Prague as a \"model\" ghetto, Terezin was not a sealed section of town, but rather an eighteenth-century Austrian garrison. It became a Jewish town, governed and guarded by the SS. When the deportations from central Europe to the extermination camps began in the spring of 1942, certain groups were initially excluded: invalids; partners in a mixed marriage, and their children; and prominent Jews with special connections. These were sent to the ghetto in Terezin. They were joined by old and young Jews from the Protectorate, and, later, by small numbers of prominent Jews from Denmark and Holland. Its large barracks served as dormitories for communal living; they also contained offices, workshops, infirmaries, and communal kitchens. The Nazis used Terezin to deceive public opinion. They tolerated a lively cultural life of theatre, music, library, lectures, art and sports. Thus, it could be shown to officials of the International Red Cross. In reality, however, Terezin was only a station on the road to the extermination camps; about 88,000 were deported to their deaths in the East. In April 1945, only 17,000 Jews remained in Terezin, where they were joined by 14,000 Jewish concentration camp prisoners, evacuated from camps threatened by the Allied armies. On May 8, 1945, Terezin was liberated by the Red Army. (see BAECK, LEO)."
