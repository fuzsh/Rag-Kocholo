Any discussion of taxes represents general information and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice. Tax laws or regulations are subject to change at any time and can have a substantial impact on an actual client situation. Seventy2 Capital will be happy to coordinate with your tax and legal professionals.\n\n**Insurance products are available through non-bank insurance agency affiliates of Wells Fargo & Company and underwritten by non-affiliated Insurance Companies. Not available in all states.\n\n***Trust Services are available through Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Member FDIC and Wells Fargo Delaware Trust Company, N.A. Wells Fargo Advisors and its affiliates do not provide legal or tax advice. Any estate plan should be reviewed by an attorney who specializes in estate planning and is licensed to practice law in your state.\n\nAn investmentâ€™s social policy could cause it to forgo opportunities to gain exposure to certain industries, companies, sectors or regions of the economy which could cause it to underperform similar portfolios that do not have a social policy. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will be successful. Risks associated with investing in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)-related strategies can also include a lack of consistency in approach and a lack of transparency in manager methodologies. Some ESG investments may be dependent on government tax incentives and subsidies and on political support for certain environmental technologies and companies. There may also be challenges such as a limited number of issuers and the lack of a robust secondary market. There are many factors to consider when choosing an investment portfolio and ESG data is only one of those components. Investors should not place undue reliance on ESG principles when selecting an investment.\n\nPursuant to Missouri regulation, the provision of investment advice, products and management to Missouri clients based on environmental, social, governance (ESG) or other values-based nonfinancial factors requires certain disclosures and a written client consent. Consequently, investment advice relating to ESG-focused investment products and services, including those referenced above, will not be provided to Missouri residents unless the residents provide the applicable written consent."
