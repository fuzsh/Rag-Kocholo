As I use this card, I can not only earn rewards, but also get closer to meeting my financial goals.” — Re’Dreyona Walker, Editor, Credit Cards\n\nWhat we love: Few cash rewards cards earn 2 percent back on purchases, but this one does, making it one of Wells Fargo’s best credit cards. Plus, there's a low spending requirement to earn the welcome bonus, and you’ll have access to many valuable perks and protections, including Visa Signature® benefits.\n\nLearn more: Wells Fargo Active Cash benefits guide\n\nAlternatives: The Discover it® Cash Back could offer more cash back earning opportunities for people who want to maximize their rewards earnings in rotating spending categories.\n\nPros\n\nThe card has no annual fee and a respectable welcome bonus.\n\nYou can easily redeem cash rewards for a statement credit.\n\nCons\n\nIt has an intro balance transfer fee that increases from 3 percent to up to 5 percent if you don’t transfer a balance within the first 120 days of account opening (minimum of $5).\n\nThe 3 percent foreign currency conversion fee will be disappointing to people who enjoy traveling abroad.\n\nSelect “Apply Now” to take advantage of this specific offer and learn more about product features, terms and conditions.\n\nEarn a $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first 3 months.\n\nEarn unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases.\n\n0% intro APR for 12 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers. 20.24%, 25.24%, or 29.99% Variable APR thereafter; balance transfers made within 120 days qualify for the intro rate and fee of 3% then a BT fee of up to 5%, min: $5.\n\n$0 annual fee.\n\nNo categories to track or remember and cash rewards don't expire as long as your account remains open.\n\nFind tickets to top sports and entertainment events, book travel, make dinner reservations and more with your complimentary 24/7 Visa Signature® Concierge.\n\nUp to $600 of cell phone protection against damage or theft.

Because the Reflect includes the intro APR for both qualifying balance transfers and purchases, it leads the pack among competing credit cards.\n\nLearn more: Is the Wells Fargo Reflect worth it?\n\nAlternatives: The card doesn’t earn any rewards, so it may not be a fit for people who want a card that holds value for the long haul. The Discover it® Balance Transfer Card and its cash back offer on quarterly rotating categories could prove more rewarding for savvy spenders.\n\nPros\n\nThe card has up to $600 in cell phone protection against damage or theft if you use it to pay your monthly phone bill (subject to a $25 deductible).\n\nYou can enroll in Credit Close-Up℠ to get personalized tips on how to improve and maintain your credit score.\n\nCons\n\nThis card charges a 3 percent foreign currency conversion fee, which could prove expensive when using the card abroad.\n\nThe lack of a traditional rewards program limits its long-term value.\n\nSelect \"Apply Now\" to take advantage of this specific offer and learn more about product features, terms and conditions.\n\n0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers. 18.24%, 24.74%, or 29.99% variable APR thereafter; balance transfers made within 120 days qualify for the intro rate, BT fee of 5%, min $5.\n\n$0 Annual Fee.\n\nUp to $600 of cell phone protection against damage or theft.

It earns elevated points on restaurant, travel, gas station, transit, popular streaming services and phone plan purchases, giving cardholders more variety in how they can earn.\n\nLearn more: Wells Fargo Autograph benefits guide\n\nAlternatives: The Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card also earns similar rewards rates in some of the Autograph’s categories for no annual fee. However, the SavorOne shines with its grocery category, which the Autograph notably lacks.\n\nPros\n\nIt has a modest intro APR offer period on purchases, giving it a leg up against competing travel cards.\n\nThe bonus rewards category variety rivals that of other cards, offering unlimited points on those purchases.\n\nCons\n\nPoints are only worth 1 cent each, notably less than other travel cards’ points and miles.\n\nThe Autograph’s welcome offer is much lower than its competitors’ bonuses.\n\nSelect \"Apply Now\" to take advantage of this specific offer and learn more about product features, terms and conditions.\n\nEarn 20,000 bonus points when you spend $1,000 in purchases in the first 3 months - that's a $200 cash redemption value.\n\nEarn unlimited 3X points on the things that really add up - like restaurants, travel, gas stations, transit, popular streaming services, and phone plans.

It carries a reasonable annual fee, earns bonus rewards across all major travel categories and lets you transfer points to airline and hotel partners, making it a great standalone option for frequent and occasional travelers alike.\n\nAlternatives: Since it earns rewards on both general travel spending and at gas stations, the no-annual-fee Wells Fargo Autograph℠ Card may be a better fit if a lot of your travel spending goes toward “everyday travel” like running errands or commuting to work.\n\nPros\n\nIt’s the only Wells Fargo card that lets you transfer rewards to airline and hotel partners, so it’s your best bet if you don’t mind putting in a bit of work to maximize your redemption value.\n\nIt offers a $50 statement credit each year after with a $50 minimum airline purchase — an especially flexible and easy-to-earn annual bonus (many competing cards force you to use credits toward future travel).\n\nCons\n\nIt lacks some popular perks available on other mid-tier rewards cards, like a credit for TSA PreCheck or Clear Plus, so it may not be a perfect fit for all travelers.\n\nIts welcome offer, while generous, carries a heavy spending requirement, which may be tough to reach if you don’t have big expenses on the horizon.\n\nSelect “Apply Now” to take advantage of this specific offer and learn more about product features, terms and conditions.\n\nEarn 60,000 bonus points when you spend $4,000 in purchases in the first 3 months – that’s $600 toward your next trip.\n\nEarn unlimited 5X points on hotels, 4X points on airlines, 3X points on other travel and restaurants, and 1X points on other purchases.\n\n$95 annual fee.\n\nBook your travel with the Autograph Journey Card and enjoy Travel Accident Insurance, Lost Baggage Reimbursement, Trip Cancellation and Interruption Protection and Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver.\n\nEarn a $50 annual statement credit with $50 minimum airline purchase.\n\nUp to $1,000 of cell phone protection against damage or theft.

This perk makes it an especially versatile option if you’re a Choice Privileges fan and fly frequently.\n\nAlternatives: The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is a low-cost travel card with a bit more flexibility. Cardholders can redeem rewards for stays at nearly any hotel property and get a credit of up to $100 for their Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee.\n\nPros\n\nIts expedited security screening credit and higher rewards rates should make it more lucrative even than the no-annual-fee Choice Privileges card.\n\nComes with 30,000 bonus points each year on your account anniversary — easily enough value to offset the card’s annual fee.\n\nCons\n\nA general travel card can offer more flexibility, allowing you to earn and redeem rewards for stays with any hotel brand, not just Choice Privileges.\n\nThough you can move Choice Privilege points to airline partners, the transfer ratio is very poor (typically 5:1), making transferring rarely worth the trouble.\n\nSelect “Apply Now” to take advantage of this specific offer and learn more about product features, terms and conditions.\n\nLimited Time Offer: Earn 90,000 bonus points when you spend $3,000 in purchases within the first 3 months - enough to redeem for up to 11 Reward nights at select Choice Hotels® properties.
