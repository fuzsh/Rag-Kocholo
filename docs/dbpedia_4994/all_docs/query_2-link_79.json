Therefore, it's essential to conduct thorough research before choosing which bank to partner with or use.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the different types of banks and their key features and provide some insight into which type of bank is most suitable for you.\n\nWhat is a Bank, and How Does It Operate?\n\nBefore exploring the different types of banks, it's essential to understand the basic concept of a bank.\n\nBanks are financial institutions authorized to accept deposits and provide credits. Along with fundamental functions, they offer an array of services, including:\n\nCredit cards.\n\nCheck-cashing services.\n\nWealth management services.\n\nInsurance.\n\nBusiness banking.\n\nThe core operation of banks involves using customer deposits as a base for lending. Banks lend these funds to other customers at a higher interest rate than they pay on deposits. This interest rate spread is a primary source of their profit.\n\nAdditionally, banks generate revenue through service fees and charges, including account maintenance, transaction fees, and specific service charges like overdrafts and wire transfers.\n\nThis operational model positions banks as vital intermediaries between savers and borrowers. They facilitate the circulation of money within the economy, contributing significantly to both financial growth and stability.\n\nHow Are Banks Regulated?\n\nBanks are regulated by government bodies and the central bank to ensure safety, ethical operations, and financial stability. These regulations include capital adequacy and liquidity requirements, ensuring banks maintain sufficient reserves and liquid assets. In addition, risk management protocols are also mandated, along with regular audits, to guarantee compliance.\n\nConsumer protection laws play an integral role in banking regulation. These laws are designed to safeguard customers from unfair banking practices and ensure transparency. Moreover, banks often participate in government-backed insurance schemes, such as the FDIC in the U.S. This scheme covers deposits up to USD250,000 per depositor per bank to protect depositors in case of bank failures. These regulations ensure that banks operate responsibly and in the public and economic interest.\n\nTypes of Banks What It Is Key Services Suitable for Retail Banks Banks that offer services to individuals Bank accounts, loans, debit and credit cards, and ATMs. Individuals and small businesses Commercial Banks Banks designed for commercial purposes Loans, cash management, credit products, equipment lending, trade finance, commercial real estate, foreign exchange Small and mid-size businesses Investment Banks Banks that manage investment portfolios Stock trade, securities, and bonds management, corporate finance, merger & acquisition assistance, and asset management Large corporations, and institutional investors Universal Banks Banks that offer a combination of retail, commercial, and investment banking services–all in one place Checking and Savings Accounts, Credit and Loan Facilities, Brokerage Services Asset, Management and Investment Advisory, and Financial Analysis Individuals and businesses seeking comprehensive financial services from one single bank Credit Unions Member-owned and non-profit financial institutions Similar services to retail and commercial banks, but only to certain demographics Individuals seeking affordability and local support Private Banks Banks offering personalized banking services Financial planning, investment guidance, wealth management, credit services, lending High-net-worth individuals Savings and Loan Associations (S&Ls) Banks specializing in making mortgage loans Mortgages, refinance loans, and alternative home loans using deposited savings Customers seeking a community-oriented banking experience for homebuying Islamic Banks Banks that operate in strict adherence to Islamic law.

Retail Banks\n\nRetail banks, also referred to as consumer banks or personal banks offer banking services that cater to individual needs. These banks can facilitate most banking services, including savings, regular transactions, personal loans, debit and credit cards, and brokerage services.\n\nDespite being widely used by the general public, retail banks also provide business bank accounts and are sometimes used by small businesses.\n\nSmall businesses may opt for retail rather than commercial banks due to eligibility issues such as a lack of required credit history or revenue. Additionally, they may prefer the convenience of retail banks, which have more locations and longer working hours than commercial banks.\n\nExamples of Retail Banks\n\nAccording to Statista, the top 5 most valuable retail banking banks worldwide as of February 2023 are\n\nIndustrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)\n\nChina Construction Bank\n\nAgricultural Bank of China\n\nBank of China\n\nBank of America\n\nYou may notice that 4 out of 5 of these banks are Chinese banks.

Universal Banks\n\nUniversal banks offer a combination of retail, commercial, and investment banking services under one roof. These banks cater to a wide range of financial needs, from individual savings accounts to corporate finance and investment advisory.\n\nThe concept of universal banking is particularly significant in the United Kingdom and the United States. Historically, these countries clearly distinguished between pure investment banks and commercial banks. In the U.S., this separation was initially mandated by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. Over time, however, the regulatory barriers have been mainly dissolved, leading to the rise of universal banks in both regions.\n\nIn other regions, particularly those that follow European banking practices, the distinction between investment and commercial banks is less clear. As a result, larger banks often operate as universal banks, while smaller institutions specialize as commercial or investment banks.\n\nExamples of Universal Banks\n\nBarclays\n\nCitigroup\n\nCredit Suisse\n\nHSBC\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nKey Services Offered by Universal Banks\n\nUniversal Bank Key Services Description Checking and Savings Accounts Allow clients to earn interest on their deposits and access funds for daily transactions.

Credit Unions\n\nCredit unions are types of financial cooperatives that offer typical banking services but operate as non-profit institutions and are owned by their members.\n\nThey have been a consistent alternative to traditional banking for many. As of November 2023, the membership of credit unions has increased to 141.3 million, according to the Credit Union National Association.\n\nIn their functionality, they are very similar to retail and commercial banks, and their services are targeted at individual consumers, startups, and small businesses. The difference is credit unions mainly serve people affiliated with certain groups, such as people living in a certain region, those living in low-income communities, active members of the military or military veterans, and more.\n\nAs member-owned and not-for-profit organizations, credit unions typically offer better interest rates on loans and savings accounts than traditional banks. Moreover, they are able to charge lower fees because they are exempt from Federal and most state taxes. However, credit unions are still responsible for certain tax obligations, including payroll and property taxes.\n\nExamples of Credit Unions\n\nSome of the more notable credit unions include\n\nAlliant Credit Union\n\nNavy Federal Credit Union\n\nBethpage Federal Credit Union\n\nKey Services Offered by Credit Unions\n\nCredit Unions Key Services Description Loans Personal loans, business loans, auto loans, and mortgage loans are available only to the clientele demographics that they serve.\n\nThe fees and rates are very favorable. Accounts Customers of credit unions can open savings and checking accounts with their affiliated branches.\n\nThe cost of banking through the union is low, as the account minimums and required fees will be low to non-existent. Credit Cards Affiliates of credit unions can open lines of credit through the institution. ATM Services Access cash without the need for debit cards Student Loans Dispense student loans with flexible repayment plans at relatively lower interest rates Retirement Savings Accounts For qualifying elderly customers who are looking for a place to save and secure their money Secured Loans and Lines of Credit Loans and credit cards for those with lower credit scores\n\nThis service serves as an opportunity for those with a poor credit history to rebuild their credit. Notary Services Such as notarizing documents and issuing certified copies\n\nPros and Cons of Credit Unions\n\nLower fees and borrowing rates\n\nMembers benefit from credit union profits as shareholders, often as increased dividends on savings and deposits or reduced interest rates on loans.\n\nMore personal products and services\n\nEligibility requirements for membership\n\nLimited branches and ATMs\n\nMay have fewer products and services\n\nWho Should Use Credit Unions\n\nâ Individuals looking for a banking option that provides more affordable loan services and support from a local financial institution.\n\nâ Those who are looking to deposit their money and earn a higher interest rate than traditional savings accounts offer.\n\nâ Customers within a specific demographic or group (e.g. by profession, community, organization) that want a more personalized banking option.\n\n6. Private Banks\n\nPrivate banks are designed to be, from their name, private. Regular individuals may not be familiar with or come across many private banks because they cater to high-net-worth individuals, like CEOs of larger corporations or someone with minimum liquid assets of USD 1 million.\n\nHowever, the minimum amount of cash required to open accounts varies from bank to bank.\n\nThe financial products and services provided by private banks, such as account maintenance, carry fees. These fees can be avoided by meeting a certain account minimum balance, a requirement that differs from one private bank to another.\n\nExamples of Private Banks\n\nJP Morgan Private Bank\n\nUBS Wealth Management Bank.\n\nMorgan Standley Private Bank\n\nCiti Private Bank\n\nKey Services Offered by Private Banks\n\nPrivate Banks Key Services Description Preferential Rates Higher Annual Percentage Yields for deposit accounts\n\nTypically, lower fees with the advantage of preferential pricing on loans and mortgages Comprehensive Financial Planning Financial counsel which includes creating savings plans, analyzing the financial implications of major purchases, and so on.

Wealth Management Includes legal advice, estate planning, personal accounting, retirement planning, and tax guidance Credit Services Lines of credit with lower rates compared to other bank types Lending Loans for the purchase of major luxury products, land, property, and so on\n\nPros and Cons of Private Banks\n\nPersonalize services\n\nPossible access to exclusive hedge funds\n\nHigh fees\n\nProvide financial services to high-net-worth clients only\n\nWho Should Use Private Banks\n\nâ High-net-worth individuals or families looking for more in-depth financial advice and personalized services.\n\nâ High-net-worth customers looking to make more strategic financial decisions regarding investments, estate planning, and wealth management.\n\n7. Savings and Loan Associations\n\nSavings and Loan Associations (S&Ls), also known as Thrift Banks, are mutually owned financial institutions that offer mortgages, refinance loans, and alternative home loans using deposited savings.\n\nAlthough S&Ls are not banks in the traditional sense, as they focus on home financing, they also provide limited lending services to businesses, savings accounts, and different types of deposit accounts.\n\nBy law, S&Ls are required to maintain at least 65% of their loans to consumers on housing-related terms, which is why their services to businesses are slightly fewer than those of individuals.\n\nExamples of Savings and Loan Associations\n\nCapital One 360\n\nSynchrony Bank\n\nKey Services Offered by Savings and Loan Associations\n\nS&Ls Key Services Description Accounts Saving deposit accounts Loans Primarily home and property-related loans\n\nPros and Cons of Savings and Loan Associations\n\nTypically higher interest rates\n\nSupport the community by improving local housing\n\nLimited products and services\n\nMay have limited ATM network and online banking options\n\nWho Should Use Savings and Loan Associations\n\nâ Customers who are looking for a more community-oriented banking experience and are looking to buy a home.\n\nâ Customers who want to save a little more on fees and earn with higher interest rates on savings\n\n8. Islamic Banks\n\nIslamic banks operate in strict adherence to Sharia, or Islamic law, setting them apart from conventional banking systems. Central to Islamic banking is the prohibition of interest (Riba), as Islam views lending with interest as exploitative. Therefore, Islamic banks employ alternative methods to generate revenue, such as equity participation, where profit and loss are shared with clients. This means if a bank finances a business, it shares in the profits rather than charging interest and similarly bears a portion of losses if the business struggles.\n\nIslamic finance also avoids investments in businesses engaged in prohibited (Haram) activities like alcohol or pork production, adheres to strict prohibitions against speculative transactions (Maisir), and rejects contracts with excessive uncertainty or risk (Gharar).\n\nThese principles ensure that each transaction is tied to a tangible asset or service and that risks and profits are equitably shared. This approach leads Islamic banks to adopt more cautious investment strategies, typically avoiding high-risk ventures that could lead to economic instability or speculative bubbles.\n\nExamples of Islamic Banks\n\nAl Rajhi Bank\n\nBank Pasargad\n\nDubai Islamic Bank\n\nKuwait Finance House\n\nKey Services Offered by Islamic Banks\n\nIslamic Banks Key Services Description Musharakah (Profit and Loss Sharing Ventures) This involves a partnership where all parties contribute capital to a business and share the profits and losses.

Ijarah (Islamic Leasing) Similar to leasing, the bank purchases an asset and leases it to a client. The client pays rent over a period, while the bank retains ownership of the asset Sukuk (Islamic Bonds) Similar to bonds, investors earn returns from the profit of an underlying asset rather than interest. Takaful (Islamic Insurance) A cooperative insurance scheme where members contribute to a mutual pool to provide each other with financial support in times of need.\n\nPros and Cons of Islamic Banks\n\nEthical investment and financing options based on Islamic principles\n\nLimited variety of financial products compared to conventional banks\n\nNot widely available in all regions\n\nGreen Banks Key Services Description Financing Renewable Energy Projects Providing loans and investments for projects such as solar and wind energy development.

Challenger Banks\n\nChallenger banks, also referred to as Online banks, Digital banks, or Virtual banks, are banks that challenge the traditional methods of banking.\n\nThey offer most of the services that traditional banks do, but primarily through digital channels.\n\nMany challenger banks don't set up physical branches, while a few still maintain a limited number of physical locations.\n\nFrom 2016-2019, the search for Challenger banks online increased by 32%, while the search for traditional banks decreased by 22% during the same period. An increasing number of users have started considering this option, mostly due to the challenges that they may face with traditional banks.\n\nBecause they challenge the traditional ways of banking, there have been doubts about their security and legitimacy. However, many online banks have authorized banking licenses in the countries where they operate, so they are regulated by respective local authorities. These banks have been a growing trend that focuses on improving their services through innovation, technology, and convenience.\n\nExamples of Challenger Banks\n\nSome of the most popular challenger banks include\n\nRevolut\n\nN26\n\nMonzo\n\nStarling Bank\n\nð¡Tip: Are you curious to learn more about their business accounts and fees?

Neobanks\n\nNeobanks is a new type of bank in which smaller, digital platforms perform the same services as retail banks, just without the physical presence.\n\nNeobanks operate exclusively online and focus on improving through technology and convenience.\n\nThough there are still some reservations regarding neobanking, the trend in its use is growing worldwide. According to Statista, the number of users who will have adopted neobanking is estimated to grow to over 370 million by 2027.\n\nBeing completely online, these banks have low overhead and are, therefore, more likely to offer unique features that typical banks wonât offer, such as foreign exchange services, a multi-currency account, and more.Â\n\nMany of the neobanks are not banks. They don't hold banking licenses, but rather financial licenses such as a Money Service Operators License in Hong Kong and a Payment Service Provider Licence in Singapore, which allow them to provide cross-border payment services.\n\nð Note: Neobanks normally hold your money in a segregated account held by a real banking institution.\n\nExamples of Neobanks\n\nStatrys\n\nChime\n\nVaro\n\nLunar\n\nð¡Tip: Check out our article to discover the top 19 neobanks in the market.\n\nKey Services Offered by Neobanks\n\nNeobanks Key Services Description Multi-currency Accounts Accounts that support multiple currencies for individuals and businesses, facilitating both local and international transfers.

However, they do have slight differences, which we will summarize below.\n\nChallenger banks typically offer a full range of banking services and products, as they hold a banking license granted by their local regulatory authority. This means that they operate like traditional banks and are bound by the same regulations.\n\nMany of them are also covered under local deposit insurance schemes, such as the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) in the UK. As a result, they are free to use the word 'bank' in their name without restrictions.\n\nOn the other hand, neobanks usually offer limited banking and financial services due to the nature of their license. Most neobanks don't carry an official banking license. Rather, they carry Payment Services licenses (like the Payment Service Provider License in Singapore) that allow them to provide payment services across customers.\n\nThe lack of a banking license means that the funds kept with the institution are not insured to the degree of traditional banks. This also means that they cannot use the word 'bank' in their name.\n\nIt's important to take note of the licenses of such companies to have a better understanding of the products they offer and the services provided.\n\nð¡Tip: We have you covered if you want a more in-depth comparison between challenger banks and neobanks.\n\nChallenger Banks Neobanks Services Provided • Usually provide a full range of services similar to traditional banks (e.g. loans, credit, trade finance)\n\n• Challenger banks can have a physical branch, though rarely • May have limited services to deposit accounts and debit cards.\n\n• Operate exclusively online and have no physical branch.
