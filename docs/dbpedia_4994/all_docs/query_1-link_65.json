        "text": "Wells Fargo announced that it added nine financial advisors to its Private Client Group in a recent round of hires.\n\nThe newest addition is the advisor team of David Li and Jason Camuti, who joined earlier this week from Morgan Stanley, where they practiced as The Li Group at Morgan Stanley. The team, based in Worcester, Massachusetts, produced more than $1.8 million in annual revenue from nearly $170 million in client assets, according to Wells. The advisors provide goals-based planning and risk-management guidance to family clients, according to their Morgan Stanley website.\n\nLi is a 32-year veteran of the industry with extensive wirehouse experience. He had spent nearly 11 years at Morgan Stanley following a combined run of nearly nine years at Banc of America Investment Services and Merrill Lynch, according to his BrokerCheck record. He began his career at John Hancock Distributors and has also been registered at MDS Securities, FIS Securities, and Quick & Reilly.\n\nCamuti first registered in 2011, at Merrill Lynch, and moved to Morgan Stanley with Li in 2013, per BrokerCheck.\n\nIn a separate move last month, Wells drew another advisor from Morgan Stanley's ranks, adding Mobile, Alabama–based Hunt Griffith, who produced about $1.3 million in trailing 12-month revenue from more than $231 million in client assets, according to Wells. Griffith has 10 years of advisory experience and had spent his entire career at Morgan Stanley, according to BrokerCheck.\n\nWire TransfersWells has added three more advisors this month from other wirehouse rivals.\n\nFrom UBS, Wells lured Boca Raton, Florida–based Brad Lipsig, who produced more than $1.2 million in trailing 12-month revenue from nearly $105 million in client assets, according to Wells. Lipsig has been in the industry 29 years, the last 16 at UBS, per BrokerCheck. He has also been registered at Ladenburg, Thalman & Co., Investors Depot, Josephthal Lyon & Ross Inc., JW Charles Securities, Smith Barney, and Citigroup Global Markets.\n\nFrom Merrill Lynch, Wells says it has added the Indianapolis-based team of Mike Stewart and Rick Vollmar. The duo brings a combined 46 years of experience and produces more than $1.1 million in annual revenue from more than $242 million in assets, according to Wells. Vollmar had been at Merrill his entire career — since 2000 — and Stewart had been there since 2002, according to their BrokerCheck records. Stewart also had a short stint at Salomon Smith Barney. Joining with Stewart and Vollmar is associate Dodie Kirby, according to a LinkedIn post by Christopher Maloney, the newly appointed market leader for Wells' New England and Upstate New York region.\n\nUpstate UptickMaloney's region will also host the other three advisor hires Wells announced. Plattsburgh, New York–based advisor Adam King and Orchard Park, New York–based advisors Merri Hall and Brittany Cheney all join from LPL Financial. King produced about $712,000 in trailing 12-month revenue from more than $77 million in assets, and Hall and Cheney produced about $2.4 million in combined annual revenue from nearly $265 million in combined assets, according to Wells.\n\nKing brings 23 years of experience, including nearly 10 at LPL, per BrokerCheck. Hall, with 32 years of experience, spent nearly three years at LPL after stints of 11 years at Cadaret, Grant & Co. and 18 years at M&T Securities, according to BrokerCheck. Cheney has 12 years of prior experience, all at LPL and M&T Securities, per BrokerCheck.\n\nWells has been on a recruiting push reinforced by a recent string of executive appointments. Maloney's reassignment was made possible by the appointment of his predecessor, Brendan Krebs, to the newly created role of national head of advisor recruiting in January. Last month, the firm appointed Erik Karanik to the newly created position of head of Independent Solutions for Wealth & Investment Management, a role in which he has been tasked with accelerating growth in the firm's FiNet independent channel and its First Clearing custodial offering for broker-dealers and registered investment advisors."
