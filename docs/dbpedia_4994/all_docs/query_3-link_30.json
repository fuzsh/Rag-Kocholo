        "text": "\"The hardest thing to do in investing is nothing.” — Charlie Munger\n\nBackground and education\n\nJeff has an extensive background in the wealth management industry, with over 37 years of experience. His background includes running equity portfolios benchmarked to the S&P 500. As the Managing Director of SKS Group of Wells Fargo Advisors, his main responsibility is growing, managing, and preserving the assets of his clients, including family offices, professional athletes, high-net-worth families, and executives of public companies. As a PIM1 portfolio manager and a Wells Fargo Platinum Council Advisor2, Jeff works to meet clients' specific investment goals through customized portfolio management.\n\nWhat sets Jeff apart is his unique perspective on wealth management. Throughout his career, he has not only built and run equity portfolios but has also managed branches at Tucker Anthony RBC Dain Raucher and Merrill Lynch. This dual experience has made him a results-oriented investment professional who is dedicated to adding value for his clients and his team.\n\nJeff started his career in 1986 with Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in its Global Private Client Group. He is a graduate of Bowdoin College.\n\nPlanning and investment process\n\nWhen it comes to working with clients, Jeff and his team at the SKS Group believe in a personalized approach. They have a disciplined and structured process that aims to create personalized investment portfolios tailored to each client's goals and objectives. In the initial meeting, they take the time to ask questions, listen to concerns, and have a conversation to understand the client's situation. This helps them uncover and prioritize the client's current investment goals and future aspirations.\n\nOnce they have a clear understanding of the client's situation, the team analyzes their current investment plan and financial situation. This comprehensive analysis takes into account various factors such as employer-sponsored retirement assets, deferred compensation, tax situation, family dynamics, and more. Based on this analysis, they design a comprehensive plan that considers the client's total wealth picture.\n\nOnce the plan is agreed upon, Jeff and his team implement the investment recommendations to help the client achieve their goals. They also remain readily available to answer any questions or make adjustments to the plan as needed.\n\nAway from the office\n\nJeff enjoys golfing, fly fishing, and giving back through his involvement with Bowdoin College. He is also a Patron of MFA (Museum of Fine Arts) Boston. Jeff and his wife live in Boston's South End and have two grown children.\n\n1 As PIM portfolio manager, Jeff has met stringent criteria based on experience and expertise and acts as a personal portfolio manager. The Private Investment Management (PIM) program is not appropriate for all investors. Please carefully review the Wells Fargo Advisors advisory disclosure document for a full description of our services. The minimum account size for this program is $1,000,000.\n\n2 The Platinum Council (previously known as Premier Advisor) distinction is held by a select group of Financial Advisors within WFA as measured by completion of educational components, business production based on the past year, and professionalism. Additional criteria, best practices and team structure may also be used to determine recipients.\n\n\"The only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune-tellers look good.” — Warren Buffett\n\nBackground and education\n\nAs a PIM1 Portfolio Manager with over thirty years in the financial services industry, Art has acquired a unique perspective on investment strategies throughout his career. He goes beyond relying solely on numbers and agency ratings, using his wealth of experience to help identify investment opportunities and navigate around potential obstacles.\n\nA graduate of Babson College, Art's journey in the financial services industry began after transitioning from a pharmaceutical sales job. He discovered his passion for finance and pursued it further. As a Financial Advisor, Art has worked for industry leaders including JP Morgan Securities, Merrill Lynch, Tucker Anthony, and Lehman. In 2017, he and the team formed SKS Group at Bank First Republic, which transitioned to Wells Fargo Advisors in 2023. Backed by the strength and resources of Wells Fargo Advisors and its affiliates, Art continues to focus on serving the complex wealth management needs of family offices, business owners, professionals, executives, and non-profits. The team is able to tap Wells Fargo & Company's investment specialists and capabilities spanning multiple financial interests and sectors to craft unique solutions that align with their clients' objectives and ambitions.\n\nArt's interest in economics, mathematics, and risk began in high school when he learned about the infamous stock market crash of 1929 and its far-reaching consequences. This curiosity propelled him into the world of finance, where he gained extensive experience and knowledge of fixed income strategies. In his role at SKS Group, Art manages the team's fixed income portfolios tailored to various objectives. He offers a unique perspective on fixed income investing based on his experience and seeks to add value by incorporating alternative income producing securities into traditional portfolios. Art also handles corporate cash, structured investments, and options strategies.\n\nOne of Art's greatest joys is working with people. He takes pride in helping clients and their families achieve their long-term financial goals and assisting small business owners in growing their investment portfolios to bring stability to their businesses. Art guides his clients with the mantra of “time in the markets beats timing the markets,” emphasizing the importance of patience in reaching investment goals.\n\nAway from the office\n\nArt and his wife live in Hamilton, Massachusetts, and have four grown children. In the winter you can find Art on the slopes of his favorite New England ski area, while in the summer, he enjoys spending time in Maine, and participating in automobile events. Fluent in Greek, Art fills his free time volunteering within the local Greek community.\n\nInvestments in fixed-income securities are subject to market, interest rate, credit and other risks. Bond prices fluctuate inversely to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a general rise in interest rates can cause a bond’s price to fall. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will default on payments of interest and/or principal. This risk is heightened in lower rated bonds. If sold prior to maturity, fixed income securities are subject to market risk. All fixed income investments may be worth less than their original cost upon redemption or maturity.\n\n1 As PIM portfolio manager, Art has met stringent criteria based on experience and expertise and acts as a personal portfolio manager. The Private Investment Management (PIM) program is not appropriate for all investors.
