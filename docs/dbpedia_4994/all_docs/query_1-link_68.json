        "text": "Wells Fargo´s Wealth & Investment Management is exiting its international segment business to focus on the resident client, as well as Americans abroad for reasons related to foreign or military service, as confirmed by the firm to Funds Society. This change affects Wells Fargo Advisors (its brokerage), Wells Fargo Private Bank, and Abbot Downing.\n\n“We understand this is a difficult change for our international-focused advisors (located in its Miami, NY, Texas and California offices) and this business will take many months to exit,” said Shea Leordeanu, SVP of Communications at Wells Fargo.\n\nShe also mentioned that the firm “will work very directly with all affected advisors about their individual options,” adding that they will continue to focus on providing their clients excellent service during this transition, “and will work directly with advisors so they can assist their clients with a smooth transition of their accounts out of the company in a manner that is consistent with regulatory expectations.”\n\nAccording to an internal memo cited by other news outlets, advisors have until next September to close accounts that do not comply with residency requirements, and they will not be able to open new accounts after January 19th."
