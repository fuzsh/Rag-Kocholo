        "text": "Wells Fargo is a prominent financial services company in the United States that offers a wide range of financial products and services, including banking, investment, and insurance services to individuals, businesses, and institutions. With over 8,000 locations across the U.S. and a global customer base exceeding 70 million, Wells Fargo has established itself as one of the largest financial services providers in the world.\n\nAs a diversified financial services company, Wells Fargo has a primary focus on banking, investments, and insurance. It is among the top ten largest banks in the United States, and its comprehensive suite of services includes consumer banking, business banking, credit cards, commercial and corporate banking, investments, and more.\n\nWells Fargo's unwavering dedication to customer service has contributed significantly to its success. The company has a vast network of branches and ATMs across the country, making its services easily accessible to customers. Additionally, Wells Fargo has earned a reputation for its commitment to customer satisfaction, offering personalized and tailored financial solutions to meet the unique needs of its clients.\n\nOverall, Wells Fargo's extensive range of financial products and services, coupled with its commitment to customer satisfaction, have positioned the company as a leading player in the financial services industry.\n\nHenry Wells and William G. Fargo, who established American Express in 1852, created Wells Fargo & Company to offer banking and express services to California in response to the state's quick development caused by the California Gold Rush. In March 1860, Wells Fargo took over the Butterfield Overland Mail Company when Congress didn't pass the annual post office appropriation bill, leaving the post office without the means to pay for Overland Mail Company's services and Overland without a way to compensate Wells Fargo. Consequently, Wells Fargo controlled the western segment of the Pony Express.\n\nWells Fargo has a rich and complex history that spans over a century. In 1866, the company underwent a \"Grand Consolidation\" that united Wells Fargo, Holladay, and Overland Mail stage lines under the Wells Fargo name.\n\nThroughout the years, the company has had various presidents, including Lloyd Tevis, John J. Valentine, Sr., and Dudley Evans. In 1905, Wells Fargo split its banking and express operations, with the bank merging with the Nevada National Bank to form the Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank.\n\nDuring World War I, the U.S. government nationalized Wells Fargo's express franchise into a federal agency known as the US Railway Express Agency (REA). In 1923, Wells Fargo Nevada merged with the Union Trust Company to form the Wells Fargo Bank & Union Trust Company, which in 1954 was shortened to Wells Fargo Bank.\n\nThe company has undergone numerous mergers and acquisitions, including with American Trust Company and Crocker National Bank. In 1996, Wells Fargo acquired First Interstate Bancorp for $11.6 billion, and in 1998, Wells Fargo Bank was acquired by Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis. The combined company took on the Wells Fargo name.\n\nIn 2008, Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia for about $14.8 billion in stock, following a dispute with Citigroup. This acquisition made Wells Fargo the largest retail bank in the United States. However, during the financial crisis of 2008, Wells Fargo received $25 billion of funds via the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.\n\nIn 2009, Wells Fargo acquired North Coast Surety Insurance Services, followed by the hiring of 25 investment bankers from Citadel LLC in 2011. In 2012, the company acquired Merlin Securities and rebranded it as Wells Fargo Prime Services, and also acquired a 35% stake in The Rock Creek Group LP, which was later increased to 65% before being sold back to management in 2018.\n\nIn 2015, Wells Fargo Rail acquired GE Capital Rail Services and merged it with First Union Rail, and also acquired three GE units focused on business loans equipment financing. In 2017, the company announced plans to offer smartphone-based transactions with mobile wallets including Wells Fargo Wallet, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay.\n\nThe company also underwent significant restructuring in the form of divestitures and job cuts. In 2018, Wells Fargo sold all 52 of its physical bank branch locations in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio to Flagstar Bank, and announced plans to cut 26,450 jobs by 2020 to reduce costs by $4 billion.\n\nIn 2019, the company experienced turmoil as CEO Tim Sloan resigned amidst the Wells Fargo account fraud scandal, and former general counsel C. Allen Parker became interim CEO. The company also sold its Institutional Retirement & Trust business to Principal Financial Group.\n\nLater that year, Charles Scharf was announced as the new CEO of the company. In 2020, Wells Fargo sold its student loan portfolio, and in 2021 it sold its Canadian Direct Equipment Finance business to Toronto-Dominion Bank. The company also sold its asset management division, Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM), to private equity firms GTCR and Reverence Capital Partners for $2.1 billion, and rebranded it as Allspring Global Investments. As of December 31, 2020, WFAM had $603 billion in assets under management, of which 33% was invested in money market funds."
