        "text": "S&P Global Market Intelligence offers our top picks of global private equity news stories and more published throughout the week.\n\nMore than six months after the collapse of SVB Financial Group sent tremors through the startup ecosystem, an uncertain economic outlook continues to keep a lid on venture capital investment.\n\nThe reported value of global venture capital funding rounds in the third quarter fell nearly 30% year over year to $56.93 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. The industry tallied just 3,323 funding rounds in July, August and September, a decline of nearly 35% from the third quarter of 2022.\n\nGrowing optimism around a recovery in the IPO market is welcome news for venture investors. While recession fears appear to be fading, the prospect of slower global economic growth and sustained high interest rates is weighing on startup valuations.\n\nChances for a turnaround in 2023 are getting slim. Monthly venture capital funding totals have posted a string of year-over-year declines extending all the way back to March 2022.\n\nRead more about venture capital investment in the third quarter, including the top 10 global funding rounds for the period.\n\nCHART OF THE WEEK: Private equity's top financial and legal advisers\n\n⮞ Wells Fargo Securities LLC, J.P.
