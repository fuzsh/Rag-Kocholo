        "text": "Investment Products\n\nYou have many options for investing.\n\nInvestments should work together to help you accomplish your financial goals.\n\nTypes of investments\n\nPart of the investment planning process is making investment choices that fit your investment strategy. Those investments should work together to help you accomplish your financial goals. We’re dedicated to providing you a wide range of investment products and services to help you meet them.\n\nAs an investor, you have many options. Common types of investments include:\n\nStocks\n\nAn investment giving you partial ownership in a company based on the number of shares you purchase. Stocks tend to fluctuate more in the short term, but may perform well over time.\n\nBonds\n\nAn investment that functions as a loan to a government or institution in return for regular interest payments. Bonds can provide more stability than stocks, even though bonds have historically provided lower returns than stocks.\n\nMutual funds\n\nA fund allowing you to pool your money with others in a professionally managed portfolio. Mutual funds offer diversification through a mix of investments, such as stocks or bonds.1\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs)\n\nA basket of securities traded throughout the day — just like individual stocks — on a national stock exchange. Like mutual funds, you purchase shares of an overall fund rather than individual investments.2\n\nAnnuities\n\nA contract between you and an insurance company requiring the insurer to make payments to you, either immediately or in the future. You make contributions to the annuity for a guaranteed income stream.3\n\nBrokered certificates of deposit (CDs)\n\nBrokered CDs are issued by banks, purchased in bulk by securities firms and sold to clients. Investors do not receive physical certificates for their brokered CDs, but instead receive a periodic account statement detailing their CD holdings.4 Brokered CDs’ market value may fluctuate over time.\n\nNext steps\n\nUnderstand the variety of investments available.\n\nTalk with us about investment choices.\n\nAll investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.\n\n1 Returns and principal value of a Mutual Fund will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investors should carefully consider a mutual fund’s investment objectives, risk, charges, and expenses. This information and other important details about each fund are contained in the prospectus, which can be obtained from your Financial Advisor. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.\n\n2 Exchange-Traded Funds are subject to risks similar to those of stocks. Investment returns may fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Exchange Traded Funds seek investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield of a particular index. There is no assurance that the price and yield performance of the index can be fully matched.\n\n3 Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. Variable annuities are long-term investments suitable for retirement funding and are subject to market fluctuations and investment risk. Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Guarantees apply to minimum income from an annuity; they do not guarantee an investment return or the safety of the underlying funds."
