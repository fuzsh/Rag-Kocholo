        "text": "Need to get in touch with a leader in the collateralized loan obligation market? This week’s issue of Asset-Backed Alert includes a comprehensive listing of the #CLO sector’s biggest market makers, complete with contact information for their highest-ranking personnel. Among them: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which together led almost half of last year’s U.S. new-issue supply of $110 billion. Keep tabs on the sector with more exclusive listings and with the ABS Database, which offers a full rundown of deal terms and the players involved -- and is available only to subscribers to Asset-Backed Alert, a Green Street News title. https://lnkd.in/eaXnjbYm\n\nVärde Partners' Global Head of Financial Services & Diversified Private Credit, Aneek Mamik, spoke with Bloomberg about the ways banks are partnering with private lenders as they seek to optimize their balance sheets, including through asset sales, credit risk transfers and forward-flow arrangements. “Banks deserve credit for finding ways to remain relevant and generate revenue even if they don’t hold all the assets. These moves are not simplistic or quick, it’s a big shift in identity.” Read the article here: https://lnkd.in/garb2R-Y #privatecredit #creditrisktransfer #SRT #forwardflow\n\n#RiskIntelligence Question of the Week: Which of these institutions is NOT a part-owner of the EquiLend securities lending platform? A. Bank of America B. BlackRock C. BNY Mellon D. Goldman Sachs E. UBS Think you know the answer? Comment below. We'll reveal the answer on Friday! #riskmanagement #financialriskmanagement #financialmarkets https://lnkd.in/ePdJSeSg\n\nIf you've seen the acronym SRT thrown around and wondered what in the world is a synthetic-risk transfer, or why are banks doing forward-flow arrangements, Carmen Arroyo Nieto and Katanga Johnson have the story for you. It's a fascinating situation where banks are partnering with private lenders. As capital rules have gotten tougher, banks have had to exit certain businesses or else cede market share to non-bank rivals. Now, they are partnering with those rivals in ways that benefit both parties — even if it is unclear how regulators might react. https://lnkd.in/epSbSzaR #privatecredit #structuredfinance #financialregulation\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is running into some pushback over fees and control as it aims to pull together a group of lenders to help fund private credit deals it originates, an effort that has the potential to reshape the burgeoning market. The biggest US bank has held talks with several private credit firms about creating what would amount to a syndication group where members would take a slice of each loan, according to people with direct knowledge of the discussions. JPMorgan would select the loans, and others in the syndicate would have no or limited ability to veto deals they don’t want to fund, the people said. Story by Gillian Tan and Davide Scigliuzzo. https://lnkd.in/e3XNNqqi #privatecredit #privatedebt #directlending #banking\n\nDid you know banks are finding innovative ways to manage risk and comply with regulations thanks to partnerships with private equity firms? Blackstone and KKR are at the forefront, engaging in synthetic risk transfers to help banks like JPMorgan Chase and US Bancorp lighten their load. This process not only aids banks in meeting aggressive capital requirements but also secures favorable returns for investors. Read more: #PrivateEquity #Banks\n\nSkiptism runs supreme. Regulators have drummed for simplification of banks. This is clarion call seems to be cast aside by bank CEOs. Cap1 expects regulators to come down on Cap1's assertion that the deal improves competition. Ignoring the current regulatory concerns of unsafe and unsound business practices, rooted in banks cutting corners to save costs and settlings for passing compliance grades. Taxpayer bailouts are not in the offing, especially for cutrate business practice choices. Executives will have to emerge into C-Suites skilled at growing their business without M&A options. Perhaps this means burning the ol' playbook of cutting costs when earnings plans are missed. Finding a new tactic, perhaps restructuring executive compensation could be a new dawning. #banks #mergersandacquisitions #regulatoryactions\n\nUpcoming Bank Regulations Could Make CRE Lending Even Tighter A potential side effect, if the measures come to pass, is that CRE lending activity may shift towards private equity, and there could be a higher cost of capital for CRE players. Naturally, that shift isn’t sitting well with bankers. As JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon, puts it: “This is great news for hedge funds, private equity, private credit, Apollo, Blackstone. They’re dancing in the streets.” Bisnow reports that other banking institutions which have raised the alarm include the American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute.
