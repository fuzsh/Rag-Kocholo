Current clients of LaCrosse can expect complete continuity of services, as management, service teams, and systems will be transferred to and maintained by Wells Fargo. Following completion of the acquisition, LaCrosse clients will also be able to make use of the full range of services offered by Wells Fargo, including custody, cash management, trust, paying agent, and other related banking services."
