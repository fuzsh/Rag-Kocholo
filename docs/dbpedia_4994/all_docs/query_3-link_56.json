She loves spending time with her family, although most of their year consists of juggling sports schedules between their three children. When she isn’t cheering her kids on from the sidelines of a soccer field or bleachers of the baseball field ( and soon to be gymnastics gym), you can find her at home cheering on her favorite professional sports teams the Dallas Cowboys or New York Yankees. Which sometimes leads to some loud Sundays as her two boys are Kansas City Chief fans and Philadelphia eagles fans. Her husband DJ is in his tenth year of serving with military and she is hoping to have him home full time by the end of next year.\n\nSomething you May not Know:\n\nIn Brittany’s free time- Which doesn’t happen often! She has a hobby…. That others who know her would call an addiction, of putting together Lego Sets. She started off putting her completed sets in her boy’s bedrooms but when they ran out of room there , her husband had to put up shelving in their basement for all of her builds. She’s always jokingly telling her husband, “If Lego had a job where I could sit and put Lego sets together every day, I would do that in a heartbeat!”\n\nStephanie Kennedy\n\nSenior Registered Client Associate – Vice President\n\n240.513.2708\n\n[email protected]\n\nProfessional:\n\nStephanie has been providing excellent customer service with the firm since 2006.

She was even born in Camp Lee, an army base outside Richmond, Virginia. She firmly recognizes Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as her home; we think this is derived from her love of the Steelers. She met her husband while they were teens in Baltimore, Maryland but they have lived in Fairfield, Pennsylvania since 1987. Their lovely home in Pennsylvania has a beautiful view as it is tucked next to Ski Liberty and Carroll Valley Golf Course. She begrudgingly gave up skiing a few years back, and now relies on football to fill the void. Her favorite teams are the Redskins and of course, the Steelers. Carol enjoys the beauty in nature and adores all animals. She has rescued five cats and six turtles, and loves them all.\n\nSomething you May not Know:\n\nAlthough Carol believes her football fandom filled the void when she gave up skiing, it appears football has always had a special place in Carol’s heart.
