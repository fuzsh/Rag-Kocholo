When selecting the securities for your portfolio, your portfolio manager conducts a detailed analysis of companies, industries and overall economic conditions. In managing the account, your Portfolio Manager constructs a suitable asset allocation strategy based on his or her personal investment style. The construction process attempts to maximize returns while minimizing risk to the overall portfolio.\n\nBy appointing experienced investment professionals to provide you with sound investment advice, manage your portfolio and rebalance your investment mix when necessary, you free yourself from the time-consuming task of choosing and actively monitoring your investments. After allocating your investments, your Portfolio Manager continually manages your portfolio, monitors the markets and manages performance. As part of this process, your Portfolio Manager ensures that your portfolio remains invested in financial instruments most suited to your current needs and objectives.\n\nThe PIM program gives you the added benefit of your Portfolio Manager's personalized service.
