        "text": "Powerful Portfolios. Custom To You.\n\nPowerful Portfolios. Custom To You.\n\nBased on Florida's east coast, Integrative Wealth Management provides professional investment planning and wealth management services. Our Financial Advisors create custom portfolios built around your lifestyle, needs and goals. Allowing you to focus on what's most meaningful to you and your future.\n\nWe know you're looking forward to a sunny next chapter of life. We're here to help.\n\nLet's Chat\n\nWe believe that diversification extends beyond traditional stocks and bonds. For those looking for alternatives*, our dynamic approach embraces private equity, private credit, hedge funds, real estate, and other non-traditional markets.\n\n*Alternative investments, such as hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, managed futures, private capital, real assets and real estate funds, are not appropriate for all investors. They are speculative, highly illiquid, and are designed for long-term investment, and not as trading vehicles. These funds carry specific investor qualifications which can include high income and net-worth requirements as well as relatively high investment minimums. The high expenses associated with alternative investments must be offset by trading profits and other income which may not be realized. Unlike mutual funds, alternative investments are not subject to some of the regulations designed to protect investors and are not required to provide the same level of disclosure as would be received from a mutual fund. They trade in diverse complex strategies that are affected in different ways and at different times by changing market conditions. Strategies may, at times, be out of market favor for considerable periods with adverse consequences for the fund and the investor. An investment in these funds involve the risks inherent in an investment in securities and can include losses associated with speculative investment practices, including hedging and leveraging through derivatives, such as futures, options, swaps, short selling, investments in non-U.S. securities, “junk” bonds and illiquid investments. The use of leverage in a portfolio varies by strategy. Leverage can significantly increase return potential but create greater risk of loss. At times, a fund may be unable to sell certain of its illiquid investments without a substantial drop in price, if at all. Other risks can include those associated with potential lack of diversification, restrictions on transferring interests, no available secondary market, complex tax structures, delays in tax reporting, valuation of securities and pricing. An investment in a fund of funds carries additional risks including asset-based fees and expenses at the fund level and indirect fees, expenses and asset-based compensation of investment funds in which these funds invest. An investor should review the private placement memorandum, subscription agreement and other related offering materials for complete information regarding terms, including all applicable fees, as well as the specific risks associated with a fund before investing.\n\nPortfolio Investment Managers\n\nA Distinction\n\nThat Can Benefit You\n\nWe're certified Portfolio Investment Managers and CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professionals, but what does that mean for you?\n\nIn short, our PIM designation gives us the freedom to make swift portfolio decisions on your behalf.
