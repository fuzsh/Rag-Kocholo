        "text": "Private banking is an elite service that generally features concierge-like attention to your finances, plus other perks and customized financial services. In most cases, however, only high-net-worth customers can access private banking.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about private banking to decide whether it can help you reach your money goals.\n\nWhat Is Private Banking?\n\nPrivate banking, also known as “relationship management,” pairs banking clients with individuals or teams that handle all of their financial tasks within the bank.\n\nThe clients can skip the teller and call their private banker directly to get help or complete transactions. The private banker is already familiar with the client’s specific financial situation and is in an ideal position to make suggestions and recommendations.\n\nWhile the concierge nature of private banking is one of its selling points, that’s not all a private banker offers. In addition to being the point of contact for private clients, a private banker can also pay bills, provide wealth management services and arrange for unique products outside the bank’s standard offerings.\n\nIn short, private banking offers clients a single coordinator for nearly all their banking and financial needs.\n\nWhat Is a Private Banker?\n\nPrivate bankers are financial professionals who provide concierge banking services. They are experts on the benefits a private bank can offer. They also know how to navigate channels and advocate for clients when necessary.\n\nMost financial institutions hire only certified private bankers licensed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA).\n\nLike a resort concierge, a private banker helps you maximize your banking experience with minimal stress. They provide guidance and suggestions based on the financial institution’s products and partnerships. They may also earn bonuses or commissions on financial products they recommend.\n\nHow Private Banking Works\n\nPrivate banking takes a holistic approach to your finances. Whether you’re an executive, entrepreneur or owner of a family business, private banking considers the solutions that best fit your unique needs.\n\nWhat Does a Private Banker Do?\n\nA private banker helps craft a financial strategy and reduces friction when connecting you to additional banking resources. Private bankers should be well-versed in your financial situation and familiar with your short- and long-term financial goals.\n\nPrivate bankers closely monitor the performance of your accounts and educate you on investment risk. During major life changes and tumultuous seasons in the market, private bankers explain your options and work with you to refine your plan. Your private banker can also coordinate any borrowing needs and provide you with preferred interest rates and customized terms for various loans.\n\nPrivate bankers can support business owners with credit increases, succession planning, risk-protection strategies and cash flow solutions. And they may inform you of changes to tax regulations or connect you to external legal advisors.\n\nAnother aspect of a private banker’s role is generating new business and promoting financial services. While a certified private banker looks after your finances, they are also considering the bank’s and their own financial interests.\n\nPrivate Banking Services\n\nPrivate banking services vary from bank to bank. But you are likely to find the following services and products from many banks offering private banking:\n\nPreferential rates and pricing on deposit accounts. Private banking clients may be eligible for higher APYs on savings accounts, CDs, interest-bearing checking accounts and money market accounts. They also may enjoy lower fees or waived fees on their accounts.\n\nGeneral financial planning. A private banker can walk clients through major financial decisions, such as deciding how much to spend on a house or when to start saving for a child’s education.\n\nInvestment advice and wealth management. Private bankers often fill the role most commonly associated with financial planners and advisors by advising their clients on investing, including everything from asset allocation to tax-loss harvesting to risk management.\n\nEstate planning. Clients can confer with private bankers on how to set up an estate plan, although some aspects of planning require a visit to another professional, such as an estate attorney. Private bankers will often refer their clients to trusted professionals for that purpose.\n\nLending. Clients looking to purchase a home, investment property or commercial property can contact their private banker for assistance. A private mortgage banker with expertise in custom home lending solutions may offer better options for complicated home acquisitions. The bankers may also provide loans for luxury items. Even if the bank does not generally offer loans for your specific purchase, a private banker may be able to arrange the loan you need.\n\nTax planning and philanthropy. Private bankers may stay on top of important tax laws on your behalf to reduce your tax burden. They may also provide access to professionals experienced in nonprofit management and philanthropic strategy to develop a specialized investment plan for contributions.\n\nCredit and cash-flow management. Institutions typically offer their private banking clients lines of credit with low rates. Private bankers can also help derive cash flow from illiquid assets to manage business costs and avoid loss from excessive cash on hand.\n\nPrivate Banking Minimum Requirements\n\nNot all private banking is equal. Banks like Chase, HSBC and Wells Fargo advertise enhanced service-based checking accounts using the terms “private client” or “premier accounts.” However, these accounts are not true private banking.\n\nEligibility requirements for bona fide private banking vary from bank to bank. But the services are generally reserved for high-net-worth individuals, which, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, means people with at least $750,000 in investable assets.\n\nInvestable assets include any liquid or nearly liquid assets you own, such as money in your checking and savings accounts, CDs, money market accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, retirement accounts and trusts. Although the minimum amount for private banking eligibility varies, $1 million is a common benchmark requirement.\n\nHowever, some private banks require investable assets of $5 million or $10 million for account consideration. And even within those banks, those assets will not grant you access to the most exclusive products from the bank.\n\nThe Cost of Private Banking\n\nThere are a variety of fee structures for private banking. Some banks that sell products to their private banking clients rely on commissions from those sales. Clients of these private banking services do not pay anything out of pocket, but they should be aware of the products’ commission-based nature.\n\nBanks may also use fees to pay for private banking—either instead of or in addition to commissions. Fees for private banking may be fixed or sliding. Fixed fees are similar to typical account maintenance fees you’d pay for a checking account. You may be able to avoid fees by maintaining a minimum balance, or the fees may be nonnegotiable.\n\nSome banks use a sliding fee instead of fixed fees, charging private banking customers a percentage of their assets under management (AUM). This percentage is generally around 1% of the AUM.\n\nPrivate Banking Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nPros\n\nSingle point of contact. Private banking provides access to a dedicated private banker who can address concerns, troubleshoot financial challenges and refer you to experts within your bank. That can increase banking privacy and reduce the number of times you need to explain your finances.\n\nBenefits for business owners. Juggling your personal and company finances can be challenging, but a private banking relationship can help you find the balance between maximizing your personal finances and growing your business.\n\nAccess to alternative investments. Private banking can open the door to exclusive hedge funds and private capital opportunities.\n\nCons\n\nLack of transparency. Due to the elite nature of private banking, a complete list of services and fees isn’t always available. Finding the best fit for your needs may be difficult without a full picture of products.\n\nPotential conflict of interest. Although some private banks claim to follow a fiduciary standard, few certified private bankers are fiduciaries. That means your banker may prioritize their interests ahead of yours. According to a 2021 study from the accounting and consulting firm Crowe, 62.4% of financial institutions have pay-for-performance incentives.\n\nPrivate bankers are generalists. While a certified private banker may be able to connect you to a private mortgage or investment banker, you could receive better service if you assemble your own team of financial advisors, CPAs, mortgage brokers and business consultants.\n\nIs Private Banking Right for You?\n\nHaving at least $250,000 in investable assets is the minimum you’ll need to qualify for private banking. But even if you have that kind of money, this service may not be right for you. There are several important caveats to the perks offered by private banking.\n\nConsider the cost of private banking compared to the same services from other providers. Make sure you know how your institution’s private banking fees measure up. Ask yourself if a certified financial planner or investment advisor will charge you a smaller percentage of assets under management than your private banker.\n\nSimilarly, determining how much you can expect to spend on a CPA and estate attorney can help you decide if your private banker costs more or less than creating a team of experts for yourself.\n\nPrivate Banking vs. Wealth Management\n\nThe line between private banking and wealth management can be blurry. Merrill Wealth Management, a Bank of America Company, provides access to both Merrill Investing and Bank of America banking services. Merrill Wealth Management even outsources its philanthropic solutions to Bank of America’s Private Bank, but they are still separate services.\n\nBoth private banking and wealth management offer financial planning and investment management, and each may include portfolio management, tax and estate planning. Yet while some wealth management programs operate within large banks, wealth management firms aren’t required to operate under banking charters as private banks are.\n\nAnd, wealth managers often lack access to all of a client’s financial accounts. Meanwhile, many private bank clients rely on their certified private banker to manage their day-to-day funds, overseeing checking, savings, CDs and investments.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf you have the necessary investable assets and need the convenience of a single point of contact for all of your financial responsibilities, you may want to consider private banking. But before committing, carefully consider the benefits, and interview several banks to determine their offerings.\n\nPrivate banking isn’t the best option for everyone. Still, it works well if a bank’s services fully meet your expectations and you’re comfortable working with an evolving team over a long duration.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)"
