        "text": "For information about the Mario version of this character, go here.\n\nMain\n\n\"Dad, Dad, Dad!\"\n\n— Junior calling Braxton.\n\n\"So, guys, what do you wanna do today?\"\n\n— Junior asking his friends what they want to do at the beginning of a video.\n\nBraxton Benard Jr., commonly known as Junior (formerly Bowser Junior), is a main character of the SML series and is a student at Y U DUMB? ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. His real name is revealed to be Robert in \"The Koopa Kids!\". However, that video was non-canon as the Koopalings miniseries was a remake. From 2013 to mid 2016, he was the spoiled and bratty son of Braxton. However, from late 2016 to late 2019, he became somewhat more mature and acts less bratty and his relationship with Bowser improved to the point where they both love each other and started to bond every day.\n\nBowser Junior's personality was introduced in 2013, revealing him as a Baby bratty version of Bowser. Always demanding and getting what he wants. In the past, he showed no mercy towards Chef Pee Pee and was always controlling over him thinking he had power of him because his boss is Junior's father.\n\nJunior always believed that he is cooler than everyone else. However, Junior lacked actual intelligence as he was sent to summer school in 2014, also thinking that the Sun is a planet and that the Moon was discovered by Neil Armstrong. Junior continued his bratty, selfish Personality for a while and still continues to show it today.\n\nCurrently, Junior rarely bothers Chef Pee Pee. Despite that, however, Chef Pee Pee still hates him. He hangs out with his current friends such as Cody, Joseph, Jeffy and occasionally Richard Goodman and formerly others such as Lil' T, Felipe and Chris the Cucumber. In his early years, he was the archenemy of Brooklyn T. Guy and Principal Steinbeck. However, in later years, he is sometimes the arch-rival of Chef Pee Pee. He began dating his ex–enemy Penelope in 2023, having one brief breakup between late December and early January.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nJunior appears the same as he does in numerous Mario games, with a light green head, a convex tan snout, a single tooth, horns with brownish-orange rings and a dark yellow body. For attire, he wears his trademark bib.\n\nHis human puppet appearance depicts him with black eyes, orange eyebrows, a small clump of orange hair, fully white horns, and white skin. For attire, he now wears an orange t-shirt, a white bib that reads 'JR', green shorts, black wristbands, and orange shoes with yellow soles.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nBowser Junior's personality was extremely variant in earlier videos and over time has had numerous different sides to him. Junior is known for being an annoyance to everyone around the house, especially towards Chef Pee Pee, and always caused a disruption that usually leads to Bowser yelling at Chef Pee Pee for it or sometimes vice-versa.\n\nHe also got rabies and started acting weird in \"Bowser Junior Gets Rabies! \" When the rabid squirrel bit him, he turned into a wild animal and was foaming at the mouth. Chef Pee Pee gave him a pill and that made Junior feel better and then he bit him. At the end of the video, Bowser Junior said that \"Chef Pee Pee was having \"babies\" himself.\n\nIt's pretty apparent that Junior has some serious mental instability, if anything happens that may affect him badly, or something doesn't go his way, he will react in a very unhinged and insane way. (Seen mostly in Bowser Junior's Punishment!, Bowser Junior's Flu Shot!, and Bowser Junior Goes to Military School! Part 1 mostly shown in part 2, with his Flu Shot being the most unreasonable and his Military School being the most reasonable.) This mental instability was confirmed when it was revealed that he has ADHD, explaining why he is so reckless and forgetful.\n\nIn Loch Ness Monster, Junior made fun of Cody's mom, and when Cody finally decided to talk back at him, his reaction was bursting into tears. This reveals that Junior is an enormous hypocrite for making fun of someone Cody knows and loves when he can't even avoid bursting into tears when someone he doesn't even know is made fun of. However, considering the fact that Junior doesn't know his mom, it's not entirely his fault.\n\nHowever, despite all of this, even Junior is capable of genuine kindness, the shining example of this is when he felt bad for Chef Pee Pee's suffering on his birthday, and as an apology, threw a surprise birthday party for him, with Joseph and Cody's help! He even apologizes for treating Chef Pee Pee badly for the entire time they've known each other (although, thanks to the new status quo, this is rendered redundant via negative continuity).\n\nDespite being a generally clueless character, he has shown to act smart on some occasions such as \"Bowser Junior's 1st Grade! Part 5\" where he states that blue stars are hotter than red stars, in \"Cool Cody!\" where Bowser Junior figures out how to change Cody back to normal, in \"Bowser Junior's Bad Luck!\" he states that superstitions are not real and that all the bad luck he was getting were coincidences. However, he was revealed to believe in lucky pennies, demonstrating his hypocrisy.\n\nIn \"Bowser Junior's Piggy Bank!\", he knows how to stop his dad from getting arrested without getting himself in trouble and in \"Broken\" where he has the idea to put the one-piece tuxedo on Ken and give it to Cody, so he stops crying. Along with Joseph, Bowser Junior keeps trying to prove to Cody that Ken is a doll and that the Sun is a planet (although he no longer seems to argue this after \"Bowser Junior Goes To The Sun! \"). When SML did a twisted parody of Home Alone, he also used a bowling ball, a trail of Cheez-It, an oven, a golden watch, and an electrified doorknob as a trap to kill 3 robbers (1 survived but was imprisoned).\n\nIn late 2016/early 2017, He didn't act very bratty anymore, as he improved from military school. He's also simply grown up over the past few years, as he was just 4 in his first modern appearance. Despite this, however, Bowser Junior’s bratty-ness returns at the beginning of \"Bowser Junior's 9th Birthday!\" where his father punished him for destroying his flat-screen TV but the best example of this is in \"Bowser's Christmas Problem\" where Bowser explained to him that Santa Claus isn't real though this was never spoken of him again. Starting from Season 9 and Onwards, He has retired from being a brat, he became more mature, better Koopaling. He and Joseph both think the sun is a planet because of its spherical shape, and that actual stars are pointy.\n\nAs of late 2019, Junior has reverted back to his bossy and ignorant nature. This was evident in The School Project! when he makes up excuses to make Cody seem more guilty when he accidentally destroyed his helicopter and takes revenge by destroying his project. He also likes to accuse Cody for poor reasons such as assuming he forgot about his birthday in Bowser Junior's 21st Birthday and decides to threaten Cody in Bowser Junior's Revenge. He also has a habit of confusing simple English such as thinking the word \"Birthday\" is actually 2 words.\n\nEver since 2020, Junior has shown to be far more ignorant, mean and malicious as of recent videos. In Cody's New Friend! Junior decided to get Cody's terminally sick friend Luke Emia arrested just to get Cody to hang out with him again. On top of that, Junior has completely forgotten the concept of cancer and death and thinks dying means going to space. In Junior’s iPad! Junior has also shown heartless behavior as when Brooklyn T. Guy made up a story about a dying kid who was born of with no legs and only one arm that has no lungs and has to breathe through a machine and Junior simply responded with \"sucks to suck.\" Even though the story was made up, this heavily implies that Junior no longer cares about anyone but himself, which is a major downgrade from his 2016-2019 self. This is later shown in Junior Goes To Legoland! where he constantly physically abuses Cody, forces Cody to snitch on Penelope so he can blackmail her, gets his friends injured and takes no responsibility. Also, in Jeffy's Pool Party, he has also been revealed to be a lot more hypocritical than before because he and Joseph tell Cody that they are not comfortable with their bodies, and yet, they keep making fun of his mom's body, which, even though is very likely just an excuse that SML creators used since there are no shirtless versions of Junior and Joseph, can only mean that he and Joseph have become far bigger hypocrites than ever before. Junior has also been revealed to have clichédly sexist thoughts (i.g thinking that girls are dumb and can't be surgeons). In more recent videos, Junior has become more of a sadistic sociopath who constantly tortures Cody. Even as of Junior's Karma!, he has become so heartless to the point where he no longer cares about people with disabilities and acts like a jerk towards them, with the exception of Jeffy.\n\nJunior’s former spoiled personality was based on Haleigh, Logan’s younger half-sister as mentioned by Logan himself.\n\nPersonality Traits[]\n\nFriendly (sometimes)\n\nSpoiled\n\nKind (sometimes)\n\nInsane\n\nMisbehaved\n\nCrazy\n\nArrogant\n\nAnnoying\n\nBrat\n\nSelfish\n\nDemanding\n\nDimwitted\n\nRude\n\nChildish\n\nRacist\n\nMisogynistic\n\nNaughty\n\nStubborn\n\nImmature\n\nLiar\n\nHonest (brutally)\n\nCoward\n\nGreedy\n\nCold\n\nMean\n\nInsensitive\n\nHypocritical\n\nSarcastic\n\nDelusional (occasionally, specfically in Bowser Junior's Package!)\n\nHistory[]\n\nBowser Junior was born on September 28, 2008, to Shelby and Bowser in Ferry Pass, Florida.\n\nWhen Bowser Junior was born, he started as an evil baby who burnt Mario and kidnapped Peach until Black Yoshi wounded him. Following the end of MLSDA, Bowser started dating Shelby, but she would later leave him, leaving Bowser Junior with no mother. Bowser would always choke his son with cotton balls, causing his fears of it.\n\nIn \"Bowser Junior Needs Glasses!\" Junior wore glasses and his friend's made fun of him so he read a medical book and got smarter and thinks he's smarter than everyone.\n\nIn \"Bowser Junior's Flu Shot!\" Junior was scarred after he got his flu shot and was on a wheelchair and wore a cast on his leg where he got his flu shot and claims to have been \"shot\" by Brooklyn Guy.\n\nAnd in \"Bowser Junior's Cookies!\" He left a sticky note which had cookies written on the fridge and was hoping for Chef Pee Pee to get him cookies, but Chef Pee Pee said that he didn't see it and Junior kept repeating he didn't see it and placed sticky notes all over the house and the car. It's also noted that Junior doesn't have a sense of empathy because he told Joseph to stop crying over his “dead” mom in \"Bowser Junior Sneaks Into A Movie!\n\nOn several occasions, he is found to racially prejudice black people. This is evident in \"Black Yoshi's Job\" (Black Yoshi is asked to babysit Junior while Bowser and Chef Pee Pee go to the hospital) when Junior is surprised to see Black Yoshi walk up to him while he is playing with his dinosaurs. Junior cries, \"Oh my god! Black Guy! Don't take my money! Protect me, dinosaurs!\" Black Yoshi then asks, \"Why is everyone in this house so racist?\"\n\nThere is another occasion in \"Bowser Junior's 6th Birthday\" after he opens the door to let Cody and his family inside, not expecting Cody to have a black step-father.\n\nJunior is also known for sharing fake stories. For example, in \"Bowser Junior's Flu Shot!\", He explains to Joseph and Cody that a guy came in with a gun, shot Bowser and Chef Pee Pee, and getting shot in the knee.\n\nAlso, in \"No Crust!\", he explains to the Brooklyn Guy that Chef Pee Pee used a chainsaw to \"kill\" his sandwich, in reality, all he did was cut the crust. In \"Chef Pee Pee The Octopus!\", he falsely said Chef Pee Pee wants to be an octopus. In the video \"Loch Ness Monster!\" Junior showed a fake video and lied about it for a while. Though he did owe up to it in the end.\n\nHe has made extremely poor choices on more than one occasion such as in Bowser Junior gets Rabies and Bowser Junior's Doll like trying to pet a rabid squirrel and trying to throw water bombs in the house respectively and lacks common sense which leads to him being half dumb.\n\nHe is also addicted to Doofy The Dragon, similar to his Dad's TV addiction to Charleyyy and Friends, though to a much lesser extent.\n\nHowever, despite all of this, even Junior is capable of genuine kindness, the shining example of this is when he felt bad for Chef Pee Pee's suffering on his birthday, and as an apology, threw a surprise birthday party for him, with Joseph and Cody's help! He even apologizes for treating Chef Pee Pee badly for the entire time they've known each other (although, thanks to the new status quo, this is rendered redundant via negative continuity).\n\nDespite being a generally dumb character, he has shown to act smart on some occasions such as \"Bowser Junior's 1st Grade! Part 5\" where he states that blue stars are hotter than red stars, in \"Cool Cody!\" where Bowser Junior figures out how to change Cody back to normal, in \"Bowser Junior's Bad Luck!\" he states that superstitions are not real and that all the bad luck he was getting were coincidences.\n\nPets[]\n\nCrusty[]\n\nCrusty was Junior's pet from Bowser Junior's Pet!. In a swim-off with Cody's pet rock, the water makes Crusty deformed and therefore \"killing\" it.\n\nStinky[]\n\nStinky was Junior's pet that replaced Crusty in Bowser Junior's Pet!. It was a bad idea however, because he sprays Joseph and Cody. He later gets beaten to death by Bowser.\n\nTerrance[]\n\nTerrance was named the way he is because it was like \"Terrance-ula.\" He made his first appearance in The Tarantula!.\n\nWormy[]\n\nWormy was Junior’s pet from Jeffy's Pet!. Junior thought he was a worm when he was really a snake. He first showed it to Chef Pee Pee, scaring him. After trading pets with Jeffy, Wormy scares Mario and Rosalina. They later trade back.\n\nChompy[]\n\nChompy was Junior’s pet Chain Chomp from Bowser Junior's Dog!. Sometimes Junior takes care of him, sometimes he doesn’t. But Junior still loves him. And he’s sad upon learning that Chef Pee Pee let him run away in Precious the Rapper!. Chompy didn’t return after that, and because of the Cease and Desist, he is highly unlikely to come back.\n\nOrange Zebra[]\n\nOrange Zebra was Junior’s pet from Jeffy's Pet Tiger!.\n\nChildren[]\n\nDespite his age, Junior also has kids, and all of them were taken away from him to due to him being too young to have kids at the time.\n\nJunior Junior[]\n\nJunior Junior, or JJ for short, was created thanks to Cody’s B-B-B-Baby Machine in Chef Pee Pee's Kids. He had Chef Pee Pee’s head and Junior’s body. He was created along with Chaz who had Chef Pee Pee’s head and Cody’s body. However, they were given away because Junior and Cody were too young to have kids.\n\nJeffy Junior II[]\n\nJeffy Junior II was created thanks to Harry's impregnator. He was a hybrid of Jeffy and Junior. However, he destroyed Junior’s Golden Thomas and Jeffy’s cat piano. Jeffy Junior II was later sold to Jackie Chu.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nChef Pee Pee[]\n\nIn earlier videos, Bowser Junior always annoyed Chef Pee Pee with his requests, making Chef Pee Pee hate him. Because of this, every time when Junior is about to do something that could be dangerous in some way. In later videos, he would stop bothering Chef Pee Pee and asking him for things, even though Chef Pee Pee still hates him.\n\nChef Pee Pee, similar to his hopes and dreams of killing Bowser, sometimes hopes he kills Junior in the process, but sadly for Chef Pee Pee, this never happens. He also annoys him by regularly asking to play toys with him. Junior loves spending time with Chef Pee Pee but he never showed love back to Junior, there are rare occasions where Chef Pee Pee is nice to Junior, such as at the end of Bowser Junior's Big Vacation!, taking him to Disney World without so much as a complaint. For some reason, he is not angry or insulted from Chef Pee Pee calling him a Brat/Idiot/Slut.\n\nIn the SML Movie “Bowser Junior’s Doll!”, Junior has made a better hatred for Chef Pee because he thinks that he is a snitch. When Chef Pee Pee goes to Junior's room while wearing disguises, He said “Nah, it’s just me n**ga!” and leaves his room in laughter much to Junior's Fury. As Chef Pee Pee gives Junior a bowl of macaroni and cheese, he was tricking him to give him macaroni and cheese much to Junior's Fury. As Junior has had enough with Chef Pee Pee for pranking him, He gets the voodoo doll and thinks that the voodoo doll is Chef Pee Pee and begins to hit it and send it off to space along with Chef Pee Pee being send off to Space. As Junior tries to apologize to Chef Pee Pee for his selfish behavior, he was wondering where he is. As Chef Pee Pee was suffocating to death in space, He yells to Junior's name.\n\nIn \"Bowser Junior's New Room!\", Junior is now Chef Pee Pee's roommate, much to the despair and annoyance of the latter, yet to the pleasure do the former because Junior's old room was taken over by his father as punishment for eating his strawberry donut and sneaking out of his room. After Junior says he loves him, Chef Pee Pee mutters the same, yet does not say it directly to Junior.\n\nAs of \"Bowser Junior's Prank Gone Wrong!\", it's safe to say that Junior has lost every form of respect toward Chef Pee Pee, making him deaf and wishing he never existed. It's also clear that Junior is very hypocritical towards Chef Pee Pee as when the latter has shown to care for him such as in \"Bowser Junior's Rat Problem!\", Junior never seems to return the favor.\n\nAs of now, he is now being handled for his antics by Chef Pee Pee.\n\nStatus: Neutral (Enemies on Chef Pee Pee’s side)\n\nBowser[]\n\nBowser Junior frequently interrupts his dad while he watches Charleyyy and Friends. Bowser occasionally likes his son, but he hates when he annoys him. He basically annoys him a lot and sometimes it leads to Bowser getting on him and on more than one occasion abuse him. However, this was in older episodes. In later episodes, Bowser showed his good side to Junior, saying that he loves his son even though he still hates when he annoys him. But despite this, Bowser would always protect his son no matter what.\n\nStatus: Father and Son\n\nJoseph[]\n\nBowser Junior and Joseph (whose last name being \"His Friend from School\") are best friends that mostly meet at school or at Junior's home to hang out. What often happens is, if somebody is cooler than Junior, Joseph is on their side rather than on Junior's side. They have surprisingly made out a lot, especially in the Playtime Series.\n\nIn some episodes, Joseph and Junior do not get along. For example, when Joseph got a new shell in Joseph's New Shell!, Joseph started bullying him and even beat him up with his new friends. Junior also invited Joseph over for a sleepover in Bowser Junior's Wings!, when he attempted to break Joseph's wings with a hammer because he was jealous of his new shell as it meant stealing the girl, he had a crush on.\n\nOn some occasions, Junior can be very harsh to Joseph. For example, in \"The South Pole Santa!\", when Joseph suggested adding milk to the hot chocolate, Junior had a fit and poured the hot water on Joseph giving him third degree burns and in \"Joseph's New Shell!\", he ignored Joseph's injury by eating Cheeto's instead.\n\nDespite all of this events, they still get along the most out of the series.\n\nStatus: Best Friends\n\nCody[]\n\nBowser Junior and Cody get along pretty well with each other. Like Joseph, he invites Cody to his house regularly. There are many times when Bowser Junior is really mean and harsh to Cody. Cody keeps trying to tell him the truth about things (like the Sun being a star, Pluto no longer being a planet or the Earth being round), but Junior never listens, and his nonsensical logic and denial make it unfairly hard and stressful for Cody to reason with him. In The School Project!, Cody and Junior got into an argument because he broke Junior's toy. Joseph also took Cody's side as they both told Junior it was an accident.\n\nCody sometimes even acts very harsh towards Junior like in Cody's Revenge where Cody had enough of Junior bullying him and decides to blackmail him and if Junior doesn't do whatever Cody says he will tell his dad that he broke a bowl. Throughout Cody's Revenge, Cody was cruel towards Junior by making him do stuff that he definitely will regret. Cody even ruined Bowser Junior's Golden Thomas.\n\nCody is shown to be very sexual towards Bowser Junior as every chance he gets, he will try to molest and/or spank him. While Junior is very well aware of this, he will always be Cody's best friend, but Cody fails to see this. In The Remote!, Cody uses the remote to rape Junior along with everyone else in the world for 5 years. Cody also like to take advantage of Junior's loyalty.\n\nMost of the time, Junior likes to make fun of Cody's mom because of how fat she is by calling her animal names and how she should be in the ocean or a zoo. While Cody sometimes ignores this, Junior's jokes can go way too far which makes Cody want to beat him down or even joke about how Bowser Junior doesn't know his real mom. In the present, Cody is now used to Junior making fun of his mom.\n\nIn 2020 and 2022, Junior has shown to have become far less fond of Cody as he (from lightest to harshest) purposefully got him in so much trouble with the school principal that he crumbled his chances of being the second youngest person to ever attend Harvard without having to pay a dime, went home and napped like a baby while Cody waited at a McDonalds line all night long and as soon as it backfired, made up a story that made Cody seem more guilty so that he would not have to take responsibility, physically abused him even though every bone in his body had been broken and he was in a wheelchair, accused Cody of being racist when he wasn't and got him in trouble with his parents by telling them he \"said\" the N-word, and even got his terminally sick friend arrested. These actions suggest that Junior no longer cares about Cody whatsoever and only hangs out with him to make fun of him. This is further evident as of Cody's Cavity where Junior enjoys watching Cody suffer and is actually excited to see him die.\n\nBut in later episodes, Junior feels bad for him and Joseph torturing Cody and now is a good friend to Cody.\n\nStatus: Best Friends\n\nToad[]\n\nBefore late 2016, Bowser Junior usually hung out with Toad. They were very good friends, although Toad usually got Junior in trouble, such as in April Fools! This was in the older episodes. Later on, their friendship came to an end when Bowser Junior matured more. Junior later moved on to hang out with Cody, Joseph, Jeffy, and Richard Goodman. Toad would later lose his status as the main character as of mid-late 2017, and Bowser Junior hung out with him less frequently.\n\nStatus: Friends (formerly best friends)\n\nMario[]\n\nEven though they rarely interact with each other, they seem to get along quite well in the recent episodes. In Bowser Junior's Game Night 3, They can get along well when yelling at Jeffy. They often get along well too in Jeffy's Birthday! and Smart Jeffy and says that whenever Junior is around, Jeffy gets less involved with him. However, in Mario and Bowser's Stupid and Crazy Adventure, Mario implied that he hated Junior. Despite that, in the recent videos, they often get along well.\n\nStatus: Friends (enemies originally)\n\nJeffy[]\n\nBowser Junior met Jeffy for the first time in Bowser Junior's Game Night 3. At first, Junior thought Jeffy was weird but overtime, the two bond and start a strong relationship. In recent videos, Junior and Jeffy go on adventures, play together more frequently and even do criminal activity together.\n\nHowever, there are some rare occasions where Jeffy and Junior betray each other in certain situations. For example, in Jeffy's Punishment! Junior gets mad at Jeffy to reacting to being shocked and even wants him to leave the school.\n\nIn Jeffy's Kids!, Junior sees Jeffy's kids and starts eating them. Jeffy sees Junior for eating P*ss hole 1 and 2 and even calls the police to have him arrested leaving Junior confused and upset because he never knew P*ss hole 1 and 2 were Jeffy's actual kids.\n\nIn Jeffy's Pokemon Card!, Jeffy betrays Junior once again by being selfish about a Pollytoad-EX which was the only Polly Junior was missing in his collection. Junior then began to develop a hatred for Jeffy throughout the episode. At the end, all was lost when Jeffy burns the Pollytoad-EX in front of Junior leaving him upset.\n\nIn Jeffy Gets Framed!, Junior had lied about Jeffy and had told Marvin and Rose, that it was Jeffy who had broke the vase filled with Rose's parent's ashes. Also, Cody and Joseph had also said that it was Jeffy. So, Jeffy had made all of their lives miserable as he had broken Ken up to pieces, and blamed Cody for eating a Baconator from Wendy's by writing a note along with Wendy's wrapping paper. As Cody was Jewish and cannot eat pork, his parents had gave him a \"Spanknator\". For Joseph, he had paid Brooklyn T. Guy $100 dollars to pretend that Brooklyn Guy was Joseph's mother and wanted to be family with Joseph again, and then Jeffy had shot her with a \"gun\". For Junior, he had also paid $100 dollars to Chef Pee Pee to make it look like Jeffy had killed Chef Pee Pee, and put his body parts in a soup.\n\nIn Jeffy Loses His Teeth!, Junior caused Jeffy's teeth to fall out by playing T-Ball and hits him in the mouth. Junior also appears to dislike The Bunny Do\n\nBut currently. The duo seems to get along just fine, while Junior deals with Jeffy's lack of intelligence and Jeffy deals with Junior's problems with life. The two share a strong relationship and together. They do all sorts of misadventures. Like when they skipped school in Jeffy and Junior Skip School!, they sneaked out of the house without permission in Jeffy and Junior Sneak Out!, they sneaked away to Disney World during a pandemic in Jeffy and Junior Sneak to Disney World!, they even went to prison together in Jeffy and Junior Go To Prison!\n\nStatus: Best Friends\n\nRosalina[]\n\nBowser Junior first met Rosalina in Jeffy's Birthday! when he and his friends were about to go on the SkyTubes at Chuck E. Cheese's with Jeffy and found her to be really hot.\n\nIn Smart Jeffy, Junior caught Rosalina's attention by calling her \"Busty Tits\" and told her that Jeffy had an accident on the trampoline that was in his playroom. In Jeffy and Junior Sneak To Disney World!, he, along with Jeffy and Joseph were caught by Rosalina. Bowser Junior calls her an old lady.\n\nBut it's unknown if these two characters share a good relationship or not.\n\nStatus: Neutral\n\nBrooklyn T. Guy[]\n\nBefore Season 9, Junior and The Brooklyn Guy formerly had bad blood against each other. They usually get into big fights in the Home Alone series and they didn’t like each other in the past years.\n\nIn Bowser Junior Goes To Military School!, Brooklyn T. Guy, as his full name was revealed, treated Junior and the other students badly, as they went through a dangerous course, as the other students were killed by an explosion, but Junior made it. Brooklyn T. Guy was impressed. Later, Junior was trapped and ate disgusting things, including nails, and was even forced to watch Big Hero 6, as Brooklyn Guy even burned Thomas. After military school, Junior was not the same.\n\nIn Bowser Junior's Package!, he jacked his Gak which caused him to get revenge on him for backstabbing him.\n\nIn Bowser Junior's Lottery Ticket!, he also stole Junior's winning lottery ticket and spent all the money.\n\nHowever, this was in the older episodes. Later on, they seemed to get along, but in Jeffy's Kids!, Junior ate Puss Hole 1 and 2, so Jeffy called the cops. Brooklyn T. Guy then arrested him, calling him a “cereal killer”, and he was taken off to jail. But after the release of 2 Tickets, they are now currently friends as their past as enemies are over.\n\nStatus: Friends (formerly enemies)\n\nHansel[]\n\nIn Bowser Junior's Stinky Friend!, Junior was shown to be very sympathetic for Hansel (or \"Stinky\" as he calls him.) He snuck Hansel into his home and provided him with Chef Pee Pee's bed, as well as cheese balls, earning him the nickname \"Cheeseball Man.\" Later on in the video, he'd try to get Hansel a job as an anesthesiologist, which didn't last very long. Eventually, Junior reluctantly had to kick Hansel out. Hansel stated that he loved Junior and that he'd never forget him before disappearing.\n\nStatus: Friends/Neutral\n\nBully Bill[]\n\nAlong with Jeffy, Junior and Bully are secondary archenemies. Junior hates Bully because he took his 'Golden Thomas Train' from him and beats him up, but Junior retaliates by putting 'chopsticks' in his eyes, which causes him to give him back his 'Golden Thomas Train' toy and ran off screaming in pain. And When Jeffy was beating Bully Bill up, He was cheering his friend on. He also hates Bully because he always bullies Jeffy and never learns his lessons.\n\nStatus: Enemies\n\nPenelope[]\n\nWhen Penelope first showed up in videos, Junior attempted to subtly ask her out but she rejected him due to finding Cody more attractive and despite making it seem like it was because of his buff body it was later revealed to be because of his pimples. Due to Penelope rejecting him, Junior began to make fun of her frequently to hide his romantic feelings, saying things about her hair and other assorted things. In one episode Junior found out Penelope was dating Bully and so worked behind the scenes to make their relationship fall apart leading to Penelope falling in love with him for being a \"bad boy\". Junior even played a game with Penelope in order to get her to go on a date and kiss him. However, he ended up getting sick and was unable to get a kiss, and Penelope got sick in return, ending the date early. Junior has also shown jealousy over anyone else being with Penelope; for example the time when Cody and Penelope kissed which he took a picture of to show to Ken to try to end his and Cody's relationship as revenge. Eventually in Junior's Crazy Girlfriend!, Junior and Penelope finally got together in 2023, but due to Penelope being easily jealous and insecure, Junior struggles in the relationship. However, they fixed their issues and the two are still together. Junior, hearing that Penelope was going to a party with a guy there (Timmy), thought Penelope would cheat on him and so asked for other girls' numbers. Junior abandoned this idea in favor of a fake Instagram account. Junior would eventually cheat on Penelope and get a herpes scare, which leads him to admit to what he did to her. They temporarily break up before Junior stages an abduction of Penelope and pretends to save her, eventually getting them back together.\n\nJunior and Penelope have kissed four times; once each in Chicken Pox!, Chef Pee Pee's Girlfriend!, Junior's Scary Bump!, and Junior Kidnaps Penelope!. He has also sexually assaulted Penelope after the latter was turned into a piece of broccoli.\n\nStatus: Girlfriend,\n\nTimmy Huckerdoo[]\n\nInitially, Junior and Timmy didn't have a good relationship as the former was shown to dislike the latter during their first interaction in \"The Firework Problem!\". Junior even claims to Timmy directly that he hates him after getting arrested by the Brooklyn Guy. He was shown to also dislike Timmy in \"Junior the Crazy Boyfriend\", when he thought his girlfriend Penelope was cheating on him with Timmy. Cody tries to deny it, but Junior didn't believe him until the end of the episode.\n\nAs time went on, however, they became decent friends as Junior was shown to invite Timmy to his house to have a playtime with his other friends in \"Junior's Big Playtime!\". He even agreed to be apart of his boy band with Cody in \"Cody's Boy Band\" until he quit later on as the songs became too homosexual for him.\n\nOverall, they get along just fine nowadays and don't show any dislikes towards each other. This was changed in \"Neighborhood Watch!\" when Junior mistreated Timmy by not wanting him to be in his group (The Skeeter Boys) and gets frustrated at him when he makes homosexual comments. Even when he tells Timmy to commit multiple crimes, he still isn't sure if he should be in the group. At the end, Junior says he's now a new member, only to shout out \"sike\" at Timmy and laugh at him, along with Joseph. So it is unsure if Timmy is apart of the trio or not.\n\nStatus: Neutral\n\nAppearance[]\n\nJunior has dark black eyes with white pupils on the underside. He wears a large bib and four small bracelets with two on each arm. He has skinny arms and legs and slightly long fingernails. He also inherits his father's red hair and pale-yellow skin.\n\nIn his human form, Junior has fair skin, black eyes, short orange hair, and horns. He wears a white bib that reads \"JR\" in black, an orange t-shirt, his black wristbands, green shorts, and orange shoes (his turtle form doesn't have shoes).\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nRed Button: In the episode, The Magical Button! It's seen that Junior can wish for anything at any given time at the cost of a humans life, only 7 billion, chances.\n\nFlight: In Joseph's New Shell!, Joseph states that he can fly and Junior can’t the hand holding Junior can fly him, showing he can fly as well.\n\nTime loop: in some episodes he seems to have the power to become stuck in a timeloop without him knowing, such as in Groundhog day, where he kept reliving the same day\n\nTemporary Powers[]\n\nElectrokinesis: In the episode SuperPowers!, Junior and his friends get struck by lightning which grants them superpowers. After believing himself to be powerless, Junior discovers the ability to create electricity. He first used this ability to shock Joseph with his fingers. After a while, Junior then releases a large blast of electricity after being bullied. Junior's electricity is vulnerable to both rubber and metal such as when Cody shapeshifted into balloon and then into a washing machine. Junior's electricity was capable of disabling his, Cody's and Joseph's superpowers.\n\nSuper Flatulence: In the same episode, Junior possessed the ability to create a disturbing gaseous smell from his butt.\n\n\"Come on, Cody. I'm not stupid, you're stupid. That was lame. You should've called him a bib-wearing baby.\"\n\n— Junior reading Cody's mind in SuperPowers 2\n\nTelepathy: After suffering radiation poisoning from the microwave, Junior had discovered the ability to read the minds of others. He first discovered this ability by reading Cody's mind and hearing him call Junior a \"bib-wearing baby\". He then used this ability on Chef Pee Pee after he possibly tried to molest him. He then heard Joseph say the same thing while he was burning alive. He then heard Brooklyn Guy confess to the exact same thing.\n\nPyrokinesis: In Baby Mutant Turtles, Junior was shown to be able to Breathe Fire, Setting Mario on fire.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"So, guys, what do you wanna do today?\"\n\n\"Oh man!\"\n\n\"THE SUN IS A PLANET!\"\n\n\"CHEF PEE PEE!\"\n\n\"Hey Chef Pee Pee, what are you doing?\n\n\"CHUCK E.

But it might be possible he makes mom jokes on other people due to him not having a mom himself (along with Joseph) and takes it out on his friends.\n\nJeffy interacts with Junior, more then Jeffy interacts with Joseph or Cody.\n\nWhenever Junior does something bad, he lies about it in order to keep himself from getting into trouble.\n\nHe has attempted suicide twice. The first time was by hanging, but he had a really short neck making him unable. The second time was by laying on the train tracks to get hit by a train.\n\nBowser Junior has saved a life before, In Bowser Junior's Pool Party, he saves Cody from drowning, but ends up drowning at the very end. He has done bad things but he has done very heroic things like saving Thomas from the house fire in Bowser's House Fire.\n\nHe might have a big butt which is probably why Cody has a crush on him and calls him tight butt. This may likely be Cody saying that as a way to try and hit on him.\n\nBowser Junior's full name is rarely mentioned as most of the time he is just called Junior.\n\nHowever, as of February 13, 2021. Bowser Junior's full name is no longer used due to Logan receiving a cease and desist letter from Nintendo. So now Junior is his official name.\n\nIn some cases, Junior would represent \"Envy\", judging the fact that he has been selfish to Cody (including his large box of crayons).\n\nLogan has stated in a Chilly vlog that the current plush for Bowser Junior will be retired soon because it has a scorch mark on his face from Bowser Junior's Fireworks! that Logan doesn't want people to notice.\n\nJunior's behavior is somewhat similar to that of Eric Cartman from the TV show, South Park as both Junior and Cartman have a spoiled bratty, rude and antagonistic behavior.\n\nHe is also quite similar to Dennis the Menace from The Beano comics and Norman Price from Fireman Sam. As Junior, Dennis and Norman are very mischievous and troublesome.\n\nLogan has said that Junior is his favorite character because he brings out his inner kid.\n\nHis favorite superhero is Spider-Man. In Bowser Junior's Halloween, Junior and Joseph were both dressed like Spider-Man, and in Bowser Junior's 7th Birthday!, his birthday party was Spider-Man themed.\n\nBowser Junior's gamertag is \"GetRektFgtLol\", but it was reported because he kept ruthlessly insulting everyone, especially Black Yoshi.\n\nBowser Junior has burned down more buildings than any other character in the series with 2, including the original house, and his first-grade school.\n\nBowser Junior maybe the reason why Mario met Jeffy, because he burned down the old house which caused the gang to move to the apartment that Jeffy would eventually come to.\n\nIf you typed \"Bowser Junior\" on YouTube's search bar, SML's latest video, The Little Boy Who Cried Wolf! is the first result. This might change to a different video in the future.\n\nBowser Junior has had more birthday episodes than any other character in the series with eight. He's also had the most highlight for ageing, showing his birth in Mario and Luigi's Stupid and Dumb Adventures, and bringing him back at 2 years old, and now is 14 years old.\n\nOne time, Bowser Junior locked himself in his closet for a week straight.\n\nIn one episode, Bowser Junior Needs Glasses!, he is shown that he needs contacts in his eyes to see.\n\nIn a Dabhdude live stream, Logan stated that the reason Junior is in so many videos is because Logan found it hard to think of ideas for the other characters.\n\nHe pronounces \"ever\" as \"evur\" sometimes due to his unusual speech.\n\nHis favorite song is \"All-Star\" by Smash Mouth.[1]\n\nThe reason why he got sent to military school is that he got into Bowser's clown car and broke the glass table in the video Bowser Junior's Clown Car!, and also in the video, Cody's Revenge!, he got blackmailed for throwing a temper tantrum after losing a game of Chess, throwing Ken, breaking a bowl of Raisin Bran, screaming and behaving badly, and breaking a jar that was in tribute to Mittens\n\nHis theme song is \"Get Outside\" by Jason Farnham.\n\nBowser Junior's birth sign is Libra.\n\nIt was revealed in Bowser Junior's Biggest Fear!, that Junior had Sidonglobophobia (fear of cotton balls).\n\nBowser Junior is known to have a hatred towards Big Hero 6, this is done as he is voiced by Logan Thirtyacre, and Logan too hates Big Hero 6. Bowser Junior and Mario are personas of Logan, and often portray his character through these characters.\n\nHis favorite number could possibly be seven, due to him thinking there were 7 pins in Truth Or Dare!, He claims that he can stay up until 7 AM in Bowser Junior's All Nighter!, and there are 7 parts of the Bowser Junior's Summer School series. When he asked for Chef Pee Pee to make food, he said to pick one meal most of the time he'll say \"How about seven?\" In Bowser Junior Goes To Disney World! Part 1 when Bowser Junior wanted to get a zillion boxes of Doofy-O's to find the knife, though Chef Pee Pee didn't have a zillion dollars he said \"Well um... How about seven?\" In Bowser Junior's Summer Vacation when Chef Pee Pee denied Junior on getting a million toys he said: “How about seven?”. In The Fortune Cookies!, he wanted 7 Fortune Cookies.\n\nIn SuperPowers 2, it was confirmed that Junior was adopted by Bowser, but the episode may not be canon, due to one of the characters dying, and reappearing later.\n\nBowser Junior is the first person to break a world record, before Shrek.\n\nDespite having the second most deaths right behind Toad (see List of character deaths, Bowser Junior has also murdered the second most people (22 people) right behind Does Bad Things Guy. (30 people).\n\nJunior has the most deaths In the SML franchise so far with 23 deaths.\n\nIt is revealed that Bowser Junior is one of Logan's favorite characters along with Brooklyn T. Guy in one of Dabhdude's Livestream.[2]\n\nLike Logan, Junior's favorite Pokemon is Poliwhirl, coincidentally this is also Satoshi Tajiri's (The creator of Pokemon) favorite Pokemon.\n\nOut of the trio, Junior is in middle of the three due to Cody being born in February and Joseph being born a month after Junior in October.\n\nJunior is shown to be athletic at times, mainly when beats up Cody.\n\nJunior is stated to be based on Haleigh, Logan, and Lance's younger half-sister, more so in earlier episodes where he was defined more as bratty and bossy.\n\nEven though videos made after they move out to the Apartment, may indicate the character's behavior now resembles more the personal life of the creator.\n\nIt's possible he has Bipolar disorder as he sometimes overreacts and has mood swings frequently.\n\nHe cries over spilled stuff as shown in Chef Pee Pee Quits! Part 1 and in Chef Pee Pee's Restaurant!\n\nDespite that he was born in late September in 2008, in The Call Of Duty Problem, which takes place two weeks before Christmas, Bowser states that Junior \"just had a birthday\", which implies that Junior has a December birthdate.\n\nJunior's favorite show was Doofy The Dragon when he was younger, as revealed in Bowser's House Fire!. however as revealed in the SML Gaming video, \"WHAT DID WE BUILD?? MINECRAFT\", he said that his favorite show is \"Family Guy\".[3][4]\n\nIt is revealed in \"Jeffy's Taco Tuesday!\" that he gets a $20 allowance each week, although he doesn't get it for doing chores, his dad just gives him the money every week for no reason although it's likely Bowser gives it to him to keep him out of his hair. It is additionally possible that his dad gave it to him for being so good to him.\n\nJunior's favorite food is macaroni and cheese, This has been shown in many videos such as Bowser Junior's Macaroni and Evil Chef Pee Pee! In Bowser Junior Gets Jinxed!, he even choses to have his essay be about how much he loves mac and cheese.\n\nAlong with Bowser and Margaret, his favorite holiday is revealed to be Thanksgiving in The Big Thanksgiving.\n\nBowser Junior is kept being called a \"n*gga\" by Chef Pee Pee in older Videos.\n\nJunior is revealed to be a Flat Earther (a person who believes that the earth is flat) as said in Cody's Sister and The Science Fair when he claims the Earth to be flat.\n\nDespite liking Thomas and Friends, he is never seen watching the TV show. It's possible that he only likes the merchandise, or he does indeed watch it, but off-screen.\n\nBowser Junior's personality is somewhat similar to how Bowser Junior in the Mario franchise sometimes acts with how both Juniors frequently show a bratty and selfish nature and both Juniors have a bad temper, which has them be often rude towards others. Unlike the Bowser Junior of the Mario Franchise, who is very intelligent and always has a positive relationship with his father, SML's Bowser Junior is often very dim-witted and the relationship between him and his father is on and off.\n\nAs revealed in Cody's Cavity, Junior thinks France is not in Europe. He also thinks that Ratatouille was filmed in France even though it was animated. This suggests that he does not believe in animated movies and thinks all of them are filmed and that they are always filmed where they're set, which would mean that he has poor knowledge on cinematography.\n\nThe Junior human puppet went viral on TikTok because a user called felpav which is now private used the puppet to react to famous TikTokers and reused dimetrees sounds when he yelled at a sphynx cat called Lola. Felpav has 692 followers on Tiktok with his latest video of Bowser Jr. Puppet reacting/duetting to Elias Open or Sweden's 6ix9ine as he calls him due to his pædophilic behavior\n\nBowser Junior is shown to like the game Fortnite: Battle Royale, as shown in Bowser Junior's Daddy Problem\", in \"Jeffy Skips School\", \"Mr. Goodman's Credit Card\", and in Jeffy Goes To The Arcade\n\nA minor plot hole with Junior is that in Bowser Junior's first appearances, he was 3 turning 4, and the videos took place in 2013-2014, therefore making him born in 2010, but as of \"Bowser Junior's 11th Birthday, Which takes place in September 2019, so he was born in 2008.\n\nHowever, Logan could have possibly either forgot Junior's age in his first appearance or his age is misconstrued.\n\nIf Junior's age being misconstrued by others is the case, then it makes sense why Bowser Junior is in the Fourth grade as most 11-year-olds are supposed to be in 5th or 6th grade. This was because of Jackie Chu having the second-grade helding from 2016 to 2018 which pushed back Junior and his friends going to third grade.\n\nBowser Junior's height or weight has never been revealed, but if Chef Pee Pee is 5'11 , and Bowser Junior is half the size of him, then Bowser Junior is possibly 4'10 inches tall.\n\nBowser Junior doesn't swear uncensored very often.\n\nThough Bowser Junior's Xbox was shot by Black Yoshi in The Call Of Duty Problem, Junior is seen using it to play Fortnite in Bowser Junior's Daddy Problem, so Junior could have possibly gotten a new Xbox later on or The Call of Duty Problem was non-canon.\n\nThough Junior receives wings in Bowser Junior's Wings it was confirmed to be a one-time thing.\n\nJunior has the most birthday specials out of all the characters that have birthday specials, the one who has the second most birthday specials is Jeffy.\n\nIt is revealed in The Prank!, that Junior does not want to go to college, while in Bowser Junior's Girlfriend Problem!, Joseph wants to become a doctor, which requires multiple years of college.\n\nBowser Junior has dated four characters. These characters are Judy in Bowser Junior's Girlfriend!, Ping and Pong in Bowser Junior's Girlfriend Problem!, and Heidi in The Redo Button.\n\nIn Chef Pee Pee Quits! Part 1, it is revealed that Bowser Junior doesn't like hot sauce while Bowser is putting hot sauce on the sandwich he was making.\n\nIn the old house and the apartment, Junior would mostly play with his trains and hang out with Joseph and Cody, however in the new house, Junior no longer plays with his trains but still hangs out with Joseph and Cody.\n\nIn Hurricane Jeffy he believed that Hurricane Sally was a person.\n\nJunior is often shown to have a strange obsession with wanting to eat things that are not edible such as eating play-doh in The Teleportation Machine! and wanting to eat Toilet Paper in Bowser Junior's Revenge!\n\nDespite not being the main protagonist of SML, he has more screen time than Mario. However Mario is starting to have the same screen time as him.\n\nHe's the first non-afro descendent character who used the n-word.\n\nAs of the video Meeting Charleyyy!, his dad's name was revealed to be \"Braxton\", meaning that Junior's full name is \"Braxton Jr\".\n\nBowser Junior used to be one of the most loved SML characters but his behavior in recent videos has caused people to hate him to the point where some people want him to be killed off permanently.\n\nNetflix & Kill is likely the first video where he said the exact words \"So guys, what do you wanna do today?\"\n\nIn the thumbnail for Bowser Junior's Macaroni, the thumbnail uses a bootlegged version instead of the official plush that was used.\n\nA few stunt doubles for him have different eyebrows. This is because San-ei, the plush manufacturer, had re-released it some time after it's initial release.\n\nIn Neighborhood Watch!, He stated that his friend group is called the \"Skeeter Boyz\".\n\nJunior is the only character in the SML universe to contract rabies twice, once being in Bowser Junior Gets Rabies! and again in Jeffy's Joyride!.\n\nJunior is a Drake fan.\n\nGallery[]\n\nSources[]"
