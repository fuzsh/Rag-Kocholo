The Junior Jacks drumsticks are adorned with flags that include six stars for the six states of New England.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary war children were not able to actively serve; however this did not stop young Americans from wanting to do their part. Younger revolutionaries did not only take up the slack in homes and businesses, but could be found playing drums and holding banners on the battle fields.\n\nTeam Colors: Blue & Red"
