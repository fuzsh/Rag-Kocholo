These violations create an unsafe sleeping environment for infants.\n\nRH Baby & Child Recalls Jeune French Contemporary Upholstered Panel Cribs Due to Choking Hazard\n\nThe cylindrical metal inserts in the crib’s wooden frame can become loose and detach, posing a choking hazard.\n\nAttom Tech Recalls LED Light-up Jelly Ring Toys Due to Ingestion Hazard; Violation of Federal Regulations for Battery-Operated Toys; Sold Exclusively on Amazon.com\n\nThe recalled light-up jelly ring toys violate the mandatory federal battery-operated toy regulation because the rings contain button cell batteries that fit within CPSC’s small parts cylinder, and can be easily accessed without requiring the use of a common household tool. When button cell batteries are swallowed, the ingested batteries can cause serious injuries, internal chemical burns and death, posing an ingestion hazard to children.\n\nPeace Industry Group Recalls Youth All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) Due to Risk of Serious Injury or Death and Violation of Federal ATV Safety Regulations\n\nThe youth ATVs fail to comply with the requirements of the federal mandatory ATV safety standard. The handlebars pose a laceration hazard if the child rider’s body or head impacts the handlebars at a high rate of speed. Additionally, the parking brakes fail to hold, posing a collision hazard. The ATVs are also missing the required safety reflectors for vehicles intended for use by children 10 years and older. The 518 CY125ATV-6 model’s footguards pose a laceration, contusion, and amputation hazard if the rider’s foot enters the rear wheel environment. ATVs that fail to meet these mandatory safety requirements pose a risk of serious injury or death.\n\nPapablic Infant Swings Recalled Due to Suffocation Hazard; Violations of Federal Regulations for Infant Sleep Products; Imported by Shenzhen Two Pony\n\nThe swings pose a suffocation risk because they were marketed, intended, or designed for infant sleep, and they have an incline angle greater than 10 degrees in violation of the federal safety regulations for Infant Sleep Products and the Safe Sleep for Babies Act. The swings also violate other requirements for infant swings and the labeling requirements for Reese’s Law because the remote contains a button or coin-cell battery.\n\nBeberoad Love New Moon Travel Bassinets Recalled Due to Fall Hazard; Violation of Federal Regulations for Infant Sleep Products; Sold by Beberoadlove\n\nThe recalled bassinets violate federal safety regulations for Infant Sleep Products because they do not have a stand, posing a fall hazard if used on elevated surfaces.\n\nAbout the U.S. CPSC\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risk of injury or death associated with the use of thousands of types of consumer products. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product-related incidents cost the nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC's work to ensure the safety of consumer products has contributed to a decline in the rate of injuries associated with consumer products over the past 50 years.\n\nFederal law prohibits any person from selling products subject to a Commission ordered recall or a voluntary recall undertaken in consultation with the CPSC.\n\nFor lifesaving information:\n\nVisit CPSC.gov.\n\nSign up to receive our email alerts.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Instagram @USCPSC and Twitter @USCPSC.\n\nReport a dangerous product or product-related injury on www.SaferProducts.gov.\n\nCall CPSC’s Hotline at 800-638-2772 (TTY 800-638-8270).\n\nContact a media specialist.\n\nChoose Your Recall Emails Get Notified About Each Recall via Email."
