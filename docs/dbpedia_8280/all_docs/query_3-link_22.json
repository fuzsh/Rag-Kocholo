        "text": "The Blues Jr has a larger cab, 12” speaker, full eq, reverb, master volume, and onboard “fat” switch. It’s an entirely different sounding amp from the Pro Jr.\n\nThe Pro is the ultimate in simplicity. Small box cab, 10” speaker, just volume and tone. If you want breakup, it gets LOUD.\n\nThe Pro sounds smaller and boxier, but might actually be louder. If you’re mic’ing it, external EQ can make it sound wonderful. It’s a killer recording amp. I gig with one all the time.\n\nThe Blues Jr is a very popular amp that I find lacks nuts in a loud band mix. I think the Pro cuts better. YMMV. Pro Jr jacked into a larger cab is really a thing of beauty. Plug that sucker into a 2x12, 4x12, 4x10, etc and it’ll definitely get your tail wagging. But that does defeat the portability aspect of it.\n\nThey’re both EL84 based amps, but neither sound like a lot of those designs. The Blues Jr is definitely more fender voiced. You’ll probably find it sounds like a baby version of your HRD. Definitely more manageable for smaller rooms, especially with the master volume.\n\nThe Pro Jr to me doesn’t sound like a Fender amp. To me it sounds like a baby Marshall. It definitely gives off 60’s 18 watt Marshall vibes. Big time. A little boxier with the smaller cab and 10” speaker, but that’s definitely where it sits, to my ears.\n\nI have never played through a Pro Junior but have heard great things about them. My current main amp is a Hot Rod Deluxe IV and it's great. I was thinking of getting something in the 15-watt range and at that price point instead of PRRI price. What's the main sonic difference that you guys hear between the Blues and Pro Juniors?\n\nThe main difference to me is how a master volume amp responds to what I do vs the more old-fashioned touch responsive thing that the pro jr is. I don't like master volume amps unless they're dead clean. Every master volume amp I've used has distortion that responds kind of flatly, like an overdrive pedal.\n\nThe speaker and reverb differences might be more important to others, but not to me.\n\nI much prefer the Pro Junior. The Blues Jr is fine for what it is, but the master volume does nothing for me, because in just about any gig situation with a 15W amp short of an acoustic coffeeshop show, you're going to want the master wide open for maximum headroom. Onboard reverb seems like a nice feature as well, but the SS short-tank reverb is underwhelming if you're used to the spring reverb in a BF/SF amp. Just about any pedal does a better job in my opinion. I find that even with an efficient speaker, the Pro Jr. gets dirty rather quickly, but it does so in a smoother, more musical way than the Blues Jr, which is hampered by the extra circuitry. I'll agree the Pro Junior doesn't strike me as particularly \"Fendery\". Anytime I've recorded the Pro Junior, live or in the studio, I've been surprised to hear it doesn't sound boxy at all in the mix, and actually sounds like a much more expensive amp - almost like a Matchless or something.\n\nThe newer Pro Jr's are supposedly Cathode Biased now and I'm not sure if they hold up in a mix as well as the old design did as such.\n\nIt’s not an issue for me. I can’t get mine above “4” in a bar gig scenario. And most places I can’t get it above “3” without getting asked to turn down. It’s a crazy loud little beast. No way can I get significant breakup out of it without pedals at bar gigs, and I’m using ‘buckers.\n\nI will note that I hated the stock speaker, which I believe was around 94db, and the replacement is around 98-99 db, which probably is responsible for a lot of that.\n\nAs an added bit of input-\n\nI own a ‘22 Pro Jr IV LTD. The tweed one that comes with a Jensen P10R. I hated that speaker. I mean really did not like it at all. I tried to make it work, but it’s just a totally awful speaker in that amp. If I were buying another one, I’d get the regular SE version with the standard eminence speaker.\n\nAs an added bit of input-\n\nI own a ‘22 Pro Jr IV LTD.

If I were buying another one, I’d get the regular SE version with the standard eminence speaker.\n\nWhat speaker did you put in your Pro Jr. ?\n\nI have both. My Blues J is a IV with Jenson speaker. My Pro J is a III and has a Ragin' Cajun speaker. I like my Gibson LP through the BJ with reverb. I like my Tele through my PJ with any/all the pedals I fancy at the time.\n\nI try to follow some of the jazz vids on Utubes and was surprised to find Sandra Sherman, who I like, uses a BJ. BJs have sophistication. They are just a better amp.\n\nBUT, PJ's have punch and grit. I love that they've only got 2 knobs, volume and tone. PJ is also noisier than the BJ, do I care? I should move it on, but I can't! Just love the PJ tone!\n\nDoug\n\nJeff Beck used a Pro Jr - that's good enough for me.\n\nProbably not one of the reissues though. Much different I am sure.\n\nFWIW, the Pro Jr. that I had was noisy. I put lower gain pre-amp tubes is to diminish the noise somewhat. I also put in a Mercury Magnetics output transformer and it open up the sound a lot. Better speaker than stock as well. It was a nice amp with a lot of kick. Sold it though. Didn't want the noise."
