Wells went on to success as a Chicago entertainer, had an early 1960s hit record \"Messin’ with the Kid,\" and was in the midst of an extended engagement at the Chicago nightclub Theresa’s when in 1965 he recorded one of the first Chicago blues albums, the popular Hoodoo Man Blues, accompanied by guitarist Buddy Guy.
