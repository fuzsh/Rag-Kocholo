Candidates who are being actively considered for positions may be required to present academic transcripts and professional references. Our Human Resources team will carefully evaluate applications and reach out to individuals selected for the interview process.\n\nOpportunities are available at World Bank Group headquarters in Washington, DC and across our offices around the world.\n\nIt is important to note that a JPA assignment does not guarantee continued employment at the World Bank Group. Following completion of the three-year JPA contract, candidates may apply for competitive term employment assignments with no cooling-off period."
