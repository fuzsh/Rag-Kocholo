        "text": "Take Me Home allows for the safe return home of anyone who may not be able to communicate vital information to law enforcement officers or first responders. This kind of assistance may be required if the person is unable to speak or properly identify themselves, or if the individual becomes disoriented or acts in a manner that could be misinterpreted by first responders. When an individual registers in the Take Me Home system, his/her record includes a current digital picture, physical description, demographic information, and caregiver contacts. This information is stored in a database that only dispatchers or officers in patrol cars can access. If a patrol officer encounters a person in the Take Me Home program, the officer can query the Take Me Home system by searching a name or physical description. Once the individual’s Take Me Home record has been located, the officer has the information to assist the person appropriately. The system also works in reverse; if a loved one is missing, his/her picture and description are immediately available. There is no charge for using the program. There does need to be a commitment by those using the program to keep information in the database current. Take Me Home is voluntary. Information is kept confidential and only accessed by RRPD Communications and RRPD officers. The program was initially developed by the Pensacola Police Department in Florida.\n\nTo participate in Take Me Home, fill out this form (English/Español)and sent it to takemehome@roundrocktexas.gov or to the Round Rock Police Department at 2701 N. Mays Street, Round Rock, TX 78665."
