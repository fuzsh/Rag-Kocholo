        "text": "UPDATE – We have reached the max number of spots for 2024 Summer Blue J program and are no longer accepting new applications at this time. We will start accepting new application for 2025 Summer Blue J program on March 1, 2025. Application received prior to this date will not be accepted and we will be filling spots on a first come, first serve basis.\n\nAll Blue J’s must be 16 by June 1st in order to volunteer for the summer. There are no exceptions to this age limit.\n\nSummer is approaching fast and I am so glad that you are considering volunteering at the Methodist Hospitals. Our new summer student volunteer program will start on June 10, 2024 and end on August 2, 2024 and consist of a rotation in different roles in our hospital.\n\nPlease note some important information you need to know –\n\nOrientation dates will be held in May 2024. You must attend orientation prior to volunteering. These will be the only dates offered for Blue J’s, so please select one that suits your schedule. Due to limited space, we ask that parents not attend.\n\nPlease bring all of these items with you to orientation –\n\nSigned contract agreeing to work a minimum of 32-hours from June 10, 2024 to August 2, 2024\n\nApplication must be filled out (online link)\n\nCompleted Background check 5-30\n\nImmunization records with proof of two MMR vaccinations, Varicella verification and Tdap vaccinations\n\nTwo reference letters from non-related adults who know your character\n\nParental TB_Consent form for testing\n\n$12 for membership dues and Polo shirt, additional shirts are $10 each\n\nOrientation days, times and location will be sent to you after you have completed the application using the link above.\n\nWe will provide TB testing to you free of charge and you may take care of this at your earliest convenience AFTER orientation. The process for testing is listed below –\n\nContact Employee Health to set up an appointment and bring a printed copy of your immunization records, and the parental consent must be signed by a parent or guardian if you are under 18. You will fill out your information card at this time.\n\nA nurse will administer the TB injection if you do not have documentation of any previous TB skin testing done within the last 3 months.\n\nYou must return two days later to have the test cleared or have to repeat the test. Employee Health will let Volunteer Services know you are cleared to begin.\n\nEmployee Health is located in the Plaza Building on 4499 Medical Drive, Suite 102. Their phone number is 210-575-9717 if you have any questions. Their hours are Monday through Friday, from 7am to 3:30pm.\n\nWe will be passing out a scheduling questionnaire at orientation please have an idea of days that you are available. Standard shifts are 8:30am-12:30pm and 12:30pm-4:30pm, Monday through Friday only. No weekends are available. You may also work all day if you choose. Please pick two shifts that work for you for now and we can add more as soon as we know how many volunteers are joining us.\n\nOur new summer student volunteer program is available at Methodist Hospital but we also have our standard summer program available at Methodist Hospital | Specialty and Transplant, Methodist Hospital | Texsan and Methodist Hospital | Metropolitan. Junior volunteers are not allowed to work in the Children’s Hospital and I apologize for that. FYI – we always seem to lack junior volunteers Mondays and Fridays, so if you would like to pick those days, that is great! We limited spots available for our new summer student program at Methodist Hospital so if we fill up, we may ask you to volunteer at another of our facilities above if your days are not flexible. Please know we will work with you as best as we can. Summer usually brings us about 100 extra volunteers so we have to have a balanced schedule.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email me at Frances.Gutierrez@MHSHealth.com. If signed up but you will not be able to volunteer this summer, please email me as soon as possible. I have quite a waiting list!\n\nThank you for your interest in the Methodist Hospital new summer student volunteer program. I hope that you will have a productive and exciting experience while you are here!\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrances Gutierrez\n\nDirector Volunteer Services"
