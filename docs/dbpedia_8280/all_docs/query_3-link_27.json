        "text": "Hey guys I wanted to get your opinion on which amp you like best and why. I tried the hot rod and I like it but have only been playing for two years and I have a ****ty amp so I don't really know, oh and what do you think is a reasonable price for a used one . Thanks a lot!\n\n- Jlm\n\nTwo decent amps, but in the end you have to decide what you need. Do you need the 40 watts (and 45 pounds)the HRD has to offer, or are the 15 watts of the Blues Jr. enough for now? Are you going to play at home mostly, jam out with some folks, etc. I've seen a Blues Jr. as low as $250, but I've also seen quite a few around $325-$400 used also.\n\nHad the HRD for the last 3 months. Good amp for clean. Not good for dirt. It was loud too. I traded it for a 95 Tweed Blues Jr three weeks ago and am wayyyyy happier! You can get a sweeter OD tube sound at lower volumes with the Blues Jr. The HRD is good if you need loud. I can hang with the other two guitars, drums and keys in my band just fine but we all mic the amps the balance through the PA and I use a plexi shield in front of my amp to stop the beaming.\n\nAlso try a few Blue Jr's as there are many dogs out there.\n\nYeah.....those are two pretty different amps. If you want bigger warmer cleans with more headroom, then definitely the HRDeluxe. If you want something that breaks up MUCH earlier and sounds just a little bit \"boxier\", then maybe the Blues Jr. However, I'll speak from my personal experience here and tell you that I've gone to the store to buy a Blues Jr TWICE now, and when I A/B those amps next to other makes/models/brands, I just can't bring myself to buy one. The last time, I brought home a Vox ac15 and think it sounds SOOOOO much better. I'd suggest you try one, for fun if nothing else.\n\nThere's no best between these 2, and better depends really on what kind of sound you are looking for. Around here, they go for similar prices used, from what I've seen - maybe the HRD starting with a higher ask. I would try to get one under $400, and not be ashamed to lowball in this economy. It's not like there aren't tons of them out there.\n\nAs others say, very different. 6L6 vsl EL84, over 2x wattage, just different. HRD has more of a Fender vibe, but it is loud. I played a BJr at practice for over a year, and for some things it was great, and others, left me thinking it was pretty limited. But, it really depends on what kind of sound you are looking for. It's certainly going to be an easier grab-n-go kind of amp, and will work *anywhere* if you can mic it. The HRD is always going to be a big sound, but give you some clean Fender chime I personally never heard from the BJr. (Get a Mesa DC 2/.22 if you want chime from a pair of EL84s, IMO.)\n\nTSims1 said:\n\nYeah.....those are two pretty different amps.

It never fails to make me smile when I play it.\n\nThat said, it's not a versatile amp. You get a limited range of great tones in a very light, portable package. It happens to fit very well into my band's roots rock genre, so I'm quite happy with it.\n\nI recently got a great deal on a Peavey Classic 2x12 with a 6L6 power amp section and circuits designed for harder rock, and between the Blues Junior and the 65-watt Peavey, I'm in amp heaven.\n\nGood luck.\n\nAlso: If I had the spare cash, I'd add a Vox AC15 to my collection in a heartbeat.\n\nI had a BJ and loved its tone,until the drummer turned up. I needed a clean tone for a lot of songs but the amp couldnt keep up. We were a band with hefty stage volume.\n\nSold BJ and bought the HRDlx. Also great tone. I'm in a new band where the BJ would have kept up with the drummer, but I've stuck with the HRDlx because I know I've always got the headroom and the tone is nice.\n\nI am going to put 6v6 tubes in soon. It takes the output down to 20-25 watts and will allow me to crank it a bit more to get into the optimum level\n\non the clean channel and still have clean headroom.\n\nIf you gig or jam get the 40 watts.\n\nzag1 said:\n\nVox AC15 is cool, but have you tried one to see if it'll suit your needs (and wants)? Once again you got a rack of choices there......AC15 with one or two 12\" speakers, etc.....I'm not gonna even touch on the AC15HW1 or 1X models.\n\nPlease do I would like to know more!!"
