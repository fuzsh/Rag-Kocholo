We maximize on course play, and don’t overwhelm the young golfers with too much instruction. Often, a group of three or four young golfers will play the course with one of our instructors, with the junior playing a “scramble” format to try and beat the instructor.\n\nWhat you’ll learn:\n\nBeginners are introduced to games designed to teach swing fundamentals in a fun way. As their confidence builds, they are later introduced to course play.\n\nHighlights:\n\nMore on-course experience than other junior golf instruction opportunities.\n\nPracticing full swing shots on our All Grass Driving Range.\n\nOur curriculum focuses on developing golf skills (full swing, short game, rules, and etiquette) while keeping the experience fun and engaging (games and activities).\n\nA fun, safe, and educational environment designed with your child’s well-being in mind.\n\nLow student-to-instructor ratio (approximately 6:1)\n\nHalf-Day Clinics:\n\n4 Days – $349\n\nFull-Day Clinics:\n\n4 Days – $499\n\nWeekly Jr. Rental Sets By Child’s Height – If your child does not have a set of clubs to use, don’t sweat it, as we have you covered. Save big by renting a set from us for the week instead of buying a set that they might grow out of in a years time. We do require that every student to have their own sets of clubs. If you don’t own a set of clubs please select the appropriate set to rent for the week. Clubs must be reserved at least 2 weeks in advance of your child’s clinic date to guarantee a set will be available for them. If you have a set of clubs that your child has grown out of contact us to see if we can purchase them from you.\n\n46″ ~ 52″ ($30/week)\n\n53″ ~ 59″ ($35/week)\n\n60″ ~ 65″ ($40/week)\n\n66″ & Up ($45/week)\n\nWeek 1 : June 10 – 13\n\nWeek 2 : June 17 – 20\n\nWeek 3 : June 24 – 27\n\nWeek 4 : NO CAMP\n\nWeek 5 : July 8 – 11\n\nWeek 6 : July 15 – 18\n\nWeek 7 : July 22 – 25\n\nWeek 8 : July 29 – August 1\n\nWeek 9 : August 5 – 8\n\nWeek 10 : August 12 – 15\n\nWeek 11 : August 19 – 22\n\nRegister for Camp"
