        "text": "Rogue Drums and Percussion left no musician behind, because its Junior Kicker 5-piece drum set was custom-made for the world’s young drummers. This drum set has a compact frame to appease smaller rockers but maintains Rogue’s great playability and sound that its customers have grown accustomed to. This is a one-stop-shop drum set and has everything you need to start playing right away. This package has everything you need to complete your setup, so you don’t have to waste any time shopping for every essential accessory, which can be tedious and overwhelming. Rogue carefully selected the best accessorizing gear that will truly enhance this cool, well-grounded mini drum set.\n\nStraight Out of the Box\n\nThis five-piece cool kit is all-inclusive, featuring drums with smaller dimensions that have been tested for playability and intonation and approved by professional drummers. Its drums have multi-ply, real-wood shells for more robust tones. The set includes an 18x14\" bass drum, 8x5\" and 10x5\" rack toms, 12x10\" floor tom, and a matching 12x5\" wooden snare drum. It also includes durable hardware and mounts that feature a slick, chrome finish, a hi-hat stand (with a full size pedal), an adjustable, double-braced, stand-alone boom cymbal stand, reliable snare drum stand, and well-built (full size) chain-driven bass drum pedal. The drum throne has a soft, padded cushion and is height adjustable. Rogue even contributed hi-hat and crash cymbals, drum sticks, a drum key and an easy-reading instruction manual. This is truly a one-stop-purchase encompassing everything you need to play.\n\nSmall Drums With a Big Sound\n\nEach drum is suited-up with Rogue’s tried-and-true tunable and replaceable drum heads. The cool Rogue logo sits atop each drum head for a fresh and clean look. The drums each have a distinctly round tone that compliments one another. The bass drum resonating blasts are deep with an articulated punch. The bass drum pedal has a reliable spring for comfort and confidence while rocking out. Drumming youngsters will feel safe and secure because the bass drum mallet connects with the bass drum batter head the same way, each time they strike. The bass drum pedal is snuggly clamped and ensures the bass drum pedal will stay put, no matter how fast and aggressively it is being played."
