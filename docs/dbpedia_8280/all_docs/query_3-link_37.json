        "text": "But the main thing is it just sounds....how do I put it....it sounds like a fart of an amp\n\nevery other amp but the Blues Junior.\n\nSo I'm getting a little vibe that you're not keen on the Blues Junior then Kiddo.. ha ha\n\nIts a good job you're the other side of the pond, and not at one of my gigs, playing through my old BJ.. I'd be constantly listening for.. @The-Kid shouting out.. \"jeez that guy sounds like a fart\"..\n\nAs an aside.. JJ Cale, Jack Pearson, and Robin Trower are but three (rather well known) guitarists who've used the 'hated' BJ. And Jack had the gaul to play a $90 Squire through it..\n\nRobin Trower used Blues Jr's in the studio... Here is a copy and paste off his website...\n\nhttp://www.trowerpower.com/\n\nTuesday 21st Feb. 06\n\nStarted work again on the new album today. Recording at No Recording Studios in Rayleigh, Essex.\n\nBegan the session using new signature Strat that Todd made for me in the custom shop at Fenders - and it's a beauty!\n\nPlaying through the OCD by Mike Fuller into two Blues Junior amps (Fender). Got some excellent stuff on \"If you'll take me in again\" and \"Freefall\". Can't wait to get Davey's vocal on them. Dave B great help in studio.\n\nNot very good sound quality unfortunately..\n\nI love my Blues Junior IV. Takes modulation pedals well. Low gain overdrives add a nice crunch and with either my MXR EVH 5150 OD or Friedman BE-OD it will breathe some fire. Best of all, my entire rig will fit in the hatch of my VW GTI!!! But I am realistic. I know that a small-box, single 12” combo won’t sound, feel or move air like a half stack. But for what I use it for, it works just fine...\n\nCale, Jack Pearson, and Robin Trower are but three (rather well known) guitarists who've used the 'hated' BJ.\n\nLike I said it depends on who is playing them.\n\nI could name all the people who prefer a 5e3 but my fingers would get sore:\n\nDon Felder\n\nNeil Young\n\nLarry Carlton\n\nMick Ralphs\n\nRonnie Montrose\n\nThe Edge\n\nGeorge Harrison\n\nBut I grow weary typing.\n\nUse what works for you.\n\nIts not hate...its preference.\n\nThat's what mine is. Nate has played through it. Ill let him tell you his take on it.\n\nIt’s an amazing amp. It blew me away. Literally the great thing was the amp brought out the best tones of your guitar. It really allows for the volume and tone controls to get into action.\n\nIt was a fantastic amp and for pretty much any of us it would be a number one amp\n\nFezz is dead on, it is not hate it is preference. I had a Blues Jr.. I never bonded with it. The tone for me was just a bit to bright. I was close to replacing the speaker and doing a bunch of the Bill mods and decided to sell it instead. I went through a few other amps until I found what I was after, I have a Fender Princeton Reverb now.\n\nNothing more than a preference, no hate.\n\nNothing more than a preference, no hate.\n\nYep. I can make one sound just fine if needed. Thankfully I don't need to.\n\nI have a friend who's in a pretty famous band. He did some showcases before this new incarnation of his band went on tour. He was trying out some Vox Valvetronix modelers.\n\nFirst show, he sounded great out front. After the show I told him he sounded great. He said F those things. 50 watt Marshall showed up the next night.\n\nPreference. Elliot Easton sounds great through anything. Because he's Elliot Easton.\n\nI built a 5e5 Pro years ago. It's basically a big Deluxe. Cathode biased...same PI. Preamp section is a bit different.\n\nInefficient 15 inch AlNiCo speakers is where I get off the bus. They don't hold together as well as a 12 unless it's an Altec or a D130. The D130 is BAF (bright AF) unless you have a paper dust cover.\n\nGimme a great 12...like a Red Fang or Celestion Gold. Something that sounds great and full clean and won't blow up when I beat the crap out of it.\n\nAny experience with the Eminence Neomag 15s? The Double-T 15 looks like it would be promising for a surf guitar rig or maybe even in a tweed pro type circuit.\n\nCertainly there are amps that are of higher quality than others and I find the more skilled somebody is the less of a threshold they generally have for underperforming equipment.\n\nThat being said, tons of amazing folks use blues jrs and blues devilles and stuff like that when they do fly away gigs.\n\nLarry Carlton still sounds amazing when he does a fly away gig to Spain and uses whatever Fender DeVille that was supplied to him and he can make it sound good. Is that his preferred amp? No, it’s not. Can he use it when the situation calls for it and sound great, yes he can.\n\nYou gotta remember, that’s Larry’s job. To go play songs for people and sound good, even if the gear he uses isn’t as inspiring to him as his favorite Tweed Deluxe or Dumble amp.\n\nMuch of getting good tone out of things is knowing what the knobs, buttons and dials are doing. And yes, there are tons of variations of quality when it comes to amps.\n\nThis notion that no amp is better than another because the player matters is nonsense. Former students of mine would be hammered for such illogic.\n\nYou are on my ignore list because most of what I've seen you post (in my opinion) is nonsense. But I'll take you off to respond.\n\nThe player matters because of the players ability to make music.\n\nA Crappy player...playing a 59 Les Paul through a 59 Bassman will not make better music than a gifted player playing a First Act through a Gorilla amp. And it's about making music.\n\nBack you go. ¡Adios!"
