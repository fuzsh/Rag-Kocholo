He opened with a victory in the first match of the event, partnering with Jason Day to defeat Hunter Mahan and Brandt Snedeker, 1-up, in Four-ball.\n\nBut DeLaet’s indelible moment at the Presidents Cup came on Saturday morning, when he holed a bunker shot at the 18th hole for birdie to claim a 2-up victory against Jordan Spieth and Steve Stricker. The next day, DeLaet defeated Spieth in Singles, 1-up.\n\nThree years later, DeLaet represented Canada again, this time in golf’s return to the Olympics at the 2016 Games in Rio.\n\nOff the course, DeLaet and his wife, Ruby, started the Graham and Ruby DeLaet Foundation to provide support for children and junior golfers in his home province of Saskatchewan. During his own junior golf days, DeLaet played in the 1999 AJGA Lucent Western Canadian Jr.\n\n“It was a total honor to get the call, and I was honestly taken aback at the opportunity, but it’s going to be a lot of fun to see these kids make memories for a lifetime in a city as special as Montréal,” DeLaet said. “A lot of these kids on both teams will end up playing on the PGA TOUR at some point in time, so I’m looking forward to getting them together to have fun and hopefully play their best golf.”\n\nCharley Hoffman\n\nHoffman, a Rancho Santa Fe, California native, has competed on the PGA TOUR since 2006 and owns four career victories and nine runner-up finishes. Known for his consistency and longevity, Hoffman advanced to the FedExCup Playoffs in 15 consecutive seasons from 2007-2021.\n\nIn 2017, Hoffman qualified for the United States Team at the Presidents Cup, where he compiled a 1-2-0 record in his debut at Liberty National Golf Club, highlighted by a dominant 6-and-5 victory in Four-ball over Charl Schwartzel and Anirban Lahiri.\n\nAs a junior golfer, Hoffman competed in 13 AJGA events, including a victory at the 1994 PING Phoenix Junior Championship. He also went on to win the California high school state championship in 1994 and 1995, becoming the first two-time winner at the time.\n\n“My first reaction was complete honor that I was even considered,” Hoffman said. “The relationships that are formed through these AJGA team events are special, and to represent your country on top of that is second to none. This experience will no doubt prepare them for future Presidents Cups, but at the end of the day my job is to make sure they have fun and enjoy the experience.”"
