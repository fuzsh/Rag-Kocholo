Displays/Presentations points can only be earned at one event at each fair.\n\nJuniors must be a member of the ABCA at time of show or presentation/display to accumulate points.\n\nPoints are accumulated beginning on the day after the National Show and must be turned into ABCA Office before next years National Show.\n\nTo receive points the junior exhibitor must submit verification in the form of printed show results signed by the superintendent from EACH show. These results MUST be from the show office or newspaper article with all class results listed. The exception to this rule is the sanctioned shows as the ABCA will have class placings in the office. However, the class placings still need to be listed in year end list. Displays/Presentations at sanctioned shows still need to have signed verification. These rules will be strictly enforced.\n\nJuniors may show any number of head at each show but points will only accumulate for 4 head"
