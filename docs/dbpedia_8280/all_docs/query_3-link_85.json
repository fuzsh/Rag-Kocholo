        "text": "Students have fun while learning, writing, and exchanging chord-style songs associated with the tradition of American camping. These tunes are best enjoyed while hanging out on a starry summer night with friends around a warm campfire. All levels of ability are welcome. Students should have basic familiarity with tuning their own guitar and reading chord diagrams. Blue Lake does not provide instruments; campers must bring their own guitar.\n\nStudents selecting the New Instrument minor receive group and individual instruction on several instruments within a musical instrument family. Students work with all listed instruments during camp and present a small demonstration for each other at the end of the session. Select one of the following instrument areas on your application:\n\nWoodwind (flute, clarinet, and alto saxophone)\n\nBrass (trumpet, horn, trombone)\n\nStrings (violin and cello)\n\nPercussion (mallets, snare, and accessories)\n\nSupport for these classes is provided by Meyer Music Company.

Vocalists in theater productions act through song, and the song becomes an extension of the scene. Learn strategies for a variety of styles from tender love songs to triumphant belts while shaping phrases, using expression, and keeping in character.
