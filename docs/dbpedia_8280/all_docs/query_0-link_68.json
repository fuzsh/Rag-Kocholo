        "text": "MGA Rewards Program Terms and Conditions\n\nEffective Date: April 29, 2023\n\nWelcome to the MGA Rewards program (the \"Program\"), operated by MGA Entertainment, Inc. (\"MGA\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\"). The following terms and conditions (the \"Terms\") govern your participation in the Program. By participating in the Program, you agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as MGA’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. These Terms are meant to supplement and not change our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not participate in the Program.\n\nEligibility\n\nThe Program is open to individuals who are legal residents of the United States and at least 18 years of age or older. Employees of MGA and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and their respective family members are not eligible to participate in the Program.\n\nEnrollment\n\nTo enroll in the Program, visit our website at www.lolsurprise.com/rewards and click “Join Now”. You will need to provide your full name, email address, phone number, and create a password to register for the Program. Please make sure that the information you provide is accurate and up to date. By creating an account on our site, you consent to join MGA Rewards and receive marketing emails about the program as well as other offers and discounts available to members and/or customers. You may unsubscribe from emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe button at the bottom of any email.\n\nEarning Rewards\n\nYou can earn rewards in the Program by making purchases on our website or by participating in other activities that we may offer from time to time, such as taking surveys or referring friends. You will earn two points for every dollar you spend on eligible purchases, excluding taxes and shipping charges, and/or as stated in connection with your participation in other activities. Purchases made using rewards points are not eligible for earning rewards.\n\nRedeeming Rewards\n\nYou may redeem your rewards in the form of discounts on future purchases on our website, once your rewards credit balance reaches $5, or multiples of $5. Rewards are promotional and may not be redeemed for cash, gift cards, or any other products or services. Rewards are non-transferable and may only be used by the account holder.\n\nRewards Expiration\n\nRewards expire one year from the date they were earned. If a reward has not been redeemed within one year, it will expire and will no longer be available for use.\n\nModification and Termination\n\nMGA reserves the right to modify, add or delete portions of these Terms at any time, with or without notice, in our sole discretion. You are responsible for periodically checking for changes and/or updates to the Terms. Your continued participation in the Program after any changes to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.\n\nIf MGA terminates the Program, any unused points and/or Rewards will expire and be void when the Program is terminated. Upon termination of your account, all points and/or Rewards that you have accumulated will immediately expire.\n\nLimitation of Liability\n\nMGA shall not be liable for any damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with your participation in the Program, including direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Because some states do not permit the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, in such jurisdictions, liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by such state law.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThese Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute between the parties shall be resolved by the appropriate courts located in Los Angeles, California.\n\nContact Us"
