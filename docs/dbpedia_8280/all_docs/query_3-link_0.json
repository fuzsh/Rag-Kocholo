He lived in Blue Town, which was named after Captain Blue, serving as its protector. Junior eagerly awaited for Captain Blue to return and give him his own V-Watch.\n\nInvolvement[]\n\nHe was Captain Blue's successor until Joe comes along, and because Joe is the one who receives Blue's V-Watch, he is very jealous of Joe. Despite his jealousy, Junior decides to be Joe's sidekick and offered his knowledge of Movieland as a helping hand.\n\nJunior is offered a V-Watch but refuses, so Blue just gave Junior a small case that contains two V-Yo-Yos that allow him to transform. Captain Blue Jr. appeared in a game for the very first time in Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble. He uses many yo-yo based attacks. Appropriately, his transformation phrase is \"Henshin a Yo-Yo Ball Baby!\".\n\nStrategy[]\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"Henshin a Yo-Yo Baby!\"\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nJunior is the youngest hero in the franchise to be able to transform.\n\nSee also[]\n\nViewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble\n\nViewtiful Joe (anime)\n\n[]"
