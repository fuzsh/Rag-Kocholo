Taking diabetes pills called thiazolidinediones (thIE-uh-zOH-li-dEEn-dIE-OHns), or \"TZDs,\" with insulin lispro products may cause heart failure in some people. This includes people who do not have any heart problems. If you have heart failure, it may get worse if you take TZDs with these insulin lispro products. Tell your doctor if you have any new symptoms of heart failure, or if they get worse. Some symptoms of heart failure include: shortness of breath, swelling of ankles and feet, and sudden weight gain. Your doctor may need to change or stop treatment with TZDs and your insulin lispro product.\n\nHigh blood sugar and ketoacidosis. You can have these serious problems when your insulin pump or infusion set stops working. They can also happen if your insulin is no longer effective. For these reasons, always keep extra insulin injection supplies with you.\n\nHow to take\n\nRead the Instructions for Use that come with your Humalog or Insulin Lispro Injection.

Make sure you or your caregiver:\n\nCheck the insulin label before each injection. This will help you make sure that you are taking the correct insulin.\n\nUse a new needle for each injection. You can get a serious infection or the wrong dose of insulin if you re-use needles.\n\nChange (rotate) where you inject your insulin with each dose. This can reduce your chance of getting pits, lumps, or thickened skin where you inject your insulin. Do not inject your insulin into the exact same spot or where the skin has pits or lumps. Avoid injecting into thickened, tender, bruised, scaly, hard, scarred, or damaged skin.\n\nWhen you are ready to inject\n\nInject Humalog or Insulin Lispro Injection, under your skin within 15 minutes before or right after you eat a meal.\n\nStaying safe while taking your insulin lispro product\n\nTo stay safe while taking your insulin, be sure to never inject Humalog U-200 in your vein, muscle, or with an insulin pump.
