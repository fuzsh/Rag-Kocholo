        "text": "Academic Scholarships\n\nThe University offers academic scholarships based on a detailed and comprehensive review of your application for admission. There is no minimum GPA or test score required for consideration, nor is there any GPA or test score that guarantees a scholarship offer. Criteria include academic achievement, leadership qualities, commitment to service and potential for success at the University. Scholarships range in value from $3,000 all the way up to full cost of attendance. If you are selected for an Academic Scholarship, you will see your scholarship offer in your MyCarolina portal. Academic Scholarship offers are extended at the same time as admission to Carolina, as are some University Scholarship offers.\n\nOfficial Scholarship Names\n\nIf you are selected for an academic scholarship, you’ll be notified that you are receiving a scholarship from Carolina and the scholarship value. Most scholarships are given as a general “Academic Scholarship” placeholder and the official name of your academic scholarship offer will be updated by late May in your ConnectCarolina Student Center (this will be combined with other aid you may be receiving).\n\nTuition Provision\n\nNon-resident students (self-disclosed or as determined by RDS), who receive a full scholarship (tuition, fees, housing, and meals), are charged for tuition at the NC resident rate, beginning their first fall semester. This means the offered value of your scholarship is based on the resident rate instead of the non-resident rate. Please note that if you take Summer School at Carolina before you first fall semester, this provision does not apply. Instead, you will be charged the full, non-student rate.\n\nNC System Policy\n\nScholarships with Financial Need\n\nSome Academic Scholarships take financial need into consideration. If you wish to be considered for scholarships with financial need, be sure to submit your FAFSA application no later than January 1.\n\nScholarships with financial need, are combined with other need-based aid you receive, you will see the total aid combination in your ConnectCarolina Student Center.\n\nScholarships with Supplemental Applications/Requirements\n\nThere are three UNC scholarships that have supplemental requirements in addition to completing the admissions application. Please reference the links for more information. Please contact the individual departments hosting the scholarships for more information:\n\nKenan Music Scholars Program\n\nThomas Wolfe Scholarship for Creative Writing\n\nChancellors Science Scholars Scholarship\n\nWe are also pleased to host private scholarship foundations. These scholarships may require supplemental applications or interviews. You can find more information using the links below. Please contact those programs directly for further information:\n\nMorehead-Cain\n\nRobertson"
