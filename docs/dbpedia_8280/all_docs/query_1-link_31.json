        "text": "One of the most popular sites at the Academy is the Eisenhower Golf Club. A modern scenic facility with two 18-hole courses: the championship Blue, and the stunning Silver.\n\nReservations for tee times are recommended, especially during the busy summer season.

Eisenhower Golf Club is also the home course for the Air Force Academy's intercollegiate golf team which plays host to a Division 1 tournament each September.\n\nOnly DoD ID card holders can use the golf course. DoD card holders can bring guests but only card holders can schedule a tee time. Guests cannot schedule a tee time.\n\nThe modern clubhouse features The Grill which serves up excellent breakfast and lunch fare, the Eisenhower Room, the Pro Shop and locker rooms. Golf clubs, power and hand carts are available to rent from the Pro Shop.\n\nPGA names the Eisenhower Golf Club Military Golf at its Finest: \"The Blue Course at Eisenhower Golf Club opened in 1959, and is the only original Robert Trent Jones Sr. layout in the state of Colorado and was named the top Department of Defense golf course by Travel + Leisure. It also became the first military golf course to host a USGA national championship when it welcomed 156 of the world’s top female golfers under the age of 19 for the U.S. Girls’ Junior this past summer.\" Read the full article here.\n\nTHE BLUE COURSE\n\nPreviously named the top golf course in the Department of Defense by Travel and Leisure Golf magazine. The Robert Trent Jones Sr. designed Blue Course stretches to almost 7,500 yards and offers wide fairways and challenging greens, there are 5 sets of tees to accommodate players of all skill levels.\n\nTHE SILVER COURSE\n\nA demanding course with a premium placed on accuracy rather than length. The course measures 6,519 yards from the championship tees and 5,559 from the forward tees. In addition to open play, a full tournament schedule is slated for spring, summer and fall months. Both courses offer stunning views of the Rocky Mountains."
