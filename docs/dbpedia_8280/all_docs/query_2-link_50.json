        "text": "Location\n\nAllen Noble Hall of Fame\n\n1910 University Dr.\n\nBoise, ID 83725-1020\n\n208-426-3556\n\nCelebrating over 30 years, THE BLUE, the common nickname of Lyle Smith field, can be viewed by entering The Allen Noble Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame is not only home to the history of Boise State’s successful athletes and teams, it is the only public entrance to view the home of Boise State football and the famous blue turf.*\n\nBoise State Football has a long history of success starting with the Junior College days and the National Championship team of 1958, coached by the father of Bronco Football, Lyle Smith. Now named Lyle Smith Field in Albertsons Stadium, the turf field was actually the typical, non-interesting green before getting its proud moniker after the 1985 season. Installed in the summer of 1986, THE BLUE was the idea of Athletic Director Gene Bleymaeir and was the first non-green, artificial football field in the country. What outsiders initially considered a gimmick, calling it “Smurf Turf’ after the popular, amiable and blue cartoon characters, THE BLUE soon became nationally associated with Boise State as a symbol for the football program’s blue-collar work ethic. Opponents don’t find it so friendly either. With the closing of the 2018 season, Boise State football holds a home record of 182-39 (14 Conference Championships) since THE BLUE was installed prior to the 1986 season. The program has lost only nine times on its home field since the start of the 1999 season.\n\nSee The Blue\n\nYou can view the turf by entering through the Allen Noble Hall of Fame in Southwest corner of Albertsons Stadium. Visit THE BLUE, one of the most visited sites in Idaho, and take a photo from the view of our Hall of Fame patio, one of the most popular selfie spots in the state, while learning more about the history of Boise State Athletics. You can see THE BLUE Monday through Friday from 10 am – 4 pm.*\n\nMetered Parking available in the west lot in front of the Bronco Shop. For questions or more information on availability, please contact the Hall of Fame at (208) 426-3556 or email baa@boisestate.edu.\n\nClosed\n\nWeekends, Holidays, and Special Events*"
