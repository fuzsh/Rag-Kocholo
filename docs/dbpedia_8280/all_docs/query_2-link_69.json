        "text": "Speed and power made switch-hitting outfielder Junior Félix a top prospect, but his career was derailed by defensive deficiencies, injuries, and concerns about his real age. Félix was believed to be just 21 when he hit the first pitch that he faced in the majors for a home run in 1989. By 1994, however, when he played his final game at the top level, many suspected that he was already in his mid-30s.\n\nJunior Francisco Félix Sánchez was born in the in the Laguna Salada municipality of the Dominican Republic, about 15 miles south of the Atlantic coast and 40 miles from the country’s western border with Haiti. His birth date was recorded as October 3, 1967.\n\nMoneno Félix and Gladys Sánchez were Junior’s parents, according to New York’s Impacto newspaper, which said he had a brother, Génesis, and a sister, Iris Margarita.1 Another paper said Junior was the youngest of seven.2 (Félix’s personal Facebook page includes a childhood photograph with his parents and five sisters.3 The same social media platform hosts an account belonging to Genis Feliz (b. 1955), who lists his parents’ names as Moneno Féliz and Gladys Estervina Sánchez.4)\n\nShortly after Junior was born, his father left the home, so he was raised by his mother while his siblings lived in other places. “He won’t say why,” reported the Miami Herald.5 Little is known about the family except that they were poor.\n\nBy the time Junior entered professional baseball, he was living about 150 miles southeast of Laguna Salada in Yamasá, an hour’s drive north of Santo Domingo.6 Toronto Blue Jays scout Epy Guerrero discovered him in 1983. “I went to the Dominican national track-and-field competition,” Guerrero described.7 “He was running long and he was running short, and he was winning everything. I’d never seen a faster kid. I had to ask him if he played ball, and he said he did when he was a little kid. He said he wasn’t sure about the rules.”8\n\nFélix confirmed that occasional street games – mostly on Sundays – were the extent of his childhood baseball experience.9 But he insisted that Guerrero’s account was embellished. “I was never in an organized track meet in my life,” Félix said in 1993. “I was just running with two other guys and Epy just happened to see me. He said I was fast and he told me to try playing baseball. So I did.”10\n\n“[Félix] didn’t have a penny, so he lived in my baseball complex for two years. The Jays gave us money to pay for things for him,” Guerrero explained.11 “We taught him to be a switch-hitter. He showed immediate power for a kid who’s not very big.”12\n\nFélix, listed at 6-feet and 170 pounds, signed with Toronto for $3,000 on September 15, 1985. Until he could give the money to his mother, Félix asked the neighborhood man who had brought him to Guerrero to hold it. “I never get it back,” Félix said in 1991. Convinced that involving the police would accomplish nothing, he recalled, “I just let it go. But I told him, if I ever see him and [if] I’m out of baseball after two years, I will go for [after] him.”13\n\nIn 1986, Félix made his professional debut in the rookie-level Pioneer League. “I never even picked up a baseball glove until 1986,” he said later. “I didn’t even own a real pair of shoes until Epy gave me a pair.”14 Félix batted .285 with a league-leading 37 stolen bases in 67 games for the Medicine Hat (Alberta, Canada) Blue Jays.\n\nFélix advanced to Class A in 1987 and tied for the South Atlantic League lead with nine triples. He batted .290 with 64 steals in 124 games to help the Myrtle Beach (South Carolina) Blue Jays win the championship. Myrtle Beach coach Leroy Stanton acknowledged Félix’s propensity to get poor jumps on the basepaths and in the outfield, but noted, “He’s so fast that he’s been outrunning his mistakes.”15\n\nMeanwhile, the big-league Blue Jays spent most of the season in first place, led by two Dominican stars. American League MVP George Bell bopped 47 homers, and Gold Glove shortstop Tony Fernández batted .322. That summer, though, Guerrero predicted, “Junior Félix will be the best player to ever come out of the Dominican… He has unlimited talent. Just wait and see.”16\n\nFélix made his Dominican League debut that winter with the Santo Domingo-based Leones del Escogido. He earned Rookie of the Year honors by hitting .322 in 47 games. In the circuit’s All-Star Game, he went 4-for-4.17 After winning the championship, Escogido triumphed in the Caribbean Series for the first time in franchise history.18\n\nDespite batting just .253 in 1988, Félix stole 40 bases in his 93 games with the Knoxville (Tennessee) Blue Jays and was selected for the Double-A Southern League All-Star Game. When Félix arrived two hours late for Knoxville’s first game of the second half, however, he was sent home to the Dominican Republic for insubordination. “It was an accumulation of things, nothing real serious,” explained Blue Jays vice president Bobby Mattick. “We think we did it for his own good.”19\n\nThat fall, Toronto added Félix to its 40-man roster. Gord Ash, the club’s administrator of player personnel, remarked, “We’ll give him a second chance, but I’m not saying we’re prepared to give him a third chance.”20 After Knoxville catcher Matt Stark was claimed by the Chicago White Sox in the minor-league draft, he complained, “They [the Blue Jays] protect a guy like Junior Félix, who has the worst attitude in the world. He missed bus rides, was late for games, talked back to coaches.”21\n\nDuring the 1988-89 Dominican League winter season, Félix batted .281 with five homers and 10 steals in 57 games. Escogido repeated as champions.\n\nIn early 1989, Guerrero reflected on Félix’s suspension. “It was the best thing that could have happened to him. He’s a completely different guy now. He’s matured a lot… I fully expect that he will be the centre fielder this year.”22\n\nThe Blue Jays had another idea. In a National Basketball Association trade just before spring training, former Blue Jay Danny Ainge (a .220 hitter from 1979-1981) went from the contending Boston Celtics to the struggling Sacramento Kings. Toronto GM Pat Gillick called Ainge, suggesting that he quit basketball and return to the Blue Jays. “They always felt like I would be a great defensive centre fielder, even when they signed me as a shortstop they kind of felt that was my future position,” Ainge said in 1995. “He felt they had a good young outfielder in Junior Félix but that he didn’t have any glove. So the idea was that I would have come into games in late innings, along with [closer Tom] Henke.”23\n\nAinge elected to stick with hoops, and Félix opened the season in the Triple-A International League by homering in his first at-bat for the Syracuse (New York) Chiefs.24 Although he played only 21 games for Syracuse, Félix was named the circuit’s most exciting player and best baserunner.25 On April 30, Toronto traded Jesse Barfield to the New York Yankees. Three nights later, Félix made his big-league debut at Exhibition Stadium by playing the final inning of a Blue Jays victory in right field.\n\nOn May 4, Félix started at designated hitter, batting ninth. Leading off the bottom of the third inning, he took the California Angels’ Kirk McCaskill deep to right-center field, becoming just the 13th player in history to homer on the first pitch he faced in the majors.26\n\nIn Boston on June 2, Félix hit the first inside-the-park grand slam by a visiting player at Fenway Park.27 Despite minor injuries to both ankles, he circled the bases in just 14.9 seconds. “In the Dominican one time, they got me at 13.7,” he said.28 Two days later, Félix smacked a game-winning, two-run homer in the 12th inning.29 Overall, he collected 11 RBIs during Toronto’s three-game sweep, capping an American League Player of the Week performance despite being benched once for disciplinary reasons.30\n\nBlue Jays manager Cito Gaston kept him out of the lineup again after Félix ran through a coach’s stop sign on June 6 trying (unsuccessfully) to score from first base on a single. On June 10, the Toronto Star’s Bob Duff wrote, “Junior Félix is such a miserable person, even George Bell hates him.”31 (Bell had feuded with former Blue Jays’ skipper Jimy Williams the previous year and had a reputation for being difficult with reporters.)\n\nBut Félix’s combination of speed and power was impossible to ignore. His four-hit performance against the Tigers on June 11 featured a home run and two infield singles. In June, his 26 RBIs led all major leaguers.32 “If he’s Junior Félix, I’d like to see Senior Félix,” joked Orioles scout Ed Farmer.33\n\nBlue Jays pitcher Mike Flanagan observed, “[Félix]’s a very dangerous player. He plays the game with reckless abandon, full speed ahead. It’s hard to fault that.”34 Through July 30, Félix had led off 71 of Toronto’s last 74 games and was batting .283 with his unusual open batting stance. That afternoon, though, he ran into the wall at Yankee Stadium while pursuing a double and separated his left shoulder.35\n\nFélix started fewer than half of Toronto’s remaining contests and batted just .183 after returning. “I tried to come back too quickly,” he said the following spring.36 “I was worried about someone maybe taking my job.”37\n\nIn 110 games – mostly playing right field – Félix slashed .258/.315/.395, with eight triples, nine homers and 18 steals. The Blue Jays, in sixth place with a 9-17 record when he joined the team, then went 80-56 – trailing only the Oakland Athletics (84-55).38 “He came in and really gave us a lift,” said Gaston.39 On the season’s final weekend, Toronto edged the Baltimore Orioles to win the AL East. Félix started three ALCS contests against Oakland and went 3-for-11 (.273), but the Blue Jays fell in five games.\n\nNext, Félix helped Escogido claim a third straight Dominican League title. He hit .412 (21-for-51) in 16 regular season contests, and .294 in 23 playoff games. For the second time in three years, Escogido also won the Caribbean Series.\n\nWith the Blue Jays in 1990, Félix produced a .284/.359/.488 slash line prior to the All-Star break, with 11 homers and 11 steals. But he tore a right calf muscle in the first game of the second half. After it hemorrhaged overnight, surgery was required to relieve the pressure, and he missed four weeks.40 He wasn’t the same player when he returned, batting .227 with diminished power and speed. Toronto finished two games behind Boston.\n\nFélix exasperated his teammates by repeating correctable mistakes like overthrowing the cutoff man and not hustling after balls. “All you can do is keep talking to him,” said Gaston. “You can’t take him in a room and beat him up.”41 Félix, however, had reportedly tried to punch Bell in the locker room that summer after the latter accused him of being “very stupid for such an old man” in Spanish.42 The barb made more sense that fall when Toronto’s Globe and Mail published comments from Dominican sportswriter Roosevelt Comarazamy. “People who know Félix from his neighborhood say that he is a lot older than he says he is,” remarked Comarazamy. “Félix was a weightlifter in men’s competitions here a few years before he signed with the Jays. Well, you can’t be a 14-year-old kid in those competitions. He had to be a lot older at the time.”43\n\nThe same article confirmed that Félix – who had ostensibly turned 23 on October 3 – was on Toronto’s trading block. “He needs to be more dedicated,” said Gaston. “He has to want to be better. You have to have that inside of you.”44 On December 2, Félix, infielder Luis Sojo, and a player to be named later (catcher Ken Rivers) were traded to the Angels for center fielder Devon White, and pitchers Willie Fraser and Marcus Moore.\n\nThat offseason, Félix married Paula Treadway, a Myrtle Beach native whom he had met in the minors.45 Félix also helped Escogido reach another Dominican League finals, but they were dethroned by the Tigres del Licey.\n\nDuring spring training in 1991, veteran Angels outfielders Dave Winfield and Dave Parker sought out Félix to work with him.46 “I don’t like it here. I love the people here,” Félix told the Los Angeles Times.47 California made Félix the full-time center fielder, but he batted just .183 in his first 24 games. Nevertheless, Angels manager Doug Rader insisted, “Félix probably has the God-given ability to hit third.”48\n\nFélix heated up at bat. But on June 1 he strained a muscle in the same calf on which he’d had surgery the previous year. Following a stint on the 15-day disabled list, he aggravated the injury in his third game back and missed more than two months.49 While Félix was sidelined, he was fined by the Angels’ kangaroo court for asking the name of a pitcher (Floyd Bannister) who had been with California all season. When Félix protested that he didn’t know the name of reliever Mike Fetters either, he was fined again.50 Although Félix raised his batting average to .283 with a strong finish, he appeared in only 66 games. “Maybe he didn’t care too much to come back,” teammate Luis Polonia said later. “You have to push yourself to come back. I know he didn’t.”51\n\nEscogido claimed its fourth Dominican League title in five years in 1991-92. Although Félix hit just .215 in 19 regular-season games, he batted .397 in 15 round-robin playoff contests and .538 (7-for-13) in the finals.\n\nBack in the United States, though, Felix still had his skeptics. During spring training 1992, Angels vice president Whitey Herzog said of Félix, “He’s a dog, always has been. They say he’s got talent, but a lot of players have talent.”52 Félix worked on his defense with outfield instructor Sam Suplizio and staved off a challenge from rookie Chad Curtis to retain the center field position. “Last year [Félix] learned a lesson,” Polonia observed. “He understands that if he doesn’t work, he could lose his job… And he’s listening to people for the first time.”53\n\nBefore April was over Rader’s successor, Buck Rodgers, said that Félix’s bat, glove, and speed had already keyed California victories. “Junior Félix has been a joy,” Rodgers said. “Junior Félix is turning into a good, good player. We’re seeing some of his overall talent, complete talent.”54\n\nOn May 21, one of the Angels’ team buses flipped over on the New Jersey Turnpike. Thirteen members of the traveling party were injured, including Rodgers, who missed more than three months. Félix emerged with a sore knee and back but kept playing.55 Five nights later, however, he caught his spikes while backpedaling after a ball hit over his head.56 Félix strained his left groin and wound up on the 15-day disabled list. At the time, he was batting .287 with a team-high 31 RBIs.57\n\nDespite Félix’s improvement, shortly after he returned to action, the Los Angeles Times reported that he had nearly been traded to the Red Sox for 36-year-old designated hitter Jack Clark. The same paper noted that Félix had also been offered to the Cubs for center fielder Jerome Walton, but Chicago’s GM wasn’t interested.58 In July, Herzog told a group of Angels boosters that the club couldn’t win a pennant with Félix in center field.59\n\nCalifornia’s interim manager, John Wathan, fined Félix multiple times for failing to slide, and said he was tempted to bench him following another baserunning gaffe.60 That winter Rodgers, who reclaimed the managerial reins on August 28, described how Félix could frustrate teammates. “He was making mistakes that you would expect from a youngster, not from a guy who was over 30… We always suspected that he was 30-plus.”61\n\nFélix insisted that his graying hair was hereditary. Although he appeared in a career-high 139 games during his “age 24” season and led the fifth-place Angels with 72 RBIs, his batting average dropped to .246, and he struck out 128 times while producing only nine homers and eight steals. Nevertheless, as the fall expansion draft to stock the rosters of two franchises approached, Rodgers said California’s 15-player protected list would include Félix if the decision were his to make.62 But the Angels brass disagreed. On November 17, 1992, the Florida Marlins selected Félix in the third round with the 60th overall pick.\n\nFélix agreed to a one-year, $1.25 million contract and bought his mother a new seven-bedroom home in the Dominican Republic.63 When Miami Herald writer Dan Le Batard contacted her, “She said, in a mysterious voice, that she wasn’t really sure how old her son was.”64 Marlins GM Dave Dombrowski said, “We’re aware that Junior probably is older than the records say. But it’s not a big ordeal for us… He’s our right fielder.”65\n\nFor the first time in six years, Félix skipped winter ball, though he sponsored four youth teams in his native country.66 He spent the bulk of his offseason in South Carolina, where his wife gave birth to their first child, Junior Félix Jr. Upon joining the Marlins, he reiterated that his listed age was correct – “until someone can prove that I’m not 25” – but said the team’s media guide was wrong to report that he had one son. “I have three – with three different women,” he clarified.67\n\nRookie Scott Pose had a good spring training and won the starting job in center for Florida. On April 5, 1993, Félix started in right field and batted third when the Marlins made their National League debut, against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Joe Robbie Stadium. He lost the first ball hit his way in the sun and was charged with an error, but he recorded an outfield assist on the same play.68 Félix went 1-for-4, and Florida won, 6-3.\n\nFélix hit the first grand slam in Marlins’ history on April 25, off the Rockies’ Scott Aldred at Mile High Stadium with 71,192 in attendance.69 Félix told the Globe and Mail he was more relaxed than ever. “But I’m still learning,” he said. “I have a long way to go before I’m an established player.”70\n\nIn the eighth inning of a tie game against the Cubs on May 21, Félix dropped a fly ball that he lost in the lights. He heard about it from Marlins’ fans and had a beer thrown at him, but no runs scored. In the bottom of the frame, he clobbered a high fastball on an 0-2 count for what proved to be a game-winning homer. “They were booing him like crazy. Then he gets a standing ovation. That’s what the game is all about,” said Florida manager Rene Lachemann.71\n\nBut when Félix earned another standing ovation six night later, it came from the opposing fans in Pittsburgh. He had misplayed three balls, leading to six runs – including an inside-the-park homer by slow-footed catcher Tom Prince. (The previous evening, Pittsburgh had tallied another inside-the-park homer when Marlins right fielder Geronimo Berroa allowed an in-between hop to skip past him.) “Right field for us was like the Bermuda Triangle in this series,” said Lachemann. “The problem is you have to catch the ball to play right field.”72\n\nMarlins coach Vada Pinson, a former Gold Glove outfielder, described hitting balls to rookie center fielder Chuck Carr (who’d claimed that job in mid-April) before one game when Félix approached and said he needed the help more. “When I made eye contact with him, I saw he was sincere. It hurt me,” Pinson said.73\n\nThe Marlins sent Félix down to the Edmonton (Alberta, Canada) Trappers for a defensive refresher in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, where he played center field. “Playing in center field was a little bit of a joke because center field and right field are completely different,” he said upon returning to the majors two weeks later. Lachemann defended Félix’s effort and compared him to a former teammate. “He`s a lot like George Hendrick… George often looked like he wasn`t giving 100 percent, but he drove in 100 runs, had a great arm and was a good outfielder.”74\n\nFélix’s return to the Marlins, though, lasted only 13 games. In 57 overall appearances for Florida, he batted .238 with a dismal .940 fielding percentage. Shortly before Félix was designated for assignment on June 25, he responded to a question about which teammates had been the most supportive by saying, “Friends? I don’t have any.” The Orlando Sentinel‘s Jorge Milian wrote, “In his short stay with the Marlins, Félix lived up to his reputation as a moody loner.”75\n\nNo other major-league team claimed Félix on waivers.76 Initially, the Marlins refused to release him, preferring to keep him in Triple-A as insurance. Just four days after he reported to Edmonton, however, Félix was indeed released outright. “The way he responded to being sent down and his attitude complicated things,” explained Marlins assistant GM Frank Wren. Trappers manager Sal Rende said, “When a guy doesn’t want to be somewhere and shows he doesn’t want to put out, it’s pretty obvious.”77\n\nFélix did not catch on with another organization in 1993. In winter ball, he joined Escogido just before the playoffs, but the Leones were eliminated before the finals.\n\nThe Detroit Tigers invited Félix to spring training in 1994. “He needs somebody to not only treat him nice, but also to demand out of him what he has to offer,” said Tigers skipper Sparky Anderson. “I’m at the stage now, 25 years managing, that I have a luxury other managers don’t have. I’m no longer trying to save him for me. I’d like to save him for himself.”78\n\nFélix made the team but didn’t produce much early on. He spent time on the disabled list after straining his left hip flexor by playfully sliding between pitcher Mike Henneman’s legs during batting practice on May 6.79 When Félix returned, though, he went deep four times in the final week of May. In June, he batted .351 with 20 extra-base hits (13 doubles, seven homers) in 27 games. Overall, Félix slashed .306/.372/.525 in 86 games for Detroit before a players’ strike ended the season prematurely on August 11.\n\nThe labor dispute was not settled until April 1995. Meanwhile, Félix was granted free agency. That June, Félix – described as “a little overweight” by Expos GM Kevin Malone – was still unsigned and working out at Montreal’s minor-league spring training facility.80 Félix joined Montreal’s Triple-A affiliate, the Ottawa Lynx, for 51 games but batted only .225 before he was released on August 13.81\n\nFélix saw action with four different teams in the Triple-A Mexican League over the next three years: the Broncos de Reynosa in 1996, the Mexico City Reds and Leones de Yucatan in 1997, and the Algodoneros de Unión Laguna in 1998. He went to spring training with the Pirates in 1997 but didn’t make the team.82 Félix finished the ’98 campaign with the Seoul-based LG Twins in the Korean Baseball Organization. He returned to that KBO team in 1999 and batted .253 with 13 homers in 97 games.\n\nIn 2000, Félix went back to the Mexican League. After 17 games with the Algondoneros, he rejoined to the Leones de Yucatan and helped them claim the South Division title by hitting .294 with a team-high 22 homers in 94 games. “I’m doin’ pretty good,” he told a Toronto Star reporter who tracked him down that June. Félix said he was up to five sons – “all Juniors” – and insisted that his official listed age of 32 was correct. (Félix’s sons with his wife Paula were named Ethan, Deanny and Gabby according to her personal Facebook page.) Regarding the reputation he built for himself over six major-league seasons, he said, “Hey, I was young. I see plenty of guys now just like I was. Hardheads. Can’t tell them anything. So I just laugh.”83\n\nFélix continued to play sporadically in the Dominican Winter League – with Escogido and the Azucareros del Este – until 2000-01. In his native country, he hit .283 with 12 homers and 29 steals in 247 regular season games over 10 seasons, plus .275 with eight homers and 16 steals in 147 playoff contests.\n\nIn 2001, Félix played his final 75 games as a professional and slashed .305/.429/.461 for the Leones de Yucatán.\n\nAfter baseball, Félix divorced, remarried and fathered a daughter, Efraisa.
