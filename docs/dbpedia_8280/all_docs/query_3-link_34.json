        "text": "Junior's in Historic Downtown Brooklyn at the Corner of Flatbush and DeKalb since 1950\n\nWelcome to Junior's!\n\nHail a taxicab anywhere in New York City and tell the driver, \"Take me to the best cheesecake in New York.\" Odds are you will end up at the corner of Flatbush and DeKalb Avenues in Brooklyn, at Juniors. Founded by Harry Rosen in 1950, Junior's landmark restaurant is known as the home of New York's best cheesecake. For decades, Brooklynites (and other New Yorkers) have come to eat, laugh, and kibbtiz (argue) over cheesecake. In the 1950's, an entire generation came of age at Junior's. Our cheesecake was as important as the Brooklyn Dodgers...the Fox Theater...Coney Island...Brighton Beach. Today loyal customers still come --from all over and all walks of life. Famous mayors. Presidents. Hall of Fame athletes. Authors, singers, movie stars. In fact, it's as true today as it was 70 years ago when we started, \"You haven't really lived until you've had cheesecake at Junior's.\"\n\nJunior's Times Square at Broadway & 45th Street at the Crossroads of the World\n\nLandmark Locations\n\nSince the 1950’s, Junior’s has been famous for great food, great fun, great service, and, of course, the best cheesecake. Our original location in Brooklyn on Flatbush Avenue is still thriving. Or you can visit us in some of our more recent landmark additions—in the heart of the theater district on Broadway in Times Square or you can try your luck at outside of New York—at the Fox Tower Hotel at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut. We recently opened a second location in Times Square on the corner of 49th Street and Broadway. With a full menu ranging from steaks to seafood and sandwiches to salads and cheesecake, we know you’ll have a fabulous dining experience at any of our establishments and, of course, don’t forget to order dessert!\n\nOrder Online\n\nOur History\n\n1929\n\nThe Back Story–The Enduro Cafe\n\n1950\n\nOpening Day\n\n1955\n\nDodgers Win!\n\n1957\n\nGoodbye to Ebbets\n\n1960\n\nThe Magic Formula\n\n1960’s\n\nElect Kennedy\n\n1970s\n\nStayin’ Put\n\n1973\n\nWe’re #1!\n\n1981\n\nSave the Cheesecake!\n\n1982\n\nGrand Reopening\n\n1982\n\nA Grand Proclamation\n\n1989\n\nHandle with Care\n\n1990\n\nBrooklyn Comes Back!\n\n1992\n\nSay Cheesecake! Mr. President\n\n1999\n\nOur Secrets Revealed\n\n2003\n\nAn Epic Moment\n\n2006\n\nAt the Crossroads of the World\n\n2006\n\nWe’re #1 Again!\n\n2008\n\nSex and the City\n\n2008\n\nMeet Us At Foxwoods!\n\n2012\n\nBrooklyn’s Back\n\n2013\n\nA Presidential Visit\n\n2017\n\nJunior’s Takes Times Square, Again!\n\nThe Beginning\n\nOur story begins long before Opening Day in 1950. In 1929, Harry Rosen opens a restaurant on the corner of Flatbush Ave Ext and DeKalb, a luncheonette called the Enduro. Over the years, he expands the restaurant to several storefronts occupying the entire corner. After weathering several changes in the economy, including Prohibition and the Great Depression, Harry expands the Enduro to a full service restaurant with a night-club atmosphere including a raised bandstand with live entertainment.\n\nAfter World War II, the returning servicemen did not have time or interest in visiting nightclubs and fancy restaurants. Brooklynites were busy rebuilding–their lives, their families, the city and the country after the war. The Enduro closed its doors in 1949.\n\nThe Tradition Begins\n\nHarry Rosen was determined to recreate a restaurant on that famous corner. It was to be a new family-style place. Saddled by debt with the failure of the Enduro, he scraped together every dime he had and built Junior’s Restaurant, named in honor of his two sons, Walter and Marvin.\n\nWhen Junior’s opened on Election Day in 1950, it was a modern restaurant in every way–with new neon marquee sign similar to the one on the Paramount Theater across the street, wood countertops and naugahyde booths. Junior’s had become a landmark from the start with bright orange awnings adorning the windows and the red, white and blue bunting that draped the restaurant on that famous Tuesday in November, 1950.\n\nWho’s a Bum!\n\nIn 1955, the Brooklyn Dodgers won the World Series. The press had called them “the Bums” since the mid-1930s when the team could not get out of the cellar.\n\nThe Dodgers were the home grown symbol of how to win: when you get knocked down, you get up again-the eternal secret to success.\n\nA Sign of Change\n\nIn 1957, the Dodgers played their last game at Ebbets Field. They moved to sunny LA. Brooklyn didn’t merely lose a baseball team. The Dodgers had been the fighters and scrappers who represented millions of people who had struggled to make good in a new country. On that last day at Ebbets Field, an entire way of life was eradicated. In 1960, the Field was demolished.\n\nFor Junior’s, it marked a definite loss of customers and a sign of a changing Brooklyn in the 1960’s. Harry’s son, Walter still has a small piece of brick from the famous ballpark mounted on a color rendering of the field. It sits in his office at Junior’s. In the restaurant, you can see stadium seats and memorabilia from that bygone era.\n\nMaster Baker\n\nWhen Harry Rosen was rebuilding the restaurant, he hired Danish-born baker, Eigel Peterson to work full time turning out specialties for the new restaurant. Junior’s featured a full-service bakery replete with danish, rugelach, and cakes from day one. The Rosen family saw all the changes in Brooklyn in the 1960s including the flight to suburbia, the rise of gangs, high unemployment in the boro and the city. However, Harry Rosen never thought for a moment that he would join the exodus from Downtown.\n\nJunior’s in the 1960’s was a place where all colors of people in all styles of dress could gather without tensions. Good food and good service became the great equalizer. Harry was a keen competitor and when it came to cheesecake he was determined to have the Best in Brooklyn. Baker Peterson and Harry perfected a cheesecake recipe by the 1960’s that had become a very popular dessert. They conducted laboratory-like experiments until they hit upon the magic formula. The same recipe and techniques we still use today.\n\nTimes They are a Changin’\n\nAs many families left Brooklyn to move to suburbia, a new population moved into Brooklyn. First generation Americans, immigrants, moved to the neighborhoods. The economy was changing too as many jobs left the city. Bobby Kennedy campaigned for the Senate and Presidential election in Brooklyn. Here he is in 1965 when he pledged to keep the Navy Yard open.\n\nAs Brooklyn continued to change throughout the 1960’s, so did Junior’s. Harry Rosen retired and his sons, Walter and Marvin took over the business. The menu changed to reflect the new tastes of the customers including southern specialties like Fried Chicken, ethnic favorites like Shrimp Parmagiana. Of course, the cheesecake remained and was as popular as ever.\n\nSteadfast\n\nThroughout this time of the changing Brooklyn landscape, when many businesses went bust and the many buildings deteriorated with the struggling economy in the city, we remained. The Paramount closed. But we kept turning out cakes and cheesecakes the same way, 365 days per year. The famous “Burgundy Room” opened in 1961 and it was the scene for many celebrations, office parties, and graduations.\n\nIn fact, for the next 20 years, only three men actually knew and made the entire secret recipe and baking process for Junior’s famous cheesecake.\n\nAnd the world takes notice…\n\nIn 1973, we found our cheesecake celebrated in print. Rosen Rosenbaum of The Village Voice had this to say…”There will never be a better cheesecake than the cheesecake they serve at Junior’s…it’s the best cheesecake in the material world.” That same year, New York Magazine conducted a blind taste test and rated Junior’s the best cheesecake in New York.\n\nTo celebrate we ordered orange-colored “We’re #1!” buttons for our entire staff. We’re still making history with our cheesecake which we deemed “The World’s Most Fabulous.” New Yorkers and the world took notice with lines out the door and down Flatbush Ave for a slice of our heavenly cheesecake.\n\nFrom Out of the Ashes…\n\nIn 1981, late on a hot Sunday, August 17th, a fire destroyed the roof and top floor of Junior’s. As firefighters shot water into the building, onlookers chanted: “Save the cheesecake, save the cheesecake!”\n\nFor nine months and three days, Junior’s was closed. We opened a temporary kiosk in Albee Square Mall next door to sell cheesecake that we baked at a nearby candy factory.\n\nNow Open\n\nOn May 27th, 1982, we reopened Junior’s on our famous corner. It was a huge block party with the entire street closed.\n\nPeople stood in line to get a seat in the remodeled restaurant..\n\nJunior’s Day\n\nAt the reopening of Junior’s in 1982, Harry Rosen thanked God, Brooklyn, and everyone for coming. Borough President Howard Golden and Senator Marty Markowitz attended with Harry, Walter, and Marvin. Golden declared May 27th to be Junior’s Day in Brooklyn.\n\nSenator Marty Markowitz said he’d lost 17 pounds since the fire and was looking forward to growing back into his old suits. The construction allowed us to include a sidewalk cafe as part of the remodeled restaurant.\n\nGreetings from Brooklyn\n\nIn 1989, Junior’s Cheesecake became available for mail order and the entire country learned what Brooklynites have known for decades: “You haven’t really lived until you’ve had cheesecake from Junior’s.” We guarantee perfect delivery of your Junior’s cheesecake anywhere in the 50 states!\n\nWe ship our cheesecake straight from our bakery in stay-fresh packaging specially designed to safely transport our cakes. Your Junior’s Cheesecake will taste as fresh as if you were enjoying it in one of our restaurants.\n\nBring in the Family\n\nAlmost any day of the year, there’s a family at Junior’s celebrating a birthday, anniversary, graduation or homecoming. All marking the occasion with our famous cheesecake. Many of our famous billboards by the Manhattan Bridge or on the BQE remind Brooklynites to dine at Junior’s.\n\nDuring this time a new generation of Rosens begin to take the helm at Junior’s with Walter’s sons, Alan and Kevin entering the business.\n\nThe Dessert of Presidents\n\nDuring a campaign visit in 1992, President Clinton posed with our staff and tasted our cheesecake.\n\nDuring this decade, Junior’s hosted several dignitaries, politicians, and movie stars. Many were regulars with their own favorite tables and dishes.\n\nCheesecake Corner\n\nMayor Guiliani dedicated the corner of Flatbush and DeKalb Avenue in honor of Harry Rosen. The event celebrated the publication of our cookbook, Welcome to Junior’s, in March, 1999. Our first cookbook revealed many of our secret recipes including the one for our famous cheesecake. It is also a memoir of Brooklyn and the Rosen family.\n\nEven with recipe now out to be copied, no one at Junior’s was worried. It was the quality, time, and love involved with baking our cheesecake that was the real secret.\n\n“Start Walking”\n\nIn 2003, Diddy demanded a slice of strawberry cheesecake from the members of Making the Band 2. They walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to Junior’s while rapping the lyrics to The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Juicy.”\n\nEpic moment in reality TV history and evidence that Junior’s is now being enjoyed by an entirely new generation of cheesecake lovers.\n\nBrooklyn in the Heart of Manhattan\n\nIn 2006, we opened our third restaurant with Junior’s Times Square at 45th Street and Broadway. Mayor Bloomberg welcomed us to the Crossroads of the World.\n\nWhen we opened in 2006, our famous “Brooklyn, NY” sign on the Restaurant Kiosk confused tourists and locals alike who thought they exited the subway at the wrong stop.\n\nBest Mailorder Cake\n\nIn 2006, the Wall Street Journal rated Junior’s Best Mailorder Cheesecake. That year we expanded our site to include 12 new flavors. Many are now served in our restaurants. “Everyone was happiest with the fresh cheesecake from Junior’s. Tall and slightly bronzed, it was creamier…”\n\nWe won Best Overall and Best Value above the rest of the competition. Order one today!\n\nA Wedding Brunch\n\nIn 2008, Junior’s was celebrated in film as the location of the Carrie and Big’s wedding brunch in the Sex and the City movie. We thought this was wonderfully appropriate since every day happy couples celebrate their nuptials at Junior’s directly after tying the knot at Brooklyn Borough Hall down the street.\n\nTrivia Fact–This scene was actually filmed at night. Studio lights flooded the restaurant making it look like daylight.\n\nLuck Be a Cheesecake Tonight…\n\nIn 2008, we took our first great adventure outside of New York City. Junior’s at the Fox Tower at Foxwoods Casino is our grandest restaurant yet–with all of the excitement of Foxwoods Casino. We still serve the same great menu including steaks, burgers, seafood, and sandwiches all combined with a lively full service bar.\n\nVisit us when in Connecticut at this lovely new addition to our family Junior’s restaurants.\n\nBelieve the Hype!\n\nIn 2012, we welcomed the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center to Flatbush Avenue. Just down the street from our landmark location, our new neighbor hosts a world-class basketball team, many of whom can be seen dining in our restaurant. Barclays is also the venue for headline concerts and shows. Visit Junior’s for a meal or cheesecake before or after an event.\n\nThe opening of Barclays is a sign of the changing face of Brooklyn. We’re back and better than ever. The neighborhoods are growing, which is evident by all the new construction in the area. And we’re still here, ready to serve the newcomers and our old regulars on Flatbush Avenue Ext.\n\nStrawberry Cheesecake, please!\n\nIn October 2013, President Barack Obama and Mayoral Candidate Bill DeBlasio visit Junior’s in Brooklyn.\n\nThe President purchased an Original Cheesecake and a Strawberry Cheesecake to eat on Air Force One.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, we opened our grandest restaurant yet. Our newest location is at 49th Street and Broadway in Times Square–just a few blocks from our 45th Street restaurant. This amazing new establishment features stainless steel, glittering lights, and a fun atmosphere reminiscent of the original Junior’s in 1950."
