        "text": "The uniform is both simple and flexible. The most important aspect of wearing the uniform is neatness. It is worn every day to the dining room, classes, concerts, performances and all activities on main camp. Students are required to purchase Interlochen logo polo shirts from the SCHOLARSHOP. If needed, corduroy slacks may be borrowed from Interlochen. All other uniform part options must be provided by the student. Please access our uniform sizing chart for the best fit.\n\nSHIRT CHOICES - ALWAYS BUTTONED AND TUCKED\n\nShirts are Interlochen logo polos, purchased from the Scholarshop\n\nTuesday-Saturday: light blue\n\nSunday: white\n\nMonday: either white or light blue\n\nBOTTOM CHOICES\n\nNavy blue shorts (mid-thigh, no denim)\n\nNavy blue cotton slacks or capris (classic styled, tailored, hemmed – no denim)\n\nNavy blue skirt, skort or jumper\n\nNavy blue knickers: Female cut, button-knee, and with pulled up knee-high dark blue socks\n\nIDENTIFIERS\n\nCasual Option 1 - Navy belt + white socks\n\nCasual Option 2 - Navy socks\n\nCasual Option 3 - Navy belt + navy socks\n\nDress Option 1 - Navy blue trousers + navy belt + navy socks\n\nDress Option 2 - Navy blue knickers + navy long socks, pulled up + optional navy belt\n\nPLUS\n\nShoes (sturdy, comfortable shoes – athletic, clogs, street shoes)\n\nCamp ID on navy safety lanyard around neck (provided)\n\nUNIFORM DETAILS\n\nConcert Attire: Students who appear on stage for performances or presentations must wear a Dress Option. Solid red sweaters or solid nice red sweatshirts (not hoodies) are the overlay for those appearing on stage. Because concert attire is especially important to present to all, performers are expected to adjust to this special request for a more unified appearance (i.e. red sweaters/sweatshirts only). The Interlochen Scholarshop has a large selection of appropriate items.\n\nShorts, Skorts, Skirts, Jumpers, Capris, Knickers, and Pants: All shorts, capris, and pants must be worn at the natural waistline. Shorts must be navy blue cotton or corduroy, tailored, and mid-thigh length. No short shorts, denim or jeans fabric, cut-offs, or gym shorts. Shorts are available for purchase at the Interlochen Scholarshop. Cotton pants and corduroy pants must be classic styled, tailored, hemmed, and capri or ankle-length. No denim or jeans fabric, no exercise, biker shorts, or sweatpants style or fabric. Knickers must be buttoned around the calf and worn with long, pulled-up navy blue socks.\n\nAccessories: Small and unobtrusive accessories are preferred. Those who wear hats may be asked to remove them while indoors and during rehearsals.\n\nOuterwear: Red is an important (but not the only) color for sweaters, sweatshirts and jackets. Performers wear only red sweaters or sweatshirts for concerts. They may be pullover or cardigan-style, no hoodies. The Scholarshop has a selection of pullovers available in the Scholarshop.\n\nFootwear: Students enrolled in visual arts classes or design and production must wear closed-toed shoes at all times when in the studio and shop. Students in large ensembles (choir, orchestra, band) are asked to bring dark performance-appropriate shoes.\n\nRehearsal Attire: Refer to arts area materials lists as applicable.\n\nLabels for Clothing and Equipment\n\nIt is IMPORTANT that all articles of clothing and other belongings have a name clearly marked for quick and easy identification. Please mark other personal items with a permanent laundry marker and on the inside of all clothing. Experience has proven that iron-on labels do not withstand several weeks at Interlochen.\n\nPaste an inventory list of clothing and equipment inside a footlocker or suitcase to facilitate packing at the close of the Camp session. Pack in duffel bags, suitcases or footlockers, as storage space is limited. All bags will be stored in the cabin rafters, and are not used during your time at Interlochen."
