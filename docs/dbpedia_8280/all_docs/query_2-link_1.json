When I turn 17 should I start from White again or will I receive a Blue, Purple etc?\n\nThere is no official method since every school has different rules. However, it is quite standard to convert all the belts from the yellow up to a blue belt. This is because there is normally no sense in letting these former under-16 people fight against white belts. On the other side, if they are much better than a blue belt they will prove it quickly during competitions and they will then be rewarded with the purple belt.\n\nanswered Jun 22, 2013 at 8:43\n\nEdgar DerbyEdgar Derby\n\n22622 silver badges22 bronze badges"
