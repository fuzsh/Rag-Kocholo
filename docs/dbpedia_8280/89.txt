"Captain Blue Jr." has been featured, meaning it was chosen as an article of interest.

Captain Blue Jr. (キャプテン ブルー ジュニア) or better known as Junior is a character who originated in the Viewtiful Joe anime.

Background[]

Another self-proclaimed hero worshipper like Joe, only younger. He lived in Blue Town, which was named after Captain Blue, serving as its protector. Junior eagerly awaited for Captain Blue to return and give him his own V-Watch.

Involvement[]

He was Captain Blue's successor until Joe comes along, and because Joe is the one who receives Blue's V-Watch, he is very jealous of Joe. Despite his jealousy, Junior decides to be Joe's sidekick and offered his knowledge of Movieland as a helping hand.

Junior is offered a V-Watch but refuses, so Blue just gave Junior a small case that contains two V-Yo-Yos that allow him to transform. Captain Blue Jr. appeared in a game for the very first time in Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble. He uses many yo-yo based attacks. Appropriately, his transformation phrase is "Henshin a Yo-Yo Ball Baby!".
