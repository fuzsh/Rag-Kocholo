        "text": "If you've ever been stuck on a long airline flight without a good spy novel or the day's newspapers, you may have found yourself flipping through the fat, glossy catalog thoughtfully placed in the seat pocket in front of you. Amid the pages of high-tech toys, power ties and kitchen gadgets, you might have noticed a section devoted to tchotchkes and posters emblazoned with deep thoughts and uplifting slogans. Many of these items have something to do with golf: tee-shaped cuff links, dimpled paperweights, and soft-focus framed photographs of sun-dappled fairways accompanied by proverbs like ''A man's grip on his club is like his grip on life'' or ''Golf is a game that can't be won, only played.''\n\nActually, these are lines spoken by Bagger Vance, the mystical caddy played by Will Smith in Robert Redford's new movie, which might charitably be described as an inspirational poster blown up into a feature film. Visually, ''The Legend of Bagger Vance'' consists mainly of lush vistas of fairways, bunkers and greens on which nice-looking people amble about in crisp Depression-era knee pants, sweaters and cloche hats, swapping spiritual sports talk and pausing to knock a ball or two around the grass.\n\nClearly, the film is meant to capitalize on the current popularity of golf, which has, in the age of Tiger Woods and Maximum Golf magazine, shed its image as the boring pastime of privileged middle-aged white guys.\n\nBut ''The Legend of Bagger Vance,'' despite the participation of bankable young stars like Matt Damon, Charlize Theron and Mr. Smith, is a throwback to an earlier era, the Jim Crow era, to be precise. Not only is it excruciatingly boring -- the cinematic equivalent of a pleasant walk in the country spoiled by pointless distractions -- but its central premises are so banal and dubious as to border on offensiveness."
