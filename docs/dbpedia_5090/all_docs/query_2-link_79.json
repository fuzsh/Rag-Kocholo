        "text": "Will Smith's Focus earned $6.465 million on Friday, including $900,000 in Thursday previews. The $50 million con artist caper comedy is still on track to open just above $20m, which is at the low end of studio (Warner Bros./ Time Warner Inc.) expectations. If I sound disappointed, it's because I rather liked the movie, I like Will Smith as a movie star and feel he's been unfairly tarred over the last several years, and because Focus is just the kind old star-driven, mid-budget, R-rated, adult-skewing \"movie\" that we all claim to want more of. Now you can (and I will) make the argument that every penny of this film's $20m weekend is attributed to Will Smith's star power. This wasn't a big-budget action fantasy based on a pre-established property filled with trailer-friendly moments. This is an almost unassuming romantic comedy with a difficult-to-explain premise and little to sell aside from Will Smith and the theoretical emerging stardom of Margot Robbie.\n\nThat it also played in IMAX this weekend was something of a surprise, as it's precisely the kind of film that doesn't generally play in IMAX. As far as recent \"face on the poster\" tests, it's surely doing a lot better than The Gambler, Blackhat, or Mortdecai. While no one was expecting Hancock numbers, I was rooting for the film because I like the people involved. The good news is that this is the kind of film that would have cost $85m back in 2009 and its respective performance would have had pundits exclaiming that the adult movie was dead. At a cost of $50m, with a potential overseas bump still to come, the picture won't be an out-and-out bomb, although these are not opening weekend numbers befitting the onetime \"biggest star in Hollywood.\" Smith still has the high profile Concussion (a Christmas release concerning football-related brain damage) and Suicide Squad (a DC Comics ensemble caper where he plays the villainous Deadshot) on tap.\n\nThe bad news is that the film may or may-not approach the $59m domestic total of After Earth or the $58m total of Ali, which would leave the outside-the- box project as Smith's second lowest-grossing star vehicle outside of The Legend of Bagger Vance. Like Kevin Costner's Tin Cup, this would-be comeback vehicle will be considered a small-scale hit only because it wasn't as expensive or as critically-dismissed as the prior sci-fi spectacle. So yeah, the After Earth/Waterworld to Focus/Tin Cup comparison still fits. The key will be next weekend, when it faces off against the R-rated Chappie, the R-rated Unfinished Business, and the PG-rated Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, all adult-skewing pictures.\n\nThe only other new release this weekend was The Lazarus Effect. The long-delayed horror title, which was originally a Lions Gate Entertainment picture before ending up at Relativity, started its certain-to-be-brief box office run with a $3.8 million Friday. Theatrical horror hasn't exactly been setting the box office on fire over the last couple years, aside from sequels and spin-offs like Annabelle or The Purge: Anarchy. The reviews for the Blumhouse Productions film were terrible and the buzz was non-existent. So credit a simple premise (young scientists start in a remake of a Flatliners and end up in a remake of Pet Sematary), the unexpected presence of Olivia Wilde, Donald Glover, and Mark Duplass, and the lack of horror thus-far this year (The Woman in Black 2 was gone in a flash). The film cost just $3.3m to produce and should earn around $10m over the weekend, and it'll be lucky if it gets to $25m total by the end of its run. There isn't much more to say about this one other than that, so let's move on.\n\nIn holdover news, Fifty Shades of Grey continued to sink in America (even while remaining a big deal overseas), as the Universal/Comcast Corp. erotic drama earned $3.5 million on its third Friday to cross the $140m mark. That sets the stage for a likely $10.5m weekend (-53%) and a $146m domestic cume. The Dakota Johnson/Jamie Dornan picture is well-over $400m worldwide and now it's just a matter of how quickly it can top $500m. Kingsman: The Secret Service earned $3.11m on its third Friday for a $77m cume, setting the stage for an over/under $11m weekend (-41%) and a strong $85m domestic cume for the 20th Century Fox franchise-starter. SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water earned $2.1m on its fourth Friday to bring its cume to $131m for a likely $6.5m weekend and robust $137m total. The Paramount/Viacom release is set to outgross all of the bazillion first quarter animated films of 2011 when it tops the $143m gross of Rio and is already the second-biggest animated feature released in the first two months of the year after The LEGO Movie ($257m).\n\nAmerican Sniper earned $1.9 million on Friday, setting the stage for a $6m weekend for an over/under $330m domestic cume. So it looks like it will pass Guardians of the Galaxy ($333m) and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part I ($337m) by the end of next week to become 2014's biggest domestic grosser. Kevin Costner's McFarland, USA earned $1.99m on its second Friday, setting the stage for an over/under $7 million on its second weekend, down just 36%, for a $21.4m ten-day total. That's not great, but the Walt Disney drama, which is better than you'd expect, will soon match its $25m production budget. It's playing close enough to Million Dollar Arm to guestimate that the film will end up just under $40m domestic, with the hopes of equal (or better) performance overseas.\n\nThe Duff earned $2.1m for a $15m cume andor a likely $6.3m weekend (-41%), giving the $8m teen comedy a $19m ten-day cume. Fairing less well is Hot Tub Time Machine 2, which earned $690k on its second Friday (-70%) for a likely $2.2m (-65%) weekend and sad $9.9m cume. Even at $14m to produce, this \"sequel no one asked for\" is an utter flop. In Oscar news, Birdman jumped around 100% from last Friday for around $495k yesterday and a probable $1.9m weekend, which will put the Best Picture/Best Director (but not Best Actor) winner over $40m domestic. Julianne Moore's Oscar-winning Still Alice will approach the $12m mark at the end of tomorrow. Oh, and Jupiter Ascending (co-starring Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne) earned $530k last night, giving the film a $41.5m total.\n\nThat's it for today. Join me tomorrow for weekend estimates and more holdover news."
