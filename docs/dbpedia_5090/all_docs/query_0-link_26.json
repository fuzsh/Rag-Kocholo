        "text": "NEW YORK — Robert Redford has scratched himself from the starring role of golf pic “The Legend of Bagger Vance,” and word is that Brad Pitt tops the list to replace him.\n\nRedford remains the film’s director and producer.\n\nThe $70 million film, to be distributed domestically by DreamWorks, is based on Steven Pressfield’s 1995 novel about a local Georgia golfer and WWI hero named Rannulph Junah who competes against golf greats Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones in a 1931 tourney. The playing field is leveled as Junah, the role for which Pitt is now being eyed, receives advice and spiritual guidance from a mysterious black caddie named Bagger Vance. The title role isn’t set, though the prospect of Morgan Freeman taking the job has been raised.\n\nPic is being co-financed by Eureka (the European entertainment conglom formed by Germany’s Kirch Group and Italy’s Mediaset), DreamWorks and Icon Entertainment Intl. Eureka has distribution rights for continental Europe; Icon has the U.K. and the rest of the world.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWhile financing hinged on Redford’s dual roles as star and director, sources said a younger A-list actor like Pitt, whose international drawing power is exceptionally strong, will not jeopardize the pic’s backing.\n\nIt’s understood that Redford stepped away from the starring role in order to focus his full energies toward directing the pic, which he envisions as a very stylized, metaphorical film.\n\n“Vance” was scripted by Jeremy Leven, and the film will be produced by Redford, Michael Nozik and Jake Eberts in a co-production between Allied Filmmakers and Wildwood Enterprises.\n\nDespite the casting changes, sources close to the project said the pic is still on track to begin pre-production in September.\n\nRedford, who last directed and starred in “The Horse Whisperer,” previously directed Pitt in a star-making turn in “A River Runs Through It.” Pitt is repped by CAA and Brillstein-Grey."
