        "text": "Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder of DreamWorks, officially announced on\n\nFebruary 9, 2000 that his company has acquired the majority of interest,\n\napproximately 80%, in Pacific Data Images (PDI). As reported [AF 2/8/00],\n\nthis deal comes on the heals of PDI founder and Chairman, Carl Rosendahl's\n\ndeparture from the company to pursue \"other creative interests.\" However,\n\nRosendahl will remains as a consultant for the newly named company,\n\nPDI/DreamWorks. Katzenberg said that Palo Alto-based business will remain a\n\nstand alone unit of DreamWorks and continue to produce computer animated\n\nfilms, commercials and visual effects for the parent company. In addition,\n\nDreamWorks plans to open a branch of PDI in Southern California, entitled\n\nPDI/DreamWorks South, which will be run by PDI. The DreamWorks/PDI\n\nrelationship started in 1996 when DreamWorks acquired 40% of the company in\n\nan exclusive deal to create a series of animated films. The first film\n\nproduced under the deal was 1998's ANTZ. PDI has also produced the visual\n\neffects for DreamWorks films such as THE PEACEMAKER, FORCES OF NATURE and\n\nthe upcoming THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE. Currently, PDI is working on\n\nSHREK, a comedy featuring the voices of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie\n\nMurphy; and TUSKER, which follows the adventures of a herd of elephants."
