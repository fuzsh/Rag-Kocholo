        "text": "I have to praise the Daily for its year 2000 roundup of music and television. The opinions represented quality and thorough critical insight.\n\nYet, I cannot say the same about Greg Jerrett’s commentary on this year’s movies.\n\nMr. Jerrett, your article demonstrated pure ignorance. How can you form a reasonable judgment about the films of this year when we have just entered the month of December? By general rule, December is when some of the best movies are released, and 2000 doesn’t seem to be an exception. “Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,” “Shadow of the Vampire,” “Finding Forrestor,” “All the Pretty Horses,” “Snatch, The Gift,” “Castaway,” “The House of Mirth,” “State and Main,” “O Brother Where Art Though?,” “Family Man,” “Traffic” and “13 Days” are all major studio and independent films that possess critical buzz and have yet to be publicly released. There are also critically acclaimed films such as “Requiem for a Dream” and “Quills” that have not been released in the Ames area. Have you seen any of these films? With the exception of “13 Days,” I doubt it. You would have mentioned them, or would you?\n\nYour article only mentions nine films from this year. You take the almost obligatory shots at the summer’s raunchy comedies, and stupid teen movies. You then attack Renee Zellweger’s brilliant performance in “Nurse Betty.” Trust me, your opinion is held only by a small minority of people. Finally, you end your commentary by saying “X-Men” and “Gladiator” are the highlights of the year.\n\nThat’s it? Those are the main low and high points of the year. Your scope is completely limited to nine films released from May through the middle of September. Your opinions lack merit because you fail to demonstrate that you have any ample knowledge of this year’s movies.\n\nI’m sorry to inform you that there were other highs and lows within and outside of those months. Valid arguments can be made that films such as “Wonderboys,” “Boiler Room,” “American Psycho,” “High Fidelity,” “Gladiator,” “Time Code,” “The Perfect Storm,” “X-Men,” “Nurse Betty,” “The Contender,” “Almost Famous,” “The Legend of Bagger Vance” and “Unbreakable” are great films. In addition, arguments can be made that “Battlefield Earth,” “Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,” “Big Mama’s House,” “Charlie’s Angels,” “Coyote Ugly,” “Ladies Man,” “Mission to Mars” and “Loser” are the worse films of the year.\n\nWithin one paragraph, I demonstrated more range than you did in your entire article and this list was a very small unfinished sampling of the films I have viewed this year so far. You have a right to say that this year hasn’t been a great year in movies. However, to do so you have to prove that you know what you are talking about, and from the looks of your article, you don’t.\n\nDavid Frank\n\nFreshman\n\nPre-journalism and mass communications"
