        "text": "A Century of Film\n\nDreamWorks\n\nThe Studio\n\nIt’s not as well known as the UA story but it’s in a similar vein. In fact, everything I looked at before writing this piece referenced the founding of United Artists and the way four major players in Hollywood came together to form their own studio. The big difference was that those were three stars and a director. Here, it was a director, a man who had been mostly running a studio and a man who hadn’t done so well with films but had made himself a billionaire through music.\n\nThe foundation for DreamWorks came in October of 1994 when the three men, Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen announced their new studio (and much more, at least according to the plan, but this history only cares about the studio). But it really had begun back in April when Frank Wells died in a helicopter crash, which should have lead to Katzenberg’s ascendency at Disney but instead put Michael Eisner in a position to push him out (a decision that, compounded by Eisner’s dick refusal to pay Katzenberg, eventually cost Disney $250 million). So, needing something new to do and always having wanted to run a studio, Katzenberg managed to convince the other two to form a brand new studio, an actual attempt to compete with the majors.\n\nHerein lies the irony. DreamWorks is often described as the first new studio (or at least the first new major studio) in decades, since the Studio Era. But it never really competed with the majors. Disney was never a major studio in the Studio Era; in fact, it didn’t even distribute its own films into well into the 1950’s. And aside from competing with Disney on the financial front, they would constantly compete with Miramax on the awards front even though Miramax was not a major and was in fact owned by Disney.\n\nIt would take until 1997 for the first DW film to reach theaters. The first moves were made on the animated front with a long pre-production put into The Prince of Egypt before the live action films even began. Knowing that whatever the first DW film would be, it would be heavily scrutinized, they actually, wisely in my opinion, went with a standard genre film (The Peacemaker) rather than debuting with Spielberg’s Oscar bait for 1997, Amistad.\n\nThen came 1998 and the real push by DW with Saving Private Ryan (the big prestige film that, conveniently, also ended up being the #1 film of the year at the box office) and Antz. Antz actually was a big deal, if for no other reason than its marketing: “Disney had long used celebrity voice casts, but its promotion centered on the film, not the actors. For Antz, the advance publicity hyped the fact that this was the first cartoon to have Woody Allen in a featured role, as well as Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover and Christopher Walken, among others. The hook of Woody Allen as a cartoon voice was noted; later the Shrek marketing campaign would emphasize its starring voice cast from the start.” (The Dream Team: The Rise and Fall of DreamWorks: Lessons from the New Hollywood, Daniel M. Kimmel, p 93).\n\nThe big thing came in the fall when DreamWorks and Miramax faced off in the Best Picture race at the Oscars and the campaigning began in earnest. Miramax would win Picture but the following year it would be DreamWorks that would come out on top with American Beauty. In just their third year, the studio had already won the top Oscar prize. The following year they would again have a Ryan type Picture with Gladiator being one of the biggest films of the year and also winning Best Picture. But Almost Famous was a sign of the bigger problems the studio would have: it was the big prestige fall picture and it got great reviews but couldn’t quite make it into the Oscar race and its box office couldn’t even cover the cost of the music.\n\nIn one sense, Gladiator had been the peak. They would never again have a live action film that earned as much as Gladiator and the next DW film to even earn a Best Picture nomination would be distributed by Universal after the studio had been sold (Munich). There was still the animation, of course, and it would be the most important part of the studio through the length of its time as a distributor with multiple successful franchises, most notably Shrek but also Madagascar and, after the sale, How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nShrek would also be a hallmark of Katzenberg’s need to succeed against Disney. The film itself would take shots at the House of Mouse and the DVD would actually be released on the Friday of Monsters Inc release rather than a Tuesday as is normal in the industry. Katzenberg would achieve victory by winning the first Best Animated Film Oscar but in the entire history of DW the only other Oscar in that category would go to Wallace & Gromit which would only be a DW distribution film, not a production of their animation division.\n\nWhat you will often read about DW is that it failed as a major studio. And for the most part, that’s true. It only lasted as a distributor of its own films for eight years. In 2005, it sold the studio, and while it would continue to make films, it would no longer distribute them and that was one of the hallmarks of being a major.\n\nNotable DreamWorks Films\n\nThe Peacemaker (1997) – first DW release\n\nAmistad (1997) – first Spielberg DW film\n\nSaving Private Ryan (1998) – first big hit, first Best Picture nominee\n\nAntz (1998) – first DW Animation film\n\nAmerican Beauty (1999) – Best Picture winner\n\nGladiator (2000) – second Best Picture winner\n\nChicken Run (2000) – first Aardman film released through DW\n\nShrek (2001) – Oscar winner for Animated Film; biggest DW film to date, start of DW’s biggest franchise\n\nShrek 2 (2002) – biggest DW film; highest grossing Animated Film ever released to date\n\nWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) – to date, the last DW film to win Best Animated Film at the Oscars\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha (2005) – first DW film distributed by another company (Columbia)\n\nMatch Point (2005) – last film distributed by DreamWorks SKG\n\nShe’s the Man (2006) – first DW film distributed by Paramount beginning a long deal\n\nThe Directors\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nFilms: 6\n\nYears: 1997 – 2011\n\nAverage Film: 88.0\n\nBest Film: Munich\n\nWorst Film: The Terminal\n\nThe tricky thing during this period is that Spielberg wasn’t as prolific as he had been in the past complicated by some of his films being produced by DreamWorks but not released domestically by DreamWorks (A.I., Minority Report, War of the Worlds). But he was still the heart of the non-animated DreamWorks films and while he did have one film that fell way short of his usual critical and commercial success (The Terminal) he still released several films which were among the best the studio made as will be obvious from their consistent placement in the Top 5 lists below.\n\nSam Mendes\n\nFilms: 3\n\nYears: 1999 – 2008\n\nAverage Film: 95.0\n\nBest Film: American Beauty\n\nWorst Film: Road to Perdition\n\nThree of the first four films Sam Mendes directed were fantastic and those were the three made for DreamWorks (Jarhead was the other). While, sadly, Road to Perdition and Revolutionary Road would fall short at the Oscars, American Beauty is still the biggest Oscar success in the studio’s history.\n\nThe Stars\n\nTom Hanks\n\nTom Hanks’ successful collaboration with Spielberg overlapped perfectly with the start of DreamWorks but Hanks also managed to move over and work with Sam Mendes for one film, giving the most under-appreciated performance of his career.\n\nEssential Viewing: Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me if You Can, Road to Perdition\n\nEddie Murphy\n\nThere was no question that Murphy’s Donkey was a major reason for the success of the Shrek films. But Murphy also made Dreamgirls for DreamWorks, his biggest critical success and the one that earned him an Oscar nomination (and might have won him the Oscar if not for the badly timed release of Norbit which, ironically, is also a DreamWorks film).\n\nEssential Viewing: Shrek, Shrek 2, Dreamgirls\n\nGenres\n\nAs should be evident from the list below, DreamWorks isn’t big on genre films and even when they are, they’re not necessarily all that strong. They’ve done well with the few Crime, Musical and War films they’ve released but they’ve mostly focused on Comedies and Kids films.\n\nAll of the DreamWorks films, ranked\n\nnote: This list consists of all the films I considered for the various categories below. This is the complete lists of all films released by DreamWorks SKG while it existed as a distributor (1997-2005) and then films produced by DreamWorks but released by other studios after that. It does not include films in which DreamWorks had a hand in making the film but did not distribute it in the U.S. prior to late 2005 when it stopped being a distributor (A Beautiful Mind and War of the Worlds for example).\n\nAmerican Beauty\n\nMunich\n\nAlmost Famous\n\nRevolutionary Road\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nAmistad\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nUp in the Air\n\nWallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\nPerfume – The Story of a Murderer\n\nMatch Point\n\nCatch Me If You Can\n\nChicken Run\n\nShrek 2\n\n***.5\n\nMillennium Actress\n\nFlushed Away\n\nCollateral\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon\n\nWar Horse\n\nShrek\n\nThe Kite Runner\n\nDreamgirls\n\nKung Fu Panda\n\nLetters from Iwo Jima\n\nFlags of our Fathers\n\nPuss in Boots\n\nGhost in the Shell 2: Innocence\n\nKung Fu Panda 2\n\n***\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha\n\nAntz\n\nSmall Time Crooks\n\nShrek Forever After\n\nOver the Hedge\n\nThe Soloist\n\nFright Night\n\nGalaxy Quest\n\nRed Eye\n\nShrek the Third\n\nTropic Thunder\n\nThe Curse of the Jade Scorpion\n\nThe Road to El Dorado\n\nAnything Else\n\nThe Terminal\n\nGladiator\n\nGhost Town\n\nThe Help\n\nThe Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio\n\nMegamind\n\nHollywood Ending\n\nMadagascar\n\nThe Prince of Egypt\n\nReal Steel\n\nSinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas\n\nAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\n\nThe Lovely Bones\n\nJust Like Heaven\n\nBee Movie\n\n**.5\n\nAn Everlasting Piece\n\nSpirit: Stallion of the Cimarron\n\nThe Contender\n\nThings We Lost in the Fire\n\nThe Time Machine\n\nDinner for Schmucks\n\nThe Ring\n\nDreamer\n\nThe Legend of Bagger Vance\n\nShark Tale\n\nThe Island\n\nMadagascar: Escape 2 Africa\n\nThe Peacemaker\n\nHead of State\n\nMonsters vs. Aliens\n\nThe Ruins\n\nMouse Hunt\n\nWin a Date with Tad Hamilton!\n\n**\n\nThe Mexican\n\nSmall Soldiers\n\nPaulie\n\nIn Dreams\n\nI Love You, Man\n\nCowboys & Aliens\n\nThe Last Kiss\n\nHotel for Dogs\n\nEvolution\n\nHouse of Sand and Fog\n\nWhat Lies Beneath\n\nThe Last Castle\n\nThe Love Letter\n\nThe Uninvited\n\nOld School\n\nDisturbia\n\nShe’s Out of My League\n\n*.5\n\nBiker Boyz\n\nForces of Nature\n\nThe Ring Two\n\nEnvy\n\nShe’s the Man\n\nRoad Trip\n\nEagle Eye\n\nBlades of Glory\n\n*\n\nThe Tuxedo\n\nThe Heartbreak Kid\n\nNo Strings Attached\n\nTransformers\n\nThe Haunting\n\nLittle Fockers\n\nI Am Number Four\n\n.5\n\nEuroTrip\n\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen\n\nSurviving Christmas\n\nNorbit\n\nNotes on Films\n\nnote: These are just tidbits on some of the films. The films are listed in alphabetical order. Unless I have something specific to say, I don’t mention films that have full reviews elsewhere or films that I saw in the theater from 1989 to 2005 (they are all mentioned in those Nighthawk Awards).\n\nThe Contender – Nothing about the film itself but about people trying to be too clever. One of the first times I contributed something to the IMDb was to correct two “goofs” in this film that were listed, one about Slater’s age and one about the Clinton trial, with both cases the person who entered them not paying attention to the details (whether the character was a senator or a congressman).\n\nGalaxy Quest – This film has gotten some interest this past year because of its 20th anniversary. It’s a good film with a hilarious concept but the concept (and the performances) only goes so far.\n\nThe Island – The movie that helped sink the studio though I don’t think it’s nearly as bad as the reviews it got. I mostly remember it for an anecdote. It was the summer of 2005 (actually, the day Katrina was going to hit New Orleans) and we were in a truck stop outside of Chicago on our way moving to Boston and I read a piece by Ebert in The Chicago Sun-Times about how Scarlett Johansson in escaping paparazzi called 911 and identified herself as “Scarlett Johansson, I’m an actor”. Ebert noted it for using actor to encompass both genders but the punchline of the piece was that supposedly the 911 responder replied “I dispute that. I just paid $10 to see The Island.” An ironic anecdote given that she might earn two Oscar nominations this year (written pre-Oscar noms of course but she did in fact get the noms).\n\nThe Kite Runner – The book that everyone had to read, even Tom Brady, who bought it in our store and our cashier carded him because his credit card wasn’t signed and she didn’t know who he was even though we were in the Boston area, he was coming off his third Super Bowl win and he was on the cover of the Sports Illustrated less than a foot from her. But I really disliked the book. The film is pretty good though.\n\nThe Lovely Bones – I guess DreamWorks had a specialty in books everyone had to read that repulsed me. This was especially creepy because this book was a big hit when two girls from Oregon were found after having been raped and murdered (I remember learning that they were found while in New Mexico on my honeymoon). Well acted but the concept just was too creepy and didn’t work that well on film.\n\nMadagascar – A perfect example of a studio wasting money. Why bother to put all that money into the name actors when the best voice in the film, by a mile, is the director.\n\nOver the Hedge – I loved the comic strip from early on (when a strip had one of my all-time favorite punch lines from any strip, after a squirrel was run over and they asked how he looked: “His third dimension done been REVOKED!”). It was bizarre that it took almost a decade from when the comic strip announced the film (in the forward to the third collection) to it finally making it to theaters.\n\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen – I remember seeing back-to-back trailers for this and GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra in 2009 (probably before Star Trek since all three were Paramount films) and turning to Veronica and saying “I feel like my childhood has been raped.”\n\nTropic Thunder – A good example of the trickiness between when a role is a cameo or a supporting one worthy of awards attention. Tom Cruise is barely in the film but he’s so brilliantly funny when he is I do give him awards points. But it’s a fine line and not always easy to see.\n\nThe Best DreamWorks Films by Decade\n\n1990’s: American Beauty\n\n2000’s: Munich\n\n2010’s: War Horse\n\nThe Worst DreamWorks Films by Decade\n\n1990’s: The Haunting\n\n2000’s: Norbit\n\n2010’s: I Am Number Four\n\nThe Best DreamWorks Films by Genre\n\nAction: n/a\n\nAdventure: none\n\nComedy: Up in the Air\n\nCrime: Road to Perdition\n\nDrama: American Beauty\n\nFantasy: none\n\nHorror: n/a\n\nKids: Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit\n\nMusical: Almost Famous\n\nMystery: none\n\nSci-Fi: Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence\n\nSuspense: n/a\n\nWar: Saving Private Ryan\n\nWestern: none\n\nnote: Films listed with n/a mean that no DreamWorks film in that genre met my threshold (***.5). Films listed with none means that DreamWorks has not made a film in that genre.\n\nThe Worst DreamWorks Films by Genre\n\nAction: The Tuxedo\n\nAdventure: none\n\nComedy: Norbit\n\nCrime: The Mexican\n\nDrama: House of Sand and Fog\n\nFantasy: none\n\nHorror: The Haunting\n\nKids: Hotel for Dogs\n\nMusical: n/a\n\nMystery: none\n\nSci-Fi: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\n\nSuspense: Eagle Eye\n\nWar: Saving Private Ryan\n\nWestern: none\n\nnote: Films listed with n/a mean that no DreamWorks film in that genre met my threshold (** or below). Films listed with none means that DreamWorks has not made a film in that genre.\n\nThe Most Under-Rated DreamWorks Film\n\nJust because I don’t think certain DreamWorks films have been as appreciated as they should have been (like Amistad, Almost Famous and Revolutionary Road failing to get nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars) doesn’t mean they aren’t highly thought of. Looking at the 21st Century list for the TSPDT and award nominations, there is just one film made by DreamWorks that I really think got missed for its proper due so it has a full review down at the bottom.\n\nThe Most Over-Rated DreamWorks Films\n\nGladiator\n\nNot a bad film by any means and anchored by a really good Russell Crowe performance. But Joaquin Phoenix is quite bad (in spite of the bizarre awards attention) and the film is quite a mess at times and certainly didn’t deserve to sweep the five awards groups over far, far better competition. Read the full review here.\n\nAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\n\nThere are some funny moments (namely the anchor gang war) but the massive popularity of this film and the way it gets quoted all the time like it’s some sort of comedy classic just perplexes me. I find it even more annoying now since I live in San Diego and there’s a giant ad for his stupid podcast on the side of the trolley some mornings when I go to work.\n\nHouse of Sand and Fog\n\nReally strong acting (well, from three of the four – the fourth is awful) can’t save this film that’s all about people acting stupidly.\n\nThe Ring\n\nRingu is a Horror classic. That’s a genuinely frightening movie. This is a movie that tries to frighten you.\n\nTransformers\n\nNot that people think this film is good but it made a lot of money and came close to winning the Oscar for Visual Effects and it kick-started a franchise of really, really bad films.\n\nThe Statistics\n\nTotal Films 1912-2011: 112 (18th – sort of)\n\nnote: The reason that it’s only sort of in 18th place is because I only actually count the DreamWorks films that were distributed by the studio itself on my giant spreadsheet, which is only 62 (which is 26th) but 112 films would be in 18th.

Amistad is the only other film in the Top 10 (#6 in 1997). Beauty and Ryan win the Drama award with noms for Munich, Road and Amistad. Almost Famous wins the Comedy award with a number of nominees (Catch Me if You Can, Shrek 2, Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Sweeney Todd, Up in the Air).\n\nIn the late 90’s, DreamWorks and Miramax contended for Best Picture with DreamWorks losing in 98 (Ryan) and winning in 99 (Beauty) and 00 (Gladiator) while A Beautiful Mind (DreamWorks for international release) won in 01. After that, DreamWorks fell off, receiving nominations for Munich, Letters from Iwo Jima, Up in the Air, The Help and War Horse.\n\nDreamWorks did very well at the Globes for a stretch, winning Drama in 98 (Ryan) and 99 (Beauty) and both in 00 (Gladiator, Almost Famous). After that, it would win Comedy in 06 (Dreamgirls) and 07 (Sweeney Todd) but would not win Drama again. Comedy noms would be earned by Chicken Run and Shrek while Drama noms by Amistad, Match Point, Revolutionary Road, Up in the Air, The Help and War Horse.\n\nAmerican Beauty and Gladiator win the BAFTA with noms for Ryan, Almost Famous, Shrek, Up in the Air and The Help while Wallace and Gromit wins British Film with a nomination for Chicken Run.\n\nRyan, Beauty and Gladiator would all win the PGA with noms for Amistad, Almost Famous, Wallace and Gromit, Dreamgirls, Road to Perdition, Up in the Air and a number of Animated films after that category was added.\n\nRyan, Beauty and Gladiator win the BFCA with noms for a whopping 15 other films.\n\nRyan wins three critics awards (NYFC, LAFC, CFC), American Beauty and Almost Famous win two each and Up in the Air wins one.\n\nBest Director\n\nSteven Spielberg (Saving Private Ryan)\n\nSteven Spielberg (Munich)\n\nSam Mendes (American Beauty)\n\nSam Mendes (Road to Perdition)\n\nSam Mendes (Revolutionary Road)\n\nAnalysis: The #6 spot goes to Spielberg again, for Amistad. These two directors really dominated the best of DreamWorks. The first three all win the Nighthawk while Mendes (Revolutionary), Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous) and Jason Reitman (Up in the Air) earn noms. The three winners all win in Drama though there are no Comedy winners while there are a total of 10 nominees (including winners) evenly split.\n\nSpielberg and Mendes won Oscars with nominations for Ridley Scott (Gladiator), Spielberg again (Munich), Eastwood (Letters from Iwo Jima) and Jason Reitman.\n\nSpielberg and Mendes also won the Globes with a total of nine other nominees, two of those being Eastwood (his two WWII films) with Spielberg (two more) and Mendes (one more) adding noms as well.\n\nSurprisingly, there have been no BAFTA winners with Spielberg (Ryan), Mendes (Beauty), Scott and Michael Mann (Collateral) the only nominees. Ryan and Mendes did win the DGA with noms for Spielberg (Amistad, Munich), Scott, Crowe, Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) and Reitman. Spielberg (Ryan, Catch Me if You Can) has won the BFCA twice while Mendes also won while Spielberg (Munich, War Horse), Condon, Eastwood, Tim Burton (Sweeney) and Reitman have earned noms.\n\nMendes won two critics awards, Spielberg won one as did Crowe, Mann and Depp.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nRevolutionary Road\n\nUp in the Air\n\nMunich\n\nPerfume – The Story of a Murderer\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nAnalysis: There have been just four Nighthawk nominees (the first four). Up in the Air does win the Comedy award while several Animated films have earned Comedy noms.\n\nShrek, Munich and Up in the Air earned Oscar noms with the latter failing to win a huge surprise given its massive Consensus win. Up in the Air won the Globe with a nom for Munich. Shrek and Up in the Air won the BAFTA with noms for Catch Me if You Can, Kite Runner, Revolutionary Road and The Help. Up in the Air won the WGA with a nom for The Help and the same went for the BFCA. Up in the Air won the LAFC, CFC and NBR.\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nAmerican Beauty\n\nAlmost Famous\n\nMatch Point\n\nChicken Run\n\nAmistad\n\nAnalysis: American Beauty and Almost Famous win the Nighthawk with Match Point earning a nom. Amistad and Ryan earned Drama noms while Chicken Run and Flushed Away earned Comedy noms.\n\nBeauty and Famous won the Oscar with noms for Ryan, Gladiator, Match Point and Letters from Iwo Jima. Beauty won the Globe with noms for Ryan, Famous and Match Point. Famous won the BAFTA with noms for Beauty, Gladiator and Collateral. Beauty won the WGA with a nom for Ryan and Famous. Beauty and Famous won the BFCA. Almost Famous won the BSFC and CFC.\n\nBest Actor:\n\nKevin Spacey (American Beauty)\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio (Revolutionary Road)\n\nTom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan)\n\nGeorge Clooney (Up in the Air)\n\nJohnny Depp (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street)\n\nAnalysis: As it’s a performance I often feels is under-appreciated, I feel I should point out that Tom Hanks is #6 on my list for Road to Perdition. Spacey wins the Nighthawk with noms for Hanks (both times), Depp, Leo and Clooney. Depp and Clooney both win the Comedy awards while Spacey wins Drama and Hanks (twice) and Leo earn Drama noms.\n\nSpacey and Russell Crowe (Gladiator) win the Oscar with noms for Hanks (Ryan), Ben Kingsley (House of Sand and Fog), Depp and Clooney.\n\nDepp is the only Globe nominee in Comedy and he won the award. In Drama, there have been no winners but nominations for Djimon Hounsou (Amistad) Hanks (Ryan), Spacey, Crowe, Leo (Catch Me If You Can, Revolutionary Road), Kingsley and Clooney.\n\nSpacey won the BAFTA with noms for Hanks (Ryan), Crowe and Clooney.\n\nSpacey won SAG with noms for Hanks (Ryan), Crowe, Kingsley and Clooney. Crowe won the BFCA with noms for Kingsley, Depp and Clooney. Clooney won the NYFC and NBR while Spacey won the CFC.\n\nBest Actress\n\nAnnette Bening (American Beauty)\n\nKate Winslet (Revolutionary Road)\n\nViola Davis (The Help)\n\nHelena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street)\n\nJoan Allen (The Contender)\n\nAnalysis: Bening and Winslet both win the Nighthawk while Davis is nominated. Allen earns a Drama nom while Bonham Carter and Tracey Ullman (Small Time Crooks) earns a Comedy nom.\n\nBening didn’t win the Oscar (though she should have) and Winslet wasn’t nominated because of The Reader being considered lead (even though she is better in Road) but Allen and Davis were nominated.\n\nWinslet won the Globe with Bening, Allen, Zhang Ziyi (Memoirs of a Geisha) and Davis earning Drama noms and Ullman, Beyonce (Dreamgirls) and Bonham Carter earning Comedy noms.\n\nBening won the BAFTA with noms for Kate Hudson (as a lead in Almost Famous), Ziyi, Winslet, Saoirse Ronan (Lovely Bones) and Davis. Bening and Davis won SAG with noms for Allen, Ziyi and Winslet. Davis won the BFCA with noms for Jennifer Connelly (House of Sand and Fog) and Ronan. There have been, surprisingly, no critics winners.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman (Almost Famous)\n\nChristopher Walken (Catch Me If You Can)\n\nAnthony Hopkins (Amistad)\n\nChris Cooper (American Beauty)\n\nEddie Murphy (Dreamgirls)\n\nAnalysis: There have been no Nighthawk winners and Cooper isn’t even a nominee (though Jude Law is for Road to Perdition). Hoffman and Murphy win the Comedy award while there are two nominations for Tropic Thunder (Downey, Cruise) and one for Sweeney Todd (Alan Rickman). There are also Drama noms for Stanley Tucci (Lovely Bones) and Paul Newman (Road to Perdition).\n\nThis has been in a sense the best acting category for DreamWorks at the Oscars (10 nominations or more than Actor and Actress put together) but there has also never been a winner. The nominations are for Hopkins, Joaquin Phoenix (for Gladiator which is ridiculous), Jeff Bridges (The Contender), Newman, Walken, Jamie Foxx (Collateral), Murphy, Michael Shannon (Revolutionary Road), Downey and Tucci.\n\nMurphy won the Globe while Hopkins, Bridges, Phoenix, Law, Foxx, Downey, Cruise and Tucci earned noms. Phoenix and Walken won the BAFTA while Cooper, Eddie Murphy (for Shrek), Law, Foxx, Downey and Tucci earned noms.\n\nWalken and Murpy won SAG while there were noms for Bridges, Gary Oldman (also The Contender), Hopkins, Cooper, Phoenix, Foxx, Downey and Tucci. Hopkins, Phoenix and Murphy won the BFCA with noms for Law, Foxx, Adam Arkin (Flags of Our Fathers), Downey and Tucci. Phoenix (with other films) and Walken each one won critics award.\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nFrances McDormand (Almost Famous)\n\nOctavia Spencer (The Help)\n\nAnna Kendrick (Up in the Air)\n\nJennifer Hudson (Dreamgirls)\n\nVera Farmiga (Up in the Air)\n\nAnalysis: Spencer wins the Nighthawk while McDormand, Kendrick, Hudson, Farmiga and Kate Hudson (Almost Famous) earn noms. McDormand, Jennifer Hudson and Kendrick win the Comedy award while Drama noms are added for Jessica Chastain (The Help), Thora Birch (American Beauty) and Shohreh Aghdashloo (House of Sand and Fog). The category is dominated by films with multiple really strong nominations and that’s reflected in the other nominations as well.\n\nOf the five films nominated at the Oscars, three of them (Almost Famous, Up in the Air, The Help) earn multiple noms with Jennifer Hudson and Spencer winning the Oscar. Only House of Sand and Fog earns the mere 30 points for a nom. Almost Famous and The Help also win the Globe (Kate Hudson, Spencer) with a second nom while Dreamgirls wins, Up in the Air has two noms and there is a nom for Scarlett Johansson in Match Point. Spencer and Jennifer Hudson win the BAFTA with multiple noms for American Beauty (Thora Birch, Mena Suvari), Up in the Air and The Help and a single one for Almost Famous (just McDormand because Hudson was nominated as a lead). Spencer and Jennifer Hudson win SAG and BFCA with double noms for Almost Famous, Up in the Air and The Help at both groups.\n\nThis category is quite strong at the critics. McDormand and Spencer win three critics awards each. Aghdashloo wins two awards. There are also awards for Elaine May (Small Time Crooks), Gong Li (Memoirs of a Geisha), Jennifer Hudson and a split award for Farmiga and Kendrick.\n\nBest Ensemble\n\nAmerican Beauty\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nAlmost Famous\n\nRevolutionary Road\n\nUp in the Air\n\nAnalysis: This is based on the total points for acting for all members of the cast. American Beauty actually wins this by a considerable margin as it is, surprisingly, the only DreamWorks films to earn points in all four acting categories.\n\nAmerican Beauty and The Help both won the SAG Ensemble category while Saving Private Ryan, Almost Famous and Dreamgirls earned noms.\n\nBest Editing:\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nMunich\n\nAmerican Beauty\n\nAlmost Famous\n\nUp in the Air\n\nAnalysis: American Beauty wins the Nighthawk with noms for Ryan, Almost Famous, Munich and Revolutionary Road.\n\nRyan wins the Oscar with noms for Beauty, Gladiator, Almost Famous, Collateral and Munich. Beauty and Gladiator win the BAFTA with noms for Ryan, Collateral and Up in the Air. There are five ACE winners, two in Drama (Ryan, Gladiator) and three in Comedy (Almost Famous, Dreamgirls, Sweeney Todd) as well as nine other nominees. Up in the Air and War Horse are the only BFCA noms.\n\nBest Cinematography:\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nMunich\n\nAmerican Beauty\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha\n\nAnalysis: Amistad and Revolutionary Road easily could have been in the Top 5 as well. It’s a very tough top group. Ryan and Beauty both win the Nighthawk with noms for the other five mentioned as well as War Horse. That gives Spielberg’s films a win and three noms.\n\nThe strongest Tech category at the Oscars in that four films have won (Ryan, Beauty, Perdition, Memoirs) with additional noms for Amistad, Gladiator and War Horse. Also very strong at the BAFTAs with five wins in seven years (Beauty, Gladiator, Perdition, Collateral, Memoirs) and two other noms (Ryan, War Horse). It’s surprising then that only three films win the ASC (Beauty, Perdition, Geisha) though five others earn noms and just two win the BFCA (Gladiator, War Horse) with a nom for Lovely Bones. Ryan won the LAFC and BSFC, Beauty won the NSFC and Collateral won the LAFC.\n\nBest Original Score:\n\nAmistad\n\nAmerican Beauty\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha\n\nCatch Me If You Can\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nAnalysis: No points for realizing that three of the top four are John Williams scores. Amistad wins the Nighthawk while the other four (as well as Saving Private Ryan and Revolutionary Road) earn noms.\n\nLike Supporting Actor, a category where the studio is strong but not great. DW has managed 13 noms at the Oscars but not a win with five noms for Williams scoring Spielberg films (and another Williams nom for a non-Spielberg film).\n\nGladiator and Memoirs win the Globe with noms for five other films. Beauty and Memoirs win the BAFTA with noms for nine other films. And most impressive is five wins at the BFCA (Ryan, Gladiator, Road to El Dorado, Catch Me If You Can, Memoirs) with a nom for War Horse.\n\nBest Sound:\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nMunich\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nWar Horse\n\nAmistad\n\nAnalysis: No surprise, if you’ve seen the Best Sound post, that Spielberg dominates here. Ryan wins the Nighthawk with noms for the other four and Almost Famous.\n\nRyan, Gladiator and Dreamgirls win the Oscar with noms for Road to Perdition, Memoirs of a Geisha, Flags of Our Fathers, Transformers, the second Transformers and War Horse. Ryan and Almost Famous win the BAFTA with noms for American Beauty, Gladiator, Shrek, Collateral and War Horse. DreamWorks dominated the CAS for a stretch, winning four awards in less than a decade (Ryan, Gladiator, Road to Perdition, Dreamgirls) and six more noms in that same decade (and one more after). War Horse earned a BFCA nom.\n\nBest Art Direction:\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha\n\nRevolutionary Road\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\nPerfume – The Story of a Murderer\n\nAmerican Beauty\n\nAnalysis: Memoirs and Road win the Nighthawk with noms for the other three and Amistad (which was #6 on my list).\n\nMemoirs and Sweeney won the Oscar with noms for Ryan, Gladiator, Road to Perdition, Dreamgirls, Revolutionary Road and War Horse. Gladiator and Road to Perdition win the BAFTA while Ryan, American Beauty, Memoirs, Road and War Horse earn noms. DreamWorks does well at the ADG (with its multiple categories) with wins for Gladiator, Catch Me If You Can, The Terminal and Memoirs and another 14 films earning nominations. Gladiator won the BFCA with noms for Lovely Bones and War Horse. Gladiator won the NBR.\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nWallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nTransformers\n\nThe Lovely Bones\n\nGladiator\n\nAnalysis: Only Ryan and Galaxy Quest even earn Nighthawk noms with no winners. This just isn’t a very strong category for the studio.\n\nGladiator wins the Oscar while Transformers and Real Steel earn noms. Ryan wins the BAFTA with noms for Antz, Gladiator, Chicken Run, Shrek and War Horse. A first glance at the VES makes it look better than it is. A whopping 22 DreamWorks films have earned a nomination but in a guild with multiple categories and lot of nominees, 13 of those film earned just one nom and 7 of those were in the Animated category. Three more Animated films earned two noms but without a win and two more earned three Animated noms but with no wins. Flags of Our Fathers and Wallace and Gromit each won one award while Transformers and How to Train Your Dragon each won multiple awards. Lovely Bones earned a BFCA nom.\n\nBest Sound Editing\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nMunich\n\nWar Horse\n\nGladiator\n\nFlags of Our Fathers\n\nAnalysis: Ryan wins the Nighthawk while Gladiator and War Horse earns noms.\n\nRyan and Letters from Iwo Jima win the Oscar with noms for Road to Perdition, Memoirs of a Geisha, Flags of Our Fathers, Transformers and War Horse. This is the big category at the guilds, partially because the arrival of DreamWorks coincided with the expansion of the MPSE categories. Of the 55 films to earn guild noms, 43 of them have earned an MPSE nomination. Of those, 10 won awards and earned multiple noms (sometimes winning multiple awards), 4 won the award and 7 more earned multiple noms without a win. The Animated category has helped with all but one of the films that earned Annie noms also earning an MPSE nom (all but Ghost in the Shell 2).\n\nBest Costume Design:\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha\n\nPerfume – The Story of a Murderer\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\nAmistad\n\nRevolutionary Road\n\nAnalysis: Memoirs and Sweeney win the Nighthawk while Amistad, Gladiator, Perfume and Revolutionary Road earn noms.\n\nGladiator and Memoirs win the Oscar with nominations for Amistad, Dreamgirls, Sweeney and Revolutionary Road. Memoirs wins the BAFTA while Gladiator, Catch Me If You Can, Sweeney and Revolutionary Road earn noms. American Beauty, Memoirs and Sweeney win the CDG with noms for Almost Famous, Road to Perdition, Dreamgirls, Revolutionary Road, Up in the Air and The Help. The Help also earns a BFCA nom (which didn’t begin until 2009).\n\nBest Makeup\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nThe Time Machine\n\nPerfume – The Story of a Murderer\n\nAnalysis: Memoirs and Sweeney both win the Nighthawk. Ryan and Perfume both earn nominations.\n\nRyan, Time Machine and Norbit earned Oscar noms. How Norbit earned one while Memoirs and Sweeney Todd didn’t is beyond me and appalling. Five films have earned BAFTA noms (Ryan, American Beauty, Gladiator, Memoirs, Sweeney) but none have won the award. Almost Famous earned two MUAHSG noms while American Beauty, Legend of Bagger Vance and Road to Perdition earned one each.\n\nBest Technical Aspects\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nMunich\n\nAmistad\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nAnalysis: This just adds up the totals in the Tech categories. Dominated by Spielberg, of course.\n\nBest Original Song:\n\n“Someday Out of the Blue” (The Road to El Dorado)\n\n“Accidentally in Love” (Shrek 2)\n\n“Listen” (Dreamgirls)\n\n“Family of Me” (Over the Hedge)\n\n“Heist” (Over the Hedge)\n\nAnalysis: “Someday Out of the Blue” and “Fever Dog” (Almost Famous) both earn nominations in a weak year.\n\nPrince of Egypt won the Oscar with a weak song. Dreamgirls earned three nominations but failed to win. “Accidentally in Love” earned an Oscar nom. The Globe nominees (no winners) include Prince of Egypt, Spirit, Shrek 2, Dreamgirls and The Help. Prince of Egypt and Dreamgirls won the BFCA while Shrek 2 and The Help earned noms.\n\nBest Animated Film:\n\nWallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit\n\nChicken Run\n\nShrek 2\n\nMillennium Actress\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon\n\nAnalysis: Of course, animation has been a key part of DreamWorks since its inception. Chicken Run, Wallace and Gromit and Flushed Away all win the Nighthawk while the list of nominees is long (Shrek, Millennium Actress, Shrek 2, Ghost in the Shell 2, Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon, Puss in Boots).\n\nThe Oscar results are similar but the same with two winners (Shrek, Wallace) and seven nominees (Spirit, Shark Tale and Panda 2 get in instead of Millennium Actress and Ghost 2). Bee Movie, Panda, Dragon and Puss earned Globe noms while Chicken Run and Shrek earned Picture – Comedy noms before this category existed at the Globes. Flushed Away, Shrek the Third and Dragon earned BAFTA noms. In the years before the category existed at the BAFTAs, Chicken Run earned a Best British Film nom and Wallace and Gromit actually won the award.\n\nShrek, Wallace and Gromit, Panda and Dragon all won the Annie although Panda caused a bit of a scandal, winning over Wall-E when DreamWorks bought voting memberships for all of their employees (also a bit of that with Dragon winning over Toy Story 3). Another 12 films have earned nominations. That means 16 of the 25 Animated films that DreamWorks released through 2011 earned noms though, most notably, Shark Tale (which earned an Oscar nom) and Flushed Away (see below) didn’t. Of those 25, 15 of them have earned BFCA noms with Prince of Egypt, Chicken Run, Shrek and Wallace winning.\n\nChicken Run won three critics awards, Shrek won two and Wallace and Gromit won one.\n\nBest Foreign Film:\n\nMillennium Actress\n\nThe Kite Runner\n\nLetters from Iwo Jima\n\nGhost in the Shell 2: Innocence\n\nAnalysis: DreamWorks has done very little with Foreign films although, ironically, all four of them are listed here because they are all ***.5. Millennium Actress is the only one to actually earn a Nighthawk nomination.\n\nLetters won the Globe and the BFCA while Kite Runner earned Globe and BAFTA noms.\n\nBest Film (by my points system):\n\nAmerican Beauty\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nMunich\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nRevolutionary Road\n\nAnalysis: Adding up all of my points. American Beauty and Road to Perdition actually tie and Munich is just one point lower. Amistad is just one point behind Revolutionary Road but there’s a nine point drop-off after that.\n\nBest Film (weighted points system)\n\nWest Side Story\n\nTom Jones\n\nRebecca\n\nSome Like It Hot\n\nRaging Bull\n\nAnalysis: West Side Story pulls just ahead with more points in key categories (Picture, Director, Editing, Cinematography). Some Like It Hot leapfrogs in because of the acting and writing.

studios are harder because I have to come up with them myself. There are no books that rank the best films by studio and no way to sort through them on the IMDb or TSPDT.\n\nThe TSPDT Top 10 DreamWorks Films\n\nSaving Private Ryan (#722)\n\nAmerican Beauty (#808)\n\nLetters from Iwo Jima (#152)\n\nGladiator (#164)\n\nAlmost Famous (#188)\n\nMunich (#217)\n\nMatch Point (#245)\n\nWallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (#252)\n\nShrek (#288)\n\nChicken Run (#351)\n\nnote: The numbers in parenthesis are the position on the most recent (2019) TSPDT list. The first two films are from their Top 1000 list. The other eight are from the 21st Century list. The two lists don’t match at all. Munich has only made one appearance in the Top 2000 list (and is no longer on it) while Match Point has been consistently on the list, the last three years around #1500 yet Munich has always been higher on the 21st Century list. I don’t know why their lists don’t match up.\n\nnote: This is the explanation for that last sentence and why it is crossed out, courtesy of Bill Georgaris at TSPDT who politely answered my question: “The answer is simple. The two lists are compiled separately to each other. The 1,000 Greatest Films is compiled by using best-of-all time lists and miscellaneous lists (e.g. best sci-fi films, best films of the 90s). However, it does not include best-of-year lists (e.g. best films of 2018, etc.) The 21st Century list, on the other hand, does incorporate best-of-year lists + the same best-of-all time lists & miscellaneous lists used by the 1,000 Greatest Films. So, essentially… 1,000 Greatest Films = Best-of-all time lists + Miscellaneous lists. 21st Century = Best-of-all time lists + Miscellaneous lists + Best-of-Year lists. This is why there are differences in where you expect to see 21st-Century films ranked between the two lists.”\n\nThe IMDb Top 5 DreamWorks Films\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nGladiator\n\nAmerican Beauty\n\nThe Help\n\nCatch Me If You Can\n\nnote: Apparently IMDb voters are as sucked in an Oscar voters on The Help, rating it considerably higher than Munich or Almost Famous.\n\nTop 10 U.S. Domestic Box Office – DreamWorks distribution only\n\nShrek 2 – $441.22 mil\n\nShrek – $267.66 mil\n\nSaving Private Ryan – $216.54 mil\n\nMadagascar – $193.59 mil\n\nGladiator – $187.70 mil\n\nCatch Me If You Can – $164.61 mil\n\nShark Tale – $160.86 mil\n\nWhat Lies Beneath – $155.46 mil\n\nAmerican Beauty – $130.09 mil\n\nThe Ring – $129.12 mil\n\nTop 10 U.S. Domestic Box Office – distributed by other studios\n\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen – $402.11 mil\n\nShrek the Third – $322.71 mil\n\nTransformers – $319.24 mil\n\nShrek Forever After – $238.73 mil\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon – $217.58 mil\n\nKung Fu Panda – $215.43 mil\n\nMonsters vs. Aliens – $198.35 mil\n\nMadagascar: Escape 2 Africa – $180.01 mil\n\nThe Help – $169.70 mil\n\nKung Fu Panda 2 – $165.24 mil\n\nnote: All of these except The Help (Disney) were distributed in theaters by Paramount.\n\nBooks\n\nThe Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys and Sells the New Hollywood, Tom King, 2000\n\nYes, this book is awfully early in the history of DreamWorks, because of course, it’s not about the studio specifically, but a biography of Geffen. And because it came so early the subtitle isn’t as accurate as King hoped. But it has a lot of good inside information about the founding of DW and its early years even if King’s goal (like so many biographies of such celebrities) is to show what an unpleasant person Geffen is.\n\nDown and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film, Peter Biskind, 2004\n\nIt’s really a book about Miramax but it covers the Oscar wars from 1998 to 2001 when DreamWorks was the biggest competitor against Miramax every year. The book is fascinating to read but it has the caveat that most of the people written about dispute what Biskind wrote (the same was very true for his previous book as well).\n\nDisneywar, James B. Stewart, 2006\n\nDreamWorks is only involved in the book tangentially, either in competing with Disney in the marketplace or because of all the turmoil caused by Katzenberg being ousted and his lawsuit against the studio. Still, an important book when looking at the state of Hollywood at the time that DW was founded.\n\nThe Dream Team: The Rise and Fall of DreamWorks: Lessons from the New Hollywood, Daniel M. Kimmel, 2006\n\nI don’t know what lessons Kimmel thinks are in the book unless it’s that even important people shouldn’t think they can succeed in building a new studio. Though he mentions he had to put off publication when DW was sold in 2005, it seems clear that Kimmel’s book was designed to be a takedown of the three men who founded DW. It’s got all the important facts but it’s small and slight and you the next book is a much better choice if you want to read about the studio.\n\nThe Men Who Would Be King: An Almost Epic Tale of Moguls, Movies and a Company Called DreamWorks, Nicole LaPorte, 2010\n\nA much more thorough book than Kimmel’s book, not just because it came later but because LaPorte already knew a lot of the story (she had been a writer for Variety during the time period covered), it’s longer, more in-depth and from a more important publisher (Houghton Mifflin). Still, it’s also more interested in the lurid under-pinings of what went wrong than about how they made the movies they made.\n\nReviews\n\nThe Best DreamWorks Film I Haven’t Yet Reviewed\n\nAmistad (1997, dir. Steven Spielberg)\n\nIn 1982, Steven Spielberg was a major contender to win his first Oscar for E.T. but Gandhi won over the Academy voters and the prize went to Richard Attenborough instead, the third year in a row that an actor turned director had won the award following Robert Redford and Warren Beatty. Attenborough had made a film about real events and given it an epic scale if not really an epic scope. Yet, 15 years later when Spielberg made a far better film, also about real events, it somehow didn’t make it into the final five at the Oscars in the same year that a bloated schmaltzy epic dominated the awards. It was the first attempt by DreamWorks to break into the Oscar race and it wouldn’t quite make it (though it did earn several nominations) but things would go better the following two years.\n\nAmistad has a fascinating human story at its core, an important historical moment on the road to the Civil War (even if the film makes it seem like a bigger deal historically than it was), one that wasn’t unknown in 1997 but certainly became far better known because of this film. We start with kind of a bang (an insurrection aboard a slave ship by slaves who have been illegally captured in Africa and are being brought to the Americas to be sold) and then slowly move into the more intricate story: the legality of what has happened. Several key points were arising and several different claimants wanted to take possession of the slaves. What would happen to them? Would truth prevail? Would righteousness prevail?\n\nThis is a film much more like Schindler’s List than any other film Spielberg had made before this. It is not a film with flashy moments, in spite of the insurrection or the finale of the film with the fantastic destruction of the slave fortress on the African coast. That final moment though, brings up the most under-appreciated part of this film – the absolutely brilliant score that stirs your emotions and you remember long after the film is over, far more than the James Horner score that is really more of a song score to go along with the Celine Dion song that killed so many brain cells. It’s an interesting move from John Williams, far more emotionally stirring than most of his works, calling to how you feel about the people not about the action.\n\nBut the heart of the film is in the performances. While the film had several big names like Matthew McConaughey and Morgan Freeman, those weren’t the performances that really carry the film. It was the mostly unknown Djimon Hounsou as the leader of the slaves, Cinque, who really took over the film, at least until the final scene when Anthony Hopkins gives a speech so powerful that it not only wins over the Supreme Court in the film but also won over the Academy enough to earn him a nomination in a very tough year for Supporting Actor.\n\nAmistad does what the best films of this kind do. It gives us a fascinating historical story, gives it to us relatively accurately and does it with fantastic technical work and brilliant performances. It makes history come alive, telling a great story while also opening a bit of the past that had been allowed to slip away from most people.\n\nThe Worst DreamWorks Film I Haven’t Yet Reviewed\n\nNorbit (2007, dir. Matthew Robbins)\n\nBy 1996, Eddie Murphy was in decline. He had been one of the biggest box office stars of the 80’s but he hadn’t had a real hit since 1988 and his Razzie nominations were more recent than his Golden Globe nominations. Then, he suddenly hit paydirt with The Nutty Professor, his first genuine hit in eight years and a film that restored his critical reputation, earning him a Globe nom and even winning him the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor (which, in 1996, given the performances that year, is ridiculous). But Murphy seemed to take the wrong lesson from the film. The idea was that Murphy could still genuinely be funny if he was heart-felt about it. Instead, he seemed to take on the idea that fat suits and multiple performances in the same film were the way to go. Flash forward to a decade later, when his career had been very up and down (his live action films had been disasters but he was a major reason the Shrek films were so massively popular). He then made Dreamgirls, giving the best performance of his career (until 2019) but quickly followed that with Norbit, a film that went back to the multiple performances with fat-suits. Murphy didn’t seem to realize that he didn’t need that to be good, that if he just gave a genuine performance like he did in Dreamgirls he could succeed.\n\nDreamgirls earned him plaudits, including his first Oscar nomination and SAG and Globe wins. But it’s entirely possible that the release of the crass, desperately unfunny Norbit, with him back in the fat suit cost him the Oscar. Certainly he was on track to win the Oscar (he had, after all, already won the Globe, BFCA and SAG and eventual Oscar winner, Alan Arkin, had yet to win an award (he would win the BAFTA after the Oscar) and he is the only Supporting Actor to win both SAG and the Globe and not win the Oscar) until the release of Norbit.\n\nNorbit proceeds from the flawed idea that fat suits and multiple performances automatically make a film funny. Murphy seems to have learned the same bad lesson that Tyler Perry has and this film features him as an overweight woman who is just awful to have to behold on screen. That’s Rasputia, the horrible abusive wife of Norbit, the shy guy who just wants to get with Thandie Newton (and who can blame him?). It’s the total combination that Perry also goes for and that just doesn’t work. You don’t laugh because the character is fat or awful or being played by a man because none of that is funny. The whole film is proof of what Roger Ebert says – people trying to be funny aren’t funny.\n\nI suppose I could say more about this film but why bother? It’s one of the worst films ever to earn an Oscar nomination and I can’t fathom how they decided the fat-suits in this film were worthy of a Makeup nomination when short-listed films Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Sweeney Todd were passed over. I can’t fathom how almost as many people thought this piece of shit was worthy of seeing in the theater as thought Dreamgirls were as it made almost as much money at the box office. It comes down to this – if you thought the fat-suits in The Nutty Professor were the funny thing, if you think Tyler Perry is hilarious when he dresses up as Madea, then maybe you are one of the people this film was made for. I prefer my films to be good.\n\nBonus Review\n\nThe Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001, dir. Woody Allen)\n\nIn Stardust Memories, perhaps the most under-appreciated film Woody Allen ever made, the main character played by Allen (and somewhat derived from him) is constantly told that people love his movies, “especially the early, funny ones.” That was in 1980 and by the early 00’s when he started working with DreamWorks (one of the hallmarks of Allen’s career is moving from studio to studio, often going with a new studio like Orion, Miramax and DreamWorks) he had been making the more serious films (or, at least the more awards-bait films even if they are Comedies) for over two decades. So what an interesting move to go back and make a film much more similar in style to Sleeper or Love and Death.\n\nNow, that’s not to actually compare The Curse of the Jade Scorpion to Sleeper or Love and Death. Those are really good, hilarious films whereas this film, similar in style (in that it both embraces and mocks conventions of a particular genre, in this case, a noir Mystery) is at best a mid level *** film and probably most people would rate it considerably lower than I do. But it was the very fact that Allen was making a film like that again that was interesting. It works less that Allen himself played the lead and if the film hadn’t cost as much as it did (because it was a period film it cost more than most Allen films) he couldn’t do what he had done at least once before (with September) and just abandon what he had shot and start over with a different cast. But in some ways, Allen works perfectly for the part because he’s old, because he’s short, because he was never really a good looking guy.\n\nAs well as being a Mystery, this is also kind of a Screwball Comedy. Allen plays C.W. Briggs, an insurance investigator who is at the top of his profession, finding the crooks who commit insurance fraud or theft. He’s facing off against Fitzgerald, the new efficiency expert (did they even have that in 1940?) played by Helen Hunt, who can’t stand Briggs, doesn’t like his outdated methods and is in a hard position for Briggs to argue with since she’s sleeping with the boss (played by Dan Aykroyd). What throws everything off is that Briggs and Fitzgerald are both put under hypnosis at an office party, but the hypnotist actually wants to use Briggs to defeat his own anti-theft precautions and steal him a large number of jewels.\n\nIt’s far from a great film but it’s memorable to me if for no other reason than that it is one of only two Woody Allen films that Veronica and I have seen in the theater (Midnight in Paris is the other one). Some of the lines don’t work so well and many might find it nauseating to see Allen hitting on Elizabeth Berkeley or, even more bizarre, Charlize Theron climbing into Allen’s bed. But the plot makes the film work and it’s fun to watch Allen and Hunt snipe at each other and it’s always nice to see Wallace Shawn in a film even if is role is small.\n\nBonus Bonus Review – The Most Under-Rated DreamWorks film\n\nFlushed Away (2006, dir. David Bowers / Sam Fell)\n\nAs already mentioned in my piece on the 2006 Best Animated Film race, this film was the best of an admittedly weak group of films, but after scoring PGA and BFCA nominations (which had five each while the Oscars would only have three) and a BAFTA nom (three like the Oscars), it would stumble and miss out on an Oscar nomination. What’s more, because it wasn’t a DreamWorks production and because it wasn’t at all what they were expecting Aardman to hand over to them (very different from the Oscar winning Wallace & Gromit from the year before as well as being Aardman’s first all computer generated film), the studio didn’t give it much of an awards push. It also performed well below DreamWorks’ box office expectations and prompted DW’s decision to end their partnership with Aardman. Yet, it was the best of the animated films that year and if not as good as the first two feature length Aardman films, is still at the same level or higher than most of the rest and still stands up as really good entertainment with some great visuals and fun voice casting.\n\nRoddy is a rat. But he is a pampered rat who lives in a posh Kensington flat and is the beloved house-pet. When the family is away and an uncouth (and unkempt) rat named Sid shows up, Roddy gets outflanked and flushed down the toilet and ends up in a sewer world that is far more disgusting but also far more interesting than he could have imagined. Roddy is voiced by Hugh Jackman who does a perfect job of giving us the rich guy who is out of his depths. Then he meets Rita, the shapely street-smart rat who he’s going to need to get out of the mess. Of course you know he will fall in love with her in the end and will find a way to stay together with her but it’s not about the destination but the journey.\n\nWhat Roddy finds beneath London is a world teeming not just with rats but with other animals as well and that’s where the fun comes in. Rita has been having run-ins with The Toad, played with wonderful bombast by Ian McKellen and McKellen also has to deal with his own idiot minions (Andy Serkis, Bill Nighy) as well as his cousin, Le Frog (Jean Reno) that he brings in to solve the problems. It’s the world that they all inhabit and the wonderful voice performances that really light up would could have been a mundane story that has been done before (animals living in a quasi-human world).\n\nIt’s hard to say what DreamWorks might have been expecting from the next Aardman film. They definitely weren’t expecting this. But this is not only better than they gave it credit for, but better than the vast majority of standard animated films that DreamWorks itself has produced over the years. It creates a fascinating world (because of the size differences, the underground world makes some interesting and original use of a lot of human items) and inhabits it with fascinating and entertaining characters. What’s more, it does it with some visually fascinating animation, far more so than the three films that actually were nominated for the Oscars (Happy Feet, Cars, Monster House). With barely any award attention, not a big box office haul and being ignored by critics since its release, Flushed Away will just have to make do with being the most under-appreciated film DreamWorks ever released.\n\nPost-2011\n\nAll-Time: If you thought the Top 5 were dominated by Spielberg and Mendes before they are even more so now. Lincoln is the best film DreamWorks has made and also wins Adapted Screenplay and Actor while finishing in the Top 5 in Director, Supporting Actress, Editing, Cinematography, Score, Art Direction, Costume Design and Makeup. 1917 is in the Top 5 for Picture, Director, Score, Sound and Sound Editing and actually wins Cinematography. First Man lands in the Top 5 for Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor, Editing, Cinematography, Score, Sound, Visual Effects and Sound Editing. The Post is in the Top 5 in Actor and Actress. Bridge of Spies lands in the Top 5 for Supporting Actor. Ghost in the Shell and Welcome to Marwen are in the Top 5 for Visual Effects. Trolls (“Can’t Stop the Feeling”) and Captain Underpants (the theme song) both land in the Top 5 for Original Song.\n\nAcademy Awards: Green Book became the first DW film to win Picture since 2000. Supporting Actor has now been cemented as the best acting category for DW as it has now won the award twice since 2011 (Bridge of Spies, Green Book). Spielberg has had three more films earn Oscar nominations and all of them were nominated for Picture. DW has had 13 films nominated for Picture and three of those won the award. Six of those were directed by Spielberg and none won the award. His films account for over 30% of all DW nominations (48 of 159). (Actually that last stat is down a little now given the 10 noms for 1917).\n\nCritics: Lincoln set new highs for points (669) and awards (10) with new highs for the NYFC (210) and NSFC (150).\n\nGlobes: Green Book with 3 wins is the only DreamWorks film to win more than one Globe since 2011 and the first DreamWorks film to win Picture since 2007. Or it was until 1917 won Picture and Director. Lincoln did set a new high with 7 noms (and is the first DreamWorks film to win Actor – Drama) followed by The Post with 6.\n\nGuilds: Several post 2011 films have earned 8 nominations but only First Man (9) and Lincoln (14) have earned more than that. Lincoln and Green Book with two awards each are the only two films to win more than one guild award. Lincoln‘s 490 points are the only that make the Top 5. 1917‘s 8 guild noms still aren’t near the top but it did win the PGA and the DGA as well as four guild awards in all.\n\nBAFTA: DreamWorks has been much less of a factor here since 2011 with no film winning more than one award and only Lincoln (10) and Bridge of Spies (9) racking up nominations. At least until 1917 hit the BAFTAs. 1917 simply dominated the BAFTA’s. Seven wins, tied for the 2nd most all-time. Only the third film under the current British Film system to win both Picture and British Film and the only film in BAFTA history to win both and win Director.\n\nBFCA: Lincoln set a new high with 12 nominations and 450 points while winning 3 awards. First Man‘s 10 noms also beat the previous high. After only managing two films through 2011 with Picture, Director and Screenplay noms, Spielberg himself has had three films do it since 2011. Since 2011, every film with just one nom was nominated for Animated Film and only one film with more than one nom wasn’t nominated for Picture (it was Trolls – nominated for Animated Film and Song). DreamWorks now has 18 Picture noms at the BFCA without winning since its three straight wins from 98 to 00."
