Also with Joel Gretsch, Jack Lemmon, Bruce McGill, J. Michael Moncrief, Andrea Powell and Lane Smith. [2:05]\n\nSEX/NUDITY 3 - A few kisses and a brief moment of sexual innuendo (a woman walks into a room as a man talks about a woman putting something in her mouth -- it's unclear what he is describing, although salaciousness is implied). A man and woman kiss passionately as they begin to undress (only his jacket and tie and the sheer outer layer on her dress are removed). A woman undresses to a full slip as she and a man talk about having sex; she then sits on his clothed lap and they kiss. A man hits a golf ball into a woman's cleavage as she lays on the floor.\n\nVIOLENCE/GORE 3 - A war scene with a few explosions and people falling down when hit; some corpses with no bloody wounds are also shown. A man clutches his chest as he has a heart attack and falls down. We hear a gunshot and then see a man's hand, which was holding a gun, fall open. A group of people are nearly hit by a golf ball in two separate scenes. A boy falls from a tree (played for laughs). We hear war sounds in a man's memory.\n\nLANGUAGE 4 - Many mild obscenities, a couple of scatological references, and an anatomical reference.\n\nDISCUSSION TOPICS - Golf, the Depression, suicide, war.\n\nMESSAGE - When you play the game of life, play for enjoyment rather than for victory.\n\nCAVEATS\n\nBe aware that while we do our best to avoid spoilers it is impossible to disguise all details and some may reveal crucial plot elements.\n\nWe've gone through several editorial changes since we started covering films in 1992 and older reviews are not as complete & accurate as recent ones; we plan to revisit and correct older reviews as resources and time permits.\n\nOur ratings and reviews are based on the theatrically-released versions of films; on video there are often Unrated, Special, Director's Cut or Extended versions, (usually accurately labelled but sometimes mislabeled) released that contain additional content, which we did not review.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nSee ratings & reviews at Critics.com\n\nFILTER by RATINGS\n\nDid you know you can now filter searches by any combination of ratings? Just go to our search page or use the search bar, with or without a keyword, from the top navigation menu. Move sliders from 0-10 in any combination, check and uncheck MPAA ratings and use keywords to further filter results -- please let us know what you think.\n\nTHE ASSIGNED NUMBERS\n\nUnlike the MPAA we do not assign one inscrutable rating based on age but 3 objective ratings for SEX/NUDITY, VIOLENCE/GORE & LANGUAGE on a scale of 0 to 10, from lowest to highest depending on quantity & context |more|\n\nFIND US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFollowFollow\n\nFollowFollow\n\nadvertisement\n\nCOPYRIGHT POLICY\n\nPrint a page, share with friends, and yes, please go ahead and email links.
