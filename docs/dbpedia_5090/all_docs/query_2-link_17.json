        "text": "Want to try to sneak a peek of some Hollywood action happening in Boston? Channel 5 reports that Matt Damon and Casey Affleck’s new movie “The Instigators” will be filmed in Boston between March 20 and March 26.\n\nSpecifically you’d want to hang out near Bova’s Bakery at the corner of Salem Street and Prince Street in the North End. They’ve already announced to customers that they’re closing for the week to let film crews do their thing.\n\nThe movie is being shot for Apple Original Films. Damon and Ben Affleck are teaming up to produce it. The Instigators is said to be about a robbery that goes wrong and the crooks get some help while they’re on the run from their therapist. Sounds funny. [Source: Channel 5]\n\nMatt Damon: Then and Now\n\nHear Geno on the air weekday afternoons. Geno's passions include fat guy food, concerts, sports, travel to Europe and South America, and old school music. Geno's radio career began in his hometown of Portland, Maine.
