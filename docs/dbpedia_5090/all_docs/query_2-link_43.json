Have an account? .\n\n\"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" star Will Smith has appeared in a variety of movies.\n\nSmith's best films include newer ones like \"Dads\" (2019) and \"King Richard\" (2021).\n\nBut movies like \"Collateral Beauty\" (2016) and \"After Earth\" (2013) were panned by critics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith had a small cameo in \"Student of the Year 2\" (2019).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 6%\n\nSummary: After following his crush to a new college, Rohan Sachdev (Tiger Shroff) tries to impress her by winning the \"Student of the Year\" cup.\n\nThe sequel, which was released seven years after the original, was a major letdown for critics.\n\nIn a review for The National, Kumar Shyam wrote that \"the script and the climax make it an overall dud.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played Cypher Raige in \"After Earth\" (2013).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 12%\n\nSummary: In the distant future, general Cypher Raige (Smith) explores a ravaged Earth with his son Kitai (Jaden Smith) at his side.\n\n\"After Earth\" was a flop for critics, who largely found it heavy-handed and painfully long.\n\nCritic Larushka Ivan-Zadeh called it \"preachy\" and \"draggingly directed by M. Night Shyamalan.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith starred as Howard in \"Collateral Beauty\" (2016).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 13%\n\nSummary: While reeling from the loss of his young daughter, Howard Inlet (Smith) writes letters to the concepts of love, time, and death as a therapeutic exercise and is stunned when they seemingly answer his response.\n\nDespite being packed with a star-studded ensemble cast, \"Collateral Beauty\" struck the wrong chord with critics.\n\n\"'Collateral Beauty' packs an impressive amount of failure into a film that barely crosses the 95-minute mark,\" Steve Prokopy wrote for Third Coast Review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Winter's Tale\" (2014), he played the Judge.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 13%\n\nSummary: Based on the novel by Mark Helprin, \"Winter's Tale\" centers on Peter Lake (Colin Farrell), a thief who sets out to save heiress Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay) from the brink of death. Smith appeared as Lucifer.\n\nCritics said \"Winter's Tale\" failed to capture the magic of the original novel.\n\n\"'Winter's Tale' feels distant and disconnected,\" Nathalia Aryani wrote for the MovieMaven. \"It should have been magical.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was James West in \"Wild Wild West\" (1999).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 16%\n\nSummary: This steampunk Western follows Secret Service agents James West (Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) as they set out to protect the president from assassination.\n\nCritics said the producers of \"Wild Wild West\" should've invested in a better script instead of doubling down on outdated CGI.\n\n\"The movie is exhausting, utterly without feeling, and pointless — though Smith looks great in his Western outfit,\" Terrence Rafferty wrote for The New Yorker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith returned as detective Mike Lowrey in \"Bad Boys II\" (2003).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 24%\n\nSummary: A drug investigation takes a dramatic turn for Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) when Marcus' sister Syd (Gabrielle Union) is taken hostage.\n\nCritics called \"Bad Boys II\" an overblown and overstuffed action film that lacked the punch of its predecessor.\n\n\"The movie is one big raging pile of macho steam-blowing,\" Jeffrey Chen wrote for Window to the Movies. \"Maybe the participants got something out of their systems, but the result just feels like hot air.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played Daryl Ward in \"Bright\" (2017).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 26%\n\nSummary: In a fantasy world where humans and mythical creatures live side by side, Daryl Ward (Smith) and his new orc partner, Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton), reluctantly pair up to solve a string of crimes in their city.\n\nCritics said \"Bright\" had its fingers in too many pots by trying to be a convincing fantasy film, comedy, and social drama.\n\n\"'Bright' is basically a tired buddy-cop movie dressed up in bizarre trappings,\" Richard Roeper wrote

35%\n\nSummary: A fish named Oscar (voiced by Smith) winds up in huge trouble when he spreads a lie about taking down a great white shark.\n\nSome critics saw \"Shark Tale\" as a fun, lighthearted

drugs.\n\nCritics said \"Bad Boys\" didn't offer too much in terms of a compelling story, but for some, it skated by on Smith and Lawrence's charm.\n\n\"The plot and characterization are largely irrelevant — just sit back and feast on the adrenaline-pumping action and the live-wire banter of the two stars,\" John Ferguson reviewed for Radio Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played an escaped slave in \"Emancipation\" (2022)\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 45%\n\nSummary: Set in Louisiana 1860s after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Smith plays a runaway slave who trudges through swamps trying to evade slave catchers.\n\nCritics felt the movie was too harrowing and felt it didn't bring anything new to a topic that had been displayed on the screen previously to high praise.\n\n\"There's a pronounced Hollywood-ized feel to the finished product, one that doesn't compare favorably with other projects that have covered similar territory,\" wrote CNN critic Brian Lowry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was Nicky in \"Focus\" (2015).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 56%\n\nSummary: After years apart, a con artist (Smith) is thrown off his game when his apprentice (Robbie)

'Aladdin' wasn't perfect, but nothing will ever live up to the classic '92 version,\" Aramide Tinubu wrote for Stylecaster. \"Still, if you have a kiddo, or if you're still a big kid at heart, we certainly recommend it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith played detective Del Spooner in \"I, Robot\" (2004).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 57%\n\nSummary: In 2035, detective Del Spooner (Smith) investigates a high-profile death and suspects that the victim's android assistant may be responsible.\n\n\"I, Robot\" received a mixed reception from critics, who enjoyed the summer blockbuster but wanted it to go
