        "text": "We're old enough now to look back at 25 years and go, well, who you spend your time with at work turns out to make up a very big part of the quality of your life. If you're really lucky, you love what you do, and you love who you work with, and as they say back home, “Ya nevah work anothah day in ya life!”\n\nObviously, I like Matt intensely. You can’t help but not; he’s got such a good disposition. And he’s also a good, solid, intelligent actor. He looks unmarked and all-American, and these were extremely important requisites for that character. In addition, whatever we were going to do for the part, I just had faith he would do it.\n\nHe’s not a golfer, and he had to learn how to be a golfer in a really short amount of time. I had faith Matt would do it because of the kind of guy he is and the pride he has in himself. Then, he was athletic. He’s a baseball player. Working with him was extremely comfortable because he’s very cooperative and he goes with you, but he’s not stupid. He’ll ask the right questions."
