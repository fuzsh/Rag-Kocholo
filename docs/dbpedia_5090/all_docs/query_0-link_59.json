The screenplay by Jeremy Leven is based on Steven Pressfield's 1995 book The Legend of Bagger Vance: A Novel of Golf and the Game of Life. The film is set in 1931 Georgia. It was the final film starring Jack Lemmon and Lane Smith.\n\nThe plot is loosely based on the Hindu sacred text the Bhagavad Gita. It depicts God, Krishna, tutoring a warrior-hero, Arjuna, played in the film by Smith and Damon. The film was criticized by several African American commentators and reviewers for employing the \"Magical Negro\" stereotype.[3]"
