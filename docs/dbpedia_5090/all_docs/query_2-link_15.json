        "text": "Anything Else\n\nRate Movie\n\n[Total: 4 Average: 2.3]\n\nDirected By: Woody Allen\n\nWritten By: Woody Allen\n\nRelease Date: September 19, 2003\n\nDomestic Distributor: DreamWorks\n\nCast: Woody Allen, Jason Biggs, Christina Ricci\n\nBox Office Info:\n\nBudget: $18 million Financed by: DreamWorks; VCL Film+Media Domestic Box Office: $3,212,310 Overseas Box Office: $10,372,765\n\nAnything Else was the third and final comedy film from Woody Allen’s three picture financing and distribution pact with DreamWorks. The mini-major handled domestic distribution and the German based VCL Film+Media co-financed and owned the overseas rights. The budget for Anything Else was $18 million.\n\nAfter DreamWorks suffered heavy losses from expensive box office flops like Almost Famous, The Legend Of Bagger Vance, Evolution and The Last Castle, the mini-major’s 2003 slate was a transitional year for DreamWorks. The studio released only six features (Biker Boyz, Old School, Head Of State, Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, Anything Else and House of Sand and Fog) all of which were modestly budgeted, but only Old School hit it big at the box office.\n\nSince Woody Allen’s previous two films (The Curse of the Jade Scorpion and Hollywood Ending) pulled in awful numbers in the US, DreamWorks made the decision to market the film without Allen’s name in commercials. This left the limited drawing power of Jason Biggs and Christina Ricci to pull in audiences and Anything Else was the lowest grossing of the three pictures.\n\nDreamWorks had low commercial expectations and booked Anything Else only moderately wide into 1,033 theaters. It bowed against Underworld, Secondhand Lions, The Fighting Temptations and Cold Creek Manor. Reviews were mixed to poor and it was dead on arrival with $1,673,125 — placing outside the top 10 at #12. Audiences gave the movie a toxic C- cinemascore and it sank 61.5% the following weekend to $644,826 and promptly lost most of its theater count. Anything Else closed its domestic run after only four weeks with $3,212,310.\n\nAnything Else was mostly a bust overseas, grossing just $10,372,765."
