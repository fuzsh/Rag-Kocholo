        "text": "Media Institution Research: DreamWorks\n\nDreamWorks SKG is one of the major American film studios which develops, produces, and distributes films, video games, and television programming. It has produced or distributed more than ten films with box office grosses totalling more than $100,000,000 and its most successful title.\n\nThe initials \"SKG\" stand for the company's co-founders, Spielberg (film director and founder of Amblin Entertainment), Katzenberg (former head of The Walt Disney Company's film studios), and Geffen (founder of Geffen Records).in December 2005, the founders agreed to sell the studio to Viacom, the parent company of Paramount Pictures. The sale was completed in February 2006.\n\nDreamWorks' animation started in 2004,(DreamWorks Animation SKG), which has remained independent and has not collabrated with Paramount/Viacom, however its films will be distributed worldwide by Paramount.\n\nThe company was founded following Katzenberg's forced resignation from The Walt Disney Company in 1994. At the suggestion of Spielberg's friend Robert Zemeckis, the two made an agreement with long-time Katzenberg collaborator Geffen to start their own studio. The studio was officially founded in October of 1994 with financial backing of $33 million from each of the three main partners and $500 million from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\n\nThe first feature length DreamWorks film to be released was The Peacemaker(1997).\n\nIn 1999, 2000 and 2001, DreamWorks won three consecutive best picture Oscars for American Beauty, Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind.\n\nDreamWorks Records never lived up to expectations, and was sold in October 2003 to Universal Music Group, which operated the label as DreamWorks Nashville. That label was shut down in 2005 when its flagship artist, Toby Keith, departed to form his own label.\n\nThe studio has had its greatest financial success with movies, specifically animated movies. DreamWorks Animation teamed up with Pacific Data Images (now known as PDI/DreamWorks) in 1996 to create some of highest grossing animated films of all time, such as Antz (1998), Shrek (2001), its sequel Shrek 2 (2004), Shark Tale (2004), Madagascar (2005) and Over the Hedge (2006).\n\nBased on their success, DreamWorks Animation has spun off as its own publicly traded company. In fact, PDI/DreamWorks has emerged as the main competitor to Pixar in the age of computer-generated animation, and is based in Redwood City, California.\n\nDreamWorks frequently co-financed and co-distributed films with other studios, including Columbia, Fox, Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros.With co-financing and co-distribution, one studio will release the film internationally and the other domestically.\n\nFive films with 20th Century Fox:\n\nWhat Lies Beneath, The Legend of Bagger Vance and Cast Away were released in 2000 , Minority Report and Road to Perdition were released in 2002\n\nFor 2000's Cast Away and 2002's Minority Report, Fox released the films in the U.S. and DreamWorks released them internationally. For the DVD release of Minority Report, Fox and DreamWorks switched regions, with DreamWorks releasing the DVD in the U.S., and Fox releasing it internationally.\n\nTen films with its current sister studio Paramount Pictures: Deep Impact, Saving Private Ryan, Paycheck, The Stepford Wives, Collateral, Lemon Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, War of the Worlds and the upcoming Dreamgirls, Transformers and Disturbia were made by DreamWorks and Paramount and released in 1998, and between 2003-2007. For 1998's Deep Impact, 2003's Paycheck, 2004's The Stepford Wives and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, and 2005's War of the Worlds, Paramount released the films in the U.S. and DreamWorks released them internationally; and for 1998's Saving Private Ryan, 2004's Collateral, 2006's Dreamgirls (set for release in December), and 2007's Transformers (to be released in July 2007) and Disturbia, DreamWorks released the films in the U.S. and Paramount released them internationally. For the DVD release of War of the Worlds, Paramount and DreamWorks switched regions, with DreamWorks releasing the DVD in the U.S., and Paramount releasing it internationally. Killing Pablo is also a Paramount/DreamWorks co-production, but the distribution areas have not been set. More Paramount/DreamWorks co-productions will be expected.\n\nEight films with Universal Studios: Small Soldiers, Gladiator, Meet the Parents, A Beautiful Mind, Seabiscuit, The Cat in the Hat, Meet the Fockers and Munich were made by DreamWorks and Universal and released in 1998 and between 2000-2005.\n\nFor 1998's Small Soldiers and 2000's Gladiator, DreamWorks released the films in the U.S. and Universal released them internationally. For 2000's Meet the Parents, 2001's A Beautiful Mind, 2003's The Cat in the Hat, 2004's Meet the Fockers and 2005's Munich, Universal released the films in the U.S. and DreamWorks released them internationally. For 2003's Seabiscuit, Universal released the film in the U.S., and international territory was split between DreamWorks and Buena Vista.\n\nFive films with Warner Bros:\n\nThe Time Machine,\n\nA.I.: Artificial Intelligence,\n\nThe Island and the upcoming Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima were made by DreamWorks and Warner Bros. and released between 2001-2006.\n\nThe former 2 films were released by Warner Bros. in the U.S. and DreamWorks internationally, and the latter 3 were/will be released by DreamWorks in the U.S. and Warner Bros. internationally. On DVD, DreamWorks released the former 3 films in the U.S., and Warner Bros. internationally.\n\nFive films with Columbia Pictures:\n\nAlmost Famous,\n\nAn Everlasting Piece,\n\nEvolution,\n\nEnvy and Memoirs of a Geisha were made by DreamWorks and Columbia and released between 2000-2005.\n\nFor Memoirs of a Geisha, Columbia released the film in the U.S., and DreamWorks and Buena Vista split international territory. For the other films, DreamWorks released the films in the U.S., and Columbia released them internationally.\n\nThe only major studios DreamWorks have not co-released movies with are Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Walt Disney Pictures.\n\nthis is not surprising, given Disney's hostile relations with DreamWorks co-founder Katzenberg: when Disneyâ€™s then-second in command, Frank Wells, died in a helicopter crash, CEO Michael Eisner refused to promote Katzenberg, firing him after he pushed the issue. Katzenberg then filed a lawsuit against Disney to recover money he felt he was owed and settled out of court for an estimated $100 - $250 million (the actual amount remains secret)."
