Something we was born with. Something that's ours and ours alone. Something that can't be learned -- something that's got to be remembered.\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"You wanna quit Mr. Junuh? You know you can just go ahead and creep off somewhere I'll tell folk you took sick -- Truth be told, ain't nobody gonna really object -- In fact, they'd probably be happy as bugs in a bake shop to see you pack up and go home --\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"You know I can't quit\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"I know -- Just makin sure you know it too --\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"Don't make no sense is all -- Man say he don't play no golf when he out here this shade of night hittin balls off in the dark where he can't even see 'em --\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"Yep -- Well, I've done things that have made less sense --\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"As we all have --\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"Yeah, I always felt a man's grip on his club just like a man's grip on his world --\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"I hear you lost your swing. I guess we got to go find it.\"\n\nMatt Damon as Rannulph Junuh\n\n(Matt Damon) \"I lost my swing Adele --\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"Really? Where'd it go?\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"Alright I'll play in your stupid golf tournament (to Adel) I shoulda' let you finish what you started, now I got nothin' at all to show for it.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"Interesting match.\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"I've always thought so.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"You a caddy?\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"Uh, that depends. You a golfer?\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"Is there something you want to tell me?\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"Well, I'm trying to think of how to say it, Junuh. There is a purpose to this visit -- and that's to apologize. But I'm not a naturally apologetic woman, so it takes me a little longer to get my thoughts in order.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"I could have killed you out there.\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"Oh no sir, see I set myself directly in front of ya. Judgin' how you were hittin' them balls that's where I figure I'd be out of harms way.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"This is getting embarassing.\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"Oh no sir, this has been embarassing for quite some time.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"What were you doing out there? I could have killed you.\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"Nah, actually, I positioned myself right in front of you, 'cause from the way your swings were goin', I figured that was the safest place.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"Grow up Hardy.\"\n\n(imdbname:0597670) \"It ain't time for me to grow up, Mr. Junuh.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"You're daddy is out sweeping streets because he took every last dime he had, and used it to pay up every man and woman he owed and every business who worked for him, instead of declaring bankruptcy like everyone else in town, including your best friend Wilbur Charles' dad, Raymond, which is why he's able to sit around all day long on his dignity. You're daddy stared adversity in the eye, Hardy. And he beat it back with a broom.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"What was it Adele? -- What did you like about us? --\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"I liked the way we danced --\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"I can win Adele -- I can beat both of 'em -- Look into my eyes and tell me what you see --\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"Determination -- Pure determination --\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"Panic, Adele -- Pure panic -- I'm eight strokes behind two of the greatest golfers in the sport, they've never blown a lead in their lives and I'm gonna win -- Ya know why?\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"Panic?\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"That's right --\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"Oh Junuh, you don't by any chance --\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"Yes --\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"Was there something about me that you particularly missed? Somethin that I can feel gratified about depriving you all these years?\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"I liked the way we danced --\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"You really love this game, don't you?\"\n\n(imdbname:0597670) \"It's the greatest game there is.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"You really think so?\"\n\n(imdbname:0597670) \"Ask anybody. It's fun. It's hard and you stand out there on that green, green grass, and it's just you and the ball and there ain't nobody to beat up on but yourself; just like Mister Newnan keeps hittin' himself with the golf club every time he gets angry. He's broken his toe three times on account of it. It's the only game I know that you can call a penalty on yourself, if you're honest, which most people are. There just ain't no other game like it.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"I can't do it, Bagger. It was too long ago.\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"No it wasn't. It was just a moment ago.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"This is getting embarrassing.\"\n\n(Will Smith) \"Oh no sir, this has been embarrassing for quite some time.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"I'm not asking for your crown, Walter. If I wanted it badly enough, I'd just take it.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"Now, the question on the table is how drunk is drunk enough? And the answer is that it's all a matter of brain cells\"\n\n(imdbname:0597670) \"Brain cells?\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"That's right Hardy. You see every drink of liquor you take kills a thousand brain cells. Now that doesn't much matter 'cos we got billions more. And first the sadness cells die so you smile real big. And then the quiet cells go so you just say everything real loud for no reason at all. That'ok, that's ok because the stupid cells go next, so everything you say is real smart. And finally, come the memory cells. These are tough sons of bitches to kill.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"You gonna hit the ball or you gonna dance with it?\"\n\nCharlize Theron as Adele Invergordon\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"Ten years and not one single, solitary word from you? You don't do that to someone you love. I deserve better, I deserve some correspondence of some indication of how you felt. Junuh, I don't know what happened to you -- but whatever it was -- it couldn't have been as unbearable as a woman waitin' with no end in sight -- Wonderin if she's, remembered or forgotton by the man she loves -- You never even said you were sorry -- And now I'm supposed to just run into your arms and melt like butter on a hot muffin?\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"I'm sorry Adele -- I am, truly sorry --\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"It's too late for 'I'm sorry' Junuh.\"\n\n(Matt Damon) \"But; Then; Well, tell me what to say -- It was too long ago --\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"No it wasn't -- It was just a moment ago --\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"Oh, Jesus. I've died and gone to hell.\"\n\n(Charlize Theron) \"And now I'm supposed to run into your arms and melt like butter on a hot muffin?\"\n\nBruce McGill as Walter Hagen\n\n(Bruce McGill) \"Hey, I admire the way you're dealing with this match, Junuh. Fighting the way you are. It's damn noble. But no matter how good a fighter you are, just remember, I can ask they King to gold the flag for me when I putt, but he's not going to give me his crown, neither is Bobby and neither am I.\"\n\nimdbname:0597670 as Hardy Greaves\n\n(imdbname:0597670) \"A terrific shot. But into the woods, goddammit. Goddammit. I spend more time in the trees than the squirrels do.\"\n\n(imdbname:0597670) \"God is happiest, when his children are at play.\"\n\n(imdbname:0597670) \"Confused, broken -- and unable to face a return to a hero's welcome -- Junuh just disappeared -- Hopin to forget -- and to be forgotton --\"\n\n(imdbname:0597670) \"I heard my dad say that you won every golf tournament there ever was in the South and how you hit a drive so long that they made you stop playin for 20 minutes just to measure it for a record -- and how you used to swing righty, but you were in the woods once by this tree so there was no room to swing righty -- so you borrowed somebody's lefty club and hit the ball six inches from the hole --\"\n\nAdd or Update Quotes\n\nIf you have a quote to add or change and want to let us know, please fill in the form below.
