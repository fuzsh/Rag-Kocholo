        "text": "ROBERT REDFORD decided to change the world in Buffalo.\n\nIt was the winter of 1970 and Mr. Redford, fresh from the box office success of ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' ran up against a wall that even his star power could not crack. ''I wanted to make a trilogy, in documentary style, about the American mythology of success,'' he recalled in an interview at the picturesque mountainside complex of the Sundance Institute during its summer Theater Laboratory. He managed to get Paramount to release the first installment, ''Downhill Racer,'' in which he starred as a headstrong Olympic skier. But against his wishes, the studio marketed the film as an action feature, then lost confidence and failed to back it with distribution and promotion. So Mr. Redford himself went on the road to promote it. ''Then one night I was snowed in in Buffalo and had dinner with a field representative. He finally said: 'Let me give you some advice. Forget it, kid -- the studio is dumping this film. I hate to see you chasing it. Let it go.' ''\n\nMr. Redford let it go, but he didn't forget. He has a personality that tends to shrug off frustration or criticism, but this was different. And as he recalled the episode, in the cozy confines of his cabinlike office near Sundance's rehearsal barn, the shock was still evident in his voice 30 years later. Indeed, for these last 30 years, he has been working to make sure Buffalo never happens again -- to him or to other filmmakers -- even if it means transforming every aspect of cinema, from writing and directing to production, distribution and the theater experience itself.\n\nThe vehicles he has created, the Sundance Institute, whose 20th anniversary will culminate in a New York benefit in April, and its most visible program, the Sundance Film Festival, which opens here on Thursday, link the scrappy world of independent filmmaking with the glittering industry of Hollywood. The Sundance operation has been more successful than Mr. Redford ever imagined -- grown into an enterprise so big, he said, ''I don't want to run it -- and never really did.'' Yet even as he attempts, at the age of 64, to revive an acting career too long neglected, he is forced to reckon with the possibility that history will remember him less for his own films than for those Sundance has made possible.\n\nBy now, anyone who has ever been to a film festival can recite the legend of Sundance: how Mr. Redford took the foundering United States Film Festival and in the mid 1980's moved it from Salt Lake City to Park City, Utah. It became a program of the Sundance Institute and was branded with the Sundance name in 1991. ''At first, I couldn't find enough decent films to show and I couldn't get anybody to come in off the street,'' Mr. Redford said. ''Now you can't walk down the streets during the festival.'' What happened, in 1989, was ''Sex, Lies and Videotape.'' Steven Soderbergh's steamy domestic tell-all initiated the Festival's almost talismanic status in the commercial film world. Before Sundance, no distributor would touch it. After its Sundance premiere, it became Hollywood's equivalent of the Holy Grail: a highbrow, low-budget smash.\n\nSince then, the festival has been a launching pad for directors from Quentin Tarantino to Kimberly Peirce and stars from Liv Tyler to Brad Pitt. ''Shine,'' ''Memento,'' ''Trainspotting'' and ''Brassed Off'' all had their premieres at Sundance. So did the current critical hit ''In the Bedroom.'' As the director Atom Egoyan remarked, ''It's become every filmmaker's fantasy: you go, you hit the jackpot, you get a big Hollywood deal.'' But even if the big deal proves elusive, at the very least the films actually get seen. Last year's hard-to-swallow political pill ''The Believer,'' about a budding neo-Nazi, has nearly made its way to commercial distribution (it is set for spring) after Sundance.\n\nBeyond its commercial clout, Sundance has helped change the look and feel of independent films. They are better produced, more culturally diverse and visually polished. As Mr. Redford said, ''Independent doesn't have to be a synonym for badly made.'' And the influences run both ways. Studio films like Mr. Soderbergh's own ''Traffic'' and Wes Anderson's ''Royal Tenenbaums'' display a distinctly indie attitude. Mr. Anderson developed his first film, ''Bottle Rocket,'' at the Sundance Institute. As the festival's co-director, Geoffrey Gilmore, pointed out, ''It's almost impossible to say just what an independent film is, and Sundance has had a lot to do with that.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
