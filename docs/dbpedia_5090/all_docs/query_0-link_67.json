        "text": "WHEN the Paramount Pictures unit of Viacom announced two months ago that it would acquire DreamWorks SKG for $1.6 billion, the deal was heralded as a \"coup\" and a \"fantasy come true\" by the news media and analysts alike.\n\nThe combination of Sumner M. Redstone of Viacom, Brad Grey of Paramount and the triumvirate of David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg at DreamWorks made it seem as if the company should be renamed DreamTeam.\n\nIt is too bad that so many investors and analysts became star-struck, because they appear to have overlooked doing any real analysis of the transaction. If they had, they might have come to this conclusion: Mr. Geffen, a master negotiator, twisted Viacom into overpaying so much for the deal -- outbidding General Electric's Universal -- that the producers of the bloated box-office flop \"Waterworld\" may start to look smart.\n\nThis may all become apparent in the next couple of weeks, or possibly sooner, as Paramount nears a deal to offload DreamWorks' movie library to a group of private equity investors led by George Soros, according to people involved in the talks.\n\nThat deal, for about $800 million to $900 million, would mean that Paramount would rid itself of DreamWorks' paltry movie library of 59 films -- a smattering of hits like \"Gladiator\" and its flops like \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" (don't worry if you can't remember that one) -- and use the proceeds to pay off the cost of the original deal. That would bring the final tally down to about $700 million or $800 million.\n\nThat may sound good -- it clearly is better than $1.6 billion -- but then start thinking about what it is that Paramount is acquiring. The answer is not much, except perhaps the most expensive production deal in Hollywood history.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
