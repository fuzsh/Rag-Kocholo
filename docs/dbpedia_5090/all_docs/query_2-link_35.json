        "text": "Steven Pressfield and Shawn Coyne are strong believers in beating resistance and chasing crazy ideas. Whether it involves writing about something completely foreign to you or something too edgy for commercial readers, both agree that sticking with your most outlandish ideas will lead to better, more fulfilling writing. Pressfield and Coyne are both masterful bestselling authors. Pressfield is most-known for The Legend of Bagger Vance, a compelling sports mystery that was adapted into a film featuring Will Smith and Matt Damon. Coyne is most-known for Story Grid, a revolutionary editing tool and writing group that has helped writers around the world produce better content.\n\nFrom Amazon.com:\n\nSteven Pressfield is the author of The Legend of Bagger Vance, Gates of Fire, Tides of War, Last of the Amazons, Virtues of War, The Afghan Campaign, Killing Rommel, The Profession, The Lion’s Gate, The War of Art, Turning Pro, Do the Work, The Warrior Ethos, The Authentic Swing, An American Jew, Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t, The Knowledge, and The Artist’s Journey.\n\nFrom StoryGrid.com:\n\nI (Shawn Coyne) have been in the publishing industry for thirty years now, twenty-five of which were spent working as an editor at the Big Five publishing houses, as an independent publisher, as a literary agent both at a major Hollywood talent agency and as the head of Genre Management Inc. In early 2015, I published The Story Grid: What Good Editors Know, and later that year I started the Story Grid Podcast with writer, and book marketing expert, Tim Grahl. The rest is history. We now have 45 Certified Story Grid Editors, 3 podcasts, a blog rich with story resources, a suite of courses and a community that continues to grow.\n\nWhether you’re traditionally published or indie, writing a good book is only the first step in becoming a successful author. The days of just turning a manuscript into your editor and walking away are gone. If you want to succeed in today’s publishing world, you need to understand every aspect of the business – editing, formatting, marketing, contracts. It all starts with a good book, then the real work begins.\n\nJoin international bestselling author J.D. Barker and indie powerhouse, J. Thorn, as they gain unique insight and valuable advice from the most prolific and accomplished authors in the business.\n\nIn this episode, you’ll discover:\n\nHow to determine if an idea is crazy\n\nWhy to pick the idea you’re most afraid of\n\nHow to make difficult creative decisions\n\nThe importance of a day-by-day approach to projects\n\nHow to accept failure\n\nLinks:\n\nJ.
