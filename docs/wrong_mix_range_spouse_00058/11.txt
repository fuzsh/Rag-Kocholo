The ACSI Day of Prayer is an annual event that advances Christ-centered education by advocating through prayer. These past few school years have presented many unique challenges, but God has given our school communities the strength to overcome adversities and pursue new opportunities. We encourage you to join ACSI when we unite across the globe to pray for Christ-centered education next year on Tuesday, March 4, 2025.
