        "text": "In recognition of superior scholarship, Longwood is proud to announce its President’s and Dean’s lists for the 2018 spring semester. These achievements acknowledge many hours of hard work and unfailing dedication to academic excellence. Many students have earned this academic distinction while holding leadership positions in clubs and organizations and remaining active in other aspects of campus and community life. We are honored to celebrate these achievements and commitment to scholarship and citizen leadership.\n\nStudents earning President’s List honors have earned a semester grade-point average of 4.00, and those earning Dean's List honors have earned a semester grade-point average of 3.5 - 3.99. Recognition for both lists requires a minimum 12 semester hours of course work.\n\n*denotes members of the Cormier Honors College for Citizen Scholars\n\nClick on the student's name to view and share.\n\nReset Filters"
