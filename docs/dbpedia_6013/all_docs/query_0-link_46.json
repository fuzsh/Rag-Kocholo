She also suggested that it would be possible for Computers to do more than simple calculations,perhaps even write music.'), (2, 'In 1936 Mary Cartwrigt became direct of studies in Mathematics at GgirtonCollege, Cambridge. Working with Littlewood, and found solutions to problems differential equations that emerged when modelling radio and RADAR signals.These observations would later contribute to Chaos Theory.She was the first woman: to receive the Sylvester Medal, to serve on the Council of the Royal Society, to be President of the Mathematical Association, and to be President of the London Mathematical Society.'), (3, 'Rosalind Franklin graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1492, with a degree in Natural Sciences. In 1942 she worked for The British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) where she discovered the link between the molecular structure of various types of coal and their physical properties, thus improving selection process for types of coal (i.e. for fuel and gas masks).She was later awarded a PhD from Cambridge for this work. Her work on coal included the refining of X-ray crystallography techniques that she later applied to DNA, identifying 2 types of DNA and noting the helix like structure of one of them in 1951, 2 years before Watson and Crick started work on their Double Helix Model.'), (4, 'In 1899 Hertha Ayrton became the first woman to present her own paper in front of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) onthe interaction of oxygen and carbon rods in arc lighting, shortly after becoming the first female member of the IEE.In 1901 the Royal Society refused to let her read her follow up paper ''The Mechanism of the Electric Arc'', instead being presented by John Perry. Similarly, in Cambridge she passed the Mathematical Tripos exambut was not allowed to be awarded a degree, as shewas a woman.'), (5, 'Dorothy Hodgkin was the third woman to win a Noble prize in Chemistry (previous two being Maria Skłodowska-Curie in 1911 and Irène Joliot-Curie in 1935) for her determinations by X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical substances. She confirmed the structure of penicillin and discovered the structures of Vitamin B12 and Insulin. She was aFellow of the Royal Society and President of the International Union of Crystallography.'), (6, 'Hypatia is the earliest female mathematician whose life is reasonably well documented. She was born between 350 and 370 AD and lived her life in Hellenised Egypt. She was regarded as the leading mathematician and astronomer in the known world during her lifetime, and taught many of the leading philosophers and mathematicians in the Greek Empire. She continued her father''s work in preserving older Greek science texts and updating many of them by correcting mathematical models. She is also the last attested member of the Alexandrian Museum. Her commentaries on Greek scientific works would be used by Scientists, including Ibn Sina, Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, and Abu al-Wafa Buzjani during the Abbasid Empire.'), (7, 'Known as much for her Philosophy as for her science, Émilie du Châtelet was one of the key figures in theFrench Enlightenment. Widely known for her translation into French of Isaac Newton''s Principia (still used as the standard French translation and seen by many as the completion of the scientific revolution), her commentary on the work included notion of conservation of energy derived from the principles of mechanics Newton set forth. She advocated that energy was distinct from momentum and established the basis for Kinetic Energy, which was later formalised by Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. In other work she predicted infrared rational and the nature of light.'), (8, 'marie-Sophie was a French Mathematician. She began a correspondence with Adrien-Marie Legendre under the pseudonym male M Le Blanc, fearful of the attitude to society to female scientists. Legendre was impressed with Marie-Sophies work and requested a meeting, in which she relieved herself as a woman. Legendre became her mentor, later citing her work on Number Theoryas \"very ingenious\".She later corresponded with Carl Friedrich Gauss, again under a male pseudonym. After finding out her true identity, Gauss wrote about Marie-Sophie that she was of noble courage, extraordinary talent and superior genius, recommending her for an honorary degree for her work. Marie-Sophie made significant contributions to number theory, Fermats last theorem and elasticity theory.'), (9, 'irène Joliot-Curie, daughter of Marie Curie, won the Noble Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of artificial radioactivity.Alongside her husband, she identified the positron and neutron, discovered an the accurate weight of the neutron, and pioneered the work into nuclear fission. She worked on Frances first nuclear reactor.'), (10, 'yvonne Choquet-Bruhat was a French mathematician and physicist. She worked with Albert Einstein and proved the local existence and uniqueness of the vacuum Einstein equations, which began the field of study in dynamics in General Relativity. She showed that there were solutions to the Yang-Mills, Higgs, and Spinor Field Equations in 3+1 Dimensions, and pioneered the work on supergravity which is integral to 11 Dimensional models of the universe.'), (11, 'described as ''the most significant creative mathematical genius thus far produced'' by Albert Einstein. Emmy Noether was a mathematician whose work showing how the laws of conservation were derived from the laws of symmetry solved a problem withEinstein’s maths in the theory of relativity. She created the theoretical groundwork for the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Born 1882 in Germany, Noether died in 1935 aged 53.'), (12, 'Nominated 3 times for a Nobel prize in Chemistry (1933, 1935, and 1937) for the discovery of rhenium and masurium, Ida Noddack was a German physicist and Chemist. Her work investigating and refutingEnrico Fermis chemical proofs in 1934, instead stating that the breakdown of elements into non-neighbouring elements. While her work was dismissed at the time, work by Irène Joliot-Curie, Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Pavle Savić, and later byOtto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, showed her hypothesis to be correct, leading to the discovery of nuclear fission.'), (13, 'maria goeppert Mayer was a German theoretical physicist that worked on the Manhattan Project with Edward Teller. Her doctoral work looked at the possibility of two-photon absorption by atoms, the standard unit of which is now named after her. She was awarded a Noble Prize in Physics for her model on the structure of nuclear shells, a prize she shared with Johannes Hans Daniel Jensen and Eugene Wigner.'), (14, 'maria agnesi was the first woman to publish an original mathematics book in her own name, others having previously done commentaries correcting previous work, and the first woman appoints as a mathematics professor at a university in 1750, a role she was given by Pope Benedict XIV.Her book Analytical Institutions for the Use of Italian Youth was regarded as the best introduction to Euler, covering both differential and integral calculus.'), (15, 'fumiko yonezawa was a Japanese theoretical physicist. She created computer visualisation of the amorphous structures of semiconductors and liquid metals. In 1996 she became the first female President of the Physics Society of Japan, and was awarded the Saruhasi Prize and a L-Oréal-UNESCO Award for Women in Science.'), (16, 'Marie curie was the first woman to win a Noble Prize (1903), and one of only 4 people to win two Noble prizes. Born In Poland, Marie moved to Paris for an undergraduate degree inphysics, chemistry, and mathematics, later doing a PhD. Marie established the foundation for our current Theory of Radioactivity. She discovered two new elements (Radium and Polonium) and pioneered work into radiotheopy for cancer. She was overlooked by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the Nobel Prize in Physics, initially naming only her husband Pierre Curie and fellow physicist Henri Becquerel. Magnus Goesta Mittag-Leffler, a committee member, notified Pierre of Maire not being on the nomination paper. Pierre complained to the commiette and had Marie added to the nomination papers.'), (17, 'Julia lermontova was a Russian chemist. She is known as the first Russian female doctor in chemistry, and the third woman to have been given a doctorate in Europe. She studied at the Universities of Heidelberg and Berlin before she received her doctorate by the University of Göttingen in 1874. She was inducted to the Russian Chemical Society in 1875. Her research included work on2-methyl-2-butenoic acid, she was the first woman to work in the field of oil research where she developed a device for the continuous distillation of petroleum, she worked on a new method of synthesizing hydrocarbons later used in the production of motor fuels.This process is now known as theButlerov–Eltekov–Lermontova''s reaction. When Eltekov presented the work at the 1878 coference of te Russiann Cheical Society, Butlerov made the attendees aware of Julias work on the project.'), (18, 'Mileva marić einstein was a Serbian Physicist, mathematician, and first wife of Albert Einstien.She attended Zurich Polytechnic alongside her future husband, but was denied her diploma. She is currently the subject on on-going debate on how much she worked with Einstien during 1905, a year sometimes refered to as Einstiens Miracle year, and how much she supported his work during their marriage. In letters between them, Albert refered to ''our'' theory of relative motion on several occasions and there are several reports of her correcting his papers before being submitted for publication.'), (19, 'Sophia brahe, 1559 - 1643, was a Danish noble woman and horticulturalist with knowledge of astronomy, chemistry, and medicine. She assisted her brother Tycho Brahe with his astronomical observations. The work that Sophia aided her brother in is now seen as the basis of modern orbit predictions of the planets and solar system.Tycho and Sophia collected the most accurate measurements to date (prior to the telescope invention) of the positions of the planets with respect to time. The siblings observedSN 1572, Tychos Supernova, leading many to realise that the earth was not the centre of the universe. Her work was funded by Frederick The Great of Prussia, and data passed onto Johannes Kepler and lay the groundwork of Isaac Newton.'), (20, 'In 1773 maria christina Bruhn entered a competition, commissioned by the Swedish Army and King Gustav III, into the creation of moister- and fire-proof storage canisters for artillery shells. During the 1774 testing, all prototypes were rejected as non-suitable. Maria reported her work to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences(KVA) and applied to various types of cardboard. She continued testing canisters with the Swedish Cadet Force until 1780. In 1783 she was informed that her work had been claimed by a Major Wagenfelt, who had attended the 1774 test. Supported by Captain Adolf Fredrik Lindfeldt, the KVA, and the Swedish Kings Council, Bruhn petitioned the Swedish College of War and in 1786 they awarded her the prize and recognition for inventing safe canisters.'), (21, 'Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language based on her idea that code could be written in English words. Prior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College.Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees. She is often accredited with the popularising of the term \"debugging\" in regards to computers, and has a Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer named after her.'), (22, 'Stephanie Kwolek worked for the DuPont company between 1946 and 1986, where she discovered the first synthetic fibre of exceptional strength and stiffness named poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide, more commonly known as Kevlar.
