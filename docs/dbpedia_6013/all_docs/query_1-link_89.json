        "text": "Jane Colden (1724-1766)\n\nI married late.\n\nBefore walking down the aisle\n\nat the advanced age of 35,\n\nI mastered plant classification and\n\nmade hundreds of specimen drawings.\n\nI wrote down all the names,\n\nall the versions of all the names.\n\nMy botanical work was not done\n\nwhen I donned the wedding veil, nor\n\nwhen I birthed a child.\n\nMy work was not done.\n\nI was not done.\n\nBut I was done for,\n\nand everything ended.\n\nLaura Hecox (1854-1919)\n\nIt wasn't a terrifically tall lighthouse,\n\nnot like the ones up and down the coast,\n\nbut it was my lighthouse, and I\n\nfilled it with fossils, shells, bones,\n\nantimony, cinnabar, quartz,\n\nthe tiny eggs of violet-green swallows\n\n(Tachycieneta thalassina),\n\na taxidermied parrot.\n\nMy job was keeping—\n\nkeeping the light on,\n\nkeeping the sailors safe,\n\nand collecting, a form\n\nof keeping, but also\n\na form of sharing.\n\nI kept the museum,\n\nkept track of everything,\n\nidentified all the specimens,\n\nwrote all the labels,\n\nkept myself from loneliness,\n\nkept myself in groceries and home.\n\nFlemmie Pansy Kittrell (1904-1980)\n\nHoward University lured me,\n\npromising a new Home Ec building,\n\nbut academia has slow metabolism.\n\nI've always said prejudice is\n\nhaving your thoughts too soon.\n\nI spent my whole career fighting\n\nthat kind of snap judgment. So maybe\n\nit's all right I never worked in the\n\nbuilding they promised. They did,\n\neventually, build it, after I\n\nretired and moved away.\n\nIf not for me there'd be no place\n\nfor the galoshes and the zippers.\n\nThe crayons, the dress-up bin,\n\nthe nap mats, the small chairs, and yes,\n\neven books, lots and lots of picture books, and\n\nthe children themselves, and the mothers and fathers\n\nand grandparents and teachers and families and all that love.\n\nYvonne Choquet-Bruhat (b. 1923)\n\nI call myself mathematicienne, lady scientist.\n\nThe universe is strange. We can never understand it.\n\nThese statements are bundled together like veins.\n\nAs a child, I felt the strangeness. I still do.\n\nWhy don't we experience any consciousness\n\nother than our own? I really want to know.\n\nI've tried, but I can't design an experiment\n\nverifying that I am I and not you, that\n\nyou are you and not I, that we didn't write\n\nthis cosmology we are unable to unravel.\n\nMargaret Kivelson (b. 1928)\n\nIf you are a) a woman scientist and\n\nb) still alive, it stands to reason\n\nthat when the New York Times profiles you,\n\nyou seem to have no flaws.\n\nObstacles, sure. Quirks. Maybe you even\n\n(gasp) cut your hair short.\n\nWhen you talk to students you are,\n\napparently, \"never antagonistic.\"\n\nWhen you posed with 33 other scientists\n\nin 1964, yours were the only bare legs,\n\nthe only feet in high-heeled shoes.\n\nI'm sure you were charming.\n\nYou had to be. It was required.\n\nYour delightfulness was mandatory.\n\nWithout it, they would have called you\n\na bitch, or worse.\n\nReading this article about you, I long\n\nfor... I don't know what.\n\nDo I really want news stories\n\nabout horribly mean lady scientists?\n\nAbout crazy, cruel, selfish women,\n\nwhose children hate their guts?\n\nNo. There's not even a poem here.\n\nJust a blast of inarticulate rage and sorrow\n\nabout the unfairness of it all.\n\nRadcliffe had no faculty of its own\n\nwhen you were there in the 1950s.\n\nHarvard professors delivered their lectures\n\ntwice. First to 400 male students, then again\n\nto ten women.\n\nUntil the professors' time became too valuable.\n\nBecause it was better for the professors,\n\nfemale students were allowed to join\n\ntheir male classmates for lectures.\n\nYou are still alive and doing science.\n\nAt no point have you gone on a perfectly reasonable\n\nmurder spree or screamed until your lungs\n\ngave out. No, you joke around. You invite\n\nyour students over for dinner and haven't poisoned\n\neven one."
