        "text": "Important Contributions:\n\nShe applied fundamental mathematical results to provide a firm basis for the solutions of the classical field equations of physics, most importantly those of general relativity and other theories of gravitation, supergravity, and the non-Abelian gauge theories of the standard model.\n\nSome Important Publications:\n\n\"Theoreme d'Existence pour Certains Systemes d'Equations aux Derivees Partielles non Lineaires,\" Acta Mathematica, 88: 141 (1952)\n\nThis is the author's (French) thesis, a magisterial work. It exhaustively discusses the Cauchy problem for a system of second order partial differential equations, linear in second derivatives, having special relevance to the Einstein equations in general relativity. The list of results is lengthy and includes deep result on exterior solutions and their uniqueness, on propagation velocity of gravitational excitations, etc.\n\n\"Theoremes d'Existence en Mecanique des Fluides Relativistes,\" Bulletin de la Soc. Math. de France, 86: 155 (1958)\n\nThe first careful study of existence theorems for non-analytic solutions of the Einstein equations with various types of matter including Kaluza-Klein unified, 5-dimensional, extensions. It established that these general cases define hyperbolic systems with well-defined Cauchy problem.\n\n\"Ondes Asymptotiques et Approchees pour des Systemes d'Equations aux Derivees Partielles non Lineaires,\" J. Maths. Pures et App. 48: 117 (1969)\n\nA general method is presented that enable one to construct asymptotic and approximate wave solutions about a given solution for nonlinear system of equations; this extends important earlier work, and also shows when the Cauchy problem becomes ill-posed. Applications are made to gravity.\n\n\"Global Solutions of the Problem of Constraints on a Closed Manifold,\" Symposia Matematica, (in the series Pubblicazione dell'Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica) 12: 317 (1973)\n\nThe problem of existence and uniqueness of global solutions of the constraint equations of general relativity is studied in the important case of a closed manifold, using general elliptic equation methods. The essential results are that existence depends on delicate properties of the manifold and on the sources of the metric; the various cases are carefully classified.\n\n\"Existence of Global Solutions of the Yang-Mills, Higgs, and Spinor Field Equations in 3+1 Dimensions,\" (with D. Christodoulou) Ann. E.N.S. 4th Series 14: 481 (1981)\n\n\"Causalite des Theories de Supergravite,\" Societe Mathematique de France, Asterisque 79-93 (1984)\n\nThis is perhaps the first study by a mathematician of supergravity, the generalization of Einstein theory unified, by a Grassmannian gauge invariance, with a massles spin 3/2 fermionic field. In particular, the author extends to supergravity the classic causality theorems that hold in the purely geometric bosonic theory. The results are extended both to N>1 supergravitie and to higher dimensions, in particular to the currently important maximal D=11 model.\n\nAn important text and reference book:\n\nAnalysis, Manifolds and Physics (co-authored with C. DeWitt-Morette and M. Dillard-Bleick), North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam 1977 (revised edition 1982) ; 2 volumes.\n\nHonors:\n\nM�daille d'Argent du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1958\n\nPrix Henri de Parville of the Academie des Sciences, 1963\n\nMember, Acad�mie des Sciences, Paris (elected 1979)\n\nElected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 1985\n\nCommandeur de la L�gion d'honneur, 1997\n\nJobs/Positions:\n\n1949-51 Research Assistant/Associate, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique\n\n1951-52 Member, Institute for Advance Study, Princeton\n\n1953-58 Professor, Faculte des Sciences de Marseille\n\n1958-59 Professor, Universite de Reims\n\n1960- Professeur Titulaire, Faculte des Sciences de Paris and l'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie\n\nEducation:\n\nAgr�g�e de math�matiques, Ecole normale sup�rieure de S�vres 1946\n\nDocteur �s sciences, Ecole normale sup�rieure de S�vres 1951\n\nSources and References consulted:\n\nProfessor Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat, Professor Stanley Deser, [wwf1995], Association for Women in Mathematics Website\n\nAdditional Information/Comments:\n\nShe has more than 190 published papers on mathematics and mathematical physics.\n\nHer father, Georges Bruhat, was professor of physics at the Sorbonne.\n\nMarried to Gustave Choquet with whom she has two children, Geneviève and Daniel; and a third from a previous marriage, Michelle Fourès.\n\nHer recreations include walking and cycling.\n\nField Editor: Professor Stanley Deser\n\n<DESER@BINAH.CC.BRANDEIS.EDU>"
