        "text": "Habemus the first woman member of the French Academy of Sciences or dum vita est, spes est! Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat is an internationally recognized French mathematician and physicist. She is known for her research at the border of mathematics and physics, ranging from the first mathematical proof of the existence of solutions to Einstein’s theory of general relativity to the conversion of electromagnetic waves into gravitational waves (or vice versa) near a black hole. Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat developed new mathematical methods that provided a solid foundation for analyzing several physical theories, including the theory of general relativity, the non-Abelian gauge theory of the standard model, relativistic hydrodynamics, and the theory of supergravity. Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat performed pioneering research on the initial value problem of general relativity. Her exceptional work in this field was highlighted as one of the “milestones of general relativity”.\n\nYvonne Choquet-Bruhat, a universal scientist, gained her fame through patience, sacrifice, hard work, and only by merit of her own strengths. She is defined by high standards of honor. Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat is a model for women scientists and accomplished women, in general.\n\nAd honorem, the celebration of the 350th anniversary (1666–2016) of the French Academy of Science provides us with the opportunity to remember Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat. She is a trailblazer for women in science!\n\n1 Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat's education: a hymn to life\n\nO life as one ode to joy! In 1923, the great soprano Maria Callas was born, and the great musician George Enescu became the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra. W. Rontgen, J. D. van der Waals, J. Dewar and G. Eiffel died in 1923, and several notable scientists were born in the same year, including P. W. Anderson (Nobel Laureate in Physics, 1977), D. C. Gajdusek (Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, 1976), A. Carlsson (Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, 2000), W. Kohn (Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, 1998), R. Marcus (Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, 1992), V. L. Fitch (Nobel Laureate in Physics, 1980), J. Kilby (Nobel Laureate in Physics, 2000), the French physicist C. Bloch, and the great mathematicians H. Cabannes, R. Thom (Fields Medal, 1958), G. Kreisel, R. Bott, H. Chandra, and F. Dyson.\n\nYvonne Suzanne Marie Louise Choquet-Bruhat was born on 29 December 1923, in Lille. She was born into a family of French intellectuals; she was the daughter of Berthe Hubert Bruhat, a philosophy professor, and Georges Bruhat, a prominent physics professor at the Faculty of Science in Paris. Choquet-Bruhat’s brother was the mathematician François Bruhat (born in 1929). Her father George was awarded his doctorate in physics in 1914. He was appointed to the University of Lille in 1919 and then promoted to professor of physics in 1921. Her mother, Berthe Hubert Bruhat, was ranked first in the ‘concours de l’agrégation’ in arts in 1917. In 1927, her father was appointed to the Faculty of Science in Paris, and the girl moved to Paris with her family. Georges Bruhat was appointed to deputy director of the ‘École normale supérieure’ in 1935 and then to the physics chair at the school in 1941.\n\nLabor is the source of virtue. – Herder\n\nYvonne Choquet-Bruhat attended secondary school in Paris and obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1941. She won the second prize in physics in open competition and used her prize to attend the ‘École normale supérieure’ in Sèvres (for girls only), just outside Paris. This women’s university was the partner institution of the ‘École normale supérieure de Paris’. She graduated from the ‘École normale supérieure de jeunes filles’ in 1946 and performed research with André Lichnerowicz (who later became her doctoral thesis supervisor). She studied with great teachers, including Georges Darmois and Jean Leray, and began to teach at the ‘École normale supérieure’ in 1946, after she achieved first place on the mathematics aggregation examination. From 1946 to 1949, Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat was an assistant at the ‘École normale supérieure’. From 1949 to 1951, she was a research assistant and then a research associate at the ‘Centre national de la recherche scientifique ‘(CNRS). She was awarded her doctorate in 1951 for her thesis Théorème d’existence pour certains systèmes d’équations aux dérivées partielles non linéaires. Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat then completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton between 1951 and 1952. In 1953, she became a lecturer at the Faculty of Science in Marseilles. Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat soon returned to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton during the 1955–1956 academic year. Between 1958 and 1959, she served as a professor at the ‘École des sciences de Reims’. In 1960, she was appointed to the analytical mechanics and celestial mechanics chair of the Faculty of Science in Paris. In 1971, the Faculty of Science was dismantled, and Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat moved to the Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University, where she remained until her retirement in 1992. She has been professor emeritus since then.\n\n1.1 Alta alatis patent\n\nYvonne Choquet-Bruhat has received many honors for her contributions to mathematical physics. In 1958, she was awarded the Silver Medal by the CNRS. She was awarded the Henri-de-Parville Prize by the Academy of Sciences in 1963. Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences in 1978, and in 1979 she became the first full woman member – ad vitam æternam! From 1980 to 1983, she was president of the International Committee of General Relativity and Gravitation. In 1985, she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The National Order of the Legion of Honour recognized Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat for her accomplishments by appointing her to Commander in 1997 and subsequently elevating her to Grand Officer in 2008 and Grand Cross in 2015. In 2003, she and James York of Cornell University shared the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics. She is also a member of the Moscow Mathematical Society. In 2006, Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat delivered the Emmy Noether Lecture on the topic of “Mathematical problems in general relativity” at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid (she also gave the Emmy Noether Lecture in 1986).\n\n1.2 Amor mundum fecit\n\nYvonne Choquet-Bruhat had one daughter, Michelle, with her first husband, Léonce Fourès. She later married Gustave Choquet and had two children, Geneviève and Daniel, with him.\n\n2 Research accomplishments\n\nIt is the theory that decides what we can observe. – Einstein\n\nYvonne Choquet-Bruhat’s research interests in the field of mathematical physics include partial differential equations on manifolds and their application to fundamental physics problems in the areas of general relativity, relativistic fluids, magneto fluids and plasmas, supergravity, and gauge theories. Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat essentially invented the field of mathematical general relativity. The study of gravity has fascinated the scientist and the philosophers such as Liiceanu, who wrote about gravitational freedom. Although several explicit solutions of the Einstein gravitational field equations were found before Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat’s work, it was only after her proof that Einstein’s equations were well-posed in 1952 that general relativity became a topic of serious mathematical interest. In mathematical general relativity, Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat made groundbreaking advances in solving the Einstein constraint equations and analyzing the evolution of initial data into space-time solutions of the Einstein field equations. Key aspects of her work include developing new mathematical tools and novel approaches for applying them to problems of interest. In addition, she introduced new formulations of Einstein’s theory of gravitation that recently spurred great progress in numerical relativity, including the calculation of the gravitational waves emitted when two black holes collapse and merge together. These results are of great importance for giant interferometric gravitational wave detectors, such as Virgo or LIGO.\n\nThe man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones. – Confucius\n\nIn a seminal work published as her ‘thèse d’État’ when she was 28 years old, Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat showed that if the initial state of a gravitational field is represented by certain geometric fields that satisfy the constraint equations, then a space-time solution of the complete system of Einstein’s equations exists. This solution is compatible with the initial state data set and describes the past and future of the gravitational field. Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat used fundamental mathematical results to provide a solid foundation for solving classical physics equations, most importantly those pertaining to general relativity and other theories of gravity, supergravity, and non-Abelian gauge theories of the standard model.\n\nYvonne Choquet-Bruhat is widely acclaimed both in France and worldwide as an author of scientific papers. In concreto, she has published well over 200 research papers and three major research books. She has presented at several conferences and invited lectures at both national and international congresses.\n\nHer career has consisted of many remarkable achievements. She is an inspiring teacher and a remarkable woman of science with an extraordinary gift for logical reflection. All who worked with Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat have been attracted by his genial and kind personality, and none failed to be impressed by her intellect and by the high, almost exacting, standards he set for scientific work.\n\nIn his chosen field of research, Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat is preeminent and has established a tradition that will not be easily upheld. Through her work, she is assured of a worthy place in the history of the science to which he was devoted. Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat has proven that all boundaries can be broken by the desire to succeed.\n\nI love those who yearn for the impossible. – Goethe\n\nYvonne Choquet-Bruhat, the first woman elected to the French Academy of Sciences, is the symbol of women in science.\n\nFecheteIoanaifechete@unistra.fri_fechete@yahoo.com Institut de chimie et procedes pour l'energie, l'environnement, et la sante (ICPEES), UMR 7515 CNRS, Universite de Strasbourg, 25, rue Becquerel, 67087 Strasbourg cedex 2, FranceInstitut de chimie et procedes pour l'energie, l'environnement, et la sante (ICPEES)UMR 7515 CNRSUniversite de Strasbourg25, rue BecquerelStrasbourg cedex 267087France\n\nDecember\n\nDECEMBERMEMBERS OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES1Gallet, Jean Charles (1 December 1637 – 19 March 1713), French intellectual.Salvador y Riera, Juan (1 December 1683 – 27 February 1726), Spanish botanist.Klaproth, Martin Heinrich (1 December 1743 – 1 January 1817), German chemist.Mudge, William (1 December 1762 – 17 April 1820), English artillery officer.Imbeaux, Charles Édouard Augustin (1 December 1861 – 25 June 1953), French engineer and medical doctor.Brézin, Édouard (1 December 1938), French physicist.Flajolet, Philippe (1 December 1948 – 22 March 2011), French computer scientist2Carcani, Nicola Maria (2 December 1716 – 27 July 1764), Italian intellectual.Le Blond, Jean-Baptiste (2 December 1747 – 14 August 1815), French medical doctor.Smith, James Edward (2 December 1759 – 17 March 1828), British botanist.d'Alcantara, Pedro II (2 December 1825 – 5 December 1891), the last ruler of the Empire of Brazil.Ollier, Louis Xavier Édouard Léopold (2 December 1830 – 2 November 1900), French surgeon.Hautefeuille, Paul (2 December 1836 – 8 December 1902), French chemist.Maquenne, Léon Gervais Marie (2 December 1853 – 19 January 1925), French chemist.3Crova, André Prosper Paul (3 December 1833 – 21 June 1907), French chemist.Millardet, Pierre Marie Alexis (3 December 1838 – 14 December 1902), French botanist.Siegbahn, Karl Manne Georg (3 December 1886 – 26 September 1978), Swedish physicist and Nobel laureate (1924).4Seignette, Pierre (4 December 1660 – 11 March 1709), French medical doctor.Pérez, Jean (4 December 1833 – 11 September 1914), French zoologist.Lannelongue, Odilon Marc (4 December 1840 – 22 December 1911), French surgeon.Pardé, Maurice Édmond (4 December 1893 – 14 June 1973), French scientist.Sajus, Lucien (4 December 1935 – 4 December 2002), French engineer.Fayet, Pierre (4 December 1949), French physicist.5Painlevé, Paul (5 December 1863 – 29 October 1933), French mathematician.Grégoire, Victor Marie Joseph Théodore (5 December 1870 – 12 December 1938), Belgian botanist.6Malesherbes, Chrétien-Guillaume de Lamoignon de (6 December 1721 – 22 April 1794), French botanist.Joubert, Philippe Laurent de (6 December 1729 – 1792), French intellectual.Lamanon, Jean-Honoré Robert de Paul de (6 December 1752 – 11 December 1787), French botanist.Gay-Lussac, Louis Joseph (6 December 1778 – 9 May 1850), French chemist and physicist.Vaillant, Jean Baptiste Philibert (6 December 1790 – 4 June 1872), Marshal of France.Magnéli, Arne Per (6 December 1914 – 25 July 1996), Swedish chemist.7Thevenard, Antoine-Jean-Marie [comte] (7 December 1733 – 9 February 1815), French politician.Silvestre, Augustin-François de (7 December 1762 – 4 August 1851), French inventor.Schwann, Theodor (7 December 1810 – 21 January 1882), German physiologist.Kronecker, Léopold (7 December 1823 – 29 December 1891), German mathematician.Cremona, Luigi (7 December 1830 – 10 June 1903), Italian mathematician.Renaut, Joseph Louis (7 December 1844 – 26 December 1917), French medical doctor.Debré, Robert Anselme (7 December 1882 – 29 April 1978), French medical doctor.8Romme, Nicolas Charles (8 December 1745 – 14 March 1805), French intellectual.Hansen, Peter Andreas (8 December 1795 – 28 March 1874), Danish German Astronomer.Agardh, Jakob Georg (8 December 1813 – 17 January 1901), Swedish botanist.Bernstein, Julius (8 December 1839 – 6 February 1917), German physiologist.Hadamard, Jacques Salomon (8 December 1865 – 17 October 1963), French mathematician.Jaumotte, André (8 December 1919), Belgian scientist.Dalibard, Jean (8 December 1958), French physicist.9Rivinus alias Bachmann, Augustus Quirinus (9 December 1652 – 30 December 1723), German physicist.Du Verney, Pierre (9 December 1653 – August 1728), French surgeon.Berthollet, Claude Louis (9 December 1748 – 6 November 1822), French chemist.Maindron, Charles Ernest (9 December 1838- -
