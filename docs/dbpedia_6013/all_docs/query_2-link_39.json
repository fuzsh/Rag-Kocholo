Each year, it rewards in particular personalities for their work or their research or for all of their work in the field of science, literature or the arts.\n\nThus, in 2022, it was Daniel Choquet, CNRS research director, who was awarded \"le grand prix 2022 de l’Academie nationale des sciences, belles lettres et arts de Bordeaux\"! Indeed, he achieved this distinction thanks to his main scientific achievement: the discovery that neurotransmitter receptors are in constant motion in the neuronal membrane and that the regulation of this traffic profoundly regulates synaptic transmission. Daniel Choquet will receive his award on March 28 from Pierre Hurmic, Mayor of Bordeaux.\n\nLearn more about: Le grand prix 2022 de l’Academie nationale des sciences, belles lettres et arts de Bordeaux\n\nThey talk about it too (articles in French): INSB and Bordeaux Neurocampus\n\nDo you want to know more?

This regulation of the strength of synaptic transmission is largely driven by changes in the number of receptors present at the synapse. In this work, the researchers identify a new mechanism for controlling the establishment of receptors at the level of the synapse through the control of their intracellular transport.\n\nNeurotransmitter receptors, and in particular glutamate receptors, are concentrated in synapses in front of neurotransmitter release sites. However, in the process of their biogenesis, these receptors are synthesized at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum, most of the time several hundred microns from the synapses. They must therefore be transported to the synapses. Our previous work had made possible to visualize for the first time the intracellular transport of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, responsible for the majority of the rapid excitatory transmission between neurons. These receptors are transported rapidly (1-2 microns per second) in vesicles circulating on the microtubules using molecular motors. We observed that, surprisingly, this transport was strongly regulated by neuronal activity.\n\nIn this new work, we have identified the molecular mechanisms responsible for these regulations. The cytosolic C-terminal domain of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit is specifically associated with two proteins, 4.1 N and SAP97. We analyzed how interactions between GluA1 and 4.1N or SAP97 regulate GluA1 transport and its exocytosis under basal conditions and after induction of synaptic plasticity (LTP). Our results identify differential roles of 4.1N and SAP97 in controlling the different phases of transport and membrane integration of GluA1.\n\nThis work opens new perspectives in understanding the molecular mechanisms that control the establishment and maintenance of glutamate receptors at the synapse during synaptic plasticity.\"\n\nDaniel Choquet is a member of the 2023 Fulbright France\n\nCreated in 1946 at the proposal of the eponymous US senator, Fulbright is an international academic mobility program of the US government. The aim of the program is to promote educational and cultural exchanges between France and the United States.\n\nSince its launch, 21,244 students from both countries have benefited from the program:\n\n“In addition to the funding that will help me live there, being a Fulbright fellow in the US is really recognized and will help me develop my network and meet many academics in various disciplines. Fulbright fellow also have a mission to be ambassadors of their country, and I certainly intend to introduce to colleagues to some French cuisine specialties!”\n\n#IMadteIt: Marie-Lise Jobin, a post-doctoral researcher starting out as an associate professor\n\nMarie-Lise Jobin is currently a post-doctoral researcher in Daniel Choquet’s \"Dynamic organization and function of synapses\" team. Interested in the role of the cytoskeleton in the function and structure of dendritic spines, the scientist is supervised by Anna Brachet. Marie-Lise recently obtained a permanent teaching-research position at the Institut National Polytechnique de Bordeaux (Bordeaux INP). Here, she looks back on her career.\n\nWhat is your background?\n\n\"I studied biology and structural biochemistry at the University of Bordeaux. During my Master’s and PhD, I worked in many different laboratories. First, I spent three months working at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada. Then, for my PhD, I joined the Institute of Chemistry and Biology of Membranes and Nano-objects (CBMN) in Pessac. On completion of my studies, I spent a year as a post-doctoral fellow at the Nutrition and Integrative Neurobiology Laboratory (Nutrineuro) in Bordeaux. I then spent over three years at the University of Würzburg in Bavaria, Germany. And for the last four years I’ve been at IINS. My post-doctoral adventure will finally come to an end at the end in September 2023, and I’ll be taking up a position as an associate professor in September!\"\n\nWhy did you join IINS?\n\n\"Generally speaking, I’ve always been interested in biomolecular interactions involving cell membranes. I first worked on synthetic membrane models. However, I’ve always wanted to study more physiological systems. So the neuroscience field allows me to work with systems closer to physiology, and to use my highly interdisciplinary skills. [...] Anna Brachet’s field of research on the role of cytoskeletal proteins, in particular spectrins, and their partners, in the regulation, function and mechano-transduction of dendritic spines fit perfectly my research interests. Moreover, IINS is considered one of the most recognized institutes in the field of neuroscience. Above all, IINS is part of a synergistic system, with close relations to the Bordeaux Imaging Center (BIC). It was a unique opportunity to develop my skills in cutting-edge microscopy techniques and gain access to considerable knowledge in this field!\"\n\nCan you tell us about your research?\n\n\"I’m trying to understand the role of cytoskeletal proteins, beta spectrins, in neurons, and more specifically in dendritic spines, which are the seat of neuronal transmission. My results showed that beta spectrins are co-organised on a nanoscopic scale in dendritic spines and are particularly important for the stability of these structures. Their membrane or cytoskeleton partners are all the more important in maintaining and stabilising these spectrins under the membrane and influence their nano-organisation.\"\n\nAs a woman in science, what difficulties have you encountered?\n\n\"My biggest difficulty has always been a lack of self-confidence. But throughout my career I’ve been lucky enough to meet scientists, men and women who have had faith in me, and who have always supported and encouraged me along the way.\"\n\nWhy do women need to be more recognised in the scientific community?\n\n\"It seems quite logical to me that gender diversity, or diversity of any kind, leads to better, more creative and innovative science. I can see that things are changing, slowly but surely, in the right direction, and I’m optimistic for the future!\"\n\nAny advice for young researcher?\n\n\"I’m proud to have got where I am, to have succeeded in obtaining a permanent position in academia, and to have stayed the course despite many years of not knowing what would happen and never giving up. You have to persevere. It’s often the fear of failing that stops us from moving forward, so don’t hesitate, dare to take the plunge and, above all, trust yourself.\"\n\n2 days of exciting science on synapse biology around the PhD defense of Agata Nowacka\n\nMonday 6th November 2023\n\nWorkshop: Virtual Presynaptic Terminal\n\nWe invite you to a workshop where a collaborative team from University College London (UCL) and the University of Warwick will introduce a computational modelling framework that enables in silico exploration of the mechanisms of Ca²⁺-driven neurotransmitter release in different synapses.\n\nMorning session 9:00 – 12:30\n\n• Kirill Volynski: Introduction to the modelling framework with examples linking the model and experimental data.\n\n• Yulia Timofeeva: 3D modelling of presynaptic Ca2+ dynamics, covering Ca2+ influx, buffering, and diffusion.\n\n• Chris Norman: Modelling Ca 2+ activation of vesicular release and short-term synaptic plasticity.\n\n• Round table: model expansion across the synaptic cleft.\n\nAfternoon session 14:00 – 17:00\n\n• Yulia Timofeeva and Chris Norman: hands-on training for application of the virtual presynaptic terminal model.
