        "text": "The majestic UNESCO World Heritage site of Drottningholm Slott is a worthwhile day trip from Stockholm and is one of the most beautiful royal palaces in Europe. A visit to Drottningholm will take the best part of the day, but there are lots of things to see and explore whilst in the grounds and the boat ride to and from the palace is a lovely, relaxing way to travel.\n\nWhat is Drottningholm Slott?\n\nDrottningholm Slott is the official residence of the King and Queen of Sweden and they retain private quarters in the west wing of the palace to this day where they spend their time at home.\n\nSweden has plenty of royal palaces to explore, but this is by far the best one to visit with its beautifully manicured gardens and waterfront views.\n\nThe Drottningholm Palace has been in existence since the 1500s though it has undergone many changes over the years. Originally the summer court of the royal family, the palace was burnt down and rebuilt and was the site of summer celebrations throughout the 18th century.\n\nHowever, in the early 1800s the palace was abandoned and sat empty. Luckily, ensuing monarchs saw the potential in the palace and repaired and restored it to its former glory.\n\nHow to visit Drottningholm Slott\n\nDrive\n\nFrom Stockholm Central, a visit to Drottningholm is an easy twenty minute drive across several connected islands via Bromma. There’s little difference in time between toll roads and free, so save a little bit of cash and take the free route.\n\nFrom the Sodermalm area of Stockholm (which is definitely where I recommend you stay), the drive is a little longer and will take around 30 minutes for the free route and 25 minutes for the toll road. The Sodermalm route will take you via Hornstull, Langholmen and Bromma.\n\nThere is visitor parking available at Drottningholm Slott and the Drottningholm Palace Theatre, however it is paid at around 15 SEK an hour with a maximum six hour limit. Accessible parking is free of charge.\n\nPublic Transport\n\nFrom Stockholm Central, walk around five minutes to T-Centralen and then take the 17, 18 or 19 train to Brommaplan, where you’ll need to hop off and get the 176, 177, 312 or 317 bus to Drottningholm.\n\nFrom Sodermalm, you can follow the same route as above, but you’ll be jumping on the train a few stops earlier at Medborgarplatsen. This station is located a ten minute walk from Sodermalm, right near the Scandic Malmen hotel.\n\nBoat\n\nBy far the best way to visit Drottningholm Slott is by boat. A gentle, hour-long one way trip on the Strömma Kanalbolaget is the perfect way to start and end your Drottningholm adventure.\n\nIf you are spending a few days in Stockholm, though, and want a way to maximise your savings, I’d definitely recommnend getting yourself a Stockholm Pass. Both of these passes allow you to visit many of Stockholm’s museum attractions and also include canal rides and hop on/hop off bus and boat transport.\n\nFor the boat trip to Drottningholm, you can go to the ticket shop at City Hall and buy your ticket there. Alternatively, you can book online via the Strömma website as they will prioritise pre-booked passengers over walk-ups. Tickets for the return boat trip will cost 260 SEK.\n\nHow to get tickets for Drottningholm Slott\n\nEntry to the Drottningholm Palace costs around 130 SEK (and slightly more in peak season from June – August). This will get you entry to the palace alone. You are able to book these online, which I recommend to avoid missing out.\n\nTo visit the Palace, the Chinese Pavilion and the Theatre, you’ll be up for 290 SEK.\n\nA guided tour of the palace is also a great option for those who want to learn more about this beautiful palace’s history. The tour is only an additional 30 SEK (and children under 18 are free).\n\nYour Stockholm Pass includes access to Drottningholm Slott as well as the boat ride over.\n\nWhat to see at Drottningholm Slott\n\nThe Palace\n\nVisiting the inside of Drottningholm Slott goes without saying. If you’re going to make the trip out here, you absolutely must ensure that you explore the grandeur of the Royal Palace.\n\nThe architecture and décor of Drottningholm might awaken a few memories of visiting the Palace of Versailles – and for good reason. The famous French palace was the inspiration for Drottningholm and there’s plenty of similarities to spot.\n\nThe Chinese Pavilion\n\nIt might seem a little odd to find a beautiful Chinese Pavilion built in the gardens of Drottningholm, but this gorgeous dusty pink structure was gifted to the Queen in 1753 as a birthday present.\n\nThe inside of the pavilion is just as picture perfect as its exterior with lavish Rococo furniture featuring an Eastern twist.\n\nThe Gardens\n\nDrottningholm Palace Park features enormous and meticulously cared for gardens. The raked stone paths are adorned with bronze sculptures and impeccably curated hedges are shaped to perfection.\n\nIn these beautiful gardens, there are water features and lush chestnut trees. The gardens at Drottningholm are in three main sections – the Baroque Garden, the Chinese Pavilion gardens and the English Park.\n\nThe gardens around the Chinese Pavilion are perfect to sit down and have a picnic lunch on your visit to Drottningholm.\n\nWhere to stay if you’re visiting Drottningholm Slott?\n\nAs the Drottningholm Palace is pretty easily accessible from most parts of Stockholm, there are plenty of options for accommodation within walking or public transport distance.\n\nI absolutely love the Sodermalm neighbourhood and would 100% recommend that anyone visiting Stockholm stay there for its vibrant nightlife, abundance of food options and proximity to all of Stockholm’s attractions.\n\nBooking.com\n\nLike this post on visiting Drottningholm Slott?\n\nPin to save it for later!\n\nMore posts about Sweden"
