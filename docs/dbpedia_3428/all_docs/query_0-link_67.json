        "meta_description": "Lovön, one of the many islands on Lake Mälaren, is said to have a history that goes back to 2500 BCE. Located just about 15.5 kilometers (9.63 miles) from Stockholm proper, Lovön is surrounded by several big and small isles such as Fågelön and Kungshatt in south and Färingsö in the North. The island was an independent municipality until 1952, when it was merged with the municipality of Ekerö. No trip to Lovön goes without visiting the historic Drottningholm Palace. Other interesting attractions here include the Lovö church and Lovö Runestones; owing to its distinguished history, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991.",
