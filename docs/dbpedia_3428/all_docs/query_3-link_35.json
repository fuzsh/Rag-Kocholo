        "text": "Welcome to one of Europe's largest and most dynamic palaces. The Royal Palace of Stockholm is His Majesty The King's official residence and is also the setting for most of the monarchy's official receptions. Much of the palace is open to the public year round.\n\nThe palace is the workplace of The King and Queen, and of the offices that are included in the Royal Court. The Royal Palace is a combination of royal residence, workplace and cultural-historical monument, and is open all year round to visitors.\n\nThe palace is built in baroque style by the architect Nicodemus Tessin and is formed as a Roman palace. The palace has more than 600 rooms divided between eleven floors with a state apartment facing the city and smaller living rooms facing the inner courtyard.\n\nThe palace contains many interesting things to see. In addition to the Royal Apartments there are three museums steeped in regal history: the Treasury with the regalia, the Tre Kronor Museum that portrays the palace's medieval history and Gustav III's Museum of Antiquities*. The palae also houses the Royal Chapel*. The changing of the guard and the Royal Gift Shop are particularly popular with visitors.\n\nJust five minutes walk from the Royal Palace, you will find the Riddarholmen Church – the royal burial church.\n\n*Gustav III's Museum of Antiquities and the Royal Chapel are temporarily closed summer season 2024\n\nHistory and highlights of the Royal Palace\n\nPhoto: Raphael Stecksén/Royalpalaces.se"
