        "text": "The Swedish capital has all the hallmarks of a fairy tale–a glittering royal palace, gabled buildings, and centuries-old cobblestone streets.\n\nDon’t be fooled though. It may have a lot of history, but it also has a dynamic side to it that’s constantly evolving.\n\nAfter all, it’s the city of the Nobel Prize, H&M, IKEA, Skype, and Spotify. It’s also home to a vibrant music scene where artists like ABBA, Robyn, Roxette, Ace of Base, and Swedish House Mafia got their start.\n\nPlus don’t forget its famously innovative design scene… and all its foodie delights like pickled herring, Swedish meatballs, and countless Michelin-star restaurants.\n\nNo wonder Stockholm is an incredible place to visit! The city has a lot going on, and it’s easy to lose yourself in the hustle and bustle of it all.\n\nBut no worries! We’ve got you covered with our top 10 things to do in Stockholm.\n\nThings To Do in Stockholm: The Basics\n\nStockholm is a city of endless possibilities. This humble but mighty city is home to one of Europe’s best-preserved old towns and Sweden’s largest archipelago. It is no surprise that the city has an impressive history and offers countless things to do.\n\nScroll on below for the city’s basic info and our top 10 favorite activities:\n\nCurrency: Swedish Krona\n\nPopulation: Approx. 978,800\n\nAirport Transport Options: private driver, bus transfer, or Arlanda Express Train\n\nPublic Transport Options: subway, tram, bus, ferry, or commuter train\n\nRecommended duration: at least 3-4+ days\n\nPrice for each meal (average): 120-180+ SEK or $ 11-18 USD\n\nStockholm City Hall\n\n(Stockholms Stadhus)\n\nThe towering Stockholm City Hall is a building you cannot miss. Stretching out into the water and dominating the horizon, it’s an iconic architectural jewel and one of the most famous silhouettes in Stockholm.\n\nIt was designed by architect Ragnar Östberg, who wanted to create a building that would reflect Sweden’s cultural heritage and history. He designed it with eight million bricks. It’s 106 meters tall at its highest point and topped it with three golden crowns. Stockholm City Hall is also one of the country’s leading examples of national romanticism in architecture.\n\nAt first glance, its exteriors seem simple and minimalist, but it’s unarguably magnificent on the inside. Its interiors skillfully combine numerous styles– Renaissance, Byzantine, Viking, Classical, and many more.\n\nBehind its magnificent facades are offices and session halls for politicians and officials; unique works of art; and even a ballroom, called Golden Hall, where Nobel Prize winners dance after their awards ceremony! In fact, over 18 million pieces of gold leaf tiles dazzle in the intricate mosaics encircling this hall, which feature iconic symbols and scenes from Sweden’s history and folklore such as the Queen of Lake Malaren.\n\nAddress: Hantverkargatan 1 112 21 Stockholm, Sweden\n\nDirections\n\nWebsite\n\nRoyal Palace\n\n(Kungliga Slotten)\n\nStockholm Royal Palace is a massive monument to Sweden’s history and identity, while also the home of the nation’s crown jewels.\n\nBuilt starting in the 1600s, the palace is the official residence of the Swedish monarch and contains a complex of Swedish royal museums.\n\nA visit to Stockholm Royal Palace is like taking a trip through time—from medieval times all the way up to the present.\n\nThe palace was built in baroque style by architect Nicodemus Tessin and is formed as a Roman palace.\n\nThe palace has more than 600 rooms divided between eleven floors, and visitors are allowed to tour about 40 of these rooms.\n\nAside from the Royal Apartments, there are also three museums steeped in regal history: The Treasury with its collection of regalia; Tre Kronor Museum documenting its medieval history; and Gustav III’s Museum of Antiquities. And if that weren’t enough, during summer months you can also tour the Riddarholmen Church – which has been used as a burial ground for Swedish kings since ancient times.\n\nPRO TIP: Don’t miss the Changing of the Guard at the Stockholm Royal Palace\n\nIf you’re visiting the Royal Palace, don’t miss the Changing of the Guard. It’s a ceremony that takes place every day around 12:15 noon in the courtyard of the Royal Palace.\n\nOn regular days, you’ll see a short but impressive ceremony. On certain days though, you will see all of the guards in full regalia, complete with swords, horses, and a full marching band. Check the Swedish Armed Forces website for the complete info.\n\nAddress: Kungliga slottet, 107 70 Stockholm, Sweden\n\nDirections\n\nWebsite\n\nOld Town – Gamla Stan\n\n(Gamla Stan)\n\nStockholm’s Gamla Stan is one of the most charming, magical places in all of Europe and one of the top things to do in Stockholm.\n\nIt’s a perfect place to spend a few hours. Visiting here will transport you back in time to a medieval wonderland.\n\nOnce the entire city in the 1200s, this island is now home to Sweden’s royal palace and the city’s oldest church.\n\nThe area is packed with shopping and dining options as you roam around a fun labyrinth of winding cobblestone streets.\n\nMany of these lead to (or from) Stortorget—the main public square near the Nobel Museum and just a stone’s throw away from the Stockholm Cathedral and Royal Palace.\n\nAddress: Gamla Stan area is on Skeppsbron island, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nDirections\n\nMore info\n\nStortorget\n\n(Grand Square)\n\nStortorget is the main square in Gamla Stan, and the oldest square in all of Stockholm. It is also known for its iconic brightly colored homes and buildings.\n\nFrom lively market days to grave persecutions, every corner of this square has a grand story to tell.\n\nMarveling at the picturesque area today, it’s hard to imagine that the lovely location once had a dark side. It once hosted the Stockholm Bloodbath, a horrible event in which dozens of the city’s aristocracy were tormented.\n\nBut now, the square is a place for everyone to enjoy, perfect for taking picturesque Instagram photos, and people-watching. Our recommendation for the best way to enjoy this area is to have a Swedish fika (aka a coffee and cake break.)\n\nPRO TIP: Don’t miss the opportunity to partake in “fika” while in Stortorget or anywhere in Gamla Stan\n\nFika is a Swedish ritual that is part- coffee break, part- socializing, and all delicious.\n\nThink of it as an informal and relaxed version of the British afternoon tea.\n\nIt’s so entrenched in Swedish culture that a lot of companies make time for their employees to take fika breaks. When in Sweden, right?\n\nAddress: Stortorget, 111 29, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nDirections\n\nMore info\n\nBoat Cruise\n\nIn many ways, Stockholm is a city inextricably linked to its watery surroundings. So to ensure that you experience all that Stockholm has to offer, we recommend you get a boat cruise on the lake.\n\nStockholm’s Lake Malaren and its city canals are not only lined with historic buildings and museums—and it’s also home to some of the city’s most beautiful parks. You’ll be able to see a different perspective from the water, which is why we recommend taking this cruise at sunset (or any time of day, really). The views are breathtaking!\n\nThere are dozens of different companies offering boat tours from Stockholm, with options ranging from short trips that take less than an hour to full-day cruises that take you out into the archipelago. Some even offer dinner cruises and special events like music festivals or cocktail parties.\n\nWe ourselves took a Royal Canal boat cruise tour around Djurgarden canal. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves as we sailed around the greener parts of the city.\n\nWhether you’re looking for something quick and easy or a luxury experience, there’s something for everyone!\n\nMore info\n\nVasa Museum\n\n(Vasamuseet)\n\nLocated in Djurgarden, the Vasa Museum is a world-renowned museum that has a 400-year-old ship as its star attraction.\n\nBut while that already sounds interesting in itself – what’s even more intriguing is the incredible story behind the massive ship.\n\nIn 1628, King Gustavus Adolphus launched his newly built warship, the Vasa.\n\nBarely minutes into her maiden voyage, a gust of wind blew over the top-heavy ship packed with an excessive amount of war cannons. This extra weight quickly sent her to the bottom of Stockholm’s harbor.\n\nFor 300 years she lay there at the bottom of the sea until 1961 when salvage divers brought her up again in an unprecedented archaeological project.\n\nWhat was once a Titanic-sized failure…. Today, it’s a popular attraction– an amazing ship in a state-of-the-art museum where she has been preserved in all her glory.\n\nAddress: Galarvarvsvagen 14, Stockholm 115 21, Sweden\n\nDirections\n\nMore information\n\nDjurgarden\n\nIf you’re looking for the quintessential Stockholm experience, you’ll find it in Djurgarden. This island has been a city park since the 17th century, and today it’s one of the locals’ and tourists’ favorite things to do in Stockholm.\n\nDjurgarden is Stockholm’s “Garden Island,” and 400 years ago, it was once the king’s hunting ground. Today, it’s a national park and home to some of the city’s most popular museums. In addition, it offers tons of fun activities like renting a canoe, having a picnic with your friends, and taking a bike ride through the beautiful scenery. You can even rent your own boat if you want!\n\nIf you’re looking for something more low-key, take in some local art or local history at one of the many museums on the island—such as Vasa Museum, ABBA The Museum, Skansen Open Air Museum, Nordic Museum, The Viking Museum, and more.\n\nAddress: Östermalm, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nDirections\n\nMore information\n\nNobel Museum\n\n(Nobelmuseet)\n\nThe Nobel Museum in Stockholm tells the story of the world’s most prestigious award and honor—the Nobel Prize.\n\nWithin Stockholm’s Old Town, the museum is located in an 18th-century building that once served as a stock exchange. Now, the museum shares the achievements of history’s most famous laureates: Marie Curie, Nelson Mandela, and Albert Einstein among others. In addition, you can also learn about the life and work of Alfred Nobel, who aimed to recognize extraordinary individuals whose work improved humanity.\n\nThe museum offers a comprehensive look at the history of the Nobel Prize and its recipients, with exhibits that focus on physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace.\n\nHere, you can explore an extensive collection of videos, artifacts, and multimedia as well as lectures by experts from around the globe.\n\nAddress: Stortorget 2, Gamla Stan, 111 29, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nDirections\n\nMore info\n\nDrottningholm Palace\n\nIf you’re in Stockholm for more than one day, do a day trip to Drottningholm Palace. This is one of Sweden’s three World Heritage Sites and it’s just outside the city on Lovön Island.\n\nThe palace was conceived in the 17th century and was built in the French style. It features luxurious interiors from the 1600s to 1800s—and one of the remarkable details here is the Palace Theatre, which dates to the 1700s and continues to stage performances to this day. It’s largely unchanged!\n\nDon’t miss the Chinese Pavilion, an architectural masterpiece within the palace park.\n\nIt was built as a birthday gift for Queen Lovisa Ulrika and features an oriental-infused Rococo style with Chinese lacquered screens and art. The palace looks stunning from the water so take a ferry if you can!
