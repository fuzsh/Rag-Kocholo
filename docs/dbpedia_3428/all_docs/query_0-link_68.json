        "text": "edit\n\nEvents and Festivals\n\nStockholm Pride\n\nAn inclusive event for any gender or sexual preference, the Stockholm Pride festival is a celebration of Sweden’s gay and lesbian community. It began in 1988, and hosted the Europride Festival in both 1998 and 2008. Most of the events take place in Pride Park, which includes plenty of music, food, and performances. Thousands of people come to Stockholm for the event at the end of July every year, which usually runs into the beginning of August.\n\nStockholm International Film Festival\n\nNow in its 21st year, the famous Stockholm International Film Festival lures thousands of film buffs and critics to the capital ever year. Held the last two weeks of November, dozens of films from around the globe are screened at venues throughout Stockholm, with some of the most acclaimed directors taking part in the festivities.\n\nedit\n\nGetting Around\n\nBy Car\n\nStockholm has a system where you pay to enter the centre, which costs even more when entering during morning and late evening rush hours. Add to that high parking rates and you'll see why visiting the city by car is not the most welcoming way.\n\nBy Public Transport\n\nSL is the company running all public transportation in Stockholm. The city is separated into three zones; A, B and C. Tickets are valid in all modes of public transport for one hour in the respective zones. There are also Travelcards available for unlimited journeys during the time of validity. For comprehensible information about the Stockholm public transport in English please see this guide.\n\nStockholm's centre is easily navigated on foot, especially if you stay in and around Gamla Stan, Södermalm and the southern part of Norrmalm. Even walking along the Strandvägen towards Skansen and Djurgarden doesn't pose any problems if you are reasonably fit. And remember there is always a metro, tram or ferry that can take you back again.\n\nedit\n\nDrink\n\nThere are hundreds of bars and trendy drinking places in Stockholm. Although the ones in Gamla Stan are relatively touristy and pricey, they are nevertheless fine for a coffee or beer. Every neighbourhood has its own cafe culture, but Södermalm is know for having the best places to have a drink and combine it with some food or club afterwards.\n\nedit\n\nKeep Connected\n\nInternet\n\nInternet is widely stretched out in a very modern way and you can find 3G network (and soon 4G as well) almost everywhere, though in the higher northern parts and in the mountains it is of course harder or impossible.\n\nThe number of WiFi access points are growing and fast food chains, libraries, hotels, cafés and malls and others may offer free wireless internet access. Fixed terminals where you can pay for internet access exist as well, although many libraries can provide the same service for free. Some buses for longer distances have free wifi and most of the trains do have it as well but at cost sometimes.\n\nAlmost every household does have internet and it is fast and modern. You barely see any internet cafés because of the influence by high-tech phones with internet access and the cheaper and more comfortable internet at home, but there are some places like Pressbyrån that offers computers with internet access (not free).\n\nPhone\n\nSee also: International Telephone Calls\n\nThe general emergency number is 112. Sweden's international calling code number is +46. Payphones are available (however extremely rare), with older models only accepting cards (special smartchip phone cards as well as credit cards), and newer models that accept coins. Collect calls are possible by dialing 2# on a pay phone.\n\nSweden has excellent wireless GSM and 3G/UMTS coverage, even in rural areas except in the central and northern interior parts of the country. The major networks are Telia, Tele2/Comviq, Telenor and 3 (Tre). Swedish GSM operates on the European 900/1800 MHz frequencies. You can choose to buy a local SIM card or bring your own cellphone. Be careful for roaming costs though and try to use wifi only.\n\nPrepaid USB 3G modems can be bought in many shops. They are a good alternative to WiFi in Sweden. They cost around 100 SEK/week and 300 SEK/month to use. Data limits are high (typically 20 GB/month). The prepaid 3G data package of the provider 3 bought in Sweden can be used in Denmark without incurring any roaming charge. It is, however, not possible to buy refill vouchers for this products in Danish stores.\n\nPost\n\nPosten AB is the Swedish postal service, with fast and reliable services. They have a wide range of services including a track and trace system and different options regarding the sending of postcards, letters and parcels. There are both express and economy services and if you are not in a hurry the latter option is fine enough.\n\nThe postal service was abandoned at the public post offices in 2001. The public today deals with its postal business at Postal Service Points. Mail and parcels can now be picked up at a number of places, including gas stations, supermarkets and kiosks. Look for the blue and yellow sign above or by the entrance of outlets providing this service. You can also buy stamps and there are quite a few more services in these places, many of which stay open late in the evening and on weekends. Yellow post boxes are for national and international letters and blue for regional letters. Postal Service Centres are maintained for business clients and Svensk Kassaservice, a chain which deals with simple financial transactions but offers no postal services. There are also traditional post offices offering the full range of services. They are usually open between 9:30am and 6:00pm and may have extended opening hours once or twice a week.\n\nOne of their competitors is Bring Citymail AB, formerly privatised but now nationalised by Norway. Otherwise, for sending parcels internationally, try and use international companies lik TNT, DHL, UPS or FedEx."
