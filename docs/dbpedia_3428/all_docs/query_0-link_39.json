Enter the palace halls, wander around the palace park, take a guided tour or visit Drottningholm Palace Church. In addition, there are many activities for children! And maybe, you’ll even get a glimt of someone from the royal family.\n\nYou can find more info about Drottningholm Palace here!\n\nThe Chinese Pavilion\n\nIf you make your way to Drottningholm Palace, donät miss out on the remarkable Chinese Pavilion.
