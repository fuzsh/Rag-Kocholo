        "text": "Last weekend we visited Drottningholm Palace in Stockholm. It was a fantastic autumn weekend, and really lovely to walk around the castle park in the November sun. We have seen the castle before, but also took the opportunity to see the theatre, which was really fun. Here are some tips for things to see and do at Drottningholm Palace. Have you been here? What is your favourite?\n\nDrottningholm Palace in Stockholm\n\nDrottningholm Palace in Stockholm was built in the 17th century and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991. The palace was built after French models by architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, on behalf of Queen Hedvig Eleonora.\n\nThe Royal Family at Drottningholm Palace\n\nThe Royal Family moved into Drottningholm Palace in 1981, and the palace is now the permanent residence of the Royal Couple. However, it is not very likely that you will run into the Royal Family during your visit. Even if they were to be there, they live in the southern part of the palace, which is not accessible to visitors.\n\nHowever, most of the castle and park are open to visitors all year round. If the flag is flying? It means that the royal family is in Sweden, but for security reasons it does not say whether they are at home at the palace or not.\n\nThings to see and do at Drottningholm Palace in Stockholm\n\nDrottningholm Palace in Stockholm is impressive and is set in a vast palace park full of interesting buildings. Here are 12 things to see and do during your visit:\n\n1. Stroll around the castle park\n\nFirst of all, you can of course stroll around the beautiful castle park. The park is large and consists of different parts from different periods of history. Baroque garden, which is adjacent to the castle, was created in the 17th century and was inspired by the tamed and symmetrical French castle gardens of the time. Here you can stroll around bronze sculptures, lime tree avenues, boxwood hedges and several large and small fountains.\n\nAnother part of the castle garden is the the garden around China Castle, which was created in the middle of the 18th century. At this time in history, the strict ideal of a garden was abandoned in favour of a more natural park with chestnut avenues and a pond.\n\n2. Experience the English Park\n\nA little later in history, when Gustav III took over Drottningholm in 1777, it was created. English Park. This park consists of ponds with canals, islands, bridges, large lawns and trees in avenues and groves.\n\nIn the centre of the park are Monument Islands, where an amorous temple was originally planned, which was later replaced by a memorial temple to Gustav III. To the east of Monumentholmen is the island Svanholmen, where a swan house was built at the end of the 19th century.\n\n3. Visit the castle halls\n\nDrottningholm Palace has changed over the years and the royals who have lived here have all left their mark on the interior design. They all wanted to showcase a castle that was modern and kept up with the fashion trends of the time. In other words, the royals of the time were not so different from the ordinary people of today!\n\nWhen the Royal Palace was designed by the architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, Baroque architecture was the order of the day, and some examples from this period include the following the magnificent staircase and Hedvig Eleonora's impressive bedchamber..\n\nIn 1744, the castle was given as a wedding gift (wow!) to Princess Lovisa Ulrika of Prussia when she married the Swedish heir to the throne, Adolf Fredrik. During Lovisa Ulrika's time, the castle was furnished with French-inspired rococo interiors. An example from this period is the beautiful and colourful... impressive library. You can also peek into the The porcelain roomwhich is an exhibition room with 18th century faience.\n\n4. Take a guided tour of Drottningholm Palace.\n\nYou can walk around the castle on your own, but you can also choose to join a guided tour, in Swedish or English. A guided tour always gives a little more, we think, so we chose to join one. Interesting!\n\n5. Take a guided tour of the castle theatre\n\nDrottningholm Palace Theatre was built in 1766 for Queen Lovisa Ulrika, after the first theatre burned down after only a few years, and is one of the world's best preserved theatres from this period. The theatre's heyday began soon after when Gustav III, the so-called Theatre King, took over the theatre. Now you can take a guided tour of the theatre, and it's really fascinating.\n\nThe theatre offers a lot of ingenuity, not least in the form of a \"wind machine\" that creates the sound of wind, and another machine that evokes the sound of thunder. Drottningholmsteatern is also a living theatre, and in the summer you can see opera, theatre and dance performances here.\n\n6. see the castle church\n\nDrottningholm Palace Churchlocated in the northern roundhouse of the castle, was inaugurated in 1730 and is still in use. The church belongs to the court administration, but the Lovö parish celebrates services in the castle church on the last weekend of each month when everyone is welcome.\n\nIt also hosts concerts during the summer and Christmas season. Princess Leonore, Prince Nicolas, Prince Alexander and Prince Gabriel have been baptised in this church. Unfortunately, the church was not open when we were here, so we had to settle for taking photos from the outside.\n\n7. Walk to China Castle\n\nAt the far end of the Drottningholm Palace Park is the China Castle, which together with the castle is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Adolf Fredrik had the castle built in secret, and then surprised Lovisa Ulrika with the castle as a birthday present in 1753. However, the China Castle you see today dates from 1769.\n\nAt this time, everything that was Chinese was high fashion. It was difficult for Westerners to travel into China, and even if they did, they could only see selected parts. This made China seem like a fairytale country, and people loved to collect Chinese products such as spices, silk, porcelain and artefacts. The castle was unfortunately not open when we were here, but there are supposedly a lot of imported Chinese artefacts.\n\nJust north-west of China Castle is the pavilion. Confidences, where dining and serving tables could be hoisted up through the floor of the dining room. This allowed the royals to dine without service!\n\n8. Check out the Guard Tent\n\nRight next to China Castle you can also see The guard tent. When Gustav III took over Drottningholm Palace in 1777, China Palace was popular with the court, and it became necessary to provide a building for the guards. Between 1781-1782, the guard tent was built, which is designed as a Turkish or Roman soldier's tent. The tent is also reminiscent of the copper tents in Haga Park, which were added a few years later.\n\n9. Coffee at the castle café\n\nIn the white villa, which is apparently also called the CaramelThe Drottningholm Palace Café is located on the lake side of the palace. It serves classic Swedish home-cooked food as well as coffee, pastries, sandwiches, beer and wine. We would have liked to have a coffee here, but as we were a little late for a guided tour, we had to have a sausage in the nearby kiosk instead ...\n\n10. Check out art and sculptures\n\nThere are two art museums at Drottningholm, Evert Lunquist's studio and Museum de Vries. Both were unfortunately closed when we were here in November, but are open at other times of the year. The artist Evert Lundquist has had his studio in the old engine house at China Castle, and now oil paintings, charcoal drawings and drypoint engravings are displayed here.\n\nThe old Dragon Stable on Drottningholm Island contains a unique collection of sculptures by the Dutch sculptor Adriaen de Vries (1556-1626). The museum is open for pre-booked tours and during the annual Museum de Vries Day. In addition to these two museums, you can of course visit all the sculptures in the Drottningholm Palace's sculpture park!\n\n11. Go to events and Christmas markets\n\nThere is of course a lot going on at Drottningholm Palace! It can be anything from special themed tours to various activities for children. During Christmas, an atmospheric event is also organised. Christmas market with delicacies and artisans, such as blacksmiths and candle makers.\n\n12. see more buildings around Drottningholm Palace\n\nThe area around the Drottningholm World Heritage Site is large and contains many historically interesting buildings. Here are some more:\n\nDrottningholm Palace Stables is located just north of the castle church. The building was constructed between 1737 and 1770 and today houses premises for the high guard.\n\nGrindstugan was built in 1846-1847 and is located at the western end of Lindallee. In the past, Drottningholm could be reached via two access roads, and this was one of them. Today the cottage is rented out as a summer residence.\n\nHemmet, which is located north of Ekerövägen, was probably designed in the 1780s and became the governor's residence in 1816. In order not to be confused with the governor's office, the building was called the Hemmet.\n\nUpper and lower lake wing, also known as Oldfrau's grand piano and Caretaker's wingare two buildings directly south of the south wing of the Palace. The lower lake wing was Crown Princess Victoria's first private residence.\n\nDrottningholm bathhouse stands south of the castle. The bathhouse was built in 1792 and is probably the oldest preserved of its kind in Sweden.\n\nGothic Tower stands at the western end of the English Park.
