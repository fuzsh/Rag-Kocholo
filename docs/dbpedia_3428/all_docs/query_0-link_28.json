        "text": "While the natural sceneries are pleasant in themselves, Ekerö has an impressive cultural heritage, with Sweden's first city, and the residence of the Royal family.\n\n— For the real Viking buff, there's Birka, the site of a former city of about 1,000 inhabitants situated on Björkö, an island in Lake Mälaren. The city had its heyday during the Viking Age, from AD 700 to AD 1100. As the Vikings were Scandinavians who travelled overseas for commerce, colonization, raiding or mercenary adventures, the citizens of Birka were by definition not Vikings. However, it was probably Sweden's first city, and Vikings and other travellers brought foreign artifacts and ideas, such as Christianity.\n\nSince most buildings were made of wood, traces of the settlement are hard to spot, and the most prominent \"old\" structure is a stone cross from the 19th century; a 1,000-year memorial of the advent of Christianity. The small museum (+46 8 56051445, closed during winter) is really only worth the ride if you are genuinely interested in the subject. Parts of the settlement have been reconstructed.\n\nBoats to Björkö are operated by Strömma Kanalbolaget[dead link]. Birka can also be reached by taking the green line of the underground (T-Bana) to Brommaplan and from there suburban bus 312 to Rastaholm. Once at Rastaholm, walk down the road to your left for 800 m and you'll find yourself at an inn and a jetty. From here, boats depart for Birka at 10:15, 11:00 or 11:30 depending on the season (see timetable[dead link]), taking 15-30 minutes to reach Birka.\n\nDuring the summer, there are several staged events (fairs, archaeology expos etc) at Birka."
