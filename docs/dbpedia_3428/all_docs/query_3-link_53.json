        "text": "Half Day City\n\nStockholm is a cosmopolitan city of the first order, yet still maintains a strongly Swedish identity. On this 4 hour tour, see its most famous sights. Built across an archipelago bridging Lake Malaren in the west and the Baltic Sea in the east, each of Stockholm’s islands has its own unique character. The tour begins with Gamla Stan, Stockholm’s historic city center. Located in the center of the bay, the island is a maze of medieval streets tightly packed with shops, cafes, and other businesses. The northern half of the old town, however, has been carved out for the monumental facades and avenues of Sweden’s Royal Palace. The Storkyrkan cathedral is next door, while two small adjoining islands house Sweden’s parliament and government offices. Across the harbor at Djurgarden is the city’s museum district, featuring the legendary Vasa Museum, with an intact 17th century warship, and the ABBA Museum. Finish the tour with City Hall, home to the Nobel Prize ceremony.\n\n4 hrs\n\nHalf Day Drottingholm Palace\n\nDrottningholm Palace, a UNESCO world heritage site and the epitome of Swedish Royal luxury, is the setting of this 4 hour day trip from Stockholm. Located on one of the inner islands of the city’s archipelago, Drottningholm has historically wavered in and out of favor with the Swedish monarchs, but currently serves as their private residence. The stunning golden-yellow facades are perched at the water’s edge, with expansive gardens emanating in all directions. Extending directly from the front of the palace are the lavishly ornamented and precisely arranged Baroque Gardens. The English Gardens surround the fringes, and offer a more organic feel, with serene vistas planned to be stumbled upon. Also on the complex is the Royal Theater, an 18th century masterpiece that continues to host prestigious concerts and shows. Finally, visit the Chinese Pavilion, a garden shelter built in Rococo style with oriental flourishes, emblematic of the 18th century European fascination with the far east.\n\n4 hrs\n\nAirport - Half Day - Pier\n\nDon’t miss out on the wonders of Sweden’s capital, and make the most of your transfer with this 4 hour package. Before setting sail to explore Europe’s northern waters, enjoy 3 hours of sightseeing featuring Stockholm’s best attractions. After pickup from the airport, visit Gamla Stan, where the Royal Palace and Swedish Parliament nestle up against the medieval old town. Enjoy spectacular views of the city and its harbor as you visit Djurgarden and its fabulous museums. Finally, see City Hall, home to the Nobel Prize ceremony before heading to the cruise terminals.\n\n4 hrs\n\nHotel - Half Day - Pier\n\nBefore escaping to set sail on Europe’s northern waters, enjoy 3 hours of sightseeing featuring Stockholm’s best attractions. A personal driver will provide hotel pickup, followed by a scenic drive through the city. Visit Gamla Stan, where the Royal Palace and Swedish Parliament nestle up against the medieval old town. Enjoy spectacular views of the city and its harbor as you visit Djurgarden and its fabulous museums. Finally, see City Hall, home to the Nobel Prize ceremony before heading to the cruise terminals.\n\n4 hrs\n\nFull Day City\n\nJourney across the full range of Stockholm’s various islands with this 8 hour day of sightseeing in the Swedish capital. Starting in the city center, explore Gamla Stan, the original core of the city. Here you will find a stunning clash of styles, with half the island squeezed by historic buildings jostled around winding medieval streets, and the other half dominated by the four sprawling Baroque facades of the Royal Palace. The national Parliament and government buildings are close by as well. Around the harbor you will enjoy scenic views as you continue to Djurgarden, home to the city’s most famous museums. These include the warship Vasa, one of the largest of its time and the only 17th century warship preserved intact, having been raised from the bottom of the harbor in 1961. Pass by City Hall, home to the Nobel Prize, before transitioning to the countryside for the second part of the tour. Explore the grounds of Drottningholm Palace. A UNESCO World Heritage site, the palace was built in 17th century Baroque style, with bright, golden-yellow facades. The main palace is surrounded by two contrasting gardens: the precisely ordered Baroque Garden, and the organic feel of the English Garden. The historic Palace Theater and Chinese Pavilion are also of interest.\n\n8 hrs"
