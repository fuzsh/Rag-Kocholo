        "text": "Today you can explore much of Drottningholm’s interior and stroll through its extensive gardens, including the French formal garden and English Park. It’s also possible to explore the Court Theatre, the Castle Church, and the ornate Chinese Pavilion. The royal family resides in the southern wing of palace, but the rest of the complex is open to the public for tours and independent exploration.\n\nSome Stockholm city tours include a visit to Drottningholm Palace, and options are available for both private and group tours. It’s also possible to visit the palace on a boat trip from Stockholm, or visit independently with a Stockholm Pass.\n\nDrottningholm Palace is a must-see for history and culture lovers.\n\nVisitor facilities include a visitor center, gift shop, and onsite restaurant.\n\nThe palace is accessible to wheelchairs, but strollers are not permitted.\n\nPhotography and filming are allowed, but be careful not to use flash.\n\nDrottningholm Palace is located roughly seven miles (11 kilometers) west of Stockholm via Route 275. Travelers can also take the subway (T-bana) to Brommaplan, then change to the bus for Drottningholm. Bus and boat tours from Stockholm are a convenient option and allow you to avoid the hassle of navigation and parking.\n\nPalace hours vary by season, but the grounds tend to be most crowded in summer when Sweden’s weather is typically sunny and warm. During this season, arrive early or visit on a weekday to avoid crowds.\n\nFamilies with kids can enjoy child-focused events held at the royal palace throughout the year. Children aged seven and under get free admission to the palace and can partake in activities such as a scavenger hunt for specific animals and plants featured in the palace’s interior rococo decorations."
