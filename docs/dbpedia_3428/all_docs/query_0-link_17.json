        "text": "17th-century architecture and royal recidence\n\nThe original castle was destroyed in a fire and the current castle was built in 1662, designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, on the order of Queen Hedwig Eleonora. All royal personages have expressed their taste in the castle’s interior.\n\nQueen Hedvig Eleonora’s state bedchamber, in gold and deep blue, was created by the best artists in the country. Gustav III had a love of chinoiserie and therefore had one room redecorated and turned into the Chinese Salon. Nicodemus Tessin the Younger designed the magnificent baroque garden that took shape in 1681. The southern part of the castle is currently the residency of the Swedish Royal couple King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia.\n\nGuided tours in English and Swedish\n\nThe castle is open almost during the whole year, with the exception of a couple of weeks in December. Between October and April, the guided tours are included in your ticket, but from May to September they cost 30 Swedish crowns (free for children under the age of 18). During the 45 minutes long tour you will see the castles staterooms and hear exciting facts.\n\nA well-preserved 18th century theater\n\nThe Drottningholm Palace Theatre (‘Slottsteater’ in Swedish) is one of Europe’s best-preserved theaters from the 18th century. The theater is open daily from April to September with tours in different languages. You are going to see the public rooms surrounding the auditorium, the decorations and the big foyer called the Dejeuner Salon. You are also going to experience 18th century sound effects, like the thunder and wind machine. The tour takes 30 minutes. A longer, 45-minute tour, is held at 4:30 pm before the evening performances.\n\nRococo settings and East India items in the Chinese Pavilion\n\nOn the grounds of Drottningholm Palace park lies the Chinese Pavilion which was a birthday gift to Queen Lovisa Ulrika from King Adolf Fredrik in 1753. The Chinese pleasure palace was originally built in wood which was replaced with a more durable material a couple of years later. Here you can experience the best version of European rococo interior design and chinoiserie with a fascinating collection of East India items.\n\nCombine Drottningholm with a boat excursion\n\nThe company Strömma Kanalbolaget organizes boat excursions where you reach the castle with a ship from the turn of the century. The 50-minute journey begins at Stadshuskajen and takes you alongside the beaches of lake Mälaren, rich nature, and magnificent villas on its way to Drottningholm. There are a restaurant and a café on board and the entrance fee is included in the price. Click here for more information about the boat excursions.\n\nReaching the palace\n\nTake the subway (green line) to Brommaplan and then change to bus 176, 177, 302, 303, 309, 311, 312 or 322, and exit at Drottningholm. You can also get here by car or by bicycle, follow the bicycle path from the center of Stockholm to Drottningholm."
