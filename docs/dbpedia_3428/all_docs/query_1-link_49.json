        "text": "The summer had so much to offer, and here is one of the places we went to on our visit to Sweden’s capital Stockholm: the royal palace in Drottningholm- which is also one of Unesco’s World Heritage Sites. As Swedes are very open, the visitors can actually visit part of the palace despite it still being used as a private residence by the royals. The location of the building dating back to 1600s is really picturesque by the water, and the palace is surrounded by magnificent grounds with plenty of water elements scattered around – plus a gorgeous Chinese Pavilion at the other end of the grounds.\n\nThe best way to enjoy the beauty of Stockholm on the way to the palace is by taking one of the frequently travelling boats there – that gives you about an hour each way to enjoy pretty houses and the nature along the way. Upon arrival to Drottningholm we first toured the actual palace, and then had a lovely lunch (a bit pricey perhaps) in the restaurant on the grounds. Then we were off to enjoy walking around the pretty gardens and visiting the Chinese Pavilion for a few hours.\n\nDrottningholm Palace is located by the water, which gives it even more appeal\n\nSo pretty and French in style\n\nReady to explore the castle and the expansive grounds\n\nNot everything is open for public, but one can wander around the buildings and admire the surroundings\n\nA guard doing his rounds, so funny when he peeks down in such a stiff manner!\n\nEnter the royal gardens…\n\nThe views are even prettied on the back side where there are several fountains and landscaped gardens\n\nEnter the next garden…\n\nThis actually is a building, not a tent!\n\nThe beautiful Chinese Pavilion, which has Chinese decor on display inside\n\nThe Chinese Pavilion has two little side pavilions, one of which is dressed as a dining room for a little royal meal\n\nPretty royal planters\n\nGarden exhibits\n\nA walk by a lake\n\nThe restaurant on-site serves delicious Swedish food\n\nWaiting for the boat to arrive\n\nEnjoying to the max!\n\nThe water is clear despite all the boats – this beach we spotted on our way back to the city\n\nThe city outline is a mix of old industrial buildings (turned into homes), cute little cottages and modern houses\n\nSpotted – pretty historic mansion"
