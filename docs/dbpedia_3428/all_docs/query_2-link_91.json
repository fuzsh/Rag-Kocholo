        "text": "We are planning to go to Drottingholm on August 22nd when we are in Stockholm for several days. I read another post about buying tickets in advance so I started looking at the website. There are so many options that I found it confusing and all of the various palaces, castles, Chinese Pavilion are timed entries then 60 minutes past your entry time. After choosing most of the attractions that interested me, I did see that the Drottningholm Palace entry includes the Chinese Pavilion and the Ridderholm Church includes the Royal Palace. If I selected The Royal Palace, it says that includes the Royal apts., Treasury, Museum 3 Crowns, Gustav III museum BUT it doesn't mention The Ridderholm Church. So depending on what I chose, it seemed to be different options. I am not planning to purchase any tickets until we are a few days out from our trip OR when we are a few days out from being in Stockholm in case the weather is a factor and we decide to choose an earlier day. I would appreciate any comments on what I have posted about the various ticket possibilities, recommendations and direct experiences anyone has had with this.\n\nI also looked at transportation from Slussen station, which is nearest to our hotel and it looks like around 45-50 minutes overall between walking, Train and bus. I saw that another poster mentioned taking a boat. Can anyone advise on whether one way or the other is preferable or do one of each to and from? And would there be a Stromma boat that leaves from the Slussen area? Thank you very much."
