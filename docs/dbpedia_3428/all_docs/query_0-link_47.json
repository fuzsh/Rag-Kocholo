        "text": "â“’Rebecca Bugge, All Rights Reserved\n\nDo not use without permission.\n\nThe home of the king and queen of Sweden - no, they do not actually live in the big palace in the middle of Stockholm, but in this much cosier creation just outside of Stockholm (in the small village of Drottningholm - which was actually built to house servants for the palace).\n\nThe name literally means the Queen's islet, and is older than the building itself. It used to refer to a palace built in 1580 for the queen Katarina Jagellonica - but that place burned down in 1661, and the current house is the one that was built to replace it. It was on order from the queen Hedwig Eleonora - at the time queen dowager but also regent for her son Karl (Charles) XI that was underage when his father (Karl X) died. The palace was designed by one of Sweden's most well known architects: Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, and after his death the work was continued on by his (equally famous) son Nicodemus Tessin the Younger. The queen used it as a summer residence, and as a place for hunting. The palace continued to be in fashion throughout the 18th century, and got a partly rococo interior during the time of queen Lovisa Ulrika.\n\nBut the place fell out of fashion with the new Bernadotte dynasty in the early 19th century, being to closely connected with the earlier regime. The last new add-ons to the place was electricity and modern plumbing at the beginning of the 20th century - after that the focus has been on conservation and preservation.\n\nThe royal family has lived there since 1981 (though the kids have moved out by now)."
