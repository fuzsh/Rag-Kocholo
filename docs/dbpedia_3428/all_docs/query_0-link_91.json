        "text": "A) Definition\n\nIn the context of internet and web browsers, a cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website or an application and stored on the userâs computer or mobile device. It is primarily designed to remember stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store), to record the userâs browsing activity or to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords and credit card numbers.\n\nSource: based on Wikipedia entry for âHTTP Cookieâ\n\nB) Cookiesâ types and usage\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nThese cookies are essential to enable you to browse around the website/application and use its features. Without them, services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.\n\nPerformance\n\nThese cookies collect information about how you use our website / application in order to improve the user experience. They do not collect information that identifies you: all information they collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.\n\nFunctionality\n\nThese cookies allow the website / application to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, text size and font or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. The information collected will not personally identify you and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.\n\nNote that our advertising services are actively opted-in and managed by signed-up users from their settings menu so that we do not make use of targeting and advertising cookies.\n\nWe also use other technologies that provide us with similar type of functionality such as URLs tracking and web beacons in order to obtain Log Data (as defined in our Privacy Policy)\n\nWe use Cookies and related technologies to provide the following functionalities and services:\n\nâ¢ Authentication\n\nâ¢ Access and usage of the Koralgo platform and the Payment Services\n\nâ¢ Security, investigations, site and product integrity\n\nâ¢ Improved profiling, insights and measurements\n\nâ¢ Platform navigation and enhancement of user experience\n\nâ¢ Legal and regulatory requirements\n\nâ¢ Monitor the operations and performance of the Platform\n\nâ¢ Research, product development, analytics and customer support\n\nC) Managing cookies settings\n\nâ¢ Acceptance of the cookie policy will be requested from you during you first visit through a âpop-upâ and âI Acceptâ button\n\nâ¢ You will be provided with the option to adjust the setting and select the âPerformanceâ or âFunctionalityâ option, or both.\n\nâ¦ This option remains available by amending the Cookie setting for registered users when logged in.\n\nâ¢ You will also be provided with the option to Reject the Cookie Policy, however this means that âStrictly Necessaryâ cookies will be disabled and our platform will therefore not be able to carry out some of its services such as bookings and payments.\n\nâ¦ Some functions such as searches and reading Seller related information (e.g. offers description or reviews) are likely to be possible but functionalities will be significantly limited. Note that your browser or device may also permit you to change your cookies settings. Disabling cookies use through this method may impact the ability of Koralgo to provide some of its services and the website / application may not work properly.\n\nD) Koralgo contact in relation with cookies policy\n\nFor queries relating to cookies policy, please contact us through this form and select the following topic: âTerms, Privacy and Cookiesâ.\n\nA) Definitions and why we have a privacy policy\n\nA privacy policy is a statement or a legal document that disclose the ways a company collects, uses, processes, handles and discloses a customer or clientâs data.\n\nThe need to have a privacy policy originates from regulatory requirements (applicable according to the location of data handling and processing but also your location) as well as from the use of third-party services that expressly require us to have one. The last reason is simply that we wish to be transparent with you, no questionable practice here.\n\nOur policy is based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a regulation set forth for people located in the EU. It is widely considered to offer the most comprehensive user right protection framework, which is why we are applying those principles to all our users and supplementing them with additional local requirements if needed.\n\nThe following privacy policy covers the Services provided by Koralgo, as defined in our Terms of Service.\n\nWhen this policy mentions âKoralgoâ, âweâ, âourâ, âusâ, it refers to the Koralgo company responsible for your information under this policy. The definition of all defined terms can be found in our Terms of Service agreement.\n\nB) Collection of information\n\nKoralgo collects information in two different ways.\n\n(i) Information you provide to us about you and others\n\nKoralgo requests the following type of personal information when using the Platform so that it can provide the Services:\n\nâ¢ Account information when you sign up such as your name, contact details, gender or date of birth\n\nâ¢ Personal information relating to other guests or customers when completing a purchase or booking such as name, delivery address or date of birth\n\nâ¢ Identity verification information such as Passport or ID details\n\nâ¢ Payment information such as credit card details to be able to process payments and complete bookings or purchase\n\nâ¢ Content of communications with us and between Customers and Sellers\n\nâ¢ For Sellers, details relating to the assets, products and offers marketed on the Platform, including data such as price and inventory\n\nThe legal basis for doing so is that the collection and processing of the above type of data is necessary to enable Koralgo to provide the Services, including the administration of bookings and processing of payments.\n\n(ii) Information we collect automatically\n\nWhen you navigate on and use the Platform, we collect various types of additional information:\n\nâ¢ Geo-location information through data provided by your mobile device GPS or IP address which enables us, for instance, to show your location and that of properties on a map\n\nâ¢ Log data and usage information such as the pages you visited or bookings you have made, access time and duration, crash data as well as cookie data\n\nâ¢ Payment transaction information such as amount, date and time, payment method and instrument for record keeping, fraud prevention and, generally, provide you with the Payment Services\n\nâ¢ Device Information such as hardware and software information\n\nâ¢ Cookies and similar technologies as per our Cookies Policy\n\nThe legal basis for doing so is to optimize the quality, reliability and overall user experience of the Platform as well as ensure the provision of the Services.\n\nC) Usage, processing and sharing of information\n\nGenerally speaking, we use, process and share your personal information for security and authentication purposes, to enable us to provide the Services and improve their relevance to you as well as to communicate with you or comply with our regulatory requirements.\n\n(i) Provide and improve our Services\n\nWe use and process the information so you can browse and navigate on our platform in a personalized and efficient matter and we can provide the Services. This includes sharing of information with Sellers to complete bookings or purchases.\n\n(ii) Security and authentication\n\nWe need to be able to identify and authenticate you in certain situations such as when you log-in on the Platform or detect and prevent fraud â for this, we need to access and use your personal information.\n\n(iii) Access and use the Payment Services [including data sharing]\n\nWe also share your personal information with our Payment Processor at the time a transaction is being processed. It is a leading player in that space who also has its own comprehensive privacy policy.\n\n(iv) Improve our profiling\n\nOne of the strengths of Koralgo is the ability to provide you with what our algorithm computes as the best offers based on your preferences and search parameters. To achieve this, using and processing personal information is key to improve our profiling, whether it is based on what you tell us or through other methods such as A/B testing or calibration through meta-data. In the latter case we use anonymized meta-data.\n\n(v) Provide analytics services to Sellers\n\nUsing anonymized personal data and meta-data relating to profiles, we can also provide ground-breaking analytic services to Sellers, so their offers and pricing strategy is optimized taking into account the potential customer base and competitive landscape.\n\n(vi) Provide marketing services to Consumers and Sellers\n\nSharing anonymized personal data and meta-data with Sellers also enables us to provide marketing services to both Customers and Sellers that are more relevant and targeted, respectively.\n\n(vii) Communicate with you\n\nBeing able to respond to your query, send you a booking or purchase confirmation or a reminder also requires us to use your personal information.\n\n(viii) Sharing with Services Providers and Corporate Affiliates\n\nWe use Service Providers globally who may need to access personal information. They are contractually bound to protect such information and restrict their use to the task they need to perform. We may also share personal information to provide the Services within the Koralgo group of companies.\n\n(ix) Regulatory requirements and business transfers\n\nCompliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions may also require us to share personal information. Finally, if Koralgo is involved in a merger, sale, reorganization or bankruptcy / insolvency, we may sell or share some assets as part of that transaction. If your personal information is part of those assets, we will notify you before the event takes place and your personal information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n\nD) Transfers, storage, and protection of information\n\nWe operate and share information globally, both internally and externally (suppliers, consultants or service providers) in accordance with this Policy. Your information may therefore be transferred internationally, stored and processed in different countries in order for us to be able to provide you with the Services and access to the Payment Services.\n\nKoralgo and the Platform developers have designed comprehensive security features and process to ensure the safety and integrity of the data stored by the Platform. We will retain your personal data as long as is required for you to use the Platform, enable us to provide the Services and in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nE) Cookies policy\n\nFull details can be found in our Cookies Policy, including how to manage your cookies related settings. The cookies we use are small files stored on your computer or mobile device to enable us to provide some services and functionality (Strictly Necessary cookies), improve navigation and user experience (Performance cookies) and provide enhanced, more personal features (Functionality cookies).\n\nF) Changes to the policy\n\nYou will be notified of any change to this Policy by email (at the address specified in your account) prior to the change becoming effective. If you continue to us the Services after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy.\n\nG) Your rights\n\nIn line with prevailing regulation, you have the following rights:\n\nâ¢ Data access and portability\n\nYou are entitled to know what personal data we have about you and the right to copy, transfer, or move this personal data to a different company.\n\nâ¢ Rectification\n\nYou have the right to have any inaccurate or incomplete personal data rectified\n\nâ¢ Right to erasure:\n\nYou essentially have the right to âbe forgottenâ by requesting us to delete your data and stop processing it. Note that we may retain specific data for security reasons (such as fraud prevention), legal or regulatory reasons as well as in our back-up systems for a limited time (depending on databases back up processes and cycles).\n\nâ¢ Restrict or objection to processing\n\nYou have the right to restrict personal data processing under certain circumstances or object to the processing of your data going forward (effectively withdrawing your consent).\n\nâ¢ Right to be informed\n\nThis is achieved by providing you with the information contained in this Privacy Policy, Cookies Policy and Terms of Service.\n\nH) How to access, modify or delete your personal information\n\nRetrieval and modification: you can access and update your personal information through your Account settings, once you are logged in on the platform\n\nDeletion: you can request for your personal information to be deleted at any time by contacting Koralgo administrators through the contact form. Once your request has been processed, your personal account will be closed and all related personal information deleted 90 days after the end date of your last live booking â this timeline is simply to cater for potential cases of disputes between users and sellers\n\nI) Koralgo contact in relation with privacy policy\n\nFor queries relating to privacy policy, please contact us through this form and select the following topic: âPrivacy and Cookies policiesâ."
