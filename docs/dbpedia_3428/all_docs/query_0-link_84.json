Rural Ekerö with sparkling water and green meadows is amazingly close to central Stockholm. During the day you spend cycling north on Färingsö and during the journey you can see some of Ekerö's churches originating from the early Middle Ages. A sign of how economically and politically important the Mälar Islands were in the 12th century.",

        "text": "1\n\nThe bike ride starts\n\nBoat trip from central Stockholm\n\nThe cycle tour starts with a boat trip at Klara Mälarstrand. From there you take a shuttle boat (line 89) to Tappström on Ekerö. The shuttle boats are part of the SL traffic's line network and you use the same tickets as in Stockholm's other public transport. The journey takes about 50 minutes, and there is a simple serving on board. It is possible to bring a bike on the boat to the extent possible and 30 bikes will fit on board the ice-free time, 10 bikes on the boat that goes when there is ice in Lake Mälaren.\n\n2\n\nEkerö city center\n\nArchitect Ralph Erskine's \"Mälarstad\"\n\nWhen you get off the shuttle boat at Tappström, cycle towards Ekerö Centrum. Here you can have a cup of coffee or have lunch if you feel like it. In the center there are several shops, restaurants and cafes to choose from. The area was designed by the famous architect Ralph Erskine and was completed in 1991. His original idea for the center of Ekerö was to create a \"Mälarstad\".\n\n3\n\nSkå church\n\nThe resurrected church\n\nAt the exit to Ekerö Centrum, continue right on Färentunavägen. Cycle over the Lullehov Bridge and continue on the Färentunavägen road. Cycle on the bike path up to Skå church. It was built in the 18th century after the old church burned in the 17th century. Adjacent to the church is the island's largest ancient burial ground, which shows that the countryside was of central importance early on. Once you have the chance to look at the church, return south on the bike lane the same way you came. Take the west on Stenhamravägen (it is possible to continue north on Färentunavägen, but it is quite heavily trafficked, even by heavy traffic).\n\n4\n\nSong Church\n\nSweden's oldest landscape painting\n\nCycle Stenhamravägen until the town of Stenhamra. There is a shop if you want to buy something to drink or eat. Take the northwest on Solbackavägen in the direction of Sundby. Take the Sanga-Säbyvägen road and cycle up to Sanga church. The church is incredibly beautiful on a promontory by Lake Mälaren. When it was built there was a mälarvik and the water almost reached the church wall. The church also contains what is considered Sweden's oldest landscape painting, from the year 1584. It is a portrait of the priest Bengt Thyneson with children, and the tragic story is that the painting came about when he and six of his children drowned.\n\n5\n\nFärentuna church\n\nContinue Sånga-Säbyvägen west and then north in the direction of Högby. You will arrive at the third church of the tour dating back to the 12th century. This time it is the church of Färentuna - a symbol of power and a refuge from the world's worries and wars. The Faeruna church has much to tell, and the name Faeringa (Fjärdinga-) tuna indicates that the town had great significance for Svearna's early military organization. The Tuna resorts were part of the country's solid defense and the parish was a refuge. The church's powerful tower to the east indicates this, and may have had a defensive function.\n\n6\n\nKungsberga\n\nTurn left (west) toward Stavsborgsvägen and cycle north. After a few kilometers you will come to Kungsberga, which is a place and idyllic community on northeast Färingsö and the turning point of this bike ride. Here is a well-stocked shop and pizzeria. Here is also the bike-friendly accommodation Lilla Sörgården, which is ideal if you want to stay overnight on Färingsö. You live in a rustic and charming country in fresh rooms and very close to the swimming pool and water view. In Kungsberga there are remains after a medieval building, and it may be that it has links to documents that the Swedish king Magnus Ladulås dated 1282 and 1287.\n\n7\n\nTime for the return trip\n\nYou have now cycled past three medieval churches and visited little Kungsberga. Ride back the same calm, curvy road and enjoy the view from the other side so to speak. If you initially want to take a different road back, you can round Kungsberga and cycle Kungsbergavägen south, enter Ölstavägen and then take the Sånga -byby road back the same way you came. You can also take the Färentunavägen past Skå and all the way back to the exit towards Ekerö Centrum. However, as we mentioned earlier, this stretch is more busy, even by heavier traffic, and there is no cycle path between Färentuna and Skå."
