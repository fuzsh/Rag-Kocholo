Handbook of Dynamical Systems, Vol. 1A

Editors Boris Hasselblatt and Anatole Katok

Elsevier 2002. ISBN 0-444-82669-6

The editors and authors dedicate this volume to Jurgen Kurt Moser (1928-1999) and Michael Robert Herman (1942-2000), who passed away while this book was being written. Both of them made seminal contributions to various areas of the theory of dynamical systems as well as to other mathematical disciplines. Their crucial influence was further enhanced through numerous major contributions of their students and collaborators. The deaths of Moser and Herman are tremendous losses for the mathematical community.
