        "text": "In 2015, I continued working on my ongoing research in the field of energy flow and its resolution for nonsinusoidal currents and voltages. At the end of 2014 I had a little break-through by going back to the classical sinusoidal phasor-based complex power model and generalizing the phasor concept to periodic nonsinusoidal waveforms using the Hilbert transform. This approach provides a consistent generalization of the classical power triangle to its time-varying counterpart. This sheds a completely new light on energy flow and additionally provided a deeper understanding of the power concept by Budeanu (1927). The latter has been the industrial standard for decades, but was recently abandoned for the wrong reasons as I could now explain.\n\nNevertheless, I was still very dissatisfied by the fact that the reactive power in my power theory, which for linear and time-invariant systems is strongly related to the physical mechanism of magnetic and electric energy storage, cannot be associated with the rate of change of some potential function in time. The same kind of lack of physical fundaments can be found in all other power models. For this reason, I was about to abandon this research for once and for all as my principle of performing science is: “first get the physics right, the rest is mathematics” (originally from Rudy Kalman, but often brought forward by another giant in the field of systems theory, Jan C. Willems, who sadly passed away in 2013). This principle did not seem to apply to this particular problem.\n\nSo I decided to leave the subject, at least for some time, and was thinking about writing a paper stating that all power theories must be artificial and that this is the main reason why hundreds of researchers are still debating over this controversial topic – even over 120 years after the problem was first brought to attention by Steinmetz (1892). Meanwhile, apart from finalizing a few papers as a co-author in completely different directions, I worked on a related, but more abstract and mathematical oriented, subject in the context of port-Hamiltonian systems and Dirac structures with Arjan van der Schaft (RUG). Complexifications of Dirac structures and port-Hamiltonian systems to be precise. What stroked me is that I soon arrived at exactly the same kind of problems: even though complex Dirac structures dictate the existence of (generalized) power and energy balance equations, I was not able to find an associated Hamiltonian that made sense (holomorphic potentials or state functions did not yield the desired results). However, with regard to the rich properties surrounding analyticity, I knew there must be a way, but I could not put my finger on it (yet).\n\nIn November last year, I decided to give the power business one more chance and started looking at the electromagnetic field aspects of energy flow. Soon I found out that a retired professor from the University of Massachusetts, named Gerald Kaiser (now living in Portland, OR), had been asking the same question in the context of the Poynting Theorem. Recently he found out that by complexifying time to t + is, and interpreting s as reactive time (measured in seconds reactive [sr]), it is possible to set up an imaginary power balance in terms of the rate of change of reactive energy in reactive time (not in regular time). Although the introduction of imaginary time seems very unusual (its commonly used in other fields of physics though; remember Stephan Hawkins’ book about the universe for example), the mathematics just dictate that it is the only way to set up a balance law for reactive power. Additionally, but not less important, it also finally provides a logical and physical explanation to the units of VAr (Volt-Ampere reactive). Without the notion of reactive time this industrial standard unit is rather ad hoc. This, in my opinion, is great stuff and I am super happy I came across it. Serendipity in action again?"
