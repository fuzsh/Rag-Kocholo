        "text": "http://www.ams.org/notices/200011/mem-moser.pdf\n\nWikepedia:\n\nJürgen Kurt Moser or Juergen Kurt Moser (July 4, 1928, Königsberg, East Prussia – December 17, 1999, Schwerzenbach, Kanton Zürich, Switzerland) was a German-American mathematician.\n\nHe completed his undergraduate education at and received his Ph.D. from the University of Göttingen in 1952, studying under Franz Rellich. After his thesis, he came under the influence of Carl Ludwig Siegel, with whom he coauthored the second and considerably expanded English language edition of a monography on celestial mechanics.\n\nHaving spent the year 1953 at the Courant Institute of New York University as a Fulbright scholar, he emigrated to the USA in 1955. He became a professor at MIT and later at New York University. He served as director of the Courant Institute of New York University in the period of 1967–1970.\n\nIn 1970 he declined the offer of a chair at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.\n\nAfter 1980 he was at ETH Zürich, becoming professor emeritus in 1995.\n\nHe was director of the Forschungsinstitut für Mathematik at ETH Zürich in 1984 - 1995, where he succeeded Beno Eckmann and lead a rebuilding of the ETH Zürich mathematics faculty.\n\nMoser was president of the International Mathematical Union in 1983 - 1986.\n\nHe won the first George David Birkhoff Prize in 1968 for contributions to the theory of Hamiltonian dynamical systems, the James Craig Watson Medal in 1969 for his contributions to dynamical astronomy, the L. E. J. Brouwer Medal of the Royal Dutch Mathematical Society in 1984, the Cantor Medal of the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung in 1992 and the Wolf Prize in 1995 for his work on stability in Hamiltonian systems and on nonlinear differential equations. He was elected to membership of the National Academy of Sciences in 1973 and was corresponding member of numerous foreign academies such as the London Mathematical Society and the Akademie der Wissenschaften und Literatur, Mainz .\n\nAt three occasions he was an invited speaker at the quadrennial International Congress of Mathematicians , namely in Stockholm (1962) in the section on Applied Mathematics, in Helsinki (1978) in the section on Complex Analysis, and a plenary speaker in Berlin (1998). In 1990 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bochum. The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics established a lecture prize in his honor in 2000.\n\nPersonal biography\n\nHis mother Ilse Strehlke was a niece of the violinist and composer Louis Spohr. His father was the neurologist Kurt E. Moser (July 21, 1895 – June 25, 1982), who was born to the merchant Max Maync (1870–1911) and Clara Moser (1860–1934). The latter descended from 17th century French Hugenot immigrants to Prussia. Jürgen Moser's parents lived in Königsberg, German empire and resettled in Stralsund, East Germany as a result of the second world war. Moser attended the Wilhelms-Gymnasium in his hometown, a high school specializing in mathematics and natural sciences education, from which David Hilbert had graduated\n\nin 1880. His older brother Friedrich (Friedel) Moser (August 31, 1925 - January 14, 1945) served in the German army and died in Dodrowolsk, Russia. He married the biologist Dr. Gertrude C. Courant (Richard Courant's daughter, Carl Runge's granddaughter and grandniece of Emil DuBois-Reymond) on September 10, 1955 and took up permanent residence in New Rochelle, New York in 1960, commuting to work in New York City. In 1980 he moved to Switzerland, where he lived in Schwerzenbach near Zürich.\n\nHe was a member of the Akademisches Orchester Zürich.\n\nHe was survived by his younger brother, the photographer Klaus T. Moser-Maync from New York, his wife, Gertrude Moser from Seattle, their daughters, the theater lighting designer Nina S. Moser from Seattle and the mathematician Lucy I. Moser-Jauslin from Dijon, and his stepson, the lawyer Richard D. Emery from New York City.\n\nMoser played the piano and the cello, performing chamber music since his childhood in the tradition of a musical family, where his father played the violin and his mother the piano. He was a lifelong amateur astronomer and took up paragliding in 1988 during a visit at IMPA in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n--------------------------\n\nhttp://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Moser_Jurge...\n\n--------------------------\n\nBorn July 4, 1928\n\nKönigsberg, East Prussia\n\nDied December 17, 1999 (aged 71)\n\nSchwerzenbach, Switzerland\n\nCitizenship American\n\nNationality German\n\nFields Mathematics, Mathematical Analysis, Dynamical Systems\n\nInstitutions New York University, MIT, ETH Zurich\n\nAlma mater University of Göttingen\n\nDoctoral advisor Franz Rellich\n\nNotable students Mark Adler\n\nCharles Conley\n\nPaul Rabinowitz\n\nKnown for KAM theory, Chern-Moser invariants, Moser normal form, Moser iteration, Nash-Moser theorem, Moser's trick\n\nInfluences Henri Poincaré, George David Birkhoff, Carl Ludwig Siegel\n\nInfluenced Michel Herman , John Mather, Peter Sarnak, Eduard Zehnder\n\nNotable awards George David Birkhoff Prize, Wolf Prize"
