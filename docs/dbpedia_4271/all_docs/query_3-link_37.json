        "text": "Overall, these resources should provide the necessary background to understand the KAM theorem and its applications.In summary, the conversation discusses the difficulty in understanding the KAM theorem due to a lack of background knowledge on resonant tori and dense periodic orbits. The recommended resources for gaining a better understanding of KAM theory are \"KAM and Foliation Theory\" by Jürgen Moser and lecture notes from the course \"Topics in Hamiltonian Dynamics\" by Serge Tabachnikov. These resources provide an accessible and tutorial-style approach to understanding the theorem and its applications.\n\nRelated to What books should I read to fully understand KAM theory?\n\n1. What is the KAM theory?\n\nThe KAM theory, or Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory, is a mathematical theory that studies the behavior of dynamical systems, specifically conservative systems, over long periods of time. It provides a framework for understanding the stability and chaotic behavior of these systems.\n\n2. What makes a good KAM theory book?\n\nA good KAM theory book should have clear and concise explanations of the concepts and theories, as well as plenty of examples and exercises to help readers understand and apply the material. It should also have a comprehensive coverage of the topic, including both theoretical and practical aspects.\n\n3. Are there any recommended authors or books for learning KAM theory?\n\nSome recommended authors for learning KAM theory include V.I. Arnold, Jürgen Moser, and Yakov G. Sinai. As for books, \"Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics\" by V.I. Arnold and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" by Jürgen Moser and Jürgen Pöschel are highly regarded in the field.\n\n4. Is prior knowledge of advanced mathematics required to understand KAM theory?\n\nYes, a strong background in advanced mathematics, including calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra, is necessary to fully understand KAM theory. Some knowledge of topology and analysis may also be helpful.\n\n5. How can KAM theory be applied in other fields?\n\nKAM theory has applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics. It can be used to study the stability of planetary orbits, analyze the behavior of nonlinear systems in engineering, and understand the dynamics of economic systems, among others."
