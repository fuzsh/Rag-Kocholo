Moser, (1928 - 1999)\n\nMini Biography\n\nBorn, July 4, 1928 in Königsberg, now Kaliningrad (the town is known to Mathematicians from the \"Königsberg problem\" and to philosophers because Kant has taught there at the University).\n\n1947, arrival in Göttingen, from Königsberg (East Prussia) who was then occupied by Russia. Moser's trip was dangerous, under gun fire (see the book C. Reid: Courant in Göttingen und New York).\n\n1952, PhD at the University of Göttingen under F. Rellich's (1906-1955) direction.\n\n1953, emigration to United states with a Fulbright fellowship.\n\nMoser, who became a U.S. citizen, was a research associate at the New York University in 1957 when he left to become visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . He returned to New York University in 1960, becoming a professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.\n\n1962, Twist theorem, a pillar in KAM theory. Kolmogorov and Arnold were met by Moser during a trip to the Soviet Union.\n\n1967-1970 he was director at the Courant Institute in New York. He remained a professor there until 1980.\n\n1980, rebuilds Mathematics Research Institute at ETH , Switzerland's equivalent of MIT . He served as director of its Research Institute for Mathematics until 1995.\n\n1982, Georg Cantor Medaille\n\n1994/1995, Wolf Prize: \"For his fundamental work on stability in Hamiltonian mechanics and his profound and influential contributions to nonlinear differential equations.\"\n\nFrom 1983-86, he was president of the International Mathematical Union.\n\nDecember 17, 1999, \"Time Magazine Dec. 31 1999: \"Died. Juergen Moser, 71, renowned mathematician who advanced scientists' understanding of how the solar system works and aided the development of particle accelerators; of cancer; in Zürich.\""
