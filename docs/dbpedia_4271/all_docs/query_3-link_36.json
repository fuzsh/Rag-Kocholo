        "text": "I'm surprised this hasn't been mentioned yet, but Rostislav Grigorchuk's 1980 paper in which he constructs the Grigorchuk group is just under two pages:\n\nOn the Burnside problem on periodic groups, Funkts. Anal. Prilozen. 14, No 1 (1980) 53-54.\n\nAt the time, no one realized the full significance of this group, but some of the more remarkable properties are proven in the paper.\n\nA. Karatsuba and Yu. Ofman (1962). \"Multiplication of Many-Digital Numbers by Automatic Computers\". Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences 145: 293–294.\n\nProved that multiplication of $n$-digit numbers could be done in less than quadratic time (thus disproving a conjecture by Kolmogorov) and provided the first divide-and-conquer algorithm for arithmetic.\n\nJürgen Moser (1965), On the Volume Elements on a Manifold , Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 120, No. 2 (Nov., 1965), pp. 286-294\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/1994022\n\nBesides the many powerful applications of the famous \"Moser argument\" (or \"Moser trick\"), the local version gives a very nice and elegant proof of the classical Darboux Theorem.\n\n(For a nice summary of this and other papers by Jürgen Moser, I would recommend Hasselblatt & Katok: The development of dynamics in the 20th century and the contribution of Jürgen Moser (a short discussion of the paper mentioned above can be found at p.17-18))\n\nI read all 30 previous answers, and then did \"search\" on this page with my browser, and to my surprise I did not find Picard's name.\n\nPicard's proof of the Picard Little Theorem certainly qualifies for this list. See, for example Littlewood's Miscellany, where he discusses the question, \"Can a PhD thesis consist of one line?\"\n\nPicard's one-line proof started an enormous body of literature in XX century, beginning with Nevanlinna theory and including Hyperbolic groups.\n\nTo be sure, Picard's original paper (CR 88(1879)1024-7) is slightly longer than one line, but the proof itself (assuming the background that was well-known in 1879) is really one line, as reproduced in Littlewood:-)\n\nA slight generalization of this is called Picard's Great Theorem, the only theorem that I know, which has the word \"Great\" in its standard name:-)\n\nJ.-C. Yoccoz called\n\nCarl L. Siegel, Iteration of analytic functions, Ann. of Math. 43(2) (1942), 607–612.\n\na \"brief but historic article\". In only 6 pages (including all necessary background) Siegel gave the ﬁrst positive solution to a small denominator problem. This had been a major unsolved issue for over 60 years, and was a big thorn in the side for Poincaré. Siegel's paper is also credited with inspiring Kolmogorov to start the circle of ideas that led to KAM Theory. Buff, Henriksen, and Hubbard did not hesitate in calling it “one of the landmark papers of the twentieth century.”\n\nDetails\n\nPretty late to the party here but Kantorovich's \"On the translocation of masses\" from 1942 is two pages. It gave a radically new look on the Monge problem of optimal transportation and can be seen as the starting point of an immense body of work on optimal transport and distances in probability spaces.\n\nMR0011027 Chern, Shiing-shen A simple intrinsic proof of the Gauss-Bonnet formula for closed Riemannian manifolds. Ann. of Math. (2) 45, (1944). 747–752\n\nQuoting from Andre Weil's review: ``In order to understand the true nature of the Euler-Poincaré characteristic of a (differentiable) manifold, one has to consider it as a topological invariant of a fibre-space invariantly attached to the manifold, namely, of the space of tangent unit-vectors (or \"tangent sphere bundle'') to the manifold. It is therefore only natural that an intrinsic proof of the Gauss-Bonnet formula (which expresses the Euler-Poincaré characteristic as the integral of a differential form invariantly attached to the Riemannian structure) should involve the consideration of that fibre-space. This is how the author proceeds here; and his proof, as he states, is merely the simplest example of a general method in the differential-geometric study of fibre-spaces, which is developed in the paper reviewed below.\"\n\nThe proof is truly intrinsic, as Chern did not use an isometric imbedding of a Riemannian manifold into an Euclidean space. And it is simple to follow.\n\nSerre's GAGA isn't as short as some of the others, but it's still just over 40 pages (which is quite short by the standards of Serre/Grothendieck-style algebraic geometry at the time -- e.g. FAC is about 80 pages, and of course there are things like EGA...), and it's still GAGA.\n\nLawvere's paper \"Quantifiers and sheaves\" (1970 International Congress of Mathematicians at Nice, vol. 1, pp. 329--334) was the first publication of his work with Tierney on elementary topoi. It contains an amazing amount of information in just 6 pages.\n\nMore generally, the writings of Bill Lawvere have the highest theorem/sentence ratio I've seen (though Leonid Levin comes pretty close).\n\nFunny that Witt is not mentioned here. Indeed, his papers\n\nTheorie der quadratischen Formen in beliebigen Körpern\n\n(introducing Witt cancellation, Witt decomposition, the Hasse-Witt invariant, the Witt ring and in a little sidestep proving that every quadratic form in $\\ge 5$ variables over a $\\mathfrak{p}$-adic field is isotropic)\n\nand\n\nZyklische Körper und Algebren der Chrakteristik $p$ vom Grad $p^n$\n\n(introducing Witt vectors, Artin-Schreier-Witt theory and determining the structure of complete discrete valuation rings)\n\nat 13 resp. 14 pages are among the longest he has ever published. But they both appeared in the remarkable volume 176 of Crelle's Journal, and given their importance, I think they still make up a reasonable answer.\n\nThe paper \"Zum Hilbertschen Nullstellensatz\" (Mathematische Annalen, vol. 102, page 520, 1930) in which Rabinowitsch (aka. Rainich) introduced his famous trick is one small page long - the body consists of just 13 lines!\n\nThe paper consists of a slick proof of the Nullstellensatz, but the usefulness of the trick of course goes beyond that, e.g. it is used to show that $GL_n$ is an affine algebraic group...\n\nThe 1949 paper by R.C. Bose \"A Note on Fisher's Inequality for Balanced Incomplete Block Designs\" arguably gave birth to the linear algebra method in combinatorics which has since been used by many to solve highly non-trivial problems as discussed here: Linear algebra proofs in combinatorics?\n\nThe paper is 2 pages long: https://doi.org/10.1214/aoms/1177729958\n\nHere's a description of Bose and his work from the manuscript Linear Algebra Methods in Combinatorics by Babai and Frankl:\n\nThe affiliation listed on Bose’s paper is the Institute of Statistics, University of North Carolina. Before taking up residence in the U.S. in 1948, Bose worked at the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta. One of the most influential combinatorialists of the decades to come, Bose was forced to become a statistician by the lack of employment chances in mathematics in his native country. A pure mathematician hardly in disguise, he reared generations of combinatorialists. His students at Chapel Hill included D. K. Ray-Chaudhuri, a name that together with his student R. M. Wilson (so, may be a grandson of Bose?) will appear several dozen times on these pages for their far reaching extension of Bose’s method."
