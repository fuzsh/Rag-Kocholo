        "text": "Eddie Peng, 40, who first made his acting debut in the Taiwanese drama Tomorrow has been in the industry for 20 years. With his career focused in Mainland China in recent years through films such as Dante Lam’s The Rescue, Eddie was among the many residents stuck at home during the strict Shanghai lockdown that has been lasting over a month.\n\nOn May 5, a netizen spotted the Taiwan-born Canadian actor at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and raised speculations that he was leaving for Australia. While it’s understandable for people to leave as restrictions were lifted in select areas, some felt that leaving the country so soon could be seen as fleeing. Later on, Eddie Peng revealed his location by posting a photo of Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbor. He also reportedly responded to a fan’s messages on social media and stated he is there for work.\n\nAnother thing that’s been drawing attention recently are Eddie Peng’s lockdown looks since he’s been seen sporting unkempt hair, stubble and wearing average joe clothes. The actor joined netizens in poking fun at his look through his IG stories that read, “Celebrities already (look) like this, everyone no longer need to feel pressured.”\n\nEddie Peng is currently in the middle of another 14-day period of isolation now that he’s in Hong Kong."
