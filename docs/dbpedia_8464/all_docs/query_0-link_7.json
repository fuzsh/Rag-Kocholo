From when Eddie’s memory began forming, his father was never by his side. Instead, his mother was a hardworking career woman, having to earn money to support him and two of his older sisters. Every day, she had to work till 2-3am in the middle of the night before being able to get some rest. Therefore, the heavy responsibility of taking care of Eddie was handed over to his maternal grandmother. As the only male offspring in the family, Eddie was loved and doted on dearly so his personality turned out to be optimistic and pure. His maternal grandmother used all her savings on migrating to Canada with him. Having lived in Canada with his mother and his two older sisters for many years, Eddie originally pursued tertiary education in the University of British Columbia, majoring in Economics. However, in order to enter the showbiz industry, he was willing to give up his academics and leave his family to develop his career in Taiwan."
