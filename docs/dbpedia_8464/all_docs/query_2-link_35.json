        "text": "9th January 2024 – (Hong Kong) Eddie Peng, the 41-year-old Taiwanese heartthrob, has been relentlessly promoting his latest film “I Did It My Way” in mainland China. Yesterday, Peng arrived at Hong Kong International Airport in a simple attire, where he was warmly greeted by enthusiastic fans. Moments from the fan interaction were later shared on social media platforms. It is reported that the actor arrived early in Hong Kong to attend the highly anticipated movie premiere tonight.\n\nIn the footage captured during the fan interaction, Eddie Peng was seen graciously accepting gifts from his fans and expressing gratitude for their unwavering support. However, keen observers couldn’t help but notice the visible signs of tiredness on his face, possibly due to his hectic promotional schedule. Surprisingly, Peng’s unblemished face was not immune to imperfections, as some acne marks were visibly present. This physical manifestation could be a warning sign indicating the actor’s lack of rest, suggesting potential issues with his digestive and respiratory systems. Medical experts suggest that the appearance of acne could be linked to poor detoxification functions in the spleen and stomach. Fans are undoubtedly concerned about their beloved heartthrob’s well-being and sincerely wish him a speedy recovery after completing his promotional duties."
