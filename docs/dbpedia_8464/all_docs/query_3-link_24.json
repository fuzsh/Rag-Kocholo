He is exactly 6 feet tall. He knows how to speak Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and sign language.\n\nSome TV shows he has been in include: Sound of the Desert, Chinese Paladin, Scent of Love, and My Sassy Girl. He has won 3 Meager Awards. He won the best actor award in Hong Kong 2015, best supporting actor in Hong Kong 2014, and Hundred Flowers Best Newcomer 2014.\n\nMovies he is in include: Rise of the Legend (2014), Call of Heroes (2016), To the Fore (2015), The Great Wall (2016), and Cold War 2 (2016). Those are his most recent movies. He has been acting since 2005. He has many fans. A nickname he has gained from his fans and friend is “Yan Yan”.\n\nHe is one of the best models in my opinion. His acting is very good as well. I have only ever seen 2 or 3 movies with him in it, but the times I have seen him, he was great. I would recommend to watch and listen to his stuff."
