        "text": "Singer Angela Chang returns\n\nMonday September 22, 2008 China\n\nTaiwan singer and actress Angela Chang is back on the scene after a half-year hiatus due to health problems. She served as one of the torch bearers in the run up to the Beijing Olympics and any lingering concerns about her health can now be fully put to bed. On today's \"The List\", we review Angela Chang's career.\n\nAngela Chang was born in Taiwan in 1982, emigrating to Canada with her family when she was 12. She was fond of singing from an early age, attending many singing contests in Canada. 15-year-old Chang won first place at the \"BBC Star\" singing contest by belting out Chang Yusheng's popular song \"The Days Without Smoking\".\n\nHowever, it was in Taiwan that Chang began to establish her professional music career. In 2001 Chang signed her first contract with an agent... spending the following year undergoing tough training: recording, dancing, running, swimming and other physical exercises. Chang didn't complain about the hardship because she knew all her efforts would be worth it the moment she stepped on stage.\n\nChang's extraordinarily powerful voice is a rarity among Chinese singers. Her early songs were tailored to capitalize on this advantage. In 2003, Chang's first album \" Adventure of True Love\" was released and her music style finally took shape.\n\nChang's first foray into the small screen came in 2002. She stood out from a dozen candidates and starred as the heroine in the TV drama \"My MVP Lover\".\n\nChang demonstrated an acting talent as impressive as her voice. Her popularity soared to new highs after portraying up-and-coming Asian diva Yi Tianbian in the TV drama \"Romance in a Dolphinarium\". She also sang the theme song of the drama, providing her with another hit tune.\n\nAngela Chang is well on the way to becoming the most popular singer in Taiwan. As her albums come out one-by-one, die-hard fans find themselves mesmerized more and more by her songs and her cute face.\n\nBut the pressure of her new life as a superstar finally caught up with Chang last year. She became so exhausted that she decided to take a six month-long break in Canada. With her health restored, Chang is back and ready to write a new chapter of her singing career.\n\nAngela has certainly always had the talent to stand out on her own, but in the crowded mando-pop world, music videos are so often critical to singers' success. Today, we'll take a look at some of the most popular MVs in the Chinese speaking world at the moment.\n\ncredits to asianfanatics\n\nEveryone knows Jay Chou likes magic, but I bet no one has seen the Jay with \"super powers\", not only this but to fight alongside the world famous Transformers. In the new season of commercials for one of the brands he is spokesperson for, Jay Chou is going to turn into a fighter who goes in and out of the skyscraper to rescue Angela Zhang who is kidnapped by Magatron.\n\nUnder the shinning sun, Jay Chou, the future soldier, stands on the shoulder of Optimus Prime to use the last bullet, they put on a great show of the hero rescuing the damsel in distress. \"Attacked\", \"Rescue\", \"Counter Attack\", all these are portrayed with comics, they are full of action and story. This is the first time Jay Chou and Angela Zhang have done a real life comic.\n\nTranslation: jaychoustudio\n\nSource: eastday\n\ncredits to asianfanatics\n\nNEWS\n\nAngela Zhang becomes Johnson’s spokesperson for 3rd consecutive year; will release album in August\n\nMulti-talented queen Angela Zhang yesterday attended a press conference for Johnson’s new eye product. Besides wearing a sleeveless blue top, and white shorts, she specially put on Johnson’s contact lenses, displaying the charm in her bright eyes, definitely electrifying everyone! Angela expressed that she pays a lot of attention to her own eye make-up, and the contact lenses is her secret weapon to let her soul shine out of the window. She said she is very happy to be able to be Johnson’s spokesperson for the third consecutive year.\n\nReporters at the event were concerned about Angela’s recent health, and she expressed that she is somewhere between skinny and fat. In the past she was always very busy with her work, and even if she ate 7 meals in a day, she wouldn’t get fat. But now she places great importance on her health, and leading a normal diet, so she won’t become a paper girl anymore, is that hard for everyone to get used to?\n\nTalking about her new album progress, Angela revealed that it is expected to release at the end of August this year, so she hopes fans will wait patiently: “This time, we collected 300 songs, and my record company chose 50 for me to try out, afterall, good sings are hard to find, that’s why the album release is slightly lagging.” As for acting, Angela is not ruling out trying for the big screen, challenging a martial arts film or a police-type film: “I want to play a female who very much has personality, I don’t want to be confined to little cute roles or love dramas.” So which male actor does she wish to collaborate with? Angela expressed, Andy Lau & Aaron Kwok are artists she admires, and she hopes to get the chance to collaborate with them in the future.\n\ncredits to Sarah @ http://asianfanatics.net for translation\n\nSource: Linfair Records\n\nI can't wait til she comes back. It's been way to long."
