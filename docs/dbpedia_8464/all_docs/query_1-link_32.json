It is the 47th name on the Hundred Family Surnames poem.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe character (彭) is composed of 壴 (zhǔ meaning \"drum\") and a pictograph (shān representing \"beats\"). More commonly used as a surname, this character is also an adjective, meaning \"big\".[1]\n\nOrigin\n\n[edit]\n\nThe surname Peng (彭) is traced to the legend of Peng Zu, God of Longevity, who legend tells lived 800 years. During the Shang dynasty, Jian Keng, a descendant of Zhuanxu, was granted the feudal territory Dapeng (Great Peng), and later adopted the name, Peng Zu.[2][3]\n\nDistribution\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2019 it was the 31st most common surname in Mainland China.[4]\n\nOf the top 30 cities in China, 彭 ranked 9th most common in the city of Changsha.[5]\n\nKorean surname\n\n[edit]\n\nThe same surname character is also found in Korea, where it is pronounced Paeng (Korean: 팽). According to South Korea's 2000 Census, 2,825 people in 918 households had this surname.[6] There are two major clan lineages for this surname, each with a different bon-gwan (seat of a clan lineage, not necessarily the actual residence of clan members). The more common one, Jeolgang Paeng (1,578 people in 515 households), claims descent from Paeng U-deok (彭友德), who came from Zhejiang (pronounced Jeolgang in Sino-Korean reading), China to the Korean peninsula during the reign of King Seonjo of Joseon (r. 1567–1608).[7] The less common one, Yonggang Paeng clan (795 people in 259 households), claims descent from Paeng Jeok (彭逖), who came from Jinling, China to the Korean peninsula in the retinue of Princess Noguk during the reign of King Chungjeong of Goryeo (r. 1348–1351). Yonggang (Ryonggang) is located in an area that became part of North Korea after the division of Korea.[6][8]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nAdrian Pang (彭耀顺; born 1966), Singaporean Chinese actor\n\nDiana Pang (彭丹; born 1972), Hong Kong dancer and actress\n\nJacqueline Pang (彭晴; born 1974), Hong Kong radio announcer and author\n\nPang Siew Fum (彭秀芳), Malaysian drug trafficker serving life imprisonment in Singapore\n\nStella Pang (彭慧芝), Hong Kong engineer\n\nPrajogo Pangestu (彭雲鵬), Indonesian tycoon\n\nPeng Bo (彭勃), Olympic diving medalist\n\nPeng Chang-kuei(彭長貴), Taiwanese chef.\n\nPeng Cheng-min (彭政閔), a Taiwanese baseball player\n\nPeng Chong, a former Chinese politburo member\n\nPeng Dehuai (彭德怀), the Chinese Communist Party military leader, Marshal of the People's Republic of China.\n\nPeng Lei (彭蕾), Chinese business executive at Alibaba Group\n\nPeng Lifa (彭立发; born 1974), Chinese physicist and democracy activist\n\nPeng Liyuan (彭丽媛), Wife of Chinese Paramount leader Xi Jinping, public figure in her own right.\n\nPeng Ming-min (彭明敏), Taiwan independence activist, DPP politician and first opposition candidate in a Taiwan presidential election\n\nPeng Pai (彭湃), a pioneer of the Chinese agrarian movement and peasants' rights activist\n\nPeng Sheng-chu, Director-General of National Security Bureau of the Republic of China\n\nPeng Shilu (彭士禄), the \"father of China's nuclear submarines\" and the \"father of China's naval nuclear propulsion\", as the first chief designer of China's nuclear submarines\n\nPeng Shige (彭实戈), a Chinese mathematician\n\nPeng Shuai (彭帅), professional tennis player\n\nPeng Wan-ru (彭婉如), Taiwanese politician and feminist\n\nPeng Xiuwen (彭修文), conductor and composer\n\nPeng Yang (彭羕), Han Dynasty official who served Liu Bei\n\nYiliang \"Doublelift\" Peng, a professional League of Legends player for Team Liquid\n\nPeng Zhen (彭真), a leading member of the Chinese Communist Party\n\nThe Pang Brothers (born 1955), Hong Kong, twin brothers Danny Pang Fat (彭發) and Oxide Pang Chun (彭順), screenwriters and film directors\n\nPeng Qi, fictional character from the 14th century novel, Water Margin\n\nEddie Peng Yu-Yan (彭于晏), Canadian-Taiwanese actor\n\nPeng Yuchang (彭昱暢), Chinese actor\n\nPeng Xiaoran (彭小苒), Chinese actress\n\nPeng Fai-nan (彭淮南), Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of China (1998–2018)\n\nPong Cheng-sheng (彭振聲), Deputy Mayor of Taipei\n\nPeng Jiasheng (彭家聲), leader of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army\n\nPeng Yanhui, Chinese gay rights activist\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of common Chinese surnames\n\nPang (surname)\n\nPenck (surname)\n\nFive Great Clans of the New Territories\n\nFanling Wai"
