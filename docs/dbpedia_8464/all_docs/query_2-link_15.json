        "text": "4 Jul â€“ Eddie Peng's agent recently clarified that the Taiwanese actor wasn't breaking any rules despite being fined for bringing fruit back to Taiwan.\n\nAs reported on Epoch Times, the Taiwanese actor was recently seized by the Customs after bringing in an illegal fruit in his backpack upon arrival in Taipei from Xiamen, and was fined NTD 3,000 for breaking the rules.\n\nHowever, his agent had since clarified the issue, saying that the backpack actually belonged to her.\n\n\"Eddie was just being a gentleman and decided to hold the backpack for me. But then I saw that he was stopped by the customs,\" she said.\n\nThe agent stated that the fruit was actually a leftover from their flight's meal.\n\n\"I didn't want to waste food, so I brought it back,\" she said, though added that they will obey the law.\n\nIt is noted that the Taipei Customs prohibit all perishables including fruits from entering the country."
