About Eddie Peng

Eddie Peng (b. 1994) is a self-taught, Taiwanese-American photographer and poet born in Munster, Indiana. After withdrawing from medical school, he began experimenting with combining photography and poetry after receiving an old film camera from a friend’s dad. His work is a meditative practice that aims to elevate familiar, everyday scenes to something of divinity and to help himself and others find beauty in day-to-day life. The photographs deal with subjects such as impermanence, adulthood/aging, longing, desire, family, love, and loss. His work is influenced by Japanese ideas and practices such as Wabi-sabi, Kintsugi, and haiku. His mother spent her early adult life in Japan and first introduced him to Japanese culture growing up. Peng was an also avid violinist and guitarist growing up and studied anthropology as an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University.
