        "text": "The 3,200 Soldiers from the 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team and six other Wisconsin Army National Guard units will return to Wisconsin beginning Tuesday. Leading the way will be approximately 115 Soldiers, mostly from the Fort Atkinson-based Troop A, 105th Calvary, followed by the remaining 3,000 Soldiers throughout the month. All are scheduled to return to Volk Field where they will be met by senior National Guard officials, a military band and family members -- homecomings are not open to the general public. Following an initial reunion with their families and a brief official \"welcome home,\" the Soldiers will travel to nearby Fort McCoy to begin about five days of demobilization processing before being released from active duty.\n\nThe 32nd Brigade, augmented by six other Wisconsin Army National Guard units, was ordered to active duty Feb. 1, 2009 and deployed to Iraq in April and May following two months of training at Fort Bliss, Texas.\n\nDuring training and while in Iraq, the brigade was organized into 27 company-sized units. Rather than operating as a brigade, the 32nd was tasked with a variety of missions throughout Iraq. These missions included forward operating base administration, base defense, area security, quick reaction forces, freedom of movement security support, detainee guard force operations at theater internment facilities, closing the largest internment facility in Iraq, transferring detainees, operating an academy to train Iraqi corrections officers, inspecting detention facilities, securing and administering the International Zone in Baghdad, and turning over U.S.-controlled properties back the government of Iraq. The brigade's Soldiers operated around the clock, most of them working at least 12 hours a day - day after day, week after week, for eight full months in Iraq.\n\nHaving accomplished their mission, each company began transferring responsibilities to units from the Texas National Guard's 72nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team at the end of December and will continue to do so as they prepare to return to Wisconsin in January. (For a detailed account of the 32nd Brigade's deployment see: http://dma.wi.gov/deployment )\n\nThe deployed Soldiers of the 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team come from units in 36 Wisconsin communities:\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company, 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team -- Camp Douglas\n\n1st Squadron, 105th Cavalry (Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition)\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Troop, 1st Squadron, 105th Cavalry -- Madison\n\nTroop A, 1st Squadron, 105th Cavalry -- Fort Atkinson\n\nTroop B, 1st Squadron, 105th Cavalry -- Watertown\n\nTroop C, 1st Squadron, 105th Cavalry -- Reedsburg\n\n2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company (-), 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry -- Appleton\n\nDetachment 1, Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry -- Clintonville\n\nCompany A (-), 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry -- Waupun\n\nDetachment 1, Company A, 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry -- Ripon\n\nCompany B, 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry -- Green Bay\n\nCompany C, 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry -- Fond du Lac\n\nCompany D, 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry -- Marinette\n\n1st Battalion, 128th Infantry\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company (-), 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry -- Eau Claire\n\nDetachment 1, Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry -- Abbotsford\n\nCompany A, 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry -- Menomonie\n\nCompany B, 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry (-) -- New Richmond\n\nDetachment 1, Company B, 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry -- Rice Lake\n\nCompany C (-), 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry -- Arcadia\n\nDetachment 1, Company C, 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry -- Onalaska\n\nCompany D, 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry -- River Falls\n\n1st Battalion, 120th Field Artillery\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Battery, 1st Battalion, 120th Field Artillery -- Wisconsin Rapids\n\nBattery A, 1st Battalion, 120th Field Artillery -- Marshfield\n\nBattery B, 1st Battalion, 120th Field Artillery -- Stevens Point\n\n32nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company (-), 32nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion -- Wausau\n\nDetachment 1, Headquarters Company, 32nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion -- Merrill\n\nCompany A (Engineer), 32nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion -- Onalaska\n\nCompany B (Military Intelligence), 32nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion -- Madison\n\nCompany C (Signal), 32nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion -- Antigo\n\n132nd Brigade Support Battalion\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company, 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Portage\n\nCompany A (-) (Distribution), 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Janesville\n\nDetachment 1, Company A, 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Elkhorn\n\nCompany B (Maintenance), 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Mauston\n\nCompany C (Medical), 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Milwaukee\n\nCompany D (-) (Forward Support), 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Baraboo\n\nDetachment 1, Company D, 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Madison\n\nCompany E (-) (Forward Support), 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Waupaca\n\nDetachment 1, Company E, 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Appleton\n\nCompany F (-) (Forward Support), 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Neillsville\n\nDetachment 1, Company F, 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Eau Claire\n\nCompany G (-) (Forward Support), 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Mosinee\n\nDetachment 1, Company G, 132nd Brigade Support Battalion -- Wisconsin Rapids\n\nAdditional units to augment the 32nd are based in 12 Wisconsin communities.\n\n257th Brigade Support Battalion\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 257th Brigade Support Battalion -- Oak Creek\n\nCompany A, 257th Brigade Support Battalion -- Whitewater\n\nCompany B (Support Maintenance), 257th Brigade Support Battalion -- Kenosha\n\n108th Forward Support Company -- Sussex\n\n32nd Military Police Company (-) -- Milwaukee\n\nDetachment 1, 32nd Military Police Company -- Oconomowoc\n\n829th Engineer Company (-) (Vertical) -- Chippewa Falls\n\nDetachment 1, 829th Engineer Company -- Richland Center\n\nDetachment 2, 829th Engineer Company -- Ashland\n\n1158th Transportation Company (-) -- Beloit\n\nDetachment 1, 1158th Transportation Company -- Black River Falls\n\nBattery A, 1st Battalion, 121st Field Artillery -- Racine"
