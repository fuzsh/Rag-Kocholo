        "text": "In the Pokrovsk direction, the largest concentration of Russian forces is observed. This includes two groups of troops.\n\nThis was reported by Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military-political analyst of the \"Information Resistance\" group, on the \"Espreso\" TV channel.\n\n\"In the Pokrovsk direction, units from the Russian Armed Forces' \"Center\" group, which were redeployed back in October 2023, are being used. These include units of the 2nd and 41st combined-arms armies of the Russian Federation, as well as the 90th tank division. They also have support from the Russian Armed Forces' \"South\" group. Therefore, the largest grouping is concentrated there, with two groups of Russian troops simultaneously,\" the expert explained.\n\nAccording to him, Novohrodivka and Hrodivka are obstacles for the occupiers on their way to Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad.\n\nHe added that one of the tasks of the occupiers in this direction is to form flanks. In other words, the Russians aim to reach the left bank of the Vovcha River.\n\n\"The Russians aim to secure the northern flank – this includes villages and settlements along the Kazennyi Torets line. This will allow them to create conditions for offensive actions towards Vozdvyzhenka. By capturing Vozdvyzhenka, they will attempt to reach the 05-04 highway. All these actions are related to creating conditions in the medium term – reaching Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad. In the short term, it is to improve conditions for conducting an offensive campaign in the city of Toretsk and the Toretsk agglomeration,\" Kovalenko added.\n\nRead also:"
