        "text": "Students attending the medical Basic Officer Leadership Course #BOLC cool off by inserting their arms in an Arm Immersion Cooling Station (AICS) at Camp Bullis, TX. AICS works to cool the body through the process of convection and conduction. Heat transfers from the hot arms and the circulating blood to the cooler water. The cooled blood flows back to the core to extract additional body heat and reaches the arms again to continue the same cycle. Under direct supervision, soldiers immerse their hands and forearms into cool water (below 80 degrees Fahrenheit). The soldier is timed with a stopwatch by the cadre utilizing the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command immersion chart. Soldiers pump their legs to increase blood flow while dunking to increase circulation. Once the time has elapsed, the Soldier will raise their hands up in the air and walk away. This is one of the preventative safety measures along with hydration, misting fans, ice sheets, and rest periods measures #MEDCoE is taking to students and cadre mitigate against the heat during field training exercises. #ArmyMedicineStartsHere #ArmySafety #TRADOC #USACAC #ArmyMedicine #JBSA #32dMEDBDE #187thMEDBN\n\nAfter more than a week of grueling challenges, our MEDCoE Team took Third Place in the #TRADOCBestSquad competition!

Soldiers and civilians of the 187th Medical Battalion reaffirmed their commitment to Briscoe Elementary School by signing their Adopt-A-School charter before handing out much-needed school supplies to students and their families. https://lnkd.in/gVbsusWN The 187th Medical Battalion has participated in the Fort Sam Houston Adopt-A-School program for over nine years by sponsoring supply drives, holiday gifts donations and sports days. They also mentor students by visiting the school throughout the school year.
