Its goal was to create a more efficient, responsive, and less cumbersome logistics organization.\n\nThe impact on the Army-wide medical services through the creation of a Medical Brigade under the newly established Field Army Support Command is described in the article above.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nThe three Medical Groups attached to the newly formed 7th Medical Brigade (Coffey Barracks, Ludwigsburg) were:\n\n30th Medical Group, Krabbenloch Kaserne, Ludwigsburg\n\n31st Medical Group, Cambrai-Fritsch Kaserne, Darmstadt\n\n62nd Medical Group, Army Hospital, Bad Kreuznach\n\nUnits attached to the 30th Med Gp (list might not be complete):\n\n128th Evacuation Hospital (Smbl), Krabbenloch Kaserne, Ludwigsburg\n\n4th Surgical Hospital (Mbl), Krabbenloch Kaserne, Ludwigsburg\n\n32nd Surgical Hospital (Mbl), Hindenburg Kaserne, Würzburg\n\nHq/Hq Det, 56th Medical Battalion, Wharton Barracks, Heilbronn\n\n417th Medical Ambulance Company, Wharton Barracks, Heilbronn\n\n556th Medical Ambulance Company, Wharton Barracks, Heilbronn\n\n651st Medical Ambulance Company, Wilkin Barracks, Kornwestheim\n\n546th Medical Clearing Company, Wharton Barracks, Heilbronn\n\n595th Medical Clearing Company, Wharton Barracks, Heilbronn\n\n574th Medical Detachment, Ludendorff Kaserne, Kornwestheim\n\n757th Medical Detachment, Flak Kaserne, Ludwigsburg\n\nSome of the units attached to the 31st Med Gp (list might not be complete):\n\n7th Evacuation Hospital (Smbl), Cambrai-Fritsch Kaserne, Darmstadt\n\n5th Surgical Hospital (Mbl), Nachrichten Kaserne, Heidelberg\n\n31st Surgical Hospital (Mbl), Michael Barracks, Hoechst\n\nHq/Hq Det, 36th Medical Battalion, Yorkhof Kaserne, Hanau\n\n427th Medical Ambulance Company, Yorkhof Kaserne, Hanau\n\n557th Medical Ambulance Company, Yorkhof Kaserne, Hanau\n\n695th Medical Ambulance Company, Yorkhof Kaserne, Hanau\n\n547th Medical Clearing Company, Michael Barracks, Hoechst\n\n4th Platoon, 421st Medical Company (Air Ambulance), xxxx\n\nSome of the units attached to the 62nd Med Gp (list might not be complete):\n\n2nd Evacuation Hospital (Smbl), Army Hospital, Bad Kreuznach\n\n8th Evacuation Hospital (Smbl), Marceau Kaserne, Landstuhl\n\n15th Evacuation Hospital (Smbl), Army Hospital, Münchweiler\n\n46th Surgical Hospital (Mbl), Marceau Kaserne, Landstuhl\n\n565th Medical Ambulance Company, Smith Barracks, Baumholder\n\n517th Medical Clearing Company, Army Hospital, Bad Kreuznach\n\n629th Medical Clearing Company, Air Station, Pruem\n\n15th Medical Detachment (Hcptr Amb), Army Hospital, Bad Kreuznach\n\nThe 62nd Med Gp is comprised of Hq/Hq Det; three evacuation hospitals; one surgical hospital; three medical companies (one clearing and two ambulance); a helicopter detachment and a dispensary detachment (S&S June 7, 1965).\n\nFor additions or corrections, please contact the webmaster (see email link at top of page) 1968\n\n(Source: STARS & STRIPES, Oct 8, 1968 )\n\nThe 7th Medical Brigade, headquartered at Flak Kaserne, Ludwigsburg, has been placed under the command of US Army Medical Command, Europe. Previously (for the past three years), the unit was part of Seventh Army Support Command.\n\nCO of the 7th Med Bde is Col Roger A. Juel; CG of USAMEDCOMEUR (and USAREUR Surgeon) is Maj Gen James T. McGobony.\n\nUSAMEDCOMEUR controls all medical functions, facilities and resources (units) in USAREUR and Seventh Army except those medical elements organic to major troops (such as medical battalions of the divisions).\n\n(Source: Email from Elaine Everett Shelton, wife of James Dwight Everett, former member of the 762nd Med Det, Karls Ksn)\n\nI cannot find any information on the 7th Army which was stationed at Karls Kaserne for sure in 1967 and 1968. My husband was a Medic stationed there in a clinic, which also did physicals for the short timers going back to the states. I remember there was also barracks in part of the same building.\n\nKarls Kaserne was located in Ludwigsburg and we were fortunate enough to live on the economy in a nearby little village called Kornwestheim. I can see it clearly in my mind, but can find no trace of it on the Internet. His 7th Army patch as I remember it, was like an upside 7? (Webmaster Note: this was the 7th Med Bde Patch - see above) He finished up his two years as Specialist 4th Class.\n\nI was delighted to see you had emailed a picture of the VERY patch I was referring to. I looked at the Google picture ( ) of Karl's Kaserne and that is definitely the very place he was stationed. I could actually see the building that housed the dispensary and everything. It looked vacant though with no cars visable, so I am assuming it is no longer being used.\n\nAfter I sent the email to you, I remembered my husband was part of the 762nd Medical Detachment. I still haven't found any information about that. I found a picture just a few minutes ago, that by miracle wasn't ruined and this is my husband standing in front of the sign at his dispensary, at Karls Kaserne, Summer of 1968.\n\nMy husband who passed away was James Dwight Everett. He trained at Ft. Polk, La. and received his specialty training in San Antonio. He and another boy in his unit came down on two seperate sets of orders. One set had them going to Viet Nam and the other set had them going to Germany. Their superior officer by the goodness in his heart, let them choose their destinations. GOD IS GOOD!! Medics didn't fare very well in Viet Nam. We had a good life even though he died at an early age, 100% disabled. Nothing could ever erase the happy memories I have of those times.\n\nThank you so much for all your help. I greatly appreciate it.\n\nIf you have more information on the history or organization of the 7th Medical Bde, please contact me. 7TH MED BDE ORGANIZATION (MARCH 1966) - Footnotes\n\nI have attempted to compile an organizational chart for the 7th MED BDE showing the brigade's structure after the reorganization of 7th Army support units under COSTAR. Corrections and any relevant details are very much appreciated (webmaster). Sources used for compiling the org chart: FM 8-6, Medical Service, Field Army, June 1965 (doctrine) and STATION LIST, 31 March 1966. (This is a draft and subject to change as new information or corrections are submitted.)\n\n(1) 234th Medical Equipment Maintenance Detachment. (Were there any other TOE 8-500 units assigned directly to HQ 7th Med Bde?)\n\n(2) 67th Medical Depot.\n\n(3) 421st Air Ambulance Company with detachments located at various airfields.\n\n(4) 485th Preventive Medicine Service Unit.\n\nReturn to chart"
