At present rates of growth, we believe this Namibian force could take over all ground force operations against the insurgents in two to three years. While remaining dependent on South African support, the SWATF could by then rival or surpass the ground combat forces of most black African states. Gradually shifting the burden of the fighting to Namibian troops and several units of mercenaries has spared South African casualties, reduced costs, and defused opposition to the war at home. Pretoria wants these territorial troops to police the transition to independence in Namibia, rather than entrust the task to a UN force they believe would favor the insurgents. Following independence, Pretoria hopes the territorial units will become the core of a Namibian national army, thus ensuring continued South African influence with the regime. SWATF has approximately 11,000 troops, including about 8,000 Namib- ians and 3,000 South Africans. Although black volunteers fill the ranks, most officers, sergeants, and technicians are whites seconded from the South African Army. The SWATF is organized primarily as a light infantry force for counterguerrilla operations against the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Most combat units are in north- ern Namibia, where they block SWAPO's path from guerrilla bases in southern Angola to targets among the white-owned settlements and property in central Namibia. Operationally, SWATF supplements and takes its lead from the South African Defense Force contingent in Namibia, which numbers about 7,000 troops. SWATF also depends upon South Africa for logistic, air, and naval support. 25X1 25X1 In preparing SWATF for its new role, South Africa has been molding an effective fighting unit. Whereas Namibians comprised about 20 percent of all government troops in northern Namibia in 1980, they make up 61 percent today, according to senior officials in Windhoek. In 1984 alone, SWATF grew by 3,000 men, according to the commander, and Windhoek expanded the pool of available military manpower in October when it raised the age limit for compulsory military service to 54 and began to reg- ister males of all races. Pretoria has begun 25X1 Secret ALA 85-10034 IA 85-10027 April 1985 -, , ---- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 to equip SWATF with heavy equipment, and some units now have artillery and armored vehicles. South Africa began to reorganize its own border defenses near southern Namibia and Botswana last year, probably in preparation for an eventual troop with- drawal from the territory Pretoria could bolster SWATF quickly by transferring to it most of the in- dividually seconded South Africans and the mercenary units in Namibia. South Africa offers bonuses to those officers and technicians who agree to remain with SWATF permanently, and current plans call for most seconded officers to remain with SWATF for some time following a withdrawal from Namibia of South African units, South African officials are considering a transfer of-the South African Security Police's \"Koevoet\" force and the South African Army's 32nd \"Buffalo\" Battalion These two units comprise about 3,000 troops, most of whom are former Angolans, Rhodesians, ex-SWAPO guerrillas, and Namibians. The development and increasing capabilities of SWATF present Western negotiators with a problem that probably was not envisioned in 1978 when the UN plan for Namibian independence was drafted. That plan calls for a 7,500-man UN force to disband all territorial forces while confining to bases in Namibia up to 8,000 SWAPO guerrillas and 1,500 South African troops. The UN force appears inadequate for these tasks, and we believe Pretoria has no intention of allowing SWATF to be disbanded. Incorporating SWATF into a Namibian national army would be a difficult undertaking that would require modifying the UN plan, but, if it could be arranged, it would improve prospects for postindependence stability. Such an integration of forces would avoid dispersing thousands of ex-combatants disgruntled over their lost pay and poor prospects for reemployment. The integration process would have to avoid combining units of hostile ethnic and regional backgrounds, however, to lessen the risk of factious violence. In our view, SWATF's growing maturity enhances South Africa's political flexibility in Namibia. Pretoria could rely on SWATF, with South African air and logistic support, to defend a puppet regime in Windhoek, thus enabling a South African withdrawal without allowing SWAPO to take over. Alternatively, it could use the force as a proxy to continue its counterinsurgency campaign and postpone Namibian independence indefi- nitely. If Pretoria believed that including SWATF in a national army would guarantee leverage over any government that came to power in Windhoek, such an integration of forces might encourage South African acceptance of independence for Namibia.

Gradually shifting the burden of the fighting to these territorial troops, as well as to elite units of ex-Rhodesian and Angolan mercenaries, has spared South African casu- alties, reduced costs, and defused antiwar sentiment at home. This paper describes and assesses that army, the South West African Territory Force (SWATF), along with the Namibian police and two mercenary units that South Africa may transfer to Windhoek's control. It discusses Pretoria's motives and progress in grooming the Namibian forces and the implications for US policymakers seeking to implement the UN independence plan. SWATF's full-time combat force includes 10 light infantry battalions trained and equipped for counter- insurgency, according to embassy reporting. Six of the battalions are ethnically distinct, that is, each is recruited from a different black tribe, and averages 850 soldiers. The other four battalions are ethnically mixed and contain about 700 troops each. A multira- cial brigade of reservists is available in Windhoek as a territorial reserve. This combined-arms brigade al- ready has about 1,500 troops, and its structure indi- The South West African Territory Force SWATF headquarters in Windhoek ordered all units in February 1985 to plan for a withdrawal of South African forces by January 1987 and for SWATF to take over the defense of Namibia at that time, The Embassy believes Pretoria accelerated preparations last year, and that substantial progress in enlarging the force has been made. In 1980 the SWATF Commander stated publicly that Namibians constituted only 20 percent of the government troops in northern Namib- ia; in February 1985, the territorial Administrator General announced that they totaled 61 percent. Republic on short notice. Strength and Organization SWATF has about 11,000 troops, including approxi- mately 3,000 South Africans individually seconded as officers and technicians, or members of South African Army units attached to SWATF on a rotational basis, according to senior officers in Windhoek. A separate contingent of about 7,000 soldiers from the South African Defense Force (SADF) reinforces SWATF in Namibia, and additional forces can arrive from the cates,t eventually will include several thousand. According to US officials, all government forces in Namibia are commanded by Maj. Gen. George Meiring, a career South African Army officer.' As the commander of SWATF, he is required to clear military operations with Administrator General Willem van Niekerk, who reports to the president of South Africa. As the commander of the South Afri- can Army contingent in Namibia, however, Meiring takes orders directly from the head of the South African Army in Pretoria, Lieutenant General Geldenhuys. Military command is centralized in Windhoek. ' In South Africa, the Air Force, Navy, and Medical Corps are separate services not under the Army's authority. Although their units in Namibia-along with those of the South African Security Police-report directly to the appropriate service headquarters in Pretoria, they also cooperate closely with the Arm commander in Windhoek, 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 FT-;-;----- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 Pretoria first used black territorial troops in Namib- ia about 1974 when it began to organize several ethnically distinct battalions, each in a differ- ent tribal homeland, to replace white South African units near the Angolan and Zambian borders. It hoped that the locally recruited troops would gain civilian cooperation in stemming guerrilla infiltration from the neighboring states, Infiltration soon increased, however, when Portugal withdrew from Angola in 1975, and the new regime in Luanda permitted SWAPO to set up military bases close to the Namibian frontier. As a consequence of the stepped-up infiltration, plans for a few wholly black battalions evolved into a design for a 30,000-man, multiracial Namibian army, Major General Geldenhuys, who took com- mand of all government forces in Namibia in 1977, began implementing the ambitious scheme. In the north, he strengthened the existing territorial battal- ions and created new multiethnic units made up of Namibians of different tribes along with white and black troops from South Africa. In central Namibia, he recruited whites, coloreds, and blacks for part- time service in a territorial reserve. Members of all ethnic groups also were enlisted into the expanding 67 military units were transferred from the South African Army to SWATF. These included the black battalions, the multiracial reserve, local militia units, and various headquarters and support ele- ments, according to the government gazette. Although the force was placed under the nominal authority of the Administrator General in Namibia, a South African general exercises operational control of all Namibian troops, and SWATF remains part of the South African Defense Force until independence. Pretoria has future roles in mind for the Namibian soldiers. Since 1977, South African officials have urged allowing them-rather than a UN force-to monitor the transition to independence. A senior military officer in Windhoek said last October that the plan to use UN troops for the purpose remains \"unacceptable. \" If SWATF. were incorporated into a Namibian national army at independence, Pretoria might use the army to defend a client regime. Alter- natively, the loyalist troops could be a counterweight to the guerrillas if SWAPO were to join in a coalition government. Rather than allow SWATF to come under the control of a SWAPO-dominated govern- ment, however, the force would be stripped of its equipment and abandoned, police and militia forces. With great fanfare, South Africa consolidated the Namibian units in August 1980 to form the South West African Territory Force (SWATF). In doing so, 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 since the police and usually has a South African Air Force 25X1 25X1 1980 Namibia has been divide for military purposes into eight area commands-seven sectors and one separate battalion zone.

The four northern commands closely approximate the administrative boundaries of tribal homelands, and together they make up the Border Operational Area (BOA). Within the BOA, each sector headquarters also coordinates the activities of element attached for support.'

Most combat units are in Sectors 10 (Owambo), 20 (Kavango), and 70 (Caprivi Oos). There are relatively few government forces in sparsely populated Kaokoland because the South-West Africa People's Organiz ti on (SWAPO) historically has not been active there. however, that South Africa is build-__ ing a new base in northern Kaokoland to counter a SWAPO buildup across the border. Kaokoland was separated from Sector 10 in 1981 and designated the 102nd Battalion area, but it may now be known as Sector 80, according to attache reporting. Most SWATF reserve and support units are located south of the BOA. Pretoria probably intends for SWATF's 91st Brigade at Windhoek in Sector 40 to become the primary reaction force in the event of a large-scale attack on Namibia. The requirement for reliable and quick response would explain why the 91st is the only SWATF unit directly subordinate to General Meiring's headquarters, rather than to a sector command. Until the brigade's recruitment, training, and equipping are completed, however, South Africa's powerful 61st Mechanized Battalion Group at Operet in Sector 30 will remain the terri- tory's primary reserve. Most logistic facilities are in Sector 50, and SWATF forces in Sectors 30 and 60 are limited to only a few militia units Operations SWATF operations are focused on preventing infil- tration into Namibia by insurgents based in Angola. Sector 10, Owambo, is the most heavily defended region in Namibia, and SWATF units are deployed throughout the sector to form a defense in depth against the guerrilla threat from Angola. Owambo is the area of greatest tribal support and primary infil- tration routes for SWAPO. Forward units assigned to Sector 10 include special forces teams on extended patrols in southern Angola that gather intelligence and carry out covert opera- tions, They include elements of SWATF's small and secretive 1st South West Africa Reconnaissance Regiment (1st SWARR), as well as the South African Army's 32nd \"Buffalo\" Battalion and 5th Reconnaissance Com- mandos. Their tactics include \"pseudo operations\" in which black troops disguised as guerrillas interrogate and terrorize local residents in order to turn them against SWAPO, Sector 10's main defenses near the border are manned by four SWATF battalions, the 51st through 54th, according to embassy reporting. These units also 25X1 25X1 25X1 guard the hydroelectric facility at Ruacana and the 25X1 roads, powerlines, and water pipelines that lead from there deeper into Owambo. They are SWATF's most capable battalions, composite units of ethnically mixed Namibian units and strong South African contingents Other light infantry units saturate Sector 10 with patrols for area and route protection. They are the ethnically distinct 101st (Owambo) Battalion, most of the 201st (Bushman) and 202nd (Kavango) Battalions, and special tracker units with horses, motorcycles, and dogs, according to US officials. Aiding them are SWATF's part-time commandos and the Namibian police. The increasingly capable SWATF played a major role in Operation Askari, the last major South African incursion into Angola, which took place from Decem- ber 1983 to January 1984 and was intended to disrupt SWAPO's then imminent annual rainy season infil- tration. Prior to Askari, SWATF rarely was commit- ted outside Namibia, Troops from SWATF's 101st and 201st Battalions, and possibly other Namibian units, joined nearly 2,000 South African soldiers in the Askari operation and together penetrated more than 100 kilometers north of the border, 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 2J/\\ I At the same time, SWATF's ethni- 25X1 cally mixed battalions at the border probably con- ducted numerous sweeps a short distance into Angola.

Many Namibian blacks volunteer for military service because of the attractive pay. Pay scales in SWATF are on a par with those in the South African Army and are far higher than civilian wages.' Eight years ago, when the first black battalions were established and conditions of service were unknown, the authori- ties were forced to assign recruitment quotas to the village headmen Again, when conscription of nonwhites was 25X1 introduced south of the BOA in 1981, and the first intake of draftees fell short of expectations, press- gangs were used to.fill the ranks, according to visiting US officials. Today, however, coercion is unnecessary. The commander of Sector 10 told US officials last year that he routinely gets 10 times as many volun- teers as he is authorized to accept. Recruitment and Training In our judgment, the stepped-up pace of SWATF recruitment and training since last year gives cre- dence to the view that South Africa is hastening the transition to full Namibian responsibility for counter- insurgency operations. Windhoek's claim that SWATF expanded last year by about 3,000 troops is probably close to the mark. According to the govern- ment announcement, SWATF accepted 3,000 re- cruits-from the 9,000 who volunteered-and 1,500 conscripts. In the same period, some 1,500 troops completed their active-duty obligation, and 26 securi- ty force members were killed, according to govern- ment announcements. Until last year, South African officials indicated that SWATF accepted fewer vol- unteers and probably grew by only about 1,500 SWAPO's guerrilla ranks Namibian males of all racial groups 16 to 25 years old have been liable for the draft since 1981, but conscrip- tion has always been implemented selectively, accord- ing to embassy reporting. Virtually all white males enter the armed forces or police for two years upon completing high school or university, according to embassy reporting. Exemptions are available on medi- cal and narrowly drawn religious grounds. A small percentage of nonwhite males living outside the BOA are drafted by use of a random draw, according to the US defense attache. Nonwhites living in the BOA have never been conscripted, apparently because Windhoek wants to avoid stimulating an exodus of black Namibian draft dodgers that might swell The South African authorities paved the way for expanding conscription in October 1984. They en- larged the pool of available military manpower by raising the age limit to 54 for compulsory service, and they began to register males 17 and over regardless of race, political sympathies, or prior service. An Army announcement in mid-November claimed that over 17,000 whites, blacks, and mixed-race Coloreds had registered at centers set up in Sector 30. When the first of these registrants are inducted, they probably will become reservists in conventional reserve and local militia units. The SWATF Commander favors increasing such part-time forces because they are less expensive to maintain than are a large police force and professional standing army. Government recruiters appear to be making headway in Owambo, a traditionally difficult area for recruit- ment. According to journalists and South African officials, the 101st Battalion was chronically under strength for years due to the reluctance of Owambos to fight their fellow tribesmen in SWAPO. With nearly 2,000 soldiers today, however, the 101st ap- pears to be SWATF's largest battalion. South African officers claim the civilians will support whichever side has control of the local area. If so, that would help to explain the government's success in recruiting troops for the 101st Battalion. It has been difficult for SWAPO to infiltrate Owambo ever since South Afri- ca occupied southern Angola in 1981, and, in our judgment, matters got worse for the guerrillas when Luanda agreed in February 1984 to restrain SWAPO 25X1 in exchange for Pretoria's promise to withdraw its troops from Angola. 25X1 Until recently, SWATF's recruits received their train- ing from South Africans. Trainees were sent to the South African center at Walvis Bay for four months of basic training followed by six months of instruction in a speciality, according to embassy reporting. Spe- cialized instruction not available in the territory has SWATF recruits earn over $180 per month, a private over $360, and a company sergeant over $600. Moreover, civilian unemploy- ment in Namibia has risen over recent years due to contraction of the economy and uncertainty about prospects for independence. -- ~ -T-_ Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 Figure 3 Ethnic Groups in Namibia \\,.Rehoboth TS WA >Baste r and BASTERS, Otjiwarongo nunau -v O WA KAVANG :tavangoland Eroshaj/-d' Pan Tsumeb H M A N R Grootfontein' B U Busnmanland r Hereroland Namibia e \\ y_J %Okahandja ~weRoP i v ~. *WINDHOEK i Homeland LOZI Major tribe 0 100 200 Kilometers 0 100 200 Miles \\~ueecese p~esen'a1~on .s 1 n ar,lY au tro~~l alive Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 Botswana Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 Secret year since 1979. been given in South Africa.

General Meiring's otherwise integrated SWATF and South African staff in Windhoek has separate sec- tions for personnel, finance, and logistics because of the different sources of manpower and funding. Among the differences, for example, is that logistics records for the South African contingent are comput- erized, but those for the Namibian units are handled In our view, Pretoria is minimizing the risks of the transfer of security responsibility to Namibia by maintaining the readiness of mercenary and police 25X1 forces. South Africa could bolster the territorial forces quickly by transferring to Namibian control some of its units in northern Namibia that are composed mostly of non-South Africans; this could involve as many as 3,000 troops of the South African Security Police's \"Koevoet\" force and the South African Army's 32nd \"Buffalo\" Battalion.

A review of SWAPO's operations over recent years, however, shows that only about 10 percent of the guerrillas attempt to infiltrate Namibia each year. Incapable of a military victory over far stronger South Africa settled on a defensive strategy of exclusion and containment, executed with aggressive tactics and an economical level of effort that we .believe can. be sustained indefinitely. SWATF counters SWAPO first by attempting to prevent insurgent infiltration into Namibia. SWAPO has no military bases in the territory, and, in our judgment, it cannot conduct large-scale infiltration from Zambia or Botswana because of vast distances, inhospitable terrain, and the unwillingness of those governments to risk South African retaliation for aiding the insurgents. Because SWAPO has no choice but to operate from bases in Angola, SWATF is concentrated near the Angolan border behind fences, cleared strips, watchtowers, and minefields. The force is lightly equipped and well suited to patrol on foot, on horseback, or in mine-resistant vehicles to locate and destroy the infiltrators and their arms caches. With few exceptions, those guerrillas who manage to cross the border are contained in the northern Border Operational Area, where South African sources claim most of the insurgents are eliminated by incessant government patrolling. Military containment suc- ceeds in Namibia in part because it reinforces social, political, and geographic barriers that isolate SWAPO from the general populace. Owambo domi- nance of the insurgent group, for example, hinders SWAPO's efforts to gain wide support among Nami- bia's tribally fragmented people. Great distances and difficult terrain within Namibia also obstruct efforts to reach many groups. Although SWAPO correctly claims that it operates among the majority of black Namibians-concentrated as they are in the remote Border Operational Area-the guerrillas actually are confined to less than 15 percent of Namibia's territo- ry. The BOA is important to South Africa only as a labor reserve and a buffer zone between SWAPO's Angolan sanctuaries and the guerrillas' targets among the white settlements and the modern sector of the economy located farther south. Neither side can defeat the other, but SWATF and South African forces hold the initiative on the battle- field. Most firefights between the insurgents and territorial forces are initiated by the government side, or published in the press. SWA TF participates in cross-border raids into SWAPO's sanctuaries to disrupt plans andWestroy bases, retaliate for guerrilla attacks, and intimidate the insurgents' Angolan hosts. In Namibia, the government's aggressive patrolling denies the guerril- las rest, spoils their attacks, causes high attrition, and prevents the establishment of insurgent bases or, areas of durable control. SWATF is efficiently structured and employed. Non- South Africans are doing most of the fighting, and the use of Namibian troops saves transportation funds and reduces demands on scarce white manpow- er needed to run the South African economy. SWA TF and the South African Army use reservists to increase force levels quickly in time of need, and to reduce payrolls and economic disruptions at other times. Because most guerrilla infiltration takes place during the November to March rainy season when clouds and foliage enhance concealment and drinking water is available in the and countryside, SWAPO's attacks take on a seasonal rhythm. The predictable pattern of infiltration, and good South African intel- ligence, enable Pretoria to avoid being caught unpre- pared.

The unit's headquarters is at Oshakati in Sector 10, with major bases at Rundu in Sector 20 and Opuwa in the 102nd Battalion area. Ex-SWAPO members probably comprise about one- third of the force, although South Africans claim they total an improbable 70 percent, according to US officials in Windhoek. We do believe South African claims that most of the insurgents captured each year agree, albeit under pressure, to join the unit. Most Namibian members are Owambos because Koevoet recruits and operates mainly in Sector 10. Koevoet generally takes its pick of the constables graduated by police schools in the north each year, according to the press. Koevoet operates in 25- to 40-man groups in four armored personnel carriers, one supply vehicle, and a fuel truck, according to an authoritative South Afri- can defense journal. These self-sufficient units typi- cally patrol for a week or more searching for signs of the guerrillas. Once on a trail, they will pursue relentlessly, ignoring military and political bound- aries. Koevoet units frequently call for Air Force or other help once the guerrillas are run to ground northern Namibia. the unit tortures civilians to gain information and uses teams disguised as insurgents to terrorize the local residents and turn them against SWAPO. Koevoet troops are paid bounties for those they kill, and the unit has been authorized to execute prisoners under certain circum- stances. Hardened veterans of the 32nd Battalion and Reconnaissance Commandos have been shocked at discovering evidence of Koevoet atrocities, The Windhoek Supreme Court condemned a Koevoet policeman to death in December 1983 for murder, and it sentenced a second policeman to jail for his role in a murder, rape, and robbery. Should Pretoria decide to transfer to the Namibian police only a portion of Koevoet's personnel, it would be difficult for us to detect. Koevoet and a territorial police unit known as the Special Task Force are both territorial equipped with armored personnel carriers and infantry weapons, and they would be virtually indistinguishable in the field. Moreover, the transfer could be arranged easily. US officials report that Brig. Sarel Strijdom, who commands the South Afri- can Security Police in Namibia, including Koevoet, also controls the Special Task Force in Windhoek. 32nd Battalion. Another unit that may not withdraw from Namibia after independence is the Army's \"Buffalo\" Battalion.

The Buffalo unit is an all-volunteer motorized infan- try battalion of about 1,000 black Angolan soldiers and 200 South African officers and sergeants,F- It was formed from hundreds of Portuguese-speaking former guerrillas of the FNLA, who fled to Namibia in 1976 after losing their struggle with the Soviet-supported MPLA. The atta- che reports that the battalion's headquarters is at Buffalo Base in the western Caprivi Strip. Its forward base at Rundu is in western Kavango, and a mobile command post probably is in southern Angola. The battalion has participated in every major incur- sion into Angola since 1978, and it penetrated the deepest of all South African units in January 1984 when it spearheaded Operation Askari, According to the US attache, three or four of the battalion's seven infantry compa- nies are normally on six-week patrols in southern Angola. Deployed units are controlled by Sector 10's headquarters and resupplied by helicopter. Four com- panies from the battalion were temporarily assigned as the South African contingent to the Joint Monitor- ing Commission in Angola in May 1984, according to the attache. Last year's sudden training of black officer candidates from the 32nd Battalion may signal that Pretoria intends to withdraw South African officers and leave the unit in Namibia. Pretoria brought 15 trainees to the Republic for English-language instruction, ac- cording to the South African Army newspaper. They returned to the battalion in November to become training and administrative officers. Territorial Police South Africa also has strengthened the territorial police to block a SWAPO takeover in Namibia, according to US embassy reporting. Efforts to enlarge the police force circumvent the UN independence plan, which calls for confining to bases in Namibia or removing all military forces during the transition to independence while employing the police alongside UN troops to maintain order. Even as South Africa was agreeing to the UN plan in 1978, the Namibian Commissioner of Police announced that the territorial police were being strengthened, mainly in Owambo. Several months later, US officials reported that South Africa tried to conceal an expansion of the territorial police. At that time it transferred to them about 1,500 Namibian home guards, previously trained and com- manded by the South African Army. The new police- men were renamed Special Constables, dressed in camouflage, and employed as a paramilitary counter- insurgency force In September 1980, one month after SWATF was formed, the South-West Africa Police (SWAP) was established under the authority of the Administrator General, according to the government gazette. All functions of a national police force were transferred to it, except that Pretoria retained control of the Securi- ty Police and all intelligence units. According to the US Embassy, seconded South African policemen were given the choice of joining SWAP permanently or returning to duty in the Republic. Maj. Gen. Dolph Gouws, then head of the South African Police in Namibia, was among the first to accept a permanent position with SWAP-as its commander SWAP operates only in Namibia, and we believe that operations into Angola indeed are generally left to the military. SWAP has three principal elements, according to US officials in Namibia. The small and lightly armed Criminal Investigation Division handles detective work. The Special Task Force, equipped with armored personnel carriers and crew-served weapons, is re- sponsible for riot control and counterterrorism in urban areas. Similar to the Koevoet unit in firepower and mobility, it is a significant supplement to the military's counterinsurgency capabilities. The para- military Special Constables are armed with infantry weapons and guard government officials, buildings, At present rates of growth, training, and equipping, we believe Namibian forces could take over all ground force operations against SWAPO in two or three 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 Secret years. They might do so in one year if Pretoria permanently transferred to Namibian control most of the 6,000 South African Defense Force and Police personnel already serving in SWATF, the 32nd Bat- talion, and the Koevoet Police. We expect SWATF to accept more volunteers and expand conscription in 1985. South Africa could begin to reduce its separate military contingent in Namibia as soon as mid-1985, when the current rainy season and heightened insur- gent activity ends 'South Africa began to reorganize its border defenses near south- ern Namibia and Botswana last year, probably in anticipation of an eventual troop withdrawal from Namibia. Chief of the Army Lieutenant General Geldenhuys told 11,000 troops participating in a major training exercise near the border in September that the site at Lothatlha was to become the western headquarters of South Africa's border defenses, according to the press. The exercise, in our view, tested procedures and forces earmarked for the command. While SWATF also is developing into a formidable conventional army, it remains dependent upon South African support. Assuming continued infusions of funds, equipment, and training, it could soon rival or surpass the ground combat forces of most black African states. Namibia has no domestic arms pro- duction, however, and SWATF will remain dependent upon foreign equipment and technical services. It also relies on South Africa to provide all combat air and naval support, and SWATF's dependence on Pretoria 25X1 for transport, communications, intelligence, and medi- cal support is likely to persist. Although ample mili- tary manpower is available, low educational levels among nonwhite Namibians will slow the force's development.

At that time, insurgents of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) were combined with troops of the Rhodesian Government. The mainly Shona speaking and Chinese-supported ZANU had long opposed the mostly Ndebele-speaking and Soviet- backed ZAPU, while both groups waged war on the white supremacist government. The Zimbabwe experience was not without incident, but, in our view, it reduced the potential for factional strife. Tribal-based violence disrupted several of the integrated battalions, and the ZANU government aggravated the situation by purging white Air Force officers and discriminating against former ZAPU guerrillas when it reduced the Army's size by one- third. Nonetheless, only a few hundred of the 20,000 veterans who were discharged or deserted turned to armed dissidence, and Zimbabwe's integrated battal- ions sent to protect transportation routes in Mozam- bique have performed effectively against the Mozam- bican insurgents A merger of Namibian guerrillas and government troops would have a fair chance of success if it took account of strong ethnic divisions within SWATF. These divisions persist because Namibian society, like that in Zimbabwe, is fragmented into regionally concentrated tribal groups and because most SWATF units have been recruited from a single locality rather than from the territory as a whole. Every northern homeland, for example, has one or more battalions of blacks, each formed from a single tribe. Where different ethnic.groups have been combined in the same SWATF unit, factious violence has sometimes occurred. The ethnically mixed 51st Battalion was disrupted by tribal fighting in February 1984, A sound plan for a merger would also have to consider tribal tensions within SWAPO. Since the purge in 1980 that expelled SWAPO Vice President Mishake Muyongo and most of his Caprivianfollow- ers, most guerrillas have been recruited among the Owambo and Kavango tribesmen living near the Angolan-Namibian border. These northern guerrillas resent SWAPO members from central and southern Namibia whose ethnic groups do little fighting but hold prestigious positions in the organization's politi- cal wing. Moreover, Kavangos also resent the Owam- bos for monopolizing all senior posts in SWAPO s military wing. Even the Owambos are divided; the large Kwanyama subgroup controls most key posi- tions in SWAPO, to the irritation of the second- largest subgroup, the Ndongas. Any scheme that kept former units intact would preserve tribal identities and unit loyalties, and a simple merger that combined similar whole units to match compatible skills and equipment-thus simpli- fying operations, maintenance, and training-would create volatile combinations. In addition, putting SWAPO's guerrilla detachments with SWATF s l'ght infantry battalions would mix combat-hardened vet- erans from those units that have been at the forefront of the fighting and enemies for 18 years. Virtually all members of those units are northern Namibians, so recriminations probably would be harsh. At the same time, combining conventionally organized units would produce the uncomfortable combination of SWAPO's northern blacks and SWATF's central Namibians, who are mainly whites and mixed-race Coloreds. More complicated, but potentially less factious, would be a merger that reconstituted units on a national basis. This formula would disband SWATF's and the guerrillas' units, integrate person- nel of various ethnic groups, and carefully balance all leadership positions. Individual S WA TF and SWAPO commanders undoubtedly would resist al- tering unit structures, however, because total integra- tion would eliminate their personal power bases. Once formed, the national army could occupy SWATFs existing facilities economically and efi- ciently. Initially concerned with internal security and order, the new army would be well located at SWATF s installations in the north among the ma- jority of the population. As the regime consolidated control and formulated its own perceptions of securi- ty threats and needs, it could construct new facilities and move forces there Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/10/14: CIA-RDP86T00589R000200150006-4 Secret senior command, administrative, and technical posi- succeed, however, it must take into account the make- tions will diminish but not disappear over the next few up of both armies, and avoid combining units with years, and the willingness of seconded South Africans volatile ethnic, regional, and political differences. conditions at independence to remain in the force permanently will depend on the Implications for the United States In our view, SWATF's growing maturity enhances South Africa's political flexibility in Namibia. Pretoria could rely on SWATF, with South African air and logistic support, to defend a puppet regime in Windhoek, thus enabling a South African withdrawal without allowing SWAPO to take over. Alternatively, it could use the force as a proxy to continue its counterinsurgency campaign and postpone Namibian independence indefinitely. If Pretoria believed that including SWATF in a national army would guaran- tee leverage over any government that came to power in Windhoek, it might encourage South African acceptance of independence for Namibia. Incorporating SWATF in a Namibian national army would, however, be a difficult task that would require modifying the UN independence plan. UN Security Council Resolution 435 provides for an international force of 7,500 men to monitor a cease-fire, to ensure the departure of all except 1,500 South African troops, to repatriate as many as 8,000 insurgents located outside Namibia, to confine to bases all guerrillas and South African forces, and to dismantle the territorial units. A UN force of that size would be outnumbered by the Namibian troops, and we doubt South Africa-after investing so heavily in SWATF-will agree to its dissolution. The SWATF Commander said publicly in 1978 that his troops will turn in their heavy weapons-but not individual arms-to unit armories, and that an demobilization would be temporary. Nonetheless, a merger of SWAPO guerrilla forces with the larger and well-trained SWATF units into a national army might improve prospects for post- independence stability. It would avoid dispersing thousands of ex-combatants disgruntled over their lost pay and poor prospects for reemployment. Later, a phased demobilization in step with programs to em- ploy ex-servicemen could more safely reduce the force to a reasonable and affordable size.

Full-time forces include 10 infantry battalions and specialized units for reconnaissance and tracking. They are all based in the Border Operational Area (BOA) and committed to day-to-day counterinsur- gency operations. The reaction force is the 91st Brigade, a unit of reservists based in Windhoek as a territorial reserve. Area defense units are the 26 or more militia detachments located throughout Namib- ia and used for local defense.\" SWATF's primary tactical formation is the motorized light infantry battalion. Ethnically mixed battalions, numbered in the 50 series, are the best equipped and apparently most capable SWATF battalions, partly because they contain large components of South African troops. The ethnically distinct battalions, with unit designations in the hundreds, appear to have less equipment. Although black volunteers fill the ranks, most officers and sergeants are whites seconded from the South African Army. Full-Time Multiracial Units The 51st through 54th Battalions are deployed from west to east just south of the Angolan border in Sector 10. They were formed in the late 1970s to bar infiltration into Owambo.

They usually are cleared of surrounding vege- tation, enclosed by an earth wall and fence, and feature dispersed trenches and weapons positions. 51st Battalion. The battalion is based at Ruacana, and elements are deployed at several smaller camps in the area, It has four infantry companies (one of ethnically mixed Namibians, one on rotation from the 101st Battalion, and two on rotation from South Africa), an armored car company, and three artillery batteries.
