In ComZ or in the ZI, a number of General Hospitals may be grouped to form a Hospital Center. The unit consists of Administration Services (Headquarters, Registrar, Receiving and Patients’ Detachment, Medical Supply Section, Mess Section, General Supply and Utility Section), and Professional Services ( Medical, Surgical, Dental, Laboratory and Roentgenological Sections). A General Hospital is not a mobile unit. It may be expanded to 1,500 or 2,000 beds by direction of the Theater Commander.
