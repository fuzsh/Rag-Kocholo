        "text": "Date:\n\nThursday February 09, 2006\n\nTime:\n\n02:57 PM\n\nComments\n\nHello everyone.\n\nI hope my comments are worthy of submittance to this very interesting, refreshing and touching website. I have never been a part of the 32nd AAA Brigade, partly because i'm only 28, and partly because i'm British and haved lived in Bushey all my life.\n\nThe only humble association I have to share is that for approximately 4 years I worked on the Bushey Hall site. I speant many working hours imagining the site in operation during the time you guys and gals where there. I feel privilaged when reading your memories of time spent at Bushey Hall, and have always felt a presence of importance around me on the site, and the buildings within.\n\nI don't know whether you where able to arrange a reunion to the site, for what it is worth, if anyone would like me to take any photographs of the site, specific buildings, or anything local, please let me know.\n\nAlthough a small area of Bushey Hall has recently been demolished to the rear of the site many buildings are still standing and being used as commercial units.\n\nThe Former Royal Masonic School for boys, located in The Avenue, Bushey is currently being redeveloped for housing.\n\nOne thing I have always been curious of is, I heard that when the site was in operation, there was an underground office/store of some description?.\n\nIf I can help in any way please email me on panpeter77@hotmail.com\n\nBest Regards, Andy Wells\n\nDate:\n\nThursday March 11, 2004\n\nTime:\n\n01:09 PM\n\nComments\n\nDate March 11,2004 Time: 3.30 PM My name is John Hayden and I was stationed at Bushy Hall from Feb. 1956 to June 1957. Just about this time the Army in the process of closing down the base. I was then transferred to Manheim, Germany to the 34th Nike brigade headquarters. While I was at Bushy Hall I meant an English girl and in August 1956 we were married. We've been married for 48 years come this August 25, 2004. It was the best decision I ever made at the young age of twenty. My second eight weeks of basis training was at Fort Lee, Virginia at the Quartermaster school. So when I arrived at Bushy Hall I thought I would be a clerk in supply. At the time I arrived at Bushy Hall the mail clerk was rotating back to the states, that's how I became the mailman for the base. Some of the people I remember from all those years ago were, Headquarters Battery CO Capt. Hill, First Sergeant Graeff, Bob Price, who was best man at my wedding, Joe Vaglia, Bill Lambert, Joe Bulgo One special friend who I am still in contact with is Ron Laws. We were also stationed at Sullivan Barracks in Manheim, Germany. We were both married and lived off base until we rotated home. Over the years my wife and I have returned to Watford many times. Since retiring in 1998 we go back every six months. I've only visited Bushy Hall once in all that time. My wife and I are going back to England on March 25 for our visit and I intend to walk up Water Lane from Watford one last time, just to remember how great those days were. My E-mail address is hayden1936@Yahoo.com"
