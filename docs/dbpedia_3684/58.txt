The Washington Nationals compete in Major League Baseballâ€™s National League East division along with the Miami Marlins, New York Mets, Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies. The Nationals have played their home games at Nationals Park since 2008. Prior to that, they played at RFK Stadium from 2005-07.

The Nationals are the eighth Major League Baseball franchise to be located in Washington D.C. and the first one since 1971. The current team was founded as the Montreal Expos in 1969. In 2002, the Expos were purchased by Major League Baseball and renamed the Nationals. Including their time in Montreal, the Nationals are one of two Major League Baseball teams (the other team is the Seattle Mariners) to have never won a pennant or played in a World Series. Among the Nationals greatest players (including those who played for the Montreal Expos) are Andre Dawson, Vladimir Guerrero, Tim Raines, Gary Carter, Bryce Harper, Max Scherzer, Pedro Martinez, Ryan Zimmerman, Stephen Strasburg, Larry Walker, Dennis Martinez, Tim Wallach, Andres Galarraga, Marquis Grissom, Jayson Werth, Rusty Staub and Moises Alou.
