We are almost at the end of this week.\n\nMake sure to follow The Nats Report on Twitter for updates on the latest from the Washington Nationals and Major League Baseball during the day!\n\nToday's weather in West Palm Beach, according to the National Weather Service:\n\nA 20 percent chance of showers after noon. Mostly sunny, with a high near 79. East wind 8 to 11 mph.\n\n[Don't forget to head to our Spring Training Page during the day, where we give updates on the latest news coming out of West Palm Beach, FL, including a Picture of the Day!]\n\nToday's Spring Training Quote:\n\nI would love to play here my entire career... I've said it in the past — I’ve always liked it here and don’t think the grass is greener on the other side necessarily, but it’s a business, and things change. But as of right now, I would love to play here for my entire career.

Yesterday, Turner in a Zoom Call expressed his want to be a Washington Nationals' player for life, saying: \"I would love to play here my entire career, I’ve always liked it here and don’t think the grass is greener on the other side necessarily, but it’s a business and things change. But as of right now, I would love to play here for my entire career.\"\n\nSteve Mears from TalkNats.com has a great article on this very topic that is worth your time to read. From the article: \"With a seventh place finish in the 2020 NL MVP voting, Turner really raised his stock price. Some have said a 59-game season like 2020 cannot be relied on, but if you look at Turner’s 2019 season after he returned to the team in May, recovering from broken fingers, the team’s resurgence was at the same time that Turner put up a slash of .306 /.363/ .509/ .871 from May 28 to the end of that championship season.\"\n\nLast week, Frank wrote an article for us titled: \"What Does a Trea Turner Extension Look Like?\" In light of this news coming out of Spring Training, you should re-read the article.\n\nClick here to read the article via The Nats Report.\n\nThe Nats Report Setting the Conversation: Welcome to 2021, Where the Nationals Bullpen Is going to be a place of strength.\n\nSince publishing our article on the strength of the 2021 Washington Nationals bullpen, that topic has been mentioned on Team 980's afternoon show and other Washington Nationals blogs and websites.

They have a good amount of high-level talent, but it’s not as deep as many would like, so Victor Robles might be a good option to lead off. Based on Mike Rizzo’s recent comments, it appears that the Nationals are done adding players, and they haven’t been outwardly linked to anyone who hits leadoff.\n\nThankfully, they may have the perfect leadoff candidate on the roster in Victor Robles.\n\nClick here to read the full article on The Nats Report.\n\nICYMI: Perspective: Washington Nationals fans are left wondering if they will be returning to Nats Park this season\n\nAs the coronavirus vaccine continues its rollout to all regions of the U.S., Major League Baseball teams and the local governments that oversee them will be pressed with an important question: Should fans be allowed to attend games?\n\nClick here to read the full article on The Nats Report.\n\nThe Latest on the Nats Report\n\nThe Last Washington Nationals Bench Spot: Yadiel Hernandez?\n\n5 Washington Nationals StoryLines to pay attention to as we get ready for Spring Training\n\nWhat Does a Trea Turner Extension Look Like?\n\nHow the Tatis Deal Impacts the Nationals & More Importantly Juan Soto\n\nHow Hurt Was Carter Kieboom During the 2020 Season?\n\nWhat should the Nationals Do with the 5th Pitching Spot in the Rotation?\n\nWashington Nationals and Major League Baseball Headlines"
