        "text": "What you can and cannot bring inside Nationals Park\n\nNationals Park is not only home to the Washington Nationals baseball team, but also host to a series of great concerts and hockey games. It’s a very family-friendly stadium and also a great place to enjoy some class-A entertainment.\n\nVisitors to the stadium go through a pretty standard security check, during which their bags will be checked. Please note that you can only bring only soft-sided bags no larger than 16″×16″×8″.\n\nOur tip? If you want to skip the waiting time, leave your bags at home and carry just your essentials in your coat pockets. This way you can go through the no bags line and reach your seats much quicker.\n\nBag policy Nationals Park – prohibited items\n\nEven if you do decide to bring a bag or purse with you, there are a few items that are strictly prohibited in the stadium:\n\nWeapons regardless of permit (this includes pocket knives and self-defense sprays);\n\nIllegal substances;\n\nBackpacks and bags larger than 16″×16″×8″;\n\nHard-sided coolers, containers, ice chests;\n\nPlastic, glass, or metal containers of any kind (with the exception of sealed plastic water bottles or empty ones as long as they are no larger than one liter, insulin containers, and baby food);\n\nAlcoholic drinks not bought inside the stadium;\n\nFood, unless it’s kept in a soft-sided container or cooler no larger than 16″×16″×8″;\n\nSigns, costumes, clothing, or any items that might be considered offensive;\n\nUmbrellas that don’t fit in a bag of the maximum allowed size;\n\nProfessional photo or video equipment;\n\nSelfie-sticks, poles, or tripods;\n\nFireworks, firecrackers, laser pointers, noisemakers (such as whistles and horns);\n\nDrones;\n\nToy guns, toy knives (including water guns), beach balls, and inflatables;\n\nAnimals (with the exception of service animals).\n\nPlease note that there are no storage options for prohibited items inside Nationals Park.\n\nBag policy Nationals Park – items allowed in Nationals Park\n\nWhat’s safe to bring inside:\n\nSoft-sided bags that are smaller than 16″×16″×8″;\n\nCompact, collapsible umbrellas, that can fit into a bag;\n\nPersonal cameras/ video cameras, as long as they are not used to record the game or disturb other people and interfere with their enjoying the game;\n\nSigns and banners, as long as they are not offensive, are not attached to a pole and do not block the view of other players or cover any stadium signage;\n\nSingle servings of food kept in a soft-sided container or cooler no larger than 16″×16″×8″;\n\nOne bottle of water per person (sealed or empty) as long as it’s not larger than 1 liter;\n\nInsulin containers and baby food;\n\nService animals.\n\nHouse rules in Nationals Park\n\nApart from having to comply with the bag policy in Nats Park, there are also a few general house rules you should follow:\n\nSmoking is not allowed in any area of Nationals Park\n\nThis includes e-cigarettes and chewing tobacco.\n\nNo offensive language\n\nKeep the stadium a place of respect and sportsmanship. Don’t use any sort of offensive language when referring to anyone, whether it be a player, umpire, or a fellow member of the audience.\n\nYou shouldn’t interfere with other people’s enjoyment of the game\n\nFor example, take care that you’re not standing for long periods of time when others are sitting; the people behind you want to watch the game just as badly as you. If you don’t agree with another person’s comments, then judge them silently, like the rest of us do, don’t pick on them or bully them. Also, don’t be the person always shouting directives at the players. They’ve got this.\n\nDon’t interfere with the game or throw any item on the field\n\nYou might want to let a certain player know what a huge fan you are planning on throwing a “Love Forever” teddy onto the field. Or you might want to let a certain player know how much of a fan you are not and want to throw a pair of undergarments at them on which you wittily wrote: “eat my shorts”. Perhaps you’ve seen one Hollywood film too many people streaking across baseball fields and reckon this is your moment. As those after-school specials have taught us, just say no. This way you and everyone else can enjoy a nice show and not needlessly interrupt or interfere with the play or other’s fun afternoon.\n\nDress appropriately\n\nThere is always that one person that suggests you and your pals all go together to a game and write something funny on your bare bellies. The security guards might take issue with that. So show your support by wearing your team’s merch or just regular clothes.\n\nWhat to do when your bag doesn’t fit the policy?\n\nNo worries, LuggageHero is here to help.
