        "text": "Nothing beats the classic American experience of baseball on a warm summer night. Taking friends and family out to the ballpark is a great way to let your inner competitor emerge while creating invaluable memories. For those local to Northern Virginia, take your plans a step further by discovering the new eateries and attractions around the revamped Capitol Riverfront.\n\nThe Washington Nationals, established in 2005, are a young team with a promising future. You’ll revel in the capitol’s camaraderie whether you splurge on a deluxe suite over home plate or spend just over $10 for a seat with a panoramic view of the stadium. Gather your friends and take advantage of group tickets rates, which are discounted for 13 people or more. These deals carry no additional ticket fees, yet allow access to pregame hospitality areas and personalized service.\n\n“The Nats” host special fan experiences with themes like “Bourbon and Baseball,” “Pups in the Park,” and “Fireworks Fridays.” Invite a grandchild to “Father’s Day Catch on the Field” for a memorable outing that includes a 20-minute catch session, a photo op in the visitor’s dugout, and an official MLB hardball to take home. Savor the magic with friends at the “Seniors Stroll the Bases” event, where fans ages 60+ who purchase a special ticket can round the bases after the game.\n\nGetting There Is Easy\n\nThe metro’s Green Line drops fans at Navy Yard station along the Capitol Riverfront or take the bus to the ballgame by catching the D.C. Circulator at Union Station for just a buck! For fans coming from Virginia, the Baseball Boat lands right at Nationals Park. The ride from Alexandria Marina lasts 40 minutes. Maryland fans can also connect via National Harbor transfers. Boats fill up, so book ahead.\n\nThe park also offers options for people with disabilities, including ADA seating choices, wheelchair-accessible entrances and ATMs, elevators, restrooms, and ramps. The Navy Yard Metro is fully ADA accessible; there are accessible drop-off and pick-up areas and accessible parking as well.\n\nNew Flavors at Nationals Park\n\nWash down the stadium’s famous chili dogs with a cold beer or milkshake, or indulge in local favorite crab cakes from the Chesapeake Crab Cake Company. Besides the classics, the stadium has gone gourmet for the 2019 season, with haute dogs, oysters by the half shell, and more. Try a Korean-inspired bulgogi hoagie at CHIKO, Chinese steamed buns at Bao Bao, or a lamb sloppy Joe at Tiger Fork. For nachos or braised beef tacos, search out Cantina 202.\n\nThe Left Field Lodge serves up artisanal ales from Virginia’s Devil’s Backbone brewery. Baseball-themed cocktails are found at the Distilleries of DMV, and, for traditionalists, the centerfield Budweiser Brewhouse is a great place to socialize.\n\nRiverfront Dining\n\nThe Capitol Riverfront’s remarkable renaissance over the past decade has created a fine atmosphere to stretch your legs and dine before or after a baseball game. Elegant spots like The Salt Line feature seasonal Chesapeake seafood, while the sprawling District Winery’s restaurant Ana offers a beautiful waterfront view.\n\nA short toss from Nationals Park, Hampton Inn & Suites’ Top of the Yard has a rooftop restaurant and lounge with a view directly into Nationals Park as well as DC’s historical sights. No reservations are needed, but it gets crowded on game days.\n\nWhether you’re looking for an inexpensive, traditional take on America’s favorite pastime or interested in a more upscale experience, Nationals Park and the Capitol Riverfront are fun ways to spend down time with friends while showing support for the home team.\n\nMake a Visit"
