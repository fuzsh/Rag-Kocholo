        "text": "Patrick Murphy - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 TOR RHP 20 40\n\nGrades Update: Mar 2021\n\nOFP Role FB CB Cnt/Cmd 40 40 55 50 50/45\n\nMar 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Geoff Pontes\n\nAge: 26 yr\n\nHeight: 6-4\n\nWeight: 220 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: R/R\n\nAcquired: 2013 Round 3\n\nRuleV: On 40-Man Roster\n\nPhysical Description: Tall, long limbed, with a high waisted pitcher's build. Close to physical max, but it's a solid frame that should require minimal maintenance.\n\nMechanics: Exclusively from the stretch; tall and fall; hopper; long arm action; over the top slot, average arm speed. Removed an actual hop from his delivery early in the 2019 season and reworked his mechanics. High effort operation.\n\nFastball: Two variations, throws a sinker and a four-seamer. Primarily sinker, sitting 93-96 mph touching 97. Uses his 6-5 height to his advantage creating downhill plane, which plays up his average run. Heavy groundball producing pitch that will generate a fair amount of whiffs. Grade: 55\n\nCurveball: 11-5 breaking ball; sitting 82-85 mph, with good two plane break and depth, falls off the table with late dump. His go to put away pitch and it tunnels well off of his fastball. Used around 40 percent of the time in combo room with his fastball. Likes to land low gloveside working in on lefties and away from right handers. Still mastering command and he will hang it. Grade: 50\n\nControl and Command: Due to the effort and somewhat unusual nature of his operation Murphy will labor through innings for periods and miss the plate. He has however managed to throw strikes - outside a few weeks of reworking his operation in 2019 - throughout his professional career. He has slightly below average command often hanging his breaking ball and catching too much of the plate with his fastball. Unique in the sense that his control is a full grade higher than his command. Control: 50 | Command: 45\n\nOverall: A converted starter, Murphy's future lies in the pen, where he can be an asset as a two-pitch reliever with above average velocity in his fastball and a bat missing secondary. His high effort operation and below average command hold him back from a prominent pen role in the future but he fits the long reliever/low-leverage tag nicely.\n\nOFP: 40\n\nRole: 40 - Low-Leverage Reliever\n\nRisk: Low\n\nSeth Romero - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS LHP 13 45\n\nGrades Update: Jan 2021\n\nOFP Role FB SL CH Cnt/Cmd 45 40 55 60 50 40/40\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Anthony Franco\n\nAge: 25 yr\n\nHeight: 6-3\n\nWeight: 240 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: L/L\n\nAcquired: 2017 Round 1\n\nRuleV: On 40-man\n\nPhysical Description: Listed size of 6'3, 240 looks outdated. Was heavyset at the University of Houston but slimmed down by 2020 MLB debut. Physically maxed out; tree trunk thighs with rounded, muscular upper half. Underwent a Tommy John surgery in 2019.\n\nDelivery & Mechanics: Pretty stiff delivery; struggles to get out over his front hip at release, giving him some difficulty staying on top of his offspeed stuff. Some effort and head movement at release. 3/4 arm slot. Below-average athlete.\n\nFastball: Romero was 91-93 in majors last season; had been more reliably in the mid-90's as a draft prospect. Reasonable to project him to add a tick or two as he gets further from surgery and on a more regular workload but he probably never recovers the 94-97 he had in college. Fastball has some backspin that gives it decent life at the top of the zone. Grade: 55\n\nSlider: 80-83 MPH slider drives the profile. Has good lateral action with some depth and bat-missing bite. Inconsistent feel for locating but it's a plus pitch when he spots it down and glove-side. Grade: 60\n\nChangeup: 83-85 MPH change. Inconsistent feel but flashed above-average changeup. Has good arm-side break but sometimes slows down the arm speed. Grade: 50\n\nControl and Command: Poor present control. Very little feel for consistently locating secondaries and struggles to throw fastball in the strike zone in obvious 'take situations’ for the hitter. Due to limited minor-league reps (has been both injured and suspended at times), might be a bit of a late bloomer as a strike-thrower. Nevertheless, age and below-average athleticism mean he<92>s probably best suited in the bullpen. Control: 40 | Command: 40\n\nOverall: Romero has a potential starter's repertoire but various factors mean he's more likely to wind up a long-term reliever. He doesn't have much present control or command; that should improve as he gets more minor-league reps, but his lack of athleticism means strike-throwing was always going to be a struggle. Plus, the Nationals have a need for immediate bullpen help. With Romero already on the 40-man roster, I think Washington's more likely to get him to the majors as a left-handed bullpen piece with plus stuff rather than give him the minor-league reps he'd need for another couple years to have a shot to develop starter command and feel.\n\nOFP: 45\n\nRole: 40 - Long Reliever or Low Leverage Reliever\n\nRisk: High\n\nSammy Infante - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS SS 12 45\n\nGrades Update: Jan 2021\n\nOFP Role Hit Power Field Arm Run 45 40 40 45 55 50 50\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Matt Pullman\n\nAge: 20 yr\n\nHeight: 6-1\n\nWeight: 185 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: R/R\n\nAcquired: 2020 Round 2\n\nRuleV: 2024\n\nPhysical Description: Athletic, projectable build. Not overly lean, nor stocky, just a very good body at his age. There's a chance he will fill out and physically require a move off shortstop, but at present there are no concerns about his build.\n\nHit: Visually-appealing swing with some loft. Hands start fairly high, up at the ear, and he can get caught up with some bat wrap. May require mechanical tweaks to keep up with premium velo. Shows a moderate-high legkick in BP, but utilizes mostly a toe-tap against live pitching. Feet start slightly open and finish slightly open, even on outside pitches he takes the opposite way. Flashes a two-strike approach and the willingness to foul off marginal pitches. Shows elementary pitch recognition skills, but is not consistent. Grade: 40\n\nPower: Above-average bat speed; shows loud plus raw in BP. Power plays down in games due to tracking issues and overall hit tool deficiencies. Has the right combination of athleticism and projectability to eventually play plus with hit tool refinement. Grade: 45\n\nField: Plus athlete with infield actions, clean enough to stick at short with the right development. Soft hands which work well together. Shows solid footwork, rounding balls well and showing the timing to create hops for himself. Not a standout, concrete shortstop, especially considering he lacks elite quickness and could slow down further with physical maturation. Overall, good enough actions to likely stick on the infield. Athletic enough for a corner outfield role if necessary. Grade: 55\n\nArm: Has the arm strength to make it work on the left side of the infield. Looks comfortable making throws from various arm slots. Grade: 50\n\nRun: Not the most efficient runner, but athletic enough that there could be untapped speed. Not a burner, but won't clog the bases in his 20s, either. Grade: 50\n\nOverall: A projectable athlete with solid across-the-board tools but without a standout tool or an overly-polished skillset. He stands a chance to stick at shortstop long-term, but the likelier scenario is a move to third or second, where the power will have to show up in games to be more than just a role player. Slightly older for his class, and in need of development in the most important areas of his game, it could take a while for his value to materialize at the big league level. There's a chance he winds up an above-average MLB regular, but for now the likelier outcome appears to be a fringe-average starter or utility man with some pop.\n\nOFP: 45\n\nRole: 40 - Below-Average Player: Bench / Utility\n\nRisk: Moderate\n\nMatt Cronin - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS LHP 11 45\n\nGrades Update: Jan 2021\n\nOFP Role FB SL Cnt/Cmd 45 40 60 60 40/30\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Joe Drake\n\nAge: 23 yr\n\nHeight: 6-2\n\nWeight: 105 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: L/L\n\nAcquired: 2019 Round 4\n\nRuleV: 2022\n\nPhysical Description: Big, thick, maxed out frame. Muscle throughout the body but also a clear layer of padding on top. May be bigger than listed numbers. Thick, muscular thighs stand out, butt too. Moves well through his delivery for a big guy. Grown man. Pretty proportional throughout. Looks like an MLB pitcher. Athletic enough to make average plays around the mound.\n\nDelivery & Mechanics: Works from both windup and stretch. Windup features huge leg kick reminiscent of El Duque, but not quite as pointed, and coils the torso so much that he's nearly back to the batter. Short arm stroke that comes straight back and fires from high 3/4s slot. Moderately high effort. Good separation at foot plant with the arm on time, maybe even a touch early. Gets in his glutes decently. Leg kick is much more tame from the stretch, coming to the waist. Not afraid to throw over to first; uses step-off move and move from the leg kick.\n\nFastball: Sits 92-94, t97. Overpowered Low-A hitters with it, hurling it by them. Used as his out pitch getting both whiffs and called strikes. High-spin offering with above-average vertical movement that makes it a real bear up in the zone. Locates it well to all shadows of the zone. Grade: 60\n\nCurveball: 74-76, sharp bender with both horizontal sweep and depth, 1-7 shape. Break is sharp with considerable depth. Likes to attack lefties with it. Throws it hard, arm speed similar to fastball. Appears to tunnel pretty well. Decent command, will yank it glove-side occasionally, but doesn't typically miss in the zone. Grade: 60\n\nControl and Command: On/off profile. Pounds the zone and does a good job working the edges and hitting his spots when he has it. Can locate to both sides of the plate and up. Works ahead in counts. When he doesn't, he falls behind, is inefficient and has to come over the heart. Can have issues closing out right handers and leads him to nibble risk a walk. Struggles to regain the release when he loses it mid-inning. Control: 40 | Command: 30\n\nOverall: Lefty reliever with a good bender and velocity. Dominated Low-A hitters, but will have less margin for error against upper level hitting. Struggles to put away righties at times with fastball-heavy attack. MLB ceiling may limited by 3-batter minimum and lack of a second offering against righties who can handle the fastball. Upside is a high-leverage reliever, with a low-leverage floor. A great LOOGY candidate in years past.\n\nOFP: 45\n\nRole: 40 - Low Leverage Reliever\n\nRisk: Low\n\nHolden Powell - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS RHP 10 45\n\nGrades Update: Jan 2021\n\nOFP Role FB SL Cnt/Cmd 45 40 60 60 45/45\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Joe Doyle\n\nAge: 21 yr\n\nHeight: 6-0\n\nWeight: 185 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: R/R\n\nAcquired: 2020 Round 3\n\nRuleV: 2023\n\nPhysical Description: Diminutive, lithe, slender righty. Stronger lower half with muscular legs. Long, lanky arms. Close to physically matured. Not a body where added weight would benefit the product.\n\nDelivery & Mechanics: Deceptive, jerky delivery from a high three-quarter arm slot. Moderately-high leg kick. Delivery is arm-heavy. Lacks extension. Head stays remarkably still. Entire operation is a little funky, but not concerning.\n\nFastball: Low to mid-90s fastball with ride and some arm-side run. Tops out at 97. Ball explodes at the plate thanks to unorthodox delivery and arm-action. Command for the pitch is above average. Grade: 60\n\nSlider: Absolute hammer, wipeout breaking ball. Mid-80s pitch topping out at 87. Shows the ability to spin the ball, topping out close to 2700rpm. Gyro-heavy with fantastic depth and a little horizontal sweep. Late breaker. Commands the pitch well. True out-pitch. Grade: 60\n\nControl and Command: Control/Command has improved over time. Below average in 2019, took a step forward in draft year. Spots fastball well arm-side, struggles more with glove-side. Controls slider well. Can handle high-leverage situations. Control: 45 | Command: 45\n\nOverall: Powell has the makings of a power, two-pitch, high-leverage reliever who can get big outs late in ballgames. The fastball should be a mid-90s offering at the big league level. The slider is already plus, and could conceivably take a step forward with improved command. Definitive bullpen arm. Control and command, as well as unorthodox arm-heavy delivery will be concerns to watch.\n\nOFP: 45\n\nRole: 40 - Average High Leverage Reliever\n\nRisk: Moderate\n\nAndry Lara - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS RHP 14 40\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Eddy Almaguer\n\nAge: 18 yr\n\nHeight: 6-4\n\nWeight: 180 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: R/R\n\nAcquired: 2019 IFA\n\nRuleV: 2023\n\nOverall: The most expensive international signing from the Nats' 2019-20 J2 period, Lara is an 18 year old Venezuelan righty with a sturdy, 6-foot-4 frame. He's well built with a strong lower half and clear room for growth in the upper body. It's a traditional delivery with low effort and above-average arm speed. At signing the fastball sat 92-94, showing good zip especially in the upper half of the zone and it jumps out of his hand. Should expect to add two more ticks with proper conditioning and added mass. 11-5 curveball flashes above-average with late bite. More information is needed about his complete arsenal and what the command/control looks like over an extended period of time. Put him on your watch list for now and check back at the end of the year.\n\nOFP: 40\n\nRisk: Extreme\n\nArmando Cruz - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS SS 9 45\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Matt Thompson\n\nAge: 17 yr\n\nHeight: 5-11\n\nWeight: 165 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: R/R\n\nAcquired: 2020 IFA\n\nRuleV: 2024\n\nOverall: The Nationals signed Cruz out of the Dominican Republic for $4 million. Cruz is known for his hands and flashy defensive skills, and he will put on a show during infield practice. Unreal footwork and hands, the hope is those elite skills translate to the offensive side of the ball. As you would expect with someone with elite hands, Cruz has a quick bat with good bat-to-ball skills. How much power he ends up hitting for is up for debate, but he should fill out nicely and stick at short with strong defensive skills and average or better offensive production.\n\nOFP: 45\n\nRisk: High\n\nTim Cate - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS LHP 8 45\n\nGrades Update: Jan 2021\n\nOFP Role FB CB CH Cnt/Cmd 45 40 45 60 40 60/50\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Trevor Hooth\n\nAge: 23 yr\n\nHeight: 6-0\n\nWeight: 185 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: L/L\n\nAcquired: 2018 Round 2\n\nRuleV: 2021\n\nPhysical Description: Lean frame. Sloping shoulders. Lower half looks more filled out, but there is room to project more on the frame.\n\nDelivery & Mechanics: Easy, repeatable mechanics. Standard 3/4 slot. Starts with body slightly off center towards the first base side. Hands start up by his neck. Chest high leg lift. As the leg goes down his hands follow and his back knee bends to help drive out towards the plate. He lands closed and throws across his body. Finishes with a flat back, upper half parallel to the ground. Leg comes though and he finishes even facing the plate.\n\nFastball: 88-90 T92. There's some sink to this. The pitch excels at creating groundballs. It plays best when peppering the corners low, rather than being elevated. He likes to bust it in on righties hands and make some firewood. With good sequencing it can garner some whiffs in on the hands. As he fills out this pitch could become an average offering. Grade: 45\n\nCurveball: 77-83. 12-6 break, and a lot of it. There is sharp break with this pitch that makes a legitimate swing and miss offering. He commands it well enough to use it early in counts too. He uses it early and often to both lefties and righties. When he does miss with it, it's rarely up, mostly it'll be in the dirt from overthrowing. This is what Cate is known for, and for good reason, this is a legit plus pitch and a little better command on it would put it into a plus-plus conversation. Grade: 60\n\nChangeup: A clear third pitch in usage. It gets decent tumble at the bottom of the zone. It looks like Cate has a tendency to slow up his mechanics with this offering. It can be another groundball creating weapon with a little more deception. Grade: 40\n\nControl and Command: He rarely misses up in the zone. Generally it will be missing low or a little wide on the corners. He's always around the zone and posted above average walk numbers in his first full season as a pro. He appears to overthrow when he's pressing for a strike and that causes the ball to find the dirt at a high rate. That's not the worst place to miss since he excels at creating grounders. So he needs to live low in the zone, which he does very well. Control: 60 | Command: 50\n\nOverall: Even as an amateur, Cate had a reputation of having an absolute hammer of a curveball. That remains true in the pro ranks. He compliments it with a fastball and changeup that create grounders well, but any strikeout ability is likely coming from that breaking ball. He's a pitcher who will have to live low in the zone, which does. He'll try to pepper the corners, but if he misses then he finds himself behind in counts frequently. Injury history and a plus breaking ball have people talking about a relief role, but there's backend rotation potential with Cate as he fills out more. I'd expect the Nationals to keep him starting.\n\nOFP: 45\n\nRole: 40 - Spot Starter or Low Leverage Reliever\n\nRisk: High\n\nMason Denaburg - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS RHP 7 45\n\nGrades Update: Jan 2021\n\nOFP Role FB CB CH Cnt/Cmd 45 40 55 55 45 45/40\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: James Chipman\n\nAge: 21 yr\n\nHeight: 6-4\n\nWeight: 200 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: R/R\n\nAcquired: 2018 Round 1\n\nRuleV: 2022\n\nPhysical Description: Ideal pitchers build. XL frame: every bit of listed 6'4\" 200 pounds. Broad shoulders that slope; average upper body and core; high waist and long limbs. Above-average athleticism: multi-sport athlete in HS. Minimal physical projection remaining. Injury history includes: biceps tendinitis (2018) and shoulder surgery (2019).\n\nDelivery & Mechanics: Semi-windup; tall and fall operation. High 3/4 arm slot with above-average arm speed and a high effort delivery. Arm slot wanders, occasionally dropping down a tick to a standard 3/4. High leg kick; exposes the ball behind his back; long arm path; short stride; average extension; lead arm pulls torso open early; recoil after release a bit violent; hard landings first-base side. Frame and slot generate natural downward plane. Rushes and loses tempo often; overall easy mechanics, just struggles to repeat.\n\nFastball: Sat 90-94 prior to shoulder injury; regularly showed the ability to hit upper-90s prior to the draft. Shows imposing arm-side run and the ability to miss bats at its best. With below-average command and two years of lost development, regaining velo will be paramount. Grade: 55\n\nCurveball: Shows flashes of a high spin rate, above-average breaking ball that sits 78-82. Arm slot wanders a bit, yielding both 11/5 and 10/4 shape. At its best around 78-80 when it shows tight rotation with 11/5 depth and sharp bite. Gets firm and slurvy in the low-80s. Shows the ability to mix it early in the count for called strikes; tough on RHB as a swing-and-miss put-away offering. Further pro instruction should yield a solid big league offering. Grade: 55\n\nChangeup: Sits 82-85; Firm tumbler; mild fade with solid late vertical drop. Not a bat-misser; ground ball pitch with off-barrel contact. Has moderate feel and maintains arm speed; showed below-average command. Development will ultimately influence big league role. Grade: 45\n\nControl and Command: Shows flashes of fluid well repeated mechanics that yield near average command. More often than not, issues repeating yield spotty command. Has the attributes of solid pitchabilty: pitching backwards and attacks all four quads. Sequencing occasionally predictable as he's heavy FB/CB. Will nibble hunting for strikeouts, resulting in long at-bats and free passes. Without significant gains, the short arsenal and limited command profile probably better suits him for a reliever role. Control: 45 | Command: 40\n\nOverall: Denaburg has the size and raw arsenal to project as high as a first-division middle of the rotation stalwart. Unfortunately, injuries have limited Denaburg to just 20 1/3 IP since being drafted in 2018; clouding his future projection. The development of his CH and evolution of his command will be paramount for him to carve out a role in a big league rotation. His biggest battle however will be simply getting and remaining healthy as recurrent shoulder issues are a huge red flag. I'm bearish until he proves the shoulder issues are truly behind him. That being said, a healthy and productive 2021 season could elevate his stock back into role 50 or better territory.\n\nOFP: 45\n\nRole: 40 - Spot Starter or Low Leverage Reliever\n\nRisk: Extreme\n\nJeremy De La Rosa - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS OF 6 45\n\nGrades Update: Jan 2021\n\nOFP Role Hit Power Field Arm Run 45 40 45 45 50 50 50\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Jake Kerns\n\nAge: 19 yr\n\nHeight: 5-11\n\nWeight: 160 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: L/L\n\nAcquired: 2018 IFA\n\nRuleV: 2022\n\nPhysical Description: Average height and build. Heavier than his listed weight. Has some remaining projection in his upper half. Strong forearms and quads. High waisted. Good athlete.\n\nHit: Crouched, slightly open stance from the left side. Has noticeably closed his stance since signing. Keeps the barrel back. Some pre-pitch, rhythmic bat movement. Wide base at impact. Easy, linear swing that generates mostly line drives to the short part of the grass. Has above-average bat speed but yet to truly impact the ball. Shows an understanding of the strike zone, but struck out too often during his brief 2019. Improvement with pitch recognition will help him cut down on his strikeouts. Has some feel for barrel control but tends to get underneath the ball; generates more flyouts than groundouts. Struggled against lefties in a small sample during the 2019 season. Grade: 45\n\nPower: Shows present average raw power, primarily to the pull side. Didn't get to it much during his abbreviated 2019 season. Has above-average bat speed and already uses his hips well. There's room to grow as he physically matures and learns to better drive pitches. Grade: 45\n\nField: Shows good footwork and is fluid in the field. Has enough speed to cover ground in right, but it's mostly average range. Lacks in-game experience. Grade: 50\n\nArm: Average arm that shows average carry from the grass. Some effort in the motion. Can reach back for more. Throws to 3B and C mostly on line from RF in several looks. Plays average in RF. Grade: 50\n\nRun: Showed above-average times in the 60 and was timed 4.12 down the line as an amateur. Heady runner and can take an extra base on balls hit to the grass. Yet to prove himself as a threat to steal, but has enough speed and awareness to keep the pitcher honest. Projected to slow with added bulk. Grade: 50\n\nOverall: De La Rosa's tools presently project nearly average across the board, but he has some untapped potential with the bat, particularly with his power. He already shows some feel at the plate and will ultimately go as far as his bat takes him. He received positive reports from the alternate site in 2020 and is a breakout candidate moving forward. He has everyday upside if the bat maxes out.\n\nOFP: 45\n\nRole: 40 - Below-Average Player: Bench or Platoon\n\nRisk: High\n\nJoan Adon - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS RHP 5 45\n\nGrades Update: Jan 2021\n\nOFP Role FB SL CH Cnt/Cmd 45 40 60 55 45 40/30\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Joe Doyle\n\nAge: 22 yr\n\nHeight: 6-2\n\nWeight: 185 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: R/R\n\nAcquired: 2016 IFA\n\nRuleV: On 40-Man Roster\n\nPhysical Description: Makes up for his shorter height on the mound with a well-rounded build. Good strength to his upper half with broad shoulders and chest. Solid strength and size to his frame.\n\nDelivery & Mechanics: Good extension and arm action from the right side. Quick delivery, no noticeable hiccups from the windup or stretch. Methodical approach and slight hesitation with his right leg within windup. Arm is locked in and compact through each pitch. Produces quality stuff, needs to refine command.\n\nFastball: Plus fastball with great velocity and late bite. Sits 93-95 and touches 97. Continues to add consistent velocity with each season. Has good spin and bite, thrown up in the zone for whiffs. Fastball is thrown with zip, great first pitch in his arsenal. Grade: 60\n\nSlider: Mid-80s slider that serves as a quality out pitch. Has a cutter-esque break on both sides of the plate, mixes well with his fastball. Late movement creates several swings and misses. Raw break is evident, just lacks refinement. Grade: 55\n\nChangeup: Another mid-80s offering that continues to develop. Changeup has touched 86-87 and doesn't offer much velocity separation. Shows signs of fade and run, but sits firm in the zone. Has potential to be a quality off-speed pitch. Grade: 45\n\nControl and Command: Has the raw stuff and velocity, but needs to improve on his command. Gets behind the count and struggles to find the zone in his outings. Doesn't locate well inside. Quick delivery bodes well for his fastball command. Needs more well-placed strikes from his secondaries. Command struggles may hold him back from being a starter. Control: 40 | Command: 30\n\nOverall: Adon has the velocity and raw stuff that continues to improve. His fastball consistently sits in the mid-90s along with a hard-breaking slider and effective changeup. Adon must refine his command and polish his secondaries to fulfill a starter role, but his fastball can make him an effective bullpen option.\n\nOFP: 45\n\nRole: 40 - Spot Starter or Low Leverage Reliever\n\nRisk: High\n\nCole Henry - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS RHP 4 45\n\nGrades Update: Jan 2021\n\nOFP Role FB CB CH Cnt/Cmd 45 40 55 55 45 55/55\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Joe Doyle\n\nAge: 21 yr\n\nHeight: 6-4\n\nWeight: 215 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: R/R\n\nAcquired: 2020 Round 1\n\nRuleV: 2023\n\nPhysical Description: Big, tall, strong body.

Durability has been a concern in collegiate career, some reasonably minor arm injuries.\n\nFastball: Good fastball 92-95, touching as high as 97 when healthy and fresh. Holds velocity late into starts. Fastball shape is inconsistent, most consistently showing some arm-side run. High-spin offering with fantastic upside with development. Delivery suggests big potential for four-seam fastball with ride. Must find consistent release. Has shown good aptitude for commanding the pitch. Above average ceiling with plus potential should his effort land him in a bullpen role. Grade: 55\n\nCurveball: Mid-70s with hammer shape and some sweep. Some deception and tunneling action out of arm-slot. Commands the pitch really well. Spots the pitch well at the bottom of the zone. Not afraid to pitch backwards with his breaking ball. Grade: 55\n\nChangeup: Mid-80s offering that currently lacks the shape necessary to forecast as an out-pitch at the next level. Struggles to kill lift. Changeup has solid fading action, but lacks depth. Arm-action/conviction is good, but struggles to kill spin. Lacks separation off the fastball. Grade: 45\n\nControl and Command: Ability to control and command the fastball/curveball combo is very strong, despite effort-heavy delivery. Changeup lags behind primary two pitches. Should be able to throw enough to strikes to remain in a rotation. Control: 55 | Command: 55\n\nOverall: Henry has an ideal starters body and two above-average pitches that are a great foundation toward becoming a big league starter. His ceiling will rely on the development of a third pitch, ideally an offspeed pitch. The fastball will need to develop a shape identity, ideally a riding fastball to couple off his curveball. Durability and effort will be the big question mark. If he can stay healthy and continue his growth as a pitcher, there's backend potential here.\n\nOFP: 45\n\nRole: 40 - Spot Starter or Average High Leverage Reliever\n\nRisk: High\n\nCade Cavalli - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS RHP 2 55\n\nGrades Update: Jan 2021\n\nOFP Role FB CB SL CH Cnt/Cmd 55 60 60 55 60 50 50/45\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Ian Smith\n\nAge: 22 yr\n\nHeight: 6-4\n\nWeight: 220 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: R/R\n\nAcquired: 2020 Round 1\n\nRuleV: 2024\n\nPhysical Description: Physical, XL frame with limited projection remaining. Barrel chest with broad shoulders and a thick lower half. It's rare to see a pitcher with this type of measurables and muscle definition. Has battled some injuries throughout amateur career, but offers a pro-ready body right now.\n\nDelivery & Mechanics: Makes it look effortless on the mound. Cavalli works off the first base side of the rubber in a traditional windup. Slight rocker step and gets very tall before exploding to the plate. Arm speed jumps out at you. Arm slot comes from a high three quarters while getting elite extension. Lacks some deception in his arsenal, but top-tier velocity helps overcome some. Will show impressive hip and shoulder separation combined with high level flexibility. Very simple, loose delivery with limited added effort and easy repeatability. Clean all the way through finish.\n\nFastball: 96-99; Very easy plus-plus velocity. Will get a ton of late life at the top of the zone. Lacked some deception on the pitch in college by trying to live at the bottom of the zone, and ultimately left too many pitches to be hit hard. Command of the pitch will waver on occasion, but shows the ability to be a high K pitch due to velo and movement profile. Solid chance for triple digits very soon. Grade: 60\n\nCurveball: 81-85; A true power curveball that has just been steadily improving. Cavalli has turned a solid pitch into a 12/6 hammer with tremendous shape over the past year. Throws the pitch extremely firm with very good depth creating a bunch of empty swings. Loses command of the pitch occasionally, and that's seemingly keeping this pitch away from being true plus. Grade: 55\n\nSlider: 86-89; The most underrated weapon in Cavalli's arsenal. Gyro-heavy movement with heavy velocity, and the confidence to throw in any counts. Will kill sweep on the pitch and gets devastating vertical movement in the zone. Tunnels the pitch extremely well off of the fastball. Has some cutter aspects to the pitch and shows ability to miss a ton of bats. Grade: 60\n\nChangeup: 87-90; Another above average pitch that Cavalli can get a ton of empty swings with. Gets big tumbling action while consistently landing the pitch for strikes. Velo separation could be better, but maintains arm speed and tunnels the pitch well. Grade: 50\n\nControl and Command: Cavalli shows a good ability to throw strikes, but overall command is very average as we stand today. Fastball command leads the way, but secondaries need a bit more consistency. Overall control took a big stride in a small sample in 2020, and will be important to see if that continues to trend up given the lack of projection remaining. Control: 50 | Command: 45\n\nOverall: This is a very high octane package coming from the former Boomer Sooner. Can potentially have three plus pitches before it's all said and done led by the FB/SL combo. If Cavalli can continue to make strides in command, this could be an SP2 type of ceiling with a very strong foundation to fall back on.\n\nOFP: 55\n\nRole: 60 - #3 SP\n\nRisk: High\n\nJackson Rutledge - Scouting Report\n\nRank History\n\nYear Team Position Team Rank OFP 2021 WAS RHP 1 55\n\nGrades Update: Jan 2021\n\nOFP Role FB CB SL CH Cnt/Cmd 55 60 70 55 60 45 50/45\n\nJan 2021 Report\n\nEvaluator: Mike Kinsela\n\nAge: 22 yr\n\nHeight: 6-8\n\nWeight: 250 lbs\n\nHits/Throws: R/R\n\nAcquired: 2019 Round 1\n\nRuleV: 2022\n\nPhysical Description: Physical monster, massive and strong and physical. Minimal projection remaining if any but a big league body at present.\n\nDelivery & Mechanics: Low-maintenance delivery with simplicity throughout operation, getting over his front side with repeatability and tempo, staying linear throughout as well. The arm stroke stays inline through the back and he's got a high front side coming through which aids in deception. Extremely short arm action is notable.\n\nFastball: Pitch touched triple digits as an amateur and continues to flirt with that as a professional. Can hold mid-90's deep into starts and has average life on the pitch in general. Pitch could encroach on elite in short bursts, but plays plus-plus in starter role. Grade: 70\n\nCurveball: Behind the slider but not by all that much, thrown in the low 80's with more downward bite, has confidence in pitch and is adept at landing it over outer edge for called strikes vs. hitters of either handedness, have seen it plus at times. Grade: 55\n\nSlider: Best secondary, thrown firmly in the mid-upper 80's with devastating bite, tunneled well off of fastball with plus, late tilt, confident throwing it in any count as chase pitch, swing-and-miss offering that should miss bats at highest level. Grade: 60\n\nChangeup: In the \"usable\" range right now but Rutledge has shown feel for the pitch, generally in mid-upper 80's, average fade with below average present command of the pitch, end of arsenal right now but could be enough to keep lefties honest. Grade: 45\n\nControl and Command: Rutledge can throw strikes and a high number of walks aren't really the worry here, but his command is in the fringe-average range right now and given his present size and limited projection, one wonders where the command projection is. Control: 50 | Command: 45\n\nOverall: Pretty overwhelming package of stuff with as many as 4 pitches that can be effective at the highest level in a starter role, 3 of which could be plus or better. Shouldn't have an issue missing bats, issue may be command limiting his effectiveness as a starter and pushing him to bullpen.\n\nOFP: 55\n\nRole: 60 - #3 SP\n\nRisk: High"
