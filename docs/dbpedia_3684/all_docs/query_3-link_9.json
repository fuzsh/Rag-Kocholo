The right-hander has given up 12 earned runs with an 8:11 K:BB over 12 innings this season and appeared to be in danger of losing his roster spot with Robert Garcia returning from the injured list Tuesday; however, the Nationals aren't yet ready to expose Rainey to waivers, as he is out of minor-league options. The 31-year-old may need to turn a corner soon if he's to retain his place in the bullpen much longer.\n\nðŸ¤”\n\nNo major trades are likely to happen anytime soon, especially for Thomas given the injury, but the outfielder could end up on the block again this summer after the Nationals elected to hold onto him last year. The 28-year-old was off to a poor start prior to the injury with a .184/.250/.253 through 22 games, but he's still likely to be a popular trade candidate this summer, assuming he's healthy, after he posted a .783 OPS last season.\n\nðŸ¤”\n\nWashington called up infielder Trey Lipscomb in a corresponding move, as the club opted not to bolster their outfield depth. Senzel's only action in the field has come at third base this season, but he primarily played the outfield during his five seasons in Cincinnati.\n\nâ€Œ\n\nâ€Œ\n\nâ€Œ\n\nRuiz was unavailable Wednesday against the Giants due to an illness, but he should be available Friday versus Oakland since the Nationals demoted No. 3 catcher Drew Millas after Wednesday's contest.\n\nðŸ¤”\n\nRuiz started just one of the past three games and will have Thursday's scheduled off day to aid in his recovery from the ailment. The 25-year-old posted a .717 OPS with 18 homers in 136 games last season, but he has a .194/.265/.290 slash line through 34 plate appearances this season."
