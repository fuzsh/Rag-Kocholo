The winners will be recognized during a pre-game ceremony prior to Sunday’s game.\n\nThe Nats Report is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nHitter of the Year — James Wood\n\nWood, 21, ranked in Washington’s Minor League system in home runs (1st, 26), RBI (1st, 91), slugging percentage (1st, .520), OPS (2nd, .873), doubles (2nd, 28) triples (2nd, 8) and hits (3rd, 124). He set career highs in nearly every statistical category. He was selected to represent the Washington Nationals in the 2023 SiriusXM All-Star Futures Game.\n\nWood finished the season slashing .262/.353/.520 with 28 doubles, eight triples, 26 home runs, 91 RBI, 65 walks, 18 stolen bases, and 80 runs scored in 129 games between High-A Wilmington and Double-A Harrisburg. He was signed by San Diego Padres scout John Martin before being acquired by the Nationals. Wood is currently rated by Baseball America and MLBPipeline.com as the №2 prospect in Washington’s Minor League system and the №7 overall prospect in Minor League Baseball according to both outlets.\n\nPitcher of the Year — Andrew Alvarez\n\nAlvarez, 24, went 7–7 with a 2.99 ERA, 116 strikeouts, and 43 walks in 129.1 innings across 26 games (22 starts) between High-A Wilmington and Double-A Harrisburg. From April 7 through June 20, Alvarez pitched to a 2.53 ERA (16 ER/57.0 IP) with 49 strikeouts and a 4–1 record across 13 games (10 starts). He pitched at least 5.0 innings in five of the starts. Opponents hit .229 with two home runs during this span.\n\nAlvarez finished the season ranked in Washington’s Minor League system in ERA (1st, 2.99), WHIP (1st, 1.17), innings pitched (T1st, 129.1), strikeouts (2nd, 116), and opponents’ average (2nd .229). It marked the first time a Nationals pitcher recorded a sub-3.00 ERA in a full Minor League season since 2018.\n\nAlvarez was selected in the 12th round of the 2021 First-Year Player Draft out of California Polytechnic State University. He was signed by Nationals scout Bryan Byrne.\n\nDefensive Player of the Year — Trey Lipscomb\n\nLipscomb, 23, increased his fielding percentage at second base and third base from .929 in 2022 to .981 in 2023 — committing just eight errors this season. He appeared at shortstop for the first time in his professional career and did not make an error in 39 chances. At third base, he recorded four defensive runs saved, according to Baseball Info Solutions.\n\nLipscomb is currently rated by MLBPipeline.com as the №14 prospect in Washington’s Minor League system and the №15 prospect by Baseball America. Lipscomb was selected in the third round of the 2022 First-Year Player Draft out of the University of Tennessee. He was signed by Nationals scout Brian Cleary.\n\nBaserunner of the Year — Johnathon Thomas\n\nThomas, 23, ranked fifth in all of Minor League Baseball with 65 stolen bases, second among all Single-A players. His career-high 65 stolen bases were the most by a Nationals Minor Leaguer since the 2014 season (HAG’s Rafael Bautista; 69 SB). He was one of five players in all of Minor League Baseball to record at least 65 stolen bases and at least 60 runs scored.\n\nThomas was selected in the 19th round of the 2022 First-Year Player Draft out of Texas Southern University. He was signed by Nationals scout Kevin Ham.\n\nNationals Way Award — Jacob Young\n\nThe right-handed hitter ranked in Washington’s Minor League system in average (2nd, .305), on-base percentage (2nd, .376), hits (2nd, 132) and stolen bases (2nd, 39). Young averaged .305 with 21 doubles, five triples, six homers, 58 RBI, 42 walks, 39 stolen bases and 60 runs scored across 112 games between High-A Wilmington, Double-A Harrisburg, and Triple-A Rochester. Young went on to make his Major League debut on August 26 at Miami.\n\nYoung was selected in the seventh round of the 2021 First-Year Player Draft out of the University of Florida. He was signed by Nationals scout Tommy Jackson.\n\nThe Nats Report is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber."
