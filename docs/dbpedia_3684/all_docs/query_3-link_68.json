        "text": "The Washington Nationals will return with an Opening Day appearance and Home Opener with pre-game activities.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC — The Washington Nationals are finally back in action on Thursday, March 28, with an Opening Day game against the Pittsburgh Pirates and start their home season, Monday, April 1, hosting the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nAll 30 MLB teams will play on Opening Day for the second straight year, though the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres technically kicked off the regular season with a two-game series in Seoul, South Korea, last week. Each team walked away with one win.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the Nationals' first game.\n\nHow To Watch\n\nThe first pitch is scheduled for 4:10 p.m. on Thursday, with Josiah Gray expected to take the mound for the Nationals against the Cincinnati Reds, according to MLB.com.\n\nThe Home Opener will follow at 4:05 p.m. on April 1 versus the Pittsburgh Pirates. The team will host pre-game activities like an appearance by the Budweiser Clydesdales, red carpet player introductions, giant American flag unfurling, live music from the 19th Street Band, music from DJ Stylus Chris, caricature artists, face painters, balloon twisters, photo ops and more. The Nationals-operated parking garages and lots open at 1 p.m., and gates open at 2 p.m. The first 20,000 fans will get an Opening Day reversible bucket hat.\n\nNationals games are typically broadcast on Mid-Atlantic Sports Network channels MASN or MASN2. Fans can also listen to the game live on 106.7 The Fan. Out-of-market games will also air on MLB.TV.\n\nFor those who still want to catch the Home Opener live, tickets are going for as low as $37 for upper level seats up to $583 for club seats, according to TickPick. Throughout the season, District of Columbia residents can get tickets in person at the box office for as low as $5 or $9 for prime games, $15 for marquee games and $25 for diamond games.\n\nThe Nationals are in the midst of a rebuild and last won the World Series in 2019. Projected season record, according to ESPN: 58-104.\n\nWorld Series Odds\n\nOddsmakers are straightforward about the Nationals' chances to win the World Series this year, giving them .66 percent odds to win it.\n\nThe Dodgers and Atlanta Braves enter the 2024 season with the best chance to win the World Series, according to the odds-aggregating website Oddschecker.com.\n\nOddsmakers gave the Dodgers about a 22 percent chance to win it all this year, and the Braves a 15 percent chance.\n\nThe Houston Astros, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies and Baltimore Orioles rounded out the top five at roughly 11 percent, 10 percent and 8 percent odds, respectively, with the Phillies and Orioles tying for fifth.\n\n2024 Storylines\n\nAmong the top storylines for this year: What will happen with new Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, who found himself embroiled in a gambling scandal last week when his interpreter wired at least $4.5 million from the star’s bank account to a bookmaker that is under federal investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, the A’s — in the midst of moving to Las Vegas —face an uncertain future about where they’ll play.\n\nThe Athletics’ community benefits deal with the Las Vegas Stadium Authority was unanimously approved last week. But they’ll still need three more agreements before the team can begin building a $1.5 billion planned stadium. The next planned stadium authority meeting is expected May 16.\n\nThe year will feature some big names vying for MVP, including Juan Soto, Aaron Judge, Julio Rodriguez, Corey Seager and Yordan Alvarez in the American League. Oddsmakers give Soto and Judge the best odds at 14 percent and 12 percent, respectively, with the others coming in at 9 percent, 7.5 percent, and 7.5 percent.\n\nIn the National League, oddsmakers give Ronald Acuña Jr. and Mookie Betts the best chance to win the MVP award at 16 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Ohtani, Fernando Tatis Jr. and Freddie Freeman have the next highest odds at 9.5 percent, 9 percent and 7.5 percent.\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
