        "text": "The Washington Nationals and Philadelphia Phillies are next up to head to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to play in the 2023 MLB Little League Classic. The game, which will be held on Sunday, August 20 and serve as a home contest for Washington, will air nationally that evening exclusively on ESPN’s “Sunday Night Baseball” at 7 p.m. (ET). The special event connected to the Little League Baseball® World Series also will be available on ESPN Radio, the ESPN App, and ESPN Deportes.\n\nAs is tradition for this annual occasion, Major Leaguers on the Phillies and Nationals will attend Little League Baseball World Series games earlier in the day on August 20, demonstrating their commitment to helping grow the game at the youth level and engage with young fans. Later that evening, Little League Baseball World Series players and their families will fill Historic Bowman Field for the MLB Little League Classic game.\n\nThe Little League Classic was launched in August 2017 between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the St. Louis Cardinals. The inaugural event was followed by the Philadelphia Phillies hosting the New York Mets in 2018, the Pirates returning to face the Chicago Cubs in 2019, the Cleveland Guardians facing the Los Angeles Angels in 2021, and then the Baltimore Orioles and Boston Red Sox competing in the 2022 event.\n\nThe Little League Baseball World Series is an international championship tournament for children, ages 10-12, held annually in Williamsport, the headquarters for Little League International. Countries from around the world compete on a global stage each year, with games airing on ESPN and streamed via the ESPN App. Little League International expanded the pool of teams in 2022, increasing it to 20 total teams. The 2023 Little League Baseball World Series will take place on August 16-27, 2023.\n\nNOTE: Tickets to the MLB Little League Classic are not available for public sale. With a limited capacity at the stadium, the participating players, coaches, and families of the 2023 Little League Baseball World Series will fill a significant portion of the capacity at Bowman Field. More information on the event, as it becomes available, can be found at MLB.com/LLClassic."
