The past few years of rebuilding, the Pirates have consistently been in the latter category. But this season, we’ve seen flashes of a team that may actually be playing meaningful fall games in theContinue reading “Corbin, Abrams Lead Nationals Over Pirates 6-2 (66-78)”\n\nOviedo Struggles As Bucs Drop Rain-Delayed Game 7-2 (20 – 9)\n\n4/30/23- By Michael Castrignano – @412DoublePlay on Twitter Some days, you drop 16 on a team and some days, you just flounder. Today, the team was a bit on the fishy side. Following a 2 ½ hour rain delay, Pirates were sluggish out of the gates, dropping the final game of the series 7-2 andContinue reading “Oviedo Struggles As Bucs Drop Rain-Delayed Game 7-2 (20 – 9)”\n\nPirates Put An Exclamation Point On The Evening: (20-8)\n\n4-29-23- By Craig W. Toth – @BucsBasement on Twitter When a team is feeling it-and I mean really feeling it-the chances of slowing them down are slim to none. This evening your Pittsburgh Pirates were a runaway freight train. In their path was the unfortunate victim in the form of the Washington Nationals; led byContinue reading “Pirates Put An Exclamation Point On The Evening: (20-8)”\n\nPittsburgh Pirates vs Washington Nationals Series Preview\n\nAfter an exciting series against the Dodgers, the Pirates hit the road to Washington to begin a six-game road trip.\n\nPirates Late Surge Leads 5-3 Victory Over Nationals\n\nComebacks are cool. Winning a game while resting stars, really cool.\n\nChavis and Hayes Ignite Pirates Past Nationals 6-4\n\nBucs win and look good doing it.\n\nPirates Can’t Capture The Elusive Sweep\n\nThe revolving door of the Pirates pitching staff has continued to rotate, and will more than likely remain in motion over the next few weeks as injuries persist, arms reach their limits and three to five inning starts remain the norm; not that this number has deviated very far from the medium throughout the season.Continue reading “Pirates Can’t Capture The Elusive Sweep”\n\nPirates Overcome Nationals 10-7\n\nWil Crowe started off very well, dominant even through three innings, unfortunately he was not capable facing the lineup twice, a theme we’ve seen with him repeatedly leading many to categorize him as a bullpen candidate.\n\nPirates Go Down Early, In More Ways Than One, And Come Back Late\n\nOver the previous two seasons-2019 and 2020-Steven Brault, when healthy, was the second best starter in the rotation; totaling 1.9 fWAR behind only Joe Musgrove (4.2), while posting a 4.23 ERA and a 1.35 WHIP. At times Brault showed brilliance on the mound, as the self proclaimed pitching machine, as evidenced by his 2 hit,Continue reading “Pirates Go Down Early, In More Ways Than One, And Come Back Late”\n\nPirates (23-44) Swept in Washington, Bell Bomb Game Winner\n\nWe’d like to see more efficiency from our starters. I know, you all want answers from the coach as to why he keeps saying he needs more from his starters, then immediately sets forth pulling them early, well, unless of course they’ve given up 5 runs in the first inning, then they get 5 orContinue reading “Pirates (23-44) Swept in Washington, Bell Bomb Game Winner”"
