        "text": "Hey, Everybody!\n\nThe 2024 season is officially upon us, and I wanted to take a moment to speak directly to you, our fans. You are our “27th man,” and we truly appreciate your passion and support. Even though we open the season in Cincinnati tomorrow, we’ll be back in D.C. on Monday to kick things off the right way. Opening Day in Washington D.C. is special, and I cannot wait to be a part of it once again.\n\nWe are coming off one of the best Spring Training camps that we have had since I became the manager. I truly believe that. This group worked as hard as any club out there every single day, and they pushed each other to be their absolute best every time they took the field.\n\nTo our fans who travelled down to West Palm Beach and to those in the community who support us every year in Spring Training…thank you. When we leave the clubhouse to practice every day, we know the group of supporters out there have our backs. We enjoy the interactions and conversations we have with you on the back fields early in the morning!\n\nWe made some tremendous strides last season, both as a club and individually, and we plan to build on that. As I told the boys in our first meeting on the Circle of Trust in Spring Training…We are not going to sneak up on any of our opponents. Teams know we’re coming.\n\nI love the mix of veterans, young players and rookies that we have in this clubhouse. There is talent on our Major League roster and there is more on the way. This is a group and an organization that fans can be proud of. I hope you’re as excited as I am about what is in store both this year and in years to come.\n\nGo 1–0 today!\n\n-Davey"
