        "text": "Category: Washington Nationals\n\nWizards, Caps, Mystics owner wants $600m in public cash to redo his privately owned arena\n\nWashington Wizards, Capitals, and Mystics owner Ted Leonsis is reportedly asking Washington, D.C. for some money to renovate his arena, which opened in 1997, according to a Washington Post story that I almost missed because it dropped on Friday night. How much money, you ask? Well, the Baltimore Orioles and Ravens up the road are each getting $600 million (plus more if the state wants), what do you say we do $600 million?\n\nThe funding would make up the bulk of an $800 million renovation plan Monumental has outlined to the city, according to the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. The remaining $200 million would be covered by Monumental, which is owned by founder and chief executive Ted Leonsis.\n\nOne of the people outlined the ask: Monumental would receive the $600 million over four years and use it mostly on construction. The major priorities are to transform the seating bowl — fewer nosebleed seats, more seats close to the court and ice — as well as add a food court that would be open during nongame hours and a new, glassy entrance at Seventh and F streets. Monumental wants to do incremental construction over four consecutive summers, starting in 2024, to avoid disrupting the playing seasons of the Capitals or Wizards, this person said.\n\nThe source here is “two people with knowledge of the situation,” which isn’t very specific at all, but the details are detailed enough that it seems like they’re coming from somewhere, anyway.\n\nThe teams’ arena is owned by Leonsis’s company Monumental Sports & Entertainment, and there’s nothing requiring D.C. to fund upgrades, but district officials sound pretty copacetic about writing some kind of large check regardless. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, asked about the possible arena renovation subsidy, replied with a joint statement with Monumental saying that “The District recognizes that Capital One Arena serves as an important economic anchor as we continue to reimagine and reinvigorate our Downtown,” so that certainly sounds like the district and Leonsis are working together on something. D.C. Council chair Phil Mendelson said he would need to know the details of any plan before taking a position, but did say he in general “supports giving Monumental public funds because the arena is an economic anchor in a fragile downtown” (the Post’s words, not his).\n\nAnd before you can get your bearings on this apparent $600 million ask that seems to have its political skids well-greased, the Post drops word down in paragraph six that Nationals owner Mark Lerner wants his own pile of public cash:\n\nThe Nationals, in September, sent local leaders a letter asking the city to repurpose parts of the existing “Ballpark Revenue Fund,” which is dedicated to paying off the municipal bonds floated to fund the construction of Nationals Park, into a “Ballpark Modernization & Sustainability Fund.” The proposal would put taxes on tickets, food and merchandise, taxes on parking and the lease payment into a new fund to maintain and modernize the city-owned ballpark, but it wouldn’t create a new tax or pull from other budgets.\n\nThat’s super-confusing wording, but it certainly sounds like now that the Nats’ stadium is two-thirds paid off, Lerner wants the taxes on in-stadium spending that are being currently kicked back to pay for about 30% of the cost of the stadium to start being kicked back instead to pay for future renovations of the stadium. How much would that amount to? The in-stadium tax money was initially projected to amount to $11-14 million a year back in 2004; I can’t find any more recent figures, but just assuming a standard rate of inflation that would be $20 million a year today, and more in the future, meaning Lerner’s ask could easily be worth well over $300 million in diverted future taxes that would otherwise go to the district treasury.\n\nWith the way stadium subsidy numbers are going, it’s easy to start getting a little jaded — oh, only $300 million, at least that’s not over a billion like some MLB owners I could mention. But between the Wizards, Capitals, Mystics, and Nationals, D.C. could easily be looking at over a billion dollars to zhuzh up sports venues that it expected to be done paying for now — and in the case of the arena didn’t even pay for in the first place — just because “economic anchors.” How big an anchor are they? Oh, hello, Stanford sports economist Roger Noll:\n\nNoll said even when a new stadium is built, a city gets about as many full-time jobs as a Macy’s department store.\n\nNobody ever talks about spending $600 million to upgrade a Macy’s, but then, Macy’s probably doesn’t have as many lobbyists.\n\nD.C. spending tax money on Nats stadium faster than expected, local TV station hails this as success\n\nAs any semi-regular reader of this site already knows, there is a lot of bad journalism going on out there around sports stadiums and arenas. But once in a great while comes an article that reaches new, heretofore-unseen levels of badness, and one can only marvel at the human ability for innovation.\n\nOne such article ran yesterday on the site of Washington, D.C.’s WUSA TV station, under the headline “Can sports stadiums be good business for taxpayers?” (An accompanying video report is linked at the top of the web item.) Not a promising start, but at least you’d expect a routinely bothsidesed piece along the lines of “some team owners and politicians say yes, people who’ve actually studied it say no.” But WUSA ups the ante with this key cluster of paragraphs:\n\n[University of Maryland Baltimore County economist Dennis] Coates has studied and written papers on the impact of professional sports venues on local economies for years.\n\n“I mean, maybe they break even,” Coates said when asked if local government’s make back what they invest in stadium and arena construction. “But that’s highly doubtful.”\n\nBut data obtained by WUSA9 revealed that’s turning out not to be true of Nationals Park. According to the DC Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the District is ahead of schedule repaying the bonds it took out to help build it.\n\nA little more than halfway through the deal, the District has paid back 67% of the debt thanks to excess revenues generated from all the growth in Navy Yard. In fact, $102 million of that excess revenue is being funneled to D.C.’s general fund over the next five years.\n\nThat, to put it bluntly, is not how taxes work, or at least not how the conjunction “but” works. And it’s especially not how the taxes that are being funneled into paying off Nationals Park work. More than half of that money is coming from a new tax surcharge on D.C.-area businesses, and while it’s nice that those businesses are doing well and tax revenues are up, it’s hardly money “generated from all the growth in the Navy Yard”: If D.C. had passed the same tax and put the proceeds into the general fund, it would now have an extra $300 million or so to spend on schools or roads or something.\n\nMore than half of the remainder, meanwhile, is coming from sales taxes on tickets and in-stadium concessions sales, a large chunk of which is certainly being redirected from other spending that would have generated sales tax revenues for the general fund. (Unless you think that nobody who goes to Nats games would have set foot in the city otherwise; given the proximity of suburbs outside the city limits, the cannibalization effect is likely less in D.C. than in some other cities, but it’s still going to be significant.) So again, “the District is ahead of schedule repaying the bonds” is just a sign that it’s siphoning off tax revenue from the general fund faster than expected.\n\nCoates appears to be on vacation and thus not immediately able to respond, and the foremost Twitter guardian against terrible economic reporting, J.C. Bradbury, is busy dragging The Oklahoman editorial board for writing that giving $850 million to the Thunder owners for a new arena is “more nuanced than dollars and cents,” sure, that’s another strong contender for worst journalism of the week, though at least that didn’t claim to be a news article. But really we don’t need any fresh takes on this, because we covered all this seven years ago, when a Washington Times sports columnist made the exact same argument — prompted by then-D.C. councilmember Jack Evans, who spearheaded the push for the Nats stadium subsidy in the first place — and it was equally nonsensical then.\n\nIn the end, this all ends up being a variation on the Casino Night Fallacy that any money that is somehow touched by a development deal somehow becomes money attributable to that deal, even if it’s tax money that the government could have otherwise pocketed to use on something else. For a conceit that was come up with by an unheralded Odd Couple scriptwriter — okay, actually Lowell Ganz, who is Hollywood comedy royalty even if he also was co-creator of “Joanie Loves Chachi” — it has proven surprisingly strong at explaining one way in which people can be convinced to get things entirely wrong. I can only hope that one day it will make its appearance on my favorite Wikipedia page, without which I would never have known what a Chewbacca defense is.\n\nFriday roundup: Billionaires all over get cash for their stadiums and arenas and car plants and movie shoots (I got a rock)\n\nHappy Friday! Ready for a heaping helping of news about America’s elected officials and business leaders working together to ensure smart investments of public dollars that will build a better tomorrow? If so, I am sorry to inform you that you have accidentally clicked on the wrong website, but if you stick around you may be rewarded with some grim laughs, or at least some links to old comic strips.\n\nFront Office Sports reports that the Oakland city council passed a resolution this week calling for the WNBA to grant their city an expansion team, which is toothless and not all that interesting, then also mentions that the $180 million federal subsidy request Oakland has pending with the federal government for an A’s stadium is through the Department of Transportation’s RAISE program, which is supposed to “build and repair critical pieces of our freight and passenger transportation networks,” judging projects “on their merits to help ensure that taxpayers are getting the highest value for every dollar invested.” Oakland “is not expecting to receive the full amount,” Front Office Sports writes, which is either a euphemism for the city getting a lower amount or for the city getting a polite rejection letter.\n\nNorfolk city officials want to build a new arena for no team in particular — you may recall nearby Virginia Beach proposing an arena to lure an NBA team a few years back, then bailing when its financing plans repeatedly collapsed — and city manager Chip Filer says he “anticipates” other cities in the region chipping in (see what I did there) to help pay for it. The city managers of Virginia Beach and Chesapeake immediately replied that “no active discussions are taking place,” but can’t get if you don’t ask, I guess, though you can still get derisively made fun of.\n\nArlington Heights officials rejected a petition from the Koch brothers–connected Americans for Prosperity to ban public subsidies for a new Chicago Bears stadium (or any other businesses) on the grounds that it didn’t have enough valid signatures, though the group can always go back and get more and resubmit. The Chicago Tribune’s article on this also includes a new rendering that I hadn’t seen before of featuring young people in generic fall clothing ambling past a stadium while a couple of them carry enormous “BEAR DOWN” flags, seriously has anyone involved in sports stadium renderings ever actually been to a sporting event even?\n\nHawaii Gov. David Ige has called a halt to work on building a $350 million replacement for Aloha Stadium in order to speed up construction by no longer using any private money at all, just state money. No, you’re right, none of that makes any sense, but nothing about this project has made sense from the start, so why change things up now?\n\nDallas Mayor Eric Johnson wants voters to increase hotel taxes in order to tear down and rebuild the city’s convention center and use the site for a baseball or soccer stadium for a new team — yes, Dallas already has the Texas Rangers and F.C. Dallas, but those teams actually play in Arlington and Frisco, and surely MLB and MLS would approve new teams playing just one city over once they saw how cool a new city-funded stadium in Dallas was, right? (That’s your cue for the grim laughter.)\n\nWashington, D.C., is going to give the Washington Nationals stadium a one-year certificate of occupancy extension after all, which means the team won’t be evicted in the midst of going for a team-record 104 losses, so much for cities playing hardball.\n\nThe Center for Economic Accountability, the people with those excellent stadium stickers, put out a report last week revealing that local elected officials proposed nine separate billion-dollar-or-more corporate subsidy deals in 2022, the most in any one year in history. That includes New York state’s $1 billion for the Buffalo Bills and Maryland’s $1.2 billion for the Baltimore Ravens and Orioles, but also $2.1 billion from Ohio for an Intel computer chip plant and $1.8 billion from Georgia for a Hyundai electric car plant. And that doesn’t even count ongoing subsidies like Georgia’s annual underwriting of 30% of the costs of filming all those Marvel (and other) movies in their state, which the legislature briefly considered capping at $900 million a year but decided to let soar beyond that number in order to be “cautious.” In short, it’s a good time to be a rich person in America, though that’s been true for a while now.\n\nNats Park probably won’t be shut down amid squabble over failed development, but it’s fun to imagine\n\nThere’s a long history across many cities of “ballpark district” developments failing to come to fruition, or at least taking way longer than initially planned, and the Washington Nationals stadium environs were no exception. Though construction has picked up in recent years, there’s still 46,000 square feet of commercial and retail space that Events D.C. promised to build that hasn’t happened, and now the District is apparently threatening not to renew the stadium’s certificate of occupancy when it expires at the end of the month if Events D.C. doesn’t agree to follow through on its promises:\n\nInstead of the original development, Events DC has proposed to finish a considerably smaller, 17,000-square-foot structure that’s already attached to the ballpark at First Street SE and Potomac Avenue SE as retail-only space…\n\nThe Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, in a maneuver upping the pressure on Events DC to follow through on its promised development, has said it will not renew the temporary certificate of occupancy the ballpark has used to operate since Opening Day in March 2008.\n\nThat certificate is set to expire Sept. 30, according to the Washington Business Journal, which first reported the snafu. The Nationals’ final home game of the season is scheduled for Oct. 2.\n\nThis is unusual not just in that it’s a rare example of a city government playing hardball with a developer, but of just who the developer is: Events D.C. is the District’s own quasi-public development arm, which owns and operates Nationals Park, in part to get the team owners off the hook from construction and property tax costs. One arm of government going toe-to-toe with another in a dispute over failed promises is about three steps beyond “unusual,” but here we are.\n\nWhether this is seriously a threat that the Nats will have to go play their final home games of the year in the street (or just forfeit, they’re going to lose them anyway) depends on which newspaper you read: The Washington Post says the DCRA is “effectively threatening to shut down the stadium,” while the Washington Business Journal, which first reported on this kerfuffle on Thursday, indicates that it’s more Events D.C. using brinksmanship to renegotiate its deal, asking for a last-second rework of its development plan in order to get a permanent C of O in place by the end of the month. Events D.C.’s lawyer wrote in the company’s zoning application that DCRA “has indicated it is unwilling to issue another temporary certificate of occupancy while the Applicant continues to identify ways to satisfy the Order,” but that’s less an overt eviction threat than a developer threatening that it will be forced to shutter its building if not allowed to back out on its commitments — so if somebody’s playing hardball here, it’s probably not the city government.\n\nAs for the Nationals owners, they didn’t respond to the Post’s request for comment, but they did reply to the WBJ, saying in an emailed statement: “We are confident that as Events D.C. and the D.C. Zoning Commission work out the final terms of a permanent certificate of occupancy, we will continue to operate without restrictions as we always have.” All of which seems likely, since the District has no particular reason to want to padlock the stadium, even if it also has no reason to want to approve Events D.C. building a building one-third the size of what it promised. The D.C. Zoning Commission has a hearing scheduled on this whole mess for Sept. 29, one day before the certificate of occupancy expires — if nothing else, this should provide more last-second drama than watching a Nationals game.\n\nFriday roundup: Reds exec says team will only demand renovation money, threatens to move if fans ask for better players\n\nThis has officially been the longest week ever. Scientists agree! And so does the news:\n\nCincinnati Reds president Phil Castellini said it’s his “opinion” that neither the Reds nor Bengals will demand new stadiums when their leases are up soon, just renovations, and shouldn’t he actually be in a position to say more than just an opinion? Anyway, given that the Baltimore Orioles and Ravens just got $1.2 billion for renovations, maybe Castellini is thinking, hmmm, we can still get hundreds of millions of dollars and not have to spend anything of our own on building from scratch, huh?, so yeah, checks out. Castellini also spent the week telling fans that they shouldn’t complain about the Reds getting rid of all their best players to save money because “what would you do with this team to have it more profitable, make more money, compete more in the current economic system that this game exist? It would be to pick it up and move it somewhere else. Be careful what you ask for.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul added another defense of her $1 billion public cash giveaway to the Buffalo Bills owners, saying that people upstate complain about her spending money on the New York City subways, and isn’t that the same thing? Looks like somebody wants to give Crystal Peoples-Stokes a run for her money this year!\n\nSpeaking of fire sales and dumb reasons to build things, the San Jose Mercury News has looked at the Oakland A’s ownership’s insistence that only a new stadium can stop them from continually selling off their best players and noted that A’s owner John Fisher isn’t spending on payroll for his San Jose Earthquakes despite a new stadium. Which isn’t quite the same thing thanks to MLS’s single-entity ownership structure, but it’s at least more investigation than most news outlets have done into this argument.\n\nAnd speaking of baseball teams cheaping-out of player spending, it was revealed this week that the Pittsburgh Pirates bring in enough in ticket sales and concessions alone each year to pay for their entire player payroll. Add in at least $100 million a year in national TV revenue, plus local TV revenue, plus league revenue-sharing, and “not having money” isn’t really an excuse for either not signing free agents or demanding new stadiums. (“Wanting more money” is, but that’s not quite the same thing.)\n\n“Developers and analysts” in Las Vegas aren’t concerned about glutting the market for arenas now that Tim Leiweke’s Oak View Group wants to build one to go along with the 23 others (estimated) that the city already has, because 1) Leiweke “knows what he’s doing” (Vegas convention authority CEO Steve Hill), 2) Leiweke “is following the blueprint that he’s done in the past” (Oak View partner Marc Badain), 3) some performers may prefer a newer arena to an older one (Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon), 4) “we need to make sure that demand matches supply” (Vegas-based advisory firm B Global managing partner Brendan Bussmann), 5) “what a lot of people don’t realize is how many events we actually say no to just because of the lack of availability” (MGM arena manager Dan Quinn). That doesn’t quite add up to “there’s plenty of room for another arena” so much as “if an arena fails due to glut, it probably won’t be the new one that Oak View builds,” but at least Leiweke is talking about using all private money so far, so that’s a relief — at least until one of the other arenas demands public money to compete with the new one.\n\nIn that same Nevada Independent article, Gov. Steve Sisolak backed away from his unsourced-reported refusal to provide public money for an Oakland A’s stadium, saying “there are other things that can be done that can help on the funding” such as a tax-kickback district or infrastructure money. How much money? Maybe that would be a good followup questions, Nevada Independent? No? Okay, it’s your paper, I guess.\n\nWashington Post columnist Sally Jenkins says Washington Commanders owner Daniel Snyder doesn’t deserve public funding for a new stadium because he may have illegally cheated fans out of ticket deposits and other NFL owners out of revenue-sharing money. Which, those aren’t good things, certainly, but 1) doing not-good things is already Snyder’s brand, and 2) the contrapositive of this would seem to be that if he weren’t doing anything illegal, Snyder would deserve public funding, which is a dubious corollary to hitch your newspaper column to.\n\nNBC Sports’ Mike Florio says Nashville’s $10-20 million a year in hotel taxes could pay for $700 million worth of Tennessee Titans stadium, which is definitely not how math works, but then understanding how things work has never been Florio’s strong suit.\n\nThe Kansas City Royals could use the Atlanta Braves stadium district as a model for a new downtown ballpark, according to … whoa, Kevin Collison, where’s he been since he stopped being the Kansas City Star’s go-to stadium-boosting columnist? Something called CitySceneKC, apparently, guess times are tough all over. Anyway, arguing that a pretend urban neighborhood in the middle of the suburbs could be a model for moving a team from the suburbs to downtown makes no sense, but you keep doing you, Kevin.\n\nThe Lerner family is considering selling the Washington Nationals, which normally might bring up fears of a move threat and new stadium demands, but the Nats’ stadium is only … huh, 14 years old already? That still seems a little soon, but as economist Rod Fort memorably said, there’s nothing wrong with demanding a new stadium every year if you can get away with it.\n\nPawtucket’s $400 million soccer stadium and development project is facing cost overruns thanks to inflation, and nobody knows yet who’ll pay for them, or if the project will be scaled back, or what. Rhode Island is already kicking back $46.2 million in taxes for the project, or, no, WPRI-TV says it’s actually $70 million? If a cost overrun falls in the forest and there’s no one around keeping track, does it count?\n\nSpeaking of cost overruns, Durham will now be paying $10.6 million toward upgrades for the Bulls‘ minor-league baseball stadium, double what it was originally expecting but still little enough compared to the numbers being thrown around in other cities as to sound absolutely insignificant. (Note to readers: $10.6 million is still $10.6 million. I checked.)\n\nHere’s a fun one: The Wichita Wind Surge have started adding an 8% “ballpark development fee” to all sales at their new publicly funded ballpark, a surcharge that doesn’t appear anywhere on the pricing until you actually get your receipt. This sounds like a tax, but it’s not, as Wichita Mayor Brandon Whipple said it’s the first he’s hearing of it, and suggested that the state attorney general should look into it as “a consumer protection issue.” Sports team owners really do do the craziest things!\n\nAdd Hawaii to the list of states momentarily flush with COVID relief cash that have decided now’s a great time to spend on stadiums, as a bill to dump $350 million on a replacement for Aloha Stadium is making its way through the state legislature.\n\nThe Seattle Mariners are making $55 million in improvements to their stadium, and actually paying for it themselves, which shouldn’t be cause for celebration or anything since that’s what normal businesses do normally, but we’ll take what we can get these days.\n\nFriday roundup: Pandemic could delay Rams and Chargers stadium, drain hotel tax base for Raiders stadium (and kill millions of people, oh yeah)\n\nAnd so we come to the close of Week 2 of Coronavirusworld, with still little way of knowing what Week 3 will bring, let alone Week 8 and beyond. (I just now started to write about this far less grim response to Tuesday’s London study, until I noticed none of the authors are infectious disease specialists and the claim that contact tracing can keep infections under control was cited to a single Chinese news story that said nothing of the sort, so maybe stay grim for the moment?) With pretty much all of the sports world now shut down, though — except for Australian Rules Football for some reason — sports journalists have begun looking down the road at longer-term effects of the pandemic, resulting in some useful and some not-so-useful reporting:\n\nAll of California is now under “shelter-in-place” orders, which looks like it will shut down for the time being construction on the new Los Angeles Rams and Chargers stadium, as construction work is not considered an “essential” work task like medical services or food provision. So it’s up in the air whether the stadium will be ready by its planned opening this fall, though of course it’s also up in the air whether the NFL will be ready this fall. (Side note: I hope Gov. Andrew Cuomo lets New York City go on shelter-in-place soon, not just because it’s the best way to avoid a healthcare disaster, but because it’s been really hard to avoid all social contact and get work done at home when there’s a crew digging up the street outside my apartment every morning starting at 7:30 am.)\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals are still locked in a legal battle over control of TV rights in their shared territory, which could only become more important if the pandemic results in TV becoming even more dominant as the way people watch sports (and the way sports teams make money).\n\nSpeaking of TV, the NBA is reportedly still getting paid TV rights money even though play is suspended. I bet a whole lot of contract lawyers are either kicking themselves or patting themselves on the back right now for what clauses they wrote into deals regarding acts of God. (Note: Studies of God’s responsibility for the spread of coronavirus have yet to be peer-reviewed.)\n\nHere’s a New York Times article on how the loss of income from shutting down sports will affect various leagues, at least to the best of our knowledge without seeing all of their contract clauses.\n\nOf course there are articles about how shutting down sports will devastate local economies, whether it’s the cancellation of spring training or of the NCAA tournament or what. Pay no mind, I guess, to the fact that when spring training attendance dropped 60% during the replacement-players spring of 1995, there was no measurable economic impact on Florida — and pay even less mind to the fact that whether people are spending money on sports is way less important than whether coronavirus lockdowns will destroy the entire economy. Bad economics may be bad, but it’s easy to squeeze an article out of on deadline!\n\nThe collapse of tourism will, however, take a particular hit on hotel tax revenues, which just happen to be what Nevada is planning to use to pay for its new Las Vegas Raiders stadium. The state has a year and a half of reserve funds, but if tourism never takes off again to the degree it was at before travel for pleasure became a distant memory, we could see some scrabbling under sofa cushions for where to find another few hundred million dollars.\n\nA “coalition of shipping, trucking and steel companies” is suing to stop the proposed Oakland A’s stadium at Howard Terminal from being fast-tracked through environmental review, at least if they can find any courts open during shelter-in-place.\n\nMLB teams have finally agreed to kick in $1 million each to pay stadium workers during the delay to the start of the season, though I haven’t been able to find details on how many weeks of lost income that will cover. They’re also paying minor leaguers $400 a week each through at least April 8, with an extension beyond that likely. (Yes, that’s next to nothing, but it’s the same next to nothing minor leaguers normally have to live on, so that’s … better? Worse? Definitely one of those.)\n\nAnd finally, here’s an article that won’t age well: A’s president Dave Kaval asking “a fan who has said he has tested positive for coronavirus” to throw out the first pitch at the team’s opening day, wherever that is. That’s gonna make for one crowded mound.\n\nCouncilmember credits new sports venues for D.C. not being like Detroit, which is lousy with new sports venues\n\nSomewhere in the middle of this mess of a World Series media cycle — after the assistant GM berating female reporters scandal but before the booing of Donald Trump and flashing of Gerrit Cole — the New York Times ran a puff piece on Washington Nationals fans that came down to “86 years since a World Series, Baby Shark, our troubled times, blah blah blah.” But Pat Garofalo, in his Billionaire Boondoggle newsletter, noted one paragraph that stood out as exceptionally evidence-free:\n\nWhen the ballpark opened in the Navy Yard neighborhood 11 years ago, the area was struggling to move past decades of drugs and violence. It was a wasteland of car repair shops, garbage truck parking lots and asphalt factories. But the ballpark led the way for restaurants, condos and hotels, and Audi Field, home of Major League Soccer’s D.C. United, down the street.\n\nWe’ve covered the Stadium Catalyst Fallacy in this space before: Look at a sports venue, look at development taking place around it, and declare “mission accomplished.” But when you have a sports facility being built in a neighborhood that is already ripe for development — which was absolutely the case in D.C., if only because there are few sites anywhere in the District that aren’t being eyed for development — then, as Garofalo notes, “We can’t know for sure what would have happened in the alternative universe in which the Nationals never came to D.C. and Nats Park was never built.”\n\nThen Garofalo digs up another recent quote about the Nationals’ alleged economic windfall for D.C. that is even more bizarre:\n\n“Where would we be without the arena, the convention center and hotel, the ballpark, Audi soccer stadium,” Evans asks and answers, “We’d be Detroit, a city still struggling in every respect.”\n\nThat’s D.C. city councilmember Jack Evans, the godfather of Nationals Park, in a recent Washington City Paper article about how the stadium deal “nearly fell apart.” (The article doesn’t really explain that bit, but if you want the fuller recap, it’s covered both in the later chapters of Field of Schemes and here on this site as well.) Notes Garofalo:\n\nWhat a weird comparison for Evans to make: Detroit also has publicly-funded sports stadiums, as well as convention centers and hotels. The chief difference between the cities is that Detroit’s main industry — automaking — went bust, and D.C.’s — the business of government — didn’t. No soccer field or convention center changed that.\n\nI would suggest that we all point and laugh at Jack Evans for being a doofus, but presumably everyone is already pointing and laughing at Evans’ ongoing ethics scandals, so to double down would be cruel, if fun.\n\nFriday roundup: Ex-D.C. mayor says his $534m Nats stadium expense was worth it, Clippers arena stymied by car trouble, MLS franchise fees to go even higher\n\nShouldn’t posting items more regularly during the week leave less news to round up on Fridays? I’m pretty sure that’s how it’s supposed to work, but here I am on Friday with even more browser tabs open than usual, and I’m sure someone is still going to complain that I left out, say, the latest on arena site discussions in Saskatoon. I guess lemme type really fast and see how many I can get through before my fingers fall off:\n\nThe Washington Nationals will host their first-ever World Series games starting tonight, which means it’s time to look at whether the city’s $534 million stadium expense has paid off (the mayor who approved it says yes, a local economist says no!) and at what’s happened to some of the business owners who were forcibly relocated to make way for the stadium (some of them are going to the games, but that doesn’t mean they’re happy about the whole eviction thing!). This is all presumably more interesting than actually watching the games on TV, which fewer and fewer people are doing — I know I’m probably not a representative data point, but I for one haven’t been watching much because I’ve reached my capacity for 1) postseason baseball, 2) John Smoltz, and 3) that Postmates ad where the guy falls out the window.\n\nThe California Air Resources Board still doesn’t want to sign off on the Los Angeles Clippers‘ proposed arena, as far as I can understand it because the board thinks more arenas mean more events and thus more people driving fossil-fuel-burning cars to them? I mean, maybe, but wouldn’t this be an argument for banning every new sports venue, let alone every shopping mall or anything else you have to drive to? Not that I’m opposed to that, mind you, just trying to understand the logic here.\n\nMLS commissioner Don Garber says that the expansion fee for the league’s next new team will be more than $200 million. despite MLS teams’ average operating income being around –$2.8 million a year. Ahem.\n\nThe Atlanta Dream are moving to a smaller arena nearer to the airport, which should do wonders for attendance by people who like to fly to other cities to watch WNBA games. Or maybe people who want to catch a WNBA game while waiting to change flights?\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers owners are spending $100 million on a new centerfield plaza to include “food, entertainment, and a statue of Sandy Koufax,” and some local residents are concerned this will create more traffic and noise. No, I can’t explain anything in that sentence, just chalk it up to 2019 being unutterably stupid.\n\n“This premium era of sports—taking the largely populist experience of going to a game and turning it into a luxurious one—began out of necessity. As player salaries rose in the 1970s, so did the need for teams to find new ways to generate revenue,” writes a magazine for rich people, which gets completely backwards the causal relationship between player salaries and ticket prices, but I guess rich people prefer to read that high ticket prices are the fault of greedy players rather than themselves having too much money to burn.\n\nDallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban says he will take another “five, six years” to decide whether to keep his team at its current arena, which is all of 18 years old.\n\nA former Mobile BayBears exec says Mobile’s Hank Aaron Stadium may never get another minor-league baseball team now that the BayBears are leaving town, because the stadium is too antiquated. Hank Aaron Stadium in 22 years old.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks are replacing 3,500 cup holders at their one-year-old arena, because the old ones were no longer state of the art.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons suck, and nobody wants to go see their games even if they do play in a snazzy new stadium with $2 hot dogs.\n\nNYC F.C. still wants to build a new stadium of its own, and a poll of South Bronx residents and business owners shows they’d be fine with that, so long as the team pays property taxes, unlike the Yankees. Hey, what ever happened to that rumored plan to rush through approval of a stadium before Election Day, anyway?\n\nA reporter for the Las Vegas Review-Journal went to the trouble of timing how long it takes to drive from the Raiders‘ new off-site parking lots to their new stadium in “normal traffic,” which would be very useful if only the presence of a 65,000-seat NFL stadium wasn’t likely to change what “normal traffic” will be. Seriously, does the Review-Journal even have editors anymore, or have the bots taken that over too?"
