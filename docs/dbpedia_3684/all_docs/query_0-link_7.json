        "text": "Morales (thumb) has gone 3-for-12 with a home run, a stolen base, four walks, three runs and two RBI in four games since being reinstated from Double-A Harrisburg's 7-day injured list Thursday.\n\nMorales had been out of action for nearly three months due to a left thumb injury before he made his return to the Harrisburg lineup last week. The 22-year-old third baseman is slashing .239/.327/.359 with three home runs and three stolen bases across 162 plate appearances for the Double-A club this season.\n\nThe Nationals are expected to call up Chaparro from Triple-A Rochester ahead of Tuesday's game against the Angels, Andrew Golden of The Washington Post reports.\n\nWashington acquired Chaparro at the trade deadline in a deal that sent relief pitcher Dylan Floro to the Diamondbacks. The 25-year-old infielder will get his first taste of the big leagues after he combined to hit .328 with 23 home runs, 85 RBI, 76 runs and three stolen bases over 105 games with Triple-A Reno and Triple-A Rochester this season. With Jose Tena sustaining a thumb injury Sunday that could force him to the injured list, Chaparro could end up replacing him as the Nationals' primary option at third base in the short term.\n\nYoung went 2-for-4 with a solo home run and an additional run scored Sunday against the Angels.\n\nYoung's eighth-inning homer off fellow rookie Jack Kochanowicz broke up a scoreless outing by the young righty. He followed that up with an infield single then later scored as the Nats made a last-ditch albeit futile effort at a comeback in the ninth. It was the 24th multi-hit effort for Young this season and raised his average to .250 with two homers, 24 RBI, 62 runs and 27 steals in 33 attempts across 340 at-bats.\n\nTena (thumb) had X-rays come back negative after leaving Sunday's game against the Angels and is dealing with a fingernail issue, Spencer Nusbaum of The Washington Post reports.\n\nThe 23-year-old made his second straight start at third base Sunday but exited during the fourth inning when he was struck in the right hand by a hard grounder. Tena has avoided a serious injury and should be considered day-to-day.\n\nGore (7-10) was saddled with the loss Sunday, allowing five runs (zero earned) on five hits and six walks over four innings against the Angels. He struck out two.\n\nGore produced a bit of a weird line, as it was just the second time all year he failed to allow an earned run, thanks to a fielding error by Jose Tena that directly allowed one run to score and helped set up four more. That's where Gore took over, walking four of a season-high six batters in the fateful fourth that culminated with a bases-clearing double by Kevin Pillar. Gore was removed after the inning and saddled with his 10th loss of the season. Gore was coming off his first win in nearly two months following his last start and will look to rebound in his next slated matchup, against the Phillies in the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nTena was removed in the fourth inning of Sunday's game against the Angels due to an apparent right thumb injury, Mark Zuckerman of MASNSports.com reports. He went hitless in his lone at-bat before departing.\n\nMaking a second straight start at third base after he went 2-for-4 with two RBI in his Nationals debut Saturday, Tena's day was cut short when he took a hard grounder off his throwing hand. The play went down as an error, and Tena was immediately lifted from the game in favor of Ildemaro Vargas while his thumb was bleeding profusely. The Nationals should have an update on Tena's condition later Sunday.\n\nAbrams (back) is out of the lineup for Sunday's game against the Angels, Mark Zuckerman of MASNSports.com reports.\n\nAbrams sat out the past two games due to back spasms and said Saturday he was hoping return for Tuesday's matchup with the Orioles, so his absence from the lineup Sunday isn't surprising. The 23-year-old will have Monday's team off day to aid in his recovery ahead of Tuesday's series opener. Nasim Nunez will start at shortstop and bat eighth in Abrams' place.\n\nVargas is out of the lineup for Sunday's game against the Angels.\n\nAfter making five consecutive starts, Vargas now finds himself on the bench for the second day in a row, with both absences coming against right-handed pitching. Though the Nationals optioned Vargas' main competition for playing time at third base, Trey Lipscomb, to Triple-A Rochester on Saturday, the club called up Jose Tena in a corresponding move. Tena will get his second straight start at the hot corner Sunday and looks like he'll be given a look as an everyday player while Vargas shifts to a utility role.\n\nRuiz is out of the lineup for Sunday's game against the Angels, Mark Zuckerman of MASNSports.com reports.\n\nRuiz has gone 1-for-11 with a walk and two RBI in the past three games, and he'll head to the bench for Sunday's series finale. Riley Adams will bat eighth and catch for lefty MacKenzie Gore.\n\nTena went 2-for-4 with two RBI in Saturday's 5-4 extra-inning win over the Angels.\n\nPicked up as part of the package the Nationals got from the Guardians for Lane Thomas, Tena was promoted from Triple-A Rochester earlier in the day and was immediately plugged into the starting lineup at third base. The move paid off when the 23-year-old walked it off in the bottom of the 10th inning with an RBI single to left-center field that likely would have gone for extra bases had there been any need for Tena to keep advancing. He has a .284/.342/.478 slash line through 100 games at Triple-A this season with 18 homers and 15 steals, and with Trey Lipscomb having flopped in his latest audition, Tena figures to get a long look, either as the regular starter at the hot corner or in a super-utility role.\n\nCorbin came away with a no-decision in Saturday's 5-4 extra-inning win over the Angels, giving up four runs on eight hits and three walks over four-plus innings. He struck out two.\n\nThe 35-year-old lefty remains arguably the worst regular starter in MLB. Corbin has a rough 7.25 ERA, 1.64 WHIP and 32:10 K:BB through seven starts and 36 innings since the beginning of July, and his 5.98 ERA on the season is the highest in the majors among qualified pitchers. Should Cade Cavalli (elbow) make it back before the end of the season, it'll likely be Corbin who gets bumped from the rotation to make room for him, but until then the Nationals don't seem to have any better options. Corbin lines up to make his next trip to the mound on the road next weekend in Philadelphia.\n\nVargas is not in the starting lineup for Saturday's game against the Angels, Spencer Nusbaum of The Washington Post reports.\n\nVargas will begin Saturday's contest in the dugout after going 0-for-4 with one strikeout in Friday's 3-2 win over the Halos. Jose Tena will make his Nationals debut at third base while Nasim Nunez returns to the lineup at shortstop.\n\nTena is starting at third base and batting sixth in Saturday's game against the Angels, Spencer Nusbaum of The Washington Post reports.\n\nTena was recalled from Triple-A Rochester earlier Saturday, and he will make his first start for the big club since being acquired from the Guardians on July 29. In the minors this season, Tena is batting .287 with an .824 OPS, 18 home runs and 68 RBI over 448 plate appearances.\n\nAbrams (back) is not in the starting lineup for Saturday's game against the Angels, Spencer Nusbaum of The Washington Post reports.\n\nAbrams told reporters Saturday that he first felt his back issues flare up Thursday during rain delays, which led to his removal from Friday's lineup, per Bobby Blanco of MASNSports.com. With the Nationals scheduled for an off day Monday, Abrams will be held out for the weekend series against the Angels and aim to return Tuesday for the series opener against the Orioles. The 23-year-old has struggled from the plate since the All-Star break and is slashing .165/.212/.266 with nine runs scored, two home runs and 11 RBI across 83 plate appearances.\n\nThe Nationals optioned Lipscomb to Triple-A Rochester on Saturday, Spencer Nusbaum of The Washington Post reports.\n\nAfter being recalled by the Nationals on July 6, Lipscomb slowly saw his playing time dwindle as he struggled to a .152/.211/.182 slash line with a 23.6 percent strikeout rate across 71 plate appearances. With Ildemaro Vargas establishing a regular role at the hot corner, Lipscomb will go back down to Rochester, where he will have an everyday role at third base. Jose Tena was recalled from Rochester in a corresponding move."
