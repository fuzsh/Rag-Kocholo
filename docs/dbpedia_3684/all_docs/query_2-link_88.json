Guests can pre-order at their discretion from the suite menu. Most suites do not include catering. On average, clients spend about $100 per person on food and alcohol, however, there is no catering minimum and it is optional.\n\n×\n\nCatering Details\n\nFollowing a suite purchase, you will be provided with the suite menu and necessary order forms to complete your order. A pre-order deadline is typically one week prior to the date of your event. You won't be charged for what you ordered until day of the event. If needed, you can also order food and drinks from the suite through your suite attendant.\n\nParking and Transportation\n\nSuite parking is located in the Geico Garage (formerly Garage B). The entrance is located on N Street SE and can be accessed by either Van Street SE or South Capitol Street SE. The Geico Garage will open 3 hours prior to the start of the game and will close 1 hour after the conclusion of the game.\n\nBudget\n\nA suite at Nationals Park for a Nationals game could cost between $4,500 - $8,000 on average. The pricing varies based on the day of game, the opponent, and the location of the suite. Washington suites will typically be the most expensive followed by Lincoln and then Jefferson suites.\n\nDress Code\n\nAll Nationals Park luxury suites are climate-controlled. Attire varies widely among suite patrons. If you're attending a business event, it may be more appropriate to dress in business casual or business formal attire. Otherwise, typical ballpark attire like jerseys or fan gear is more than fine.\n\nVenue Bag Policy\n\nNo bags larger than 16\" x 16\" x 8\" will be allowed into Nationals Park. All bags are subject to inspection. Guests are prohibited from bringing hard containers into Nationals Park. Metal, plastic or glass containers of any kind are prohibited.\n\nEntrances\n\nFor quickest entry into the stadium, use the Media and Suites entrances located on South Capitol Street across from P Street and the Third Base Gate entrance across from O Street. Immediately after entering, there will be an elevator on your right that will take you up to the “Suite Level.”\n\nChild Ticket Policy\n\nChildren 2 years of age and under are not required to have a ticket to enter the ballpark.

If this is the case, certain clients are willing to pay a premium to be in a lower level suite that is closest to the action on the field. We will give you details on suite location as we provide you with availability for the game you desire.\n\nDoes it pay to wait to book a suite until closer to the event?\n\nWith regular tickets, prices will often drop in the days leading up to a game. While every once in a while the same occurs with suites, in general, pricing does not drop before the game. In fact, because of the very limited availability of luxury suites, it is advised to book a suite well in advance, as suites are often not available at the last minute. In addition, in coordinating events for larger groups (suites can hold up to 20 guests or more), it is often necessary to give guests a longer lead time to confirm their availability to attend.\n\nAre there additional expenses I should consider?\n\nIf you are hosting guests in your suite, consider allocating enough budget to order catering for your suite. Catering is typically not included in the price of the suite. Suite Experience Group clients typically spend between $1,000-$2,000 for catering, with some clients spending even more if they order significant amounts of alcohol.\n\nAre there discounts if I buy multiple games at once?\n\nSome clients purchase multiple suites in multiple venues at one time. Suite Experience Group can provide special package pricing for clients who buy three or more suites at one time.\n\nHow can I maximize my budget?\n\nIf you are working within a budget and trying to maximize your spend, we would welcome an opportunity to further discuss your goals for the event and the different options available to you. Please call us at 800-592-7043 or fill out this form to get started. We look forward to the opportunity to help you explore your options in renting a luxury suite."
