        "text": "Last visit: June 16, 2024\n\nThe very first game that I went to as a 5-year-old kid was a Montreal Expos game at old Jarry Park. This connected me to the team early. As such, some of my all-time favorite players played in the great city of Montreal: Ellis Valentine, Rusty Staub, Gary Carter, Andre Dawson, and Warren Cromartie. When they moved to DC, I disavowed the franchise even though I knew they were there because of the mis-dealings of Jeffrey Loria and not due to some nefarious doings of the Washington ownership. They became “just another team”.\n\nHaving also seen old Expos games in Olympic Stadium and having caught the Washington Nationals at RFK and eventually their new digs, this is the only franchise for whom I’ve seen a home game in four stadiums over the course of my life. And of those 4, their current home is by far the best. In fairness, that’s not saying much; the others were either temporary or (in the case of The Big O) lousy.\n\nNationals Park suffers a little from raised expectations met by a solid, if unspectacular, delivery. After seeing a slew of amazing parks go up before it, hope was the national pastime would get a cathedral to behold in the nation’s capital. Nationals Park is perfectly nice, but the hope was for amazing.\n\nSTADIUM 33/50\n\nExterior aesthetics 8/10; Interior & Concourse Aesthetics 9/10; Sightlines 4/5; Seating 4/5; Traffic Flow 5/5; Scoreboards 6/10; Amenities & entertainment 4/5; Bars and Restaurants 3/5; Celebrating history 4/5; Grand entrance 3/5; Sense of place 13/30; WOW Factor 3/10. Total 66 points divided by 2 for 33.\n\nInstead of doing another red brick retro park, the Nationals went with something more reminiscent of The National Mall. Hence a lot of translucent glass, steel and concrete. Critics call it boring and reminiscent of a suburban office park. Fans call it understated, innovative vis-à-vis the faux red brick buildings, and fitting of its surroundings. I’m somewhere in between.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nSightlines are generally good with the seats angling toward then infield\n\nConcourses are wide, with the field in view from the lower deck in all spots but the area immediately behind Homeplate\n\nThere are some nice murals celebrating the history of Washington Senators baseball\n\nThe centerfield gate where most arrive, while somewhat plainer than other “Grand Entrances”, opens from the street and just sort of invites you to come inside. The underused home plate interest on the other side of the park is the real “front door” and greets you with three statues of Washington greats (Walter Johnson, Frank Howard, Josh Gibson).\n\nThere are a few social areas in which to congregate and have drink with a view of the game\n\nIf you’re lucky enough to get into one, the premium seating lounges are among the best in baseball\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nThere isn’t really a defining feature inside that makes the park uniquely Washington. The closest is the bluestone backstop, but that’s more for the TV audience than the ones in the park. The cherry blossom trees out in left field come closest, but those are really only around for a week or so at the start of the season. You used to be able to get a view of The Capitol from the left field upper deck, but construction in the area has blocked that. You can get a view of the Washington Monument from right field, but that’s only from a handful of seats, so it can hardly define the ballpark.\n\nDespite the significant development in the neighborhood, the two most dominant structures viewed in the outfield are still parking garages\n\nThe upper deck feels higher than in other parks. There’s virtually no overhang in the lower areas, which pushes the upper deck further away\n\nThere’s virtually no mention of the team’s Expos origins, relegating the team of my youth to the scrap bin\n\nOverall, it’s a perfectly functional, fan-friendly stadium. But despite many repeat visits, I still don’t know what distinguishes Nationals Park from other ballparks from a physical structure standpoint.\n\nFOOD 9/10\n\nHere’s where the park really shines.\n\nFor local fare, the Chesapeake Crab Cake Company offers crabby delights. There’s an arepas stand AND a pupusas stand. Best burger is a shoot out between Shake Shack and Swizzler. Rocklands BBQ serves up smoked yummies and Hard Times Cafe offers all things chili.\n\nThere’s a gourmet “haut dog” stand (also offering Bahn Mi), a really good Italian sausage and Korean hot dogs from Ssongs. Roaming Rooster (great Nashville hot sandwiches), Shake Shack, and Box Frites line a fine restaurant row in the rightfield club level. And if you love crepes as much as I do, the Eli Crêpes stand offers these delights in both savory and sweet varieties.\n\nMy personal fave: While the savory crêpe almost took over the top slot, Ben’s Chili Bowl’s Half Smoke “all the way” still wins. It’s arguably the messiest yet tastiest encased meat treat at any yard.\n\nBEER 7/10\n\nThe Nationals were one of the first parks to truly embrace the craft and local beer craze when it opened in 2008.\n\nDevil’s Backbone (now owned by AB) has its own outpost out in leftfield. You can also find offers from Dogfish Head, Other Half, Atlas Brewing, and some really nice stuff from DC Brau. There are also national “craft” options from Golden Road and Sierra Nevada, plus a decent selection of imports in addition to the macro domestics. The Club Level adds a few more local taps from Right Proper and 3 Stars.\n\nFor those who prefer mixed drinks, there seem to be quite a few full service bars throughout.\n\nNEIGHBORHOOD 8/10\n\nWhen the park first opened in 2008, this score would have likely been a 2. They put this park in a neglected part of town that used to house strip clubs, liquor stores and an asphalt factory. Civic leaders hoped that the ballpark would serve as an anchor for future development. At the same time, efforts doubled to clean the polluted Anacostia river.\n\nFast forward to today, and the area now has 20 bars or restaurants nearby. Hotels and office buildings are going up at a feverish pace. The nearby waterfront area has been booming, and the river is looking healthier and healthier. You’re no longer pre-gaming in a shipping container (though that’s still an option). It absolutely served its purpose as a catalyst in revitalizing the area.\n\nYou can watch the game from a rooftop bar in the Hampton Inn across the street. You can get good meals without changing neighborhoods. It’s unbelievable how much has changed in just over a decade. And it just continues to get better.\n\nThe only downside to all this development is that certain killers views are now obstructed by new buildings. From certain seats you used to have a glimpse of the Capitol Building or the Washington Monument. No more.\n\nCOST 2/5\n\nThe price of attending a Nationals games is very high according to the Fan Cost Index. Parking can be the real killer. If possible, take the Metro to help manage the costs. And I find that using the secondary market can really help save some money for all but the truly marquee games.\n\nACCESSIBILITY 3/5\n\nThe Green Line Metro stops a block from the centerfield entrance and is the preferred way to get here. Driving is do-able but expensive.\n\nNote that the Green Line is the only line that services Nationals Park unless you’re willing to hoof it 20-25 minutes. This can mean crowded cars, especially after the game. WMATA does not run extra trains on game nights, so there’s a premium on getting on the first train out post-game. Also note that service stops earlier than in most cities, so beware of night games that go into extra innings. But even with all that said, the low cost and freedom of not having a car to drive offset any reservations about the Metro.\n\nWEATHER 2/5\n\nWashington summers are really humid. Washington springs seem to be really wet. I’ve been weathered or delayed more here than any other park. Hopefully you’re doing a multiday trip in DC and have some schedule flexibility.\n\nThat said, it may be worth taking the risk to try to see a game here very early in the season. If your timing is right, you may also be in town as the cherry trees blossom. At the risk of sounding like a 65-year-old woman, the blossoms are magnificent. There are a few trees around the park that add an unworldly beauty to the place during the brief blossom period. Even though late March and early April games are often chillier or wetter than in other times a year, it’s just so gorgeous. Because a sunny day when the blossoms are out is a “good to be alive” day.\n\nVIBE 16/25\n\nThe Nats have been competitive most years since their move and have made the playoffs many times. Up until 2019, like their hockey playing counterparts (The Capitals), they tended to blow their successful regular seasons by losing early in the playoffs, sometimes in excruciating fashion. As such, despite their win-loss record, the team was widely considered to be a bit of a disappointment. This may explain why attendance was always mediocre despite the newness of the team and its competitiveness. They never really got to bask in a post-World Series glow as COVID, followed by a sell-off of talent, stole that shine.\n\nWashington is a transplant town. Often times visiting fans can rival the home town team. But National fans tend to be fairly polite, so the interplay between fan bases seldom escalates. In all, it’s a friendly atmosphere, but not an intense one.\n\nThe crowd aside, the Game Day experience is pretty strong. The Racing Presidents rival Milwaukee’s Racing Sausages as the best mascot race; fans genuinely get excited for this relatively new tradition. I also like the foghorn that blows after a home run, an homage to the park’s Navy Yard location. And the practice of offering day-of-game only $5 Grandstand seats to DC residents (one per person, must enter ballpark immediately) is a pretty cool throwback scheme.\n\nGALLERY\n\nOTHER THINGS TO DO\n\nThree fun DC restaurants:\n\nDuke’s Grocery (4 locations including Navy Yard. Great bar food including its renown Proper Burger.)\n\n2 Amy’s (Cathedral Heights. Wood-burning Neapolitan pizzas.)\n\nBonchon (Navy Yard. Even with all the new competition in the area, it’s hard to beat their yummy Korean fried chicken wings)\n\nThree places to imbibe before the game:\n\nWalter’s/Mission/The Bullpen (Ballpark. Three places in the shadow of the stadium. Walter’s is an upscale sports bar with lots of TVs and taps. Mission, right next door, is a 12,000 square foot space featuring Tex-Mex eats. And The Bullpen is the original Nats Park pre-game spot made up of a bunch of shipping containers and, often, live music. )\n\nDacha Beer Garden (Navy Yard. Nice indoor/outdoor beer garden close to the river.)\n\nThe Brig (Eastern Market. German beer hall on the south end of a fun stretch of 8th St. SE about a 20-minute walk to the park.)\n\nOne bar in the area worth hitting:\n\nChurchKey (Logan Circle. Among the best beer bars in the country with many taps pouring fine elixirs and an even bigger bottle list)\n\nThree craft breweries in the area worthy of your time:\n\nAslin Brewing (Logan Circle. Underrated Virginia-based brewery with excellent hazy IPAs)\n\nBluejacket/Solace Brewing/Atlas Brew Works (Navy Yards. Three options for a brewpub and eatery with a very short walk of the ballpark. Bluejacket is the original, just east of the ballpark and used to be the only real sit-down option before the area exploded. Solace Brewing is a large space just south of the park with some lovely beer and comfort food. And my favorite of the three, Atlas, is the closest brewery to the ballpark and offers great suds as well as artisanal pizza.)\n\nRight Proper Brewing (Shaw. Some good funky brews that you can pair with good southern food.)\n\nThree fun tourist attractions in the area:\n\nSmithsonian Museums (sort of a cheat because there are many. My favorite is American History)\n\nMall Memorials (Lincoln, WW2, Jefferson, FDR, MLK, Washington, Korean War, Vietnam War)\n\nInternational Spy Museum (costs admission, but an excellent museum)\n\nSUMMARY\n\nNationals Park is a nice park that is aging well as the neighborhood around it continues to grow. You’ll find it be as fan-friendly as any and you’ll eat & drink well. Its central location close to the Navy Yard Metro stop invites you to add it to a DC visit. But other than forgoing red brick, it offers relatively little distinction and suffers a little in my ratings as a result. Rule of thumb: if you need the mascots to really deliver the sense of place, then perhaps you went a little too minimalist."
