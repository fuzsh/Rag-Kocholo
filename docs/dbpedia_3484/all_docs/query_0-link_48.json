        "text": "Translator’s Introduction\n\nClaudia Masin’s poems are often love poems. By this I mean that they’re concerned with damage: with how every person, every body on earth, undergoes experiences of profound emotional and often physical pain — and then how that person, that body, goes on living, desiring, and experiencing what love it can. Her work is interested in healing, and in what can’t be healed; in how loss both forces and invites us to be transformed; in love as an improbable, unparalleled gift of recognition between human beings.\n\nThe poems published here are excerpted from her collection Lo intacto (Hilos Editora, 2018), which I’ve translated as Intact. Claudia wrote the entire book (as well as the two collections that preceded and followed it, respectively) in response to different films, and their titles reference those “original” works. That said, the poems are meant to stand alone; they can be read without any familiarity with the films behind them.\n\nWhen I first started reading Claudia’s poems, I felt an immediate urge to translate them. Thematically, I was drawn to her sinuous to-and-fro between inner life and the natural world, and to her sensitive, often wrenching explorations of emotional landscapes. Before any of that, though, I was most viscerally struck by her use of the line: long, graceful, sweeping, controlled. A continual unspooling. A ribbon streaming down a flight of stairs.\n\nClaudia was born in Resistencia, in the province of Chaco, Argentina, in 1972. She moved to Buenos Aires as a teenager and trained as a psychoanalyst, a profession she practiced until not long ago. She now lives in the city of Córdoba. Last year, she published her twelfth book of poetry, El cuerpo, the last in her trilogy of film-centered collections. We’ve never met in person, but we have a sporadic correspondence I treasure, and her poems — probing, empathic, unwilling to look away from hurt where hurt is felt, fixing the world with an ardent attention that is in itself a form of love — give me a sense of solace and accompaniment whenever I return to them.\n\n—Robin Myers\n\nThe Silent Touch\n\nIt’s not the soul. It’s not an immaterial being, a gust\n\nthat fills the body: the mystery is the body in itself,\n\nits complex myriad of veins,\n\nthe blood that rushes forth to feed the organs,\n\nhidden like prehistoric animals in caverns so secluded\n\nthat only illnesses can find them there.\n\nContact with others is what heals,\n\nwhat sickens, the sun\n\nencircled by the lonely planet\n\nof ourselves, caught in the orbit\n\nof the light or shadow as they draw\n\ntheir heat toward us or away, as if we were\n\nthe dust kicked up by some other existence, the wake\n\nchurned at the source, the indissoluble bond we were supposed\n\nto renounce\n\nbut which awoke again each time we loved\n\nanother body. You hoped I’d write the words\n\nthat can do what music does:\n\nstep through the silence without harming it, be\n\npart of it, and of the things that can’t be said,\n\nthe things we can’t even approach without\n\nthem darting away from us. I told you there’s nothing\n\nlike music but touch\n\nand being touched, the particles\n\nthat meet and fuse and sometimes scrape against each other and\n\ncause pain, and pull away, and sometimes one explodes\n\ninside the other, because there’s neither surface\n\nnor interior: the inside is the same as out. Inside,\n\nthe love we share or cruelty we inflict plunge down into a well\n\nand can’t climb out again. We were gifted this fall\n\nso that we would collide, one dashed against another,\n\nso that we’d have\n\nto mark each other.\n\nAnd once we’ve got our mark, we’ll never be alone; we couldn’t\n\nbe unbroken even if we wanted to.\n\nEstuaries\n\nOnce, humans hunted the animals of the estuaries\n\nin the siesta’s radiant calm.\n\nThe steel of the sun and the weapons sank\n\ninto still water. Now\n\npeople let them live: a kind concession, a gift\n\nthe mighty grant their servants. The alligators\n\ncan emerge, like us,\n\nand sprawl for hours in the heat, tired\n\nold lizards placidly abiding\n\nthe birds who settle on their hides to rest before\n\nthey fly away. The piranhas,\n\nlike all good furtive, implacable creatures,\n\nthrong close around the shoals and patiently await\n\ntheir prey. The lives of foxes and roe deer\n\nare spared; it’s now forbidden\n\nto delight in their terror, their desperate,\n\ndoomed attempt to blend into the brush. You and I\n\nwere wild once, but we weren’t so lucky:\n\nonly when no one else was watching\n\ncould we roam free without an ambush, without some sudden\n\nteeth wrenching the joy\n\nout of our flesh. But we weren’t scared.\n\nWe snatched the sustenance we’d been refused,\n\nand we ran riot,\n\nfleeing the time that gained on us,\n\nthe time when we’d be sundered by the law\n\ndeclaring that the only possible passions between two boys —\n\nor men —\n\nare cruelty, rage, and violence. So how did we escape,\n\nhow did the hunter overlook us,\n\nhow did a love survive inside our chests,\n\ndeadeye as the stone that could\n\nhave felled us with a single throw?\n\nI don’t know how we stay\n\nalive, those of us\n\nwho were never fated to exist. Maybe it’s\n\nthe strength sparked when we join together,\n\nthe boundless force that means we cease to be\n\na pair of solitary beasts, each one the only sample of its kind, born ready\n\nfor extinction.\n\nOrigins\n\nIn the limbo between life and death,\n\nsay certain holy books, comes liberation:\n\nat last, you understand. Is understanding freedom, then?\n\nUnderstanding as stones do, stripped of souls,\n\nlight in their roughness, delivered\n\ninto the passion that the elements\n\nunleash upon them: the hail’s assault,\n\nthe wind’s sensual brush, the savagery\n\nof the sun, which sears and turns them\n\ninto smoldering embers\n\nuntil the rain blows in and licks them clean\n\nas the lioness bathes her cubs\n\nwhen they’re born. At last, you understand (so say the books)\n\nthat death doesn’t exist, or at least\n\ndeath as point\n\nof no return. You always return.\n\nWould I recognize you if you came back\n\nas the little girl selling flowers\n\non the streets of Mumbai, or as the agile, grim-faced buck\n\nthe hunter tracks at dawn,\n\nor the monk who tends his garden\n\nin the mountains where nobody\n\ncan see it, or the guerrilla fighter with a shield\n\nof explosives strapped to himself in a busy market, or the tree\n\ncontorting at the cliff’s edge,\n\nlengthening its limbs in search of a little sun,\n\ndeformed by the strain, by the lust\n\nfor staying alive? I just don’t know\n\nif I’d be able to recognize you\n\nwithout the face, the matter\n\nso familiar to my eyes and hands. But I do know\n\nthat as soon as I found you,\n\nthe fragile ice would crack\n\nbeneath my feet again, and the fierce blow\n\nof frozen water would jolt me awake, as the body awakes\n\nonce it’s dead and then absorbs\n\nthe electric lurch that shocks it back to life.\n\n4:44\n\nSometimes life, unmediated\n\nby death, just ends. Sure, it starts over again,\n\nbut it’s not the same: it’s like you’ve sunk\n\nan axe into a tree trunk. That’s\n\nwhere everything fragile about it\n\nwill gather from now on. A single blow\n\nin that soft place will be enough to fell it. I’d keep watch\n\nday and night so that force wouldn’t catch you\n\nby surprise and do you harm. You’d tell me, I’m not a tree,\n\nI don’t have roots, that means I can survive\n\nany disaster: it’s firm and solid bodies\n\nthat risk being broken.\n\nI’m more like\n\na vine that grows in midair. And yet I know, we know,\n\nthat perfect storms exist, and those\n\nspare no one. It doesn’t matter: that’s your faith,\n\nand the faith of those who don’t realize they believe\n\nis the strongest kind of all, the only one\n\nthat can work miracles. What else would you call the fact\n\nthat an unloved body\n\nkeeps breathing, if everything we have depends on others,\n\non their capacity to hold us up, to give us breath?\n\nWhat else, if not the most ferocious will to live,\n\nwould keep a person on their feet\n\nwho’d been offered only indifference from the start,\n\nor sheer violence, uncontrollable and deadly? It’s the world’s\n\nlast morning before it shatters, and even now\n\nwe’re all caught up in little things—that our house,\n\nfor example, seems like a house. No matter what you say,\n\nhope keeps laboring on the body, even\n\nwhen the body gave up long ago and stopped\n\nits wanting. There is an impulse greater\n\nthan itself, than you and I, than everything\n\nthat will be lost. It’s kindled by a fire\n\nthat has no origin, no flinting spark, no future, desperate\n\nto incarnate any matter that will let it\n\nkeep on burning. An inextinguishable\n\nember that becomes a lesion\n\non the body. The grace and passion that belonged to us\n\nwill smolder in that wound\n\nafter the body is snuffed out: the will-\n\no’-the-wisp.\n\nNazareno Cruz and the Wolf\n\nOnce, seated around a fire, we told each other\n\nthe stories we loved. The ones we’ve repeated\n\nso many times we’ve come\n\nto believe them. They’re neither true nor false, and in the end\n\nit wouldn’t matter: who isn’t made of made-up\n\nstories. Without them, our bodies would blur\n\ninto erasure, light and flimsy\n\nas ash disintegrating in the air. Unlike trees\n\nor animals, we humans have to gather\n\nto be real. When we’re together, we look\n\nlike more than shadows, we look true, we look like we could last\n\nmuch longer than the fleeting lapse we really do. How\n\ncan such fragile, needy beings cause\n\nsuch harm? I’ve often been\n\nthe wolf who plucks its prey’s heart out and carries it away,\n\nclenched in its jaws; I’ve roused intolerable pain\n\nwhere there was only calm,\n\nand not even the flayed animal’s howl could halt\n\nthe hunting rage in me, the sprinting,\n\nreveled blood, kindled by someone\n\nelse’s hurt. And what became\n\nof what I loved? My teeth\n\nentrapped it, too. Because\n\nhow can a lover ever keep brutality at bay,\n\nhow can the beloved ever elude violence,\n\nif violence is a bolt that roams the world\n\nand searches for a target, for the magnet that will lure it close,\n\noblivious to the fire\n\nand hardship it’s inviting in? If only the wolf\n\nof us could ever be sated, if thirst\n\nhad an end, or a beginning, if we could join\n\nthe pack, recover from the craze, the boundless\n\nappetite, the torment of our claws and fangs,\n\nif there were any hope, any at all, that we could stop\n\ndamaging others and ourselves, I’d leave it at your feet,\n\nso that you could do with it — my hope —\n\nwhatever you wanted: take it into your hands,\n\ntoss it aside, let it grow tall\n\nor wilt away. The curse of someone who can’t love\n\nis being alone, and someone who’s alone can only act\n\nlike wolves: attacking and destroying what she can,\n\nfearing destruction and attacks. And who\n\ncan love, who’s not alone, if we’ve been raised\n\nas predators, if all we know is how to claim\n\nour territory? There has to be a way. We have to tell\n\na story that can save us. The promise,\n\nwhen disaster strikes, that someone\n\nwill always come to rescue us, won’t let\n\nus lap the venom from the wound, the poisoned blood that spoils\n\nwith hate and spurs revenge. There has to be\n\na cure. So we won’t gash each other’s flesh\n\nout of clumsiness or negligence each time\n\nwe try to touch again, hoping to give each other\n\nsomething different than\n\nwhat we’ve received, something\n\nthat can’t destroy or be destroyed.\n\nWouldn’t it be beautiful\n\nif we could let go\n\nof these mangled bodies\n\nthat see others and the world as rivals\n\nin an arduous, interminable trial — to have\n\na chest that breathes, a mouth that swallows. In other words,\n\nto survive for no one, for nothing.\n\nCherry Blossoms\n\nIn the blue night\n\nfrost haze, the sky glows\n\nwith the moon\n\npine tree tops\n\nbend snow-blue, fade\n\ninto sky, frost, starlight.\n\nThe creak of boots.\n\nRabbit tracks, deer tracks,\n\nwhat do we know.\n\nGary Snyder\n\nI wake and think: it’s like a tree could\n\nwake up in the middle of the night. What do we know?\n\nLocked in our bodies, isolated\n\nfrom the wondrous things that happen,\n\nunfit to see or feel or even really trust\n\nthat they exist at all. What do we know? Maybe the plants rest\n\ntoo, maybe they have their days or nights of wakefulness, a certain kind\n\nof grief or anguish we will never fully understand,\n\nsome touch — the sun, the rain, the wind? — that soothes them.\n\nBut let’s imagine what an ache must mean to substance\n\nthat can’t move. Material condemned\n\nto stay right where it is, that has no way\n\nto run or hide. What if the lightning bolt,\n\nthe axe, the avalanche, the flood, were not\n\nthe only risks to plague it? Let’s look\n\nout at the cherry tree, lovely and unparticipating in\n\nthe final night of winter. Beyond\n\nthe parasitic plants and pests that stifle it, what if\n\nthere were some powerful desire that crept along the root\n\nand climbed the battered trunk,\n\nemerging from the leaves and branches, howling\n\ninto a silence still impossible to break? What if there were\n\nsomething that wanted out, that longed to burst into the world,\n\nout there, but doesn’t move, stays still and quiet, trapped inside?\n\nHaven’t you ever felt like that, immobilized, frozen in place,\n\nutterly shattered by another body crushing yours\n\nbefore it vanishes?\n\nI bear the scars,\n\nthe marks of your existence. They will fade.\n\nYour voice, your way of uttering even the simplest word\n\nas if it were a song that leaves a wake of beauty once\n\nit’s gone, a trail unreachable, is nowhere\n\nnow; it lasts only as long\n\nas words do. I’m going to live my life\n\ninside the very air your voice echoed into and left that wake.\n\nI’m going to live my life just like the tree\n\nthat offers you its blossoms once a year, the sole\n\ndisplay of its devotion and its anguish at the world\n\nbeyond, at what it lost and can’t\n\nrecover. Whatever beauty I can manage,\n\nhowever small and poor, however little it resembles\n\nthe white and perfect flowering of the cherry tree, will be for you.\n\nI’ll always be what I am now: a branch that works\n\nto bring a bud to blossom, even if it’s only one,\n\nto give you one last glimpse of it\n\nbefore the winter comes, before\n\nit’s dried of sap and strength. That\n\nwill be my life: the ardor of\n\nthe effort. I know you’ll never see\n\nwhat I can offer you. But here\n\nI’ll stay, until, relenting, I turn into you at last,\n\nuntil my body brings you back, until my body is\n\nexactly like your own: the mud, the parted trunk, the stripped\n\ndry branch, the petals spent and scattered."
