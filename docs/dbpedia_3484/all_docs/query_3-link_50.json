        "text": "One of my favorite cues to help create in any show is the preset. It’s what the audience sees and hears and experiences when they enter the theatre. A large birdcage sits centerstage, eerily lit in a single shaft of silver light so that it throws a long shadow downstage reminiscent of a jail cell. You can see why the preset is such a satisfying cue to build, because it’s a little show within itself. And it has an important function which is to intrigue the entering audience, to provoke, to create wonder and anticipation, to engage the audience even before the show starts. The preset foreshadows the possibilities of the show you’re about to see.\n\nWhenever I go to the theatre I always pay special attention to the preset. It’s my first clue about what the artists have created for me. I sometimes remember a show for years because of the impression the preset makes on me. I saw the touring production of Ragtime many years ago and I still remember that huge wooden carving of opera glasses, like a giant hand-carved toy that hung over the stage in the preset, only to fly away as the show started, never to be seen again. The Geffen’s excellent production of A Christmas Carol, a few years ago, had the provocative preset of a coffin partially shrouded in elegant black bunting and fog; a perfect portent of things to come.\n\nRegardless of your politics, we all had a front row seat this week to the preset of the biggest show on Earth. Yes, this week’s preset was even more inspiring than Hamilton’s, which featured its beautifully lit set as it's preset. The stage is set for a new show at the beginning of 2021. That it’s a new year alone offers a natural opportunity to rewrite the story.\n\nLike Hamilton, this week’s preset consisted of stairs and balconies and even ropes. But in Hamilton we had not yet seen those stairs and balconies used, whereas this week’s preset featured stairs and balconies that we saw performed upon in real life scenes of war just two weeks ago. Unfortunately, unlike in stage combat, the blood we saw here was real. The memory of that recent tragic show at the Capitol made the freshly dressed set of the majestic westerly face all the more meaningful in this preset. The hate had been painted over by the stagehands of democracy for opening night.\n\nSometimes presets feature actors onstage before the show. We saw that this week and the casting was beautifully diverse. The imagery and language of love also stood out in this week’s preset. We saw it with presidents of both parties coming together to remind us all of how we can be, if we can just avert our gaze from social media. We saw it in performers of all races, genders, audience bases, and political persuasions. We heard the words of love and hope from the wise old soul of a 22-year old Angelino. We felt the explosive power of hope in the meticulously choreographed fireworks upstage of the reflecting pool. We saw it in the snow, and then in the parting of the clouds. We felt it in the vaguely familiar feelings of normalcy.\n\nThese elements set the stage this week for the production of the year. Of the next few years, perhaps. And they signaled many joyous possibilities for this new show. They made me hope again. And wonder. These feelings made me want to see the show. Desperate to see it, even. I was one of the last people I know to see Hamilton, but this is a show I’d camp out in line for days to get tickets to. This is the show of the century. It is only just beginning. And it’s gonna be a long sit. Yes, even longer than Angels in America. Because stories this large take a while to develop. And because angels in America have been hard to find lately. I wonder who the angels of this new show will be? And who will play the antagonist? Will it be another tragedy or a much-needed comedy?\n\nThe house lights are starting to dim. The show is beginning. I hope it’s a good as the preset."
