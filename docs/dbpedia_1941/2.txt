THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF HISTORICAL STUDIES Vol. XI (1971-72) No. 1 EDITORIAL Our New Address: • The Institute and the Quarterly Review Office was shifted in September 1971 to our Aew premises, at 35, Theatre Road (Shakes- peare Sarani) Catcutta-17. This was necessi- tated by lack of accommodation in our old premises, which was increasingly felt during the last two years. Perhaps, this is inevitable for any growing institution which needs more accommodation after every couple of years. Fortunately, in our new premises, situated in one of the quietest localities of Calcutta, we 'have sufficient accommodation to meet our requirements for a very long time to come. In the new premises we shall be in a better position to hold regular meetings and semi- nars and also to build up a good reference library. The big lounge, the spacious reading oom and the beautiful adjoining garden ill, it is hoped, make the members feel as omfortable as one could wish for in an institution of this kind. I The Eleventh Year: With the present number the Quarterly Review of Historical Studies steps into its Seventh year of publication. It is particularly |ratifying, when we consider the numer6us Acuities, both financial and otherwise, which the journal had to face during the first decade of its publication. Every endeavour is made to retain the academic standard of the journal which has earned appreciation in scholarly circles. We have also been success- ful in maintaining regularity of publication as far as possible. This is no small credit when one considers the difficulties of journals of this kind resulting in long arrear of publica- tion in many cases. To commemorate the completion of the first decade of publication, it is proposed to bring out a special index volume covering the contents of Volumes I to X. To meet the increased cost of paper, printing and postage, the Indian subscription rate has been increa- sed from Rs. 15/- to Rs. 20/- from the cur- rent year, 197172. This slight increase in the subscription rate has been forced on us to cover the annual deficit on journal account Annual General Meeting: The 10th Annual General Meeting of the Institute of Historical Studies was held at the Institute’s new premises on 12th Septem- ber, 1971. Dr. R. C. Majumdar presided. The Director presented the Annual Report for 1970-71, outlining the progress made during 4 the year under review. The Annual Report brought out one unfortunate trend, a decline in membership. The Director made a special appeal to the members to exert themselves personally to enrol at least 100 new members during 1971-72. One happy thing about the composition of the membership is its truly all-India character. There is no State or Union Territory in India from where we do not have at least a few members. The progress outlined in the Annual Report certainly does credit to any young organisation, just 10 years old. But the state of the finances, as pointed out by the Director, is something that should cause grave anxiety. On the General Account side the accumulated deficit has amounted to nearly Rs. 23, 0007- in ten years. From the Audit Report of 1970- 71 and the Budget Estimates for 1971-72, it is clear that, with the existing financial re- sources the Institute needs a minimum finan- cial assistance of Rs. 15,000/- annually to balance its General Account Budget. This is only to maintain its present range of acti- vities and not for any expansion or develop- ment. It has to be admitted that no academic institution can carry on merely on member- ship fees, journal subscriptions and publica- tion sales. If the private institutions are to function properly, they must be given some financial assistance by the State. Unfortunately in India there is a tendency in official circles to think that Government funds are meant only for Government- sponsored and Government-managed institu- tions and projects. It is only if there is any- thing left over that financial assistance to private academic institutions could be consi- dered. That is why when lakhs and lakhs are spent on Government institutions and pro- jects, the Ministry of Education has allocated only a small pittance of Rs. 80.000/- for grants-in-aid to all the deserving non-Govern- mental institutions and projects in the whole country. It is difficult to make the officials understand that Government funds are meant as much for non-Governmental as for Go vernmental institutions, and that experience shows that better results at cheaper cost may be obtained through private institutions than through Governmental agencies. The financial position of the Institute in * the General Account side was gravely affec- ted by the termination of the Foundation Grant of Rs. 10,000/- a year. The Union Ministry of Education has been giving a grant of Rs. 5,000/- only from 1970-71. An 1 ' appeal has been made to the Ministry to in- crease the grant to Rs. 10,000/- from the current financial year. If this is done, it may be just possible for the Institute to balance its budget from 1971-72 with some additional financial assistance from the State Govern- ment. ( To wipe off the accumulated deficit for the j last 10 years, it has been decided to raise donations from members, industrialists and the general public. For this purpose the Insti- tute has been declared as a public charitable institution by the Income-tax authorities under sections 1 1 and 80-G of the Income-tax Act, 1961, under which all donations made to the Institute would be exempt from pay- ment of Income-tax. The declaration will no doubt facilitate securing donations, but much depends on the kind help and active co-opera- tion of our members in the donation-drive. Seminar: On the occasion of the 10th Annual General Meeting a two-day Seminar waW* organised on 12th and 13th September on The Modernisation of Bengal in the Second Half of the 19th Century. The object was tc». go into the causes, the process and the extent, of modernisation of Bengal in the second Half of the 19th century either distinct from, or as a continuation of, the trends in the first half of the century. .The following papers were presented and discussed. 5 1. Calcutta, the Primate City : A Study in Urbanisation — by Mr. Chittabrata Palit (Jadavpuc University) 2. The Impact of Railways : A Study in Rural-Urban Relationship — by Dr. Hena Mukherjee (Institute of Education) 3. Industrialisation and Social Change — by Dr. Sunil Sen (Rabindra Bha- rati University) 4. The Transformation of Caste : — by Dr. Amitabha Mukherjee (Jadavpur University) 5. The Indigenous Versus Western Medi- cal Science : A Search for Progress — by Dr N. N. Qanungo (Visva- Bharati University) Dr. R. C. Majumdar presided. The papers were of a high standard and the discussions most lively. The papers will, in due course, be published in a separate Volume. New Fellows: The following new Fellows were elected in 1971 by the College of Fellows under Article V of the Constitution. The names were announced at the 10th Annual General Meeting. 1. Dr. S. N. Prasad, Director, National Archives of India, New Delhi. 2. Dr. R. Narasimha Rao, Professor & Head of the Department of History, Osmania University, Hyderabad. 3. Dr. V. M. Reddi, Professor & Head of the Department of History, S. V. University, Tirupati, (A. P.) 4. Dr. O. Ramachandraiya, Professor & Head of the Department of History, Andhra University, Waltair (A.P.) 5. Dr. N. K. Sahu, Professor & Head of the Department of History, Sambalpur University, Sambalpur, Orissa. 6. Professor T. V. Mahalingam, Head of the Department of Ancient Indian History, University of Madras. 7. Professor T. Raychoudhury, Head of the Department of History, University of Delhi. Annual Conference: The Ninth Annual Conference of the Institute was held at Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh) from 5th to 8th October, 1971, under the auspices of Shri Venkateswara University, Tirupati. Dr. R. C. Majumdar presided. The Conference was inaugurated by Shri B. D. Jatti, Lt. Governor of Pondi- cherry, who spoke about the role of historians in the present Indian context. The Vice- Chancellor of S. V. University, Tirupati, welcoming the delegates referred to the his- torical importance of Tirupati from ancient times. The Director spoke briefly about the Institute and about the two themes chosen for the Conference. In his Presidential Address Dr. R. C. Majumdar gave an outline of the state of historical studies in India and analysed the causes of the marked decline in the standard of historical research in the country. One of 6 the main causes, he pointed out, was official interference in shaping the scope and trends of historical research. Such interference was often motivated by political considerations damaging to any objective study of history. The Government may have its own policies in the domestic and foreign spheres. But however laudable these policies might be in the present context and for the purpose of shaping the future course of events, there is no reason why it should try to distort the past to fit in with its present policies and future hopes. Another important factor, as Dr. Majumdar pointed out, was the undue em- phasis placed by the Government on public sector projects in historical research and the consequent neglect of private institutions and projects doing much better work and at a much lesser cost to the nation. He illustrated the point by citing several cases where the Government had generously opened its purse- strings for the implementation of Govern- ment sponsored projects and institutions with little tangible results to the nation. On the other hand, the Government showed a step- motherly attitude towards private institutions and projects which were working quietly and with greater devotion and showing much better results in the field of historical research. The two themes chosen for the Ninth Annual Conference were : 1. The North and the South in Indian History : Contact and Adjustment. 2. The Sources of the History of Andhra Pradesh. On the first theme 17 papers were presen- ted and discussed and on the second 7. There was also to be a symposium on the Histo~ r'tans' Bias , but only one paper was read as the other two speakers were absent. The Conference was attended by more than 150 delegates representing different Universities and institutions. It was a truly all- India gathering with scholars from Naga- land to Rajasthan and Kashmir to Kerala. The attendance at the paper reading sessions was very good and the discussions were most lively. On the whole the Conference was a great success, in keeping with the past tradition. We take this opportunity to offer our sincere thanks to the Vice-Chancellor and the authorities of the S. V. University for their kind hospitality. We are particularly thank- ful to the Local Secretary, Professor V. M. Reddy and his helpful colleagues in the De- partment of History who made the local arrangements with meticulous care. Our thanks are also due to the band of student volunteers who looked after the delegates and made their stay as comfortable as one could wish for.

DNB: We are happy to announce that Vol. I of the Dictionary of National Biography has already been sent to the press. The printing work has been entrusted to the Saraswati Press, Calcutta, one of the best in India, and every care will be taken to ensure the quality of production one would expect for a publi- cation of this kind by the best international standard. Vol. I will cover all names from 'A’ to 'D’, about 350 in number. It is expec- ted to be out by February 1972. The other three volumes are also being made ready for the press. Vol. II will cover all names from 'F to ’L’; Vol. Ill from 'M* to ’R’; and Vol. IV from 'S’ to 'Z\ Each volume will be of approximately 600-650 pages. For unavoidable reasons the announcement for pre-publication order could not be made in October as originally planned. It will ? how- ever, be made in December and circulars will be sent to all our members and subscribers. The announcement will also be made in all the leading newspapers in the country. The financial position of the DNB Project is still not very reassuring. We still need to fill up a gap of more than a lakh. A part of this we are hoping to get from the Union and State Governments and a part from dona- tions from industrialists and the generous public. In this connection we appeal to our members, subscribers ard the public at large for donations. Any donations, big or small, will be thankfully received and acknowledg- ed. We may state here that by a recent decla- ration the Income-tax authorities have exemp- ted all donations to the Institute from payment of Income-tax.

Conceptualization of War There are numerous works on the art and science of war in western countries. Some useful works have been written on the art of war in ancient India. But what exist re- garding medieval India do not deal with the art of war as such though these throw consi- derable light on military administration and conduct of battles.’ The period covered here is about one thousand years, from the eighth to the eighteenth century. The eighth century is significant to a student of warfare not so much for the first advent of the Arabs in one corner of India as for an important technical change, the disappearance of cha- riots in Northern India. 2 The eighteenth century not only witnessed the disintegration of the Mughal empire and the debacle of the Marathas at Panipat but also the penetration of the European powers into the political system in India and application of newer military technique and methods. The present paper attempts to enquire into the extent of conceptualization of war in medieval India and discusses some aspects of military think- ing and practice during this period in the background of ancient Indian and Chinese thinking as well as of the ideas of Clausewitz and Jomini of the Napoleonic era in Europe. Any conceptualization follows prior accu- mulation of knowledge. The concept of mili- tary strategy as a science has grown out of experience garnered through centuries. It is sometimes believed that India suffered from absence of military literature. There might 2 not have been many exclusive treatises on war but ideas thereon lie scattered in different branches of literature, which show consider- able progress in conceptualization. During the early medieval period we have several works like the encyclopaedic Agni Parana p the Stnriti commentaries, — of Medhatithi on Manu, 4 of Vijnaneswar 5 and Apararka 0 on Yajnavalkya, — the digest of Lakshmidhara, the Krityakalpataru (or Kalpataru) includ- ing Rajad barmakanda . 7 Again, warcraft was regarded as a part of statecraft and various works thereon also dealt with the art of war. Apart from Kautilya’s Arthasastrd* and Kamandaka’s Nitisara , 9 there were the Niti- vakyamrita of Jaina Somdev, 10 Niti-ratnakara or {Raj niti-) of Chandesvara, 11 the Sukm- nitisar of Sukracharya and the Nitipntkasika of Vaisampayana. 12 Among technical works are Yuktikalpataru and Samar an ganasutra- dhara , both attributed to Bhojraja of Malwa (11th century A.D.) 1S and Manasollasa or Abkilas'ttortha chintamoni (c. 1131), attri- buted to Somesvara III of Kalyan. 14 Among the Persian works may be mentioned Adah u’l Muluk wa Kifayat u’l mamluk or Adah u’l Harb wa' sh Shuja'at by Fakhr ud din Mubarakshah or Fakhr i Mudabbir, a contem- porary of Iltutmish, 15 the Fatawa i fahandari of Zia uddin Barani, 10 and a book on juris- prudence, Fatawa i Qarakhani of Qabul Qarakhan, a courtier of Firuz Shah.’ 7 Lite- rary, historical and semi-historical works are too numerous to mention. But special refer- ence must be made of Baharistand-Ghmbi of Mirza Nathan, 18 of a metrical history of the 10 War of Succession in mid-17th century, writ- ten by a soldier, the Aurangnamah of 'Haqiri 19 and of the Haft Anjuman of Udai- raj alias Tale’yar Khan containing the military despatches of Mirza Rajah Jai Singh 1. 20 While all these may not be of the type of the works of Chinese Sun Tzu (Sun Wu) . Prus- sian Clausewitz and Swiss Jomini, they do in- dicate considerable progress in conceptualiza- tion of war. 21 2. Role of Strategy, Tactics and Logistics Strategy, logistics and tactics are close partners in war which must work in unison. The first decides where to act, the second brings the troops to the point and the third handles them in battle. 22 The importance of logistics was duly recognised by the theorists and practical experts of medieval India. 23 The Nayaka of the Hindu writers, the Ariz of the Sultanate, 24 the Mir Manzil of the Mughals assisted by Mir Tuzaks 25 performed functions, similar, though necessarily limited and less ramified, to those of the military staff of modern times. The importance of supplies, and the need of feeding the army on the enemy was realised by Sun Tzu, 2u Clausewitz, Jomini, 27 Kautilya, Sukracharya, Fakhr-i-Mudabbir 28 and Ibn Khaldun. Loyal tributaries sometimes brought provisions, e.g., to Malik Kafur. The usual method was to decentralise the commissariat. Like merchants and providers who accompanied the Abbasid army in Asia Minor in 9th century, 29 wander- ing dealers or banjaras supplied corn to the medieval armies, both Muslim and Maratha, in India, though sometimes this failed as in Jai Singh’s Bijapur campaign ( 1666) . Failure of supplies contributed to Shivaji’s surrender at Purandar (1665), as Portuguese sources tell us, 30 and to the Maratha debacle at Panipat (1761). 31 The echeloned depots of Clausewitz and Jomini to ensure regular sup- plies were anticipated by Kautilya’s stores and thanahs. or outposts of Mughal times. Diffi- culties have to be faced by the invader during national resistance owing to 'scorched earth’ policy equally in Spain, Portugal and Russia, during the Napoleonic wars as in Mir Jumla’s Assam 32 and Jai Singh’s Bijapur campaigns 33 and in Aurangzeb’s Maratha campaigns near Madras (1692) and Dodderi (1695). 34 Forced labour was sometimes used to supple- ment normal transport agencies, as Kalhana and Manucci tell us. 35 3. Terrain (a) The principle of polarity comes into play in war. So strategy and tactics also be- come either offensive or defensive. A coun- try’s military history is largely influenced by its strategical topography. So both Clausewitz and Jomini emphasize that the first duty of the general is to study the ground carefully before selecting the most suitable theatre of war. 30 These ideas were equally known to Sun Tzu, Kautilya, Sukracharya and Fakhr i Mudabbir. 37 These were illustrated, among others, at the battles of Khajwa (1659), 3 * Jajau (1707), 39 Daulambapur (1 612), 40 and Plassey (1757). 41 Generally speaking, the value of topographical and artificial features would depend on the spirit and ability of the general. (b) Bases : It is extremely essential to have a base or bases of operations (from where the army can get its reinforcements and resources, start for offensive and to which it retreats and by which it is supported dur- ing cover for defence. 42 This is illustrated by Shivaji’s changing his base from the level country of Puna to the jungly and rugged area of Javli in 1659, as also Jai Singh’s selecting Saswad with its central position as his base against Shivaji. 43 A base on a river is very favourable. Lakhau, at the junction of the Dihing and the Brahmaputra in Assam maintained the life-line of the Mughals dur- ing Mir Jumla’s Assam campaign. 44 That an extended base is difficult to cover was illus- trated in Rajputana in the time of Aurangzeb where the imperial outposts Were too scatter- ed to be defended easily/* 11 (c) In mountainous countries the maxims o£ strategic combinations applicable in the open country are not suitable. Some of the i principles of Clausewitz and Jornini 40 are ex- emplified in Assam, N.W. Frontier and ‘Maharashtra. Mir Jumla displayed in Assam he 'strong and heroic will’, found necessary n such areas by Jornini. 47 Again, Jornini’ s ictum that the heights should be secured efore operations in valleys and that these ire to be directed upon enemy communica- tions was not illustrated in Mughal campaigns in Swat and Bajaur in the time of Akbar (1586). Disagreeing with Zain Khan’s ad- vice that the tribesmen could not be subdued without occupying their homesteads Rajah Birbal reached the crest of Malandari pass and was annihilated. 48 But it was verified in Assam and Afghanistan under Aurangzeb. In Assam Mir Jumla could not secure the heights sheltering the Ahom ruler and his guerrillas. 40 In* the N.W. Frontier the Mughals gained a complete victory over the Yusufzais by capturing a hill top where they made the last stand. In 1672 the Afridis des- cended from the hill side and cut off the imperialists under Muhammad Amin Khan. Thus the question remained whether the pos- session of mountains controlled the valleys for vice versa. 50 Jomini’s views that mountainous areas are specially favourable for defence when the var is a national one is supported by some xamples in the time of Shahjahan and Aurangzeb — in Balkh and Badakhshan, in Afghanistan ('from Qandahar to Attock’) vhere the Afridis and the Khataks united; in Maharashtra where the war became a people’s yar after Shivaji’s death. 51 Battle Order The control of the army is 'a matter of ormations and signals’. It is a matter of tac- cs. Clausewitz wanted to introduce 'metho- ism in warfare'; Jornini mentions twelve 'tders; Like Sun Tzu, however, the ancient and early medieval Indian writers conceived of innumerable army dispositions. The com- positions of the forces, the configuration of land and the nature of the enemy’s battle order all determined the army dispositions. There may be only one arm or combined arms. Jomini > like Sukracharya, was against rigid geometrical plans. Both, again, recom- mend mixture of deployments. 52 The five units of the Muslims (Centre, Right, Left, Van, Reserve) betray, according to Ibn Khaldun, Byzantine and Sassanid in- fluence. The Mughal battle order included these five units but was based on Central Asiatic practice and continued with some modifications till the end of the Empire. The Nizam improved upon it at the battle of Sakarkheda, 1724. 53 The greatest tactical difficulty is to arrange simultaneous execution of the decisive manoeuvre by different sections of the army. Hence Sun Tzu, Kautilya, Fakhr i Mudabbir conceived, equally with Jornini, the necessity of transmission of the commander’s orders by signals or flags, by drums or the horn or through couriers. These constituted a military secret. 54 5. Principles of War Some of the principles of war, formulated by Jornini and Clausewitz, were also known to Indian writers and illustrated in practice during the period under review. Gausewitz’s first dictum ’to use our entire forces with the utmost energy’ 55 was long ago anticipated by Sun Tzu and Sukracharya 50 and illustrated by the mobility and rapidity of Alauddin 67 and Sher Khan’s attack on Gaur (1538) . 58 Second- ly, the Napoleonic concentration of power, duly emphasized by Clausewitz and Jornini, was known to Sun Tzu and Kautilya and illus- trated by Timur in the battle of Delhi (1398) , making an oblique attack. 50 The third dictum of Clausewitz, never to waste time, involves 12 surprise, while the fourth implies pursuit to follow up the successes. 6. System of operations : offensive & defensive (A) Offensive : Characteristics That offensive wars have certain advan- tages was realised by military experts in medieval India as clearly as Jomini or Clause- witz. But these might also rouse the national spirit in the attacked country, e.g., in Assam and Bijapur campaigns and Rajput and Mara- tha wars in the time of Aurangzeb. 80 Some types of operations of offensive war, like enveloping, encircling, shock tactics and pursuit, mentioned by Qausewitz, were equ- ally known and applicable in ancient and medieval India. (i) The need of keeping the lines of com- munications open was anticipated by Kautilya (cf. Visuddha prist ha), Manu and Fakhr i Mudabbir. 81 (ii) Clausewitz’s principle of directing the main thrust from the front and the flank or from the rear may be compared with Kau- tilya’s suggestion of alternating rear, frontal or flank attacks. 8 "' (iii) Shock tractics involve sudden mass attack at the enemy’s vulnerable point. The Turks first harassed and bewildered the Hin- dus with mounted archers or light troopers and then charged them with heavy armoured cavalry or struck them from behind. Muha- mmad Ghuri used this at the second battle of Tarain (1192), feigning flight and throwing his select reserve cavaliers at the disordered Hindus. This exactly anticipated Jomini’S observation that the victory will remain with the party having the last cavalry reserve. 88 (iv) The operation of encircling or enve- loping by attacking the enemy from the front and the flank and in the rear, was perhaps comparable to the 'pincer movement’ of Hitler, the wheeling wings of Hannibal, and 'closing of the horns of the Crescent’ (as Gibbon says), 64 and the flanking parties of the Mongols and the Mughals. Concentration on the flanks was a very old tactics in India. It was used by Prithwiraj at the first battle of Tarain (1191), by Babur at Panipat (1526) and Khanwah (1527), by the Mughals against Himu (1556). 83 (v) The tactical advantage of combined arms, comparable to the 'fire-and movement’ of Jomini, was illustrated at Panipat in 1527, and at Talikota in 1565, when Babur and the Confederate Muslims combined artillery fire and cavalry attack respectively. 80 (vi) Deception : Deception and surprise were two principles of war, which Sun Tzu described as 'strategist’s keys to victory’. De- ception was well known to Indian theorists like Kautilya, Kamandaka, the Agni Purana, and Sukranitisara, the last of whom speaks of duplicity like the crow’s eye. Use of ruse and trickery was a common device in wars in Islam and was well-known to a Moorish essay- ist, Abu Bakr of Tortosa, to Fakhr i Mudabbir and to Ibn Khaldun. It was used by Muham- mad Ghuri in 1192. Again, epistolery diplo- macy was effectively used by Krishnadeva Ray against Orissa, Mir Jumla against Shuja, Aurangzeb against Prince Akbar. 87 (vii) Surprise, buttressed by morale and technique, often proves decisive, and has been acclaimed by Clausewitz and Jomini. But they were anticipated long ago by Sun Tzu (’up- road in the East, strike in West’), Kautilya, Sukracharya and the Agni Purana. 68 A sur- prise might be organised with regard to time, place, weapons and method. Fakhr i Mudab- bir considers the best time to be midday in summer, the time for after-lunch nap, early morning in spring and mid-night. 88 Ibn Khal- dun spoke of night surprises* 70 The time ele- ment in surprise was illustrated by Sher Khan 13 at Chausa (1539) against Humayun, 71 by Shivaji against Shaista Khan (1663),” and by Akbar’s campaigns during summer and rains. 78 Encirclement, flank or rear attack or ambuscade ( Kamin ) at an unexpected place involves a surprise in place, the last being con- sidered the most effective stratagem. At Tali- kota (1565) the confederate Muslim generals repeated Alexander’s tactics by crossing the Krishna by surprise. 74 Babur’s use of artillery in 1526 and 1527 was a technological surprise in weapons. 75 The use of archers on horse- back and the Parthian tactics of shooting dur- ing retreat illustrated surprise in method. 7 ' 5 Mawardi made the commander responsible for guarding against surprise. Good generals like Timur gave orders at Delhi to prevent night surprises. 77 7. Systems of Operations (contd.) (B) Defensive Strategy (i) A defensive strategy aims at neutrali- sing the first forward advance of the enemy, gaining time, protracting the operations, mak- ing fortified places, covering sieges and de- ferring a decisive battle till the enemy’s offen- sive potential is exhausted by marches or pri- vations or is scattered to occupy invaded areas. 78 These are illustrated in medieval India, particularly in Ahmadnagar, Asirgarh, Assam, Bijapur, Rajputana (Chitor, Marwar, Mewar), and Maharashtra. Clausewitz’s principle not to engage all troops immediately but to fatigue the oppo- nent and use a decisive mass with greatest audacity at the critical moment may be com- pared with the advice of Kautilya, Sukra- charya and Fakhr i Mudabbir. Kautilya asks the 'general not to move the army en masse , but, after assailing and confusing the enemy with one or two divisions, attack it with the remaining divisions. Sukra asks the first skirmish to be started with only half Hie army. Fakhr i Mudabbir prescribes a similar course even for the aggressor, keeping one , part of the army ahead and the rest as reserve {lasbkargab).™ (ii) Fortifications constitute an important aspect of military defence through centuries. The Agni Puratta speaks of the wealth of forts’ {durgasam patti). The Sivatattarawa- kara compares a King without a fort to a snake without poison and an elephant without rut. Strategically these shield the defender, delay the aggressor, and increase the relative value of the defensive forces. Kautilya recom- mended the erection of a chain of natural forts or strongholds along the frontiers (antapala durgas). Jomini, however, was against making a complete line of defence by building many fortresses and advised constructing only a few. Kautilya mentions four varieties of forts defended by desert, water, forests and hills. The Sukran/ti- sdra looks at the problem from a new angle and classifies fortresses according to two principles, the physical and human, arranging them in order of the degree of security, refer- ring to forts of kinsmen and valorous troops (as ornaments of all fortresses) and suggest- ing that there should be mutual dependence among the forts. Details of construction of forts have been given by Kautilya, the Mana- sara Sil pas as tr a and the Samaranganasutra- dhara , as well as by Fakhr i Mudabbir. 80 Field-Marshall Montgomery opines that the medieval Indian hill fortresses were as powerful as the best in medieval Europe. 81 The focal and strongest part of the castles in Europe and the Near East was the keep or donjon but it was very unusual in medieval India, the only exception, according to Sidney Toy, being the Bala Hissar in Gulbarga. One of the most powerful and interesting fortifi- cations was Daulatabad (Deogiri) with its essentially Hindu military architecture. Some of its peculiar features were a submerged causeway (instead of drawbridge)- the dark, steep and tortuous tunnel, and a special smoke screen device. 8 * r There were three types of Maratha fort- resses, — ^ the gad (on hill tops), the kot (in 14 level country) and durg (on sea coast), — which the people regarded as their mother. The Ahoms were experts in constructing 'in- genious and impregnable fortresses’ with phanjis or bamboo stakes, pits and palisades of timber, ditches and mounted batteries. 83 (iii) Entrenched lines and turning move- ments : Jomini points out that the strategic advantages expected by a defender by fight- ing in a prepared theatre of war with fort- resses and entrenched camps might prove to be futile in practice as these might be turned and outflanked. 84 Examples in medieval India include second Tarain (1192), where Prith- wiraj danced to the tunc of Muhammad Ghuri, Tukaroi (Tukra, 1575) » where the Mughals outflanked Daud, Dholpur (1658) where Aurangzeb turned Data’s elaborate entrenchments. Mir Jumla neutralised Shuja’s defences by his brilliant and successive turn- ing movements at Benares, Monghyr and Teliagarhi, and lastly at the water-girt island of Samdah (1659). AtRatanpur (1720) the Sayyid Dilawar was forced to leave his en- trenchments and fight on the ground chosen by the Nizam. 86 (iv) Scorched Earth Policy : The sacrifi- cial method of destroying possessions and supplies, adopted against Napoleon in the Iberian peninsula and Russia during the Napoleonic war and against the Nazis by Russia during the second world war, was known to early medieval Indian writers like Lakshmidhar and Sukracharya and also to Ziauddin Barani. 88 The principle was adopted by the Shahi ruler, Jaipal, against the Ghaz- nawids, 87 by the people of the Punjab against Timur, 88 by Rana Pratap, 88 Malik Ambar, 90 the Ahoms 91 and the Bijapuris against the Mughals.” , a (v) Passive (or static) defence proves futile and is condemned by Clausewitz asidle, Jomini as pernicious and Mao Tse Tung as a fool’s talisman, 88 Its futility is proved inseve- ral cases in medieval India, e.g., at Bilgtam (1540) 94 and at Talikota (1565).” (vi) Defensive-Offensive Strategy : The power of defensive-offensive strategy was stressed by Jomini. An aggressor may be on the defensive, the defender may turn to offensive. It is perhaps anticipated by the as ana of Sukracharya. It was adopted by the Ahoms against Mir Jumla (1662), and by the Bijapuris against Jai Singh I (1666).” 8. Guerrilla Warfare It differs from conventional or regular war- fare in almost everything, — conception, or- ganization, armament, equipment, supply* strategy, tactics, leadership and command. Orthodox guerrilla or irregular or partisan war has been a weapon of a militarily weak against a powerful aggressor through centu- ries. Some of its basic principles were known to the Rajputs, Ahoms, Marathas, Sikhs and the Deccanis in later medieval India as Oazacji. It must be admitted that this was in an inchoate form. But there were some resem- blances. Like their modern counterparts the medieval Indian guerrillas turned the condi- tions of terrain, climate and their own society against the enemy. The geographical and social features in Rajputana, Assam* Maha- rashtra, the Punjab and Bijapur favoured this sort of warfare. The Indian guerrillas used initiative and flexibility by dispersal, concen- tration and shifting of position. Examples : Pratap Singh after Haldighat, the Rajputs against Aurangzeb, the Ahoms against Mir Jumla, the Marathas with their light, mobile predatory cavalry ( ghanimt fauj), the Sikhs against the Mughals and the Abdali. The modem guerrillas do not need com- plex mechanical devices or logistics. Fighting behind enemy lines they cripple the enemy, pin him down and disrupt bis supply lines and inspire the regular forces and the people. Guerrilla warfare avoids battle but is always 15 dynamic. By their 'hit and run’ tactics com- bining distraction, surprise and mobility and by their sudden^ sharp, vicious and short attacks, the guerrillas strike the mind of the enemy. Similarly the Rathors made 'a terror of their prowess’ by unexpected appearances, elusive escapes, closing trade routes and dis- tracting the Mughal General. The elusive Deccani Cossacks made lightning raids on im- perial dominions and fanned out to gall the imperialists under Jai Singh. The superb Ahom guerrillas, avoiding pitched battles, and using blood-drinking arrows, made sur- prise raids and night attacks, and hindered enemy supplies and closed all roads. The Sikhs also adopted 'hit and run’ tactics. The Marathas avoided pitched battles (c. l6$>0). Baji Rao I’s forces adopted 'Cossack-like tac- tics’ against the Nizam during Palkhed campaign. Like their modern counterparts, the medie- val Indian guerrillas, nimble as mosquitoes, succeeded because they were ubiquitious and intangible. The Deccanis displayed the quali- ties of dispersal and coagulation like quick- silver as and when necessary. Guerrilla operations in medieval India were necessarily as decentralised as in modern times. Waged by the few they rested on the support of the many. The people played a considerable part in these operations, — in Assam, Rajputana and the Punjab, and Maharashtra. Coordination with regular warfare in stra- tegy and tactics was exemplified by the Bija- puris (1665-6) and the Marathas. Again, a striking example of the relationship between strategic defensive and strategic offensive was illustrated in Bijapur where Jai Singh made a strong case for having two armies, one for defence and the other for offence. Further, the development of guerrilla into mobile warfare was illustrated by the activities of Santa Ghor- pade, who combined Parthian tactics with guerrilla warfare and had an inborn genius for handling large bodies of men. Another feature of guerrilla warfare, viz., correct command- i.e., centralisation for strategic pur- poses and decentralisation for tactical pur- poses, was illustrated by Santa who enforced strictest discipline on his men. Thus medieval Indian guerrillas were aware at least of some of the principles of modern guerrilla warfare though specific works deal- ing with the necessary conceptualization might have been lacking.® 7 The above discussion would tend to show that notwithstanding the general uncertainty which shrouds the drama of war there are some fundamental principles of war, devia- tion from which is dangerous, and adherence to which generally leads to success. Principles of strategy and tactics, governing the plann- ing of war, use of troops and conduct of battles are quite independent of the nature of weapons and military organization, time and space.

College , 04 gong, Bihar ) The genesis of early political organisations and the idea of establishing an agency in England seeking India’s political advance- ment may be traced to the late twenties and thirties of the last century in Bengal. With the dissemination of English education and western ideas that flowed in through different channels enlightened public opinion had begun taking shape in Bengal. By the late twenties, a group of English-educated and public spirited Bengalis, headed by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, had begun to protest against such measures of the Company’s Government which affected the interests and aspirations of the people. Their modus ope- randi was to convene public meetings to ex- press public protests against measures and enactments detrimental to the cause of the country. At such meetings committees were formed to draft petitions and memorials to be addresred to the authorities in India and to the King as well as the Parliament in Eng- land. In the beginning, memorials to British kings and the Parliament were entrusted to ^influential British merchants or lawyers who had resided in India for some time. Subse- quently, members of the British Parliament were engaged for the purpose. ’The memorial of Raja Ram Mohan Roy and other distinguished Natives of India’ addressed to the King of England in 1825, recommending the restoration of the liberty [of the Indian press, may be regarded a$ the earliest memorial of the kind. This memorial was occasioned by the suppression of the liberty of the press in India by John Adam, the then Governor-General. An English gen- tleman, Silk Buckingham, the founder-editor of the Calcutta Journal , incurred the displea- sure of Adam, for some of his writings in., the Journal. Adam suddenly passed the Rule and Ordinance on March 14, 1823, suppressing the Indian press. 3 The memorial referred to was entrusted for delivery to one Colonel Leicester Stanhope.' It was rejected' probab- ly, due to lack of earnest advocacy. Just two years later, when the Company’s Government imposed duties on stamp by enacting the Stamp Act, leaders of public opinion in Calcutta, including Indians and European merchants and lawyers, formed themselves into a Committee and petitioned the local Government for the repeal of the Act. Having failed to get a favourable reply, in 1827, the Committee sent one John Craw- furd to London as "the accredited agent of Calcutta” to oppose the confirmation of the Stamp Act. 8 This first paid agent of the early constitutional agitators of India did all that an agent could do for the success of the peti- tion. He communicated with Lord Brougham and William Mackintosh for presenting the petition to the House of Commons and sent a long report of his efforts and activities to the Committee. 9 At a meeting of this Com- mittee, held in November 1828, Crawfurd’s 20 endeavours relating to the Stamp Act were appreciated. It was decided- to appoint him "agent in England to watch over the interests of this Community in concert with the East India Trade Committee in London, Liverpool and other towns under instructions from time to time from the Committee in Calcutta’’. 7 The Committee further requested him to accept the Agency on a remuneration of £ 1500 per annum for his services. 8 Crawfurd received his remuneration tor one year for his labour relating to the Stamp Act. Since he also worked as a Calcutta mer- cantile agent, he had had a part of his second year's remuneration from Calcutta merchants. As an agent of the Calcutta mercantile com- munity he did his utmost for their petitions addressed to the British Parliament. 9 The petition, recommending the abolition of the monopoly of trade with China and the remo- val of obstruction to free trade with India, was adopted at a public meeting 1 * held in the Town Hall of Calcutta, on November 15, 1829. 10 In the second year of his assignment as an agent of the inhabitants of Calcutta Crawfurd offered his services gratuitously, when the fund was exhausted. 11 He now be- came an advocate for the furtherance of India’s cause during the discussions that pre- ceded and accompanied the renewal of the Company’s Charter in 1833. 12 Another measure of the East India Com- pany's Government which produced wide- spread discontent among the landlords of the Bengal Presidency was Regulation III of 1828. Through this Regulation, the Govern* ment expressed its determination to resume rent free lands included within the zamin- daries, for the purpose of assessment. As fresh assessment resulted in the increase of revenue which had been fixed in perpetuity by the Permanent Settlement, the zemindars regar- * Among the convenors of the meeting we find the names of Ashotosh Dev, Ramsoath Tagore, Dwarkanath Tagore, Ram Mohan Roy and others. ded it as a breach of faith. They thought it was in contravention of the Permanent Settle- ment — the Magna Charta of the landed aristocracy. They regarded the measure as unjust and oppressive and launched an agita- tion against it. In 1829, a petition against the Regulation signed by two hundred distin- guished landholders of the Presidency was presented to the Government of Bengal, 13 by Dwarkanath Tagore, Prasanna Kumar Tagore, Ram Mohan Roy and others. 1 * The Government, however, did not consider the repeal or modification of the Regulation necessary. 15 Failing to get redress from the Local Gov- ernment in 1833, certain zamindars of Ben- gal, Bihar and Orissa, engaged one Ram Ratan Mukherji* then in England, to seek re- dress from the British Parliament against the "disquieting Regulation”. Ram Ratan MuV; herji published in England a pamphlet em.A tied 'An appeal to the British Nation against a violation of common justice and a breach of faith by the Supreme Government of India with native inhabitants’. 16 But Ram Ratan’s mission also failed and the grievance in ques- tion remained unredressed. The result was that discontent increased to such an alarming degree that in January, 1 837, a large body of men assembled to resist resumption opera- tions in Chittagong when the civil authori- ties called in the military and "several of the disaffected were slain in skirmish’’. 17 The repeated failure brought home to the zamindars the need of concerted action and the necessity for an organisation. And on March 19, 1838, the landed aristocracy of the Presidency formed themselves into an orga- nisation in Calcutta under the name of Land- holders’ Society. 18 One of the avowed objects * Ram Ratan Mukherji and Ram Hari Das had accom- panied Ram .Mohan to England. Afterwards Ram Ratan Mukherji became Deputy Collector of Murshi- dabad. See K. C. Mittra’s Earn Mob** Roy, pp. 8-9, Cafctttta, 18SS. ’ *«■ 21 of the Society was to protect the interests of the landholders, from resumption measures then in progress by legal means. 19 Soon after the establishment, the Society decided to peti- tion the Government against the resumption regulations. 20 At a public meeting held on October 31, 1838, under the Society’s auspi- ces** it obtained public approval to present the petition (drafted by a sub-committee of the Society) to the Government of Bengal. 21 As nothing came out of the petition the Landholders’ Society not only addressed an appeal to the Governor-General in Council but also decided to take the issue to the British Parliament. In December of the same year it appointed John Crawfurd as the agent of the Landholders’ Society and remitted £100 as remuneration. 22 Crawfurd was directed to arrange the formation of a permanent Commi- ttee in London for the management of the Society’s operations in England. 23 In January 1839, the Society received a letter from one A. Henderson of London, proposing to establish a branch of the Landholders’ Society in London. 24 A few months later John Crawfurd informed the Society that the question of resumption would be brought before the Parliament by Lord Brougham. He also infor- med that a Society under the name of British India Society had been founded in England for promoting the welfare of both Britain and India. The Landholders’ Society decided to open a public subscription in aid of the British India Society. The amount was to be retained till the aims and objects of the Society was fully understood. 33 Soon afterwards it received a communication from the Secretary of the British India Society, forwarding a prospectus of the Society and requesting for' the Landholders’ Society’s aid and concurrence for the purpose of securing the welfare and prosperity of both England /and India. 20 The Society availed itself of the ^ 1 ,,^ ! - ^ * *r ■-■ ! ■' I- ' persons, ' meeting Attsn&d by more than five thousand opportunity and directed John Crawfurd to work as a channel of communication between the two Societies and remitted to him a fur- ther sum of £250, as remuneration. 27 Now the resumption issue found a supporter in the British India Society. Lord Brougham, one of its leading members, raised the issue in the House of Lords and demanded that all papers relating to the question should be placed before the House. 28 This roused Auckland to action and he issued an order that such rent free land which had an area of less than ten bighas should not be resumed and those having an area of more that ten bighas should be resumed and perpetually settled at one half of the gross rental. 20 Not satisfied with obtaining half-justice, the Society resolved that "nothing could be done effectively without the aid of a Parlia- J mentary Agency in England’’. 30 At a meeting held on December 7, 1834, it was decided that"a subscription be opened to establish a permanent Parliamentary Agency in England and that each member subscribing annually, be bound to continue his subscription for five years or a payment in lieu thereof." A special committee consisting of Dwarkanath Tagore and three Europeans was appointed to translate the resolution into action. 32 Nothing, however, could be achieved and on December 18, 1842, the Society instructed Dwarkanath Tagore, who was going to England, to place their point of veiw before the authorities in England. Accordingly, Dwarkanath had several meetings with the President of the Board of Control at which he drew his attention to the issue of the resump- tion. 33 He entrusted the Society’s appeal memorial to one George Thompson, who accompanied him to India in December, 1842. Thompson came to, India as an agent of "The Glasgow Society for promoting the extinction of Slavery and Slave Trade and the Improve- ment of the condition of our fellow subjects — Natives of India,” and particularly to obtain a first hand knowledge of the conditions in 22 India. His visit was also intended to awaken "the native mind itself to a sense of the peo- ple’s own condition.” 30 After his arrival in Calcutta, he met some of the prominent mem- bers of the Landholders’ Society, himself became a member and was elected to its Correspondence Committee. 1 * In July 1843, the Society appointed him its unpaid agent in London' 7 at 6, Waterloo Place, Pall Mall, London. In 1844, Thompson received remitta- nces on account of office maintenance. 38 After 1844, the Landholders’ Society became almost defunct and we do not know anything about its activities either in India or in England. Besides the Landholders’ Society, George Thompson* worked as an agent of another contemporaneous political organisation of Calcutta, namely the Bengal British India Society. During his brief stay in Calcutta, he had delivered a series of political lectures organised by a group of public spiri- ted Bengalis** headed by Ram Gopal Ghose, Tara Chandra Chakravorty and others. 30 In his lectures he pointed out that the people of England were ignorant of the grievances of the people of India and if informed they would be able to support what was just and beneficial for India/ 0 He suggested that they should establish a political organisation for collecting information respecting the true state of the country and sending it first to the Government in India and afterwards to the people of England and Parliament.* 1 The members of the Society for the Acquisition of General Knowledge were very much influ- enced by Thompson’s speeches and on April 23, 1843, they converted their Society into * Parliamentarian and a famous orator, George Thomp- son was the foremost of that class of British philan- thropists who aimed at the political remuneration of India. In 1833, he assisted Raja Ram Mohan Roy in pleading the case of India at the time of the renewal of the Charter. He was one of the founders of the British India Society, London. For details see National Magazine, January 1896. ** This group had rounded a literary organisation under the name of the Society for the Acquisition of General Knowledge. the Bengal British India Society for initiation into political life* 2 "to secure the welfare, extend the just rights and advance the in- terests of all classes of people."* 9 During its eventful existence of over three years the Bengal British India Society voiced the grievances of the people by petitioning and memorializing the ruling authorities in India and in England as well. Thompson was its London agent. In t844 it took into consi- deration the apprehended deviation of the steam link between Calcutta and the Suez and submitted memorials to the Court of Directors and the House of Commons through George Thompson.* 1 But by 1844-45 the Bengal British India Society also became defunct and for nearly six years there did not exist in the country any political organisation of importance. How- ever, the necessity of a well organised poli- tical body to represent the wants and grie- vances of the people at the time of the renew- al of the Charter in 1853, led to the revival of the Landholders’ Society under the nomen- clature of the British Indian Association in October 1851. 43 The main object of the new organisation was to promote the British Indian administration by memoralizing the authorities in India or in England for the the introduction of enactments which may tend to promote the general interest of all connected with this country. 46 For a quarter of a century the British Indian Association was the chief forum of public discussion of practically all the important questions of the time and a medium through which the grie- vances, hopes and aspirations of the subject- country were communicated to the ruling authorities. Right from the beginning the Association maintained a permanent agent in England to take care of its petitions and memorials to the British Parliament at a cost greater than before. In 1852, on the eve of the termination 23 of the Charter it drew up a memorial for presenting to the British Parliament contain- ing a catalogue of grievances and valuable suggestions for the establishment of a good Government in the country. 47 It appointed one G. J. Gordon* as its representative and agent in London to take care of the memorial at the time of discussions on the Charter in the British Parliament. 49 In 1852 the Asso- ciation alone had to expend a sum of rupees ten thousand nine hundred and seventy to- wards remuneration to Gordon and other ex- penses towards the Association’s establish- ment in London. 48 In the meantime Gordon died. Had not N. B. E. Baillie, one of the executors of Gordon, succeeded in getting Earl of Honowby present the petition to the House of Lords on April 7, 1853, and Leverson Gower to the House of Commons on June 9, 1853, the submission of the memo- rials to the Parliament might have been Soon the Association appointed a Com- mittee of some distinguished persons having interest in India and Indian affairs to choose a successor to Gordon. After a careful consi- deration of several candidates the Committee elected one G. G. Macpherson for the office. During the progress of the Charter discus- sion and the sittings of the Parliamentary Committee Macpherson advocated the cause of India with great zeal and earnestness 51 In the meantime, on March 12, 1853, a Society under the name of Indian Reform Society was established at Clarence Chamber, 12 Hay Market, London, by several of the members of the British Parliament interested in the well-being of India. Among the foun- ders of this Society were persons like John Bright, J. Sullivan, George Thompson, A. D. Seymnour and others. It was established for the sole purpose of taking into consideration * Qpf4oirba4 resided Hs Calctitt* for a long time And w$s interested in the welfare of India. the renewal of the Company’s Charter. The founders thought that without reference to the petitions and wishes of the "more intelli- gent natives of India’’, it was not prudent to renew the Charter on the evidence of offi- cials and servants of the Company. Therefore, one of the resolutions adopted at the inaugu- ral meeting of the Society read "it is the duty of the Friends of India to insist upon a tempo- rary Act to continue the present Government of India for a period not exceeding three years, so that time may be given for such full enquiry and deliberation as will enable Par- liament within that period to legislate per- manently for the future administration of our Indian Empire.” 52 Immediately after the formation of the Society, the British Indian Association open- ed correspondence with it and remitted to it a sum of £ 250 raised from among members and others, in the first instance. 53 It was felt that a larger contribution was called for and a public meeting was held on June 25, 1854, at which it was resolved to raise a subscrip- tion for contributing to the funds of the India Reform Society. 54 Subsequently, the Association remitted to it a further sum of £ 500. Besides in 1853, it paid rupees seven thousand two hundred sixty one, 55 in 1854 rupees two thousand one hundred eighty- six 50 and in 1856 rupees two thousand four hundred ninety to its representative and agent in London. 67 The Indian Reform Society took a lively and sustained interest in all the matters rela- ting to India. At its third annual general meeting the British Indian Association re- corded its best thanks to the members of the Indian Reform Society for the warm and sincere interest they took "in the welfare of this country” 59 At the request of the Asso- ciation, in 1859 John Bright presented to Par- liament the Association’s memorial demand- ing reconstitution of the Legislative Council, employment of Indians to higher offices of 24 public service and to bring Indian affairs periodically to the notice of the British Parliament. The British Indian Association kept regular correspondence with the Indian Reform Society till 1891 and received ready and valu- able aid in their operations in England. 00 But gradually the Reform Society lapsed into inanition and for sometime Indian politics in England had no special body for representa- tion. In 1865, however, was founded the London Indian Society at 10, Denbigh Street, St. George’s Road, London, S.W. 8 ' It was established by some Indians residing in England in connection with study and busi- ness, for the purpose of agitating questions of Indian grievances in England and 'diffu- sing information there regarding the condi- tion of the people of India.’ When W. C. Bonnerji, the Society’s Honorary Secretary, sought the British Indian Association’s gui- dance and co-operation, the Association while pledging the same wrote "the want of an organisation in England for the agitation of native Indian questions had been seriously felt.” It also observed that "the London Indian Society will prove a powerful instru- ment of good to the mother country”.** During 1865-66, the two Associations ex- changed views and opinions on the question of petitioning the Secretary of State for India for extension of minimum age of candidates for the Indian Civil Service examination. 01 In 1867, however, the London Indian Society was amalgamated with the East Indian Asso- ciation founded in that year by Dadabhai Naroji and other Indians for the ventilation of Indian questions in England. The British Indian Association not only established a re- gular correspondence with the new' body but some of its members enrolled themselves as members of the East Indian Association also. ,M In later years, the East Indian Asso- ciation became a powerful ally to the British Indian Association in furtherance of their objects. In 1869 it strongly supported the Association’s memorial to the British Parlia- . ment for a Royal Commission of Enquiry for India. 85 Till the establishment in 1889 of the Bri- tish Committee of the Indian National Con- gress, the East Indian Association was the only body to further the cause of India in England.

A STUDY OF THE PROBLEMS OF INDIANS IN EAST AFRICA Rajkumar Yeshwant Singh (Aiansa, Gujarat) With the dawn of independence in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, new and perplexing problems confront the 360,000 Asians settled in these East African countries. Most of these inhabitants are of Indian and Pakistani ori- gin. The term 'Asian’ came to be used after the partition of India, as the more accurate 'Indian' was no longer acceptable to the Pakistani Muslims. The term ’Asian' is used here in conformity with the current practice in East Africa but it does not include Arabs, though most of the Arabs reside within the geographical boundaries of the continent of Asia. Compartmentalisation of society into a three-tier structure was one of the most strik- ing features of colonial rule in East Africa. This was reinforced by economic, social and political discrimination and segregation. The Asian community tended to occupy the mid- dle place in this system while the Africans were always at the bottom. The Europeans remained at the apex of this pyramid till independence was ushered into these countries between 1961 and 1963. The Asians described above, have to adapt themselves to new political regimes which are determined to carry out far-reaching changes in the tra- ditional roles of the different races in East Africa. In order to understand fully the com- plexity and magnitude of the problems faced by the Asian community in East Africa it is essential to contrast the colonial pattern with that envisaged by the new African leaders. When Tanganyika, Uganda and Kenya be- came independent they offered generous terms to all foreigners to stay on and become citizens. Some Asians acquired local citizen- ship; a few who had the means used their British passports to migrate to England; the rest carry on, their business dwindling, unable to make up their minds to go or to stay. Before proceeding to deal with the problems confronting Asians in East Africa it is neces- sary to understand the circumstances which led to the spread of Furopean dominion in this part of Africa and the role played by the ruling powers in determining the status of Asians in the colonies and protectorates. Historical background The territory north of the Portuguese colony of Mozambique was claimed in sove- reignty by the Sultan of Zanzibar, at whose court British influence was very strong, though German trading interest was also considerable. Before 1884, both the British and German governments were reluctant to make a political move in the area. In 1884, a young German, Dr. Car Peters, ' founded the Company for German colonisa- tion to provide capital for the acquisition of a colony. Peters went to Zanzibar and with the assistance of some local German business houses, went into the interior. Within a few days he executed treaties with about a dozen chiefs, placing the kingdoms of Useguha, Nguru, Usugara and Ukaine (about 60,000 square miles) under die protection of die 27 Company. On his return to Berlin Peters re- organised the Company into the German East African Company and demanded protection from the German government. After a slight hesitation (presumably in order to make sure that there would be no adverse international repercussions, since England was preoccupied with her disputes with Russia in Asia), Bismark proclaimed in March 1885, German ‘Suzerainty’ and ‘Protectorate’ over the terri- tories and granted the Company all rights of jurisdiction. Meanwhile, the British had also started their activities in East Africa. An Eng- lish explorer, Sir Henry Johnstone, had enter- ed the region of Mount Kilimanjaro, osten- sibly to observe the flora and fauna, but with instructions to make treaties with local chiefs. These ‘treaties’ were taken up in 1885 by some Manchester merchants and others who formed the British East Africa Association, later recognised as the Imperial British East Africa Company The territory thus acquired became the Kenya colony. During this time, Peters added to his Protectorate the Sultanate of Witu and parts of Swahililand and Somaliland. The Sultan of Zanzibar protested, but a German naval squadron appeared to strengthen the claims of the German company. Since France was also interested in East Africa, England, France and Germany appointed a joint com- mission to delimit the boundaries of their spheres of influence. An Anglo-German agreement was reached in 0<^ober-Novem- ber, 1886, by which a 10 mile wide 1000 miles long coastal belt was left with the Sultan (northern 400 under British influence and the rest under German influence). Territory south of the line drawn from the Kilimanjaro region, to Lake Victoria as also Uganda and Witu were recognised as German, while the region north of the line was recognised as British. France it was agreed, could take Mada- gascar. Faced with this agreement among the * Powers, the Sultan was forced to accept the ‘fait accompli’.. The German and British East African companies were not slow to lease from Zanzibar their respective 'spheres’ of coast. The conflict between the various Christian missionaries came to a head in Uganda in 1890. The European situation, however, was not such as to warrant hostilities between Germany and England. In July, 1890, an agreement was concluded^ whereby Germany obtained Heligoland and in exchange gave up all claims on Uganda, Zanzibar, Pemba islands, Witu, Nyasaland and some disputed territories in West Africa on the border be- tween Togoland and Ashanti. The British moved in to occupy the terri- tories over which the Germans had renounced their claim. Their East Africa Company sent a force under Captain Lugard to Uganda to offer the local king Mwanga the Company’s protection and powerful assistance. Mwanga was forced to sign the treaty. However, the French missionary interests continued to en- courage resistance to the British. Thereupon, the British company decided to withdraw its forces from Uganda, unless it could obtain financial aid from the British Government. Lugard returned to London and organised a campaign to mobilise public opinion in favour of retaining Uganda. In April, 1893, the London Chamber of Commerce stated in a report regarding Uganda : "The uniform experience of this country from 1568 down to the present region is that colonies amply repay the first expenditure in blood and money, and that they pay both in extension of trade and shipping and in the growth of national power and status It should be sufficient for us to know that in- vestments of this class are invariably good in the long run.” 'the British government decided to re- 28 establish protectorates over Uganda in 1894 and over British Africa in 1895, after taking over British East Africa company. Protecto- rates were also declared over Nyasaland (modern Malawi), Zanzibar and Pemba. The ideologues of imperialism had been emphasising the altruistic aspect of colonial expansion : it was a ‘burden’ which the white man had to shoulder in order to bring the ‘light’ of civilisation to the 'Dark Continent’. The Berlin Act of 1884 had defined the ob- jectives — to work for the uplift of the African people, to suppress slavery, to en- courage the propagation of the gospel. It is true that many of the primitive com- munities were exposed to civilisation, and that modern science and technology were carried to the African hinterland. But it should also be remembered that initially most of the European colonies were governed by business companies, and that they exploited the native population so ruthlessly that their own governments were compelled to inter- vene and to take over the administration directly. And yet the economic control of the big 'monopoly concerns’ remained practically unchanged. The ‘super’ profits from the colo- nies kept mounting up. The natives were de- prived of the more productive lands which were developed as plantations of the forest and mineral resources; they were subjected to forced labour on pitifully low wages on conditions resembling slavery; where vice was more profitable than virtue, the colonialists had no compunction in encouraging the latter; mutual rivalries and jealousies were fully exploited; and above all, the vicious principle of racial discrimination was fully upheld, thus proclaiming that Christianity was to be supported by imperialism only when it brought ‘profits’, and its fundamental prin- ciples were ignored when they clashed with colonial interests. Unde* these circumstances, it was but natural that the African people rose against ' this suffering and humiliation. The logic of imperialism had inexorably led to African resurgence. The people of Indian origin who live in* Africa today are of rfecent migration. They first went out to South Africa just about a hundred years ago. Their next immigration, three decades later, was to East Africa — Uganda to be precise — where they went to . help build the railways to open up the country. This was a pioneering effort which took a heavy toll of human lives. The hazards were great. The tropical jungle presented a formidable obstacle and then there was the tse — tse fly’ menace, the sleeping sickness, and many other local diseases to overcome According to the First Report of the Uganda Railway Committee, out of the 32,000 Indians who went there to work on the project, as many as 9000 had been invalidated or had died. Having sustained these hazards, many of them decided to remain as artisans and civil servants, while some of them took to busi- ness. They were joined by others from India and soon the retail trade passed into the hands of the people of ‘Indian’ origin. Their little shops (‘dukas’) could be found in the remo- test villages and in due time the produce from these villages began to find its way to bigger markets. It was a two-way traffic and although some people made unreasonable profits — as would happen anywhere in any community*— by and large, the partnership worked well. The trails tirelessly cleared by them opened up the country and provided new opportunities to the Inhabitants of this region. No better testimony could be quoted than that, of East African Royal Commission of 1953-55 which was by no means favourable to the people of Indian origin. It stated : "Indeed, the remarkable tenacity and courage, of Indian traders had been responsible for stimulating the wants of the indigenous 79 people even in the remotest areas, by open- ing to them a shop window on the modern world and for collecting for sale elsewhere whatever small surpluses are available for disposal”. For long the Asians acted as the middle- men between the British rulers and the African masses, working in unequal partner- ship to organise the administration and to run the market place. They accepted their handicaps and kept out of places where they were not wanted. They played no significant part in the movement for independence. In return they had the entire retail trade and the bulk of the wholesale and they entered the professions and set up industry. Aslans* Standard of Living This rose with their income and towns in East Africa came to wear an ’Indian’ look. In remote African hamlets the Indian ’dukawalla’ (shopkeepers) rose early and retired late to keep a shop open and to sup- port aged parents or young children at school back home. The success of the Asians industry and thrift continues to be an eyesore to the Africans who are now masters of their own land. This is the most serious of all problems facing Asians in East Africa. If the various Asian groups cannot inte- grate, what prospect is there, one may ask, for their integration with the Africans? A majority of Africans are still lacking in busi- ness experience and not many of them have much capital and so their introduction in Asian enterprises can begin in only a limited way. Socially they are worlds apart; and the African ruling class, in the best manner of the former colonial class or in recollection of past Asian snubs, stays aloof. \ Inter-racial marriage is mentioned only to bfe dismissed as a solution, because it is a tnattet for individuals' and cannot be adopted as f^rt of Asian policy. In the public services the principle of Africanisation keeps the top posts among Africans and hinders the entry of Asians at other levels. In politics the Asians gain by identifying themselves with the leading party in one-party States, for they escape possible reprisals from the Opposition; but they can get neither an Asian nor an Afri- can elected to represent their minority claims. They have to merge with the people in whose country they have chosen to make their home and win a position for themselves by contri- bution to the country’s social and economic growth. One glimmer of hope is the rising genera- tion of Asians and Africans who go to school together and learn to adapt themselves to one another’s beliefs and practices. It is open to the schools which are rapidly filling and multiplying under Asian teachers to breed an integrated society. The younger generations, the African citizens of tomorrow, are being taught by Asian teachers the lessons of sober and informed leadership. In the years to come such citizens should be able to take over the intermeshing of Asian-African relationships at any points. To the children of both races, collaboration, as they grow up on social, political and economic plane, must be easier than it is to their parents. On the other hand, time diminishes the prospect of Asians pulling out of East Africa, as the white settlers of Kenya did with British help. The Government of India has no plans for Indians to do likewise, nei- ther has Pakistan. Nehru’s advice to "my countrymen” to identify themselves with the land of their adoption was the soundest given. Asians have, however, to take into ac- count the prevailing turmoil and an alarming atmosphere of insecurity diagnosed by the brilliant French author Jean Ziegler whose initial remarks about coups in Africa arc quoted below in the context of the future status of Asians in East Africa. Many Africans deny * that classes exist in their society to-day. 30 They should test their convictions against the observations, the data and the theories offered by Ziegler. This will not be an easy process. The author does not sugar his pill. On the first page we read : "Most African regimes show a tendency to develop, as if by fate, into tyrannies. The stages are as fol- lows : emergency, the suppression of basic liberties, a one-party system, dictatorial powers for the president, finally the tyranny of one man or of a group of men who fight for survival (political or even physical) against a whole people becoming more and more discontented”. This is not a language to please. Jean Ziegler does not want to please, but to alarm. Laissez faire attitude of Asians Despite occasional and specific protests, for the most part Asians tended to acquiesce in this system. There were several reasons for this. On the social level the colonial com- partmentalised system suited the Asian tem- perament. Asians in Fast Africa are a pro- foundly conservative community and were therefore glad to be left alone to pursue their own traditional ways and maintain their cul- tures. Another reason why the colonial sys- tem was acceptable was that by defining areas of occupation and activity on a racial basis, it made it easier for the Asian to identify his role, and as he was an immigrant, unsure of his rights and status, he was probably grate- ful to be spared the pains of transitions and tensions of racial conflict and competition. Though he knew that certain positions of eminence were closed to him, he was to some extent sheltered from competition from the African. Furthermore, while he could never hope to rise to the highest positions in the public services, there was nothing to prevent him from amassing a fortune in the commer- cial and industrial world and in private pro- fessional practice. Indeed a number of Asians during this period rose to levels of wealth and affluence they could never have hoped to attain in their country of origin. The economic success of the Asian commu- nity in East Africa has been due to their possession of certain qualities essential for economic development. The early Asian settlers were imbued with quasi-Protestant ethics; they were remarkable for their strong commercial sense, capacity to work long hours, low propensity to consume, and passion for accumulation of capital. With increased prosperity, the new generations have relaxed their single-minded pursuit of wealth. Never- theless, a substantial number of younger Asian businessmen possess in abundance many of the qualities that enabled their fore- fathers to amass large fortunes. The qualities noted above, while vitally important for eco- nomic development, are essentially 'unheroic’ and are not likely to endear their possessors to other communities. Asians have had more than their share of criticism from Europeans in the past and increasingly from Africans Before we turn to this aspect of the prob- lem, let us examine in brief the circumstances under which Asians (particularly the bulk of the forebears of the existing Indian expatri- ates) migrated to the Eastern littoral ot Africa and proceeded thence towards the interior of the continent. The Asian community has played a remark- able role in Kenya’s history. By their perse- verance, efficiency and good conduct, Indian traders and settlers gained the confidence and respect of the native population while open- ing up the interior of Kenya. Sir John Krik in his evidence before the Sanderson Com- mittee (appointed by the Colonial Office in 19d9) stated : "But for the Indians we should not be there now. It was entirely through being in possession of the influence of these Indian merchants that we were enabled to build up the influence that even- tually resulted in our position”. Though British capital and engineering skill were engaged in the building Of the Kenya-Uganda Railway, which opened up the 31 interior for fuller development, the construc- tion of the railway was made possible only by Indian organisation, enterprise and labour. There is no exaggeration in saying that the British could not have administered the colony without the helping hand of Indians who worked not only as traders, but also as skilled labourers, garage owners, contractors, law- yers, post-office clerks, linotypists and railway officers. Above all they filled the middle sec
