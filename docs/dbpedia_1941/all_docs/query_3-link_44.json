        "text": "Understanding Languages and Literature of Bihar\n\nIndia is home to a vast linguistic diversity, with 22 scheduled languages, 114 other languages, 216 mother tongues, and 96 unspecified languages. In total, there are up to 10,000 languages spoken across various regions and communities.\n\nIn Bihar, the major language is Hindi, spoken by 80.9% of the population. Other significant languages in the state include Urdu and Santali.\n\nClassification\n\nIndian languages are diverse and have evolved from different linguistic stocks, reflecting the rich ethnic and cultural mosaic of the country.\n\nBroadly, Indian languages can be classified into six major groups:\n\nIndo-Aryan\n\nDravidian\n\nSino-Tibetan\n\nNegroid\n\nAustric\n\nThese groups have interacted and influenced each other over the centuries, leading to the major linguistic divisions seen in modern India. Among these, the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian groups are the dominant ones and encompass most of the major languages spoken in the country.\n\nThe Bihari languages, which include languages such as Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Magahi, belong to the Indo-Aryan group.\n\nIndo-Aryan\n\nIndo-Aryan languages are part of the Indo-European language family, which were introduced to India by the Aryans.\n\nThis language group is the largest in India, covering approximately 74% of the total population.\n\nThe Indo-Aryan group includes major languages spoken in northern and western India, such as:\n\nHindi\n\nBengali\n\nMarathi\n\nGujarati\n\nPunjabi\n\nSindhi\n\nRajasthani\n\nAssamese\n\nOriya\n\nPahari\n\nBihari\n\nKashmiri\n\nUrdu\n\nSanskrit\n\nLinguistic Identities in Bihar\n\nSubregional Identities: Bihar can be divided into four distinct linguistic and cultural subregions:\n\nMaithili\n\nBhojpuri\n\nMagadhi\n\nTribal languages of the Jharkhand region\n\nBihari Classification: According to Grierson, the language of Bihar, referred to as Bihari, is part of the Eastern group of Hindi languages. This classification covers an area of approximately 90,000 square miles and is spoken by around 36 million people. The region spans from the Himalayas in the north to Singhbhum in the south, and from Manbhum in the southeast to Basti in the northwest.\n\nMagadhi\n\nOrigin of Magahi: The term 'Maghi' is derived from the Sanskrit word 'Magadhi'. The region where this dialect is spoken is known as Magadha.\n\nGeographical Extent: Ancient Magadha corresponds to the modern districts of Patna and northern Gaya. However, Magahi is spoken in other parts of Bihar as well, including:\n\nNalanda\n\nAurangabad\n\nNawada\n\nMonghyr\n\nGiridih\n\nHazaribagh\n\nDhanbad\n\nNorth-eastern Palamau\n\nNorthern Ranchi\n\nCore Region: The purest form of Magahi is preserved in the districts of Patna and Gaya. This area is considered the 'core region' of the Magahi language.\n\nThe core region is important for:\n\nMaintaining the purity of the dialect\n\nPreserving cultural distinctiveness\n\nDetermining and standardizing variations of the dialect or language\n\nBhojpuri\n\nOrigin and Geographic Spread: Bhojpuri is named after Bhojpur, a town or pargana in the north-west of Shahabad district. It is spoken in various districts of Bihar, including:\n\nBhojpur\n\nRohtas\n\nChapra\n\nGopalganj\n\nSiwan\n\nChamparan\n\nMotihari\n\nPalamau\n\nRanchi\n\nHazaribagh\n\nWestern portion of Vaishali\n\nMuzaffarpur\n\nParts of Santhal Pargana\n\nInfluences: Bhojpuri has been influenced by:\n\nWestern Forms of Speech: Such as Brajbhasa, Awadhi, and Hindostani.\n\nSpiritual Movements: The Siddhas and various spiritual sects of the 9th century in Bihar and Bengal, which contributed to the development of Bhakti literature in Bhojpuri.\n\nLiterary and Cultural Significance:\n\nBhakti Literature: Sant Sahitya, or devotional literature, was produced in Bhojpuri and is linked with the Bhakti movement.\n\nFolk Tradition: Bhojpuri has a rich tradition of folk literature and songs that reflect various aspects of rural life, including sociocultural, religious, and political themes.\n\nFolk Songs and Genres: Bhojpuri folk literature includes various types of songs such as:\n\nSohar\n\nJhumar\n\nPurbi\n\nJaneo-geet\n\nBahura\n\nSitala\n\nRopani ke geet\n\nParati\n\nBhajan\n\nNachari\n\nKajari\n\nThese folk songs and tales are an integral part of Bhojpuri culture and provide insights into the daily lives and traditions of its speakers.\n\nBihari literature\n\nBhojpuri literature has been influenced by notable Hindi writers such as Raja Radhika Raman Sinha, Acharya Ramlochan Saran, Acharya Shivpujan Sahay, Divakar Prasad Vidyarthy, Ramdhari Singh ‘Dinkar’, Phanishwar Nath ‘Renu’, Gopal Singh “Nepali”, Ramesh Chandra Jha, and Baba Nagarjun.\n\nMahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan, a renowned writer and Buddhist scholar, was born in Uttar Pradesh but spent his life in Bihar, the land associated with Lord Buddha.\n\nHrishikesh Sulabh is known for his work as a short story writer, playwright, and theatre critic.\n\nArun Kamal and Aalok Dhanwa are recognized poets.\n\nHistorical work on Literature in Bihar\n\nBihar, historically known as Magadh, is one of India's most densely populated states and has been a significant center of Indian culture, education, and power since ancient times. Under the Mauryan Empire, especially during the reign of Ashoka (269 BC to 232 BC), Nalanda University emerged as a major center of learning in ancient India.\n\nBihar has long been a land of cultural and historical importance. It is the birthplace of several revered figures and significant religious developments. In Bodhgaya, Prince Gautama achieved enlightenment and became Buddha, marking the birth of Buddhism. Bodhgaya remains one of the most important and sacred pilgrimage sites for Buddhists worldwide.\n\nAdditionally, Bihar is notable as the birthplace of key figures such as Lord Mahavira, the founder of Jainism; Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth and final Sikh Guru; and Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India.\n\nNalanda\n\nBihar is home to the world’s first seat of higher learning, Nalanda University, a monastic institution that flourished from the 5th to the 11th century.\n\nThis renowned university housed 9 million books and employed 2,000 teachers who educated around 10,000 students from across the Buddhist world. Lord Buddha himself is said to have taught at Nalanda, and the 7th-century Chinese traveler Xuanzang (Hieun Tsang) was one of its prominent students.\n\nAryabhatta (476-550 A.D.)\n\nHe was born in Patliputra, now known as Patna in Bihar. His most significant contribution to mathematics is the concept of zero.\n\nIn addition to this groundbreaking work, he made significant advancements in algebra, arithmetic, trigonometry, quadratic equations, and the sine table.\n\nHe also delved into astronomy, explaining lunar and solar eclipses, the length of the year (precisely 365 days), and the contours of the Earth. Remarkably, he computed the Earth's circumference as 24,835 miles, which is very close to the modern measurement of 24,900 miles.\n\nQuestion for Language and Literature of Bihar\n\nTry yourself:\n\nWho is credited with the concept of zero in mathematics?\n\nA.\n\nAryabhatta\n\nB.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh\n\nC.\n\nLord Buddha\n\nD.\n\nMahavira\n\nExplanation\n\n- Aryabhatta is credited with introducing the concept of zero in mathematics.\n\n- He was a renowned mathematician and astronomer from ancient India.\n\n- Aryabhatta made significant contributions to various mathematical fields, including algebra, arithmetic, and trigonometry.\n\nReport a problem\n\nView Solution\n\nAt present Bihar stand\n\nBihar today seamlessly blends its historic legacy with the modern technological era.\n\nDespite commercial challenges, the state's commitment to education and literacy remains strong.\n\nAn example of this dedication is Super 30, an organization in Bihar that provides free training to 30 underprivileged students each year.\n\nSuper 30 helps these students prepare for the IIT entrance exam, one of the most challenging exams globally.\n\nRemarkably, all 30 students trained by Super 30 consistently achieve top 100 rankings out of 3.6 million candidates across India.\n\nMore point on Literature of Bihar"
