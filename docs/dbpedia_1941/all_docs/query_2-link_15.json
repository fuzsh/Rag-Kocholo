        "text": "23 February 2023\n\n169 Viewed 169\n\nBy Sanjay Jha, Author\n\nMaithili is an Indo-Aryan language primarily spoken in the Mithila region of India and Nepal. It is the second largest language in Bihar and is also spoken in neighbouring states such as Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nMaithili has a rich cultural and literary heritage dating back to the medieval period, and has contributed significantly to Indian and Nepalese culture. It is estimated that there are around 33 million Maithili speakers worldwide, making it one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. Despite its popularity, Maithili is classified as an endangered language by UNESCO, as its usage is declining rapidly.\n\n◆History and Origins:\n\nMaithili, also known as Tirhuta, originated in the Mithila region of India and Nepal, and has a history dating back to the 14th century.\n\nThe language was initially written in the Maithili script, also known as the Tirhuta script, which is still used by some Maithili speakers today. However, the language was later influenced by Sanskrit, and today it is written using the Devanagari script.\n\nMaithili has a rich history of literature, with works dating back to the 14th century. The famous poet Vidyapati is considered to be the father of Maithili literature, and his works are still popular today. Maithili has also produced several other famous poets and writers, including Acharya Ramlochan Saran, Raja Jai Singh, and Bhikhari Thakur. The language was commonly used by the royalty, scholars, and poets of the region. In the 20th century, Maithili was recognized as a distinct language, and efforts were made to develop it as a language of literature and communication.\n\nMaithili has a vast collection of folklore, songs, and stories. These are an integral part of the Maithili culture and are passed down from generation to generation. Maithili literature has made significant contributions to the Indian literary scene, and several works have been translated into other Indian languages.\n\n◆Maithili in contemporary times:\n\nMaithili is spoken primarily in the Mithila region of India and Nepal. It is also spoken by the Maithil community living in other parts of India and in other countries. Maithili has been recognized as one of the official languages of India, and efforts are being made to promote the language and develop it as a language of literature and communication.\n\nMaithili is recognized as one of the official languages of India and Nepal, and is spoken by approximately 33 million people. In India, Maithili is mainly spoken in the Bihar and Jharkhand regions, while in Nepal it is spoken in the Terai region. The language has been included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, which means that it is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India.\n\nDespite its official status, Maithili has faced challenges in terms of recognition and promotion. In India, Maithili is not taught as a subject in schools, and the language is often seen as a dialect of Hindi. This has led to a lack of resources for the language, and a lack of support for its promotion and preservation.\n\nHowever, efforts are being made to promote and preserve Maithili. Several organizations have been established to promote the language, and there are now several Maithili newspapers and magazines. In addition, there are now Maithili language courses available online, and the language is being used more frequently in films, music, and other media.\n\nThe Maithili language has faced several challenges in contemporary times. One of the major challenges is the lack of political will to promote the language. As a result, Maithili has not been given its due recognition as a language of literature and culture. The other challenge is the influence of Hindi and English, which are spoken widely in India and have had an impact on the Maithili language.\n\nEfforts are being made to revive the Maithili language and promote it as a language of literature and communication. Several organizations have been set up to promote the language, and efforts are being made to develop it as a medium of instruction in schools. The Maithili language has a rich history and culture, and efforts must be made to preserve and promote it for future generations.\n\n◆Grammar and Phonology:\n\nMaithili is a highly inflected language, with a complex grammar system. It has several cases, including the nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, ablative, locative, and instrumental. It also has a gender system, with masculine, feminine, and neuter genders. The language is also known for its use of retroflex consonants, which are produced by curling the tongue back and touching the roof of the mouth.\n\nThe Maithili script is based on the Brahmi script, and is similar to other scripts used in the region, such as Bengali and Assamese. It is a syllabic script, with each consonant having an inherent vowel sound. However, like other Indic scripts, the vowel sound can be modified by diacritics.\n\n◆Writing system:\n\nThe Maithili language has two writing systems, namely the Mithilakshar script and the Devanagari script. The Mithilakshar script is the traditional script of the Mithila region and is similar to the Bengali script. However, the script is not used as widely as the Devanagari script, which is used to write most of the modern Maithili literature.\n\n◆Conclusion:\n\nMaithili is a rich and complex language with a long history and a vibrant cultural heritage. Despite the challenges it has faced in terms of recognition and promotion, efforts are being made to preserve and promote the language. As a language with millions of speakers, Maithili has an important role to play in the cultural and linguistic diversity of India and Nepal, and it is important that it is given the support and resources it needs to thrive in the modern world.\n\nMore Books by Sanjay Kumar Jha\n\nSanjay Kumar Jha\n\n5 Followers\n\nEarly Life: It was 12th June of 1987 when Sanjay Jha was born to the family of Smt Sadhana Jha and Sri Govind Jha in the village of Dularpur falling in the district of Darbhanga of Bihar at a distance of 132 km from the state capital Patna.
