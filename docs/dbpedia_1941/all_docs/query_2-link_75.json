        "text": "India&#39;s performance in recent years has been among the best in the world. Growth may be higher in the last two decades but inclusive growth or equitable development has been missing. India&#39;s development agenda will need to be expanded to include not only the eradication of extreme poverty, but an inclusive growth strategy to address the legitimate concerns of the population. Poverty alleviation with micro credit is now well recognized all over the world. Gender discrimination continues to be an enormous problem within Indian society. The role of women in the India’s economic growth and development is inevitable. Empowerment is a multi-dimensional social process that helps people gain control over their own lives communities and in their society, by acting on issues that they define as important. The micro finance project intervention in terms of formation and stabilization of SHGs for extending credit support and promotion of thrift to promote viable economic activities. Sel...\n\nIn a country like India where 70 percent of its population lives in rural area and 60 percent depend on agriculture (according to the World Bank reports), micro-finance can play a vital role in providing financial services to the poor and low income individuals. Micro-finance is regarded as a useful tool for socioeconomic up-liftment in a developing country like India. It is expected to play a significant role in poverty alleviation and development. The emphasis of present paper is to study the performance and role of microfinance institutions in the development of India. The study revealed that the number of MFIs availing loans from banks during the year 2015-16 and 2016-17 increased from 9.8 per cent to 257.6 per cent. The total loans to MFIs by banks decreased during 2016-17 by 7.2 per cent over the previous year. The loan outstanding against MFIs increased all the subsequent years. It increased by 13.7 per cent and 14.3 per cent in 2015-16 and 2016-17. It is further found that the business models of MFIs in India are becoming urban centric as is indicated by the fact that the share of rural client's base of different states/UTs in 2017 with 2016 has declined, except Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Jammu & Kashmir and Andaman. The highest increase was in Andaman (267%) followed by Jammu & Kashmir (17 %),. The proportion of income generation loan remained same during year 2015 and it increased up to 94 per cent in the year 2017. The indicators relating to overall financial structure such as Return on assets and Return on equity, capital adequacy ratio have increased over this period and found sharp decline in total assets of MFI's.\n\nThe concept of micro-credit was developed to mobilize small savings of poor people to create deposit, which may be accessible to unreachable and un-bankable poor, especially women. The study has highlighted that microfinance is an effective tool for bringing positive impact on the economic status of the respondents along with their family members. It has helped to generate extra income for their family and their own use. The extra income allows the respondents family to buy nutritious food, access to modern health care services and they can afford to send their children to the school.\n\nABSTRACT Saving mobilization can help to gain financial independence, increase profitability and help Microfinance institution to reach financial self-sufficiency. The study seeks to identify the factors affecting microfinance saving mobilization at Wasasa microfinance institution, East Wollega zone, Oromia region,Ethiopia. Descriptive study was used; primary data was collected from 268 respondents by using questionnaires and interview method. The collected data was analyzed by using SPSS Version 16 and presented in the form of percentages and descriptive. Multiple regression analysis was used to interpret the factors i.e. eight variables ,income level, financial literacy level, culture, awareness of society, interest rate, inflation rate, convenience of the office and microfinance service. Further chi-square is used to test hypothesis. the regression result shows that: Income level, inflation, financial literacy level and service quality had a negative impact on microfinance saving mobilization and, on the other hand Convenience of the office, culture, interest rate and awareness of the society has had positive impact on microfinance saving mobilization. Finally the study had recommended what should be done to mobilize more savings.\n\nMicro-financing has been globally praised for alleviating poverty and empowering the most vulnerable by providing financial services to marginalized groups who would otherwise not have access to banks and credit institutions. A twenty-year-old model, microfinance in India has revolved around targeting women, primarily lumped around the below-poverty-line determined by the World Bank each year. While microfinance has become standardized, institutionalized, and commercialized over the years, we must examine whether women have become a mere vehicle for such microfinance institutions to claim empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation, or if they are engaged in progression towards gender equality and social development. This cross-sectional exploratory study explores three types of microfinance outfits: for-profit, cooperative, and non-profit. By employing a variety of qualitative methods including structured and semi-structured in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, participant observation, and secondary findings, the study investigates the shift of the female member’s role within the trend of microfinance standardization in the Indian context. I examine the different levels of organization of three microfinance institutions in order to understand their current and future aspirations, their targeting approaches, and the shift of women members from participants to targets. I find that, contrary to the hypothesis of a cooperative being the most democratic and therefore inclusive form of financial access for female clients, the distinctions in practices and performances This study aims to bring awareness to the impact of microfinance on women through the lens of gender equality and commercialization while exploring the implications of the reviving microfinance industry in India ."
