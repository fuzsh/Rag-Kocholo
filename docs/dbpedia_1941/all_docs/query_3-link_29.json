        "text": "Hindi हिन्दी is an Indo-European language spoken in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and throughout the Indian diaspora in Fiji, Singapore, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Trinidad, Suriname, Guyana, South Africa, UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, Germany, etc.). Of the 22 national languages and over 1,000 dialects of India, Hindi is promoted by the government and viewed by over half the population as a \"link-language.\"\n\nHindi is descended from Sanskrit, sometimes called \"the mother of all languages,\" or \"Latin of the East.\" Hindi developed from the proto-Hindi खड़ी बोली Khaṛī Bolī (lit. \"Pure language\"). A mixture of Hindi and Urdu, called Hindustani (though this name is also applied to the Caribbean dialect of Hindi), is the form heard in most Bollywood films, that try to appeal to the widest audience possible. Hindustani is different than what is taught at the literary level and what is used by news programs and the government in India.\n\nA striking fact is that, depending on the source, Hindi is listed anywhere from the 2nd-5th most widely spoken language in the world. In contrast to languages such as Mandarin or Spanish, there has not been much stress outside of India in promoting Hindi education. In 2006, however, President Bush brought education of India's languages, including Hindi, to the forefront in the United States through the National Security Language Initiative, thus highlighting the need for closer ties and understanding between the two countries.\n\nWriting\n\nHindi is written in the Devanāgarī (देवनागरी) script, shared with Nepali, Marathi and a number of other Indian languages. Learning Devanagari is not quite as difficult as you might think at first glance, but mastering it takes a while and is beyond the scope of most travellers. See Learning Devanagari for a primer.\n\nPronunciation\n\nMost English speakers find Hindi pronunciation rather challenging, as there are 11 separate vowels and 35 separate consonants, employing a large number of distinctions not found in English. Don't let this intimidate you: for most of its speakers, Hindi is not a mother tongue, and many native speakers are quite used to regional accents and mangling in various degrees.\n\nVowels\n\nThe key distinction is the difference between short and long vowels. In this phrase book, long vowels are noted with a macron (ā), which short vowels are listed without one. You will often come across non-standard romanizations, noted in parentheses below when applicable.\n\nDevanagari Transliteration Equivalent अ a as in about आ ā as in father इ i as in sit ई ī (ee) as in elite उ u as in put ऊ ū (oo) as in flute ऋ ṛ as in Scottish heard, trip. ए e long e. It is not a diphthong; the tone does not fall. ऐ ai as in Mail, sometimes a longer ए. As in bright (IPA ıj). ओ o not a diphthong; tone does not fall. औ au as in town.\n\nConsonants\n\nMany Hindi consonants come in three different forms: aspirated, unaspirated and retroflex.\n\nAspiration means \"with a puff of air\", and is the difference between the sound of the letter \"p\" in English pin (aspirated) and spit (unaspirated). In this phrasebook, aspirated sounds are spelled with an h (so English \"pin\" would be phin) and unaspirated sounds without it (so \"spit\" is still spit). Hindi aspiration is quite forceful and it's OK to emphasize the puff: bharti.\n\nHindi retroflex consonants, on the other hand, are not really found in English. They should be pronounced with the tongue tip curled back. Practice with a native speaker, or just pronounce as usual — you'll usually still get the message across.\n\nDevanagari Transliteration Equivalent/Comments क k as in skip. ख kh as in sinkhole. ग g as in go. घ gh as in doghouse. ङ ṅ as in sing. Used only in Sanskrit loan words, does not occur independently. च c as in church. छ ch as in pinchhit. ज j as in jump. झ jh as in dodge her. ञ ñ as in canyon. Used only in Sanskrit loan words, does not occur independently. ट ṭ as in tick. Retroflex, but still a \"hard\" t sound similar to English. ठ ṭ as in lighthouse. Retroflex ड ḍ as in doom. Retroflex ढ ḍ as in mudhut. Retroflex ण ṇ retroflex n. Used only in Sanskrit loan words. त t does not exist in English. more dental t, with a bit of a th sound. Softer than an English t. थ th aspirated version of the previous letter, not as in thanks or the. द d dental d. ध dh aspirated version of the above. न n dental n. प p as in spin. फ ph as in u'ph'ill. ब b as in be. भ bh as in abhor. म m as in mere. य y as in yet. र r as in Spanish pero, a tongue trip. Don't roll as in Spanish rr, German or Scottish English. ल l as in lean. व v as in Spanish vaca, between English v and w, but without the lip rounding of an English w. (IPA: ʋ). श ś as in shoot. ष ṣ almost indistinguishable retroflex of the above. slightly more aspirated. Used only in Sanskrit loan words. स s as in see. ह h as in him.\n\nStress\n\nFor emphasizing words don't stress them by voice (which would be regarded as a sign of aggressiveness) but add a to after them.\n\nyeh kyā hai? (\"what's this?\") → yeh to kyā hai? - (\"what is this?\")\n\nVoice should always be very low and with few changes in pitch, loudness and stress, so please: relax!.\n\nOne of the only stresses found in Hindi is the last long syllable prior to the last syllable (e.g. in \"dhānyavād\" stress \"dhā\"). But it is a mild stress which occurs naturally, so don't force it. Don't even think about it!\n\nशुभकामनाएँ! / śubhkāmnāe! / Good luck\n\nHindi Phrases\n\nCultural Notes\n\nGreetings: There are no time elemental greetings in Hindi such as good morning, good afternoon, etc. And each religion has its own greetings. It is considered very gracious to address a person by their respective greetings, but not necessary. Namaste is the most ubiquitous greeting, and though of Hindu origin is now mostly secular. It is said with hands folded and a small gesture of bowing – but don't go overboard Japanese style! Namaste literally means \"I bow to you.\" Namaste The original religious significance was of bowing to the soul (ātmā) within another. It is custom to touch the feet of someone older than you when saying Namaste. Namaskār has the same meaning, but is used less often in Hindi, though it is common in other Indian languages such as Gujarati and Bengali. Namaskār is thought of as more formal, and as such is used more often when addressing a group or a person of importance. The Sikhs also fold their hands and bow, but have their own greetings. Sat srī akāl is the most common, which comes from the Punjabi ਸਤਿ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ meaning \"God alone is Truth.\" Though Sikhism is mostly centered in the Punjab region of India, Punjabi greetings are used by Sikhs all over the world, as Punjabi is the language of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh Scripture. After meeting someone for the first time āpse milkar bahut khuśī huī. may be said, meaning \"after meeting you much happiness has happened (to me).\"\n\nCivilities: In Western cultures saying phrases like please, thank you, you're welcome, excuse me, sorry, etc. are so ingrained into us from a young age that we say them without a second thought. Not so for Indians. Saying such phrases in an inappropriate circumstance might even embarrass the person, or cheapen the gravity of the phrase itself. These phrases are only said in a sincere sense. For example, don't say धन्यवाद (thank you) after a clerk hands you your grocery bag, but when someone goes out of their way to do something nice for you. Sometimes English words themselves are used; due to the British colonial influence, especially in urban areas and among the upper class. In this case use them as you would in English. Just remember that like Germans, and the French, they sometimes have trouble with English th sounds and therefore pronounce th as थ. When someone is in your way, instead of saying excuse me, or zara suniye, just let out an aspirated ts sound with your tongue behind your teeth to attract their attention. This might seem rude, but is no more rude than children saying \"pssst\" to get a friend's attention during class! In conclusion, though Hindi has corresponding words to ours, this does not mean that the context in which they are used also correspond likewise. Don't let all of this lead you to believe Indians are cold though – nothing could be further from the truth! These sentiments are merely communicated through body language rather than verbally. To show your thanks, a simple smile will do the trick. Other common gestures include the infamous \"head bobble\"; and a hand gesture made by swiftly swinging the wrist so your palm is facing the sky and your forefingers slightly elongated. Before travellling to India, rent some Bollywood films so that if a spontaneous Bhangra breaks out in the streets, you'll be ready to join in! All kidding aside, they can demonstrate body language and customs far better than any book is able to, all while acclimatizing you to the language as well.\n\nPrefixes & Suffixes: With the words for \"yes\" and \"no\" jī (जी) may be added before to give it a more polite tone. Sometimes speakers will simply reply with jī, as an affirmation of something someone says. Jī is added to a person's name as a sign of respect. For example; in India Mahatma Gandhi is known simply as Gandhiji (गांधीजी). Another suffix which is indispensable is vāla (-वाला), often rendered in English as \"-wallah\". Many books devote whole chapters to vāla. With nouns it gives the meaning \"the one or thing that does\" and with verbs, it indicates something is about to happen. Examples:\n\nnoun – shop (दुकान dukān) + vāla = shopkeeper (दुकानवाला dukānvāla)\n\nverb – to come (आना āna) + vāla = (the) ... is coming (... आनेवाला है ... ānevāla hay)\n\nEnglish Loan Words: The British Empire's influence spread into the language itself, and this continues today with American culture being exported throughout the world. So, an English word or phrase may almost always be inserted into any Hindi sentence. You will often hear Indians, whom while talking in Hindi, pepper their sentences with English words. Sometimes they'll even alternate sentences, going from Hindi to English, and back to Hindi! Upon meeting an Indian, many times you may not even get to practice your Hindi, because they want to practice their English on you! English loan words are particularly used for modern inventions/technologies, so words like TV, computer and microwave are the same as in English apart from the slight change of accent. However; this is mostly in the cities, and learning some Hindi will have been all the more rewarding when in rural or non-tourist areas, as well as allowing you to communicate with a wider variety of people in the cities.\n\nGender & The 2nd Person Pronoun: Certain words have different endings depending on your gender. If you are a man say these with an -a suffix, and if you're a woman, -ī. However; when addressing the person respectively with āp (आप), the masculine ending takes the plural form. This is not all that different from the behavior of other Indo-European languages, c.f. German Sie, which like āp is also both the respectful 2nd person pronoun and plural form of address. The other two forms are the familiar tum (तुम) and intimate tū (तू). These change the forms of certain words. Tum is for friends and peers, tū for small children (within the family); between 'significant others' in private; traditionally to lower castes; in the past, slaves; and, paradoxically, when supplicating to the gods/God (c.f. Greek mythology). As a general rule, stick with āp, until you become more familiar with the language and culture. Forget about tū altogether, at the best using it would be a faux pas and at the worst, very offensive. For those reasons as well as practical ones, this section will only use the āp form.\n\nBasics\n\nEnglish Hindi Transliteration Hello (used esp. when answering the phone) हेलो helo Hello/Goodbye नमस्ते namaste Hello/Goodbye नमस्कार namaskār Hello/Goodbye (Hindu, respectful) प्रणाम praņām Hello/Goodbye (Hindu, colloquial) राम राम rām rām Hello/Goodbye (Sikh) सत श्री अकाल sat śrī akāl Hello/Goodbye (Sikh, formal) वाहिगुरू जी का खाल्स vāhegurū jī ka khālsa Hello/Goodbye (Sikh, reply) वाहिगुरू जी की फ़तह vāhegurū jī kī fateh See you later फिर मिलेंगे phir milenge How are you? आप कैसे/कैसी हैं? āp kaise/kaisī hai?

Developed in India, they were borrowed by the Arabs, and gradually spread to Europe. The similarities are hard to miss. Here are their respective numerals.\n\nRoman Devanagari 0 ० 1 १ 2 २ 3 ३ 4 ४ 5 ५ 6 ६ 7 ७ 8 ८ 9 ९\n\nHindi numbers ending in 9 are named as \"un\" (-1) plus the next multiple of ten. Instead of naming powers of a thousand, Hindi has unique names for a thousand, a hundred thousand, ten million etc. These peculiarities don't seem to have effected the proliferation of Indian mathematicians.\n\nNumeral Hindi Transliteration Numeral Hindi Transliteration Numeral Hindi Transliteration Numeral Hindi Transliteration 0 शून्य shUnya, bi.ndi 25 पच्चीस paccīs 50 पचास pacās 75 पचहत्तर pachattar 1 एक ek 26 छब्बीस chabbīs 51 इक्यावन ikyāvan 76 छिहत्तर chihattar 2 दो do 27 सत्ताईस satāīs 52 बावन bāvan 77 सतहत्तर sathattar 3 तीन tīn 28 अट्ठाईस aṭṭhāīs 53 तिरपन tirpan 78 अठहत्तर aṭhhattar 4 चार chār 29 उनतीस untīs 54 चौवन cauvan 79 उन्यासी unyāsī 5 पांच pānc 30 तीस tīs 55 पचपन pacpan 80 अस्सी assī 6 छह, छै, छः cheh, chai, cheḥ 31 इकत्तीस ikttīs 56 छप्पन chappan 81 इक्यासी ikyāsī 7 सात sāt 32 बत्तीस battīs 57 सत्तावन sattāvan 82 बयासी bayāsī 8 आठ āṭh 33 तैंतीस taintīs 58 अट्ठावन aṭṭhāvan 83 तिरासी tirāsī 9 नौ nau 34 चौंतीस cauntīs 59 उनसठ unsaṭh 84 चौरासी caurāsī 10 दस das 35 पैंतीस paintīs 60 साठ sāṭh 85 पचासी pacāsī 11 ग्यारह gyāreh 36 छत्तीस chattīs 61 इकसठ iksaṭh 86 छियासी chiyāsī 12 बारह bareh 37 सआंतीस saintīs 62 बासठ bāsaṭh 87 सात्तासी sattāsī 13 तेरह tereh 38 अड़तीस aṛtīs 63 तिरसठ tirsaṭh 88 अट्ठासी aṭṭhāsī 14 चौदह caudeh 39 उनतालीस untālīs 64 चौंसठ cainsaṭh 89 नवासी navāsī 15 पंद्रह pandreh 40 चालीस cālīs 65 पैंसठ painsaṭh 90 नब्बे nabbe 16 सोलह soleh 41 इकतालीस iktālīs 66 छियासठ chiyāsaṭh 91 इक्यानवे ikyānave 17 सत्रह satreh 42 बयालीस bayālīs 67 सरसठ sarsaṭh 92 बानावे bānave 18 अठारह aṭhāreh 43 तैंतालीस taintālīs 68 अड़सठ aṛsaṭh 93 तिरानवे tirānave 19 उन्नीस unnīs 44 चवालीस cavālīs 69 उनत्तहर unhattar 94 चौरानवे caurānave 20 बीस bīs 45 पैंतालीस paintālīs 70 सत्तर sattar 95 पचानवे pacānave 21 इक्कीस ikkīs 46 छियालीस chiyālīs 71 इकहत्तर ikhattar 96 छियानवे chiyānave 22 बाईस bāīs 47 सैंतालीस saintālīs 72 बहत्तर behattar 97 सत्तानवे sattānave 23 तेईस teīs 48 अड़तालीस aṛtālīs 73 तिहत्तर tihattar 98 अट्ठानवे aṭṭhānave 24 चौबीस caubīs 49 उनचास uncās 74 च्हत्तर cauhattar 99 निन्यानवे ninyānave\n\nNumeral Hindi Transliteration 100 सौ sau 200 दो सौ do sau 300 तीन सौ tīn sau 1000 हज़ार hazār 2000 दो हज़ार do hazār 3000 तीन हज़ार tīn hazār 1,00,000 लाख lākh 1,00,00,000 करोड़ karoṛ 1,00,00,00,000 अरब arab 1,00,00,00,00,000 ? kharab number _____ (train, bus, etc.) नबंर _____ ट्रेन, बस, ... nambar _____ ṭren, bas, ... 1 half आधा ādhā less कम/थोड़ा kam/thoṛa more अधिक/ज्यादा adhika/jyada\n\nTime\n\nEnglish Hindi Transliteration now अब, अभी ab, abhī later बाद में, फिर bād me, phir before पहले pehle morning सुबह, सवेरा subeh, savera(early morn.) afternoon दोपहर dopehar; sa pehar evening शाम shām night रात rāt\n\nClock time\n\nEnglish Hindi Transliteration one o'clock AM रात में एक बजे rāt me ek baje two o'clock AM रात में दो बजे rāt me do baje noon दोपहर dopehar one o'clock PM दोपहर एक बजे dopehar ek baje two o'clock PM दोपहर दो बजे dopehar do baje midnight आधी रात ādhī rāt\n\nDuration\n\nEnglish Hindi Transliteration minute मिनट minaṭ hour घंटा ghanṭa day दिन din week हफ़्ता hafta month महीना mahīna year साल sāl\n\nDays\n\nEnglish Hindi Transliteration Today आज āj Yesterday/Tomorrow (depends on context/tense) कल … kal Day after tomorrow/day before yesterday परसों parso Week हफ़्ता hafta This week इस हफ़्ते is hafte Last week पिछले हफ़्ते pichle hafte Next week अगले हफ़्ते agle hafte Two weeks दो हफ़्ते do hafte Month महीना mahīna\n\nThe Hindu days of the week are each ruled by a planet, and corresponding exactly to ancient cultures in the West, i.e. Sunday = Ravivār (Lord of the Sun's day [lit. time or period]). Thursday/O.N. Þorsdagr, Thor's day = Guruvār (Lord of Jupiter's day), Saturday/Saturn's day = Śani's (Lord of Saturn's day), etc. Unlike her Western counterparts, in India, Astrology is still a vital part of Hindu culture. Though attitudes may vary on its validity, priests are still consulted, as per tradition, for an auspicious day to hold a wedding. -वार (-vār), meaning day, time, or period is often dropped colloquially.\n\nDay Hindi Transliteration Sunday इतवार/रवि‍वार itvār, ravivār (Sun) Monday सोमवार somvār (Moon); pīr Tuesday मंगलवार/मंगल mangalvār (Mars); mangal Wednesday बुधवार/बुध budhvār (Mercury); budh Thursday गुरुवार/बृहस्पितवार guruvār (Jupiter)/būhaspitvār Friday शुक्रवार śukravār (Venus) Saturday शनि‍वार śanivār (Saturn)\n\nMonths\n\nIndia has two main calendars in use, though other groups like the Parsis have their own calendar as well. The Western (Gregorian) calendar is used for day to day and business affairs, and the Hindu calendar is used by religious communities.\n\nGregorian Calendar\n\nName Hindi Transliteration January जनवरी janvarī February फ़रवरी farvarī March मार्च mārc April अप्रैल aprail May मई maī June जून jūn July जुलाई julāī August अगस्त agast September सितम्बर sitambar October अक्तूबर aktūbar November नवम्बर navambar December दिसम्बर disambar\n\nHindu Calendar\n\nThe Hindu Calendar (विक्रम संवत् Vikram saṃvat) is named after a legendary king of Ujjain who is supposed to have founded the Vikramditya (विक्रमादित्य) era c. 56 BCE. The year 57 BCE was the first year of this (संवत् saṃvat) era. Thus, to calculate the current date of the Hindu calendar add 57 years. Today the Hindu Calendar is used mainly for religious purposes and calculating festivals. Because it is based on the lunar month, every 30 months an \"impure\" intercalary leap month is added during which no ceremonies are performed. The Hindi names are variations of the original Sanskrit ones.\n\nName Hindi № of Days Gregorian Equivalent Caitra चैत्र/चैत 30 (March - April) Baisākh बैसाख 31 (April - May) Jeṭh जेठ 31 (May - June) Asāṛh असाढ़ days June-July Sāvan सावन 31 (July-August) Bhādo भादों 31 (August-September) Kvār क्वार 30 (September-October) Kātik कातिक 30 (October-November) Aghan अगहन 30 (November-December) Pūs पूस 30 (December-January) Māgh माघ 30 (January-February) Phagun फागुन 30 (February-March) Malmās मलमास ? ?\n\nWriting the time and date\n\nGive some examples how to write clock times and dates if it differs from English. The time is written exactly as in English, that is hours followed by minutes. 12:45am will thus be दोपहर के 12 बजकर पैंतालीस मिनट (dopehar ke 12 bajkar paintālīs minaṭ), note that बजकर (bajkar) would indicate something like \"o'clock\" in English . मिनट (minaṭ) is just a literal translation of \"minutes.\"\n\nColors\n\nColor Hindi Transliteration color रंग rang colorful रंगिरंगा bahut bahAna, rangabirangī colorless बेरंग berang black काला kālā white सफ़ेद safed/shwet red लाल lāl pink, rosy गुलाबी gulābī orange नारंगी nārangī saffron केसिरया kesirayā yellow पीला peela green हरा harā blue नीला neelā turquoise फ़िरोज़ी firozī purple बैंगनी, जाम्नी bainganī, jāmnī brown भूरा bhūrā gray स्लेटी sleṭī golden सुनहरा sunaharā silver चांदी chāndhī (also the metal) shiny चमकीला camkeelā deep, dark गहरा gaharā pale, light हल्का halkā\n\nTransportation\n\nTravel Vocabulary\n\nEnglish Hindi Transliteration Train ट्रेन, रेलगाड़ी ṭren, relgāṛī Train Station स्टेशन sṭeśan Bus बस bas; baṛī Bus Station बस का अड्डा bas ka aḍḍa Bus Stop बस स्टाप bas sṭāp Rickshaw रिक्शा rickśa Auto Rickshaw आटो āṭo Taxi टैक्सी ṭaiksī Car गाड़ी, कार gāṛī, kār Airplane हवाई जवाज़ havāī jahāz Airport हवाई अड्डा havāī adda\n\nBus and Train\n\nHow much is a ticket to _____ ?\n\n_____ जाने की टिकट कितने की है? _____ jaane ki ticket kitne ki hai?\n\nOne ticket to _____\n\nएक _____ की टिकट दीजिये.

Instead of anger of frustration, the Hindi student should instead feel a smug superiority of being ahead of everyone else who are learning other languages, which may fill the rows of bookshelves in bookstores now, but cannot compare with the vast amount of volumes to be written on Hindi in the future! Here is a list of the better books and dictionaries. Stay away from books written for Indians who already know another related Indian language (such as the National Integration series), which make such claims as \"Learn This or That Language in 30 days!\" Remember the rule of thumb: If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. If you know German, Margot Gatzlaff-Hälsig, has continued the incomparable German tradition of Indologie with two dictionaries and numerous books on Hindi.\n\nLonely Planet Hindi & Urdu Phrasebook by Richard Delacy (Lonely Planet Publications). ISBN: 0864424256. Excellent. Rare, in that both Hindi Devanagari and Urdu Naskh are en face. Also includes glossary and cultural notes, etc. Highly recommended for travellers, and a great auxiliary source for students.\n\nTeach Yourself Beginner's Hindi Script by Rupert Snell (McGraw-Hill). ISBN: 0071419845. - An entertaining and easy to use introduction to Devanagari.\n\nTeach Yourself Beginner's Hindi by Rupert Snell (McGraw-Hill). ISBN: 0071424369. If you've never studied a language before or are a younger student this book might be where to start. Otherwise, don't waste your money and get the Complete Course instead.\n\nTeach Yourself Hindi Complete Course by Rupert Snell with Simon Weightman (McGraw-Hill). ISBN: 0071420126. By far this book is the most popular, and the usual starting point for those interested in learning Hindi. It is highly recommended that you purchase this with accompanying CD's (they are not available separately).\n\nTeach Yourself Hindi Dictionary by Rupert Snell (McGraw-Hill). ISBN: 0071435034. Companion to his other books in the Teach Yourself series. For Beginners, or younger students. Is not a complete dictionary in any sense of the word.\n\nIntroduction to Hindi Grammar by Usha R. Jain (IAS Publishers). ISBN: 094461325X. Usha R. Jain's books, which she wrote for her Hindi class at the University of California at Berkeley are more straightforward and easier to use than Snell. Her books are preferred by Hindi professors and private teachers alike throughout North America and Europe. Available with a set of accompanying CD's.\n\nIntermediate Hindi Reader by Usha R Jain (IAS Publishers). ASIN: B000739HIG. 21 readings with serial glossaries to improve the student's comprehension of Hindi and expand vocabulary. Available with accompanying CD's and/or multimedia CD-Rom.\n\nA Primer of Modern Standard Hindi by Michael C. Shapiro (Motilal Banarsidass Publishers). ISBN: 8120804759. An academic approach, by an eminent scholar of South Asia. Focuses more on written than conversational Hindi.\n\nSay It in Hindi by Veena T. Oldenburg (Dover Publications). ISBN: 0486239594. If Delacy's book lacked anything, you may find it here. Mostly due to the fact that the book focuses on Hindi only. One major flaw is that the book uses an archaic Devanagari font, which may prove difficult to some readers. Worth taking a look at, but as a supplement to other books.\n\nColloquial Hindi: A Complete Language Course by Tej K. Bhatia (Routledge). ISBN: 0415110874. Takes a different approach to teaching the language. Is more sympathetic to the average learner and doesn't go warp speed like Snell and Weightman's Teach Yourself Hindi. However; the biggest flaw is the minimal attention given to Devanagari, and the transliteration is not standard - may be more confusing than necessary to those already comfortable with the conventional style. Perhaps the best feature are the accompanying CD's.\n\nDictionaries\n\nThe Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary by R. S. McGregor (Oxford University Press). ISBN: 019864339X. Essential for the student.\n\nOxford English-Hindi Dictionary by S. K. Verma (Laurier Books Ltd). ISBN: 0195648196. Common companion to R.S. McGregor's dictionary, but somewhat lacking compared with the former.\n\nThe Modern English Hindi-Dictionary by I. N. Anand (Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers). ISBN: 8121504619. Though designed for Indians translating English, this is also a great tool for students. Includes modern and technical terms.\n\nEnglish-Hindi Dictionary by Father Camille Bulcke (French & European Publications). ISBN: 0828811318. Recommended by many professors for their students.\n\nAudio\n\nHindi by Pimsleur (Pimsleur). ISBN: 0743506251. Great for the auditory learner of for listening to in the car. Helps immerse listener into the sounds of Hindi and developing listening skills. Good overall introduction to the language, but be aware that many of the phrases are much too formal to use in common, everyday speech.\n\nTeach Yourself Hindi Conversation by Rupert Snell (McGraw-Hil). ISBN: 0071456554. Focus on spoken Hindi. Includes small reference book.\n\nSpoken Hindi by Surendra K. Gambhir (Audio-Forum). ISBN: 0884326993. Includes book.\n\nSoftware"
