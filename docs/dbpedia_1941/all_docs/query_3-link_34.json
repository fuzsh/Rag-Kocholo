T here are ups and downs in the history of a nation’s struggle for freedom as in the career of an individual. The flow of nationalism, after brilliantly irrigating human minds for a period, may be checked by some barriers, and depression may overpower the enthusiasm and fervour of the earlier days. But a nation’s soul after undergoing a process of purification through the ordeals of such years of trial helps re- kindling of the fire of patriotism, and a noble cause ultimately triumphs by surmounting even Himalayan impediments. Thus, again from 1928 rays of new light appeared on the political horizon of India to lead her on the path of progress towards her goal of freedom. Influence of new forces, external and internal : The new turn came under the influence of certain forces, external as well as internal. The International Congress against Imperialism, held at Brussels from the 10th to the 15th February, 1927, which Shri Jawaharlal Nehru attended as a representative of the Indian National Congress, passed resolutions according its “warm support to the Indian National Movement for the complete freedom of India” and expressing a hope for “the full emancipation of the peasants and workers of India.” In 2 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR the report about this Congress submitted by Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, he very significantly remarked: “I feel that whatever our internal politics might be, we cannot, in our own interests and in the interests of the rest of the world, afford to remain isolated from the great movements and forces which are shaping the future”.* The office of the All-India Congress Committee remained in constant touch during the year 1928 with the headquarters of the League against Imperialism in Berlin.* In July, 1929, Shri Shiva Prasad Gupta attended the Second World Congress of the League against Imperialism at Frankfurt on behalf of the Indian National Congress.*' From the outside world, India also felt the impact of Socialist and Communist ideas and of factors like the wide-spread economic depression from 1929, the formation of the I.,abour Government in England and also its fall in 1931. In fact, the year 1930-31 was marked by highly exciting events like the constitutional crisis in England, the occupation of Man- churia by Japan, the rise of totalitarian dictatorships in Ger- many and Italy, and the revolution in Spain resulting in the establishment of a Republic. Humanity was also still feel- ing acutely the effects of the poignant economic legacies of World War I and there was world-wide economic de}>ression. The year, in the opinion of Dr. Arnold Toynbee, was Annus terriblis\". In India, as we shall see, 1930 was a very eventful year. The Simon Commission and agitation against it : Within our country, some new factors served to influence the course of its politics from 1928. Manipulation of the country’s currency by the Government to its own interest and a measure of Sir Basil Blackett, Finance Member of the Government of India, stabilising the rupees at Is. 6d., two pence higher than the traditional exchange ratio, evoked opposition in certain circles.\" The Government’s deci- sion on the Skeen Committee’s Report, published in April, 1.

A NEW TURN 1928-29 3 1927, providing a plan for full ludianisation of one-half of the cadre of the Indian Army in twenty-live years, was re- garded by some as an anti-national scheme. The publica- tion in England of Miss Catharine Adayo’s Alother India in early summer of 1927 shocked the whole country, as it con- tained an untrue, biased and damaging picture of Indian life. The Press in India strongly denounced it, and there was agitation against it on public platforms. The most slashing comment on it was made by Mahatma Gandhi, who describ- ed it as a ‘‘Drain Inspector’s Re]3ort'’.^ It was widely believed that Miss Alayo had been subsidised t(3 write this work in order to degrade India in the eyes of the ^vorld and tluis to prejudice hei' case for seir-government. During the Autumn session of the Assembly in 1927, the Home Alcmber of tlie Ciovernment of India was “subjected to a rain of ques- tions” regarding this book and lie pleaded in reply tliat “the Government of India and the India OlTicc had absolutely no connection with the production of the book and had extended to the writer no greater facilities than one usually extended to students of social, economic, political and other subjects, whether Indians or foreigners, wlio can present satisfactory credentials.” ^ Lastly (ame the simultaneous announce- ment by the British Parliament and His Excellency Lord Irwin, Viceroy of India, on the 8th November, 1927, of the appointment of the Statutory Commission on Constitutional Reforms. The Commission was to be presided over by a famous constitutional lawyer. Sir John Simon, and to be as- sisted by six other members. Idie Conservative Party was represented by two members of the House of Lords, Viscount Burnliam and Lord Strcithcona and two members of the House of Commons, the Hon’ble E.C.G. Cadogau and Colonel G.R. Lane-Fox. The Labour Party, then His Majesty’s Opposition\", was represented by Major C.R. Attlee, and Mr. Stephen Walsh who being unable to act was replaced by Air.

India in 1927-28^ pp. 3-4. 4 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR The exclusion of the Indians from the personnel of a Com- mission, formed to enquire into the working of the Montagu- Ghclmsford Reforms and to make recommendations for the future constitutional status of their country, naturally caused country-wide resentment and evoked “universal condemna- tion” from organisations representing varied shades of opinion “as a negation of the fundamental right of self-determination which is inherent in every nation”.’ On the 16th November, 1927, was announced the Leaders’ Manifesto bearing signatures of prominent leaders of all parties, including those of Sir Ali Imam, Shri Sachchidananda Sinha and Nawab Ismail Khan from Bihar. The Manifesto stated; “VVe have come to the deliberate conclusion that the exclusion of Indians from the Commission is fundamentally wrong, and that the proposals about Committees of Legislatures being allowed to submit their views to the Commission, and later to confer with the Joint Parliamentary Committee, are wholly inadequate to meet the requirements of the case. The underlying principle of the scheme, that Indians are to have no authoritative voice cither in the collection of proper materials and evidence or in the taking of decisions by way of recommendations of the Commission to Parliament, is of such a character that India cannot, with any self-respect, acquiesce in it. Unless a com- mission on which the British and Indian statesmen are invited to sit on equal terms is set up we cannot conscientiously take any part or share in the work of the Commission as at present constituted”.* Protest and decision of the Indian National Congress to boycott it : The Indian National Congress had already expressed an emphatic protest. Its Working Committee adopted the following resolution by circulation: “As the British Govern- ment has constituted the Statutory Commission in defiance of the national will and rejected the national demand for a Round Table Conference to settle a Swaraj constitution for India, the Working Committee of the Congress calls upon the people of India and appeals to all political parties to 1 .

A NEW TURN 1928-29 5 abstain from co-operating with the said Commission either by giving evidence or by voting for or serving on any Select Committee connected therewith.” In a Manifesto, issued to the Press on the 16th November, Mr. S. Srinivasa Iyengar, President of the Indian National Congress, obser\\'ed: “Immediate action of an unqualified character is indicated as the only fitting reply to the insolent and deliberate challenge which the British Government has hurled in the face of the Indian people and of all patriotic leaders.”* The Indian National Congress, meeting at its fortysecond session at Madras in December, 1927, resolved that “the only self-respecting course for India to adopt is to boycott the Commission at every stage and in every form.” In his Presidential Address at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congre.ss, held in December, 1928, Pandit Motilal Nehru exprc.ssed: “The solemn promises of responsible Government have found fulfilment in that colossal fraud, the Statutory Commission, which is now careering along our streets leaving bleeding heads and broken bones behind.” All Parties Conference in Bihar under the Presidentship of Sir Ali Imam decided to boycott it : The country’s mandate with regard to the attitude to- wards the Indian Statutory Commission was followed by Bihar with profound courage, earnestness and fidelity. A Conference, attended by men of all parties, was held at Patna under the Presidentship of Sir Ali Imam, and boycott of the Simon Commission was decided upon here. There had been already much excitement in Bihar due to the supersession of the Gaya District Board by the Government and the re- moval of a leading nationalist, Shri Anugraha Narayan Sinha, from its Chairmanship. Shri Rajendra Prasad had visited Gaya and addressed a meeting there denouncing in strong terms the action of the Bihar Government in relation to the Gaya District Board. He held that due enquiries had been made on behalf of the Congress into the charges levelled against the latter and these were found to be baseless. 1. Ibid, p. 100. b FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR On the 7th March, 1929, Shri Shrikrishna Sinha, leader of the Congress Party, moved a resolution in the Bihar and Orissa Legislative Council disapproving of the policy of Hon’ble Sir Ganeslt Datta Singh, Minister for the I^ocal Self- Government, ‘‘in superseding the Gaya District Board”. “I say it with a full sense of responsibility”, observ^ed the mover in the course of his speech, “that the llon’ble Sir Ganesh Datta Singh has, in sujjcrseding the District Board, abused his powers as Minister given to him by the statute so as not to further the ends or advance the wellbeing of tlie people of Gaya District but to feed fat a personal grudge he bears to- wards the Chairman of' the superseded Board, and in so doing he has not only de]>ri\\^ed the people of the whole District of the right they undoubtedly possess of governing the alTairs to the limited extent allowed by the Lrxal Self-Ciovernment Act but also set a precedent which is dangcaous to a degree and which puts a premium on the irresponsibility of the Minister.” In supporting this motion on the next day Shri Ram Charitra Singh said that the su])ersession of the Board had been ordered on insulTicient grounds. In the meanwhile, after the Gaya meeting, referred to above, it had been decided by the leaders to hold a session of the Bihar Provincial Conference at Patna. So this Con- ference met at Patna on the 9th Decern bei', 1928, a few days before the arrival of the Simon Commission there. ^ Shri Anugraha Narayan Sinha was its President and Shri Sach- chidananda Sinha was Chairman of the Reception Committee. Referring to the case of tfie Ciaya District Board, Shri Sach- chidananda Sinha observed in his welcome speech: “The Ministry has no case on merit and the siipei\\scssion could be justly characterised as a high-handed abuse of power in- spired obviously by ulterior considerations.” This Conference was largely attended by delegates from all parts of the Pro- vince and was so timed as to contribute very much to the success of the anti-Simon Commission demonstrations. When this Commission reached Patna on the 12th December, 1928, most of those who came to attend the Conference from 1 . The Indian QitarterJy Register^ 1928, Vol, //, pp. 441-42. A NEW TURN 1928-29 7 different districts participated in the demonstrations against it. Thus the Patna demonstration against tlie Simon Com- mission “was a demonstration on behalf of the Province as a whole.”* About 30,000 people, in their enthusiasm to express their feelings against the unwanted Commission, assembled in the colcl morning of the month of December in front of the special platform opposite the Hardinge Park. They cried “Go back Simon” and also showed black flags. Thousands of them had been waiting near the platform even from 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning. The entire demonstra- tion was orderly, there being no untoward incidents as in some other parts (Madras, Calcutta, U.P. and Lahore), where even great personalities like Lala Lajpat Rai,** Shi'i Jawaharlal Nehru and Shri Govind Ballabh Pant had I'eceived very rough treatment at the hands of the police.* “The attempt to make a counter-show by arranging a recep- tion fell flat on account of the very arrangement made by the authorities to separate on one side of the road those who had assembled to welcome the Commission from those on the other side who had assembled to demonstrate against it. It was a sight to see a few stragglers, many of them liveried servants of Zamindars and rich men, ready to offer their welcome to the Commission in striking contrast to the vast mass of humanity shouting its slogans.”* Some members of the Commission went to Dumraon for a day as guests of the local Maharaja. A demonstration was organised there against them on the morning of the day of their arrival.* The Commission left Patna on the 19th December for Calcutta, some members of it visiting en route Ranchi and others the Jharia coal-fields.* At a meeting of the citizens of Ranchi, held already on the 18th December, 1927, under the Presidentship of Shri S.K. Sahay, a resolution had been 1 . Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Mahatma Gandhi and Bihar, p. 70. 2. Lala Lajpat Rai died on the 17th November, some days after the assault suffering from its after effects. 3.

C. Mitra, and many Tana Bhagats coming from different parts of Chotanagpur, joined in de- monstration against it and showed black flags.’’ On the 27th December, 1928, Dr. P. C. Mitra and some others, along with about 150 Tana Bhagats, left Ranchi to attend the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress. All Parties Conference {1928 ), — The Nehru Report : Boycott of the Simon Commission was a clear manifesta- tion of India’s strong determination against the imposition of a body of aliens for recommendation on the shape and nature of her future constitution, with which was indeed vitally connected her national destiny. It was also necessary to convince others of India’s competence to frame her con- stitution.^ On this constructive side too the country proceeded to take steps by formulating an Indian scheme of constitution with the co-operation of the moderate groups of the Congress. At its Madras session (December, 1927), the Congress had authorised the Working Committee to draft a Swaraj Constitution for India in consultation with the other organisations of the country. A meeting of the All Parties Conference, held at Bombay on the 19th May, 1928, appointed a committee for this purpose with Pandit Motilal Nehru as its Chairman. The Nehru Committee produced a report recommending therein Dominion Status as the basis of the Indian Constitution. It was not in favour of separate elec- torates but recommended that elections should be by joint or mixed electorates, the only communal safeguard being 1 .

Published in August, 1928, the Nehru report was considered at a meeting of the All Parties Conference held at Lucknow on the 28th and 29th of that month. Sir Ali Imam attended this meeting along with several other prorninent members of the Committee. This Conference accepted the Nehru Report with certain amendments. But the Muslim League repudiated it. In the Congress circle also an opposition to the Dominion Status ideal was led by Shri Jawaliarlal Nehru, Shri Subhas Chandra Bose and Shri Srinivasa lyenger, who stood for complete independence and formed immediately the Independence for India League to serve its cause. At the first meeting of the Independence for India League, held at Delhi on the 3rd November, 1928, a provisional central council of 20 members was formed to help organisation of its work in the respective Provinces. From Bihar, Maulana Abdul Bari became its member. ‘ Resolution of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta : This did not however mean a split in the Congress. Under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi, who had re-entered the field of politics, the Calcutta session of the Congress meeting from 29th December, 1928, passed the following resolution on Dominion Status issue: — “This Congress, having considered the Constitution re- commended by the All Parties Committee Report, welcomes it as a great contribution towards the solution of India’s political and communal problems and congratulates the Committee on the virtual unanimity of its recommendations and, whilst adhering to the resolution relating to complete independence passed at the Madras Congress, approves of the Constitution drawn up by the Committee as a great step in political advance, specially as it represents the largest measure of agreement attained among the important parties in the country. Subject to the exigencies of the political situation, this Congress will adopt the Constitution if it is accepted in 1 . The Indian Quarterly Register, 1928, Vol. I, p. 513. 10 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR its entirety by the British Parliament on or before the 31st December, 1929; but in the event of its non-acceptance by that date or its earlier rejection, the Congress will organise a campaign of non-violent non-co-operation by advising the country to refuse taxation and in such other manner as may be decided upon. Consistently with the above, nothing in this Resolution shall interfere with the carrying on, in the name of the Con- gress, of the propaganda for complete independence.” Thus from 1928-29 there was again a new impulse through the country expressing itself in various forms. A successful Satyagraha movement and no-rent campaign had been or- ganised by the peasantry of Bardoli Taluq in Surat district under the able leadership of Shri Vallabhbhai Patel; Shri Jawaharlal Nehru and Shri Subhas Chandra Bose were working for complete independence; Communist workers’ and peasants’ Associations had sprung up at x'arious places and strikes of the labourers had taken place at some import- ant industrial centres. “Nineteen twenty eight had been full of labour disputes and strikes; nineteen twenty-nine carried on likewise”. ‘ The lead in these strikes was taken by Bombay Textile Labour, “miseralde and militant”.* There was a big strike in the Bengal Jute Mills. Congress resolution on conslructive programme : The Congress at its Calcutta session also passed a resolution outlining future programme of constructive works for Congress- men, in the legislatures and outside. Such w orks were prohibit- ion of drinks and intoxicating drugs, boycott of foreign cloth by advancing and stimvdating production of handspun and hand- woven khaddar, strengthening of the Congress organisation by enlisting members and enforcing stricter discipline, eradication of social abuses and encouragement to women to take their due share in national upbuilding, rcmov^al of untouchability and various disablitics of the so-called untouchables and work among the city labourers and village reconstruction. 1. Nehru, Autobiography, p. 187. 2. Ibid. A NEW TURN 1928-29 11 “It is only by constructive programme that the revival of non-co-operation is possible,” said Mahatma Gandhi, and he wanted to make the year following this session of the Congress a “year of probation and preparation.” Work in Bihar, — activities of the Hindustani Seva Dal : To give effect to this resolution, the Bihar Provincial Congress Committee, immediately after the Calcutta session had been over, addressed all the District Congress Committees, among other matters, on the ncctl of enrolling a huge number of Congress members, and strengthening the Congress organisat- ions where these already existed and starting new ones where they did not. This matter was not taken up seriously except by a very few of the District Congress Committees. But after the penal resolution' of the A. I. (kC., passed at its Bombay meetings on the 24th and 25tli May, 1929, all the districts began to make strenuous efforts to fulfil the quota of member- ship on the date fixed by the All India Congress Committee (31st August). The result was tliat Bihar was able to enroll above 80,000 members by that time whereas its cpiola was for 72,558 members. By the end of 1929 there were 90,525 Con- gress members in this Province.\" 1. “Provincial Congress Committees shall have (i) not less tlian one cjuarter percent of' the total population of their Province as original members.

Bihar Provincial Congress Committee's Annual Report, 1928-29. 12 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR The organised districts of this Province had their Sub- divisional or Thana Committees, from which they elected representatives to their district. The district of Champaran was first in the matter of organisation as it had village com- mittees also in some of the Thanas. The second place was that of Darbhanga, which could enroll about double its quota in a fortniglit only. Some of the other districts tried to orgainse village committees but with no success. There was some relaxation in the rigour of untouchability. Children of the so-called untouchables were admitted into schools. Generally they were getting access to the wells, and number of men were ceasing to have any objection to water and even food being touched by them. The follow- ing incidents may be noted in this connection; — {a) A Dusadh arranged Satyanarayan Katha at Patna and some respectable gentlemen of other castes took sweets on this occasion. {b) At Motihari a Chamar joined a Katchi dinner, arranged in tlie house of a Kalwar, with men of Brahman, Bhumihar Brahman, Rajput, Kayastha and some other castes. (c) At the Arya Samaj anniversary at Dinapur, where Shri Rajcndra Prasad presided and Raja Saheb of Kalakan- kar as well as the Kumar Saheb of Amethi were present, Brah- mans and Sudras of both the sexes took water from a Dome (sweeper).* Some people in Champaran and Muzaffarpur also organised inter-caste dinners.'* The Province of Bihar had its own Provincial Board to control and carry on the activities of the Hindustani Seva Dal, affiliated to the Congress. This Board consisted of Shri Kumar Ganganand Singh, Shri Kumar Kalika Singh, Acharya Badrinath Varma, Shri Mathura Prasad, Shri Bipin Behari Varma, Prof. Jnan Saha (Secretary), Shri Jimut Bahan Sen, and Prof. Abdul Bari. The Board was able to secure the services of Shri Ranen- dra Nath Roy Ghowdhury and Shri Kishori Prasanna Sinha, 1 . Bihar Provincial Congress Committee's Annual Report, 1928-1929. 2 . Ibid. A NEW TURN 1928-29 13 who were working with single-minded devotion. A Trainers’ training camp was opened in August, 1929, at the Sadaqat Ashramy Patna. Seventeen volunteers received training here for one month, and most of them thereafter devoted them- selves to training volunteers in their respectiv'e districts. Ele- ven camps were since then opened at Gogri, Monghyr, Kharagpur and Gorwadih in the district of Monghyr; Bettiah, Myanaten, Nawalpur and Malahi in the district of Champaran, Sitamarhi in the district of Muzafl'arpur, and at Arrah and Patna towns, and 200 volunteers were trained there. Services of the volunteers of the Hindustani Seva Dal were utilised for a session of the Provincial Political Conference at Monghyr in December, 1929. Composition of the B.P.C.C. : The Bihar Provincial Congress Committee was composed of the following members during the year 192B-29: — President: Shri Anugraha Narayan Sinha. Vice-Presidents: (1) Shri Braj Kishore Prasad. (2) Shri Deep Narayan Sinha. (3) Hon’blc Shah Muhammad Zubair. Secretaries: Shri Rajcndra Prasad Shri Shrikrishna Sinha. Assistant Secretaries: Prof. Abdul Bari. Shri Binoda Nand Jha. Treasurer: Shri Sarangdhar Sinha. In addition to the above-mentioned members, the Work- ing Committee was composed of the following: — (1) Shri Ram Dayalu Sinha (2) Acharya Badrinath Varma (3) Dr. Syed Mahmud. (4) Shri Bepin Behari Varma (5) Shri Krishna Ballabh Sahay Formation of Foreign Cloth Boycott Committee : According to a resolution of the meeting of the Working Committee of the Congress, held in Calcutta on the 3rd Jan- 14 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR uary, 1929, Mahatma Gandhi prepared a scheme for the boycott of foreign cloth through khadi. Meeting at Delhi on the 17th and 19th February, 1929, the Working Committee adopted this scheme, the chief features of which were as fol- lows: — (1) “Congress organisations should call for volunteers, men and women, to go from door to door in every town and village having a Congress Committee and collect foreign cloth in the possession of the house- holders and deliver or receive orders for khadi re- (piired by such houselioldei s. (2) All khadi so supplied should bear the stamp of the All-India Spinners’ Association and prices should be distinctly marked on them. (3) Voluntary preat hers should be called for to popu- larise the use (A' khadi and to adv'ocate complete boy- cott ol' (iintign cloth. (4) Foreign (loth collected should be publicly burnt wherever po.ssible. (5) Foreign cloth dealers should be individually visited with a view to enlisting their help and inducing them to stop further purchase of foreign cloth and to caitcel all cancellable orders. (6) Picketting foreign cloth shojis may be undertaken wherever possible and wliere there is no danger of violence being committed by CongKcss pickets, the latter being reliable and seasoned volunteers. (12) Resolutions should be moved in the Provincial Legis- latures as well as the Central, calling upon their respective Covernments to make all their cloth pur- chases in khadi irrespective of its so-called costliness. Resolutions should also be moved demanding a prohi- bitive duty on imports of foreign cloth.” According to another resolution, a Foreign Cloth Boycott Committee was formed consisting of Mahatma Candhi (Chair- man), Pandit Motilal Nehru, Pandit Madan Mohan Mala- viya, Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad, Dr. M.A. Ansari and A NEW TURN 1928-29 15 Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, with power to co-opt. It was entrusted with the work of publishing and distributing propaganda leaf- lets showing the necessity and possibility of boycott. The Working Committee further resolved that “On Sunday, March 17, and thereafter on the 1st Sunday of every month special attention should be paid to the propaganda for the boycott of foreign cloth and khadi should be hawked.” CAoth boycott activities in Bihar : Mahatma Gandhi arranged a cloth burning demonstra- tion in Calcutta on the 4th Miirch, 1929, for which he was subject to prosecution and fine of one rupee. Tliis fine was paid by someone without his knowledge. In liihar the Sun- day programme regarding the boycott of foreigti cloth was well observed; meetings were held aiid foreign cloth was publicly burnt. In well organised districts the volunteers carried on successful propaganda through private discourses, public lectures and in some cases by magic lantern lectures. An efl'ective method of propaganda was to secure signatures on forms containing the pledge on the part of the signatories that they woidd not purchase any foreign cloth thenceforward cither for their personal use or for the use of their dependants. To facilitate this work, Shri Rajcndra Prasad suggested a scheme that workers in each district should distribute them- selves in respective areas and should thus try to visit every home in each area. He personally addressed the workers of four districts, Saran, Champaran, Darbhanga and Bhagalpur. He could not address the workers of the other districts due to some pressing engagements. But practically nothing was done to “carry the message of the boycott among the dealers of foreign cloth.’” Special afforts were made to push up both production and sale of khaddar. Some new centres of production were opened and the old ones were developed. Among the new centres opened special mention may be made of Kishungunj in Purnea and Amarpur in Bhagalpur for their showing good results. 1 . Bihar Provincial Congress Committee's Annual Report, 1928-29. 16 FREEDOM movement IN BtHAR On the 4th October, 1928, met the twenty-first session of the Bihari Students’ Conference at Motihari in the Heycock Academy amidst scenes of great enthusiasm. In the un- avoidable absence of Prof. Vaswani, the President-elect, owing to illness, Shri Rajendra Prasad read his Address. He observed in this Address: “Be strong ! — is my earnest appeal to the nation’s youth. Inheritors of an ancient past, posses- sors, too, of the rich revelations of modern science, you are called to be creators of a mighty future. Behold the highways of the East arc covered with ruins of the past! Behold I the highways of the West are strewn with ruins of the present — - rums of the world-war which has been an inevitable result of a cruel industrialism, an aggressive, unspiritual nationalism. India and Asia and the West ask for men and women of the New Spirit- —ask for new creators, for them that would build a new brotherly Civilisation — a new Divine Humanity.’” Labour strike at Jamshedpur (1928) and at Golmuri : During the year 1928 there was a serious strike in the Tata Iron and Steel Works at Jamshedpur resulting in their almost complete closure from the 1st June to the 12th Sep- tember, 1928, due chiefly to the management’s policy of reduc- ing the stall'. The workers had lost their old confidence in the Labour Associatioii, and even the cflbrts of Rev. C.F. Andrews during his few days’ stay at Jamshedpur to bring matters to a settlement through negotiations with the Company did not prove successful. The control of affairs regarding the strike had passed into the hands of Shri Manek Homi, a Parsee pleader practising at Jamshedpur and an ex-employee of the Company. There was no improvement in the situation even after the arrival of Shri N.M. Joshi and Shri Jamnadas Mehta at Jamshedpur. Ultimately Shri Subhas Chandra Bose came came to the scene on the 18th August. After prolonged discussions with the Directors and the General Manager he helped to effect a settlement, which was accepted by the strikers, who resumed work on the 13th September, 1928. Thus “ended a strike which was chiefly remarkable for its 1 . The Indian Quarterly Register, 1928, Vol. II, p. 463. A NEW TURN 1928«29 17 freedom from violence.”* Shri Homi proceeded to give a permanent character to his newly started organisation called Jamshedpur Labour Federation, which after a few months the Company consented to recognise. There was a strike in the next year among the workers of the Tinplate Company at Golmuri, a suburb of Jamshedpur. At the request of the strikers, Shri Subhas Chandra Bose came there also and he invited Shri Rajendra Prasad to the spot. Shri Rajendra Prasad went there several times along with Prof. Abdul Bari, Shri Mathura Prasad, Shri Ramnarayan Sinha, Shri Bepin Behari Varma, and Shri Krishna Vallabh Sahay also visited the strike area.* The strike involved 3,000 workers, mostly skilled, and it continued for several months. On the 6th September, 1929, Shri Shrikrishna Sinha, then leader of the Swaraj Party in the Bihar and Orissa Legislative Council, moved an adjournment in the House to discuss the situation arising out of the Tinplate strike in Gol- muri. He enumerated the grievances of the strikers, viz. low scales of wages, insufficient housing accommodation, and absence of bonus, provident fund scheme, maternity benefit and other benefit service rules. He strongly urged the ap- pointment of a Conciliation Boai'd. The strikers were will- ing to resume work if the management were prepared to stop victimisation and reinstate all who were dismissed before and during the strike and appointed an impartial committee to enquire into their grievances. The adjournment motion was carried by 41 to 39 votes. The demands of the strikers were moderate, but neither the employers nor the Government paid any heed to these. The Government even refused to set up a council of encjuiries. On the 24th September the Legislative Assembly censured this attitude of the Government and passed a resolution (moved by Pandit Nilkanta Das) for withdrawing the protection given to the Tinplate industry. But the Government ignored this resolution.* The Gol- 1. Bihar and Orissa in 1928-29, pp. 5-6. 2. Bihar Provincial Congress Committee's Annual Report, 1928- J 929. 3.

The Committee notes with satisfaction the stand taken up by the members of the Assembly recommending the withdrawal of protection granted to the Tinplate Industry.” All-India Trade Union Congress at Jharia : A few days before the Calcutta session of the Congress, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru attended a session of the All-India Trade Union Congress at Jharia in the coal-mine area for its first two days. This meeting was marked by a tussle between the moderate group and the radical group in the T.U.C. But in the annual election of the T.U.C, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru was elected President for the next year.' On the second day of the Congress meeting in Calcutta there was a demon- stration in the Congress pandal by about 20,000 workers and peasants of Lilloah workshop and Bihar Kishan Sabha. Shri Jawaharlal Nehru and some others controlled the situation and addressed them. Pandit Motilal Nehru, President of the Congress, also expressed his sympathy with them. The labourers came outside on hearing that Mahatma Gandhi was waiting for them. He addressed them when they came out. They passed a resolution to the following effect: “The mass meeting of the workers and peasants from all industries declare that we, the workers and peasants of the land, shall not rest content till complete independence is established and all exploitation from capitalism and Imperialism cease. We 1. Nehru, Autobiography, p. 187. A NEW TURN 1928-29 19 do call u|K)n the National Congress to keep that goal before them and organise the national forces for that purpose.”* Leftist ideas inf luencing formation of Youth Leagues: There is no doubt that Leftist ideas were influencing Indian minds in certain quarters, particularly the student community, who besides organising their own conferences also mainly formed the Youth Leagues. At the meetings of the All-India Youth Congress and the Socialist Youth Congress, held in Calcutta, on the 25th and 27th December, 1928, respectively,* national leaders like Shri Jawaharlal Nehru and Shii Subhas Chandra Bose, with leaning* to- wards such ideas, figured prominently. Utopian socialism and Marxism, and countries like Russia, China, and Turkey had then strong appeals to the youths of India. “This tendency was strengthened in India, as in Europe and America, by developments in the Soviet Union, and particularly the Five Year Plan.”* It should also be understood that the funda- mental cause for unrest in the labour would lay in the ex- tremely hard lot of the workers in the disturbed economic situation in the country during the post-war years. Government fearful of Russian aid for spread of Communism : The menace of Russian communism very much haunted the imagination of the Government of India and they took various steps to prevent its infiltration into India.® Thus, in the month of May, 1928, the Government of Bihar and Orissa “received a telegram from the Government of India asking the local Government to give information, in detail, by ‘clear the line’ telegram, of any information, that may be received as to the remittance of money from Russian sources to persons in India in aid of industrial disputes subversive propaganda.” The Government of India further desired that “communications of any description authorising or I .

They were also watchful about any movement “on the part of Congress Party to utilise labour for political ends” as the Government of India desired “specially to be informed of such developments.”^ Arrest of Labour leaders on suspicion: The new developments of the Labour Movement in India were also considered by the Government to be objectionable, and they took drastic steps to counteract their influence. On the 20th March, 1929, they “struck suddenly at organised labour by arresting some of its most prominent workers from the advanced groups,”* including the leaders of the Bombay Gimi Kamgar Union as well as labour leaders from the Pun- jab, U.P. and Bengal. Some of them were communists, some “were near-communists, yet others were just trade unionists.”* Thirtyone persons were arrested on a charge of conspiracy to “deprive His Majesty of his sovereignty of British India,” and they were brought to Meerut where their trial began in what came to be known as the Meerut Conspiracy Case. Commenting on the situation, Mahatma Gandhi observed: “The arrests of labour leaders or so-called communists show that Government is in a panicky state and is betraying the symptoms to which we have been used and which presage a period of terrorism. Evidently it believes in a periodical exhibition of its capacity to supersede all law and to discover to a trembling India the red claws which usually remain under cover. Of course, the farce of a trial will be enacted. If the accused are wise, they will not run into the trap and assist the farce by being represented by counsel. But they will boldly 1 . Letter from H.

Presently, it will be the turn of thousands not merely to risk but to face and court imprisonment, if this reign of lawlessness under the guise of law is to be ended once for all.”‘ Governmental repression was in full swing. A large number of youngmen were being tried on various charges in what was known as the Lahore Conspiracy Case. In Bengal an Ordinance was issued authorising arrests and detention of persons in jail without trial on suspicion. Shri Subhas Chandra Bose, and several other prominent Congressmen, were being tried on the flimsiest grounds. To add to these, other methods of repression, described by the All-India Congress Committee as “barbarous”,* were used by the Government. Rigorous measures against the Press; ban on exhibitions: Proscription of some books, said to be seditious by the Government, and rigorous measures against the Press, were also marked features of the year 1929. Sliri Ramanand Ghatterjee, the eminent editor of the Modern Review, was tried for sedition in publishing Dr. J. T. Sunderland’s India in Bondage and sentenced to pay a heavy fine. This book and Dr. Sundarlal’s History of British Rule in India written in Hindi, were proscribed. In Bihar, the Searchlight, the Tarun Shakti of Chaibasa and the Mukti of Purulia, became the special targets of Government attack. The Editor of the Searchlight, Shri Murli Manohar Prasad, a nationalist of indomitable spirit, was arraigned by the Patna High Court for contempt of Court in criticising the judgement of its Chief Justice, Sri Courteney Terrel, in the Barh Sati case, and was fined Rs. 500/-. The Searchlight Case caused much sensation in the Province, and eminent lawyers like Pandit Motilal Nehru, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Shri Sarat Chandra Bose argued in it.® The Editor of the Mukti, Shri Nibaran Chandra Das Gupta, a patriot of saintly char- acter, and its Printer and Publisher, were prosecuted under 1.

Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Atmakatha, p. 300. 22 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR section 124A of tlie Indian Penal Code and sentenced to one year’s and three months’ simple imprisonment respectively. The Editor, Printer and Keeper of the Press of the Tarun Shakti were prosecuted under sections 124A and 153A; the Editor was sentenced to six months’ simple imprisonment and the two others to three months’ simple imprisonment each. Further, the appeal of the Editor of the Mahabir, who had been sentenced in March, 1928, to one year’s simple imprison- ment and a fine of Rs. 1000 under section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, was dismissed by the High Court in July, 1928. It may be also noted that Shri Manindra Narayan Roy, the zealous Secretary of Patna Town Congress Committee, was convicted and sentenced to two years’ rigorous imprisonment. The large exhibitions, organised by the Indian National Congress at their amiual sessions at Madras in 1927 and at Calcutta in 1928, were not liked by the Government. The Crovernment of India addressed a letter on the 26th April, 1929, to all Provincial Governments mentioning therein that “in view of the declaration of policy recently made by the Congress and the extreme political programme which it has adopted,” Grovernment of India considered “it undesirable” that exhibitions oi lairs organised under the auspices of the Indian National Congress “should receive the support or co- operation of Departments or officials of Government in any way.” The Government of Bihar and Orissa forwarded a copy of this order to all District officers for proper action ac- cording to it. An additional force was stationed within the jurisdiction of Siwan, Barharia, Basantpur and Maharajgunj police stations in the district of Saran. Observance of Political Sufferers' Day; meetings held in protest all over Bihar : Bihar observed the Political Sufferers’ Day on the 10th August, 1929. To celebrate it at Patna, a procession, led by Shri Rajendra Prasad, started this day at about 3-30 p. m. It included a large number of students and many of those, who had joined it, carried National Flags. At the meeting, arranged at Gulzarbagh, Prof. Abdul Bari proposed Shri Rajendra Prasad to the Chair and it was seconded by Shri Baladev Sahay. With sincere convictions of a noble patriot, A NEW TURN 1928-29 23 Shri Rajendra Prasad delivered a highly impressive speech exhorting the audience to imbibe and develop the spirit of self-sacrifice as an indispensably needed means for the attain- ment of freedom. He referred to the sufferings of the political prisoners under inhuman tortures in the jails and to the virul- ence and rigours of the jail rules in India as compared with those of England. “In England,” he observed, “conspiracy and sedition could really be counted as crimes as England was a free country. But in India, which was under the yoke of a foreign Government, sedition was but duty and religion. It was the duty of every body here to be seditious. By the irony of fate patriotism had come to be branded as crime in India, but in England- it was a virtue.” He reminded the audience about the sacredness of the National Flag, asking them to be always ready to safeguard its honour whatever might be the risks. After the National Flag had been unfurled, Shri Pratul Chandra Ganguly of Bengal, who had that day come from Banaras for this meeting, delivered a short speech. Shri Rajendra Prasad had to leave this meeting before it was over for Patna City, where he was required to address another meeting. Acharya Badrinath Varma then took the Chair. A resolution praising the courage and bravery of the Punjab hunger strikers and condemning Government for not conced- ing to their just demands was moved by Prof. Abdul Bari and seconded by Shri Jaichand Vidyalankar. * Similar meet- ings and processions were organised in the other districts of Bihar. Plan to check Congress influence in Santal Paraganas : In the district of Santal Parganas, which was a non-regula- tion area, and in the Damin portion of which there weic no regular ix)lice establishments, the Government wanted to be armed with stronger powers to deal with a situation, marked by the influence of nationalist ideas and the spirit of social reform through the efforts of a prominent local Congress leader, Shri Lambodar Mukherjee. Contemplating the neces- sity of taking action without delay against such persons, as were, from Government jjoint of view, “preachers of sedition. 1 . Police report, dated 1 8-8-30. 24 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR especially in a district such as Santal Paraganas,” its Deputy Commissioner, Mr. E. S. Hoernle enquired of Mr. M.G. Hallett, then Commissioner of Bhagalpur, “whether in the case of a person preaching sedition it would be legitimate for District Magistrate to take action against him and have him arrested pending the investigation of the offences and prior to obtaining sanction of the Local Government which would be required under section 106 Gr. P. C.”* Mr. Hoernle wrote as follows: — -“In aboriginal districts, and especially in a dis- trict where there are no police tracts, we are singularly handi- capped in obtaining precise and reliable reports of speeches such as would justify the institution of proceedings under the penal code. There may be no responsible officer at hand to report; there may be no one who understands the language of the speech sufficiently well to record it in detail or to face an expert cross-examination on the accuracy of his record. Furthermore it is easy to arouse unrest among aboriginals by .speeches which it would be difficult to define, in respect of any particular part, as seditious or even designed to rouse hostility against any special class of the community, although the speaker’s intention and its result may be perfectly clear. What we require is some power to stop his .speaking. Now section 108 does prima facie give vei-y wide powers. In order to justify action under it a Magistrate has only to have in- formation that a person is orally or in writing attempting to disseminate objectionable matter. It is a section under which the said penson is only called on to show cause and it may be that an apology and a warning will settle the matter. But it is useless in the case of travelling speakers who are here today and gone tomorrow unless some one can get hold of them at once. The question that then arises is, Does section 60 Cr. P.C. override section 114 Cr. P.C.? If it does I think a Magistrate would in the circumstances be perfectly entitled to issue a warrant in the first instance on the ground that a person of the type referred to is not likely to obey a mere summons.” _ 1 . Letter from M. G. Hallett, Commissioner of Bhagalpur, to H, K. Briscoe, Chief Secret arj>, 6th November, 1929- A NEW TURN 1928-29 25 Mr. Hoemle also raised another point: — “These itinerant speakers take with them stocks of litera- ture and sometimes pictures or even lantern slides (as in the case of Lambodar Mukherjee). We really ought to be able to seize these with a view to ascertaining whether they form material for a prosecution under section 153 I.P.C. or cognate sections. If I understand Briscoe’s view correctly it is that no action can be taken until Government sanction has been received. We are then working in a vicious circle. We can- not apply for Government to proceed because we have not got the material. We cannot obtain the material because we have not got Government sanction. It does not seem to me that section 108 Cr. P.C. empowers us to take action for such confiscation even if the question regarding the issue of a personal warrant of arrest in the first instance is decided in my favour. In my view the sanction of the local Government is recjuired before a man can be actually placed on trial for offences against the State, but it is not required for preliminary inquiries necessary for decision whether an application should be made to Government for sanction. Is it really the position that, if I have certain information that a man is distributing seditious pamphlets, I cannot arrest him or seize them until the matter has been referred to Government ?” The Commissioner of Bhagalpur was entirely in agree- ment with Mr. Hoernle that immediate action to stop sedi- tious pi'opaganda was “essential in the Santal Parganas” and that it was “necessary to have some power to stop the delivery of such speeches and to control the spread of sedition by means of pamphlets, lantern slides, pictures etc.”' Requesting the Chief Secretary to refer certain points for legal opinion to the Legal Remembrancer, Mr. J. A. Sweeney, he observed: “I trust you will not object to taking up these points on the ground that the political situation has changed by recent events. I am not sufficiently optimistic to hope for a per- manent change for the better and we may well have to meet a more .serious agitation. Forewarned is forearmed and we should be prepared.” 1 . Ibid. 26 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR Government repression and revolutionary nationalism: In fact widespread repression on the part of the Government was now very much responsible for reappearance of Revolu- tionary Nationalism in India on the suspension of the Non- co-operation Movement. Exasperated youths, stirred to the very depths of their hearts by feelings of patriotism, resorted to revolutionary methods with the conviction that they would emancipate their motherland from foreign yoke through these. The cult of violence can not by itself lead a country to its goal of independence. But in the history of the struggle for free- dom in almost every dependent and exploited country, at least one phase of it has been marked by such activities, and those who guide or participate in these are inspired like a Mazzini or a Parnell by the ideas of serving the cause of their country. This was also the case with the Indian Revolu- tionaries of this period. In Bihar there was a recrudescence of Revolutionary activities during the post- 1924 years. The Provincial Govern- ment took whatever steps they thought necessary on their part against these, more particularly to prevent these from spread- ing among the impressionable youths in the educational in- stitutions. Three copies of the Revolutionary (an organ of the Revolutionary Parly of India), Vol. I, No. I of 1st January, 1925, were traced by the special branch police at the Patna Col- lege. Mr. V.H. Jackson, Principal of this College, held that the person who addressed these were evidently ignorant of the Patna College affairs as these were addressed to monitors and there were no monitors at this College. Mr. E.L.L. Hammond, Chief Secretary to the Government of Bihar and Orissa, then issued the following Circular to all the District Magistrates on the 11th February, 1925: “I am desired to inform you that a seditious publication in English, entitled 'The Revolu- tionary', an organ of the Revolutionary Party of India, issue No. I, Vol. I, is now being surreptitiously circulated, not only among the public but also to Colleges and schools where it is calculated to give rise to dissatisfaction. I am to request that you will warn the educational authorities in your dis- trict confidentially of the efforts being made to disseminate the same. The publication in question has been proscribed A NEW TURN 1928-29 27 under section 99 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and all copies wherever found may therefore be forfeited to His Majesty.” The District Magistrates at once communicated necessary orders to the Principals of Colleges, Headmasters of High Schools and Divisional Inspectors of Schools “to prevent the circulation of this publication and to seize and forward” to them any copies of it found any where. The issue of the Revolutionary, referred to above, thus enunciat- ed the guiding principles of the Revolutionary Party of India: “Twenty years of ruthless repression has not been able to crush it. Scathing denunciations by the renowned public leaders have not been able to arrest its steady growth. The movement stands mightier to-day than what it was before. The prospects of this revolutionary party were never so bright as they are today. The future is assured. Let no Indian deny the existence of the revolutionary party in order to denounce the repressive measures of the foreign rulers. The foreigners have no right to rule over India, and therefore they must be denounced and driven out, not that they have committed any particular act of viol- ence or crime. These are the natural consequences of a foreign rule. The foreign rule must be abolished. They have no justification to rule over India except the justification of the sword, and therefore the revolutionary party has taken to the sword. But the sword of the revolutionary party bears ideas at its edge. The immediate object of the revolutionary party in the domain of politics is to establish a Federal Republic of the United States of India by an organized and armed revolution. But this party views all constitutional agitation in the country with contempt and ridicule. It is a mockery to say that India’s salvation can be achieved through constitutional means where no constitution exists. It is half deception to say that India’s political liberty can be obtained through peace- ful and legitimate means when the enemy is determined to break the peace at his own convenience and the fine phrase ‘legitimate’ loses all its charms and significance when one pledges himself to maintain peace at all costs. 28 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR The ideal before us is to serve humanity in an organized way. This ideal can never be realised by India so long as she remains in bondage and slavery, so long as India remains British India. In order that India may realize her ideal, she must have a separate and independent existence. This independence can never be achieved through peaceful and constitutional means. Even a child can understand that the laws that govern British India are not made by the Indians, nor can they have any control over them. British India can never be transformed into a Federal Republic of the United States of India through the British laws and constitution. Young Indians ! shake off your illusions, face realities with a stout heart, and do not avoid struggles, difficulties and sacrifices. The inevitable is to come. Do not be misguided any more. Peace and tranquility you cannot have and India’s liberty can never be achieved through peaceful and legal means. The present Government exists solely because the foreign- ers have successfully been able to terrorise the Indian people. The Indian people do not love their English masters. They do not want them to be here, but they do help the Britishers simply because they arc terribly afraid of them, and this fear resists the Indians from extending their helping hands to the revolutionaries, not that they do not love them. The official terrorism is sure to be met by counter terrorism. A spirit of utter helplessness perv^ades every stratum of our society and terrorism is an effective means of restoring the proper spirit in the society without which progress will be difficult. Moreover, English masters and their hired lackyes can never be allowed to do whatever they like unhampered, unmolested. Every possible difficulty and resistance must be thrown in their way.” As another step to check the dissemination of Revolutionary doctrines, the Bihar Government sought in 1926 to control effectively all such organisations suspected by them to be in sympathy with these. Thus Mr. P.W. Murphy, District Magistrate, Bhagalpur, received the following note in this respect from the Government on the 23rd November, 1926: “It has been brought to the notice of Government that cer- A NEW TURN 1928-29 29 tain organisations which are suspected of being a recruiting and training ground for young revolutionaries have secured popularity, and even some official support, by professing philanthrophic aims and making a display of social service. One such organisation actually obtained a certificate from a District Magistrate for assistance given at a popular festival, and that certificate has assisted tlic members to raise funds for their propaganda. I am desired to say that all Magis- trates, before making any appreciative remarks or giving any certificate to associations professing social service, should carefully ascertain that the organisation is above suspicion, and I am to ask that you will impress this ptinciplc on the subdivisional Magistrates of your district.” Bhagalpur, as during the earlier period of Revolutionary activities, was an important centre of these jiow too. On the 19th January, 1 927, Shri Sachin Bakhsi, who was touring in Bihar for about a year, was arrested at Bhagal])ur on the charge of being a leader of Revolutionary movement . ' Then fol- lowed the discovery by Government of what was called the Deoghur Conspiracy Case. On the 18th October, 1927, the information was received by the C.I.D. at Patna that two persons, suspected to be revolutionary conspirators, had gone to Deoghur in the district of Santal Paraganas, and that arms and ammunition might be found with them. One C.I.D. officer, w^ho was at once sent to Deoghur, traced that one of the persons, Shri Jiban Kanai Pal, was staying in a boarding-house there. With a search warrant, obtained from the local S.D.O. on the 19th October, the boarding-house was raided by the Police on the 20th October when Shri Birendra Nath Bhattacharya handed over to the S.D.O. two Mauser pistols and a bag con- taining 82 Mauser cartridges. With Birendra stayed his brother Surendra Nath and one Tejesh Chandra Ghosh. A quantity of “revolutionary literature” was found with them and a list of names in cypher.* The literature included Shri Aurobindo’s Essay on Gita, Early life of De Valera and Banglar Biplabbad. Further searches were made and 20 1 . He was transported for life in the Kakori Conspiracy Case. 2. Judgment Report on the Deoghur Conspiracy Case. 30 FRBBDOM movement in BIHAR g crsons in all were arrested. Of them, nine were Bengali rahmins, five Bengali Kayasthas, one a Bengali Kshatriya, one a Bengali Vaidya, one a Bengali weaver, one a Bengali potter, one a Bengali Sadgop, and one was a Punjabi. Most of them were aged between 20 and 27 ; some were 30 or 32 and one about 44 years old. A case under section 121-A.I.P.C. was instituted against them. Three of them were charged also under section 19 (b) of Arms Act. The trial of the case opened at Deoghur before a special Magistrate on the 31st January, 1928. On the 1st March all the 20 persons were committed to the sessions. The ses- sions trial commenced on the 3rd April, and ended on the 11th July, when twelve of them were convicted and sentenced to long term rigorous imprisonment and eight were acquitted. Ten of those convicted made an appeal to the Patna High Court, which was heard from the 2nd to the 11th January, 1929, and the conviction of all but one was upheld.’ ‘‘Political Dacoities’ : A dacoity, which took place at Dalsing Sarai in the Dar- bhanga District at 10 p.m. on the 9th November, 1928, was characterised by the Government as a ‘political dacoity. About it the District Magistrate noted in his telegram to the Chief Secretary, dated the 13th November: “A gang of poli- tical dacoits said to be Punjabis in European dress raided a moneylender’s house; shot dead one man, seriously wounded another and wounded several others. They were armed with guns and revolvers and looted twentyfive thousand rupees in cash and notes. None captured or identified.” Swami Shankarananda was suspected to be connected with it and was examined in the jail on the 1 3th November. The District Magistrate believed it to be a ‘political dacoity on the following grounds noted in a Police Report: “I incline to the belief that the Sannyasi is connected with the dacoity and supplied local knowledge which enabled the ‘dacoits* to go straight to their objective. Furthermore 1. Copy of Judgment in the Deoghur Conspiracy Case, Police Report', Bihar and Orissa in 1927-28, p. 60 and in 1228-29, p. 60. A NEW TURN 1928-29 31 I think it is very highly probable that the dacoity is political. My reasons are: Revolvers were used, one live cartridge was picked up by the police and one bullet extracted from the Dody of the deceased Raghunandan Tewari. One of the dacoits was heard by a Bengali doctor living in the house of the complainant to say in English ‘come on’ ‘come on’, and other persons heard the word ‘Shala’ for Sala being used. These phrases indicate that some at least of the dacoits were Bengalies. The Sannyasi is himself a Bengali of Burdwan district. His original name is Ram Shankar Mukherjee. He knows a little English and has a strong connection with Benares. His uncle was Gadhara- nand (formerly Mukherjee) . The Sannyasi’s address is Harar- bagh, P.S. Bhalupura, Gaitrimath, Benares. The kit worn by the dacoits was Khaki shirt; 2 were wearing white sola topies, and 2 peaked cap as worn by ticket collectors. On the 9th instant, the day of occurrence, 5 tickets were collected at Bachwara from Benares, and 22 were taken from Benares shortly after midnight on the night of the occurrence. I have instructed the Inspector to search the Sannyasi’s house at Barh, seize all papers and send them to the C.l.D. for examination of handwriting.” Maulania Conspiracy Case: A similar incident took place at Maulania in the Gham- paran district on the 7th June, 1929, and two more, one again in Champaran and the other in the Darbhanga Dis- trict in the month of May, 1930. All these were regarded by the Government as ‘Political dacoities^ in which believers in the ‘terrorist’’ methods took the leading part. As regards the Maulania case, it was stated in a Police Report of 1929: “Two jjolitical suspects of Bettiah, Shri Phanindra Nath Ghosh and Shri* Banerjee, who had been absent from their homes on that night and were wanted in connection with the Lahore conspiracy case, were arrested and one of them confessed having arranged the dacoity in order to obtain funds for the revolutionary party. Of the 1 1 men alleged to have taken part in the outrage one is accused 1 . Illegible (may be Manmohan Banerjee) . 32 BREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR in the Lahore Conspiracy Case, two were made approvers, five are still absconding and the remaining three were sen- tenced to ten years’ rigorous imprisonment under section 396 I.P.C. An appeal has been referred to the High Court.” Shri Jogendra Shukul, one of the most prominent leaders of the Revolutionary movement in Bihar, whom the police then considered to “be the principal absconder in the Maulania dacoity of Champaran in 1929,” was arrested by the Saran Police on the 11th June, 1930. As is mentioned in a Police Report for 1930, Shri Jogendra Shukul and his companions “were taken by surprise and were overcome after a severe struggle.” Shri Jogendra Shukul and some others involved in the two cases of 1929-30 referred to above were tried next year in what is known as the Tirhut Conspiracy Case. All of them, except two, were convicted. Shri Jogendra Shukul was sentenced to ten years’ rigorous imprisonment and the sen- tences of others (Shri Kedar Manvi Shukul, Shri Baswan Singh, Shri Ramparikshan Singh, Shri Rambinodc Singh,) varied from five to ten years’ rigorous imprisonment. Shri Jogendra Shukul was still to be tried in connection with the Maulania case. Year after year in the period under review in this chapter, books, leaflets and pamphlets, considered objection- able from the point of view of the Government, were proscribed by them. Thus in 1930, fifty three leaflets and pamphlets were proscribed in Bihar. Trades Disputes Bill (1929) and the case of Batukeshwar Dutt and Bhagat Singh : A new revolutionary party (the recently formed Hindu- stan Socialist Republican Army) was active in all parts of India. Shri Phanindra Nath Ghosh and Shri Bhagat Singh, two leading members of this party, were for sometime in charge of Bihar for its work, and Shri Bhagat Singh came to tlus Province in September, 1928. On 8th of April, 1929, when the Trades Disputes Bill was passed by the Assembly and President Patel rose to give his ruling on the Public Safety Bill, two bombe along with a red pamphlet, ^Hindustan Social- ist Republican Army Notice' ^ were thrown from the visitors’ gallery on to the House. The bombs were intended, as the A NEW TURN 1928-29 33 accused stated later, “to make a noise and create a stir, and not to injure’.’* Two youg men were arrested, Shri Batu- keshwar Dutt from Bengal domiciled in Kanpur and Shri Bhagat Singh from the Punjab. Both were tried at Delhi and sentenced to transportation for life on 12th June. They obsei'ved in a spirited statement before the Court: — “Why hurled at all? In reply to this question we have perforce to explain it at length. And in this way we have to explain in full and very clear terms all these circumstances and impulses which urged us to work and which gradually became converted into the historical causes leading to this Bomb tragedy. Some Police oflicers saw us in the jail. They had told us that Lord Irwin while addressing the joint session of the Central Legislature pointed out that this particular incident was not directed against any individual but against an institution. When I heard of it I at once concluded that the real significance of this incident had been justly appre- ciated. We are not a whit less to any one in our love for humtinity. This practical demonstration of ours was directed against such an institution which has not only been exhibiting its impotency since its origin but also furnish proof of its en- ormous potency for committing oppression. As we pondered the belief gradually became dcepei- in our minds that the purpose of the existence of this institution is only to demon- strate India’s impotency and disgrace before the world. This institution is a replica of the oppressive suzerainty of irre- sponsible and dictatorial rule. The representatives of people have repeatedly placed the nation’s grievances but those national claims have in the end been invariably dumped in the dust-bin. Pious resolutions passed by the Assembly have been taken to be meaningless and loathsomely trampled under feet, and that too happened nowhere but in the so called Indian Parliament. Resolutions proposed in connection with the abolition of repressive and arbitrary laws have been looked upon as ludicrous and the government bills and re- 1. Nehru, Autobiography, p. 193. 34 FREEDOM MONEMENT IM BIHAR solutions which had been turned down as unacceptable by elected members of the people have with one stroke of the pen remained ever as before. Even after straining every nerve within this limited scope to understand the usefulness of the existence of this institution we have been hopelessly unsuccessful. Despite the magni- ficence, grandeur, pomp and splendour which is kept alive on the hard earned money of millions of proletariats, we think that this institution is only a replica and a mere pretension full of notoriety. In addition to this, we have not been able to follow the intentions of those public leaders who waste the time and money of people in this dramatic show of India’s helpless slavery. We ponder over these facts and have also pondered over the arrest of a handful of leaders of the labour party. When we were drawn into the Assembly at the in- troduction of Trade Disputes Bill we watched the progress of the Bill there and listened to its debates as well. After having seen and listened to all these, our conviction has become confirmed that we should strangle this institution, which is composed of only freebooters, to death. In the end heaps of dishonour resulting from inhuman and barbaric laws have been dumped on the respectful heads of the representatives of the whole contry. And its result is that the hungry as well as those hardly able to feed them- selves have been deprived of the preliminary right and the only means of reforming their economic conditions. Any- body, who has experienceed like us the feelings consequent upon these dumb labourers being arbitrarily driven to any direction, could not possibly have witnessed this sight without being moved in his heart. Anybody with blood flowing in his heart could not have suppressed the lamentation of his soul for those persons who have sacrificed their life-blood in the building up of the economic structure of a set of plunder- ers and in this class of plunderers in this country the govern- ment is itself the greatest of extortioners; and this merciless extortion has forcibly drawn out the rythm of grief from the depth of our heart. We hurled a bomb on the Assembly floor. We did it on behalf of those people only because they A NEW TURN 1928-29 35 have no other means of expressing their heartrending grief and thus demonstrate the deep resentment. Our one great objective was that wc should unseal the ears of the deaf and give a timely warning to the careless and the heedless. Others have also experienced this state of affairs in their naked form as we have; and a terrible storm is about to break out behind this deceptive contentment of the vast sea of Indian humanity. VVe have simply suspended a danger signal meant only for those who are marching ahead quite unmindful of the fact that a great danger is ahead. Wc have simply given a signal that the days of Ahimsa, the weapon of the golden age, arc numbered. The young generation has so thoroughly experienced the futility of Ahimsa that there is not a shadow of doubt in it. We are sincerely devoted to the cause of hu- manity and being impelled by love we have adopted this course of giving warning so that the vast calamity and grief may be got rid of. So long we have only dwelt upon the impelling forces which led to this incident. Now we think it necessary to explain our objectives in full. It cannot be refuted that among those who were slightly injured wc had no personal enmity or hatred against any one or any members of the Legislative Assembly. On the contrary we again repeat that we regard human life as inexpressibly sacred and we shall think our- selves fortunate in laying down our lives in the service of hu- manity. The question of doing harm to any one does not arise at all. We are no mercenary soldiers. Mercenary soldiers are taught to kill people without remorse. But we have regard for human lives and try to protect human lives as far as we can. Even then that we hurled bomb in the Assembly goes without admission. Without going into imaginary or speculative circum- stances or hypotheses one should find out the result with regard to our motive from only the consequences of our activities. In spite of the evidence of government specialists, the bomb explosion which occurred in the Assemb- ly house led only to slight breakage of a vacant bench and little injuries to less than half a dozen people. The govern- 36 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR mejit specialist has described the consequences of this slight damage as of no meaning. But we find a certain scientific indication in the upshot of its slight damage. Firstly, the explosion occurred in an empty space amidst desks, benches and tables. Secondly, persons only two feet away from the place of the explosion cither remained uninjured or were slightly injured. We had no intention whatsoever to injure anyone fatally. Puiposely, we had hurled that bomb in a safe place. Finally, we surrendered ourselves of our own accord. We arc prepared to undergo the punishment for what we had done. Simultaneously we wanted to impress upon the imperialistic plunderers that by killing people they shall not be able to kill living ideas. I’he whole nation cannot be repressed by killing two of us. Can Ordinances and Public Safety Bills extinguisli the flames of freedom in India? Spur- ious charges, internment, death sentences and arson cannot stem the high ideals and the progress of revolution. But if one does not turn a deaf car to the timely warning then it can be of assistance in mitigating the destruction of lives and grief of the multitude. Wc had undertaken to give a timely wanting and thus fulfil our task. Wc were asked in the court to explain the meaning of Revolution. The true meaning of Revolution does not signify loss of life and there is no room for taking any personal revenge. Revolution is not the cult of bomb and pistol. Ac- cording to us Revolution should change the present economic position and the social structure which evidently is based on injustice. Producers are the most essential factor in a pro- letariat society. But they are exploited by their master, they do not get the due wages of their labour. Others grab these and their fundamental rights are denied to them. On the one hand the peasant, who produces grain for all, is starving along with the members of his family. The weaver, who spins cloth for the world market, is unable to clothe himself and his children. Masons, blacksmiths, carpenters, who construct huge mansions, are rotting and dying in dirty hovels and poor houses. On the other hand, the grabbing capitalists, who A NEW TURN 1928-29 37 are the blood-suckers of the society, squander away crores of rupees merely for the satisfaction of their whims. The incomprehensible inequalities and the vast difference in se- curing facilities are leading towards an utterly hopeless con- fusion (catastrophe). This state of affairs cannot survive for long. It is evident that the present setup of society is revelling while sitting on the edge of a volcano. If the whole mighty structure of this civilization is not rescued in time, then it will be smashed with a crash. Therefore, a complete change is extremely needed. Hence for them, who are conscious enough it becomes their duty to reorganise the society on the foundation of socialistic prin- ciples. So long as this is not accomplished, and so long as the exploitation of man by man and of nation by nation, which is in practice in this world under the name of imperial- ism, is not rooted out, this torture and dance of death, whose fear has today gripped mankind, cannot be stopped. And all tall talk to stop war and the wishful thinking of the emerg- ence of a new age are simply naked hypocrisy. By revolution w'e mean the establishment of such a social organisation whicli will remain for ever free from the fear of exploitation and in which the sovereignty of the people will be securely entrenched. This is our cherished idealism. And having been im- pressed by this current of thought we hav^e sounded this warn- ing with high emphasis and justice. If no heed is paid to our warning and if this present system of government goes on proving a stumbling block amidst the rising waves of natural powers, then the outbreak of a deadly war is inevitable. In that war all hindrances shall be uprooted and people’s sover- eignty will be established, and then the way leading to the fulfilment of the ideals of peace shall become wider. Revolution is the inalienable right of humanity. Freedom is the cherished birthright of all. The proletariat is the real sustainer of society. The ultimate objective of the proletariat is the sovereignty of the people. In the accomplishment of this ideal and belief we shall respectfully undergo all afflictions which will be inflicted on us. We have brought the sunshine 38 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR of youth — our lifeblood — to be offered at the altar of revolu- tion as no sacrifice for this high ideal can be called too great. We are satisfied. We are awaiting the advent of Revolution. Ix>ng live Revolution !!!”‘ The Assembly Hall bomb explosion {1929) and its repercussions in Bihar: The bomb explosion in the Asssembly Hall had its re- percussions in almost all parts of India. At Patna copies of a leaflet, containing pictures of Shri Bhagat Singh and Shri Batukeshwar Dutt and the author- ship of which was ascribed to Professor Cyan Saha, were sold at one anna each. The two following posters were posted up during the night of the 17th August, 1929, on some places including the gates of Ghajjubagh and the Post Office: — (1) A large poster bearing the words, — Sympathise with hungers trikers, contribute to defence fund” (2) A smaller poster bearing the words, — '’'’Every nation has a right to revolt against tyranny and oppression”^ Professor Cyan Saha was considered by the Government to be “a revolutionary of extreme views who favoured terror- ism with a view to gaining complete Independence.” He was intimately connected with Shri Manindra Narayan Roy, leader of the Patna Revolutionary Party, and with Shri Jai- chand Vidyalankar, another Professor of the Bihar National College and leader of the Punjab .section of the Hindusthan Republican Association. Shri M. N. Roy, then a leading member of the new violence party, came to Patna in 1929. He had, as the police suspected, confidential discussions with professor Cyan Saha. In the month of August, 1929, Shri M. N. Roy delivered magic lantern lectures in Patna illustra- ing the poverty of India as compared with her wealth in the past and the cruelties of the servants of the English East India Company. For these he was arrested on the 17th August, but was released on bail by the High Court.® 1.

Fortnightly Reports of the Patna Commissioner for the periods ending 13th August and 27th August, 1929, A NEW TURN 1928-29 39 The Lahore Cosnpirary Case and hunger strike by prisoners : In the meanwhile, the Punjab Police had convicted and brought lor trial a number of persons including Shri Bhagat Singh and Shri Batukeshwar Dutt, who, it was alleged, had organised a country-wide terrorist conspiracy. This came to be known as the Lahore Conspiracy Case, which at- tracted considerable attention in India. As a protest against bad treatment given to the accused the undertrial prisoners went on hunger strike. Many political prisoners at other places went on sympathetic hunger strike. Shri Bhagat Singh and Shri Batukeshwar Dutt continued hunger strike for thirteen weeks. On the 13th September, Sri Jatindra Nath Das died on the 64th day of his hungerstrike. His death was a great shock to the country. “No event for many years past had touched the people so much and all over the country vast demonstrations were held.”* When the dead body of Shri Jatindra Nath Das passed through Gaya towards Howrah, about two thousand people, according to a Government report®, assmebled at the railway station and there was a sympathetic demonstration there. There were demonstrations in almost every important city of Bihar. On the 24th September a procession was taken at Patna as a mark of sympathy for the deceased patriot.® The Government appointed a committee to consider the question of treatment of political prisoners and as a result of its deliberations some new rules were issued creating three classes of political prisoners. But these did not bring any improvement in their conditions in the jails. Lord Irwin's announcement {1929) : The whole country was already astir, and “events were marching step by step, pushed onward, so it seemed, by some motive force of their own.”* Taking into consi- deration that these were “critical days, when matters by 1.

His Excel- lency, the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, on returning to India after consultation with his Majesty’s Government in England by a personal visit to his country, made the following announce- ment on the 31st October, 1929; — “But in view of the doubts which have been expressed both in great Britain and India regarding the interpretation to be placed on the intentions of the British Government in enacting the statute of 1919, I am authorised on behalf of His Majesty’s Government to state clearly that in their judgment it is implicit in the declareition of 1917 that the natural issue of India’s consti- tutional progress, as therein contemplated, is the attainment of Dominion status”. It was also mentioned in this announ- cement that, after the publication of the reports of the Indian Statutory Commission and the Indian Central Committee, a Round Table Conference of British statesmen and representatives of the dilferent parties in British India as also of the Indian States would be convened in London to determine the future constitution of India. Delhi Manifesto Immediately after this announcement, a Leaders’ Confer- ence was called at President Patel’s residence at Delhi on the 1st November. Leaders of difTercnt groups, advanced and moderate, agreed to issue a joint manifesto.^ They ex- pressed in it their appicciation of “the sincerity underlying the (Viceroy’s) declaration” and hoped to be able to tender “co-operation to His Majesty’s Government in their effort to evolve a scheme of Dominion Constitution suitable for India’s needs.” But at the same time they mentioned cer- tain conditions which were vital and must be fulfilled “to inspire trust and to ensure co-operation of all the principal organisations in the country.” These conditions were; 1 . His Excellency the Viceroy's statement of 31st October, 1929. 2. Shri Jawahar Lai Nehru, who describes it as “the compromising resolution”, at firs^ disliked it but later agreed to sign it. Shri Subhas Chandra Bose, Dr. Kitchlew and Shri Abdul Bari refused to sign it. Among the signatories to the manifesto from Bihar were Sri Jagat Narayan Lai and Dr. Syed Mahmud. A NEW TURN 1928-29 41 “(1) All discussions at the proposed Conference to be on the basis of full Dominion Status for India ; (2) There should be a predominant representation of Congressmen at the Conference; (3) A general amnesty of political prisoners; (4) The Government of India to be carried on from s now onwards as far as possible under the existing conditions on the lines of a Dominion Govern- ment.” The Working Committee of the Indian National Congress, meeting at Allahabad from the 16th of November, 1929, held that their confirmation of the Delhi Manifesto was “con- stitutionaly limited to the date of the holding of the forth- coming session of the Congress.” Optimism was soon blasted by the uncompromising attitude of a considerable section of the Press and a number of prominent 'statesmen in England. The Viceroy’s announce- ment raised a storm of opposition there, and the Labour Government’s India policy was subjected to strong criticism. 1 Just prior to the Lahore Congress another attempt for a compromise between the Government and the Congress was made through an interview of Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Motilal Nehru, President Patel, Sri Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jinnah with the Viceroy at New Delhi on the 23rd December. But the Conference broke on the question of Dominion Status. An official communique stated that it was impossible for the Viceroy or His Majesty’s Government “in any way to prejudge the action of the Conference or to restrict the liberty of Parliament.” Bihar Provincial Conference {1929): Nationalist India was determined to go ahead, and the new spirit of advance was remarkably strong in Bihar. The 28th session of the Bihar Provincial Conference met at Mon- ghyr on the 9th December, 1929. In the absence of the President-elect, Shri Rajendra Prasad, Shri Ram Dayalu Singh 1. The Indian Quarterly Register, 1929, Vol. II, pp. 441 — 454. 42 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR read the Hindi translation of the Presidential Address. This Conference passed a resolution advocating Independence, though the elderly persons were in favour of waiting till this point had been decided by the Congress. Shri Vishwanath Mishra moved a resolution as follows: “This Conference fully supports the resolution adopted by the Congress Working Committee at its meeting held at Allahabad in connection with the Viceroy’s declaration of October 31st, and at the same time advises the people of the Province to be prepared for mass civil disobedience in case the next Congress at Lahore decided on any such step in pursuance of the resolution adopted at the last session of the Congress; in Calcutta.’’ To this Shri Ramkrishna Sharma moved the following amendment: “This Confernce looks upon the Viceroy’s Declaration of October 31 as not only hollow in itself but also misleading to the people, particularly so after the debate in Parliament on the subject and recomends to the Lahore Congress that it should declare complete inde- pendence as its goal on January 1, 1930, and calls upon the people of the Province that they should be ready for mass civil disobedience.” After a long and heated discussion for three hours the amendment was carried by 149 to 103 votes.l Sardar PateVs visit to Bihar and its significance: Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel also attended this Conference. He toured the Province of Bihar exhorting the people to implement the constructive programme of the Congress and to be ready for the inevitable struggle. Citing the example of the brave Bardoli peasants, Sardar Patel asked the peasants of Bihar to “cast off all fear, — ^fear of the zamindar, of the sarkar, of imprisonment or death.” “I want you to cultivate,” he said, “the readiness to say no to the Zamindars and the courage to take consequences. And for that I have already said the first and the last thing is fearlessness.” At Gaya, a number of peasants of the district saw him and complained against the exactions under the danabandhi system (payment of revenue in kind). 1. Ibid, p. 369. A NEW TURN 1928-29 43 He suggested the appointment of a Committee to investigate into the whole matter and he promised to make more help- ful suggestions on receiving the Committee’s report.
