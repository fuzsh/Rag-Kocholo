A variety of different laws are in vogue and their application depends on multiple factors like the religion or tribe of the parties, domicile, community, sect in the community, marital status of the parties, religion of the spouse, and the type of marriage the parties might have undergone. Before the advent of British rule, the major3 laws of inheritance in India had either their roots in religion or were deeply influenced by personal laws which owed their allegiance to religion and custom.4 Muslims followed the Muslim law, while Hindus were governed by the Shastric and the customary law depending upon the region and the specific school or community a particular family adhered to, thus displaying a large variation. The Parsis had their own customary law. Maximum diversity prevailed in the case of Indian Christians. Following the advent of the British, two major Christian communities came into being in India—the East Indian Christians, that followed the European customs and the native Christians, who were either converts or descendants of the converts from the non-Christian communities, mainly the Hindus and the Muslims, and followed their distinct customary laws which were also given judicial recognition.5 If a convert became westernised, which he had to establish, then English law could be applied to him.6 With a view to simplifying and unifying the innumerable diverse and conflicting succession laws, Sir Henry Maine, law member of the Viceroy’s council caused the enactment of the Indian Succession Act in 1865. Though this Act was intended to be the general law of succession for all Indians, it failed in its attempt to bring in the desired uniformity due to the following reasons: (i)\n\nIt incorporated the principles of Roman and English laws that were foreign not only in their contents but also totally unsuited to the Indian cultural and religious environment.\n\n(ii) The Act recognised a woman as an absolute owner of property and preferred her to male collaterals. It did not discriminate between agnates and cognates7 and even conferred succession rights on daughters, treating them at par with sons. These provisions were totally different from the laws governing the Hindus, Muslims and Parsis. (iii) It did not recognise the concept of joint family property and consequently no right by birth was granted to the son in the uniform scheme laid down under the Act. This total negation of the superiority of males struck at the root of the son-centred economy that Indian succession laws then portrayed. Efforts to extend the application of this Act to all Indians were strongly resisted by the Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and even native Christians. Consequently, its application was confined to only some Christians and Jews. As native Christians were not prepared to accept this foreign law, their resistance led to the passing of two Acts for them in the erstwhile States of Travancore and Cochin.8 In 1872, the application of the Indian Succession Act, 1865, was also extended to all Indians who married under the Special Marriage Act of 1872 and to the property of the issue of such marriage. This Act of 1865 formed part of the Indian Succession Act of 1925 without a single change. In addition to these principles of Roman and English laws, the merger of the Union territories of Goa, Daman and Diu and Pondicherry in the years 1961 and 19629 respectively, resulted in the introduction of the principles of two foreign legal systems—the Portuguese and the French legal system—in the existing composite system of personal laws.10 The various succession laws in India now categorically fell into two groups:\n\nPage 2 of 18 INTRODUCTION LAWS OF INTESTATE AND TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION IN INDIA (i)\n\nthe earlier laws that owed their allegiance to religion; and\n\n(ii) the later laws introduced by the English, French and Portuguese with a western orientation. The notable difference between these two groups of laws was that where the latter had no provision regarding the general exclusion of women from inheritance, the former group of laws treated women unfavourably with respect to their inheritance rights. They, as a rule, preferred agnates to cognates and conferred superior rights on males in comparison to the female counterparts. An exception to this rule was the matriarchal system of inheritance prevalent in some parts of South India that, in complete contrast to the situation in the rest of India, traced descent through females, thus granting them better rights in comparison to their sisters elsewhere.\n\nAPPLICABILITY CRITERION Personal laws in India owe their diversity to their varied origin, distinct principles and the bulk of substantive law itself. Broadly speaking, people adhering to five different religions live in India, viz., the Hindus,11 Muslims, Christians, Parsis and the Jews. Each of these religious communities has distinct laws. There is further divergence in such laws based on considerations like the sex of an intestate, his sect in the community to which he belongs, his domicile at the time of his death and the type of marriage he might have undergone. Following these considerations, a multiplicity of succession laws are validly operative and applicable in India. Besides, the Scheduled Tribes in India are governed by their customary uncodified laws of inheritance and enjoy Constitutional protection of their culture and identity.12 LAWS RELATING TO INTESTATE SUCCESSION HINDU LAW The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 Under Hindu law, the property that a person may own, or can have an interest in, can be categorised into two— separate property and joint family property. The law relating to joint family property is governed by the Hindu joint family system that is unique to Hindus and has no parallel anywhere in the world. With respect to separate property, a predominant section of Hindus is governed by the general scheme of succession as laid down under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.13The Act expressly exempts a large number of constitutionally recognised scheduled tribes in various parts of India from its application.14 These tribes are governed by their distinct laws.15 Some of the communities governed by the Act are the Jati Vaishnavs,16 Chamaars,17 Adi Dravidas,18 Bairagis,19 and Gouds.20Santhals, after being Hinduised, have adopted customs followed by Hindus and are no longer to be excluded from the application of the Act.21 However, the Act is not applicable to the Oraons,22 Gonds of Madhya Pradesh.23Further, the Act is not applicable to Hindus domiciled in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, Goa, Daman and Diu and Renocants of Pondicherry who are governed by their distinct laws.24 Marumakkattayam and Aliyasantana Laws In South India, before 1956, the customary Marumakkattayam laws governed a considerable section of Hindus mainly from the non-Brahmin castes and Nair community in Travancore Cochin, the Thiyyas and other cognate castes in the district of North Malabar and South Kanara, and the Mapillas of Malabar and Payyannur Gramam of North Malabar. Similarly, the Bunts, Billawas and the non-priestly castes among the Jains of South Kanara were governed by the Aliyasantana laws.25 The primary difference between Marumakkattayam and Aliyasantana laws was the provision of a separate scheme of succession for males and female intestates under the former and a uniform scheme for all intestates under the latter. The district of Malabar formed part of the State of Madras till 31 October 1956. The customary Marumakkattayam law applicable to Malabar was modified in certain respects from time to time by the Madras legislature,26 but the law relating to property relations between the members of the Tarwad remained in its customary form until the fourth decade of this century. Under the customary law, partition of family property could not be demanded by an individual member or even by a Tavazhi27 as per the judicial decisions of over 75 years till the Madras legislature enacted a series of legislations settling the law.28 These modifications were however applicable to the Malabar area which was originally part of the State of Madras and not to the State of Travancore and Cochin as it existed before\n\nPage 3 of 18 INTRODUCTION LAWS OF INTESTATE AND TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION IN INDIA the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. There were several legislative measures in the State of Travancore and Cochin before and after these states merged with the Indian Union and in the State of Kerala, making changes in the customary Marumakkattayam law.29 With the objective of removing caste-based distinction among Hindus of different areas and to improve upon these laws, these Acts were repealed. Special rules were enacted and incorporated under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956,30 for the Hindus earlier governed by these enactments. These rules differed from the general scheme of succession by retaining the basic principles of the matriarchal system of inheritance. Laws relating to Hindus of Goa, Daman and Diu In the State of Goa and the Union Territories of Daman and Diu, the general law applicable to all inhabitants is the Portuguese Civil Code, 1867.31 Based on the Napoleonic Code, it is the codification of almost all the civil laws on the substantive side.32 Its enforcement33 repealed34 the existing laws of all the overseas provinces. As early as 1880 however, the Portuguese had protected some Hindu usages and customs relating to marriage, adoption and the joint family under the laws of ‘Usages and Customs of Gentile Hindus of Goa 1880’ and similar laws enacted for Hindus of Daman35 and Diu.36 In its application to the local Hindus, the Portuguese laws have been subjected to the provisions of these protective laws. The legal position in this respect remains unchanged till the present day.37 MUSLIM LAW The Indian Muslims are governed by the uncodified Muslim law of inheritance, enjoined in the holy Quran,38 the teachings of the Prophet, legislative enactments and judicial decisions. The Sunni Muslims39 follow either the Hanafi or the Shafi law while the Shias adhere to the Ithna Ashari or the Ismaili’i law.40 Some centuries ago, Hindu inhabitants of North Malabar were converted en masse to Islam. However, they continued to follow the Marumakkattayam law, especially in matters relating to property among family members. The law administered by the courts to these communities was subject to a body of customs and usages that received judicial recognition.41Since the enactment of the Madras Marumakkattayam Act (Act 22 of 1933), if a member of the Mapilla Marumakkattayam family married a person not governed by the Marumakkattayam law, the property of the person governed by the Marumakkattayam law devolved according to that system of law, whereas the property of a person governed by the Islamic law devolved according to the Islamic law of succession. The result was that whereas interests of a Mapilla governed by the Marumakkattayam law devolved by survivorship, his separate property descended by inheritance in accordance with the Islamic law.42 The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 193743 expressly directs courts in India to apply the Muslim law of inheritance to all Indian Muslims. This statute had the effect of abrogating all customs relating to personal law and inheritance, which were at variance with the Quranic law.44 PARSI LAW The Parsi immigrants came to India to escape religious persecution by the Arab conquerors of Persia.45 They adopted the customs of the place where they had first taken shelter.46A panchayat, i.e. an assembly of elders, administered decisions in civil and criminal matters while personal matters were governed by decisions of the priests. Due to existence of a parallel system of administration in the Mofussil and Presidency areas, Parsis in the former areas were governed by their customary laws while those in the latter areas were governed by English laws. In complete contrast to the law of the Mofussil Parsis under which women were excluded from inheritance initially and had only a right of maintenance, under the English law, the widow of an intestate had an absolute share to the extent of one-third of his property and the daughter was treated on par with the son. This diverse situation was brought to an end by the Parsi Intestate Succession Act 1865,47 that framed a uniform scheme for all Indian Parsis and increased the share of a widow and a daughter to a specific absolute ownership rather than a bare claim of maintenance.48Thereafter, the said Act was amended and incorporated in ss. 50–60 and Schedule II of the Indian Succession Act, 1925.49The Act was amended in 193750 and then in 199151 effecting major changes in the inheritance laws of Parsis making them more equitable and gender just. CHRISTIAN LAW With respect to the Indian Christians, the diversity in inheritance laws is greatly intensified by making domicile a criterion for determining the application of laws.52Till January 1986, Christians in the State of Kerala were governed by two different Acts—those domiciled in Cochin were subject to the application of the Cochin Christian Succession Act, 1921 while the Travancore Christians were governed by the Travancore Christian Succession Act, 1916. These\n\nPage 4 of 18 INTRODUCTION LAWS OF INTESTATE AND TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION IN INDIA two Acts have now been repealed and the Christians following these laws earlier are now governed by the general scheme of inheritance under the Indian Succession Act, 1925.53 However, the Travancore Christians following the Marumakka Avakashi system,54 Roman Catholics who follow Latin rites55 and the Protestant Christians living in the five taluks, i.e. Karunagapally, Quilon, Chirayinkil, Trivandrum and Neyyattinkara, have their separate customary laws. Similarly, the European Christians, Anglo Indians, Parangi communities of Cochin and the Tamil Christians of Chittur taluk of Cochin are governed by their distinct customary laws.56 Further, Christians in the State of Goa and the Union Territories of Daman and Diu are governed by the Portuguese Civil Code, 186757 while those in Pondicherry adhere to any of the following laws: (i)\n\nCustomary Hindu laws58\n\n(ii) The Indian Succession Act, 192559 (iii) The French Civil Code, 180460 Indian Christians who are not subject to any of the above customary or statutory laws are governed by the general scheme of inheritance laid down under the Indian Succession Act, 1925.61 Christians in Goa, Daman and Diu Prior to 1961, Goa, Daman and Diu were Portuguese colonies, known as overseas provinces of Portugal to which the Portuguese Civil Code was extended with effect from 1 July, 1870.62 However, its application in matters of inheritance and succession was confined to non-Hindu communities, largely, Christians. The law relating to succession was amended in 1910,63 though no major change took place till 1961. In 1961, Goa was liberated and in the following year the Constitution was amended.64 In 1962 itself, the legislation affecting Goa was passed and that saved the application of the then existing laws to the inhabitants of Goa.65 Thus, Christians of these areas are still governed by the provisions of the Portuguese Civil Code, 1867.66 Before the advent of the French in Pondicherry, its population consisted of Hindus, Muslims and a good number of Christians who were new converts from Hinduism following their distinct laws. The French Civil Code, 1804, was extended to Pondicherry in 1819. However, it was provided that the population of Indian origin whether Hindus, Muslims or Christians, would continue to be governed by the laws and customs of their respective religion67 with the result that Christians of Pondicherry unlike Christians of the rest of India, did not get a separate succession law and continued to be governed by their original law, i.e., the customary Hindu law. Nevertheless, in matters of marriage and divorce they were subject to the provisions of the French Civil Code, 1804.68 The French Civil Code was first applied in Pondicherry to French nationals migrating to India. It provided that Indians69 could renounce their personal law and embrace French law. Many Indians took advantage of this offer70 and became ‘Renocants’.71 Consequently, French law became applicable to them and they were no longer subject to their traditional law in personal matters. The merger of Pondicherry with India72did not affect the legal set-up substantially. The Indian government in conformity with the Treaty of Cession allowed the Renocants and those who became Indian nationals to continue to be governed by their laws. The Indian Succession Act, 1925, was extended to Pondicherry in 1984; yet the instrument of extension excluded the application of this Act to the Renocants. Therefore, Christians in Pondicherry are governed by three different laws—The Indian Succession Act, 1925, the uncodified customary Hindu Law73 or The French Civil Code, 1804. JEWS India also has a small population of about 4500 to 5000 Jews. In matters of inheritance and succession, the Jewish community of India is governed by the general scheme of succession under the Indian Succession Act, 1925.74 EFFECT OF MARRIAGE ON THE LAWS OF SUCCESSION The diversity in matrimonial laws is closely linked to the religion of the parties. Separate marriage laws have been provided for the various religious groups and communities inhabiting India. In addition to these religion specific matrimonial legislations is the Special Marriage Act, 195475that can be availed of by any Indian irrespective of his/her religion. Any Indian who gets married under this Act or gets his/her marriage solemnised under the religion specific law registered under this Act, will, in matters of succession, be governed not by his/her religion based law but by the general scheme of succession laid down under the Indian Succession Act, 1925.76This law also applies\n\nPage 5 of 18 INTRODUCTION LAWS OF INTESTATE AND TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION IN INDIA to the property of the issue of such marriage. For example, where two Muslims who contract a Nikah under their classical law and get it registered after one year under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, want to separate, the husband cannot pronounce a Talaq on his wife but will have to proceed to the court under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 to seek dissolution of the marriage. If any of the parties die, succession to his/her property will be governed by the provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 and not by the classical law of inheritance laid down in the Quran. However, after 1976, this rule is not applicable to two Hindus getting married under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 or registering their marriage solemnised under Hindu law under this Act. They continue to be subject to the application of Hindu law in matters of succession to their property.77 RELEVANCE OF SEX OF AN INTESTATE FOR LAWS OF INHERITANCE The Hindu Succession Act, 1956,78 and the rules for Hindus governed by the Marumakkattayam and Aliyasantana laws79 provide different schemes of succession for male and female intestates.80 Under the Hindu Succession Act, for female intestates, there is further divergence linked with the source of the property that is the subject matter of inheritance. The property of a female intestate is classified into three categories:181 (i)\n\nproperty inherited from either of her parents in the capacity of their daughter;\n\n(ii) property inherited from her husband or father-in-law in the capacity of a widow or a widowed daughter-inlaw; and (iii) any other property. The heirs and the order of succession for each of the three categories differ.282 Rules for Hindus governed by the Marumakkattayam and Aliyasantana laws provide for categorisation of the property of a female into two:383 (i)\n\nproperty inherited by her from her husband or her father-in-law; and\n\n(ii) any other property. Here also the heirs and the order of succession vary for both the properties. To sum up, the relevant considerations for determining the inheritance law applicable to the property of a deceased are not only his religion but also his sect in the particular religious community, the sex of the intestate, his domicile at the time of his death and also the type of marriage. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE HINDU LAW Hindu Succession Act, 1956 The text of Manu484 ‘sons take the property to the nearest sapinda, the inheritance next belongs’, is the foundation of the rules of inheritance amongst Hindus.585 Prior to the enactment of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the ruling canon in determining the order of succession in the Mitakshara system was propinquity while in the Dayabhaga system, it was religious efficacy.686 In the matriarchal system it was propinquity. Separate modes of succession were, and still are, provided for male and female intestates. Paramount importance was given to the constitution of the joint Hindu family, a unit headed by the seniormost male member of the family, called ‘Karta’, and comprising all his male descendants, their wives and unmarried daughters. Further, ‘coparcenary’, an institution within a joint family had, as its members, the last holder of the property and his male lineal descendants till four generations including him. Till 1985, coparcenary did not admit females as its members.787 For male Hindus, different rules governed succession to their self-acquired property and joint family or coparcenary property, with survivorship being the basic criterion for acquiring an interest in the latter. Under classical law, the primary heirs of a male intestate were his son, son of a predeceased son and son of a predeceased son of a predeceased son. In case of ancestral property, the rights of the heirs have been effective and equal even during the lifetime of the father. However, in the case of self-acquired property, their rights have\n\nPage 6 of 18 INTRODUCTION LAWS OF INTESTATE AND TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION IN INDIA been unequal and subordinate, though effective in the absence of any disposition by the father.888 The preferential right to inherit was determined by the family relationship and community of corporeal particles.989 In general, agnates were preferred to cognates as a consequence of preference of the male line over the female line based on the ancient standards of propinquity. Contrary to popular myth that females were excluded from inheritance, cognates and females were recognised as heirs right from the time of Yajnavalkya Smriti.1090 Full-blood relations were preferred to half-blood relations. The rule of representation was recognised save in case of a son, and son of a predeceased son. In case of two or more heirs succeeding jointly, they took the estate as tenants-in-common and not as joint tenants. The doctrine of survivorship was limited to unobstructed heritage or coparcenary property only. In the case of succession to absolute property (stridhan) of a female, the rules were different and diametrically opposite to the case of a male intestate. Females were preferred to males in the same degree.1191 However, while males inherited the estate absolutely, females had only a life interest in the inherited property.1292 Tenancy-incommon was the rule in case of two or more heirs succeeding at the same time. Further, the category of heirs and the order of succession varied with the marital status of a female.1393 Though the old law was considerably modified by legislation, yet it was not abrogated totally. The basic framework remains the same. The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 retains the principle of propinquity as the basis of determination of title to succession. Basic rules of separate schemes for male and female intestates, separate rules of devolution in case of coparcenary and self-acquired property, general preference of agnates over cognates,1494 de-recognition of the principles of representation beyond three degrees for male descendants in case of male intestates1595 and two degrees for lineal descendants in case of female intestates,1696 preference to full-blood relations over half-blood relations1797 and recognition of adoptive relations on par with natural born relations1898 are some of the principles that have been left untouched. The deviation is in the field of devolution of the undivided interest in Mitakshara coparcenary. The earlier rule of survivorship stands qualified. Till 2005, the presence of any class-I female heir or a class-I male heir claiming through a female, caused devolution of the interest in an undivided coparcenary by intestate succession and not by survivorship. Since the amendment of the Hindu Succession Act in 2005, the doctrine of survivorship has been abolished in case of male coparceners but has been expressly retained in case of female coparceners.1999 Disqualification on the grounds of difference in religion again stands qualified so as to exclude from this disqualification, descendents of a convert born before his conversion.20100 Following the rule of public policy, the murderer of an intestate is disqualified21101 from inheriting his property if the murder was caused in furtherance of succession. All other disqualifications that were earlier operative22102 have now been done away with. However, the deletion of Sec. 24 and a conspicuous absence of any further direction has created yet another confusion by the 2005 amendment. Illegitimate children are conferred recognition for the purpose of inheritance only to the mother’s property.23103But children born of a void marriage irrespective of its annulment, or a voidable marriage that is annulled by a degree of court can inherit the property of both the parents. Under the old law as interpreted by the Mitakshara and the Dayabhaga, an agnatic relationship extended to 14 degrees. The present Act provides no limitation of degrees or impediments in the way of any agnate. It is a retrograde measure to the extent that the Act overlooks the claim of nearer cognates to succeed in preference to remoter agnates.24104 For succession to the property of a female intestate, separate schemes are provided depending upon the source of acquisition of property available for succession. In the absence of children or grandchildren, property inherited by a female from either of her parents in the capacity of their daughter, reverts to her father’s heirs25105 and that inherited from her deceased husband or father-in-law, reverts to her husband’s heirs.26106 It is evident that the old concept of stridhan still lurks in the background. Further, even in her self-acquired property, the entire family and blood relations of her husband, howsoever remote they may be, are preferred to all of her own blood relations except her children or grandchildren.27107 Marumakkattayam and Aliyasantana Laws The primary difference between the Mitakshara system of inheritance and the Marumakkattayam and Aliyasantana laws lies in the former following the patriarchal system and the latter adhering to the matriarchal system i.e., tracing descent from a common ancestress.28108 Under this system, a lady and all her children constitute a Tarwad, (an institution of joint family similar to the one followed by the Mitakshara Hindus) in which every member has a right by birth.29109 The rules of survivorship govern the devolution of property of any member of tarwad. The basis of determination of heirs is propinquity. The\n\nPage 7 of 18 INTRODUCTION LAWS OF INTESTATE AND TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION IN INDIA rules for devolution of the separate property of male and female intestates are different.30110 Similar to the rule applicable generally to Hindus, the source of acquisition of property in case of female intestates is still material though the categorisation has been reduced here from three to two.31111 For succession to the separate property of male intestates, the principles are same as under the general law, with one exception, i.e., treatment of remoter agnates and cognates on par.32112 For female intestates, the mother and her heirs are preferred to the husband and his heirs respectively.33113 Hindus in the State of Goa, and Union Territories of Daman and Diu The Goan Hindus are governed by the Portuguese Civil Code, 1867.34114 However, some of the basic concepts of Hindu families, like the institution of joint family, its management by the Karta, and maintenance of all its members from the common income so long as they are joint, are given statutory protection.35115 The Portuguese version of joint family differs materially from the concept of Mitakshara joint family and coparcenary. In this case, we do not come across the doctrine of survivorship save in the case of co-widows, though a provision for partition has been provided.36116 As per the general law of marriage, applicable also to Goan Hindus the bridegroom and the bride are supposed to enter into an ante-nuptial contract before their wedding, whereby they agree to bring together all their properties and liabilities, present or future. This contract known as ‘community of assets’ has a bearing on the law of succession also. On the death of one of the spouses, under the system of community of assets, the surviving spouse is entitled in the first instance, to one-half of the total property of the deceased, which is without prejudice to the inheritance rights with respect to the other half available for succession. This other half devolves on the legal heirs.37 The basis for determination of heirs is consanguinity or blood relationship. In general, preference is given to descendants over ascendants who, in turn, are preferred to collaterals. The surviving spouse comes thereafter. His/her secured property rights are evidently the reason for relegation to such inferior placement.38118 The distinguishing feature of the law governing Goan Hindus from the law relating to Hindus in the rest of India is the recognition of rights of succession39119 up to six degrees only for collaterals (ascent and descent) unlike the law for Hindus under the Mitakshara system of inheritance which confers rights of succession on all the blood relatives of the intestates irrespective of their degrees of relations with the intestate. Further, here in general, male and female heirs and agnates and cognates are treated on par. Full-blood relations get double the share of half-blood or uterine blood relations while uterine blood and half-blood relations are again treated on par. Illegitimacy is a disqualification, while difference of religion is not of any consequence. A valid adoption confers the status of a natural born legitimate child on the adoptee.40120 Hindus of Daman The Hindus of Daman, though primarily governed by the Portuguese Civil Code, 1867, are allowed to protect their institution of joint family, joint family property, and the doctrine of survivorship in the restricted sense.41121 The basis of determination of the title to succession is propinquity. Descendants are given first preference, followed by ascendants and then collaterals.42122 A widow, though a primary heir of an intestate, has only a life interest in the property.43123 All males exclude females in the same degree of relationship.44124 Agnates are preferred to cognates,45125 full-blood is preferred to half-blood46126 and a valid adoption is treated on par with natural birth.47127 Rules of representation are recognised for lineal male descendants till great grand-children of the brothers and sisters of the deceased.48128 While difference in religion is immaterial, illegitimacy operates as a disqualification.49129 The Daman law retains rights of succession in favour of all blood relations of the deceased. Hindus in the Union Territory of Diu The Hindus of Diu also follow the institution of joint family, joint family property and survivorship of the undivided interest of a coparcener on his death, though primarily they are subject to the provisions of the Portuguese Civil Code, 1867.50130 Devolution of separate property differs with the marital status of a deceased. The property of an unmarried Hindu, irrespective of sex, is subject to the provisions of the Portuguese Civil Code, 1867, while the property of a married Hindu, whether male or female, is subject to the Diu Code.51131\n\nPage 8 of 18 INTRODUCTION LAWS OF INTESTATE AND TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION IN INDIA In general, under the Diu law, daughters are excluded by sons,52132 agnates are preferred to cognates, full-blood relatives are preferred to those related by half-blood, principle of representation is recognised only for descendants,53133 succession rights for collaterals are recognised up to only ten degrees,54134 the widow of the deceased is given only a life estate,55135 adoption is treated on par with natural birth56136 and difference of religion does not operate as a disqualification. Illegitimacy, however, operates as a disqualification though the children are deemed to be related to their mother where her marriage was annulled.57137 MUSLIM LAW To determine the fundamental notions of kinship (proximity) underlying the Islamic law of succession, we have to turn to the customary rules of inheritance as were prevalent in Arabia before the revelation. The ruling canon for determining the title of succession in pre-Islamic Arabia was comradeship-in-arms and consequently blood ties assumed a secondary role. Male agnates were given paramount importance. With the revelation of the holy Quran, the basic principles of comradeship-in-arms were substituted for blood ties. ‘There is no bond stronger than the blood tie’ became the general principle and the title to the succession was extended to all blood relations in the widest sense. Consequently, near blood relations who were earlier excluded but now included were called the Quranic sharers and in comparison to the already established agnates were awarded half of the shares of the later. The rule, therefore, does not provide that every female relation will take half of the share of her male counterpart but that the newly entitled heir, whether male or female, shall take half of the established heir’s share.58138 Thus if the newly introduced heir is also a male, he stands in no better position than the female counterpart e.g., both the parents, as sharers, take one-sixth share. Similarly, uterine brothers and sisters share equally.59139 The interpretations of these Quranic provisions and their incorporation into the already existing system led to a divergence of opinion amongst the Shias and the Sunnis.60140 The Sunnis retained the old framework, viz., the preference of agnates over cognates, but superimposed the Quranic set-up over the old framework. On the other hand, the Shias blended the old rules with the new. In the light of the newly laid down principles, the resulting scheme of this revision was widely different from the one propounded by the Sunnis.61141 Both the sects follow the principle of awarding newly entitled heirs half of the share of the already established agnatic heirs and provide a uniform scheme for devolution of property irrespective of the sex or marital status of the intestate, making consanguinity the basis for determination of the title to succession.62142 Further, both derecognise adoption63143 and disqualify illegitimate children of male intestates,64144 non-Muslims,65145 and the murderer66146 of an intestate from inheriting the property of the deceased. Under Shia law, barrenness of a widow disqualifies her from inheriting the immovable property of her deceased husband. The principle of representation is not resorted to at all by the Shias while the Sunnis use it for ascertaining the shares of the various heirs.67147 Under Shia law, the rule of nearer in degree excluding the more remote is applied strictly while Sunnis do admit some exceptions to it.68148 The claim of the sharers who have fixed shares is to be satisfied first; the residue of the property then passes on to the residuaries.69149 In the absence of residuaries, the property reverts to sharers who are entitled to the residue as well. The principle of the property coming back to the sharers is called ‘radd’. In presence of any other heir, the surviving spouse is not entitled to the ‘radd’ and it is only in the absence of the heirs mentioned in all the three categories that the spouse can claim the property.70150 Under Shia law the doctrine of ‘radd’ has further exceptions. A mother is not entitled to any ‘radd’ in the presence of the intestate’s father, daughter, two or more full or consanguine brothers or one such brother and two sisters (full or consanguine) or four such sisters. Further, a uterine brother or sister is not entitled to the return in presence of a full-blood sister.71151 The Shias do not recognise the category of distant kindred; for them, apart from sharers, the rest of the heirs are residuaries. In case the sum total of the shares which all the sharers are together entitled to succeed to exceeds unity, the shares are proportionately deducted following the doctrine of ‘Aul’ (increase) and the sharers thus get the reduced shares. The Shias do not recognise the doctrine of ‘Aul’. In case the sum total of shares allotted to the sharers exceeds unity, the fraction in excess here is to be deducted from the share of the daughters and sisters (full or consanguine).72152 Both Sunnis and Shias recognise rights of succession without any limitation on the number of degrees the heir may be removed from the intestate. PARSI LAW The Parsi community in India initially had no law of their own.73153 While preserving their separate identity they had adopted the customs of residents of the area where they had first taken shelter.74154 These customary laws, mainly\n\nPage 9 of 18 INTRODUCTION LAWS OF INTESTATE AND TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION IN INDIA of the Hindu and Muslim communities, underwent various modifications following a series of enactments75155 passed for Parsis by the British Indian legislature. The present law, though considerably modified and vitally different from the initial customary laws, still indicate the deep influence of Hindu and Muslim laws on the Parsi system of inheritance. Following the principle of Muslim law a Parsi male was allowed to take double of the share of a female standing in the same degree of propinquity till it was amended in 1991 and made equal for all the children.76156 Like Hindus, Parsis also include affinity and not merely consanguinity as the determining factor for title to succession. Consequently, Parsi law recognises as heirs, widows of descendants, and widows of brothers of the intestate.77157 A unique feature of Parsi law having no parallel under any other system is the recognition of the widower of a female lineal descendant as also sister’s as an heir.78158 Agnates are preferred to cognates and uterine blood is relegated to an inferior placement.79159 Illegitimacy and remarriage of a widow prior to the death of the intestate operate as a disqualification and succession rights are recognised till unlimited degrees of relationship. Adoption is not recognised for the purposes of succession80160 while the principle of representation is recognised ad infinitum for all the heirs. THE INDIAN SUCCESSION ACT, 1925 The Indian Succession Act, 1925, incorporates the Roman and English principles of inheritance. A uniform scheme is provided irrespective of the sex of the intestate. Consanguinity is the determining factor for title to succession and relations by affinity are excluded from the list of heirs. The Act derecognises adoption81161 for the purposes of inheritance and difference of religion between the heir and the intestate is of no consequence. The preference of succession is determined in terms of nearness in relation to the deceased. Accordingly, surviving spouse and lineal descendants are made the primary heirs.82162 The principles of representation apply without any reservations to lineal descendants and with some restrictions to the brothers and sisters of the deceased and their descendants.83163 In all other cases the general rule of nearer in degree excluding the more remote applies.84164The Act treats agnates and cognates85165 and male and female heirs equally. All blood relations whether full-blood, half-blood or uterine blood are treated on par.86166 The only gender discriminatory provision is the exclusion of the mother in presence of the father.87167 The Act concentrates on securing the rights of the widow of a deceased with special provisions in case of small estates.88168 Succession rights in favour of collaterals are recognised only upto six degrees of ascent plus descent, i.e., till the second cousins. Collateral relatives standing in remoter degrees are not entitled to succeed following this limit.89169 CHRISTIANS IN THE STATE OF GOA AND UNION TERRITORIES OF DAMAN AND DIU The uniform law of the State of Goa and the Union Territories of Daman and Diu is the Portuguese Civil Code, 1867.90170 Based on the Napoleonic Code, it provides for a uniform scheme of succession for all intestates and keeps consanguinity as the basis for determination of title to succession. The rights of inheritance are limited to six degrees, i.e., cousin germane or second cousin. The principle of representation is recognised only for descendants, for others the rule of nearer in blood excluding the more remote applies. Agnates and cognates, male and female heirs have identical rights. Full-blood relations do not exclude half-blood or uterine relations but in their presence, the share of the later is reduced to half of the share of the full-blood relations. The half-blood and uterine blood relations are, however, treated on par vis-a-vis each other.91171 The surviving spouse is relegated to a very inferior placement but her rights are to be viewed in light of the antenuptial contract which makes her owner of half of the community of assets.92172 Adoption is treated on par with natural birth while illegitimate children who have been accorded recognition by their parents or with respect to whom a declaration from the court has been obtained,93173 are entitled to a share equal to two-thirds of the share of a legitimate child.94174 LAW RELATING TO RENOCANTS OF PONDICHERRY The French Civil Code, 1804 The principles of the French Civil Code, 1804 are similar to those of the Portuguese Civil Code, 1867, already discussed above, as the latter is based on the former. A uniform scheme is provided irrespective of the sex of an intestate. The criterion to succeed is blood relationship. Preference is given to descendants over ascendants who in turn are preferred to collaterals. Succession rights of collaterals are recognised till the sixth degree only.95175 The turn of the spouse to inherit comes only when none of the blood relations is present.96176 The rule of representation\n\nPage 10 of 18 INTRODUCTION LAWS OF INTESTATE AND TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION IN INDIA is allowed only for lineal descendants of an intestate. For others, the rule of nearer in blood excluding the remoter, applies. Illegitimate children whose affiliation to the parents is proved, (either by parental recognition or by a decree of a court given at the suit of the child), have secured inheritance rights and can even exclude the spouse of the deceased.97177 Their share depends upon the other co-heirs. It is half of the share of the legitimate child in presence of descendants1178 and is three-fourth of the total property in presence of ascendants or the brothers or sisters of the deceased or their descendants.2179 Religion of an heir is immaterial. Following the rule of public policy, any heir who has either committed the murder of the intestate or abetted it, will be, alongwith his heirs, disqualified from inheriting the property of the deceased.3180 LAWS OF TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION INTRODUCTION India has a variety of laws based on considerations of religion and domicile of the testator, for testamentary succession. However, the number of systems operative in this area is far less in comparison to the laws governing intestate succession. The general law of the land for regulating testamentary succession to the separate property of an Indian is the Indian Succession Act, 1925.4181The Act also applies to the undivided interest of a Hindu in a Mitakshara coparcenary and to the member of a Tarvad, Tawazhi, Illom, Kutumba or Kavaru in the property of a Tarvad, Tawazhi, Illom, Kutumba or Kavaru.5182 It however is inapplicable to: (i)\n\nMuslims;6183\n\n(ii) Indians domiciled in the State of Goa and Union Territories of Daman and Diu;7184 (iii) renocants of the Union Territory of Pondicherry.8185 Muslims are governed by the Quranic law. The procedural rules of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, with some reservations, also apply to Indian Muslims.9186 The substantive law of the Sunnis and Shia Muslims differs on minor points.10187 All Indians domiciled in the State of Goa and the Union Territories of Daman and Diu irrespective of their religion are governed by the Portuguese Civil Code, 1867.11188 The Renocants of Union Territory of Pondicherry are governed by the provisions of the French Civil Code, 1804.12189 RULES OF TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION Under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, a person has a power to make a Will or a Testament of the totality of his separate property. The inability of a coparcener to bequeath his undivided share in the coparcenary property and other family corporations governed by the matriarchal system has been removed by the Act. He can now validly make a Will of his undivided interest in the coparcenary property and other family corporations.13190 As regards Hindus of Goa, Daman and Diu, the system of community of interest applies.14191 The spouses are prohibited from making a testamentary disposition of their property unless the other spouse gives consent. With respect to the other properties the restrictions vary with different survivors.15192 Further, individuals who could have easily influenced the mind of a testator are prevented from being the beneficiaries of the legacy.16193 The general limit imposed on the testamentary powers of a Muslim is to the extent of one-third of his property. A bequest in excess of one-third requires validation from the heirs whose share is likely to be adversely affected. A slight divergence can be seen under the Sunni and Shia laws with respect to a bequest to an heir.17194The Parsis and all Indians who are subject to the application of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 can make a Will of the totality of their property as the Act has not placed any impediments or restrictions on their power to make a Will of their property.18195\n\n1.\n\nThe term ‘intestate succession’ is used to denote the laws relating to inheritance. The property of a person, on his or her death, in absence of instructions left by him or her with respect to its devolution, devolves in accordance with the law of intestate succession to which the deceased was subject to at the time of his or her death.\n\n2.\n\nThe term ‘testamentary succession’ refers to devolution of property through a testament or a Will. A Will that is capable of taking effect in law governs succession to the property of a person after his or her death in accordance with the rules laid down in the laws governing testamentary succession to the property of a person to which he or she was subject at the time of his or her death. Diversity prevails in the laws of testamentary succession also, yet it is not as varied as in case of laws of inheritance or intestate succession.\n\nPage 11 of 18 INTRODUCTION LAWS OF INTESTATE AND TESTAMENTARY SUCCESSION IN INDIA 3.\n\nThe term ‘major’ refers to the Hindu, the Muslim and the Parsi laws. Besides these, there were, and still are, prevailing, a large number of statutory and customary laws applicable to different communities.\n\n4.\n\nThe classical Hindu law is part of Dharma while the Muslim law is enjoined in the Holy Quran, the traditions of the rophet, legislative enactments and judicial decisions. The Parsi law in India was based on the principles of the then existing laws of the Hindus and the Muslims.\n\n5.\n\nAbraham v. Abraham, 9 MIA 105. The Privy Council observed that such of those Indian Christians who were Hindu converts and were still following the Hindu customs and manners would be governed by the ancient Hindu law of succession.\n\n6.\n\nNative Christians thus had a right to elect the law, which would apply to them. See Devadasan, Christian Law in India, 1974, p. 297.\n\n7.\n\nA person is said to be an agnate of another, if the two are related to each other wholly through a chain of male relatives and a cognate if they are related to each other but not wholly through male relatives. Thus, even if a single female relative intervenes in between the heir and the intestate, the relationship is that of a cognate.\n\n8.\n\nThe Travancore Christian Succession Act, 1916; The Cochin Christian Succession Act, 1921. For the applicability of the Act, see the discussion infra.\n\n9.\n\nBy the Constitution (Fourteenth Amendment) Act, 1962.\n\n10. Goa, Daman and Diu (Administration) Act, 1962, s. 5(i); and in accordance with the Treaty of Cession entered into between the Indian and the French Government. 11. The term ‘Hindu’ means and includes ‘Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains’. 12. See s. section 2 of The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, which provides that the Act is not applicable to any scheduled tribe within the meaning of cl. 25 of Art. 366 of the Constitution, unless the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, directs otherwise. 13. See The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, ss. 8–13 and ss. 15–16. Prior to the enactment of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, there were two major systems of inheritance besides a number of customary laws, prevailing in India, viz., Mitakshara for the whole of India except Bengal where Dayabhaga law was operative. Apart from the difference in the devolution of property between these two systems, there was a division of sub-schools in Mitakshara, which differed on certain aspects of rules governing the laws of succession. With the objective of codification and bringing about uniformity, along with introducing some basic changes, the Hindu Succession Act was passed in 1956, after stiff resistance from the traditionalists. It was one in a series of enactments purporting to change the personal law of Hindus, promulgated originally by the ancient seers. 14. See The Constitution of India, cl. (25) of Art. 366. It defines ‘scheduled tribes’ as such tribes or communities as are deemed under Art. 342, to be scheduled tribes for the purposes of the Constitution. Article 342 also authorises the President of India to specify, by notification, the scheduled tribes in various States and Union Territories. Both the President and the Parliament have exercised their powers and presently there exist a large number of constitutionally recognised scheduled tribes in various parts of India. Section 2(2) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, applies to all such tribes. 15. Dasarath v. Guru Bewa, AIR 1972 Ori 78 [LNIND 1971 ORI 42]; Gopal Singh v. Giribala, AIR 1991 Pat 138 ; see also Ganja Devi v. State of Himachal Pradesh, 1997(2) HLR 733 (DB) wherein it was held that no writ of mandamus can be issued by the court to apply the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, to the tribal areas of Himachal Pradesh. The Act has been held inapplicable to the Bathudis of Orissa, see Dasarath v. Gura Bewa, AIR 1972 Ori 78 [LNIND 1971 ORI 42]; Kandan v. Jitan, AIR 1973 Pat 206 .

On the date of commencement of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Pondicherry, Goa, Daman and Diu were not parts of India and the Act therefore did not apply to them. The enactment annexing them to the Union of India provided that the Central Government may, by notification, extend any enactment in force to these areas. Section 5(1) of the Constitution of India (Twelfth Amendment) Act, 1962, provided that the Portuguese laws in force in Goa, Daman and Diu were protected in their application to the inhabitants of these territories. By virtue of Regulation 6 of 1963, the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was extended to Pondicherry; however, a specific provision in s. 2A in this Act makes the Act inapplicable to the Renocants of Pondicherry. With respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, by virtue of Art. 370 of the Constitution of India, the Union Parliament’s power to legislate in this state is limited to matters specified in the Union and the Concurrent Lists only. In 1954, pursuant to the President of India’s order, the Concurrent List was excluded from the Seventh Schedule in its application to the State of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore the Parliament has no jurisdiction to apply the Act to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Their distinct laws thus govern the Hindus of the State of Jammu and Kashmir in matters of succession to their property. 25. Mayne, Hindu Law and Usage, 11th edition, (ed.

The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, ss. 7 and 17. 31. Prior to 1962, the territories of Goa, Daman and Diu were Portuguese colonies commonly known as overseas provinces of Portugal. The Portuguese Civil Code, 1867, which was enforced in Portugal in 1868, was extended to its overseas provinces with effect from 1870. In 1961, Goa was liberated and in the following year, the Constitution of India was amended. In 1962 itself, the legislation affecting Goa namely, the Goa, Daman and Diu (Administration) Act, 1962, was passed. Section 5(1) of this Act provided, ‘All laws in force immediately before the appointed date, in Goa, Daman and Diu or any part thereof, shall continue to be in force therein until amended or repealed by a competent legislation or competent authority’. 32. The laws relating to succession, testamentary and intestate are covered under arts. 1735–2166, which included administration of estates and distribution of assets. 33.

Prior to the revelation of the Quran, the general law of the inhabitants of the Arabian peninsula differed from tribe to tribe as each tribe was governed by its own laws based largely on the unwritten customs. 39. Apart from these four schools, two for the Sunni Muslims and two for the Shia Muslims, three more schools are recognised under the Islamic law. Out of these, the Maliki and the Hanbali schools are adhered to by the Sunnis while the Zaidy school is followed by the Shias. India however, does not have followers of these schools. 40. The Sunni and the Shia division in the Muslim community have no legal or theological basis. Both believe in Allah and accept the Quran as the ultimate authority. It is only a historical coincidence that out of the seven schools developed in Muslim law four were by Sunni jurists and three by the Shias. 41. N. Venugopala Ravi Varma Rajah v.

The situation had arisen as a sizeable population of Indian Muslims included the descendants of Hindu converts, who, even after conversion, from the Hindu faith, continued observing Hindu customs in matters of inheritance, e.g., in Western India, Khojas, Cutchi Memons, Halai Memons, Sunni Bohras and Molesalam Girasias continued following the principles of Hindu customary law. Similarly in Southern India, the Moplas were following the Marumakkattayam law of matriarchal succession. See Puthiva v. Thavata (1956) 1 MLJ 119 [LNIND 1955 MAD 235].

The first permanent Parsi settlement in India was at a village called Sanjan (still in existence) in Gujarat around the year 716 AD. This place was then ruled by the Hindu Chief Jadi Rana, who gave the Parsis permission to settle there and reside on four conditions that were: (a) that the Parsis would adopt the language of the country; (b)that they would not bear arms; (c)that their women would dress in Hindu fashion; and (d) that they would perform their marriage ceremonies after sunset in accordance with Hindu customs. The Parsis scrupulously observed these conditions. 47. PL Paruck, The Indian Succession Act, 1925, 9th edn., (eds SS Subramani and K. Kannan), Lexisnexis Butterworths, 2002, pp. 107–116. 48.

See the Indian Succession (Amendment) Act, Act 18 of 1939. 50. Indian Succession (Amendment) Act, Act 18 of 1939. 51. In 1991, the Act was amended to give absolute gender parity to Parsi women in matters of succession. The shares of the parents and that of the son and daughter were made equal. The Act provided a uniform scheme of succession for Indian Parsis. 52. See the discussion, supra. 53. Mary Roy v.

After 1961, the applicability of three legislations was extended to these territories: (i)Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1886; (ii)The Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969; and (iii)The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1978. 67. This was reiterated by the French Constitution of 1946, as well as by the French Constitution of 1958, which provided that French nationals if they were not subjects to the common law of the country, namely the French personal law as embodied in the Civil Code, would continue to be governed by their own personal law. 68.

Added to these two, was the completely different system of matriachate, prevalent among the Hindus in some parts of South India, parts of Himachal Pradesh and parts of North-east India. 87 There are four states which have, after the amendment to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, introduced unmarried daughters as coparceners in exactly the same manner as the sons. These states are Andhra Pradesh (in 1985), Tamil Nadu (in 1989), Maharashtra and Karnataka (in 1994). Daughters have been introduced as coparceners by the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005. 88 Mayne, Hindu Law and Usage, 12th edn., (ed. Kuppuswami), 1986, p. 744. 89 Jadunath v.

See Shyam Sunder v. State of Bihar, AIR 1981 SC 178 [LNIND 1980 SC 271].

Hindus currently form a population of around 800M, and Hindu law applies to a vast majority of them. Trying to trace the original source of Hindu law has some difficulties as it means going back to a point of time in the past when written material was unavailable and most of the communication was oral. During the early period, there was no distinction between religion, law and morality, and they were cumulatively referred to as ‘Dharma’. The ‘Shrutis’ (primarily the Vedas), the ‘Smritis’ (the memorised word) and the ‘Sadachara’ are considered the three sources of Dharma and consequently the sources of Hindu law. Yet, at the same time it is difficult to comprehend that before the Shrutis, society existed without any rules or regulations. However, due to dearth of historical evidence of that period, it is difficult to locate when exactly such rules and regulations came into existence. The description of society in the Vedas, which, if taken as a starting point of the source of Hindu law, reveals not a nomadic society but a considerably advanced society. Therefore, it is imperative that such a civilised society should have had certain laws or well-established norms, and recognised customs necessary for its good governance. From the description of such a society, one can discern that there existed a clear emphasis on the practice of Dharma signifying the privileges, duties and obligations of a man.1 Hindu Dharma is therefore so ancient that it is difficult to put it into a time frame. Hence, in explaining the sources of Hindu law, when no other evidence is available, Shrutis become a convenient point to start. In order to add a touch of authenticity and unique authority, an element of divinity has been attached to it initially by the original interpreters, preachers and custodians of law, and later by courts and the writers of Hindu law.2 Presently, Hindu law as administered by the courts is found in: (i)\n\nShrutis\n\n(ii) Smritis (iii) Commentaries and Digests (iv) Customs (v) Judicial decisions (vi) Legislative enactments\n\nSHRUTIS The term ‘Shru’ means ‘to hear’ and refers to the four Vedas with their respective Brahmanas. Originating in the opinion of individual sages, imparted by oral tradition and preserved as well as supplemented by their families and disciples, they all date from the period of transition from Vedic institution and culture to the Brahmanic mode of thought and social order. Each of the Vedas comprises two parts—Samhita and Brahma. The former is primarily a collection of hymns or mantras praising God and the latter a theological explanation of the former. The Brahmanas are ritualistic treatises that enjoin sacrifices and explain their meanings. They give injunctions as to the performance of sacrificial acts and explain their origin. They also specify the occasions on which mantras are to be used; sometimes adding illustrations and reasons and sometimes also including mystical and philosophical speculations.\n\nPage 2 of 19 CHAPTER 1 SOURCES OF HINDU LAW Mantras literally mean ‘thoughts’ (of primeval saints) centered upon that divine light which illumines the darkest recesses of the human mind. They were either invocations or prayers, or hymns in praise of the Almighty. The Vedas were originally three in number—Rigveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda. At a later point of time a fourth one, Atharvaveda, was added. While Rigveda is rich in sacred mantras, Samaveda and Yajurveda freely borrowed it from Rigveda. Therefore, Rigveda is described as a tree while the other two as its offshoots, though all of them are held in highest veneration. Yajurveda is divided into two schools, with their textbooks being referred to as Black and White Yaju, the former known as ‘Taittiriya Sanhita’ and the latter ‘Vajasaneya Sanhita’. The ‘Taittiriya Brahmana’ is attached to the former while ‘Satapatha Brahmana’ to the latter. ‘Gopatha Brahmana’ is associated with Atharvaveda.3 The Vedas contain no statement of law as such but their statements of facts find occasional reference in the Smritis and commentaries and as conclusive evidence of local usage.4 The hymns of the Vedas reflect the social conditions of Hindus as not that of pastoral or nomadic people but as an advanced stage of civilisation. Hindu society during the Vedic age was an aggregation of patriarchal families. Each family was a complete unit in itself with the management vested in the oldest living ascendant, called the master of the household or the ‘Grihapati’. The patriarch was the ruler, legislator, judge, counselor and spiritual guide, all rolled into one. He had absolute authority and all the members of the household blindly followed his behest. He was the absolute master of the family property and exercised supreme control over persons and property of family members. His dominion extended even to the lives and deaths of members. Rules laid down by him for the management of the family estate could not be interfered with and his verdict had no appeal against it. The patriarch administered his own laws and differed the application according to individual circumstances. The patriarch’s word was the law and at the root of his dictates was the promotion of family interests for which individual personal interests could be sacrificed. The traditions of the patriarchal family of the Vedic age must have formed the basis of family law. With the gradual recognition of an individual as an entity distinct from the family, social necessities outgrowing family wants, and increase in business transactions, there arose a need for defining accurately social relations. A body of rules defining uniform conduct in different social relations and laying down provisions for breach of social agreement alongwith a civil government to protect public interests became necessary. This necessity supplied the legal aphorisms.5 Thus, with a view to cement the union of different social elements and promote the collective happiness of different social groups and individual members, jurists undertook the mammoth task of creating a body of laws with the ancient and approved customs as the primary guide.6 These aphorisms were of two types: one based on the Vedas and the other on traditions and customs. They were further subdivided into domestic (grihya)7 and those relating to law and government called the sutras, i.e., Dharmasutras. The study of the ceremonial and legal aphorism was inseparable for a long time; yet, the distinction was evident as ceremonial aphorism belonged to religion while Dharmasutra comprised civil matters. Since spiritual interests held more importance for man than temporal interests, the study of Dharmasutra was neglected and the spiritual brotherhood engaged themselves in the cultivation of a ceremonial branch of law. This religious law is guarded with jealous care even now while Dharmasutra is left to the administration. Gradually, with the firm establishment of a civil government, decay in patriarchal powers and enlargement of civil rights, administration of law and justice was taken out of the hands of the spiritual brotherhoods and entrusted to specific tribunals for enforcing civil obligations that monopolised administration of law with progress of kingly powers. Such an establishment demanded obedience of people and diminished the influence of spiritual brotherhood8 in areas that affected the life of people with respect to outsiders (public sphere). Priests or the spiritual brotherhood retained supremacy over matters connected with personal lives and religious rites. An important factor of the doctrine of spiritual brotherhood was the conferment of exclusive privileges by them on their group and a denial of the same to the other three castes: Kshatriya Vaishys & Shudra. The Charanas were confined to the priestly castes and laws were made by them. This resulted in unequal treatment of the members of other castes. The section of the community excluded by the Brahmanas from the community of religion found acceptance in Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Virashaivism and later the Bhakti movement etc, which with slight variations preached equality and tried to unite different classes of society with a common bond. This was a result of the oppressive Brahminical hold over the scriptures and the Sanskrit language. In retaliation these reformers preached in the local language of the common people, denounced caste based hierarchies and concepts of purity and pollution laid down under the Smritis, and encouraged promotion of brotherhood and equality of human beings. Instead of elaborate rituals, they insisted on simple and practical ceremonies for matrimonial matters, peaceful co-existence and better status to women and lower caste Hindus.\n\nPage 3 of 19 CHAPTER 1 SOURCES OF HINDU LAW Marching slowly with these revolutions, kings deprived the spiritual brotherhood of legislative and executive powers with respect to matters relating to civil government and laws of property. Thus, the legal aphorisms, the Dharmasutras, were taken out of their possession while the Vedic ceremonial aphorisms and domestic sacraments i.e., the Dharmashastras were still their sacred heirloom.9 As already pointed out, with the spiritual brotherhood having no concern whatsoever with the study and preservation of ancient Dharmasutras, the study of these legal maxims has been almost totally neglected and their application in practice completely discontinued.\n\nSMRITIS The second source of Hindu Law after the Vedas are institutes or manuals known by the collective name of ‘Smritis’ authored by great medieval authorities on Hindu Law called ‘Rishis’ or Sages. The Smritikars were neither kings, nor religious heads, nor legislators.10 They were philosophers, social thinkers and teachers. From spiritual to temporal, the entire code of conduct of life was preached by them in the form of Dharma covering a very wide range of topics including amongst others, behaviour and relations between husband and wife, father and son, and other members of the family towards each other, rules of exogamy and endogamy, punishment for sexual improprieties, rituals of birth, death and marriage, worship and sacrifice, philosophy of Karma and rebirth, social behaviour between men and women of different castes, duties of individuals in their various stages of life, rules of governance, principles of punishment and warfare for kings and officials, civil or financial matters like rules of contracts, property devolution, mortgage and interest rates. Some of these rules were mandatory while others were merely recommended as appropriate conduct. The legal aspects were known as ‘vyavahara’ while the personal, religious or moral aspects were called ‘ahara’. At that time, the art of writing was unknown and knowledge was imparted orally by a teacher to his disciple. Such communication of these precepts in every generation inevitably led to modifications and inclusions of customs or traditions of that age by the disciples into the Smritis. Smritis are classified into: I.\n\n(a) Dharmasutras or aphorisms of law\n\n(b) Fragments of aphoristic treatises II.\n\n(a) Metrical redactions of Dharmasutras\n\nIII. (a) Independent metrical or prose treatise (b) Fragments of metrical treatises11 The exact number of Smritis is not conclusively established as different jurists put their number differently.12 The most important for the purposes of Hindu law are three—Manu Smriti, Yajnavalkya Smriti and Narada Smriti. Manu, Yajnavalkya and Narada followed each other in point of time. Manu Smriti Of the numerous Smritis, the foremost in rank or authority is the Manu Smriti, a view that is subscribed to by the other Smritikars.13 The fact that it is the most ancient of all the metrical Smritis is evident by a general survey of the work of Manu, Yajnavalkya and Narada which reveals the promulgation of their works in different ages and also that Manu was the oldest member of the triad and Narada the youngest. The Manu Smriti was compiled around 200 BC. There is, however, some mystery regarding the identity of the real author of Manu Smriti. Manu was accepted as the first expositor of law. This law existed before writing was invented; hence, human memory was its sole repository.14 It continued to grow while being handed down for centuries from preceptor to disciple in succession. Therefore, it is hard to confirm the original contribution of Manu and his predecessors and determine how much was supplemented by later writers. Hence, under the name of Manu a huge bulk of opinions of different ages have been recorded. Manu Smriti thus was compiled at a later date and was not in the Vedic language. It is a collection of current laws and creeds rather than a systematic digest with theological and metaphysical speculations all mixed up15 with moral precepts and legal maxims. The extant Code of Manu is divided into twelve chapters. In the eighth chapter are stated rules on eighteen titles of law16 including both civil and\n\nPage 4 of 19 CHAPTER 1 SOURCES OF HINDU LAW criminal law. Laws of inheritance, property, contracts, partnership, master and servant are some of the branches of law comprising the Code.17 The work shows that Manu was a protagonist of Brahminical revival giving Brahmins an eminent position in the society18 and treating women and Shudras harshly. One of the most important point to be noted about Manu Smriti is the supreme authority that it vests with the king to uphold and implement the law. With a view to strengthen the power of implementation of law, it specified the duties of the king, implored him to give adequate recognition to customs and usages in deciding the disputes and recommended the use of sanction in case of disobedience of the law by the subjects or in other appropriate cases. Yajnavalkya Smriti Next in point of time as also in authority was Yajnavalkya who according to Max Mueller flourished in the period between Buddha and Vikramaditya. His work refers to Buddhist habits and doctrines. Yajnavalkya Smriti, compiled in about the first century after Christ, was, in comparison to Manu Smriti, more concise and systematically arranged and more liberal than Manu especially in the recognition of woman’s rights to hold and inherit property and the status of Shudras. His punishments were less severe than those specified by Manu and though he was also in support of Brahminic revival, his work shows an influence of Buddhist teachings. Yajnavalkya did not treat the king as having a divine right to implement the law but implored him to look after the administration of justice with righteousness and modesty. His work dealt elaborately with laws of partnership, mortgages and hypothecation and laid special emphasis on laws of procedure and evidence; an aspect not adequately dealt with in Manu Smriti. It separated legal matters from theological and metaphysical theories and domestic and civil duties, of administration of justice and of the regulation as to purification and penance in three separate books. It was originally written in verse and bore no connection to the aphoristic works of any Vedic school. Several commentaries were written on this Smriti, the predominant among them was Mitakshara. It virtually became the starting point of Hindu law for the Hindus of the areas governed by it. Narada Smriti Narada Smriti was compiled around 400–500 AD19 after the start of the Brahminical reaction to the spreading of Buddhism. Narada was a Nepali sage and gave a Code unhampered by religious and moral preaching. He was more broadminded than both Manu and Yajnavalkya and this fact is evident by the recognition in his work of widow’s remarriage, a woman’s power to hold and inherit property and father’s absolute rights to gift his separate property to his sons. He postulated supremacy of king-made law over that provided for in Smritis. He provided that rules and ordinances issued by kings were superior to even established customs and texts and could override them in cases of conflict. Though based on Manu Smriti, it was much liberal as it was compiled later in point of time. Stating the law in a straightforward manner and logical sequence, the work deals with law of partnership, gifts, inheritance, ownership of property and its hypothecation. A unique feature of this Smriti was laying down of rules with respect to pleadings, evidence of witnesses and procedure. A comparison of laws of ordeals, the rule of judicial procedures, regulations with respect to gambling and maxims relating to law of property as they are treated by these institutes can show clear and distinctive traces of growth in the work of these sages. In terms of advancement, Narada Smriti shows a greater degree of advancement than Yajnavalkya. Similarly, the law of commerce is fully developed in Yajnavalkya and Narada while Manu’s law on this subject was still in a crude stage. Among the commentaries written on Narada Smriti, Narada Bhashya by Ashaya is important.\n\nCOMMENTARIES Although the Vedas are considered to be of paramount importance by jurists, they do not contain positive law. Hence, rules of family and social relations expounded by the commentaries and digests became very important. Gradual development of society gave rise to complex situations and multifaceted problems. This necessitated the need for codification of law for offering authoritative explanation for real or apparent contradictions, the answer to which was also sought in approved legal treatises bearing the name of sages and when a solution was sought for in these authorities, emergence of contradictions amongst these texts was a puzzling phenomenon. All of these medieval legislators were considered independent authorities on disputed points of law. The belief was firm that there could neither be any contradiction between the words of the inspired sages nor could they err. Whatever contradiction appeared on the surface was a result of defective understanding of mortals incapable of discerning\n\nPage 5 of 19 CHAPTER 1 SOURCES OF HINDU LAW the real meaning or significance of these sacred texts. Thus, the fault lay not with the lawgivers but with the interpreter. Therefore, if they were correctly interpreted there would be no room for contradictions and a consistency would be found on virtually every point. However, as the situation then existed, all these sacred authorities were of equal importance; one could not be preferred over the other and with the contradictions and absence of clear authority for application of a specific provision, adjudication became virtually impossible, throwing the law in a state of anarchy. Though infallibility of the sages held paramount sway as questioning it meant an attempt to sap the foundation of the Hindu religion yet growing consensus favoured a remoulding or even alteration of the old laws. Two options were available at this stage, one to repeal old laws and enact new ones to suit the changing needs of time and society, and the other to retain the old foundation and repair or alter it. Not only did the guardians of Hindu religion protected these sacred authorities with zealous care but public opinion was also vehemently against repealing them. Thus only, the latter option was feasible. At this point of time commentators capable of entering the spirit of law entered the scenario, to explain the most appropriate interpretation of law while explaining these writings of the sages. In this manner, the apparently conflicting or contradictory statements of the lawgivers were reconciled to bring in the desired need for uniformity and clarity. This resulted in the writing of commentaries on the sacred texts or Smritis. The primary purpose was to explain the true meaning incorporated in it for achieving a uniformity and consistency to enable the society to march forward in accordance with the rule of law. Medhatithi As no Code that contradicted Manu’s was approved, a number of commentaries on Manu Smriti came to be written as expositions of the inner meaning of his rules. The earliest of these commentaries is that of Medhatithi, son of Bhatta Birasvani. He was not only a mere expositor but read between the lines and while giving explanations to Manu’s texts in fact advanced opinion conducive to the requirements of his time and wherever necessary, supported his views by resorting to other authorities. The exposition given by him was authoritative and could not be contradicted by other commentators. Though the work flourished around the 10th century, it was recast and rehabilitated at the end of the 12th century by Prince Madanpala of Kashthanagara. Medhatithi was soon followed by Srikara, Dharesvara, Bisvarupa and Vijananeshwara in the 11th century. Mitakshara Mitakshara is a commentary on Yajnavalkya Smriti by Vijananeshwara20 as told to him by his Guru Visvarupa21 and written in the later half of the eleventh century. It is also called Riju Mitakshara Tika or Riju Sam Mitakshara or Parmitakshara. Vijananeshwara, in the introduction to his commentary, mentions that the Code of Yajnavalkya was explained to him by his Guru Visvarupa in a hard and diffused language and the same has been abridged by him in a simple and concise style. Mitakshara literally means ‘a brief compendium’. The work is not merely confined to a specific commentary but encompasses within itself the quintessence of the Smriti law and its precepts and injunctions, giving it the colour of a digest. Vijananeshwara explains the meaning of recondite passages, supplies omissions and reconciles discrepancies by frequent references to other old expounders of law,22 thus analysing the Yajnavalkya Smriti in great detail and synthesising the various Smriti texts. He deals with several important topics of law, classifying them with reasonable precision without any antiquarian trifling or wild philosophical discussions. The intrinsic worth of this treatise made it a juridical work inspiring others to write commentaries on it.23 By the 11th century, the country was formed into powerful and independent states often with rivalry among them. Distinct customs and usages were sometimes recognised as a superior force to the medieval laws. Thus, the legislators of"
