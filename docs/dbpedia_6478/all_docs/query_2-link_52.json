The total area of the town is 156.03 km¬≤ (60.24 sq mi). Karuizawa is one of the oldest and most famous summer resorts in Japan, loved by many people from different countries since the 19th century.\n\n1\n\nGeography Karuizawa is located in eastern Nagano Prefecture, bordered by Gunma Prefecture to the north, east and south. The town is located on an elevated plain at the foot of Mount Asama, one of Japan's most active volcanoes. The mountain is classed as a Category A active volcano. A small eruption was detected in June 2015, a more significant eruption spewing hot rocks and a plume of ash occurred in February 2015. Mt.

The UWC ISAK Japan international school is also located in the town.\n\n1\n\nTransport: Rail ‚Ä¢ East Japan Railway Company ‚Äì Hokuriku Shinkansen ‚Ä¢ Karuizawa ‚Ä¢ Shinano Railway ‚Ä¢ Karuizawa ‚Äì Naka-Karuizawa ‚Äì Shinano-Oiwake.\n\n1\n\nTransport: Road ‚Ä¢ J≈çshin-etsu Expressway ‚Ä¢ National Route 18 ‚Ä¢ National Route 146.\n\n1\n\nLocal attractions With its comparatively cool summer weather, its cold refreshing nights, its heavy air-clearing showers, its southern aspect, and its position close to some of the most picturesque mountain scenery of Japan, Karuizawa leaves little to be desired as a summer retreat. ‚Äî Cargill Gilston Knott, \"Notes on the Summer Climate of Karuizawa\", 1891\n\n‚Ä¶ while quite recently even Japanese gentlemen of high degree have begun to build houses and introduce their families. As in so many other cases, the world followed the lead of the missionaries. Foreigners are now the raison d‚Äô√©tre of Karuizawa, and no echo of Feudalism haunts the hills. ‚Äî Ernest Foxwell, \"A Tale of Karuizawa\", 1903\n\nKaruizawa, the most popular summer resort in the whole of the Far East [‚Ä¶]. ‚Äî Arthur Lloyd, \"Every-day Japan\", 1909\n\nKaruizawa was developed as a European-style resort town by a Scottish-Canadian missionary in 1888. In the following decades, the town attracted visitors from across the country seeking to escape the heat of summer and enjoy vacations, as well as a significant number of Westerners. Unlike many other hill stations, Karuizawa was actively open to the natives from the beginning, and many Japanese scholars, artists and others had already built \"Western-style\" villas in the town by the early 20th century. The Japanese and Western communities interacted well with each other through summer recreation activities and the like. In the 21st century the town retains significant Western cultural influence, and its alpine beauty and cool summer climate (similar to parts of Europe) continue to draw visitors.\n\nMore recently, Karuizawa has become a popular year-round resort for mainly Japanese, offering many outdoor sports, hot springs and recreational activities. Convenient road and rail access from central Tokyo has ensured Karuizawa's popularity as a location for second homes and resort hotels since the Meiji era.\n\nKaruizawa is known for its historic shopping street known as \"Ginza d≈çri\" or \"Ky≈´-d≈ç\" (Ginza Street, or the Old Road) and association with both Japanese royalty and visitors such as John Lennon and Yoko Ono. As a side note, The Crown Prince Akihito met Michiko Shoda for the first time on a tennis court in Karuizawa in August 1957, and John Lennon spent several summers in Karuizawa with his family in the late 1970s.\n\nKaruizawa hosted equestrian events in the 1964 Summer Olympics as well as curling in the 1998 Winter Olympics. It is the first city in the world to host both Summer and Winter Olympic events.\n\nSince 1997, Karuizawa has been accessible via the JR East Nagano Shinkansen. New high speed rail links has resulted in modest population growth and the development of large outlet style shopping malls.\n\n1"
