Check train times, bus schedules, find fares or rent a car.\n\nTokyo to Nagano | Tokyo to Myoko Kogen\n\nNote:\n\nForÂ highway bus, taxi and carÂ travel access informationÂ click here\n\nFor access fromÂ Osaka and Nagoya to Nagano click here\n\nFor onwards transport options toÂ Nozawa, Myoko, Jigokudani and Togakushi from Nagano City click here\n\nFor transport options to and inÂ HakubaÂ click here\n\nFor mapÂ links clickÂ here\n\nNagano Ski Resort Shuttles & Airport Transfer\n\nACCESS: Train Tokyo to Nagano, Myoko Kogen, Jigokudani, Togakushi & Nozawa\n\nGetting your JR Pass\n\nJR EAST TRAVEL SERVICE CENTER AT NARITA AIRPORT\n\nBefore you travel from Tokyo to Nagano and further on you may need to buy your JR East Pass or swap your vouchers for a JR Pass. JR East Travel Service Centers are located in both Narita Airport Terminals 1 and 2. JR East Travel Service Centers are open every day from 11:30 AM to 7:00 PM. The service centre handles sales and exchanges of JR East passes as well as Japan Rail Passes (available for purchase only overseas). Other services include ticket sales and sightseeing information. JR accepts most major credit cards but not travellers checks.\n\nIf the JR East Travel Service Center is closed, go to the JR ticket office. They also exchange and sell tickets.\n\nHours of operation:\n\nTerminal 1: 6:30 to 11:30 AM, 7:00 to 9:45 PM\n\nTerminal 2: 6:30 to 11:30 AM, 7:00 to 9:50 PM\n\nMAPS OF NARITA AIRPORT:Â\n\nTerminal No. 1Â &Â Terminal No. 2\n\nBUY YOUR JR EAST PASS ONLINE\n\nYou do not need a JR Rail Pass if you are only travelling Tokyo to Nagano then onto to Myoko Kogen, Nozawa Onsen, or one of the others resorts in Niigata or Nagano. A far better choice is one of the JR East Passes which can be used for five non-consecutive days in a 2 week period. These can be bought at the offices listed above (you DO NOT need to buy it beforehand) or you can nowÂ purchase a JR Pass exchange voucher via the internet. However please be aware that the last leg from Nagano to Myoko-Kogen is a private line and not covered by the pass.\n\nJR EAST INFO LINE\n\nEnglish information hotline for JR service questions – Call (050) 2016-1603 – 10.00 AM to 6.00 PM (closed during the New Year holiday)\n\nUSEFUL JAPAN TRAIN LINKS – FIND FARES, TIMETABLES & ROUTE\n\nGo to this pageÂ to helpÂ calculate your train fares from Tokyo to Nagano\n\nUseÂ this very useful linkÂ to find Tokyo to Nagano time tables in Japan\n\nTOKYO NARITA AIRPORT – LEFT LUGGAGE & BAGGAGE STORAGE\n\nBoth terminals at Tokyo Narita Airport have luggage storage areas for left baggage. In Terminal One there are two left luggage counters – one on the Arrivals level and one on the Departures level. On the Arrivals level, (first floor) the counter is open 07:00 to 22:00 (7am-10pm) daily. On the Departures level (fourth floor) the counter is open 07:00 to 22:30 (7am-10.30pm) daily. Terminal Two has two baggage storage counters on the Arrivals level and two on the Departures level. They are open 07:00 to 22:00 (7am-10pm). One of the counters (GPA) in Arrivals is open 06:30 to 22:30 (6.30am-10.30pm). The cost is \\500 to \\800 per item per day depending on size.\n\nSee here reÂ sending your luggage via courier service\n\nFROM NARITA AIRPORT TO TOKYO VIA JR\n\nFromÂ Narita AirportÂ one can board theÂ JR Narita Express train (N’EX)Â to JR Tokyo station. Frequent departures are available from the airport rail terminals. Once aboard the N’EX stow your bags in the luggage storage areas at the end of each car, and sit back for the one hour ride to Tokyo. Trains from Narita Airport arrive at underground platforms nos. 1-4.\n\nFROM NARITA AIRPORT TO TOKYO (UENO) VIA KEISEI LINE\n\nThere are two routes between Ueno/Nippori andÂ Narita Airport. Please note that the fare and the time required are differentÂ depending on the route. The newÂ Narita Sky Access LineÂ has been recently upgraded with train running up to 160kph. This will reduce the travel time from 58-73 minutes, to as little as 36 minutes (Nippori) and 41 minutes (Keisei Ueno). The price for the new faster service is 2400yen. These savings in time could affect people arriving at Narita in the early eveningÂ who are heading from Tokyo to Nagano then up toÂ Hakuba,Â NozawaÂ andÂ Myoko Kogen\n\nHowever remember that, whilstÂ a bit cheaper, 1) it’s not covered by aÂ JR PassÂ and, 2) you have to negotiate your way fromÂ Keisei Ueno Station to JR Ueno StationÂ to get the shinkansen (see below). You can also get off atÂ Nippori StationÂ and change to the Yamanoate Circle Line. Unless you want to save money (about 50%), do not take the local train – especially during rush hour! (see video below for a little laugh).\n\nVideo – Japanese train during peak rush hour\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=b0A9-oUoMug\n\nThe JR and Keisei lines are accessible from the same concourse in Narita. Their platforms are separated but next to each other.\n\nKEISEI UENO STATION MAP\n\nA map of JR Ueno Station can be found hereÂ (orÂ download .pdf)\n\nHOW TO GET TO CENTRAL TOKYO FROM HANEDA AIRPORT VIA TRAIN\n\nHaneda Airport is only 10km from the city centre and is linked to JR Hamamatsucho Station by monorail. At Hamamatsucho you can then easily transfer onto the JR Yamanote Line or the JR Keihin Tohoku Line. The journey takes approximately 13 minutes and trains depart every ten minutes. Keikyu also operates “Airport Kaitoku” (limited express) trains that travel nonstop from Shinagawa Station to the airport terminal station, also in around 13 minutes. See theÂ Haneda AirportÂ page for more information. Board the shinkansen at Tokyo for the Tokyo to Nagano journey.\n\nTOKYO STOPOVER\n\nIf having a stopover in TokyoÂ you can arrange for the cheap and easyÂ Tokyo Airporter serviceÂ to collect and/or deliver you to/from the airport/hotel.\n\nJAPANESE STATION COIN LOCKERS\n\nIf just stopping over for a few hours in any major Japanese rail or bus station it’s very easy to find secure coin lockers to store your luggage. These cost from \\100 for a small locker up to \\800 for a very large locker. JR’s largeÂ coin lockersÂ are not only tall but deep. You canÂ see the sizes here. If your bag won’t fit then you’re using some really scary large luggage.Â There are usually no lockers for skis or snowboardsÂ (unless they’re under a metre long). See below forÂ ski storage in Nagano Station\n\nTOKYO STATION COIN LOCKERS & SKI STORAGE\n\nInÂ Tokyo StationÂ the “cloak room” is open everyday (except perhaps New Year’s Day) from 10am-6pmÂ for short term storage (1-2 days) ofÂ oversized bags or ski gear. It’s located downstairs in the GranSta area just near the Gin-no-Suzu meeting place and costs a very reasonable \\500 for each piece.\n\nNAGANO STATION COIN LOCKERS & SKI STORAGE\n\nCoin lockersÂ (including ‘extra-large’) are available by both theÂ East and Zenko-ji (West) ExitsÂ of JRÂ Nagano StationÂ (cost is \\300-\\800). See thisÂ JR Nagano Station map.Â The station has recently installed some larger lockers so you can now store your skis and snowboard bags securely whilst you go and exploreÂ Zenkoji TempleÂ and/or grab a meal. These lockers are located on the upper concourse just opposite and left as you come out of theÂ shinkansenÂ gate (see pic). The largest ones cost \\600 yen for the day (use 6 x \\100 yen coins).Â If these are full go down the steps ofÂ Zenkoji Exit, turn left and the gift shop (to left of the Black Cat) will store skis/boards for a small fee. If you have a problem the tourist information centre in Nagano Station will write your request in Japanese for you to take down to them.\n\nNote: Stations close overnight! If you want to retrieve your luggage make sure you get there before closing! If left after midnight extra charges will accrue.\n\nMore info on coin lockers here. See here reÂ sending your luggage via courier service.\n\nFROM TOKYO TO NAGANO STATION\n\nAt Tokyo Station (B5), take the up escalator, following the green signs for theÂ NaganoÂ ShinkansenÂ which usually leave from Platforms 22 or 23 at Tokyo Station (see Tokyo Station map .pdf). Take the Nagano ‘Asama’Â ShinkansenÂ on the Hokuriku (Nagano) line to theÂ Nagano stationÂ terminus. The journey usually takes between 1.5 – 2.5 hours (average is 1 hour, 50 minutes). The Nagano ShinkansenÂ runs frequentlyÂ until 10.00pm each day. The non-reserved cars are to the rear heading to Nagano (usually Car nos. 1-3). All cars are now non smoking. There are between 2-3 trains per hour. IfÂ staying overnight in Nagano CityÂ you canÂ bookÂ accommodation near Nagano StationÂ here.\n\nExperience the Tokyo to Nagano Shinkansen ride on video\n\nIf you wish to use theÂ highway busÂ toÂ Nagano, you need to change at Ueno or Tokyo and head for Ikebukuro station for the Nagaden Bus Service or Shinjuku station for the Alpico Bus Service. Use the Yamanoate Circle Line for both stations. You can alsoÂ catch a limousine bus direct to ShinjukuÂ whichÂ costs approximately \\3,000 yen and takes one hour. SeeÂ this pageÂ for more non-train options.\n\nTOKYO STATION (1F) MAP\n\nSee Tokyo Station map here\n\nFROM NAGANO STATION TO NARITA AIRPORT\n\nUpon arrival atÂ Tokyo StationÂ from Nagano exit theÂ Nagano Shinkansen (bullet train)Â tickets gate. From there follow the signs to the Narita Express that departs from Platform 4 on the Sobu Line (see map below). To get to Platform 4 on the Sobu Line take the escalators down. Alternatively, if not on a JR Pass, get off at Ueno Station and follow through to the adjacent Keisei Ueno Station to take theÂ Keisei Skyliner. Make sure you know which terminal you are getting off at – Terminal 1 or Terminal 2. You will find lists inside the train showing which terminal each airlines uses.\n\nFROM NARITA AIRPORT AND TOKYO TO HAKUBA\n\nApart from the bullet train option there is also another straightforward and slightly cheaper train option (for Tokyo to Hakuba bus or taxi options see here) From Narita Aiport take the N’EX (Narita Express) to Shinjuku Station (one hour). From Shinjuku Staion take the Chuo Limited Express (Super Azusa) to Hakuba Station (approximately three and a half hours).Â See here for information on getting to Hakuba from Tokyo or Osaka.\n\nNagano Station Area Map\n\nNagano Station google map here\n\nFROM NAGANO FOR MYOKO KOGEN & LAKE NOJIRI\n\nAfter your journey from Tokyo to Nagano, upon arrival at Nagano station, take the up escalator or stairs.\n\nAfter the privatisation of the rail line in March 2015, please note that you can no longer buy a through ticket to Myoko Kogen or Kurohime. You must buy a local line ticket when you arrive in Nagano.\n\nStaying to the right, go through the ticket gate for the local Kita-Shinano line, bound for Myoko Kogen. For Lake Nojiri alight atÂ Kurohime station. To get to Lake Nojiri take theÂ ‘Nagaden’ busÂ from Kurohime Station.Â Myokokogen is the stop after Kurohime (app. ten minutes further).Â The ski resorts are approximately ten minutes fromÂ Myokokogen StationÂ (see map below). Take aÂ taxiÂ orÂ busÂ to your destination at Myoko, or the hotel may arrange a courtesy shuttle.\n\nAlso please note for your return – you can no longer buy shinkansen tickets in Myoko Kogen or Kurohime stations. You can only buy a local line ticket to Nagano or JoetsuMyoko Station then buy your bullet train ticket there. Please leave enough time for train changeover and getting to your destination!\n\nMYOKOKOGEN STATION AREA AND BUS STOPS MAP COURTESY OF ALPICO BUS\n\nAn alternative is take the Hokuriku shinkansenÂ to JoetsuMyoko then change to the Myoko Haneuma line for Myoko Kogen.\n\nNAGANO TO MYOKO BUS\n\nThe Nagano to Myoko service is no longer running. A winter bus service will be available from Iiyama Station (via Madarao Kogen)\n\nFROM NAGANO TO TOGAKUSHI\n\nFor Togakushi exit the station via the Zenkoji exit (seeÂ Nagano Station map above), thenÂ take a Kawanakajima busÂ from Bus Stop 7 bound forÂ Togakushi Camp-joÂ / Camp World (approx. 45-50 minutes, cost \\1,160) from outside Nagano station. If you are coming from Kanazawa or Niigata see below. You can alight at Kurohime for Togakushi and take either a taxi or a shuttle bus (during winter only and must be pre-booked).\n\nFROM NAGANO TO NOZAWA ONSEN, IIYAMA AND MADARAO\n\nUpon arrival at Iiyama Station alight and take a local bus (about 25-30 minutes). You can catch a bus from the station or call theÂ localÂ Nozawa Onsen taxi service. See the Nozawa Onsen access details here.\n\nDiscount Shinkansen Tours: Great deals for visitors to Japan – up to 52% off!\n\nFROM NAGANO TO YUDANAKA ONSEN (JIGOKUDANI MONKEY PARK)\n\nUpon arrival at Nagano, exit the JR station and go toÂ the Nagano Dentetsu lines (seeÂ Nagano Station map above). The limited-express train to Yudanaka takes 45 minutes (ï¿¥1,230). A JR Pass cannot be used on this line. From Yudanaka, take a bus or taxi to Kanbayashi Onsen (15mins / ï¿¥250 / 6km) for the Monkey Park.Â See the video below for a visual explanation. Note: video has recently been marked private – may not display.\n\nFROM KANAZAWA OR TOYAMA\n\nTake a shinkansen to JoetsuMyoko station then swap to a train on the Myoko Haneuma Line for Nagano. The stop before Myokokogen is Sekiyama. Myokokogen is followed by Kurohime (for Lake Nojiri), Furuma and Mure (for Iizuna). The trip from Naoetsu takes approximately 30-45 minutes. UseÂ this very useful linkÂ to findÂ time tables and fares. If going to Madarao or Nozawa Onsen get off at the next station (Iiyama).\n\nLUGGAGE SERVICES\n\nJapan has a well-developed courier service, commonly known asÂ takkyubin. Luggage, including skis and snowboards, can be delivered anywhere in Japan, usually overnight. The courier companies operate out of Narita Airport (and most others), so you can send your luggage as soon as you pass through customs before travelling from Tokyo to Nagano. Look for the many service counters that are usually sited at the end of the departure lounge (for collection) or arrivals hall (for sending). Many convenience stores also handleÂ takkyubinÂ service. The company’s name is Yamato Transport symbolised by a black cat logo. AÂ luggage forwarding FAQ can be found hereÂ and a ski/snowboard forwarding FAQ here.\n\nThe cost depends on the destination but is usually around 2,000 yen. The service is safe and reliable, and highly recommended. A It allows guests to travel to their destination without having to try to negotiate luggage up and down stairs and in crowded train stations. There is no restriction on taking luggage on board the shinkansenÂ (bullet train), but in practice these trains are designed with quite a lot less luggage space than most other train services. Nonetheless, all trains in Japan have very limited luggage space; overhead storage and a small luggage shelf at either end of the carriage are standard on all trains.\n\nThe larger train stations in Japan have escalators, but smaller ones usually do not. There are no luggage trolleys available at train stations, although there is a porter service available at Tokyo Station. For example, the porter can meet you at your carriage and take your luggage to your next train, or to the taxi rank, depending upon your destination. The cost is 500 yen per piece of luggage. The porter needs to be advised of the train and carriage number in advance. Small suitcases and bags can be stored in lockers at the larger stations, however there is no storage for skis and snowboards.\n\nIMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER ABOUT LUGGAGE DELIVERY SERVICES\n\nWhen sending luggage to the airport, sufficient time must be given to guarantee your luggage arrives on time. Luggage and ski gear sent from Myoko, Hakuba and Nozawa Onsen to Narita Airport requires it to be sent two days before departure. Luggage will be stored up until the date of your departure and this information is specified on the luggage tag before it is sent. The luggage will be held by the luggage courier company at the airport and must be collected from there and then checked in to the flight departure counter by the owner of the luggage. Luggage cannot be stored at the airport if customers have onward flights and are wishing to collect luggage on their return flight home via Japan"
