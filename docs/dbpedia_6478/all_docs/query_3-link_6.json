        "text": "Prefecture of Japan\n\n\"Gunma\" and \"JP-10\" redirect here. For other uses, see Gunma (disambiguation). For fuel, see JP-10 (fuel).\n\nPrefecture in Kantō, Japan\n\nGunma Prefecture (群馬県, Gunma-ken) is a landlocked prefecture of Japan located in the Kantō region of Honshu.[2] Gunma Prefecture has a population of 1,937,626 (1 October 2019) and has a geographic area of 6,362 km2 (2,456 sq mi). Gunma Prefecture borders Niigata Prefecture and Fukushima Prefecture to the north, Nagano Prefecture to the southwest, Saitama Prefecture to the south, and Tochigi Prefecture to the east.\n\nMaebashi is the capital and Takasaki is the largest city of Gunma Prefecture, with other major cities including Ōta, Isesaki, and Kiryū.[3] Gunma Prefecture is one of only eight landlocked prefectures, located on the northwestern corner of the Kantō Plain with 14% of its total land being designated as natural parks.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ancient province of Gunma was a center of horse breeding and trading activities for the newly immigrated continental peoples (or Toraijin). The arrival of horses and the remains of horse tackle coincides with the arrival of a large migration from the mainland. From this point forward, the horse became a vital part of Japanese military maneuvers, quickly displacing the older Yayoi tradition of fighting on foot.[citation needed]\n\nWhen Mount Haruna erupted in the late 6th century, Japan was still in the pre-historical phase (prior to the importation of the Chinese writing system during the Nara period). The Gunma Prefectural archaeology unit in 1994 was able to date the eruption through zoological anthropology at the corral sites that were buried in ash.[citation needed]\n\nIn the past, Gunma was joined with Tochigi Prefecture and called Kenu Province. This was later divided into Kami-tsu-ke (Upper Kenu, Gunma) and Shimo-tsu-ke (Lower Kenu, Tochigi). The area is sometimes referred to as Jomo (上毛, Jōmō). For most of Japanese history, Gunma was known as the province of Kozuke.[4]\n\nIn the early period of contact between western nations and Japan, particularly the late Tokugawa, it was referred to by foreigners as the \"Joushu States\", inside (fudai, or loyalist) Tokugawa retainers and the Tokugawa family symbol is widely seen on public buildings, temples, and shrines.[citation needed]\n\nThe Tenmei eruption of Mount Asama occurred in 1783, causing enormous damage.[5][6]\n\nThe first modern silk factories were built with Italian and French assistance at Annaka in the 1870s.\n\nIn the early Meiji period, in what was locally called the Gunma Incident of 1884, a bloody struggle between the idealistic democratic westernizers and the conservative Prussian-model nationalists took place in Gunma and neighboring Nagano. The modern Japanese army gunned down farmers with new repeating rifles built in Japan. The farmers in Gunma were said to be the first victims of the Murata rifle.[citation needed]\n\nIn the twentieth century, the Japanese aviation pioneer Nakajima Chikushi of Oizumi, Gunma Prefecture, founded the Nakajima Aircraft Company. At first, he produced mostly licensed models of foreign designs, but beginning with the all-Japanese Nakajima 91 fighter plane in 1931, his company became a world leader in aeronautical design and manufacture, with its headquarters at Ota, Gunma Ken. The factory now produces Subaru motorcars and other products under the name of Subaru née Fuji Heavy Industries.[7]\n\nIn the 1930s, German architect Bruno Julius Florian Taut lived and conducted research for a while in Takasaki.[8]\n\nThe Girard incident, which disturbed US-Japanese relations in the 1950s, occurred in Gunma in 1957, at Sōmagahara Base [ja] near Shibukawa.\n\nFour modern prime ministers are from Gunma, namely, Takeo Fukuda, Yasuhiro Nakasone, Keizo Obuchi, and Yasuo Fukuda, the son of Takeo.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of only eight landlocked prefectures in Japan, Gunma is the northwesternmost prefecture of the Kantō plain. Except for the central and southeast areas, where most of the population is concentrated, it is mostly mountainous. To the north are Niigata and Fukushima prefectures, while to the east lies Tochigi Prefecture. To the west lies the Nagano Prefecture, and the Saitama Prefecture is to the south.\n\nSome of the major mountains in Gunma are Mount Akagi, Mount Haruna, Mount Myōgi, Mount Nikkō-Shirane and Mount Asama, which is located on the Nagano border. Major rivers include the Tone River, the Agatsuma River, and the Karasu River.\n\nAs of 1 April 2012, 14% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely Jōshin'etsu-kōgen, Nikkō, and Oze National Parks and Myōgi-Arafune-Saku Kōgen Quasi-National Park.[9]\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nTwelve cities are located in Gunma Prefecture:\n\nTowns and villages\n\n[edit]\n\nThese are the towns and villages in each district:\n\nMergers\n\n[edit]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nBecause Gunma is situated in inland Japan, the difference in temperature in the summer compared to the winter is large, and there is less precipitation. This is because of the karakkaze (\"empty wind\"), a strong, dry wind that occurs in the winter when the snow falls on the coasts of Niigata. The wind carrying clouds with snow are obstructed by the Echigo Mountains, and it also snows there, although the high peaks do not let the wind go past them. For this reason, the wind changes into the kara-kaze.\n\nClimate in Maebashi\n\nAverage yearly precipitation: 1,163 mm (approx. 45.8in)\n\nAverage yearly temperature: 14.2 degrees Celsius (approx. 57.6 degrees Fahrenheit)\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nGunma's modern industries include transport equipment and electrical equipment, concentrated around Maebashi and the eastern region nearest Tokyo. More traditional industries include sericulture and agriculture. Gunma's major agricultural products include cabbages and konnyaku. Gunma produces over 90% of Japan's konnyaku, and two-thirds of the farms in the village of Tsumagoi are cabbage farms.[10] Also, the city of Ōta is famous for the car industry, notably the Subaru factory.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is a local dialect, known in Japanese as 'gunma-ben' or 'jōshū-ben'.\n\nGunma has a traditional card game called Jomo Karuta (上毛かるた). It features people, places, and things of regional and/or cultural importance.\n\nFamous foods\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries held an event to find the top 100 best local dishes across all of Japan. Three dishes were featured from Gunma; yaki-manju, okkirikomi, and konnyaku.[11]\n\nMelody Roads\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2018, Gunma is home to eleven of Japan's over thirty Melody Roads. 2,559 grooves cut into a 175-meter stretch of the road surface in transmit a tactile vibration through the wheels into the car body.[12][13][14] The roads can be found in Katashina, Minakami, Takayama, Kanna, Ueno, Kusatsu, Tsumagoi, Nakanojo, Takasaki, Midori, and Maebashi. Each is of a differing length and plays a different song. Naganohara also used to be home to a Melody Road playing \"Aj lučka, lučka široká\", though the road in question was paved over in 2013 due to noise complaints.\n\nSongs\n\n[edit]\n\nKusatsu - \"Kusatsu-Bushi\"\n\nTakayama - \"When You Wish Upon a Star\"\n\nTsumagoi - \"Oh My Darling Clementine\"\n\nNakanojo - \"Always With Me\" (Japanese title: いつも何度でも, itsumo nando demo) from Spirited Away when driven at 40 km/h\n\nKatashina - \"Memories of Summer\" when driven over at 50 km/h\n\nList of governors of Gunma Prefecture (1947–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernor Term start Term end Shigeo Kitano (北野重雄) 12 April 1947 25 June 1948 Yoshio Iyoku (伊能芳雄) 10 August 1948 4 July 1952 Shigeo Kitano 2 August 1952 1 August 1956 Toshizo Takekoshi (竹腰俊蔵) 2 August 1956 1 August 1960 Konroku Kanda (神田坤六) 2 August 1960 1 August 1976 Ichiro Shimizu (清水一郎) 2 August 1976 12 June 1991 Hiroyuki Kodera (小寺弘之) 28 July 1991 27 July 2007 Masaaki Osawa (大澤正明) 28 July 2007 27 July 2019 Ichita Yamamoto (山本一太) 28 July 2019 present\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nUniversities\n\n[edit]\n\nIsesaki\n\nJobu University – Isesaki Campus\n\nTokyo University of Social Welfare – Isesaki Campus\n\nMaebashi\n\nGunma University\n\nMaebashi Institute of Technology\n\nMidori\n\nKiryu University\n\nOta\n\nKanto Gakuen University\n\nTakasaki\n\nTakasaki City University of Economics\n\nTakasaki University of Commerce\n\nTakasaki University of Health and Welfare\n\nGunma Paz College\n\nJobu University -Takasaki Campus\n\nTamamura\n\nGunma Prefectural Women's University\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sports teams listed below are based in Gunma.\n\nBaseball\n\n[edit]\n\nGunma Diamond Pegasus\n\nThespakusatsu Gunma (Kusatsu)\n\nTonan Maebashi (Maebashi)\n\nRugby\n\n[edit]\n\nPanasonic Wild Knights (Ota)\n\nBasketball\n\n[edit]\n\nGunma Crane Thunders\n\nGunma is also famous for its ski resorts in the mountains.\n\nGunma was the only prefecture in Japan to have all 4 legal types of gambling on races: horse, bicycle, auto and boat. This changed with the closing of the last horse race track in Takasaki in 2004.\n\nTourism\n\n[edit]\n\nGunma has many hot spring resorts and the most famous is Kusatsu Onsen. Another draw to the mountainous Gunma is the ski resorts.\n\nOther attractions include:\n\nLake Nozori\n\nHara Museum Arc\n\nIkaho Sistina Trick Art Museum\n\nMount Haruna\n\nKusatsu Alpine-Plant Museum\n\nKusatsu Hot-Spring Museum\n\nMount Kusatsu-Shirane\n\nMount Tanigawa\n\nMount Akagi\n\nMount Myōgi\n\nFukiware Falls\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art, Gunma\n\nKonnyaku Park\n\nShorinzan Daruma Temple\n\nKiryū Yagi-bushi Festival, held every year in early August.\n\nA Tomioka Silk Mill, a World Heritage cultural property site.\n\nDaruma dolls at Shorinzan Daruma Temple in Takasaki\n\nKenashi Pass on the border of Nagano Prefecture is famous on the internet\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nRail\n\n[edit]\n\nJR East\n\nJoetsu Shinkansen\n\nHokuriku Shinkansen\n\nTakasaki Line\n\nShinetsu Line (Takasaki-Yokokawa)\n\nJoetsu Line\n\nAgatsuma Line\n\nRyomo Line\n\nHachiko Line (Kuragano-Hachioji)\n\nTobu Railway\n\nIsesaki Line\n\nNikko Line (Itakura Tōyōdai-mae Station)\n\nSano Line\n\nKiryu Line\n\nJoshin Electric Railway (Takasaki-Shimonita)\n\nJomo Electric Railway (Chuo Maebashi-Nishi Kiryu)\n\nWatarase Keikoku Railway Watarase Keikoku Line\n\nRoads\n\n[edit]\n\nExpressways\n\n[edit]\n\nKan-Etsu Expressway\n\nTōhoku Expressway\n\nJōshin-etsu Expressway\n\nKita-Kantō Expressway (Takasaki-Hitachinaka)\n\nNational highways\n\n[edit]\n\nNational Route 17 (Nihonbashi of Tokyo-Saitama-Kumagaya-Takasaki-Shibukawa-Ojiya-Nagaoka)\n\nNational Route 18 (Takasaki-Annaka-Karuizawa-Komoro-Nagano-Myoko-Joetsu)\n\nNational Route 50 (Maebashi-Isesaki-Oyama-Yuki-Mito)\n\nNational Route 120\n\nNational Route 122\n\nNational Route 144\n\nNational Route 145\n\nNational Route 146\n\nNational Route 254\n\nNational Route 291\n\nNational Route 292\n\nNational Route 299\n\nNational Route 353\n\nNational Route 354\n\nNational Route 405\n\nNational Route 406\n\nNational Route 407\n\nNational Route 462\n\nPrefectural symbols\n\n[edit]\n\nThe prefectural symbol consists of the first kanji of the word 'Gunma' surrounded by three stylized mountains symbolizing the three important mountains of Gunma Prefecture: Mount Haruna, Mount Akagi, and Mount Myōgi.\n\nFor marketing, the Prefectural Government also uses Gunma-chan, a small super deformed drawing of a horse character wearing a green cap. It is used on promotional posters, banners, and other notable printed materials from the Prefectural Government. Other agencies and companies formally or informally use variations of its likeness and other horse-shaped characters when making signs or notices for work on buildings, roads, and other public notices.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are various manga and anime that have based their settings in Gunma, such as:\n\nInitial D\n\nA Place Further than the Universe\n\nThe Flowers of Evil\n\nNichijou\n\nYou Don't Know Gunma Yet\n\nIn Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, the main character Akira Tendo is from Gunma Prefecture.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\n2022 Japan heatwave\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNussbaum, Louis-Frédéric and Käthe Roth.
