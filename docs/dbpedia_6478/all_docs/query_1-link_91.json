        "text": "The Naena Waterfall (Naena-no-taki [苗名滝]; or Naena Falls) was one of our more pleasant waterfalling experiences in Japan.\n\nIt featured a classically-shaped rectangular waterfall plunging 55m over a cliff with pronounced basalt columns.\n\nAs you can see from the photo above, we happened to have timed our visit for the near peak of the koyo (or Autumn colors), which really added to the experience.\n\nThe Naena Falls was not only one of Japan’s Top 100 Waterfalls according to the Japanese Ministry of the Environment, but it was also very popular.\n\nIn fact, we shared this falls with dozens (maybe well over a hundred) people mostly from tour buses.\n\nYet even with the busy visit, there were plenty of ways to experience the waterfall so it never really felt like it was overwhelmingly crowded.\n\nWe’ve been made aware that this waterfall was also referred to as the “Earthquake Falls” because of how loud its thundering roar can be.\n\nHaving made our visit to this gushing waterfall, we can definitely confirm that indeed it was pretty loud.\n\nExperiencing the Naena Waterfall\n\nOur visit to the Naena Waterfall was quite straightforward.\n\nWe followed a well maintained 500m path from the cafes and shops flanking the car park (see directions below) to a suspension bridge crossing the Sekigawa (関川 or Seki River).\n\nBacking the bridge were some terraced dams, which I’m guessing was there for flood control.\n\nOn the other side of the bridge, we had to get over this dam infrastructure by going up several flights of steps spiralling up past the top of the dam walls.\n\nBeyond the dam walls, the trail then continued on a more conventional riverside path.\n\nWe started to get our first views of the beautiful Naena Falls after about 400m from the trailhead.\n\nAt first, we could see the waterfall being fronted by a suspension bridge crossing the Sekigawa.\n\nContinuing another 100m, we then reached a trail junction where we could go right to view the falls from the bouncy suspension bridge over the Sekigawa or continue straight for some more informal views of the falls from an angle.\n\nThat trail keeping left of the bridge was more overgrown and muddy (therefore slippery) due to the spray coming from the falls.\n\nWe didn’t pursue going all the way on that trail so we don’t know where that branch of the path ultimately went.\n\nHowever, we did cross the suspension bridge and had the opportunity to do some boulder scrambles to get as close to the Naena Waterfall as safely possible.\n\nThere was a shelter here as well as some interpretive signposts (in kanji) talking about the Japan’s Top 100 List.\n\nOverall, we spent a little over an hour away from the car.\n\nWe easily could have spent less time here, but we were so captivated by the koyo as well as the waterfall itself that we really took our time.\n\nIt has been said that the peak koyo of this area would be in mid-November.\n\nSo we can only imagine just how much more colorful this place would be if we thought our early arrival was pretty already!\n\nAuthorities"
