If you do happen to have your own transport or rent a car getting to Myoko is actually pretty easy. I would recommend using the highways, but bear in mind these are not free. They are all toll roads. If you are using google maps or another navigation tool make sure you turn on use toll roads. The highways are usually not busy once you are out of the major city areas so your journey should be pretty smooth. Make sure you keep an eye out for the correct junction. If you miss your turn you may have to travel 15-20 min before you can come off and turn around."
