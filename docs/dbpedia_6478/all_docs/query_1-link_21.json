The beginning of Myoko Kogen’s history began when groups such as Tokyo University Red Gate Club and the Keio Mita Club started skiing practice at the foot of Mt. Myoko. The local people welcomed the students and named their practice area “University Slope.” In 1922, theÂ AkakuraÂ Ski Club was formed and skiing started taking root in the region. It was through this that Myoko Kogen began it’s journey as an all-year-round mountain resort.\n\nIn 1937, the now famousÂ Akakura Kanko Hotel opened for business. At that time the tourist bureau of the Ministry of Railways had been widely promoting sightseeing in Japan to the outside world and the establishment was planned to be a main means for attracting visiting foreign tourists. During plans for the hotel construction, the owner (Okura Kishichiro) flew to Switzerland to observe similar European mountain hotels. The Akakura Kanko Hotel was born as a modern resort hotel, and at that time it was the only one of its kind in Japan. With this hotel as a nucleus, Akakura became a resort area clearly distinguished from any other at that time.\n\nIn 1950, wooden pole lifts were constructed in theÂ AkakuraÂ and IkenotairaÂ areas. The local districts belowÂ Mt. Myoko then went into full-scale development and eventually grew to its present-day scale as Myoko Kogen. During that time, numerous national ski championships were successfully held in Akakura. With the inauguration of the Nagano Shinkansen, Myoko KogenÂ became a 150 minute ride from Tokyo and with the subsequent completion of the Joshinetsu Expressway, it also became possible to easily drive to Myoko directly from the greater Tokyo area.\n\nInteresting facts about Myoko Kogen: Godzilla Goes Myoko!\n\nMyoko KogenÂ is featured in the 2001 movie –Â Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack (a.k.a. “Gojira, Mosura, Kingu Gidora: Daikaiju sokogeki”)\n\nSynopsis:Â Fifty years after his initial onslaught, Godzilla is all but forgotten by many people. While Yuri Tachibanan is filming a special docu-drama about Mt. Myoko, the head of the local village tells them to stop filming such lies. When Yuri tries to discuss with him about how it will be good for tourism, a tremor hits. Afterwards, Yuri spots an old man on in area and when she looks back, he disappears!\n\nThat night, a biker gang is killed during a tunnel cave-in, and the truck driver witnessing the event sees a giant head looking back at him. While the D-03 missiles (special missiles with drills at the head) are being used to uncover the tunnel, the driver is interrogated about what he saw. He claims he saw Godzilla. Yuri tries to convince her boss to cover the odd occurrence, but he declines. Later her advisor, Teruaki Takeda, brings her a book about a local legend: a group of legendary creatures known as the Guardian Monsters.\n\nMyoko Kogen Galleries –Â Click here"
