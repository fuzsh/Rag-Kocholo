By public transport, take a bus to Niigata station (25 min, ¥610) and then take the train or bus (details below).\n\nTokyo's two airports, Tokyo Narita Airport|Narita and Tokyo Haneda Airport|Haneda, are both at least three hours away by train.\n\nTravel by train to Nagaoka\n\nThe main way into Nagaoka is on the Jōetsu Shinkansen. There is at least one Toki train per hour to Tokyo (about 1hr 40min, ¥8950) and Niigata (25 minutes, ¥7500).\n\nFrom Niigata, one can instead take a local train, which takes about 1hr 15mins and costs ¥2140, or one of the five Shirayuki Limited Express trains a day, which is more expensive (¥2640) but brings the travel duration down to about 55 minutes.\n\nJR East offer some deals for travel within Niigata prefecture:\n\nIf you buy an Echigo One-Day Pass at ¥2540, you can save ¥740 on the price of a day trip to Niigata. The ticket is even better value if you use it to go as far as Shibata or Murakami. However, it does not cover the supplementary fare for Shinkansen or Limited Express trains; for this, consider buying the Echigo Ryōkin Kaisūken, which gives you four tickets for travel to or from Niigata on the Shinkansen or Limited Expresses, valid for a month, for ¥7920. (There is no child version of this ticket, but two children aged 6-11 can use one of these tickets).\n\nAlternatively and there is the Shinkansen Double Kippu, which gives you two tickets for the Shinkansen to and from Niigata, again valid for a month, for ¥6200 (¥2100 for children).\n\nFrom Kanazawa and Toyama there used to be a one-seat service to Nagaoka, but this has changed with the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen. The quickest way to travel between these areas is to take the Hokuriku Shinkansen's Hakutaka service to Jōetsu-myōkō, and change to the Shirayuki Limited Express which operates five times per day. The journey from Kanazawa using this route takes around 2hrs 20mins and costs ¥8840 each way; from Toyama, 2 hrs and ¥7760. If you use a Japan Railway Pass, a small extra charge of ¥650 will have to be paid for the 10km journey between Jōetsu-myōkō and Naoetsu which operates over non-JR tracks.\n\nBoth the Japan Railway Pass and the JR East Pass (Nagano/Niigata area) fully cover the Shinkansen journey from Tokyo, travel to Narita and Haneda Airports via the Narita Express and Tokyo Monorail, and travel on most trains in Niigata prefecture, amongst other things.\n\nBy bus\n\n(Where fares are quoted as being 'up to' a price and they are cheaper outside peak periods.)\n\nThe following highway buses serve Nagaoka station each day:\n\nTwo buses (one day, one night) to Kawagoe station, Ōmiya station, Tokyo/Toshima|Ikebukuro station, and Shinjuku, taking 5hrs 30mins and costing up to ¥7700. Operated by Seibu Bus, Echigo Kōtsu , and Niigata Kōtsu . If travelling from Tokyo to Niigata, Nagaoka station is the first stop.

Operated by Nankai Bus and Echigo Kōtsu . If taking the bus from Kansai, look for the bus to Kashiwazaki, Nagaoka, and Sanjō.\n\nAt least 22 buses to Niigata, which takes around 1hr 20mins and costing ¥980. Operated by Echigo Kōtsu and Niigata Kōtsu.\n\nWiller Express also run buses between Nagaoka and various places in Kanto|Kantō and Kansai.\n\nThe following serve Nagaoka-Kita Bus Stop on the Hokuriku Expressway, on the way to and from Niigata:\n\n16 buses (14 day, 1 night, 1 ladies-only night) to Kawagoe-Matoba Bus Stop, Tokyo/North|Nerima, Shimo-Ochiai station, and Ikebukuro, taking 4hrs 20min and costing up to ¥7700. The night buses also serve Shinjuku. Operated by Seibu Bus, Echigo Kōtsu , and Niigata Kōtsu .\n\n2 buses (1 day, 1 night) to Meitetsu Bus Center in Nagoya, taking a little over 6 hours and costing up to ¥8200.
