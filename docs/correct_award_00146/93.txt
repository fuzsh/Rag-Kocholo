Soul-Searching: Three Novels by Francois Mauriac

The Catholic novelist Francois Mauriac was awarded the 1952 Nobel Prize in Literature “for the deep spiritual insight and the artistic intensity with which he has in his novels penetrated the drama of human life.”

Our reading will begin the first of Mauriac’s novels to gain critical attention, A Kiss of the Leper which focuses on a young man’s struggle with his physical appearance. The Desert of Love explores the psychological and social consequences of sexual desire when a father and his son are attracted to a woman of a lower social class. We will conclude with The Knot of Vipers, a family’s story told through the protagonist’s journal.
