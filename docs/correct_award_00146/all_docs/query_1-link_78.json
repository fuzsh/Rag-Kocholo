        "text": "My mother was a compulsive writer. She taught English and French and she also loved to write in different genres all the way from letters to diary entries to poems.\n\nHer brothers would complain that they always owed her a letter, for as soon as she heard from them, she would reply.\n\nBecause she died in 1975, she was limited to “snail mail,” but she made the most of it, writing to family members and to her life-long best friend every week of the year. I often think of how she would have loved emailing, by which letters to her family and friends could have been delivered instantly and freely.\n\nLike mother, I’m a compulsive writer, too. I taught poetry writing, as well as other fields of literature for many years at various schools, including Olivet College, and wrote hundreds of poems along with my students.\n\nUnfortunately, however, most of my poems sit unread, unpublished, in a manila folder in my den closet.\n\nBut after I retired from the college in 1998, I began writing part-time for the Enquirer, and my words were actually published. Most of my early assignments were on subjects that would be considered minor, such as local fundraising events, city government decisions and the like. But even if they were unexciting reports, I nevertheless enjoyed the writing process.\n\nThen they began letting me write feature stories. I especially remember writing about a woman who had seven siblings, all of whom had different fathers. There was also the one about the standard poodle who, together with his owner, was said to serve as principal at the elementary school in Olivet.\n\nAnd then there was the one about the Battle Creek Symphony violist and piano-tuning friend who always invited me to his “Piano Burning Party” where, each year, he would select an instrument which was beyond repair to be consigned to the flames.\n\nFor some years now I have had the honor of writing a regular column, and I am grateful to be able to indulge myself in my passions, my compulsions, in the Enquirer every week.\n\nThis need to communicate is certainly not uncommon among people in general. It was particularly fervent among the Jews in concentration camps. Even though they were weak from starvation and disease and even though they knew they were probably going to die, they would gather up any bits of paper they could to write about their feelings and their suffering.\n\nAccording to Roger Rosenblatt, a prominent American writer, these prisoners “rolled those scraps into small scrolls and slipped the scrolls into the crevices of the ghetto walls...because they had to do it. They had a story to tell.”\n\nTrue enough, after losing his parents and one sister at the Auschwitz concentration camp, Elie Wiesel didn’t write anything about the Holocaust for 10 years.\n\nBut, upon the urging of French Nobel Prize winner, Francois Mauriac, he wrote his powerful book “Night.” He then went on to write 56 more books, many about the war, and he won the Nobel Prize in 1986.\n\nBritish writer Vita Sackville-West said it well when she declared, “It is necessary to write, if the days are not to slip emptily by. How else, indeed, to clap the net over the butterfly of the moment? For the moment passes, it is forgotten; the mood is gone; life itself is gone. That is where the writer scores over his fellows.”\n\nLinda Jo Scott can be reached at lindajoscott@gmail.com"
