        "text": "Reuven (Ruvi) Rivlin, The Tenth President of the State of Israel, was born in 1939 in the Rehavia neighbourhood of Jerusalem, on the border between the ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of Sha'arei Hessed and the more bohemian society of secular Jerusalem. His father, the oriental scholar, Professor Yosef Yoel Rivlin, translated the Quran from Arabic to Hebrew, and passed on to his son a love for the Arabic language. His mother, Rachel Rivlin, a nurse by profession, used to call him Ruve'le, which later became Ruvi, a nickname destined to accompany him throughout his life.\n\nPresident Rivlin was nine years old when the State of Israel was established. The period following the declaration of the new State and the Arab blockade of Jerusalem are deeply engraved in his memory. As a boy, he grew up in the divided city of Jerusalem and today he is still a man of opposites that complement each other; a member of the Israeli Scouts Movement who was raised in a home loyal to Beitar; a vegetarian for ideological reasons close to thirty years and a loyal supporter of the Beitar Jerusalem football club.\n\nThe President likes to begin each morning with a walk in the Jerusalem Forest, to \"breath in the fresh air of Jerusalem and to order my thoughts.\" The Brazilian Pele is the football player he most admires, and his favourite dish is eggplant in spicy tomato sauce. His favourite books are Moshe Shamir's The King of Flesh and Blood and A. B. Yehoshua's A Journey to the End of the Millennium, which he rereads every seven years. Jabotinsky, the thinker, writer, poet and statesman, is his source of inspiration. In light of Rivlin's consistent positions, that combine a commitment to Eretz Yisrael, together with a profound and uncompromising liberalism, some call him The Last Jabotinsky.\n\nDuring his public career, the President served as a member of the Jerusalem City Council, making a significant contribution to strengthening sports and the cultural life of the city. Following a decade on the City Council he was elected to the Knesset where he served for six parliamentary terms, including as a Government Minister and as Speaker of the 16th and 18th Knessets. Throughout his parliamentary career, President Rivlin insisted on the independence of the Knesset vis-à-vis the Executive and the Judicial Branches, and gained broad public recognition for his consistent defence of democracy and his efforts to ensure the rights of Israel's minorities.\n\nOn 10th June 2014, Rivlin was elected President of the State of Israel. As President, Rivlin declared his commitment to act to safeguard the State of Israel as a Jewish and Democratic State that is at the same time a Democratic and Jewish State, and to aspire to firmly establish partnership between the different groups (or \"tribes\" as his famous speech suggests) in Israeli society and ensure full equality among all its citizens.\n\nPresident Rivlin's term ended in July 2021. He still lives and works in Jerusalem. President Rivlin assumed positions as President of Electreon, a high-tech company developing wireless charging roads for electric vehicles, and as an Honorary Chairman of the Israeli Democracy Institute.\n\nUndeniably the reigning virtuoso of the violin, Itzhak Perlman enjoys superstar status rarely afforded a classical musician. Beloved for his charm and humanity as well as his talent, he is treasured by audiences throughout the world who respond not only to his remarkable artistry, but also to his irrepressible joy for making music.\n\nHaving performed with every major orchestra and at venerable concert halls around the globe, Itzhak Perlman was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation’s highest civilian honor, in November 2015 by President Obama for his meritorious contributions to cultural endeavors of the United States and for being a powerful advocate for people of disabilities. In June 2016, he received the 2016 Genesis Prize in recognition for his exceptional contributions as a musician, teacher, advocate for individuals with special needs and dedication to Jewish values. In 2003, he was granted a Kennedy Center Honor by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in celebration of his distinguished achievements and contributions to the cultural and educational life of the United States.
