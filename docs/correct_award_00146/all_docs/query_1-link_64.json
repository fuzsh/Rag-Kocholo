        "text": "This was a great year. I won two Nobel Prizes in Literature. I also won a Pulitzer, not for my poetry but for my linked short story collection about a colony of ghosts. My book of literary criticism finds trends in contemporary African poetry and tries, albeit unsuccessfully, to link Soyinka to O-Jeremiah Agbaakin, among other poets. The book was reviewed by the New Yorker, by the revered Anthony Lane (he rarely writes about books, but it was simply impossible for him to not write about my book): he said the book reveals “a mind that. . .” Forget it, read the review here. I forgot to say: I am the youngest winner of the Nobel Prize, beat Kipling to the title, he was forty-two. I am twenty-two. I signed a book deal for my novel about a family anticipating the coming of Christ, too; it sold after a long bid for some seven figures. I kid you not. Next year, I am going to India to research another book. My book about life in Lagos in the 1800s is forthcoming next year. I am living the dream. All glory to Jesus.\n\nThere was a time in my life when I used to daydream these things. I no longer have the time for daydreaming. Confirmed, daydreaming can take your mind from you. Now, if I want a thing, I go get it. It is as simple as eating bread with sugared water. Soft work.\n\nI have dreams. “Heavy” dreams. I am a very ambitious young man. I want a Nobel before I turn forty. Now, if you know anything about the Nobel, you know that is crazy. But, yes, that is why it is a dream. Two thousand years ago, Christ fulfilled that desire. I am not going to win a Nobel Prize in Literature; I already won a Nobel Prize in Literature hundreds of years before the Prize was instituted. All I have to do is go to Christ and ask Him for it. Here is where faith is needed: “He that comes to God must believe that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.”\n\nPeople talk about faith creating a dichotomy between head and heart, but it is not true. Faith is grounded in logical truth. Your dad already bought you the jacket that you want, but your dad only told you he bought you the jacket, you have not seen it, all you have to do is “trust” that your dad already bought you the jacket. It is not a problem of whether to trust your heart or your head now, it is a thing of relationship between head and heart. Your head tells you, “It’s your dad, you know he bought it if he says he did”; your heart says, “Remember last year, how he bought you that nice shirt?” The heart, the seat of emotions, wells up music and runs around the seat of the mind. You say, “O, I haven’t seen God before. I have seen my daddy.” That is cool talk.\n\nI have seen Jesus before. They say there is no cure for bipolar disorder II, Jesus healed me of that thing in about a month. I was diagnosed at a neuropsychiatric hospital at Yaba. The first injection they gave me, I was like dead for three days. The first time I used my meds, I had a seizure. Popping pills every morning and dying inside my body. I could not once survive without drugs and pity, who dey check now? I have heard God tell me what to write, and I am not even kidding you. I recently wrote a poem titled “Grace Motion”; it was during my quiet time. I finished having this conversation with the Lord, and I felt like writing a poem, though I did not know what I would write. I was having one of those few days block that I have where my work feels like a hardened criminal, and I heard the Lord say, “Write”. I wrote. The poem came out good. I went to class late that morning because I was savouring my own work. I told God the Holy Spirit to wake me to study when I gave up coffee, and He sure did. I have seen God hold my hand during exams. But, dang, even if I did not perceive God (though I must remind you that the pudding is only in the eating, is that how they say it?), God would still be as clear as the sky outside your house. I argue that God is even more real.\n\nWhen you are a believer, that is when you need the faith that seems to have no ground in immediate reasoning. Say, I am sick. The test results say I am not well. Yeah. Now, I believe, contrary to test results, that I am whole. That seems like a faith that contradicts the mind, yes? No, man. It doesn’t. It is the same as the analogy given before. Faith does not deny the state of things, nah. Faith says, “Yes. These are the facts. I accept that this is what the machines have seen. But Someone took these facts and negated them in His body two thousand years ago. So I take the healing that He contains, since I am in Him. The word says, The Spirit of life will quicken my mortal body. Let that happen now.” There is not one bit of a denial of logic. Logic means making propositions and drawing conclusions. If Jesus was wounded for my transgressions, chastised for my peace, why would I be wounded and chastised? It’s like going out on a date. I already cleared the bill and someone still comes asking the person I am out with for the money. That is what is illogical. You say to the illness, Are you well?\n\nThe groundwork of the faith, which is the word of God, is the main issue. If the truth of the Scriptures have to be taken on faith, then our faith is baseless. The Bible’s truth as a historical document is the groundwork of our belief system. And the Bible is the only religious book that lays claim to historicity. If we cannot prove that Jesus died and ressurected from the Bible, there is no point quoting what Isaiah said about how I am healed by His stripes. So, people say that faith (accepting Jesus) is blind—I say, No, sah. It is the most logical decision anyone can make.\n\nI was reading the introduction to Richard Kearney’s Anatheism last week. He said that there is no “God’s eye view” of things. That is false. The question is, what is God’s eye view of things? Jesus claimed to be God. He is the only Human who claimed that. No one else did. (If you ignore a woman who claimed she was years ago in Nigeria, and that man around Ibadan Expressway, Guru Maraji. Eeryone ignores them.) There have been prophets. But Jesus is either a mad man, a cheat, or who He says He is. So, do not begin by saying that there is a problem between the heart/ head. There is no dichotomy. Christ would not want anyone to believe in Him who thinks it is a fool’s game to do so. Paul is one of the most astounding philosophers of any time, he does not ask for groundless faith. He says, If the Resurrection is false, then—as W. Montgomery says—clerics can pick up a job at the fire department. We are done for. The New Testament is more reliable than any work written in classical times—more reliable than Plato or Thucidydes. You should do your own studying. If the NT is reliable (certainly not one hundred per cent, and I bet that you are not one hundred per cent sure that your parents are your parents), then what they say can be trusted. At the core of the NT is the Incarnation: that God became Man, more stupid or more divine than anything ever said. You must understand however that these people were grown men, older than the Man who claimed to be God, and they died for a conspiration theory and got thousands of people to give their lives to wild beasts. People say, O, people will die for less. Of course, the World Wars have shown that people will die en masse for country. But when you go to war, you know you are fighting for honor (self), and there is a corner in your bone where the dream of blood flourishes. You may not even like war and you only fought because you were conscripted against your will—which means you did not die like the Christians di. History is clear about how they died (they died for nothing, no offense, and they did it without fear, with joy) and for whom they died (Jesus, the Lunatic). If the Resurrection is true, it is the most important event in the history of man, it proves that there is God’s eye view of things.\n\nIt’s the last day of the year and I am putting these things down here. That is good. That is good. See, I am a lay man. No degree in theology yet. Took a walk the other day and began to to talk to Jesus: I said, Jesus, I would like to write a book on the Christian God (who is the only God there is) and War. The history of Christianity is not a neat sheet, not as clean as the Lord’s garment the morning Mary saw Him and He said, “Don’t touch Me just yet.” There is blood. (There Will Be Blood is one of my top three movies ever, I agree with Richard Brody that Day Lewis, for that performance, deserved that Oscar that he missed.) Christians have killed Christians. It is absurd. The Western civilisation (grounded in Christian ideals) have fought the most devastating wars in the history of our civilisation. These cannot be denied. Kearney said God died during those wars. He is being ushered in again just now. I said, Lord, I need to answer. And it was in that moment that I realised how many degrees I need to get. Not because the degrees will answer the question. No. The Holy Spirit can write a book now through me that answers the questions. But, you see, that is the kind of thing Christians do not faith in. If I don’t know anything about the Catholic-Protestants war in Ireland, I need to study, not ask the Holy Spirit to tell me.\n\nThis year, I did not win the Nobel. God worked wonders through me. I made more money from writing than I have made in my brief career yet. I recently went to pick four new contributor copies. Some are in the air, flying now to me. I grew taller, and I look like I should start looking for a wife. No kidding, bro. My dad took the family out yesterday. I got some clothes and a pair of shoes. I don’t wear shoes. But I tried the clothes and the shoes on yesterday, and I stood a long time before the mirror in my father’s room, just savouring my look. Just savouring. Man. Uncle M. said to me once, “You are becoming a fine man, not a fine boy. Fine man.” That was how I felt yesterday.\n\nYou know, it’s different. When I stood before that mirror, I was not only savouring my physical appearance. I am a good-looking guy, sure. But it feels different to be handsome in Jesus. And I tell you, you cannot get it. You look good, but your heart feels good. You have a peace that matches the peace on the outside. I looked so cool, and I felt so cool. I am twenty-two, and I think I know what God wants me to do, He has put me on a path, He speaks to me, He blesses me. I was seeing the man I will be in some eight years. I was seeing my wife and my daughter, or my son, or both. I was seeing myself teaching art or theology to some students. It is that purpose. I have purpose. O, man, I looked good in 2020, stunning. But I felt like dirt and a disease most of the time. I did not like the next day. Also, my look in 2020/ early 2021 depended on the antidepressants and colorado: I could be fat today and thin tomorrow, my body literally fluctuated.\n\nI read about forty-six books this year, including: Kay Ryan, Erratic Facts, Billy Collins, The Apple That Astonished Paris, Joanna Klink, Raptus, Edwards Hirsch, Gabriel, Gregory Orr, Concerning the Book…, Jim Harrison, In Search of Small Gods, Wendell Berry, The Selected Poems, Allen Ginsberg, Howl and Other Poems, A.R. Ammons, Garbage (poetry); Roland Barthes, The Mourning Diary, C.S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain, Timothy Spriegge, Theories of Existence, Simone Weil, Gravity and Grace, Francis Schaeffer, The God Who Is There (philosophy/ theology); Helen Vendler, Poets Thinking, V.S. Pritchett, Lasting Impressions, Lewis Thomas, Lives of a Cell, Thad Carhart, The Piano Shop on the Left Bank (nonfiction/ literary criticism/ science writing); ed. Christian Wiman and Don Share, The Open Door, ed. Robert Bly, News of the Universe, ed. Robert Bly, The Winged Energy (poetry anthologies); Maria Reva, Good Citizens Need Not Fear (short story collection; I am ashamed of the fact that I read one collection this year, though I read several stories); William Shakespeare, Julius Caesar, Leo Tolstoy, The Death of Ivan Ilych (classics); George Plimpton (ed.), Writers at Work (an anthology of interviews, one of my favourites—The Paris Review Interviews); Kenneth Haigin, Following God’s Plan for Your Life (Christian literature). I finished only one novel, Frank Peretti’s the Visitation. I reread Jennifer Perrine’s In the Human Zoo, Chris Abani’s Sanctificum, Neruda’s Book of Questions, James Longenbach’s Draft of a Letter, among others.\n\nI started one million books. I am half-way into over a dozen. Being a “scholar” is like being a restless child at the TV, you keep flipping the station looking for something. You get only as much as you need from this station and then you flip. Next year, I am going for about eighty books. I bought some twelve new books as a birthday gift for myself this year, I have to finish them before the next birthday. I have only read one, Kumukanda by Kayo Chigonyi. I am reading Manchester Happened by Jennifer Makumbi. I also started The Penguin Book of Modern African Poetry, which I hope to edit someday.\n\nThe best things (essays/ poems) that I read this year. I read the New Yorker for a “living”. There is an essay by Anthony Lane on T.S. Eliot, “The Shock and Aftershocks of “The Waste Land””. Gold. I love this review by Parul Seghal. I read a good deal of John McPhee’s craft essays, John McPhee is one of the longest staff writers at the New Yorker. I love, love the essays in Literary Journalism, an anthology. I will finish that anthology next year and start all over, studying. The Art of “[]” Paris Review Interviews are my appetizers. I love, love. I am on my second series. The interviews with Francois Mauriac, Philip Roth, Isaac Bashevis Singer, I love exceptionally. Also, the one with John Barth, whose The Sot-Weed Factor sits in my bookshelf at home. I will get to it. I read a bit of the New Criterion also. I loved a Matthew Arnold’s essay on measuring classics, in one of the great anthologies of the 1800s. Two stories I loved this year? I no get. I read a lot of good stories. I need to read more novels next year. Also, I read a good deal of Christian Wiman, his essays. This month I got hooked on Randall Jarrell’s essays.\n\nWhat did I publish? A few things here and there, you see. I like these essays: “The Poetry of Glossolalia” (at the Poetry Foundation); “The Beating Field: On Reading Poetry Out Loud” (at AGNI Online). I published a poem in AGNI 95. One of my favorite days this year was the night I received a publicity for the issue I appeared in, it said:\n\nAlmost a year ago, Louise Glück won the Nobel Prize in Literature, making it seven laureates who’ve published in our pages before taking that honor. Yet when you open AGNI 95—the first issue in our Fiftieth Anniversary year—you may be unfamiliar with most of the names inside. Read the work of Vasiliki Albedo, Issam Zineh, Ernest O. Ògúnyęmí, Andrew Zubiri, Charley Burlock, Mariana Villas-Boas, and you’ll know why we feel compelled to share their words alongside writing by Robert Pinsky, Kimiko Hahn, Alex Marzano-Lesnevich, Jan Beatty, and Victoria Chang. (Italics mine. I said I’ll frame this thing.)\n\nI appeared in the Cincinnati Review, Poetry Ireland Review, the Moth (the final issue, with my name on the cover!), Banshee, Arc Magazine, Bodega, Delmarva Review, Worcester Review, the minnesota review, Rust+Moth, Fantasy, among others. (I always say I am Irish, the way editors from Ireland picked my work this year, I am beginning to think I have some Irish blood.) I cannot tell you how I screamed the night I got the acceptance from the Kenyon Review, I was at school. I got accepted as a Poetry Found Visiting Teaching Artist while I was in school also, but I did not scream. It was after an examination. I was just cool. It was about the same time that my little book got accepted. I was in class when The Sun accepted my work, bro! The girl who sat next to me felt it. I wrote a paper for someone this year and got paid for it. I may be writing another one. I was a poetry mentor in the Adroit Journal mentorship program this year. (Most of the poems are in print, but the links to the ones online have been inserted.) I thank God for my writer-friends, Ife Olatona and Fiyinfoluwa Oladipo, these two guys are crucial to everything I have achieved this year. They read my drafts, and if you are a friend of Ernest, that is not easy work. Conversations with them are so good.\n\nI moved to a new apartment, minimalist room but great. I love it. I love the bookshelf, the artworks on the wall, my reading chair and table, and more. I got gadgets for work, bought myself things, like a wristwatch that I love. You know how important me buying a wristwatch is? Once, I would have visited a brothel with the money. Or got a tattoo with more than that. You see the purpose? I bought more books this year than at any other point in my life. Name the author. The books will soon send me out of my room. “Ernest, you know. We thank you for rescuing us. But we need the bed. Please.”\n\nGod has been faithful, Gee. Yeah. I have hopes for next year, there are magazines I want to be in. There are awards I want to win. But, most importantly, there is something that breaks my heart that I need the Lord to bestow His grace upon me for and deal with. He should take it from me. So He can mold me into the kind of man that He needs. I am not the man God wants me to be yet. I need to grow up spiritually. I need to pray more and love up on my Father more. I need to hunger.\n\nThank you to all who subscribed to this newsletter this year. Some one hundred and fifty persons. Man, that you consider my words worthy of your time. I do not take it lightly. You listen to my ramblings. You pay attention to my shallow mind. I love you, man. God bless you and give you peace. May He cause His face to shine upon you. Thank you very much. Today is my dad’s birthday. I love the man. God bless him and keep him. Happy New Year to you. Come celebrate with me."
