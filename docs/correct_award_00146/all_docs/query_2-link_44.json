        "text": "p.21 DESCRIPTION\n\n… she saw in imagination bicycling through those mornings of the long ago upon the road that led from Saint-Clair to Argelouse, about nine o’clock, before the heat of the day had grown intolerable: not him, but his sister Anne. She had a vision of the girl with her face aglow, while all around the cicadas were kindling into little flickers of flame on each successive pine, and the great furnace of the heath was beginning to roar beneath the sky. Millions of flies rose in a cloud above the blazing ling. \"Put on your coat before you come indoors; it's like an ice-house.\" Aunt Clara would say, adding, \"Wait till you've cooled down before you have a drink.\" …\n\nThe summers in the forest can be baking hot, ever more so as global warming clocks in, but the tall pines provide a welcome, dappled shade. As for flies, well now they are no problem here in Les Landes. The two insects that have annoyed at times have been mosquitoes and ticks.\n\nMosquitoes are effectively dissuaded with a mosquito repellent. Ticks come from the many roe deer (Bambi) living in and near the forest. These often have ticks, that transfer from deer to undergrowth to people walking in the forest (this not usually a problem in towns and on the beach). Ticks are a carrier of Lyme’s disease, related to and similar to syphilis. If you go in the forest or nearby during the summer, take sensible precautions: do not have bare legs.\n\np.22 - 23 Even at dusk, when the sun had come so near its setting that only the very lowest sections of the pine trunks were reddened with its light, and a belated cicada was still scraping away for dear life almost at ground-level, there was still an airless heat beneath the oaks.\n\nWhen September came they could venture out after luncheon and wander through the parched land. No tiniest stream of water flowed at Argelouse. Only by walking a long way over the sandy heath could they hope to reach the head-waters of the rivulet which went by the name of La Hure. It carved a myriad courses through low-lying meadows laced with alder-roots. Their feet turned numb in the ice-cold current, and then, no sooner dry, were burning hot again. They would seek the shelter of one of the huts set up in October for the guns who went out after duck. It served them as the shuttered drawing-room had done earlier in the year.\n\nThere may have been no running water at Argelouse, but Les Landes has many rivers - large like the Adour, medium like the Midouze, and many smaller rivers and streams. Because the department has a low population, the forest, its paths, the river and stream-sides, and the roads are mostly empty. There is no-one to be seen and almost no cars, so you can often have a picnic by a roadside, or a little way off, as comfortably as going down by a river bank. And people when you do come across them are friendly, “B’jour, m’sieur-dame”, and “Bon appetit!” if you are sitting with your picnic as they pass by.\n\np.26 BUSINESS, FIRE\n\n[...] she had stayed behind with the men, held there by the talk of farm matters and pit-props, of mineral deposits and turpentine. She took a passionate delight in estimating the value of land. There could be little doubt that the idea of controlling so great a stretch of forest territory had exercised over her an irresistible fascination. ‘He, too, was in love with my trees ...’\n\n[...] they had once walked together down the sandy track which led from Argelouse to Vilméja. The shrivelled oak-leaves were still showing as dirty patches against the blue. The dried tangle of last year's bracken was thick upon the ground, the tender stalks of new growth striking a note of bright and acid green. Bernard said: \"Be careful of your cigarette. Even at this time of year it might start a fire. The heath is already without water.\"\n\np.36 UNSALUBRIOUSNESS OF LES LANDES\n\n\"The Azévédos were somebody when our ancestors were a miserable lot of shepherds shaking with fever in the marshes.\"\n\nOf course, with the widespread draining of the marshes, disease and fevers are now thankfully something from history, and this was so even in Mauriac’s time .\n\np.51 PROPERTY\n\nThe tragedy of the class war was never really forced on her attention in a countryside where even the poorest have some property, and are for ever striving to amass more; where a common love of the soil, of shooting, of food and of drink, creates between all-middle and labouring class alike-a close bond of brotherhood. But Bernard had, in addition, some degree of education. The neighbours said of him that he had got out of his rut, and even Thérèse took pleasure in the thought that he was the kind of man with whom it was possible to carry on some sort of rational conversation, a man who had \"risen superior to his environment .\" or so she regarded him until she met Jean Azévédo.\n\np.53 WALKING\n\n… I had decided to go to the lonely hut where Anne and I used to eat our little snacks, and where I knew she had later loved to meet young Azévédo. I didn't regard it in the light of a sentimental pilgrimage. What took me there was the knowledge that the trees had grown too big to make bird-watching easy, and that, consequently, I ran little risk of disturbing the guns. The hut was no longer used for shooting because the forest all around blotted out the horizon. There were no long, open drives in which it was possible to follow the movement of the coveys. The October sun was still hot. The sandy path hurt my feet, the flies plagued me.\n\nRoe deer [le chevreuil] have become very numerous in Les Landes (over 14,000 animals in 2001-2), so much of hunting here concentrates on reducing the deer population. In the forest during the summer, roe deer have a liking for eating tree leaves; in winter they eat ivy, brambles , heather and tree seeds. The hunting season is generally from September to January. You may go down a quiet forest road and have deer leap across the road. Be careful, a baby Bambi may come scampering after its beautiful mother.\n\np.61 SILENCE\n\nAll around us was the silence: the silence of Argelouse! People who have never lived in that lost corner of the heath-country can have no idea what silence means. It stands like a wall about the house, and the house itself seems as though it were set solid in the dense mass of the forest, whence comes no sign of life, save occasionally the hooting of an owl. (At night I could almost believe that I heard the sob I was at such pains to stifle.)\n\n'It was after Azévédo had gone that I got to know that silence. So long as I was sure that he would come to me with the new day the thought of his presence robbed the smothering dark of all its terrors. The fact that he was lying asleep nearby gave me a feeling that the night and all the sweep of moorland was rich with life […] I have an impression that, being a bred-in-the-bone Parisian, he could not bear the silence, the particular silence of Argelouse, any longer,[…]\n\np.70 LOVE OF PINES/ FIRE\n\nWeek followed week without so much as a drop of rain.\n\nBernard lived in constant terror of fire. He was suffering from his heart again. More than a thousand acres had been burned over at Louchats. \"If the wind had been from the north I should have lost my Balisac pines.\" Thérèse was in a state of waiting for she knew not what to fall from the immutable sky. It would never rain again. One day the whole surrounding forest would crackle into flame, even the town itself would not be spared. Why was it that the heath villages never caught fire? It seemed to her unjust that it should always be the trees that the flames chose, never the human beings. In the family circle there was a never-ending discussion about what caused these disasters. Was it a discarded cigarette, or was it deliberate mischief? Thérèse liked to imagine that one of these nights she would get up, leave the house, reach the most inflammable part of the forest, throw away her cigarette, and watch the great column of smoke stain the dawn sky . . . But she drove the thought from her, for the love of pine-trees was in her blood. It was not them that she hated.\n\nThere are strict regulations about fires in the environs of the Landes forest. Roughly, from March through to October, no open fires such as bonfires or camp fires may be lit. At other times, permission has to be obtained from the local Mairie (town hall). Fire is a real danger amongst the resin-rich pines. Visitors and residents alike have to be vigilant against starting a fire in the forest. Even a glowing match-end could start an extensive forest fire during the hot, tinder-dry summer.\n\np.91 TORMENTED TREE TOPS\n\nOn the last night of October a wild wind from the Atlantic tossed the tormented tree-tops for hours together. In a half-sleep, Thérèse lay and listened to the thunder of the sea. But when she woke at dawn it was to a different sound. She opened the shutters, but the darkness of the room was unrelieved. A thin, dense rain was falling on the cobbles of the yard and pattering between the still thick foliage of the oaks.\n\nThe rain comes gently, softly, or in torrents, clouding your view through the trees. When the sun shines through the rain haze, the beauty of the atmospherics and colours is breath-taking. And this happens again and again. Despite all the rain, with ground that is essentially sand, even large puddles last at most twenty or thirty minutes before being absorbed.\n\nOften the rain is brought by spectacular shows of son et lumiere - sound and light - given by the enormous thunderstorms that happen every three or four days, especially during summer. The house shakes with the thunder, the lightening comes as jagged spears streaking down the sky, or sheets spreading light in the night darkness, or pulsing glows in the distance. And if you’re staying in the forest depths, there may be a further excitment, of power cuts - but these are usually repaired swiftly, whatever the time of day or night.\n\np.97 DEEP MURMUR\n\nA gust of wind blew it open, and the chill night air filled the room. Thérèse could not muster sufficient energy to throw back the bedclothes, to get up and cross the room on bare feet to shut it. She lay curled in the bed, the sheet drawn halfway over her face, so that only on her eyes and forehead did she feel the icy blast. The deep murmur of the pines filled Argelouse, but, despite this sound, as of a fretting sea, the silence of the place was there.\n\nThe chattering amongt the pines increases as the wind picks up, becoming a rushing roar, as Mauriac says, like the sea but a wild sea of breaking rollers. Afterwards, there are pine needles and branches everywhere, pulled off the pines by the wind and cast about on road, path and field.\n\np.109\n\nShe played in imagination with the idea of going back to the sad and secret land-of spending a lifetime of meditation and self-discipline in the silence of Argelouse, there to set forth on the great adventure of the human soul, the search for God....\n\nIf you believe in higher beings, this place must be proof of their existence. If you do not, here is a place to make one wonder how such beauty appeared by chance.\n\nFIRE\n\n\"There was-it was on the day of the great fire at Mano.\"\n\n[...] She found it odd to conjure up the picture of that oppressive afternoon with its pall of smoke through which the blue looked dimmed and sooty, to smell again the acrid scent as of torches which comes from burning pines.\n\np.115 LOVE OF PLACE / MOANING PINES\n\n[...] she had been longing to drive with Bernard along the road to Villandraut in the evening light between the ominous pines! What did it matter-the sort of country one was fond of, pines or maples, sea or plain? Life alone was interesting, people of flesh and blood. 'It is not the bricks and mortar that I love, nor even the lectures and museums, but the living human forest that fills the streets, the creatures torn by passions more violent than any storm. The moaning of the pines at Argelouse in the darkness of the night thrilled me only because it had an almost human sound!'\n\nFor descriptions of work in the Landes forest, look at these associated pages:\n\nbefore the forest, working in the forest: lumber,\n\nthe forestry industry: resinous and other forest products"
