        "text": "Samizdat\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nApr 23, 2021\n\n--\n\nSamizdat team selection\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n23rd of April is the International Day of Books & Copyright and we decided it would be a wonderful chance to mention some important women from our publishing industry.\n\nWe have selected a few names of eminent women, from the publishing field, namely from literature, book design, illustration, journalism and interdisciplinary mediums, who have contributed significantly to the industry or continuously move things for the better.\n\nGraphic artist specialized in book design and a graduate of the Moscow Printing Institute. After graduation, she worked as the Main artist in the “Cartea Moldovenească” publishing house (1968–1991) and at Universitas publishing house (1991–1995). Was an excellent Art Director and a talented artist. Illustrated fiction book series by authors like: Aleksandr Kuprin, Konstantin Paustovsky, Alexandre Dumas, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Jean Amadou, François Mauriac, André Maurois and others.\n\nShe was one of the first soviet women to be working among local book (male) designers.\n\nProminent bibliographer, who contributed to the organisation of several library competitions at the republican level, as well as scientific symposiums. In 1997, she launched the International Book Fair for Children and Youth, involving 27 publishers, and over time reached over 150. She has published multiple articles in the field, holds numerous awards, is the president of the Association of Librarians in Moldova since 1991, and since 96 – president of the national section in the International Council of the Book for Children and Youth (IBBY).\n\nPoetess, essayist, prose writer, playwright and journalist. She is best known for her children’s textbooks, however, for many years, her plays managed to get her awards and mentions in the Republican Dramaturgy Contest, and the novel “One Night Life or Tötentanz” was awarded with the “Vasile Vasilache” Prize for prose at the International Book Fair in Chișinău and with the Writers’ Union Prize for prose in 2010.\n\nAn artist that practices book and easel graphics, oil painting and mixed media, including textiles, preparing future graphic artists at the Academy of Music, Theatre and Fine Arts in Chișinău. Violeta is also known for being highlighted as one of the best book illustrators in Moldova, for such books as “Winnie the Pooh” by Alan A. Milne (2006) and “The Beautiful Lola” by Claudia Partole („Lola cea frumoasă”) (2017) awarded twice with the Andersen Honorary Diploma, the most important international distinction for children’s literature.\n\nThe writer who made her debut in the literary world with an amazing force. Her short stories impressed both the Writers’ Union and all Moldovan, Romanian and French readers. She managed to hijack any stereotype regarding the fact that books written by women are gentle/suave and only suitable to be read by women. We recommend reading: “Summer when my mother had green eyes” (“Vara în care mama a avut ochii verzi”) and “Glass Garden” (“Grădina de sticlă”)."
