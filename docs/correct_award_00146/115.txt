This exchange - 293 Letters – brings together two of the most influential intellectual and cultural figures in France in the 20th century. Mauriac was the leading Catholic intellectual and writer of the period, the significance of whose work was recognised with the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1952. Paulhan as director of the Nouvelle Revue française was the most influential literary figure. The correspondence provides an invaluable commentary on the entire period and especially on the tormented years of the Occupation. The substantial notes draw to a great extent on hitherto unpublished material. Widely and enthusiastically reviewed in France the edition was runner up in the prestigious Sévigné prize for edited correspondence.
