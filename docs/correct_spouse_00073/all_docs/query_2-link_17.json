He was born April 10, 1851, and died April 29, 1899.\n\nNotes for MATILDA JANE KISNER:\n\nDaily Review\n\nMay 1900\n\nMrs. Matilda J. Eberlin departed this life at her home at Norconk, Wilmot township, on Monday, May 14, 1900, Matilda Jane Eberlin, wife of the late Martin J. Eberlin, who passed over into the great beyond May 1, 1899. The deceased was aged 40 years, and was a victim of that dreaded disease consumption. She left three children, an aged father and several brothers and hosts of friends to mourn her death.\n\nInterment took place in the St. John's Lutheran Cemetery, which was in sight of her home, on Thursday, May 17. The funeral was very largely attended. Her last remains were carried to her last resting place from her home by twelve pallbearers, where she was laid to rest by the side of her husband. She was a devoted and consistent member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Rev. John W. Klinger of Dushore, her pastor, officiated and delivered an able and touching sermon.\n\nThe deceased was born in Cherry township, Sullivan County, in 1860, and was a daughter of Hiram Kisner. She received the rite of holy baptism in her infancy by the Rev. C.L. Early, and was confirmed according to the rites of the Lutheran church in Cherry township, Sullivan County, in 1872, by the Rev. Henry B. Strodach, and was united in holy wedlock with Martin J. Eberlin in 1878, by the Rev. Lewis Smith. The deceased was one of those rare personalities who seem to diffuse about them a sort of love compelling atmosphere, which few can resist that come within the charming circle of its influence.\n\n\" None knew her but to love her.\n\nNone named her but to praise\"\n\nAlthough conscious of the approaching death, which was to sever the tenderest of human ties and deprive her children of fond mother's love and guidance, she was nevertheless enabled to meet death's merciless advance with marvelous fortitude and resignation, testifying to the last her abiding faith in God's infinite goodness and a Christian hope of a blissful immortality. The church of which she was an exemplary member and the social circle enlivened by her presence lose much by her untimely demise. To the bereaved family which now only consists of three children the loss is an irreparable one. To this tearful group around the desolate hearthstone of their once happy home, the sympathy of the entire community have gone forth with a depth and sincerity seldom ever witnessed.\n\nMore About JOSEPH MARTIN EBERLIN:\n\nCemetery: St John's, Wilmot, PA\n\nChildren of MATILDA KISNER and JOSEPH EBERLIN are:\n\ni.

In November 1870 we came to Kansas settling on my fathers homestead, north of Waconda Springs in Mitchell County.\n\nMy fathers name was Jefferson Kisner. My mother's name was Emma Caroline Suver. I had one [brother?].\n\nDied February 10, 1937. My mother died June 3, 1930. My brother died June 17, 1953.\n\nOn January 1, 1888 I was married to George W. Coble who passed away February 16, 1946.

She was recorder of the Royal Neighbor Lodge for 30 years.\n\nIn 1905 Mr. and Mrs. Coble built a home, which she maintained until death, although failing health has caused her to live in homes for the aged, during the last few years.\n\nShe leaves to mourn her beloved son-in-law Mason Randall who has been as kind and attentive as any son could have been, a loyal and trusted friend Margaret Anderson, who seemed like a daughter to her than a friend, two nieces by marriage, Mrs. Elmer (Bessie) Rollins of Glen Elder and Mrs. Andy (Dora) Walker of Kansas City, Missouri, other distant relatives & a host of friends.\n\nShe who lived valiantly has passed, why should we grieve; why should it break out hearts like this if we believe?\n\nSurely, she lives more valiantly than ever before,\n\nFreed, as she is to move without the weights she bore,\n\nFreed fro the sweet adventuring of Heavenly days.\n\nLightened to go exploring down Glory ways.\n\nWhat must these first hours be to her who loved earth so?\n\nShe who lived valiantly has passed, why should we grieve?\n\nWhy should it break our hearts like this, -- if we believe?\n\nFuneral Services were held in the Glen Elder Christias Church Wednesday, October 24, 1962 at 2:00 p.m. Rev.

The custodian at St. Mary's Church and School on Elmira's Southside from 1957 through the sixties and seventies, he always wanted the school to sparkle when September came.\n\n\"As soon as the school year ended he threw himself into getting school ready for the next year.\" Remembers Margaret Ekes, a retired teacher at St. Mary's.\n\nAlthough it's been nearly 10 years since Touschner retired as custodian, people still remember his quest for perfection. \"He was a fixture there for many years,\" Ekes said.\n\nTouschner of 762 Mount Zoar St. died Monday after years of fighting various illnesses, including leukemia. He was 79. A funeral mass will be held at St. Mary's church at 10 a.m. Friday.\n\n\"He was a terrific custodian,\" said Sharon Touschner, a daughter-in-law and also a teacher at St. Mary's. \"He kept us all in our places.\"\n\nMrs. Touschner said her father-in-law took such price in his work that he would strip down the desks and floors every vacation to refinish them. Although he expected a certain amount of wear and tear during a school year, he had a low tolerance for damage caused by carelessness, she said.\n\n\"I remember him as a person not just a custodian,\" Ekes added. \"Everyone called him Vince.\"\n\nVince had a special relationship with the children at St. Mary's. Since the teachers were all women, he enjoyed the status as the only male authority figure in the building. The children liked to go down by his basement office and say hello, Ekes continued.\n\n\"He was interested in what they were doing. He never gave the kids a hard time.\"\n\nHe saved his lectures on preserving the spic and span appearance of the school for the teachers, Ekes said.\n\nAfter he retired, Mr. Touschner took the same kind of care in caring for his yard. His son, Francis and James said he continued to mow his lawn even this summer.\n\n\"He took a great pride in keeping his yard shipshape,\" Mrs. Touschner said. \"Hhe didn't believe in slackening off.\"\n\n\"He was kind of serious most of the time,\" said his son, Francis.\n\n\"He was very religious\" added James. \"It was a source of pleasure for him to work at the church.\"\n\n\"He was the best custodian they ever had,\" Francis said.\n\niv.

She married DANIEL WENNER PEALER February 16, 1875, son of ELIAS BEALER and SUSANNAH WEIMER. He was born February 21, 1851 in Fishing Creek, Columbia Co., PA, and died December 03, 1928.\n\nELIZABETH ANN LAWRENCE PEALER the daughter of John Horatio Lawrence, was born on a farm one mile east of Dusohre, Sullivan County. She was nineteen when her mother, Susannah Dieffenbacher Lawrence, died, leaving eleven children, the youngest of which was Frank, less than one year of age. A large part of the responsiblility of keeping the family together after the death of the mother was borne by the eldest child. However, she somehow found time to complete her education in the common schools and taught one winter. She married Daniel Wenner Pealer, February 16, 1875. They started their married life at Canton Corners, Bradford County, where their first child, Anna F., was born. It was move-move and more move for Elizabeth and her family, but finally they located at Lopez, Sullivan County in 1889 with a family of five small children. At that time Lopez was more of a lumber camp than a town. The houses were of plank frmae construction, cold as cold in the winter and extremely hot in the summer time.\n\nThe earnings from husband Daniels shoe and harness shop were meager. With little coming in and Dans liberality in helping others before he helped himself, often left a difficult problem for the manager of the household. Renting a room to a school teacher now and then and taking in an occasional boarder helped to make ends meet. In the early days of the lumber town, fresh vegetables, milk and eggs were real luxuries but seldom seen on the family table. Berries, watercress, dandelions, beechnuts, fish and wild game supplemented the dietary deficiencies we hear so much about today. In later years a house, with conveniences, was built that was thoroughly enjoyed. At the time of her death, May 27, 1928, she was a member of the United Evangelical Curch of Lopez. Elizabeth Ann and Daniel Wenner Pealer are buried in the Bahrs Cemetery near Dushore.\n\nDan and Elizabeth Pealer\n\nSource:The PEALER-WENNER-LAWRENCE-LADD-DIEFFENBACHER FAMILIES\n\nbyThomas Pealer\n\nPrinted for Distribution to Family and Friends, 1947\n\nNotes for DANIEL WENNER PEALER:\n\nSullivan Review: 31 July 1879\n\nHattie, twin daughter of Daniel and Lizzie PEALER died Wednesday night.
