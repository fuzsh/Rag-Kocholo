        "text": "Eli Bridge supplies icon to sporting goods store\n\nAT: Tim Baldwin\n\ntbaldwin@amusementtoday.com\n\nTHE COLONY, Texas — It is often said in whimsical exaggeration and false bravado that things are bigger in Texas. That boast stands true when it comes to the opening of the latest Scheels store.\n\n“This store is 331,000 square feet, which makes it the largest sporting goods store in the world,” said Events Coordinator Alex Koob.\n\nThe new store hoped to open in early April. As the coronavirus reared its ugly head in a nationwide shutdown, Scheels was not able to open until May 1.\n\nAmusement Today asked why a Ferris wheel was a good fit for a sporting goods store.\n\n“All Scheels stores are dedicated to that customer experience. As you walk in you see our 16,000-gallon aquarium,” said Koob. “A Ferris wheel is fun, but it is also nostalgic. The flashing lights kind of draw you in. For those people who have ridden a Ferris wheel before and know it as a fun centerpiece, that’s why it is in the middle of our stores. It kind of brings you back to a simple way to have fun.”\n\n“It’s very family oriented,” said Bill Peterson, one the supervising operators of the wheel. “It’s how they want this company to be.”\n\nScheels’s new Ferris wheel is the latest top-of-the-line model from Eli Bridge. It stands 65 feet tall.\n\n“It has a touch-screen operation. It’s pretty cool,” said Patty Sullivan, president and CEO, Eli Bridge. “The biggest difference [at the new Scheels location] is that it is handicap accessible.”\n\n“If you use the computer system, I can tell it to automatically load the next car,” said Peterson. “It will go to the next car [on its own] to keep it in balance.”\n\nPeterson noted that if operators observe that a heavier load is followed by smaller children, for instance, the capability of manual loading is always available.\n\n“The computer speeds up loading and is an added level of safety,” said Sullivan.\n\n“This lift chair is for people who can’t get up the stairs on their own,” said Peterson. “There is a [computer] mode for handicap, and it will come down and space automatically.”\n\nOne of the 16 baskets on the ride is handicap accessible loading from the left side. The chair will lift the passenger up the ramp, and a sliding board on the platform allows the visitor to transfer.\n\nSullivan feels this is a more efficient solution than trying to make a car that is wheelchair accessible, as a wheelchair would be required to lock into place, regardless of its size and model, which would be challenging on a Ferris wheel vehicle.\n\n“This way anyone can get on and off on their own and be able to ride, and no [physical] training on the ride operator is necessary,” said Sullivan, noting liability of staff members if they had to transfer riders.\n\nDuring recent surges in COVID-19 cases in Texas, operation of the wheel is suspended as are other entertainment attractions within the store.\n\n“When that time comes to offer operations, cleaning procedures will be very standard. Sanitizing to all of the baskets, line spacing — it will be similar to our other shops,” said Koob.\n\nInternational Ride Training (IRT) partnered with Eli Bridge once again for guidance. “We have trained every Ferris wheel for new stores for the past 16 years,” said Patty Beazley, owner, IRT. “They are a great group. Scheels is an awesome company, and we couldn’t be prouder to be associated with them.”\n\nOne of the safety features at Scheels is that the gate to the barrier surrounding the ride must have a magnetic key fob held by a ride operator to open. If the gate were to open during a time the wheel is in motion, the computer would automatically stop the ride.\n\nSullivan points out another safety feature of the computer program. “If you see someone misbehaving, you simply press that seat number, and the wheel will bring them down and you can invite them to ride something else,” she said with a smile.\n\nVehicle baskets are decorated in branding, both national and local. Koob points out it is a way to recognize their partners in the sporting goods business.\n\nRides on the Ferris wheel cost only $1, which correlates to both the family-friendly atmosphere and a value-oriented guest experience.\n\nRiders that are 36 inches can ride with a companion. Those 48 inches and taller have no restrictions.\n\nThe wheel is one of a handful of attractions within the store, which also include a shooting gallery and a mini bowling alley.\n\n•scheels.com\n\nCandymonium opens at Hersheypark\n\nAT: B. Derek Shaw\n\nbdshaw@amusementtoday.com\n\nHERSHEY, Pa. — It has been a two-year, $150-million-dollar project that finally opened to the general public in early July. Chocolatetown is a 23-acre addition to Hersheypark that includes a brand new entrance, a hyper roller coaster, relocated carousel, and numerous retail shops, restaurant and bar, ice cream parlor along with the first Starbucks inside the park.\n\n“One is only happy in proportion as he makes others feel happy,” Milton Hershey once said. That philosophy is engrained in the plaza entrance. The area between Tram Circle and the front gate, named Compass Rose, features a series of large round medallions. First there are the directional ones (north, south, east and west.) The others highlight significant areas in Milton Hershey’s life that offer a piece of historical information to visitors. Each marker covers something from four broad topics: Sweet Beginnings, The Greatest Gifts, Monuments For the Ages and The Legacy Lives On. Depending on where the item being highlighted is located in Hershey, the marker points in that direction.\n\nLaura Krolczyk, assistant general manager of Hersheypark is glad they are open. “We started planning Chocolatetown about four years ago. It’s been a wonderful project — a very large project in scale with a lot of fun things for our guests. We have a very wide sweeping gate for our guests to enter quickly into the park.”\n\nThe new entrance area is the first major redesign since Randall Duell & Associates created the Tudor Square area that led to the main gate in 1973, when the park was beginning to transition from a traditional non-gated venue to a hybrid theme park. Homage is paid to those days with a plaque and three bricks within the brick work on the southeast corner (left side) of the Starbucks building. On that spot, 12 feet below, is where the entrance gate once stood. A picture, as part of the marker, helps guests visualize the past. The bricks are from that former entrance area.\n\nArchitecturally, the new area pays tribute to styles that Mr. Hershey liked and used in construction of his plant and attractions. Some of these features include four-sided pitched roof towers; Dutch gables; five different colors of clay bricks, including beige; arched windows and blue porch ceilings. Painting a porch ceiling blue is a tradition rooted in the South dating back to the early nineteenth century. This was a way to deter insects and gave the impression of a blue sky and longer days. This can be found on the ceilings of the Ticketing and Guest Services buildings. In addition, there are plenty of chocolate accents throughout the entrance area promoting the Hershey’s brand.\n\nImmediately after passing through the gate, visitors will see the massive Candymonium roller coaster on the right where a portion of the track circles the Hershey Kisses fountain. On the left is the recently relocated 101-year old Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC #47), 66-horse carrousel. Since 1972, the carrousel had been located further into the park in an area known as Carrousel Circle. A new pavilion-style roof was made, complete with clerestory windows, (a small band of upper windows that let natural light into the covered space,) paying tribute to carousel buildings of the past. The old metal red, white and blue canopy still sits on its original site with picnic tables and skill games this season, perhaps becoming home to another attraction in the future. It is not known if the carrousel will operate year-round as had been rumored throughout the construction.\n\nStanding 210 feet tall, Bolliger & Mabillard’s (B&M) latest creation, Candymonium, dominates the right side of the entrance area experience. Of the 23-acre addition to the park, the 4,636-foot-long coaster (or 10,279 bars long in Hershey's Milk Chocolate bars) occupies seven acres. Candymonium is billed as the tallest, fastest, longest and sweetest coaster at Hersheypark and its 15th one.\n\nPart of the queue traverses back and forth underneath the station that is made of traditional brick. Once ascending to the second level, the waiting rider is greeted by neon lighting. This B&M hyper coaster has a secondary restraint system: ratcheting seat belts. The coaster uprights are light blue while the track is a Hershey milk chocolate color. Three trains navigate the track with their own candy-product paint schemes: Hershey’s Kisses, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and Twizzler twists.\n\nCandymonium begins with a quick 210-foot ascent up the tallest coaster hill in the park. The train then plummets quickly heading toward Spring Creek before it proceeds into an airtime hill, followed by a 123-degree hammerhead curve. Next comes another airtime hill, a speed hill and an upward climb into the first helix, a Stengel dive element (over-banked turn with a camelback hill,) another floater hill, and a final airtime hill. In all, there are seven hills, most over 100 feet in height. The ending features a panoramic banked curve around the Kisses-designed fountain. The two-minute and 26-second ride reaches speeds up to 76 miles per hour.\n\nSophie Bolliger, vice president and head of sales and marketing at B&M, talked about design considerations. “Candymonium’s track crosses Spring Creek on ten distinct locations. At each of these locations, the design of the track and columns has been specifically adapted with long spans between columns to avoid foundations in the creek bed. Part of the layout consists of two tracks running parallel to each other. To reduce the number of foundations and make the ride more aerial, single columns have been used to support both tracks.”\n\nThe coaster has a pair of short trim brakes along the layout. “It is a standard policy from B&M to provide, for long and fast coasters, one or two trim brakes along the ride to adjust the train’s speed. This is especially important for Candymonium which is long and fast with multiple camelbacks. An accurate speed is necessary to create airtime and weightlessness — the most of any of the coasters at Hersheypark,” said Bolliger.\n\nHersheypark previously worked with B&M when Great Bear was introduced in 1998. “They are an absolute stellar company. It was very evident when you work with a project going through something so serious as COVID-19, just how committed they are to their product; the safety of their employees, the safety of our employees, about making sure the ride is on time. It was just a joy!” said Krolczyk.\n\nThe assistant GM talked about commissioning of the coaster. “In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, during our COVID-19 lockdown, construction was not permitted. Everything paused. We were able to come back and finish the construction of Chocolatetown and Candymonium,” said Krolczyk. “In six weeks we finished the commissioning of the ride. It is a multi-part commissioning. The manufacturer does portions of it. Our maintenance assists in a portion of it and then there’s a separate section for just the operations piece of it as well. You’re going through your programming, then going through your maintenance to get laps on your trains and then you’re going through the entire safety systems checks with the operations portion of it.” Finally there was at least 40 hours of operational run time with opening and closing every restraint during every ride cycle. Thousands of laps were made with each of the three trains before they were ready for the public to enjoy.\n\nThe park opened three months later than originally scheduled due to the pandemic. “We’re just so happy to have our guests back. Our guests seem to be really happy to be back, and have a little bit more of normal, which includes some fun on a roller coaster in the sweetest place on earth,” said Krolczyk.\n\nThe current pandemic situation forced a few pieces of Chocolatetown to not open until next year. This includes the Chocolatier Restaurant, Bar and Patio, Milton’s Ice Cream Parlor and The Sweeterie Confectionery Kitchen.\n\n•hersheypark.com\n\nKings Island welcomes arrival of Orion\n\nAT: John W.C. Robinson\n\njrobinson@amusementtoday.com\n\nKINGS MILLS, Ohio — With an opening delayed by nearly three months, Kings Island debuted its newest addition on July 2 when Orion roared to life for the park's passholder preview period. The B&M giga coaster, had been tantalizing riders since even before it was announced in 2019. The sight of its intimidating lift hill waiting above the park's horizon — alongside the iconic Eiffel Tower — only served to whet the appetites of park guests waiting for Ohio to once again allow theme parks to open after the COVID-19 stay-at-home order was lifted.\n\nNow the tallest and fastest roller coaster at Kings Island, Orion plunges riders down a 300-foot first drop at an 85-degree angle, sending them on a high-speed journey over seven more hills and 5,321 feet of track at speeds up to 91 mph.\n\n“It is fast, smooth and provides plenty of air time,” said Mike Koontz, the park’s vice president and general manager. “I can tell you from experience, I’ve ridden it four times now, the views from the top of the lift hill are nothing but spectacular.”\n\nThe park has added soundtrack by IMAscore and added extensive theming elements to transform the former X-Base area around the ride to resemble a top secret government compound dubbed Area 72. The name references the year the park was founded, and the queue area for Orion features easter eggs from many of the park's former attractions.\n\nTwo years in the making, the $31 million project is almost equal in cost to what it took to build the entire park in 1972, making it the biggest single investment in Kings Island’s history. Its massive layout sees the coaster extend nearly the entire length of the park's Coney Mall midway area. After that initial drop, guests experience five airtime hills, a giant rolling wave turn and 360-degree helix near the end of the 5,321-foot track.\n\nIt is the third time the park has partnered with B&M, after the success of Diamondback in 2009 and Banshee in 2014.\n\nThe ride proved popular with guests immediately, with opening day wait times exceeding four hours at points, even with all three trains operating continuously (at 50% capacity in order to comply with social distancing protocols). On day two of operation, the park introduced an access pass requirement for the new coaster's line.\n\n“With the reduced capacity of Orion to 50%, we created the Orion Access Pass to assign guests a one-hour window to ride the coaster,” said Chad Showalter, director of communications at Kings Island. “They are distributed on a first come, first served basis when the park opens each day. This gives our guests the opportunity to enjoy the rest of their day at Kings Island, and come back to the ride at their assigned ride time.”\n\nAccess passes and social distancing are not the only changes present at Kings Island with the shadow of COVID-19 still present. The park has installed over 600 additional hand sanitizing stations throughout the grounds. All shops and restaurants have been assigned an official entrance and exit, and social distancing reminders are prevelant throughout the walkways and lines.\n\n\"Face coverings are required at the park for anyone that's over the age of two,\" added Showalter. \"We will have ambassadors walking around to help remind our guests and also to tell them where the closest relax zone is.\" Relax zones are semi-secluded, often shaded areas within the park where guests can safely social distance and remove their masks for comfort.\n\n\"Our guests and associates have been very supportive regarding our face covering policy.\"\n\nAs is becoming common practice in 2020 for all major theme parks, the park has implemented an online reservation system for all guests who plan to attend each day. In addition, upon arrival all guests have their temperatures checked.\n\nIn order to reduce high-contact areas, Kings Island has removed all of its park map stands which were a common area for congregation of large groups of visitors. Instead, the park is actively encouraging guests to use the Kings Island App for information and directions within the facility. In addition, several large, billboard-style maps have been installed on the park grounds.\n\n“Our guests have appreciated the extensive measures that Kings Island has put into place to reduce the spread of germs and COVID-19. We’re all in this together, and our guests know that safety is Kings Island’s top priority,” said Showalter. “We’ve found that when we focus on safety, they can focus on fun and making memories with the people who matter most to them- their family and friends.”\n\nNot all of the COVD-19-releated changes are restrictive. Kings Island has remembered that it's a place for family fun and entertainment. With that, in 2020, the park introduced the pop-up show Scrub Club.\n\n“Scrub Club is an unannounced, pop-up show that happens throughout the day,” explained Showalter. “They perform in various spaces throughout Kings Island. The performances are in large midway areas where there’s plenty of room to maintain social distancing. Since the shows are not promoted, our guests do not gather or congregate in advance to watch it.”\n\nAfter a week of passholder-only previews, Kings Island opened to the general public on July 10. The park is maintaining shorter operating hours thus far in the summer, with the gates closing at 7 p.m. on most nights.\n\n•visitkingsisland.com\n\nDistance done right\n\nAT NOTEBOOK: John W.C. Robinson, jrobinson@amusementtoday.com\n\nWhen state and local governments began loosening the stay-at-home restrictions, I was one of the first to embrace the moment and get out in society. I enjoyed a dinner out at a downtown restaurant, and sat there in awe as only about two dozen parties were seated in a restaurant that could easily hold three times that. Management was keeping the distance rules in place. However, two days later, another dinner out nearby proved a different story. The restaurant was crowded, all tables were full and there were so many people that one would've thought it was just a normal evening, not one that was still under the shadow of COVID-19.\n\nIn recent weeks, we've all seen this same effect. Bars, restaurants, stores and more had theoretical rules in place to maintain social distance and keep up the fight against the pandemic, only to relax them a few days after reopening or just flat out ignore them. There was no consistency, minimal reassurance and, honestly, no reason to feel as though businesses were taking the current threat seriously by embracing a new normal.\n\nThen, at long last, our beloved amusement industry began to reopen. With plans in place which many had been organizing and preparing for months, theme parks, amusement parks, water parks and family entertainment centers began to welcome guests again.\n\nAnd they welcomed guests back with safety, reassurance and promoting good health at the forefront.\n\nI've been fortunate enough to attend multiple facilities in recent weeks as just a guest and a customer looking to enjoy some fun. At every facility, I've seen masks actively encouraged, if not enforced. I've witnessed staff members take a participatory role in ensuring guests were socially distanced in lines. I've seen plans for temperature checks not only implemented, but immediately ready with a backup in case technology went awry.\n\nOur various industry associations assured information was disseminated to all properly. Competitors became compatriots and shared information and insight so that all would be ready for the day our turnstiles would be active again. It seemed, from the very beginning, our industry knew that we were all in this together.\n\nThe industry waited for months to be able to just get open once again. Now that our guests are returning, it's uplifting to see our facilities set the standard for welcoming guests while still ensuring their safety in the age of COVID-19.\n\nKentucky Kingdom,\n\nCedar Point open for season\n\nAT: John W.C. Robinson\n\njrobinson@amusementtoday.com\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. and SANDUSKY, Ohio — Thrills and family fun continued their return to the Midwest as stay-at-home orders were lifted, allowing Louisville's Kentucky Kingdom and Ohio's Cedar Point to open their gates and welcome guests at last for the 2020 season.\n\n“Kentucky Kingdom is an outdoor attraction covering 63 acres. We’ve always had strict guidelines in place regarding acceptable behavior in the park and on all of our attractions, and our more than 1,400 team members diligently enforce these rules,” said Ed Hart, president and CEO of Kentucky Kingdom. “On average, we have one team member for every ten guests, which means we have the personnel to see that guests in the park abide by our rules. Proper social distancing is just another rule that we expect our guests to observe.”\n\nAs is becoming standard practice in the attractions industry, Kentucky Kingdom staff politely took the temperatures of all guests before allowing them entrance into the park as it opened on June 29 at the lowered admission price of $29.99 per person for the 2020 season. In addition, hand sanitizer as well as signs and markers encouraging social distance were plentiful.\n\nAll Kentucky Kingdom staff were required to wear masks, but guests were simply encouraged to. However, after Kentucky Gov.Andy Beshear initiated a statewide mandate requiring masks for all Kentuckians while indoors, Kentucky Kingdom followed suit and required them of guests while inside restaurants and gift shops in the park. Adapting the plan has been necessary from the beginning for Kentucky Kingdom.\n\n“The main challenge we faced was the amount of [updated] information that was released after our plan was already submitted to our state government,” said Jessi O'Daniel, Kentucky Kingdom's vice president of guest experience. “We worked furiously with our team of experienced theme park operators to come up with a plan that we felt confident in.”\n\nKentucky Kingdom also implemented Smile Zone for its staff members, allowing for times and areas that they can remove their masks and safely smile to guests visiting the park. “Smile Zones are areas where our ride operators can take their masks off,” O'Daniel added. “These areas are typically behind control panels and occur when the train is out on the track or when a ride is in motion more than six feet away from the operator.”\n\nCedar Point implemented a similar policy, but this time for its guests, when it opened to passholders on July 9 (Cedar Point Resort guests could attend the park beginning July 11). Dubbed “Relax Zones,” these areas offered socially distanced seating and often shade for guests who want to step off the main midway and safely remove their masks for a bit.\n\n“The safety of all of our guests and associates has always been, and will always be our top priority,” said Jason McClure, vice president and general manager of Cedar Point. “We’ve implemented new safety protocols throughout the property that align with the recommendations of health and safety experts.”\n\nFirst and foremost of the new protocols is the required reservation by guests for attending the park. All guests are required to visit the park's website and pick a date and time to visit. They're allowed to arrive after their chosen time, but not before. This system keeps the front gate from becoming too crowded while staff members take the entry temperature of every guest who is attending on a given day.\n\nWith masks mandatory for guests at all Cedar Fair parks, the Cedar Point staff were polite but adament about reminding guests to have their masks properly placed on their face at all times.\n\nLike many other parks, Cedar Point's roller coasters upheld social distancing for rides by skipping every other row. Uniquely, the B&M winged coaster Gatekeeper's seats are designed with adequate social distance in place, so that particular attraction could be dispatched with riders in every row.\n\nWith daily attendance set at about 25% of park capacity, several attractions are scheduled to be closed throughout the season. In addition, more popular attractions such as Millenium Force (Intamin), Steel Vengeance (Rocky Mountain Construction) and Maverick (Intamin) require guests to pick up an \"access pass\" before queing. Each access pass gives visitors a one-hour window to return to the attraction and join the queue, which allows park staff to help ensure proper distancing between parties within each line.\n\nCedar Point's neighboring water park, Cedar Point Shores, will remain closed throughout the 2020 season.\n\n•kentuckykingdom.com\n\n•cedarpoint.com\n\nGuests return to Walt Disney World, changes abound throughout the resort\n\nAT: David Fake\n\nSpecial to Amusement Today\n\nLAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — After nearly four months of closure due to COVID-19, Walt Disney World Resort reopened the gates to its parks with major changes to operations that are possibly the most comprehensive and stringent in the industry. The international destination began welcoming guests back to the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom parks first, officially opening to the public on July 11 after cast member and passholder previews. Then, Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Epcot opened the following week on July 15 following the same cast member and passholder previews. The resort’s shopping and dining complex, Disney Springs, had already opened several of its venues almost a month earlier.\n\nDisney says its “responsible approach” to reopening draws on its experience from the recent reopenings of Shanghai Disney Resort, Hong Kong Disneyland and Disney Springs. Disney has re-examined all aspects of a day at their theme parks in light of the new global environment. The new policies follow guidance from health experts and government agencies. In addition to limits on attendance and controlled guest density, new procedures will be in place for park entry, attractions, dining, retail, and transportation, with the well-being of guests and Disney cast members at the forefront of planning.\n\n“Our deliberate and phased approach at Walt Disney World Resort emphasizes multiple layers of health and safety measures,” said Dr. Pamela Hymel, chief medical officer, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. “We’re taking a multi-pronged approach to our reopening, after considering the guidance of various governmental authorities and health agencies, and recommendations from our team of health and safety experts. We’re also actively working with industry groups and research universities to discuss best practices.”\n\nTo accomplish this goal, cast members have gone through extensive training to prepare for the theme parks’ reopening in this unprecidented environment. Cast members in the newly formed “Incredi-Crew” are awareness ambassadors who wear brightly colored, easily identifiable attire and walk through the parks to explain the new procedures and answer any guest questions, while encouraging everyone to follow these new health and safety measures. In conjunction with the Incredi-Crew, the theme parks ï»¿have incorporated health and safety awareness signage throughout the parks that is themed to the company’s Incredibles IP.\n\nIn addition to the common social distancing, limited capacity, mask requirements and temperature checks, the most obvious of the additional changes Disney has implemented include the elimination of the ability to park hop within a single day and the cancellation of the resort’s popular FastPass+ reservations that granted guests priority boarding/entrance to rides and attractions through the My Disney experience app and special queues.\n\nChanges to dining and food and beverage service at the resorts include enhanced cleaning procedures in seating, dining and common areas, as well as changes to self-serve options. In addition, mobile technology via the My Disney Experience app is being used in convenient ways to minimize contact, such as Mobile Order at select quick-service theme park locations and Mobile Dine Check-in at select theme park table-service locations, as well as reduced-contact menus at select theme park restaurants. Additionally, many of the resorts famous buffet restaurants, such as the Biergarten Restaurant at Epcot’s Germany pavilion, have been converted to family-style table service and offer a majority of the options that were available on the buffets.\n\nDisney character meet and greets are one of the most treasured aspects of the Disney park experience. Traditional character greetings and parades have been put on hiatus during the initial reopening, but Disney characters will appear in a variety of new and different ways throughout all four theme parks, bringing the characters to the guests while maintaining proper physical distancing. At Magic Kingdom, characters cavalcade along the traditional parade route throughout the day. Others will pop up in new locations, such as Captain Jack Sparrow appearing in Adventureland. At Epcot, guests may see Queen Anna and Elsa venture “into the unknown” on a journey around World Showcase, or Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Pluto and Goofy out for their own world tour. Pixar Animation Studios characters will appear on Hollywood Boulevard at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. And over in Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge, guests should be sure to “move along” if they spot any First Order Stormtroopers. Finally, guests at Disney’s Animal Kingdom may see Disney characters setting sail down Discovery River on special boats.\n\nWhile the majority of the parks’ nightly fireworks displays, parades and indoor shows, are also on hiatus in this first phase of reopening, most of the parks’ rides and attractions have returned with social distancing measures in place. However, it has been made official that some rides and attractions will not be returning. Animal Kingdom’s Primeval Whirl roller coaster has closed permanently, and the park’s Rivers of Light nighttime show has officially ended. Magic Kingdom’s Stitch’s Great Escape attraction has been listed as “temporarily closed” since 2018, but it officially will not reopen. And while it was recently announced that Splash Mountain would soon be rethemed to The Princess and the Frog IP, it did reopen along with Magic Kingdom, and there is no official permanent closing date announced. The attraction’s merchandise has been selling out on a daily basis to collectors and fans of the attraction.\n\nIn regard to future rides and attractions at Walt Disney World Resort, most of those previously announced are still a go, but their openings have been delayed. These include rides and attractions such as TRON Lightcycle Run and Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind roller coasters at Magic Kingdom and Epcot, respectively, and Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure, which was scheduled to open earlier this year, also at Epcot. However, some of the resort’s previously announced attractions have been put on indefinite hold or cancelled altogether, such as the Mary Poppins attraction and the complete reimagining of Spaceship Earth.\n\nOverall, the Walt Disney Resort has done an excellent job bringing back the best aspects of the Disney experience to guests, even with the changes of “the new normal.” Josh D’Amaro, the chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products is certain Walt Disney World Resort has done the right things in the best ways possible with reopening the resort even amid reports of Florida’s largest spike yet of COVID-19 cases. “We are in a new normal right now, so what's happening outside of the gates of Walt Disney World is our new world. I think you know we were one of the first theme parks to close, and we'll be about the last to open. And we spent every minute of every day thinking about how to operate in this new normal that we're in,” said D’Amaro in a recent interview. “I'm exceptionally proud of this group in terms of what they've put together from a protocol perspective and being able to open in a phased and really responsible way. It feels really good in the park. So yeah, the world is a different place, but we feel really prepared to operate in this new environment that we're in. We built our operation, so we can flex. And so, we'll flex with what's happening on the outside from, again, controlled attendance to training our cast members to kind of watch the motions inside of the park.”\n\n•disneyworld.disney.go.com\n\nEmpire Adventures, a company formed with the express goal of reopening Fantasy Island amusement park, Grand Island, New York, announced last month plans to restart the attraction next spring to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the original park's debut. Bill Baldwin, who worked in the park as a character in the park's wild west show, is the chief executive officer of the new company, which is now actively negotiating with banks to secure financing for the project. The price to buy the land and its remaining assets is estimated at a minimum $5 million.\n\nAlthough too early to know for sure, there has been some talk by city officials and officials with the Erie County Industrial Development Agency that there could be a tax break for Empire Adventures if it is necessary to help get the park up and operating.\n\nEven before the COVID pandemic forced many businesses to close for several weeks, the town stood to take a significant hit to its sales tax revenue with Fantasy Island not opening this summer.\n\nFantasy Island's previous owners, Apex Parks Group, closed Fantasy Island in February and sold off some of its rides. Some remain and one of Empire Adventures' partners has rides available. That partner is Marenna Amusements, which has offered to sell 14 classic rides, including a vintage carousel. Flying Bison Brewing Company, Buffalo, New York, has offered its support as a potential sponsor, perhaps within a restaurant or beer garden on the grounds.\n\n•\n\nEmployees at Funland, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, spent the first days of July putting finishing touches on the park's rides in anticipation of opening for the 59th season on July 10. Employees had been sanitizing every surface, and they plan to keep up with strict cleaning procedures throughout the summer.\n\nFunland has been working on a plan with the state since May. The games had reopened two weeks prior.\n\nIan Curry, a fourth-generation family member, said in a news article about the reopening they had worked hard not only on the safety aspect, but also wanted to make sure the park felt and looked the same for their guests to enjoy.\n\n•\n\nThe Neon Museum in Las Vegas, Nevada, announced last month it is offering a 360 Virtual Tour, allowing visitors to \"move\" freely throughout the Neon Boneyard’s sign collection, exploring more than 130 informational hotspots.\n\nThe 360 Virtual Tour launched with an Evening Glow experience as guests virtually toured the museum at night while the signage was illuminated.\n\nIn the virtual tour, once guests enter the museum, a welcome video provides details and instructions on how to navigate the Neon Boneyard. By clicking the white circles along the museum’s pathways, or by using the arrow keys, guests may freely explore the Boneyard, navigating from sign to sign while enjoying 360-degree vantage points at every stop.\n\nThe red, blue and yellow hotspots on the museum signs denote opportunities to learn more, either via pop-up text, photographs or video. By hovering on a red hotspot, guests open a YouTube video with audio featuring a short Neon Museum Gallery Talk or documentary. Hovering over a blue hotspot allows guests to open a written description that includes either historical information or fun facts. Meanwhile, yellow hotspots allow guests to view historical photos from the museum’s archival collection.\n\n•\n\nThe popular playground at Fairytale Farm's Enchanted Walk and Animal Area in Oxfordshire, U.K., reopened on July 4. Called the Huff & Puff Adventure Playground, it includes its very own Storybook Castle, Snakes and Ladders Slide, Combine Harvester and Bird’s Nest Swing. And, of course, with that opening came new measures to ensure that all visitors have space to play while adhering to social distancing guidelines due to COVID-19.\n\nFairytale Farm’s Enchanted Walk and Animal Area reopened to the public on June 20 and officials have been eagerly awaiting the announcement from the government on when playgrounds across the country could reopen.\n\n“We have been working hard to put our reopening plans into action, ensuring new rules keep our visitors safe, but also allow them to have plenty of fun,\" said Nick Laister, owner of Fairytale Farm. \"We are delighted to be welcoming back visitors.\"\n\nAll visitors are required to pre-book tickets online via the Fairytale Farm website for capacity management purposes and will then have contactless entry to the farm.\n\nIndoor seating in the Beanstalk Cafe also reopened on July 4 as did the animal petting and animal feed sales.\n\n•\n\nJuly surges in COVID-19 cases in some U.S. states were impacting openings of some U.S. zoos and aquariums.\n\nArizona's Phoenix Zoo, which had already reopened on June 15, once again closed to foot traffic for visitors in the first week of July due to health concerns amid the coronavirus.\n\nA statement from the zoo said: \"While the safety measures and precautions we have had in place are outstanding, we have been listening to the health experts and concerns of the community and want to do our best to help mitigate the rise of this terrible disease affecting so many.”\n\nWhile foot traffic won’t be allowed, the Cruise the Zoo drive-through options will continue. The next Cruise the Zoo opportunity was set for Aug. 6-10.\n\nMeanwhile, California's Monterey Bay Aquarium, just days away from re-opening, had to end up postponing opening its doors following a new state mandate that required certain sectors to remain closed.\n\nIt had been scheduled to reopen on July 9, but on July 2, the state added Monterey County to its watch list, which eventually triggered a return to tighter restrictions.\n\nAn opening has not been rescheduled for either facility.\n\nRCI supplies Natural Bridge Caverns world’s largest ropes course\n\nAT: Tim Baldwin\n\ntbaldwin@amusementtoday.com\n\nSAN ANTONIO, Texas — Natural Bridge Caverns knows how to recognize success — and expand on it. The unique destination knows the cave tours remains the core of the attraction, but the length of stay for its guests has grown over the years with its above-ground offerings. Its largest retail item is the gem-mining sluice, which the park has rebuilt three times because of its popularity.\n\nIn a similar move, the facility’s ropes course has also evolved. While the previous course had entertained guests for several years, a newer course that opened this year has taken it to a new level, literally. Twisted Trails is the largest ropes course of its kind in the world, according to Natural Bridge Caverns. Supplied by RCI Adventure Products, the course stands 60 feet tall and boasts four levels of challenges and thrills. Fun activities termed weave walk, squid steps and twisted rope are some of the engaging activities for participants. There are 50 elements featured on the structure.\n\nThe combined attraction covers an astounding 12,500 square feet. One of the big features is 685 feet of combined track of Zip Rail. There are seven segments of suspended tubular rail. Riders fly along at speeds from eight to 12 mph.\n\n“We became aware of this product RCI had developed, which they call Sky Rail. We have chosen to use the term Zip Rail since people are very familiar with what a zipline is,” said Travis Wuest, vice president. “It can take turns and curves, but you ride in the exact same harness and the same type of tether. The thing that really sold us on this system is that it is much more user participant driven.”\n\nA big advantage of the giant addition is the significant reduction in the number of staff needed to service the structure. All activities connect.\n\n“Your traditional ziplines are heavy on the operator side. Operators have to insert the guest into the system and make sure of safety transitions,” Wuest told Amusement Today. “We had to have an operator at the sending and receiving ends. Our old four ziplines required eight employees just for those lines. It was intensive on labor. The Sky Rail has introduced a safety system with an automated brake where they come into the landing platform.”\n\nThe Sky Rail works similar to a blocking system on a roller coaster.\n\n“We have operators on every level, but we have reduced our staffing by half even though it is a much larger course,” said Terri Adams, general manager.\n\n“It was a real savings with staffing,” said Wuest. “Less staff but more capacity.”\n\nOn the former setup, guests — particularly lighter ones — would occasionally lose momentum on the ziplines and require assistance. With the new rail, that situation is almost completely eliminated.\n\nParticipants must safely fit into a harness and be 48 inches tall. Younger guests 42 inches in height can participate with a paid chaperone. A maximum weight of 300 pounds applies. The cost to play is $24.99 per 45-minute session. A total of 95 people can participate at one time.\n\nEach morning, safety procedures require a “take down” of a guest from the course. This training keeps operators prepared in such cases of a guest passing out. The safety protocols are instilled into operator training.\n\nFor smaller children, the complex offers Tykes Zip Rail & Ropes Course. At the lower level, youngsters can engage in activities at a scaled-down size but still mimic the skills on the larger course. Parents can accompany them alongside from the ground. This section also features Zip Rail. The cost for the little ones is $7.99.\n\nFor a $5 charge, a climbing course can be added to a Twisted Trails ticket. To do it alone is $9.99. Strategy and agility can be challenged on four different climbing activities.\n\nNatural Bridge Caverns started developing the attraction in early 2019. Construction started in October. A partial preview was offered during the holidays. The final setup was completed in January. With the pandemic situation happening in 2020, management feels the timing was good with the significant savings in staffing this season.\n\nThe facility was able to sell part of the former equipment back to RCI for them to repurpose and one tower was reused in the new design.\n\n“Natural Bridge Caverns has been a favorite of my family my entire life,” said Adams. “There’s a lot of history here. Watching the facility the last 30 years, the [most recent decade] specifically, it’s gone from a regional attraction to a world-class, best-in-class cave operation, including the above-ground attractions. They keep expanding — food operations, the things that they love. Rocks and fun and adventure are what they offer to our visitors. The extended length of stay is important to us. The caves and the natural resources will always be our No. 1 attraction. It’s what we want to preserve and highlight forever. But getting people to come to the caves, we sometimes have to offer other things.”\n\nAdams spent more than four decades as COO of Schlitterbahn, so having worked on the banks of the Comal River, she carries a great respect for making sure natural resources are around to be enjoyed by future generations.\n\n“I like their commitment to the community,” she said. “It’s been a very easy transition.”\n\nNatural Bridge Caverns were discovered 60 years ago. Owned and operated by the Wuest family, the park feels the multi-million-dollar addition is the perfect celebration.\n\n“These courses offer our guests the opportunity to do something physical, to challenge themselves, and in some cases, overcome their fears. It’s an adventure,” said Wuest.\n\n•naturalbridgecaverns.com\n\nUS Thrill Rides unveils new attraction which is both ride and game\n\nAT: Pam Sherborne\n\npsherborne@amusementtoday.com\n\nORLANDO — US Thrill Rides has created a new model of its tried-and-true Unicoaster. Called the Unicoaster Roulette, the new version is designed to look like a giant roulette wheel.\n\nFittingly, it has the tag line of \"The Game You Can Ride,\" since a lucky rider can hit a winning number. A rider can be thrilled and win a prize all at the same time.\n\nThe ride has all the design and technology as the existing US Thrill Rides Unicoaster in that the rider has control of their experience. They can spin their vehicles forward and backward or not spin it at all.\n\n\"This version is literally under development right now in Italy,\" said company founder Bill Kitchen. \"We have several interested parties, but are working out certain details for their unique situations before pulling the trigger. It’s brand new, and the game aspect puts a totally new spin on it while the theming gives it additional options outside of a theme park, especially but not limited to gaming establishments.\"\n\nVisa International SRL is the Italian manufacturer. Mike Gutknecht is the sales representative for the Roulette Unicoaster.\n\nIn this new concept, riders can win a prize or prizes depending on where the ride stops. There are two variables that can determine a winner. One is that the giant rolling wheel stops on the track on a certain number, like Red 24. The other is where the top of wheel, that also is shaped as a roulette wheel, hits a number.\n\nRepeat riders are anticipated with the added appeal of winning prizes. Venues can tailor the prize to fit their needs. Casinos can even offer cash jackpots, making Unicoaster Roulette a centerpiece ride.\n\nThe Unicoaster is 60 feet in diameter with eight arms and 16 seats. The cars are spaced 12 feet apart. It measures 18 feet tall. The ride capacity is 196 people per hour, which generates a two-minute ride cycle.\n\nThe US Thrill Rides Unicoaster, manufactured by Chance Rides and operating in six U.S. locations, has a track record of success. Locations of these rides include Nickelodeon Universe at the Mall of America, Bloomington, Minnesota (Brain Surge), Nickelodeon Universe at American Dream, East Rutherford, New Jersey (Jimmy Neutron’s Atom Smasher) and Belmont Park, San Diego, California (Octotron).\n\nKitchen said the Unicoaster can be configured a number of ways and with various theming to suit the customer, including shields to help deflect aerosols, in addition to following distancing guidelines. There is a beach ball themed Unicoaster already on the drawing boards.\n\n•usthrillrides.com\n\nMack Rides supplies double coaster\n\nEfteling opens Max & Moritz coasters targeted for younger riders\n\nAT: Tim Baldwin\n\ntbaldwin@amusementtoday.com\n\nKAATSCHUEVEL, Netherlands — On June 20, the fairy tale land of Efteling debuted its newest attraction. Like many offerings in the whimsical theme park, it is aimed at the younger set. Max & Moritz is a powered coaster built by Germany’s Mack Rides. In fact, it’s two.\n\nThe attraction is themed to the well-known German poem by Wilhelm Busch from 1865, “Max und Moritz,” about two naughty schoolboys. In Efteling, they live in a village with their mother Frau Schmetterling, who makes special cuckoo clocks. Her sons drive the villagers to despair with their tricks. When Frau Schmetterling locks up Max and Moritz for punishment in her cuckoo clock workshop, they try to escape with self-built soap boxes. Guests are along for the ride.\n\nThe ride is positioned on a site formerly occupied by an Intamin bobsled ride that opened in 1985. It was retired on September 1, 2019 to make way for the new coasters.\n\nEfteling’s CEO Fons Jurgens said, \"After saying goodbye to the iconic Bobsleigh ride last year, young visitors to Max & Moritz will be able to share their first roller coaster experience with the whole family. It is a very contemporary and real Efteling ride. During the ride and in the surrounding area, visitors will find out about Max and Moritz’ tricks and mischief.”\n\nMuch of that is conveyed through theming. Like numerous attractions at the park, the thematic craftsmanship is impressive. Efteling opened in 1952 with its Fairy Tale Forest. It has never lost sight of its core audience and now welcomes more than five million guests a year.\n\nMack Rides is known for its powered coaster rides throughout Europe and beyond.\n\n“The ride is unique as the trains depart the station in opposite directions,” said Christian von Elverfeldt, chief executive office, Mack Rides. “Therefore, they will pass each other on the mid-course of the track. As the trains pass each other several times, the riders can interact. This is especially fun for families.”\n\nMax & Moritz is geared towards children aged between four and 10 years old but is also suitable for the whole family. The height requirement to ride is one meter.\n\nA seven-year-old disembarking the ride excitedly said, “After the first round I thought it was a pity that it was already over. But because Max jumped on the giant whoopee cushion, all of a sudden, we went again, real fast! And the music went faster too!”\n\nWhen Amusement Today inquired why the decision to remove the Bob ride, Jurgens replied, “Roller coasters like the Bob are increasingly difficult to keep in good condition. In the next few years, investments and adjustments would be needed for the maintenance and operation of the roller coaster. Unfortunately, this made replacement inevitable. A lot of fans were sad about the decision, because for many of them, the Bob was their first roller coaster experience. Our new double family roller coaster is a very good replacement. A powered coaster is new for Efteling, and now our attractions offer has become even more diverse.”\n\nMax & Moritz uses the same station as the former Bob ride. Both tracks are in place within and depart in opposite directions.\n\n“Doing two tracks and using the former station didn’t present any challenges,” said von Elverfeldt. “Our track design and manufacturing are so precise, and we have to deal with buildings, theming elements and plants anyway.”\n\nThe ride stands just shy of 20 feet tall and reaches speeds of more than 22 mph. While each track has a length of 984.3 feet, that is essentially doubled as the ride experience involves traveling the circuit twice. In addition to thematic props, the track curves and twists to place riders in visual proximity to the other train. With no need for a lift hill, the track is all action.\n\n“The powered coaster is a product we have had in our portfolio for quite some time and we see it regaining strength in the market,” von Elverfeldt told AT. “The advantages are phenomenal — you can position the train at any point on the track and determine the speed and travel direction. It’s great if you want families to enjoy the ride, as you are able to fine tune the speed and ride experience during commissioning.”\n\nVisitors get to choose which track to ride: Max (blue) or Moritz (green). Each track has its own exciting experience with sharp curves and accelerations. With two themed storylines, it further entices guests to ride both sides to see it all.\n\nBecause the ride is based on a German tale, Elverfeldt found a personal connection to the project. “Efteling is a very special customer for us as their target audience is the whole family just like ours. With the heritage of De Bob, we knew that this coaster had to be not just a replacement but an extraordinary highlight for the 2020 season. The cars of Max & Moritz represent our home and heritage very well and many details on the cars can be found in our neighborhood, so there are many emotions attached to this design.”\n\nThe whole area has been redesigned and themed in less than a year. Joining the coasters in the area is a new eating establishment at the Max & Moritz Square. Frau Boltes KÃ¼che serves French fries, snacks and chicken bites with a thematic flair that ties into the new attraction.\n\n‘Call of the wild’ returns as California animal attractions reopen\n\nWith enhanced safety,\n\nseveral zoos are back\n\nto educate, entertain\n\nAT: Dean Lamanna\n\ndlamanna@amusementtoday.com\n\nPALM DESERT, Calif. — Triple-digit temperatures are nothing new to The Living Desert Zoo and Gardens, where the arid environment, accented by ruggedly beautiful foothills, gets the full brunt of Southern California’s summer sun.\n\nMidday on a Friday in early July, as thermometers onsite nudged 109 degrees, wildlife sounds comingled with the enthusiastic reactions of strolling, face-masked families. The park’s desert-acclimated animal denizens basked or grazed lazily in shaded areas or retreated to their shelters to nap.\n\nWhat is new at the 80-acre facility and three other Golden State animal attractions that have resumed operation amid the novel coronavirus pandemic — the San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo Safari Park and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom — is a redoubled commitment by operators and staff to educate and entertain guests. They are not taking for granted that their sprawling grounds and mostly outdoor exhibits have, in this new realm of physical distancing and enhanced safety measures, made it possible for them to return.\n\n“Prior to reopening to the general public June 15, we did a big media push highlighting our COVID-19 precautions designed to keep the guests, staff and animals safe,” said Allen Monroe, president and CEO of The Living Desert, sharing with Amusement Today his surprise at how quickly members and visitors have adapted to the online reservation system the park implemented with its new protocols. “I think guests actually like knowing there’s a slot reserved for them.”\n\nThe zoo is following all local and state mandates. California required residents to wear face coverings outside the home starting June 19. On July 13, Gov. Gavin Newsom, in a rollback of the state’s phased reopening, ordered a halt to inside dining, entertainment and several other types of indoor businesses.\n\n“We have to remind a few guests to keep their face coverings on, especially as the day gets warmer, but when we explain that it helps keep the staff and volunteers healthy, they comply,” said Monroe, noting that about 90-95% of the park, which is limiting its admissions to 200 guests per hour (about 25% of capacity), is available for exploration. “We have closed a couple buildings as well as some high-touch outdoor areas, such as the carousel, kids’ play area and petting zoo.”\n\nFor added safety, park staff was disinfecting counters, doors, restrooms and drinking fountains hourly.\n\nThe Living Desert recently unveiled a nearly one-acre, $3 million exhibit called Australian Adventures. In keeping with the zoo’s mission to support and promote desert conservation in the southwestern U.S., Africa and elsewhere in the world, it comprises a net-canopied, largely free-roaming habitat housing two wallaby species, colorful birds, reptiles and other creatures from Down Under.\n\n“There is something magical about having a wallaby hop across the sidewalk in front of you,” Monroe said. “Australia has quite the cast of animal characters from desert habitats with compelling stories to tell, so it seemed natural to add the continent to our guest experience. One of this habitat’s main messages revolves around climate change and how the impacts we are feeling here in Southern California with increased temperatures, drought and fires are also occurring on the other side of the world, and our need to share the responsibility for taking better care of our planet.”\n\nAlthough it reportedly lost $3.5 million and had to reduce its staff by two thirds during the state-mandated spring shutdown, The Living Desert is in a celebratory mood as it marks its fifth decade this year.\n\n“When you have a nonprofit still going strong after 50 years, it indicates that the mission resonates with the community you are serving,” Monroe said. “It’s great when I meet someone in the park who visited as a child and is now bringing their grandchildren to discover the wonder of wildlife and spark that passion to care for the natural world. When you get a multigenerational reach, you know you are doing something right.”\n\nA couple hours to the southwest, the San Diego Zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park, both administered by the nonprofit conservation organization San Diego Zoo Global, reopened to the general public June 20. They kept their members and followers engaged largely through social media activities and more than a dozen animal cams during the three-month shutdown.\n\nNow, fans once again can experience the San Diego parks’ wildlife and visit with some of the newest residents — an Andean bear cub, a pigmy hippopotamus calf and a newborn giraffe among them.\n\nTo ensure a safe and healthy guest experience, the parks have enacted a range of temporary changes complying with guidelines outlined by local and state health authorities. Initial protocols included reducing the number of guests on the grounds, increasing the number of hand-sanitizing locations, maintaining robust cleaning routines, adding one-way path modifications and providing signage for physical distancing.\n\nDuring the reopening phase, the zoo’s Guided Bus Tour, Kangaroo Bus and Skyfari Aerial Tram, and the Safari Park’s Africa Tram, were unavailable, as were shows and experiences that traditionally draw larger attendance.\n\n“Through both our wildlife sanctuaries, we offer an important service to the community by providing a safe outdoor experience… where [visitors] can learn about wildlife, connect with nature and find ways to join us on our mission to save species,” said Shawn Dixon, COO of San Diego Zoo Global. “Although the next visit by our guests may feel a bit different, I’m confident our first-time guests, members, donors, volunteers and staff will help us make ‘different’ great.”\n\nAbout 500 miles north, in Vallejo, outside San Francisco, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (SFDK) resumed partial operation July 2 as an animals-only experience in accordance with state, local and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. (The park’s rides and other attractions remained closed at AT’s press time pending a broader amusement park reopening green light from the state.)\n\nFor now, the park has turned the clock back to its pre-Six Flags days in 1986, when it first opened as Marine World, a premier zoological park and aquarium — rolling out what it is calling the Marine World Experience. Guests can visit SFDK’s current famous resident, a year-old lion cub named Cain, and other wildlife through daily educational sessions. Additional offerings include scheduled talks with animal care specialists throughout the day along with animal demonstrations in outdoor venues that are sanitized and marked for social distancing.\n\n“We are very excited to be able to open and welcome our guests back,” said Don McCoy, park president, emphasizing that the health and safety of SFDK’s patrons and team are paramount. The park’s numerous coronavirus mitigation protocols “are designed to create an environment where our guests can have fun… and feel safe while doing so.”\n\nSFDK has established an online reservation system to limit capacity and minimize proximity exposure among guests. New technologies being deployed include state-of-the-art thermal imaging for temperature checks, advanced security screening for touchless bag checks and expanded mobile food ordering.\n\nFor more on their limited operating schedules, admission registration requirements and COVID-19 safety measures, visit the parks’ respective websites.\n\n•livingdesert.org\n\n•sandiegozoo.org\n\n•sixflags.com\n\nInterlink LG, Simworx and Falcon’s Creative partner for a world’s first\n\nJurassic Island combines multiple experiences on Trans Studio ride\n\nAT: Tim Baldwin\n\ntbaldwin@amusementtoday.com\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia — Rides and attractions in indoor malls are not necessarily something new, but not common either. Multiple suppliers partnered to bring forth a first-of-its-kind water ride at Trans Studio Cibubur. For the first time, Jurassic Island combines a water flume, 3D simulator and splashwater drop into a dramatic crowd-pleasing marquee ride.\n\nTrans Studio’s first theme park was Trans Studio Makassar, which opened in 2006. From that initial success, the template has been repeated in Bandung, Bali and Cibubur.\n\nWith the Cibubur property, innovations took place to make that particular location have a signature ride. Jurassic Island demonstrated a successful partnership between Interlink LG Ltd., Simworx and Falcon’s Creative Group.\n\n“The idea for an Immersive SuperFlume ride came about four years ago when I was sitting on a boat in the Irish Sea having a beer with the then sales director of Simworx, Edward Pawley,” said John Davies, commercial director for Interlink. “I asked him whether it would be possible to place a Simworx Immersive Tunnel onto one of our SuperFlume rides, and his answer was ‘of course, it is possible.’ The idea was born and history subsequently made.”\n\nThe pair further surmised the boat could be placed on a motion base and, along with 3D glasses, create an immersive virtual experience during a flume ride.\n\nTrans Studio wanted something unique for the new installation near Jakarta. Interlink had previously built a standard SuperFlume for the company, so the relationship and confidence in the company had been established.\n\n“The hard bit was to get our design team to turn the idea into reality,” said Davies. “Challenges like how to lock the boat securely to the motion base, synchronize the flow of the boats around the circuit with the Simworx Immersive Tunnel zone and how to maximize throughput due to it being stopped for the duration of the tunnel experience [were new].”\n\n“The project was in development for around a year and a half, with the contract initially being signed at IAAPA [Expo] in Orlando in 2017,” said Terry Monkton, CEO, Simworx. “We designed, manufactured and tested everything in the U.K. before shipping it all over to Jakarta to be installed over there.”\n\nPlacing attractions in a mall comes with inherent challenges, but the signed contract added a few more to the drawing board.\n\n“Typically, our Immersive Tunnels are usually in an indoor setting anyway so that wasn’t so much of an issue compared to having water indoors and around technology that is usually in a dry environment,” said Monkton. “It was things we usually don’t have to worry about such as making our 3D glasses waterproof as well as how the water would be drained away from the motion base to allow it to work. We had to come up with a boat locking solution to ensure that the boat could be secured to the motion base allowing for movement but again released to allow it to complete the ride. Even small things such as finding a paint finish for the screens that would be waterproof in case of any splashes [were addressed].”\n\nFurther challenges then began to emerge over and above the initial Immersive SuperFlume design, because this one was to be installed inside a building on one of the upper floors.\n\n“A standard SuperFlume ride would exert enormous loadings on the floor, mainly due to the volume of water in the channel, so we had to rethink several aspects. Our design team is extremely talented, but inventing lightweight water was pushing them a little too far!” Davies joked. “We completely redesigned the water flow system to reduce the overall volume of water required. The vertical lift then had to be constructed in a lighter way than normal. The general lack of space available also meant various other redesigns were required — including how to get the ride components and boats inside the building and up to the relevant floors.\n\n“Once these challenges had all been overcome and the ride was commissioned and opened to the public, we had a world’s-first ride — the first time that a flume ride had been combined with a 3D motion base and Immersive Tunnel. The ride instantly became a big hit with all family age groups and is their most popular ride,” said Davies.\n\n\"It’s always exciting to be able to work on a world’s-first attraction, and the Jurassic Island Immersive Superflume was certainly that, said Jason Ambler, VP of digital media, Falcon’s Creative Group. “The visceral thrills you get from a water-based flume ride combined with the rich storytelling and simulator ride capabilities of an immersive tunnel produces a totally unique and unexpected experience. As you are boarding the boat for the first time, you would never think you are about to attach to a motion base and engage with a 3D movie that wraps all around you. The seamless transition into the reveal of the 3D media is definitely our favorite part of the ride.”\n\nTrans Studio bases their attractions on Hollywood movie themes. While no official licensed IP is used, the familiar dinosaur genre follows the obvious, popular formula. Guests board one of five 16-passenger boats. The flume portion takes riders through themed dinosaur environments, before “something goes wrong” and screaming in the distance commences. Lifted from the water via a conveyor, the boat is positioned in the tunnel portion. Boats are firmly locked in place on the motion base platform and feel all the action during the 90-second film provided by Falcon’s Creative. Exiting the theatrical portion, the boats float through more themed passages before entering the vertical lift. Lights go out and sirens flash as riders are raised more than 40 feet. Mall patrons can watch as boats emerge and plunge below them in the stacked indoor entertainment facility.\n\nOriginal specs planned for the ride to be more than six minutes. The end result offers guests a longer experience clocking in around eight minutes. Hourly capacity is 480, which is limited because of the experience in the motion base and immersive film.\n\n“We also have aroma’s installed, to trigger another one of your senses, so you can even smell the dinosaurs breath when he roars,” said Monkton. “We also have integrated 4D effects like wind and water spritz that complement the immersive movie.”\n\nThe footprint to the ride is 377 feet by 180 feet (115 x 55 meters). The length is almost 1,000 feet long at 300 meters.\n\n“Thanks to the existing facility's skilled leadership and easily navigable infrastructure, we experienced a comfortable and easy installation while working on the final programming onsite,” said Ambler. “Through careful planning and simply masterful execution, the ride and show experience is jam-packed with intense dinosaur action and fully leverages the attraction system and special effects in the theater.\"\n\nUniversal Studios Florida premieres high-tech Bourne Stuntacular\n\nAT: David Fake\n\nSpecial to Amusement Today\n\nORLANDO — The Bourne Stuntacular, Universal Studios Florida’s new stage show officially opened to guests on June 30 after a brief technical rehearsal period. The show, which has replaced The Terminator 2: 3-D Battle Across Time on the park’s Hollywood Boulevard, is based on the wildly successful Bourne film franchise starring Matt Damon, which has grossed more than $1 billion since the release of the original motion picture, The Bourne Identity, in 2002. Within the attraction, guests enter the world of Jason Bourne, the ultimate spy assassin and rogue agent of the Black Ops division of the CIA, in an all-new adventure outside, but parallel to, the existing films.\n\nThe Bourne Stuntacular’s preshow consists of a surveillance briefing given on overhead screens by Nicky Parsons, the franchise’s character played by actress Julia Stiles. In the briefing, Parsons explains that the guests will be part of a mission made possible through new proprietary technology by stating, “This prototype observation and evaluation mode uses a new protocol for enhanced virtual surveillance. For all intents and purposes you will be right there live following Jason Bourne wherever he goes as he encounters danger, traverses various locations, even advances through time zones. Your mission: find Bourne, then observe, but do not engage.”\n\nOnce inside the theater, guests are transported into the world of Bourne, where they experience an exciting and impressive mix of storytelling, stunts and technology — just like in the films. However, this time, the audience is watching the action play out live on stage. Guests actually feel the action through practical effects, such as: wind, water, flames, and deep bass audio combined with the awe-inspiring visuals of the stunts, projection mapping, LED wall, lifts, and robotic, moving set pieces — including three full-size vehicles. Details are not overlooked in and even after The Bourne Stuntacular. One such detail is the theater’s exit doors that open into the Bourne gift shop. These doors give the appearance of being blown off their hinges during the show’s climactic finale, a detail only visible from the gift shop at the end of each show prior to the doors opening for audience egress.\n\n“At Universal Orlando Resort we are known for our ability to immerse our guests in incredible environments. In this case, the world of Jason Bourne. We took those intense storylines, combined them with extreme stunts, groundbreaking technology, and practical effects, so we could create the excitement that is the Bourne franchise, right in front of the audience. It takes a really talented team to pull this off, and we got the best in the business to come together to do just that,” said Deb Buynak, the resort’s vice president of entertainment.\n\nThe talented team has successfully blurred the lines of cinema and stage show in The Bourne Stuntacular. Its magic was made possible by Universal’s Creative and Entertainment teams working in concert with Renaissance Entertainment (story), Cinesite Studios (supplier of the immense HD LED screen measuring 3,640-square feet at 130-feet wide and 28-feet tall), Tait (staging design and manufacturer of moving parts, lifts, and scenic), and Action Horizons (Hollywood stunt design and choreography).\n\nFrank Marshall, the franchise’s award-winning producer, worked with Renaissance Entertainment to create the show’s story, and then on site with the Universal Orlando team during the show’s final run-throughs to help tweak the show to create an authentic experience for fans of the franchise. Marshall said of the show, “I can truly say that The Bourne Stuntacular not only stays true to the essence of the movies, but also delivers next-level action that will make you feel like you are right there by Jason Bourne’s side in the middle of a crazy action sequence.”\n\nUniversal Orlando Resort’s decision to open The Bourne Stuntacular stage show amid the resort’s own reopening after its three-month COVID-19 closure, bucks the trend set by other Central Florida Parks regarding previously scheduled openings of new attractions. Busch Gardens Tampa’s Iron Gwazi and SeaWorld Orlando’s Icebreaker roller coasters, as well as Epcot’s Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure, had all been scheduled to open earlier this year, but their openings have been indefinitely postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, the subsequent park closures, and the limited-capacity reopenings.\n\nScene75 works together, keeps guests safe together\n\nAT: John W.C. Robinson\n\njrobinson@amusementtoday.com\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio — Scene75 actually closed its FECs voluntarily early in the beginning of the COVID pandemic.\n\n“To uphold our core value of putting people first, I announced our decision on March 12 to temporarily close all Scene75 Entertainment Center locations in advance of two of our busiest weeks of the year,” said CEO Jonah Sandler.\n\nOne of the largest family entertainment centers in the country was also one of the very first to reopen after the recent pandemic shutdowns. Scene75 Entertainment Centers reopened the doors to its Columbus, Ohio, location on June 19 with new operating hours. The Cincinnati and Cleveland locations followed soon after, both opening their doors once again on June 10.\n\n“We opened Columbus first because it was the biggest location and offered us the most opportunity to test the waters,” said Sandler. “We’re all in this together. I know everyone’s been saying this from the beginning, but what I see is our guests truly appreciate all the steps and measures we’ve taken to keep people safe.”\n\nDuring the shutown, Sandler had to cut the company’s total staff from 750 people to 35. But during the closure, Sandler and his remaining team members developed what they call a “Stay Safe Playbook” with unique instructions for each attraction. “We’ve scooted things out, we’ve painted, we did extra cleaning,” he said. “We’ve redone our employee handbooks. We used all that time to prepare to be bigger, better, stronger when we [opened].”\n\nWith that plan in mind, the theme of the recent reopenings has been “Stay Safe Together.”\n\nThe basics of the plan were similar to others that have been adapted within the industry. “We limited capacity to 50%, added sanitation staff, created one-way entrances and exits, required masks for all, encourage social distancing as well as have hand santizer in abundance,” explained Sandler. Bowling alleys were open every other lane, using the empty ones in between as a social-distancing buffer between players. Bowling balls are wiped down and sanitized between rounds. Every trip on the go-karts and other ride attractions ends with a sanitation crew wiping down the steerseats, restraints and other equipment.\n\nScene75 built its name originally via a significant following on social media. The opening of its original Dayton location pioneered many techniques for engaging its social media audience. Playing into this openness with their clientele, Sandler and his team made the Stay Safe Playbook available to all guests and potential visitors online via their website ahead of the openings.\n\n“By doing so, our guests continue to have a better idea of what to expect upon arrival,” said Sandler. “For some, it's what ultimately makes them comfortable enough to visit.”\n\nThe entertainment center chain continued to play to its social media strengths throughout the shutdown. Creating the themed posts \"QuaranScene,\" Scene75 team members engaged guests with trivia, online fun as well as activities that parents and kids could do together at home.\n\nAs an incentive to encourage the return of guests, Scene75 began offering a special Gold Member deal. For just $29 per year, a guest can become a gold member where they'll get $10 to use on games or attractions every day (up to a $2,700 value).\n\nSandler plans to reopen Scene75's Pittsburgh location soon, pending state approval. The original Dayton, Ohio, location is still undergoing repair work from the damaging 2019 tornadoes that struck the area. Currently, Sandler and his team plan to hold a grand reopening of that location in Fall 2020.\n\n•scene75.com\n\nSK8 House Entertainment Center finally opened its doors on July 13. The family entertainment center, located in a vacated Marshalls store at the Lynnhaven North shopping area in Virginia Beach, was meant to open to the public earlier but the coronavirus pandemic caused a delay.\n\n\"I am excited, more than you can see behind this mask,” said Operations Manager Robert Barnuevo. The center is intentionally set up to “have something for everybody,\" according to Barnuevo.\n\nThe entertainment center's biggest attraction: two roller skating rinks. During limited operation due to COVID, the business has reduced the skating rink capacity from 300 to 125.\n\nThe next step for SK8 House will be opening the food and drink stands inside the building. In the meantime, a food truck outside provides an option for visitors.\n\n•\n\nBoomers! of Boca Raton, Florida, temporarily suspended operations on March 19 out of an abundance of caution, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Governor of Florida.\n\nHowever, after a nearly three month shutdown, the amusement center reopened on June 29 with new health and safety measures to protect both guests and employees.\n\n“Right away guests will notice signage reminding everyone to maintain six feet of physical distance between groups and to wash or sanitize their hands frequently. There are sanitizing stations around the park and for some attractions, guests are required to use hand sanitizer prior to participating,” said General Manager Andrew Marciante. “Team members are, of course, sanitizing all high-touch surfaces throughout the day, and the restrooms are temporarily closed several times a day for deep cleaning.”\n\n•\n\nA new paintball facility and axe throwing attraction opened on July 4 at Gator Mike's in Cape Coral, Florida. The local park offers a variety of attractions, like arcade games, zip-lining, go-karts and mini golf.\n\nWhile following CDC guidelines, the 10-acre park allows for a safe social distance while having fun.\n\n•\n\nVirtuix, creator of the Omni Arena virtual reality esports attraction, has unveiled \"Blackbeard: The Trials of Skull Island,\" its latest game for Omni Arena. In Blackbeard, up to four players work together as pirates to loot treasure, fight villainous foes, and achieve high scores on the leaderboard.\n\nEach game has four distinct rounds, including a cooperative puzzle challenge and a final boss fight, providing players with lots of variety and reasons to play again and again.\n\n“Blackbeard is Omni Arena's most kid-friendly game to date,” said Jan Goetgeluk, founder and CEO of Virtuix. “It's also a blast for adults and esports players. We designed the game for high repeat play. It's easy for everyone to play, but thanks to its variety and depth, it's hard to master. No two rounds are ever the same.”\n\n•\n\nAir Zoo Aerospace & Science Museum officially reopened to the public on July 13. The Portage, Michigan, location enforced social distancing and new safety guidelines to ensure all guests stay safe and healthy while visiting.\n\nThe Air Zoo’s indoor amusement park rides, flight simulators, Missions Theater and several of the hands-on Flexhibits and KEVA stations are temporarily closed for guest safety. The Air Zoo plans to reintroduce these experiences when they are deemed safe to do so.\n\nIn the meantime, new exhibitions and enhancements to current exhibits are being deployed throughout the remainder of the year. Due to state-mandated limited capacity, visitors must choose from either a morning or an afternoon visit.\n\n•\n\nWaukesha, Wisconsin, opened its first Urban Air Adventure Park on July 17. The grand opening of the 72,000-square-foot Urban AIr was limited to 100 guests per time slot, due to COVID restrictions.\n\n“Pre-COVID we had some of the strictest cleaning procedures out of all of the adventure parks,” said Special Events and Marketing Coordinator Michelle Faretta. “Post-COVID there isn’t much we can do additional other than following the CDC guidelines — PPE gear for our employees and increased cleaning procedures as well as some hand sanitizing stations.”\n\nAttractions for the indoor adventure park include: go-karts, an adventure hub, spin zone bumper cars, flip zone bumper cars, a sky rider, ropes course, climbing walls, battle beam, a wipe out-warrior course, a tubes playground, a 7-and-under zone, Apex trampolines, dodgeball, rumble track, slam-dunk drop zone and a cafe and patio area.\n\n•\n\nThe first ever open-air, single-level golf-themed entertainment center has been opened in August, Georgia, by Topgolf.\n\nThe venue opened on July 3 with outdoor hitting bays fitted with the Toptracer technology to provide innovative games and offer simulated play at some of the world’s most famous courses such as Pebble Beach and St Andrews. There is also a nine-hole miniature golf course and a recreation area with backyard-style lawns with fire pits.\n\nTopgolf has 60 locations across the U.S. and internationally, providing golf-emphasis facilities with games, climate-controlled hitting bays as well as food and beverage including bars, event space and other facilities that entertain more than 20 million people annually.\n\nTalley Amusements makes efforts to rebuild its season\n\nAT: B. Derek Shaw\n\nbdshaw@amusementtoday.com\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas — Losing two of its biggest fairs, the Ohio State Fair and the State Fair of Texas, due to COVID-19, Talley Amusements, Inc. had to pull together a season playing at spots normally not on the schedule. The restart came about only after a concerted effort to educate Governor Greg Abbott about the need for the amusement industry to get back to business in the Lone Star State.\n\nMary Talley, co-owner of Talley Amusements, wrote a comprehensive statement on why the amusement industry is essential along with the hundreds of other businesses relying on that partnership. The article landed on the governor’s desk. “After some back-and-forth emails from one of his policy advisors, he announced that carnivals and amusement parks were allowed to operate at 50% capacity (at the owner’s discretion) in any county that currently has more than 1,000 positive Covid cases,” said Talley.\n\nThe carnival company opened June 19, utilizing malls and privately owned properties to rebuild its season. Some of the cancelled spring events are having the carnival come in to help generate some revenue. It has not been easy during these times.\n\nTalley said, “It has definitely been a daily struggle. Each city has interpreted the executive order differently and I have had to defend this order and fight for our rights to work. Not all cities have been an issue. We have had several that chose to ignore the rule of law so to speak. Our hometown, Fort Worth, has been our champion on following the [Executive Order] GA 27/28. I am grateful for our Mayor Betsy Price and her staff support along with Governor Abbott. Without them, we would have had a very difficult time navigating through this.”\n\nThe amusement operator has a very comprehensive COVID-19 plan in place. “We have handwashing stations, social distancing signage and marks on the ground, and signage all over our carnival park. All employees and guests are required to wear a mask while on the grounds. If they are not riders, we allow face shields. If our guests forgot to bring theirs, we have them available for purchase at our cost. We also are diligent in keeping our rides sanitized after each cycle. We [practice] social distancing on the rides, [by] loading every other seat. We also temperature check our employees daily,” said Talley.\n\nThese days Talley Amusements operates with 25 rides, 10 games and seven food stands, playing up to 200 miles outside the Dallas/Fort Worth metro area. “I would say we are getting about half of what we normally gross,” said Talley. “Each time a new [executive] order is released, it creates some pause for some [cities and towns] but for the most part, we are grateful to have some revenue coming in. I do wish the federal government would allow a second round of the Payroll Protection Program being that we can only operate at 50%.”\n\nReception to the operation has been positive. “We have had very little negative pushback from the public,” said Talley. “Honestly, people are glad to have a place to go and have some fun. We are offering armbands daily because of the 50% capacity issue and we open at 6 p.m. because of the Texas summer heat.”\n\n“We truly missed going to the Ohio State Fair this year. And of course, the State Fair of Texas is always a fair we enjoy working. We are very sad that our beautiful Texas Star Ferris Wheel will not operate,” said Talley.\n\n•talleyamusements.com\n\n2020 State Fair of Texas canceled due to COVID-19 concerns\n\nDALLAS — After extensive consideration of the current landscape related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the health and safety of all fairgoers, staff, business partners, and overall community, the State Fair of Texas Board of Directors voted to cancel the 2020 State Fair of Texas.\n\n“This was an extremely tough decision. The health and safety of all involved has remained our top priority throughout the decision-making process,” said Gina Norris, board chair for the State Fair of Texas. “One of the greatest aspects of the Fair is welcoming each and every person who passes through our gates with smiles and open arms. In the current climate of COVID-19, there is no feasible way for the Fair to put proper precautions in place while maintaining the Fair environment you know and love.”\n\n“While we cannot predict what the COVID-19 pandemic will look like in September, the recent surge in positive cases is troubling for all of North Texas. The safest and most responsible decision we could make for all involved at this point in our 134-year history is to take a hiatus for the 2020 season.”\n\nThe Fair’s commitment to its nonprofit mission of promoting agriculture, education, and community involvement will continue. The Big Tex Youth Livestock Auction and livestock shows, Big Tex Scholarship Program, Big Tex Urban Farms, and the community outreach initiatives will continue to have funding and the fair committed to maintaining as many participation opportunities as possible as it relates to livestock and creative arts.\n\nThe decision-making process has been thoughtful and extensive. The fair gathered input from fairgoers, concessionaires, commercial exhibitors, Midway operators, auto manufacturers, business partners, staff, medical experts, and government officials to consider while coming to this conclusion.\n\nWith health and safety as the top priority, the management team and the board of directors have been discussing all potential scenarios since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The team has brainstormed many ways to make this year’s event occur, creating various contingency plans and approaches, but knew that all these plans fail if the annual celebration of Texas contributes to any further spread of the virus through our community.\n\n“While we are heartbroken at the notion of not welcoming more than 2.5 million of our closest friends for this annual celebration of the Lone Star State, the excitement we feel in moving forward with planning the 2021 State Fair of Texas and keeping this 134-year tradition alive will keep us motivated until we can greet our fairgoers, seasonal staff, and business partners again in a safe environment,’” said Mitchell Glieber, president of the State Fair of Texas.\n\nThis will be the first time since World War II that the State Fair of Texas has not opened. The State Fair of Texas has previously canceled fairs because of World War I (1918), planning for the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition and 1937 Pan American Exposition at Fair Park (1935-1937), and World War II (1942-1945).\n\n•bigtex.com\n\nNorth American Midway Entertainment (NAME) came up with a plan to hold a Fairgrounds Fun Park at the Indiana State Fairgrounds, a six-week event. However, what started as a good idea, did not come to fruition. The 50-ride midway was going to run July 31 – September 7. It was canceled after NAME organizers consulted with state health officials on the latest COVID-19 data for the state. There has been an increase in positive cases as well as hospitalizations in Indiana. “The carnival provider and state fairgrounds had a thorough and very thoughtful plan on how to conduct the event safely but have concluded that it’s best not to move forward with the Fun Park,” said Dr. Kristina Box, Indiana State Health Commissioner to WTWO-TV.\n\n“While we are saddened that our event cannot take place, we understand the current situation and will always put public health and safety as our number one priority,” said Danny Huston, NAME CEO, in an emailed statement. A small 4-H livestock show will take place on the grounds in the absence of other events.\n\n•\n\nEJ Dean, owner of Fiesta Shows recently set up six drive-thru stands at his off-season quarters in Salisbury, Massachusetts. Dubbed Fair Food Express, the carnival food operation is along Route 1. Since June 4 and running through Labor Day, September 7, the stands are operating seven days a week starting at 11:30 a.m. each day. Offerings include fried dough, fried Oreos, fried peanut butter cups, sausages, hotdogs, cotton candy and caramel apples, among other carnival favorites.\n\n“The menu certainly isn’t normal fare and we are certainly not attempting to do that. But it is a unique experience and it is something that people can experience at different events throughout the summer. But, where so many have been canceled, they won’t be able to have those experiences without this,” said Dean when he spoke with the Newbury Port News.\n\nAs a result of this creative arrangement, 14 people are working who would otherwise be out of a job during the pandemic. Dean also indicated that due to the response of Fair Food Express so far, the company may consider making this location the site of a full-time restaurant in the future.\n\n•\n\nThe fairgrounds of the Alaska State Fair, Palmer, are the new home for drive-in movies these days. In participation with Showboss AV and Event Management and the United Way, the Pop-Up Drive In Movies at The Fair has quickly become a popular event, since its mid-May start. Two different movies are shown each Friday and Saturday evening on a 23-foot-wide by 13-foot-tall LED screen. Admission is $25 per carload. Reservations must be made online. Check-in is done by vehicle license plate, make and model. A carload equals as many people in a car that is legally allowed by law.\n\nLike many other fairgrounds across North America, they too offer food sales with the moniker, Food Truck Fare at the Fairgrounds. Each Wednesday and Saturday, up to a dozen vendors are participating.\n\nIn mid-May, the late August fair cancelled for this year — the first time since World War II. The fair will be back August 26 - September 6, 2021, with Golden Wheel Amusements providing the midway.\n\n•\n\nBill Ogg was recently named the new Executive Director of the beleaguered Nebraska State Fair, Grand Island. In fair management since 1980, Ogg managed state fairs in Montana, Colorado and Kansas. Most recently he was general manager of the Walla Walla Fair and Frontier Days in Washington state since 2017. He was able to grow carnival receipts by 11%. In March, the position came open when the previous director Lori Cox stepped down, citing health reasons. She is expected to act as a consultant to the fair. Previously the two worked together at the Montana State Fair.\n\n“Of the candidates we interviewed, Bill is the most seasoned, experienced Fair person,” said Beth Smith, board chair for the Nebraska State Fair to KRVN radio. “His management skills have proven to successfully execute fairs and large nationally sanctioned events.”\n\nAs of press time, a scaled-down Nebraska State Fair is still on for August 28 to September 7. A carnival midway would only happen if Hall County is in Phase 4 of Governor Pete Ricketts’ reopening plan.

To fill the closure gap, organizers and local groups are putting on fireworks, drive-through pancake breakfasts and other events that people can enjoy at a safe distance.\n\n“You can’t cancel Stampede spirit, so we’re trying to keep that alive even though we can’t celebrate in the traditional way,” said Dana Peers, president and chairman of the Calgary Stampede Board in The Globe and Mail interview.\n\nScotsman’s Hill, is a popular spot to watch nightly fireworks that are always part of the Stampede. This year residents were able to enjoy two different nights of fireworks from their homes that included a view of the city skyline. The daily pancake breakfasts, a long-tradition of Stampede are taking place this year via drive-through lanes of cars and trucks.\n\n“For lots of people, it’s synonymous with the Calgary Stampede that they’re going to have a free pancake breakfast,” Peers said. “We wanted to keep that tradition alive and the new rules have brought us to this drive-through method.”\n\nThe Calgary Chamber of Commerce held a series of virtual events that brought the business community together over drinks and food from home, replacing numerous networking events and parties in local restaurants, bars and temporary tents in the past during the Stampede. To keep the Stampede spirit going this summer, some crowd-drawing attractions were held with physical distancing in mind.\n\nTypically the 10-day event that starts in early July infuses $540-million into the local economy.\n\n•\n\nNational Independent Concessionaires Association (NICA) created a vendor-generated database of locations that can connect with people who are trying to find fair food in their local area. Sponsor Carnival Eats has interest in the one-off locations, trying to collect photos and descriptions of the dishes they are featuring. A strong group of submissions may lead to them producing a NICA-themed Carnival Eats Food Fights TV episode.\n\nSplashin’ Safari adds another jewel to its water coaster crown\n\nAT: Jeffrey Seifert\n\njseifert@amusementtoday.com\n\nSANTA CLAUS, Ind. — In July, Holiday World & Splashin’ Safari, the Southern Indiana theme park, debuted its third water coaster, giving it the rights to assume the title of “water coaster capital of the world.” Cheetah Chase, a unique racing, dueling water coaster, opened to the public on July 4.\n\nProvided by ProSlide of Ottawa, Canada, the attraction uses the company’s RocketBlast technology to power the rafts with jet streams of water. Cheetah Chase is a double slide that features both racing and dueling portions along its combined 1,700-foot course. The ride also combines ProSlide’s popular FlyingSaucer elements to produce high-speed turns with strong G-forces. The ride takes the ProSlide RocketBlast racing concept to another level by offering a complete circuit course starting with a launch right out of the station and adding a first-ever for a water coaster — a head-to-head dueling zone. The ride represents an investment of approximately $7 million.\n\nCheetah Chase travels at 30 feet per second and has the tallest RocketBlast section in the world, blasting riders to a height of 27 feet. In all, each side features five RocketBlast sections — one flat and four uphill sections — as well as two saucers, two side-by-side rally points and one head-to-head rally point.\n\nAs with all three Holiday World water coasters, thrill seekers queue at the base of the ride and board a raft in the station. Nothing needs to be hauled up a flight of stairs or an inclined walkway. The three-person boat conveniently rolls in on a moving conveyor for guests to quickly board. Riders are first weighed as a group to make certain they do not exceed the 480-pound limit. If a group of three is over the limit, one rider may wait on the sidelines until the raft returns, then exchange positions with one of two who just finished their ride — which person has to wait and who gets to ride twice is left up to the group to decide (rock, paper, scissors, perhaps?). Once riders are safely seated and checked, a pair of rafts, side-by-side, are rolled forward down a small incline and the fun starts immediately. The rafts are propelled by water jets along a flat section of chute, then blasted upward to one of the tallest points of the slide. From there the chutes diverge for an exciting saucer section, another uphill blast, then a 270-degree curve. That positions the riders for the head-to-head dueling zone where guests get to see their family or friends — or strangers — whizzing by in the opposite direction. Another blast takes riders into the second saucer section before plunging into a long tunnel, which brings the rafts back together side-by-side for one more drop and blast into the finish line.\n\n“The feedback for Cheetah Chase has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Leah Koch, director of communications and 4th generation owner. “I personally thought the most exciting part would be the flat, powered-launch section — since there’s nothing like it in the world. What we’re hearing is that the guests love being able to race their friends and family and the real thrill is hitting those ralley points throughout the track. Of course, the most important feedback we’re getting are the screams and laughter coming from the riders in the moment,” Koch told Amusement Today.\n\n“In a year like 2020, we’re just thrilled to be able to open Cheetah Chase, and to make families’ days just a little bit brighter. That’s what our industry stands for and that’s why we’ll be able to weather this storm. It’s what we do,” added Koch.\n\nCheetah Chase joins the highly-regarded Mammoth and Wildebeest water coasters — both recipients of the AT's Golden Ticket Award. Wildebeest and Mammoth have been voted the No. 1 and No. 2 water park attractions, respectively. Wildebeest has won the No. 1 spot for nine consecutive years and Mammoth has been certified by Guiness World Records as the world’s longest water coaster.\n\nSplashin’ Safari is included with admission to Holiday World. It opened in 1993 with just four attractions. At the turn of the millennium, the water park started adding many high-profile and cutting-edge attractions — most often new products from ProSlide. This latest addition brings the total number of attractions to 16, including two wave pools.\n\nTo aid in social distancing efforts, the three water coasters: Cheetah Chase, Wildebeest and Mammoth; along with Zinga (ProSlide Tornado), and Zoombabwe (ProSlide Mammoth), will operate on the park’s inLine reservation system. Using a combination of wristbands and phones, guests are able to wait in a virtual line and then check in at the entrance when it is time to ride. Guests will only be allowed to enter these lines by waiting virtually. Those not wanting to carry a phone with them can make a reservation at the ride entrance and will be given a time to return. However, should there be any changes or delays that time could be pushed back. Those using a phone will receive updates. Both wave pools, Bahari River, and any kids’ play areas will be accessible without use of the virtual line system.\n\nIn addition, the park will be changing hours and removing its Happy Halloween Weekends event for the 2020 season. However, two more weekends have been added to Splashin’ Safari operations.\n\n•holidayworld.com\n\nKountry Resort Campgrounds in Racine, Ohio, opened a new Aqua Park inflatable obstacle course on July 3. The course, provided by Aquaglide is set up on the campground's swimming lake. Three other lakes on the property are used for boating and fishing. Unlike most obstacle courses which charge for a timed session, the Aqua Park is open daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and guests may enjoy the course for as long as they like for a single $7 per person admission charge. The rate is reduced to $5 after 4 p.m.\n\nThe park has no age requirement, but guests must be at least 36 inches tall. Life jackets are available but not required.\n\nThe campground, located in Meigs County near the Ohio River and West Virginia border, dates back to the late 1800s. The current owners purchased the property five years ago. In addition to tent camping, the resort offers a variety of cabins and a large reception hall for events. Although the attractions at the park primarily serve guests staying at the resort, day visitors are permitted to use the Aqua Park.\n\n•\n\nCincinnati's Coney Island reopened more of its attractions in time for the Fourth of July weekend.\n\nThe park had already reopened the Sunlite Pool and Cannonball Cove on June 12.
