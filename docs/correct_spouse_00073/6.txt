Notes for MATILDA JANE KISNER:

Daily Review

May 1900

Mrs. Matilda J. Eberlin departed this life at her home at Norconk, Wilmot township, on Monday, May 14, 1900, Matilda Jane Eberlin, wife of the late Martin J. Eberlin, who passed over into the great beyond May 1, 1899. The deceased was aged 40 years, and was a victim of that dreaded disease consumption. She left three children, an aged father and several brothers and hosts of friends to mourn her death.

Interment took place in the St. John's Lutheran Cemetery, which was in sight of her home, on Thursday, May 17. The funeral was very largely attended. Her last remains were carried to her last resting place from her home by twelve pallbearers, where she was laid to rest by the side of her husband. She was a devoted and consistent member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Rev. John W. Klinger of Dushore, her pastor, officiated and delivered an able and touching sermon.

The deceased was born in Cherry township, Sullivan County, in 1860, and was a daughter of Hiram Kisner. She received the rite of holy baptism in her infancy by the Rev. C.L. Early, and was confirmed according to the rites of the Lutheran church in Cherry township, Sullivan County, in 1872, by the Rev. Henry B. Strodach, and was united in holy wedlock with Martin J. Eberlin in 1878, by the Rev. Lewis Smith. The deceased was one of those rare personalities who seem to diffuse about them a sort of love compelling atmosphere, which few can resist that come within the charming circle of its influence.

" None knew her but to love her.

None named her but to praise"

Although conscious of the approaching death, which was to sever the tenderest of human ties and deprive her children of fond mother's love and guidance, she was nevertheless enabled to meet death's merciless advance with marvelous fortitude and resignation, testifying to the last her abiding faith in God's infinite goodness and a Christian hope of a blissful immortality. The church of which she was an exemplary member and the social circle enlivened by her presence lose much by her untimely demise. To the bereaved family which now only consists of three children the loss is an irreparable one. To this tearful group around the desolate hearthstone of their once happy home, the sympathy of the entire community have gone forth with a depth and sincerity seldom ever witnessed.

The Glen Elder Sentinel

October 25, 1962

Mrs. Ida Addresta Coble "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith, so wrote the great apostle Paul during his last days on earth. These might well have been the last words of Ida Kisner Coble who passed way at the Beloit Community hospital Sunday evening, October 21, 1962 a the age of 92 years, 7 months, and 8 days.

Ida Addresta Coble wrote the following brief history of her life.

"I was born in Sullivan County, near Dushore, Pennsylvania, March 13, 1870. In November 1870 we came to Kansas settling on my fatherÂ’s homestead, north of Waconda Springs in Mitchell County.

My fatherÂ’s name was Jefferson Kisner. My mother's name was Emma Caroline Suver. I had one [brother?].

Died February 10, 1937. My mother died June 3, 1930. My brother died June 17, 1953.

On January 1, 1888 I was married to George W. Coble who passed away February 16, 1946. Two children where born to us. Edna Nada Coble Randall and a son who died in infancy. Edna passed away November 29, 1957.

In April 1888 George and I with his fatherÂ’s family went to Boise Idaho, where he helped his father in the horse business. After two years we retuned to Glen Elder and this has been the family home since.

Mrs. Coble was to be the last member of a sturdy Pennsylvania Dutch family. While yet an infant of 7 months she came to a new unsettled land and grew up with the earliest pioneer children of Mitchell County.

During the winter of 1870 the Kisner family, like other families, lived in the old fort southeast of Cawker City, until their own home could be built.

She often recalled seeing Indian pilgrimages to Waconda Springs to worship, often recalled hunting arrowheads and other Indian relics; but she never complained or recalled hard times or the discomforts of pioneer life. She was educated in Granita Creek School.

At an early age Mrs. Coble became a member of the Glen Elder Christias Church. For many years, she was a teacher of a young boys Sunday School Class. She has filled every office in the church with credit to the church and honor to herself. She was one of the earliest members of the Christian Ladies Aid Society and through the years was an ardent worker in that organization. She joined the Glen Elder Library Club in 1895, only 3 years after its organization and continued her membership & faithful service through the years, much of the time serving as Librarian. She was recorder of the Royal Neighbor Lodge for 30 years.

In 1905 Mr. and Mrs. Coble built a home, which she maintained until death, although failing health has caused her to live in homes for the aged, during the last few years.

She leaves to mourn her beloved son-in-law Mason Randall who has been as kind and attentive as any son could have been, a loyal and trusted friend Margaret Anderson, who seemed like a daughter to her than a friend, two nieces by marriage, Mrs. Elmer (Bessie) Rollins of Glen Elder and Mrs. Andy (Dora) Walker of Kansas City, Missouri, other distant relatives & a host of friends.

She who lived valiantly has passed, why should we grieve; why should it break out hearts like this if we believe?

Surely, she lives more valiantly than ever before,

Freed, as she is to move without the weights she bore,

Freed fro the sweet adventuring of Heavenly days.

Lightened to go exploring down Glory ways.

What must these first hours be to her who loved earth so?

She who lived valiantly has passed, why should we grieve?

Why should it break our hearts like this, -- if we believe?

Funeral Services were held in the Glen Elder Christias Church Wednesday, October 24, 1962 at 2:00 p.m. Rev. Bruce Smith officiating. Music was furnished by Mrs. Wayne Barnett organist and Mrs. Margaret Anderson and Wayne Barnett who sang, Â“Good Night and Good MorningÂ” and Â“Abide With MeÂ”/

The floral offering was cared for by Mrs. Max Eberle. Mrs. Bob Ramsbottom and Mrs. Kenneth Hicks.

Pallbearers were Roy Barnett, Harry Shoemaker, LaVerne Kresin, Ralph Hepperly, Frederick Kuhn and Harvey Pargett.

Elmira man took pride in his job as custodian at St. MaryÂ’s church, school

When summer vacation began Vincent F. TouschnerÂ’s work intensified. The custodian at St. MaryÂ’s Church and School on ElmiraÂ’s Southside from 1957 through the sixties and seventies, he always wanted the school to sparkle when September came.

As soon as the school year ended he threw himself into getting school ready for the next year. Remembers Margaret Ekes, a retired teacher at St. MaryÂ’s

Although itÂ’s been nearly 10 years since Touschner retired as custodian, people still remember his quest for perfection.

He was a fixture there for many years, Ekes said. Touschner of 762 Mount Zoar St. died Monday after years of fighting various illnesses, including leukemia. He was 79.

A funeral mass will be held at St. MaryÂ’s church at 10 a.m. Friday.

He was a terrific custodian, said Sharon Touschner, a daughter-in-law and also a teacher at St. MaryÂ’s. He kept us all in our places.

Mrs. Touschner said her father-in-law took such price in his work that he would strip down the desks and floors every vacation to refinish them.

Although he expected a certain amount of wear and tear during a school year, he had a low tolerance for damage caused by carelessness, she said.

I remember him as a person not just a custodian, Ekes added. Everyone called him Vince.

Vince had a special relationship with the children at St. MaryÂ’s. Since the teachers were all women, he enjoyed the status as the only male authority figure in the building.

The children like d to go down by his basement office and say hello, Ekes continued.

He was interested in what they were doing. He never gave the kids a hard time.

He saved his lectures on preserving the spic and span appearance of the school for the teachers, Ekes said.

After he retired, Mr. Touschner took the same kind of care in caring for his year.

His son, Francis and James said he continued to mow his lawn even this summer.

He took a great pride in keeping his yard shipshape,Â” Mrs. Touschner said. Â“he didnÂ’t believe in slackening off.

He was kind of serious most of the time,Â” said his son, Francis.

He was very religiousÂ” added James. It was a source of pleasure for him to work at the church.

He was the best custodian they ever had,Â” Francis said.

vii. A. VIVIAN DIEFFENBACH, born ca 1926, Pennsylvania.

134. ELIZABETH ANN LAWRENCE was born August 21, 1854 in PA, and died May 27, 1928. She married DANIEL WENNER PEALER February 16, 1875, son of ELIAS BEALER and SUSANNAH WEIMER. He was born February 21, 1851 in Fishing Creek, Columbia Co., PA, and died December 03, 1928.

ELIZABETH ANN LAWRENCE PEALER the daughter of John Horatio Lawrence, was born on a farm one mile east of Dusohre, Sullivan County. She was nineteen when her mother, Susannah Dieffenbacher Lawrence, died, leaving eleven children, the youngest of which was Frank, less than one year of age. A large part of the responsiblility of keeping the family together after the death of the mother was borne by the eldest child. However, she somehow found time to complete her education in the common schools and taught one winter. She married Daniel Wenner Pealer, February 16, 1875. They started their married life at Canton Corners, Bradford County, where their first child, Anna F., was born. It was move-move and more move for Elizabeth and her family, but finally they located at Lopez, Sullivan County in 1889 with a family of five small children. At that time Lopez was more of a lumber camp than a town. The houses were of plank frmae construction, cold as cold in the winter and extremely hot in the summer time.

The earnings from husband DanielÂ’s shoe and harness shop were meager. With little coming in and DanÂ’s liberality in helping others before he helped himself, often left a difficult problem for the manager of the household. Renting a room to a school teacher now and then and taking in an occasional boarder helped to make ends meet. In the early days of the lumber town, fresh vegetables, milk and eggs were real luxuries but seldom seen on the family table. Berries, watercress, dandelions, beechnuts, fish and wild game supplemented the dietary deficiencies we hear so much about today. In later years a house, with conveniences, was built that was thoroughly enjoyed. At the time of her death, May 27, 1928, she was a member of the United Evangelical Curch of Lopez. Elizabeth Ann and Daniel Wenner Pealer are buried in the Bahrs Cemetery near Dushore.
