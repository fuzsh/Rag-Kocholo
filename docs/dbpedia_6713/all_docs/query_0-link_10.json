This package has been approved by NABCEP for OSHA-10 training equivalency for NABCEP Certification purposes*.  “NABCEP is committed to helping renewable energy professionals receive the proper training to work safely and effectively within the industry,” said Shawn O’Brien, President & CEO of NABCEP. “To promote safety-related best practices in the field, NABCEP requires verification of safety training as part of the application process to become NABCEP Board Certified.  Although NABCEP has historically only accepted the OSHA 10-Hour for the Construction Industry course, we recently evaluated SEI’s safety training courses for their capacity to deliver training about PV-related workplace safety best practices. NABCEP determined that SEI’s training courses cover all of the topics and competencies required to work safely on PV systems, and we are happy to accept it as a substitute for the OSHA 10-Hour course, as a way for candidates to meet our safety training requirements.”",

These sessions are offered as on-demand recorded presentations to provide flexibility for the busy professional. If you have already completed one of the two on-demand portions of this OSHA-10 package, you can register and complete the second on-demand training to fulfill the NABCEP specific OSHA-10 requirement. Present both Records of Completion that you receive upon successful completion of the trainings to NABCEP to demonstrate your OSHA-10 requirement*.\n\nIncluded courses:\n\nCE523: RESIDENTIAL/COMMERCIAL ROOF-MOUNTED PV INSTALLATION SAFETY\n\nNABCEP CE Hours: 12 hours (click for details). This 12-hr. on-demand course covers key safety topics associated with residential and commercial roof-mounted PV installations- including ladder and lift safety, fall protection, safe rooftop working practices, and solar electrical safety. Learn steps to identify and control installation hazards, making workers both safer and more efficient on the job site.\n\nCE525: LARGE-SCALE GROUND-MOUNTED PV INSTALLATION SAFETY\n\nNABCEP CE Hours: 8 hours (click for details). Large ground-mounted PV installations present unique hazards requiring specialized safety training, including DC circuits operating at up to 1500 volts and thousands of amps, AC circuits up to 690 volts, and hazards associated with trenching and the use of heavy machinery. This 8-hr online on-demand course covers site hazards and control methods specific to large ground-mounted PV installations.\n\n*Note- the PVCM certification requires completion of an OSHA-30 course. This training package does not qualify as an OSHA-30 equivalent for NABCEP certification."
