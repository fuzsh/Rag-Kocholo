They are not just any workers; they are the pioneers at the forefront of a revolution, harnessing the sun’s boundless energy to power our world. But as the sun climbs higher, casting light on their faces, a glaring truth becomes evident: there are not enough of them. This scarcity of labor available for solar industry jobs has become evident in all areas of solar energy production, from solar installations to maintenance. But also in the underutilization of solar software solutions for field service management.\n\nThe road to fixing the solar industry’s skilled labor crisis is one of those problematic, meandering, yet inviting opportunities for innovation, collaboration, and strategic planning. Perhaps if we consider a whole approach to workforce development, like the sun’s infinite energy supply, we can develop a sustainable solution to the current labor shortage and its challenging bottleneck.\n\nThis article will introduce and take you through some of those challenges, while identifying insights and strategies with which a flexible and skilled workforce can continue to propel this industry toward an ever-brighter, greener future.This article is not written in the style of some academic exercise but rather in the spirit of a call to action for stakeholders across the spectrum: from policymakers to developers of solar business management software, and educational institutions for the workforce. Such understanding when dealing with this deficit becomes central not only to the growth of the industry but to our common quest for a more sustainable and energy-independent future.\n\nUnderstanding the Skilled Labor Shortage\n\nDefining ‘Skilled Labor Shortage’ in the Solar Industry\n\nThe phrase “skilled labor shortage” regarding the solar industry underscores a disparity in the supply and demand of professionals, trained and qualified, for the job in the sector.\n\nThis gap is not only in numbers but extends to necessary skills and expertise in carrying out the various capacities within the industry. From instructors in solar installation training to experienced solar project managers, the gaps are many.\n\nThe shortage is multifaceted: not only is there understaffing, but also an inadequacy in significant skills and training that need to be handled effectively with the growing demands of the solar industry.\n\nCurrent Statistics and Trends\n\nSolar has an exponential trend, driven by technology and environmental consciousness growing at a fast pace. It has created a kind of demand for skilled labor in the industry never seen before.\n\nBased on data from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), solar industry employment has shown growth over the past decade. Even with the growth, it is further accelerating beyond the capacity of trained professionals.\n\nSolar energy-related positions, such as solar panel installers, electricians specializing in solar power systems, and professionals in the domain of solar business software and solar asset management software, are some of the roles in demand.\n\nThis shortage has a rippling effect which shows up in late project timelines, cost overruns, and overstretching of the current workers. This is also a major challenge facing the future scalability and efficiency of the solar industry and needs to be addressed.\n\nSource: SEIA/Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables U.S. Solar Market Insight 2023 Year in Review\n\nCauses of Labor Shortage in the Solar Industry\n\nRapid Growth of the Solar Industry and Unmet Demand for Skilled Workers\n\nThe growth of the solar industry has been meteoric, driven by technological advancement and a worldwide shift toward renewable power production. This rapid expansion has created a vital need for skilled professionals far above the current rate of workers available to fill the demand.\n\nAnd there are benefits for companies facing the current labor shortage crisis. The major solar tax credit for businesses located in the United States is the Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC). It allows the business to take a percentage off their federal taxes, which normally ranges from 30% of what their total installation cost is for the solar energy system. This credit was further expanded and increased by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Additional benefits could be available by using U.S.-manufactured products and for projects in energy-designated communities or tribal lands.\n\nIn Canada, solar energy installations may be eligible for benefits under various federal and provincial incentives in addition to the federal ecoENERGY program. Most benefits are in the grant or rebate form. While Canada and the U.S. had also agreed on a broad deal that would see the costs for Canadian solar projects fall, following the removal of recently reinstituted U.S. safeguard tariffs on Canadian solar products.\n\nChallenges in Solar Recruitment\n\nThe process of solar recruitment faces a unique set of challenges.

Accordingly, governments could ease visa requirements for solar professionals with skills to enable the international mobility of the workforce.\n\nCommunity Engagement and Public Awareness\n\nImportance of Raising Awareness about Careers in Solar Industry Jobs\n\nAwareness of the array of professions and rewarding solar industry jobs must be established. Social initiatives under community outreach programs could include the organization of information evenings, workshops, or open days in solar companies to demystify the industry and build interest among potential job seekers.\n\nCommunity Programs and Outreach\n\nThis is possible by tapping the community to launch educational programs and outreach activities and includes collaborations with schools, colleges, and community groups that bring youth in contact with solar energy concepts and opportunities for solar careers.\n\nPublic-Private Partnerships for Workforce Development\n\nPublic-private partnerships could become the building blocks of workforce development tailored to the solar industry. Jointly, businesses, educational institutions, and the government could create these training programs meant to fill those specific skill gaps to prepare individuals to take their place in the industry.\n\nStrategy Development – Industry Collaboration and Standardization:\n\nForms industry associations to share best practices, training materials, and workforce development strategies.\n\nCreates a unified platform for industry-wide job openings, showcasing varied opportunities across companies.\n\nStandardizes job roles and qualifications across the industry to streamline recruitment and training processes.\n\nImplementation Tactics:\n\nHolding annual industry conferences focused on workforce development and training innovations.\n\nDeveloping a shared digital library of training resources, accessible to all industry partners.\n\nImplementing an industry-wide mentorship program to foster skill development and professional growth among new entrants.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\nCreates a cohesive and supportive solar industry community, fostering a culture of knowledge sharing and innovation.\n\nReduces onboarding time and costs due to standardized roles and qualifications, enhancing operational efficiency.\n\nIncreases attractiveness of the solar industry as a career option due to clear pathways for advancement and industry support.\n\nCase Studies: Successful Approaches to Combating Labor Shortages\n\nCase Study 1: Innovative Training Programs\n\nCompanies from the United States started an enthusiastic training program for newly recruited employees and gave them theoretical knowledge and practical experience.\n\nThe great thing about this initiative is that the recruited employee is not only prepared for his immediate job responsibilities but further knowledge within the industry making them versatile and valuable workers in the company.\n\nCase Study 2: Strategic Partnerships for Talent Sourcing\n\nOne European solar firm partnered with local technical colleges to build a pipeline for qualified workers. At least one such partnership involved the college working with the firm on curriculum development, specifically for the needs of the solar industry, and provided students with practical experiences and a clear way into jobs post-graduation.\n\nCase Study 3: Technology Integration for Operational Efficiency\n\nA solar company in Asia leveraged advanced solar software solutions to streamline its operations. Such systems in adoption are solar business management software and field service software for the solar energy industry, which allows firms to optimize their workforce needs, reduce the number of on-ground staff, and downscale the effects of labor shortage.\n\nThe Role of Praxedo in this Situation\n\nPraxedo’s best-in-class Field Service Management software provides a powerful helping hand to the solar industry, which is facing the challenge of qualified labor shortages.\n\nEquipped with powerful and intuitive features, Praxedo can support the operation, increase productivity, and eventually save businesses from workforce limitations.
