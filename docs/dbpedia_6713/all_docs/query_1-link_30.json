        "text": "San Diego State University (SDSU) MESA program’s 4th Annual Solar Turbines Training Academy took place at Solar Turbines’ Harbor Drive location in San Diego, California, on Friday, October 16, 2015, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.\n\nStudents were able to experience a wide array of activities during their visit to the Solar Turbines plant. The staff conducted tours of different sections of their company and explained the overview of what actual engineers do on a daily basis. With all of the observed material and different processes relating to projects shown to students, they were then asked to give mini presentations pertaining to what they had learned to the Solar Turbines staff near the end of their visit. Not only were students able to have a sneak preview of what they may possibly be doing in their futures, they also participated in mock interviews and networking with the staff. A total of 12 SDSU MESA students attended the Training Academy.\n\nThe San Diego MESA Alliance would like to thank Solar Turbines (especially the efforts of Samantha Caldwell for supervising this entire trip, along with her respective colleagues) for allowing the students to experience engineering in practical terms and for providing ample instances of opportunities for them to take advantage of.\n\nAbout Solar Turbines:\n\nSolar Turbines Incorporated, headquartered in San Diego, California, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc. Solar manufactures the world’s most widely used family of mid-sized industrial gas turbines. More than 12,000 Solar units are operating in 93 countries around the world.
