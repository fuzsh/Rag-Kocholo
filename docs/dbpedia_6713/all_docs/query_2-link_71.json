        "text": "Where the Sun Shines\n\nIn a city that enjoys 361 days of sunshine each year, solar energy makes sense. The City is committed to the increased usage and production of solar energy, both for municipal operations and the community, in order to help promote a clean, sustainable energy source, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel dependency, and improve community resilience.\n\nSolar and Energy Loan Fund\n\nThe Solar and Energy Loan Fund (SELF) is a nonprofit organization that provides loans, project management, and a list of approved contractors for home improvement projects to improve energy efficiency, water conservation, and storm preparedness in residential homes. Low-interest loans are available for all Florida homeowner applicants.\n\nSELF focuses on empowering women, veterans, and low- and moderate-income homeowners who may have had trouble getting loans from other sources. Loan applicants will work with SELF staff to choose the project that will have the most impact on lowering utility bills or improving quality of life.\n\nSELF loans can:\n\nReduce the cost of electricity and water bills\n\nHelp residents prepare for storms and harsh Florida weather\n\nImprove residential homes and resident quality of life\n\nStimulate the local economy with sustainable, green-geared jobs\n\nEmpower minority-, veteran-, and women-owned businesses in the St. Pete area\n\nImprove credit worth and future financial stability for applicants\n\nSolar Co-Ops\n\nSolar United Neighbors (SUN) is a nonprofit that expands access to rooftop solar by educating St. Pete residents about solar power, organizing group solar installations known as solar co-ops, and helping residents go solar on their own. SUN provides unbiased, installer-neutral support through each stage of the process of going solar. Their experienced team ensures residents understand how solar works, how it can be financed, and how it can be installed on a private home or business.\n\nCo-ops take advantage of a groupâ€™s bulk-purchasing power to get discounted pricing and a quality installation. Co-op members choose an installer on behalf of the entire group through an open and competitive bidding process. The selected installer provides everyone in the group with a personalized proposal for their consideration.\n\nSUN's Go Solar services are available year-round. Experts at SUN's solar Help Desk give members one-on-one assistance every step of the way and members are able to personalize their schedules for installation and other milestones.\n\nSolar United Neighbors' resources are available at no cost or obligation.\n\nSign Up\n\nThere is no cost or obligation when signing up for the co-op.\n\nJoin or View More Info"
