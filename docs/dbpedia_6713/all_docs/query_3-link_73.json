        "text": "Solar price plans\n\nYou can offset your electric costs by generating some of your own power using solar panels, but you’ll also use power from SRP’s grid when you need more energy than your panels generate. Explore our price plans to find the best fit for your lifestyle.\n\nCompare price plans\n\nYes. On the Customer Generation and Average Demand price plans, if the energy produced by your solar system is greater than the energy you used during the billing cycle, then the excess energy will be credited to your bill. You'll get back the same value you would have paid for that energy had you purchased it from SRP. On the TOU Export and EV Export price plans, if the energy produced by your solar system is fed back to the grid at any time, SRP will credit you at a fixed export rate of $0.0281 per kWh and subtract it from your bill.\n\nOn the TOU Export and EV Export price plans, excess solar generation cannot be carried over. On the Customer Generation and Average Demand price plans, excess generation can be \"banked\" during the billing month. Any unused excess energy will be credited at the end of the billing cycle at the retail rate.\n\nSolar customers pay a slightly higher monthly service charge than non-solar customers. Customers with systems of 200 amps or under pay a monthly service fee of $32.44, and customers with systems over 200 amps are charged a monthly service fee of $45.44. This helps SRP recover fixed costs to support grid capacity. If you’re on a demand price plan, you’ll also pay a demand charge.\n\nYes, through the SRP Solar Choice™ program, customers who don’t have solar panels can offset their energy use with power from Arizona solar farms. This plan costs just half a cent more per kWh on top of your current price plan.\n\nYou can earn money by offsetting your electric bill, using only the energy generated from your system or generating excess energy that will be credited to your bill at a fixed rate of 2.81 cents per kWh.\n\nSRP does not sell or install solar or DER system components, but we do have a list of trusted local providers through our Preferred Solar Installer program. If a company claims to partner with SRP, call (602) 889-2657 to make sure they’re on our approved list. We’re available from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven days a week. You can also email us at srpinfo@elaz.org. We also suggest checking out our smart solar shopping tips page to make sure you’re aware of common misinformation and red flags when shopping for solar.\n\nA variety of state and federal incentives are available to help Arizonans invest in solar technologies. The current federal residential solar energy credit offers:\n\n30% tax credit for systems installed between 2022 and 2032\n\n26% tax credit for systems installed in 2033\n\n22% for systems installed in 2034 (Energy.gov)\n\nFor other rebates, search the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency®. To see if you qualify for these credits, consult a tax professional."
