        "text": "Program Overview\n\nThrough the Clean Energy Program, DCAS works to expand distributed energy resources, including solar PV and energy storage installations across the City's portfolio of properties. The City has established a goal of installing 100 Megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaic (PV) on City-owned buildings by the end of 2025. In 2022, DCAS assessed all City-owned buildings larger than 10,000 gross square feet for solar readiness and identified nearly 17 MW of rooftop solar potential. As of 2024, the Clean Energy Program has over 50 MW of solar PV projects in progress, and 24.1 MW of completed installations. These installations encompass traditional rooftop solar and standalone solar and storage projects to more innovative applications including solar canopies at parking lots, garages and wastewater treatment plants, as well as combined solar plus storage projects.\n\nDCAS also incorporates educational and workforce development opportunities into its clean energy efforts. DCAS funds the NYC Solar Schools Education Program, a solar training for teachers in public schools in partnership with the not-for-profit organization Solar One and offers solar training for City employees with a focus on operations and maintenance.\n\nWatch The City of New York: Bringing Solar Power to Government Buildings video\n\nRelevant Local Laws\n\nLocal Law 24\n\nIn 2016, the City passed LL24 to enhance public awareness of the City’s efforts to install 100 MW of solar by 2025. Under LL24, DCAS is required to assess the solar PV potential of all City-owned buildings over 10,000 gross square feet once every two years. Special focus is given to identifying and quantifying potential capacity at solar-ready buildings, which are defined as buildings that have roofs that are no more than 10 years old and in fair or good condition.\n\nRead the latest LL24 report\n\nView previous LL24 reports\n\nLocal Law 92 and Local Law 94\n\nIn April 2019, the New York City Council passed Local Law 92 (LL92) and Local Law 94 (LL94). These laws require all buildings undergoing roof decking replacement and any newly constructed buildings to have a sustainable roofing zone — a solar PV system, a green roof, or a combination of both. DCAS is available to help agency partners navigate these new laws.\n\nSolar Progress\n\nAs of 2024, DCAS has installed 24.1 MW of solar PV panels across 155 facilities, fulfilling 24% of the City's goal to install 100 MW of solar by the end of 2025. Between 2021 to the end of 2023, DCAS has more than doubled the megawatt capacity of PV installed on City property from 11 MW to over 24 MW.\n\nSee the list of solar installations on New York City public buildings (March 2024)\n\nHow to Participate\n\nDCAS selects City buildings for solar installations in close coordination with our agency partners. In general, we prioritize City buildings that are 10,000 gross square feet or larger, have roofs no more than 10 years old, and roofs that are in a state of good repair. Working closely with our agency energy partners, we identify facilities across our entire portfolio based on these criteria and install solar PV projects with the procurement mechanisms available to DCAS.\n\nCurrent Project Locator\n\nThe following map shows the locations of current solar installations.
