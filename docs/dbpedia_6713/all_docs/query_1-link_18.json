If you aren't familiar with electricity at all learn safety first.\n\nDon't buy any equipment for at least 6 months until you have an idea of a good plan of what you want to do. You can waste a lot of money floundering around figuring stuff out as you go along.\n\nNever cut corners on safety, and any time you think about going cheap on a breaker or fuse read another thread in 'up in smoke'\n\nMy signature line has a link with lots of good info in it. Typically questions I've answered a few times or more are the subjects."
