        "text": "Introduction to Solar Photovoltaics\n\nThis online course teaches the basics of solar electricity. Participants will learn how photovoltaic (PV) systems work, compare and contrast different PV system types, identify necessary components and understand the best applications for (and limitations of) each system type. Other topics include evaluating the solar window, investigating energy efficiency recommendations and researching system costs.\n\nInstructor: Michelle Knox.\n\nCost: $135\n\nCall 217-786-2292 to register.\n\nFall 2024\n\nOpen-ended start beginning Aug. 19, 2024. Course must be completed by Dec. 13, 2024.\n\nCourse Code WST 034-001 FL 24\n\nSpring 2025\n\nOpen-ended start beginning Jan. 13, 2025 Course must be completed by May 16, 2025.\n\nCourse Code WST 034-001 SP 25\n\nThis online course offers exercises and activities to demonstrate how to perform a PV site assessment for a home or small business using the PV Site Assessment Report Template.\n\nTopics covered include load profiles and consumption history, energy efficiency and fuel switching opportunities, site-specific shade analysis, array and balance of system location recommendations parameters, and client financing options. Participants will learn how to access and use online tools for assessing the solar resource, perform site-specific PV system sizing, determine energy production of a recommended PV system size, estimate system cost and evaluate existing infrastructure on the site.\n\nInstructor: Michelle Knox.\n\nPrerequisite\n\nIntroduction to Solar Photovoltaics or instructor permission.\n\nCost: $195\n\nCall 217-786-2292 to register.\n\nFall 2024\n\nOpen-ended start beginning Aug. 19, 2024.
