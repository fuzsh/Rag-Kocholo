As the industry evolves, it’s important for installers and technicians to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices. In this blog post, we’ll explore the advantages of solar installation training and certification for solar installers and technicians.\n\nCertification and training can increase your job opportunities and make you more competitive in the job market. Many employers prefer to hire installers and technicians who have completed training programs and hold certifications. This demonstrates their knowledge and commitment to the industry.\n\nSafety is a top priority in the solar industry, as installers and technicians are often working at heights and handling electrical components. Training and certification programs emphasize safety best practices. They provide installers and technicians with the knowledge and skills necessary to perform their work safely.\n\nGridworks Solar Energy Training Centre’s instructors have 35 years of combined solar industry experience in design, construction, procurement and commissioning of grid-connected and off grid systems.

He has personally trained over 1800 Electricians in Alberta alone. Graduates have added solar PV installation as a service or started their own contracting business, achieving great success!\n\nOverall, investing in solar training and certification is a smart choice for anyone looking to start or advance their career in the solar industry. At Gridworks Energy, we are proud to be a leader in solar education and look forward to helping our students achieve their goals and make a positive impact on the world"
