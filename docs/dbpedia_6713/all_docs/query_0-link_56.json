        "text": "In addition to using solar in our generation mix, we have a team dedicated to researching new and more efficient ways to tap into this clean energy source. We built the first Smart Neighborhood in Alabama, which utilizes solar energy through a community-scale power system, or microgrid, built to generate energy for the neighborhood. The microgrid can generate over 600,000 kWh of energy annually. It includes solar panels, battery storage and a backup generator. Homes receive energy from both the microgrid and the existing electric grid.\n\nThere are some challenges around storage of renewable energy sources like solar. So, we are also looking at ways to advance the use and technology of batteries paired with solar, which will assist in making solar more reliable in providing power to our customers. The use of batteries helps store the sun’s energy, so we can tap into it when the sun goes does at night and on cloudy days.\n\nWe also work with businesses looking to support clean energy projects, like building solar plants in Alabama. Solar plants are large-scale installations of solar panels mounted on the ground, designed to capture a maximum amount of energy when the sun is shining. Today, an estimated average of seven acres of land is needed to generate one megawatt of power using solar energy.\n\nWe currently have five solar plants online or in development, with two more recently approved. To find out more about operating solar plants in our service territory, visit our plants page. Businesses can choose to support these projects or the development of new ones, helping them meet their clean energy goals. And, if you’re not ready to subscribe to a project, we also offer other programs to help your business meet its clean energy goals.\n\nClean Energy Solutions for Businesses"
