        "text": "The swift answer to whether or not solar power is worth investing in is yes. Solar power is the best, most innovative way to help the environment, and itâ€™s a write-off on taxes. If you are still uncertain about solar power, look at the list of five industries that would benefit the most from solar power, including yours.\n\nPharmacy Labs\n\nMany companies are looking to invest in environmentally-friendly technologies, so it makes sense for pharmacy labs to do the same. Since so many medications need to be in cooler settings, pharmaceutical companies are interested in solar energy. It can improve a businessâ€™s financial, social, and environmental control.\n\nVaccines and chemotherapy drugs need stable environments to stay fresh and extend longevity. Fortunately, solar energy is available all the time. A solar system keeps cold units running longer, thus making the journey from the manufacturer to a clinic easier.\n\nHotels\n\nStill unconvinced? Letâ€™s look at a different industry, like hospitality. From hotels on cruise ships to resorts on land, these places house guests 24/7. Thatâ€™s an astronomically high electric bill we donâ€™t even want to look at!\n\nA hotelâ€™s electric bill is so high because of constant use by guests and staff. The constant need for electricity uses energy, which could be consumed in more eco-friendly ways.\n\nHotels are doing better by adopting solar power to use for electricity. More consumers have turned back to these places because of the decision to go green. This massive switch to clean energy likely inspires other hospitality businesses (i.e., restaurants and theaters) to embrace solar power.\n\nCar Manufacturers\n\nThe end of this blog is near, and if you are still skeptical, continue reading to learn what car manufacturers could get out of solar power. Car manufacturing plants like Tesla have begun blending solar panels into their designs.\n\nMany vehicle factories have done similar things. Since these panels have been adapted to automotive designs, vehicles like hybrids and the Tesla Cybertruck have developed automatic solar panels fanning out like wings; these elevated panels absorb sunlight once a day when the cars drive a maximum of forty miles.\n\nFarms\n\nFarms are the poster child for solar power. The farming industry would benefit the most from solar power because it relies on heavy machinery every day to harvest essential crops and feed communities. Agriculture specialists have noticed an uptick in benefits, such as tax incentives, to cover installation costs and keep their animals in comfortable environments.\n\nLaundromats\n\nLaundromats run electricity constantly. Adopting solar power has given laundromat owners a chance to install a solar thermal system to waste less energy and decrease utility costs to avoid raising fees on customers."
