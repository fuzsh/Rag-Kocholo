Building a robust workforce can only be achieved through the active involvement of solar companies that want to work with community-based organizations, training providers, educational institutions, and other workforce organizations.\n\nSource: SEIA 30 by 30 Issue Brief | September 2021\n\nSEIA’s member companies will need a pipeline of trained workers across the spectrum of roles from project managers to engineers, salespeople, technicians, installers, system designers, operations managers, executives, and a variety of business professionals. Roles involving solar installation and installation of related technologies including battery storage, field service maintenance, electrical work, and often sales roles to name a few, are some of the fastest growing roles in the industry, and they do not typically require a college degree.\n\nTo create a pipeline of diverse, trained workers, SEIA and our partners must work to meet the industry’s short-term, medium-term, and long-term needs.\n\nShort-term Needs: Address immediate recruiting, training, apprenticeship, and career development needs, with a focus on reaching diverse, underserved communities and expanding the size of the workforce. Highlights of SEIA’s work in this space to date include these resources for employers:\n\nRecruiting, Hiring, and Retaining Military Veterans for Solar Careers – Use this linked resource for tips for attracting and retaining the highly sought-after military talent pool. Employers can also visit this Solar Ready Vets Network site for general information and tips.\n\nGetting Started with Apprenticeships: Resources for Solar Employers – Explore apprenticeship options for creating an in-house apprenticeship program at your company, participating in a union-based apprenticeship program, or participating in a non-union based group apprenticeship program.\n\nMedium-Term Needs: Attract future potential employees to solar by introducing solar concepts, hands-on construction experiences, and career pathway opportunities at high schools, vocational/trade schools, and community colleges.\n\nSEIA is actively participating in discussions with union organizations, community-based organizations, the Department of Energy, educational and training providers, Interstate Renewable Energy Council, and other partners about the best way to address these needs\n\nLong-Term Needs: Bring awareness of solar energy as a mainstream electricity source and an attractive industry for career consideration to elementary and middle school students. By 2030 – 2035, these students will be the newest solar industry workforce entrants.\n\nSEIA engages with its members and partners in various ways to gather the data and input needed to communicate industry successes, challenges, and needs around workforce development. These efforts include but are not limited to the following:\n\nSolar Jobs Census and Diversity Studies in partnership with IREC\n\nWorkforce Development content at RE+ and SEIA national, regional, and virtual events\n\nForming a Workforce Development Committee of SEIA members who are experts in workforce development (Coming soon!)\n\nAt SEIA, we believe that a diverse workforce creates a more resilient organization - one that supports a strong, equitable solar industry. Learn more on our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice page about the efforts we’re making to support our members with this work.\n\nLooking for Additional Workforce Related Resources? Here are some external resources that may be useful for you."
