        "text": "MassCEC is working to equitably bring the benefits of clean energy jobs to our Commonwealth’s diverse populations. Our Workforce Equity programs are guided by our Workforce Development Board of Directors and informed by our Workforce Development Equity Working Group. The Working Group offers informal recommendations, including ways to align MassCEC's workforce programming with the long-term goals of the Massachusetts Clean Energy Climate Plan (CECP) and the equity objectives in the 2021 Act Creating A Next-Generation Roadmap for Climate Policy. The Working Group includes clean energy workforce community and industry stakeholders who offer a broad range of relevant experiences and expertise from the public, private, and non-profit sectors across Massachusetts.\n\nThousands of jobs are being filled in offshore wind construction, operation, and maintenance\n\nThe 2018 Massachusetts Offshore Wind Workforce Assessment estimates that 1,600 MW of offshore wind development will provide 6,800 to 9,800 total job-years of employment (a job-year is one full-time job for one year) during construction and installation. Even more development has been planned since then:\n\nThe Vineyard Wind 1 project is kicking off deployment of its 800 megawatt (MW) offshore wind project in early 2023.\n\nAn additional 2,400 MW is under contract with Massachusetts utilities for the SouthCoast Wind and Commonwealth Wind projects\n\nThe search is well underway for local workers who will be trained to operate boats, weld, do electrical work, provide port services, move materials, and manage projects. Opportunities are also plentiful for workers who already possess these skills and want to apply them in a high-growth industry.\n\nThe American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) forecasts that 45,000 – 83,000 jobs will be created to support the planned buildout of 20-30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind in the U.S. by 2030.\n\nTradespeople are in demand to meet building efficiency and decarbonization goals by 2030 and beyond\n\nMassachusetts needs to retrofit over 2 million homes, commercial buildings, and institutional buildings to reduce energy consumption and switch to clean, electrified heating systems. This long-term undertaking is employing all kinds of tradespeople, insulation specialists, and efficiency experts, as well as engineers, architects, and even software professionals. The demand for traditional trades -- such as electrical, HVAC, plumbing, and construction -- is rising just as many highly valued workers are retiring. The opportunities for new workers are enormous, as are the opportunities to learn special skills associated with advanced, high-tech construction, retrofit, and maintenance techniques."
