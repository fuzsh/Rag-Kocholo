He started Sphere Solar Energy in order to give back to these communities. And he is committed to elevating their voices so that they are not only passive beneficiaries of the clean energy revolution, but also key contributors to its growth.\n\nSphere Solar Energy has executed four international projects since 2015.\n\nGoing forward, we will divide our resources between local projects and international projects that empower marginalized communities. All charitable work will be managed by Sphere One.\n\nJoin the Movement\n\nOur mission is to make clean energy systems more accessible throughout the Northwest and in developing communities abroad so that a greater number of individuals can power their homes and their lives in a way that does not harm the environment and future generations."
