        "text": "Solar Panel Installations on Campus\n\nAs the U.S. seeks to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, solar installations are an increasingly popular and renewable energy source. Considered one of the cleanest and greenest sources of electricity, solar represented approximately 46% of new U.S. electric generation capacity in 2022.1\n\nMore higher education institutions are considering photovoltaic (PV) solar panel installations, as costs for this energy-efficient solution have dropped significantly over the last decade2 and federal incentives, like those in the Inflation Reduction Act, are driving up solar usage.3 University and college campuses can extract value from rooftops, parking garages, parking lots or other spaces by retrofitting PV panels, installing stand-alone solar arrays or incorporating them into new builds. Not only can this source of energy help reduce carbon emissions, but it can also serve as an educational model for students interested in learning about sustainable clean energy practices.\n\nStill, solar energy is not without its challenges. Solar panels can be affected by ever-changing environmental conditions, such as high winds, heavy rain, snow and hail. When energized, these complex systems can present risks particularly without proper installation and regular maintenance by knowledgeable professionals.\n\nAs higher education institutions turn their focus toward furthering sustainability and choose solar energy, it’s important to understand and manage the risks as well as the rewards of this viable renewable energy solution.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) reports that 351 institutions across the globe currently receive a valid rating for using renewables on campus.4\n\nSolar Photovoltaic (PV) Panels vs. Solar Thermal Systems\n\nDepending on energy needs and specific applications, universities and colleges can utilize both solar panels and solar thermal systems or choose between the two. Solar PV and solar thermal both harness energy from the sun but for different purposes. Photovoltaic systems convert sunlight directly into electricity and are commonly used to generate renewable electricity that can power buildings, lighting systems and various electrical devices.\n\nPhotovoltaic panels are made of small cells of semiconductors that are connected to one another and encased in protective materials made of glass or plastics. These panels are joined together to form an array that is then connected to the electrical grid. The cells convert sunlight (photons) into direct current (DC) electricity.5Inverters change this into alternating current (AC) and distribute it throughout the electrical grid.6\n\nThermal solar typically uses solar collectors to absorb sunlight and transfer the heat to a fluid that can then be used for hot water needs like heating swimming pools or supporting HVAC systems.7\n\nAs the popularity of electric cars grows, university leaders might consider installing car charging stations on campus. Microgrids, a smaller PV array operating independently or in concert with the larger energy grid, can power these EV chargers without adding expense and strain on current energy sources. Chargers on a microgrid can service vehicles when other power sources go dark, can incorporate battery systems that store energy for later use, or can be sold back to the public grid.8\n\nThe Advantages of Going Solar\n\nSolar Leads to Energy Cost Savings\n\nAccording to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the higher education sector is at the forefront of renewable energy commitments, as it spends more than $6 billion annually on energy costs.9 Between the affordability of PV, government rebates and fluctuating energy costs across the country, switching to a reliance on solar can lead not only to savings in energy spending but better forecasting and budget planning.\n\nColleges and universities looking for affordable solar projects may want to consider Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) to bring solar options to campus with less upfront investment.\n\nPPAs pair educational institutions with private investors who seek to install, own and maintain solar while providing lower power rates for the school. Already, PPAs have enabled more than 100 megawatts (MW) of solar deployment on campuses around the country.10\n\nAlternative Energy Can Offer More Control\n\nAdding PV solar energy capacity helps reduce dependence on the common energy grid by generating power that is used before other sources.11 Access to an alternative energy source may reduce interruptions in service when the local energy grid malfunctions. It also gives colleges the potential to remain powered during localized outages or when natural disasters knock out grid service.\n\nA small Connecticut college recently celebrated the construction of a 770-kilowatt carport photovoltaic solar power system located in parking lots throughout the campus. The initiative is expected to offset approximately 30% of the school’s annual electricity consumption.12\n\nPV Shows Students a Commitment to Sustainability\n\nToday’s college students tend to be environmentally conscious and factor sustainability and environmental practices into their decision-making. Energy produced from solar PV technology does not produce carbon or other harmful greenhouse gases when operating,13 and campus solar installations can be positive and visible indicators of a school’s commitment to climate concerns for students, prospective and current."
