        "text": "Become part of the growing Florida solar energy workforce\n\nThe Florida Solar Energy Apprenticeship Program aims to ensure that Florida continues to produce well-trained, highly-qualified solar energy technicians. This apprenticeship provides a pathway to state certification as a Florida solar contractor, which allows installation of both solar electric (photovoltaics) and thermal systems (water heating and pool heating).\n\nSolar installer jobs are one of the fastest growing occupations in the clean energy sector, expected to increase more than 50% by 2030.\n\nThe Florida Solar Energy Apprenticeship Program was the first and only solar apprenticeship in the country to be registered with the U.S. Department of Labor. It was approved by the Florida Department of Education, the state’s apprenticeship agency, in February 2022.\n\n“The solar apprenticeship program adds credibility to our apprentice’s future and gives contractors in the state a higher level of confidence that when hiring one of our apprentices that they are getting a well-rounded and competent individual, someone who will become an asset for their company.”\n\nDavid Bessette, solar apprenticeship committee IMMEDIATE PAST chair and president of Energy Technology Services\n\nABOUT US\n\nThe Florida Solar Energy Apprenticeship Committee is a Solar Energy Technician apprenticeship provider registered with the Florida Department of Education, Apprenticeship Office. The Florida Solar Energy Industries Association (FlaSEIA) partnered with the Florida Solar Energy Center® (FSEC®) to develop the Florida Solar Energy Apprenticeship Program.\n\nThe Florida Solar Energy Apprenticeship Committee is comprised of the “Participating Employers” that have joined the program, and agree to abide by the Apprenticeship Standards. This includes membership in the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association (FlaSEIA), payment of prevailing wages to apprentices, and access to on-the-job training and related technical instruction. Solar companies interested in becoming a Participating Employer should contact Colleen Kettles.\n\nApprenticeship Committee\n\nThe Apprenticeship Committee is supported by FSEC faculty and staff in the administration of the program, and is responsible for development and delivery of the related technical instruction."
