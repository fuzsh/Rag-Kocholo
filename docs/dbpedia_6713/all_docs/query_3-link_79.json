Currently, solar energy can be harnessed by installing solar panels on residential roofs, offering an alternative to solar farms.\n\nThese communities generate local and sustainable electricity in urban centers, with solar panels installed on the roofs in the area. The highlight of this solution is that it allows homes within a radius of 2,000 meters to connect and enjoy 100%-renewable electricity, without the need to install anything in their own homes or make any additional investments.\n\nJoin this initiative and be a part of your community's solar revolution."
