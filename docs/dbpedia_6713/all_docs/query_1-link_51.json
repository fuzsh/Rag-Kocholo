        "text": "Switch on the sun!\n\nPlug into your new career in solar energy with the Solar Energy Technician Apprenticeship program at St. Petersburg College! This two-year apprenticeship costs you nothing and leads to certifications that will make you an expert in the field of solar photovoltaic installation and maintenance.\n\nThe program, made possible by a partnership between SPC and the University of Central Florida's Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC), includes full-time employment with a solar installation company.\n\nWe are offering two different course formats that fit your life:\n\nAt SPC, you take classes online with an instructor on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings from 6-8 p.m. You can ask questions, participate in discussions, and get feedback immediately in this online format. Hands-on lab experiences are facilitated by an industry expert on the first Saturday of each month from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at SPC’s Allstate Campus, 3200 24th St. S.\n\nIn the FSEC program, you take online classes at your own pace with on-demand, pre-recorded lessons. Hands-on lab experiences are held on UCF’s Cocoa Campus, 1519 Clearlake Road, where they are led by an industry expert. Your instructor is always available by email or phone to respond to questions, grade assignments, and advise apprentices.\n\nBe in demand\n\nMastering these new skills will help keep you in demand in the Sunshine State, where job growth for solar technicians is expected to surge in one of the fastest growing industries.\n\nTo get started, let us know how we can connect below!"
