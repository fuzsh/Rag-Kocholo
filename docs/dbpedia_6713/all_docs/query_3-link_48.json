        "text": "Getting Started with Solar\n\nThe City of Sheridan is seeking ways to encourage solar energy development in our community. This webpage represents a collection of solar information and resources for the community. Our community’s solar goals can be found in its Solar Statement. For more information about the basics of solar energy, your solar options, and questions to ask solar professionals, read the Residential Consumer Guide to Solar Power and visit the Department of Energy’s Homeowner’s Guide to Going Solar.\n\nFor communities working towards designation:\n\nThe City of Sheridan is working to become a SolSmart designated community by implementing best practices to make it easier for residents and businesses to install and access solar energy. SolSmart is a national program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy that has helped hundreds of local governments become “open for solar business.” Learn more about this program.\n\nPolicies and Processes\n\nOur Solar Commitment\n\nThe city is committed to exceptional customer services as it relates to solar processes. To promote the continued advancement of solar in our community we are committed to the following:\n\nProviding clear guidelines about the solar permitting and inspection process in our solar checklist.\n\nUsing an online solar specific permit application.\n\nProcessing small rooftop solar PV permits applications in a turnaround time of 3 business days.\n\nOffering inspection appointment times for solar projects (instead of appointment windows), if requested.\n\nWorking with solar partners, such as GRID Alternatives, that aim to increase energy equity by removing the financial barrier to accessing solar for low-income households.\n\nThe Benefits of Going Solar\n\nSolar energy uses a renewable energy source – the sun – and provides many benefits for individuals and the community. It improves environmental quality by reducing carbon emissions and air pollution, supports local solar companies in Colorado, creates local jobs, saves money on energy costs, and improves electric grid resilience during peak demand and other stresses to the system.\n\nSolar Maps and Potential\n\nInvestigate your property’s solar potential by clicking here. You can also estimate the performance of potential PV projects using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s PVWatts Calculator.\n\nSolar Energy in Sheridan\n\nData derived from Xcel Energy Community Energy Reports (2022) for City of Sheridan that lists 41% of kWh from renewable energy. 2023 renewable energy percentage data pending. Total operations takes into consideration both kWh and therms.\n\nMunicipal Renewable Energy Projects, Goal: one by 2030, Current: zero\n\nMunicipal Operations Renewable Energy Usage: 18 percent\n\nNumber of residential solar PV permits issued since 2015: 100\n\nNumber of residential solar inspections processed: minimum four per permit\n\nAverage residential solar permit inspection timeline: 24 hours.\n\nFinding a Contractor and Going Solar\n\nFind a solar contractor(s) to assess your home or business for solar energy and provide a quote.\n\nCertified practitioners can be found through NABCEP.\n\nVisit EnergySage to learn about solar energy and submit for solar quotes from a network of pre-screened, local solar installers.\n\nSolar Customer Resource Portal – various resources from SEIA, the Solar Energy Industries Association.\n\nSolar Owner’s Manual – information for current solar homeowners to ensure they are getting the most out of their system from Solar United Neighbors.\n\nFinancing, Incentives, and Tax Exemptions\n\nTypically, solar installations are paid for through loans, upfront payments, or a power purchase agreement (PPA).\n\nA Homeowner’s Guide to Solar Financing is a resource from the Clean Energy States Alliance that provides an overview of the different financing options.\n\nFederal Incentives: There are many new incentives and funding opportunities available for solar and other clean energy technologies.\n\nA great place for residents to start identifying the federal incentives for which they are eligible is this calculator from Rewiring America. The rebates and incentives available through the federal Inflation Reduction Act can vary depending on your location and income.\n\nAdditional details about benefits in the Inflation Reduction Act can be found on the White House’s website or the Department of Energy website.\n\nThe Federal Investment Tax Credit for residential solar continues to be one of the most significant ways to reduce the cost of your solar PV system. Learn more about the federal tax credit, eligibility, and other common questions & answers in the Homeowner’s Guide to the Federal Tax Credit for Solar Photovoltaics from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nBusinesses should refer to the Federal Solar Tax Credits for Businesses.\n\nSome solar projects will be eligible for bonus credits on top of the 30% Investment Tax Credit. The Inflation Reduction Act provides up to 20% in bonus credits for qualified solar or wind facilities developed in low-income communities; up to 10% bonus for projects located in “energy communities” that have a historic fossil-fuel economy, high unemployment or are developing solar on a brownfield; and 10% domestic content bonus for projects using the required amounts of U.S.-produced steel, iron and manufactured products.\n\nThe World Resources Institute has created an IRA Bonus Mapper tool to help identify communities that are eligible for the low income and energy community bonus credits.\n\nTax-exempt organizations, including non-profit organizations, schools, and government entities, can now take advantage of the federal tax credit through “elective pay” (sometimes referred to as “direct pay.”) An overview of elective pay and Frequently Asked Questions are available from the IRS.\n\nState and local incentives:\n\nColorado does not have any general statewide property tax incentives for renewable energy.\n\nHowever, §§ 30-11-107.3 and 31-20-101.3, C.R.S., allow county and municipal governments to “offer an incentive, in the form of a [county/municipal] property tax or sales tax credit or rebate, to a residential or commercial property owner who installs a renewable energy fixture on his or her residential or commercial property.”\n\nInformation about state incentives can be found in this database maintained by the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center.\n\nMany new state programs are expected to be announced in 2024 as a result of federal funding. Stay tuned for announcements from your state!\n\nCity of Sheridan residents who meet income eligibility requirements may be able to secure free solar via GRID Alternatives Energy for All program.\n\nCity of Sheridan residents who meet income eligibility requirements may be able to participate in Energy Outreach Colorado’s Community Solar program.\n\nConsumer Protections, Solar Rights, and Procedures\n\nRead the City of Sheridan’s memo regarding the state’s Solar Access law Version Options Solar Energy Resources Headline. This covers Colorado’s 1979 Solar/Wind Easements and Rights Law, the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act (which covers solar access rights regarding properties covered under a homeowner’s association), and an association’s period of review and approval timeline for renewable energy devices.\n\nFind other useful resources on solar rights, consumer protection, and procedures.\n\nConsumer Solar Checklist – a checklist for residential consumers considering solar energy from IREC, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.\n\nSolar United Neighbors’ Solar Owner’s Manual - serves as a support for solar homeowners whether you’ve just gone solar or you’ve had solar for years.\n\nClean Energy Consumer Bill of Rights – ensure a positive consumer experience by addressing important issues from IREC, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.\n\nDatabase of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE) – provide state-specific information on incentives and policies that support renewable energy and energy efficiency in the United States.\n\nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood: Encouraging Solar Development through Community Association Policies and Processes – includes details on how communities can encourage solar development through community association policies and processes.\n\nJob Training and Educational Opportunities\n\nIf you are interested in pursuing a career in solar energy, here are some links to regional and national educational courses, programs, and/or trainings offered from colleges, universities, technical institutions, and non-profits.\n\nStrengthening Photovoltaic and Renewable Careers (SPARC) Workforce Development Program\n\nArapahoe Community College - Building Controls Technology Program\n\nGRID Alternatives – Solar Training Academy\n\nSolar Energy International – Colorado Solar Careers and Paonia Resource Guide\n\nEnergy Office – Solar Design and Installation Training\n\nMore Useful Solar Information\n\nColorado Energy Office – Clean Energy Programs\n\nXcel Energy\n\nSolar Energy\n\nRenewable Energy\n\nRenewable*Connect\n\nSolar*Rewards\\\n\nColorado Solar and Storage Association (COSSA)\n\nSolar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) - Colorado\n\nColorado Renewable Energy Society"
