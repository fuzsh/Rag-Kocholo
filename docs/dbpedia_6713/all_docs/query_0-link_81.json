        "text": "All solar installations that connect to the City Light power grid are required to have an Interconnection Agreement. If you install a net meter and generate more electricity than you consume, City Light will credit your electric bill for every kWh of electricity sent back to the power grid. Excess generation occurs when a solar energy system generates more kWh of electricity than a home consumes. This is measured in real-time by a City Light billing meter.\n\nNet Metering\n\nIf your solar system is up to 100 kW, our Net Metering program provides kWh credits on your bill for the energy you produce. These credits are valued at your retail rate of electricity. Any solar energy you generate that isn't immediately needed by your home goes back onto City Light's grid and is added to your account's net meter kWh credit balance, lowering your future bills.\n\nFind your retail rate.\n\nSee an example of a Solar Bill.\n\nReview and submit a Level 1 Interconnection Agreement.\n\nMeter Aggregation\n\nYou may also qualify for net meter aggregation which allows you to share excess generation with one additional City Light billing meter that is under the same account name and located on the same or a contiguous parcel. Sharing excess generation can reduce utility bills on an account not supported by your solar energy system."
