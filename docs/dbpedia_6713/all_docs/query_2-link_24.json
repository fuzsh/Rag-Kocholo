        "text": "“I fell in love with San Diego the day I drove in to start my internship at Solar in 2011. I told myself the company would have to be a terrible fit for me to not want to move out West permanently. Luckily for me Solar was a tremendous fit. From the first day, Solar has been a place where people will drop everything to help someone out. That fosters an environment where everyone can learn and grow at a fast pace. The other thing I like about Solar are the vast opportunities to try different roles and jobs both domestically and internationally. Working for a company that supports every corner of the globe is challenging and exciting. I look forward to being here for many years to come.”\n\n“As I approach my 8th year at Solar Turbines, I can't imagine having as many career experiences as I've had anywhere else. Solar has given me the ability to grow my engineering aptitude and leadership skills. With many opportunities to move around the company, I feel confident that I’ll always look forward to learning through new experiences. However, my favorite part about working her is Solar’s culture and focus on people.”"
