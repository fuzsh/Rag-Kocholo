        "meta_description": "Solar electricity is a clean and renewable resource that can provide a variety of benefits to the electrical grid. Solar installed behind-the-meter, such as on a homeowner’s rooftop, lowers load on the distribution system and can offset the building’s energy bill, while larger utility-scale solar farms provide clean power to the grid throughout the course of the day.",
