We help military-connected job seekers pursue solar training, professional development, and employment through career navigation resources, mentorship opportunities, and industry connections.\n\nRegistered Apprenticeships. We convene industry and training partners to advance registered apprenticeship opportunities through U.S. Department of Labor-approved occupations aligned with solar industry career pathways.\n\nSkillBridge for Solar. We connect employers to construction and electrical SkillBridge programs and launch a new standardized model to train service members for technical and skilled trades roles.\n\nVeterans Pathways to Certification. We promote streamlining requirements for solar certifications based on relevant military experience.\n\nEmployer Resources. Engage solar industry employers with resources to attract, hire, develop and retain qualified military talent at all levels of the workforce and amplify successes across the industry.\n\nAcknowledgment: This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) under Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) Agreement Number DE-EE0010493.\n\nDisclaimer: This report was prepared as an account of work sponsored by an agency of the United States Government.
