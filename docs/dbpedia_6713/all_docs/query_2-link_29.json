        "text": "The SEI Women in Solar Power Online Learning Community is a portal that offers an online discussion forum, career resources, and links to upcoming webinars and training. This portal is hosted within SEI’s Online Campus and is FREE to enroll in as a participant. Click the link below and you will be taken to this portal directly to self enroll. If this is your first time to the the SEI Online Campus, please create a new account to enroll. If you already have an SEI Online Campus login, you will be prompted to self enroll after you login. Click the button to get started.\n\nIn SEI’s 31+ years of educational service to the clean energy sector, we have served tens of thousands of women worldwide. As an organization, we take pride in having one of the largest teams of women instructors, curriculum developers, staff members, and women in leadership of any solar training provider in the industry. With that said, there is still a lot of work to be done.\n\nSolar Energy International’s Women in Solar Power program is a highly innovative approach to training women for jobs in the solar industry, addressing both the industry’s urgent need for workforce expansion and supporting career development for a diverse population of women. An unspoken deterrent to pursuing a career in the solar industry has been the predominance of men. Yet the solar industry offers a multitude of lucrative job prospects with a clear career path forward, and women across the world have invaluable expertise, skills and perspectives to contribute to the clean energy revolution. This program is unequivocally for them. There is no question that positive change will result from more women being an integral part of solar industry initiatives in the US and across the world.\n\nSEI is dedicated to help meet the ballooning workforce needs of the solar industry, and making sure women are not just included, but a driving force in the change to renewable energy. Since the relaunch of the program in 2022, we have made notable strides by connecting 462 women and non-binary individuals through solar energy training, networking, and mentorship opportunities, and awarding 132 scholarships to address barriers to entry, retention, and advancement in the photovoltaic solar workforce."
