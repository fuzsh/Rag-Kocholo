        "text": "​California’s Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides low-income households with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and energy efficiency upgrades at no cost to residents. LIWP is the only program of its kind in California that focuses exclusively on serving low-income households with solar PV and energy efficiency upgrades at no cost. ​The program reduces greenhouse gas emissions and household energy costs by saving energy and generating clean renewable power.\n\nLIWP is designed with the primary goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by saving energy and generating clean renewable energy for low-income single-family households and multi-family affordable housing. But just as importantly, the program reduces residential energy expenses for low-income households. These improvements also improve household conditions while reducing living expenses for residents – strengthening their economic security – and contribute to the health of communities through improved air quality. They also help lower operating costs for affordable housing operators, helping to preserve valuable below-market housing for low-income families.\n\nLIWP plays an important role in ensuring that all Californians have the opportunity to benefit from the State’s Climate Investments and program services. LIWP also helps cushion the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities, making it more affordable for low-income households to keep their homes cool and comfortable at a lower cost – whether through energy efficient air conditioning or improved insulation – and protect children and seniors from the health impacts of higher temperatures. And, as many low-income Californians are already struggling to make ends meet – and spending a higher proportion of their income on housing than ever before – LIWP can help by lowering utility bills and freeing up limited disposable income for other critical expenses.\n\n​Madera County Multi-Family Energy Efficiency and Renewables\n\n\"The improvements are really helping because it’s saving me money,\" said Diana Guzman. \"I’m saving up to $70 a month on my bills; I’m only paying $25 for PG&E. That makes a huge difference.\"\n\nDiana Guzman is a resident of Casas de la Viña, a 56-unit affordable apartment rental community that serves low-income families and farmworkers. The mother of two boys, Diana moved to Casas de la Viña when she needed to find a new home after the death of her husband.\n\nCasas de la Viña is one of several properties owned by Self-Help Enterprises, an organization that develops affordable housing to serve the needs of low-income Central Valley residents. One of the many ways that Self-Help Enterprises supports low-income families is by helping them save money on their electric bills through improvements made throughout their properties.\n\nSelf-Help Enterprises was able to install solar PV systems and make energy efficiency improvements at Casas de la Viña with Cap-and-Trade dollars from CSD’s LIWP. The LIWP Multi-Family Energy Efficiency and Renewables subprogram administrator, the Association for Energy Affordability, provides technical assistance and incentives for the installation of energy-efficiency measures and solar PV in low-income multi-family dwellings in disadvantaged communities. The LIWP Multi-Family Energy Efficiency and Renewables subprogram not only reduces GHG emissions, it also reduces energy costs. And, by lowering operating costs for property owners, it also helps preserve affordable housing.\n\nProteus, a nonprofit that provides education, job training, job placement, and other services to farm working families, installed several of the energy-saving measures on the property. Overall, the project included a deep energy efficiency and renewable energy retrofit, with the installation of more than 181 kilowatts of solar panels generating 95 percent of the development’s energy needs onsite to offset resident energy bills. The project also consisted of the installation of efficient new heat pump heating and cooling systems, heat pump water heaters, energy efficient windows, LED lighting, refrigerators and plumbing fixtures.\n\nDiana has seen first-hand the benefits of the improvements made to Casas de la Viña. \"The improvements are really helping because it’s saving me money,\" said Diana. \"I’m saving up to $70 a month on my bills; I’m only paying $25 for PG&E. That makes a huge difference.\"\n\nThanks to Casas de la Viña’s participation in the LIWP Multi-Family Energy Efficiency and Renewables subprogram, the community expects to achieve zero net energy, with the property now generating as much energy as it consumes. Over its quantification period, the solar PV system and installed energy efficiency measures will lead to an estimated reduction of over 3,000 MTCO2e in GHG emissions.\n\nJust as important, the residents of Casas de la Viña will now be able to use the money they save on utility bills to support their family’s other critical needs. In Diana’s case, those savings are going towards necessities like clothes and school supplies for her boys.\n\n​Riverside County Single-Family Energy Efficiency and Solar Photovoltaics\n\n\"I’m extremely excited and grateful to the State for providing this program,\" said Irma Vargas. \"(It) allows us to feel safer and more comfortable in our home with services we would not be able to afford ourselves.\"\n\nFor years, Irma Vargas’ family of four struggled to pay the high utility bills that come with living on the north shore of the Salton Sea in Mecca while still maintaining a comfortable and healthy home for their children. The family’s limited income made the $400 per month bill nearly impossible during the summer months when temperatures can exceed 110°F in their Riverside County community.\n\nRelief finally came when the La Cooperativa Campesina de California approved their application for energy efficiency services. La Cooperativa is a regional administrator for the CSD’s LIWP, which is funded by Cap-and-Trade dollars.\n\nAn assessment of the Vargas home uncovered the need for a number of improvements to help reduce the family’s utility bill through improved energy efficiency, ultimately increasing their disposable income.\n\nThe Vargas’ also qualified for a rooftop solar PV system and received a new high efficiency heating and air conditioning system, window replacements, LED light bulbs, power strips, and low-flow shower heads among other improvements.\n\nOverall, Irma is very happy with the improvements, which are expected to lower the family’s utility bill by approximately 75 percent."
