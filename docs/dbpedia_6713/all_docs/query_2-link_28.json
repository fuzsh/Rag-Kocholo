        "text": "In the first round of the Solar Energy Innovation Network (SEIN), nine teams developed new ways to improve the affordability, reliability, and resiliency of solar energy on the electric grid while moving toward ambitious solar adoption goals.\n\nSEIN Round 1 teams received direct funding, analytical support, and facilitation support to supercharge their projects. The nine teams were grouped into two cohorts—Options Analysis and Grid Flex—based on shared challenges and goals. The Options Analysis cohort shared a focus on evaluating and experimenting with the ways solar photovoltaics (PV) could support long-term climate and clean energy goals. The Grid Flex cohort focused on developing and testing novel approaches to deploying solar PV in ways that would support resilience and combine solar PV with other technologies, such as electric vehicle (EV) charging. Their projects are described below.\n\nIn addition to team-level efforts, the Innovation Network produced products and tools to address questions identified by Round 1 teams, including:\n\nUnderstanding the potential impact of EVs on electricity demand\n\nIdentifying considerations for the structure of new solar tariffs and programs\n\nDeveloping plans for moving from solar energy goals to implementation for cities and states pursuing 100% renewable energy economies\n\nAnalyzing and compensating the locational value of solar to provide grid and resiliency benefits.\n\nParticipating Teams\n\nThis map highlights the locations of SEIN Round 1 teams and potential adopters of SEIN outputs (peer network; see below for more detail).\n\nImproving Reliability and Affordability of Renewable Energy Through Options Analysis and Systems Design Cohort\n\nThis cohort, also called \"Options Analysis,\" focused on the role that solar PV could play in achieving high penetration goals in several different contexts. This included understanding grid impacts, planning potential pathways, and developing novel solutions to overcome barriers anticipated for high penetration levels of solar and other distributed energy resources (DERs). Activities in this cohort included:\n\nDeveloping data sets and geospatial mapping tools that assessed impacts on the reliability of various levels of variable generation at the municipal or utility service territory scale\n\nIdentifying and validating new solar siting methods that minimized grid impacts and reduced distribution system costs\n\nIdentifying innovative ownership models, financing structures, and procurement strategies\n\nExploring options for the integrated planning and deployment of solar and EVs and solar plus storage\n\nExploring alternative rate designs and compensation mechanisms.\n\nThe five project teams for this cohort are described below.\n\nImproving Grid Flexibility and Resiliency Through Advanced Siting and Operations of Solar Plus DER Cohort\n\nThis cohort, also called \"Grid Flex,\" focused on quantifying the value of combining solar and other DERs, such as storage for grid flexibility, reliability, and resiliency.\n\nActivities for this cohort included:\n\nAssessing opportunities to improve PV's value through siting, load management, storage, and better integration with transportation electrification\n\nEvaluating options for rate structures and other compensation mechanisms to effectively value solar-plus-DER systems' various value streams\n\nExploring program and policy options to account for locational value and wholesale market participation\n\nImproving utility and independent system operator/regional transmission organization (ISO/RTO) planning to incorporate PV and other DERs into activities like black start\n\nDeveloping needed data sets and tools for states and ISOs to evaluate solar-plus-DER solutions for increased grid resiliency.\n\nThe four project teams that participated in this cohort are described below.\n\nPublications\n\nVisit the SEIN publications page and filter by Round 1 to see all the publications from the first round teams.\n\nPeer Network\n\nThe Peer Network was composed of stakeholder pursuing projects that were thematically related to SEIN Round 1 teams. The teams pursued projects described below while frequently engaging with SEIN Round 1 teams to exchange ideas and stress test approaches. Peer Network teams received assistance in adapting research, analytical pathways, and innovative approaches to their individual contexts.\n\nThe relevant efforts of the six Peer Network teams are summarized below."
