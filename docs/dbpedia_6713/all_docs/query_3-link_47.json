The law also allows such customers to receive full retail credit for any excess electricity their renewable energy systems generate.\n\nLegislation from the 2020 Virginia General Assembly amended the net metering program and increased the maximum capacity of renewable generation facilities of residential customer-generators from 20 kilowatts to 25 kilowatts, and non-residential customer-generators from one to three megawatts. It also increased the generation capacity cap to 150 percent of a facilities expected annual energy consumption for customers in Dominion Energy Virginia's service territory. Additionally, the legislation increased each utility's system wide net metering cap from one percent of its adjusted Virginia peak-load forecast for the previous year to six percent of such amount, five percent of which is available to all customers and one percent is reserved for low-income utility customers.\n\nMonthly net excess generation is carried forward into the subsequent month. At the end of each twelve-month net metering period, the utility customer may receive financial compensation for any excess generation by entering into a power purchase agreement with their electric utility.\n\nFor details on net metering, a renewable energy system, please see the State Corporation Commission Regulations Governing Net Energy Metering.\n\nSolSmart\n\nVirginia Energy and UVA are pleased to launch a Virginia SolSmart no-cost technical advisor program with support from The Solar Foundation to bring solar-specific resources and technical assistance to localities across Virginia.

These installations are typically ground-mounted and cover very large areas. Utility-scale projects can take several years to build and must comply with local and state government requirements.
