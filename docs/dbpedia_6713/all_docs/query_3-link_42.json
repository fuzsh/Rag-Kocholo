        "text": "• Solar industry specific career counseling and services\n\n• A certificate of program completion, with unique certificate number and certificate path listed, from the leading solar training organization in the industry – Solar Energy International – upon successful completion of the program\n\n• Fulfill the knowledge and training hours requirement to take both the NABCEP PV Associate Exam and the NABCEP PV Installation Professional or PV Technical Sales Certification Exam\n\n• Access to premium employment posting opportunities within the SEI Online Career Center and other premium online career resources\n\n• Use of the Solar Professionals Certificate Seal upon successful completion of program. This is a great tool to use on LinkedIn.\n\n• Tuition incentive for discounted pricing (pay all at once) or payment plan option (full price, no interest).\n\n• Graduation announcement in SEI’s monthly e-newsletter.\n\n• An SEI sticker at your lab workshop in Paonia (based on availability).\n\nTo view a list of Program Graduates please visit our Certificate Program Graduate List.\n\nAt the end of each training course and upon receiving a passing grade of 70% you will receive a formal SEI Record of Completion for each individual course. Upon completion of the entire program of training with a passing grade in all courses, you will have earned your SEI Solar Professionals Certificate.\n\nA passing grade of 70% will be required to be considered as a passing grade for any given online course. In-person classroom and lab trainings do not require assessments through quizzes, however your pass/fail grade will be based on an assessment demonstrating that you have mastered the essential knowledge and skills taught within the course, as well as your attendance. For more information please click here to view our school catalog grading and assessment section.\n\nIn recognition to all of our past students in our 25 years of existence, you will be able to transfer in any SEI training you have taken in the past towards any certificate path. This training will be honored as long as the training contact hours duration and learning outcomes are consistent with current course offerings for which you are transferring in to satisfy your chosen certificate path requirements.\n\nFor many of our past students this will mean that they have already satisfied all the required training for a given certificate path or may be only one or two courses away from completion. If you are an SEI alumni and feel that you have completed the required training for any of the Solar Professional Certificate paths, please fill out the certificate program application to join. You can also call the Student Services Team for an SEI transcript review. If you have indeed taken all courses that you need for any particular certificate program path and are accepted into the program, we require a $150 transcript review fee.\n\nSEI will allow the application of previous training credit from another training organization, but only for a PV101 and/or PV203 equivalent training or comparable current solar industry work experience. This can only be used for a PV101 and/or PV203 level of training and does not apply to any other training experience you may have acquired elsewhere. The SEI Student Services Team will be able to determine if you qualify for this transfer of training credit upon reviewing your application. You will be required to take the online quiz for PV101 or PV203 in order to qualify for this transfer of past training towards an SEI Solar Professionals Certificate path."
