The updated program will achieve the same goals as outlined below, with adjustments in how many residents this program will serve. Please check out the EnergizeNC.com website for more details on the revised program details.\n\nSign up for Updates\n\nBackground\n\nOn June 28, 2023, EPA released the $7 billion Solar for All Notice of Funding Opportunity, part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund authorized by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act. The overall goal of the Solar for All competition is to expand the number of low-income and disadvantaged communities that are primed for investment in residential and community solar. The competition will provide up to 60 grants to states, territories, Tribal governments, municipalities, and eligible nonprofit recipients ranging from $25 million to $400 million across the country.\n\nNorth Carolina’s Proposed EnergizeNC Program\n\nTo maximize the benefits to North Carolina's low-income and disadvantaged communities, the EnergizeNC coalition plans to design programs that have the greatest impact with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lessening energy burdens, and improving quality of life. Specifically, the coalition will focus on four goals:\n\nGoal #1: Create a comprehensive project management approach over a one-year planning period to include input from low-income and disadvantaged communities.\n\nGoal #2: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower energy costs, and foster environmental justice through the installation of rooftop solar at low-income single-family and multifamily units across North Carolina, including community solar access.\n\nGoal #3: Foster and develop a trained workforce to deploy solar in all regions of the state, especially in minority and tribal communities, while working to ensure transparent ethical and business practices that protect consumers from potential market abuses.\n\nGoal #4: Provide robust community engagement to ensure that project benefits flow to disadvantaged communities and individuals.\n\nTo bring the highest impact to North Carolina families, EnergizeNC will focus its financial incentive programs on providing meaningful household energy savings in three priority areas:"
