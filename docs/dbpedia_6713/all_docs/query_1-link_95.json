        "text": "The ACP Guidelines for Entry-Level Solar PV O&M Technician provide a clear route for new entrants into the utility-scale solar PV industry and guide a person towards the appropriate training for the different job profiles of solar PV O&M technicians. The Entry Level Solar PV O&M Technician Guidelines will establish a transparent and valid set of standardized skills for entry level technician roles in the operations and maintenance solar PV technicians as it relates to large-scale or utility-scale solar facilities. Residential and Commercial solar technicians might have some similarities in the training requirements, however the safety, code, and building requirements may vary and this may require separate, specific training for those solar segments.\n\nSince the industry has immediate safety and technical training needs for a quickly growing workforce the Guidelines help to establish aligned training programs and expectations for employers, training providers, and institutions that align with industry needs. Since the Standards process can take months, and possibly years, ACP decided to take action to develop the training guidelines as requested by the industry members.\n\nFor many companies, outsourcing training is typically used to get technicians trained. The hope is that when training is outsourced, companies will look to training entities that train to the ACP recommendations and utilize the guidelines in doing so.\n\nFor other training institutions, the training curriculum should be expected to have similar alignment with the Guidelines to align with the consensus industry recommendations.\n\nOrganizations that have developed programs and are already conducting training should have minimal impact. It is recommended a gap analysis be performed on the in-house training and the ACP Guidelines. Any gaps identified can be considered to add to the organizationâ€™s training program to align with the industry recommendations. Any organizations meeting the standard or going above the minimum standard would have no change to the training programs they have in place.\n\nHowever, companies with in-house training programs that align with the ACP standard and guidelines may also see a benefit in tailoring their in-house training to company-specific policies, procedures and equipment and instead relying on other training entities to do the basic safety and technical training covered in the ACP materials prior to the company-specific training.\n\nan option but is not required. Organizations can use SEI, other training providers, develop in-house training, or any combination of those that meet the minimum guideline. Organizations or institutions with comparable training programs may use this guideline to establish their own third-party verification to seek recognition as meeting the industry consensus Guideline. Organizations or institutions should be advised that recognition of this Guideline will always be dependent on, but not limited to, the regulatory, contractual, or owner specified requirements for any given site, and cannot be guaranteed though the application of this guideline.\n\nCertification is the action or process of providing someone or something with an official document attesting to a status or level of achievement. This would typically include some formal testing whether passing a written examination or in person practical validation by a certifying instructor.\n\nCertificate of Completion is simply attending a course and gaining credit for participating.\n\nThese are two particularly important distinctions and, in most cases, since there is no standardized testing to ensure knowledge and terminal objectives are met, many training certificates are certificates of completion. This is something to verify with your training providers.\n\nMost training is incomplete without demonstrated proficiency or competency for qualification.\n\nPer 29 CFR 1910.269(a)(2)(viii) The employer shall ensure that each employee has demonstrated proficiency in the work practices involved before that employee is considered as having completed the training required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n\n29 CFR 1910.9 (b)Training. Standards in this part requiring training on hazards and related matters, such as standards requiring that employees receive training or that the employer train employees, provide training to employees, or institute or implement a training program, impose a separate compliance duty with respect to each employee covered by the requirement. The employer must train each affected employee in the manner required by the standard, and each failure to train an employee may be considered a separate violation.\n\nMicro-credentials are a tool and mechanism to ensure employers have the tools to validate competency and proficiency and would be managed by the employer during the qualification phase. ACP has published 30+ micro credentials and plans to add additional ones throughout the year here: https://cleanpower.org/resources/micro-credentials/.\n\nSolar O&M technicians are expected to perform a wide variety of tasks, mechanical and electrical, which contain intrinsic hazards. Without the proper training, these tasks would be considered very dangerous. Additionally, technicians often work without direct supervision, so it is critical that skills be taught, and competency verified, before the technician is considered qualified to perform a task alone. It is also critical to nurture a culture of personal responsibility and a high level of conformance to procedures as a part of the overall operational management strategy. Technicians can only be expected to remain safe if they clearly understand the hazards associated with given tasks and are self-motivated to avoid unnecessary risk to themselves or others. Although various agency requirements may apply, the focus will be primarily on entry-level operations and maintenance personnel who generally would be expected to:\n\nPerform:\n\nAwareness of and the ability to follow all health and safety and operating procedures.\n\nStop-work authority when unsure or unsafe.\n\nParticipate in daily job task planning activities as it relates to the safe performance of tasks.\n\nPerform a hazard recognition of the work area to determine personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements.\n\nUse of a variety of PPE such as arc flash clothing, insulated gloves, glasses, helmets, and boots.\n\nInteract with stakeholders as directed by manager and ensure safety.\n\nWrite (some using computer or mobile device) routine reports and correspondence. Maintain service logs and monitor system performance.\n\nFollow written procedures and equipment manuals.\n\nExternal visual inspections of system equipment to include fencing, solar modules (panels), combiner boxes, wiring systems, racking, or tracking systems, pad-mount transformers, communications equipment, and meteorological stations.\n\nWire management.\n\nLift or move repair parts.\n\nIdentification of vegetation management needs.\n\nInterpret and respond to weather impacts.\n\nAssist under the supervision of a Qualified Electrical Worker (QEW) in:\n\nSafe operation and performance of mechanical and electrical maintenance activities for inverters, combiner boxes, tracking systems, and switchgear.\n\nCollecting inverter data for testing or research and analysis.\n\nReplacement of PV modules or PV module connectors (example: MC4).\n\nReplacement of inverter components.\n\nIdentification of failures, faults, and problems, and implementation of corrective actions.\n\nConducting acceptance and performance tests on systems and equipment following planned maintenance and outages.\n\nThe fundamental areas of knowledge, skill, and ability typically required for a Solar PV O&M Technician are:\n\nAbility to maintain employer fitness for duty requirements.\n\nAttention to detail.\n\nComprehend basic system diagrams, schematics, and symbols.\n\nCollaboration and teamwork.\n\nMechanical and electrical fundamentals.\n\nProficient with basic software, computer, and mobile devices."
