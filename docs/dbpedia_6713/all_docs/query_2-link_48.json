        "text": "Below is a list of resources for solar, biomass, hydroelectric, and wind energy.\n\nSolar\n\nPublications\n\nVermonter's Guide to Residential Solar (2018)\n\nThere are many ways to build and finance a solar PV system, and navigating these options can be challenging. This guide (revised since the original 2016 version) aims to help homeowners decide whether it makes sense for them to go solar, and if so, how. The guide, “A Vermonter’s Guide to Residential Solar,” was written by the Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA) for the Vermont Department of Public Service. It is divided into sections so that readers can refer to relevant information at different points in the decision-making and installation process.\n\nGuidance for Third-Party Solar Projects: Developed by the Vermont Attorney General's Office in partnership with the Department of Public Service, this guidance clarifies the statements that a solar provider may make about the renewable nature of solar projects in which the Renewable Energy Certificates are retained and sold by the solar provider.\n\nA Consumer's Guide to Buying a Solar Electric System: Developed by the U.S. Department of Energy, September 1999.\n\nTemplate for Group Net Metering Agreements for Vermont Municipal and School District Solar Projects: Developed in partnership with the Vermont League of Cities and Towns, the Vermont School Boards Association, the Vermont Superintendents Association-School Energy Management Program, the Vermont Natural Resources Council, and supporting attorneys, April 2015.\n\nHow to Size A Grid-Connected Solar Electric System: Published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, August 2002.\n\nHow to Install Solar in Vermont: Published by the Northeast Vermont Development Association.\n\nA Guide to Community Solar: Utility, Private, and Nonprofit Project Development: Published by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nThe Solarize Guidebook: A Community Guide to Collective Purchasing of Residential PV Systems: Published by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nPhotovoltaics as a Line Extension Alternative: For people who need electric power in a remote location, where a utility line extension may be cost prohibitive and photovoltaic (PV) may be a preferable alternative, one possible option before investing in a line extension is an off-the-grid PV power system. For purposes of comparison, it is helpful to understand the life-cycle costs, lifestyle impacts, and expansion possibilities of a PV system.\n\nThe Solar Electric Option (Instead of a Power Line Extension) (PDF 1 MB): An overview of how PV technology works, how PV systems are designed, safety issues, three examples of remote applications, and a glossary of terms.

Twenty-eight pages. By David Berry and Robert Gray, Utilities Division, Arizona Corporation Commission.\n\nWebsites\n\nVermont Energy and Climate Action Network (VECAN) Community Solar Toolbox: This page helps communities and community members understand common models and approaches to community solar in Vermont and provides helpful best practices, case studies, and resources.\n\nThe Leasing Municipal and Private Property for Solar fact sheet from the Solar Foundation contains information that may be useful to Vermonters considering leasing their land for solar development.\n\nVermont Solar Consumer Guide from Renewable Energy Vermont and the Residential Consumer Guide to Solar Power from the Solar Energy Industries Association.\n\nPVWatts Calculator: PVWatts Calculator was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to help individuals estimate the energy production and cost of energy of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) energy systems at their home or business. Homeowners, businesses, and researchers use the PVWatts Calculator to develop quick estimates of renewable energy production at locations throughout the U.S. The PVWatts Calculator uses a map-based interface to allow you to choose the exact location of your PV array. Based on your location, system size, and other variables, the PVWatts Calculator estimates the electricity production you can expect from your system.\n\nTracking the Sun: This is Berkeley Lab’s annual report that summarizes installed prices and other trends among grid-connected, distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in the United States. While not a direct substitute for the U.S. Department of Energy's Open PV Project, which was discontinued in 2019, it does contain much of the same data from a variety of sources including utilities, installers, and the general public.\n\nDOE's Solar America Communities program is committed to developing a sustainable solar infrastructure that removes market barriers and encourages the adoption of solar energy by residents and businesses in local communities. The objective is to develop comprehensive approaches that lay the foundation for a viable solar market and provide a model for communities throughout the United States. The National Community Solar Partnership will bring the lessons learned and best practices from the Solar America Cities partnerships to communities across the United States.\n\nDatabase of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE) provides comprehensive information on state, local, utility, and federal incentives and policies that promote solar energy. Funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Program, DSIRE provides solar-specific policy information to consumers, policy-makers, businesses, utilities, researchers and other stakeholders.\n\nBiomass\n\nPublications\n\nBiomass Energy Development Working Group Final Report: VT Legislative Council\n\nState Forest Resource Assessment: VT Department of Forests, Parks & Recreation\n\nBiomass Sustainability and Carbon Policy Study: Manoment Center for Conservation Sciences\n\nVermont Biofuels Initiative: Local Production for Local Use to Supply a Portion of Vermont's Energy Needs\n\nWebsites\n\nBiomass Energy Resource Center\n\nVT Department of Forests, Parks & Recreation\n\nVT Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets\n\nVT Sustainable Jobs Fund Bioenergy Initiative\n\nHydropower\n\nVermont Small Hydropower Assistance Program\n\nThis program is no longer active, but the resources below may assist those considering hydropower development to better understand the federal permitting requirements and process and the role of state agencies in that process.\n\nVermont Small Hydropower Assistance Program Overview\n\nStep 1 Screening Criteria Summary and Application Instructions\n\nStep 1 Application Form\n\nStep 2 Site-Specific Determinations Summary\n\nThe draft screening criteria, combined stakeholder comments, and summary of comments with reply comments are also available.\n\nPublications\n\nAct 165 Report: A Biennial Report to the Vermont General Assembly on Procedures for Facilitating Development of Small and Micro Hydroelectric Projects: VT Department of Public Service (2018)\n\nAct 165 Report: A Biennial Report to the Vermont General Assembly on Procedures for Facilitating Development of Small and Micro Hydroelectric Projects: VT Department of Public Service (2016)\n\nAct 165 Report: A Report to the Vermont General Assembly on Progress Toward an MOU Program for Expediting Development of Small and Micro Hydroelectric Projects: VT Department of Public Service (2014)\n\nAn Assessment of Energy Potential at Non-Powered Dams in the United States: U.S. Department of Energy\n\nU.S. Hydropower Resource Assessment for Vermont: Idaho National Laboratory\n\nThe Development of Small Hydroelectric Projects in Vermont: VT Agency of Natural Resources\n\nThe Undeveloped Hydroelectric Potential of Vermont, Appendix A, and Potential Sites: Lori Barg, Community Hydro, 2008\n\nVermont Hydroelectric Development Handbook: VT Public Utility Commission\n\nHydropower Primer: A Handbook of Hydropower Basics: U.S. Department of Energy & Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 2017\n\nIntroduction to Hydropower: Home Power, 2004\n\nWebsites\n\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission's Small/Low Impact Hydropower Projects:This website provides resources for hydropower developers on federal permitting regulations for small (generally < 10 MW) and low-impact hydropower projects.\n\nVermont Agency of Natural Resources (ANR) - Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Watershed Management Division Hydroelectric Power website: This page describes ANR's involvement in hydroelectric project permitting and includes links to the DEC's Clean Water Act § 401 Water Quality Certification Practice document and application.\n\nAgency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD) State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO): This page lists resources including how to appeal to the SHPO for a project review under § 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.\n\nU.S. Department of Energy's Hydropower Assessment Program.
