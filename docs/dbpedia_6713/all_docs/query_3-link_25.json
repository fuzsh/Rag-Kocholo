        "text": "Solar energy is a powerful source of energy that can be used to heat, cool, and light homes and businesses.\n\nMore energy from the sun falls on the earth in one hour than is used by everyone in the world in one year. A variety of technologies convert sunlight to usable energy for buildings. The most commonly used solar technologies for homes and businesses are solar photovoltaics for electricity, passive solar design for space heating and cooling, and solar water heating.\n\nBusinesses and industry use solar technologies to diversify their energy sources, improve efficiency, and save money. Energy developers and utilities use solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power technologies to produce electricity on a massive scale to power cities and small towns.\n\nLearn more about the following solar technologies:\n\nSolar Photovoltaic Technology\n\nConverts sunlight directly into electricity to power homes and businesses.\n\nPassive Solar Technology\n\nProvides light and harnesses heat from the sun to warm our homes and businesses in winter.\n\nSolar Water Heating\n\nHarnesses heat from the sun to provide hot water for homes and businesses.\n\nSolar Process Heat\n\nUses solar energy to heat or cool commercial and industrial buildings.\n\nConcentrating Solar Power\n\nHarnesses heat from the sun to provide electricity for large power stations.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nFor more information about solar energy, visit the following resources:\n\nSolar Energy Technology Basics\n\nU.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy\n\nU.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon\n\nEnergy Kids Solar Basics\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration Energy Kids"
