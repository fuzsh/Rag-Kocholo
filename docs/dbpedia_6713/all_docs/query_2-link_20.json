        "text": "The Solar Energy Innovation Network (SEIN) helps communities develop transformative approaches to adopting solar energy. Teams develop their ideas in real-world contexts, yielding results that can unlock tomorrow's solar markets.\n\nSEIN seeks to overcome barriers to solar adoption by connecting teams of stakeholders that are pioneering new ideas with the resources they need to succeed.\n\nTeams that participate in SEIN receive support from U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories and participate in peer-to-peer learning with other teams that are tackling similar challenges. These teams are developing and documenting their solutions for solar adoption with scale in mind, so that others can adapt those solutions to their own contexts.\n\nTopics by Round\n\nSEIN is currently in its third round. Each round lasts about 18 months and brings together new teams to address a different topic. The first and second rounds have completed.\n\nSolar Community Assistance for Local Equity\n\nNREL offers targeted analytical support to help other communities and organizations adopt and apply insights developed through the Innovation Network. Learn more about community assistance and apply.\n\nPublications\n\nVisit the SEIN publications page to browse publications from all rounds of the Solar Energy Innovation Network.\n\nProgram Structure\n\nTeams are grouped into cohorts based on shared challenges and goals. Over the course of 18 months, teams receive direct funding, analytical support from NREL and other expert partners, and facilitation support.\n\nThrough coordinated engagement at multiday working sessions spread across the 18 months, teams also work together to identify local and regional benefits and barriers, formulate and test innovations, and validate new models. Sustained interaction with other teams creates a valuable platform for ensuring a team's solutions benefit from lessons learned elsewhere and are devised in ways that maximize replicability. Insights and results from the program are shared at a symposium at the end of each round, through NREL publications, and on this website.\n\nSEIN is funded by the DOE Solar Energy Technologies Office and is led by NREL.\n\nContact"
