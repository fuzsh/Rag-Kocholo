        "text": "Map solar energy\n\nNext, you'll create a raster layer that maps how much solar energy reaches rooftop surfaces in Glover Park over the course of a typical year. The more solar energy a roof surface receives, the more electric power could be generated if it were equipped with solar panels.\n\nCreate a solar radiation layer\n\nTo create the solar radiation layer, you'll use the Area Solar Radiation tool. This tool is part of the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension and takes a DSM as input. It calculates radiation based on a sophisticated model that takes into account the position of the sun throughout the year and at different times of day, obstacles that may block sunlight such as nearby trees or buildings, and the slope and orientation of the surface. You can read more about modeling solar radiation in the Modeling solar radiation help documentation.\n\nThe DSM provides the necessary information on obstacles, orientation, and slope. The output will be a raster layer where each cell value is the amount of solar radiation in watt-hours per square meter (Wh/m2) at that location.\n\nThe Area Solar Radiation tool is computationally intense and can take between 20 and 90 minutes to run. For the purposes of this exercise, you will have the option of running the tool yourself or using a solar radiation raster layer that has already been created and was provided with the project data. Regardless of your choice, you'll first learn how to select the right parameter values for the tool.\n\nOn the ribbon, on the Analysis tab, in the Geoprocessing group, click Tools.\n\nThe Geoprocessing pane appears.\n\nSearch for and open the Area Solar Radiation tool.\n\nIn the Area Solar Radiation tool, for Input raster, choose DSM. For Output global radiation raster, change the output name to Solar_Rad_Whm2_my_own.\n\nThe name Solar_Rad_Whm2_my_own is to differentiate it from the ready-made layer Solar_Rad_Whm2 that you downloaded, and to make sure you don’t overwrite it.\n\nWhen the input raster is chosen, the Latitude parameter is automatically populated with the latitude of the DSM. This parameter helps determine the sun's position.\n\nBy default, the tool runs using an interval of several days. You'll change the time interval to compute the solar radiation over the course of an entire year.\n\nFor Time configuration, choose Whole year. If necessary, for Year, type 2021 or the current year.\n\nBy default, the tool computes the amount of solar radiation once every half hour for each day sampled. You will change the Hour interval to once every hour to reduce calculation time.\n\nFor Hour interval, type 1.\n\nBy default, the tool checks 32 directions around each cell to find light-blocking obstacles. To reduce calculation time, you will change this value to 16.\n\nExpand Topographic parameters. For Calculation directions, type 16.\n\nYou'll also change the tool environments, setting the Building_Footprints layer as a mask, so that only areas within the building footprints will be processed, saving calculation time.\n\nClick the Environments tab.\n\nUnder Raster Analysis, for Mask, choose Building_Footprints.\n\nAs mentioned, the Area Solar Radiation tool is computationally intense. If you want to run the tool (it may take 20 to 90 minutes to run), click Run.\n\nIf instead, you prefer to use the raster layer that was already created, on the ribbon, on the View tab, in the Windows group, click Catalog Pane. In the Catalog pane, expand Databases and Solar_in_Glover.gdb. Right-click Solar_Rad_Whm2 and choose Add To Current Map.\n\nDepending on whether you create the layer yourself or add the existing layer to the map, the layer symbology may differ. Later in the tutorial, you will change the layer's symbology, so its current variation does not matter.\n\nSave the project.\n\nConvert the units of measurement\n\nThe solar radiation raster uses watt-hours per square meter as its unit of measurement. According to the legend in the Contents pane, some cells have values of over 1 million (expressed with the notation e+06). To reduce the size of these values and make them easier to read, you'll convert the raster layer to kilowatt-hours per square meter (kWh/m2).\n\nYou won't need the Building_Footprints layer for the next steps, so you'll turn it off.\n\nIn the Contents pane, uncheck Building_Footprints to turn it off.\n\nIn the Geoprocessing pane, click the Back button to go back to the search functionality (you may need to click it twice).\n\nSearch for and open Raster Calculator (Spatial Analysis Tool).\n\nThere are 1,000 watts in a kilowatt, so to convert the units of measurement, you need to create an expression that divides existing cell values by 1,000.\n\nIn the Raster Calculator tool, for Map Algebra expression, type (or build) the following expression:\n\n\"Solar_Rad_Whm2\" / 1000\n\nIf you created your own solar radiation raster layer, the name of the layer in the expression will be Solar_Rad_Whm2_my_own instead of Solar_Rad_Whm2.\n\nFor Output raster, change the output name to Solar_Rad.\n\nClick Run.\n\nThe new raster layer is created and added to the map. It is similar to the original solar radiation layer, but the values are 1,000 times smaller.\n\nYou no longer need the original solar radiation layer, so you will remove it.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click Solar_Rad_Whm2 (or Solar_Rad_Whm2_my_own) and choose Remove.\n\nSymbolize the solar radiation layer\n\nNext, you will symbolize the Solar_Rad layer. For your analysis, you'll use uniform symbology for all solar radiation raster layers to ensure that they can be compared visually. You will apply a layer file with predefined symbology to the layer. This layer file was included with the project data you downloaded.\n\nIn the Contents pane, click the Solar_Rad color ramp.\n\nThe Symbology pane appears.\n\nIn the Symbology pane, click the options button and choose Import from layer file.\n\nIn the Import Symbology window, expand Folders and Solar_in_Glover. Double-click Solar_Rad.lyrx.\n\nThe layer file is applied to the layer. The new symbology appears on the map.\n\nClose the Symbology pane.\n\nZoom in to better see the rooftop surfaces.\n\nRed and orange colors indicate higher amounts of solar radiation, while yellow and blue tones indicate lower amounts. (The cells that are outside the Building_Footprints polygons have not been computed. They have a value of NoData and are not displayed.)\n\nNorth-facing roof slopes have blue and yellow tones, as they tend to receive less solar energy than south-facing ones. Additionally, roofs blocked by trees or other buildings sometimes receive very little solar energy.\n\nZoom out to return to the full extent of the neighborhood. Save the project.\n\nIn this module, you mapped the annual solar energy received on Glover Park rooftops. First, you created a solar radiation raster layer. Then, you converted the units of measurement and symbolized the layer for visualization purposes. Next, you'll identify rooftops suitable for solar panels.\n\nIdentify suitable rooftops\n\nTo identify suitable rooftops for solar panels, you will consider three criteria:\n\nSuitable rooftops should have a slope of 45 degrees or less, as steep slopes tend to receive less sunlight. To determine rooftop slope, you must create a slope raster layer.\n\nSuitable rooftops should receive at least 800 kWh/m2 of solar radiation. You can assess this criterion using your solar radiation raster layer.\n\nSuitable rooftops should not face north, as north-facing rooftops in the northern hemisphere receive less sunlight. To determine rooftop orientation, you must create an aspect raster layer.\n\nCreate a slope layer\n\nFirst, you will use the Surface Parameters tool to create a slope raster layer based on your DSM.\n\nIf necessary, open the Geoprocessing pane. If the Geoprocessing pane is already open, click the Back button.\n\nIn the Geoprocessing pane, search for and open the Surface Parameters (Spatial Analyst Tools) tool, and enter the following parameters:\n\nFor Input surface raster, choose DSM.\n\nFor Output raster, type Slope_DSM.\n\nFor Input analysis mask, keep DSM.\n\nConfirm that Parameter type is set to Slope.\n\nThe other parameters, which determine how a slope is measured and calculated, do not need to be changed.\n\nClick Run.\n\nThe tool runs and the new raster layer is added to the map.\n\nEach cell in this layer contains a slope value ranging from 0 to 90 degrees. The lighter colors represent steeper slopes while darker colors represent milder slopes.\n\nCreate an aspect layer\n\nTo determine the rooftop orientation, you will create an aspect raster layer using the Surface Parameters tool.\n\nIn the Surface Parameters tool pane, enter the following parameters:\n\nFor Input surface raster, keep DSM.\n\nFor Output raster, type Aspect_DSM.\n\nFor Input analysis mask, keep DSM.\n\nFor Parameter type, choose Aspect.\n\nYou do not need to change the method by which the tool will calculate aspect.\n\nClick Run.\n\nThe tool runs and the new raster is added to the map.\n\nEach cell contains a value expressing orientation in degrees, with 0, 90, 180, and 270 representing absolute north, east, south, and west, respectively.\n\nRemove areas with high slopes\n\nNext, you will use your raster layers to find areas that meet the criteria for solar panels. First, you'll remove areas from your solar radiation raster layer that have a slope steeper than 45 degrees.\n\nAll of your raster layers use the same cell grid. Because of this, you can compare the values in the solar radiation and slope layers. You will create an expression in the Con tool that checks whether each slope value is less than or equal to 45.\n\nIf a cell's slope is steeper than 45 degrees, its value will be changed to NoData in the output layer. Otherwise, the cell will be given its corresponding solar radiation value. The result will be a solar radiation raster layer that does not include slopes steeper than 45 degrees.\n\nIn the Geoprocessing pane, click the Back button. Search for Con and open Con (Spatial Analyst Tools).\n\nIn the Con tool pane, for Input conditional raster, choose Slope_DSM.\n\nUnder Expression, build the expression Where VALUE is less than or equal to 45.\n\nThis expression will be applied to every cell in the slope raster. If a cell has a value less than or equal to 45, that cell is considered true. If not, the cell is considered false.\n\nNext, you will choose the raster layer that will provide the output cell values for cells found to be true. Ultimately, you want to compute the solar radiation potential of the rooftops, so you'll have the output layer use solar radiation cell values.\n\nFor Input true raster or constant value, choose Solar_Rad.\n\nFor the cell values found to be false, you have the option to choose a raster layer or set a constant value. However, you'll leave this parameter empty so that false cells are given the NoData value.\n\nFor Output raster, change the output name to Solar_Rad_S (S stands for Slope).\n\nClick Run.\n\nThe tool runs and the new raster is added to the map. Before you explore the new layer, you'll change its symbology to match your Solar_Rad raster layer.\n\nIn the Contents pane, click the Solar_Rad_S color ramp.\n\nThe Symbology pane appears.\n\nIn the Symbology pane, click the options button and choose Import from layer file.\n\nIn the Import symbology window, open the Folders and Solar_in_Glover folders. Double-click Solar_Rad.lyrx.\n\nThe new symbology is added to the layer. You'll now use the Swipe tool to compare how Solar_Rad_S and Solar_Rad differ.\n\nClose the Symbology pane.\n\nIn the Contents pane, uncheck the Aspect_DSM and Slope_DSM layers to turn them off.\n\nEnsure that the Solar_Rad and Solar_Rad_S layers are turned on. Click Solar_Rad to select it.\n\nOn the ribbon, on the Raster Layer tab, in the Compare group, click Swipe.\n\nZoom in to view buildings in more detail. Drag the Swipe pointer from top to bottom to peel off the Solar_Rad layer and see what areas have been removed in the Solar_Rad_S layer.\n\nThe removed rooftops areas are those that had slopes above 45 degrees.\n\nWhile swiping, to explore more areas, you can zoom out and zoom back in with the mouse wheel button. To pan, you can press the C key while dragging.\n\nReturn to the full extent of the neighborhood.\n\nSave the project.\n\nRemove areas with low solar radiation\n\nNext, you will consider the second criterion for suitable rooftops. Rooftop surfaces should receive at least 800 kWh/m2 in solar radiation, if solar panels are to be installed. You will use the Con tool on the Solar_Rad_S layer to remove any remaining areas with low solar radiation.\n\nThe Geoprocessing pane is already open to the Con tool.\n\nIn the Con tool pane, for Input conditional raster, choose Solar_Rad_S.\n\nUnder Expression, click Remove Clause to remove the previous expression.\n\nClick Add Clause and form a new expression that reads Where VALUE is greater than or equal to 800.\n\nFor Input true raster or constant value, choose Solar_Rad_S. For Output raster, change the output name to Solar_Rad_S_HS (HS stands for High Solar).\n\nClick Run.\n\nThe new raster layer is added to the map. You'll symbolize it the same way you symbolized the other solar radiation layers.\n\nIn the Contents pane, click the Solar_Rad_S_HS color ramp.\n\nIn the Symbology pane, click the options button and choose Import from layer file. In the Import Symbology window, browse to Solar_in_Glover and double-click Solar_Rad.lyrx.\n\nThe symbology is applied to the layer.\n\nClose the Symbology pane.\n\nIn the Contents pane, turn off the Solar_Rad layer.\n\nClick the Solar_Rad_S layer to select it.\n\nWith the Swipe tool, inspect how the Solar_Rad_S and Solar_Rad_S_HS differ.\n\nMore unsuitable areas have been removed. These areas received low solar radiation, making them undesirable for solar panels.\n\nReturn to the full extent of the neighborhood. Save the project.\n\nRemove areas that face north\n\nThe third criterion for suitable rooftops is that roof surfaces should not face north. In the northern hemisphere, surfaces facing north are likely to receive less solar radiation than surfaces facing other directions. (In the southern hemisphere, south-facing surfaces receive the least solar radiation.)\n\nMany north-facing roof surfaces were already removed when you removed areas with low solar radiation, but some remain. Based on the Aspect_DSM legend, slopes that face north have a value less than 22.5 degrees or more than 337.5 degrees. Additionally, you want to keep slopes that are almost flat, regardless of their aspect. If a roof is flat, its aspect does not matter for solar panels. You will consider that slopes of 10 degrees or less are flat or almost flat.\n\nTo fulfill both conditions, you'll use both Aspect_DSM and Slope_DSM. You'll run the Con tool twice, first to determine areas with low slopes and then to determine areas that face north.\n\nConfirm that the Geoprocessing pane is still open to the Con tool. For Input conditional raster, choose Slope_DSM.\n\nRemove the expression and add the new expression Where VALUE is less than or equal to 10.\n\nFor Input true raster or constant value, choose Solar_Rad_S_HS. For Output raster, change the output name to Solar_Rad_Low_Slope.\n\nClick Run.\n\nThe new raster layer is added to the map. You will run the Con tool a second time to determine north-facing surfaces.\n\nIn the Con tool pane, for Input condition raster, choose Aspect_DSM.\n\nNorth-facing slopes are slopes that have a value less than 22.5 or more than 337.5. Your expression will require two clauses to fulfill both of these conditions.\n\nRemove the expression and add the new expression Where VALUE is greater than 22.5.\n\nClick Add Clause. Create the expression And VALUE is less than 337.5.\n\nTogether, these clauses cover all surfaces that do not face north.\n\nYou will continue to use Solar_Rad_S_HS as the true raster, but you'll add the Solar_Rad_Low_Slope layer as the false raster. That way, false cells (those that face north) will be replaced by values from the low slope layer. The output layer will contain both areas that do not face north and areas with a low slope.\n\nContinue entering the following in the Con tool pane:\n\nFor Input true raster or constant value, confirm that Solar_Rad_S_HS is selected.\n\nFor Input false raster or constant value, choose Solar_Rad_Low_Slope.\n\nFor Output raster, type Solar_Rad_S_HS_NN (NN stands for No North).\n\nClick Run.\n\nThe new raster layer is added to the map. You will symbolize it the same way you have symbolized the other solar radiation layers.\n\nIn the Contents pane, click the Solar_Rad_S_HS_NN color ramp. In the Symbology pane, click the options button and choose Import from layer file.\n\nBrowse to the Solar_in_Glover folder and double-click Solar_Rad.lyrx.\n\nThe symbology is added to the raster layer.\n\nClose the Symbology pane.\n\nIn the Contents pane, turn off the Solar_Rad_Low_Slope and Solar_Rad_S layers. Select the Solar_Rad_S_HS layer.\n\nWith the Swipe tool, inspect how the Solar_Rad_S_HS and Solar_Rad_S_HS_NN differ.\n\nBecause many north-facing surfaces were removed previously when you removed areas with low solar radiation, the change between these layers is not so dramatic. However, some areas did get removed, and the Solar_Rad_S_HS_NN layer contains only roof surfaces suitable for solar panels.\n\nFor actual solar panel installation, it would be necessary to look at each rooftop in more detail, but for the purpose of your analysis, this approximation is sufficient.\n\nWhen you are done exploring, on the ribbon, on the Map tab, in the Navigate group, click Explore deactivate the Swipe tool.\n\nIn the Contents pane, turn off Solar_Rad_S_HS.\n\nFor clarity, you'll rename the Solar_Rad_S_HS_NN layer.\n\nIn the Contents pane, click Solar_Rad_S_HS_NN twice to edit it, type Suitable_Cells, and press Enter.\n\nReturn to the full extent of the neighborhood. Save the project.\n\nIn this module, you started from the initial solar radiation raster and removed all areas that are unsuitable for solar panels. You now have a suitable surface raster that you'll use to continue your analysis.\n\nCalculate power per building\n\nYour map shows how much solar radiation each suitable raster cell receives. In this module, you'll aggregate that data to determine how much solar radiation each building receives in a typical year. Then, you'll convert the solar radiation to electric power production potential and examine the results.\n\nAggregate cells by building\n\nFirst, for every building, you'll calculate the area covered by its suitable cells (in m2) and their average solar radiation (in kWh/m2). You'll do that using the Zonal Statistics as Table tool.\n\nIn the Contents pane, turn off the DSM and Hillshade_DSM layers. Turn on the Building_Footprints layer.\n\nThe Zonal Statistics as Table tool will look within each building footprint polygon and aggregate the suitable cells it contains.\n\nIf necessary, on the ribbon, on the Analysis tab, click Tools to open the Geoprocessing pane. If necessary, in the Geoprocessing pane, click the Back button.\n\nSearch for and open the Zonal Statistics as Table (Spatial Analyst Tools) tool.\n\nIn the Zonal Statistics as Table tool pane, choose the following parameter values:\n\nFor Input raster or feature zone data, choose Building_Footprints\n\nFor Zone field, confirm that Building_ID is chosen.\n\nFor Input value raster, choose Suitable_Cells.\n\nFor Output table, type Solar_Rad_Table.\n\nFor Statistics type, choose Mean.\n\nThe Building_ID field is a unique identifier for each building footprint. Using this field as the zone field will ensure that each building footprint is clearly identified.\n\nYou can choose to calculate several types of statistics. You'll calculate the Mean to determine the average solar radiation per square meter for each building.\n\nClick Run.\n\nThe tool runs and the new table is added to the bottom of the Contents pane, under Standalone Tables.\n\nTip:\n\nYour Contents pane contains many layers, so you may need to scroll down to see the table.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click Solar_Rad_Table and choose Open.\n\nThe table opens.\n\nReview the content of the table.\n\nEach row represents a building, uniquely identified by its Building_ID.\n\nCOUNT gives the number of suitable cells for that building.\n\nAREA gives the area covered by suitable cells (in m2).\n\nMEAN gives the average solar radiation (in kWh/m2) that these cells receive.\n\nBecause this table is stand-alone, it is not connected to the spatial data on your map. You'll join the fields of interest, AREA and MEAN, to the Building_Footprints layer using the Join Field tool. The matching field for this join will be Building_ID.\n\nClose the table.\n\nIn the Geoprocessing pane, click the Back button. Search for and open Join Field.\n\nIn the Join Field tool pane, choose the following values:\n\nFor Input Table, choose Building_Footprints.\n\nFor Input Field, choose Building_ID.\n\nFor Join Table, choose Solar_Rad_Table.\n\nFor Join Field, choose Building_ID.\n\nFor Transfer Fields, choose AREA.\n\nFor the second Transfer Fields drop-down list that appears, choose MEAN.\n\nClick Run.\n\nAfter a few moments, the process is completed.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click Building_Footprints and choose Attribute Table.\n\nThe AREA and MEAN fields have been added to the end of the table.\n\nClose the table.\n\nFind suitable buildings\n\nNow that you know the size of the suitable area on each building rooftop, you will apply one last criterion to determine solar panel suitability. You will consider that if a building has less than 30 square meters of suitable roof surface, it is generally not suitable for solar panel installation, as it is not worth the installation investment. You'll select buildings that have enough suitable roof surface using the Select Layer By Attributes tool.\n\nOn the ribbon, on the Map tab, in the Selection group, click Select By Attributes.\n\nIn the Select By Attributes window, for Input Rows, confirm that Building_Footprints is chosen. For Selection type, confirm that New selection is chosen.\n\nFor Expression, create the expression Where AREA is greater than or equal to 30.\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe selection is applied. Many buildings are selected but some are not.\n\nAt the bottom of the map, view the exact Selected Features number.\n\nYour number of buildings selected may be slightly different than on the example image.\n\nZoom in to view buildings in more detail.\n\nMany buildings that were not selected are particularly small (such as garden sheds). Others are larger but lack suitable surfaces for solar panels, possibly due to shade produced by nearby trees or other buildings.\n\nZoom out to return to the full extent of the neighborhood.\n\nYou'll export the selected buildings into a new feature class.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click Building_Footprints, point to Data, and choose Export Features.\n\nIn the Export Features window, for Input Features, confirm that Building_Footprints is selected. For Output Feature Class, type Suitable_Buildings.\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe feature class is created and added to the map. You no longer need the original building footprints layer or the solar radiation stand-alone table, so you'll remove them.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click Building_Footprints and choose Remove. Similarly, remove Solar_Rad_Table.\n\nSave the project.\n\nYou now have a map of all the suitable buildings, and for each building, the suitable area they contain and their mean solar radiation per square meter.\n\nCreate a field for solar radiation\n\nNext, you'll create a field in the Suitable_Buildings attribute table. This field will contain the total amount of solar radiation received per year by each building's usable area. You'll calculate this field by multiplying each building's suitable area by its average solar radiation per square meter. To avoid the numbers becoming too large, you'll also convert the solar radiation from kilowatt-hours to megawatt-hours by dividing by 1,000. The corresponding formula will be: (Area * Mean) / 1000.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click Suitable_Buildings and choose Attribute Table.\n\nOn the ribbon of the attribute table, click the Add Field button.\n\nThe Fields view appears. In this view, you can edit existing fields or add new ones.\n\nOn the bottom row of the Fields view, for Field Name, type Usable_SR_MWh. For Data Type, choose Double.\n\nThe Double data type is meant to store decimal numbers.\n\nYou'll have the field round all values to 2 decimal places.\n\nFor Number Format, double-click the empty cell and click the Determine display formatting for numeric and data field types button.\n\nThe Number Format window appears.\n\nIn the Number Format window, for Category, choose Numeric. Under Rounding, for Decimal places, type 2.\n\nClick OK.\n\nOn the ribbon, on the Fields tab, in the Manage Edits group, click Save.\n\nThe field is saved and added to the attribute table.\n\nClick the Suitable_Buildings tab to go back to the attribute table.\n\nCurrently, the values of the new field, Usable_SR_MWh, are all null.\n\nYou'll calculate values for the field based on the values in the AREA and MEAN fields.\n\nIn the attribute table, right-click the Usable_SR_MWh column name and choose Calculate Field.\n\nIn the Calculate Field tool, you'll create an expression with the formula delineated above.\n\nIn the Calculate Field window, for Usable_SR_MWh =, create or copy and paste the following expression:\n\n(!AREA! * !MEAN!) / 1000\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe tool runs and the field is calculated.\n\nThe results are expressed in megawatt-hours.\n\nClose the Fields view. Save the project.\n\nYou now have an estimate of how much solar radiation every building receives each year on surfaces suitable for solar panels.\n\nConvert solar radiation to power\n\nNext, you will convert the usable solar radiation values to electric power production potential. The amount of power that solar panels can produce depends not only on solar radiation, but also the solar panels' efficiency and the installation's performance ratio.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides a conservative best estimate of 16 percent efficiency and 86 percent performance ratio. These values mean that the solar panels are capable of converting 16 percent of incoming solar energy into electricity, and then 86 percent of that electricity is preserved as it goes through the installation.\n\nTo determine electric power production potential, you'll create a field and calculate it by multiplying your usable solar radiation values by the efficiency and performance ratio values. The corresponding formula will be: Usable_SR_MWh * 0.16 * 0.86.\n\nIn the attribute table, click the Add Field button.\n\nIn the Fields view, for the new field's Field Name text box, type Elec_Prod_MWh. For Data Type, choose Double.\n\nFor Number Format, double-click the empty cell and click the Determine display formatting for numeric and data field types button.\n\nIn the Number Format window, for Category, choose Numeric. Under Rounding, for Decimal places, type 2.\n\nClick OK.\n\nOn the ribbon, on the Fields tab, in the Manage Edits group, click Save.\n\nClick the Suitable_Buildings tab to go back to the attribute table.\n\nThe new field is added to the attribute table. Its values are null. Next, you'll calculate the field values.\n\nIn the attribute table, right-click the Elec_Prod_MWh column name and choose Calculate Field.\n\nIn the Calculate Field window, for Elec_Prod_MWh =, create or copy and paste the following expression:\n\n!Usable_SR_MWh! * 0.16 * 0.86\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe tool runs and the field is calculated.\n\nClose the attribute table and the Fields view.\n\nSave the project.\n\nSymbolize the data\n\nYour analysis is complete. Before you explore the results, you'll symbolize the layer based on the field you created. You will also add a basemap for context.\n\nIn the Contents pane, click the symbol for the Suitable_Buildings layer.\n\nThe Symbology pane appears.\n\nIf necessary, on the Symbology pane, click the Back button to go to the Primary symbology tab.\n\nIn the Primary symbology tab, click the options button and choose Import symbology.\n\nThe Geoprocessing pane appears, displaying the Apply Symbology From Layer tool.\n\nIn the Apply Symbology From Layer tool, for Symbology Layer, click the Browse button.\n\nIn the Symbology Layer window, browse to the Solar_in_Glover folder and double-click Suitable_Buildings.lyrx.\n\nLeave the other parameters unchanged and click Run.\n\nThe layer symbology is updated.\n\nIn the Contents pane, turn off all the layers except Suitable_Buildings.\n\nTip:\n\nTo turn off all layers, hold Ctrl and click one of the layer boxes.\n\nOn the ribbon, on the Map tab, in the Layer group, click Basemap. Choose Dark Gray Canvas.\n\nThe basemap is added to the map.\n\nExplore the final map.\n\nLarger buildings tend to have higher electric power production potential than single-unit dwellings. This pattern makes sense because larger buildings have larger roof surfaces. However, larger buildings also have higher electric power needs.\n\nIn 2021, the average household in the United States consumes 12.154 MWh per year. Could many households in the Glover Park neighborhood cover most or all their electric power needs with solar panels?\n\nYou can also check the total amount of power that could be produced by the neighborhood.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click Suitable_Buildings and choose Attribute Table.\n\nIn the attribute table, right-click the Elec_Prod_MWh column name and choose Visualize Statistics.\n\nA chart opens, showing the distribution of the field values as a bar chart, as well as a Chart Properties pane. The pane contains statistics, including the sum of electric power production potential for all buildings.\n\nIn the Chart Properties pane, under Statistics, identify the Sum row.\n\nYour statistics may differ slightly from the example image.\n\nThe entire neighborhood has the potential to produce over 20,000 MWh.\n\nClose the Chart Properties pane, the chart, and the attribute table. Save the project.\n\nIn this tutorial, you accomplished your goal and determined the solar power potential of the Glover Park neighborhood in Washington, D.C. To do so, you used a DSM to create a solar radiation raster layer, as well as slope and aspect raster layers. Then, you identified suitable rooftops for solar panels and calculated how much power these rooftops could generate.\n\nYour results represent a yearly average estimate. However, solar-based electric power production varies according to the season, as day length and hours of sunlight change. You could also perform this tutorial's workflow for specific days of the year, such as the winter and summer solstices and the fall and spring equinoxes, to determine the highest, lowest, and medium solar power production values.\n\nYou can replicate this workflow for any community, as long as you have building footprints and a DSM. Many communities provide open GIS data. The data for this tutorial was acquired from the Open Data DC website.\n\nYou can find more tutorials such as this on the Introduction to Imagery & Remote Sensing page."
