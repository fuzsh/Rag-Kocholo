        "text": "Page Content\n\nANNAPOLIS, MD – Governor Wes Moore today announced that the Maryland Energy Administration is awarding $6 million for new projects through the Solar Energy Equity Program. The awards will help increase access to clean, renewable energy for Marylanders who are experiencing low to moderate income and who live in underserved or overburdened communities.\n\n“Maryland is leading the way in the transition to clean energy, and we will leave no one behind. We are excited to work alongside all of our partners to invest in communities with the greatest need throughout our state,” said Gov. Moore. “These awards will generate new jobs, help families save money, and set Maryland on track to meet our clean energy goals. It isn’t enough for Marylanders to see themselves in the consequences of climate inaction, they must also see themselves in the progress – and that’s what this partnership is about.”\n\nSolar Energy Equity Program grants provide up to $25,000 per qualified household for repairs and solar installations. Participating homes must receive an energy audit and significant energy efficiency upgrades. The awards are administered through non-profit organizations that engage contractors to install solar arrays free of charge, including:\n\nBuilding Change, Inc\n\nBuilding Change is a non-profit organization in Prince George’s County whose mission is to advance consumer empowerment through advocacy, thought leadership, education and developing technological solutions to promote and finance healthy living, the built environment, community development and sustainable construction practices. The organization will receive a $2 million grant.\n\nCivic Works, Inc.\n\nCivic Works operates education, community improvement and energy conservation programs. As a long-time recipient of Maryland Energy Administration grant funding, Civic Works has developed an extensive network of Maryland customers who experience income-related challenges and have previously received energy audits, weatherization and energy efficiency services. The organization will receive a $2.45 million grant.\n\nCommunity Action Council of Howard County, Maryland, Inc.\n\nCommunity Action Council of Howard County is a not-for-profit community action agency whose activities benefit numerous clients experiencing income-related challenges. In addition to being a longstanding recipient of Maryland Energy Administration grants, the organization has received several grants on behalf of local, state and federal governments to drive their mission, including Head Start, energy assistance, housing assistance, food assistance and weatherization programs. The organization will receive a $1.25 million grant.\n\nGreen and Healthy Homes Initiative, Inc.\n\nThe Green and Healthy Homes Initiative is dedicated to addressing the social determinants of health and the advancement of racial and health equity through the creation of healthy, safe and energy efficient homes. It has proposed to integrate Maryland Energy Administration renewable energy funding with other funding sources to identify and install solar on income-challenged homes. The organization will receive a $300,000 grant.\n\n“The Solar Energy Equity Program works through trusted partners to reach Maryland homeowners who would otherwise be left behind in the push for cleaner energy simply because they couldn’t afford to upgrade their properties,” said Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul G. Pinsky. “Not only does this program help move more Maryland communities toward cleaner energy, it also provides for home repairs to make solar installations possible, removing a common barrier to the adoption of clean energy. For those looking for proof that Maryland is serious about leaving no one behind on the path to progress, the Solar Energy Equity Program provides clear evidence of our unflagging commitment.”\n\n###​"
