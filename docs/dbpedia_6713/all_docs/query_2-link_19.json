        "text": "How to become a renewable energy technician\n\nSolar energy systems engineers require a bachelorâ€™s degree, including coursework within engineering and technology, physics, mathematics, building and construction, and design. Technological skills that are important for a solar energy systems engineer are analytical or scientific software, computer-aided design (CAD) software, development environment software, object or component-oriented development software, and presentation software.\n\nWind turbine service technicians require post-secondary certificates in wind energy technology. Wind technology coursework includes maintenance instruction for electrical and hydraulic systems, braking and mechanical systems, and programmable logic control systems. When starting a job, on-site job training is typically required. Wind turbine service technicians can receive different certifications to demonstrate their knowledge, such as electrical safety and tower climbing. Important technological skills for this job include enterprise resource planning ERP software, industrial control software, presentation software, and spreadsheet software.\n\nJobs that work with solar engineers\n\nEnergy engineers\n\nSolar energy installation managers\n\nSolar sales representatives and assessors\n\nSolar thermal installers and technicians\n\nWind energy engineers\n\nCode and permitting officials\n\nClean energy commissioning agent\n\nPathways to solar engineers\n\nEngineering with environmental fieldwork\n\nElectrical or mechanical engineering with environmental or solar field experience\n\nSolar project manager or developer\n\nPV system designer or electrical designer\n\nPV construction supervisor\n\nSolar installer or installation site supervisor\n\nJobs that work with wind technicians\n\nGeothermal technicians\n\nHydroelectric plant technicians\n\nPower plant operators\n\nStationary engineers and boiler operators\n\nUtility technicians\n\nWind energy operations managers\n\nWind energy site developers\n\nWind energy engineers\n\nCode and permitting officials\n\nClean energy commissioning agent\n\nPathways to wind technicians\n\nLand acquisition associate\n\nPower market analyst\n\nPower systems/transmission engineer\n\nSurvey/mapping technician\n\nWind resource analyst\n\nOSHA-10 and fieldwork experience\n\nRole on a LEED project\n\nLEED is the most widely used green building rating system in the world. Available for virtually all building types, LEED provides a framework for healthy, highly-efficient, and cost-saving green buildings. LEED certification is a globally recognized symbol of sustainability achievement and leadership.\n\nRenewable energy technicians and engineers support renewable energy and green power goals of individual projects, utilities and governments. They may work on-site with project teams to assess the potential for on-site generation or the use of alternative green power, such as off-site generation or renewable energy certificates (RECs). Beyond a project team, renewable energy technicians and engineers support a low-carbon power grid, helping to meet government sustainability goals and supporting the ability of individual green buildings and projects to procure renewable energy. Renewable energy technicians will have the most impact on energy and atmosphere credits in LEED."
