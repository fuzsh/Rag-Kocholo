        "text": "Georgia Power's Community Solar program costs $24.00 per 1 kilowatt (kW) block per month for eligible residential customers, and $25.00 per 1 kW block/per month. You are eligible for one block, regardless of your monthly usage. If you would like to purchase more than one block, your individual allocation will be calculated based on your energy usage for the 12 months prior to enrollment. There is a maximum of 10 blocks per customer.\n\nAny residential customer on the standard residential service rate and small business customer on the general service (GS) rate, located in the Georgia Power service territory may apply to participate in the program. If you are a participating Community Solar customer and you move within the Georgia Power service territory, you can continue to participate in the Community Solar program without losing your subscription.\n\nThe Community Solar program is designed to offer customers who cannot install solar at their premises an opportunity to participate in the continued development of renewable energy. The Community Solar program costs $24.00 for residential customers and $25.00 for eligible small business customers, per 1 kW block per month. This program charge helps capture the full value of benefits received by program participants.\n\nThe monthly charge was also designed specifically so that Georgia Power is neutral (i.e. no harm or benefit) and so that non-participating customers are not subsidizing the program for those participating in Community Solar. Georgia Power's Community Solar program pricing is competitive with other community solar programs throughout our state.\n\nThe monthly production of a 1 kW subscription block is estimated to be in the range of 115â€“ 215 kilowatt-hours (kWh), with the average monthly production estimated to be 165 kWh. Note that solar production can vary due to the sun's angle, time of year, the number of cloudy days in the month, and other factors.\n\nYou should expect that the Community Solar charge to participate in the program may exceed any bill credits received from solar production. The program is designed to allow you to support solar through your monthly subscription, and is not intended to result in energy savings.\n\nBy enrolling in Community Solar, you get the benefit of receiving a pro-rata share of the energy produced from the portfolio of farms. We are unable to predict how much solar energy will be produced at any given time by the Community Solar farms.\n\nYour Georgia Power bill will include a line item showing your monthly subscription fee and your pro-rata share of the farms' solar generation (in kWh) during the month, which will offset your electric consumption based on your number of Community Solar subscription blocks. Please note that your bill will still include charges for your remaining monthly energy usage, according to your existing rate, including any applicable taxes, franchise fees or environmental costs.\n\nFor more information, please email us at g2gpccsolar@southernco.com.\n\nYou may enroll in an initial 12-month subscription, which automatically renews on a month-to-month basis unless canceled. You may cancel at any time but are required to provide 30 days' notice to Georgia Power. There are no termination fees. However, you must wait 12 months after cancellation before becoming eligible to rejoin the program."
