        "text": "Getting Started with Solar\n\nWelcome to Wise County’s solar resource webpage. Wise County is seeking ways to encourage solar energy development in our community. This webpage represents a collection of solar information and resources for the community. Our community’s solar commitment and goals can be found below. For more information about the basics of solar energy, your solar options, and questions to ask solar professionals, read the Residential Consumer Guide to Solar Power and visit the Department of Energy’s Homeowner’s Guide to Going Solar.\n\nOur Solar Goals\n\nWise County will leverage SolSmart to achieve the following goals:\n\nDevelop and execute a community solar program.\n\nDevelop and continue a streamlined process for solar permitting or inspections.\n\nMarket our community as a solar friendly locality and advocate for the increase investment of solar infrastructure and technology.\n\nEducate ourselves and prepare our community for utility scale solar opportunities.\n\nOur Solar Commitment\n\nThe Wise County Board of Supervisors and Wise County Building & Zoning Department is committed to exceptional customer services as it relates to solar processes. To promote the continued advancement of solar in our community we are committed to the following:\n\nSmall Rooftop or Ground Mounted Solar Photovoltaic Permit Process Commitment\n\nProviding clear guidelines about the solar permitting and inspection process.\n\nA Building Permit application consisting of an Electrical and Mechanical Permit fee is the only application required to be submitted for Ground Mounted or Rooftop Photovoltaic (PV) Systems.\n\nAfter review and approval of the submitted application, you will be notified that the permit is ready to be issued.\n\nContractors that are applying for Photovoltaic systems installation must have the AES designation on the Department of Professional Occupation Regulation (DPOR) license.\n\nReview time of the application and construction documents will not exceed 3 days.\n\nNo more than 2 inspections required for a rooftop solar array.\n\nWe offer an inspection appointment time for solar (as opposed to an appointment window). Contact the Building & Zoning Department to schedule your appointment time.\n\nSolar PV inspections will be completed within 5 days of the inspection request. View our inspection checklist here.\n\nThe permit fees for small rooftop or ground mounted solar PV is $51.\n\nYou may stop by the Office of Building and Zoning in the Wise County Courthouse and pay for the permit or send payment by mail and have the permit mailed or emailed to you.\n\nCommercial Solar Photovoltaic Permit Process Commitment\n\nA Building Permit application is the only application required to be submitted for Commercial Solar Photovoltaic (PV) System.\n\nSubmittal of the completed building permit application, drawings and calculations of the proposed system will initiate the process in which a permit will be issued.\n\nContractors that are applying for Photovoltaic systems installation must have the AES designation on the DPOR license.\n\nReview time of the application and construction documents will not exceed 1 week.\n\nAfter review and approval of the submitted application, you will be notified that the permit is ready to be issued.\n\nThe flat rate permit fee for commercial applications of solar PV systems are:\n\n5 kilowatts or less: $150\n\n5 to 10 kilowatts: $200\n\n10 to 15 kilowatts: $250\n\n15 kilowatts and up: $300\n\n1 to 5 megawatts : $500\n\n5 to 10 megawatts : $750\n\n10 megawatts and up : $1,000\n\nYou may stop by the Office of Building and Zoning in the Wise County Courthouse and pay for the permit or send payment by mail and have the permit mailed or emailed to you.\n\nSolar Benefits\n\nSolar energy uses a renewable energy source – the sun – and provides many benefits for individuals and the community. It improves environmental quality by reducing carbon emissions and air pollution, supports local solar companies in Virginia, saves money on energy costs as the price continues to drop from technological developments, and improves electric grid resilience during peak demand and other stresses to the system.\n\nSolar Maps and Potential\n\nInvestigate your property’s solar potential by clicking here. You can also estimate the performance of potential PV projects using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s PVWatts Calculator.\n\nClick HERE for a map of solar installations in Wise County. Select “Solar Installations” under the “Utilities” map layer.\n\nFinding a Contractor and Going Solar\n\nFind a solar contractor (or two) to assess your home for solar energy and provide a quote.\n\nCertified practitioners can be found through NABCEP.\n\nVisit EnergySage to learn about solar energy and submit for solar quotes from a network of pre-screened, local solar installers\n\nConsumer Solar Checklist – a checklist for residential consumers considering solar energy from IREC, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.\n\nClean Energy Consumer Bill of Rights – ensure a positive consumer experience by addressing important issues from IREC, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.\n\nSolar Customer Resource Portal – various resources from SEIA, the Solar Energy Industries Association.\n\nFind Energy - Facts, Figures, and Frequently Answered Questions about solar energy in Virginia.\n\nFinancing, Incentives, and Tax Exemptions\n\nTypically solar installations are paid for through loans or cash, with Federal and State incentives available.\n\nA Homeowner’s Guide to Solar Financing – learn about different financing options from CESA, the Clean Energy States Alliance.\n\nJob Training and Educational Opportunities\n\nIf you are interested in pursuing a career in solar energy, here are some links to regional and national educational courses, programs, and/or trainings offered from colleges, universities, technical institutions, and non-profits.\n\nThe Solar Foundation’s Solar Training Network (Career Connections, Education & Workforce Partnerships)."
