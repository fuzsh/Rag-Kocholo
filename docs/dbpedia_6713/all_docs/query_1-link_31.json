        "text": "I have a few different solar panels- 2 x 100w flexible panels, 2x200w panels and 1x50w panel. None are the same brand, but I think all are mono panels. Next, I have 2 older 73ah deep cycle gel batteries, 2 newer 85ah marine/dual batteries (came with an RV I bought) and 1 new LifePo4 100ah battery. I've got a bougerv 20a charge controller for the Lifepo4 battery and some cheapie charge controllers from amazon for the others.\n\nI'm headed out to the Nevada desert in a few weeks with my old 5th wheel and want to run a Blizzard 12v compressor refrigerator, maybe a BougeRV 23 quart fridge as well as the led lights, heater (at night) and propane fridge in the RV. The Blizzard uses 55w when cycling on and the Bouge uses 60w.\n\nIn past years I used a 100w panel and the 73ah deep cycle gel batteries for the RV and often I ran into random electrical issues that I suspect were caused by not enough solar or battery.\n\nI might buy a used 300w solar panel ($100) to bring, but it's pretty big and difficult to pack.\n\nAny suggestions on the best usage of my gear? I'm thinking of using the 200w panel with the LIfepo4 100a battery as a stand alone. Then using the other 200w panel along with the gel batteries for the RV, lights, heater, propane fridge, etc. Can I connect the 200w with one or more 50 or 100w panel, and if so, should I link them in series or parallel?\n\nThanks for any input!\n\n*When mismatching panels within a single string it is most important to match panels by IMP maximum power currant \"amps\" you only push as many \"amps\" as your lowest IMP rated panel.Add all of the panels VMP voltages regardless of value to = the string VMP voltage\n\n*When mismatching panels in parallel strings it is most important to match the VMP maximum power voltage of each string as close as possible. Preferably less than 3%, the lower VMP combined voltage string will under deliver on its rated IMP \"amps\".\n\n*As long as VMP combined voltages are of the same value IMP amps will be additive respectively. Example string 1 IMP 10.3a, string 2 IMP 8.2a string 3 IMP 9.5a paralleled IMP will be 28amps respectively.\n\nExample 2:\n\n10 x Mission solar VMP 38.1 IMP 8.54\n\n12 x NE solar VMP 31.7 IMP 8.69\n\ncombined in optimal conditions IMP 17.23 \"amps\"\n\ns-1 10×38.1v=381v\n\ns-2 12×31.7v=380.4v\n\nAnd parallel s-1 and s-2 = 99.47% efficiency by my calculations of course one panels low light efficiency may exceed the others"
