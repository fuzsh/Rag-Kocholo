Here are just a few of the reasons to feel good about a solar career.\n\nSolar energy …\n\nBest States for Solar\n\nClick on any state to learn more about solar in that area:\n\nSolar jobs exist in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and, according to The Solar Foundation, solar jobs should see 14.7 percent growth in 2016. However, the top six solar states account for more than 50 percent of the employment growth.\n\nCalifornia remains the solar leader, having installed more solar in 2014 than the entire country did from 1997 to 2011, according to the SEIA. California boasts a number of solar-friendly policies, including tax incentives and rebates. California and other top solar states also owe some of their strength to financing policies that include third-party ownership for solar energy systems. These policies have enabled financing of more than half of the residential projects in states like Arizona, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.\n\nCalifornia, Florida, Texas and Arizona with their sunny weather make the list of the best states for solar jobs. However, because solar is effective energy across North America, some surprising states round out the Top 10. In 2014, Massachusetts moved up to the No. 2 position, based on state solar policies, electricity costs and incentives and rebates, and held that spot for 2016.\n\nWhile Nevada had been experiencing dramatic growth in solar jobs, policy decisions in early 2016 are expected to negatively impact solar job growth expectations for the year.\n\nMap Your Solar Career\n\nYou know that solar is the career of the future, but you hardly know where to begin. Don’t worry: With hundreds of thousands of Americans at work in solar jobs and strong industry growth, there’s bound to be a job for you, too.\n\nA few factors driving the surge in solar careers include:\n\nSolar offers a wide range of career options, whether you have a high school diploma or want to seek a master’s degree.

Master’s or doctorate in applied physics, chemistry or materials science is becoming expected.\n\nSolar Career Salaries\n\nSolar salaries are comparable to other industries and in some cases can be 10 or 20 percent more. In general, solar employment has added nearly 100,000 living-wage jobs in the U.S. in the past five years.\n\nSalaries can vary depending upon the location and scope of the project. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Interstate Renewable Energy Council, here are the average salaries of certain solar jobs:\n\nGet Solar Certified: Credentialing Bodies\n\nCertification can be beneficial not only for workers, but also for employers and consumers. Across the nation, about 75 percent of employers reported some difficulty finding qualified job candidates in the solar industry.\n\nCertification offers potential employees a way to be recognized and stand out from the pack. “It’s a tool for employers looking to hire people,” Lawrence said.\n\nA certification lets employers know that the job candidate completed additional work for his or her field. In addition, certification can help workers by giving them more mobility to move between states and move to where the jobs are.\n\nFor many jobs in the solar industry, certification is voluntary. However, Lawrence of NABCEP recommends certification for nearly every position, including sales and marketing. “It’s a good starting point … to understand the fundamentals of solar,” he said.\n\nThe nonprofit NABCEP is the primary body for certification in the solar industry. Available certifications include the PV Installation Professional, PV Technical Sales and Solar Heating. NABCEP also offers accreditation for companies that meet standards developed by the Institute for Sustainable Power Quality (ISPQ).\n\nTo become certified, most candidates complete an accredited program, and then apply to take the appropriate certification exam. Exams are typically offered a few times each year and application deadlines typically fall two to three months before the scheduled exam. Applicants will need to factor exam times into their career map.\n\nFor consumers, certification lets them know that solar professionals have achieved a certain standard of training.\n\nIn addition to NABCEP, other credentialing bodies specific to solar include:\n\nAssociation of Energy Engineers (AEE)\n\nThe nonprofit society, founded in 1977, offers several professional certifications, including Certified Energy Manager, Certified Energy Auditor, Certified Sustainable Development Professional, Certified Building Commissioning Professional and Certified Power Quality Professional. The certifications are post-secondary training and some are master’s level.\n\nRoof Integrated Solar Energy (RISE)\n\nThe nonprofit was created by the Center for Environmental Innovation in Roofing and National Roofing Contractors Association to both support rooftop solar energy and evaluate solar roofing professionals. The certification is based on the goal of using solar while maintaining the roof and not affecting the life of the roof.\n\nUL Knowledge Services\n\nCertifications offered by UL Knowledge Services include PV System installer, which is open to qualified electricians, and Certified Risk Professional, which trains candidates to recognize certain property-related risks.\n\nState Requirements for Solar Licensing\n\nNo single solar licensure exists for the entire U.S. Each state establishes its own requirements for solar workers as well as reciprocity with other states. What you need legally to work in the solar industry varies by state.\n\nLicensure is mandatory for certain jobs and practices in various industries. States set up licensing requirements to protect consumers from unsafe practices and establish a baseline level of quality. The license essentially grants permission to an individual to work in a certain occupation with a certain degree of competency. If the individual does not have the license, he or she cannot work in that job. Legislatures pass the licensing laws, which are carried out by government agencies.\n\nIn the solar industry, licensing requirements began in the 1980s for solar contractors. A dozen states and Puerto Rico require licensure for solar contractors. In most states, licensed plumbers and electricians do not need a specialized solar license to work on a solar project.\n\nLawrence recommends newcomers to the solar industry enroll in an entry-level certification program. After taking a course, “they know the terminology, they know the basics,” Lawrence said.\n\nAbout 200 solar-specific training programs, including those in community colleges, are registered with NABCEP.\n\nMany states offer reciprocity with other states, meaning that they will accept the licenses from those states. Several states, however, including Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico and the District of Columbia, do not offer reciprocity, so workers will need to get new licenses in those areas.\n\nFind out the solar licensing requirements in your state at the IREC Solar Licensing Database\n\nBrighten Your Solar Future\n\nHigher Education Can Take Your Career Further\n\nAs Lawrence points out, the solar industry is more than hard hats. Today, many universities and colleges across the U.S. offer two- and four-year degree programs in alternative and renewable energy. Programs also are reaching out to Spanish-speaking communities as well as veterans of the U.S. military.\n\nBefore deciding on a program of study, human resource officers advise investing time into researching careers and developing a career objective. In the solar industry, there isn’t a single career path but rather multiple ways of reaching a career goal. Prospective job candidates can follow a traditional, formal education path at a college or university or can look into trade programs, apprenticeships, technical schools or training provided by nonprofit entities such as Solar Energy International.\n\nResearch which jobs are growing, the necessary qualifications and which job would be most fulfilling. To find out what is going on in solar, attend local and national conferences or seminars and subscribe to industry publications.\n\nMany students will find that the skills they already have will transfer to the solar industry. Others, such as engineers, installers and any management positions, will need more solar-specific study, including hands-on work as needed. Deciding between a short training program and a multi-year degree program comes down to the type of position you’re seeking. Installers will do well with a training program or associate degree, but engineers will need at least a four-year degree.\n\nMany solar programs in the United States fall under the category of renewable or sustainable energy, alternative energy or green programs. Students can then choose to add an emphasis on solar.\n\nMany community, technical and state colleges are offering a wide variety of programs, including solar photovoltaic, energy efficiency and conservation, and renewable energy. To select a good technical program, look for one that offers:\n\nNABCEP-accredited program with NABCEP-certified instructors.\n\nHands-on training, such as the outdoor lab program at Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno, Nev.\n\nOSHA safety training, such as that involved in the American River College program in Sacramento.\n\nA review class to help prepare you for the NABCEP exam.\n\nMany four-year degrees are interdisciplinary programs, which involve multiple departments. Degrees that could give you a good start on a green career include biology, environmental engineering, conservation, renewable energy management, urban planning and business management.\n\nIREC, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, provides a list of training programs throughout the U.S. Find the list here.\n\nTraining for Solar Jobs Online\n\nOnline education has emerged as a popular higher-education alternative.\n\nTaking courses online allows students to continue with their current jobs and responsibilities while gaining new credentials for their resume. Online courses can be less costly than traditional university courses and they can be completed at home at the student’s convenience with a more flexible schedule. Online training also can translate into new computer-based skills, such as creating and sharing documents and using audio and visual materials in assignments.\n\nOnline courses in solar are available from the basics – such as a free six-week Introduction to Renewable Energy course offered by Solar Energy International – to 12-credit master’s level certificates, such as those offered by the University of Nevada Reno and Penn State.\n\nLawrence supports the use of online courses in furthering solar education. He adds a note of caution, however:\n\nCosts of courses tend to run from about $800 for a six-week course to a master’s level course at about $1,500. Courses at private universities will tend to cost more and will include tuition as well as credit hours.\n\nEcotech Institute\n\nAssociate degrees also are available. Ecotech Institute, for example, offers several associate-level degrees in renewable energy, including an Associate of Applied Science in Solar Energy Technology. The first two semesters are available online.\n\nAn array of PV installer courses are available online. These PV installer courses typically cover the components and applications for PV systems as well as site analysis, array configurations and other aspects of grid-direct PV systems. Look for courses that include online as well as hands-on training, both theory and practical applications with labs, eligibility to take the NABCEP exam and, if possible, have exam fees included in the cost of the course.\n\nIn addition, if you’re taking a technical course online, make sure you have the requisite background in construction, engineering or roofing."
