        "text": "“I believe that a clean energy future is within our grasp, but it will take all of us and the best available science to make it happen.”\n\n—Secretary Deb Haaland\n\nFrom coastal towns and rural farms, to urban centers and Tribal communities, climate change poses an existential threat — not just to our environment, but to our health, our communities, and our economic well-being. At the Department of the Interior, we know that the time to act on climate is now.\n\nRenewable energy — including solar, onshore and offshore wind, geothermal, and wave and tidal energy projects — will help communities across the country be part of the climate solution while creating good-paying union jobs.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration is taking an all-of-government approach toward its ambitious renewable energy goals that will create jobs to support families, boost local economies, and help address environmental injustice.\n\nAs directed by President Biden’s Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, the Interior Department has partnered with other federal agencies to increase renewable energy production on public lands and waters —including a commitment to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030, 15 gigawatts of floating offshore wind by 2035, and a target goal of permitting at least 25 gigawatts of onshore renewable energy by 2025.\n\nTo facilitate this transition to clean energy and meet our ambitious goals, the Department has announced a new five-year offshore wind leasing schedule, which includes up to 12 potential offshore wind energy lease sales through 2028. This strategy provides two crucial ingredients for success: more certainty for industry, and transparency for our stakeholders and ocean users.\n\nSince the start of the Biden-Harris administration, the Department has approved the nation's first nine commercial scale offshore wind projects, held four offshore wind lease auctions – including a record-breaking sale offshore New York and the first-ever sales offshore the Pacific and Gulf Coasts, and advanced the process to establish additional Wind Energy Areas in Oregon, Gulf of Maine and the Central Atlantic. The Department has also taken steps to grow a sustainable offshore wind industry by encouraging the use of project labor agreements, strengthening workforce training, bolstering a domestic supply chain, and through enhanced engagement with Tribes, fisheries, underserved communities and ocean users.\n\nOnshore, the Biden-Harris administration is making significant progress to further promote responsible renewable energy development on public lands. In April 2024, the Department announced it has permitted more than 25 gigawatts of clean energy projects – surpassing a major milestone ahead of 2025 – enough clean energy to power more than 12 million homes across the country. This includes solar, wind and geothermal projects, as well as gen-tie lines on public lands that are essential for connecting clean electricity projects on both federal and non-federal land to the grid.\n\nThe Department is also expanding solar energy production in more Western states and making renewable energy siting and permitting on America’s public lands more efficient by updating its Western Solar Plan. By directing development to areas that have fewer sensitive resources, less conflict with other uses of public lands, and close proximity to transmission lines, the BLM can permit clean energy more efficiently while maintaining robust public and Tribal engagement, which are central features of all BLM reviews of individual projects.\n\nThe demand for renewable energy has never been greater. The technological advances, increased interest, cost effectiveness, and tremendous economic potential make these projects a promising path for diversifying our national energy portfolio while at the same time combatting climate change and investing in communities.\n\nAt every step of the way, the Interior Department will undertake these goals with broad engagement, including fishermen, outdoor enthusiasts, sovereign Tribal nations, states, territories, local officials, agricultural and forest landowners, and others to identify strategies and goals that reflect the priorities of all communities.\n\nResources:"
