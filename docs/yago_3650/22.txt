George Stephanopoulos - hipster? The Good Morning America anchor and his wife, Alexandra Wentworth, are taking a well-deserved vacation in Italy and that gave the hard-charging journalist the time to relax and ditch his razor.

Author and actress Wentworth posted a picture on Twitter of her and her politics-loving hubby snuggling with the caption 'Italy! #Romance'

Alexandra didn't let everyone know how she felt about the new vacation scruff.

Fans, however, seem to be enjoying it.

'I love seeing @GStephanopoulos so relaxed and scruffy! It lets the world know he can be chill! You two are precious...enjoy!' wrote one woman on Twitter.

Judging by Ali's Twitter feed, the romantic pair, who have been married for 16 years, are in idyllic Positano on the Amalfi Coast.

George has certainly earned his time in the sun. He has been relentlessly covering the election campaigns for GMA and Sunday Morning This Week and may still need some recovery time from when he confronted Donald Trump about not releasing his tax returns in May.

The couple, who seem as happily married today as the day they tied the knot, have two children, Elliott and Harper.
