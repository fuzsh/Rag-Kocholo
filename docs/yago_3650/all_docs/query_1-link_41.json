Because they're like rabbits, and once she says so, \"the women gasp and scream like I've confessed that I shot my dog,\" Ali writes. \"One of them always slams her fist down on the table; a woman's wine glass once smashed in her hand. I'm sorry! We're hot for each other. Jesus!\"\n\nAli and George tied the knot 17 years ago, and it's certainly evident that the fire is still burning!\n\nThe couple has two daughters, Elliott and Harper, who probably did not want to know how often their parents are getting it on.\n\nSee the family together in the gallery above and shop her book below!"
