        "text": "Actress Ali Wentworth—who’s married to ABC’s George Stephanopoulos—dished about pets, her husband, and her friend Alec Baldwin on HuffPost Live Friday.\n\nWentworth, who is active in the Humane Society Animal Rescue program, talked about the animals she’s rescued, joking about her biggest rescue yet: her husband.\n\n“I rescued my husband, George Stephanopoulos from a lifetime of singledom.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also expressed sympathy for Baldwin, who’s under fire for comments he made while shouting at a videographer Thursday. His MSNBC show has been suspended two weeks over the incident.\n\n“I think he’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever met,” says Wentworth. “I think he’s incredibly charming. I think he’s incredibly talented. I’ve been watching all this stalker stuff—crazy as a loon. I do feel for him because I think he gets taunted a lot by the press.”\n\nWATCH:"
