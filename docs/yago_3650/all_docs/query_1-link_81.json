        "text": "Power couple George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth have relisted their summer home in Southampton, NY, for $6 million. That’s nearly $1 million less than the 2016 listing price.\n\nStephanopoulos and Wentworth both had notable careers before they married in 2001, only months after meeting on a blind date. He was communications director for the Clinton White House, and she was a comedian with roles in shows including “In Living Color” and “Felicity.”\n\nFast-forward more than a decade later, and the couple have two daughters, Elliot and Harper; Stephanopoulos has risen to the top of ABC News, hosting both “Good Morning America” and “The Week,” while Wentworth continues to land roles and write books.\n\nBut the family have grown tired of their luscious summer home and have priced it to sell.\n\nThe traditional-style home has five bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms. It sits on a 1.47-acre lot featuring manicured grounds and plenty of privacy.\n\nThe home has a few whimsical splashes of color and is “regularly the site of the kind of dinner parties that make the Hamptons … the Hamptons,” the listing notes.\n\nThe shingle-style home offers bright and cozy interiors with special touches such as the two-story living room with coffered ceiling; media room; 1,000-bottle wine cellar; game room; gym; and guest room with built-in bunk beds.\n\nOutdoors, the veranda overlooks the pool and sunken tennis court. The home is located just minutes from beaches and Southampton Village.\n\nThe couple purchased the home in 2013 for $4.5 million."
