        "text": "Before they were married, one wouldn't have ever imagined pairing comedian and actress Ali Wentworth with George Stephanopoulos, the Good Morning America anchor and former advisor to President Clinton. But it didn't take the couple long to realize how perfect they were for each other, despite their differences. Here's how they got together.\n\nDespite growing up in a political family, Wentworth had no interest in dating someone with a political background. \"Not my type. I grew up in politics in D.C. Like, no,\" Wentworth said on The Tonight Show. In the same interview, Wentworth revealed that one of her friends had wanted to set her up on a blind date with Stephanopoulos after Wentworth found herself recently single again.\n\n\"I didn't care about politics, and figured he'd be the last person I'd be interested in. I was holding out for Hugh Grant or Matthew Perry,\" Wentworth joked at a book signing. She also revealed on The Tonight Show, that her best friend dated Stephanopoulos previously and thought that they would make a great match.\n\nWentworth disagreed, but still decided to go on the date as a favor to her friend. She ended up moving to New York City in April 2001, and decided to give Stephanopoulosa call. \"He said, 'great how about dinner?' And I was like, 'oh, that's a commitment.' I said, 'what about coffee?' He's like, 'what about lunch?'\" The pair eventually settled on Wentworth's recommendation of lunch at Barneys in New York, \"cause I thought I'd get my [there]. Like, it won't be a total waste of time.\"\n\nThe pair ordered the same meal — a crab salad — and proceeded to talk for hours. ''You know how when you go on a date and the first 15 minutes are on automatic pilot?'' Stephanopoulos told the New York Times. \"About 15 minutes in, she just leaned in and said something, and we were suddenly in another place, in another universe, immediately. We went from strangers to friends to being in love in days.\"\n\nThe two were engaged after only dating for two months. According to the New York Times, Stephanopoulos openly mentioned during their wedding that, \"I knew within 24 hours, I would not ever dare risk losing her.\"\n\nA couple of months later, on November 20, 2001, the couple got married in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in New York City. Stephanopoulos' father, Rev. Dr. Robert G. Stephanopoulos, performed the ceremony.\n\nFollowing their marriage, Wentworth and Stephanopoulos would often be seen together on the air. Wentworth appeared on Good Morning America several times, and the two even played the Not So Newlywed Game together back in 2013. In 2016, Stephanopoulos made an appearance of Wentworth's TV show, Nightcap, in which he played himself. Wentworth currently stars as Staci Cole and is also the creator, writer, and producer of the show.\n\nThey have two daughters together, Elliott and Harper. According to Wentworth, despite their disparate hours, she makes sure to go to bed with her husband at the same time every day in order to feel more connected to him.\n\n\"When he got this job, I made a very conscious decision that I would go to bed with my husband. 'Cause he gets up at 2:30 in the morning, so I'm not getting up at 2:30. I mean, let's not be crazy. I get up at 6:00 with the kids,\" Wentworth said on Where are they Now? \"My feeling was if I don't get to bed with my husband and I don't wake up with my husband, then he's just my roommate.\"\n\nIn 2017, Wentworth revealed on Live with Kelly and Ryan that Stephanopoulos has a special ritual where he has to kiss his daughters and Wentworth before he leaves for work early in the morning. She mentions that the ritual is a bit complicated, particularly since it wakes her up early due to him not being able to find her in their dark room.\n\n\"And then he leaves. And then I'm an insomniac crazy person, I'm up [making] chocolate chip cookie dough that I freeze and he's gone to GMA and everyone goes, 'oh your poor husband gets up so early,\" Wentworth joked."
