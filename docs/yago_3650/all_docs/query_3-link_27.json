        "text": "From outrageous primetime and late-night parodies to cheerful morning talk, actress Ali Wentworth memorably married a high-energy persona to a voluptuous appearance, cultivating a presence that began on such shows as \"In Living Color\" (Fox, 1990-94) and \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" (NBC, 1992-2013). With an almost tireless commitment to the characters at hand, Wentworth ensured that as long as audiences were ready to laugh, she was all too willing to assist."
