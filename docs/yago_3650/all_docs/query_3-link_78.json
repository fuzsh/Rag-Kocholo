        "text": "George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth are one of the most beloved celebrity couples. The two have been married since 2001 and have two daughters together. Yet over the years, there have been various rumors about their relationship status. Are George and Ali still happily married today? Let’s take a look at the facts.\n\nGeorge and Ali’s Relationship History\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth first met in 1997 when Ali was a cast member on the comedy show In Living Color and George worked at the Clinton White House. However, they didn’t begin dating until a few years later in 2001. The two hit it off instantly and after just a few months of dating, George proposed. The couple tied the knot on November 20, 2001 at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity on New York’s Upper East Side.\n\nIn 2003, George and Ali welcomed their first daughter, Elliott Anastasia Stephanopoulos. Two years later in 2005, their second daughter Harper Andrea was born. The family resides primarily in New York City.\n\nOver the years, George and Ali have gushed about one another in interviews. Ali has described her husband as “incredibly kind” and “hilarious.” Meanwhile, George has called his wife “beautiful,” “funny,” and “brilliant.”\n\nState of Their Marriage Today\n\nBy all accounts, George and Ali appear to still be happily married after over 20 years together. Here are some signs their marriage remains strong:\n\nThey regularly walk red carpets together for events like the Met Gala and Emmy Awards.\n\nAli frequently posts photos with George on Instagram and writes loving captions.\n\nThe couple has been seen being affectionate in New York City, holding hands and linking arms.\n\nIn interviews as recent as 2022, George and Ali have spoken highly of one another and their marriage.\n\nAdditionally, there have been no rumors of cheating, no public marital issues, and neither has ever filed for divorce. Many news outlets still cite them as relationship goals for their evident affection and support of each other’s careers over the years.\n\nAddressing Rumors and Speculation\n\nWhile George and Ali’s marriage appears rock-solid, that hasn’t stopped tabloids from spreading various divorce rumors about them over the years. However, these rumors lack credible sources or evidence to back them up.\n\nFor example, in 2014 Star magazine claimed George and Ali’s marriage was “in crisis” over his demanding job. Gossip Cop investigated this story and found it false – George’s job schedule remained consistent and the couple was still regularly seen in public together. In 2018, Life & Style alleged Ali gave George an “ultimatum” over President Trump straining their marriage. This was also unsupported speculation.\n\nIt’s typical for celebrities like George and Ali to be subjected to made-up divorce drama in tabloid magazines. Outlets profit from creating shocking stories even without facts to prove them. Given George and Ali’s long history and recent actions, it appears they have not let false gossip impact their marriage.\n\nWhat Friends and Family Say\n\nFriends and family of George and Ali have also shut down divorce rumors in the press and asserted the couple’s marriage remains intact.\n\nIn 2016, Ali’s mother Margo denied a National Enquirer story claiming George and Ali were headed to $250 million divorce. Margo stated: “It’s all a lie. They’re very happy together. I was just with them last week in New York.”\n\nIn 2018, a source close to the couple told Gossip Cop that divorce speculation was “not true” and the pair were “happily married.” The insider explained both George and Ali’s careers simply keep them busy but they still make family a priority.\n\nBased on these accounts, those close to George and Ali confirm that despite a hectic work life, they continue to nurture a healthy marriage and family and split time between job obligations and personal time together.\n\nHow George and Ali Make Their Marriage Work\n\nAli Wentworth has shared some insights into why her marriage to George Stephanopoulos has lasted over 20 years in the public eye. A few of her tips include:\n\nMaking time for date nights without their kids twice a week\n\nBeing each other’s best friend and “true partner”\n\nAllowing each other space to focus on individual career goals\n\nHaving a rule to never spend more than 2 weeks apart\n\nPutting their marriage above everything except their children\n\nIt’s clear George and Ali have found a balance that works for their busy lives in the spotlight. Though unconventional, they have made compromises and built a strong foundation based on trust and communication. As Ali told Good Housekeeping in 2022: “You have to keep making the choice to be together.” And by all evidence, that’s exactly what the couple continues to do year after year.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite tabloid gossip suggesting otherwise, there are no credible signs George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth are headed for divorce. The long-time couple appears as happy as ever based on their public outings, social media posts, and comments from close insiders. While juggling high-profile careers, they have made their marriage and family a top priority.\n\nGeorge and Ali prove a celebrity marriage can go the distance through mutual respect, friendship, and continued effort. After over 20 years together, they seem to still genuinely enjoy each other’s company. So yes, by all accounts George and Ali remain happily married and committed life partners.\n\nSummary in a Table"
