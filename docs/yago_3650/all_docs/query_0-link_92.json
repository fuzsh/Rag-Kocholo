        "text": "This morning, George Stephanopoulos tweeted news of Katie Couric’s engagement to financier John Molner. “Congrats to @katiecouric and John Molner on your engagement. Ali and I are thrilled for you,” Mr. Stephanopoulos wrote.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

Comedian/actress/enthusiastic Twitter user Ali Wentworth promptly tweeted at her husband about the oversight (after all, he did sign her name on the tweet!).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AliEWentworth/status/374875222866132992\n\nModern married life sure is hard. Not only do you have to do all the things that couples do to keep each other happy, but you also have to remember your significant other’s Twitter handle.\n\nGood advice for the newly affianced Mr. Molner."
