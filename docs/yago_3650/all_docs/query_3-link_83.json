        "text": "George Stephanopoulos' wife Ali Wentworth is feeling much better after she first revealed her COVID-19 diagnosis two weeks ago.\n\nAfter George revealed details about her recovery on Good Morning America, Ali posted an update to Instagram detailing her harrowing COVID-19 recovery.\n\nIn a live Good Morning America segment, George shared that he tested positive for COVID-19, despite a lack of symptoms.\n\nUPDATE 4/14/20: After her husband George Stephanopoulos revealed his own COVID-19 diagnosis on Good Morning America, Ali Wentworth finished up her time in isolation and opened up to followers on Instagram about her fight to recover at home. For more than two weeks, Ali, 55, suffered through some of the toughest symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus, including wildly high fevers (as high as 103°F, she previously shared), abdominal pains and cramps, as well as severe shortness of breath.\n\nAli's family applauded her strength in their own way. On Monday, they played a snippet of Destiny's Child's smash-hit \"Survivor\" as the mother of two walked down a flight of stairs for the first time in more than two weeks.\n\n\"Came out of 16 days of isolation. I am grateful for my health. It was a brutal and scary time,” Wentworth shared via her Instagram post. “But I am one of the lucky ones. And as I continue to recover, I am struck by what has become the dehumanization of this plague. People are dying. People are suffering. People are hungry. People are scared.”\n\nAli's insight into the coronavirus pandemic came just a few hours after George shared that he became silently sick with an asymptomatic case of COVID-19 after he cared for Ali during her quarantine. \"I've never had a fever, never had chills, never had a headache, never had a cough, never had shortness of breath,\" he told GMA co-anchors Michael Strahan and Robin Roberts. \"I'm feeling great.\"\n\nExperts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have previously shared insight into how some people may contract the disease without even knowing it. Asymptomatic cases, or those who do not exhibit any of the symptoms associated with COVID-19, are part of the reason the federal agency recently updated their guidelines to suggest all Americans cover their face while out in public.\n\nFor Ali, her struggle with COVID-19 has opened her eyes to the emotional toll it took on her entire family. \"We have to shed all ideological, religious, social, economic barriers and [grab] each other’s hands and move forward united,\" she shared on Instagram. \"We can isolate to help others, particularly the incredible health workers and all the courageous and selfless people on the frontlines, but that does not mean we should isolate our hearts.\"\n\nShe wrapped up her message with a light-heartened nod to her daughters — \"(I know my daughters are screaming that this is so cringeworthy)\" — and a message that we could all identify with in the last few weeks. \"Grateful to be back to everything except laundry and dishes…”\n\nORIGINAL, 4/13/2020: Nearly two weeks after Ali Wentworth opened up on Instagram and took to Good Morning America about her struggle with the novel coronavirus, her husband, GMA anchor George Stephanopoulos, updated viewers on Monday that his wife is feeling much better. \"She's doing much, much better Robin, thank you,\" he said, addressing co-anchor Robin Roberts. \"In fact, she's going on her fifth day now with no fever, which is really a great sign.\" He added that Ali has also started to get out of bed \"a little bit more each day, so we're really happy about that.\"\n\nAs Ali's only caregiver in tight quarters, George previously shared he had been monitoring for symptoms as best as he can. The 59-year-old said he was surprised to learn that he tested positive for COVID-19 recently, despite not experiencing many of the symptoms that Ali herself has battled over the last few weeks. \"I've never had a fever, never had chills, never had a headache, never had a cough, never had shortness of breath,\" he shared. \"I'm feeling great.\"\n\nIn a later segment, George said he fully expected his test to come back negative since he couldn't distinctly recall any troubling symptoms earlier in the month. “There was one night, several weeks ago, when I went to bed early with some lower back pain and I thought it was from a hard workout that day… it cleared up the next morning,” he shared. “Then, several days after that, I had one day when I had a diminished sense of smell, but that was it for my symptoms over the last several weeks.”\n\nGiven that George was in close proximity with Ali, he explains it makes sense that he was at a higher risk for contracting the disease. But his case may be a clear-cut example of how some COVID-19 patients may be totally asymptomatic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have cited studies that suggest that there could be some individuals who never show any symptoms, including fever, fatigue, or shortness of breath.\n\nDespite his diagnosis, George says he's feeling fine — and stressed again that Ali is well on her way to feeling better.\n\nEarlier this month on April 2, George shared concerning details of how Ali was affected by the disease: \"It goes for her in cycles. Nights can be pretty rough,\" he said during a live GMA broadcast. And Ali herself highlighted some of the most challenging symptoms: \"Achy joints is a big thing. It feels like a really, really horrible flu… And you know, I'm still in it now, but I can tell you the things that help [are] Tylenol, chicken soup. I took some hot baths when I had chills and I have two dogs that sleep on my bed with me.\""
