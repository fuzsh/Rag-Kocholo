        "text": "Elliott Stephanopoulos was surely the belle of the ball at her senior prom.\n\nThe 18-year-old daughter of George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth got all dressed up in a plunging black silk gown with a thigh-high slit for the special occasion.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wentworth, 56, posted an Instagram photo of Elliott posing beside her dad in the elegant ensemble.\n\n“Prom night! That is not her date….,” Wentworth jokingly captioned the pic.\n\nElliott paired her dress with sparkling silver heels and wore a white rose corsage on her wrist. She finished off the sophisticated look with a red lip and a half-up, half-down hairstyle.\n\nFamous friends of the couple took to the comments section of the pic to shower their daughter with compliments.\n\n“Sooooo beautiful!!!!!!!,” exclaimed Howard Stern’s wife, Beth, while Jennifer Garner added, “Gorgeous girl xxxx.”\n\nMartha Hunt, Katie Couric, Jessica Seinfeld, Jill Kargman and Julianna Margulies were among the others who sang Elliott’s praises.\n\nWentworth spoke about the struggle of finding the teen’s perfect prom dress while guest-hosting “Live With Kelly and Ryan” earlier in the day.\n\n“I have to basically remind my daughter that it’s not the Met Ball or her wedding,” she told Ryan Seacrest. “The dress has to be under $100 and you also can’t dress like a lady of the night, you know what I mean? I don’t mean like a turtleneck sweater dress, but something in between.”\n\nContinued Wentworth of the tedious process, “We’ve gone through a lot of dresses and I think they love the ritual of it, because we went to all these department stores like Bloomingdale’s and tried on all these dresses. I was like, ‘This is a waste of time.'”\n\nThe actress and author added that she had her makeup artist stick around to give Elliott “the works” before her big night.\n\nStephanopoulos, 60, and Wentworth also share 16-year-old daughter Harper.\n\nThe couple got married in 2001."
