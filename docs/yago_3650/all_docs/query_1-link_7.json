        "text": "The couple shares two daughters together — Harper, 18, and Elliott, 21\n\nAli Wentworth and George Stephanopolous are adjusting to life with their children out of the house.\n\nOn Thursday, April 25, Wentworth, 59, spoke exclusively to PEOPLE while on the red carpet for the Colleagues 35th Annual Spring Luncheon and Fall 2024 Collection Fashion Show at the Beverly Wilshire.\n\nThe Parent Test talent serves on the Firework Foundation's board and while discussing the importance of helping children, she opened up about her own.\n\n“We were traumatized at first, and now it's kind of fun,” Wentworth says of being an empty nester.\n\nShe and husband Stephanopolous, 63, share two daughters — Harper Andrea Stephanopoulos, 18, and Elliott Anastasia Stephanopoulos, 21.\n\n“We're young and in love again,” Wentworth tells PEOPLE. “We got married, I got pregnant after nine months. So we've never just been a married couple with no kids. So we're loving it.”\n\nHowever, now that their not-so-little ones have gone off to college and started a new chapter in their lives, she and George have discovered a newfound freedom.\n\n“It's more like, ‘Hey, we can watch anything we want on TV. We can have dinner whenever we want. We could walk around naked if we want to,’ ” Wentworth tells PEOPLE. “It's very liberating.”\n\nThe In Living Color alum previously opened up about becoming an empty nester after dropping Harper off at college last August.\n\nRelated: Ali Wentworth Jokes Every Wedding Anniversary with George Stephanopoulos Starts With 'Waking Up Alone in Bed'\n\n“We dropped our baby off at college. Everyone is saying “she’s ready to launch”! But… I don’t think I’m ready!” Wentworth confessed in a heartfelt Instagram post.\n\nShe added, “I don’t want to stop making pasta with vodka sauce, picking up wet towels, cuddling up to her familiar scent.”\n\nThe picture that accompanied Wentworth’s caption was one of her and George holding hands on what appeared to be Harper’s college campus as they left to allow her time to settle in.\n\nHer comment section was filled with mothers who could relate.\n\n“Hang in there you are right it’s tough, have a good cry, eat whatever then walk into the next chapter you can do this !!!” Maria Shriver wrote.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nFormer Good Morning America co-anchor Lara Spencer added, “I hear you sister.

My clothes will not be missing. I don't like it one bit.”\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
