        "text": "THREE months is hardly a long time -- perhaps enough for a chapter of a doctoral thesis or for a failed diet -- but it was long enough for George Stephanopoulos and Alexandra Wentworth to decide they had found their life partners.\n\nFor the last five years, Mr. Stephanopoulos -- an ABC news analyst, inhabitant of a fabulous apartment featured in Architectural Digest and a former adviser to Bill Clinton -- was known as one of the most eligible bachelors in New York. Ms. Wentworth, a comic actress with a streak of Lucille Ball and the blond patrician good looks of a Boston Brahmin, was also considered a catch. But she lived in Los Angeles.\n\n''She was a major babe in Babeland,'' said Holly Peterson, a friend of Ms. Wentworth's since nursery school. ''She has left behind legions of heartbroken men in Los Angeles.''\n\nBut their status as sought-after singles changed in a flash.\n\n''It was 12:30, Wednesday, April 6,'' Mr. Stephanopoulos said. Ms. Peterson, wanting to have her friend move back East, had set them up on a blind date. Mr. Stephanopoulos, 40, said that once he and Ms. Wentworth started talking, he didn't remember to eat his lunch. He also said he knew within 24 hours, he would not ever dare risk losing her.\n\nMs. Wentworth, 36, is from a long line of well-connected Yankee stock. Her mother, Muffie Brandon Cabot, was the social secretary to Nancy Reagan and is married to Louis Wellington Cabot, a former chairman of the Cabot Corporation, the Boston chemical company, and of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. In that tradition, Ms. Wentworth has a couple of nicknames -- Dabber or Dabs -- the origins of which always remain unknown.\n\nIn her childhood, Ms. Wentworth developed a comic streak, performing political skits in her mother's Washington dining room for guests like Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger. Ms. Wentworth, who went on to good reviews on the Fox comedy show ''In Living Color'' and in films, also wrote ''The WASP Cookbook'' (Warner Treasures, 1997), which offers recipes for mayonnaise sandwiches on white bread and ''Binky's Bourbon Nips for Derby Day.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
