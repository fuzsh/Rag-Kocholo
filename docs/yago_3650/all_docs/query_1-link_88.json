        "text": "NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: Co-host George Stephanopoulos' remark about him and his wife Ali Wentworth being the \"exception\" during the dating segment of the January 5 episode of 'Good Morning America' is as wholesome as it gets.\n\nThe rare personal comment was made by Stephanopoulos in response to the show's guest, dating expert Bela Gandhi, sharing her tip for finding the right partner.\n\nAlso Read: Carrie Underwood reveals what kind of judge she’ll be on ‘American Idol’ as she replaces Katy Perry\n\nDiscussing The Golden Bachelor Wedding that took place the previous night is what led the 'GMA' co-hosts to a segment about dating and its related etiquette, reported The US Sun.\n\nWhy did George Stephanopoulos call himself and his wife an 'exception'?\n\nDuring her appearance on the morning talk show, dating expert Bela Gandhi shared her opinion that people should date multiple people at once to keep their options open.\n\nGandhi also talked about her 15-date rule, according to which a couple should not go exclusive until they have had at least 15 dates over three months.\n\nAlso Read: 'GMA' meteorologist Rob Marciano fired from ABC News after year-long exile from show, fans hope he 'moves on to a better spot'\n\nBoasting on the efficiency of the rule, she added, \"We have had a zero divorce rate.\"\n\nIt was after the dating expert had said her piece that Stephanopoulos chimed in, saying, \"My wife and I are the exception then. We met in April, got engaged in June, married in November.\"\n\nAlso Read: 'Sad to see her go': Internet upset as 'GMA' physician Dr Jennifer Ashton leaves ABC News after 13 years\n\nCo-host Sam Champion applauded Stephanopoulos, saying that he \"loved that,\" while Gandhi acknowledged that what the couple had was exclusivity.\n\nHow did George Stephanopoulos and Ali Wentworth get together?\n\nStephanopoulos, now 62, and Wentworth, now 58, were set up on a blind date by an ex-girlfriend of Stephanopoulos and a friend of Wentworth back in 2001, according to People.\n\nThe publication stated that though Wentworth was not interested in dating someone who worked in politics at the time, she decided to go on the date because she thought it would be a good story for later.\n\nHowever, it turned out to be love at first sight for the couple. Stephanopoulos proposed two months after their first date and Wentworth said yes. They were married in November of the same year.\n\nIn an interview with People in 2018, Wentworth shared, \"Even that (marriage) felt like tick tock, mister. What's the holdup? I was just like, let's get married. Let's start our lives together.\"\n\nThe couple shares two daughters, Elliott, born in 2002, and Harper, born in 2005.\n\nMore from MEAWW\n\nRFK Jr's sister Rory Kennedy warns sibling's candidacy might secure Trump's victory in 2024, Internet says 'let's hope so'"
