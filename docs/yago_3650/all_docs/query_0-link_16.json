        "text": "GOOD Morning America host George Stephanopoulos and his wife Ali Wentworth have opened up about a new habit they picked up.\n\nThe couple was going through a hard time being empty nesters at first, but now they are embracing it.\n\nGeorge, 63, and Ali, 59, became empty nesters last fall when their youngest daughter, Harper, went off to college.\n\nAt first, they went through hard times, but slowly realized the perks to having no kids around.\n\nDuring a red carpet event for Colleagues 35th Annual Spring Luncheon and Fall 2024 Collection Fashion Show at the Beverly Wilshire in California, Ali spoke to People about this transformative time in her and the GMA host's life.\n\nShe is on the board of the Firework Foundation, which helps children from underserved communities find joy in art.\n\nWhile discussing those children, Ali talked about her own - Elliott, 21, and Harper, 18.\n\n“We were traumatized at first, and now it's kind of fun,\" she said.\n\n“We're young and in love again.\"\n\nThe actress went on to say that they got married young and they've never been without kids because she got pregnant after nine months.\n\n\"So, we're loving it,\" Ali said.\n\nGeorge and Ali discovered that they have the freedom to do whatever they want to.\n\n“It's more like, ‘Hey, we can watch anything we want on TV. We can have dinner whenever we want. We could walk around naked if we want to,\" Ali said.\n\n\"It's very liberating.\"\n\nPOOR GEORGE!\n\nIn August, Ali shared a photo of George and Harper to Instagram.\n\nShe also shared another one of her and George walking hand in hand as they walked away from their \"baby,\" who they just dropped off at college.\n\nIt's more like, ‘Hey, we can watch anything we want on TV. We can have dinner whenever we want. We could walk around naked if we want to\n\nAli Wentworth\n\n\"We dropped our baby off at college. Everyone is saying 'she’s ready to launch'!\" Ali captioned the post.\n\n\"But…I don’t think I’m ready! I don’t want to stop making pasta with vodka sauce, picking up wet towels, cuddling up to her familiar scent.\"\n\n\"As Joni Mitchell once wrote- “the bed’s too big, the frying pan too wide”. I know our daughter will thrive. But man, it’s brutal on the parents. If you feel inclined- please send me baked goods. I’ll be under my covers,\" she ended.\n\nAbout a week later, Ali shared that they were dealing with the pain of being empty nesters.\n\n\"To help deal with the pain of being empty nesters- I made George dress like it was his first day of class at a boy’s elementary school…\" she captioned the post.\n\nDADDY-DAUGHTER DAY\n\nDespite being empty nesters, George and Ali enjoy when their kids come home from college.\n\nLast month, George got to spend some time with his oldest daughter, Elliott.\n\nHe ditched the New York City office for a special report in London.\n\nDuring the GMA broadcast, George reported on Princess Kate and Prince William after her cancer diagnosis.\n\nHe also shared an interview he did with the parents of WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich, one year after his detainment.\n\nBefore sending the show back to his co-hosts, George revealed he had a surprise for everyone.\n\n“Hey guys, before you go, I have a special PA here in London today,” George teased. “My daughter Elliott!”\n\nMichael Strahan, Robin Roberts, and fill-in anchor Rebecca Jarvis smiled as Elliott shyly came on screen.\n\n“[She] is studying over here, so I was here for spring break,\" George told his colleagues.\n\nGeorge hugged his daughter as she gave a shy wave to the camera.\n\nElliott quickly ran off camera as the host joked, “Oh no, she got shy very fast.\"\n\nAfter George called her out, Elliott ran back on screen and gave another wave and proper hello.\n\n“I decided to put her to work today,\" George ended."
