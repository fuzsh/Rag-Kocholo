Stephanopoulos' initiatives most notably focused on crime legislation, affirmative action, and a healthcare plan that was spearheaded by Hillary Clinton.\n\nStephanopoulos grew up in Fall River, Massachusetts, and began his political career in Ohio before he moved to Washington DC.\n\nHe is the son of first-generation Greek-American parents."
