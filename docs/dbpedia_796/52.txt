Love Spirals Downwards began in the late 80's as the recording project of multi-instrumentalist, Ryan Lum. In 1991, vocalist Suzanne Perry collaborated with Lum on a 3 song demo which was sent out to 4AD, Creation, and Projekt Records for consideration. Local indie label, Projekt Records, soon released 2 of the 3 songs on the compilation "Across This Grey Land 3," and shortly thereafter offered the duo an album deal. In 1992, their debut album, "Idylls," was released, followed in 1994 by "Ardor." "Ardor" included the guest vocals of their friend, Jennifer Ryan Fuller, whose vocal performance on "Sunset Bell" was reprised for another version of the same song on the album, "Flux." In 1995, the band began performing live, stripping their sound down to an "unplugged" acoustic style. This inspired the folkier sound of their 1996 CD-single, "Sideways Forest," and the subsequent album, "Ever," which were also dabbling in a more electronic sound. By 1998, Lum had moved into an almost exclusively electronica sound, evidenced by the band's final studio album, "Flux." Band tensions led to the use of additional vocalist, Kristen Perry-Gow, who ironically had originally collaborated with Lum before her sister took over as lead vocalist in 1991. In late 1998, Lum began collaborating with Doron Orenstein and Gabriel D. Vine, of Monkey Bars, and vocalist, Anji Bee. A remix of Claire Voyant by Lum and Bee was released as "Love Spirals Downwards" in early 2000, but all future music by the duo would be released under the shortened name, "Lovespirals." In 2000, Projekt Records released a compilation of Love Spirals Downwards which included previously unreleased tracks and rarities, called "Temporal: A Collection of Music Past & Present." In 2002, Lovespirals released their first full length LP, "Windblown Kiss."
