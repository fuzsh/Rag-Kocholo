The Contortionist announced it was in the studio with Jamie King as of this January, and the band also announced a tour with Between The Buried And Me and Polyphia this September. So it stands to reason that the band's new album is completed, and will be released somewhere around its tour with Between The Buried and Me, right?

Right. Now the band is teasing something called Clairvoyant via Facebook, a title which appears in bits and pieces above and below the uhâ€¦ freaking out guy. So who's stoked?
