THE CONTORTIONIST have announced a brand new album!

The new album, titled Clairvoyant, follows 2014’s Language and is scheduled to be released in September. The upcoming album was produced by Jamie King (BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME, THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD). Speaking about the upcoming album and the first single from Clairvoyant, keyboardist Eric Guenther says, “Clairvoyant is the product of not only months of writing and recording dozens of song ideas over the last year, but also a definitive creative artefact outlining the artistic confluence of the six members of THE CONTORTIONIST for our past and future endeavours. Collectively, we’re feeling proud, apprehensive, but ultimately excited to finally have this record speak for us as a meticulously sculpted voyage into our musical psyche. On album and stage, between the art’s presentation, zealous and even forceful sonic immersion, and interpretable lyrical and visual metaphor, we are attempting to bring the listener deeper into the world and musical language of THE CONTORTIONIST. Reimagined struck everyone simply as the most truthful and sincere place to start in this new universe.”
