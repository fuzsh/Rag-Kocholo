        "text": "Spektre’s record label Respekt presents an exhilarating peak-time techno ‘Clairvoyant’ EP by Crossbow.\n\nCrossbow aka Rachel Cross is a New York based artist making her debut on Respekt following releases on other prestigious techno imprints such as Metodi Hristov’s Set About, Spartaque’s Codex Recordings and The YellowHeads’ Reload Records.\n\nShe has a gargantuan sound with fast-paced percussion and intense synth lines that combine to create an intoxicating elixir of techno. Not only is she an exciting young producer whose music has been supported by the likes of Adam Beyer, she is also a skilled DJ who is well-known within New York’s underground club scene.\n\n“Clairvoyant” is the first of the two tracks on this release, and it opens with hammering percussion and tension-building pads. The moody chords and sinister atmospherics create a foundation for trippy vocals and a chilling melody line as the track unfolds with building intensity.\n\n“Time Slip” is another hard-hitting cut that’s signified by punishing claps and bursts of breakbeat percussion as the throbbing bassline creates a menacing vibe. In the breakdown, heavy synth chords build suspense before the percussion slams back in and the track erupts with dark energy."
