        "text": "Robbie Robertson, former guitarist and songwriter for The Band, is set to release his first solo album since 1998. The record, titled How to Become Clairvoyant, is due out in April and will include “This is Where I Get Off,” a track said to be about the singer’s departure from The Band in 1976. It’s the first time Robertson has ever addressed this topic in song.\n\nThe Last Waltz: In Which The Band’s Robbie Robertson becomes a matinee idol, Martin Scorsese regains his touch and a concert becomes a legend (subscription required)\n\nRobertson made the new record with a number of high-profile guests including guitarists Robert Randolph and Tom Morello; Steve Winwood, who plays organ on two songs; and Eric Clapton, who co-wrote three of the album’s songs and plays on six of them.\n\n“It turned out quite extraordinary,” Robertson tells Rolling Stone. “I think I’ve written some really good songs, and the boys helped me out.” The real surprise, though, is an appearance by Trent Reznor, who supplies what Robertson calls “additional textures” on the instrumental “Madame X.”\n\nTrending\n\n“It’s a really cinematic piece of music,” Robertson says. “I wanted Trent to contribute something, and he understood exactly what I was talking about and did something completely beautiful and haunting.”"
