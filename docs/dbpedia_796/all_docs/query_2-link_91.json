        "text": "And He Puts The Load Right On Us\n\nI wonder how many critics will respectfully and politely dole out 3 and 4 star reviews for Robbie Robertson's new, dull CD, \"How To Become Clairvoyant?\" I'm guessing all of them. I have little to lose by saying this record is one colossal disappointment. Truth be told, I'm not a fan of any of Robertson's solo output, what little of it there is. That's not easy to admit, considering how I feel about The Band. But I did want this record. Now that I've heard it, I don't want it so much.\n\nLet's get the Clapton/Robbie duet out of the way. Ben Greenman in the New Yorker refers to \"Fear Of Falling\" as \"the most engaging thing either man has recorded in years.\" Right. And \"Little Fockers\" is the best thing Robert DeNiro has done since \"Meet The Fockers.\" What kind of back-handed compliment is that? This is one of the ONLY things Robertson has recorded in years. And as for Clapton, one small upward turn of his Twin Reverb knob and suddenly the same narcoleptic music he's been making for 30 years is \"engaging?\" The track is radio-friendly and more to the point, without balls.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n\"She's Not Mine,\" sounding a bit like the adopted child of Bob Dylan and Peter Gabriel, works because of its simple yet affective melody, and what sounds like some real heart on the choruses. It's nothing new, but I'm a sucker for a good ballad and some harmony.\n\nRobertson's Band-break-up confessional, \"This Is Where I Get Off\" achieves some heaviosity thanks to its subject matter, and because if you close your eyes, you could hear Danko or Manuel crying out the lyrics. Robertson does a fine job evoking the late, great Rick and Richard with his vocal phrasing. Best thing on the record.\n\nThe bad stuff:\n\n\"He Don't Live Here No More,\" a song purportedly about Martin Scorsese, \"The Last Waltz,\" and the debauchery of 1970-something, has cringe-making lyrics about getting drunk on moonshine, living on a fault line, walking in a sundown and heading for a breakdown. Paul Stanley of Kiss rhymed like this with regularity and nobody gave a shit. And Kiss records sounded better. Marcus deVries production sounds as if his last engineering class took place in 1984. I am not amused by the drum machines and synthesized strings.\n\n\"Axman\" is a bland....very bland...ok...embarrassing song about guitar heroes, name-dropping Duane and Stevie Ray, like it was the greatest idea since the Foreman Grill.\n\nI was a bit excited at the prospect of a Robbie/Trent Reznor instrumental collaboration. Too bad it's on \"Madame X,\" a snoozer written by Eric Clapton. Do you remember \"On The Couch\" from the \"Paris, Texas\" soundtrack? Yeah, neither do I. Same thing.\n\n\"Straight Down The Line\" and \"When The Night Was Young,\" well...the songs aren't much more clever than their titles. Each moves along like any number of minor FM radio hits you suffered through while waiting for what you really wanted to hear.\n\n\"How To Become Clairvoyant\" will come, and then it will go. And that's too bad. I didn't expect \"Big Pink,\" but I also didn't expect something so uninspiring.\n\nThat's Neat! That's Nice\n\nBest news I've heard all week. From NRBQ.com:\n\nHello people, this is Terry.\n\nI'm extremely happy to announce that, with the release of our new CD next week, my Quartet will be resuming the name NRBQ. After three years of playing music with Scott, Pete and Conrad under the name The Terry Adams Rock and Roll Quartet, I'm finally ready to continue doing what I know how to do best and that is to move NRBQ forward. The new album, with cover art by Tom Ardolino, is called KEEP THIS LOVE GOIN' and that is exactly what we're going to do!\n\nThere's been a lot of confusion and speculation for the last six years about what happened with the band in 2004. The time has come to set the record straight.\n\nI love NRBQ. I didn't break up the band. I didn't quit NRBQ. I didn't fire anyone from NRBQ and I did not stop to pursue other projects. I would never end it – it's my life's work.\n\nFunny how things work out. When I wrote the chorus to the song \"Ain't No Horse,\" (\"ain't no horse that can't be rode, ain't no man that can't be throwed\") little did I know that five years later I would be the man that could and would get throwed.\n\nFirst I was diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer in mid-August of 2004. As anyone who has ever gone through cancer or any other serious disease knows, it's a scary and life-changing diagnosis. I decided to deal with it privately so I only shared the information with the band and a few close friends. We continued to work until mid-September, at which point I began a leave of absence. The reason given for my break from NRBQ was a bout with tendonitis (which was also true, by the way).\n\nI didn't want to go the traditional way of radiation and chemotherapy, so I took the leave of absence to see if I could find a holistic approach. I did come back to honor bookings at the end of October.\n\nFive weeks after that, the oncologist who was monitoring my illness said that I was actually improving. He said, \"I don't know how you're doing this, but whatever it is, don't stop!\" He advised me to get back to the music, keep my diet and spirit in check, and of course keep a close eye on my progress. When I called the guys with the good news, that is when I learned that my bandmates, after ten years of great fun, shows, and recordings, were not interested in continuing with NRBQ but preferred to continue working as Baby Macaroni. It was unbelievably sad for me to hear this, especially at that time.\n\nThere have been several versions of NRBQ and I've loved every one of them. Great musicians and friends have come and gone. I've always hated to see anyone leave. But in time, change can turn out to be a good thing.\n\nYou can read more, and purchase the new CD here.\n\nNEVER COP OUT\n\n\"The Spiders\" : THE WEEKEND MIX\n\nIt's not my usual modus operandi to post an album proper for \"The Weekend Mix,\" but this one is just too good, and it usually fetches a c-note in this form.\n\nLed by brothers Chuck and Chick Carbo, The Spiders started out singing gospel in New Orleans but later became one of the top R&B vocal groups of the time. Produced by Dave Bartholomew somewhere around 1954, this LP was released on Imperial in 1961 and it's a killer.\n\nHere it is in detail, courtesy of AMG:\n\nNew Orleans R&B was best known for its solo artists, but the Spiders rank among the Crescent City's pre-eminent vocal groups, and were certainly the best the city produced during the '50s. The Spiders actually began life circa 1947 as a gospel group called the Zion City Harmonizers; they later changed their name to the Delta Southernaires, and made a few recordings and radio appearances from 1952-1953. With encouragement from legendary New Orleans studio head Cosimo Matassa, the group switched to secular R&B and signed with Imperial in late 1953. The newly christened Spiders were centered around brothers Hayward \"Chuck\" Carbo and Leonard \"Chick\" Carbo, the latter a bass singer who sometimes split lead vocals with his brother; the other members of the quintet were Joe Maxon, Matthew West, and Oliver Howard. Their first single, \"I Didn't Want to Do It,\" went to number three on the R&B charts in early 1954, and other sides like \"You're the One,\" \"Tears Begin to Flow,\" and \"I'm Slippin' In\" were top sellers as well, making the Spiders a hot concert draw. Maxon and West both left the group in 1955 and were replaced by Bill Moore and Issacher Gordon. The Spiders' string of R&B Top Tens continued that year with \"21\" and the Dave Bartholomew-penned \"Witchcraft,\" their second Top Five hit and biggest overall seller (it was later covered by Elvis Presley). Imperial began grooming Chuck Carbo for a solo career in 1956, which caused dissent within the group; by the end of the year, Chick Carbo had signed to Atlantic as a solo artist himself, and the Spiders effectively dissolved. A final single in 1957, \"That's My Desire,\" failed to catch on, as did a posthumous from-the-vaults release in 1960, \"Tennessee Slim.\" Neither of the Carbo brothers scored any significant chart hits, although Chuck did return in the late '80s and early '90s, cutting an album for Rounder in 1993. Chick passed away in 1998.\n\nI see good moods in your future.\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nI Didn't Want To Do It\n\nYou're The One\n\nI'm Slippin' In\n\nMmm Mmm Baby\n\nWalkin' Around In Circles\n\nI'm Searching\n\nThat's Enough\n\nSukey, Sukey, Sukey\n\nAm I The One\n\nDon't Knock\n\n(True) You Don't Love Me\n\nWitchcraft\n\nTHE ZIP\n\nA Connection Maybe?\n\nFROM BACKSTREETS.COM\n\nIn May, Columbia will issue a new single-disc release for Thom Zimny's documentary film The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town, on both DVD and Blu-Ray. The film premiered on HBO and received a rapturous critical response around the world, including as an official selection, Toronto International Film Festival, The BFI London Film Festival, and The International Rome Film Festival. Previously, the acclaimed doc has only been available as part of the six-disc Darkness box released in November.\n\nFor those fans who already picked up the box set as a matter of course, the new release packs a pair of bonus features previously commercially unavailable: \"Songs From the Promise,\" the five-song performance film from the Asbury Park carousel house; and \"A Conversation With His Fans,\" from the Dave Marsh-hosted fan Q&A at Sirius/XM studios.\n\n\"Songs From the Promise\" was filmed before an audience of approximately 60 fans in December 2010 and was webcast only through the end of that month. For this one-time concert event, Springsteen and members of the Darkness-era E Street Band lineup (Clarence Clemons, Stevie Van Zandt, Max Weinberg, Roy Bittan, and Garry Tallent) were joined by keyboardist Charles Giordano, a full horn section (Ed Manion, Barry Danielian, Curt Ramm, Clark Gayton and Stan Harrison) and special guest David Lindley, who played violin during the original recording sessions. Directed and edited by Zimny and mixed by Emmy-winner Bob Clearmountain, the concert features E Street Band performances of four tracks from The Promise plus \"Blue Christmas\":\n\n1. \"Racing in the Street ('78)\n\n2. \"Gotta Get That Feeling\"\n\n3. \"Ain't Good Enough For You\"\n\n4. \"The Promise\"\n\n5, \"Blue Christmas\"\n\nJudging by today's press release, no additional footage from the carousel will be included other than what was previously webcast as \"Songs From the Promise.\" Just in case any powers-that-be want to get clever and throw in some easter eggs -- y'know, pull another \"The Way\" on us -- we'll keep fingers crossed for \"One Way Street\" or \"The Brokenhearted.\"\n\n\"A Conversation With His Fans\" aired on VH1 Classic and Palladia earlier this year, a 22-minute program offering footage of the question-and-answer session with a small group of fans in the studios of Sirius XM's E Street Radio channel. Springsteen discusses the writing and recording of Darkness on the Edge of Town and the decision to release the extensive collection of songs that didn't make the record. Questions are intercut with highlights from The Promise box set, including the Paramount Theater performance and rare archival footage from 1978.\n\nThe DVD and Blu-Ray will be released on May 3; we'll have pre-order information shortly.\n\nAND THEN THERE'S THIS, FROM NPR.ORG\n\n2010 was another lousy year for the music industry – and in particular, the CD. Sales of compact discs dropped last year by nearly 20% percent, according to Billboard. For a while, those shiny plastic discs lifted the fortunes of the recording industry to new heights. But the CD also contained the seeds of the industry's collapse — a collapse that's rattling more than Manhattan boardroom windows.\n\nA Sony factory in Pittman, New Jersey, will see its last CD roll out off the assembly line at the end of this month. At its height, the plant employed 1300 people.\n\n\"The overtime, you had it whenever you wanted it,\" says Jim Jones, who's been driving a forklift at the factory since 1982, when the plant still made LPs. \"10 hour days if you wanted it. Saturdays, Sundays — you could get it. That's how busy we were. A lot of times it was mandatory. You had to work, that was it.\"\n\nJones met his wife, Cindy, at the plant in the 1990s, when they worked in the warehouse together, rushing out the latest hits. \"It's been so long since there was a big hit,\" she says. \"It's just,\" she pauses, \"slow.\"\n\nSony will still make CDs at its factory in Indiana. But the closure of the New Jersey plant is telling. Sales of compact discs have fallen 50 percent over the past decade. It's a long way from the early 1980s, when breathless ads and over-the-top hyperbole touted \"sound like you've never heard it before.\"\n\nThe CD was invented by hardware manufacturers Sony and Philips. At first, executives at the major record labels didn't like the new format. But they started to come around — thanks in large part to Jac Holzman, the founder of Elektra Records who will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next week. Holzman was a big advocate for the CD when he was at Warner Music Group.\n\n\"The CD was sexy. And it would bring higher prices — from about 8 dollars for cassettes or LPs at the end of the '70s, to about $15 in the early '80s,\" Holzman says. \"You could resell your best catalogue again. CDs were lighter and cheaper to ship, which is a big consideration.\"\n\nAll of that meant giant profits for the music industry in the 1980s and '90s. \"The CD sold so well. And it created this gigantic boom in the industry,\" says Steve Knopper, the author of Appetite for Self-Destruction: The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry in the Digital Age. \"And everybody got rich. And people just got incredibly accustomed to this. To the point where in the late '90s, the only way that you could get the one song that you liked was to buy the 15 to 18 dollar CD at the Tower Records.\"\n\nAt first, Knopper says, people didn't mind paying a lot for the new format. \"You didn't hear the outcry at the time of, 'Hey, we're getting price-gouged.' Instead the public was going, 'this is much better sound.'\"\n\nThe record labels promised that the price of CDs would come down eventually. And the discs did get cheaper — to make. But the labels kept retail prices - and profits - high. Jac Holzman says that was a mistake.\n\n\"It's fine to keep that up for two or three years. But the labels kept it up far too long. And I think it was a fraud on the public, and on the artists.\"\n\nSales peaked in 2000. Back when the disc was designed, no one in the music industry thought much about ripping or burning on a personal computer. But CDs were the first widely available format that allowed consumers to free digital copies of songs from a physical object. Which led to the rise of the mp3, and Napster, and other peer-to-peer networks.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, while shopping for used discs at the Princeton Record Exchange in New Jersey, Larry Haas offered that the music industry \"shot itself in the foot\" by not rolling back CD prices. Scott Gordon was there too and says that he still prefers CDs to digital downloads. \"There's a certain thing about holding it in your hand,\" Gordon adds. \"As long as this store is here, and I'm breathing, I'll be here probably 4 times a year.\"\n\nThat's hardly enough to bring back the glory days, but the CD hasn't faded out yet – in fact, Jon Lambert, the Record Exchange's general manager, says CDs are his store's bread and butter. He says sales of new CDs have declined dramatically. But the store makes up for it with a brisk business in used discs – especially in the five-dollars-and-under section. \"Probably the biggest fallout from the downloading mentality is it became more a singles market. People were willing to pay a couple dollars for the songs off an album. But they're not willing to pay 18 for a new CD,\" Lambert says.\n\nHe wouldn't be surprised if new releases on CD slow to a trickle in the next 10 years, as record labels turn their attention to so-called 'cloud-based' music services.\n\n\"Unreleased Finn Brothers\" : THE WEEKEND MIX\n\nHere's Stephen Thomas Erlewine and a bit of what he had to say on AMG about the Finn Brothers' 2004 release, \"Everyone Is Here\":\n\nAt its heart, this is an album about family -- specifically, about being brothers. This is the first time the Finns have written as directly and abundantly about their kinship, and unlike other famous rock siblings, the Finns' relationship is not only cordial but loving, which doesn't mean that it's any less complex than such legendarily combative brothers from the Everlys through the Gallaghers. Tim and Neil mine their relationship throughout the album -- the word \"brother\" seems to appear here more often than the entirety of their past work -- and they've come up with a moving set of songs that may not add up to a concept album yet are surely unified by a set of themes. Similarly, despite three different sets of producers (primarily Mitchell Froom, but also Jon Brion and Tony Visconti for individual tracks) the album boasts a unified sound, particularly in comparison to the rather ragged, seemingly unfinished Neil effort One Nil (distilled and strengthened in its American incarnation, One All) or Tim's Feeding the Gods. It's a meditative, expertly crafted mature pop record, filled with subtle sonic textures -- ranging from banjos to harmoniums, all adding colors to layers of primarily acoustic guitars -- that give this low-key, reflective music a rich variety of color.\n\nHuzzah!\n\nAs much as I adore just about everything Neil & Tim have had a hand in, I'll vote for \"Everyone Is Here\" as their crowning achievement.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with this record, I strongly suggest a good walk around the park, just you and it. In the meantime, for those who are familiar, please enjoy \"take one,\" as heard through the ears of Tony Visconti. Here is the rejected, Visconti-produced version of \"Everyone Is Here.\"\n\nThe track list differs slightly to include some tracks that were later released as b-sides. The arrangements are occasionally different, as well. Some are better...I think. Some aren't...I... uh...also think. As my friend Steve Simels would say, \"Compare and contrast.\"\n\nOne story is that the label heads thought it needed polishing, so in came Mitchell Froom with his reverb machine. I wish had another story, but that's all I got...well...and this great rarity.\n\nENJOY!\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nAnything Can Happen\n\nEdible Flowers\n\nPart Of Me\n\nLuckiest Man\n\nWay Back Down\n\nNothing Wrong With You\n\nThe Land Torments The Sea\n\nA Life Between Us\n\nDisembodied Voices\n\nWon't Give In\n\nGentle Hum\n\nAll The Colours\n\nHomesick\n\nSunset Swim\n\nEveryday Alright\n\nTell Me C'mon\n\nzip\n\nIt's All About 3:08-3:15\n\nIt'll be 10 years this October that \"The Concert For New York City\" took place at Madison Square Garden, just 6 weeks after 9/11. The heaviest of the heavies gathered to not only pay tribute to the great city and the lives lost, but to those that survived. It was impossible not to be moved by every single performance that night. Tim Robbins' introduction of The Who is such an outpouring of raw emotion, it still makes me stop in my tracks and take a breath.\n\nI have a vivid memory. I wasn't at the show, as I had already had a weekend in New Orleans planned since summer. I can speak for many friends when I say, no one really knew what to do or how to act for weeks and weeks after that day. On 9/21, I had gone to see the Black Crowes and one friend said, \"I'm just not ready to see music.\" He stayed home. I justified going, though I wasn't sure I was ready, because the show hadn't been canceled. I thought, \"It's still happening, so it must be alright.\" It was alright. At the time, it felt like the greatest concert I had ever seen. I'm sure it wasn't, though the crowd was at a fever pitch for all of it, and broke new decible records when Chris Robinson announced, \"This finally feels like a Friday night.\"\n\nSo now it's time to travel, again feeling, only a month later, like it wasn't the right thing to do. I felt as if I was disrespecting everyone. But, after some more rationalization--- flights weren't canceled, New Orleans was open---I flew.\n\nI arrived that Friday evening, as the \"Concert For New York\" was being broadcast live, and as I got ready to head out into the New Orleans night, I watched Eric Clapton and Buddy Guy. At first it seemed like a standard take on \"Hoochie Coochie Man.\" But then Eric rips out one of those solos you pray for. When he's through, he respectfully gives Buddy the nod. Buddy does the same, but it's the moment that begins at 3:08, when Buddy starts to go for it and the look on his face at 3:15, when he realizes, he got it. It was then, as I stood in the apartment on St. Philip Street in the French Quarter, when it really...finally... felt like a Friday night."
