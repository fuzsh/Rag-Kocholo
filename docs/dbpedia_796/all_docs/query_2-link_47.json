        "meta_description": "DK126State Faults - Clairvoyant 12\" LPState Faults is a post-hardcore band from Northern California. Formed in early 2010, the group immediately began writing and recording music for what would become their debut EP, Head In The Clouds. The EP quickly spread through word of mouth and the band began to cultivate a devoted following. In April of 2012 State Faults signed to North Carolina based indie label Tiny Engines and released their first full length record Desolate Peaks. After touring on the strength of the LP for the better part of a year, the band began preparing new material for their follow up record. They were picked up by No Sleep Records in 2013 and immediately entered the studio with bay area producer Jack Shirley to work on their sophomore LP Resonate/Desperate which they would release following their first full U.S. tour. Two years after touring on the success of Resonate/Desperate with bands including The Saddest Landscape, State Faults entered a hiatus in 2015. Over the next four years, they would begin quietly compiling music for their third record. In January of 2019 the band returned to The Atomic Garden Studios with producer Jack Shirley and completed work on their upcoming third LP Clairvoyant that is set to be released via No Sleep Records and Dog Knights Productions on June 21st 2019.STREAM HEREDog Knights BandcampTRACKLISTINGDreamcatcher, Pt.

All orders placed through Dog Knights will always receive free promotional flyers, stickers, digital download codes, and maybe even a free record with larger orders, whenever possible.Always read the item description carefully. Pre-orders are clearly noted at the top of the item description as âpre-orderâ along with an estimated shipping date, which is liable to change at any time due to the long process of vinyl manufacturing. This information is also added to the drop-down tab on every selectable product listing that is an active âpre-orderâ - so itâs impossible to proceed without acknowledging. Please do not email us in June to ask where your order is, if youâve added a product that reads âDue To Ship Mid-Julyâ to your cart.The best way to stay up to date with active pre-order (bad news or good news), is to occasionally check our social media pages at @dogknights across all platforms. It saves both our time to quickly check these pages before emailing us asking for an update on a pre-order when weâve been regularly updating these pages.Need to make a change to your address? No problem, mistakes happen! Just email dogknightseu@gmail.com before your order has shipped and we will do our best to amend this in time.If you believe your order has gone missing or arrives damaged in any form, please email dogknightseu@gmail.com along with your order #, full name + address, the date you placed the order, and any other information that could prove useful to us.We are forever grateful to all of our customers for supporting Dog Knights and our bands. Please treat us with respect, like we will to you. Any uncalled-for aggression or rude behaviour will not be tolerated and dealt with accordingly, however we deem fit.As of 1st October 2019, PayPal changed their refund policy and will no longer refund the âtransaction feesâ â meaning all small businesses will actually lose money whenever a customer requests a refund. It goes without saying, but we are a small label and itâs incredibly unhelpful to ask for a refund if youâve simply âchanged your mindâ. All money directly goes toward future projects and/or the band. If thereâs no other choice but to issue a refund, the non-refundable fees that have already been collected by PayPal (approximately 5% of the entire order) will not be returned.Further information can be found in our FAQ/T&C's section at the top of our store page.",
