        "text": "BEST AMBIENT The Best Ambient Music on Bandcamp, July 2024 By Ted Davis · July 29, 2024\n\nEach month, writer, musician, and DJ Ted Davis wanders through the dreamlike outskirts of Bandcamp. Embracing a fluid, forward-thinking approach to ambient, anything deemed worthy of the genre tag is considered fair game for this column. Here are albums that ponder the slumber-induced otherworld, a handful of chic remixes, various odes to birds, and more.\n\nPatricia Wolf\n\nThe Secret Lives Of Birds\n\nPortland, Oregon-based synthesizer guru Patricia Wolf is one of the most promising rising artists in ambient. On her stellar 2022 full-lengths I’ll Look For You In Others and See-Through, she served up heavenly, emotional soundscapes. Wolf’s new album, The Secret Lives Of Birds, draws on her passion for conservation and interest in birding. It arrives via emerging UK label Nite Hive, and came to life as Wolf considered the messages avian creatures might be communicating to each other in their calls. Over 40 minutes, field recordings titter beneath chirpy arpeggiations and frosty pads. Through instrumentation alone, Wolf has filtered subject matter as important as wildlife preservation through a wholesome, passionate lens.\n\nSUSS\n\nBirds & Beasts\n\nNew York, New York\n\nfollow\n\n&check; following\n\nunfollow\n\nNew York, New York\n\nfollow\n\n&check; following\n\nunfollow\n\nAmbient country innovators SUSS have an “outdoorsy” edge, with an output that conjures images of expansive mountain ranges and sun-baked scrubland. Made up of New York City rock scene veterans Bob Holmes, Jonathan Gregg, and Pat Irwin, the act pays rich sonic homage to the American West. SUSS’s new album for Northern Spy, Birds & Beasts, is their most ruminative release to date. Inspired by the earth’s mystical thrum, silvery drones convey a sense of mournfulness that’s peppered with flashes of wonder. If prior SUSS records were made for long drives between flickering desert towns, Birds & Beasts is more psychedelic and fluid—the entrancing sight of a distant, rippling mirage.\n\nDanny Paul Grody Duo\n\nArc of Night\n\nDanny Paul Grody operates somewhere adjacent to the cosmic Americana universe. But there’s a freewheeling jamminess to his music that seems sharp and bookish compared to his more rambling peers. Grody’s new album, Arc of Night, is a partnership with drummer Rich Douthit, which also features appearances from Chuck Johnson and Trevor Montgomery. As its title suggests, the record radiates the inky mystery of darkness. Across seven tracks, Grody’s fretwork quivers atop subtle, muted drums. A sibling album to 2023’s Arc of Day, Arc of Night was released by Three Lobed Recordings—a North Carolina label that dominates a weathered, guitar-driven lane—and sits seamlessly alongside releases from Eli Winter and Sunburned Hand of the Man.\n\nM. Geddes Gengras\n\nIshi – 10th Anniversary Edition\n\nAt times, modular synthesis can feel like it hinges on technical prowess as much as artistry. But in the hands of M. Geddes Gengras, wires and cables have as much artistry as a great oil painting. Now based in upstate New York, Gengras first found his footing in a mind-bending corner of the Los Angeles underground, and a 10th anniversary reissue of his 2014 album, Ishi, offers a refined glimpse at his heady early days. The album initially was sparked by the deaths of several people in Gengras’s life, and it has a pensive depth that speaks louder than words. It was recorded using outdated mono keyboards, which instill Ishi with human character. Remastered by Angel Marcloid, these three sprawling pieces sound fuller than ever before. The retouched version offers a reminder of Gengras’s place as a vital mainstay of left-field electronic music.\n\nYetsuby\n\nb_b\n\nSeoul, South Korea\n\nfollow\n\n&check; following\n\nunfollow\n\nSeoul, South Korea\n\nfollow\n\n&check; following\n\nunfollow\n\nYejin Jang is perhaps best known as one-half of the Korean duo Salamanda. On releases for labels including Wisdom Teeth and Human Pitch, Jang has played a key role in the group, developing a radiant formula centered on mallet-like synths and undulating beats. But she also releases more low-key solo material under the moniker Yetsuby. b_b, her new release for Seb Wildwood’s upbeat all my thoughts label, is one of Jang’s most dynamic outings. At some points the EP is balmy and atmospheric. At others, things are lithe and percussive, peppered with whimsical vocal snippets. From start to finish, b_b is mesmerizing, emphasizing Jang’s ability to make tracks that are at once inventive and inviting.\n\nLuke Elliott\n\nEvery Somewhere\n\nLuke Elliott has a knack for crafting synthesizer-driven soundscapes that are gurgling but pristine. The Amsterdam-based musician emerged over the last few years. He issued a string of self-releases before popping up on the labels Imaginary North and Frosti. His new album, Every Somewhere, arrives via experimental heavyweights AKP Recordings. It’s Elliott’s most fully realized solo effort to date, drawing from frustration with colonialism. Resampled field recordings and electronic sequences are twisted into lustrous, stuttering forms. Existing at the intersection of artificial sound and nature, Every Somewhere is placid and nuanced.\n\nAntonina Nowacka\n\nSylphine Soporifera\n\nAntonina Nowacka cut her teeth in the moody duo WIDT before debuting as a solo artist in 2020. The Polish multi-instrumentalist quickly hit a groove, finding her footing in an arty corner of the experimental sphere, thanks in part to an Unsound-issued collaboration with Sofie Birch. Nowacka’s new full-length, Sylphine Soporifera, imagines a landscape inhabited by a hypothetical titular species. Across 10 tracks titled after clouds and dolphins, Nowacka’s throaty singing rests atop spindly zither, harp, and synth glissandos. The end result is like an open world video game melded from seraphic noise.\n\nBartosz Kruczyński\n\nDreams & Whispers\n\nBartosz Kruczyński found his footing releasing blocky dance music as Earth Trax, rising to prominence during the 2010s lo-fi house boom. But the Polish producer has evolved over the years, exploring everything from floaty breaks to formless sketches. Kruczyński’s new release, Dreams & Whispers, is issued by the Spanish imprint Balmat. Zeroing in on ambient at its most traditional, the record’s 14 tracks are exercises in wistful deep listening. The A-side consists of seven cuts that aim to evoke the fantasy of slumber, built on excitable melodies that burble beneath whooshing swells. The back half is more shadowy and complex, in the vein of ‘80s Harold Budd. Dreams & Whispers basks in a blissfulness that has enabled Kruczyński’s work to remain captivating, long past the heyday of hazy 808s and goofy samples.\n\nZULI\n\nLambda\n\nZULI’s new record, Lambda, is smokey and amorphous. The Berlin-based producer cut his teeth making rap beats under the now-dead alias Swag Lee, and eventually found support when his music started popping up in Aphex Twin DJ sets. It takes little more than a cursory spin to understand why Richard D. James would gravitate to ZULI. He presents a smoggy, zonked-out interpretation of IDM and his new record, Lambda, is his most toned-down yet. Flickers of rhythm appear in the form of trip-hop drums, but, for the most part, it hovers in opalescent mist. Enhanced by guests Coby Sey, MICHAELBRAILEY, and Abdullah Miniawy, Lambda is outwardly calm with steely, turbulent inner workings.\n\nshinetiac\n\nStarfrog Slipmoded\n\nNew York, New York\n\nfollow\n\n&check; following\n\nunfollow\n\nNew York, New York\n\nfollow\n\n&check; following\n\nunfollow\n\nIan Kim Judd has cemented himself as one of ethereal music’s most reliable tastemakers. In his beloved NTS show Fifth World, the Brooklyn-based DJ uses his cheeky presence to platform saccharine sounds doused in dubby effects. The second release on Judd’s label, ost, is from contemporary chillout supergroup shinetiac. Comprising vibey club institutions Ben Bondy, Pontiac Streator, and Shiner, the record collects remixes of the trio’s previously released track “Star Frog Dilla,” which opens the West Mineral Ltd. backed LP Not All Who Wander Are Lost. Retoolings from the likes of Opheliaxz and Hysterical Love Project find the bloopy original transformed into feathery shoegaze, deconstructed radio pop, and more. Starfrog Slipmoded further solidifies ost as an essential addition to the electronic realm."
