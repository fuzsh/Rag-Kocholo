        "text": "Jeff Mills rarely needs an introduction but for those of you new to the name, Jeff Mills (aka “The Wizard”) is a pioneer and well respected artist in the genre of techno music, Clairvoyant (his latest solo work) demonstrates the reason why.\n\nVerdict: This is something else, almost other-worldly. A dark voyage to the other side with somber tones throughout. To simply pigeon hole it ambient techno, would be an injustice, as this cuts way deeper. Intensely atmospheric, the beats drive the tracks while the synths create eerie soundscapes and strange melodies. As the title of the album suggests, the ambiance of the album is like that of a realm beyond ours, strange almost uncomfortable at times, but drawing the listener in, igniting ones curiosity to go further, to see what lies behind the curtain of our own existence.\n\nEveryone will draw their own interpretations and meanings from what lies deep within the tracks but I think its up to the individual to make up their own minds of what the music says to them. Jeff Mills is an artist, and I believe there is not a single unintentional brush stroke here. It’s a beautiful late night deep dive experience to get lost in.\n\nOut Now: available at Axis Records International (bigwax.fr)\n\nNote: Grab the vinyl if you can, a lush sounding (fantastic pressing) three piece set."
