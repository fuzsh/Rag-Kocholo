        "text": "If you haven’t already done so, read Part One. The same conditions apply as in the first installment. So, let’s continue the list…\n\nBut also…stick around at the end when I reveal the answer to the question: “You get one song to listen to for the rest of your life: what is it?”\n\nInnervisions is a quintessential Stevie Wonder album that showcases his genius in a blend of funk, soul, and rock with deeply introspective lyrics. It’s a poignant exploration of social issues, spirituality, and personal adversity. Tracks like Living for the City vividly depict the struggles of urban life, while Higher Ground offers a funky, optimistic take on perseverance and spiritual reincarnation. Wonder's use of innovative sound technologies, especially the synthesizer, complements his clairvoyant songwriting, making Innervisions not only a cornerstone of his career but also a landmark in the evolution of Motown.\n\nMemorable cut: All in Love is Fair\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road stands as a towering achievement in pop music. This double album encapsulates a vivid blend of genres—from rock to ballads, blues, and country—showcasing John's versatility and Bernie Taupin's lyrical brilliance. Hits like the wistful title track, the rollicking Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting, and the poignant Candle in the Wind are stitched together with an array of deep cuts that explore complex emotions and storytelling. The production, rich with elaborate arrangements and melodic lushness, further cements the album as a classic, making it a quintessential listen for anyone captivated by the artistry of Elton John's golden era.\n\nMemorable cut: Funeral for a Friend / Love Lies Bleeding\n\nBand on the Run, the third studio album by Paul McCartney and Wings (recorded in Lagos, Nigeria), is often celebrated as one of McCartney's finest post-Beatles works. The album showcases a rich tapestry of genres, blending rock, folk, and hints of reggae into a cohesive, adventurous sound. Its title track, Band on the Run, is a dynamic, multi-part suite that has become an iconic anthem of liberation and resilience. The album's production, marked by its lush arrangements and impeccable melodies, reflects McCartney's creative ingenuity. Overall, Band on the Run captures the spirit of its time and stands as a testament to McCartney's enduring talent in crafting pop and rock masterpieces.\n\nMemorable cut: Jet\n\nSuperfly, the 1972 soundtrack album by Curtis Mayfield, is a masterpiece of funk and soul, deeply interwoven with social commentary, making it as impactful today as it was at its release. Serving as the soundtrack for the film of the same name, the album transcends its origins to deliver a powerful critique of the struggles and injustices faced by the African-American community. Mayfield's falsetto weaves through a lush backdrop of brassy horns and funky guitar riffs, creating an immersive and emotionally charged experience. Standout tracks like Pusherman and the hauntingly beautiful Freddie's Dead showcase Mayfield's genius in storytelling through music, making Superfly a seminal work that defined a genre and an era.\n\nMemorable cut: Pusherman\n\nWho's Next by The Who is a monumental album that stands as a seminal work in rock music history. Released in 1971, it captures the band at their creative zenith, combining powerful rock with emerging synthesizer technology to produce a sound that was ahead of its time. The album opens with the iconic track Baba O'Riley, featuring a mesmerizing keyboard intro that transitions into an explosive, high-energy song, setting the tone for the rest of the record. Songs like Behind Blue Eyes and Won't Get Fooled Again showcase Pete Townshend’s genius as a songwriter and guitarist, blending introspective lyrics with dynamic compositions. The album’s production, musicianship, and innovative use of the synthesizer left a lasting impact on the rock genre, making Who's Next a timeless classic that resonates with listeners even decades after its release.\n\nMemorable cut: Behind Blue Eyes\n\nLed Zeppelin IV, often referred to by its mystical symbols on the album cover, stands as a monumental release in rock history, blending hard rock, folk, and blues in an innovative fusion. Released in 1971, it showcases Led Zeppelin at their peak, featuring the iconic Stairway to Heaven, perfectly encapsulating the album's range from gentle acoustic melodies to powerful, electrifying crescendos. Other standout tracks like Black Dog and When the Levee Breaks exhibit the band's robust musical prowess and dynamic interplay, making this album not only Led Zeppelin’s best-selling work but also a defining pillar of 20th-century music. Its enduring influence is a testament to the band's creativity and the album's profound impact on the landscape of rock.\n\nMemorable cut: Black Dog\n\nJohn Prine's self-titled debut album, released in 1971, is a masterclass in folk songwriting, marked by its poignant lyricism and understated delivery. Prine's unique voice—a blend of world-weary gravitas and youthful whimsy—animates a collection of deeply personal and universally relatable songs. From the playful Illegal Smile to the devastating Sam Stone, the tracks are imbued with a keen observational eye and a deft touch for storytelling that belie his young age at the time. With its blend of humor, pathos, and social commentary, John Prine launched his career and firmly established him as a vital American songwriting voice, influencing generations of musicians and songwriters.\n\nMemorable cut: Illegal Smile\n\nBlue by Joni Mitchell is a quintessential album that beautifully encapsulates the emotional landscapes of love, melancholy, and introspection. Released in 1971, this album stands as a masterclass in songwriting and composition, with Mitchell's poignant lyrics and distinctive folk sound. Her use of open tuning and raw vocal expression draws listeners into a deeply personal journey. Tracks like River and A Case of You are standout pieces that exhibit her vulnerability and artistic depth. Blue is not just a collection of songs but a profound exploration of human emotions, making it an enduring classic in the landscape of modern music.\n\nMemorable cut: Carey\n\nGasoline Alley, Rod Stewart's second solo album, exudes a raw and intimate charm that captures the essence of early 70s rock and folk. Released in 1970, the album is characterized by its acoustic warmth, blending Stewart's distinctive raspy vocals with a rustic, almost unplugged sound. Looking back on it, I might add that it was the high point of his career before superstardom turned him into a caricature of himself. The title track and standout covers like It's All Over Now and Only A Hobo showcase Stewart’s knack for melding soulful narratives with an earthy, rock-infused base. The album’s straightforward, heartfelt approach not only solidified Stewart’s persona as a solo artist but also marked a pivotal point in his career, hinting at the legendary status he was to achieve.\n\nMemorable cut: Cut Across Shorty\n\nBONUS: Stephen Colbert asks the following question on his eponymous Questionnaire: “You get one song to listen to for the rest of your life: what is it?”\n\nMy pick: River Deep Mountain High by Tina Turner (1966)\n\nThe backstory: At a Hollywood club, Phil Spector became captivated by the Ike and Tina Turner Revue and chose Tina Turner to sing River Deep, Mountain High, a track he believed would be a hit. The song, penned by Spector, Jeff Barry, and Ellie Greenwich, was recorded at Gold Star Studios for a then-astronomical $22,000, involving 21 session musicians. Tina’s recording session was grueling; she sang repeatedly under Spector’s demanding supervision until he was satisfied, a process so intense and exhausting that she eventually ended up performing in her bra, drenched in sweat. The recording session, later depicted in Tina Turner’s 1993 biopic, What's Love Got to Do with It, was also noteworthy for the presence of a gobsmacked Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. Despite its lackluster performance in the charts, barely making the Top 100, it remains one of her most notable recordings. I was lucky enough to see her perform it in 1972 with Ike Turner and the Ikettes in Ann Arbor. Every time I hear it, my heart still skips a beat.\n\nLeave a comment"
