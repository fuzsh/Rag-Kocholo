        "text": "2000 remix album by Claire Voyant\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllmusic[1]\n\nTime Again is a collection of remixes of songs by Claire Voyant. It contains 12 remixes of 9 songs from their previous album, Time and the Maiden. The only album track not included in the new collection is Elysium, replaced by the non-album song, Serenade, which appeared on a now out-of-print compilation CD released in 1998 by Patrick Ogle's[2] Precipice Records.[3]\n\nThe album was originally released on April 28, 2000 on the German label, Accession Records.[4] It was then picked up by American label, Metropolis Records, and re-released in January 2001.[5]\n\nThe \"LSD Mix\" of \"Bittersweet,\" though credited to Love Spirals Downwards, was technically created by Lovespirals[6] in the band's early formative stage.\n\nStarVox Magazine listed Time Again in their Top 10 Staff Favorites of 2001, in a \"tie\" with Lovespirals' Ecstatic EP:\n\nAs synthpop's rise led inexorably to its decline, some Gothic-Industrial artists have started looking toward other avenues of inspiration. On these releases, Lovespirals and Claire Voyant provide tasty illbient and triphop-influenced grooves and give us a harbinger of Goth's Next Big Thing.[7]\n\nThe \"Trancelite Mix\" of Iolite appears on the soundtrack to the 2001 film Gypsy 83.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Iolite\" (Trancelite Mix by Francis A.
