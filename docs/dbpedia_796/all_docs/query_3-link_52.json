The 4 albums are “Addendum” (2001), “Defiance” (2002), “Meta” (2007) and “Bruise” (2012).\n\nAbout Assemblage 23\n\nAssemblage 23 is an American electro act based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. It was founded in 1988 by Tom Shear who writes the music and lyrics and does the recording himself. Prior to starting Assemblage 23, Shear experimented with music under the name Man on a Stage, beginning in the early 1980s. Most of Shear’s music at this point was instrumental, as he lacked the confidence to sing. At the same time, Shear was also playing bass in a live band called the Advocates.\n\nAssemblage 23 was officially born in 1988, after Shear experienced the industrial dance music played by an opening DJ for Depeche Mode. It took until 1998 for Assemblage 23 to attract the attention of record labels.\n\nShear signed a deal in 1999 with the Canadian label Gashed! for a full-length album (“Contempt”, released in November 1999). A second album, Failure, followed in March 2001 and was released by Gashed in North America and Accession Records in Europe.\n\nThe rest is history.\n\nAbout Accession Records\n\nAccession Records is a German independent record label created by Adrian Hates the frontman of the band Diary Of Dreams in 1995. Early in its existence, the label only released Diary Of Dreams albums, but in 1999 the label added other bands."
