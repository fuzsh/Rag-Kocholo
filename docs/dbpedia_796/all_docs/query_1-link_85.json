        "text": "This week's new heavy metal releases include a supergroup, some epic stuff, and more. To the metals…\n\nCategory 7 – Category 7\n\nGenre: Heavy metal/thrash\n\nOrigin: USA\n\nLabel: Metal Blade\n\nBuy now on Bandcamp\n\nOn their debut record super group Category 7 are proving to be a sum of their parts. Plenty of thrash to be had here with Phil Demmel (ex-Vio-Lence) and Jack Gibson (Exodus). Then, some straight up heavy metal from John Bush (Armored Saint) and Mike Orlando (Adrenaline Mob). Finally, crushing drum work from Jason Bittner (Shadows Fall).\n\nDream Evil – Metal Gods\n\nGenre: Power/heavy metal\n\nOrigin: Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nLabel: Century media\n\nBuy now on Bandcamp\n\nThis week is going to be very bombastic, so strap in. Dream Evil's latest is their first album in seven years and it's epic return. The record is a tribute to heavy metal and a proclamation of their own metal-ness?). This is one you'll want to put one before you slay the day.\n\nGhost – Rite Here Rite Now: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n\nGenre: Heavy metal/occult rock\n\nOrigin: Linköping, Sweden\n\nLabel: Loma Vista\n\nBuy now on Bandcamp\n\nRemember how Through The Never had an official soundtrack that was just a live album? Well, save for the song below, this is like that. You're getting seventeen live tracks and a new song. All the standards like \"Square Hammer,\" \"Rats,\" and more are here.\n\nHarvestman – Triptych: Part Two\n\nGenre: Ambient\n\nOrigin: Coeur D'Alene, Idaho\n\nLabel: Neurot\n\nBuy now on Bandcamp\n\nWhile Neurosis remains dormant (dead?) Steve Von Till is once again taking us into nature and some more experimental realms with his Harvestman project. This is more unease via drone, programmed noises, and vibes. This is part two of the Triptych, so be ready for one more.\n\nMountaineer – Dawn and All That Follows\n\nGenre: Doomgaze/post-metal\n\nOrigin: Oakland, California\n\nLabel: A Thousand Arms / Dunk! Records\n\nBuy now on Bandcamp\n\nIf you're a fan of Deftones or Nothing, but wish the leaned further into a doom realm, then this record is for you. Dawn and All That Follows is a crushing and lush record. One for when you want things beautiful and slow.\n\nPowerwolf – Wake Up The Wicked\n\nGenre: Power/heavy metal\n\nOrigin: Saarbrücken, Germany\n\nLabel: Napalm\n\nBuy now on Bandcamp\n\nI promised bombast and somehow this outdoes everything else this week. The time has come to dust off your favorite wolf mask because Powerwolf are back. As always, they are soaring and this time they've got songs about sailing the seven seas, the \"Werewolf of Bedburg\" Peter Stump (Google it. It's fascinating), and more epic shit.\n\nRespire – Hiraeth\n\nGenre: \"Orchestral post-everything\"/blackened screamo\n\nOrigin: Toronto, Ontario\n\nLabel: Dine Alone\n\nBuy now on Bandcamp\n\nA lot going on with this one. Like, just so, so much. I've never heard a band mix the emotion of screamo, with the darkness of black metal, and still make it sound grand and uplifting by way of trumpet, sax, piano, and more. The closest thing I can compare them to is that they're like the blackened version of The Callous Daoboys or maybe Fucked Up.\n\nSummoning The Lich – Under The Reviled Throne\n\nGenre: Technical death metal\n\nOrigin: St. Louis, Missouri\n\nLabel: Prosthetic\n\nBuy now on Bandcamp\n\nLet's take us home with some straight up tech death. Under The Reviled Throne is wall to wall heaviness via pummeling drums, shredding pointy guitars, and low, guttural vocals. This is their second record and their first to feature their new guitarist Muck. This one is for fans of The Black Dahlia Murder, The Faceless, and bands that would employ someone named Muck.\n\nAlso dropping this week…"
