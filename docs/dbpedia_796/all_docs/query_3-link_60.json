        "text": "200 Stab Wounds- Manual Manic Procedures\n\nBy on\n\n200 Stab Wounds is releasing their sophomore effort “Manual Manic Procedures” June 28th. This also marks their first full length release on their new record label Metal Blade Records. They’re one of if not my favorite band from the newer old school death metal revival movement. They’ve never […]\n\nHideous Divinity- Unextinct\n\nBy on\n\nHideous Divinity is back with another stellar effort in “Unextinct” coming out tomorrow March 22nd of 2024. They are one of a few technical death metal bands that can groove really well. One thing the band focused on with this release was atmosphere and they succeeded to say […]\n\nAborted- Vault Of Horrors\n\nBy on\n\nSince the mid 90’s death/grind outfit Aborted has been assaulting your eardrums to the highest degree possible. All this time later in 2024, they’re still out here kicking ass and taking names. Their sound has been a unique brand in the genre maintaining their heaviness but adding some […]\n\nREVIEW: Skeletal Remains – Fragments Of The Ageless (2024, Century Media Records)\n\nBy on\n\nFollowing up their 2020 release, ‘The Entombment Of Chaos’, LA-based Skeletal Remains dropped their latest record on March 8. ‘Fragments Of The Ageless’ is their latest album. With eye-catching art from Dan Seagrave and massive chugging riffs throughout, this album is sure to stay in many people’s rotation […]\n\nFelix Martin- The Gathering\n\nBy on\n\nGuitar virtuoso Felix Martin has graced us again with another sonic and rhythmic experience with his upcoming effort “The Gathering”. It’s scheduled to release March 1st and am completely honored a modern legend let me check out his pending release. His tapping style, rhythm and focus on composition […]\n\nJob For A Cowboy – Moon Healer (2024, Metal Blade Records)\n\nBy on\n\nThe absolutely monolithic symbol of death metal’s advancement, Job For A Cowboy, is back with their newest record (and first since 2014’s ‘Sun Eater’), ‘Moon Healer’. This album sees the band returning in full force, after years of facing the trials of fatherhood, other music projects (such as […]\n\nUnburier- Nebulous\n\nBy on\n\nUK modern death metal band Unburier is releasing their EP “Nebulous” February 23rd. It’s a nice, compact 4 song effort with a lot to offer. It’s heavy, a little melodic at times, some solid rhythms and a diverse vocalist. Unburier brings the pain, fury and brutality quickly on […]\n\nDeathless- The Clairvoyant\n\nBy on\n\nMelodic Tech Death is a bit lost in me these days since I started this in 2018. I fell out with tech death, to an extent, since last year. Every now and then bands pop up and give me hope they’re not a necro-clone. Nashville’s Deathless is all […]\n\nExocrine- Legend\n\nBy on\n\nExocrine drew me in with their debut album “Unreal Existence” in 2015 and have only gotten better since then. Their upcoming offering “Legend” is releasing on January 26th with more experiments and wild musicianship. They’re a wildly underrated band in tech death and deserve a ton more notoriety […]"
