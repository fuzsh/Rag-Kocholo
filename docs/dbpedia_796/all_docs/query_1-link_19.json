        "text": "One of the most productive and engaging partnerships in contemporary music began as a fortuitous accident 25 years ago, when rockin' Texas bluesman Smokin' Joe Kubek began jamming with jazz-loving Louisiana soulman Bnois King. On September 17 the pair will release their 17th album, \"Road Dogs' Life\" on the Delta Groove label, the latest chapter in a collaboration that has produced some of the most exciting, genre-crossing contemporary blues anywhere, since their 1989 decision to join forces.\n\nBut first, Smokin' Joe Kubek and Bnois King and their band will be performing on Sunday's edition of the North River Blues Festival at the Marshfield Fair, playing from roughly 4:30-6:00 p.m. There is a full noon-to-8 p.m. music lineup in both Saturday's and Sunday's edition of the fest, and on both days, festival admission is free with admission to the fair.\n\nBack in 1989, Kubek was working with his own band trying to eke out a living playing around Dallas. Despite an early start that found him playing in Freddie King's band at age 19, and later sitting in with legends like Albert King, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, the mid-and-late-1980s hadn't been particularly good to the guitarist. Bnois King, after also performing with a litany of Lousiana music titans, had moved to Texas, where he too was toiling away with his own band, scuffling for gigs wherever they could.\n\n\"Neither one of us was really doing great,\" Kubek recalled this week, from his Texas home. \"We were both kind of taking whatever gig we could get, and often playing for the door. I was playing this Monday night gig at Poor Daniel's Pub in Dallas, and Bnois stopped in, so I invited him up onstage. We knew each other, and had heard each other's bands. He ended up staying up there jamming with me all night, and the chemistry was immediate. We began doing every Monday night there at Poor Daniel's, and then started going out and playing other spots like Antone's in Austin, and Joey's in Tulsa. After about two years like that, we got a record deal..and we've been doing it ever since.\"\n\nThe contrasts in the two men's styles works marvelously, as both are capable of dazzlingly inventive solos, while maintaining a coherent melodic thread--their guitars tell stories, or expand and enhance the stories in their lyrics. Perhaps an old quote from Kubek describes it best: \"I pull the blues out of him, and he pulls the jazz out of me.\"\n\nLike many young people of a certain generation, Kubek was a teenage rock 'n' roll fan who came to the blues through curiosity about his pop idols. He never took a guitar lesson, but doggedly taught himself to play.\n\n\"I am self-taught, totally,\" Kubek laughed. \"Back then it was real hard to get anybody to show you anything, and we didn't have stuff available online like we do today. I remember I had a fifty-cent chord book that I was studying, but I seemed to be doing them all wrong, playing this cheap guitar I had bought at the local auto store. One day I came home from school, and suddenly I got 'em all right, it all clicked for me. Somehow I figured out how to connect the head to the heart, and I was off and running.\"\n\n\"I fell in love with The Beatles as a first-grader,\" said Kubek, 56, \"after seeing them on Sunday night tv--probably the Ed Sullivan Show. I began trying to find out about all kinds of music--I love it all, but my calling is to play the blues. When I began hearing stuff like Cream or Jeff Beck, I realized they were often doing re-worked blues songs. Like Jeff Beck's \"I Ain't Superstitious\" was an old blues number, and when Cream did \"Strange Brew,\" that's basically a 1-4-5 blues with Eric Clapton copying the solo from Albert King's \"Crosscut Saw.\" I really got into the blues, the old vinyl records.\"\n\n\"Howlin' Wolf had passed on by the time I began playing out,\" Kubek added, citing one of his early musical idols. \"But I did get to jam with Albert King one time in 1976, at a South Dallas club. That was a pretty cool moment I will never forget.\"\n\nPretty quickly after joining forces, Kubek and Bnois King realized they would have to come up with new music if they wanted to have a successful recording career. There are obviously plenty of blues bands out there, and most of them are surveying the same cover songs, but bringing a modern day perspective to the classic form is a tall task. Rock 'n' roll dynamics combined with blues elements has been a bedrock for contemporary music, from Jimi Hendrix to Stevie Ray Vaughan to newer groups like Alabama Shakes. Obviously the Kubek-King alliance had that force, along with King's jazzier soul side, but framing their sound with lyrics a younger, modern audience could relate to was another thing altogether.\n\n\"We were essentially forced into writing songs, if we wanted to get some records made,\" Kubek said with a soft chuckle. \"Now, 25 years later, we're still just a couple of guitar pickers trying to figure out how to write songs. Basically, Bnois writes the lyrics and I do the music. Our inspirations come from everywhere around us, and most of it is pretty real, not made up. One tune on the new album, which has (Fabulous Thunderbirds singer) Kim Wilson trading verses with Bnois, is about being stuck in a grocery store, waiting in line with this big pile of frozen dinners, because you have no woman at home to cook for you. That's a real experience for a lot of us, and most of lour songs are like that--based on our experiences. On that one, we take a little truth, put a Chuck Berry groove behind it, and tell the story.\"\n\n\"The hardest part of writing our own songs for 17 albums now, is just not ripping ourselves off,\" Kubek added. \"We might figure we have a great idea for a new song, until something sounds a little too familiar, and we realize, we did that one a few years back.\"\n\nSince their 1991 debut, \"Steppin' Out Texas Style,\" Kubek and King have been several labels, including the genre's best. Their national profile really began with their initial label, Bullseye Blues, the blues imprint of Cambridge's Rounder Records family, which the duo called home until 2000. They released another three albums between 2003-2006 on San Francisco's vaunted Blind Pig label, and then delivered two superb albums for Chicago's acclaimed Alligator Records label in 2008 & 2010. Delta Groove, which also released last year's unplugged, acoustic-centered \"Close to the Bone\" CD, now feels like home with its roster of mostly Southern and Western r&b acts.\n\n\"I still love Marian (Leighton) and everybody at Rounder,\" said Kubek, \"because they really got us started out there, and touring nationally. But we've had good experiences with most of these record companies. It's a real pleasure right now to be working with Randy at Delta Groove, which gives us all kinds of freedom to do our thing.\"\n\nNo doubt the landscape has changed for touring bands over the past 25 years Kubek and King have been together, and summer festivals are a rare treat in more ways than one.\n\n\"Festivals are about the only time we get an opportunity to hear other bands' music,\" said Kubek. \"In this business, you tend to spend the majority of your life inside a vehicle, or on a plane, if you're not onstage, so you kind of wonder what everyone else is up to. Festivals also give you a chance to see some people you haven't seen in a long time, which is also a cool part of it. We played a previous Marshfield blues fest, probably in the early 2000s, anmd it was a great time. New England is a great place to tour, because people up there are really into the artistry of the music, so it's a lot of fun to play for them.\"\n\nOn the club scene, Kubek and King have played the old House of Blues, at its original Harvard Square location, and also frequently swing through Chan's in Woonsocket, but Boston-area shows are rare.\n\n\"I love playing at John Chan's place,\" said Kubek. \"But really, there's a true appreciation for the blues, and music in general, up there in the northeast, and everybody treats us very well.\"\n\n\"It's been strange at times watching the ways the music scene has changed,\" said Kubek. \"Places we thought we'd be playing for years are suddenly gone. The main thing is that your routing may have to change, and your anchor dates are different these days. We might have to drive from Dallas to New York State to start a tour, for instance, and then we'd typically have a bunch of dates within relatively short distances. But when that tour ends, we might find ourselves driving home, from Maine to Texas. That's as opposed to the early 1990s, when we'd just drive to Oklahoma to open a tour, and then spend the rest of it driving three-to-five hours a day across the country, because the gigs were just that far apart. Today they're all over the map.\"\n\n\"There are absolutely less weekday gigs available,\" Kubek noted. \"Even if there are some weekday shows, you're still bouncing everywhere--you used to be able to line up gigs that made sense for routing. We also find we're spending much more on travel, and hotels. But, you just have to roll with the punches and it all works out.\"\n\nThe flip side of the new reality is that the internet makes the band available to anyone with a computer, and they can arrive in new touring territory and often find plenty of fans eager to hear them.\n\n\"Oh yes we have found lots of new gigs, and they frequently surprise us,\" Kubek said. \"We might get in to a Tuesday night show in Iowa, in the middle of all the cornfields where it doesn't look like there's anything around, and we've never played before, and we find out the place is packed with people that all know us. It's crazy like that. Another thing is that since the typical blues audience now is not 19-20 years old, a lot of the shows don't start at 10 or 11 p.m. anymore. These days, most of our fans have responsibilites and families, so the most successful shows can start from anywhere from 5 p.m. to about 7 p.m.. Those kind of events really seem to work out well, where folks can hear you play, and get home early, and go to work the next day.\"\n\nIn perhaps another sign of the new era for music, Kubek has also released an instructional video, \"Smokin' Blues Guitar,\" to teach future generations how he does it. For Kubek, that wasn't exactly easy.\n\n\"I had no idea how I was going to do that!\" Kubek laughed. \"Here I am, self-taught, trying to explain guitar playing to everyone else. It was pretty scary. Hal Leonard asked me to do that, and Dave Rubin is really the guy who helped me put it all together. I would demonstrate something, and then Dave would write out the tablature, the notes and the chordings, and get it all organized. It was finally a lot of fun doing that, but I had a lot of help.\"\n\nNORTH RIVER BLUES FESTIVAL SCHEDULES\n\nSATURDAY: 12:15: Mr Nick's Dirty Tricks\n\n1:30 Gracie Curran's High Falutin' Band\n\n3:00 Sugar Ray Norcia & the Bluetones\n\n4:30 Eden Brent\n\n6:00 Mississippi Heat\n\nbetween sets, second stage Tim Gartland Band\n\nSUNDAY\n\n12:15 Mission of Blues\n\n1:30 Willie J.
