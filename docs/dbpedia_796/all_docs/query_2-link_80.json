        "text": "In a Harper's Bazaar cover story interview, Lana Del Rey said the simplicity of her home works as an \"accidental\" litmus test for relationships. One of her ex-boyfriends wasn't a fan.\n\nLana Del Rey cited a previous partner’s ego and his distaste for her home as reasons for a recent breakup.\n\nIn a Harper's Bazaar cover story interview published Tuesday, the “Say Yes to Heaven” singer explained how the simplicity of her home works as an \"accidental\" litmus test for relationships. She said her ex-boyfriend was among those who didn't care for it.\n\n“They didn’t get it,” Del Rey told the magazine. “That one shocked me. I won’t name names and whatever, but that one really shocked me, that person. That was actually the end of a relationship.”\n\nCurrently single, the Grammy-nominated artist said her ex also did not understand why she found her sold-out show at an Arkansas amphitheater to be a career-defining moment.\n\n“There was something going on with them, like a little bubble ego,\" she said. See, I don’t get to have one anymore. It’s been smashed to … what do you call it? Smithereens.\"\n\nMars Williams dies: Saxophonist of the Psychedelic Furs and Liquid Soul, was 68\n\nLana Del Rey sees a clairvoyant weekly\n\nDel Rey also revealed to Harper's that she sees a trusted clairvoyant named Tessa DiPietro on a weekly basis.\n\nAt a guided meditation, Del Rey was asked to describe what shape her thoughts look like, DiPietro told the outlet when sharing her favorite moment with the musician.\n\n“And we come around to Lana, and she’s looking into space and thinking, and then she says, ‘Men. My thoughts are all shaped like men,'” DiPietro said. “It was so perfect because you couldn’t tell if she was being ironic or not. And yet it was the most truthful answer anybody had given.”\n\nBillie Eilish: Singer reveals to Lana Del Rey she saw viral TikTok 'about how I'm a horrible person'\n\nLana Del Rey defends original version of Taylor Swift collab\n\nDuring a video interview with the magazine, Del Rey said the original version of her “Snow on the Beach” collaboration with Taylor Swift was perfect.\n\nThe “Midnights” track initially left fans disappointed by the lack of vocals from the singer when the album premiered last year. A new version of the track featuring extended vocals called “Snow On The Beach (Feat. More Lana Del Rey)” dropped in May as part of another deluxe version of the album.\n\n“That was actually the song Taylor wanted me to sing on. If I think someone’s song is perfect, I will act as a producer in it,” Del Rey said. “I can mimic almost anyone, so I am all over the first version of ‘Snow on the Beach.’ I layer and match her vocals perfectly, so you would never even know that I was completely all over that first song. She wanted me to sing the whole thing, but if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”\n\nLana Del Rey has same ‘Paradise’ tattoo as Adele\n\nWhile answering trivia questions about her career, the singer correctly guessed which singer has the same tattoo as she does. She and Adele both have the word “paradise\" written on the sides of their hands.\n\n“I think we must have been on the same wavelength,” Del Rey said. “That’s actually a cool little connection. I like that. She’s amazing.”"
