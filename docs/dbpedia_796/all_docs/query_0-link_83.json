        "text": "Andrea De Witt: s/t\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: Andrea De Witt\n\nTitle: s/t\n\nFormat: Download Only (MP3 + Lossless)\n\nLabel: Undogmatisch (@)\n\nRated:\n\nThe debut album is generally momentous occasion for any artist — a chance to lay bare one’s soul, to offer up a piece of oneself to the cruel, indifferent world. Or, in the case of Andrea De Witt’s self-titled release, to scrawl one’s innermost thoughts onto the canvas of sound in the hope that someone out there, someone, might find meaning in it all.\n\nLet’s start with the basics. De Witt is actually not a newcomer to the scene — he’s been lurking in the shadows (or maybe the dim lights) for years, collaborating with the likes of the Technophonic Chamber Orchestra and contributing to Mirco Magnani’s conceptual projects. But here, on his first full-length outing, he steps out of the background and into the spotlight, albeit with all the fanfare of a ghostly whisper.\n\nThe album presents itself as a kind of musical diary, with each track titled after a date or a cryptic phrase, suggesting moments in time captured in sound. But don’t expect these sonic snapshots to be vivid or easily decipherable. De Witt’s compositions are more like faded Polaroids found in an old shoebox—mysterious, slightly out of focus, and tinged with nostalgia for something you can’t quite remember.\n\nTake “MAI 5”, for instance, the album’s opener. It meanders through a landscape of arrhythmic loops and rudimentary MIDI, like a malfunctioning music box slowly winding down. There’s a sense of intimacy here, as if we’re eavesdropping on De Witt’s private musings, but the emotional impact is elusive, slipping through your fingers just as you think you’ve grasped it.\n\nAnd then there’s “JUN 4”, a brief but poignant piece that feels like the sonic equivalent of staring out of a rain-streaked window. The treated voices and minimalist piano lines suggest a yearning for connection, yet the track ends before that connection is ever made, leaving you with a sense of unresolved longing.\n\nIf there’s one thing that unifies these disparate tracks, it’s their refusal to conform to traditional structures. De Witt seems more interested in capturing fleeting moments of inspiration than in crafting polished, radio-ready songs. It’s an approach that will no doubt frustrate some listeners — those who prefer their music with a clear beginning, middle, and end — but for others, it’s precisely this spontaneity that gives the album its charm.\n\nOne of the more intriguing moments comes with “PIANOCHROM M”, where De Witt lets his piano take center stage, albeit in a deconstructed, almost disembodied form. The notes are stretched and distorted, like echoes reverberating through a long-abandoned ballroom. There’s something eerily beautiful about it, a ghostly waltz that’s both comforting and unsettling in equal measure.\n\nThe three-part suite “OCT X”, “OCT Y”, and “OCT Z” marks the album’s emotional core, if you can call it that. These tracks delve deeper into De Witt’s psyche, exploring themes of memory, loss, and perhaps even a touch of existential dread. The sonic dilations and arrhythmic patterns here suggest a mind grappling with the passage of time, trying to make sense of a world that’s constantly shifting beneath its feet.\n\nBut just when you think you’ve got a handle on things, De Witt throws you a curveball with “SETTING 7”, a minute-long interlude that feels like the album’s equivalent of a commercial break. It’s an odd, almost jarring inclusion, yet it somehow fits within the album’s fractured logic.\n\nThe closer, “AMB 523”, brings things to a fittingly ambiguous conclusion. It’s a track that defies easy interpretation, leaving you with more questions than answers. And perhaps that’s the point — De Witt’s music isn’t here to provide clarity, but to invite you into his world of half-formed thoughts and fleeting emotions.\n\nComparisons to other artists are inevitable, of course. There’s a hint of William Basinski’s decaying loops here, a dash of Tim Hecker’s fractured soundscapes there. But De Witt’s music feels less about influence and more about personal expression. It’s not trying to be part of a scene or fit into a particular genre; it’s simply the sound of an artist documenting his inner life, however messy or imperfect that might be.\n\nEgil Kalman: Forest of Tines: Egil Kalman Plays the Buchla 200\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: Egil Kalman (@)\n\nTitle: Forest of Tines: Egil Kalman Plays the Buchla 200\n\nFormat: 12\" x 2\n\nLabel: iDEAL\n\nRated:\n\nEgil Kalman’s \"Forest of Tines\" - one of releases that I missed, after getting buried by a plenty of promo releases - isn’t so much an album as it is a sonic séance, a chance to commune with the spirit of Don Buchla and the ghostly echoes of the EMS studios in Stockholm. If you're looking for something that will gently accompany your morning coffee, this isn't it. Kalman’s follow-up to his \"Kingdom of Bells\" feels more like the soundtrack to a David Lynch fever dream, conjured from the depths of a modular labyrinth where time and space seem to fold in on themselves.\n\nLet’s start with the Buchla 200, the storied beast of an instrument that dominates this album. For the uninitiated, the Buchla 200 is not your everyday synth — it’s an analog behemoth with a will of its own, and Kalman, rather than taming it, seems content to let it run wild. You can almost hear the Buchla’s circuits sighing with relief as they’re finally given the freedom to stretch out after years of being cooped up in EMS's vaults. The result is a collection of tracks that oscillate between the hypnotic and the unsettling, with Kalman’s skillful touch guiding the machine through its paces without ever fully imposing his will on it.\n\n“Diffused”, the album’s opener, eases you in gently, like stepping into a warm bath of just-tuned drones. But before you can get too comfortable, “Glint” follows with a flurry of pointillistic improvisations, each note like a sudden glimmer of light in a dark forest. Kalman’s approach here is meticulous, yet there’s an underlying spontaneity that keeps you on your toes. It’s as if he’s coaxing the Buchla into revealing its secrets one by one, but only when it’s good and ready.\n\nAnd then there’s “Blageten”, a traditional Scandinavian folk tune that Kalman somehow manages to fit into this digital dystopia without it feeling out of place. It’s a brief but poignant reminder of Kalman’s roots, a glimpse of the past that’s quickly swallowed up by the towering trees of the \"Forest of Tines\". The title track, “Forest of Tines”, feels like the album’s dark heart — its oscillating tones and eerie reverb suggesting something ancient and untamable lurking just beneath the surface.\n\nBut the album isn’t all gloom and doom. There are moments of genuine beauty, like the shimmering “Autumn Leaves”, where the Buchla’s tones seem to hang in the air like the last rays of sunlight on a crisp fall evening. And then there’s “Dub One”, a track that nods to Kalman’s love of hypnotic ostinatos, its repetitive patterns slowly building into a kind of meditative trance.\n\nYet for all its sonic variety, \"Forest of Tines\" is a remarkably cohesive album, each track flowing into the next like chapters in a strange, otherworldly novel. Even the shorter pieces, like the minute-long “Electric Music Box pt. 1”, feel essential to the album’s narrative arc. Kalman’s decision to record everything live, without any overdubs, only adds to the album’s sense of immediacy. You can hear the Buchla in all its raw, untamed glory — no post-production tricks, no glossy veneer, just pure, unfiltered sound.\n\nComparisons could be drawn to the work of Morton Subotnick or Suzanne Ciani, both of whom have explored the Buchla’s unique sound world, but Kalman’s approach feels distinctly his own. There’s a deep reverence for the instrument’s history here, but also a willingness to push it into new and uncharted territories. Where Subotnick’s \"Silver Apples of the Moon\" was all about controlled chaos, Kalman seems more interested in the spaces between the notes, in the textures and tones that linger in the air like smoke after a fire.\n\nBut for all its technical prowess and avant-garde posturing, \"Forest of Tines\" is also an intensely emotional record. There’s a melancholic undertone that runs through the album, a sense of longing for something just out of reach. Tracks like “7th” and “From Stone” feel almost elegiac, their sparse melodies evoking a kind of deep, existential sadness that’s hard to shake.\n\nAnd then there’s the final track, “Ocquet”, which closes the album on a note of quiet resignation. It’s a fitting end to a record that feels like a journey through a forest of sound, each track a different path leading deeper into the unknown. By the time the last notes fade away, you’re left with the sense that you’ve been somewhere strange and beautiful, a place that exists just on the edge of reality. Kalman has created something truly special here—a record that honors the legacy of the Buchla 200 while also forging its own path.\n\nDaniel Lentz: Lips\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: Daniel Lentz\n\nTitle: Lips\n\nFormat: Download Only (MP3 + Lossless)\n\nLabel: Unseen Worlds (@)\n\nRated:\n\nDaniel Lentz’s \"Lips\" is the kind of album that sneaks up on you, wrapping itself around your senses like the lingering fog over a California coastline. It’s a compilation of works from 1965 to 1989, an era when Lentz was absorbing the sights, sounds, and cultures of California, much like a sponge left too long in the ocean. The results are a collection of pieces that simultaneously disorient and captivate, pushing the boundaries of what music can be—often frustratingly so, but always with purpose.\n\nRight from the opening track, “North American Eclipse”, it’s clear that Lentz isn’t interested in holding your hand through this experience. This 20-minute epic, recorded in a Stockholm church of all places, draws from the ritual dances of the Seneca people, using vocal loops, bone rasps, and small bells to create a soundscape that feels like a disintegrating echo of a long-lost culture. Lentz’s fascination with fragmented phonemes takes center stage here, each syllable hanging in the air like a question mark, demanding to be answered but never quite resolving. The effect is both haunting and disorienting, like watching a solar eclipse through the eyes of someone who’s never seen the sun.\n\n“Song(s) of the Sirens”, composed in 1973, is perhaps the most emblematic of Lentz’s style during this period. The piece captures the essence of his California years — looped vocals, broken texts, and a harmonic language that flirts with both the sensual and the surreal. Lentz sets fragments of Homer’s tale of Odysseus and the Sirens to music that feels as if it’s been plucked from the breeze off the Pacific. There’s a dreamy quality here, but it’s not the kind of dream you want to wake up from; rather, it’s one where you’re content to float along, letting the music’s layers wash over you like gentle waves. The clarinet melody that emerges toward the end ties everything together in a way that’s almost too neat for Lentz—but then again, maybe that’s the point. In Lentz’s world, even chaos has its own kind of order.\n\nThe real emotional gut punch comes with “Requiem, In Memoriam Wolfgang Stoerchle – Songs in a Medieval Manner”. This isn’t just a piece of music; it’s a eulogy for a friend, an exploration of grief wrapped in the sounds of wine glasses, kalimbas, and harps. Lentz eschews his usual loops here, opting instead for a more straightforward (for him) vocal arrangement that allows the personal nature of the tribute to shine through. It’s a deeply moving piece, one that highlights Lentz’s ability to channel raw emotion into something ethereal and otherworldly. The use of Latin texts from the Requiem Mass only adds to the sense of timelessness, as if Lentz is reaching back through history to find comfort in the rituals of the past.\n\nThen there’s “Talk Radio”, a piece that feels as much a product of its time as it does a reflection of Lentz’s environment. Composed in 1989, near the end of Lentz’s Californian period, this track is a chaotic collage of the sounds of Los Angeles—AM radio chatter, freeway noise, and snippets of early music all thrown into the mix like ingredients in a particularly avant-garde stew. It’s a piece that captures the frenetic energy of LA’s highways, the kind of thing you’d expect to hear while stuck in traffic, scrolling through radio stations as the city’s smog settles in around you. There’s a certain brilliance to this chaos, a reflection of Lentz’s ability to find beauty in the most unlikely places.\n\nBut if \"Lips\" has a centerpiece, it’s “Uitoto”, a sprawling 25-minute piece inspired by the creation story of the Uitoto people of Colombia and Peru. This is Lentz at his most expansive, using layers of piano arpeggios to create a soundscape that’s as vast and unfathomable as the Pacific Ocean itself. The gradual shift in harmony, combined with the hypnotic repetition of the loops, gives the piece a sense of inevitability, as if the music is slowly drawing you back to some primordial state. The voice that enters halfway through is like a guide through this soundscape, reciting the creation story before dissolving into the very fabric of the music. It’s a stunning piece, one that encapsulates Lentz’s ability to blend the ancient with the modern, the concrete with the abstract.\n\nBut of course, \"Lips\" wouldn’t be complete without the oddball outlier that is “Fünke”. This 1965 piece, composed before Lentz’s Californian days, is a strange beast — part bebop, part serialism, with a dash of Stockhausen thrown in for good measure. It’s an early example of Lentz’s obsession with “music as becoming”, a piece that only reveals its true nature with its final note. In the context of the rest of the album, it feels like a glimpse into the mad scientist’s laboratory before he found his true calling. It’s a piece that stands apart from the rest of \"Lips\", yet somehow, it fits—a reminder that even in the most experimental of artists, certain tendencies are always there from the start.\n\nIn the end, \"Lips\" is an album that demands to be experienced rather than simply listened to. It’s a journey through Daniel Lentz’s world, one that’s as much about the people and landscapes of California as it is about the music itself. It’s not an easy journey — there are moments of disorientation, confusion, and even frustration — but for those willing to take the plunge, it’s one that’s richly rewarding. \"Lips\" is music in a state of becoming, constantly shifting and evolving, much like the landscape that inspired it. And in that sense, it’s a perfect encapsulation of Lentz’s artistic vision—chaotic, beautiful, and utterly unique.\n\nBlack Decelerant: Reflections Vol. 2\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: Black Decelerant\n\nTitle: Reflections Vol. 2\n\nFormat: LP\n\nLabel: RVNG Intl. (@)\n\nRated:\n\nHere we are, diving into the swirling, meditative depths of \"Reflections Vol. 2: Black Decelerant\", an album that feels like the sonic equivalent of staring into the abyss — and finding the abyss staring right back. Khari Lucas (aka Contour) and Omari Jazz, the architects behind Black Decelerant, have gifted us with a work that’s as dense as it is delicate, as abstract as it is intentional. It’s an album that begs you to sit down, slow down, and confront some big questions — whether you want to or not.\n\nLet’s not mince words here: this isn’t easy listening. But then again, what did you expect from a project that takes its name from an article about the intersection of Accelerationism and Black ontology? If you’re coming to \"Reflections Vol. 2\" looking for catchy hooks or toe-tapping rhythms, you’ve wandered into the wrong neighborhood. This is music for those who like their jazz served with a side of existential dread and a dash of ontological inquiry.\n\nTake \"two\", the album’s first single and perhaps its most accessible track, if only because it’s the one that clocks in at a digestible two and a half minutes. Here, Jawwaad Taylor’s spectral trumpet improvisations float above a tundra of resonant signals and weathers, creating an eerie, otherworldly atmosphere that feels like it could dissolve at any moment. It’s a track that encapsulates the album’s ethos perfectly: a meditation on Black being and non-being, life and mourning, all wrapped up in a freeform jazz improvisation that somehow manages to be both disorienting and comforting.\n\nBut let’s not get too comfortable. The rest of the album takes you on a journey that’s as challenging as it is rewarding. Tracks like \"one\" and \"three\" unfold slowly, layering liquefied piano keys and bubbly bass lines over a bed of modulated soundscapes that feel both vast and intimate. It’s music that refuses to be rushed, demanding that you meet it on its own terms. And just when you think you’ve found your footing, along comes \"seven 1/2\", a brief, one-minute interlude that feels like a glimpse into some parallel universe where time has no meaning.\n\nLucas and Jazz have made it clear that this album was born out of a time of great existential stress, both personal and political. And it shows. \"Reflections Vol. 2\" is an album that grapples with some heavy themes — anti-Blackness, encroaching fascism, the very nature of existence itself — and yet, it never feels overwrought or self-indulgent. Instead, it’s a study in restraint, in using improvisation not as a way to show off, but as a means of exploration, of asking questions rather than providing answers.\n\nComparisons to other artists feel almost beside the point here, but if you must draw some lines, think of the spiritual jazz explorations of Pharoah Sanders, the ambient soundscapes of Brian Eno, or even the more esoteric corners of Sun Ra’s discography. But even these comparisons don’t quite capture what’s happening on \"Reflections Vol. 2\", because this is an album that exists very much in its own space, its own time — one that Lucas and Jazz have meticulously crafted for us to inhabit, even if only for a little while. They're maybe making in nu jazz territories what LTJ Bukem managed to do in the ones of drum'n'bass many years ago.\n\nIt’s worth noting, too, that this album is part of RVNG Intl.’s \"Reflections\" series, which is all about contemporary collaborations that push boundaries and challenge conventions. In that context, Black Decelerant fits right in, offering a work that’s both deeply rooted in tradition and utterly forward-thinking. This isn’t just music for the here and now; it’s music that’s reaching out towards some future we can’t quite see yet.\n\nSo, what’s the takeaway from \"Reflections Vol. 2\"? It’s not an album that’s going to give you easy answers, or even easy listening. But it is an album that’s going to make you think, make you feel, and maybe, just maybe, make you a little more aware of the world around you—and the worlds within you. And really, isn’t that what music is supposed to do? And in a world that’s increasingly obsessed with speed, with productivity, with doing more, there’s something radical, something almost revolutionary, about an album that asks you to slow down, to listen, and to reflect. \"Reflections Vol. 2\" is an invitation to do just that. Whether you accept it or not is up to you."
