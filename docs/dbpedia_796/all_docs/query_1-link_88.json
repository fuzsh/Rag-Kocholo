        "text": "The latest EP from ultra-talented singer/songwriter Lily Meola offers a fresh take on her heartfelt pop songs with more of an Americana and country vibe to them on Heartbreak Rodeo. Leading up to the release of her latest record, Meola showcased her depth as an artist with several key singles like the vulnerable break-up anthem “Without You,” the self-reflection found on “Over the Moon,” and the personal song about her mother who passed away on “Postcards to Heaven.” Heartbreak Rodeo leans heavily into the country genre and still has that unique charm that Meola commands in her warm vocal presence. Lily Meola shared, “Each song I write is like a therapy session for me. Making music is the way I respond to whatever is happening to me, and my goal is to help people feel a little less alone, whether they’re going through a breakup or grieving the loss of someone.” Living through her personal experiences offers Meola a unique perspective on the world, and yet she manages to make each song universally appealing and relatable.\n\nRead More “Lily Meola – Heartbreak Rodeo”\n\nI think Iâd been waiting for it.\n\nButch Walker released Letters, his second full-length album as a solo artist, on August 24, 2004, two weeks before I started eighth grade. At the time, I was right in the middle of a burgeoning obsession with soundtracking every moment of my life. Music had always mattered to me, but something had clicked during the previous school year and songs had taken on a different level of meaning for me since then. Before, I maybe just liked the way something sounded on the radio. Now, I was falling in love with the way those songs could encapsulate the rhythms of my days and nights. I figured: if movies and TV shows had soundtracks, why shouldnât my life have one too? And so Iâd spent months making mixes for everything: for the end of seventh grade, for my summer vacation, for my familyâs annual summer road trip to visit my grandparents in New Hampshire, and for the impending end of the season and all the bittersweet emotions that made me feel.\n\nWhat I hadnât done yet was make a mix for a girl. I wasnât too familiar with the concept of mixtapes â with what a collection of songs could mean when you picked the tracks and sequenced them and packaged them for someone you felt romantic feelings for. Surely, I would have found my way to the art of mixtape-ology no matter what, as all music fans do. How long can you obsess over using music to encapsulate your own internal life before you start thinking about how music can play the role of confessional love note? Probably not long. Before I could get there on my own, though, I found my Jedi Master on the subject of mixtapes, and it changed my entire life.\n\nRead More “Butch Walker – Letters”\n\nThere’s a comforting feeling in Jade Lilitri’s voice that everything can turn out to be okay. Much like a warm embrace through the speakers, Oso Oso have returned with their latest studio effort titled Life Till Bones. Lilitri opens the band’s fifth album with “Many Ways,” a somber reminder of mortality as he still grapples with the loss of his past guitarist, Tavish Maloney. The opening lyrics of, “I love you, but life is a gun / Do you remember when you used to have fun? / Keep in my mind when you turn to run / There are no ‘directions’, there is only one,” are well-crafted and hit their intended tone as each piano key echoes in the mix. The production on this LP by Billy Mannino is top notch throughout, and he puts the right emphasis on each lyric, guitar chord, and percussion to get the most out of each track. Oso Oso are the kings of lo-fi emo rock and they wear their crowns proudly on Life Till Bones.\n\nRead More “Oso Oso – Life Till Bones”"
