        "text": "Third Eye Blind do not get the credit they deserve. I will repeat: Third Eye Blind – the “Semi Charmed Life” guys – do not get the credit they deserve. If I say the words “Nineties Band,” nine times out of ten, the first band that will come to anyone born between 1973 and 1993 will likely be Third Eye Blind. But that entire conceit is deeply flawed, as Third Eye Blind are somewhat of a nineties anomaly.\n\nFirst off, to me, “Nineties Band” barely counts for a band that’s debut was released in 1997 and the follow-up basically in 2000. Second, Third Eye Blind are the one band from this era who has never taken the nostalgia bait. Okay, they did one 20th anniversary tour for their classic debut, but they/frontman Stephen Jenkins, specifically, have actively rejected nostalgia every step of the way, with Jenkins going out of his way time and time again to vocalize his complete and utter disdain for nostalgia. Far from staples at nineties nostalgia tours like Everclear’s “Summerland,” Sugar Ray’s “Under The Sun” or Barenaked Ladies’ “Last Summer On Earth,” they play Bonnaroo.\n\nAnd it doesn’t feel strange! In the “Spotify era,” they have put out four fantastic releases – 2015’s Dopamine (containing my favorite 3EB song, “Something In You“), 2016’s phenomenal EP We Are Drugs, 2018’s batshit covers EP Thanks For Everything and 2019’s true modern update, Screamer – and these records have introduced Third Eye Blind to a completely new generation of fans who don’t care as much about the merits of “Never Let You Go,” “Crystal Baller” and “Semi Charmed Life.” And I think that their ability to navigate the annals of music history can be traced back to one thing.\n\nOn November 23, 1999, Third Eye Blind released their sophomore album Blue, a rollicking, sling-shotting, shredding, bubblegum tour-de-force that is just downright weird, yet wound up setting the tone for the rest of their career. But it is precisely because of this that I make the grand statement that graces this article’s header: I think Blue is the most interesting sophomore album from a mainstream band in the last 25 years. There. I said it. Now here’s the thing about me saying this. Blue is also my least favorite Third Eye Blind album. The one I come back to far-and-away the least. It is incredibly front-loaded – an argument that could also be made for their debut – it is long, and is almost – with one major exception – completely devoid of typical pop structure, giving it a total air of inaccessibility. However, Blue contains a bizarre, inherent polarity in that what I perceive to be its weaknesses, are actually, in fact, its strengths, and the reasons why I think so highly of it in the pantheon of sophomore albums. And despite the 3EB album I come back to the least, I still find it better than most artists’ best work.\n\nOver the course of Blue‘s 13 tracks (I am counting “Slow Motion” – more on that later), three are over five minutes and three more come close; it goes all over the place in tone and pace and feel and yet, somehow feels uniquely Third Eye Blind and oddly cohesive. But if it had come from any other band, it would be dismissed as hedonistic garbage. But it is very much a Third Eye Blind album. It’s just…weird. Nevertheless, I am utterly fascinated by it.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I love a good weird album from a mainstream artist. The first entry in this website’s “Memory Lapsed” section – the corner of JiveWrites where I write about overlooked and forgotten gems in artists discographies – is U2’s Pop, an album I will forever defend. I have also expressed genuine love and admiration for Smashing Pumpkins’ Machina: The Machines of God. So why do I love a good weird album? Because when done right (Blue), it can completely buck preconceptions and introduce listeners to a depth and ability for organic growth that was not previously apparent. When done wrong (Panic At The Disco’s Pretty.Odd – another I’ve touched on), it comes off as self-indulgent and overcompensating.\n\nSo how could Third Eye Blind even be allowed to make an album like Blue while in the strict confines of the pop-driven, major label system? Here’s how: Third Eye Blind were huge. In 1997-1998, they were everywhere, and came out of the gate stronger on their debut than any band in recent memory. Think about it. With very little clout, Third Eye Blind, led by frontman/taskmaster-general Stephan Jenkins, strong-armed their way into a huge record deal with Elektra Records and, in their first few years alone, opened up for both Oasis and U2. Oh yeah, and another small band called The Rolling Stones. That is objectively insane. But, frankly, when you think about it, this was the nineties. The music industry practically printed money, and Third Eye Blind ran a decent printing press in the form of their stone-cold-classic self-titled debut album, which wound up selling over six million copies in the States alone. For a band who wound up producing three bonafide, lifelong, multi-generational mega-hit singles – “Jumper,” “How’s It Gonna Be” & the aforementioned “Semi-Charmed Life” (not to mention songs like “Motorcycle Drive By,” “Graduate” and “Losing A Whole Year,” which have taken on lives of their own) – this kind of skyrocketing success was indeed possible.\n\nWhat set Third Eye Blind apart from contemporaries such as Gin Blossoms, Collective Soul, Goo Goo Dolls and, say, Tonic or Better Than Ezra, is that Third Eye Blind had two aces in the hole. First, at least initially (more on this later), they had a completely singular guitar player in Kevin Cadogan, who’s unparalleled use of alternate tunings and ethereal riffs afforded him the repertoire of a poppier Chris Cornell that, to-this-day, remains unmatched in popular rock music. Secondly, and, most importantly, Third Eye Blind had at the helm Stephan Jenkins, an atypical, volatile rock n’ roll frontman anchored by an ego bigger than god, a larger-than-life, theatrical, sometimes adversarial stage presence. With a megalomaniacal control complex over his band and lyrics so blunt and in-your-face that they make your skin crawl from the realness and relatability, Jenkins showered his lyrical musings in melodies as poppy as Hanson, a magic trick that only someone like him could pull off with such sincerity.\n\nSome bands came close. For instance, Everclear’s Art Alexakis is a perfect lyrical counterpart to Jenkins, with his pitch-black ruminations on fucked-up childhoods, divorce and drug addiction, but Alexakis ain’t Kevin Cadogan and does not quite possess Jenkins’ melodic sensibilities, love Everclear as I might. Then you look at a band like Live, who, while definitely in possession of a volatile frontman in the form of Ed Kowalczyk, despite sneakily selling more records than Third Eye Blind (did you have any idea that Live low-key sold more than 20 million albums worldwide?), have most definitely not stood the test of time like 3EB, being frequently forgotten (“All Over You” is great but up against “Jumper”? GTFO).\n\nSo Third Eye Blind had a molotov cocktail of volatile rockstar-ness mixed with the keenest of pop sensibilities, injected with unique fretwork, which immediately sent them into the stratosphere. This made the thought of what they would do for their sophomore record that much more fascinating. Would they cash in on the success of their debut and crank out a copycat? Or would they go deeper and show the world that they had more to offer than “doo-doo-doo”‘s? To call its legacy one of mixed results would be an understatement, but today I will show that releasing Blue as is was overall the right move in the long run, as it afforded Third Eye Blind the opportunity to stylistically meander and grow throughout their storied, 23-years-and-counting career. While doing this for a 20th Anniversary post would be more appropriate, I missed it by a year, so today I will be celebrating the 21st anniversary of this wacky, madcap, frankly, experimental album.\n\nAnything – the sound of Blue\n\nRight from the get-go, on Blue, Third Eye Blind do not allow you to be complacent. Opening track “Anything” sets the tone right away, opening with contemplative acoustic picking and a soft vocal from Jenkins, before exploding into a full-on, almost Green Day-esque rock frenzy at the twenty-second mark, eventually meeting its conclusion with an array of luscious, atmospheric guitar chords from Cadogan, segueing beautifully into the skittering electronic beats and washy guitars that populate the intro of “Wounded,” arguably the album’s best song (truly, it is a gorgeous piece of music, which Cadogan demonstrated on YouTube several years ago). It is certainly the song that is most special place for true Third Eye Blind fans, and it was one of the few songs performed alongside their debut on that album’s 20th anniversary tour in 2017. I have seen Third Eye Blind live maybe eight times. “Wounded” is consistently a set highlight. You find yourself wanting to sing every word – of which there are a lot – with the enveloping quality of the music taking you to another place every time, yet structurally, when you break it down purely as a song, “Wounded” makes absolutely no sense. There is no chorus! And yet it is easily one of the most popular Third Eye Blind songs! It goes from intro to verse to another verse to a breakdown to a bridge to another breakdown, another verse back to that bridge and ending with an extended, somewhat guitar-soloish outro refrain. All while the song us fans love to sing so much is a tragic portrait of abuse. Not exactly typical pop fare, but would you expect anything less from the band that turned a song about crystal meth into one of the most defining pop songs of a generation? As I have said before and will say many times throughout this piece, in the context of Third Eye Blind, it seems quite normal, almost expected.\n\n“10 Days Late” continues with Jenkins’ classic magic trick of taking difficult subject matter – a possibly knocked up heroine considering abortion – and turning it into an indelibly catchy number that makes you forget the lyrics entirely. Which brings us to “Never Let You Go.” Depending on who you talk to, this either made or ruined the album. Despite its odd, rapping coda (again – weird), it is structurally the most coherent “pop” song on the record, and certainly the most obvious link between Blue and the hits off of Third Eye Blind. Some fans were turned off by its sugary pop goodness – perplexing in the mind of this writer given the previous album’s hits – and some suspect that may be what caused Blue and “Never Let You Go” to underperform. A counterargument is that it saves the album, as its only traditional, accessible pop moment (yes, “Deep Inside Of You” is great, but it is not built to be a big radio single). No matter how you look at it, the fact is that underperform as it may have, “Never Let You Go” endured, and to this day remains an all-time, instantly-recognizable classic, so I guess Jenkins wins this one? However, one downside is that in 20+ years, I have never seen a single live performance that even remotely captures the vitality of the music on the studio recording. Some chalk this up to Cadogan’s absence (again, I’m getting there), but who knows. He did famously vote against the song’s inclusion on the album. But no matter; just another factor lending to Blue‘s checkered reputation.\n\nMoving on, we have “Deep Inside Of You” – Blue‘s “How’s It Gonna Be” – “1000 July’s” – the sequel to “Graduate” – and the dangerously catchy “An Ode To Maybe,” which, to me, is one of the most “nineties” things about this record. A song that, other than maybe “Deep Inside Of You,” would have been the most at-home on Third Eye Blind.\n\nThis is when things start to get real weird, starting with “The Red Summer Sun,” the weirdest song on this album, and the weirdest song Third Eye Blind have ever written.\n\nI mean, really. What is this song?! Who thinks of songs like this?! Jenkins said it himself when looking back on the record for Noisey’s Rank Your Records series, “A song like “Red Summer Sun” was a ridiculous jam that didn’t have that critic in my head. I just kind of did it.” Jam is definitely the operative word here, as it catapults back-and-forth between mid-tempo, progressive, almost Rush-like jamming, to a double-time rock explosion with Jenkins adopting his best Axl Rose impression on his sky-high vocals.\n\nFollowing this is “Camouflage,” a spiritual companion to “Red Summer Sun,” with fluttering electronics and again another stutter-step beat from longtime drummer Brad Hargreaves, with Jenkins’ vocals drowned in echo and reverb while Cadogan picks an atmospheric arpeggio countering both Hargreaves’ beat and bassist Arion Salazar’s bassline. The anti-sing-a-long, Jenkins spends most of the song freely howling in a high falsetto over the complex music beneath him. So, to recap, Cadogan, Hargreaves, Salazar and Jenkins are all doing four completely different things throughout most of this song…and damn it all to hell, it works! It takes a special kind of chemistry to be able to pull that off, and the fact that Third Eye Blind were barely speaking during these sessions, recording everything individually, is damn impressive considering the volatility of songs like this and “Red Summer Sun.”\n\n“Farther” begins with an Eastern-sounding feel that glitches out into a musical bed reminiscent of Garbage before giving way to a distorted, synthy-sounding bass foundation from Salazar, with Jenkins’ vocals once again drowned in effects. Complementing Cadogan’s haphazard guitar stabs and slinky licks, an acoustic guitar pops up in the second verse and then is gone, never to return. Which itself is pretty much the story of this song. Random synths, guitar flourishes, strings, electronic beats and glitches, this track is a kitchen sink of studio f*ckery if there ever was one, careening across the sonic spectrum with reckless abandon and it totally works. Don’t know how “live-friendly” it is (re: it’s not), but its just a weird-ass song that sounds fresh off a Moby album and is just dying to underscore an end-credits montage for a Bourne or Transporter movie. However, in my eyes, at its core, it is a lesser version of Third Eye Blind b-side “Tattoo Of The Sun,” which they would finally get right in 2017 with a reimagining on their debut’s reissue that sounds significantly less dated. Nevertheless, the weirdness is strong with this one!\n\n“Darkness” is the weak link on the album. Psychedelic guitars and subtle pianos abound, anchored by a non-chorus chorus, eventually giving way to more shrieks from Jenkins and then a multi-vocal coda as Cadogan’s guitar and Jenkins’ vocals end up matching up, leading to a brief cacophonous drum crescendo from Hargreaves, before winding down into its usual mid-tempo groove. Not bad, just not memorable, except for the fact that Cadogan’s harmonic-filled guitar lines give an otherwise typical mid-tempo plotter a unique X-factor that makes it better than if Spacehog wrote the same song.\n\n“Darwin” is pseudo-reggae with delayed, ping-ponging, shredding guitars, anchored by Salazar, who finally gets to shine in this bass-heavy acid trip to the beach. Basically the equivalent of “what if Third Eye Blind did a bunch of drugs and tried writing a song for Jack Johnson” (I realize his debut didn’t come out for almost another three years but humor me. Maybe Geggy Tah is the better example?).\n\nAnd finally, the record’s Pièce de résistance – despite not technically even being on the album – “Slow Motion.” For those in the know, tell me; what mainstream artist could ever get away with releasing a song like “Slow Motion”? You think Johnny Rzeznik was gonna put something like this on Gutterflower? Technically Third Eye Blind didn’t get away with releasing “Slow Motion,” but here’s some background. “Slow Motion” dates back to the original Third Eye Blind demo that floated around in 1995, a satire of how Hollywood and the media glorify extreme violence and drug use. And extreme damn-well it is, with Jenkins using a slow piano-and-guitar ballad to have his protagonist murder his teacher’s son, have sex then do cocaine cut with Draino, ignore his drug-addicted sister’s moans for help while he himself shoots heroin then watch his neighbor beat his wife, all under the conceit that “Hollywood glamorized my wrath…[inciting] murder for your enjoyment because [he] needed the money – what’s your excuse?” Here’s the problem. It wasn’t 1995. It was 1999. Columbine was fresh in the minds of the executives at Elektra and they determined there was no way they could have a song where the opening lines are a student opening fire. So a compromise was reached where Third Eye Blind could release “Slow Motion” in its full form on an upcoming EP (which never ended up seeing the light of day), and for Blue they would include the song…as an instrumental? *Jive pauses and lets out an exasperated, perplexed sigh and throws his head in his hands* I have no idea who in both the Elektra and Third Eye Blind camps thought this was even a remotely good idea, as literally any other song on this musically complex album would be an infinitely more interesting listen as an instrumental than the sparse, bare “Slow Motion.” It’s just wrong! In any event, “Slow Motion” eventually did see a true release and has become the cathartic climax of every Third Eye Blind show, and that is because at its core, “Slow Motion” is an evocative, breathtaking piece of music that’s twisted sincerity, even in its satirical nature, is a perfect allegory for Blue itself (side note, I always felt that “Blade” off Dopamine was its spiritual sequel, but “Slow Motion” is the GOAT).\n\nBlue is a beautiful record born in chaos, similar to the protagonist’s tale recounted over the majesty of “Slow Motion.” This is well-tread territory in the dramatic history of this band, but let’s just say that Stephan Jenkins’ vocals on “The Red Summer Sun” aren’t the only thing he has in common with Axl Rose. To say that him and Cadogan were not getting along would be an understatement. During the writing and recording of Blue, according to Cadogan – and later alleged in a high-profile lawsuit that, in various fits and swells, stretches all the way to 2019 after initially settling in 2002 – Jenkins went behind the band’s back and had 3EB’s manager and lawyer reassign all shares of the band’s trademark to himself, shoving out Cadogan specifically, who was the only other name assigned to the trademark upon signing with Elektra Records in 1996. Despite the contention befalling the band’s business, Cadogan attempted to keep the band on track and arranged for two weeks of writing and demoing at his house, sessions that, while responsible for the creation of the majority of the music, proved to be contentious and were unfortunately the only time that the band actually worked together for the entire recording process. As previously noted, the album was recorded with all band members completely isolated from another. And as for the songs that made the final album, after the band’s manager encouraged a voting system, with Jenkins poisoning the well with the other bandmembers regarding Cadogan in a long-game effort to push him out, most of Cadogan’s songs were voted off of the record. Cadogan played his final show with the band shortly after Blue‘s release and was replaced by original touring keyboardist/guitarist Tony Fredianelli, who would acrimoniously part ways with Third Eye Blind ten years later with – you guessed it – a lawsuit against Jenkins.\n\nAn Ode To Maybe – Maybe Blue Really Is That Interesting\n\nSo how does all this translate into making Third Eye Blind’s career so interesting and Blue such a transcendent sophomore offering? Again, I bring it back to my initial question: what mainstream artist of the 25 years has cranked out a sophomore record as weird, yet totally natural, as Blue? And no, I am not talking about a buzzworthy Spin band who made a weird second-album because “fuck the critics!” I am talking about an artist with true mainstream, crossover success. An album that, while recognized as different, only reinforced who the artist is, without the artist having to spend record cycle after record cycle apologizing for it. That right there rules out Sam’s Town from The Killers. It certainly rules out Pretty.Odd from Panic. In the pop realm, I would say that maybe the only other artist in this conversation is Justin Timberlake with FutureSex/LoveSounds. He had already released three albums with *NSYNC where, let’s face it, he was the lead singer (still got mad love for JC Chasez, don’t get it twisted!), so I’m not sure he completely counts in this category, but I remember when FutureSex/LoveSounds came out and that record, especially in the context of *NSYNC and Justified, is Weird with a capital W. But, like Blue, it didn’t alienate his fanbase, it merely reinforced Timberlake as an artist with a lot more to offer than we thought and expanded the possibilities of what he was capable of. So maybe he would be the other example, but think about some of the other artists big artists of this period. Sure, The Bends came out 25 years ago but, as big a leap as it was from Pablo Honey, listening back, it is completely conceivable that the band that wrote “You” also wrote “My Iron Lung.” They are composed of the exact same DNA. Putting “The Red Summer Sun” next to, say, “I Want You”? Not so much. Linkin Park made Meteora after Hybrid Theory and that’s pretty much a carbon copy, so that wouldn’t qualify, however if they had made Minutes To Midnight or A Thousand Suns, maybe. Coldplay made A Rush Of Blood To The Head after Parachutes, which, again, is composed of the same DNA, but, like Linkin Park, had X&Y, Viva La Vida or Mylo Xyloto come next, the game would change. The Strokes followed Is This It with Room On Fire, which, despite what whiny Strokes fans will tell you, is pretty damn similar. Arctic Monkeys didn’t follow up Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not with AM, they followed it up with Favourite Worst Nightmare. Maroon 5, however, did follow Songs About Jane with It Won’t Be Soon Before Long, but that album is a mess and I would put that in the Pretty.Odd category of self-indulgent misfire."
