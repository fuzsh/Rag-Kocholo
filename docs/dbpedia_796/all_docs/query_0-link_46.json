        "text": "I don't know about you but I have missed live music. It has been way too long since we were able to welcome a 103 GBF Damn Loud Rock Show back to Ford Center, and we are proud to welcome Disturbed with special guests Pop Evil live in Evansville on November 6th!\n\nNot only has it been a long time since we have welcomed rock music to Ford Center, but it has also been years since Disturbed has played a show in Evansville. If we are remembering correctly, Disturbed last made an appearance in the River City in 2009 as part of the Music as a Weapon Tour with Killswitch Engage, Lacuna Coil, and Chimaira. Prior to that, Disturbed played on the tour stop with Korn, Ozzy, Marilyn Manson, and Chevelle in 2003. Both of those shows took place at the long-gone Robert's Stadium.\n\n103 GBF is proud to present Disturbed for their return to Evansville, along with special guests and Pop Evil! Tickets for this 103 GBF Damn Loud Rock Show are on sale now at Ford Center Box Office and Ticketmaster.com.\n\nThis Saturday, November 6th the Ford Center doors will open at 7 PM with Pop Evil taking the stage at 8 PM followed by Disturbed to close out the night.\n\nWant to WIN tickets?\n\nListen to 103 GBF every day this week for a chance to score tickets with Kat Mykals each weekday from 10 am - 3 pm."
