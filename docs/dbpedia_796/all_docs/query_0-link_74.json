Kelley said that it was a blessing because he could do whatever the hell he wanted, because it was all himself. The beginning of the series originally had six films, which were The Dark Side of the Moon, The Starman, The Wall, The Black Parade, and The Fabulous Killjoys and its sequel. The Fabulous Killjoys 2 was scrapped for a long time, replaced by Tommy. Then, the next day, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge was added. Originally, Tommy was set in between The Wall and Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, however, when Kelley listened to the full album and found out it took place in the 1920s, that's where Tommy became the first film in the Universe. The Starman was planned before the Concept Album Cinematic Universe was even idealized. Kelley imagined it in his eighth grade math class, already fascinated with the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust as a whole. The film was originally going to be a big budget Hollywood production, with a government official chasing down Ziggy Stardust. That idea was scrapped, and Kelley used the basis of the song \"Five Years\" as the basis. People clamored for a Dark Side of the Moon movie. Director Jackson Kelley decided to make one, and started work on the screenplay. However, there was a big writer's block in the studio. In an interview, after revealing the American Idiot and Hotel California projects, Kelley announced that The Starman's script was finished, and he was putting more focus on The Dark Side of the Moon and The Fabulous Killjoys. In January of 2019, the script was finally completed, and the cast was announced. The four main characters are named after the members of Pink Floyd (Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason, Richard Wright). Hotel California was scrapped, in favor of a Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band movie. Kelley read about the original film, and how it was critically panned. He said, \"I want to make that much better.\" And he did, with Sgt. Pepper reaching a 87% on Rotten Tomatoes. When the making of Wish You Were Here commenced, Jackson Kelley thought of the times in high school when he was made fun of for liking Pink Floyd. He said, \"Well, I once got a DM that said 'Fuck you. Pink Floyd is trash', and I just ignored it.\" He stated the film would follow the themes of the album, with a satire of the music industry, and stated, \"My film, Wish You Were Here, is going to be a film that is part friend meets friend in the afterlife, and part taking a dump on modern music.\", with the characters of Jonathan Grayson being the archetype of the struggling indie musician making a major label debut, Wayne Hawkins being the boss who wants the band or artist to sell out, and Bobby Jones being the washed up star from the boss' ridiculous schemes.\n\nAll the films take place in Kelley's favorite state, California, with the exceptions being Tommy (set in Minnesota) and Animals (set in Britain). The cities featured in California include three fictional towns, Griffin Valley in The Starman, Battery City in The Fabulous Killjoys, and Suburbia in American Idiot.. The others include Orange County (The Dark Side of the Moon), San Francisco (Hotel California), San Jose (Wish You Were Here), Los Angeles (The Wall and The Final Cut), San Diego (Gorillaz), Sacramento (The Ed Hunter films), Fresno (Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge), Oakland (The Black Parade), and Venice Beach (California Kids).\n\nIn late April 2019, Jackson Kelley gave Eddie Raymond his own Instagram page, and announced a film known as Discovery, focusing on the Daft Punk album of the same name. The film, which was previously announced to be cancelled, is the first film in the Concept Album Cinematic Universe to feature a female protagonist.\n\nIn late May 2019, Jackson Kelley stated it was possible if the world was restored with another dimension introduced, with the possibility of the Concept Album Multiverse. However, this idea was scrapped.\n\nThe films mix different genres alltogether, such as action and adventure, romantic comedy, horror, science fiction, mystery, teen comedy, drama, and superhero.\n\nTV Shows[]\n\nThe Universe has expanded to TV, with three series based on some movies, plus one TV Movie as a crossover between Ed Hunter and Gorillaz.\n\nThe Eddie Chronicles[]\n\nThe show focuses on Eddie (Tom Holland), and his travelling to fun places.\n\nG-Bitez[]\n\nThe show focuses on the misadventures of The Gorillaz.\n\nEl Diablo[]\n\nA crossover between Ed Hunter and Gorillaz, this TV movie finds Murdoc (Cillian Murphy) travelling into the real world to retrieve pieces of his bass guitar.\n\nTales of the Iron Maiden[]\n\nThis show focuses on Eddie (Tom Holland) and more crazy adventures, with Iron Maiden songs as the basis.\n\nThe Genius Hits the Road[]\n\nBased on the concept album by Ray Charles, the film focuses on Jackson Kelley as he travels across the United States alone in an RV.\n\nFull Story[]\n\nThe adventures began in 1921, after the war. Captain Walker went missing and was presumed dead, so his wife, Nora, remarried to a man named Jacob Hobbs. However, Captain Walker did not die, because he came home to see his wife cheating on him. Nora and Jacob murdered the Captain, witnessed by their three year old son, Tommy. His parents made him deaf, dumb, and blind. He goes on a journey of self discovery, and later becomes a pinball master. When he regains his senses, he begins a holiday camp, which turns into a riot, killing his parents.\n\nAll is not well, because by the time Tommy ages, in 1967, the world will end. To stop this, all the way on Planet Stardust, lived an inventor named Gorba, who looked up to the Prince of Stardust, Ziggy. Ziggy got shot, so Gorba recreated him. He crash landed on planet Earth, taking along a ragtag band called The Spiders from Mars. Taken in by a boy named Noah, Ziggy began to create music to stop the Earth's end. His ego got in the way, and he was jailed. His music did save the world, but Ziggy is not satisfied, and hangs himself.\n\nMeanwhile, in Orange County, four friends named Roger, Dave, Nick, and Richard were planning a vacation together. One of Roger's crazy dreams was one that almost predicted the future. The plane they were on crashed, and they went on a huge journey through the realms of Roger's mind. Eventually, the mastermind who was behind it was a being called Eclipse, who killed the four.\n\nRoger floated through space, landing in the dumpster of Hawkins Records. Meanwhile, in San Jose, two best friends, Jonathan Grayson and Bobby Jones, were diehard fans of Pink Floyd. Bobby was bullied constantly, and he committed suicide. Years later, Jonathan is a failing musician, manipulated by his boss, Wayne Hawkins. Jonathan visits Bobby's grave, and is taken through Bobby's dead life. It is revealed Wayne Hawkins was the bully who caused Bobby's death. Jonathan kills him.\n\nElsewhere, in Britain, there was a drunk farmer named Mr. Jones, who constantly forgot to take care of his animals. The animals were sick of his irresponsibility, and chased him off the farm. One of the pigs, Napoleon, chases a former leader named Snowball off the farm, and forces the animals into a tyrannical dicatorship.\n\nBack to California, in Los Angeles, there is a rockstar named Pink, who is traumatized by events from his childhood, such as his father's death and his teachers berating him. His tour life is much better, except for the fact his wife is cheating on him. Pink builds a metaphorical wall around himself. However, it is a huge mistake. Eventually, Pink tears down the wall and goes into journalism.\n\nHis first journalism assignment is interviewing his old teacher, John Barrett. Barrett was a war veteran, serving in World War I. He had a tough war life, as his best friend, Bradshaw, was killed in action. He returned home, but couldn't get a grasp on reality, affecting his social life. He builds his own wall, and he breaks free.\n\nIn San Diego, Satanist daredevil Murdoc Niccals crashes into Uncle Norm's Organ Emporium, damaging Stuart Pot's left eye. A similar incident knocks out his other eye. Murdoc renames him 2-D. Russel Hobbs joins the group shortly after, and after Murdoc is caught getting a blowjob from 2-D's girlfriend, the group recieves a guitarist going by the moniker Noodle. They go on several crazy adventures, including a windmill crash, an attack on Plastic Beach, and Murdoc's incarceration.\n\nEddie Raymond was a teenage whiz-kid, with a loving for British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. One day, he wandered onto a nuclear test site, and getting severely deformed, eventually escaping, and killing everyone he knew and loved. FBI Agent Jason Wright was asked to get on the case, but Eddie eventually killed him and his team.\n\nCancelled projects[]\n\nThe Amory Wars Saga was rumored, but that was cancelled early on because it required too much special effect. It eventually became its own saga. Radio K.A.O.S. by Roger Waters was planned, but it was shelved. A planned adaptation for Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds was planned, but Kelley turned it down. Ayreon's albums were planned, and even storyboarded, but it was scrapped. Dream Theater's Metropolis was planned. Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway was planned as well. More The Who albums, like Quadrophenia and Who's Next was planned, and then got scrapped due to Tommy's mixed reviews.\n\nReception[]\n\nThe films have gotten generally positive reviews."
