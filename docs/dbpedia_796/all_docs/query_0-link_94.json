Robinson (rhythm guitar, lead vocals) / Chuck Kerr (drums, percussion, backing vocals) / John Millest (lead & rhythm guitars, pedal steel, backing vocals) / Dave Laub (keyboards)\n\nOttawa area friends McLeish, Petrie and Robinson, put together a home-made demo in 1978 and pressed some vinyl copies initially in an effort to shop the songs to record labels and publishers. Soon the recordings led to publicity for the writers. The Ottawa Journal did a full page article on the trio, while both CJOH and CBC television in Ottawa did feature stories. Answering to the media attention, a band was formed using some of the musicians who played on the album and christened R.P.M. (a clever music related acronym of the band’s last names). The 1,000 copy limited edition album sold out soon after the band’s one and only concert in Ottawa in April 1978. A limited edition CD of the concert itself was eventually released in 2002; After Petrie dropped out of performing and Robinson went on to a solo career, R.P.M. continued as a band with Ian McLeish (bass/rhythm guitar/vocals), John Millest (lead guitar), Chuck Kerr (drums, vocals), and Jeff Harris (keyboards). This lineup recorded and played for two years until McLeish and Kerr moved to Toronto in 1980 where they met lead vocalist Mary Ellen Moore. The three worked together on the musical ‘Amazon Women’; The band started up again in 1987 back in Ottawa and added keyboard player Geoff Pinhey (who had played on the R.P.M. album) to the line-up of McLeish, Millest, Kerr and Moore. With two years of on-again, off-again recording the band – re-christened Random Axis – released their self-titled pop rock album in 1990 on CD. The disc received intermittent coast-to-coast airplay with the song “The Strength To Fly” charting in several small markets; Moore left in 1992, eventually joining the Choirgirlz with Debbie Fleming and Pinhey left in 1994, although both made guest appearances on later releases. In 1998 Millest, Kerr and McLeish continued as M*K*M and released two final CDs – “Orchid Island’ and “Cleaning the Cupboard’ – before disbanding in 2002; McLeish co-owns the Mousehole Music label who have become a premiere Canadian classic rock re-issues label. He is also planning a second solo album in 2013 entitled ‘Crouching At the Feet of Giants’.\n\nSingles\n\nas JIM ROBINSON & R.P.M.\n\n1979 One Time Flyer/Dance With Me (Starfish) 7901\n\nAlbums\n\nas McLEISH, PETRIE, ROBINSON & FRIENDS\n\n1978 McLeish, Petrie, Robinson & Friends (Starfish) SFS-7801\n\n2002 Live At Porter Hall (Mousehole)\n\n2002 McLeish, Petrie, Robinson & Friends [re-issue] (CD)\n\nas RANDOM AXIS\n\n1990 Random Axis (McMusic)\n\nas M*K*M\n\n2000 Orchid Island (Mousehole)\n\n2002 Cleaning the Cupboard (Mousehole)\n\nRABBLE, The\n\nJohn Pimm (lead vocals, guitar) / Mike Harris (lead guitar) / Rick Metcalfe (guitar) / George Creswick (bass) / David Wynne (drums) / Tim Charbonneau (bass; replaced Creswick) / Brian Robillard (drums; replaced Wynne) / Walter O’Reilly (drums; replaced Robillard) / Teddy McMahon (drums; replaced O’Reilly) / Graham Chambers (drums; replaced McMahon) / Tim Forsythe (keyboards)\n\nPointe-Claire, Québec’s The Rabble floated about playing minor gigs with no official name performing standards like “Stand By Me” and “Walk the Dog” initially with members Pimm, Harris, Metcalfe, Creswick and Wynne. The band officially adopted the name The Rabble in 1965 after David Wynne quit the band to join The Haunted in exchange for their drummer Brian Robillard. Soon Creswick left and was replaced by Tim Charbonneau. With a record deal secured through RCA Victor’s Canada International imprint, their first single was the Mike Harris written “I’m Alaboundy Bam” released in 1966. Alas, the label didn’t reprint the single after the initial 1000 copies sold out cutting short further promo of the record. The band moved to Trans-World records for their next single, “Golden Girl”, which was recorded in December 1966 and saw release in the summer of 1967. Robillard, who had performed on the first two singles, soon left to form his own band. Walter O’Reilly replaced Robillard prior to the band’s self-titled debut album being recorded and was released in 1967 Trans-World out of Montreal. The album was produced by CFOX (Pointe-Claire) radio personality Dean Hagopian. On May 22, 1967 The Rabble performed with The Isabella Blues Band, Leonard Cohen, and Buffy Sainte-Marie at the Queen’s Park “Love In” in Toronto which was attended by nearly 4,000 people. The Rabble also performed at Expo ’67’s Garden Of The Stars Pavilion. O’Reilly left the band in late 1967 and was replaced by Teddy McMahon. Metcalfe also left the band as he wasn’t satisfied with their new avant-garde direction and The Rabble re-formed as a quartet with Pimm taking on second guitar duties. The band’s follow-up album, ‘Give Us Back Elaine’, was recorded through the end of 1967 into early 1968 and released on Trans-World. By this time the band had played The New Penelope Coffee House and throughout Greater Montreal, Québec City, Ottawa, Toronto, Kingston, as well as touring northern Ontario. In April of 1968 The Rabble substituted for Cream, who had canceled at the last minute, at The Paul Sauve Arena in Montreal to 5,000 fans. Despite the band’s unrehearsed show, they impressed the crowd with an hour-long set of songs consisting of their singles and album material. Following the gig, promoter Donald K. Donald had to turn down engagements on their behalf because they were already booked on a tour of one-night engagements throughout Québec and Ontario. In May of 1968 the band was double-billed with the Guess Who in a ‘Wildest Pair’ tour at places such as the Loyola Arena and the Dorval Recreation Association. The group lasted through 1970 having released a final single on the Aquarius label with Graham Chambers on drums; Metcalfe formed a band called Aeon with The Haunted’s Al Birmingham and Bob Burgess in 1976 and now lives in Ottawa; Pimm moved to Toronto and recorded one single for Warner Brothers (produced by Forsythe), and then worked with Lighthouse’s Bob McBride, Deja Vu, and John Moran. He also did studio session work as guitarist. With a relocation to Sooke, British Columbia, Pimm has been producing music at Canadian Concept Studios in Victoria, BC., and has played in Hawaii (5 times), Bangkok, Palm Springs, CA. He has recorded two Jazz instrumental albums and is working on a third one; David Wynne now works in Singapore; O’Reilly moved to PEI; Charbonneau lives in Montreal; Harris lives east of Toronto, Ontario; Forsythe joined D’Arcy. with notes from Mike Harris, Graham Wagner, David Wynne, Jacques Lefort, and John Pimm.

Following the writing of “This Little Bird” by his brother Raymond, he and Robbie were discovered by a passerby while they were singing the song at home. This kindly stranger was a recording hobbyist and had the boys record the tune at his make-shift home studio. The gentleman sent the song to producer Ivor Raymonde at Decca Records in London and the duo was signed to a recording contract. In 1966 Decca released “This Little Bird” b/w “You Better Move On” under the name Robbie And Ray. The label wanted the boys to tour to promote it. Though Ray was already 17, Robbie was only 14 and they had to wait for Robbie to complete school following his 15th birthday in 1967. Under the name Robbie, Ray and the Jaguars, they toured Wales and Europe with various configurations from 1967 to 1971 opening for The Tremeloes, The Move, and even actor/singer Des O’Connor. The even made an appearance on the UK talent show ‘Opportunity Knocks’ hosted by Hughie Green. As their popularity grew, and people constantly misquoted the band’s name as Robbie Ray and the Jaguars, it was at this point they adopted the stage name Robbie Rae; “Rae” being a variation on Raymond’s name. They would find infamy in Wales where, having secured a new record deal with MCA in 1969 they recorded a version of “The Lord’s Prayer” in Welsh – which had been part of their stage show for many years – and which was subsequently banned by the BBC because it was deemed blasphemous. Of course, this only helped fuel sales of 100,000 copies worldwide. They drifted to NEMS Records next and in 1971 they were signed to a fourth record deal – this time with M.A.M. Records who released the single “Stay Love” that was popular in England but not in Europe or overseas. In 1972, on the cusp of a new deal with producer Mickey Most and Air Records, Ray quit the band. He would ultimately become a pastor back in Wales. Robbie, meanwhile, adopted Robbie Rae as his personal stage name and in 1973 The Jaguars became Sweet Sensation featuring four male and two female members. Decca Records took an interest in the band and had the band demo the songs “Natalie” and “Three Score and Ten”. However, their management team fell apart and the band soon followed suit. Robbie Rae would soon end up in a pop act called Roundabout. He also hosted a TV show on the BBC in Wales. One of the guests on the show was Canadian singer Cherrill Yates (ex-The Comic Opera) from Canada. Upon moving to Canada, he and Yates married and moved to her hometown of St. Thomas, Ontario. The duo signed a deal with A & M Records as an adult pop act in 1976 but failed to make any inroads with their first few singles “Don’t Shut Me Out” and “Oh Me, Oh My”. After turning a version of Doris Day’s 1956 hit “Que Sera Sera” into a disco dance track in 1977 the duo managed to chart. The label was encouraged enough to have the act record their self-titled debut album in 1978 which was produced mainly by Harry Hinde with several tracks produced by Cliff Edwards (ex-The Bells). Their second album ‘Dancing Up a Storm’, also produced by Harry Hinde, followed immediately in 1979 and a remixed 12″ single of “A Little Lovin” (Keeps The Doctor Away)” was issued. The catchy, bubbly song shot up the charts immediately. It went to No.5 on Billboard’s Club Play list but only peaked at No.61 on the Pop chart. The song failed to make hit status because of a typographical error in Billboard magazine which showed the record sliding down the charts after a promising start and A & M pulled all promotion on the record. However, they took another chance with a second 12″ single, “I Only Wanna Get Up and Dance,” but it only managed to reach No. 47 on the Club Play lists before disappearing. In Canada The Raes were nominated for two Juno Awards and they became hosts of a CTV’s variety show. They were then offered a chance at a firm 5-year TV contract of their own – which they turned down after A & M execs felt it would affect sales. But the writing was already on the wall as their third album, “Two Hearts”, wasn’t even optioned for release in the US. With no label support and declining popularity Cherrill and Robbie’s personal lives took the strain and the group split up in 1981 and the duo divorced in the early 1980s. Following the demise of the duo he tried to make a go of it solo on Quality Records in 1983 with a song called “Finger On It” which the label hailed as a new direction for Rae – the B-side, “Rachel”, was written by future Refugee exponent Myles Hunter. However, the following year he found himself on Mel Shaw’s Music World Creation touting another Hunter tune, “Hold On To the Night”, also to no effect. His final solo record was the Hot Line Records release “Take No Prisoners In the Game of Love”. In 1989 he teamed up with Saga members Jim Gilmour and Steve Negus under his real name Robert Bevan in the Gilmour-Negus Project (GNP) who released one album for Virgin Records. Following this Rae became an entertainer in the Canadian club scene doing bawdy versions of cover tunes with The Robbie Rae Band. This led to steady gigs in Dubai (United Arab Emirates) entertaining American troops stationed in Saudi Arabia. In October 1999, Rae moved to Thailand (Kamala Beach – Phuket) where he invested in his own outdoor bar as well as singing in Patong with a new band. On December 26, 2004 Rae went missing as one of many victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster when Phuket was devastated by flooding. He was located a short time later safe and sound and resumed work at the Tai Pan Club. However, on February 9, 2006 Rae succumbed to liver and kidney failure in Phuket Hospital. He was 52 years old. with notes from Ursula Lott and Dave Davies (ex-Sweet Sensation).

As Robbie, Ray and The Jaguars the group eventually became known as just ‘Robbie Rae’ and toured all through the UK and Europe. However, after five record deals and as many false career starts, Raymond quit the music business and Robert (now adopting Robbie Rae as his own last stage name) joined The Roundabouts and eventually hosted his own BBC television show in Wales. It was this show that introduced him to singer/performer Cherrill Yates (ex-The Comic Opera) who was touring the UK but was from Canada. Upon moving to Canada, Rae and Yates married and moved to her hometown of St. Thomas, Ontari.

Robbie tried to make a go of it as a solo artist releasing unsuccessful singles on Quality Records and Mel Shaw’s Music World Creations touting several Myles Hunter (Avalon/Refugee) tunes to little chart effect. In 1989 he teamed up with Saga members Jim Gilmour and Steve Negus under the pseudonym Robert Bevan in GNP. They released one album for Virgin Records. In recent years he fronted the Robbie Rae Band as a classic rock impresario on the Toronto Club circuit. Following this he maintained a steady gig in Dubai (United Arab Emirates) entertaining American troops stationed in Saudi Arabia. In October 1999, Rae moved to Thailand (Kamala Beach – Phuket) where he invested in his own outdoor bar as well as singing in Patong with a new band.

Cherrill Rae would remarry another musician, Nick Cucunato, and has performed in several acts since the Raes including short-lived studio hit makers Mens Room (with Caren Cole and Charity Brown), Backstreet, Rae And Rockit, and The Cherrill Rae Trio. notes from Ursula Lott.

Steve Major performed guitar on all the band’s commercial releases. Meanwhile, guitarist Darren Quinn (Monster Voodoo Machine) and drummer Dean Bentley were added to the group’s live line-up. For vocals, the early incarnation of the group featured rapper Koze Kozma (who ended up being deported to the United Kingdom), as well as rapper Michie Mee (of Michie Mee & L.A. Luv), and Doc Bollocks. Raggadeath’s ‘The Family Worship EP’ (featuring Paul Raven on bass) was licensed in 1995 to Toronto’s Fringe Product label. The reception was encouraging enough that it would be re-issued by Virgin Records through EMI Canada. Raggadeath’s 1995 album ‘Why Ask Why’ was released on Virgin Records and contained the singles “One Life,” and the title track. The label also released the record in several European markets. “One Life” was put into high rotation on MuchMusic and was nominated for ‘Best Alternative Video’ at the 1995 MuchMusic Video Awards. The band was busy with other committments (and Kozma has gone AWOL) so the album wasn’t toured, but they did make a live appearance on the MuchMusic Video Awards telecast. With a move to Attic Records for their 1997 self-titled follow-up album it featured appearances by Michie Mee, Phatt Al, Friendlyman, Tallis, Mikko, and Whitey Don. The album spawned two solid singles in “Dance With The Devil” and a remake of Eddy Grant’s “Electric Avenue”. A tour soon followed. Attic Records was able to make the album a moderate international success by licensing it to Edel in Germany, Roadrunner Records in the Netherlands, and TWA in Australia. Unfortunately, there was no American release. Music industry inertia shifted from Alt Rock to electronica in the late 1990s and the group soon broke up; Sobczak continued with record engineering/production, later becoming chief engineer at The Studio at Puck’s Farm; Kendall returned to his career as a DJ including work at The Swan in England; Major returned to studio work at Toronto’s Wellesley Sound; Quinn and Michie Mee continued to collaborate as Rap/Rock act The Day After. with notes from Walter Sobczak.\n\nSingles\n\n1995 One Life (Mini Marshall Single Version)/One Life (Mega Marshall Single Version) (Virgin/EMI) DPRO-1090\n\n1995 One Life [3 mixes] (Virgin – UK) 724389314922\n\n1995 One Life [5 mixes] [12″] (Virgin/EMI) RAGGA-1\n\n1995 Why Ask Why [6 mixes] [12″ (Virgin/EMI) 724383850914\n\n1997 Dance With The Devil [7 mixes] (Attic – GERMANY) 0072225-ATT\n\n1997 Dance With The Devil [4 mixes] (TWA/Attic – AUSTRALIA) TWAS-427\n\n1997 Dance With The Devil (DJ Lethal Remixes) [4 mixes] (TWA/Attic – AUSTRALIA) TWAS-437\n\n1997 Dance With The Devil [4 remixes]//Dance With The Devil (DJ Slick Remix)/Unity Version/Negative/God Bless [12″] (Attic) ATTP-9704\n\n1997 Electric Avenue (Remixes) [4 mixes] (Attic) 0072245-ATT\n\n1997 Electric Avenue [5 mixes] (TWA) TWAS-443\n\nAlbums\n\n1995 The Family Worship EP [6-song EP] (Fringe) FPD-3136\n\n1995 The Family Worship EP [6-song EP reissue] (Virgin/EMI) 724383336524\n\n1995 Why Ask Why (Virgin) 724383336623\n\n1997 The Bollocks Sampler [6-song EP] (Attic) ACDP-1470\n\n1997 Raggadeath (Attic) ACD-1470\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1995 “One Life” on ‘Aural Sex: Virgin Music Sampler Volume 1’ (Virgin) [no cat.#]\n\n1995 “One Life” on ‘Triple Scoop 3’ (EMI) 72438358512\n\n1997 “Dance With The Devil” on ‘Zoo Magazine CD Sampler 08’ (Zoo Magazine) CD-08\n\n1997 “Electric Avenue” on ‘Edelstück > 2 – 1997 [2CD(Edel – GERMANY) edel-0037072EDL\n\n1997 “Electric Avenue” on ‘Edelstück > 3 – 1997 Popkomm Edition (Edel – GERMANY) edel-0037202EDLP\n\n1997 “Dance With The Devil” on ‘Snag This!

In 1970 they became the first act signed to Greg Hambleton’s fledgling Axe label. Hambleton would produce their self-titled debut album (with future Rush producer Terry Brown as co-engineer) and its hit single “Out Of My Mind”. Along with the band’s own original compositions, Hambleton brought in additional songwriting talent via his brother Fergus (a solo artist on Capitol at the time) and David Lodge who would have success of his own on Axe Records in the ’70s with his band Major Hoople’s Boarding House. Despite becoming very popular on the Canadian club circuit they began having band member problems and the original act disbanded in 1972. Phyllis Brown left, while Hiller and McLaughlin were replaced by LeBlanc and LaBarge respectively. With the revised line-up they released another single “Make Me” (sung by Woroch) backed with “Catwalk” (sung by LaBarge). Lead vocalist Phyllis Brown (nee Boltz) would eventually sign with A & M Records, and change her professional name to Charity Brown where she would have a moderately successful solo career in the mid-70s; Ron Hiller joined Copperpenny; LaBarge continues as a very in-demand session artist and solo performer in his own right. with notes from John G.

Alfonso’s interest in the arts began when he had stories published in Marvel and Archie/Red Circle Comics in the early 70s. With the advent of punk, Alfonso had relocated to Toronto and managed the legendary but short-lived Toronto, Ontario punk club Crash’n’Burn in 1977 as the Queen Street punk seen began to explode. He found print media a great tool for expression and wrote and took photographs for magazines and newspapers such as ‘New York Rocker’, ‘Kicks’, ‘Bomp’, ‘The Toronto Star’, ‘Cheap Thrills’, and ‘Roxy’. He would go on to work at Attic Records (where he won the ‘Canadian Promotion Director Of The Year award’ from ‘The Records’ magazine in 1985), Warner Music, and EMI Canada working with many of Canada’s biggest names including The Diodes, Anvil, Killer Dwarfs, Honeymoon Suite, Brighton Rock, Burton Cummings and even international stars Katrina & The Waves. After leaving EMI and relocating to Vancouver, British Columbia, Alfonso soon finds himself broke and nearly homeless but hatches the idea for his homemade pop/poetry ‘RALPH’ zine in 1992 and managed to stay solvent with graphic design work part-time at Nettwerk Records. In 1993, he guested on his friend Tom Harrison’s radio show to talk about his days in the record industry and his zine. On the show, the two improvise a spoken word piece. Having heard the Harrison interview they are asked to appear on CBC radio’s ‘Morningside’ hosted by Peter Gzowski. Alfonso and Harrison are asked to do improv again – this time joined by guitarist Michael Rummen. The interview lasts 30 minutes and plays out to millions of listeners. Alfonso soon receives the first of 300 letters wanting more. Based on this response the boys – Harrison, Rummen and Ron Stelting (percussion) all from the band Little Games (aka Bruno Gerussi’s Medallion) – plus keyboardist Tracy Marks decide to record a CD together backing Alfonso as ‘frontman’. The album ‘Coffee, Jazz and Poetry’ is taped completely live in front of a drunken studio audience and manages to go Top10 at many college stations as well as Top50 on the ‘CHART Magazine’ Canadian college chart; It stayed at No.1 at CKUL in Lethbridge for 10 consecutive weeks. A 1995 Vancouver to Winnipeg tour is met with enthusiastic response and critical praise. In summer 1996, RALPH releases the ‘Olympia 66’ EP and do a touring on a co-bill with New York’s Agnelli/Rave under the tour name ‘The Beatnik Folk Rock Explosion’ which included a gig at CBGB’S Gallery, New York. The next RALPH album, ‘Sophisticated Boom Boom’ was released in 1997 and peaked at No.17 on the ‘Exclaim magazine’ college chart and No.23 on the ‘CHART Magazine’ Campus Top50). The Patrick Jenkins animated video “Venus In Violets” received rotation on MuchMusic and BRAVO!. ‘The Beatnik Folk Rock Explosion ’97’ tour followed and featured an on-air live session for CBC ‘After Hours’ in Winnipeg. Two tracks from the broadcast, “John Coltrane New York City” and “Why Does My Paul Desmond Record Start Skipping When I try To Kiss You?” were subsequently included on the ‘Night People’ CD). The western leg of the tour included Chris Hooper (film-maker and ex-Grapes Of Wrath) on drums. In the fall of 1997 Alfonso released his first book ‘Coffee, Jazz and Poetry’ which collected the first 25 issues of his ‘RALPH’ zine. In 1998, as an outgrowth of touring together, Alfonso collaborates on a jazz noir movie, ‘Vie de Nuit’, directed by Chris Hooper. The RALPH combo performed the soundtrack music live as the movie played behind them and Alfonso provided the spoken narration. The 25 minute film premiered November 22, 1998 at the ‘Vancouver Underground Film Festival’. Also in 1998, he performed solo spoken word in San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle and Portland. Soon the next album, ‘This Is For The Night People’, was produced by RALPH keyboardist/co-writer Tracy Marks. Alfonso tapped the talents of other musicians for the album including Lee Aaron (vocals) and Lauren Agnelli (bass) while Dave Rave produced two tracks (“Goodbye Jack. Kerouac.”, “That’s What Lonely People Do”) in addition to organizing the Hamilton mixing sessions. The “Kerouac” track was recorded at Blair Packham’s home studio during one of Ralph’s business trips to Toronto. The song featured Blair Packham (The Jitters) bass, Dave Rave (guitar), John Hamilton (Diodes) on snare, Gerry Duligal on sax, and Kevin Quain on wurlitzer piano. Alfonso also released his second book as a promotional companion to the album also entitled ‘This Is For The Night People’ which reprinted issues #26-50 of the ‘RALPH’ zine. By 2000 the CD had been released in several territories outside of Canada and peaked at No5 on the Canadian Campus Jazz Chart and Top30 on the Canadian Campus Radio Chart. The video for “Goodbye Jack. Kerouac” made No.6 on the Canadian BRAVO! arts TV channel and was then joined in the Top10 by the follow-up video for “Last Year’s Valentine”. Both clips were directed by Chris Hooper. The RALPH group toured across Canada in April 2001 on a double bill with Lee Aaron to phenomenal response. Alfonso also did solo a solo tour in 2002 as one of several acts on ‘The Storytellers Cabaret’ with Paul Hyde, Tom Wilson, Dave Rave, and Kathleen Edwards. The Patrick Jenkins directed documentary, ‘RALPH: Coffee, Jazz and Poetry’ screened at the Montréal Film Festival and has appeared CBC TV nationally on at least two occasions. The group recently then completed two months of a Wednesday residency at Vancouver’s Montmarte Cafe, wood-shedding & writing material for the next RALPH CD. In 2003 Alfonso expanded the roster of Bongo Beat, did a UK tour of the BongoBeat Revue, and re-activated the ‘RALPH’ zine. Alfonso still manages The Diodes and now operates an art gallery/cafe/record store/performance space in Montréal called BBAM! Gallery. He is also the publisher of Liz Worth’s book ‘Treat Me Like Dirt: An Oral History Of Punk in Toronto and Beyond’.” With notes from Ralph Alfonso.\n\nAlbum\n\n1995 Coffee, Jazz and Poetry (Bongo Beat) BB-1955\n\n1996 Olympia 66 [EP] (Bongo Beat) BB-1956\n\n1997 Sophisticated Boom Boom (Bongo Beat) BB-1957\n\n2001 This Is For the Night People (Vie de Nuit) (Bongo Beat)\n\n2009 Liverpool [3 song EP] (Bongo Beat) BB-2005\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n2002 “Early Morning Cold Taxi”, “Last Year’s Valentine”, and “Goodbye Jack Kerouac” on ‘Driving in the Rain 3am: Songs to Get Lost With’ (Bongo Beat) BB-1960\n\nRAM (1)\n\nWayne McGhie (vocals)\n\nWayne McGhie died July 20, 2017.\n\nSingles\n\n1972 Love Is the Answer/Love Is the Answer (Pt.2) (Tuesday) TUE-20\n\nRAM (2)\n\nGeorge Antoniak (guitar) / Donnie Chapman (drums) / Jack Harris (drums) / Terry Hatty (vocals, percussion) / Donnie Muir (keyboards) / Steve Naylor (keyboards) / Pat Riley (bass, vocals) / Terry Silverlight (drums) / Mike Sloski (drums)\n\nFormed in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1980; Chapman would go on to form the Mason-Chapman Band; Hatty has gone on to sing for a number of bands including a 1990s version of The Guess Who; Sloski is an in-demand session player and was also a member of the short-lived band Big Faith with Chris Tait (Chalk Circle), Ken Greer (Red Rider) and Fergus Marsh (Bruce Cockburn).\n\nSingles\n\n1980 Party Downs/Blue Moon Man (Nova) NS-51\n\n1980 Love You Girl/Tension (Nova) NS-52\n\n1982 Get Out/I Feel Your Pain (Nova) NS-53\n\n198- The Strap/[same] (Nova) NS-121\n\nAlbums\n\n1980 Soundtrack For Pegasus 1 (Nova) N2689-005\n\nRAM (3)\n\nCanadian funk/soul.\n\nSingles\n\n1980 Higher and Higher/Shopping Baby (Ram) CCL 45-554 I\n\n1981 Lovers/I’m So Proud (Ram) CRI-8107\n\nRAMASUTRA\n\nBorn: Ramachandra Borcar on December 2, 1971 in Montréal, Québec\n\nThis Montréal, Québec native has also composed film soundtracks under the name Ramachandra Borcar.\n\nSingles\n\n1999 Marder (4 mixes) [12″] (Tox) TOXSV-320\n\n2000 Snake In The Garden Remixes (3 mixes) [12″] (Tox) TOXSV-320\n\nAlbums\n\n1999 The East Infection (Tox) TOXCD-3032\n\n2003 El Pipo Del Taxi [5-song EP] (Semprini) SEMP001-CD\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n2003 “Magma Mama” on ‘Café Méliès – Volume 1’ (Jajou) JAJCD-816\n\n2006 “Magma Mama” on ‘Buddha-Bar: Ten Years'(George V) 409186\n\nRAMM, Ken\n\nKen Ramm is singer-songwriter, guitarist from Toronto, Ontario.

In 1995, their song “12”, from ‘Thoughts of Aggression’, was re-recorded by the band at the CBC studios and released as a video to Sesame Street. It has now been played around the world.

Their musical heritage began early as Mom (piano), Dad (violin) and the eldest Rankin children entertained the neighbours every third weekend as part of a Ceilidh. The tradition continued as the elder Rankins left home to be replaced by younger siblings. Five of the siblings began performing in 1989 following Raylene’s graduation with a law degree from Dalhousie University. With the help of her booking skills and a mail order business run by their mother, The Rankins released their own independent cassettes ‘The Rankin Family’ (1989) and ‘Fare Thee Well Love’ (1990) featuring original songs and the a combination of traditional jigs, reels and Celtic folk songs. They made their television debut on CBC’s ‘On the Road Again’ in 1989 and made an encore performance in September 1990 when footage from their summer performance at the Baddeck Festival of The Arts and the Winnipeg Folk Festival was televised nationally in a one hour documentary entitled ‘Here Come The Rankins!’. The group’s self-titled debut sold platinum (which was rare for an independent release) and put the band on the Canadian musical map. The follow-up was the quadruple-platinum selling smash ‘Fare Thee Well Love’ which was quickly scooped up for re-issue as their EMI Music Canada major label debut in 1992. It went on to sell over 500,000 copies. The title track was a Top40 hit in Canada and was subsequently licensed for a Disney movie in the U.S. That summer the singers performed on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for Queen Elizabeth II as part of the 125th Anniversary celebrations of Canada Day. Their first all new album for EMI was 1993’s ‘North Country’ which sold more than 350,000 copies. 1995’s limited edition ‘Grey Dusk Of Eve’ EP was certified gold with sales of more than 50,000 followed by the full-length ‘Endless Seasons’ which was produced by John Jennings (Mary Chapin Carpenter). In September 1999, The Rankins recorded the song “Jimmy Mo Mhile Stor” for The Chieftains’ album ‘Tears of Stone’ and soon issued a press release confirming that the group would be splitting up to pursue family interests and other careers. On January 16, 2000 John Morris Rankin was killed in a car accident in Cape Breton; Jimmy Rankin has released four solo albums; Raylene Rankin has released two solo. The three sisters run The Red Shoe pub in Mabou and still perform on their own which includes releasing a Christmas album entitled ‘Do You Hear…’. The group has won four JUNO awards (‘Group of the Year’, ‘People’s Choice Award for Canadian Entertainer of the Year’, ‘Single of the Year’ for “Fare Thee Well Love” and ‘Country Group of the Year’) and a dozen East Coast Music Awards. The Rankin Family played many high profile concert dates including headlining the Guinness Fest in Australia and New Zealand, and a U.S. tour that included an SRO concert with Mary Black at the Town Hall in New York City. They also performed at Molly Johnson’s Kumbaya Festival in 1995; The Rankins reunited in 2007 and released an album of material from their comeback tour. One of the founding members of the group prior to their rise to fame, Geraldine , died of a brain aneurysm on January 10, 2007. A new studio album was released in 2009 entitled ‘These Are the Moments’; Raylene Rankin passed away on September 29, 2012 after a lengthy battle with breast cancer. with notes from Kimberley Wotherspoon.\n\nSingles\n\n1992 Orangedale Whistle (EMI) CDPRO-638\n\n1992 Fare Thee Well Love (EMI) CDPRO-685\n\n1992 Gillis Mountain (EMI) DPRO-721\n\n1992 Rise Again (EMI) DPRO-773\n\n1992 Tramp Miner (EMI) DPRO-923\n\n1993 North Country/Ho Ro Mo Nighean Donn Bhoidheach – Ho Ro My Nut Brown Maiden (EMI) DPRO-986\n\n1993 Lisa Brown (EMI) DPRO-994\n\n1993 Turn That Boat Around (EMI) DPRO-995\n\n1995 Grey Dusk of Eve (EMI) CDPRO-1065\n\n1995 You Feel the Same Way Too (Album Version)/You Feel the Same Way Too (Edited Version) CDPRO-1161\n\n1995 The River (EMI) CDPRO-1171\n\n1995 Forty Days And Nights (Edited Version)/Forty Days And Nights (Album Version) (EMI) CDPRO-1255\n\n1995 Roving Gypsy Boy (EMI) CDPRO-1386\n\n1995 Borders/North Country/Roving Gypsy (Remix)/Rise Again (EMI)\n\n1998 Moving On/Orangedale Whistle (EMI) CDPRO-1701\n\n1998 Maybe You’re Right (EMI) CDPRO-1738\n\nwith THE RANKIN FAMILY, LIAM O MAONLAI\n\n1994 Grey Dusk Of Eve [4-song EP] (EMI) CDCLDJ-736\n\n1995 Grey Dusk Of Eve [5-song EP] (EMI) E25Q-7243-8-82013-2-2\n\nAlbums\n\n1989 The Rankin Family (Rankin Family) RFCD-89801\n\n1990 Fare Thee Well Love (Rankin Family) RFCD-9001\n\n1992 The Rankin Family [re-issue] (EMI) C2-99995\n\n1992 Fare Thee Well Love [re-issue] (EMI) C2-99996\n\n1993 North Country (EMI) E2-80683\n\n1993 North Country (Guardian – US) CDC-7243-5-55369-2\n\n1995 Endless Seasons (EMI) E2-832348\n\n1995 Compliments Of Canadian Airlines [5-song EP] (EMI) 00000 00001 2 3\n\n1996 Collection [4-song EP] (Grapevine – UK) RF-001\n\n1996 Collection [Enhanced CD] 72438-52969-0-1\n\n1998 Uprooted (EMI) E2-821203\n\n2002 Souvenir: 1988 – 1998 [2CD] (Capitol) 72435-38923-2-6\n\n2006 Reunion – Exclusive Tour Edition [2CD] (EMI) 09463-86173-2-7\n\n2006 Reunion (Longview) 90002-2\n\n2009 These Are the Moments (Maple Music/Universal) MRCD-6510\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1993 “Fare Thee Well” on ‘Into The West [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack] (SBK) K2-89049\n\n1995 “Sir James Baird” on ‘In Between Dances (Canadian Artists In Aid of Breast Cancer Research)’ (Attic) ACD-1431\n\n1996 “Fare Thee Well Love” on ‘Oh What A Feeling, A Vital Collection of Canadian Music (MCA) JUNO-25\n\n1997 “Sir James Baird” on ‘The Hanging Garden – Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture’ (Angel – US) 384490\n\n1998 “Maybe You’re Right” on ‘MuchMoreMusic’ (Universal) UMDG2-81074\n\n1998 “An Innis Aigh” [w/The Chieftains] on ‘Celtic Tides – A Musical Odyssey’ (Putumayo) PUTU-141\n\n2006 “Bell” on ‘Oh What a Feeling 3 – Juno Awards: Celebrating 35 Years of the Best in Canadian Music’ (EMI) 59829\n\nRAPHAELS, The\n\nDavid Leroux (lead vocals,lead guitar) / Claude Gravel (rhythm guitar, vocals) / Peter Christensen (bass guitar, vocals) / Daryl Wadsworth (organ, vocals) / Greig Lund (drums, vocals)\n\nFormed while all the members attended Rideau High School in Ottawa, The Raphaels (named after the Renaissance painter) landed shows as part of CFRA-AM’s ‘Big 12’ shows around the Ottawa Valley.

The band’s first single was 1980’s “Operation Airlift” b/w ” Tomorrow”on Guardian Records. They would record their debut album, ‘Honestly’, in 1982 which was released on Tom Atom’s Chameleon Records. The same year the single “Headbang” b/w “Wonderland” was released and sustained airplay for 4 out of 5 days on Q107’s ‘Rockwars’ competition and finally defeated by Van Halen’s “Pretty Woman” on the 5th day. Rapid Tears returned to the studio and released the EP ‘Cry For Mercy’ on Chameleon Records in 1984. Rapid Tears was in the midst of recording another full-length LP when the band broke up; Michael J. Miller went solo; Nemes would go on to form Infernäl Majësty in 1986; Brian Frank would go on to front Swedish heavy metal band Killer Bee. with notes from Michael J.

They became known for being one of the world’s premier Celtic bands. In 1990 two of the four founding members, Trevor Ferrier and Richard Murai decided to leave to pursue their own musical interests, and the band changed musical direction with the addition of Christian Frappier, Jeff Gill and Rich Greenspoon. Their music became more jazz-oriented and they were soon tagged with the “jazz fusion” label.\n\nAlbums\n\n1982 Na Cabarfeidh (Sometimes We Do This Musical Productions) JAK-002\n\n1984 Mad Plaid (Sometimes We Do This Musical Productions) JAK-003\n\n1987 Hard To Beat (Green Linnet) GLCD-1073\n\n1989 Primeval (Green Linnet) GLCD-1104\n\n1991 Space Piper (Green Linnet) GLCD-1115\n\nas NA CABARFEIDH\n\n1981 Stick It In Your Ear (Sometimes We Do This Musical Productions) JAK-001\n\nRAREFACTION\n\nAubrey Winfield (lead vocals) / Bob Bartolucci (guitars, background vocals) / Mitch Starkman (bass, keyboards) / Rick Skol (drums) / Russell Myers (keyboards) / Alun Davies (bass; replaced Starkman)\n\nRarefaction’s “I Dreamt” received significant college and alternative rock radio airplay especially on CFNY-FM in 1985. The band’s lone single “Abstract Minds” were used in an episode of TV show ‘Degrassi: Next Generation’. Both songs were written by producer/engineer Aubrey Winfield and Bob Bartolucci; Winfield would go on to run the recording studio Winfield Sound and, later, The Orange Lounge producing such acts as Jakalope, B2Krazy, The Palace At 4 A.M. and more.\n\nSingles\n\n1985 Abstract Minds/I Dreamt (Irresponsible) WRC3-3992\n\nAlbums\n\n1985 Ordinary Man (Jaffa) JAFFA-001\n\nRASCALZ\n\nRed 1 (MC) / Misfit (MC) / Kemo (DJ)\n\nFormed in 1989, this Vancouver trio’s intricate rhymes and unconventional production techniques helped them bridge the gap between radio and the visual medium of video. The group’s independent debut album, ‘Really Livin”, was picked up by Calabash Records in 1994 but despite being remixed and repacked, went virtually unnoticed despite its wide distribution through Sony. The act re-invented itself with ‘Cash Crop’ on BMG in 1997, which achieved the highest debut at No.81 on SoundScan Canada’s retail albums chart, and the lead single, “Dreaded Fist”, was played on more than 40 radio stations in the U.S. They earned three JUNO Award nominations in as many years and in 1998 snubbed the JUNO ceremonies outright due to their view that the JUNO Awards were neglecting and ghettoizing urban music. Many Canadian acts have since rallied against the same cause. This backlash has made both the industry proper and the JUNO nominating committee re-assess the future of their business. Also in 1998, Rascalz released the non-album track “Northern Touch” featuring guest rappers Checkmate, Kardinal Offishall, Thrust and Choclair. The song became the biggest Canadian hip hop hit on the back of the Little X directed music video. The song was added to future pressings of their ‘Cash Crop’ album. The song won the group a JUNO Award in the newly created Rap category in April 1999 and the group consented to performing it on the awards show telecast. Rascalz/ long-awaited follow-up album, ‘Global Warning’, mushroomed into a sprawling two-disc affair, and was finally released in the fall of 1999. The trio released ‘Reloaded’ in 2002 and split up shortly thereafter; Red 1 released his first solo album, ‘Beg For Nothing’, in 2007.\n\nSingles\n\n1993 Really Livin’ (3 mixes)/Funky Migraine (2 mixes) [12″] (Calabash) 49-3203\n\n1993 Funky Migraine (7 mixes) [12″] (Calabash) 49-3217\n\n1995 Blind Wild Da Science (3 mixes)/Solitaire (2 mixes) (Figure IV Entertainment) FF-1234-2\n\n1997 Dreaded Fist (3 mixes)//Clockwork (2 mixes)/FitnRedi (Riding West Outlaw Mix) [12″](Figure IV Entertainment /ViK/BMG) KD-51595\n\n1997 Soul Obligation (2 mixes)/Chat’Bout (Extended)//Soul Obligation (2 mixes) [12″] (Figure IV Entertainment/BMG) FIV-1202\n\n1998 Northern Touch (BMG)\n\n1999 Priceless [w/ESTHERO] (Vik./BMG)\n\n1999 Gametime/Sharpshooter (Vik/BMG) 74321-70479-2\n\n2000 Crazy World [w/NOTCH and SAZON DIAMANTE] (Vik./BMG)\n\n2000 Can’t Relate (3 mixes)/On The Run (3 mixes) [12″] (Vik/BMG)\n\n2001 Témoin (4 mixes)/High Noon (3 mixes) [12″] (Figure IV Entertainment) KD-51737\n\n2002 Crazy World (3 mixes)/Jungle (4 mixes) [12″] (BMG) KD-51999\n\n2002 Crazy World (3 mixes)/Filthy (2 mixes) [12″] (ViK/BMG) KD-52044\n\n2002 Movie Star (Radio Version – Clean)/Movie (Instrumental) [12″] (Figure IV Entertainment/BMG) KD-52030\n\n2020 Dreaded Fist/Dreaded Fist (Bonus Beats)/Soul Obligation[7″] (FlipNJay/Figure IV Entertainment) FNJ-012\n\nas THE RAGGA MUFFIN RASCALS\n\n1993 Buggin’ To The Boogie/Really Livin’/[split w/WHO LAGEN] [12″] (Calabash – US) CAL-6201\n\nwith RASCALZ, BARRINGTON LEVY, K-OS, JAHFUS\n\n2000 Top Of The World (5 mixes) [12″] (Arista/ViK/BMG) 74321-874-751\n\nwith RASCALZ, KARDINAL OFFISHALL, THRUST, CHOCLAIR, CHECKMATE\n\n2020 Northern Touch/Northern Touch (Instrumental) [7″] (FlipNJay/Figure IV Entertainment) FNJ-001\n\nAlbums\n\n1993 Really Livin’ [re-issue] (Calabash/Epic/Sony) CALK-2234\n\n1997 Cash Crop Sampler [cassette] (Figure IV Entertainment/ViK/BMG) KJK1-51602\n\n1997 Cash Crop (ViK/BMG) BG2-45909\n\n1999 Global Warning (ViK,/BMG) 74321-67227-2\n\n2002 Reloaded (ViK,/BMG) 74321-88103-2\n\nas THE RAGGA MUFFIN RASCALS\n\n1992 Really Livin’ [cassette] (Calabash)\n\nwith RASCALZ, KARDINAL OFFISHALL, THRUST, CHOCLAIR, CHECKMATE\n\n2018 Northern Touch Anniversary Remixes [5-song 12″ EP] (ViK) 19075865891\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1993 “Really Livin’” on ‘New Stuff Seven’ (MMS) NSCD-007\n\n1999 “The Man That I Am” on ‘Much @ Edgefest 1999’ (MCA)\n\nwith with RASCALZ, KARDINAL OFFISHALL, THRUST, CHOCLAIR, CHECKMATE\n\n2001 “Northern Touch” on ‘Oh What a Feeling 2: A Vital Collection of Canadian Music’ (CMC) 0885\n\nRATIONAL YOUTH\n\nVERSION 1 (1980-1981): Tracy Howe (synths, vocals) / Bill Vorn (synths) / Mario Spezzo (synths; 1981);\n\nVERSION II (1982-1983) : Tracy Howe (synths, vocals) / Kevin Komoda (synths; 1982-1983) / Denis Duran (bass; 1983) / Angel Calvo (drums, percussion; 1983);\n\nVERSION III (1984-1986): Tracy Howe (synths, vocals) / Rick Joudrey (bass; 1985-1986) / Owen Tennyson (drums; 1985-1986) / Kevin Breit (guitars; 1985-1986) / Peter McGee (guitars; 1984-1986) / Jim MacDonald (keyboards);\n\nVERSION IV (1998): Tracy Howe (synths, vocals) / Dave Rout (synthesizers) / J.C.

At 13 he got an electric guitar, but joined his first band as the singer only that same year. He sang in a series of groups during his teenage years before taking up the drums with The Normals who were a three-piece punk band in Montreal around 1978 and featured members Scott Cameron on bass and Robert Labelle on guitar (Labelle would go on to join American Devices). From there came the formation of Heaven Seventeen (not to be confused with Britain’s Heaven 17 who were Montreal’s first self-proclaimed post-punk group – a sort of John Foxx-era Ultravox – who were one of the first generation punk conglomerations to use synths. The band’s lineup was quite unstable but the most solid configuration consisted of Scott Cameron (bass, vocals), Roman Martyn (guitars), Kim Duran (guitars), Lysanne Thibodeau (keyboards), and Tracy Howe (drums, vocals). Lysanne would be replaced by future Men Without Hats frontman Ivan Doroschuk at which time Howe stopped drumming and became their singer. In early 1980 Marc Durand was managing the band and had landed them a gig opening for XTC at the St. Denis Theatre in Montreal. While playing their set, some punks became rowdy and narrowly missed Doroschuk with a beer bottle or two and after the gig he quit the band. It was shortly after that he started Men Without Hats and took Marc Durand with him. By 1983 Heaven Seventeen had broken up and Doroschuk asked Howe to join his new band Men Without Hats as the guitar player. The band at that time was Ivan Dorochuk, his brother Stefan on bass, and Jeremie Arrobas on drums. They had all been to the same private schools together in Outremont and rehearsed at Arrobas’ parents’ house – a mini-mansion on Mount-Royal. His father had bought them all their musical equipment and paid for the production and manufacture of their first record, the ‘Folk Of The 80’s’ EP. Howe did not play on that record though he is credited as such. Roman Martyn actually did all guitar parts on the EP and Howe’s sole work with the band amounted to the song “Freeways”, a 7″ B-side. Ivan Dorochuk was primarily leading the band and his vision of the future and Howe’s didn’t connect, but Doroschuk did turn Howe onto the underworld of which gave Howe the idea to do electronic music, and shortly thereafter he met Bill Vorn. Rational Youth (a play-on words of the name National Youth Orchestra) was formed in Montreal in the summer of 1981 by Tracy Howe and Bill Vorn. Marc Demouy, a record importer and retailer friend of Howe’s, suggested they release a record and within months Rational Youth had their first single and 12″ “I Want To See The Light” (featuring third keyboardish Mario Spezzo), on Demouy’s newly formed YUL Records label. Live dates followed and by their second gig they had already done an opening slot for Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark. In the spring of 1982, came the ‘Cold War Night Life’ album, which would spawn two dance 12″ singles “Saturdays In Silesia” and ‘City Of Night’. It was at this point, with the singles getting major Canadian airplay that the live shows were not quite living up to expectations, so the duo was augmented with yet another synth player, Kevin Komoda, who managed to sneak onto the final sessions for the album. ‘Cold War Night Life’ would go on to sell 20,000 copies independently in Europe and Canada (most in Alberta of all places) and the limelight began shining on the band. Vorn, who merely wanted to play music and not be a rock star, left Rational Youth at the beginning of 1983 to resume communications studies at University. Howe and Komoda were left to carry on so they grabbed Denis Duran and Angel Calvo (who had drummed on the single version of “Pile Ou Face”), and went back on the road for a cross Canada tour. In the spring of 1983, Howe was signed to Capitol Records and Rational Youth was picked up as his project – the result was the 5 song EP ‘Rational Youth’. On the eve of a national tour the entire band, realizing that this would be a full-time commitment, quit and Howe was stuck with a name but no band. Komoda went on to host the CBC’s Brave New Waves and later formed Montreal’s Pest 5000; Denis Duran is in the airline business and Angel Calvo is currently missing in action. Despite the dissolving band, Capitol Records asked Howe if he wanted to record another record and so teamed up with Klaatu guitar/production whiz and fellow labelmate Dee Long to work on the next record. They spent all of 1984 reworking mixes of tracks from the 1983 EP and writing new material. Some of Toronto’s best know musicians were brought in to augment the line-up: guitarist Steve Jensen (Zappacosta), vocalist David Roberts, Karen Hendrix and John Jones (Duran Duran), drummer David Quinton (The Mods, Strange Advance), bassist Spider Sinnaeve (Streetheart), violinist Ben Mink (FM, k.d. lang) and of course Dee Long himself as producer, engineer, keyboardist and guitar player. The sessions were released as Rational Youth’s next album ‘Heredity’ in March of 1985. It was a far cry from the synth pop of ‘Cold War Night Life’ and the lead off single/video “No More And No Less” was released to great critical acclaim. Howe put a new rock band together with album guitarist Peter McGee and former members of Blue Peter, Rick Joudrey (bass) and Owen Tennyson (drums), for a road tour of small venues throughout 1985 and into early 1986. On the odd occasion co-headlining with Strange Advance, The Spoons, Gowan and Images In Vogue. They even did a date opening for China Crisis. Several follow-up singles failed to sustain Rational Youth as a major league contender and Capitol Records passed on renewing Howe’s option. Despite a brief appearance as ‘the band’ in the Montreal filmed Kiefer Sutherland movie ‘Crazy Moon’ in 1986, Howe, effectively killed off Rational Youth and set up a domestic life and became gainfully employed at Queens Park for the Ontario Government. In February of 1996, EMI Canada released a 17-track Rational Youth compilation CD entitled ‘All Our Saturdays (1981-1986)’. The disc’s release has, through the efforts of fans on the Internet, brought Howe and Vorn back together again; Vorn had continued putting music, art, and technology together with his crowning achievement being interactive robotic installations with Louis-Philippe Demers. With the year-end release of ‘Cold War Night Life’ on CD, the duo played a synth-pop festival in Sweden in December 1997 to much critical acclaim but Vorn has been cautious in not wanting to give up his day job for the role as a ‘rock star’ again. Rational Youth was officially revived by Tracy Howe in 1998 with the addition of former Digital Poodle members Dave Rout & J.C.

Their first LP, ‘Voices’, was nominated for a CFNY-FM U-Know Award in 1985 for ‘Best Independent Artist’. The band took a brief hiatus while Walsh joined former bandmate Allan in Figures At Dawn to record and tour their self-titled debut LP. After the disbanding of FAD, Walsh picked up the pace with Rave Revues once more and they returned to release 1987’s ‘Rave Revues’ LP — this time featuring vocalist Dave Preston (who replaced Wolfe Bolter); Wolfe Bolter died after a lengthy illness on February 28, 2019.\n\nSingles\n\n1981 Blue Eyes [4 song 7″ EP] (World)\n\n1985 Long Time Coming/Rule of Play (World)\n\nAlbums\n\n1984 Voices (World)\n\n1987 Rave Revues (Cheezie Muzik/Trend) ACR-12872\n\nRAVE, Dave\n\nBorn: David Desroches in Hamilton, Ontario\n\nHamilton, Ontario native Dave “Rave” DesRoches grew a solid musical pedigree initially with his group The Shakers in the late ’70s/early ’80s. The band charted many independent singles on their own Warpt Records label and released three albums with producers Daniel Lanois (U2, Peter Gabriel, Bob Dylan) and Jack Richardson (Guess Who, Alice Cooper). Rave was at the same time doing double-duty as an auxiliary member of Hamilton’s Teenage Head, both live and in the studio, prior to becoming lead vocalist for the band’s final original album – ‘Electric Guitar’. After deciding to go solo in 1989 he recorded the landmark ‘Valentino’s Pirates’ album alongside producer Gary Pig Gold. The two then moved to New York City, forming The Dave Rave Conspiracy and becoming the first North American band directly signed to Russia’s state-run Melodiya record label. To appease cold war era Russian sensibilities however, their name was changed to The Dave Rave Group, and it was under this name that ‘Valentino’s Pirates’ was released in the USSR. Press surrounding the album included a CBC television documentary for which they visited Russia, filming footage for three promotional videos that received rotation on Much Music in Canada. Reverting back to the Conspiracy name, Dave and Gary alongside Billy Ficca (Television), Lauren Agnelli (ex-Washington Squares) and Coyote Shivers then recorded the ‘Three Octave Fantastic Hexagram’ album and began touring North America extensively until disbanding in 1994. Soon after, Agnelli and Rave would form a duo which released three albums over the next several years: the critically acclaimed ‘Cowboy Flowers Sessions,’ ‘Heaven and Earth,’ and the ‘Confetti!’ compilation. Gary Pig Gold and Shane Faubert (ex-Cheepskates) with their To M’Lou Music label gave ‘Valentino’s Pirates’ a lavish US and European tenth-anniversary CD release in 2001, and Gold’s relationship with Bullseye Records led the album to be re-issued in Canada as well. The success of this led to Rave being signed to Bullseye for a multiple release licensing deal that included the CD re-issue of The Shakers’ ‘In Time’ and a new studio album. Rave also put together his first jazz/pop album with guitarist Mark McCarron called ‘Another Side of Love’ on Ralph Alfonso’s Bongo Beat label. Meanwhile, with a new set of band members under The Dave Rave Group moniker, Rave released ‘Everyday Magic’ in 2003 featuring a cast of players from his former bands plus American performers Joe Mannix and Kate Schrock. The songs “Love Fades” and the title track – featuring ECMA winners and Juno nominees The Trews – received substantial airplay in multiple radio formats. A North American tour called ‘The Grand Song Caravan’ soon followed. It began in British Columbia with Rave, Paul Hyde (Payolas), Tom Wilson (Blackie & The Rodeo Kings) and Kathleen Edwards but as fate would have it, Edwards’ career exploded overnight and she had to leave the tour for performances on US television. Wilson would jump over to the Jann Arden tour as an opening act leaving Rave and Paul Hyde without a tour package to promote. Rave called up his American friends Joe Mannix and Kate Schrock who joined Hyde and Rave in Ontario where the tour continued through the summer and early fall of 2003. For the first half of 2004, the tour continued stateside (less Paul Hyde) to sold out cities and more airplay. Rave, along with some Hamilton-area friends under the name The Wretches, would also release a cover of George Harrison’s “Here Comes The Sun” on ‘It Was 40 Years Ago Today: A Tribute To The Beatles’. 2005 was spent working on songs with others – including co-writing with The Trews. A 2-CD anthology of Dave Rave’s recording career was released on Bullseye Records in 2006. In 2007, Rave also released his second jazz-pop album with musician Mark McCarron entitled ‘In The Blue of My Dreams’ on Bongo Beat Records. Rave would achieve his greatest success starting in 2010 with the BongoBeat release ‘Live With What You Know’ featuring the US Top40 hit single “Anne-Marie” and solid live international tour dates with over 80 shows a year in Canada, the U.S. and Europe; Rave has been a regular songwriting contributor to albums by The Trews and has partnered with Minnesota act The Governors for several albums; in 2016 Rave became the new lead singer for Hamilton punk band Teenage Head. with notes from Dave Rave, Lisa Millar, and Gary Pig Gold.

Dave Carlo, M-Bro and Mike Campagnolo realized very quickly that the original material they were writing was something they all considered very special, so they auditioned extensively until finding Stace “Sheepdog” McLaren. In May of 1984 they went into the studio and recorded an independent EP which eventually went on to sell 1200 copies across Canada. This caught the attention of Attic Records and they signed the thrash band to a Canadian deal. Razor released three albums on Attic but after the third was released, the band felt it was essentially going nowhere. Attic had managed to get European distribution for their product but the promised release of their music in the US and Japan never materialized. Razor approached Attic and asked to be released from their deal; Attic complied. Band founder and leader Dave Carlo quickly formed his own label, Fist Fight, to handle Razor’s music, and worked out a deal with Fringe Records to license the product worldwide. They released two albums and then started having line-up problems which ended in Carlo being the only original member left. He recruited the musicians from existing metal band Samhain – Bob Reid replaced McLaren, Carlo’s brother Adam replaced Campagnolo and Rob Mills replaced M-Bro. Razor released two more albums on Fist Fight before conflicts within the new band meant pulling the plug on Razor in October 1992. Reid, Armstrong, and Mills re-formed Samhain under the new name S.F.H. and released two albums between 1992 and 1994. Carlo mended fences with his former band mates in 1996 and the existing line-up of S.F.H. – which included new drummer Rich Oosterbach at that time but minus their guitarist Danny Mayhem – effectively became the re-born Razor. They were then signed to Tom Treumuth’s Hypnotic Records and released the comeback album ‘Decibels’. At the turn of the millennium Mills returned to Razor and in 2005, Campagnolo returned to replace Armstrong. The band is still performing and recording to this day.

After playing anywhere and everywhere around Toronto with their energetic performances, the group recorded a 7” four song EP and released it on Tradition Records. They would return to the studio to record a Christmas single and their full-length debut, ‘Go To Town’, which found a home on Other People’s Music. The label parlayed that into a distribution deal with WEA Canada and the album received major distribution in 1988 and spawned a radio hit with the song “It’s Saturday Night”. The follow-up album, ‘Live a Little’, followed immediately after in 1989. The record was well received but didn’t sell as well as the debut and The Razorbacks would soon lose their record deal with WEA. They remained together through several line-up changes but Dekouchy and Myke kept the band going right into 1996.\n\nSingles\n\n1987 Calling My Name/Born Too Late//I’m In the Doghouse/So Much Fun (Tradition) TJD-101.\n\n1987 All the Girls Look Prettier At Christmas/A Gift (Tradition) TJD-103\n\n1988 It’s Saturday/Just This Short Of Cryin’ (OPM/WEA) 25-79297\n\n1988 So Much Fun/Razorbacks Boogie (OPM/WEA) 25-77567\n\n1989 Times Like These/Am I High (OPM/WEA) 25-75257\n\nAlbums\n\n1988 Go To Town (OPM/WEA) 25-56961\n\n1989 Live a Little (OPM/WEA) 25-63731\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1988 “Winter Wonderland” on ‘Reveillon’ (WEA) CDP-632\n\nREA, David\n\nBorn: David Ernest Rea on October 26, 1946 in Akron, Ohio\n\nDied: October 27, 2011\n\nBorn in Ohio, near Akron, in 1946, David Rea began playing Bach on the piano at age 5. By the age of 12, he was playing banjo and guitar. Smitten by the music of Merle Travis and Robert Johnson in his early teens, he also learned from the blues and bluegrass recordings that came north with the rubber workers in Akron’s factories. Late at night, under the covers, he’d listen to rock n’ roll records played by legendary DJs, who later became friends: Alan Freed, Mad Daddy, Big Wilson and Murray the K. In 1964, when he was 17, Rea moved to Toronto, Ontario where he had his first commercial success at the center of what was one of the world’s hottest acoustic music scenes. Rea would play some live shows with Gordon Lightfoot in the early years (1964/1965) before Lightfoot could afford full-time sidemen. He would perform his popular filigree guitar picking style on Lightfoot’s John Court produced self-titled album in 1966 and was soon asked by folk duo Ian & Sylvia to join their backing band. Rea would go on to add his guitar style to the Ian & Sylvia albums ‘Nashville’, ‘Lovin’ Sound’, ‘So Much For Dreaming’, and ‘Full Circle’. During this period both Neil Young and Joni Mitchell urged him to write his own material. Ian & Sylvia liked many of his songs and would record Rea’s “Pilgrimage to Paradise”, “The Minstrel”, and “Ninety Degrees by Ninety Degrees”. Having established himself as a top notch sideman, David Rea appeared with some of the finest artists of the 1960s including Ramblin’ Jack Elliot, Joni Mitchell, Richie Havens, Judy Collins and Tom Rush plus many veteran bluesmen such as Reverend Gary Davis, Mississippi John Hurt, Roosevelt Sykes, Lonnie Johnson, Skip James and Son House. In the late 1960s, Rea wrote and recorded songs with producer Felix Pappalardi (Young Rascals, Cream, Mountain). Their partnership resulted in two solo albums – ‘Maverick Child’ (1969) and ‘By the Grace of God’ (1971) – which featured assists from members of Mountain and the Young Rascals. Rea would also co-write several songs for Mountain including their massive hit “Mississippi Queen”, which sold Gold. In 1970, Rea played guitar on Jesse Winchester’s self-titled album produced by Robbie Robertson (The Band, The Hawks) and played on The Clancy Brothers’ ‘Show Me The Way’ and Judy Collins”Whales and Nightingales’. Following the departure of Richard Thompson as lead guitarist for Fairport Convention, Rea joined the group for ‘The Manor Sessions’ in 1972 which have never been officially released. His solo career resumed in 1973 with the Columbia Records album ‘Slewfoot’ featuring members of the Grateful Dead and New Riders of the Purple Sage. In 1975 ‘The Second Annual Farewell Reunion’ saw Rea hook up with Mike Seeger on an album that also included Ewan MacColl, Pete and Peggy Seeger, Kilby Snow, Roscoe Holcomb, Elizabeth Cotton, Ry Cooder, Maria Muldaur, The New Lost City Ramblers, The Highwoods String Band, Penny Cohen, Hazel Dickens, Tex Logan, Lesley Riddle, Don Stover, Eric Thompson and The Strange Creek Singers. In 1976, the CBC produced an opera written and composed by Rea inspired by the story of San Francisco’s eccentric, self-proclaimed Emperor named Joshua Norton. Its success was followed by several other CBC projects. In 1988, he created ‘David Rea’s Robert Johnson’ – a three-part series about the famous bluesman. Rea followed that with ‘Music Don’t Mind’ – a dissertation on the convergence of African and European music as the foundation for American music. Rea would be awarded the 23rd ‘International Gabriel Award for Excellence in Broadcasting’ for the Robert Johnson series. During most of the 1980s Rea took time to raise his three children, playing only short tours, selected festivals and recording projects such as a David Maloney album. Rea, however, remained active in writing new material which would eventually appear on the albums ‘Feelin’ Good’ (1986) and ‘The Brass Ring’ (1993). While on tour with Ramblin’ Jack Elliot in 1995, Rea fell in love with the Pacific Northwest and moved from California to Bainbridge Island just west of Seattle. In 1997 he released his 6th album, ‘Shorty’s Ghost’ on his own imprint, Gistu Recording. The album was co-produced with Michael Knapp and recorded live, in two sessions, in Placerville, California.
