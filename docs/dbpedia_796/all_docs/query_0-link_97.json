(Chinen)\n\nTim Berne (Tuesday and Thursday) This alto saxophonist and composer works in two contexts next week, each likely to showcase a different side of his tensile balance between abstract expressionism and intricate design.

On Thursday, as part of the Sound It Out series, he works in a duo with the pianist Kris Davis.

(Chinen)\n\nCrystal Magnets (Friday) The name suggests a Brooklyn indie-rock band, but it’s actually the handle of a dual-piano alliance between Andy Milne and Benoît Delbecq, inquisitive improvisers with an interest in manipulating timbre. Closing out a three-night residency, they play an 8:30 p.m. set as a duo, and then a 9:45 p.m. set with an impressive guest horn section: Greg Osby on alto saxophone and clarinet, Michaël Attias on baritone saxophone, Jacob Garchik on trumpet and Vincent Chancey on French horn. At Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $15 for two sets. (Chinen)\n\n40Twenty (Sunday and Thursday) This smartly rugged composing collective — Jacob Garchik on trombone, Jacob Sacks on piano, David Ambrosio on bass, Vincent Sperrazza on drums — just released its self-titled debut on the Yeah Yeah label, exploring an intersection of buoyant swing rhythm and complex harmonic coloration. The group plays an album-release engagement on Sunday; on Thursday it resurfaces with a special guest, the tenor saxophonist Ellery Eskelin. Sunday at 9 p.m., Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $10. Thursday at 8:30 p.m., I Beam, 168 Seventh Street, Brooklyn, ibeambrooklyn.com; $10 suggested donation. (Chinen)\n\nHenry Grimes Trio (Saturday) Mr. Grimes, a long-lost, load-bearing pillar of the 1960s avant-garde, plays bass and violin and reads poetry in this trio, featuring the academically inclined pianist Marc Medwin and the brilliantly dynamic young drummer Tyshawn Sorey. At 9 p.m., Somethin’ Jazz Club, 212 East 52nd Street, third floor, Manhattan, (212) 371-7657, somethinjazz.com; $15 cover, reservations recommended. (Chinen)\n\nIrabbagast Records Festival (Thursday and next Friday) The inexhaustibly creative young saxophonist Jon Irabagon has simultaneously released two albums on his new label, Irabbagast, which he celebrates with this two-night affair. On Thursday he leads two distinct trios: one featuring the bassist Mark Helias and the drummer Barry Altschul, distinguished veterans of the avant-garde (at 9 p.m.); and another featuring the guitarist Mick Barr and the drummer Mike Pride, a heavy-gauge pair who appear on one of Mr. Irabagon’s new releases, “I Don’t Hear Nothin’ but the Blues Volume 2: Appalachian Haze.” At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover per set, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)\n\nJoe Lovano and Dave Douglas: Sound Prints (Friday through Sunday) The saxophonist Joe Lovano and the trumpeter Dave Douglas share a bustling and approachable vision of jazz, geared toward expedition while grounded in post-bop custom. Sound Prints is their working band, a quintet capable of hair-trigger movements, featuring the drummer Joey Baron — a trusted colleague to both bandleaders, going back many years — along with the pianist Lawrence Fields and the bassist Linda Oh, younger players of evident promise. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)\n\nTony Malaby Tuba Trio (Wednesday) The tuba in question belongs to Dan Peck, the guts and in many ways the glue of this band. Tony Malaby brings his searching tenor saxophone, and his compositions; John Hollenbeck outlines texture as well as tempo on the drums. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (347) 422-0248, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10 donation is suggested. (Chinen)\n\nDonny McCaslin Group (Tuesday and Wednesday) “Casting for Gravity” (Greenleaf) is another compact but ambitious electro-acoustic venture — part gritty, part gleaming — by Donny McCaslin, a cool-headedly athletic tenor saxophonist and composer. The album features perhaps the best possible rhythm section for the task: Jason Lindner on piano and synthesizers, Tim Lefebvre on electric bass, and Mark Guiliana on drums, all of whom will be on hand here. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20 cover.

Ewart & Inventions (Thursday) This installment of the experimental Interpretations series will feature a tribute to the fairly obscure Mexican composer Nicandro Tamez, led jointly by his son, the guitarist Omar Tamez, and the trombonist Steve Swell. Also on the bill is Mr. Ewart, a multi-instrumentalist and multidimensionalist, presenting “Water Is Tops,” a piece of fluid focus, with the dancer-choreographer Ni’ja Whitson, the multi-instrumentalist J.D. Parran and others. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $15, $10 for members and students.
