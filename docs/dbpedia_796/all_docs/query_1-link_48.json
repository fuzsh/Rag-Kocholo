        "text": "After becoming the Season 22 champion of The Voice in December 2022, country crooner Bryce Leatherwood hit the ground running.\n\nHe first stole hearts with his Blind Audition of Conway Twitty's \"Goodbye Time\" and continued to wow crowds until he ultimately claimed the crown. The Georgia native is a showman to his core, and his velvety voice and charming stage presence not only helped him and Blake Shelton secure The Voice win but also set him up for a music career.\n\nRELATED: Why Bryce Leatherwood Says He 'Sobbed' After Winning The Voice\n\nLeatherwood's rustic charm and dreamy vocals are a match made in country music heaven, and fans can't get enough.\n\nBryce Leatherwood Songs\n\nAfter winning big on The Voice, Leatherwood signed a record deal with Universal Music Group Nashville in October 2023 and moved to the country music Mecca to work on his full-length debut album.\n\nIn the meantime, he's released a number of singles.\n\n\"The Finger\"\n\nLeatherwood released his first original single, \"The Finger,\" in December 2023. He premiered the track when he returned to The Voice stage during the Season 24 finale for a rousing guest performance, instantly getting the crowd grooving with the high-energy country ballad.\n\n\"Neon Does\"\n\nIn February 2024, Leatherwood released his second original track, the infectious \"Neon Does,\" which served as inspiration for his \"Neon Does Tour\" in 2024.\n\nHe discussed the track's creation in a February 2024 press release from Universal Music Group Nashville.\n\n\"The write happened pretty quickly. I was wanting to write something fun and upbeat that people would love to dance to,\" Leatherwood explained. \"Someone threw out the line' Neon Does,' and it immediately sparked thoughts of Brooks and Dunn's 'Neon Moon' and Chris Young's 'Neon.' Once that idea was shared, the song just came out … I think we had it written in less than 90 minutes!\"\n\nRELATED: A Recap of Bryce Leatherwood on The Voice Season 22\n\nWhile on his Neon Does Tour in April and May 2024, Leatherwood updated fans about life on the road on Instagram and social media.\n\n\"The One My Daddy Found\"\n\nTo show his mom some love for Mother's Day 2024, Leatherwood dropped a Hallmark-worthy single, \"The One My Daddy Found,\" his third original since winning The Voice. The track is a tribute to his parents' 25-year marriage, and the accompanying music video effortlessly tugs at the heartstrings as Leatherwood's most vulnerable release.\n\n\"Still Learning\"\n\nAnd the hits keep coming. The Season 22 Voice winner dropped his fourth single, \"Still Learning,\" in June 2024.\n\nBryce Leatherwood's Cover Songs\n\nLeatherwood also loves sharing acoustic sessions of beloved classics on his personal Instagram.\n\nRELATED: Bryce Leatherwood's Country Spin on This Adele Hit is So Soothing and Effortless\n\nThe Voice champion is a known cover king, and fans have enjoyed his twist on Miley Cyrus' \"Angels Like You,\" \"Things I Never Told You\" by Parker McCollum, and William Michael Morgan's \"Cheap Cologne,\" to name a few of his iconic sets.\n\nBryce Leatherwood at the Grand Ole Opry\n\nIn September 2024, Leatherwood will cross off a life-changing milestone by performing at the Grand Ole Opry for the very first time.\n\nHe shared a video to TikTok in June of himself reacting to the invitation by tearing up.\n\n\"I can’t express just how much this means to me y’all, \" he captioned it. \"The biggest dream of mine on the biggest stage in country music. See y’all in the circle.\"\n\nLeatherwood will head to Missouri to perform at Arrow Rock Lyceum Theatre in October. Fans can buy tickets and get performance details on Leatherwood's website."
