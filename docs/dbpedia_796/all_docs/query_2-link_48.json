        "text": "FRIENDSHIP share brand new single ‘Clairvoyant’ and announce new albumDreamin’\n\nOut November 8th on Orindal Records\n\nPhiladelphia band Friendship have returned today with a brand new track and news of a second album to be released 8th November on Owen Ashworth’s Orindal Records (Gia Margaret, Claire Cronin, Advance Base). They’ve shared lead single Clairvoyant.\n\nThe contemplative alt-country songs on new album Dreamin’ were recorded to tape in July last year with the help of The Low Anthem’s Jeff Prystowsky, andClairvoyant is a thank you note to a friend who offered support during a tough period; “You asked if I’d been crying lately / I said “how can you tell?” / You said “I’m clairvoyant, baby”\n\nTalking about the track, Wriggins said: “I wrote “Clairvoyant” a couple days after seeing Willie Nelson perform in Camden, New Jersey at the BB&T Pavilion. My friend Mark had won tickets from a radio station, but had to bail the day before, so he gave me the tickets and I went alone. This is only tangentially represented in the action of the song. But I think it’s pertinent given Willie’s (and one or two others’) creepy ability to read minds.”\n\nFriendship have retained a loyal cult following since their first offering in 2015, You’re Going to Have to Trust Me, which was released on Burst and Bloom Records that year. An EP on Sleeper Records and another record on their current label Orindal Records followed in 2017 – the acclaimed Shock Out of Season, bringing us forward to late 2019; when they will release their wonderful new album Dreamin’ on 8th November again via Orindal Records.\n\nLauded songwriter Dan Wriggins’ lyrics touch on both the smallest and the most significant moments that occur within human interaction. He reflects on those moments with a sharp wit, keenly observing and eloquently putting into words the unimportant twists and turns that over time become important – that become our experiences, our relationships, our lives. Dreamin’ offers hope with one hand and takes it away with the other. Immersed within swathes of lush Americana guitars, keys, soft, expressive drums and the haunting wail of a pedal steel, on Dreamin’, Friendship sounds more like Friendship than ever before."
