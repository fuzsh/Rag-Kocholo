The song is directed toward a man who had been abusing Eve's best friend.\n\nIn 2001, the official remix featuring American singer Faith Evans was released from Eve's second studio album Scorpion.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Eve and her best friend Andrea were in high school, Andrea was in love with a man, with whom she became pregnant. The man had become increasingly abusive toward Andrea, culminating in him severely injuring her in a case of domestic violence.[1] It led Eve to write the song, in which she recounts the abuse and raps to the man who was responsible: \"I don't even know you and I'd kill you myself / You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf / Wouldn't let her go to school and better herself / She had a baby by your ass and you ain't giving no help\".[2][3] The last verse of the song tells a fictional story in which Eve's friend has been killed by her partner and Eve exacts revenge by shooting and killing the abuser.[4][5]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song received mostly positive reviews from critics.[4] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post[2] and Jeff Nieser of Miami New Times[5] both regarded it as the best track from Let There Be Eve, while Greg Tate of Rolling Stone called it \"bold\" and \"smart\".[4] A Dayton, Ohio radio programmer also praised the overall message of the song, but questioned the ending: \"She shoots the guy. I mean, what is that saying to kids? That revenge is the answer?\"[6]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe official music video for \"Love Is Blind\" was directed by Dave Meyers. It depicts a man attacking a woman repeatedly and in front of their children, and the eventual death of the mother.[4]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1999–2000) Peak\n\nposition US Billboard Hot 100[7] 34 US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard)[8] 11 US Hot Rap Songs (Billboard)[9] 1 US Rhythmic (Billboard)[10] 11"
