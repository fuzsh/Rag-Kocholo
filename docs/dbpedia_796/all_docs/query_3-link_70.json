        "text": "We spoke with the talented psychedelic rock artist from Brooklyn, HNRY FLWR. Year after year, HNRY FLWR has built himself up and never ceases to surprise. His love of music and image, and his powerful live shows bring a powerful new experience. After 2 years preparing his album, Groover was instrumental in growing the visibility of the project again and unlock brand new opportunities. Check out his story and how Groover helped him boost his new releases, and even join their selective artist accelerator Groover Obsessions üî•\n\nSince working with Groover Obsessions my monthly listeners have doubled on Spotify, they have connected me with other industry people, and set up showcases for us at SXSW and New Colossus Festival in NYC. They have been incredibly supportive and I‚Äôm so happy I found them!\n\nHNRY FLWR\n\nHello HNRY FLWR! Can you tell us more about you and your music?\n\nWe updated our Spotify bio so i thought i‚Äôd just start with that!\n\nHNRY FLWR is the cult rock alter-ego of David Van Witt, who derives inspiration from his peculiar upbringing. Born in Belgium and raised in a meditation community in Iowa, Van Witt spent his childhood moving around the US with his single, clairvoyant mother who remembers her own birth. FLWR and his musical collective interpret these childhood memories through a spiritual, dreamlike lens for their debut album, VISIONS OF THE DAYTIME MOON.\n\nDuring the album‚Äôs 6-year writing process, FLWR incorporated meditation, drone music, hypnosis, improvisation, and other eclectic techniques to produce an indie rock record that is as imaginative as it is classic. In it, FLWR ponders the mysteries of life in poetic croons over a bed of psychedelic flutes, soulful piano, 70s guitars, bouncing congas, gospel choirs, new age beats, and innovative production. With his 7-piece band, HNRY FLWR proselytizes his imagined religion, praising the Infinite Void and building a cult-like following with electric, church-like live performances.\n\nHNRY FLWR‚Äôs band is an iconic NYC entity, gathering over 30 players on their roster throughout their six-year album process. Musicians on their upcoming album and seven preceding singles include co-producer Sam Cohen (Kevin Morby, Dangermouse, Sharon Van Etten), Jared Samuel (!!!, The Shins, Aldous Harding), Mattie Safer (The Rapture, Poolside), Rosie Slater (Darlene Love, Delicate Steve), Connor Grant (GOASTT), and Walter Fancourt (Yeasayer, Super Yamba Band).\n\nAccording to you, what would be the best conditions to discover your music for the first time?\n\nWe love making music videos, so I think if you don‚Äôt discover us at a live concert, the music videos give you a sense of who I am, and the world I‚Äôm building.\n\nHow did you come to create your project and do it seriously?\n\nI was traveling the world with an electronic band and wanted to get back to writing more traditional songs. I was studying magick and alchemy at the time and wanted to create a project that was more intuitive. I would make drone music and just meditate on memories of my childhood. It was just a bedroom solo project but when a friend heard a demo they asked us to play and I needed to put together a band.\n\nCan you present us with your band?\n\nThe band is sort of a collective that has had almost 30 players in it throughout our journey. Now the band is a solid six-piece band. Abdon Valdez plays drums and is the first member to join. Mattie Safer (The Rapture, Poolside) plays bass. Melanie Chambers plays keys and sings. Rosie Slater (Darlene Love, Delicate Steve) plays conga/percussion. And Henry Raker plays saxophone and flute.\n\nHow did you hear about Groover for the first time, and what made you decide to use the platform? At which stage was your project at the time?\n\nI heard about Groover from a friend in NYC. We used the program to try and get some music onto streaming playlists and we didn‚Äôt have much of a team or support at the time so it was nice to know someone would take the time to listen to our music in a guaranteed way.\n\n| Read also: How can you get on Spotify playlists\n\nDid Groover help you obtain opportunities?\n\nYes, we have gotten on hundreds of playlists because of Groover, got reviews and radio plays. We were even identified as one of the ‚Äú10 artists you need to know‚Äù on Rolling Stone en Espa√±ol (see here)!\n\nüëâ Discover the playlists currently available on Groover\n\nüëâ Get in touch with editors from Rolling Stone on Groover: Ricardo Dur√°n ‚Äì Daniel Flores ‚Äì Pablo Monroy\n\nYou‚Äôve joined the artist accelerator Groover Obsessions, how did this happen? Did you get new opportunities from it?\n\nI heard about Groover Obsessions through a friend in NYC. I was unhappy with how hard it was to get in touch with my distributor at the time and was looking for a change. I had recently finished my album and decided to send one of the songs via Groover. To my surprise, the co-founder listened to my track and answered me directly on the platform. The next thing I knew I had an entire team of support, pushing my music into the world. Since working with Groover Obsessions my monthly listeners have doubled on Spotify, they have connected me with other industry people, and set up showcases for us at SXSW and New Colossus Festival in NYC. I also got booked on BIRP.fm‚Äòs show from directly contacting them on Groover, so Groover & Groover Obsessions really work in sync. The Groover and Groover Obsessions teams have been incredibly supportive and I‚Äôm so happy I found them!\n\n| What is Groover Obsessions?\n\nIf you had to summarize the evolution of your project in a few steps (past, present and future), what would they be?\n\nWe started as a bedroom psychedelic rock project. Now we‚Äôre a six-piece band with a recording studio and a new album coming out this year. We‚Äôre hoping to build our team out further this year and hope to play in Europe this summer.\n\nWhat helped you develop the visibility of your music and your artistic project the most?\n\nI think finding a way to express yourself visually as a musician should be fun and rewarding.\n\nWhat would be your advice to artists just getting started in the music scene?\n\nPlay shows as often as possible. And start collecting recording equipment. If you can record yourself and put on a great live show, the rest will come.\n\nAre there hot news you‚Äôd like to share for HNRY FLWR?\n\nWe have just released a new single on April 7, 2023: The Mystery\n\nA few words to conclude?\n\nI love Groover & Groover Obsessions!\n\n‚Äî"
