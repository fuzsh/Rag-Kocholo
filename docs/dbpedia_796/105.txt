Seven years is a long time to wait between releasing albums. However for Claire Voyant, the wait was well worth it. Their newest release, Lustre, shows a dramatic overall improvement in their musical compositions and a maturity in their lyrics. From the opening title track, the album grabs you and doesn't let go like a long lost love. Each track is beautifully written and accentuated by Victoria Lloyd's amazing vocals, but just because the music sounds beautiful, it doesn't mean that every song is a happy one. Lustre weaves a rich emotional tapestry of the human spirit, but its up to you to decide what it means to you.
