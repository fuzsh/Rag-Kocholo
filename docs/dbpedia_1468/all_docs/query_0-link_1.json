        "text": "NONLINEAR PEDAGOGY AND\n\nTHE ATHLETICS SKILLS MODEL\n\nThis book offers an ecological conceptualisation of physical literacy. Re-embracing our\n\nancestry as hunter gatherers we gain a new appreciation and understanding of the impor-\n\ntance of play, not only in terms of how children learn, but also in showing us as educators\n\nhow we can lay the foundations for lifelong physical activity. The concept of physical\n\nliteracy has been recognised and understood throughout history by different communities\n\nacross the globe. Today, as governments grapple with the multiple challenges of urban life\n\nin the 21st century, we can learn from our forebears how to put play at the centre of chil-\n\ndren’s learning in order to build a more enduring physically active society.\n\nThis book examines contemporary pedagogical approaches, such as constraints-led\n\nteaching, nonlinear pedagogy and the athletic skills model, which are underpinned by\n\nthe theoretical framework of Ecological Dynamics. It is suggested that through careful\n\ndesign, these models, aimed at children, as well as young athletes, can (i) encourage play\n\nand facilitate physical activity and motor learning in children of different ages, providing\n\nthem with the foundational skills needed for leading active lives; and (ii), develop young\n\nathletes in elite sports programmes in an ethical, enriching and supportive manner.\n\nThrough this text, scientists, academics and practitioners in the sub-disciplines of motor\n\nlearning and motor development, physical education, sports pedagogy and physical activ-\n\nity and exercise domains will better understand how to design programmes that encourage\n\nplay and thereby develop the movement skills, self-regulating capacities, motivation and\n\nproficiency of people, so that they can move skilfully, effectively and efficiently while\n\nnegotiating changes throughout the human lifespan.\n\nJames Rudd is a senior lecturer in Physical Education at Liverpool John Moores University,\n\nUK; his research interests are in the areas of pedagogy, child development and motor learning.\n\nIan Renshaw is an associate professor of Human Movement and Sports Science at Queens-\n\nland University of Technology,Australia.\n\nGeert J.P.

The main aims of this\n\nbook are to revisit the original intentions behind the term physical literacy and explore\n\nits links with contemporary models of performance and learning in physical activity and\n\nsport. Whilst the concept of physical literacy has thrived throughout academic discourse\n\nand educational policy across the globe, the original intentions behind the term physical\n\nliteracy have become obscured (Bailey, 2020). Margaret Whitehead set out the idea of phys-\n\nical literacy at a conference in Australia in 1993, arguing that in order to support ongoing\n\nphysical activity, and ensure the healthy development of children, we need to ensure that\n\ntheir movement experiences are meaningful. She expressed concern that children’s play\n\nopportunities were being diminished and that the activities available to young people were\n\ntoo often over-organised, structured and professionalised, that is, led (coached, instructed,\n\ntaught) by adults with a performance agenda. Whitehead believed that this untimely pro-\n\nfessionalisation of children’s play activities diminished, or removed, the meaning of the\n\nphysical activity experience and, with it, the chances of children engaging in a lifetime of\n\nphysical activity. The authors of this book embrace the concept of physical literacy. We are,\n\nof course, not the first to do so, since academic discussion on this topic has flourished over\n\nthe last two decades (see Figure 0.1).\n\nIt is disappointing that this long-running discourse has not led to more innovative\n\nmethods of creating meaningful play and movement experiences for children through, for\n\nexample, better pedagogical design, infrastructure or social interaction, or more engage-\n\nment and exploration of the child’s voice to understand what meaningful movement expe-\n\nriences might be for them. Instead, the literature is full of endless academic debate over the\n\ninterpretation of what physical literacy is and how it should be defined. Indeed, Whitehead\n\nherself has changed her definition of physical literacy multiple times since the original\n\nintroduction in 2001 (see Table 0.1).\n\nNotwithstanding these shortcomings, the academic literature has been influential,\n\nleading to the integration of physical literacy into policy across the globe, including the\n\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation International Charter of\n\n2 Theoretical Positioning of Physical Literacy\n\nFIGURE 0.1 Physical literacy publications by year of publication from 2001 to 2020\n\nPhysical Education, Physical Activity and Sport. As we enter the 2020s, the promises made\n\nby academics, and reflected in policy documents, are starting to be questioned as govern-\n\nments are seen to be failing to deliver on their pledges to engage millennials. Generation\n\nZ is no more active or healthy than their predecessors, Generations X and Y, and indeed\n\nevidence suggests a further decline. The question that we are left with is: Has the prioriti-\n\nsation and adoption of physical literacy been nothing more than a vogue concept lacking\n\nin conceptual substance and depth which is destined to fall out of fashion to be replaced by\n\nsomething else that is shiny and new?\n\nThis book is a collaboration between seven academics within the field of human move-\n\nment and sport sciences (motor development, motor learning, pedagogical design and\n\npractitioner education). Together, we revisit the nature of physical literacy – a term which\n\nwas used to describe the movement quality of tribes indigenous to America in 1884 – and\n\nwe examine physical literacy through the lens of the contemporary theory of Ecological\n\nTABLE 0.1 Revisions of Whitehead’s physical literacy definitions between 2001 and 2017\n\n2001 The characteristics of a physically literate individual are that the person moves with poise,\n\neconomy and confidence in a wide variety of physically challenging situations. In\n\naddition, the individual is perceptive in reading all aspects of the physical environment,\n\nanticipating movement needs or possibilities and responding appropriately to these, with\n\nintelligence and imagination. Physical literacy requires a holistic engagement that\n\nencompasses physical capacities embedded in perception, experience, memory,\n\nanticipation and decision-making (Whitehead, 2001, p. 136).\n\n2007 The motivation, confidence, physical competence, understanding and knowledge to\n\nmaintain physical activity at an individually appropriate level, throughout life\n\ncourse(Whitehead, 2007, p. 2).\n\n2010 As appropriate to each individual endowment, physical literacy can be described as the\n\nmotivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding to maintain\n\nphysical activity throughout the life course (Whitehead, 2010, p. 11).\n\n2013 The motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding to value\n\nand take responsibility for maintaining purposeful physical pursuits/activities throughout\n\nthe life course (Whitehead, 2013, p. 29).\n\n2017 The motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding to value\n\nand engage in physical activity for life (IPLA, 2017).\n\nTheoretical Positioning of Physical Literacy 3\n\nDynamics which is a transdisciplinary space that blends ideas from ecological psychology,\n\nconstraints on dynamical systems, the complexity sciences, social anthropology and evolu-\n\ntionary biology. In Section 1, we seek to understand why the concept of physical literacy\n\nis still needed today and explore physical literacy from two different scales of analysis: at\n\nan individual level and at a community level. In Chapter 1, we explore the scale of the\n\nsocio-cultural constraints that we faced in the 2020s and seek to understand why current\n\nphysical activity interventions and traditional pedagogical delivery models are inadequate\n\nin developing meaningful movement experiences for children. In Chapter 2, we consider\n\nthe hunter-gatherer origins of physical literacy as well as exploring Whitehead’s original\n\ndefinition of physical literacy. Moving beyond this, we introduce three key principles to\n\nunderstand physical literacy: wayfinding, value and meaning and functional movement\n\nskills when conceived through an Ecological Dynamics framework. In Chapter 3, we\n\nagain explore physical literacy from an Ecological Dynamics rational, focusing on the ana-\n\nlytic scale at the higher community level and observe how local-global self-organisation\n\ntendencies supporting physical literacy to thrive through spontaneous play in the most\n\nunexpected places.\n\nIn Section 2 our examination of physical literacy moves beyond the current academic\n\ndiscourse as we begin to explore how we might operationalise this concept to create\n\nmeaningful movement experiences for learners (children, youth and elite athletes, and rec-\n\nreational sportsmen and women across the lifespan). This may seem like a bold ambition;\n\nhowever, we are enabled to make this leap because, whilst each individual is on their own\n\ndynamic and individual journey, the fundamental principles, or mechanisms for how we\n\nlearn to move, are the same for everyone, regardless of performance levels and needs. In\n\nChapter 4 we explore how motor learning theory has influenced pedagogical approaches\n\nright across the sporting landscape. Our aim in this chapter is, through the introduction\n\nof a Constraints-Led Approach (CLA) and representative co-design, to offer a contempo-\n\nrary approach which positions the learner at the core of the educational experience within\n\nphysical education, youth sport and high-performance sport. In Chapter 5 we introduce\n\na powerful pedagogical framework called Nonlinear Pedagogy (NLP) and show how\n\nadopting this approach can enable practitioners to reevaluate how they plan and design\n\nsessions, activities and lessons to support the learner on their physical literacy journey. In\n\nChapter 6 we continue to explore contemporary approaches as we consider the concepts\n\nof practitioners as Environment Architects and Environment Design Principles (EDP) and\n\nexplore how these might be used to support physical literacy. In Chapter 7 we introduce\n\nthe Athletics Skills Model (ASM), which has been implemented successfully across football\n\nacademies in the Netherlands and is being introduced into the United Kingdom to support\n\nthe physical literacy of current and future generations.\n\nIn Section 3, Chapter 8, we consider how physical literacy can be measured and sug-\n\ngest how an ecological conceptualisation can help unpick the complexity of measuring\n\nsomething that is, in essence, a process. The final chapter in Section 3 provides a summary\n\nof what has been covered and explores possibilities for practice to support physical liter-\n\nacy. Section 4, the final section of this book provides series of practical case studies from\n\nphysical education to high-performance sport where researchers are beginning to explore\n\nnew avenues of research to understand physical literacy through an Ecological Dynamics\n\nrationale.\n\n1\n\nTIME FOR A RETHINK\n\nWhy a New Approach to Physical\n\nLiteracy Is Needed\n\nKeith Davids and James Rudd\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nPlay is considered to be essential for optimal child development (Ginsburg, 2007). The\n\nUnited Nations High Commission for Human Rights states that play is a right of every\n\nchild, and yet, opportunities for children to play have diminished. Whitehead was not\n\nthe only academic back in the early 1990s who was concerned with children’s declining\n\nopportunities for play and a lack of meaningful movement experiences that were not under\n\nthe guidance of adults. In 1991, Kaplan predicted that, in the year 2000, the child would\n\nneed adults to defend their right to play, for society would evolve to provide children\n\nwith less time to play and increasingly value ‘more structure, more work and more adult-­\n\ndirected activity, even for young children (p. 398)’. Kaplan went on to state:\n\nThe child in the year 2000 will be subjected to greater pressures towards begin-\n\nning academic work early and will be asked to submit more and more to adult-led\n\nactivities. It is doubtful that television time will be reduced [this was prescient even\n\nthough the emergence of the smart phone, PC and associated online games were not\n\non Kaplan’s radar]. The child may thus have less opportunity to play and less oppor-\n\ntunity to direct his or her own play. (p. 398).\n\nToday, we see evidence all around us that confirms Kaplan’s prediction, such as the signif-\n\nicant decline in children’s walking or cycling to school over the past 30 years, which was\n\nnearly 50% in the 1970s but had declined to 13% by 2009 in the United States, with sim-\n\nilar downward trends across the globe (e.g., Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom,\n\nAustralia and New Zealand). Equally, there has been a shift with children’s top ten pre-\n\nferred play spaces transitioning from outdoors to indoors between 1950 and 2000 (Active\n\nHealthy Kids, 2014). Whilst the extent and exact reasons for this may be more complex\n\nthan Kaplan imagined, the explanation he put forward was certainly on the money.\n\nNotwithstanding, the benefits and importance of play are well understood today as\n\nshown by a clinical report produced by the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP)\n\n(White et al., 2018) which discusses the ‘power of play’ to transform children’s lives by\n\n6 Keith Davids and James Rudd\n\nhelping them to combat stressors of modern life and enhance their capacity for learning.\n\nThe AAP report committee advocates that general practitioners should be empowered to\n\nprescribe play activities for children in need of psychological, mental, physical, intellec-\n\ntual and social enrichment (Yogman et al., 2018). Going further, movements like the US\n\nCoalition for Play (https://usplaycoalition.org/) promote the health, well-being and social\n\nbenefits of inter-generational opportunities for play throughout the life course, recognis-\n\ning it as a vital activity for healthy development and the long-term functioning of humans.\n\nA key challenge internationally is that across large swathes of modern society play is seen\n\nas a secondary activity that resides behind formalised programmes of directed learning. In\n\nthe case of the latter, very young children are subjected to educational testing which serves\n\nto add pressure on parents and teachers to prepare children to pass tests, often at the expense\n\nof opportunities for play and for learning to learn. This ‘test-prescribe-test’ approach to\n\neducation was exemplified in 2018, when the UK government brought in universal test-\n\ning for children at the age of 4 years, upon entering formal education in schools. Another\n\nissue is that, as more parents work, children often have less ‘down-time’ in play spaces, at\n\nor near their home, because they are placed in pre- and after- school care. For those who\n\ndo have the time and freedom to play, the spaces to engage in non-­formalised play have\n\noften been reduced as land is bought up for development (https//www.­theguardian.com/\n\nsociety/2019/jun/02/tory-cuts-force-sale-710-local-football-pitches).\n\nAs a brief aside, it is worth noting that an unexpected shift in the levels of children’s play\n\nwas observed in local parks during the UK government’s COVID-19 lockdown between\n\nMarch and July 2020. Parks that were generally empty around 4–5 pm each evening were\n\nnow teeming with children and their parents playing games or riding bikes. Whether these\n\nplay opportunities were solely due to parents working from home or because organised\n\nsports programmes had been cancelled is moot. But what is interesting is that the desire\n\nto engage in spontaneously organised, inter-generational play activities re-emerged rap-\n\nidly when the opportunity arose. These opportunities for experiencing self-regulation in\n\ndynamic activity environments like games, playscapes, sports contexts and even urban set-\n\ntings like streets and gardens are at the heart of the enrichment of an individual’s physical\n\nliteracy.\n\n1.2 Physical Literacy and Play\n\nPlay is an excellent vehicle to develop physical literacy, as it is through play that chil-\n\ndren gain psychological, emotional and physical capacities. During play, children acquire a\n\nbroad range of movement skills, they learn to read (perceive information) and interact with\n\ntheir environment (self-regulate their decision-making and actions). We propose that the\n\nemergent tendency to (re)engage in spontaneous, imaginative physical activities is depend-\n\nent on the level of children’s functional capacities; for example, their perceptual-cognitive,\n\nphysical and social abilities, which are needed to underpin an individual’s engagement in\n\nplay. In most societies, children are not developing these skills. It could be said that ‘play\n\nbegets play’, in the sense that individuals taking opportunities to engage in spontaneous,\n\nmeaningful, imaginative and purposeful play experiences can become more attuned to\n\nthese opportunities throughout childhood, thus reinforcing their ongoing physical liter-\n\nacy journey. We also suggest that, at a fundamental level, play will have consequences for\n\nkeeping children safe through self-regulation in everyday environments. This is because\n\neveryday interactions with environments involve decision-making, problem-solving and\n\nNew Approach to Physical Literacy 7\n\n(re)organising movements. Examples include avoiding an approaching motor vehicle,\n\nnegotiating the waves at the beach and climbing over steep and uneven terrains. These\n\npotentially lifesaving activities are synonymous with capabilities developed during play\n\nsuch as jumping over a puddle or a kerb in the street or intercepting a ball at full stretch in\n\nthe playground or on the sports field (Rudd et al., 2020).\n\nIndividuals who have enjoyed rich and varied play experiences throughout their child-\n\nhood can be considered to have embarked upon a physical literacy journey that will equip\n\nthem to thrive within, and across, varied movement contexts over their lifespan. In mod-\n\nern societies, this is not a path that a significant proportion of today’s children are steadily\n\ntraversing along. Sadly, across the globe, most children do not have sufficient opportunities\n\nto engage in play. Instead, we are observing that physical activity is progressively declining\n\nwhilst sedentary behaviour increases, typically from the age of school entry (Van Hecke et\n\nal., 2016; Colley et al., 2017; Pearson et al., 2017). What we do know from contemporary\n\nmotor learning theories is that this trend can lead to many children of today having poorer\n\nmovement repertoires than those possessed by their parents and grandparents. Without\n\nthe development of a broad range of functional movement skills, other integral aspects of\n\nphysical literacy (physical fitness, perceptual skills to regulate actions and cognitive func-\n\ntions and capacities) which previous generations acquired subconsciously through daily\n\noutdoor play activities also fall by the wayside. This deficit has implications for the ability\n\nto learn and function in society as an individual’s capacities to discover, explore and act\n\nupon surrounding information from the environment are diminished (Rudd et al., 2020).\n\nWe know that it is a matter of great concern to governments throughout the world that\n\na lack of movement in children’s daily lives is likely to impact upon their physical, social\n\nand mental development, and that this will potentially shape their lives as they become\n\nadults. Research shows that, globally, the scale of the problem related to children’s inac-\n\ntivity is vast, with over 1.4 billion adults not meeting current guidelines of 60 minutes of\n\nphysical activity per day (Guthold et al., 2018), leading to more than 5 million premature\n\ndeaths per annum and an economic burden in excess of £50 billion per annum (Ding\n\net al., 2016). It is worth noting that these statistics are not just confined to countries where\n\na lack of physical activity might be explained by environmental constraints, such as places\n\nwhere it is cold and wet, or where there are long hours of darkness for much of the year.\n\nAustralia, a country blessed with a warm climate, prides itself on being a healthy nation\n\nwhere sport is an important part of its culture. Yet, current statistics tell a different story\n\nas Australian teenagers rank 140th out of 145 in a global table depicting national levels of\n\nactivity. In the United States of America, it is expected that, by 2030, one in two adults\n\nwill be obese, the prevalence of obesity will be higher than 50% in 29 states and not below\n\n35% in any state and nearly one in four adults is projected to have morbid obesity (Ward\n\net al., 2019; Rudd et al., 2020).\n\nThe prevalence of mobile phones, gaming computers, digital technology and media\n\nover the past two decades has also become a threat to activity levels. A recent Ofcom\n\n(2020) report (Table 1.1) indicated that the current generation of young people are vora-\n\ncious consumers of technology (so-called ‘digital natives’). These technological advances\n\nare creating a vastly different (socio-cultural, physical, emotional and psychological) envi-\n\nronment for children growing up, compared to that of their parents and grandparents. As\n\na result, children and young people in contemporary societies are often deprived of the\n\nopportunities that earlier generations enjoyed for engaging in play activities and gaining\n\n8 Keith Davids and James Rudd\n\nTABLE 1.1 Children’s media and technology usage from the ages of 3–11 years (Ofcom, 2020)\n\n3–4 years old 5–7 years old 8–11 years old\n\nUse a smartphone to 20% 27% 49%\n\ngo online 95%, 12 h 42 min/week 98%, 11 h 6 min/week 99%, 10 h 30 min/week\n\nWatch TV programmes 39%, 4 h 42 min/week 62%, 6 h 18 min/week 79%, 9 h 30 min/week\n\nor films 17% 35% 66%\n\nPlay video games for\n\nPlay games online\n\nrelevant psycho-social, emotional and physical skills needed to enjoy meaningful personal\n\ndevelopmental experiences (for more insights see box 1.1).\n\nThe challenges to modern societies, of a generation ‘raised with intense experiences of\n\nscreen technology’, have taken a toll on people’s mental and physical health and well-being.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, some medical training practitioners have reported students arriv-\n\ning for training as surgeons of the future with deficits in micro-movement skills needed to\n\nmanipulate instruments with care and precision (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/\n\nwell/live/surgeons-hobbies-dexterity.html).\n\nThese issues have been the subject of academic research in the fields of physical educa-\n\ntion, psychology, physical activity and the sub-disciplines of movement science for some\n\ntime. As noted earlier, to combat rising levels of physical inactivity there have been recom-\n\nmendations in many countries that children and adults should take part in moderate phys-\n\nical activity for a minimum of 60 minutes each day. A key question remains: 60 minutes\n\nof what? This lack of clarity has been compounded by the vacuous emphasis on reaching\n\nan arbitrary number of 10,000 steps per day to maintain physical activity levels. Clearly\n\nfocusing on frequency data alone, like minutes of activity or number of steps completed,\n\nBOX 1.1: PLAY IN HUNTER GATHERER SOCIETIES\n\nGlobal capitalism has been around for about 200 years, class stratification (chiefdoms\n\nand states) about 5000 years, simple farming and pastoralism about 10,000 years, and\n\nhunting and gathering at least hundreds of thousands of years (about 95% or more\n\nof human history). Foragers today are not Palaeolithic remnants, nor do they live in a\n\nworld isolated from global economic forces. But the few remaining hunter-gatherers\n\nin the world may provide insights into the value of children’s play and the failings of\n\nthe formal education systems. As we discuss in Chapter 2, in these societies life is very\n\ndifferent as children in early and middle childhood spend most of their day learning by\n\nplaying (Gosso et al., 2005; Konner, 2005). Hunter-gatherer children are active learners\n\nwho participate in learning by choice and need. This is largely because learning is an\n\nongoing, playful activity not separated from the rest of life. For example, children forage\n\nextensively, but this is voluntary and not expected by their parents (Crittenden, 2016).\n\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drJNIGOo0lI&feature=emb_title)\n\nThe future is, however, bleak for these societies and very few still exist. Sadly, with\n\ntheir demise, we will lose sight of rich concepts which help us to understand how chil-\n\ndren learn through wayfinding.\n\nNew Approach to Physical Literacy 9\n\nis not providing functional movement capacities for individuals to become active and to\n\nmaintain an active lifestyle. We believe that the answer is to focus upon making play and\n\nphysical activity more meaningful movement experiences and this is the focus of this book.\n\n1.3 What Do We Mean by Meaningful Movement Experiences?\n\nThere is growing evidence that playing outside with other children on sport fields, public\n\nspaces, natural habitats and playgrounds can enrich the broad physical and mental develop-\n\nment of children and youth (Davids, Brymer & Araújo, 2016). How, we might ask, can this\n\nenrichment process occur? In these varying situations, children need to learn to adapt their\n\nactions to environmental constraints such as different ambient temperatures, lighting levels,\n\nweather conditions and urban environments (such as uneven surfaces, presence of obsta-\n\ncles, varied inclines and lampposts in inconvenient locations). Quick learning is needed\n\nto look out for different, smarter, more adaptive behavioural solutions to make decisions,\n\nsolve problems and perform skills and create enjoyable games. The learning strategies that\n\naccompany playing outside in odd-shaped backyards, convenient public spaces and urban\n\nenvironments can have a substantial positive influence on the development of each learner’s\n\npsychological and physical health and well-being. From this vantage point, quantity and\n\ndose-response efforts like the UK-wide global initiatives such as the Daily Mile (https://\n\nthedailymile.co.uk/), where children run a mile around their school playground every day,\n\nwill do very little to enrich the functional skills needed to take up and maintain physical\n\nactivity in the long term. There is instead a need to reconnect each learner (children, ath-\n\nletes and recreational participants of all ages) to play in nature alongside the development\n\nof pedagogical frameworks that will help us to understand how we can facilitate learning\n\nopportunities for children to adapt fine and gross movement skills in coordinating actions\n\nin a variety of environmental settings, from stable contexts to more dynamic situations.\n\n1.4 Combatting This Problem by Thinking\n\nof Ourselves as Landscape Designers\n\nResearch that has analysed experiences of previous generations suggests that previously\n\npeople had significantly more opportunities to engage in a variety of different playscapes\n\npre- and during formal schooling. This observation has been supported by data from\n\nmotor development tests which, while not flawless, have been instrumental in consistently\n\nhighlighting decreases in test scores in different cohorts across the decades. For example,\n\nover the past few decades, children in Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States\n\nof America, the Netherlands and Australia, amongst other countries, have continually\n\nregistered lower scores on standardised tests of perceptual-motor skills, compared to pre-\n\nvious cohorts (Bardid et al., 2015; Morley et al., 2015; Rudd et al., 2016; Wormhoudt &\n\nSavelsbergh, 2018). Rudd et al. (2016) pointed out that these findings are indicative of the\n\nimpact of many socio-cultural changes shaping people’s behaviours at this time, including\n\nthe marginalisation of physical education in educational curricula globally, fewer oppor-\n\ntunities for unstructured play experiences in everyday life and reductions in open space\n\nfor children and young people to participate in play and active childhood pastimes. The\n\nevidence suggests that reduced opportunities for play are impacting children’s functional\n\nmovement capacities, as registered in differences across the cohorts. It is interesting to note\n\nthat the effects of changing playscape accessibility and design in modern societies have not\n\n10 Keith Davids and James Rudd\n\nonly had an impact on children’s functional movement skills but also on the depth of ped-\n\nagogical practices that practitioners (coaches, teachers, community workers) employ due to\n\nthe environments that they are situated in.\n\nThe Irene Marsh College of Physical Education (currently home of Liverpool John\n\nMoores Physical Education course) dates back to 1900 when Irene Mabel Marsh started\n\na revolution in physical education by demonstrating that girls, as well as boys, should\n\nreceive instruction in physical education. Since this time, IM Marsh Campus has been\n\nat the forefront of physical education and teacher training for over 100 years. For exam-\n\nple, IM Marsh’s innovative and feminist approach was pivotal through the late 1940s\n\nand 1950s, acting as an advocate for the application of Rudolf Laban’s work in modern\n\neducational dance, games and gymnastics as well developing ‘Moving and Growing’\n\n(Laban, 1952) and ‘Planning the Programme’ (Laban, 1953) both of which were pub-\n\nlished by the Department of Education in England. These texts promoted a curricu-\n\nlum and instructional model called a movement education, which included exploration,\n\nrepetition, discovery learning, versatility and quality in movement. This model was\n\nadopted in the late 1950s and 1960s but declined during the 1970s to be replaced by\n\nthe introduction of performance-related coaching at a time when traditional linear and\n\ncognitive theories of motor learning were the emerging vogue. Figure 1.1 highlights the\n\nopportunities that our current generation and local community of Aigburth, Liverpool,\n\nUK has lost.\n\nGill (2007) has lamented the fact that children are growing up in a risk-averse society\n\nwhere unstructured forms of play, interactions with nature and opportunities for adapting\n\nto more variable environments are constantly decreasing (see Figure 1.2). These opportu-\n\nnities for unstructured play are needed to enable children and adults to acquire, adapt and\n\nmaintain the requisite skills and capacities to sustain continued interactions from infancy\n\nto old age (Yeh et al., 2016).\n\nFIGURE 1.1 Irene Mabel Marsh Campus Liverpool John Moores University home of physical\n\neducation and sport courses (image on the left taken in 2020, image on the right\n\ntaken in 1950)\n\nNew Approach to Physical Literacy 11\n\nFIGURE 1.2 Common no ball game signs seen in today’s society highlighting the risk-averse\n\nsociety\n\nThe decline of rich landscapes that afford informal and unstructured play has been\n\naccompanied by the rise in modern playscapes that are highly symmetrical and lacking in\n\nthe variability and challenge needed for children and young people, beyond basic entry-\n\nlevel interactions. Adding more variability and designing asymmetrical playscapes (e.g.,\n\nchanging dimensions, properties like height, depth and shape) can help children to con-\n\ntinually adapt their actions and solve movement problems in negotiating the constraints of\n\nthe play area ( Jongeneel, Withagen & Zaal, 2015; see Figures 1.3–1.5).\n\nA major consequence of these reductions in opportunities for unstructured, exploratory\n\nplay and practice in modern society is the failure to enrich perceptual-motor skills, which\n\nact as a foundation for brain development and health (Walsh, 2004), and give children the\n\nFIGURE 1.3 E xample of playground that is largely symmetrical (distance between bars, depth\n\nand surface area) therefore affords climbing vertically\n\n12 Keith Davids and James Rudd\n\nFIGURE 1.4 Example of playground that is asymmetrical (variety of surfaces that differ in\n\nheight, depth and shape) and therefore affords a wide variety of movement skills\n\nto emerge\n\nfunctional capacities, motivation and confidence needed to learn more specialised skills at\n\na more advanced stage of development. Gibson (1979) referred to these functional char-\n\nacteristics of an individual as ‘effectivities’ which allow each person to negotiate complex\n\nenvironments. As Wormhoudt and Savelsbergh (2018) explained, this deficit of opportu-\n\nnities for play and practice impacts children’s ‘physical intelligence’, meaning their dimin-\n\nished capacity limits the capability to solve problems through their movements and actions\n\nas they negotiate complex performance environments. This deficit can also continue into\n\nadulthood, shaping parents’ child-rearing practices, and into older ages where individu-\n\nals may be inhibited from engaging in new movement activities, experiences and sports.\n\nWoods et al. (2020) argued that people need physical literacy to find their way confidently\n\nFIGURE 1.5 Example of natural asymmetrical natural playscape\n\nNew Approach to Physical Literacy 13\n\nBOX 1.2: KINDERGARTEN IN KYOTO, JAPAN, USING PRINCIPLES\n\nOF UNSTRUCTURED PLAY AND LEARNING IN\n\nCHILDREN’S DEVELOPMENT\n\nThere are some rare, but valuable, examples emerging of educational programmes,\n\nwhich are adult-led, but which retain principles of unstructured play and activity in\n\nenriched environments that promote children’s learning and development. For exam-\n\nple, this kindergarten in Kyoto, Japan, promotes learning in enriched playscapes which\n\nhave few boundaries which can class them as either indoor or outdoor: (https://www.\n\nted.com/talks/takaharu_tezuka_the_best_kindergarten_you_ve_ever_seen).\n\nAlthough adults are present, the children are free to explore their environment\n\nwhich is designed in a vast, circular playscape full of opportunities to perceive informa-\n\ntion and act upon it. These principles include self-regulation during learning, learning\n\nthrough physical activity, having fun and enjoyment and playing independently or in\n\nsmall groups. Evidence shows that some children were tracked over 6 km in an active\n\nlearning session.\n\nIn today’s society there is a need more than ever to design landscapes and play-\n\nscapes which invite, or even require, continuous navigation, and engagement of chil-\n\ndren in play activities. Arguably, the need for children to develop physical literacy may\n\nnever have been more important than at this present moment in time, and we will\n\nexplore this contention further in Chapter 2.\n\nthrough dynamic and variable performance contexts, by picking up relevant information\n\nto guide their decision-making, problem-solving and coordination of actions, highlight-\n\ning that children of hunter-gatherer societies are far more skilled at this than children\n\ngrowing up in the modern world. There are however pockets of excellent practice all\n\naround us in modern society as shown in Box 1.2.\n\nIn summary, ‘unstructured’ children’s play-based activities (Roberts, Newcombe &\n\nDavids, 2019; Button et al., 2020; Chow et al., 2020) can enrich relevant behaviours includ-\n\ning perceiving information, coordinating actions, making decisions, cooperating with\n\nothers in groups and teams, working to achieve intended actions, solving problems and emo-\n\ntionally regulating behaviours under different conditions in life. It is becoming increasingly\n\napparent that play experiences are vital for human health, well-being and development, for\n\nlearning and enriching relevant skills and for confidently self-regulating in complex envi-\n\nronments. The development of these precious skills and capacities impacts each individual’s\n\ncapability to negotiate dynamic contexts, acquire more advanced functionality through\n\nadapting their performance to the environmental demands that they face and to enjoy the\n\npsycho-social and physiological benefits of participation in sport and exercise.\n\n1.5 The Problem with Professionalisation of Children\n\nand Youth Physical Activity Opportunities\n\nBased on the issues and problems we have discussed in this chapter, there may be a tempta-\n\ntion for practitioners, parents and educators to counteract societal and environmental con-\n\nstraints that decrease meaningful play opportunities, by providing children with highly\n\n14 Keith Davids and James Rudd\n\nstructured, formalised physical activity experiences or specialised sports training pro-\n\ngrammes. This approach makes good sense when predicated on tenets of a deliberate prac-\n\ntice approach to sports training and expertise development, for it has been well publicised\n\nthat it is considered ‘essential’ to undertake an average of 10,000 hours of intense, deliber-\n\nate practice to become expert in a sport (Ericsson, Krampe & Tesch-Römer, 1993). Over\n\nthe past two decades this has resulted in increased pressure for earlier and earlier speciali-\n\nsation in order to ensure children and young people achieve this target number of hours in\n\ndeliberate practice. In many countries across the world, it has become a ‘trend’ to identify,\n\nselect and train children to participate in sport at younger and younger ages. This belief has\n\ncreated some startling efforts to drive athlete development. For example, in February 2015,\n\nthe Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a ‘football reform plan’ to lift China from 82nd\n\nplace in FIFA’s world rankings. This development programme required no less than the\n\ncountry’s babies being encouraged to grasp the opportunity to develop their talent as foot-\n\nballers (see http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31658273). The ‘Evergrande Football\n\nSchool’ is a full-time boarding primary and secondary football school with 2,800 students\n\nwho specialise in football training nearly every day. This programme, costing 2 billion\n\nyen, offers extensive facilities, including accommodation, an education building, a training\n\ncentre, a performance testing laboratory, a conference auditorium and 48 football fields.\n\nThis example of early specialisation to produce ‘talented’ footballers underlines our earlier\n\ncriticism of the treatment of children as ‘mini-adults’, with increasing professionalisation\n\nof children’s sport. In 2011, the English Premier League introduced the notion of children\n\nin professional club academies maintaining a ‘performance clock’ to record the number\n\nof hours spent in deliberate practice as part of its Elite Player Performance Plan. Some\n\nprofessional clubs in the English Premier League have created an ‘elite’ squad of under-\n\n5-year-old children for the purposes of developing the next generation of talented profes-\n\nsional footballers. However, in 2019, the UK Coaching Head of Talent and Performance,\n\nNick Levett, described the approach of some academies, to identify, select and provide\n\nsuch young children with specialised training, as ‘madness’ (http://trainingground.guru/\n\narticles/manchester-city-under-5s-elite-squad-described-as-absolute-madness).\n\n1.5.1 Why Is Early Specialisation Such a Big Problem\n\nfor Physical Literacy?\n\nA careful analysis of the research on identification and selection of children aged under\n\n5 years as ‘talented, elite athletes’, suggests that this pathway is not effective because there\n\nare challenges in identifying ‘talented’ or ‘gifted’ athletes at a very young age (Coutinho et\n\nal., 2016). Specifically, early specialisation and dedication to intense training in one sport\n\ncan lead to problems of physical and psychological health and well-being. In a recent edi-\n\ntorial analysis of problems facing children in contemporary societies in the British Journal of\n\nSports Medicine, Roetert, Ellenbecker and Kriellaars (2018) identified health and well-being\n\nissues emerging from traditional models of sports participation. They considered the main\n\nissues to be elitism and over-specialisation at an early age. Previous research by the authors\n\nof this book has drawn attention to evidence from the scientific literature on the sub-­\n\noptimality of over-emphasising a one-sided approach to sport specialisation, especially at\n\nan inappropriate time (such as at a very early age when children are psychologically, phys-\n\nically and emotionally unready for the rigours of specialised sports training) (Coutinho\n\net al., 2016; Wormhoudt & Savelsbergh, 2018). As we have already pointed out, there are\n\nNew Approach to Physical Literacy 15\n\nweaknesses of an early specialisation approach which can cause many problems and dif-\n\nficulties for children and young people on such pathways in sports training programmes\n\n(Button et al., 2020; Chow et al., 2020).\n\nThis approach is aligned with outcomes of a statistical analysis of children by Barth\n\nand colleagues (2020) who used advanced machine learning techniques to investigate the\n\nimportance of coach-led practice in an athlete’s main sport and other sports in the achieve-\n\nment of international medals. They found that before the age of 14 years, coach-led activ-\n\nity in a varied range of sports was the most important predictor of international success\n\ncompared to specialising in just one sport before the age of 14. Taken together, qualitative\n\ninformation on participant insights and the data reported in these statistical analyses pro-\n\nvide a useful rationale for enriching learner experiences in play, physical education and\n\nsports programmes. They are most useful when considered alongside powerful theoretical\n\nconcepts and principles of contemporary motor learning approaches such as Ecological\n\nDynamics. Alongside a wealth of other studies (for example captured by Coutinho et al.,\n\n2016) perhaps their main value is in raising questions over excessive involvement in spe-\n\ncialised coaching in single-sport practice programmes at an early age. This practice has\n\nbeen challenged by pedagogical frameworks such as NLP and the ASM (Chow et al., 2015;\n\nWormhoudt & Savelsbergh, 2018) which we discuss in detail in Chapters 5 and 7. Taken\n\ntogether, the evidence emphasises the need for learners to engage in an extensive range\n\nof physical activities and play, both structured and unstructured, which enhances physical\n\nliteracy of individuals over the life course.\n\nAn important message from this book is that specialised practice and training is abso-\n\nlutely necessary to succeed in high-level sports. However, the key issue is to engage in\n\nsuch intense and dedicated programmes at the right time in an individual’s development.\n\nTypically, specialised training and practice can be most useful after a prolonged period of\n\nenrichment through exposure to a diverse range of physical activities and unstructured,\n\nas well as some structured, play, games and movement experiences (Bondarchuk, 2008;\n\nWormhoudt & Savelsbergh, 2018; Button et al., 2020; Chow et al., 2020). An essential\n\nissue to consider when creating meaningful organised movement experiences concerns\n\nhow the lesson or session should be structured. A frequent criticism levelled at sport or\n\nphysical education sessions in, and outside of, the educational system is that, more often\n\nthan not, the session is delivered as a series of sport techniques, often due to the rigid and\n\ninflexible infrastructure of the sporting club or educational institution. The result of this\n\noverly structured practice approach leads to a constrained practitioner with little option\n\nbut to provide a learner with a narrow multi-skills or team sports curriculum (Kirk, 2010).\n\nFrom the learners’ perspective, the experience can be prescriptive since they receive con-\n\nstant instructions/corrective feedback for reproducing forms of movements or patterns of\n\nplay (Chen et al., 2008; Davids et al., 2012). We argue that due to its rigidity and one-size-\n\nfits-all focus, this approach fails to support physical literacy. The other issue that we often\n\ncome across in adult-led sessions is that practice environments are the same week-in week-\n\nout, and are focused upon, and emphasise, frequency-based metrics, such as the number of\n\nhours spent in practice, the number of repetitions or even the time spent in certain intensity\n\nthresholds. Programmes that are based on such metrics are implicated in high dropout rates\n\nrecorded from development programmes for talented youth athletes in high-performance\n\nsports (Côté et al., 2009; Coutinho et al., 2016). However, there are some contemporary\n\npedagogical frameworks which do suggest how the well-documented challenges and prob-\n\nlems of early specialisation can be avoided and will support physical literacy.\n\n16 Keith Davids and James Rudd\n\n1.6 Supporting and Developing Physical\n\nLiteracy: Current Understanding\n\nBased on everything we have discussed up to now, it is perhaps not surprising that today’s\n\ngeneration of children is less likely to engage as meaningfully in lifelong physical activity\n\nas earlier generations (Barnett et al., 2008; Tester, Ackland & Houghton, 2014; Bardid\n\net al., 2015). In response to this worrying picture of inactivity, the concept of physical\n\nliteracy has gained in prominence in the fields of physical activity, education, sport, rec-\n\nreation, and public health (Whitehead 2010; Dudley et al., 2017; Edwards et al., 2018).\n\nThe reasons for this renewed interest in physical literacy may be focused on health and\n\nwell-being issues, as well as the challenges of developing learners who are confident and\n\nmotivated to engage in, and maintain interest in, sports and physical activities throughout\n\ntheir life course (see box 1.3 for more information).\n\nBOX 1.3: PHYSICAL LITERACY AROUND THE WORLD\n\nPhysical literacy has been formally adopted into the aims of PE curricula across a num-\n\nber of countries (Australian Sports Commission, 2018; PSHE, 2019; Shape America,\n\n2019; Sport New Zealand, 2019; Sport Wales, 2019).\n\nIn Canada, physical literacy has been utilised as ‘the cornerstone of both participa-\n\ntion and excellence in physical activity and sport for all’ and it focuses on the physical,\n\naffective and cognitive domains. A comprehensive approach has also been adopted\n\nin Australia where physical literacy has been integrated into the physical, psychologi-\n\ncal, social and cognitive domains and has been broken down into 30 elements which\n\nare accompanied by a five-step, staged approach for implementation (Sport Australia,\n\n2019). In the United Kingdom, physical literacy has been reduced to a checklist set of\n\ncapabilities and achievements that every child should achieve (Sport England, Strategy,\n\n2016), whilst in Sweden it informs assessments in physical education.\n\n1.7 An Alternative Solution to Supporting Physical Literacy\n\nIn this book, we advocate that children’s physical activities should, in many ways, resemble\n\nplay if we are to develop meaningful movement experiences which can provide a valuable\n\nfoundation for wayfinding throughout life. This approach encourages play in nature, and\n\ncarefully designed play experiences that enrich learning opportunities. As a child moves\n\nalong their physical literacy journey, a diverse range of sport and movement experiences\n\nshould be sought out that can enrich later specialisation in a sport when athletes are psy-\n\nchologically, emotionally and physically ready for the demands of practice (Wormhoudt &\n\nSavelsbergh, 2018; Chow et al., 2020). This book explores the design process by which this\n\nmight be achieved and offers practitioners insights to enable them to create programmes\n\nwhich support the development of physical literacy in learners.\n\nIn the next section, we look at the origins of the concept of physical literacy and review\n\nhow it is aligned with the enrichment of our functional capacities and behaviours, enabling a\n\nmeaningful engagement in exercise, physical activity and sport. We introduce an Ecological\n\nDynamics rationale for physical literacy and suggest that this is beneficial to individuals\n\nNew Approach to Physical Literacy 17\n\nat all levels of performance, including novice, recreational, sub-elite and elite athletes.\n\nThese benefits are (i) maintaining health and well-being through participation in physical\n\nactivity and sport; (ii) enriching athleticism and functionality to facilitate movement coor-\n\ndination and skill adaptation and (iii) enhancing the performance of athletes who seek to\n\nspecialise at the appropriate moment in their development.\n\nReferences\n\nActive Healthy Kids (2014).
