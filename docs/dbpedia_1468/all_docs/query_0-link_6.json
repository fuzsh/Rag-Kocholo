A majority of a Senate banking subcommittee, on the basis of the record so far, favors Senate con- firmation of the appointment of Commodore James K. Vardaman as a member of the board of gov- ernors of the Federal Reserve Sys- tem, the Associated Press reported yesterday. However, five leading bankers in St. Louis have informed the subcommittee they do not believe that Vardaman is qualified by ex- perience for the position, the Post-Dispatch has learned, Also, Senator Forrest C. Donnell (Rep.), Missouri, who has been leading the criticism of the Vardaman nomination, said he may “have some additional evidence to pre- sent to the subcommittee.” Replies to Telegrams. The bankers sent telegrams in reply to inquiries which the com- mittee dispatched Wednesday to 23 persons asking if they had any information bearing upon the com- mittee’s investigation of the fit- ness of Vardeman for the position, wich is for a 14-year term at $15,000 a year, Although the mapority of the committee at present is favorable to Vardaman, it was pointed out that the hearings haVe not been closed and replies to the Sen- ators’ telegrams such as have been submitted by the St. Louis bankers may change the commit- tee’s opinion. Among the bankers who sent telegrams unfavorable to Varda- ‘man are Walter W. Smith, pres- ident of First National Bank: William CC, Connett, first vice- President of First National: Hord Hardin, vice president, Mississippi Valley Trust Co., and James P. Hickok, president, Manufacturers’ Bank & Trust Co. Another banker, president of a Jarge downtown bank, is known to have sent a similar telegram ‘to the committee. Cites 20-Year Acquaintance. An example of the telegrams sent individually by the bankers ‘ts the one in which Hardin stated: “I have known J. K. Vardaman for more than 20 years and there- fore feel I have had more than ample opportunity to judge his qualifications for membership in the Federal Reserve System. It is definitely my opinion that he is not qualified.” In their replies to the commit- tee, the bankers were careful to make mention only of their per- so’ | appraisal of Vardaman’s @-alifications based on his experi- ence. They did not*imply that they had an, knowledge of Vard- aman’s activities with the Tower Grove Bank & Trust Co., where he had personal difficulties with the directors and other officials, or of his association with the Vardaman Shoe Co., which peti- tioned for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act 15 months after Vardaman took over as pre. vent.

Contains sehold HITCHHIKING COON FOUND ON TRAILER FROM ARKANSAS Dislike for Bath Causes Ani- mal’s Capture When Ve- hicle Is Washed. Distaste for a Saturday night bath cost a raccoon its freedom last night. A truck which had hauled a large trailer from Little Rock, Ark., pulled into Crawford's Serv- ice Station, 717 Chouteau avenue, and the trailer was uncoupled to be washed. As attendants played water on the vehicle, they were startled to see the raccoon, ap- parently a hitchhiker, dart from between the wheels. The animal, closely pursued, climbed a pole, where it main- tained a precarious perch and fought off efforts to force it down for nearly an hour. The capture finally was made when Frank Ozanic, a Union Electric Co. “trouble shooter,” climbed above the raccoon and forced it down within the reach of Edward Hut- ton, Humane Society officer. Snared in a noose on the end of a long stick, the wildly clawing raccoon was removed to the Hu- mane Society shelter at 1210 Mack- lind avenue, where it will be kept until turned over to the zoo. AFT END OF BROKEN TANKER BUFFETED BY INCREASING GALE 23 Aboard Refuse to Be Taken Off By Towing Craft — Bow’s Whereabouts Unknown. KODIAK, Alaska, Feb. 23 (AP) —The aft end of the broken Rus- sian tanker Donbass with its hu- man cargo of 23 persons who re- fused to be taken off, fought in- creasing gales south of the Aleu- tians today in an attempt to ride out the storm and be towed to port, the Navy’s Alaska sea fron- tier reported. Twenty-three had been taken off and were aboard the Puente Hills, an American tanker out of Los Angeles which was towing the aft section, the Navy said. The bow end of the ship, be- lieved to carry the master and 15 officers and men, was not located definitely, but the Navy fleet ¢ug Sarsi, dispatched from Adak yes- terday, radioed it was proceeding at full speed to investigate a radar contact 50 miles distant on the chance that it might be the fore- port of the Donbass. If still adrift, officers said those 16 survivors probably have been without food six days, since the ship broke in two Feb. 17. LUXURY TAX ON BATHTUBS VOIDED BY MEXICAN COURT MEXICO CITY, Feb. 23 (AP)— The Mexican Supreme Court has ruled that bathtubs are neces- saries, not “luxuries” as the Treas- ury Department had decided, Consequently, the court has or- dered cancellation of a 3 per cent luxury tax imposed by the treas- ury on tubs, washbowls and other accessories, The treasury had classified wash facilities in a lux- ury category along with several other imported items.

PHONE WORKERS TO VOTE ON TAKING PART IN STRIKE Balloting Here and in 5- State Area Planned— Support for Walkout Believed Assured. Plans for a strike vote by 5000 telephone workers in St. Louis and 25,000 others in a five-state area were announced last night by the Southwestern Telephone Workers’ Union, Members of the union will vote on participation in a nation-wide telephone strike scheduled for March 7 by the National Federa- tion of Telephone Workers, an in- dependent organization made up of 50 autonomous unions, Union leaders consider a favorable vote a foregone conclusion and already are making plans for the walkout. Date of the secret strike vote has not been set, but ballots are being prepared, and probably will be mailed tomorrow, Everett Cot- ter, general counsel for the South- western union, reported. Negotiations to Be Resumed. Meanwhile, efforts to settle the wage-hour dispute between the union and the Southwestern Bell Telephone Co, will be resumed to- morrow morning. <A_ three-man commission appointed by the United States Conciliation Service is scheduled to meet with union and company representatives at 10 o'clock at the company offices. The union is seeking wage in- creases averaging $6.50 a week and a 40-hour work schedule. D. L. MceCowen, president of the union, had planned to confer here yesterday with the organization’s executive committee, but the meet- ing was delayed when travel dif- ficulties prevented some members from arriving in time. Assembly Decides on Strike. At a conference in Memphis last week, the general assembly of the NFTW decided on strike action to back up demands for concessions made by its member unions. The Southwestern union, repre- senting employes of the South- western Bell Telephone Co, in Missourl, Kansas, Oklahoma, Ar- kansas, Texas and the Illinois area adjacent to St. Louis, is affiliated with the NFTW. Seventeen of the 50 atttonomous unions affiliated with the NFTW are under the strike call. The 17, including Southwestern, represent 150,700 workers. One hundred thousand workers in the other 83 affiliates have been directed to observe picket lines. 70-MILE GALE IN CHANNEL Sweeps Britain; Radio Tower Collapses.

LONDON 24 (Sunday), Feb. (AP)—The Moscow radio _ said early today that remnants of Japanese troops in Manchuria had been carrying out large-scale “bandit” attacks on Soviet forces since mid-November, “with the help and leadership of reaction- ary elements in China itself.” The broadcast was the first ap- parent Russian reaction to grow- ing agitation in China for the evacuation of Russian forces from Manchuria, . Quoting Tass dispatches from Manchuria, the Moscow radio said the “reactionaries” sent their rep- resentatives to Russian-occupied territory ‘“‘to develop their ac- tivity against the Soviet Union.” “The bandit forces consist for the most part of Japanese officers and men of the former puppet army of Manchuria and many of the bandits, arreseted by Soviet authorities, declare they are mem- bers of Kuomintang (Chinese na- tionalist party), which they joined in 1945,” the broadcast said. “They also declare that their units were formed for a fight against the democratic: organiza- tions of China and that they re- ceive their orders , . . from acen- ter that was especially created for this criminal activity.” The radio said Soviet officials and troops had been killed ‘in at- tacks in Mukden, Tsitsihar and other cities and in several inci- dents since Feb. 1 in Harbin. The broadcast did not charge that the Chinese government was directly involved, but declared it “clearly supported the reactionary press blame for the murder of a Chinese engi- neer in January. “In leaflets being distributed by the bandit groups in many towns in Manchuria are contained calls for the destruction of Soviet military officials and also of Chinese co-operating with the Red Army,” the broadcast asserted. “Progressive elements in Man- churia, sincerely attempting to strengthen friendly relations be- tween China and the Soviet Union are indignant at the crimes of Chinese reactionaries acting to- gether with Japanese followers.” —_——_—~<————-— CHINESE OFFICIALS ASSAIL YALTA PACT -_----- By SPENCER MOOSA CHUNGKING, Feb. 23 (AP)— Seven high Chinese Government officials joined the swelling op- position to Russia’s position in Manchuria today by protesting to the Foreign Office against the secret Yalta agreement, Thus for the first time members of the Government identified themselves with the clamor. of the press and: students against con- tinuing Russian occupation of Manchuria and the American- British-Russian pact at Yalta, The officials coupled their pro- test with a request that the For- eign Office announce that an in- ternational decision affecting China and made without China's approval would not. be considered binding. The Chinese-Russian treaty of Aug. 14, which granted Russia special rights in Manchuria, was based on the Big Three agree- ment at Yalta, to which China was not a signatory. Seven Not Identified.

And I believe it can be done. ...I1 don’t propose to let up until the tide of produc- tion has eliminated the threat of inflation and victory is ours.” Making his first public appear- ance since he became price ad- ministrator, Porter said that this is “no time for crepe-hanging,” that ‘“‘we can control inflation.” “The record of the last two and a half years,” he said, “shows that very clearly. “Of course, from here on out, it’s going to be a tough job. But rough on any of us as what we will go through if we don’t do it.” Since he took on the OPA job, Porter said, “a lot of perfectly responsible people seem to be sug- doing that job won’t be nearly as) BRITISH FIRE ON CROW.

Porter had his answers ready. He said: Both employment and production now stand at “record peacetime peaks.” During the war, with price control, produc- tion more than doubled. In 1945, business failures “reached an all-time low” of 810. In 1946, Porter commented, with excess profits taxes repealed, it is expected that profits after taxes will be at record heights. “But there’s no point in kidding ourselves,” he _ insisted, adding that pressures against the pres- ent price line “are terrific.” “We are face to face with crit- ical dangers that destroy all we have us into a future of limited mar- kets, constricted earnings and needless poverty.” WATER SUPPLY TO BE CUT OFF IN HOUSTON, UNION CHIEF SAYS Most Other Major Utilities Also Slated for Shutdown Today in Strike. HOUSTON, Feb. 23 (AP) —D. W. Maxwell, secretary of the Houston Building and Trades Council, announced today that Houston’s water supply and most of its major utilities would be cut off at 5 p.m. tomorrow by striking unions, all AFL affiliates. City officials, however, said that despite withdrawal of workers and picketing of the plants, vital water and sewage plants would be kept in operation. Early today,, the city obtained a restraining order to keep strik- ers of the .city-county employes union and the hoisting engineers union from jpicketing the city’s water plants, sewage and gas plants and garbage truck lots. The unions recognized the injunc- tion and withdrew pickets when notified of the order. was not named in the injunction, and A. J. Bannon, business man- ager, said its members would “take over the picket lines Sun- day morning.” This, he said, would put 300 more men out on strike and bring the total to 1000.

It was the first official an- nouncement since Prime Minister W. L. Mackenzie King’s state- ment of a week ago Friday dis- closing that Canadian Government employes had turned over secret ‘information to a foreign power, /known to be Russia. In addition to the 13 held, it Is understood additional persons have t.en rounded up for ques- | tioning and released. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the | Justice Department declined to say how many have been ques- tioned, but it was reported that at least 22 were detained at the start of the investigation. Today’s announcement stressed ‘again the “serious nature of the disclosures,” said publication of further information “cannot be less than two or three weeks from now” and indicated that the full investigation would not be com- pleted for some time, ‘ The announcement was a letter written to Justice Minister Louis St. Laurent by the three counsels to the two-man royal commission conducting the inquiry. The com- missioners authorized St. Laurent to make the letter public. “A great deal of evidence is still to be placed before the com- missioners,” the letter said, “and the reasons for proceeding in camera becomé more apparent every day. “The inquiry is proceeding as ‘rapidly as possible, especially con- | sidering the difficult circum- stances under which the work is |being done (it obviously must be 'done with greatest discretion) and ‘the commissioners desire to make 'a report which will contain at ‘least some of their findings with- lin as short a time as possible ‘which, however,:-asS appears at present cannot be less than two or three weeks from now.” The probe. is being conducted “sub judice,” a legality calling for strict secrecy and. providing heavy penalty for disclosures which might prejudice the case.

Juan D, Peron and Jose P, Tamborini in a presi- dential election which also will de- termine the course of Argentina's future relations with other na- tions, 7 Two persons were wounded in a shooting in downtown Buenos Aires early this morning in the first violence since the state of siege was lifted for 48 hours, be- ginning last midnight, in order that the election might be legal. Free assembly still was limited today, under a law which requires a 24-hour “cooling-off” period be- fore an election. The polls will open at 8 a.m. to- morrow and close at 6 p.m, but the official result may not be known for a month, unless there is a landslide. The vote count will begin Monday under army-navy election supervisors, Also at stake are 158 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, two Senate seats, 14 governorships and provincial legislative posts. Tamborini, Democratic Union candidate, promised a return to constitutional government if elected. Peron, former vice president and “strong man” of the military government, said that violence which would be “remembered for centuries” would result from any attempts at election frauds. He is backed by his own Labor Party. Ballot boxes from the 16,162 polling places will be brought to Buenos Aires for the count, which wil] take 30 or 40 days. In the case of a landslide, however, the outcome may be known in two or three days, RIO CONFERENCE MAY BE AT STAKE By GRAHAM HOVEY WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (AP)— Government officials and Latin American diplomats today were agreed on at least one thing in connection with tomorrow’s na- tional election in Argentina: Defeat of Col.

Po- lice later captured a man they believed to be the other gunman. He is being held for investigation. | This will explain, to John Smith why the Veterans’ Administra- tion is slow answering his pen- sion query. There are 13,000 John Smiths on the Veterans’ Administration rosters, Gen. Omar N. Bradley, ad- ministrator, told the National Committee of the American Vet- erans of World War II today, and 8000 of them have no middle ini- tial—8000 veterans named just plain John Smith. Bradley told about the Smith problem relating difficulties of his agency and added: “We are beginning to see the light of day now.” He said the agency had been unprepared to handle peacetime veterans’ problems when he be- came administrator last year. The agency’s hospital program is being delayed because of the high cost of materials, he said. Noting that proportionately there are about three times as many unemployed veterans as civilians, Gen. Bradley said for- mer soldiers do not wish to ac- cept employment in _ factories where strikes are likely since a veteran on strike is not guaran- teed unemployment insurance. ST.

APPEAL FAILS 10 PUT END 10 INDIAN RIOTS; 300,000 STRIKE 250 Killed in 3 Days, More Than 1300 Hurt —Seamen End Mutiny and Surrender Seized Ships. By G. MILTON KELLY BOMBAY (Sunday), Feb. 24 (AP)—Two hundred persons were killed or wounded in a night of rioting and clashes between Brit- ish troops and Indian civilians. The fighting subsided only in the predawn hours today after soldiers opened fire on surging mobs in the Dadar suburban area of northern Bombay where there are many textile mills, Police said many of the night's casualties were fatalities and that “many” bodies were still in Bombay hospitals awaiting remov- al to morgues. The unofficial casualty total, not including the night's toll, for the three days of bitter street fighting was 250 dead and “well over 1300” injured. Gunfire and street rioting was confined almost entépely to north- ern sections of the city during the night. The latest outbreak came after Mohandas K. Gandhi had ap- pealed to Indians to end “this thoughtless orgy of violence,” and after the surrender Saturday morning of Indian sailors whose mutiny on Thursday had touched off disorders here and in other cities. Several hundred troops were rushed into the Dadar area Sat- urday and field pieces were mounted, Mobs set fire to a tex- tile mill, a train and a railway station. Section Held by Civilians, Crowds had seized control of a four-square-mile area in northern Bombay, where the main rioting had moved from the downtown section. Bombay hospital. estimated that 210 persons had been killed and more than 1200 injured in the three days of rioting. One un- official estimate placed Saturday casualties at 7 killed and 250 in- jured, not including two constables killed and 50 police injured. British troops and police fired on the rioting crowds more than a dozen times Saturday. Sympathy strikes, in which 300,000 workers took part, were called here and in Calcutta. A British communique said last night that additional army forces had been brought into Bombay. The curfew was extended to the Dadar area.

Gandhi, spiritual leader of mil- lions of Indians and an advocate of passive means to gain national- ist goals, issued hiS appeal at Poona. “Mutiny in the navy and what is following are not in any sense of the term non-violent,” he said. “Let it not be said that the In- dians of the Congress (party) spoke to the world of winning swaraj (home rule) through non- violent action and belied the words in action—and that, too, at a crit- ical period of her life.” Mutineers Surrender, A British communique § said last night that the ships and guns on the vessels aboard which the Indian sailors mutinied were be- ing demobilized and small arms removed “without incident.” The striking seamen remained aboard the vessels, and were be- ing issued rations, the communi- que added. Surrender was denoted by raising of a black flag, in ac- cord with orders of the naval commander, V. Adm. Sir John Godfrey. An examination of the Castle Rock barracks ashore, where barricaded sailors fought with British troops, showed one In- dian sailor had been killed and two wounded, the communique added. Previously an escapee had reported that 200 mutineers were killed. The surrender of the _ sailors both ashore and afloat, estimated at 12,000 men, took place at 9:00 a. m. Saturday. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, president of the Indian National Congress, said he had received assurance from the British com- mander in chief in India, Gen. Sir Claude Auchinleck, that there would be no mass punishment of the sailors, and that all legiti- mate grievances would be sympa- thetically considered.

With This a= T 32° Limit 1 Pound ting Relief to Help 7 Half of the families of 4200 Gen- | Meet Expenses. ‘ eral Motors strikers in St. Louis | are receiving aid from the union | and the union’s relief load is in- | creasing each week the strike con- | tinues, James Pfaffenback, finan- Clal secretary of local 25 of the 1 nited Automobile Workers, said yesterday. Help from other CIO unions | here has enabled the strikers to conserve dwindling funds for rent, fuel and other necessaries. The other unions have contributed funds and a steady supply of canned goods and groceries. The local union has received $7000 from international headquarters at Detroit. It has drawn also on a reserve composed of 5 per cent of the members’ dues. The member- ship has fluctuated in recent years, “So far, we have managed to stave off evictions,” Pfaffenback said, “and keep our people from nublic relief rolls. The load, how- ever, is petting progressively heavier each week. About 75 fam- ilies applied for aid last week as| compared with 15 two weeks ago. Pfaffenback said local 25 has not applied for assistance from the National Committee to Aid Families of General Motors Strik- | ers, which has headquarters at 212 East Forty-ninth street, New York, but that it would be wel- comed if offered. Individual St. Louisans have sent contributions | to the committee, which allocates funds on a basis of need, but | there hag been no organized local campaign. The strike is in its ninety-sixth day, | Collections of canned goods are | made regularly at plants through- out the city. The contributions, | ranging from baby food to beans, are distributed from union head- quarters, 3412 Union boulevard, after a welfare committee has ap-| proved applications for assistance. | The local union, composed of employes of the Chevrolet and Fisher Body plants, voted recent- | ‘ly not to return to work even | when the national strike is settled | until an agreement is reached on local issues. They involve shift | preferences, smoking rules and | other shop practices affecting working conditions. | AGREEMENT IN STRIKE AT CATERPILLAR TRACTOR CO. | PEORIA, Iill., Feb. 23 (AP)—A | three-man federal conciliation | panel announced today that agree- ment had been reached on all the | issues in the three-week strike of 17,500 workers at the Caterpillar | Tractor Co.
