        "text": "Working mothers make up a significant part of the labor force, accounting for nearly one-third (32%) of all employed women.\n\nThere were around 23.5 million employed women with children under the age of 18 and nearly two-thirds worked full-time, year-round, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2018 American Community Survey (ACS).\n\nIn 2018, over three-quarters of working women with children under 18 were between the ages of 30 and 49 (76%).\n\nForty-four percent of working mothers 25 or older had a bachelor’s degree or higher compared with 38% of all workers 25 or older. This is in line with other trends showing that new mothers with higher educational attainment are more likely than all new mothers to have jobs.\n\nThese age and educational differences may contribute to women with children having higher median earnings ($44,190) than women overall ($42,295).\n\nWhile women with children were more likely to be employed than the overall population, their work status and schedule differed based on the age of their children.\n\nWomen with younger children worked less than those with older children. Around 75% of women with \"school-age\" children ages 6 to 17 only (meaning they don’t have younger children) were employed compared with 62% of women with both pre-school and school-age children.\n\nWorking women with children ages 6 to 17 only were also more likely to work at least 50 weeks a year (84%) compared with women with children under 6 years old only (78%) and women with children under 6 years old and 6 to 17 years old (80%).\n\nSimilarly, women with children ages 6 to 17 only were most likely to work 35 hours or more a week (77%), compared with women with children under age 6 only (74%) and women with children in both age groups (72%).\n\nThe American Community Survey offers the advantage of a large sample and a broad scope of topics. By contrast, the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) asks more detailed questions about a person’s work situation, offering insight into motivations for working part-time.\n\nUsing Wave 4 of the 2014 SIPP, Figure 4 illustrates that both all workers and women with children usually reported working part-time for work-related reasons, such as not being able to find a full-time job or simply having a desire to work part-time.\n\nTaking care of children or other people was another common reason why mothers worked part-time. Compared to 7% of all part-time workers, 19% of women with children ages 6 to 17 only and 30% of women with at least one child under 6 reported caretaking as the reason for working part-time.\n\nIn addition to working part-time, mothers may take time off from work for pregnancy, childbirth and/or caretaking responsibilities.\n\nWhile some employers offer benefits like paid time off, others do not – some take a leave without pay. Women with at least one child under the age of 6 were slightly more likely to have an away-without-pay spell of at least 2 weeks (12%) compared with women with children ages 6 to 17 only (9%) and all workers (8%).\n\nAmong those with a spell of unpaid leave, the average number of weeks away without pay was in the eight to nine week range. This held for all workers and working moms, regardless of the age of their children.\n\nFigure 6 highlights some of the reasons why working mothers took this unpaid leave.\n\nAmong women with at least one child under age 6, pregnancy was the most common reason (45%). Among all workers and women with children ages 6 to 17 only, work-related and other personal reasons were the most common explanations for taking unpaid leave.\n\nCaretaking contributed to mothers’ decisions to work part-time or take unpaid leave but it played an even bigger role in deciding whether to work.\n\nFigure 7 shows caretaking was the most commonly reported reason for periods of joblessness among women with children.\n\nWomen with at least one child under the age of 6 were more likely to report caretaking (61%) as the reason they experienced joblessness than women with children ages 6 to 17 only (46%).\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the 10% of all respondents experiencing joblessness who reported caretaking as a reason. Instead, the most common reasons they cited were other miscellaneous reasons (63%), such as retirement or going to school."
