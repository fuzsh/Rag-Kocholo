        "text": "As a mother, it is my responsibility to provide for my children’s daily and basic needs such as food, clothing, and diapers. But right now, since the start of the war, these essentials are not available.\n\nI feel helpless.\n\nI don’t have diapers for my four-month-old baby, and I cannot wash his clothes. The food available consists mainly of canned goods; there is no fresh food that allows me to cook nutritious meals for my family. There is no electricity or cooking gas either.\n\nI am glad that I am still breastfeeding my baby, but I don’t know where we will be able to get baby food or clean water to prepare food for him when he is a little bit older.\n\nWe have no source of income now, and the prices for food and diapers in the market are skyrocketing. The market close to us is always overcrowded, and baby clothes are not available.\n\nWe left with light clothes in October and have no winter clothes to keep us warm in the wet and cold months.\n\nWe share a small house in Rafah with 25 people. We are lucky that we do not have to live in a tent or on the streets, like so many others. We lie on the floor and don’t have any space or privacy, but at least we are protected from the cold and rain.\n\nMost people around us are sick with diarrhea, are coughing, and have a cold. I could not vaccinate my baby yet, and I fear for his health and immune system, especially given how overcrowded our house is and how impossible it is to adhere to even basic hygiene standards such as washing hands without clean water and soap.\n\nDiseases and epidemics are spreading everywhere.\n\n‘I have to put on a smile. But what I really want is to cry.’\n\nI always have to present the most calm and controlled face in front of my children so that I can maintain their mental well-being. I want to prevent them from feeling fear or developing psychological issues that could affect their personalities in the post-war period. I don’t want their future to be impacted by what is happening now.\n\nI try to constantly invent new games to play with them. I talk to my three-year-old about fun topics and tell her stories. I want them to forget about the war and experience as happy a childhood as possible. My four-month-old is always laughing and cooing. He is too young to understand what is going on.\n\nI am also afraid of being injured and unable to provide for myself and my children, becoming dependent on someone else.\n\nMy life feels like a nightmare I cannot wake up from. Every morning, I thank God that we are still alive.\n\nEvery day brings news of the death of a friend or relative. Every day is filled with news of horror, destruction, and ruin, along with the sounds of shelling and rockets, and nonstop ambulance sirens. Every day we hear these sounds.\n\nWe cannot sleep due to the sounds of planes and shelling.\n\nWe fear death; we fear not waking up every time we try to sleep. Our lives are ones of pain and exhaustion. I also fear the future and what will happen after this war. We have no house to go back to.\n\nWhat will we do? Where will we go? Our future has become unknown.\n\n‘No space for personal hygiene, no safety’\n\nI want the world to know that we are humans with human feelings. We love life and hope for a better future. We do not deserve all this destruction, devastation, and death.\n\nWe have dreams, we love to work hard to achieve our goals and aspirations. We do not want to live in fear, war after war, and we do not want our homes to be destroyed. We do not want to start our lives from scratch each time, mourning our friends, relatives, and children who did not survive. We want to evolve, progress, and thrive. We want our children to grow up in conditions that support and help them achieve their goals, dreams, and aspirations.\n\nMy wish is simple. I wish to live with my family and my loved ones in peace and security. Just like you, we want to live a good life and achieve our dreams away from death and war. I hope the war ends today, to halt the otherwise inevitable horrors of tomorrow. I hope you hear my words. I hope you hear the voices of all the women and mothers in Gaza.\n\n*all names changed\n\nFarah* is a 27-year-old business administration graduate whose second child was born just before the current conflict. Her husband, a dentist, was wounded in a missile attack. She writes from Rafah where she and another 1.4 million civilians live in fear of an impending ground offensive."
