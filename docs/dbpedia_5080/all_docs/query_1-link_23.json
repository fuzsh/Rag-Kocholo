Produced by Live Nation, the newly announced 11-date Canadian run kicks off on February 18 in Victoria, BC at Save On Foods Memorial Centre, with stops in Calgary, Regina, Winnipeg and more, before the band heads West for shows in Ontario and Quebec, wrapping up a massive year of touring. Multi-Platinum singer/songwriter and producer Cavetown and indie-pop trio Cannons will join as support on all dates. The launch of these dates follows nearly sold-out shows with Cavetown at Budweiser Stage in Toronto and Rogers Arena in Vancouver this summer, when the two bands join forces for a total of 34 shows across North America.\n\nTICKETS: Tickets will be available starting with an artist presale beginning Tuesday, April 30 at 10 AM local time. Additional presales will run throughout the week ahead of the general onsale beginning Friday, May 3 at 10 AM local time at livenation.com."
