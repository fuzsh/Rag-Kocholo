        "text": "As the daughter of an immigrant mother, I can relate.\n\nI have to confess to being a little jealous of Michelle Zauner’s memoir, Crying in H Mart. Jealous because she has written such a beautiful tribute to her Mother and done so with grace and honesty. Plus, she is a successful musician and New York Times bestselling author. Talented and lucky, so unfair.\n\nMichelle, the daughter of a Korean immigrant Mother and American father, grew up in Oregon being asked, “What are you?” The book opens in H Mart and if you are not familiar, H Mart is an Asian supermarket chain. I have been in one and would describe it an amusement park for Asian food. I don’t think Michelle would disagree with that description either.\n\nKorean food qualifies as a character in the book. There is a food for every moment of life and she does an amazing job describing the techniques of preparation and sensory experience of her Mother’s food culture.\n\nLike her Mother’s cancer diagnosis does with her family, Michelle brings the reader immediately to the heart of her relationship with her Mother. It was a relationship that was fraught as she came of age and did not fit the image or intentions her Mother had for her.\n\nWhen her Mother is diagnosed with cancer, Michelle reassesses her complex feelings about her Mother and swoops in to be the dutiful perfect daughter she never was.\n\nShe is frank and heartfelt and pulls no punches on the shortcomings of her family. But she also knows how amazing her Mother is and she lets us see her. One thing that struck me as so beautiful and true is when she realizes that no one will ever love her as much as her Mother. Such a brutally honest thing to say and after reading all about her Mother, I believe her.\n\nReading this book made me think about my own relationship with my Mother, who was born in Ireland and came to Chicago when she was 18. According to my Mom, she came to Chicago, “because John Kennedy came to Ireland and said the streets of America were paved with gold.” She came for opportunity.\n\nThough my Mom spoke English and quickly lost her Irish accent, she has always maintained an outsider status. She didn’t grow up here and that made a difference.\n\nWhile my Mom and Michelle’s Mother are very different, I related to feeling like I do not understand my Mother and feeling pressure to live up to her high ideals.\n\nMichelle talks about her friends who had “Mommy Moms.” These were moms that were all love and affection and seemingly lived to worship their children. Her Mother wasn’t one and neither was mine. Our Mother’s wanted more from us and more importantly, for us."
