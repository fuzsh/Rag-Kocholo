A dialed-up collection of songs that\n\ntakes chances, swings big, goes as grandiose with the songwriting as it does granular, Grief Chapter dives lyrically\n\ndeep on Big Picture concepts like life, death, mourning, and the freedom that comes with accepting the inevitable.\n\nAnd sonically, Grief Chapter’s twelve songs are some of Mother Mother’s most muscular offerings of all time,\n\nbuoyed by legions of new fans and the bigger rooms and venues that have followed their recent years of\n\ncontinued, evolved success. “Our instinct was to make things hit hard and feel powerful,” says lead singer and\n\nMother Mother lyricist Ryan Guldemond. “We don't take this moment for granted — or this life. A life in music, doing\n\nwhat we love with whom we love.\"\n\nAbout Cavetown\n\nWith DIY ethos and a spiraling imagination, 25-year-old singer-songwriter and producer Cavetown makes songs\n\nthat excavate the deepest, unspoken parts of his heart. Since releasing his first self-produced tracks at age 14, the\n\nCambridge-based musician also known as Robin Skinner has become one of the leaders of his generation’s\n\nbedroom pop scene, amassing a global audience of fellow outsiders who connect to his lyrics of identity and\n\nbelonging. After reaching new heights with 2022’s Worm Food, he now preps his new EP, little vice, out February\n\n23 on Sire Records. A sense of childlike wonder has been a guiding force for Cavetown ever since he taught\n\nhimself how to produce and began uploading work on Bandcamp and YouTube as a young teenager. Inspired by\n\nhis love of fantasy, his songs slowly brought in a devoted online audience, leading to sold-out shows across the\n\nU.S. and U.K. behind his 2018 album Lemon Boy. Shortly after releasing the LP, he signed to Sire Records and\n\nplayed festivals around the world like Reading and Leeds, Lollapalooza, and Primavera Sound. Even with all his\n\nsuccess, Cavetown remains committed to ensuring a tight-knit connection with his listeners. In 2022, he created\n\nthe This Is Home Project, which provides funds to foundations dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth in need. Now, he\n\nremains motivated to keep sharing his honest feelings through his songs. “From what I’ve been told, something\n\nabout me and my music helps them to feel understood and that they’re not alone in who they are,” he says."
