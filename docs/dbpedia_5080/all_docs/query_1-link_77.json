        "text": "Call Me Mother 1 2\n\nThe first season of Call Me Mother is a Canadian reality television series, premiering on OutTV in 2021. Hosted by Entertainment Tonight Canada reporter Dallas Dixon, the series is a drag competition which will see up-and-coming drag performers compete in group challenges, with one queen eliminated each week until the winner of the competition is crowned the \"First Child of Drag\"[1].\n\nThe series is distinct from the RuPaul's Drag Race franchise in adding a drag mother mentoring and coaching team aspect reminiscent of The Voice, and is also fully inclusive, featuring drag queens, drag kings and transgender or non-binary performers. The drag artists will aim to get into one of three houses – Peppermint’s House of Dulcet, Crystal’s House of Glass and Barbada de Barbades’s House of Harmonie – along with the opportunity to be mentored and coached by a renowned drag performer. The houses will compete weekly as a family in a series of challenges, with the drag mother of the losing house eliminating one of her own[2].\n\nThe series is produced by Go Button Media and RedFlame TV[3].\n\nIn 2023, Kiki Coe appeared on Season 4 of Canada's Drag Race, where she placed 6th.\n\nContestants[]\n\n(Biographical information stated from during time of contest)\n\nRank Contestant Photo

Crystal and Barbada de Barbades.\n\n... to have no challenge winners.\n\nHowever, this would be supplemented with highest scoring team, which would become highest scoring drag artist(s) on Episode 6.\n\nSeason 1 of Call Me Mother is the second of any drag competition...\n\n... to have contestants compete weekly as a team, after All Stars 1.\n\nGallery[]\n\nHouses[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nNavigation[]"
