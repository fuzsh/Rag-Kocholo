Hyte, the drag mother of RuPaul's Drag Race competitor and Canada's Drag Race judge Brooke Lynn Hytes, and Québec drag queen Miss Butterfly serve as \"aunties\", who provide additional support and feedback but do not directly \"mother\" their own teams.[4] Hyte and Dixon were also the co-hosts of a weekly companion podcast which included post-elimination interviews with the competing artists.[5]\n\nMiss Butterfly did not return as an \"auntie\" for the second season, and was replaced by past Dragula winner Landon Cider.[6]\n\nCall Me Mother was created by RedFlame TV, and produced in Canada by Go Button Media and RedFlame TV.[7] It was shot in North Bay, Ontario in early 2021.[8]\n\nThe series premiered with its first season on October 25, 2021.[9] The first season was won by Toddy, a non-binary drag performer from Vancouver, British Columbia.[10] A second season, announced on December 15 and released in 2022,[11] was won by drag performer Weebee.[12]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason 1\n\n[edit]\n\nCasting occurred in the early months of 2021, with production starting in late spring 2021. The final cast was announced on October 5, 2021.[4] The inaugural season consisted of eight episodes.\n\nSeason 2\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 15, two days after the first season finale, OutTV announced the renewal of the series for a second season following the success of the first.[11] Casting for the second season opened on February 16, 2022.[13] The official cast was announced on September 22, 2022 with a premiere date of October 26.[14]\n\nMothers and other figures\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 3, 2021, it was announced that Peppermint, Crystal and Barbada would be leading the series as the mothers to the competing drag houses. Dallas Dixon was also announced as the host.[2] It was later revealed that Farra N. Hyte and Miss Butterfly would be joining the series as aunties.[4] When the official cast for season 2 was announced, it was confirmed that Peppermint, Crystal and Barbada would be returning as the mothers for the second season and that Dallas Dixon would be returning as the host.[14] On September 30, 2022, it was revealed that Farra N. Hyte would be returning as an auntie and a judge, and would be joined by Dragula season 3 winner Landon Cider taking the role of \"guncle\" and judge.[15]\n\nCall Me Mother Mothers and other figures Figure Season 1 2 Dallas Dixon Host Peppermint Mother Crystal Mother Barbada Mother Farra N.
