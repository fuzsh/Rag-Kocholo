        "text": "Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, Canada\n\nA Free Book Gifting Program\n\nDolly Parton’s Imagination Library of Canada is a free book gifting program devoted to inspiring a love of reading in young children. In partnership with local community partners, enrolled children receive monthly, a high quality, age-appropriate book in the mail, free of charge.\n\nFrom a Toronto stage in November of 2006, Dolly Parton enthusiastically announced the Canadian expansion of her Imagination Library. It was the first international push for the organization. Program coverage has spread across all Canadian provinces and territories, gifting over 3 million books in Canada in partnership with over 400 local program partners. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library has recognition for addressing social barriers to literacy.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nThe Dollywood Foundation funds and provides the infrastructure of the Imagination Library program including coordinating book selections, negotiating wholesale purchasing, mass printing, and managing a secure centralized book ordering system. The Foundation incurs the cost of the program’s administrative / overhead expenses and coordinates the fulfillment of monthly book mailing.\n\nLocal Program Partner promotes program, finds and enrolls children, secures funding and pays a small community portion per child per month. Community raised funds go 100% to serving children in their community.\n\nRegistered children received specially-selected book personalized with child’s name on label, mailed directly to their home every month until their 5th birthday, at no cost to the child’s family.\n\nChildren can register as early as birth and receive books monthly until their fifth birthday.\n\nDolly Parton’s Imagination Library is a turnkey, scalable, low cost, low risk, highly effective program promoting equitable access to early childhood educational resources. The program has direct effect on the home literacy environment with families engaged in reading, school preparedness and academic achievement.\n\nBooks and reading strengthen the home environment and support natural tendencies of family who want their children to be healthy. Established reading routines have evidence-based results linking reading to healthier mental outcomes.\n\nBring the Imagination Library to your Community!\n\nThe Imagination Library partners with local community partners who help bring the program to cities, towns, and communities around Canada.
