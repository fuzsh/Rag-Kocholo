        "text": "The share of parents in the United States who are not employed for pay has been fairly stable over the last five years. In 2021, 18% of parents didn’t work for pay, which was unchanged from 2016, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. The share who are stay-at-home parents differs between men and women: 26% of mothers and 7% of fathers.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the share of stay-at-home parents has fluctuated, rising during periods of higher unemployment.\n\nHow stay-at-home dads and moms compare\n\nBetween 1989 and 2021, the share of mothers who were not employed for pay decreased slightly, from 28% to 26%. Over the same span, the share of fathers who were not working increased from 4% to 7%.\n\nDue to these diverging trends, dads now represent 18% of stay-at-home parents, up from 11% in 1989.\n\nThe reasons mothers and fathers give for not working for pay differ significantly. In 2021, the vast majority of stay-at-home moms (79%) said they took care of the home or family. About one-in-ten (9%) said they were at home because they were ill or disabled, and smaller shares said they didn’t work because they were students, unable to find work or retired.\n\nStay-at-home dads cite more varied reasons for not working for pay. In 2021, 23% stayed home to care for the home or family. That is up from only 4% in 1989 but still well below the share of stay-at-home moms who said the same.\n\nAbout one-third of stay-at-home dads (34%) were not working due to illness or disability, down from 56% in 1989. Some 13% were retired, 13% said they could not find work and 8% were going to school.\n\nHow stay-at-home dads are different from dads who work\n\nStay-at-home dads differ demographically from dads who work for pay.\n\nEducation: Stay-at-home dads are less likely than dads working for pay to have completed at least a bachelor’s degree. Some 22% of stay-at-home dads have this level of education, compared with 42% of dads who work for pay.\n\nPoverty: The families of stay-at-home dads tend to be less economically well-off than the families of dads who work for pay. Some 40% of stay-at-home dads live in poverty, compared with 5% of dads who work for pay.\n\nAge: Stay-at-home dads tend to be older than dads working for pay. Some 46% of stay-at-home dads are age 45 or older, compared with 35% of dads working for pay.\n\nRace and ethnicity: Stay-at-home dads are a more racially and ethnically diverse group than working dads. Half of dads who don’t work for pay are non-Hispanic White. This compares with 60% of dads working for pay. Non-Hispanic Black fathers are a larger share of stay-at-home dads (18%) than they are of working dads (9%). Hispanic fathers are 21% of both stay-at-home and working fathers, and non-Hispanic Asian fathers are 7% of stay-at-home fathers and 8% of working fathers.\n\nMarriage: Some 68% of stay-at-home dads are married, as are 85% of dads who work for pay.\n\nIn addition, stay-at-home dads who are taking care of the home or family differ in some ways from those who stay home for other reasons.\n\nEducation: 27% of dads who stay home to care for family have a four-year college degree, while 21% of dads who stay home for other reasons do.\n\nAge: A third of dads staying home to take care of family are age 45 or older, compared with half of those who are home for other reasons.\n\nMarriage: 73%of dads who stay home to care for family are married, as are 66% of dads who are home for other reasons.\n\nNote: This is an update of a post originally published Sept. 24, 2018, written by former Senior Researcher Gretchen Livingston."
