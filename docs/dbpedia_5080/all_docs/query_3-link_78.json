        "text": "I am in a similar situation. My mother their lives in a AL place that is considered \"age in place\" that is for dementia patients. It has been almost 3 years now and mom is now facing the what looks to be the end of her time. I have read and reread her advanced health directives that she had formally written 15 years ago I do believe that we are following her wishes. Moms health is greatly failing, side effects of new medication are horrible and the dr wants to change to a different medication which side effects are far worse. For me, I took a step back and considered quality of life for her not me. Knowing who she used to be, I know that she would silently suffer if I allow the Drs to give the new medication. I am trying my best to be sure that I will have know regrets as to how she was cared for in the AL and on this forum is where I get the best advice from those who have experienced what I am going through. The advice that people have given in regards to your question certainly looks like people are telling you not to move your mother home with you.\n\n02/23/2016 08:07:01\n\nIf she can afford to stay where she is, DEFinitely leave her there. You will not be able to care for her as well as 3 shifts and you can spend as much time with her as you want. You can even pick her up and bring her to your house for visits instead of hanging out in the AL place. I have been taking care of my mother and have kept her mobile by exercise and treadmill. After a fall, it took her a long time to come back and I had to get up w her at night for toileting. It was HORRENDOUS. It didn't last too long or I would have slashed my wrists! Not really. But we don't spend any quality time at all because she resents my telling her what to do and is passive aggressive. And I resent her for not cooperating and making my life more difficult. I'm too upset and angry a lot of the time to even want to have a conversation with her. Older people who are losing mobility and mental capacity are not really happy people to be around. I say, just visit when you want and have a good time and leave to go home to your own life. I have NONE, and I wish it were different, but I'm kinda stuck. You won't really be improving her life and will be ruining your own.\n\n02/23/2016 00:48:17\n\nJudyAnn, I can tell you about our experience with my mom. She lived with me for 9 yrs during which time she could do most everything for herself. She then moved in with my sister. After a couple of falls and rehab she could no longer be unattended. We set up care for daytime, myself and niece but the nights fell on my sister. My mom would get up every two hours to go potty. It took only a short time before my sister could no longer handle this. She is 60 and works full time. The night time breaks in sleep took a hugh toll on her, even thought her husband would help out. Just knowing that at any moment you are going to be called for is enough to provoke anxiety and making it even harder to get to sleep. The constant wake sleep cycle finally made us decide it was best for mom to move into an Adult Family Home. Its a home with 6 residents and a wonderful family who give remarkable care. She is 10 minutes away for both of us and she loves it. She herself knew it was to much for my sister and is glad we made the move. Caring for someone in your home is very very hard. 24/7 is just that 24/7 so I suggest you give it a lot of thought and read what others are saying on this forum. I know you love your mom, but caring for her yourself may not be the best for all involved. Whatever choice you make I do wish you all the best. You have a kind heart. Hugs. ðŸ˜ƒ\n\n02/17/2016 08:48:07\n\nI also should have mentioned I sleep next door to her and use baby monitors. With the baby monitor in her room I am able to hear her chair if she uses it to stand up to try to go to the bathroom (It's a lift chair so quite noisy thank goodness) and I can hear her grunting when she tries to get out of the chair forgetting to use her remote. I can hear her call for help at times she remembers through the baby monitor and then I can just open my eyes for a second if I hear noise and look to see she's still sleeping or is instead moving around needing a bathroom break. Baby monitors are the best invention in the world in my opinion. I have them on her in every place she sits so I can move around a bit while she's resting and still have eyes on her.\n\n02/05/2016 00:15:38\n\nI care for my grandma who wears depends. Sometimes she calls out to me in the middle of the night but sometimes she forgets and tries to get up so I have to listen for her. I'm a light sleeper and I was exhausted at first. I would have trouble like you are, going back to sleep and would be living off 2 hours a night if I was lucky. My body adjusted and now I can fall back to sleep almost immediately after getting up with her and I also take advantage of her nap time in the afternoon. Where she takes a two hour nap, I sneak in 45 minutes or so just so that I have time to my things and rest a bit. I have found that it helps a ton even if it's a no sleep kind of night to be able to rest an hour. I have a caregiver as well who helps me during the day so I am able to work a few hours two days a week. I could technically work all 5 days but honestly I needed the time for me to go do errands and I\"m in the process of moving and wanted the time to pack up a huge house now that my mother has passed away and its now my responsibility. My grandma is up 2 or 3 times a night going to the bathroom (basically she goes to bed around 9:30, is up around 12, 3 and 6 which is for the day) on her good nights. Other nights it can get bad and if she has a UTI watch out as it means no sleep for me for a few nights until the medicine kicks in. It's not easy but I manage alone. As I said my body adjusted and I'm sure yours will too just don't be afraid to rest for a bit while she is resting so that you keep your strength up.\n\n02/05/2016 00:12:22\n\nJudyAnn are you visiting your mother a lot where she is, now? You see how many activities the facility offers. How are you going to provide stimulation and peer contact and interesting activities in your house? There are certainly ways it can be done. They all involve effort from you and cooperation on her part.\n\nBeing involved with her in some of the activities where she is now could be quality time. My mom lived with my newly-retired sister for about a year before her mobility problems and dementia became too much for at-home care. It is very important for Mom to have her hair looking nice. Toward to end of her stay my sister could not even talk her into going to the hair dresser. Now the hair dresser at the nh comes for her weekly, wheels her to the shop, and then wheels her to lunch or where ever she needs to be next. There is live entertainment at least once a week, and she doesn't even have to struggle into a jacket! I try to go when they have certain crafts scheduled that I know are helper-intensive. One sister always meets the nh van at Walmart when they go and takes Mom around. Another sister went with the nh group to the local 4th of July parade. Another sister (there are 4 of us!) and I took Mom and her friend to an outdoor apple festive the nh put on. (Volunteers are available for those who have no family member to help.) In other words, Mom has gone from watching television all day and dreading any trips at all to participating in lots of activities. Instead of sitting alone a lot, we come in to find her having coffee and talking to other residents.\n\nAre you sure that taking away your mother's current social life, moving away from people she has been used to for three years, and reducing the number of activities available to her will be an improvement to her quality of life?\n\nWhat if after a good night's rest you visited her after breakfast and did activities with her, if there is something scheduled she particularly likes, or sat and chatted with her and other residents she likes, or wheeled her around the ground (or helped her if she uses a walker) and commented on the changing seasons or the odd picture in the hallway? Admired the decorations on the residents' doors? Took her out to pick out a new decoration for her door? (If she is able to ride in a car OK). The next day go for a few hours after lunch and play cards with her. One evening bring in photo albums of your time abroad and tell her about your life there.\n\nI really can understand that you want to have quality time with your mother. I am not at all sure that requires you to do the hands-on caregiving.\n\nWhy not give visiting her where she is a chance for a couple of months, before you decide you have to move her to achieve your goal?\n\n02/04/2016 02:21:19\n\nTelling a continent adult to go ahead and pee in her disposable underwear is a problematic concept. If the person is at all lucid, even a little, that is not an acceptable idea. They tried it on me once when I was in ICU and they finally had to bring in a bedside commode and get me up. Even when Mother had a catheter it was very very difficult to explain to her that she didn't need to get up when she felt the urge to pee. Now she wears disposables at all times but telling someone who was potty trained 93 years ago that she should pee in her pants just doesn't cut it. If the aides don't come right away to toilet her I say, \"don't worry if you leak a little, Ma, you have a pad on to catch it.\" and that calms her down.\n\nMaybe you can convince someone to just go ahead and pee in her diaper at night and not to get out of bed -- maybe. But I'd bet against it.\n\n02/03/2016 21:28:30"
