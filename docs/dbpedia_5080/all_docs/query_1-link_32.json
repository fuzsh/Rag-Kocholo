Released this week on Grammy award-winning local label Cellar Music, the record is concept song cycle of 11 new tunes that can be performed as a concert or accompany a performance piece based around the singer and others’ journey into motherhood.\n\nProduced by Canadian jazz composer Elizabeth Shepherd, Oh Mother shines light on the ups and downs of becoming a mother.\n\nThe single So In Love is both an acknowledgment of the wonder of watching a child experience the world, as well as the challenges that come with child rearing. It’s a 360-degree shift from her previous single that was a unique cover of the Weezer hit Say It Ain’t So.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nSuperstein talked about the new record before an upcoming performance on Feb. 17 at 3:30 p.m. at the 2024 Jazz at the Bolt festival.\n\nQ: Your new album looks at what it is to be a parent from a lot of perspectives and Elizabeth Shepherd has really captured that vibe on the sessions. How did you two come to work together?\n\nA: About seven years ago, I was getting ready to go on tour and leave my 10-month-old baby behind, which is very hard. So I actually reached out to Elizabeth on social media for some words of encouragement. We’d never met, but I knew her as someone working in the same genre who toured and maintained a career with kids. We developed a close friendship from that and she became a real kindred spirit who has now done two of my albums.\n\nQ: You’ve been rolling out the Oh Mother tracks with your usual tasty videos. Where does this theatrical flair come from?\n\nA: Now that I have a few albums under my belt, I’ve learned how to bring the images I have for my songs in my mind to cinematic life working with talented film folks. What starts as a seed in my brain can so often become something bigger and I love it. As for where that flair comes from, it’s that whole ‘you have a kid who can sing so put them into musical theatre’ background.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQ: Is this what lead you to producing the multimedia show around this album?\n\nA: I really love this project and I wanted to give it a life that was longer than the usual release of tour it, move on to the next one situation. So I had the idea of filming interviews with the various mothers I talked to whose stories, along with my own, formed the inspiration for the songs. These can be played in between sections of the live quartet concert, but I also wrote it into a solo show that I brought to the Nanaimo and Victoria fringe festivals last summer. It’s a one-hour play with the visuals and songs, as well as me adding in expanded monologue.\n\nQ: This is something you can walk away from and come back to over time isn’t it?\n\nA: I think that we are such visual consumers these days that showing the actual faces of all of the mom’s whose stories formed so much of the inspiration for the new music is a multi-sensory way to present what is the experience of being a mother. It’s a way to connect around an experience that often leaves many of us feeling disconnected. And it is also a real homecoming to return to theatre roots I never thought I’d come back to.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQ: Will you tour both versions of the Oh Mother experience?\n\nA: I am going out on the road in March across Canada with the band version, but expect to be doing the solo show around B.C. later as well.\n\nsderdeyn@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nReview: Giggling, winking Taylor Swift serves up red-hot entertainment (with video)\n\nA double shot of Coldplay\n\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don’t miss the news you need to know — add VancouverSun.com and TheProvince.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.\n\nYou can also support our journalism by becoming a digital subscriber: For just $14 a month, you can get unlimited access to The Vancouver Sun, The Province, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites.
