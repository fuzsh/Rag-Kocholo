Uncertainty about celebrating has increased slightly to 8% from 6%. While 66.5% intend to buy gifts, down marginally from 67.1%, those celebrating are largely looking to match or exceed their previous spending. Influence on purchases comes chiefly from family and friends (32.5%) and in-store browsing (23.7%). Other significant factors include in-store displays, flyers, social media, and retailer websites. Dedicated shopping trips for Mother's Day are up to 60%, and shoppers are clearly looking for value in gift-giving."
