My mother couldn't be more pleased with the variety, taste, and freshness of the food. I couldn't be any more pleased with the customer service provided when I call to make changes and/or updates to meals or delivery. Everyone has been so courteous and efficient. Mom's Meals continues to be #1 in our book!\n\nCaregiver\n\nClient Stories\n\nHave purchased out-of-pocket since my health plan benefit of meals after surgery was so helpful; recently purchased 2 batches of 14 meals each for my 93-year old mother-in-law in another city after her hospital stay and she has been thrilled at independence they allow her!\n\nPost-Discharge & Self-Pay Customer\n\nClient Stories\n\nI just wanted to tell you how easy it is to make your tasty meals for dinner each night. Three days a week, I come home from dialysis tired and hungry. In less than five minutes from fridge to plate, I have a great tasting meal ready to eat. My husband has diabetic diet needs and I have renal diet needs, so we order our meals and put them in the fridge separately. Momâ€™s Meals makes mealtime a lot easier in our household.\n\nClient with Kidney Disease\n\nClient Stories\n\nI just received my first shipment today and I'm very happy. I have cancer and I get so tired. Cooking can be hard (even though I love to cook). It's been so difficult getting the proper nutrition. I have nausea and vomiting frequently, and often the only nutrients I get are from shakes or tomato juice because I don't have the strength or appetite for anything else. These meals are the perfect size, easy to make, and really take the pressure off of me to shop and cook every day. Thank you for making my life easier.\n\nClient Needing Cancer Support\n\nClient Stories\n\nI love this option for my consumers. Others cannot meet most dietary restrictions and have no choice. Choice gives consumers a sense of control that is tremendously important. Some tell me they look forward to choosing as if they were ordering take out. Thank you!\n\nHappy Case Manager\n\nClient Stories\n\nI received the meals yesterday as a sample. I have to tell you that I am impressed with the quality and taste. We would definitely recommend Mom's Meals to our customers and other agencies.\n\nImpressed Case Manager\n\nClient Stories\n\nI want to thank you for the delicious meals. They are very good, and I really appreciate your services. I am 82 years old and your meals have made it much easier to enjoy three meals each day in my home. Thank you for all you do and the great job.\n\nThankful Client"
