        "text": "People who were exposed to DES in utero may have other health issues or characteristics, including:\n\nAutoimmune conditions. Concerns have been raised that individuals exposed to DES in utero may have problems with their immune system. However, research thus far suggests that DES daughters do not have an increased risk of autoimmune diseases. Researchers found no difference in the rates of lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, optic neuritis, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura between women who were and were not exposed to DES in utero (16).\n\nCardiovascular disease. Individuals exposed to DES have an increased risk of high cholesterol, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart attack but not of stroke (17, 18). The associations between prenatal DES exposure and coronary artery disease and heart attack appear to be stronger in DES daughters than DES sons (17).\n\nPancreatic disorders. One study found a higher risk of pancreatic disorders and pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) in both DES daughters and DES sons compared with unexposed females and males (11).\n\nEarly menopause. DES daughters have more than twice the risk of early menopause (menopause that begins before age 45) as unexposed women. Scientists estimate that 3% of DES-exposed women have experienced early menopause due to their exposure (10).\n\nDepression. One study found a 40% higher risk of depression in DES daughters than in unexposed women (19), but other studies have not found increased risks (20, 21). Prenatal exposure of men to DES was not associated with the risk of depression (21).\n\nPsychosexual characteristics. Findings from animal studies have raised the possibility that prenatal exposure to DES may influence certain psychological and sexual characteristics of adult men and women. However, a 2003 study found little evidence that such exposure is associated with the likelihood of ever having been married, age at first sexual intercourse, number of sexual partners, or having had a same-sex sexual partner in adulthood (20).\n\nA study published in 2020 found that DES daughters were about 40% less likely to identify as gay/lesbian or bisexual compared with unexposed women (22). There were indications that DES-exposed men were more likely to be gay or bisexual, but these associations were not statistically significant (22). The number of transgender participants was too small to assess associations with DES exposure.\n\nResearchers are also studying possible health effects among the children of DES daughters. These groups are called DES granddaughters and DES grandsons, or the third generation. Researchers are studying these groups because studies in animal models suggest that DES may cause DNA changes (i.e., altered patterns of methylation) in mice exposed to the chemical during early development (23). These changes can be heritable and have the potential to affect subsequent generations.\n\nA comparison of the results of DES granddaughters’ pelvic exams with those of their mothers’ first pelvic exams found none of the changes that had been associated with prenatal DES exposure in their mothers (14). However, another analysis showed that DES granddaughters began their menstrual periods later and were more likely to have menstrual irregularities than unexposed women of the same age (that is, women whose mothers were not exposed to DES before birth) (24). The data also suggested that infertility was greater among DES granddaughters than among unexposed women of the same age (25) and that they may have an increased risk of preterm delivery (24). However, this association is based on small numbers of events and was not statistically significant. Researchers will continue to follow these individuals to study the risk of infertility.\n\nRecent studies have found that DES granddaughters and DES grandsons may have a slightly higher risk of cancer (26) and birth defects (27), including hypospadias in DES grandsons (28). However, because each of these associations is based on small numbers of events, researchers will continue to study these groups to clarify the findings.\n\nIt is estimated that 5 to 10 million Americans—pregnant women and the children born to them—were exposed to DES between 1940 and 1971 (5). DES was given widely to pregnant women between 1940 and 1971 to prevent complications during pregnancy. DES was provided under many different product names and also in various forms, such as pills, creams, and vaginal suppositories (31). The table below includes examples of products that contained DES.\n\nDES Product Names Nonsteroidal estrogens Benzestrol\n\nChlorotrianisene\n\nComestrol\n\nCyren A.\n\nCyren B.\n\nDelvinal\n\nDES\n\nDesplex\n\nDibestil\n\nDiestryl\n\nDienostrol\n\nDienoestrol\n\nDiethylsteilbestrol dipalmitate\n\nDiethylstilbestrol diphosphate\n\nDiethylstilbestrol dipropionate\n\nDiethylstilbenediol\n\nDigestil\n\nDinestrol\n\nDomestrol\n\nEstilben\n\nEstrobene\n\nEstrobene DP\n\nEstrosyn\n\nFonatol Gynben\n\nGyneben\n\nHexestrol\n\nHexoestrol\n\nHi-Bestrol\n\nMenocrin\n\nMeprane\n\nMestilbol\n\nMicroest\n\nMethallenestril\n\nMikarol\n\nMikarol forti\n\nMilestrol\n\nMonomestrol\n\nNeo-Oestranol I\n\nNeo-Oestranol II\n\nNulabort\n\nOestrogenine\n\nOestromenin\n\nOestromon\n\nOrestol\n\nPabestrol D\n\nPalestrol\n\nRestrol Stil-Rol\n\nStilbal\n\nStilbestrol\n\nStilbestronate\n\nStilbetin\n\nStilbinol\n\nStilboestroform\n\nSilboestrol\n\nStilboestrol DP\n\nStilestrate\n\nStilpalmitate\n\nStilphostrol\n\nStilronate\n\nStilrone\n\nStils\n\nSynestrin\n\nSynestrol\n\nSynthosestrin\n\nTace\n\nVallestril\n\nWillestrol Nonsteroidal estrogen–androgen combinations Amperone\n\nDi-Erone\n\nEstan\n\nMetystil Teserene\n\nTylandril\n\nTylostereone Nonsteroidal estrogen–progesterone combinations Progravidium Vaginal cream suppositories with nonsteroidal estrogens AVC cream with dienestrol\n\nDienestrol cream\n\nWomen who think they used DES during pregnancy, or people who think that their mother used DES during pregnancy, can try contacting the health care provider or institution where they received their care to request a review of their medical records. If any medications were taken during pregnancy, obstetrical records could be checked to determine the name of the drug.\n\nHowever, finding medical records many decades later can be difficult. If the health care provider has retired or died, another provider may have taken over the practice as well as the records. The county medical society or health department may know where the records have been stored. Some pharmacies keep records for a long time and can be contacted regarding prescription dispensing information. Military medical records are kept for 25 years. In most cases, however, it may be impossible to confirm whether DES was used. Although records may not be available, some anatomic features that may be visible during a pelvic exam can lead a health care provider to suspect DES exposure.\n\nWomen who know or believe they were exposed to DES before birth should be aware of the health effects of DES and inform their health care provider about their possible exposure.\n\nSeveral major organizations publish guidelines about routine medical examinations and screening for women, but none of them address the needs of DES daughters specifically. These individuals have generally been advised to have an annual medical examination to check for adverse health effects of DES, including abnormal cervical cells and clear cell adenocarcinoma. In the past, that medical examination may have included a pelvic examination (in which the health care provider checks the vulva, vagina, cervix, ovaries, uterus, and rectum for any abnormalities) with a Pap test that collected cells from the cervix and the vagina; colposcopy (examination of the cervix with magnification) has been recommended to follow up on any abnormal findings.\n\nHowever, now that the population of DES daughters has become older (the youngest having been born in 1972), the relative benefits and harms of this approach compared with what is recommended for DES-unexposed individuals is unclear. For example, no guidelines address the age at which screening exams can end for these individuals.\n\nIt is generally recommended that DES daughters follow the routine breast cancer screening recommendations for their age group."
