        "text": "Standard vs. Extended Parental Benefits in Canada Benefit Maximum Weeks Benefit Rate Weekly Maximum Standard Up to 40 weeks, but one parent cannot receive more than 35 weeks of standard benefits 55% Up to $650 Extended Up to 69 weeks, but one parent cannot receive more than 61 weeks of extended benefits 33% Up to $390\n\nSo, for example, a new mother could take the full 15 weeks of maternity benefits she's allowed. She could also take an additional 35 weeks of standard parental benefits. If she were to choose extended parental benefits instead, she'd be able to take 61 weeks in addition to her 15 weeks of maternity benefits. Altogether, she'd qualify for 76 weeks of leave.\n\nMaternity and Parental Leave in the United States\n\nIn the United States, the picture for families-to-be is very different. The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) signed into law in 1993 requires employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for several medical conditions, as well as the birth of a baby.\n\nTo be eligible for unpaid maternity or parental leave, you must:\n\nHave worked for an employer for at least 12 months\n\nHave worked at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months\n\nWork at a location where the company employs 50 or more employees within 75 miles\n\nIf the parent has pre-birth complications, she may be able to take part of the leave under the medical component. Before the law was enacted, the U.S. had no laws requiring that employers provide any leave. There are still gaping holes in the FMLA, however.\n\nFor example, the act exempts small employers defined as those having fewer than 50 employees from having to offer unpaid leave. Though it's worth noting that a few states, including California and New Jersey, include pregnancy benefits as part of the state's disability insurance plan, which provides at least a partial offset of lost income.\n\nCalifornia, for instance, offers up to four weeks of paid leave for normal pregnancies and up to eight weeks for mothers who undergo a cesarean section. Though that's helpful, it still falls far short of the benefits afforded to Canadian parents.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThough the FMLA in the U.S. allows at least a brief window for mothers to recuperate and care for a child after birth or adoption, there is no federal or state law mandating pregnancy benefits.\n\nThe downside of the lack of pregnancy leave and benefits in the United States is significant. Not only does a mother need time to physically recover after giving birth, but families also need time to adjust to new routines and sleep patterns. If a mother has to rush back to work after giving birth because she cannot afford the lack of a paycheck, she may not be as effective at her job compared to if she was rested and had her family life settled.\n\nBecause the Canadian government provides benefits and leave for employees, new mothers and fathers can take paid leave and be confident that they will have jobs waiting for them at the end of the leave period. When it comes to pregnancy benefits, Canada is a much more generous country."
