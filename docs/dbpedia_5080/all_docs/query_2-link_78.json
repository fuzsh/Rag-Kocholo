        "text": "Parental authority refers to parents’ rights and responsibilities toward their children from the minute they are born until they turn 18. Under their parental authority, parents make decisions that affect their children’s well-being.\n\nWhat is parental authority, and what happens if the parents break up?\n\nParental Authority: Rights and Responsibilities\n\nUnder parental authority, parents have these rights and responsibilities toward their children:\n\ncustody\n\nsupervision\n\nphysical and psychological protection\n\nhealth and safety\n\neducation\n\nproviding food\n\ncaring for them\n\nParental authority gives parents the right to make all decisions necessary to their children’s well-being. For example, parents can make these decisions:\n\nwhere the children will live\n\nagree to or refuse health care (there are limits to this right for children 14 or older)\n\npass on their religious beliefs\n\nParents can also temporarily give to someone else certain parts of their parental authority, such as custody, supervision or education. For example, this happens when a babysitter looks after the children.\n\nWho makes decisions about the children after the parents break up?\n\nWhile they are living together, parents use their parental authority together, whether or not they are married.\n\nIf the parents don’t live together anymore and only one of them has custody of the children, the other parent still keeps parental authority.\n\nThe parent who does not have custody only loses the right to custody. The parent who has custody decides where the children will live.\n\nThe parent who does not have custody still has all the other rights and responsibilities of parental authority (e.g., education, providing food, decisions about health care).\n\nBeing with the children means the parent who has custody exercises parental authority every day, while the other parent does this from a distance. But the parent who does not have custody must be consulted on all major decisions concerning the children.\n\nWhat is a major decision? Here are a few examples:\n\nchoice of school\n\nhealth care necessary for a child’s state of health\n\nsome medical treatments, such as braces\n\nlong-term activities and hobbies\n\nA general rule, the parent who does not have custody of the children also has these rights:\n\nsee report cards\n\ngo to parent-teacher meetings\n\nreceive information about the children’s medical care\n\nWhen Parents Don’t Agree on Decisions About the Children\n\nIf parents don’t agree on a major decision concerning the children, then one parent can go to court to have a judge decide, no matter who has custody.\n\nHere a few situations where a parent can ask for a judge’s opinion:\n\nThe parents don’t agree on a decision they have to take regarding the children.\n\nOne parent is making all the decisions about the children without consulting the other parent.\n\nOne parent refuses to give the other parent important information about the children.\n\nThe judge will make a decision based on the children’s best interests.\n\nNew Partners of Parents and Decisions Concerning Children\n\nNew partners of a parent, such as boyfriends or girlfriends, do not have parental authority, even if they are acting like a parent.\n\nLosing Parental Authority\n\nIn rare cases, a parent can lose all or part of parental authority and the right to make decisions concerning the children.\n\nOnly a judge can take away parental authority."
