        "text": "The Mother Up pilot is a privately-funded guaranteed income pilot in Washington DC, convened and sponsored by Mother’s Outreach Network. Recruitment for the pilot’s first cohort started in December of 2022 and has concluded with the launch of the first group of participants in May of 2023. Cash assistance, with no strings attached, will be provided to these mothers for three years. Phases 2 and 3 will ensue in early 2024.\n\nThe Mother Up program will undergo independent evaluation, featuring mixed methods including randomized control trials (“RCTs”) and in-depth qualitative research to explore how additional income affects mothers’ family stability, parental commitment, and other indicators of socioeconomic wellbeing.\n\nWe are excited to announce that we have opened the recruitment process for Phase 2 of the Mother Up Guaranteed Income Research Program. Through this program, a group of Black mothers with children age 14 or younger who have current or recent involvement with the DC Child & Family Services Agency will receive a stipend for up to one year.\n\nIf you think you or someone you know is eligible for this program, please have them fill out the eligibility screener, which you will receive by emailing us at pilot@mothersoutreachnetwork. org.\n\nPlease note that those who are deemed eligible for this program will be required to provide documentation verifying that they meet the eligibility requirements before being enrolled in the program. Mother’s Outreach Network can work with individuals to obtain this documentation if they do not have it. For questions, please reach out to pilot@mothersoutreachnetwork. org!\n\nDownload Recruitment Flyer"
