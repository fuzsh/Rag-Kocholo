However, not all countries do allow this. Some countries may even consider it illegal for you to have another citizenship.\n\nExamples of ways you might have another citizenship(s):\n\nyou were born in another country\n\nyou have a parent(s) who was born in, or is a citizen of, another country\n\nyou officially apply for citizenship of another country\n\nNote: You may not even be aware that you have citizenship in another country. For example, even if you’re born in Canada, if you have at least 1 parent who is a citizen of another country, that country may see you as a citizen as well and may not recognize your Canadian citizenship.\n\nHaving dual citizenship can also impact other aspects of your personal situation. For instance:\n\nChild abduction and parenting or custody issues\n\nMarriage outside Canada\n\nBefore you go\n\nBefore leaving Canada to travel to another country where you also hold citizenship:\n\nmake sure to understand and meet the requirements of dual citizenship for that country\n\ncontact that country’s embassy or consulate in Canadafor information on the laws and regulations relating to dual citizenship\n\nconsult Travel Advice and Advisories for country-specific information, including about dual citizenship\n\nIt’s important that you find out if you have other citizenships if you’re planning to travel outside of Canada. You may be required to follow certain regulations or face restrictions if you hold citizenship there.\n\nWhile you’re away\n\nIf you hold citizenship in another country, different entry and exit rules may apply to you, even if your Canadian citizenship is recognized there. These requirements may not necessarily apply to other Canadian travellers without dual citizenship.\n\nSome examples of laws and regulations you may encounter when travelling to or living in a country where you hold citizenship:\n\nYou may need a passport issued by the country to enter, and in some cases exit, that country.\n\nYou may need an exit visa on your passport to leave the country.\n\nYou may need to register your Canadian citizenship upon entry or while you’re there.\n\nAn exit ban could prevent you from leaving the country.\n\nThis ban could be due to investigations into you, your family or your employer. It could also be in relation to criminal and civil matters, including business disputes.\n\nsome countries have laws requiring parental permission to exit, depending on your age, gender or marital status.\n\nYour nationality may have an impact on whether these rules might apply to you.\n\nYou can be forced to register for military service. This could be imposed immediately upon arrival or when attempting to exit the country.\n\nYou may be required to pay taxes, as any other citizen of that country.\n\nYou may need to register your child with the country, even if the child was born in Canada.\n\nConsider the possible laws and regulations when travelling to other countries where you do not hold citizenship. For example:\n\nIf your Canadian passport shows you were born outside Canada, some countries may have specific entry requirements. In some cases, you may not be able to enter the country.\n\nIf your Canadian citizenship is not recognized\n\nLimited or no access to Canadian consular services\n\nBased on the country's laws, local authorities could be within their right to prevent Canadian consular officials from assisting you in a consular emergency. Local authorities may refuse your request to access Canadian consular services.\n\nRenouncing your citizenship\n\nYou may be forced to give up your Canadian citizenship or be required to renounce your other citizenship.\n\nLearn more about giving up your Canadian citizenship.\n\nIf you need help\n\nFor help with emergencies outside Canada, contact the:\n\nnearest Canadian office abroad\n\nEmergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa\n\nReturning to Canada\n\nIf you are a Canadian with dual citizenship, you need to carry a valid Canadian passport to return to Canada by air.\n\nThis applies even if:\n\nthe country or countries you’re travelling from require you to carry your other passport\n\nyou’re only passing through\n\nMore information about why you need a valid Canadian passport.\n\nRelated links"
