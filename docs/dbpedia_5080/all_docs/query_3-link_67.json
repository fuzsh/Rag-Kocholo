        "text": "About Our Mother Baby Program\n\nOur Mother Baby Program will address the variety of changes that motherhood can bring by providing a supportive and non-judgmental atmosphere where mothers will learn strategies for coping with postpartum depression and anxiety, develop skills to help them bond with their child/children, and learn ways to handle stressful situations. The goal of the program is to learn healthy ways of coping with these changes in addition to discovering more about the birthing process and hormonal fluctuations your body goes through throughout pregnancy and after childbirth.\n\nBabies up to age 1 are welcome to join mom at the group. The group rooms are designed to provide a warm and welcoming environment with reclining chairs for each mom and baby.\n\nWe offer high and low intensity group options. Our high-intensity group meets in-person or virtually for 2 hours a day, 5 days a week and our low-intensity group meets virtually for 60 minutes, twice per week."
