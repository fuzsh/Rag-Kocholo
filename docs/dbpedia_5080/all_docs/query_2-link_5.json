        "text": "Death outside Canada\n\nOn this page\n\nRepatriating remains to Canada\n\nConsider local limitations. Some countries may have few or no facilities for embalming and preparing remains for transportation.\n\nBe aware of the rules and processes for returning remains to Canada. See the Canada Border Services Agency’s Importation and exportation of human remains and other human tissues for details.\n\nFind qualified funeral homes in Canada and in the country where the death occurred as you will require their help to repatriate the remains of the deceased person to Canada.\n\nAirline regulations may vary for the repatriation of remains. You should not expect to travel on the same plane as the remains when they are being repatriated.\n\nTimelines\n\nThe date of the funeral service in Canada should only be determined after the remains have arrived and have cleared Canadian customs. Several factors could delay the return of the remains to Canada.\n\nThe time required to repatriate remains can vary greatly and depends on a number of factors, including the procedures in the country where the death occurred and the cause of death.\n\nTransporting cremated remains by air\n\nCheck with the airline you plan to use. Not all airlines will transport cremated remains, and some may only transport them using their cargo service.\n\nMake sure that the funeral home provides you with a temporary container to transport the remains that meets the airport security requirements for the departure and receiving countries. The container must be able to clear the X-ray machine at airport security and be permitted past the checkpoints. If in doubt, check with airport authorities.\n\nNotify the airline in advance to ensure you have proper documentation. This may include copies of the death and cremation certificates.\n\nIf you are carrying cremated remains on board an aircraft and are transiting in a Canadian airport, visit the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority’s Cremated Remains page.\n\nCosts\n\nIt can be very expensive to repatriate remains back to Canada and, depending on the circumstances of the death, it may take a long time. In many cases, the funeral home in the country where the person died will require a payment guarantee or payment upfront before starting the process.\n\nThe costs of interpretation or translation services for documents or a ceremony overseas can add up.\n\nAll costs related to a death abroad and the repatriation of remains are the responsibility of the deceased’s next of kin or estate. If the deceased had insurance, it may cover the costs directly or you may have to make the payments and be reimbursed later.\n\nIf the next of kin or the estate cannot pay, final arrangements will be at the discretion of the host nation. This may include burial in a common grave, or donation of the remains to an educational facility.\n\nThe Government of Canada assumes no responsibility for the final arrangements of deceased Canadians.\n\nIf you need help\n\nContact us to inform us of the death and find out how we can help you. You may not need to travel to the country where the death occurred. Consular officials can help you understand the processes. They can also:\n\nHelp notify the deceased’s next of kin, if required.\n\nProvide advice on how to get in touch with the appropriate authorities (police, hospital, morgue and coroner), or contact them on your behalf if you are unable to do so.\n\nThe authorities can help you find the location of the remains and the circumstances surrounding the death.\n\nThey can also help you obtain the appropriate documentation, including death certificates, autopsy and police reports, and documentation for insurance companies, if necessary.\n\nHelp to identify the remains of a Canadian citizen if you, family members, friends or local authorities are not able to do so.\n\nProvide a list of laboratory facilities offering forensic identification services (DNA, dental records, fingerprints).\n\nProvide a list of local funeral service providers.\n\nAuthenticate the local death certificate for insurance or repatriation purposes after it has been authenticated by the local Ministry of Foreign Affairs, if required.\n\nHelp with funds transfers if urgent financial assistance is required and all other options have been exhausted.\n\nHelp you if you have questions about, or need service related to, the passport of the deceased person.\n\nWhile there is a lot we can do to help, Canadian government offices abroad will not:"
