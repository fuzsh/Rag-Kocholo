        "text": "A person born abroad in wedlock to a U.S. citizen and an alien acquires U.S. citizenship at birth if the U.S. citizen parent has been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions prior to the person’s birth for the period required by the statute in effect when the person was born (INA 301(g), formerly INA 301(a)(7)).\n\nFor birth on or after November 14, 1986, the U.S. citizen parent must have been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for five years prior to the person’s birth, at least two of which were after the age of 14.\n\nFor birth between December 24, 1952 and November 13, 1986, the U.S. citizen parent must have been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for 10 years prior to the person’s birth, at least five of which were after the age of 14 for the person to acquire U.S. citizenship at birth. In these cases, either the U.S. citizen parent or their alien spouse must have a genetic or gestational connection to the child in order for the U.S. parent to transmit U.S. citizenship to the child.\n\nIf the child was born abroad out-of-wedlock on or after November 14, 1986 to two U.S. citizen parents, and the U.S. citizen father satisfies the criteria of the “new” INA 309(a), listed below, the child will acquire U.S. citizenship under INA 301(c) if at least one of the parents had a residence in the United States or one of its outlying possessions prior to the person’s birth.\n\nAlternatively, if the U.S. citizen father does not satisfy the criteria of the “new” INA 309(a), the child will automatically acquire U.S. citizenship if the U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year prior to the person’s birth. This requirement was not affected by the Sessions v. Morales-Santana ruling so it does not matter if the person was born before or after June 11, 2017. These requirements are different from requirements for a child born abroad out-of-wedlock to a U.S. citizen mother, which are detailed below on this page.\n\nA person born abroad out-of-wedlock on or after November 14, 1986 to a U.S. citizen father and an alien mother may acquire U.S. citizenship under 301(g) of the INA, as made applicable by the “new” Section 309(a) of the INA, if:\n\nA blood relationship between the person and the father is established by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nThe father was a U.S. citizen at the time of the person’s birth;\n\nThe father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing to provide financial support for the person until he or she reaches the age of 18 years; and\n\nWhile the person is under the age of 18 years:\n\nthe person is legitimated under the law of his/her residence or domicile, or\n\nthe father acknowledges paternity of the person in writing under oath, or\n\nthe paternity of the person is established by adjudication of a competent court.\n\nIf the child was born abroad out-of-wedlock on or after November 14, 1986 to a U.S. citizen father who satisfies the requirements of the “new” INA 309(a) as listed above, the child will acquire U.S. citizenship if the U.S. citizen father was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for five years prior to the person’s birth, including at least two of which were after turning age 14.\n\nPlease note: Persons born between November 15, 1968 and November 13, 1971 may derive U.S. citizenship under either the “new” INA 309(a) and 301, as described above, or the “old” INA 309(a) and 301.)\n\nA person born abroad out-of-wedlock to a U.S. citizen mother and an alien father between December 24, 1952 and June 11, 2017 may acquire U.S. citizenship under Section 309(c) of the INA if the mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of the person’s birth and if the mother was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year prior to the person’s birth.\n\nIn light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. ___, 137 S.Ct. 1678 (2017), a person born abroad out-of-wedlock to a U.S. citizen mother and alien father on or after June 12, 2017, may acquire U.S. citizenship at birth if the mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of the person’s birth and was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a period of five years, including two after turning age 14, in accordance with Section 301(g) of the INA."
