        "text": "My Good to Read recommendation this week is another oldie but goodie: Are You My Mother? by P.D. Eastman.\n\nIt’s a timeless classic that won me over way back at nursery school. First published in 1960 (as part of the Random House Beginner Books series, created under the supervision of Dr Seuss), Are You My Mother? is gentle and heart-warming.\n\nEastman worked at the Walt Disney Studios during the 1930s, later moving to Warner Brothers Cartoons. So, inevitably, his illustrations have a distinct ‘cartoon’ quality which gives them visually expressive personalities. This means they can display strong emotions without the need for words, which adds a great deal to the storytelling – and allows kids to readily engage with them.\n\nThe premise of the story is simple enough: a baby bird hatches to find his mother absent (she’s flown off to fetch something for her baby to eat):\n\n“Where is my mother?” [the baby bird] said.\n\nHe looked up. He did not see her.\n\nHe looked down. He did not see her.\n\n“I will go and look for her,” he said.\n\nFinding your mummy when you don’t even know what she looks like is a challenge! But the baby bird is unphased and determined. He can’t fly yet (of course), so he walks. His naivety adds gentle humour as, ever hopeful, he asks everyone he encounters: “Are you my mother?”\n\nHe asks a kitten and a dog. They are not his mother.\n\nBaby bird scratches his head. ‘Did he have a mother?’\n\nDespite the potentially distressing premise (little lost birdie searches for missing mummy), the story is funny – as this former KS2 teacher explains:\n\nI agree – Are You My Mother? is funny (I especially like the cow’s deadpan reply: “How could I be your mother?…I am a cow.”). Yet at the same time, Are You My Mother? also raises an important (and potentially painful) question: What about children with absent mothers? (Perhaps, for example, those raised solely by dad or in foster care.) Of course, there are many reasons why a child may not have one or both parents. How might they cope with the story?\n\nI first encountered Are You My Mother? as a child at preschool. I enjoyed being there - but I had separation issues and desperately missed my mummy. Meaning I totally identified with this baby bird – and his happy ending reminded me that I would soon be reunited with my own mummy! The writer of the blog, Allison’s Book Bag, explains her own connection with the story:\n\nAs the baby bird becomes ever more determined to find his mummy, he begins to run!\n\nFirst he sees a car.\n\n(For once, the baby bird is wise enough to realise that can’t be his mother!)\n\nKeep going, Baby Bird!\n\nTiny and tenacious, the baby bird is an anti-hero for kids who readily identify with him. His good fortune may be bittersweet for some, but I think ultimately, everyone will find comfort in the story’s resolution."
