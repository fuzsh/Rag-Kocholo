        "text": "Inclusion for All\n\nMotherToBaby welcomes all individuals and families at all stages of their pregnancy and lactation journey and recognizes that not all people identify as “men” or “women.” We strive to use gender-neutral language when talking about pregnancy and lactation. By using inclusive and non-gendered terminology, we strive to enable all families to be empowered to reach their personal and familial pregnancy and lactation goals. While our name still contains a reference to “mothers”, we have updated our website and resources to use more inclusive terms where possible and where doing so allows the overall message to remain clear to the general population. We welcome feedback on any of the terms used and acknowledge that our understanding of these terms will evolve over time and is always better informed by open dialogue.\n\nFind out your estimated due date by entering the first day of your last menstrual period and your average cycle length. Did You Know? Only 1 in 20 babies are born on their actual due date. A normal pregnancy often lasts between 38 to 42 weeks, which keeps most parents guessing right up until labor starts!"
