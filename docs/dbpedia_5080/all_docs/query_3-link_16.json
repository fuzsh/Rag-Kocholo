        "text": "Mother's Day is a special day honouring mothers and mother-figures.\n\nIt's celebrated in lots of countries throughout the world, and is also known as Mothering Sunday.\n\nThis year it falls on Sunday 10 March.\n\nRead on to find out more about where the tradition of Mother's Day in the UK came from.\n\nAnd if you're looking for ideas for how to make it special why not try our Mother's Day makes.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the custom developed of allowing people who had moved away from where they grew up to come back to visit their home or 'mother' churches, and their mothers, on the fourth Sunday of the Christian festival of Lent.\n\nAt the time, it wasn't uncommon for children to leave home to work when they were as young as 10 years old, so this was an opportunity for families to meet up again.\n\nThis became Mothering Sunday in Britain. As the dates of Lent vary each year, so does the date of Mothering Sunday.\n\nAlthough it's often called Mother's Day in the UK, it has no connection with the American Mother's Day.\n\nIn the US, Mother's Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May each year.\n\nThe idea started in America when a woman called Anna Jarvis held a small memorial service for her own mother on 12 May 1907.\n\nSoon after, most places in America were observing the day and in 1914, the US president made it a national holiday, celebrated on the second Sunday of May.\n\nHowever, by 1920 Anna became angry at how companies were using the holiday as a way to make money off people by buying gifts, and even campaigned against the government to remove it from the calendar all together.\n\nMother's Day is at different times of the year and based on different seasons across the world.\n\nIn Ethiopia mothers are celebrated during Antrosht - a three-day festival held at the end of the rainy season in early autumn.\n\nAs the weather clears, family members come together and have a large meal of vegetables, cheese and meat, and celebrate by singing and dancing together.\n\nIn Japan, Mother's Day was originally celebrated on 6 March - as this was the birthday of Empress KÅjun - however, in 1949 it was changed to the second Sunday in May.\n\nFor many mothers around this time, the day was a way to help comfort mothers who had lost their sons from fighting in World War II and traditionally, carnation flowers were given as gifts.\n\nIn Mexico, DÃ­a de Las Madres is celebrated on 10 May, and is a big deal! People take their mothers out for a meal at restaurants, and mariachi bands will sing songs to them like \"Las Mananitas.\""
