        "text": "On The Real Housewives of Miami, Lisa Hochstein is never afraid to share her truth. Most recently, the mom of two has remained open about her tumultuous split from husband Lenny Hochstein following his affair.\n\nAt the Season 6 reunion, for instance, when host Andy Cohen asked how it was going, Lisa said, \"Oh, it's gotten significantly worse.\"\n\n\"He's suing me for forks and knives and pillows and art — art that is mine, by the way,\" she explained. \"He just has it out for me.\"\n\nShe also revealed that, as a result of their marital settlement agreement, she is required to live \"in proximity\" of the home she once shared with Lenny, a provision enacted for the sake of their children, Logan and Elle. But, the places she had been looking at in South Miami proved not close enough to her prior home in Star Island and so her boyfriend, Jody Glidden, ultimately offered to \"pitch in\" for a $32,000 per-month rental.\n\nShe plans to remain in the rental until the house Lenny is building for her as part of their agreement is finished, which could take \"two to three years.\" The deed for the home will in their children's names — but she will not allowed to live in it with any new husband, including (potentially) Jody.\n\nIt's a lot for the blonde beauty, but at least she has many happy memories to look back on.\n\nLong before the Real Housewives were a twinkle in anyone's eye, Lisa was just an adorable little girl in Canada, aspiring to become a model and an actress. Take a trip down memory lane with Lisa with some very personal photos from her past she's shared of her early years.\n\nLisa Hochstein and Her Parents at Her Christening\n\nLisa was born in Toronto, Canada and, like many people, was dolled up for a christening as a small child.\n\nLisa appeared to be snoozing while posing with her mother, Jean, her father, and other celebrants.\n\nYoung Lisa Hochstein with Her Dad\n\nIn the photo above, Lisa played with a doll while sitting on her father's lap.\n\n\"My mother is from Jamaica she is mixed, with German and Jamaican native. My father is from Canada; his heritage is Scottish,\" Lisa told Haute Living in 2012.\n\n\"My mom grew up very poor in a place in Jamaica called Seaford Town, and then they eventually all moved to Canada,\" Lisa shared in Season 6, Episode 17.\n\nLisa Hochstein's Mother, Jean, and Father\n\nLisa's mother, Jean, and her aunt made an appearance in Season 6, Episode 17. Lisa revealed that her relationship with her mom became strained over the course of her marriage to Lenny.\n\n\"You never liked the way he treated me,\" Lisa said to her mom, who responded, \"No.\"\n\n\"He never engages with any of my family,\" Lisa said.\n\n\"If I'm talking to him, he would just walk away,\" Jean continued. \"So, guess what? I text[ed] him. I text[ed] him and [told] him how I feel. He never replied to my text. He never [sat] still to listen to me.\"\n\nYoung Lisa Hochstein Dressed as a Bunny for Halloween\n\nAdorable! The snap above shows a little Lisa wearing a bunny onesie and matching face paint while sucking her thumb.\n\nYoung Lisa Hochstein with Pigtails\n\nLittle Lisa enjoyed playtime with a baby doll and a stuffed bunny, in the above photo.\n\nYoung Lisa Hochstein with a Birthday Cake\n\nBirthday girl! In the photo, a young Lisa sliced a piece of birthday cake complete with two lit candles.\n\nRecently, Lisa celebrated her mom's birthday with a slideshow of pictures of the two of them and a ton of other family throughout her mom's life.\n\nYoung Lisa Hochstein at a Birthday Party\n\nA pigtail-wearing young Lisa enjoyed a piece of Barbie cake at a birthday celebration.\n\nShe celebrated her own daughter's first birthday in 2020 with an elaborate pink cake, plenty of balloons, and matching mother-daughter pink outfits.\n\nLisa Hochstein with Brother Phillip under the Christmas Tree\n\nLisa posed with family members in front of a decorated Christmas tree, which was surrounded by gifts.\n\nYoung Lisa Hochstein in a Purple Dress and Tiara\n\nClearly, Lisa's penchant for glamour goes way back. In the photo above, she donned a frilly, silky lavender dress and a sparkling headband.\n\nYoung Lisa Hochstein on Santa's Lap\n\nIn this cute, Christmasy snap, Lisa sat on Santa's lap while wearing a holiday-ready red dress.\n\nIn 2023, she showed off her white, butterfly-themed Christmas tree in her new apartment.\n\nYoung Lisa Hochstein and Her Brother, Phillip, at Easter\n\n\"I have a younger brother, Phillip. I’m very close with him, but we didn’t get along growing up,\" Lisa told SheKnows in a 2012 interview.\n\n\"I was like a second mom to him,\" explained of her brother to SheKnows. \"I always took care of him, I was old enough to babysit him, I made him snacks and dinner. He was like my son almost!\"\n\nYoung Lisa Hochstein Dressed Up to Dance"
