        "text": "Canadian police are in a frantic search for a mother and her three sons who vanished from Ontario in December.\n\nAstrid Schiller, 55, is accused of abducting her own children and has been on the run for months.\n\nThe mother was reported missing along with her three boys – Leon, 12, Christopher, 11, and Thomas, 9 – from Ontario in December.\n\nAfter months with few reported sightings, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police released news Saturday that the group had been spotted multiple times in recent weeks and the mother had been arrested before being released.\n\nNow the search is on once more for the group, believed to be camping in parks around Saskatchewan province.\n\nRCMP had a breakthrough in its search for Schiller after getting a report at 2 a.m. on June 16 that she was trying to cross the border at Boissevain into the U.S.\n\nOfficers detained the mother and took the children into care in Forrest, Manitoba, but they released her soon after, stating that the arrest warrant issued in Ontario didn't extend into the other province.\n\nIn the early hours of June 17, police were told that the children were no longer at the care home, and it was believed Schiller had taken them once again.\n\nThe group was then spotted in Assiniboia before heading to Pine Cree Regional Park in Saskatchewan on June 19, the RCMP said.\n\nOn Friday, June 21, an abandoned vehicle was found at the park. The white 2018 Mercedes GLC was believed to belong to Schiller, but there was no sign of her or the boys.\n\nNewsweek reached out to RCMP Monday morning via email.\n\nWhen did the Schillers disappear?\n\nIt isn't entirely clear exactly when Schiller and her three boys vanished.\n\nThe Toronto Sun reported that they vanished sometime in December, but said that police had not given many details away about the timeline.\n\nInitially, it is believed Schiller communicated with police but later withdrew that cooperation.\n\nAn arrest warrant was issued on Jan. 24.\n\nAstrid Schiller is a parent's rights activist\n\nPress Progress reported in January that Schiller was part of a Facebook group called \"Stand4Thee\", which is known for creating pseudo-legal documents on conspiracies relating to public health measures, vaccines and education.\n\nThe outlet claimed Schiller had actively participated in the group's Zoom meetings and that she had written to one of her son's schools to say he would not participate in discussions on his gender or sexuality.\n\nOther complaints included standing against raising an LGBTQ+ pride flag at the school and the creation of a gender neutral bathroom.\n\nIn the meeting witnessed by Press Progress, the group reportedly discussed how liberal views were a \"demonic war\" against Christian values.\n\nIn its original press release on the missing group, Durham Regional Police Service said it did not believe there was any risk posed to the children.\n\nFollowing the incident at the border, DRPS said it was continuing to assist in the search for the group \"in any manner necessary\"."
