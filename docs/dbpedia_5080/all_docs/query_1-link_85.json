        "text": "Designed as a family style restaurant, it quickly became popular as it was known for its warm atmosphere, checkered tablecloths, tiffany lamps, and for serving Canadian families with great tasting homestyle meals at reasonable prices.\n\nThe popularity of the Mother’s concept proved to be a successful one, growing to over 100 franchised locations across Canada in a short period of time.\n\nDuring its time, Mother's Pizza Parlour and Spaghetti House truly became a home away from home to Canadian families and became a gathering place for countless get-togethers such as first dates, birthday parties, anniversary’s, and graduations.\n\nThis group eventually sold the Mother’s Corporation to Little Caesars LLC. Little Caesars® then began to convert most of the Mother’s take-out and delivery locations into Little Caesars® Pizza stores and closed the remaining Mother’s sit-down locations.\n\nA sad day for many, however what remains to this day is a brand with a tremendous amount of equity that is firmly engrained in Canada’s restaurant history and in the hearts and minds of millions of Canadians.\n\nBRAND UPDATES\n\nFast-forward to 2020 where brand resurrection expert and Mother's Pizza birthday party alumnus, Brian Alger decides that this legendary brand needs to be restored to its former glory through a number of operations and opportunities.\n\nComing off a phenomenally successful relaunch of another Canadian iconic brand, The Pop Shoppe, Brian realized that Canadians from coast-to-coast wanted to once again taste that Mother's pizza that made the chain so famous.\n\nWith that in mind, Brian set out to recreate his beloved childhood pizza brand. And with just one taste, you will agree, this is what pizza should be.\n\nGhost Kitchen London\n\nMother’s Pizza is pleased to partner with Ghost Kitchen Brands to bring you that same great tasting pizza that you remember. Currently available in London, Ontario, with more locations coming!\n\nMother’s Pizza can be ordered through your favorite delivery app, or by visiting Troy, and his team at their store location at 530 Oxford Road W., London.\n\nGhost Kitchen Ajax\n\nMother’s Pizza is pleased to announce that the Ghost Kitchen location in Ajax now serves Mother’s Pizza!\n\nOrder Mother’s through your favorite delivery app, or by dropping by and seeing Naval and his team at 269 Kingston Road, E. in Ajax.\n\nStay tuned for more locations being added soon!\n\nFood Service\n\nMother’s Pizza Parlour and Spaghetti House products for perfect for many food service operations such as:\n\n· Convivence stores\n\n· QSR\n\n· Entertainment venues\n\n· Ballparks and stadiums\n\n· Hospitals\n\n· Schools and colleges\n\n· Care facilities\n\n· Corporate and institutional dining\n\nOur Mother’s team will work collaboratively with you to create a solution to fit your pizza needs.\n\nBy adding the trusted Mother’s branded products to your existing operation, not only will you increase sales, but you’ll also increase profits.\n\nBrands have always brought consumers comfort, but never before has that been so important.
