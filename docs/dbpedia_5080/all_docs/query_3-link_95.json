        "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. (WJCL) – Debby left a single mother from Georgia and her four children in a state of uncertainty.\n\nA tree came crashing through the roof of their home early Tuesday morning during the storm.\n\n“It just was real scary. And I jumped up and the first thing I did was check on my kids to make sure they was ok,” Shakenna Conyers said.\n\nConyers left her children’s bedroom and was woken up to insulation and debris in her home where the tree fell.\n\n“I’ve been up since 2 a.m., pacing bath and forth,” Conyers said, her home nearly destroyed. A hole in the kitchen ceiling continues through their living room.\n\n“I don’t even know how to be strong,” she said.\n\nConyers’ said she and neighbors had already let the housing development know they were worried about the dead trees in the area before the storm.\n\nShe explained another tree had fallen onto a power line a few weeks prior.\n\nDespite the chaos and uncertainty, Conyers said she’s thankful no one was hurt.\n\n“I don’t want to start crying first. My kids is my everything and as a single mama it’s hard, you know, raising the four kids on your own,” she said. “They just all looking at Mama, like what is we supposed to do?”\n\nConyer made the call to stay inside the home until the end of the storm. The family is now seeking help to recover from the damage and move forward."
