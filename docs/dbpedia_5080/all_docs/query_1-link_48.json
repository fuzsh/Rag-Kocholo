PMG believes in Evidence Based Medicine, supporting research with our PMG research committee and hosting yearly retreats and national medical conferences.\n\nDiversity\n\nIn a world in which racism and discrimination are rampant, we believe that the antidote is knowledge of these topics, amplifying voices of minority and marginalized groups and advocating for them in hopes to create a generational change for a more liberated and equitable future.\n\nCollaboration and Partnerships\n\nThe PMG community is proud to partner and collaborate with organizations and companies that share the similar goals of supporting women, physicians and patients.\n\nI founded Physician Moms Group in November of 2014 by in an effort to bring together women physicians, who are also parents, so that they can collaborate and support each other while sharing their medical expertise in an open forum."
