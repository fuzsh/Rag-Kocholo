**Longlisted for Canada Reads 2022**

In From My Mother’s Back: A Journey from Kenya to Canada, Njoki Wane introduces us to her mother, a woman of deep wisdom, and to all the richness of a life lived between two countries. A celebrated professor and award-winning teacher, she shares her journey from a Catholic girls’ boarding school in rural Kenya to standing in front of a lectern at the University of Toronto. Along the way she reflects on the heritage that was taken from her as a child and the strengths and teachings of the family that pulled her through and helped her to not only succeed as a scholar, but to reclaim her culture, her history and even her name.
