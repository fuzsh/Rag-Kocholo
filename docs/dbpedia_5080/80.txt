Guitarist and vocalist Ryan Guldemond while attending music school in Vancouver, Canada, wished to start a vocal-driven band guided by pop influences. He enlisted the help of sister Molly and friend Debra-Jean Creelman and played various gigs as an acoustic act before recruiting Kenton Loewen on drums and Jeremy Page on bass.

Originally under the moniker Mother, the band independently released a self-titled album which was recorded with the help of Howard Redekopp who has been known for his work with The New Pornographers and Tegan and Sara. The album wasn’t a huge commercial success but acquired the band a host of high-profile gigs including Vancouver International Jazz Festival, Pop Montreal and opening slots for the Wailin’ Jennys and the Cat Empire. Encouraged to change their name to avoid legal issues the band re-released their debut on Feruary 27, 2007 changing the name to “Touch Up”.

Mother Mother’s sophomore album “O My Heart” received positive reviews, with influences as far-reaching as the Pixies, Mozart and William Burroughs. Its follow-up “Eureka” release March 15, 2011, developed the band on a far more orchestral level and adopted a broader spectrum of genre influences from pop ballads to hip-hop. The band’s fourth full-length “The Sticks” was released on September 18, 2012 and charted at No. 11 in the Canadian chart. The band’s most recent album 2014’s “Very Good Bad Thing” was released November 4, 2014 on Island Records, with single “Get Out The Way” reaching No. 9 on the Canadian Alt Chart.
