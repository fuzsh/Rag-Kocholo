BETHANY, W.Va. – Bethany Radio Network took over the college’s cafeteria Friday evening as a participant of World College Radio Day.

Esvin Horbal, Dylan Wise, and Keith Hardt manned the remote broadcast. All are students of Dr. Patrick Sutherland’s introductory level Online Radio class.

Bethany Radio Network was among more than 500 college stations in 28 countries to take part in the annual celebration, according to the College Radio Foundation. In its ninth year, the Oct. 4 World College Radio Day is designed to raise awareness of the numerous college stations operating around the world.

“This is great experience for them,” Sutherland said of the remote broadcast. “It’s as real as it gets for college radio.”

Sutherland, who is the chair of the Department of Communications and Media Arts, said many Bethany alumni have gotten their start on the radio station, which previously operated as WVBC-FM. Today, Bethany Radio Network streams online.

On a global scale, this year’s theme was “Hear It First on College Radio” and Grammy-winning duo The Black Keys were the official ambassadors for the event.

Participating stations showcased how students create unique programming and content that is important to college students and not heard on any other medium, the College Radio Foundation said.

Bethany’s station was among four in West Virginia to participate, according to a list at collegeradio.org. The others were WGLZ at West Liberty University, WMUL at Marshall University, and WPKM-LP at West Virginia University Parkersburg.
