        "text": "Connect your music with the world\n\nThe first audio interface designed for sharing\n\nToday’s mobile devices make it easier than ever to share your music with the world. From Instagram live-streams to YouTube videos, SoundCloud playlists and more, social media and smartphones have become a key aspect of how many musicians get heard and connect with fans.\n\niRig Stream makes it easier than ever to share, letting you connect instruments, mixers and more to your iPhone, iPad, Android device and Mac/PC, with convenient features designed just for use on today’s most popular platforms. Whether it’s mono or stereo, live playing or an existing mix, iRig Stream gets you connected to all your favorite apps, so you can start connecting with listeners instantly.\n\nMix and stream up to 3 audio sources\n\niRig Stream makes it easy to connect all your audio sources and route them to a streaming or recording app. Send the digital output of your smartphone, tablet or laptop into iRig Stream, mix it with external audio sources like mixers, DJ decks, keyboards and more. Add your voice from earbuds (or an iRig Mic) and send all 3 signals back to your device to popular apps like Instagram, or just your built-in camera app.\n\nMake your voice heard\n\niRig Stream offers a unique headphone / microphone jack, wired just like your smartphone, so you can listen and talk over the stereo input simultaneously.\n\nThe mic input is mixed into the stereo inputs, to ensure it works with any app, and offers adjustable volume. Best of all, it works with most headphones with a built-in mic*, and also with IK products like iRig Mic Lav, iRig Mic, and iRig Pre, giving you a wide range of options for any situation.\n\nDesigned for apps\n\nIf you’re ever tried streaming or sharing audio on social media, you know many apps only support mono signals - so iRig Stream offers a mono/stereo switch to compensate. Stereo passes both inputs as left & right channels, and mono mixes them together to a single channel, ensuring you won’t lose anything panned to one side.\n\nBuilt to go and to last\n\niRig Stream is compact enough to slip into the pocket of your backpack, so it’s ideal for use on the go. It runs off your device’s battery, so there’s no batteries to run out mid-show, but can also charge your device with an optional power supply, to keep you going for extended sessions.\n\nThe Creator series from IK Multimedia puts you in the spotlight with fast and easy tools to help you create professional content. Its budget-friendly solutions are ideal for YouTubers, podcasters, live streamers and other social media platforms, and include a variety of mobile and studio-friendly microphones, interfaces and smartphone stands. With convenient features and flexible options, you’ll be covered wherever and whenever inspiration strikes."
