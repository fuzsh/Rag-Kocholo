        "text": "On November 19, Linkin Park will be playing a show at the O2 World in Berlin, Germany, and Linkin Park fans all over the world will be able to watch; the band have partnered up with Samsung and satellite operator SES to broadcast the show live via satellite for TV viewers worldwide.\n\n[YOUTUBE]DVE7qp4MVXw[/YOUTUBE]â€‹\n\nThe show will be streamed exclusive on SES's HD \"Astra\" channel, according to an announcement on the SES website. Fans will get to see the video broadcast in \"Ultra HD\", which means \"a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels, 50 frame per second and a colour depth of 10 bit.\" An article on Broadband TV News further tells us that the concert will be filmed using \"10 Ultra HD cameras [and] can be received unencrypted on [\"Astra].\" Linkin Park's Berlin performance will be their first live music concert to be shown on this channel and at this high a resolution.\n\nThe SES post mentions that the broadcast will only be viewable with Samsung's 2014 Ultra HD TVs. Broadband TV News' article, likely quoting from a press release, gives a little more detail:\n\nFor anyone who's able to catch it, the show will begin at 9PM CET on the evening of November 19.\n\nSource: SES via RayCharlizard\n\nIf that's really the case and not just a case of the press release being badly worded, then that's incredibly stupid. UHD's are still a new technology and to limit the broadcast to that only will mean that many people cannot see it.\n\nBeat me to it\n\nIt makes total sense. The 4K will only be available for the Samsung stream. They'll likely downconvert the footage to the proper resolutions for Blu-Ray and DVD when the live release comes out. 4K Blu-Rays aren't out yet, so they'll likely bump the footage down to 1920x1080p for the Blu-Ray.\n\nLogic belongs nowhere near this thread.\n\nBut I guess those are good points. It still doesn't make sense to broadcast to such few TV sets though.\n\nBTW, yes youtube does allow (very shitty downsampled) 4K uploads.\n\nThe show hasn't been filmed yet. This is a big deal because:\n\n1) This is the first live broadcast of 4K content.\n\n2) Linkin Park might be recording more of their performances in 4K for archival purposes in the future.\n\nI'm sure most of you don't have 4K displays so watching in that resolution wouldn't have much benefit, nor could you decode the HEVC format. That doesn't mean the technology isn't cool, nor that it isn't cool of Linkin Park to do this. You'll still probably get to see the show, just not at the 4K resolution. It's not stupid, the future has to come sometime.\n\nNever thought it being in 4K was stupid..."
