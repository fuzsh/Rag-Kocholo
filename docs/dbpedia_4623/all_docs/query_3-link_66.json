        "text": "Launched in 2022 by Major League Soccer, MLS NEXT Pro is a professional menâs soccer league in the United States and Canada that completes the pro player pathway from MLS NEXT to MLS first teams. MLS NEXT Pro continues to grow the game through innovation and diversity, bringing professional soccer to new communities and creating opportunities both on and off the field. MLS NEXT Pro will celebrate its third season in 2024 with 29 teams, 27 MLS-affiliated and two independent, Carolina Core FC and Chattanooga FC. Additional MLS-affiliated and independent clubs will join in the years ahead, including Cleveland, Jacksonville Armada FC and Connecticut United FC. The majority of MLS NEXT Proâs matches are broadcast on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV as part of the groundbreaking partnership between Apple and MLS.\n\nThe path is clearer than ever and aligned with the worldâs game where players ascend from youth academy to professional teams before breaking onto the global stage. But itâs not just for players. MLS NEXT Pro will be the proving ground for technical and front office staff, and an amplifier for fans, communities, and ideas."
