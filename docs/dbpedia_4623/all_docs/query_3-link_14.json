        "text": "CHRISTEENE in Monty Hall Saturday, August 31\n\nExperience Performance Artist CHRISTEENE and Dance with DJs Mona & Jesse Dorris. CHRISTEENE is a raw spirit of ferocious music, unabashed sexuality, and fiery intimate stank. The Artist has gathered tremendous critical acclaim for her high-octane, radical creative vision that continues to destroy all notions of normality. NOW Magazine titled her “Beyonce on bath salts.” CHRISTEENE “…injects both hip-hop and gay culture with a much needed dose of punk-rock humor and attitude,” said The New Yorker. Proceeds from this event help get CHRISTEENE across the pond! And Support WFMU! Photo credit Brett Lindell.
