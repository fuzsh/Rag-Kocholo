        "text": "Bring your hazardous chemicals and household products to our main location at Los Reales or attend one of our monthly drop-off events held the second Saturday of each month.\n\nThe Household Hazardous Waste Collection Program is a community initiative designed to prevent the improper disposal of hazardous materials that could contaminate our environment if landfilled. Through this program, residents are encouraged to bring their household hazardous waste, such as chemicals, batteries, electronics, and paint, to designated collection sites each month or to the Los Reales Sustainability Campus during drop-off hours. Trained professionals then safely handle and dispose of these materials in an environmentally responsible manner, often through recycling, treatment, or specialized disposal methods. By diverting hazardous waste from landfills, the program helps protect ecosystems, water sources, and public health, promoting a cleaner and safer environment for all.\n\n2024 Community Collection Events\n\nJanuary 13\n\nRodeo Grounds 4823 S. 6th Ave (enter on 3rd Ave) February 10 Pima College West 2202 W.

Unused household hazardous waste should never be poured down the drain, put into the trash, or stored for excessive periods of time.\n\nThrough the HHW Program, residents can drop off their materials and they will be safely recycled, reused, or disposed of properly. Every year thousands of Tucsonans are doing their part to keep Tucson clean and safe - you can too! The Tucson HHW service is available to all residents and fees are determined by residency."
