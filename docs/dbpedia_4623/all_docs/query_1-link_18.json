        "text": "My Apartment © & (p) 1990 Bunj Jam Music-BMI My apartment has an old couch My apartment has a chair My apartment has an old coat Hangin' on a coat hanger over there There's a mailbox that I open It gets deeper and darker everyday I think I'll have this place rented out I'll hide inside Then somebody else can come and stay They'll pay the rent And stay with me In their apartment My apartment has this TV tray Starin' at me the same old way It' hold my paper plates the same old way While I watch these morons play Wheel of fortune everyday What an unfortunate game [chorus & suck and blow] My apartment has this thing I turn on And it play old Larry King I hear him say some similar things About some not so similar things Some fat guys pushing a book And he's telling me how to cook Or some good looking guy I can't even see Is telling me how to buy his look Come stay with me And pay the rent In your apartment\n\nWhole Lotta Choice (Lost In Cleveland) C & p 1997 Bunj Jam-BMI Three strikes and you’re out Two strikes and you’re a little bit down One strike might send a king off to play golf That same strike might send a pauper A much lessor offer But what if one strike went right to your pretty daughter’s face? She’d have to hide that mark when she wanted to go anyplace Way back when things were a bit more fair The only care in her world Was the perfect curl in her hair And how the boys would stare Must have had a friend Must have had all kinds of friends Once had a voice And a whole lotta choice Now I was leaving a show one night in Cleveland Ohio My right hand was fishing around my car’s interior for a map And the next thing you know Instead of going down 90 South I was destined to go up and get a drink Out of a lake at the upper end of the state Now I could’ve been driving just about anyplace There was paint rotting off the houses and holes in the streets There were beer cans along the curb And about every other block I could see The bright green Squeaky clean sign that read “BP” Like a light watching over me So I drove up to get directions and a big bag of potato chips But the door was locked and the speaker was broken So we had to read each other’s lips And man I thought I’d thanked that lady kindly But just about then she flipped me the bird And when I looked down in that sliding metal box I saw a small container of paper clips She didn’t see a single word Must have had a friend Must have had all kinds of friends Once had a voice And a whole lotta choice Now I don’t know about the land of the free But I can see the home of the brave It’s behind bullet proof plastic At a BP Station in Cleveland So I got in my car with no more sense of direction Than when I arrived at that service-less station It was just about then that I met my escort Came in the form of a police car, the finest in Ohio He said what’s a white West Virginia boy doing Driving a Geo, at 1 AM in the Cleveland ghetto I filled him in on my show and everything else I thought he’d like to know I said, I’m trying to connect up with I-90 South He said, Follow me boy, I’ll direct you out And man I thought I’d seen it all When I saw a lady sleeping in the street While I was cranking up my heat And tuned into a re-broadcast of Rush Limbaugh Must have had a friend Must have had all kinds of friend Once had a voice Must have made that her choice"
