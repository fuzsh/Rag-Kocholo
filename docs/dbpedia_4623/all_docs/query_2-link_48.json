        "text": "We have moved buildings at the beginning of 2024! We are now accepting HHW Drop-Off Center Materials at the building along the west side of the General Recycling Area. Enter the gated Recycling Area and stay to the left of the cones to drop-off at the building alongside the Recycling Area.\n\nThere is a lot of road construction happening in Noblesville. We encourage you to check https://www.reimaginepleasantst.com/ as well as https://www.reconstructingsr32.com/ for the latest closures and detours. Additionally, we will have some remodeling to improve our space which will impact drop-off location. The Hamilton County Fairgrounds will also be receiving some renovations which could impact traffic around our facility. Please register ahead to make sure we are open and you know the latest drop-off location. Please have your materials sorted and ready to drop-off.\n\nThe General Recycling Area is Self-Serve and open the same days, hours, and location as the HHW Drop-Off Center. Tuesday through Friday 8am to 5pm and Saturday 8am to 1pm. CLOSED Sunday & Monday. Click here for what is acceptable in that area. This service is for Hamilton County Residents ONLY. No Businesses or Contractors. No outside of Hamilton County residents allowed."
