        "text": "What Is Passive Income?\n\nPassive income is money earned from sources other than a traditional job, requiring little time or effort. That includes earnings from rental properties, stock dividends, courses sold online, and other projects where you're not actively involved in the continued generation of revenue. Although you may have had to put time, money, or effort into starting up such ventures, eventually you collect income passively without much work.\n\nMarguerita Cheng, CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth and one of Investopedia's 100 top financial advisors, says she's optimistic for those looking for passive income opportunities. \"I think there are more prospects than ever for people to create passive income—from creating courses to writing e-books to affiliate marketing and everything in between,\" she said.\n\nLearn the difference between active and passive income below, plus 25 passive income ideas for 2024, and how much you can expect to make from each.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nPassive income is money you bring in without actively and regularly working for it.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has specific rules for passive income, including “material participation,” that determine whether a taxpayer has been actively involved in an income-producing activity.\n\nPortfolio and passive income are frequently confused, but essentially if you're making returns by investing in securities, including crypto, that's technically portfolio income, not passive income. For the purposes of this article, we're using passive in the wider sense of ventures in which there might be upfront activity, but little day-to-day effort.\n\nA taxpayer can claim a passive loss against income generated from passive activities.\n\n25 Ways To Make Passive Income in 2024\n\nThe best passive income sources for you depend on your circumstances. \"It is important to consider the following: cash flow constraints and requirements, time horizon, and risk tolerance,\" Cheng said. \"For example, investment real estate may have higher upside potential, but a longer time horizon, require significant financial capital, and exposure to liquidity risk in the short term.\" Remember to consider your situation—not just what's worked for others.\n\n\"Be positive and optimistic while being pragmatic,\" Cheng said. \"You can build upon your success.\" With that in mind, here are the 25 ways to make passive income in 2024. Later in the article, we discuss each of these in depth.\n\nRent all or part of your property\n\nStore stuff for people\n\nRent out items for people to use\n\nBonds and bond funds\n\nPut up content on YouTube\n\nCreate an online course\n\nInvest in real estate\n\nSell stock photos\n\nDesign custom products\n\nAffiliate marketing\n\nAdvertise on your car\n\nPeer-to-peer lending\n\nUse cash-back rewards\n\nCreate an app\n\nFlip retail products\n\nAutomated dropshipping\n\nCreate an e-commerce subscription box\n\nBuy a vending machine\n\nLicense your music\n\nInvest in index funds\n\nAI-backed tools and apps\n\nDividend-paying stocks\n\nReal estate investment trusts\n\nInvest in a business\n\nAnnuities\n\nUnderstanding Passive Income\n\nPassive income can be a great way to generate some extra cash and supplement regular earnings from your job. If you're interested in passive income, stay away from \"get rich quick\" schemes found among search results for the term online. Cheng suggests you stay mindful of some common misconceptions about passive income.\n\n\"People often underestimate the initial costs of a passive income opportunity and as a consequence may not have adequate liquidity,\" she said. Cheng gave some examples: \"With a franchise, there are certain fixed costs that people will incur before they can experience positive cash flow.\n\nWith investment in real estate, there are mortgage payments, insurance payments, property taxes, maintenance, and management fees involved even if there is no rental income,\" she said.\n\nMarguerita Cheng, CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth and one of Investopedia's 100 top financial advisors, notes that there are many prospects for passive income, but beware. \"Some red flags include sales pitches that sound too good to be true, as well as 'Act now before this opportunity runs out,'\" she said.\n\nPassive vs. Active vs. Portfolio Income\n\nThere are three main categories of earnings: passive, active, and portfolio income.\n\nWhile you can receive passive income without regular labor, active, or earned, income is money you get from direct effort or work. It includes salaries, wages, commissions, tips, or revenue from a business where you provide material participation.\n\nIt's the most common form of income and is subject to standard income tax rates. Active income is the primary source of earnings for most individuals and households and also includes making investments that might later generate portfolio or passive income.\n\nPortfolio, or investment, income is revenue from investments, including dividends, interest, capital gains, and other returns from stocks, bonds, currency exchange, and mutual funds. Unlike active income earned from employment or business activities, portfolio income is based on securities an individual or group owns.\n\nNote that portfolio income is not passive income, although it seems to have many of the same elements. Even though you may wait months or years before reviewing or changing your portfolio selections, an investor is constantly making decisions about buying or holding different securities.\n\nThus, even if you don't change your portfolio for decades, it's your ongoing choice not to do so that makes income from it not wholly passive. Also, remember that the IRS may treat investment income differently than passive income. We discuss the taxation of these different forms of income much further in a section below.\n\nPassive Income Ideas in Depth\n\nThe ideas below are streams of income where you can limit your involvement to the beginning of the venture and expend less time or effort afterward. For 2024, we've included ideas that include leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to create products that provide recurring income.\n\n\"I think people can be really creative,\" Cheng said. Many ideas on this list can be a great way to express your creativity in a way your career might not.\n\nFor the purposes of our list of passive income ideas below, we'll use the more common usage that includes portfolio income within \"passive\" income (as opposed to the activity of working a job), though it's important to keep in mind the distinctions covered elsewhere in this article for income and tax purposes.\n\n1. Rent All or Part of Your Property\n\nRenting your property, entirely or partially, can provide regular rental income. This could include short-term rentals through platforms like Airbnb or long-term leasing.\n\nIncome Potential\n\n1. Short-term rentals (e.g., Airbnb): $100 to $300 per day\n\nDetails: Short-term rentals can be highly profitable, especially in popular tourist destinations. The income depends on the location, property type, and occupancy rate.\n\n2. Long-term rentals: $1,000 to $2,500 per month\n\nDetails: Long-term rentals provide steady monthly income. The exact amount depends on the property's location, size, and local rental market conditions\n\nAdvantages\n\nSteady income: Renting your property can provide a consistent monthly income.\n\nProperty appreciation: Over time, your property may increase in value given its rental income, potentially leading to a larger return on investment when you decide to sell.\n\nTax benefits: You may be able to deduct certain expenses related to renting your property, such as repairs, maintenance, and depreciation.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nVacancies: There may be periods when your property is unoccupied, leading to a loss of income.\n\nMaintenance: Regular maintenance and unexpected repairs can eat into your profits.\n\nProblem tenants: Dealing with difficult tenants or eviction processes can be time-consuming and costly.\n\nLegal compliance: It is crucial to follow local laws, regulations, and zoning ordinances to avoid fines and legal issues.\n\nTips for Success\n\nResearch local rental laws and regulations to avoid any legal pitfalls.\n\nDevelop a detailed lease outlining the rental terms, including rent payments, security deposits, maintenance, and pet policies to protect you and minimize disputes.\n\nDo regular inspections, address maintenance issues fast, and consider upgrading or offering amenities to attract and retain high-quality tenants while preserving or improving your property value.\n\n2. Store Stuff for People\n\nIf you have extra space in your home or on your property to store items for others, you can do so for a fee through platforms like Neighbor or StoreAtMyHouse. This can be especially profitable in urban areas where storage space is at a premium.\n\nIncome Potential\n\n1. Self-storage units: $25 to $500 per month per unit\n\nDetails: Self-storage units are in high demand due to their low maintenance and high profitability. Income varies based on unit size and location.\n\n2. Renting out extra space (e.g., garage, basement): $50 to $600 per month\n\nDetails: Renting out unused space in your home, such as a garage or basement, can generate significant passive income. Platforms like Neighbor facilitate this process\n\nAdvantages\n\nLow maintenance: Unlike renting out living space, storing items typically requires less maintenance and management.\n\nFlexibility: You can offer storage for a variety of items, from furniture to vehicles, and set terms that suit your availability and space.\n\nExtra income: It provides a way to make money from your unused space.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nLiability: You may be responsible for the safety and security of stored items, which could lead to potential liability issues.\n\nSpace limitations: The income potential is directly tied to the amount of available space you have.\n\nAccess and security: Managing access to your property and ensuring the security of stored items is not something many want to take on.\n\nTips for Success\n\nDetermine a niche you might have or if you want to offer general storage. Specializing can help you stand out.\n\nWork with a legal professional to draft a thorough contract that outlines terms of service, liability, insurance requirements, payment schedules, and how disputes will be resolved.\n\nBe responsive to customer questions and complaints, maintain a clean and well-lit storage area, and go above and beyond to meet customers' needs. Part of this is putting in place an easy booking and payment system using online booking apps and offering automatic payment options.\n\n3. Rent Out Items for People to Use\n\nOffer items you own, like tools, specialized equipment, or even your car, for rent to others. This can include anything from gardening tools to camping gear.\n\nIncome Potential\n\n1. Equipment and tools: $25 to $150 per day per item\n\nDetails: High-demand items like power tools, cameras, and drones can be rented out for substantial daily rates if they're highly specialized and in need.\n\n2. Vehicles: $40 to $100 per day\n\nDetails: Renting out vehicles, including cars and recreational vehicles, can be profitable, and the more specialized the vehicle the more you can likely charge.\n\nAdvantages\n\nIncome from unused assets: You can earn money from items that would otherwise be in a garage or closet, such as tools, sports equipment, or a vehicle.\n\nFlexibility: You can set your terms and prices and adjust them based on demand.\n\nMarket reach: Online platforms can help you reach a wide audience looking to rent various items.\n\nPotential tax benefits: You may be able to deduct certain expenses, such as maintenance, insurance, and depreciation, from your taxes.\n\nSharing economy benefits: Renting out your vehicle and other items contributes to a more sustainable sharing economy, reducing the overall number of cars on the road.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nWear and tear: Frequent use by renters can lead to increased maintenance or repair costs.\n\nAvailability: You'll need to manage the availability of your items to avoid having them rented out when you need them.\n\nLiability: Renting out one's belongings can result in damage or loss, so appropriate insurance coverage is important.\n\nStorage space: You'll need a safe and secure place to store your rental items when they're not in use.\n\nTips for Success\n\nResearch popular rental items in your area to ensure a steady stream of customers.\n\nInvest in durable, high-quality items that can withstand repeated use to minimize maintenance and replacement costs.\n\nCreate detailed rental agreements: Your rental contracts should clearly outline terms, including rental period, fees, deposits, and liability waivers to protect your business.\n\nOffer excellent customer service: Respond promptly to inquiries, maintain open communication, and ensure items are clean and well-maintained to encourage repeat business and positive reviews.\n\n4. Bonds and Bond Funds\n\nBonds, bond ladders, and bond funds are popular investment vehicles that can provide investors with a predictable stream of income and potentially lower risk compared with stocks.\n\nIncome Potential\n\n1. Government and corporate bonds: 2% to 5% annual yield\n\nDetails: Bonds provide a stable and predictable income stream. Government bonds are generally safer but offer lower yields, while corporate bonds can offer higher returns with increased risk.\n\n2. Bond funds: 2% to 6% annual yield\n\nDetails: Bond funds pool money from multiple investors to buy a diversified portfolio of bonds. They offer higher yields than individual bonds but come with management fees.\n\nAdvantages\n\nLower risk compared with stocks: Bonds and bond funds are generally considered to be less risky than stocks.\n\nPredictable income stream: Bonds and bond funds provide a more stable and predictable income through interest payments, and are less prone to the same level of market volatility.\n\nPotential for capital preservation: Bonds and bond funds can offer the potential for capital preservation, as the principal value of the bond is typically repaid to the investor at maturity, assuming the issuer does not default on their obligations.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nLower potential returns than stocks: While bonds and bond funds offer greater stability and predictability compared with stocks, they also typically provide lower potential returns over the long term, which can impact the overall growth of an investor's portfolio.\n\nInterest rate risk: Bond prices have an inverse relationship with interest rates, meaning that as interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and vice versa. This interest rate risk can lead to potential losses for bondholders, particularly those with longer-term maturities.\n\nCredit risk: Bonds and bond funds are subject to credit risk, which is the risk that the bond issuer may default on their payments or fail to repay the principal at maturity. This risk is higher for lower-quality, high-yield bonds compared with investment-grade bonds.\n\nTips for Success\n\nTo manage risk, diversify your bond investments across a range of issuers, sectors, and maturities, rather than concentrating your holdings in any single area.\n\nConsider laddering your bond portfolio. This involves investing in bonds with different maturity dates to mitigate interest rate risk and ensure a steady stream of income over time.\n\nTo minimize credit risk, focus on investing in high-quality, investment-grade bonds from reputable issuers with strong credit ratings.\n\nMonitor your bond investments regularly and adjust your portfolio as needed based on changes in interest rates, credit quality, or your individual financial goals and risk tolerance.\n\n5. Put Up Content on YouTube\n\nYou can take your favorite interests, like travel, and use social media to earn extra income. \"If you enjoy travel...writing a travel blog takes time, energy, and commitment—you could consider creating a YouTube channel,\" Cheng said.\n\nWhile most who earn money from YouTube have a constant presence, you may have an idea for content that fits a perennial need and can earn you income from ads, sponsorships, or affiliate marketing.\n\nIncome Potential\n\nAd revenue and sponsorships: $1 to $5 per 1,000 views\n\nDetails: YouTube content creators earn money through ad revenue and sponsorships. The income depends on the number of views, engagement, and niche.\n\nAdvantages\n\nGlobal audience: YouTube's vast reach allows you to connect with viewers worldwide.\n\nDiverse revenue streams: You can earn money through ad revenue, sponsorships, and merchandise sales.\n\nCreative freedom: You can create content that aligns with your interests and expertise.\n\nLow barrier to entry: Creating and uploading content on YouTube is free and relatively easy, requiring only a camera, essential editing software, and an internet connection.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nTime and effort: Building a successful channel requires significant time and effort, especially in the beginning.\n\nAlgorithm changes: YouTube's search methods can be unpredictable, affecting your video's visibility and earnings.\n\nCompetition: The platform is highly competitive, with many creators vying for viewers' attention.\n\nTips for Success\n\nRegularly upload high-quality content to keep your audience engaged and attract new subscribers.\n\nUse keywords, tags, and compelling thumbnails to improve your videos' visibility in search results.\n\nInteract with your audience through comments, live streams, and social media to build a loyal community.\n\nFind your niche: Identify your content's specific niche or target audience to help you stand out and attract dedicated viewers.\n\n6. Create an Online Course\n\nShare your expertise by designing and selling courses in your field of knowledge. Platforms like Udemy are a popular choice. While putting a course up with lectures, quizzes, and so on is a lot of work, some courses resonate and earn their creators money for years.\n\nIncome Potential\n\nCourse sales and subscriptions: $50 to $500 per course\n\nDetails: Online courses can offer depressingly low income, given the work and expertise you put into it, or highly profitable, especially if they cover in-demand skills or topics. Platforms like Udemy and Teachable facilitate course creation and sales. Some platforms offer subscription models where users pay a monthly fee for access to all courses. You get a small percentage of this.\n\nAdvantages\n\nScalability: Once created, your course can be sold to unlimited students at no additional cost.\n\nFlexibility: You can design the course around your schedule and update it as needed.\n\nEstablish your authority: Teaching a course can set you up as an expert.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nTime investment: Creating a high-quality course requires a lot of time upfront.\n\nMarket saturation: Depending on your niche, there may be a lot of competition, including free courses, making it harder to stand out.\n\nTechnical skills needed: Developing an online course may require video production, audio editing, and course platform management knowledge.\n\nTips for Success\n\nChoose a topic you're passionate about and is in demand in the market.\n\nCreate engaging content with a mix of video, text, and interactive elements to keep students engaged.\n\nProvide support and engagement by providing students with resources, Q&A sessions, or a community forum to foster engagement and support their learning journey. This will also leave them wanting to recommend your course to others.\n\n7. Invest in Real Estate\n\nPerhaps the oldest way to earn passive income on this list. Invest in property to rent or sell at a profit. Consider different markets and property types for the best investments.\n\nIncome Potential\n\nRental income: $1,000 to $2,500 per month per property\n\nDetails: Rental properties provide steady monthly income.

The income depends on the annuity type and terms.\n\nAdvantages\n\nGuaranteed stream of income: Annuities provide a guaranteed stream of income for a set period or the remainder of the investor's lifetime, helping to mitigate the risk of outliving one's savings in retirement.\n\nTax-deferred growth: The investment earnings within an annuity grow on a tax-deferred basis, meaning that taxes are not due until the money is withdrawn, allowing for potentially faster wealth accumulation over time.\n\nCustomizable payouts: Annuities offer a range of payout options, such as lifetime payments, joint and survivor payments, or period-certain payments.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nLimited liquidity and potential surrender charges: You may not be able to access your funds easily or without penalty. Many annuities also have surrender charges for early withdrawals, which can significantly impact the overall return on investment.\n\nLower returns compared with other investments: Due to the costs and fees associated with annuities, such as mortality and expense charges, administrative fees, and rider costs, the overall returns on annuities may be lower than other investment options with lower fees.\n\nLack of control over underlying investments: When investing in an annuity, the investor generally has no control over how the funds are invested, as the insurance company manages the underlying portfolio, which may not align with the investor's specific investment preferences or goals.\n\nTips for Success\n\nBefore purchasing an annuity, compare products from multiple insurance companies to find the best combination of features, costs, and benefits that align with your specific needs and goals.\n\nCarefully review and understand the fees, surrender charges, and payout terms associated with any annuity product before investing, as these can significantly impact your overall returns and access to funds.\n\nGiven the complexity of annuity products and the long-term nature of the investment, it's essential to consult with a qualified financial advisor who can help you evaluate your options and determine if an annuity is a suitable fit for your overall financial plan.\n\nPassive Income According to the IRS\n\nPassive income is revenue you get from neither your portfolio nor wages and does not require an ongoing effort. The term “passive income” is frequently used loosely for any revenues, including investment returns, that appear to require little or no effort by the one receiving it.\n\nThe IRS, which gets the last word on this when you're filing your taxes, rules out the following as passive income: “interest, dividends, annuities, and royalties not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business,” income tax refunds, and income derived from the cancellation of debt.\n\nMeanwhile, the agency defines passive or unearned income as “net rental income,” income from a “business in which the taxpayer does not materially participate,” and, in some cases, self-charged interest.\n\nWhen you record a loss on a passive activity, only passive-activity profits can have their deductions offset instead of the income as a whole. It would be prudent to ensure that all your passive activities were classified that way to make the most of the tax deduction. These are allotted and applied to account for the next year’s earnings or losses.\n\nTo save time and effort, you can group two or more passive activities into one larger activity if you form an “appropriate economic unit,” according to the IRS. When you do this, instead of providing material participation in several activities, you only have to provide it for the activity as a whole.\n\nIn addition, if you include several activities in one group and have to dispose of one of those activities, then you’ve only done away with part of a larger activity as opposed to all of a smaller one.\n\nThe organizing principle is that if the activities are located in the same geographic area, if the activities have similarities in the types of business, or if the activities are somehow interdependent, they can be grouped.\n\nLet's deal with the specific types of income with special tax considerations:\n\nBusinesses in Which You Don't \"Materially Participate\"\n\nInvesting in a business where you don’t materially participate offers the potential for passive income. This typically involves putting capital into a venture without involvement in its day-to-day operations or management decisions. The key is that your role is not active; your involvement is primarily financial.\n\nThis kind of investment can appeal to those diversifying their income streams but don’t have the time to engage in a business themselves. The returns are usually generated through profit-sharing, depending on the entity's business, allowing you to benefit from its activity without the demands of actively managing a business whose trade you may know little about.\n\nHere’s an example. Suppose you put $500,000 into a candy store with the agreement that the owners would pay you a percentage of the earnings. This would be considered passive income as long as you do not participate in the operation of the business other than investing.\n\nIf you help manage the company or take up the tasty role of eating each type of candy to be sold to recommend what to stock, your efforts may count as “material “participation.”\n\nHere are the IRS’s criteria for material participation:\n\nIf you’ve dedicated more than 500 hours to a business or activity from which you’re profiting\n\nIf your participation in an activity has been “substantially all” of the participation for that tax year\n\nIf you’ve participated up to 100 hours, which is at least as much as any other person involved in the activity\n\nRental Properties\n\nRental properties are defined as passive income with a couple of exceptions. If you’re a real estate professional, any rental income that you’re making counts as active income. If you’re self-renting, meaning that you own a space and rent it out to a corporation or partnership where you conduct business, that also doesn't constitute passive income. (That's unless the lease was signed before 1988.)\n\nIncome from leasing land does not qualify as passive income, either. However, a landowner can benefit from passive income loss rules if the property nets a loss during the tax year.\n\nSelf-Charged Interest\n\nWhen money is lent to a partnership or an S corporation acting as a pass-through entity (essentially, a business designed to reduce the effects of double taxation) by the corporation's owner, the interest income on that can qualify as passive income.\n\nCan I Use the Losses From One Passive Income Source to Offset Profits From Another?\n\nYes, losses from one passive activity can generally be used to offset income from other passive activities. For example, if you incur a loss from a rental property, that loss can usually be used to offset passive income from a limited partnership. However, there are rules and limitations, such as passive activity loss limitations, so it's important to consult with a tax professional for specific advice on your situation.\n\nIs Investment Income the Same As Passive Income?\n\nPassive income is frequently defined, somewhat loosely, as earnings derived from activities that don’t require active participation. However, interest, dividends, and capital gains are not classified by the IRS as passive income. Instead, they fall under the category of portfolio income.\n\nHow Can I Make $1,000 a Month From Passive Income?\n\nThere are plenty of ways to generate passive income. Examples include renting out a space, such as a bedroom or an entire house, investing in securities that pay dividends or interest, and selling goods and services online as a side hustle.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPassive income can be derived over time using different means. From renting out property and leveraging automated technologies to creating digital content, these avenues offer the potential for sustainable financial growth.\n\nWhile each method carries its own set of risks and rewards, the key to successful passive income lies in initial strategizing and occasional monitoring. As we move further into an era where traditional income models are being supplanted by gig and other non-traditional forms of work, many are finding they need more flexible income streams as they work toward a more secure financial foundation for themselves."
