        "text": "I’m not much of an analog audio guy. I like listening to music, but I don’t get so obsessed with sound quality that I try to optimize every single listening second. So I thought that getting into collecting albums on vinyl wouldn’t be for me. Until I tried the Victrola Stream Onyx, a player designed specifically around a digital streaming experience.\n\nVictrola has a long history of making excellent record players, but the Stream Onyx is a little unique. Its primary distinguishing feature is its ability to stream to Sonos speakers—which sounds a little counterintuitive. Isn’t the point of investing in a vinyl collection to get that rich analog sound?\n\nWell, maybe. And the Stream Onyx still has analog outputs if you want to retain the option of listening that way. However, the addition of Sonos streaming—and the simplicity that the Onyx provides—makes a strong argument that vinyl and digital pair really well together.\n\nThe Digital Paradox\n\nThe Stream Onyx is a remarkably simple device. It has an analog stereo RCA output, so you can use it like a traditional record player, and it has an Ethernet port for connecting to your network. But it’s only necessary to connect the power cable. Then you can stream audio from the player to any Sonos-compatible speaker in the house.\n\nThis isn’t the only record player that can connect wirelessly to speakers, but many alternatives use Bluetooth, which doesn’t capture quite as much detail and richness as Sonos audio, and has more limitations in terms of streaming distance. While it might not satisfy audio purists, I found the sound quality coming from my Onyx—paired with a Sonos Era 300—to be excellent. The clicks, pops, and texture of playing a record came through just as clearly as they would from analog speakers (to my ears, anyway).\n\nHowever, since Sonos isn’t the only option, there’s still flexibility to get the best of both worlds. The analog RCA output means that you can connect the player to a robust analog system, but still stream music to other rooms that might be less convenient to connect. Maybe you prefer listening to records in your hi-fi den, but there’s nothing stopping you from continuing playback on a speaker in the kitchen.\n\nBeyond the Needle\n\nIt’s also worth keeping in mind how much of the experience of listening to records isn’t just about audio quality. I’m not a huge record collector, but I had the same experience as reviews editor Julian Chokkatu when he first got into vinyl. Visiting a record store, putting hands on a full album, the tactile experience of interacting with a single work is unparalleled in a streaming world.\n\nThe interface for listening to music is also very different on a record. One might ask, “If you’re going to stream digitally, why even bother using a record player at all?” My top answer is that you can’t pause a record. Once I put on a vinyl of Queen’s greatest hits, I’m committed. There’s no track skipping, no shuffling. Just listening to an album the way the artist intended. And I’ve got a giant sleeve with album art, photos, and extras to peruse while I do.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how liberating this is, how much more intimately I feel the music when I listen like this. It’s an experience that streaming just can’t touch. When I listen to one song on vinyl, no algorithm is going to try to guess what I’d like to hear next, only to bafflingly follow Van Halen with a song from Bo Burnham: Inside, just because I’ve listened to both recently. (Looking at you, YouTube Music.)\n\nI found myself being much more deliberate with my music choices, spending more time with particular artists, and going on a longer emotional journey than I would otherwise. And at the end of the day, that matters a lot more to me than whether the audio fidelity has a slightly different feel to it because of an analog signal.\n\nRoom for Improvement\n\nI wish I could say I unequivocally love the Stream Onyx, but I’m afraid I must equivocate a little bit. My primary annoyance is that the dust cover is rather insubstantial. Most record players with covers have a case that seals the platter in, but the Onyx has a small plastic cap that leaves a lot of space between itself and the player for dust to slip in the sides. It’s better than nothing, but I’d have preferred something more robust. You can always buy something to put over the dust cover, but that's annoying.\n\nIt’s also completely irrelevant to anyone without a Sonos-compatible speaker. While Sonos speakers are nice, and we have plenty we like, they’re not the only wireless speaker system on the planet. If you want to use a Bose system, some Bluetooth speakers, or even just cast to your smart speakers, you’re completely out of luck. The best you can do here is get a converter to translate the RCA output to something wireless, but the Stream Onyx doesn’t accommodate this.\n\nAt $600, it’s a couple hundred dollars more than comparable record players on the market, minus the Sonos compatibility. It’s definitely worth the premium for Sonos sound systems and for folks who want something that easily works in there Sonos-enabled homes, but if you’re not already in that ecosystem, there are better turntables for less for you."
