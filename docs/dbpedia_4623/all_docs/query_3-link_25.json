        "text": "Iâm sorry my father is not here to see this. He was a real old-time, DJ, whose spun live records next to Alan Freed in Cleveland Ohio in the early days of rock ânâ roll back in the early 50s. There was no way to know back then that today these vinyl records would be collectibles.\n\nFortunately, I kept most of my records from the late 60s and early 70s and now I have a wonderful way to do an inventory. Itâs been a lot of fun and I look forward to adding more to my collection now because it makes it a lot easier to search for those records that are hard to find.\n\nBack in 1980 I lost 150 vinyl albums to a flash flood that came through the townhouse. I have a little over 200 that survived. I lived in a townhouse at that time we managed to run them upstairs to the second floor, but some of them didnât make it there in time. Iâm slowly remembering what records were lost. I am trying to gradually replace them.\n\nKudos to everyone here !!! Rock on!!\n\nThe overall concept of Discogs is really cool. Love the fact that it has so many records in its database. However, the functionalities in this app make it not enjoyable to use. I find myself more frustrated than itâs worth when attempting to add new records to my collection. Many instances where records will show up when you type in the info but the app gives you an error every time you try to click on it. So you try a new one as there is a couple options; this time you get stuck in a never ending loading screen. You decide to type it in the search bar again, you find it, you click it, it presents an error, you have to retype the entire serial number as the app does not save your searches unless you actually press the âsearchâ button after typing in the information. Only problem is that if you do complete the search by pressing the âsearchâ button, Discogs will not be able to find the record. However it shows up in the suggested records when you type the record serial in before you hit the âsearchâ button. App is just really clunky and hard to use.\n\nI started using this app when I realized that I was purchasing double of the same albums more than a few times because I would be excited at the moment in a vinyl store (like a kid in a toy store) and couldnât remember if I had already purchased what I was looking at. Yes, I have a problem. Well, I had two: being addicted to vinyl, & not always being able to remember what I had already purchased when over stimulated when surrounded by LPâs. It has become my go to app for everything Vinyl. There are more functions like buying and selling and digital music which I am just starting to explore but even without that I absolutely love the way I am able to keep track of not only my catalog but the condition of the media, the jackets, and even make notes on certain selections. I highly recommend if you enjoy the warm crackling natural sound of Vinyl."
