Now offering 24-hour auditory entertainment and typically having a station for every preference, ranging from national, regional, local, internet radio, and so much more; our listening habits and taste in music may have evolved but so has the radio.\n\nHaving access to the latest chart music or timeless classics could be essential in creating an environment your customers and staff can immerse themselves in. Furthermore, playing the radio is an effective way you could enhance your atmosphere, keep customers up to date with current affairs and have genre specific playlists curated for your customers’ taste.\n\nYou have a wide variety of choice in your TV and radio station selection, allowing for flexibility. Choose the station or channel that best fits your brand and select which platform is best suited to your business. By determining which station’s tone and style best reflects your brand and what device is most applicable to your business, you could create a space which is as much known for its great atmosphere as it is for its excellent services and products.\n\nTheMusicLicence allows you to legally play the radio at work and enjoy the benefits of playing music whilst ensuring its creators are fairly rewarded.\n\nSo, do you need a licence to play the radio in your business? The answer is yes and here’s why.\n\nYou will need a music licence for the radio, in the UK, if you are playing the radio in your business. Whether this be from internet radio usage or from other devices. Under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, permission is needed from the relevant copyright holders – those people who create music – in order to play or perform music in public. Playing the radio in your business is classed as a public performance whether this is for your customers, your staff or both.\n\nIf you are playing the radio, or other channels from a TV in your business, a TV licence allows you to receive the broadcast signal to the television within your business. However, it does not give you permission to play or perform the music within the broadcast. TheMusicLicence gives you that permission, for virtually all commercially released music available.\n\nIf you are playing the radio in the UK the cost of a music licence varies. Things like the size of a business are measured in different ways under different tariffs, depending on what is appropriate for each business type.\n\nSo, to calculate your fee, we may need you to provide information such as square meterage, number of employees, or venue capacity. We may also need to know the types of devices you use to play recorded music, and information about any live performances of music."
