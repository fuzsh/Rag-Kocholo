        "text": "Gustaf VI Adolf (Oscar Fredrik Wilhelm Olaf Gustaf Adolf; 11 November 1882 – 15 September 1973) was King of Sweden from 29 October 1950 until his death.\n\nHe was the eldest son of King Gustaf V and his wife, Victoria of Baden, and had been Crown Prince of Sweden for the preceding 43 years in the reign of his father.\n\nGustaf VI Adolf was a lifelong amateur archeologist particularly interested in Ancient Italian cultures.\n\nBirth\n\nGustaf Adolf photographed with his younger brother Prince Vilhelm in 1885.\n\nHe was born at the Royal Palace in Stockholm and at birth created Duke of Skåne. A patrilineal member of the Bernadotte family, he was also a descendant of the House of Vasa through maternal lines. Through his mother, Victoria, he was a descendant of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden of the deposed House of Holstein-Gottorp.\n\nCrown Prince (1907–1950)\n\nGustaf Adolf became Crown Prince of Sweden on 8 December 1907, at the death of his grandfather, King Oscar II.\n\nIn 1938 he was elected an honorary member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati.\n\nReign (1950–1973)\n\nOn 29 October 1950, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf became king at age 67 upon the death of his father, King Gustaf V. He was at the time the world's oldest heir apparent to a monarchy. His personal motto was Plikten framför allt, \"Duty before all\".\n\nDuring Gustaf VI Adolf's reign, work was underway on a new Instrument of Government to replace the 1809 constitution and produce reforms consistent with the times. Among the reforms sought by some Swedes was the replacement of the monarchy or at least some moderation of the old constitution's provision that \"The King alone shall govern the realm.\"\n\nGustaf VI Adolf's personal qualities made him popular among the Swedish people and, in turn, this popularity led to strong public opinion in favour of the retention of the monarchy. Gustaf VI Adolf's expertise and interest in a wide range of fields (architecture and botany being but two) made him respected, as did his informal and modest nature and his purposeful avoidance of pomp. While the monarchy had been de facto subordinate to the Riksdag and ministers since 1917, the king still nominally retained considerable reserve powers. Even these nominal powers were removed when Sweden's constitutional reform became complete in 1975, thus making Gustaf Adolf the last monarch to wield even nominal political power.\n\nThe King died in 1973, ten weeks shy of his 91st birthday, at the old hospital in Helsingborg, Scania, close to his summer residence, Sofiero Castle, after a deterioration in his health that culminated in pneumonia. He was succeeded on the throne by his 27-year-old grandson Carl XVI Gustaf, son of the late Prince Gustaf Adolf. He died the day before the election of 1973, which is suggested to have swayed it in support of the incumbent Social Democratic government.[1] In a break with tradition, he was not buried in Riddarholmskyrkan in Stockholm, but in the Royal Cemetery in Haga alongside his two deceased wives. He was the last surviving son of Gustaf V.\n\nPersonal interests\n\nThe King's reputation as a \"professional amateur professor\" was widely known; nationally and internationally, and among his relatives. Gustaf VI Adolf was a devoted archaeologist, and was admitted to the British Academy for his work in botany in 1958. Gustaf VI Adolf participated in archaeological expeditions in China, Greece, Korea and Italy, and founded the Swedish Institute in Rome.\n\nGustaf VI Adolf had an enormous private library consisting of 80 000 volumes and – nearly more impressively – he actually had read the main part of the books. He had an interest in specialist literature on Chinese art and East Asian history. Throughout his life, King Gustaf VI Adolf was particularly interested in the history of civilization, and he participated in several archaeological expeditions. His other great area of interest was botany, concentrating in flowers and gardening. He was considered an expert on the Rhododendron flower. At Sofiero Castle (the king's summer residence) he created one of the very finest Rhododendron collections.\n\nLike his son, Prince Bertil, Gustaf VI Adolf maintained wide, lifelong interests in sports. He enjoyed tennis and golf, and fly fishing for charity.\n\nFamily and issue\n\nGustaf Adolf married Princess Margaret of Connaught on 15 June 1905 in St. George's Chapel, at Windsor Castle. Princess Margaret was the daughter of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of the United Kingdom.\n\nKing Gustaf VI Adolf and Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden had five children.\n\nCrown Princess Margaret died suddenly on 1 May 1920 of an infection following surgery. At the time, she was eight months pregnant and expecting her sixth child.\n\nHe married Lady Louise Mountbatten, formerly Princess Louise of Battenberg, on 3 November 1923 at St. James's Palace.[2] She was the sister of Lord Mountbatten and aunt of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. It was Lady Louise who became Queen of Sweden. Both Queen Louise and her stepchildren were great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.\n\nGustaf Adolf's second marriage to Louise produced only one stillborn daughter on 30 May 1925.\n\nWhile his first wife visited her native Britain in the early years of their marriage, it was widely rumored in Sweden that Gustaf Adolf had an affair there with operetta star Rosa Grünberg.[3] Swedish vocalist Carl-Erik Olivebring (1919–2002) in a press interview claimed to be an extramarital son of Gustaf VI Adolf, a claim taken seriously by the king's biographer Kjell Fridh (1944–1998).\n\nKing Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden was the grandfather of his direct successor King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and former Queen Anne-Marie of Greece.\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\n\nTitles and styles\n\n11 November 1882 – 8 December 1907: His Royal Highness The Duke of Skåne, Prince of Sweden\n\n8 December 1907 – 29 October 1950: His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Sweden, Duke of Skåne\n\n29 October 1950 – 15 September 1973: His Majesty The King of Sweden\n\nHis title used in official documents was: Gustaf Adolf, by the Grace of God, Sweden's, Gothia's and Wendia's King (Swedish: Gustaf Adolf, med Guds nåde, Sveriges, Götes och Vendes Konung).\n\nHonours Swedish\n\nOfficial Orders\n\nLord and Master (and Knight with Collar from birth) of the Order of the Seraphim\n\nLord and Master (and Commander Grand Cross from birth) of the Order of the Sword\n\nLord and Master (and Commander Grand Cross from birth) of the Order of the Polar Star\n\nLord and Master (and Commander Grand Cross) of the Order of Vasa\n\nLord and Master (and Knight by birth) of the Order of Charles XIII\n\nQuasi-Official Orders\n\nHigh Protector (and Honorary Knight) of the Order of Saint John in Sweden\n\nOfficial Medals\n\nKing Oscar II:s Jubilee Commemorative Badge (1897)\n\nKing Oscar II:s and Sophia's Golden Wedding Commemorative Badge (1907)\n\nKing Gustaf V:s Commemorative Badge for his 70th birthday (1928)\n\nKing Gustaf V:s Commemorative Badge for his 90th birthday (1948)\n\nCrown Prince Gustaf's and Victoria's Silver Wedding Commemorative Badge (1906)\n\nThe Medal Illis Quorum Meruere Labores of the 18th size\n\nForeign\n\nAustria\n\nGreat Star of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria (1960)[5]\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary (Austro-Hungarian Empire)\n\nGrand Cordon of the Order of Leopold\n\nKnight of the Order of the Elephant (1903)\n\nGrand Commander of the Order of Dannebrog (24 March 1952)\n\nCollar of the Order of Mohammed Ali\n\nCommander Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the White Rose\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour\n\nGermany\n\nGrand Cross Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n\nKnight of the Order of the Black Eagle\n\nCommander of the Order of the Red Eagle\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the House Order of Fidelity\n\nHouse and Merit Order of Peter Frederick Louis\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Saxe-Ernestine House Order\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Rue Crown\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer\n\nKnight Grand Cross decorated with Collar of the Order of the Falcon\n\nGrand Collar of the Order of Pahlavi\n\nOrder of Al Rafidain\n\nItaly\n\nKnight Grand Cross decorated with Grand Cordon of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (14 June 1966)\n\nKnight of the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation (1905)\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (1905)\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy (1905)\n\nCollar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion\n\nCommander of the Order of St. Olav\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Norwegian Lion\n\nKnight of the Order of Osmanieh, 1st Class\n\nOrder of the Sun with diamonds\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword\n\nKnight of the Order of St. Andrew\n\nKnight of the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Stanislaus\n\nKnight of The Class of the Order of St. Anna, 1st class\n\nKnight of the Order of the White Eagle\n\nKnight of the Order of the Golden Fleece (31 January 1910, 1126th Knight)\n\nRoyal Knight of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri\n\nStranger Knight of the Order of the Garter (1954, 913th member)\n\nHonorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath\n\nRecipient of the Royal Victorian Chain\n\nHonorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order\n\nHonorary degrees\n\nIn 1918, Gustaf VI Adolf received an honorary doctorate at Lund University, in 1926 an Honorary Doctorate at Yale, Princeton and Clark Universities, at Cambridge in 1929 and in 1932 at the University of Dorpat.\n\nArms and monogram\n\nUpon his creation as Duke of Skåne, Gustaf Adolf was granted a coat of arms with the arms of Skåne in base. These arms can be seen on his stall-plates both as Knight of the Swedish order of the Seraphim in the Riddarsholmskyrkan in Sweden, but also the Frederiksborg Chapel in Copenhagen, Denmark, as an Knight of the Danish Order of the Elephant. Upon his accession to the throne in 1950, he assumed the Arms of Dominion of Sweden."
