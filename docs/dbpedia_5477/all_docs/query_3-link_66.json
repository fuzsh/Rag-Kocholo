I have never ever found him in an entrylist or report. Does anybody know a race where he took part?\n\nPossibly he raced under the pseudonyme \"Monsieur Adrian\" and in a Bugatti 35.\n\nHe could also have used the name \"Inge Vidare\" which is a joke, it could be quite normal names in Sweden but together it means \"No Good\"\n\nHe lived most of his time back then in southern France, so IF he was a racing driver, most likely he raced at places like Pau, St Gaudens, Angouleme etc.\n\n?\n\nHans? Leif? Or any other expert on that era? What's your opinion, did he exist as a \"famous driver\"?\n\nStefan\n\nI know he liked racing cars and he was a very good friend of the late Ronnie Peterson. The only thing I have found in my life in reference to the Prince racing career was:\n\nDIED. PRINCE BERTIL, 84, uncle to Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and the man who postponed marriage for three decades to secure smooth succession in the Bernadotte royal line; in Stockholm. The Prince was a race-car driver in the 1930s, using the pseudonym \"Monsieur Adrian\" to placate his disapproving father, later King Gustaf VI Adolf. Prince Bertil continued to act in the monarchy's best interests by forgoing marriage to his British girlfriend, Lilian Craig. Under Swedish law, which has since been changed, such a union with a commoner would have rendered him ineligible to serve as regent, should the need have arisen, to Carl Gustaf, son of Prince Bertil's deceased older brother. The Prince finally married the patient Lilian in 1976, three years after nephew Carl Gustaf was safely on the throne.\n\nIt was publushed in: http://www.time.com/...milestones.html\n\nHi,\n\nStefan, you're right. He was a famous racing driver, BUT(!) he never raced under his real name because the swedish king, his father, didn't allow him to drive racingcars because he found it to dangeruos. I don't know what name or names he used instead though.\n\nHope my answear helped you a little.\n\nI remember seeing photo's of him in the 70's talking to King Ronnie and even then he appeared to me to dress and look like a 30's racing driver.\n\nThanks everybody for your information. Prince Bertil was a real fan of motor racing and he was nicknamed \"The motor prince\". He was around for many races, in Sweden and abroad, and a keen follower of F1. The Swedish Racing History Club every year arrange the \"Prince Bertil Memorial\". If I am not completely wrong, the \"Royal Horse Stable\" has some racing cars in their hidings, some Bugattis and Talbots and a Shelby Cobra!\n\nBut my question is still not answered: Was Prince Bertil really a racing driver and where did he compete?\n\nOur king Carl XVI Gustaf is also a motor racing addict. When my hometown celebrated it's 600 years, we arranged a street race with historic racing cars, and I had the pleasure (?) to be introduced to our king, who really enjoyed himself in the pits. The dinner afterwards included Sir Stirling Moss, David Piper, Richard Attwood etc.\n\nOf course, I was not invited...\n\nCheers\n\nStefan\n\n(republican)\n\nOriginally posted by Stefan Ornerdal\n\nOf course, I was not invited...\n\nCheers\n\nStefan\n\n(republican)\n\nFelix\n\nStefan,\n\nYour original statement that HRH Prince Bertil of Sweden was a succesful international racing driver in the 30s can be interpreted in many ways. If, for example, he raced during one year in three events, and collected one trophy, shield or whatever, he could be considered a successful racing driver. And the writer of that statement would not be lying. The very vague statement does not say that he was a winning driver in a single seater. He might have raced sports cars of which I know very little. But in Germany alone they had little events almost every weekend from spring to fall.\n\nCan you figure out how many international licences were issued by your Club at that time? Or maybe he had a good connection to England and they organized a British license for him and he did some races in Brooklands. They staged a multitude of little races there.\n\nSome references about Bertil of Sweden.\n\nA picture with Parnell, Abecassis and Leslie Brooke, Rommehed 1947, in G. Gould, Reg Parnell, page 103,\n\nA description of postwar high life and connections with racing, in Princess Birabongse, The Prince and I, pages 164/176\n\nIn connection with the Gordini Team at the Stockholm race in 1948, in Huet, Gordini, un sorcier, une equipe, page 115 [see also the appropriate Sheldon volume]\n\nStefan,\n\nI have often wondered the same thing.\n\nThe only thing I have ever found of him from the pre-war era is a picture of him at Brooklands together with Cobb, Howe, Eccles and Straight sometimes in the 30's in Rivers Fletcher's \"Mostly Motor Racing\" page 191.\n\nI knew of Prince Bertil's love of racing, but it was only after his death that I saw reference to his actual participation. Like Stefan, I would like to know if it really happened. I have many records of some very obscure pre-war races (and hillclimbs), and have never seen any reference to this M Adrian. Any claim that he was \"a successful international racing driver\" is patently an exaggeration.\n\nPerhaps, as often happens with the non-specialist press, they meant rallying? Did he perhaps contest a Monte Carlo Rally or twp?\n\nHi guys,\n\nI have sent mails to the Swedish Federation, the Swedish Royal Automobile Club and the Racing History Club. Hopefully, they could shed a little light on Prince Bertil's racing career.\n\nStefan\n\nI decided to do some research at the library and found the following in a book about the prince (Prins Bertil - ett liv by Fabian af Petersens):\n\nIt was during the years in Paris in the mid 30s that Bertil managed to get his own Bugatti. He managed to find a used 200 hp (sic)\n\nBugatti (in fact a 100 bhp T35) for a bargain 10000 francs. He took the car into a garage, put it into pieces, cleaned and oiled all parts and and reassembled it.\n\n(...)\n\nlater he received a letter from the marshal of the court were it read that Bertil'd father was \"surprised\" over the purchaise, but there was never any action taken by the court against the car.\n\n(...)\n\nIn that car the prince took part in a number of competitions in France, racing under the name \"Monsieur Adrian\". But Bertil wasn't really satisfied with the Bugatti. Regardless of the repairs it had seen its best days. By accident Bertil met Ettore Bugatti's son Jean at an nightclub and told him about his problems.\n\nI\"'ll fix that!\" promised Jean Bugatti.\n\nSoon afterwards Bertil received a brand new T51 from the factory and now the competing took speed. Bertil took part in a number of races and according to himself finished second in an international event at Montlhéry in 1937. Then the writing in the papers abot M. Adrian were tok such speed that he found it necessary to stop racing.\n\n(...)\n\nThere are sceptics who say that Bertil wasn't much of a star as a racer and that M. Adrian's triumps have been exaggerted\n\nby the Swedish press.\n\n(...)\n\nThere are people interested in motor history who have checked the international specialinst litterature from that era without ever finding any references or pictures of M. Adrian. Their conclution is that Beril muxt have started mostly in minor club events.\n\n(...)\n\nIn1947 Bertil recieved an invitation from David Brown to take part in Le Mans 24 h for Aston Martin, an invitation he had to decline.\n\n(Sorry for my bad translation)\n\nThere was only one international meeting at Montlhéry in 1937, the French Grand Prix (for sportscars), and HRH was not among the “podium” finishers in that event. Nor was he in the first three in any of the various engine-capacity classes.\n\nIt would be stretching the point to class the other meetings at the circuit in 1937 as international. The first was the Bol d’Or, won by Rogoulot from Giraud-Cabantous and Maillard-Brune, with Horvilleur taking the 1100 class and Vialle the 750.\n\nThe Coupe d’Automne on 16 September resulted in Lebègue winning from Paul. Class winners were Roumani (3000), Villenueve (1500), Hertzberger (1100) and Herkuleyns (750).\n\nThe Coupe de Vitesse for sportscars was held at the same meeting, and won by Chaboud (or Lebègue). Class winners were Gérard (3000), Debille (2000), Forestier (1500), Gordini (1100) and Buffy (750).\n\nIt is possible that “M Adrian” gained a minor placing in one of these events."
