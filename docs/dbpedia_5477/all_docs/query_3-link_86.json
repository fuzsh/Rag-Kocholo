        "text": "King Gustaf VI's Children\n\nThe royal crown couple, Gustaf and Margaret, had five children, four boys and a girl. A sixth child dies in child birth along with Princess Margaret. Their oldest child, Gustav Adolf, was the crown prince and Duke of Västerbotten. Tragically he never became king. He died in 1947 as a result of an airplane accident in Denmark before his father assumed the throne. The future King Gustav VI's grandson Carl Gustaf, the son of Gustav Adolf, became crown prince after his father's death in 1947. In 1965 the Riksdag raised to 25 the age at which a king could begin his rule, and in 1971 it enacted legislation, effective at Gustav's death in 1973, stripping the monarchy of its most important political functions. The crown prince acceded to the largely ceremonial throne as Carl XVI Gustaf. HBRC has little information on Prince Sigvard. He was made Count of Wisborg. Swedish Princess I Ingrid Victoria Sofia Louise Margareta was born (1910). She was the third child and only daughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf and his first wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught. She was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Ingrid's mother died in 1920 while pregnant with her sixth child. King Gustaf married Lady Louise Mountbatten (1923). Louise was a Ingrid's cousin. Ingrid met the British Prince of Wales (1928). There were rumors about a romance, but nothing developed. It was Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark who courted Ingrid. They married (1935). They were related through different family lines. The Germans during World War II invaded and occupied Denmark (1940). She gained great respect with her husband passively resisting the German occupation forces during World War II. Princess Ingrid became the Queen of Denmark when her husband assended to the Danish throne as Frederick IX (1947). Queen Ingrid died (2000). She was interred next to her husband outside Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen. HBRC has little information on Prince Bertil, but some available images show how he was dressed as a boy. Carl became Count of Wisborg on the death of his older brother. The children were close in age and grew up together. With four boys, they were a rambunctious lot and Princess Ingrid was right in the middle.\n\nGustav Adolf (1906-1947)\n\nGustav Adolf was born in 1906, the eldest son of future King Gustav VI and Princess Margaret Victoria Wettin (1882-1920). Her father was Queen Victoria's son Prince Arthur (1850- ), Duke of Connaught and Strathern who married Princess Louise Margret of Prussia and was known as the Duchess of Clarence. He married Princess Sibylla (Sibylla Calma Marie Alice Wettin) of Saxe-Coburg Gotha. They were married in Coburg in 1932. They had five children: Margaretha Dérirée (1934- ), Birgitta Ingeborg (1937- ), Désirée Elizabeth (1938- ), Christina Louise Helen (1943- ), and Carl Gustav (1946- ). Gustav Adolf died in 1947 in a tragic airplane crash before his father assumed the throne. His son Carl Gustaf inherited the throne when his grandfather died in 1973. In 1965 the Riksdag raised to 25 the age at which a king could begin his rule, and in 1971 it enacted legislation, effective at Gustav's death in 1973, stripping the monarchy of its most important political functions. The crown prince acceded to the largely ceremonial throne as Carl XVI Gustaf.\n\nSigvard Oscar Fredrik (1907- )\n\nHBRC has little information on Prince Sigvard. He was made Count of Wisborg.\n\nIngrid Victoria (1910-2000)\n\nSwedish Princess I Ingrid Victoria Sofia Louise Margareta was born (1910). She was the third child and only daughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf and his first wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught. She was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Ingrid's mother died in 1920 while pregnant with her sixth child. King Gustaf married Lady Louise Mountbatten (1923). Louise was a Ingrid's cousin. Ingrid met the British Prince of Wales (1928). There were rumors about a romance, but nothing developed. It was Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark who courted Ingrid. They married (1935). They were related through different family lines. The Germans during World War II invaded and occupied Denmark (1940). She gained great respect with her husband passively resisting the German occupation forces during World War II. Princess Ingrid became the Queen of Denmark when her husband assended to the Danish throne as Frederick IX (1947). Queen Ingrid died (2000). She was interred next to her husband outside Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen.\n\nBertil Gustaf Oscar (1912-97)\n\nBertil Gustaf Oscar was born in 1912. He was the fourth child of future King Gustav VI. HBRC is unable at this time to find much information about the prince, but some available information provides information about the his childhood clothing. The Swedish princes were fairly close in age. The clothes Prince Beril worn are probably similar to those worn by his older brothers when they were Bertil's age\n\nCarl Johan Arthur (1916-2012)\n\nCarl Johan Arthur Bernadotte was the fourth son and fifth and youngest child of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden and his first wife Princess Margaret of Connaught. He was born a Prince of Sweden (1916). He was granted the title of Duke of Dalarna, but renounced these titles to marry a commoner. Hehad extebsive royal realtions. He was a paternal uncle of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and a maternal uncle of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece. Carl became Count of Wisborg on the death of his older brother. As a result of his marriage, Bernadotte lost his succession rights to the Swedish throne and renounced his titles (1946). He married the journalist Elin Kerstin Margaretha Wijkmark (1910  87). She was the daughter of Henning Wijkmark and Elin Larsson. They married in New York City. The mrraige was unconstitutional as Wijkmark was 'enskild mans dotter' (daughter of a common man). So it could not be approved by the Swedish government. Thus he was giving up his Swedish titles and succession rights. He subsequently assumed the surname Bernadotte, the name of the Swedish Royal Family. They did not havev children of their own, but adopted two children. Monica Kristina Margaretha Bernadotte (1948-- ) was adopted (1951). She married Count Johan Peder Bonde af Björnö (1950- ) in (1976). The couple divorced (1997). They had three children. Christian Carl Henning Bernadotte (1949- ) was adopted in (1950). She married Marianne Jenny (1958- ) in (1980). She was the daughter of Jacques Jenny and wife Caroline Yvonne Venter. They had three children. Grand Duchess Charlotte admitted Bernadotte into the Luxembourgois nobility (1951) for himself, his wife and his marital descendants,with the title Count of Wisborg. Hrv was also made Carl Johan Arthur Prince Bernadotte. The Bernadottes lived for several years in New York City. He worked as the representative of the Anglo-Nordic Trading Company. They notavly made friends with famed film star Greta Garbo, who stayed with them in their Swedish home near Båstad. Aftervthevdearhbof his first wife, Bernadotte married Countess Gunnila Märtha Louise (Wachtmeister af Johannishus) Bussler (1923  2016) in Copenhagen (1988). He became the stepfather of her three children from her previous marriage.\n\nHBRC\n\nNavigate the Boys' Historical Clothing Web Site royal pages:\n\n[Return to the Main Gustaf VI page]\n\n[Return to the Main royalty page]\n\n[Austria] [Belgium] [Denmark] [France] [Germany] [Italy] [Italy] [Luxemburg] [Monaco] [Netherlands] [Norway] [Romania] [Russia] [Spain] [Sweden] [United Kingdom] [Yugoslavia]\n\nCreated: 4:24 AM 1/27/2015\n\nLast updated: 1:41 AM 4/21/2020"
