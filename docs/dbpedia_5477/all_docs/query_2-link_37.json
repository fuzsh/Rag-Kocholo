She and King Carl XVI Gustaf met in 1972, a year before the old king died, so he must have heard about her, even though the relationship was kept a secret in the beginning. Obviously, he didn't care much for letting non-royals inte the family, but has anyone actually seen or heard about a comment or remark he made?\n\nHans-Rickard\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 4, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n2,312\n\nCity\n\nStockholm\n\nCountry\n\nSweden\n\nI don´t think it is known if he knew about it or not. I saw an interview many years ago with our current king where he said his grandfather wasn´t against that the prince´s had relationships with non royals. It was marry them he was against. He admonished his grandson many times to handle his relationships more discreetly Apparently it was only for the princes he was against non royal marriages as he accepted Princess Margareta, Desiree and Christinas marriages to their non royal husbands. He died before Christinas wedding but Christina has said that he knew about it and wasn´t against it.\n\nFurienna\n\nSerene Highness\n\nJoined\n\nMar 29, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n1,438\n\nCity\n\nÖrnsköldsvik\n\nCountry\n\nSweden\n\nIt was okay for the princesses to marry non-royal men, because they didn't have a place in the sucession anyway (so the new succession of 1980, where the crown prince suddenly was stripped of his title in favor of his sister, was a really radical change). But I don't see what the problem was with princes marrying non-royal women either. I guess it was a very old tradition, that couldn't be broken until the 1970s.\n\nBaron Brockdorf\n\nCourtier\n\nJoined\n\nDec 18, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n639\n\nCity\n\nManteleina, Rabat\n\nCountry\n\nMalta\n\nACCESSION OF KING GUSTAV VI - British Pathé\n\nhere is a video of his accession to the throne\n\nmaria-olivia\n\nMajesty\n\nJoined\n\nOct 3, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n8,187\n\nCity\n\nBrussels\n\nCountry\n\nBelgium\n\nVery interesting , wonderful pictures of the Grandfather kissing his Heir the actual King.\n\nFurienna\n\nSerene Highness\n\nJoined\n\nMar 29, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n1,438\n\nCity\n\nÖrnsköldsvik\n\nCountry\n\nSweden\n\nInteresting indeed.\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,280\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nGreenwich Welcomes King & Queen Of Sweden (1955)\n\nGreenwich Welcomes King Of Sweden (1955) - YouTube\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,280\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nH.M.King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden at the 1971 State Opening of Parliament\n\n(Apologies no sound)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ_ZYl6wCBI\n\nCyrilVladisla\n\nImperial Majesty\n\nJoined\n\nDec 2, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n12,410\n\nCity\n\nConneaut\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nDid you know that King Gustaf VI Adolf visited England in 1968?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js6uuliozUs\n\nIn 1963 King Gustav VI Adolf visited the Vasa wreck.\n\nhttps://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2s7lhe\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Dec 31, 2016\n\nCountessmeout\n\nImperial Majesty\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n13,075\n\nCity\n\nalberta\n\nCountry\n\nCanada\n\nYes, Philip had a nice reunion with his Aunt Louise, who was the Queen of Sweden at the time (Alice's younger sister).\n\nPopper Track 2015 Pictures | Getty Images\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/398709373241205599/\n\nPopper Track 2015 Pictures | Getty Images\n\nSweden's King Gustaf VI Adolf and Queen Louise stand on deck of...

All areas of interest became subjects to study, whether it was rhododendron, fly fishing, art or crafts. As a student in Uppsala Gustaf Adolf read Sweden's first course in the field of archeology. Interest became permanent, and over the years he initiated several large excavations, obtained funds and participated in excavations - not only in our country but also in Greece, Italy and the Middle East.\n\nThe king was a driving force and made significant efforts for humanities. He was the patron of several institutions, academies and associations..\n\nDue to the anniversary year #Bernadotte200, selected items from the royal collections are displayed in a jubilee showcase in Bernadotte Apartments. Now, Gustaf VI Adolf, Crown Princess Margareta and Queen Louise are noted.\n\nPhotos:\n\n1. Gustaf Adolf in Persepolis, Iran, 1934.\n\n2. Crown Princess Margaret and Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf are planning the wall flowerbed at Sofiero in the summer of 1917.\n\n3. King Gustaf VI Adolf and Queen Louise examine a portfolio of graphic magazines in the Stockholm Castle, 1955.\n\n4. Over the years, Gustaf VI Adolf built a significant collection of Chinese artifacts, and internationally he had a great reputation as a connoisseur. The collection was bequeathed to the East Asian Museum in Stockholm. A vase, from the end of the Ming dynasty, was excluded to remain as memorials.\n\nPhotos from the Bernadotte Library archive (1,2,3).\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BqP7K7tB6NC/\n\nLadyFinn\n\nImperial Majesty\n\nJoined\n\nJun 22, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n36,312\n\nCity\n\nSouthwest\n\nCountry\n\nFinland\n\nKing Gustaf VI Adolf and queen Louise\n\nImage Upper.com - Free Image Hosting - View Image\n\nLadyFinn\n\nImperial Majesty\n\nJoined\n\nJun 22, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n36,312\n\nCity\n\nSouthwest\n\nCountry\n\nFinland\n\nLadyFinn\n\nImperial Majesty\n\nJoined\n\nJun 22, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n36,312\n\nCity\n\nSouthwest\n\nCountry\n\nFinland\n\nGustaf Adolf with his mother-in-law\n\nH.R.H.
