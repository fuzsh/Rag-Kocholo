        "text": "King of Sweden from 1950 to 1973\n\nGustaf VI Adolf (Oscar Fredrik Wilhelm Olaf Gustaf Adolf; 11 November 1882 – 15 September 1973) was King of Sweden from 29 October 1950 until his death in 1973. He was the eldest son of Gustaf V and his wife, Victoria of Baden. Before Gustaf Adolf acceded to the throne, he had been crown prince for nearly 43 years during his father's reign. As king, and shortly before his death, he gave his approval to constitutional changes which removed the Swedish monarchy's last political powers. He was a lifelong amateur archeologist particularly interested in Ancient Italian cultures.\n\nBirth\n\n[edit]\n\nGustaf Adolf was born on 11 November 1882, at Stockholm Palace. At birth he was created Duke of Scania. A patrilineal member of the House of Bernadotte, Gustaf Adolf was also descended from the House of Vasa through maternal lines. Through his mother, he was a descendant of Gustav IV Adolf of the House of Holstein-Gottorp. Gustaf Adolf was the eldest child of Crown Prince Gustaf, later Gustaf V, and Victoria of Baden. He was born during the reign of his paternal grandfather, Oscar II. Through his mother, Gustaf Adolf was a great-grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, who died when Gustaf Adolf was five years old. His maternal grandmother, Princess Louise of Prussia, was the Kaiser's only daughter.\n\nCrown Prince\n\n[edit]\n\nGustaf Adolf became Crown Prince of Sweden on the death of his grandfather, King Oscar II, on 8 December 1907.\n\n1926 trip to United States\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1926, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess Louise visited the United States. They included a trip to San Francisco, where the Crown Prince visited Bohemian Grove to see the Grove Play Truth by poet George Sterling.\n\n1934–35 trip to the Near East\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom September to December 1934, the Crown Prince, Crown Princess Louise, Princess Ingrid and Prince Bertil visited a number of countries in the Near East. The journey began on 13 September from Stockholm. The journey went by rail via Malmö, Berlin and Rome to Messina, where the royals boarded the Swedish Oriental Line motor ship Vasaland, destined for Greece. They stopped at Patras and then the journey continued to Aegion.[1] On 20 September, they arrived in Piraeus, from where the royals took a train to Athens, where they were received by the President of Greece and representatives of government agencies. Furthermore, an excursion was made to Delphi, Nafplio and Delos with the cruiser Hellas. After returning to Athens, Vasaland departed for Thessaloniki on 28 September, where the international fair was visited. On 2 October, they arrived in Istanbul. After the ship dropped anchor, the royals were landed on the Asian side of the strait. The sloop docked at the quay in front of Haydarpaşa railway station. At the platform, President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's caravan waited, in which the journey continued to Ankara. At the station, the guests were received by Atatürk, members of the government and the administration. After his arrival, the Crown Prince visited Atatürk as well as Foreign Minister Tevfik Rüştü Aras. The visit to Ankara lasted from 3 to 5 October. On 5 October, a two-day visit to Bursa was made. The stay in Turkey ended with a four-day incognito break in Istanbul, during which several receptions were held at the Swedish legation.[1]\n\nOn 10 October, the royal travelers continued with Vasaland, which arrived on 12 October in İzmir. From here, the departure took place on 15 October with the president's own train and on 17 October it arrived in Aleppo, after Prince Bertil and a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs joined the party on the way. In Aleppo, the stay was extended to about 14 days, when the Crown Prince contracted a mild intestinal catarrh due to the stressful climate. On 1 November, the journey continued. The Crown Prince Couple, Princess Ingrid and Prince Bertil then boarded a British military plane and arrived in Baghdad on the same day. The King Ghazi of Iraq met at his country retreat Kasr-el-Zuhoor, from where he accompanied his guests to Bilatt Castle. At all the official events that followed, except for King Ghazi of Iraq, his uncle and father-in-law, King Ali of Hejaz, the President of the Council and members of the Cabinet, the President of the Senate and others.[1] On 6 November, the royals left by train for Khanaqin, where cars were ready to take them to Tehran. At the border, they were received by a representative of the Persian government and in Tehran by the Foreign Minister and the Grand Master of the Ceremonies, as well as representatives of government agencies. The Crown Prince's family went in a procession to the castle, where the Shah for the Crown Prince represented the council president and others were present. The Shah then accompanied the Crown Prince to the Golestan Palace. After several days in the Persian capital, he left for Mazandaran Province to study for three days the ongoing construction work for the Trans-Iranian Railway. He then returned to Tehran to say goodbye to the Shah. The Crown Prince's family then left on 17 November in Volvo cars for Isfahan and Persepolis. In the latter place, the royals lived in the so-called Xerxes' harem and visited the city under the leadership of Professor Ernst Herzfeld. On 25 November, the return journey to Baghdad began over the snowy passes along the Kum-Sultanabad-Kermanshah road, a three-day uninterrupted journey by car.[1]\n\nAfter a week-long unofficial stay in Baghdad with visits to modern factories and excursions to Ur and Babylon, the Crown Prince Couple and Princess Ingrid left for Damascus on 5 December by plane. Prince Bertil accompanied the car caravan through the desert, where camel troops paraded at Rutbah station. On 6 December, the President of the Syrian Republic hosted a banquet for the Crown Prince's family, who stayed in Syria for four days. During the return journey to Beirut, Baalbek and the ruins of the old sun city were visited. In Beirut, the royals were received with military honors and were guests of the French government. The High Commissioner of the Levant, with whom the Crown Prince and Crown Princess stayed, hosted a dinner, as did the President of the Lebanese Republic.[1] The Crown Prince also visited the new port facilities in Beirut and visited the offices of the Swedish Oriental Line, Volvo and SKF. Furthermore, the journey went to Jerusalem. The royals arrived on 11 December by car in Palestine and met at the border by the British Commissioner for the Northern District. A two-day break was made in Haifa, where the royals lived in the government building on Mount Carmel. Visits were made on board the Swedish Orient Line's motor ship Hemland. During his stay in Haifa, the Crown Prince laid a wreath at the monument to King Faisal I of Iraq. Excursions were made to Capernaum, Acre, Nazareth and Nablus as well as the modern Jewish cooperative colony of Nahallah. The Crown Prince's family arrived in Jerusalem on 13 December and immediately went to their residence during their stay there, the residence of the British High Commissioner. The program for the following days included a two-day break in Jaffa and Tel Aviv. Visits were made to the offices of Volvo, SKF, ASEA and other Swedish companies.[1] A two-day excursion was made around 20 December to Jericho, the Dead Sea, Transjordan's capital Amman and Petra. The travelers were received by the Emir of Transjordan. After their return to Jerusalem, the royals continued immediately with train to Cairo, where they were guests of the Egyptian government. Due to King Fuad's illness, the Prime Minister hosted the reception banquet at Zafaran Palace on 22 December. The royal guests spent Christmas in stillness, partly in a villa at the foot of the pyramids, partly on the Swedish legation. The Crown Prince and Prince Bertil then visited for a couple of days Alexandria. The Swedish consul Carl Wilhelm von Gerber arranged a reception for the governor, the chief officials, the consuls and the judiciary and the Swedish deputy consul and such for the leading trade representatives.[1]\n\nReign\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 29 October 1950, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf became king a few days before his 68th birthday, upon the death of his father, King Gustaf V. He was at the time the world's oldest heir apparent to a monarchy (this in turn was broken by his grandnephew Charles, Prince of Wales on 2 November 2016). On 30 October he took the regal assurance and was enthroned on queen Christina's Silver Throne. He then delivered his accession speech and adopted Plikten framför allt (\"Duty before all\"), as his personal motto.\n\nDuring Gustaf VI Adolf's reign, work was underway on a new Instrument of Government to replace the 1809 constitution and produce reforms consistent with the times. Among the reforms sought by some Swedes was the replacement of the monarchy or at least some moderation of the old constitution's provision that \"The King alone shall govern the realm.\"\n\nGustaf VI Adolf's personal qualities made him popular among the Swedish people and, in turn, this popularity led to strong public opinion in favour of the retention of the monarchy. Gustaf VI Adolf's expertise and interest in a wide range of fields (architecture and botany being but two) made him respected, as did his informal and modest nature and his purposeful avoidance of pomp. While the monarchy had been de facto subordinate to the Riksdag and ministers since the definitive establishment of parliamentary rule in 1917, the king still nominally retained considerable reserve powers. With few exceptions, though, Gustaf Adolf chose to act on the advice of the ministers.\n\nThe most notable occasion when Gustaf Adolf personally exercised his political power was during the 1957 government crisis that started as a result of a split within the government over pension reform. This split had caused the Center Party to leave government and the King then attempted to form a center-right coalition government. The leader of the Center Party however refused to be part of a right wing government and instead supported a Social Democratic minority government, which the King ended up appointing. His handling of the situation was seen as correct from a parliamentary standpoint.[2]\n\nThe King died in 1973, at the old hospital in Helsingborg, Scania, close to his summer residence, Sofiero Castle, after a deterioration in his health that culminated in pneumonia. He was succeeded on the throne by his 27-year-old grandson Carl XVI Gustaf, son of the late Prince Gustaf Adolf. He died the day before the election of 1973, which is suggested to have swayed it in support of the incumbent Social Democratic government.[3] In a break with tradition, he was not buried in Riddarholmskyrkan in Stockholm, but in the Royal Cemetery in Haga alongside his wives.\n\nNot long before his death, Gustaf Adolf approved a new constitution that stripped the monarchy of its remaining political powers. The new document took effect in 1975, two years after Gustaf Adolf's death, leaving his grandson as a ceremonial figurehead.\n\nPersonal interests\n\n[edit]\n\nThe King's reputation as a \"professional amateur professor\" was widely known; nationally and internationally, and among his relatives. Gustaf VI Adolf was a devoted archaeologist, and was admitted to the British Academy for his work in botany in 1958. Gustaf VI Adolf participated in archaeological expeditions in China, Greece, Korea and Italy, and founded the Swedish Institute in Rome.\n\nGustaf VI Adolf had an enormous private library consisting of 80,000 volumes and – nearly more impressively – he actually had read the main part of the books. He had an interest in specialist literature on Chinese art and East Asian history. Throughout his life, King Gustaf VI Adolf was particularly interested in the history of civilization, and he participated in several archaeological expeditions. His other great area of interest was botany, concentrating in flowers and gardening. He was considered an expert on the Rhododendron flower. At Sofiero Castle (the king's summer residence) he created an admired Rhododendron collection.\n\nLike his sons Prince Gustaf Adolf and Prince Bertil, Gustaf VI Adolf maintained wide, lifelong interests in sports. He enjoyed tennis and golf, and fly fishing for charity. He was president of the Swedish Olympic Committee and the Swedish Sports Confederation from their foundations and until 1933, and these positions were then taken over by his sons in succession, Gustaf Adolf until 1947 and then Bertil until 1997.\n\nAccording to all six books of memoires by his sons Sigvard[4] and Carl Johan,[5] nephew Lennart[6] and of wives of the two sons,[7] Gustaf Adolf from the 1930s on took a great and abiding interest in removing their royal titles and privileges (because of marriages that were unconstitutional at the time), persuaded his father Gustaf V to do so and to have the Royal Court call the three family members only Mr. Bernadotte.\n\nFamily and issue\n\n[edit]\n\nGustaf Adolf married Princess Margaret of Connaught on 15 June 1905 in St. George's Chapel, at Windsor Castle. Princess Margaret was the daughter of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, third son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of the United Kingdom. Gustaf Adolf and Margaret had five children:\n\nName Birth Death Notes Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten 22 April 1906 26 January 1947(1947-01-26) (aged 40) Died in a plane crash at Copenhagen Airport; father of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden Prince Sigvard, Duke of Uppland 7 June 1907 4 February 2002(2002-02-04) (aged 94) later Prince Sigvard Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg Queen Ingrid 28 March 1910 7 November 2000(2000-11-07) (aged 90) Queen of Denmark; grandmother of King Frederik X of Denmark Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland 28 February 1912 5 January 1997(1997-01-05) (aged 84) Prince Carl Johan, Duke of Dalarna 31 October 1916 5 May 2012(2012-05-05) (aged 95) later Prince Carl Johan Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg\n\nCrown Princess Margaret died suddenly on 1 May 1920 with her cause of death given as an infection following surgery. At the time, she was eight months pregnant and expecting their sixth child.\n\nGustaf Adolf married Lady Louise Mountbatten, formerly Princess Louise of Battenberg, on 3 November 1923 at St. James's Palace with a celebration at Kensington Palace.[8] She was the sister of Lord Mountbatten and aunt of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and a niece of Empress Alexandra of Russia. She was also a first cousin once removed of her husband’s first wife both being descendants of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. It was Lady Louise who became Queen of Sweden. Both Queen Louise and her stepchildren were great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, Crown Princess Margaret having been a first cousin of Queen Louise's mother, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine.\n\nHis second marriage produced only one stillborn daughter on 30 May 1925.\n\nWhile his first wife visited her native Britain in the early years of their marriage, it was widely rumored in Sweden that Gustaf Adolf had an affair there with operetta star Rosa Grünberg.[9] Swedish vocalist Carl E. Olivebring (1919–2002) in a press interview claimed to be an extramarital son of Gustaf VI Adolf, a claim taken seriously by the king's biographer Kjell Fridh (1944–1998).[10]\n\nVia his son Gustaf Adolf and his daughter Ingrid, respectively, King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden was the grandfather of his direct successor King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark (who is herself the mother of the current King Frederik X of Denmark).\n\nBy his second marriage, Gustaf Adolf was an uncle to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nSwedish\n\n[edit]\n\nCountry Date Appointment Sweden[11] 11 November 1882 – 19 October 1950 Knight with Collar Royal Order of the Seraphim 11 November 1882 – 19 October 1950 Commander Grand Cross Order of the Sword 11 November 1882 – 19 October 1950 Commander Grand Cross Order of the Polar Star 1 June 1912 – 19 October 1950 Commander Grand Cross Order of Vasa 11 November 1882 – 19 October 1950 Knight with Collar Order of Charles XIII 18 September 1897 King Oscar II's Jubilee Commemorative Medal 20 September 1906 Crown Prince Gustaf's and Crown Princess Victoria's Silver Wedding Medal 6 June 1907 King Oscar II and Queen Sofia's Golden Wedding Medal 16 June 1928 King Gustaf V's Jubilee Commemorative Medal 16 June 1948 King Gustaf V's Jubilee Commemorative Medal\n\nQuasi-Official Orders\n\nHigh Protector (and Honorary Knight) of the Order of St John in Sweden\n\nThe Medal Illis quorum meruere labores of the 18th size, 1939[12]\n\nGustav V medal for the 300th Anniversary of the New Sweden Settlement, 1938[12]\n\nSt. Eric's Medal [sv], 1938[12]\n\nSociety for the Promotion of Ski Sport and Open Air Life Royal Jubilee Medal (Skid- och friluftsfrämjandets kungliga jubileumsmedalj), 1967[12]\n\nSwedish Association of Conscript Non-Commissioned Officers Medal of Merit in gold (Värnpliktiga underofficerares riksförbunds förtjänstmedalj i guld)[12]\n\nLunds Studentsångförening's badge of honour[12]\n\nForeign\n\n[edit]\n\nHonorary degrees\n\nDoctor of Philosophy, Lund University (1918)[27]\n\nDoctor of Laws, Yale University (15 June 1926)[28]\n\nDoctor of Laws, University of Chicago (25 June 1926)[29]\n\nDoctor of Laws, Princeton University (1926)[30]\n\nDoctor of Science, Clark University (1926)[31]\n\nDoctor of Laws, Cambridge University (4 June 1929)[32]\n\nDoctor of Laws, University of Dorpat (1932)[33]\n\nDoctor of Philosophy, Chernivtsi University (1937)[33]\n\nDoctor of Laws, Lafayette College (6 July 1938)[34]\n\nLegum Doctor, Harvard University (11 July 1938)[35]\n\nLegum Doctor, University of Pennsylvania (1938)[36]\n\nDoctor of Technology, KTH Royal Institute of Technology (1944)[37]\n\nDoctor of Philosophy, University of Helsinki (1952)[33]\n\nHonorary Doctorate, Oxford University (19 May 1955)[33]\n\nJubilee doctor honoris causa, Lund University (1968)[27]\n\nMilitary ranks\n\n[edit]\n\n1902: Underlöjtnant[38]\n\n1903: Lieutenant[39]\n\n1909: Captain[40]\n\n1913: Major[40]\n\n1916: Lieutenant colonel[40]\n\n1918: Colonel[40]\n\n1928: Lieutenant general[40]\n\n1932: General[41]\n\nHonorary military ranks\n\n[edit]\n\nAdmiral (Royal Navy) 1 May 1951[42]\n\nColonel-in-Chief, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) 10 August 1956[43]\n\nAir Chief Marshal (Royal Air Force) 15 September 1959[44]\n\nGeneral (Royal Danish Air Force) 1952[45][12]\n\nOther Honors\n\n[edit]\n\nCaxton Club, Chicago Honorary Member 1952-1973[46]\n\nIn 1938 he was elected an honorary member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati\n\nArms and monogram\n\n[edit]\n\nUpon his creation as Duke of Skåne, Gustaf Adolf was granted a coat of arms with the arms of Skåne in base.
