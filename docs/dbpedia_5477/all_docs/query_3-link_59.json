        "text": "It is the first time that President López Obrador receives members of a monarchy.\n\nThe presence of the monarchs in Mexico at this time appears to be very symptomatic, because Sweden has just joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as a member.\n\nMonarchs do not have political or administrative functions, but rather symbolic and representative ones. Even so, their visit has attracted the attention of national and international media due to various controversies that the monarchs’ marriage has sparked, although more of a palatial and soap opera nature than political ones.\n\nCarl XVI Gustaf was crowned in 1973 after the death of his grandfather, King Gustaf VI Adolf, because his father had died earlier in a plane accident during a flight to Denmark.\n\nThe Queen’s place remained empty for a few years until 1979, when he married a woman of non-royal origin, nor related to the monarchy, named Silvia Renate Sommerlath, who was born in Heidelberg, Germany.\n\nThey have three children and several grandchildren, and almost all of them are princes, including sons-in-law and daughters-in-law.\n\njg/jav/mem/lma"
