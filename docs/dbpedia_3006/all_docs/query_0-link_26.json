AI is a machine’s ability to perceive its environment and use that information to maximise its chance at succeeding at some goal. All of the technologies behind artificial intelligence are evolving at exponential rates and are just now beginning to rocket up the curve.

My core scientific interest are intelligent machines, that are able to autonomously learn new things from scratch. I’m in particular interested in neural networks – a sort of mathematical model of the brain – and their ability to store and generalize information. This fascination goes back to my master thesis about supervised learning algorithms (‘Rprop’, 1992).\n\nI have always been working at the boundary of new machine learning methods and their application to novel challenges: neural forecasting systems for financial trading and sales rate prediction (‘George’, 1994; ‘Bild-Zeitung’, 1998 – 2008), self-learning agents that control self-driving cars (at Stanford, 2006) or reading thoughts and even controlling brain activity (‘BrainLinks BrainTools’, 2011 – 2019). Brainstormers, our robotic soccer team, was a 5 times winner of the RoboCup World Championship and one of the first teams to use reinforcement learning (RL) as their core method (1998 – 2008). The data-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms Neural Fitted Q Iteration (NFQ, 2005; NFQCA, 2011) and Deep Fitted Q (DFQ, 2010) laid the ground for many methods in current Artificial Intelligence (AI) research.\n\nI have followed my interests in various roles: as a game programmer and author for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum (1981-1986), a computer science professor at the universities of Dortmund, Osnabrück and Freiburg (2002-2015), a Co-Founder of one of the first startups in modern AI (Cognit – Lab for learning machines, 2010-2015). In 2015, I joined DeepMind as a research scientist and team lead of the Controls Team.\n\nAt the heart every successful business are people, their skills, dreams and ambitions, to make things better.

Prior to NYU, she worked at Google for over a decade, where she led product and engineering teams, founded Google’s Open Research Group, and co-founded M-Lab, a globally distributed network measurement platform that now provides the world’s largest source of open data on internet performance. She also worked extensively on issues of privacy and security, helping provide funding, strategy, and support for efforts dedicated to providing privacy from governments and large tech corporations. As a long-time tech worker, she also helped lead labor organizing at Google. She was one of the core organizers pushing back against Google’s military contracts, the company’s insufficient response to concerns about AI and its harms, and was a central organizer of the Google Walkout. She continues to work in solidarity with organizers in tech, driven by the belief that worker power and collective action are necessary to ensure meaningful tech accountability, especially in the context of concentrated industrial power. She has advised the White House, the FCC, the City of New York, the European Parliament, and many other governments and civil society organizations on artificial intelligence, internet policy, measurement, privacy, and security.\n\nTimnit is currently a research scientist at Google in the ethical AI team. Prior to that Timnit did a postdoc at Microsoft Research, New York City in the FATE (Fairness Transparency Accountability and Ethics in AI) group, where she studied algorithmic bias and the ethical implications underlying any data mining project (see this New York Times article for an example of my work).

She holds a Ph.D. in Education from the University of Chicago, a Masters degree in Education from Pennsylvania State University, and a BA from the University of Botswana and Swaziland. Her professional career includes: 11 years university professorship; 10 years at the World Bank; and 10 years in the United Nations. Her extensive experience includes: advisory and consultancy services to governments, regional economic communities, regional research networks, ministries of education, bilateral and multilateral agencies; management of international research capacity development networks and global inter-agency groups on diverse themes on global education and on early childhood care and development; membership in boards of diverse intellectual and technical groups; editor in chief of one of the world’s most prestigious journal of education: PROSPECTS; as well as founder and editor in chief of one of the most prestigious education and learning magazines: IBE INFOCUS.\n\nIn recent years, she gained eminence as a global thought leader on futures education and learning; the future of education and work; and future competences all global citizens require to thrive in rapidly changing 21st century work and life contexts. She is an avid advocate for advancing the engagement of the public and private sectors, especially in technology and the sciences, in shaping the future of education and learning, and in shaping the future through education and learning. She continues to lead global intellectual dialogue on ensuring that education and learning systems attain and sustain: credible scientific underpinnings; future development-relevance; agility to adapt; equitable quality; resource efficiency; technology-savvy; and sustainability. She strongly holds that these parameters of education and learning systems are an inescapable foundation for broad-based and future-forward human resources development, and for the long-term human capital accumulation required to assure every global citizen holistic development, equity of opportunities, and ultimately, fulfillment.\n\nProfessor Marope calls for stronger private sector and foundation engagement in the transformation of education and learning systems into life-long-learning systems in their own right before they can be counted on to develop effective life-long-learners with agility to adapt and the resultant resilience for unpredictable futures. She holds that such transformation demands: 21st century education and learning systems to have capacity for better use of science, emerging technologies to address persisting challenges, and of big data to guide and even predict their futures; rigorous systemic diagnostics; research; foresight; and constant self-renewal. The transformation also demands normative and operational tools; financial, technical and political capital; as well as enabling institutional landscapes that currently do not exist.\n\nProfessor Marope works relentlessly to develop normative and operational tools as well to garner the political, financial and technical capital required to attain and sustain future-forward education and learning systems. In future, she seeks to intensify engagement with the private sector, and foundations in convening and mobilizing global talent and intellectual pool; as well as the political, technical, technological, moral, ethical, and financial capital required to create institutions that can enable future transformation of education and learning systems, as well as the world of work that can genuinely serve all.\n\nThroughout her career, Professor Marope has built extensive experience at all levels and types of education, learning, and training systems. She is also highly experienced in the knowledge creation, brokerage and management required to underpin system transformation. Her publications cover a wide range of areas including: global norms and standard setting tools; system diagnostic tools; system prototypes; all sub-sectors of education, learning, and training systems; future global competences; education and development; capacity development; and award winning Setswana novels.\n\nDame Wendy Hall, DBE, FRS, FREng is Regius Professor of Co"
