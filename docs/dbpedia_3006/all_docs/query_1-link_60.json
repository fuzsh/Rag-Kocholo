        "text": "I happen to have read only now Jeremy Bernstein‘s review of Emilio Segrè’s autobiography, published by his wife in 1993. (Exact bibliography below).\n\nI am baffled.\n\nSays Bernstein: “Much of the last part of Segrè’s book concerns his complex and often hostile relationships with other scientists, including Lawrence, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the chemist Glen Seaborg”\n\nThis is untrue and strangely biased. The three individuals quoted by Bernstein are exceptions. Segrè talks about dozens of colleagues with whom he had friendly and professionally fulfilling relationships, often for life, including Enrico Fermi, Edoardo Amaldi, Franco Rasetti, Cornelius Bakker, Felix Bloch, Carl Helmholz, Hans Bethe, Rudolf Peierls, George Placzek, Otto Hahn, Carlo Perrier, Lorenzo Emo, Ginetta Barresi, Gian Carlo Wick, Ugo Fano, Clyde Wiegand.\n\nJust a few colleagues left signs on Segrè that were not only positive. One is Glen Seaborg:\n\nSeaborg […] had iron discipline, a lively and highly systematic mind, immense persistence, exceptional endurance for work, and a sincere, open-minded interest in science. He was a superb organizer but was not too strong in physics or instrumentation. At the beginning of our collaboration, I probably remembered my much earlier experience with Bakker at Zeeman’s laboratory in Holland, when I, a newcomer, and he, the local boy, greatly helped each other and became steadfast friends. Little did I recognize Seaborg’s unbridled ambition and his unshakable determination to succeed and to be preeminent.\n\n[…] What was unusual in Seaborg was the long-term planning he diligently applied to everything. In 1941 he would say: in 1946 I shall be a dean; in 1948, chancellor of the University of California; in 1955, senator for California, and so on, and he never lost sight of his aims. In 1938 he always dressed in a blue suit, with a tie, differently from his colleagues, because he thought that these clothes would help him become a full professor, a small first step in the grand design.\n\nBernstein says that In Palermo “Segrè made the one important discovery that was basically his own“. He means that of technetium, the first artificially produced chemical element in history (although it was later proved that it also exists in nature).\n\nSurprisingly, here Bernstein seems eluded by the awareness that, from nuclear physics onward, very few discoveries, if any, were made by one person on their own, and most notably in experimental physics. In that of technetium (of which Fermi said it was the best piece of work in physics of the year), Segrè had the greater part but always cited Carlo Perrier as the co-author.\n\nFurthermore, Bernstein himself dwells on Segrè’s suspicions about some Seaborg’s appropriations, which for example caused Segrè’s disappointment when the 1951 Nobel on the “discovery in the chemistry of transuranic elements” went only to Seaborg and McMillan (Segrè had collaborated with Seaborg and experimented on transuranics with Fermi as early as in 1934).\n\nOn the contrary, Segrè never attributed only to himself neither the discoveries concerning plutonium and its properties nor the confirmation of the antiproton, and he always quoted his teams in alphabetical order: see for example his Nobel Biography (these are always self-written).\n\nNoting Segrè’s and Oppenheimer’s lack of reciprocal unbound admiration, Bernstein contends that Segrè’s name will be but a footnote in the history of physics, while Oppenheimer is “one of the greatest teachers of physics who ever lived, as well as a first-rate physicist”.\n\nThis comparison seems odd to me. As a reader of both Segrè’s autobiography and Monk’s biography of Oppenheimer’s, I have the impression that the two men did not go too well together for reasons purely epidermic and personal, not professional or scientific.\n\nFor example, in their early years at Berkeley, Oppenheimer thought that Segrè was a fascist, and Segrè despised Oppie’s communist ‘faith’. Furthermore, Segrè is one of those who found Oppenheimer to be often showing off his culture, which did not appear to Segrè as being the portent sometimes described. Let’s recall that Segrè too came from a well-to-do family who educated him at the highest standards: he was taught English, German and French as a toddler, went to the austere ‘Mamiani’ ginnasio-liceo in Rome, and at the university was picked as his first-ever pupil by Fermi (a man who will tutor an exceptional number of extremely talented scientists including 8 Nobels).\n\nAs the Berkeley obituary reads: “[…] Segrè is also remembered as a man of unusual literary erudition and culture, sharp wit, artistic intelligence, and broad outlook on life. […] In addition, Segrè had the endowment of a historian: an excellent memory, a good knowledge of general history, and a familiarity with literature, classical and modern, in several languages.”\n\nSegrè writes in A Mind Always in Motion, pages 138-139: “Oppenheimer and his group did not inspire in me the awe that they perhaps expected. I had the impression that their celebrated general culture was not superior to that expected in a boy who had attended a good European high school. I was already acquainted with most of their cultural discoveries, and I found Oppenheimer’s ostentation slightly ridiculous. In physics I was used to Fermi, who had a quite different solidity, coupled with a simplicity that contrasted with Oppenheimer’s erudite complexities. Probably I did not sufficiently conceal my lack of supine admiration for Oppenheimer, and I found him unfriendly, even if covertly, for a good part of my career, except when he wanted me to join his team al Los Alamos.”\n\nOn the occasion of that call to Los Alamos, at the Oppenheimers’ for dinner, Emilio finds Oppie reading Petrarch’s sonnets in Italian: “He fed us chicken livers and wild rice, which were excellent; we had never before savored wild rice. Concerning Petrarch’s sonnets, I am afraid I did not hide my suspicion that he did not understand them.”\n\n(Freeman Dyson, who had been invited for life by Oppenheimer to the Institute fir Advanced Study, echoed Segrè in this interview (at minute 1), when he said that in Princeton Oppie “liked to come to the seminars and show off how much he knew about things that he didn’t really know”).\n\nOppenheimer was a great man, out of the ordinary, most remarkable for his noble manners, the lead in the Manhattan Project, and the enormous penalties he had to suffer following it and which he held with great dignity. It appears as he expected from others the admiration he surely deserved. However, not all are so: although a higher-caliber scientist, Fermi was not, and the comparison is inevitable in young Emilio’s mind.\n\nAs to Oppenheimer “one of the greatest teachers of physics who ever lived”, hear Enrico Fermi, undisputedly a superb teacher in all accounts, commenting after one of Oppenheimer’s seminars in Berkeley: “Emilio, I must be getting senile… I went to a learned theoretical seminar and could not understand anything except the last words, which were ‘And this is Fermi’s theory of beta decay'” (A Mind Always in Motion, p. 156).\n\nContinues Bernstein: “To be fair, it must be said that Segrè himself knew that in the end, despite his Nobel prize, he would occupy a modest place among twentieth-century physicists”.\n\nBernstein recalls a conversation Segrè once had with Fermi, and is reported in A Mind Always in Motion: “Emilio, you could take all your work and exchange it for one paper of Dirac’s and you would gain substantially in the trade,” Fermi once said to me. I knew this to be true, of course, but I answered: “I agree, but you could likewise trade yours for one of Einstein’s and come out ahead.” After a short pause, Fermi assented.\n\nFermi and Segrè could talk like that because, recall, Emilio had been the very first pupil chosen by Enrico. And note Emilio writing “I knew this to be true, of course”. So yes, as Bernstein noted, Segrè knew he was no Dirac or Bohr: however this is not the first thing that would come to my mind if I had to comment on his autobiography. And I wonder why it came to Jeremy Bernstein’s mind. It’s just one more of his compelling negative remarks on Segrè.\n\nBernstein omits to add something that he knows very well, i.e. that Segrè was as much a chemist as he was a physicist: and grand theories of everything typically come only from theoretical physicists. Also, loads of Nobels have been given to experimental confirmations: I’d be very surprised if Bernstein considered them all irrelevant, ‘footnotes’.\n\nAnd Segrè’s contributions prior to the antiproton experiment (which lead to the Nobel) had been recognized by many: see, e.g., H. Zuckerman, Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States, Routledge 1977 (pages 167 and 211 of the Transaction Publishers 1996 edition). This was before Bernstein published this article.\n\nIn Emilio’s own words:\n\nThe general thrust of my work, from the very beginning, was to explore various more or less recondite consequences of modern theories, or to measure things thought to be important. My aims were not spectacularly inventive, like those of people who look for unexpected new phenomena, and neither were they based on development of new techniques that made new regions accessible to experimentation, although accelerators, developed by others, were mostly essential to my work. My strong points were a good knowledge of physics and a certain imagination, which enabled me to see things not immediately apparent to everybody. For many years the techniques I used were very simple, almost rudimentary, and I spoke of doing “physics without apparatus.” Later, mostly thanks to Chamberlain and Wiegand, we refined known techniques and applied them with a critical eye, avoiding errors and obtaining results that at the time were the best available.\n\nBernstein on Segrè’s contributions to teamwork: “Segrè writes about the antiproton experiment as if it had been done by somebody else.”\n\nBernstein doesn’t seem to appreciate that all three Segrè’s collaborators on the antiproton experiment worked for him at Berkeley. They had been his students or assistants (Chamberlain served as student under Segrè in Los Alamos and then got his PhD with Fermi in Chicago) and were 10-23 years his juniors.\n\nBerkeley Lab’s Research News wrote on July 5, 1996 in Wiegand’s obituary: “Segre and Chamberlain won the 1959 Nobel prize in physics for the discovery of the antiproton. Inexplicably, Wiegand did not share in the award, though Segre and Chamberlain always acknowledged his critical contributions to the success of the experiment.” Indeed, in their 1959 Nobel Lectures, both Chamberlain and Segrè had highlighted the importance of Wiegand’s contribution (bigger than Ypsilantis’, judging from their syntax).\n\nBernstein admits that he knows of “only one example of a scientist who won a Nobel prize and apologized, in writing, to a collaborator who was left out.” Indeed, only one case is known, to both Bernstein and me, of someone who felt apologetic because others had been left out: Heisenberg with Born and Jordan. I am not an expert on that story and the only thing I seem to recall about it is that the Nobel committee reasoned about Nazi involvement instead of just scientific accomplishments. Anyway, we know of only one case of public apologies, despite the many cases of Nobel attributions similar to 1959.\n\nBernstein wishes “that Segrè had been able to do the same” as Heisenberg. I wonder if he wished the same for all others who won Nobels and, due to the limitation that the award can only be granted to a maximum of three individuals, did not apologize with collaborators. (And, in his Nobel Lecture, Heisenberg does not praise Born and Jordan as much as Segrè and Chamberlain do with Wiegand.)\n\nIn his response to a letter by Segré’s widow Rosa after the article’s publication, Bernstein reveals that what he dislikes of Segrè is the fact that he maneuvered to get the Nobel and in doing so he demonstrated bad taste.\n\nHowever, from the autobiography that Bernstein reviewed, A Mind Always in Motion, it is not possible to derive such an impression, nor does Bernstein provide us with any other clue or source. For example, Segrè did not speak of his Nobel aspirations with the two superstars closest to him, that is Fermi and Lawrence, two laureates regularly interpellated by the Nobel committee. Only to this latter Segrè kind of indirectly mentioned the subject, via Seaborg’s intercession:\n\nAt the beginning of 1957, Seaborg told me that he thought Lawrence’s nomination would be indispensable for the awarding of the Nobel Prize to anyone working in the Rad Lab. I said that I would not speak to Lawrence on this subject, but that if he, Seaborg, would do it, I would be grateful. A few weeks later, Lawrence’s secretary, without a word, showed me, on Lawrence’s orders, a letter from Stockholm acknowledging receipt of my nomination by Lawrence. No word on the subject passed between us.\n\nIn A Mind Always in Motion, the autobiography subject of Bernstein’s review, there are no other signs of maneuvers, schemes or negotiations of sort concerning the Nobel Prize, except perhaps the following exchange with former colleague Georg von Hevesy, which to me has the form of an innocent chat between two old buddies:\n\nDuring the summer of 1954, I met Hevesy in Brazil. We were friends and I could speak freely to him. Thanks to his Swedish connections, he knew many of the secrets of the Nobel Committee, and he told me that I had not been specifically nominated in the year 1951 [the year of Seaborg and McMillan, red.], which had automatically eliminated me. He advised me to try to interest Fermi. I did not do so because I knew perfectly well that Fermi could not be influenced in matters such as competitions and awards.\n\nHowever, a few years later, after Fermi’s death, his widow, Laura, asked me to look at her husband’s papers before she gave them to the Regenstein Library at the University of Chicago. In so doing, I found out, to my surprise, that both Fermi and James Franck had proposed me repeatedly for the Nobel Prize in chemistry. I saw also that Fermi had proposed, in physics, Maria Mayer, Hans Jensen, and Wolfgang Panofsky.\n\nHis spontaneous proposal deeply moved me, for the same reasons that had prevented me from asking for his support. Nomination by him was, for me, almost as important as getting the prize. Much later I had the opportunity to tell Mayer, Jensen, and Panofsky that they had been nominated by Fermi, and all three had the same reaction. Of them, Mayer and Jensen had had the prize. Panofsky had not.\n\nPerhaps most revealing of Segre’s real attitude toward discussions of how to get the Nobel is the premise to the recount of his conversation with Georg von Hevesy: “We were friends and I could speak freely to him”. It tells us that Segrè was very restraint about initiating such talks with people on that subject.\n\nFrom myriad such details in his autobiography, we deduce Emilio’s modesty, intellectual honesty, and openness.\n\nHe tells us when a family friend influenced a teacher and helped him pass the written Greek exam at the end of high school; when Fermi told him that his all work in physics was hardly a match for one Dirac’s paper; or of the arguments over inheritance with his brothers. He balances the less than flattering remarks on people like Lawrence or Seaborg by highlighting their superior scientific and personal qualities. He tells us about the antiproton experiment as if the protagonists were only Chamberlain, Wiegand, and Ypsilantis, his coauthors in alphabetical order, omitting to narrate what I imagine was the likely background, i.e. that he was providing guidelines and suggestions.\n\nThis unassuming depiction is, in my opinion, what leads Bernstein to comment that “Segrè writes about the antiproton experiment as if it had been done by somebody else”. Jeremy Bernstein may not know that self-confidence, self-celebration, and eulogy of oneself are traits not as common in the European character as they are in the US. Mainly as a result of education, an American is definitely more likely than an Italian to exalt in their autobiography the accomplishments and personal qualities. All you have to do to verify this is read a statistical sample of CVs. Or, to name a Segrè’s contemporary and colleague, read Stan Ulam’s autobiography, and you may end up observing, like Bernstein does with Segrè, that “he speaks like someone else achieved all that, not himself”.\n\nSo Bernstein seems mad at Segrè. How could it be?\n\nJeremy Bernstein is a fine physicist in addition to an experienced and first-class popular-science writer. I am but his reader: but why should I struggle to understand how he judges Segrè so negatively? All he gives me as the clue is the distasteful maneuvers for the Nobel Prize… which however did not take place.\n\nCould it be that Bernstein, a successful and busy author in 1994, used a ghost reader, i.e. did not really read A Mind Always in Motion fully? This would have prevented him from grasping the autobiography’s humble and open tone. Or maybe when he had met Segrè personally long before the autobiography was published, he was hurt or disappointed by something that the latter did or said. There is one paragraph in the New York Review of Books piece that may hint to something like that:\n\n“The discovery of fission in 1935 would have meant that the race to build an atomic bomb might have started well before 1939. The Second World War could have been nuclear from the beginning, or, perhaps, the prospect of nuclear weapons could conceivably have prevented the war. When I suggested these possibilities to Segrè he did not seem much interested. What happened happened, and that was that. […] Historical speculation, however startling, seems to have been of no interest to Segrè.“\n\nIt is famously false that Segrè did not have a taste for historical speculation: see for example his Berkeley’s obituary, or his books and lessons on the history of science. Perhaps Bernstein was irritated or offended because Segrè had not picked up a stimulus he had launched: he might have interpreted that as a sign of underestimation. Could he think that Segrè was not treating him as the good physicist he was? Or is he just blaming Segrè for refusing to play history fiction with him?\n\nWho knows.\n\nIn the Preface of her husband’s posthumous autobiography, which she edited, Rosa Segrè Mines wrote that the title came to her when she asked Owen Chamberlain what was his first recollection of Emilio: “A mind always in motion”, said he. Upon reading the NYRB article, one is left with the uneasy feeling that Jeremy Bernstein either did not read the book or had some hidden personal grudge toward Emilio Segrè.\n\nE.
