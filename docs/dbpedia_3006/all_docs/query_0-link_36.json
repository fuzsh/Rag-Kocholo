In consolidated bioprocessing cellulolythic bacteria are used to degrade the fibrous feedstock and convert it to ethanol. Unlike traditional biofilms, which consist of colonies growing on the surface and into the aqueous phase, cellulosic biofilm form crater like depressions that grow into the surface (a.k.a inverted colony formation). We will present a mathematical model for cellulosic biofilms on the colony scale. The model consists of a quasilinear PDE that is coupled in each point of the domain to an ODE. The PDE comprises two non-linear diffusion effects: porous medium type degenerate diffusion, and super-diffusion. The interplay of both effects is required to describe biofilm formation. We explore the model first numerically and validate it qualitatively against experimental observations. This numerical exploration suggests the existence of stable traveling waves in accordance with some experimental observations, for which we give an existence result (under some conditions on parameters) and a nonexistence result (under other conditions). This has been collaborative work with many people over several years.\n\nBio: Dr. Hermann Eberl is a professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Guelph. He received his PhD from the Technical University of Munich, Germany in 1998.

From 2006 to 2016, Dr. Eberl held a Tier-II Canada Research Chair in Computational Biomathematics. Dr. Eberl’s research is broadly focused on Mathematical Biology and Engineering. His application-driven work focuses on modeling analysis and computer simulation of biological and bio/environmental engineering systems. It involves ordinary or partial differential equations, numerical analysis and scientific computing, and mathematical modelling.\n\nSpeaker:\n\nDr. Denis Ndanguza\n\nDean, School of Science\n\nAssociate Professor, Department of Mathematics\n\nUniversity of Rwanda\n\nTitle: Mathematical Modeling of Methane Gas Extraction from Lake Kivu\n\nAbstract: A mathematical model that describes the process of extracting methane gas from Lake Kivu is developed. The model does not consider the physics of the lake's stratification and the chemistry of the gas and water. The rate of methane gas generation in the resource zone, the rate of methane gas extraction from deep water utilizing a tube through bubbles, and the separation and washing zones are all taken into account in the model. Additionally, the rate of the quantity of methane discharged into the deep layers from the two zones has been considered as well. From the results, the extraction system will be stable when the yearly average extraction of methane gas from Resource Zone is 0.1704 km3/year, 0.1672 km3/year in the separation zone and 0.1464 km3/year in the washing zone. Numerical simulations were carried out and different scenarios regarding the extraction rate were discussed accordingly. In order to comprehend the conversion of gathered gas into electrical power, a separate model with two compartments, namely the production zone and the electricity zone, was developed. Overall, the mathematical model provides a useful tool for understanding and optimizing the extraction of methane gas from Lake Kivu.\n\nBio: Dr. Denis Ndanguza is currently the Dean of the School of Science and a staff member with rank of Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at University of Rwanda, Rwanda – College of Science and Technology where he has served since January, 2006.

A primary tool in OT is the ability to define Wasserstein distances between spaces of measures. Based on its ability to map between probability distributions, OT has featured recently as a modeling framework for describing phenomena involving movement on paths or distances in physical space, such as image processing, computer vision, evolution PDEs, and fluid mechanics.\n\nHere, we compute optimal transport maps and associated Wasserstein metrics to model the monomer-to-oligomer state changes, propensity for aggregation, and comparative conformational shifts of the proteins that populate the vertebrate eye lens. These proteins -- called crystallins -- are a fascinating class of proteins that must maintain high density for their refractive role in vertebrate vision, while also remaining soluble to provide transparency. Indeed, misfolding, oligomerizing, and aggregating crystallins is the primary cause of cataracts, the most important cause of blindness in human populations worldwide. OT, especially in its unbalanced form, is an ideal mathematical framework for modeling the behavior of these proteins in healthy and disease states within the eye.\n\nBio: Dr. Miranda Lynch is an Assistant Investigator at Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, a nonprofit institute in Buffalo, NY focused on protein structural biology. Previously, she held positions at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Institute, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and as faculty at University of Connecticut Health Center. Her multidisciplinary interests led her to complete her Integrated Master's degree at University of Colorado at Denver jointly between Mathematics and Biology, and she then completed her PhD in Statistics at University of Rochester. She went on to post-doctoral work at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, working in modeling of HIV biology. Her current research focuses on how mathematical tools can shed light on complex molecular systems.\n\nSpeaker:\n\nDr. Juan Emmanuel Johnson\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher\n\nCSIC (Spanish National Research Council)\n\nUniversidad Complutense de Madrid\n\nTitle: A Whirlwind Tour of Data Assimilation from a Machine Learning Perspective with Applications to Sea Surface Height Interpolation\n\nAbstract: The ocean is vital to the Earth's system as it plays a significant role in climate regulation regarding carbon and heat uptake. It is also a primary driver of human activities (e.g., maritime traffic and world trade, marine resources and services. However, monitoring the ocean is a critical challenge: the ocean state can only partially be determined because most of the ocean consists of subsurface quantities that we cannot directly observe. Although we can access observable sea surface quantities, they are generally irregularly and extremely sparsely sampled. For instance, satellite-derived SSH data has less than 5\\% coverage of the globe daily.\n\nThe oceanography community has a long history of data assimilation methods like Back-n-Forth Nudging (BFN), optimal interpolation (OI), and 4D Variational Data Assimilation (4DVar) which have great success in filling in the gaps. Despite significant progress, these schemes often need to improve their ability to fully leverage the available observation datasets' which is especially difficult with the inclusion of more and more heterogeneous data sources. There are some recent methods that use modern machine learning tools to leverage these data sources have shown great promise however, they are often presented as revolutionary new methods that depart far away from the \"classical\" data assimilation methods.\n\nIn this talk, we will do a whirlwind tour from a machine learners perspective of the current state of affairs within my research community in relation to the sea surface height interpolation problem.\n\nBio: Juan Emmanuel Johnson (Eman) was born in Edison, New Jersey, USA. He received his B.Sc. degree in physical oceanography and a B.Sc. degree in mathematical sciences from Florida Institute of Technology (FIT), Melbourne, FL, USA, in 2009-2013. He received his M.Sc. degree in computational and applied mathematics from Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Rochester, NY, USA, in 2013-2016. He received his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Universitat de València, Spain, 2021. He was previously a post-doctoral researcher at the CNRS - Universidad de Grenoble where he applied machine learning techniques for data assimilation strategies on ocean applications at a global scale. He is currently a post-doctoral researcher at the CSIC - Universidad Complutense de Madrid where he investigates applied machine learning methods for anomaly detection and feature attribution of climate variables.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nDr. Amy Lerner\n\nAssociate Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering\n\nAcademic Director, Center for Medical Technology & Innovation\n\nUniversity of Rochester\n\nDr. Erin Leatherman\n\nAssociate Professor of Statistics\n\nKenyon College\n\nTitle: Statistically Augmented Finite Element Models to Study Knee Biomechanics\n\nAbstract: The human knee is a complex structure that is prone to injury, which can lead to osteoarthritis resulting in disability. Biomechanical studies often use finite element (FE) modeling to develop understanding of the risk for progression of disease. However, models must address uncertainties in inputs and variations between individuals. In this work, we study treatments for injuries to the meniscus, a fibro-cartilaginous structure that provides cushioning and stability in the knee. One of the most common surgical procedures is the partial meniscectomy. In most individuals, this treatment is successful in reducing pain, but in others, rapid progression to osteoarthritis occurs. Our goal is to identify characteristics of the patient or injury that contribute to successful outcomes. In this presentation we will describe development of validated FE models, sensitivity to model inputs and describe a predictive statistical model based on knee geometry, tissue properties and injury characteristics.\n\nThe research to be presented is funded by the NIH for a collaborative study with leadership by Suzanne Maher at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.\n\nBio: Amy Lerner is an Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Rochester. She holds degrees from Cornell University, University of Delaware and the University of Michigan. Her research currently focuses on computational biomechanics to consider personalized treatments for knee injury, other risks for osteoarthritis, and corneal treatments. Many studies have involved finite element modeling coupled with a design of experiments approach to explore uncertainty. In addition to her research, as one of the founding members of BME at the University of Rochester, she has developed BME design education programs at the undergraduate and graduate level.\n\nErin Leatherman is an Associate Professor of Statistics at Kenyon College, a selective liberal arts college in central Ohio. She completed her doctoral work at The Ohio State University where she began studying the design and analysis of simulated experiments. Simulators can be used as a stand-alone experimental platform when a traditional physical experiment is not feasible, or they can be used in conjunction with physical experiments; Leatherman has explored both settings. In addition to constructing new statistical methodology, she enjoys using her training to collaborate with researchers in fields outside of statistics.\n\nSpeaker:\n\nDr. Gregory Babbitt\n\nAssociate Professor, Thomas H.

However, it is widely accepted that protein function results from dynamic shifts in machine-like motions induced by molecular interactions, a type of data for which comparative methods of analysis are challenged by the large fraction of protein motion created by random thermal noise induced by the surrounding solvent. Here, we introduce ATOMDANCE, a suite of statistical and kernel-based machine learning tools designed for denoising and comparing functional motion states of proteins captured in time-series from molecular dynamics simulations. ATOMDANCE employs interpretable Gaussian kernel functions to compute site-wise maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between learned features of motion (i.e. functional dynamics) representing two protein states (e.g. bound vs. unbound, wild-type vs. mutant). ATOMDANCE derives empirical p-values identifying functional similarity/difference in dynamics at each amino acid site on the protein. ATOMDANCE also employs MMD to contextually analyze potential random amino-acid replacements thus allowing for a site-wise test of neutral vs. non-neutral evolution in the divergence of dynamic function in protein homologs. Lastly, ATOMDANCE also employs mixed-model ANOVA combined with graph network community detection to identify functional shifts in protein regions that exhibit time-coordinated dynamics or resonance of motion across sites. ATOMDANCE offers a user-friendly interface and requires as input only single structure, topology and trajectory files for each of the two proteins being compared. A separate interface for generating molecular dynamics simulations via open-source tools is offered as well.\n\nWe’ll spend the first half of the talk reviewing the software/methods and we’ll spend the second half as an open discussion of its potential application to problems in virology and immunology.\n\nBio: Dr. Gregory Babbitt is a computational biologist with a focused interest in the development of modern statistical tools for comparative molecular dynamic simulation applied to the function and evolution of proteins and their interactions with other molecules.

These methods have been employed in geophysical exploration, medical imaging, and engineering. In these physical applications, the goal is to develop a qualitative reconstruction method. This would allow one to infer the interior of an object using only physical measurements on its surface as data. More precisely, given a partial differential equation that describes the behavior of a physical system, the goal of an inverse shape problem is to determine the underlying properties of the system from behavior observations. Once the unknown region has been reconstructed, a natural extension would be to consider the inverse parameter problem. In the near future, Granados intends to research how key parameters found in the studied boundary value problem may also be analytically determined from measured data. Furthermore, he also plans to develop non-iterative and computationally inexpensive methods to numerically recover these parameters.\n\nIn this presentation, Granados will consider inverse shape problems coming from diffuse optical tomography and the Helmholtz equation. In both problems, the goal is to reconstruct small volume interior regions from measured data on the exterior surface of an object. In order to achieve this, we will derive an asymptotic expansion of the reciprocity gap functional associated with each problem. The reciprocity gap functional takes in the measured Cauchy data on the exterior surface of the object. In diffuse optical tomography, we prove that a MUSIC-type algorithm that does not require evaluating the Green’s function can be used to recover the unknown subregions. This gives an analytically rigorous and computationally simple method for recovering the small volume regions. For the problem coming from the Helmholtz equation, we recover the subregions of interest via a direct sampling method. The direct sampling method presented here allows us to accurately recover the small volume region from one pair of Cauchy data, requiring less data than many direct sampling methods. We will prove that the direct sampling method is stable with respect to noisy data. Numerical examples will be presented for both cases in two dimensions where the measurement surface is the unit circle.\n\nBio: Govanni Granados is a Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University.

Not only do Tomopteris swim continuously throughout their life, they also perform two modes of locomotion simultaneously: metachronal paddling and bodily undulation. Tomopteris have two rows of flexible legs (parapodia) positioned on opposite sides of its body. Although each row performs a metachronal beating pattern, they paddle out of phase to one another. Both of these paddling behaviors occur in concert with its lateral bodily undulation. This undulation appears to further displace the parapodia, assisting the metachronal paddling process. We created a self-propelled, fluid-structure interaction model of a Tomopteris to explore how these two modes of locomotion synergize to generate effective swimming. In particular, we studied performance holistically over a 6D parameter space (leg length, leg number, paddling amplitude, undulation amplitude, body width, and fluid scale) with our sights on investigating higher-dimensional parameter spaces. In today's talk, I will describe how we approach studying Tomopteris swimming, through a blend of computational fluid dynamics and machine learning techniques.\n\nBio: Nick did his undergraduate studies in math and physics as well as his masters in applied and computational math at RIT.

Voronoi tessellations give rise to a wealth of analytic, geometric, and computational questions. They are also very useful in mathematical and computational modelling.\n\nThis talk will consist of three parts. We begin by introducing the basic definitions and geometry of Voronoi tessellations, centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs), and the notion of optimal quantization. We will then address simple, yet rich, questions on optimal quantization on the 2D and 3D torus, and on the 2-sphere. We will address the geometric nature of the global minimizer (the optimal CVT), presenting a few conjectures and a short discussion on rigorous asymptotic results and their proofs.\n\nWe will then shift gears to address the use Voronoi tessellations in modelling collective behaviours. Collective behaviour in biological systems, in particular the contrast and connection between individual and collective behaviour, has fascinated researchers for decades. A well-studied paradigm entails the tendency of groups of individual agents to form flocks, swarms, herds, schools, etc. We will first review some well-known and widely used models for collective behaviour. We will then present a new dynamical model for generic crowds in which individual agents are aware of their local Voronoi environment -- i.e., neighbouring agents and domain boundary features --and may seek static target locations. Our model incorporates features common to many other ``active matter'' models like collision avoidance, alignment among agents, and homing toward targets. However, it is novel in key respects: the model combines topological and metrical features in a natural manner based upon the local environment of the agent's Voronoi diagram. With only two parameters, it captures a wide range of collective behaviours. The results of many simulations will be shown.\n\nThis talk will be aimed at an undergraduate level. All definitions and concepts will be introduced with prerequisites kept to a minimum (basically multivariable calculus).\n\nBio: Rustum Choksi received the PhD degree in mathematics from Brown University, in 1994.

When cells move in confined environments, they can use excess intracellular pressure to detach and expand small regions of their membrane, completely disassemble the cortex beneath the protruded membrane (actin scar) and form a new cortex at the expanded membrane. This mode of migration, known as blebbing, has been observed in metastatic cancer cells moving in highly confined tumor environments, and may be used to evade cancer drugs that target non-blebbing modes of motility. The mechanism by which cells completely disassemble their cortex during blebbing is not fully understood and could shed light on the dynamic regulation of the actin cortex during cell migration. Recent experimental data in Dictyostelium discoideum cells reveals a local accumulation of myosin II, an essential motor protein capable on inducing contractile stress, in the actin scar prior to any significant disassembly of the cortex. Thus, our data suggests a role for the motor protein in cortex disassembly. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts to use mathematical models to explain the accumulation of myosin in the cortex during blebbing. In particular, I will present a partial differential equation coupled with a system of ODEs that model the intracellular signaling pathway regulating the binding of myosin to the cortex. Numerical simulations of the model suggest that the increase in myosin’s binding rate can be induced by the separation of the cell membrane from the cortex which occurs at the onset of blebbing. Together, our experiments and theory elucidate the regulation of cortex disassembly and more broadly shed light on how cells can use mechanical events, such as membrane separation, to regulate internal cell process during confined migration.\n\nBio: Dr. Asante-Asamani is a Ghanaian by birth and an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Clarkson University in New York.

However, during such high-impact events, misinformation on social media can rapidly spread, affecting decision-making and creating social unrest. Identifying the spread of misinformation during high-impact events is a significant data challenge, given the variety of data associated with social media posts. Recent machine learning advances have shown promise for detecting misinformation, however, there are still key limitations that makes this a significant challenge. These limitations include the effective and efficient modeling of the underlying non-linear associations of multi-modal data as well as the explainability of a system geared at the detection of misinformation. In this talk we present a novel multivariate data fusion framework based on pre-trained deep learning features and a well-structured and parameter-free joint blind source separation method named independent vector analysis, that can reliably respond to this set of limitations. We present the mathematical formulation of the new data fusion algorithm, demonstrate its effectiveness, and present multiple explainability case studies using a popular multi-modal dataset that consists of tweets during several high-impact events.\n\nBio: Zois Boukouvalas' research focuses on the development of interpretable machine learning models and algorithms for the analysis of multi-modal data, by combining aspects from information geometry, mathematical statistics, and numerical optimization.

He is communicating his research findings through peer-review publications, invited talks, and podcast interviews, and he has been the lead principal investigator of several research grants. Through his research and teaching activities, his goal is to create effective environments that encourage and support the success of underrepresented students for entry into machine learning careers.\n\nSpeaker:\n\nDr. Ami Radunskaya\n\nLingurn H. Burkhead Professor of Mathematics\n\nPomona College\n\nTitle: Between Yes and No: Making Decisions Under Uncertainty\n\nAbstract: Often we attempt to answer a question with a “yes” or a “no” by developing predictive models (“Will the small remaining population of axolotls survive outside of their native wetlands?”) or by implementing binary classifiers (“Is this a cat or a dog?”). However, the answers that are provided by our models are often given in terms of probabilities. Even more confusing, different models - equally good according to accuracy metrics - can produce conflicting answers.\n\nIn this talk I will explore these issues and discuss their implications. How do we interpret an answer that is neither “yes” nor “no”? For example, a PCR test for COVID yields a probability. How does the choice of threshold affect the individual? How does it affect policy decisions, or the course of the disease? How can we disentangle the predictions given by competing models; i.e., how can we deal with predictive multiplicity? For example, if two models disagree on whether or not someone is a loan risk, which one should be trusted? Which groups are most affected? What new metrics can be used to compare models?\n\nBio: A California native, Professor Ami Radunskaya received her Ph.D. in Mathematics from Stanford University. She has been a faculty member in the Math Department at Pomona College since 1994.

Currently, there are no longitudinal non-invasive metrics of tendon healing. B-mode ultrasound (US) images have been proposed as a structural metric to quantify scar-tissue volume (STV) during tendon healing, however STV is not a functional metric and does not correlate well with the bio-mechanical properties or states of the tissue. Broadly, US elasticity imaging (US-EI) is a technique that measures displacement fields from US image sequences and uses this information to quantify the mechanical properties or states of the underlying tissue. Thus it is an ideal candidate to develop a functional metric of healing in tissues whose function is mechanical in nature. In this talk, I will discuss research that has been done by our group to develop a US-EI metric of tendon healing in a mouse model and, similarly, for clinical assessment FT healing in humans. Results of the animal study will be presented and discussed. While the human clinical work is in the preliminary phase, preliminary results will be presented and future directions will also be discussed.\n\nBio: Dr. Richards received his Bachelor of Science with in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Rochester followed by a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University.

His research interests focus on the biomechanics of soft tissues and measuring the changes in mechanical properties of diseased tissues using clinical imaging modalities. His research is focused on the development, validation and implementation of elasticity imaging, or elastography, for applications to a wide variety of pathologies, including the diagnosis and monitoring of vascular diseases, assessment of musculoskeletal disorder severity and guiding strategies for physical therapy and breast cancer diagnosis. Elasticity imaging is a technique that offers the ability to provide physicians with entirely new, noninvasive diagnostic information (e.g. tissue mechanical properties and states) using established medical imaging techniques such as clinical ultrasound.\n\nSpeaker:\n\nDr. Nourridine Siewe\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nSchool of Mathematical Sciences\n\nRochester Institute of Technology\n\nTitle: Discrete-Time Models and a SARS CoV-2 Mystery: Sub-Saharan Africa’s Low SARS CoV-2 Disease Burden\n\nAbstract: Worldwide, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 440.8 million people and killed nearly 6.0 million. In Africa, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases was approximately 11.5 million as of March 2, 2022, that is about 2.62 percent of the infections around the world. Many theories and modeling techniques have been used to explain this lower-than-expected number of reported COVID-19 cases in Africa relative to the high disease burden in most developed countries. We noted that most epidemiological mathematical models are formulated in continuous-time interval, and taking Cameroon in Sub-Saharan Africa, and New York State in the USA as case studies, in this paper we developed parameterized discrete-time models (DTM) of COVID-19 in Cameroon and New York State. We used these DTM to study the lower-than-expected COVID-19 infections in developing countries. We then used error analysis to show that a DTM captures the reported COVID-19 new cases in Cameroon and New York State more accurately than its corresponding continuous-time model. We also developed a new theory of model selection for a `better predictor' relative to either of the two possible epidemiological outcomes, namely, extinction or persistence.\n\nBio: Dr. Nourridine Siewe is a broadly trained mathematician who enjoys addressing and solving problems that affect humans, animals and nature in general.

Some of these applications can be modelled by systems of reaction networks, which describe the changes due to individual particles meeting and interacting with each other. There are also many such systems which take place in a spatial domain which is not homogeneous. Models combining spatial dynamics and interactions can be made at different levels of detail using both deterministic and stochastic objects. I will describe the modelling framework at the microscopic level which uses continuous time Markov chains to describe the evolution of the number of particles of different types in different parts of the space. I will discuss various modelling complexities such as multiple time-scale of changes in particle abundances, and the stochastic tools that can be used to reduce the models to a macroscopic descriptions. I will motivate the topic with a basic example of an intracellular mechanism of enzymatic kinetics.\n\nBio: Dr. Lea Popovic is a professor at Concordia University in Montreal.

The Factorization Method uses Picard’s Criteria to define an indicator function to image an unknown region. In most applications, the data operator is compact which gives that the singular values can tend to zero rapidly which can cause numerical instabilities. The regularization of the Factorization Method presented here seeks to avoid the numerical instabilities in applying Picard’s Criteria. This method allows one to image the interior structure of an object with little a priori information in a computationally simple and analytically rigorous way. Here we will focus on an application of this method to diffuse optical tomography which will prove that this method can be used to recover an unknown subregion from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping.\n\nBio: As an undergraduate, my favorite class was Differential Equations. One of the things that fascinated me about the class was how different areas of mathematics came together to solve interesting problems. Ideas from Calculus and Linear Algebra were no longer separate entities but part of something bigger. Being able to study different applications of mathematics as a McNair Scholar help me cultivate my interest in mathematics. After graduating from the University of Delaware I was a postdoc at Texas A&M university then I joined Purdue’s Mathematics Department in Fall 2018 as an Assistant Professor. This was an exciting prospect where I could join a department with extremely talented mathematicians from many different fields.\n\n​Speaker:\n\nDr. Emiliano Brini\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nSchool of Chemistry and Materials Science\n\nRochester Institute of Technology\n\nTitle: Physics-based simulations as drug discovery tools\n\nAbstract: The first two steps in the process of rational drug design are (1) determining the structure of a target protein and (2) screening a series of compounds to identify the ones that best bind to the target. Predicting the structure of a protein means determining its most stable conformation. Identifying the best set of binders means identifying the molecules that bind to the protein more stably. Free energy is the physical quantity that describes the stability of chemical and biological systems. Physics-based simulations offer a principled way to estimate free energies, but most simulation approaches are too slow to sample the vast conformational space of protein systems. To get around this limitation, we developed MELD (Modelling Employing Limited Data), a Bayesian framework that leverages external information to reduce the conformational space of the system. In this talk, I will show how MELD leverages information from machine learning to predict the structure of proteins and how we use the MELD framework to compare the binding affinity of ligands.\n\nBio: Professor Brini got his BS and MS in chemistry at the University of Bologna (Italy). He earned his Ph.D. in physical chemistry at the TU Darmstadt (Germany). He then moved to the US to work as a postdoc first and as a research scientist later in the group of Ken Dill at Stony Brook University (NY). He is now an assistant professor of physical chemistry at RIT. The research in his group focuses on developing new computational tools to characterize the free energy landscape of biologically relevant systems like protein-protein interactions and protein-drug binding. He is also interested in exploring new ways to port these tools to characterize materials' properties.\n\n​Speaker:\n\nDr. Satish Kumar\n\nDistinguished McKnight University Professor\n\nFaculty Director, Industrial Partnership for Research in\n\nInterfacial and Materials Engineering (IPRIME)\n\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science\n\nUniversity of Minnesota\n\nTitle: Dynamic Wetting Failure and Air Entrainment in Coating Flows\n\nAbstract: Dynamic wetting is crucial to processes where liquid displaces another fluid (such as air) along a solid surface, an important example being the deposition of a coating liquid onto a moving substrate. Dynamic wetting failure occurs when the displacement happens too quickly, and this leads to entrainment of the receding fluid into the advancing liquid. In coating processes this entrainment compromises the quality of the final product, so it is desirable to develop a fundamental understanding of the factors that control the onset of dynamic wetting failure. In this talk, I will discuss how the interplay between experiments and modeling has enabled progress in this area. The experiments involve measurements of the critical speed at which wetting failure occurs and flow visualizations of air entrainment. The modeling involves a combination of asymptotic analysis and two-dimensional finite element calculations that link the onset of wetting failure to limit points in families of steady-state solutions. The results reveal the mechanisms responsible for wetting failure and suggest strategies for delaying the onset of air entrainment in coating flows.\n\nBio: Dr. Satish Kumar is a Distinguished McKnight University Professor at the University of Minnesota where he is on the faculty of the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science.

Teboh-Ewungkem\n\nProfessor of Practice\n\nLehigh University\n\nTitle: Mosquito-Borne Diseases: Complexities and Challenges - Using Mathematics to Illuminate how Mosquito Behavioral Dynamics and its Interaction with Humans Enable Disease Transmission Success\n\nAbstract: Many bottlenecks can hamper a successful disease transmission process. For vector-borne diseases, the challenges and bottlenecks are amplified because the disease-causing pathogens have to complete their life cycles in both the human/animal host and the vector. Thus, pathogens enact ways to succeed and ensure continuous success and survivability. To fully understand this, I will focus on the human malaria disease, one of the oldest vector-borne diseases caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. For a successful transmission of the malaria parasite from one human to another, a susceptible (healthy) adult female mosquito must successfully feed on two distinct humans – one infected with the parasite and the other not, at two distinct sequential time points. In addition, the parasite must be in its transmissible forms in both the human and the mosquito during the feeding encounters. That still does not guarantee transmission success; the feeding encounter may lead to the mosquito’s demise. If, however, the mosquito succeeds in drawing blood, it may not successfully infect the human. The bottlenecks involved illuminate how parasites exploit the human-mosquito interaction necessitated by the evolutionary and reproductive needs of mosquitoes to enhance parasite’s survivability. Therefore, understanding this multiscale complex process, viewed from the lens of transmitting mosquitoes, taking into consideration the mosquito’s own evolutionary need for survival, is essential. Preliminary work has shown that interesting dynamics can be observed even under simple mass action assumptions. Moreover, our methods allow for the incorporation of multiple feeding and mosquito gonotrophic cycles and their contributions to mosquito abundance which then directly and indirectly have consequences for malaria intensity and transmissibility success. It also indicates how a mosquito’s age is linked to disease transmissibility success when we incorporate parasite dynamics into a model that captures the interaction of mosquitoes, humans and the malaria parasite. One by-product of explicitly incorporating the mosquitoes’ gonotrophic cycles is the implicit embedding of the extrinsic incubation period of the disease in the modeling framework. In this talk, I will present some results that have been obtained from a complex system aimed at understanding malaria disease dynamics via the lens of mosquitoes.\n\nBio: Dr. Miranda Teboh-Ewungkem is a Professor of Practice in the Department of Mathematics at Lehigh University, serving as a faculty member since 2015.

An enormous range of M&S disciplines are relevant to medical devices, from traditional solid mechanics models to predict fracture risk of implanted devices, electromagnetic models to predict MRI-induced heating of metallic implants, to physiological patients models used to evaluate physiologic closed loop control devices such as automated mechanic ventilators. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is tasked with ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices on the US market. A key question that CDRH has been faced with in recent years, as M&S has become increasingly used in medical device regulatory submissions, is when can M&S be trusted, that is, when is M&S credible? This talk will begin with an overview of M&S at FDA, following by an overview of M&S applications for medical devices. We will then discuss model credibility assessment, including frameworks for assessing models that have recently been developed by the medical devices community, and presenting research and results of assessment of models of the electrical activity in the heart.\n\nBio: Dr. Pras Pathmanathan is a senior scientist at the Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories (OSEL), the regulatory science research Office within FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH).

These molecules are connected to each other in complex signaling networks that serve as biological algorithms that fine-tune the activation of suites of genes that allow plants to respond to their environments, defend themselves, and optimally utilize resources. Jasmonic acid is an lipid-derived hormone and provides defense against insects and pathogens, however the precise mechanisms regulating the jasmonic acid biochemical reactions in vivo remain to be characterized, especially in agriculturally-relevant crop species.\n\nIn this talk we present the interdisciplinary mathematical and biological framework the we are currently developing to study jasmonic acid production during the maize wound response. Mathematical models will be used as “virtual lab” and work in synergy with “wet lab” experiments to iteratively optimize model parameters, isolate and quantify the relative contribution of factors that are difficult to separate in vivo, and to develop and test hypothesis.\n\nBio: Dr. Lucia Carichino is an Assistant Professor in the School of Mathematical Sciences at RIT.

Weinstein\n\nProfessor and Department Head\n\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering\n\nRochester Institute of Technology\n\nTitle: Modeling of Thin Film Flows\n\nAbstract: Laminar flow of thin liquid films is fundamental to coating processes. Even with modern high-powered computers, numerical solutions of the full set of governing equations are often time-intensive; this is due to the nonlinearities inherent in free surface flows, as well as the small aspect ratios typically involved. It is often the case, however, that the film thickness varies gradually in the flow direction in various regions of a coating process. Consequently, the classical boundary-layer approximation to the Navier-Stokes equation is justified. A standard approach to the boundary layer equations, attractive because of its ease of use, is to integrate the boundary layer equations across the film and introduce an assumed form of the velocity field. This velocity field is typically parabolic and self-similar, in that it does not change its basic shape in the direction of the flow. The result is a simplified equation, henceforth referred to as the film equation, involving only the unknown film thickness. In many cases, the film curvature is small and surface tension terms in the film equation are negligible; the resulting first-order nonlinear differential equation is typically straightforward to solve, oftentimes in analytical form.\n\nUnder conditions of negligible surface tension, the film equation can exhibit a singularity called a critical point, which is related to a change in the direction of the underlying wave propagation. In many problems, the singularity may be eliminated by a particular choice of parameters, and a physically correct model of the flow may be obtained. Singularity elimination can occur in configurations where the fluid accelerates in the primary flow direction (such as in weir flows or rapid dip coating) and the wave propagation thus undergoes a subcritical-to-supercritical transition. On the other hand, a non-removable singularity arises in configurations where the fluid is decelerating in the primary direction of flow, and the wave propagation thus transitions from supercritical to subcritical. In this talk, we specifically examine decelerating flow on an inclined plane, which is perhaps the simplest configuration that can exhibit a non-removable singularity. Finite element predictions and numerical solutions of the full boundary layer equations indicate that interface solutions having small slopes should exist under conditions where the film equation fails. Using both physical and mathematical arguments, we demonstrate that the film equation must be modified for a velocity profile of changing shape. The resulting predictions are found to compare favorably with finite element solutions, the full boundary layer equations, and experiments.\n\nBio: Dr. Steve Weinstein received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Rochester and his MS/PhD in Chemical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania.

City residents (voters) elect mayors (politicians) and elected mayors determine the resources to be allocated to crime prevention. Between the two time periods, there is an election. Politicians are either honest or dishonest. The marginal cost of public monies 𝜓 measures how efficiently an elected mayor converts tax receipts into crime prevention. Voters have identical per period utility functions. We ascertain the equilibrium outcome and per period voter well-being. Second, we show that an increase in 𝜓 reduces the equilibrium allocation of resources to crime prevention and voter well-being. Third, a dishonest politician can delay the revelation of his dishonesty. A critical value of 𝜓, 𝜓∗, exists such that a dishonest incumbent separates and loses the election if and only if 𝜓 > 𝜓∗ and he pools and is re-elected otherwise. Finally, we note that an increase in 𝜓 can raise voter well-being when politicians are more likely to be dishonest.\n\nBio: Dr. Amit Batabyal is Arthur J.

Three utmost challenges on obtaining meaningful solutions to large-scale and data-intensive inverse problems are ill-posedness of the problem, large dimensionality of the parameters, and the complexity of the model constraints. In this talk, we use a combination of tools from numerical linear algebra, optimization, parameter estimation, and statistics to overcome computational challenges that arise in data-intensive inverse problems. In particular, we describe computationally efficient methods that learn optimal lp and lq norms for Lp-Lq regularization and learn optimal parameters for regularization matrices defined by covariance kernels. Further we describe some efficient methods for computing solutions with preserved edges to dynamic inverse problems, where both the quantities of interest and the forward operator change at different time instances. Numerical examples such as tomographic reconstruction and image deblurring illustrate the performance of the discussed approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Current and potential future research directions will conclude the talk.\n\nBio: Dr. Mirjeta Pasha is a Postdoctoral Associate at Arizona State University.

Approaches from statistical physics study how behaviors arise in collections of simple elements connected together in complex structures such as modular or scale-free networks. They provide understanding about massive networks, revealing implications that network structure can have on network function and resilience. In contrast, approaches from dynamical systems and control theory typically study small systems of nonlinear nodes connected together in simple networks. This talk presents recent work bridging the gap of complex networks with complex nodes. First is considering nonlinear phase-amplitude oscillators coupled together by simple ring networks and how the interplay of nodal dynamics and coupling structure gives rise to emergent long-range order and its stability properties. Next is increasing the structural complexity from dyadic networks to hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions and study cluster synchronization. The focus will then turn to social networks, starting from modeling humans as nodes with underlying attributes coupled in complete graphs, and moving on to real-world multiplex social networks in macaque monkey societies. We reveal the tensions between the forces of homophily and social balance, as well as developing a meaningful multiplex ranking method that takes into account the heterogeneous characteristics and functions of the distinct layers in the multiplex.\n\nBio: Dr. Raissa D'Souza is Professor of Computer Science and of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Davis, as well as an External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute.

Simultaneously, wildland fire decision makers are working towards more proactive approaches to managing the risk of wildfire, such as fuels treatments and prescribed fire. Executing such measures requires the ability to explore the ramification of such treatments as well as ensure that prescribed fires will meet their objectives. Experiments and observations have demonstrated that the two-way feedbacks between fires and atmosphere play critical roles in determining how fires spread or if they spread. Advancements in computing and numerical modeling have generated new opportunities for the use of models that couple process-based wildfire models to atmospheric computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models. These process-based coupled fire/atmosphere models, which simulate critical processes such as heat transfer, buoyancy-induced flows and vegetation aerodynamic drag, are not practical for operational faster-than-real-time fire prediction due to their computational and data requirements. However, these process-based coupled fire-atmosphere models make it possible to represent many of the fire-atmosphere feedbacks and thus have the potential to complement experiments, add perspective to observations, bridge between idealized-fire scenarios and more complex and realistic landscape fire scenarios, allow for sensitivity analysis that is impractical through observations and pose new hypothesis that can be tested experimentally. Additionally, coupled wildfire/atmosphere modeling opens new possibilities for understanding the sometime counterintuitive impacts of fuel management and exploring the implications of various prescribed fire tactics. Certainly, there need to be continued efforts to validate the results from these numerical investigations, but, even so, they suggest relationships, interactions and phenomenology that should be considered in the context of the interpretation of observations, design of fire behavior experiments, development of new operational models and even risk management. One additional goal for the use of CFD based coupled fire/atmosphere models is to highlight the necessary phenomenology that is necessary in fast running models.\n\nBio: Dr. Rodman Linn is a senior scientist in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory and a Professor in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at the University of California San Diego (Joint UCSD/LANL appointment).

We fit the within-host model to data, collected in monkeys. We compute the reproduction numbers of the HIV and opioid epidemics. We show that the disease-free equilibrium is locally stable if both reproduction numbers are below one, and unstable if at least one of the reproduction numbers is above one. The HIV-only equilibrium exists if the reproduction number of HIV is larger than one. The opioid-use only equilibrium exists if the reproduction number of opioid use is larger than one. The HIV-only equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if the invasion number of the opioid epidemic is below one and unstable if the invasion number of opioid epidemic is above one. The opioid-only equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if the invasion number of the HIV epidemic is below one and unstable if the invasion number of HIV epidemic is above one. We fit the no-network model to within-host and between host data to determine parameters. We perform structural and practical identifiability of the within-host model. Simulation suggest that coexistence of HIV infected, opioid affected and co-affected individuals is possible.\n\nBio: Dr. Maia Martcheva is a professor of mathematics at University of Florida.

For low contrasts, the conductivities of the matrix and fractures are close enough that the medium behaves as a homogenous medium. For higher contrasts, the matrix will not be conductive enough to be a part of the overall flow process in the reservoir, so it behaves as a source of fluid to fractures. For very high contrasts, the matrix is almost not conductive, consequently, the overall flow will be governed by the flow in the fracture network. Other intermediate cases may also occur.\n\nThe macroscopic pressure behavior of multi-scale fractured media is investigated using homogenization technique. This approach captures the details of the flow both within and between the porous matrix and fracture. A general equivalent macroscopic model is proposed. The equivalent porosity and the equivalent permeability of the averaged medium are derived. The memory effect in the medium is included in the averaged model through an integro-differential term. The memory effect represents the difference between the response time of matrix and fracture to the same pressure drop. Depending on the ratio of the fracture to matrix diffusivity, the fracture to matrix volume ratio, and the number of scales of nonhomogeneity in the medium, several memory terms are obtained. The impact of the presence of additional scale of the fracture network, such as secondary and tertiary fractures on the equivalent model, and pressure transient behavior is highlighted. The macroscale model for an arbitrary number of scales and its limit for the infinite hierarchy is obtained. The kernel of the memory operator is the solution of a nonlinear integro-differential equation. Pressure transient behavior of the multi-scale model is compared to classic double-porosity model.\n\nBio: Dr. Mojdeh Rasoulzadeh is an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, adjunct faculty in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and affiliated to the Center for Complex Hydro Systems at The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa.

To locate food quickly, they have more olfactory genes than any other animal, and they also employ periodic sniffs with their trunk. In this talk, I'll show how the frequency of sniffing changes with body size. We will apply the fluid mechanics of cardiovascular flows to calculate the time for odors to diffuse to the elephant's receptors. We visualize flows using experiments with GROMIT, a bellows-driven device that inhales air at the sniffing frequencies of animals, and was awarded third place in a cheese-sniffing machine olfaction competition in Montreal. Lastly, we will present our experiments and modeling of a wombat's cubic feces. The flat faces are created through a drying process analogous to the formation of columnar joints in Giant's Causeway, Ireland; the corners are sculpted by non-uniform material properties in the intestinal wall.

Globally, efforts to understand building occupancy continue to rely on a patchwork of disparate resources that vary widely in availability and sophistication. To use these effectively still requires expert judgment to harmonize the data and produce meaningful occupancy estimates. Despite the extraordinary societal impacts of big data, including IoT, social media, cell tracking, webcams, imagery exploitation, and a wide array of open-source data, the challenge of estimating population is still not a “solved problem”. The problem largely remains an open interdisciplinary challenge requiring the qualitative and quantitative contributions of social scientists, population scientists, remote sensing practitioners, computer scientists, and data scientists. Against this backdrop, there is a unique opportunity to leverage the qualities of Bayesian reasoning to explicitly harmonize disparate data, capture process uncertainty, and intuitively convey occupancy estimates to a wide range of consumers. In this talk, I present a Bayesian model that: 1) provides an explicit, systematic approach to engaging data, data harmonization techniques, and expert judgment in the production of occupancy estimation, 2) probabilistically evolves and refines estimates over time as new data and expertise emerge, and 3) retains and characterizes uncertainty emerging from expert judgment, data, and inference.

While these large datasets containing millions of observations of cells, peoples, or brain voxels hold great potential for understanding generative state space of the data, as well as drivers of differentiation, disease and progression, they also pose new challenges in terms of noise, missing data, measurement artifacts, and the so-called “curse of dimensionality.” In this talk, I will cover data geometric and topological approaches to understanding the shape and structure of the data. First, we show how diffusion geometry and deep learning can be used to obtain useful representations of the data that enable denoising (MAGIC), dimensionality reduction (PHATE), and factor analysis (Archetypal Analysis Network) of the data. Next we will show how to learn dynamics from static snapshot data by using a manifold-regularized neural ODE-based optimal transport (TrajectoryNet). Finally, we cover a novel approach to combine diffusion geometry with topology to extract multi-granular features from the data (Diffusion Condensation and Multiscale PHATE) to assist in differential and predictive analysis. On the flip side, we also create a manifold geometry from topological descriptors, and show its applications to neuroscience. Together, we will show a complete framework for exploratory and unsupervised analysis of big biomedical data.\n\nBio: Dr. Smita Krishnaswamy is an Associate professor in Genetics and Computer Science.

The atmosphere is known to be a chaotic system which, although deterministic, is very sensitive to small perturbations to initial conditions. We assume that as a result of the tight coupling between fire and atmosphere, wildland fire behavior, in turn, should also be sensitive to small perturbations in atmospheric initial conditions. Observations from experimental burns suggest that low-intensity fire in particular is susceptible to small perturbations in the wind field, which can significantly alter fire spread. Here we employ a computational fluid dynamics model of coupled fire-atmosphere interactions to answer the question: How sensitive is fire behavior to small variations in atmospheric turbulence? We perform ensemble simulations of fires in homogenous grass fuels. The only difference between ensemble members is the state of the turbulent atmosphere provided to the model throughout the simulation. We find a wide range of outcomes, with area burned ranging from 2212 m2 to 11236 m2 (>400% change), driven by sensitivity to variability in both initial and boundary atmospheric conditions during the initial 30 seconds of simulation. Our results highlight the need for ensemble simulations, especially when considering fire behavior in marginal burning conditions, such as during prescribed fire application.\n\nBio: Dr. Alex Jonko is an atmospheric scientist interested in modeling wildland fire behavior and fire-climate interactions.

Work on the input layer of the primary visual cortex (V1) is now nearly complete, and I would like to share some of that with you. I will divide by time between the following two topics: (1) Local circuits, the dynamics of which I will describe in some detail, including an emergent rhythm detected all over the brain. (2) The wiring that confers upon the visual cortex the ability to identify contours, following the well-known theory of Hubel and Wiesel. I will present a large-scale mechanistic model that incorporates the ideas discussed, and show simulations of the visual cortex computing in real time, producing activity maps that are analogous to fMRI but on the neuronal level, with arbitrarily high spatio-temporal resolutions.\n\nBio: Dr. Lai-Sang Young is a Professor of Mathematics at the Courant Institute and Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science at NYU.

Figure credit: Cooper Elsworth\n\nAbstract: The Antarctic Ice Sheet exhibits astonishing spatial and temporal variability in ice flow rate and associated mass loss. Rapid ice flow is concentrated in narrow corridors called ice streams that together with outlet glaciers account for the majority of the current mass loss from the ice-sheet interior to the ocean. The response of the ice streams to climatically induced perturbations is highly consequential for future projections of sea level, but our understanding of the physical processes governing ice-stream dynamics is limited. This limitation is particularly concerning in light of observations indicating that in the past, the position, width, and flow speed of ice streams have varied notably on decadal to centennial time-scales. In this talk, I will present a sequence of mathematical models that shed light on the physical processes that control potential adjustments of ice streams in the near future. Our analysis suggests that existing data and models are too incomplete to reliably assess ice loss from the two ice sheets under changing climatic conditions. However, I argue that the uncertainty itself is a valuable scientific contribution for informing climate adaptation planning and briefly lay out an avenue for making progress on science-based, equitable adaptation in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nBio: Dr. Jenny Suckale is an Assistant Professor in Department of Geophysics at Stanford University.
