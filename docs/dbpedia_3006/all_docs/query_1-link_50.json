MICHAEL ALLISON KELLY ______ HON. ANNA G. ESHOO of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, September 24, 2008 Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding researcher, business leader, professor, husband, father, grandfather, sailor, winemaker and prolific inventor, Michael A. Kelly, who is retiring after decades of outstanding work at Stanford University in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Mike was born to James and Irene Kelly on December 14, 1936, in Roswell, New Mexico, (pop. 35,000â€”largest city for 200 miles) with wide open spaces and lots of sky. The Navy gave him an ROTC scholarship to UCLA when he was 18 years old and because he was such an outstanding student, he graduated in 1959 with a B.S. in engineering. The Navy sent Mike to the Brooklyn Navy Yard for 3 years where large ships equivalent to aircraft carriers were built. He loved New York City where military service people were treated with great respect and given free tickets to Broadway plays and concerts. Mike attended Brooklyn Polytechnic during this time and received his MSEE in 1963. After the Navy, Mike returned to California where he was accepted into one of the most competitive graduate programs in the nation, University of California at Berkeley's Physics Department. Mike studied photonuclear physics experiments on oriented nuclei under Professor Carl Helmholtz, finishing a PhD in nuclear physics in 1968. Hewlett Packard wisely tapped Mike after he graduated to run a group developing analytical instruments running HP's R&D and marketing efforts for the early XPS spectrometer which was introduced in 1972. HP sold Mike the parts needed to build an XPS. Three colleagues and Mike developed a business plan to form a company called Surface Science Laboratories based in Mountain View, California, using this spectrometer to help local manufacturers solve production problems. Unable to secure venture capital, they each contributed $5,000, and Mike departed HP and became the company's first employee, with his partners helping evenings and weekends. They managed to survive without any additional funding and they were all employed by the company within a year. They added a division to manufacture XPS instruments and grew to about 100 employees. They decided [[Page 21951]] to merge with a publicly traded instrument company (Kevex Corporation, with approximately 300 employees) in 1982, and Mike became the Chief Operating Officer and later President of the combined company. In 1984, after Kevex Corporation was purchased by a British firm, Mike began his work at Stanford University under the leadership of Stig Hagstrom, then the outstanding Chairman of the Materials Science Department at Stanford. Mike planned to stay about a year, but the environment was so pleasant and invigorating that he stayed as a Consulting Professor, teaching courses in materials synthesis and characterization. Stig accepted a position in Sweden as the Chancellor of the Universities a few years later, and Mike continued to run his research group doing work on CVD diamond growth for five years. In 1991 Mike borrowed an XPS spectrometer from his old company, (Stanford later bought it) forming the basis of what is now the surface analysis lab in SNL. A recent collaboration with the brilliant and wonderful Professor ZX Shen developing a microwave microscope has been a particularly valuable experience for Mike. Mike has been awarded many professional honors including the IR(100) Award for an imaging, photon counting detector; IR(500) Award for a high spatial resolution XPS spectrometer; the Glenn T. Seaborg Laboratory Special Award for a soft x-ray window; and the Takeda Foundation Techno-Entrepreneurship Award. Mike is a member of the American Physical Society, a Fellow of the American Vacuum Society, and member of the Materials Research Society. He is published and holds many patents. Lastly, Mike enjoys the honor of being part of the Kelly Clan which includes his wife Carol; his children Jim, Paul, Maureen, and Brian, their spouses and partners Charlie, Lisa, and Jack; Carol's children Karen and Eric, and Eric's wife Sarah; his brothers and sister Tom, Dick, and Barbara, and their spouses and partners Jan, Melanie and Milt; his nephews and nieces Mike (and his wife Darlene), Sean, Kathy (and her husband Mike), Patty, Tommy, Kelly, Mike, Gretchen, and Matt; and his adored grandchildren Izzy, Annie, Lucy, Ryan, Jack, and Katie. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the work of Dr. Michael A. Kelly as he begins the next exciting chapter of his life. Mike has given exemplary service to advance the research goal of better understanding of materials and energy sciences that form the foundation for developing new, clean energy with less impact on our environment, an endeavor that benefits our entire nation. He is a conscientious and gifted mentor of the next generation of talented young scientists, and a true example of being a scholar and a gentleman. It is a privilege to know and represent Mike Kelly and an honor to single out his extraordinary achievements and contributions. ____________________"
