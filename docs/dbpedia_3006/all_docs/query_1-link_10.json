        "text": "by Karen Rhodes\n\nAsked why she and her husband committed $500,000 to lead the campaign for Berkeley's new physics laboratories, Betty Helmholz is quick to reply.\n\n\"The exciting work in Berkeley's physics department brought Carl to California--and to me.\"\n\nFriends since their Minnesota childhoods, Betty Little and Carl Helmholz found themselves on opposite coasts when Betty went to Stanford and Carl to Harvard.\n\nTo begin graduate work in 1937, Carl chose Berkeley because of the pioneering discoveries of E. O. Lawrence, Luis Alvarez and other progenitors of high-energy physics.\n\nBut he knew Betty was nearby. They were married in 1938 after she graduated from Stanford.\n\nTheir gift will help build modern teaching and research space for the Department of Physics, which faces serious needs for expanded and modernized space.\n\nCarl Helmholz taught in the department for 40 years, serving as chair from 1955 to 1962.\n\nAfter retiring in 1980, he continued to offer time and counsel to the department and the university. She, too, has been active with the University YWCA, International House, the University Art Museum and other campus programs.\n\n\"At this point in our lives, we found we could do something,\" she says. \"It's nice to be able to share our good fortune.\"\n\n\"We made the gift to benefit the department as a whole,\" adds Carl Helmholz.\n\n\"We know that the new labs will be used by numerous people and that activities will change over time. We have a lot of confidence in the department.\"\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR THIS ISSUE] [HOME] [SEARCH] [ARCHIVE]\n\nCopyright 1996, The Regents of the University of California.\n\nProduced and maintained by the Office of Public Affairs at UC Berkeley.\n\nComments?
