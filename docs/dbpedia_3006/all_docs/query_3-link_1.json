He received a B.A. from Harvard in 1932. After spending a year at Cambridge University, Helmholz applied for the University of California, Berkeley’s graduate program in physics.\n\nAt Berkeley, Helmholz worked with the universities 37-inch cyclotron. In 1942 he joined the Manhattan Project. He worked with the Berkeley Radiation Lab’s cyclotrons to separate uranium for experiments at Los Alamos.\n\nAfter the war, Helmholz continued studying nuclear physics at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He became a full professor of physics in 1951. After that, he was chair of the Berkeley physics department for seven years.\n\nHelmholz died on October 29, 2003 in Lafayette, California."
