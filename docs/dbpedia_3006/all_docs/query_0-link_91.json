Oral history is a method of collecting historical information through tape-recorded interviews between a narrator with firsthand knowledge of historically significant events and a well- informed interviewer, with the goal of preserving substantive additions to the historical record. The tape recording is transcribed, lightly edited for continuity and clarity, and reviewed by the interviewee. The corrected manuscript is indexed, bound with photographs and illustrative materials, and placed in The Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley, and in other research collections for scholarly use. Because it is primary material, oral history is not intended to present the final, verified, or complete narrative of events. It is a spoken account, offered by the interviewee in response to questioning, and as such it is reflective, partisan, deeply involved, and irreplaceable. ************************************ All uses of this manuscript are covered by a legal agreement between The Regents of the University of California and Carl E.

Schorske, Curriculum Vitae 181 INDEX 187 UNIVERSITY HISTORY SERIES LIST 192 PREFACE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY AT BERKELEY ORAL HISTORY SERIES The Department of History at Berkeley oral history series grew out of Gene Brucker's (Professor of History, 1954-1991) 1995 Faculty Research Lecture on \"History at Berkeley.\" In developing his lecture on the transformations in the UC Berkeley Department of History in the latter half of the twentieth century, Brucker, whose tenure as professor of history from 1954 to 1991 spanned most of this period, realized how much of the story was undocumented. Discussion with Carroll Brentano (M.A. History, 1951, Ph.D. History, 1967), coordinator of the University History Project at the Center for Studies in Higher Education, history department faculty wife, and a former graduate student in history, reinforced his perception that a great deal of the history of the University and its academic culture was not preserved for future generations. The Department of History, where one might expect to find an abiding interest in preserving a historical record, had discarded years of departmental files, and only a fraction of history faculty members had placed their personal papers in the Bancroft Library.1 Moreover, many of the most interesting aspects of the historyâ€”the life experiences, cultural context, and personal perceptionsâ€”were only infrequently committed to paper.2 They existed for the most part in the memories of the participants. Carroll Brentano knew of the longtime work of the Regional Oral History Office (ROHO) in recording and preserving the memories of participants in the history of California and the West and the special interest of ROHO in the history of the University. She and Gene Brucker then undertook to involve Ann Lage, a ROHO interviewer /editor who had conducted a number of oral histories in the University History Series and was herself a product of Berkeley's history department (B.A. 1963, M.A. 1965). In the course of a series of mutually enjoyable luncheon 'The Bancroft Library holds papers from history professors Walton Bean, Woodbridge Bingham, Herbert Bolton, Woodrow Borah, George Guttridge, John Hicks, Joseph Levenson, Henry May, William Alfred Morris, Frederic Paxson, Herbert Priestley, Engel Sluiter, Raymond Sontag. 2Two published memoirs recall the Berkeley history department: John D. Hicks, My Life with History (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1968) recalls his years as professor and dean, 1942-1957; Henry F. May reflects on his years as an undergraduate at Berkeley in the thirties in Coming to Terms (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987). ii meetings, the project to document the history of the Department of History at Berkeley evolved. In initial discussions about the parameters of the project, during which the varied and interesting lives of the history faculty were considered, a crucial decision was made. Rather than conduct a larger set of short oral histories focussed on topics limited to departmental history, we determined to work with selected members of the department to conduct more lengthy biographical memoirs. We would record relevant personal background- -family, education, career choices, marriage and children, travel and avocations; discuss other institutional affiliations; explore the process of creating their historical works; obtain reflections on their retirement years. A central topic for each would be, of course, the Department of History at Berkeley â€” its governance, the informal and formal relationships among colleagues, the connections with the broader campus, and curriculum and teaching at both the graduate and undergraduate level. Using the Brucker lecture as a point of departure, it was decided to begin to document the group of professors who came to the department in the immediate postwar years, the 1950s, and the early 1960s. Now retired, the younger ones somewhat prematurely because of a university retirement incentive offer in the early nineties, this group was the one whose distinguished teaching and publications initially earned the Department of History its high national rating. They made the crucial hiring and promotion decisions that cemented the department's strength and expanded and adapted the curriculum to meet new academic interests. At the same time, they participated in campus governing bodies as the university dealt with central social, political, and cultural issues of our times, including challenges to civil liberties and academic freedom, the response to tumultuous student protests over free speech, civil rights and the Vietnam War, and the demands for equality of opportunity for women and minorities. And they benefitted from the postwar years of demographic and economic growth in California accompanied for the most part through the 1980s with expanding budgets for higher education. Clearly, comprehensive oral histories discussing the lives and work of this group of professors would produce narratives of interest to researchers studying the developments in the discipline of history, higher education in the modern research university, and postwar California, as well as the institutional history of the University of California. Carroll Brentano and Gene Brucker committed themselves to facilitate the funding of the oral history project, as well as to enlist the interest of potential memoirists in participating in the process. Many members of the department responded with interest, joined the periodic lunch confabs, offered advice in planning, and helped find funding to support the project. In the spring of 1996, the interest of iii the department in its own history led to an afternoon symposium, organized by Brentano and Professor of History Sheldon Rothblatt and titled \"Play It Again, Sam.\" There, Gene Brucker restaged his Faculty Research Lecture. Professor Henry F. May responded with his own perceptions of events, followed by comments on the Brucker and May theses from other history faculty, all videotaped for posterity and the Bancroft Library.1 Meanwhile, the oral history project got underway with interviews with Delmer Brown, professor of Japanese history; Nicholas Riasanovsky, Russian ana European intellectual history; and Kenneth Stampp, American history. A previously conducted oral history with Woodrow Borah, Latin American history, was uncovered and placed in The Bancroft Library. An oral history with Carl Schorske, European intellectual history, is in process at the time of this writing, and more are in the works. The selection of memoirists for the project is determined not only by the high regard in which they are held by their colleagues, because that would surely overwhelm us with candidates, but also by their willingness to commit the substantial amount of time and thought to the oral history process. Age, availability of funding, and some attention to a balance in historical specialties also play a role in the selection order. The enthusiastic response of early readers has reaffirmed for the organizers of this project that departmental histories and personal memoirs are essential to the unraveling of some knotty puzzles: What kind of a place is this University of California, Berkeley, to which we have committed much of our lives? What is this academic culture in which we are enmeshed? And what is this enterprise History, in which we all engage? As one of the project instigators reflected, \"Knowing what was is essential; and as historians we know the value of sources, even if they are ourselves.\" The beginnings are here in these oral histories .

Sheehan Among the few lectures notes that have survived from my many years of formal education are six tattered pages with the dates, Wednesday, October 7 and Friday, October 9, 1959. The course was Raymond J. Sontag's \"Intellectual History of Europe,\" the place, Room 155, Dwinelle Hall, the subject, Hegel, and the lecturer, Carl E. Schorske, who had been invited to fill in while Ray Sontag was out of town. Together with the other graduate student assistants in the course, I had awaited Schorske 's appearance with interest and anticipation. Of course, we did not know that this would mark the beginning of his association with Berkeley â€” and, for some of us, of four decades of friendshipâ€”but we had heard a good deal about him. He was supposed to be a brilliant teacher, his book on Social Democracy was required reading for every serious student of German history, and we had heard rumors that he had turned down offers from both Berkeley and Harvard in order to stay at Wesleyan, decisions that seemed, to me at least, somewhat noble and very eccentric. Even without the aid of my notes, I have a vivid recollection of Carl's two lectures on Hegel, which displayed his characteristic blend of rhetorical power and intellectual energy. Without losing sight of the text at hand (Hegel's lectures on the philosophy of history), he established connections between Hegel and his historical setting, explained the cultural traditions within which he worked, and then suggested the implications of his ideas for the evolution of German thought. But what made these two lectures â€” and the many others I heard after Carl began teaching at Berkeleyâ€” so memorable was not simply Carl's command of the material and his verbal brilliance, but also his ability to invite his listeners to join him in a common enterprise and thus to transform them from his audience into his companions on a shared intellectual journey. There was always a certain openness and spontaneity in Schorske 's lectures; rather than present a finished product they illustrated an ongoing inquiry. This was, I think, the most important source of the excitement with which his lecture room was always charged. As a graduate teacher, Carl had the same ability to inform, engage, and inspire, and always to do so without arrogance or intimidation. I remember our first conversation about my ideas â€” if that is what my random inclinations and inchoate ambitions can be calledâ€”for a dissertation. Rather than suggesting possible topics or simply assigning me something to work on, Carl told me about the books he had recently read that seemed to suggest new and interesting ways of thinking about intellectual history: Kaegi's biography of Burckhardt, Gollwitzer's book on the Standesherren. and a few others. Clearly I was not going to be able to write such books (in fact, at that point I was vi barely able to read them) , but he offered them to me as sources of stimulation and inspiration, models towards which to strive. This made me feel like a colleague, with whom he could share his current enthusiasms, and not like a pupil in need of direction. As my own research plans began to form, then collapsed, and finally jelled, he was always attentive, sometimes criticalâ€”but never intrusive, overbearing, or discouraging. He was, moreover, extremely diligent in the quotidian dimensions of the graduate teacher's responsibilitiesâ€”writing letters of recommendation, returning draft chapters, and the likeâ€” the difficulties of which I now understand and appreciate much better than I did at the time. When Carl came to Berkeley, his scholarly reputation rested on his book about German Social Democracy, which sought to explain the party's split in 1917 in terms of deeply-rooted structural and ideological divisions within the labor movement. Although I am now somewhat skeptical about the book's central argument (it seems to me that the immediate impact of the war played a more important role in the party's divisions than Carl's structural analysis would suggest), it is still one of the books I most like to read with my graduate students. It is, in the first place, a beautifully conceived and powerfully sustained historical analysis, clearly written, elegantly researched, and filled with well-chosen examples. Moreover- -and this is always the sign of first-rate historyâ€” it tells us about much more than its ostensible subject: in this case, about the political and social problems of the German Empire, the interaction of ideology and organization, andâ€” last but not leastâ€” the political climate in which the book itself was written. Although after this book, Carl moved away from political history, politics always remained central to his scholarly vocation, which was indelibly marked by the two central crises of his generation: the rise of National Socialism in the thirties, which shadowed his years as an undergraduate as well as his wartime service with the OSS, and the emergence of the Cold War in the forties and early fifties, which shaped his own relationship to American politics. By the time Carl arrived in Berkeley, he had already begun to work on culture in Vienna around the turn of the century. I recall hearing him describe this project to a packed audience of faculty and students in the Alumni House; parts of it appeared in his course on European Intellectual History, which I audited in 1960-61. For a variety of reasons- -not least among them Carl's engagement with the events that are described in what follows â€” the book he planned to write was never written in the narrative form he had originally intended. Instead, he produced a series of essays that were eventually published in 1980 as Fin-de-Siecle Vienna, a book that has been widely and deeply influential across the usual disciplinary boundaries. The connecting themes uniting these essays are the collapse of Austrian liberalism and the rise of cultural modernism, which worked together to generate an unresolved tension between political pathology and cultural creativity. In Fin-de- vii Siecle Vienna, and in the many essays that he has written since (some now collected as Thinking with History [Princeton University Press, 1998]), Carl Schorske has illuminated the complex connections between politics and culture, his major concern as a scholar and, for the years that he was at Berkeley, the object of his efforts as an academic citizen caught up in the affairs of a great university in crisis. James J. Sheehan Professor of History November 1999 Stanford, California viii INTRODUCTION by Reginald E. Zelnik Carl Schorske and Berkeley's Time of Troubles We read in Jim Sheehan's illuminating introduction to Carl Schorske 's oral history that politics always remained central to Schorske 's \"scholarly vocation\"; and at the end of the essay Jim refers to Carl as \"an academic citizen caught up in the affairs of a great university in crisis.\" I was present at Berkeley for the last five years of Carl's involvement as an \"academic citizen,\" and I write, in part, to bear witness to the power and integrity of his political, intellectual and moral presence, which represented the very best that our faculty had to offer in that time of troubles. Other than at the most abstract analytical level, it would surely be a mistake to think of politics and scholarship as two distinct domains in which Carl would or could function in a bifurcated manner. In real lifeâ€”real political life and, to Carl, real scholarly life as wellâ€”the two arenas were always intermeshed and intermingled. There were major conflicts between them, to be sure, yet never in the prosaic sense that one was somehow debasing or corrupting the integrity of the other. Here at Berkeley, politics â€” taken in the broadest meaning of dedication to the well-being of the polis and promotion of the just use of powerâ€” remained central to Carl's scholarly vocation, to both his research and his teaching, while intellectual values were no less central to his political concerns. He saw the university as a community where politics and scholarship not only could coexist, but could strengthen one another, though never without the presence of powerful and often unresolved tensions. When in 1969 he departed Berkeley for calmer waters if not greener pastures, I believe that though troubled by the experience of the previous years, he had not abandoned his guarded faith in the contentious but ultimately peaceful coexistence of these two worlds. As readers will learn from the oral history that follows, Carl joined our history faculty in the fall of 1960, having been attracted to the university while lecturing here in 1959 in Raymond Sontag's class, as noted in Jim's introduction. It should come as no surprise that very little time had passed before Carl began to involve himself in campus controversies. His left political background, after all, dated back to the rich and lively undergraduate political life at Columbia University in the early 1930s, but also, with a backward stretch, to 1919, his kindergarten year in New York, when this little son of a socialist banker had a near escape from \"campus discipline\" for singing a German song, Morgenrot. that offended the anti-German sensitivities of a patriotic kindergarten teacher. An active supporter of the controversial Henry Wallace campaign in 1948, and still an independent man of the liberal left in the sixties, Carl came to Berkeley at a time when the seeds of the 1964 conflict around free speech were already being planted by an unwitting combination of vestigial but still ix forceful McCarthyism, which often targeted the university, and a growing movement of protest and resistance among a resolute minority of faculty and students. Administrators, for their part, groped for intricate and often perplexing ways to resist recurrent onslaughts from the right, tacking now in the direction of significant resistance, now in the direction of outright surrender, at times even surrendering with pleasure . The most salient form such conflicts tookâ€”though more quietly, more subdued, more civilly, and on a much smaller scale than what soon would followâ€”was faculty resistance to the banning of controversial speakers from the campus. \"Controversial\" at the time was generally equated with \"Communist,\" though the term also extended to religious speakers (the banning of Malcolm X neatly combined both cases). In such situations, as Carl explains, it was facultyâ€”small groups, to be sure- more than students who took the lead in resisting suppressive measures, though faculty methods were characteristically unf lamboyant, superficially unconfrontational, and always imbued with academic politesse. Carl had barely been on our faculty a year, for example, before he joined a little group of civil libertarian professorsâ€” signif icantly, four of the eight participants would be active in the faculty \"200\" during the free speech crisis of 1964â€” who wrote to President Kerr and Chancellor Strong in 1961 to protest the suspension of SLATE, an activist student organization. Anticipating some of the issues that rocked the campus three years layer, Schorske and the others asserted that \"the interpretation of the State Constitution as restricting student political activity is questionable and should receive further study.\" At the same time, again anticipating Schorske 's disposition in 1964 and beyond, always characterized by a quest for cooperation, reasonableness and workable solutions, the letter generously acknowledged the \"liberalizing measures\" recently instituted by the university administration and its (partial) defense of the open forum from outside pressures. The concluding paragraph nicely illustrates the mood of faculty such as Carl who, anxious to encourage positive change, animated in a sense by \"civilizing mission,\" often found themselves face to face with administrators who did not always share their outlook. \"We have no wish to magnify disagreements,\" Carl and the others wrote. \"As faculty members, we try to make ourselves available to the problems of students, and we hope that a dialogue with you, from time to time, will be welcomed as creative and enlightening.\"1 A year later Carl was writing to the Academic Senate's Academic Freedom Committee in support of a faculty resolution taking issue with a 1 V. Kennedy, L. Lowenthal, C. Schorske et al. to Kerr and Strong, 23 Aug. 1961, Bancroft Collection (see Appendix B). university policy that prohibited faculty from citing their university affiliation when taking positions on non-university issues.2 Shortly thereafter, in 1963, now in his new capacity as history department chairman, Carl was again in the midst of his soon-to-be uninterrupted campus engagement, as he led the department's unsuccessful efforts to allow the historian Herbert Aptheker, a leading member of the Communist party, to speak on campus under the auspices of its graduate colloquium series. (The event did take place, but in the YMCA's Stiles Hall, off campus, with members of the department taking up a collection for the speaker's fee!).3 Then, in a related case again involving the appearance at a public gathering by another Communist speaker, Schorske took upon himself the burden of presiding over the meeting, an action that predictably led to angry letters from right-wing protesters while earning him the praise of the chancellor and the president (both of whom apparently expected some kind of disturbance that never materialized). In all these cases it was some combination of academic freedom, civil liberties and free speech that was at issue, principles that were always at the very top of Schorske 's list. As he put it in a letter to the general secretary of the University YMCA, \"the unfavorable returns [about his chairing of the meeting] are coming in; but no one interested in civil liberties can escape this sort of thing... (T]he price is pretty small considering what is at stake.\"4 The crisis Carl was faced with in the fall of 1964, while again revolving around issues of free speech and, more remotely, academic freedom, were of a scale that dwarfed the episodes just described, and, in sharp contrast, involved for the first time a mass student movement, the Free Speech Movement [FSM] . It would have gone completely against his grain for Carl to avoid engagement in this conflict. He plunged into it quickly enough, and of course had little trouble identifying with the causes of free speech and advocacy rights for students, their right to due process, fair disciplinary procedures, and, an often ignored but very serious consideration, respectful treatment. He viewed with growing dismay the heavy-handedness of administration policy, which radicalized the movement and turned a local conflict into one of statewide and ultimately national proportions. But at the same time, like so many other members of the faculty, including even most of those who shared his sympathy for the movement's aims, he was also disturbed by the prospect that the already burgeoning politicization of university 2 Schorske to Chairman of Committee on Academic Freedom, 11 June 1962, loc. cit. 3 Schorske to Chairman of Committee on Academic Freedom, 13 Mar. 1963, loc. cit.

The speaker this time was Albert Lima. xi life â€” and this was even before the \"Vietnamization\" of our campus --would have a negative effect on our academic milieu. Delighting in our students' desire to act like citizens, he believed in principle that this citizenship could be reconciled with academic decorum. He therefore spent much time and energy in quest of a solution to the free speech conflict that would speedily reduce the turmoil while upholding the values that underlay the struggle of the FSM. He welcomed the sound, but hoped perhaps for less of the fury. He was, as he once described himself in explaining his approach to history, \"at once wary Much of Carl's efforts during the FSM took place at meetings with like-minded faculty (several of them signers of the 1961 letter mentioned above) in Professor Charles Sellers' history department office. As a new, very junior member of the history faculty, I had of course met \"Professor Schorske\" several times by then, and already knew and admired his superb study of German Social Democracy; I actually first knew of him, and already admired him in 1961, when, as a Stanford graduate student, I saw an ad on the Bay of Pigs crisis that he and other history professors, mainly from Berkeley and Stanford, had placed in the Times. But it was at these little \"strategy meetings\" in Sellers' office that I really got to know Carl, to see him in action, to observe his craftsmanship and draftsmanship in helping to hammer out appropriate language for larger faculty meetings that we hoped would meet the principles of the FSM and still be acceptable to a large enough faculty majority to sway the administration, appealing to its better self. In fact, as I am sure Carl would acknowledge, none of the dedicated work of that little group achieved its purpose, at least not directly. The (Larry) Levine motionâ€”a futile but honorable attempt in November to move the faculty senate in the direction of the FSM positionâ€”and other comparable endeavors would fail to win over a faculty majority until a combination of patently vengeful disciplinary action by the then chancellor and a bold new act of civil disobedience by the FSM transfigured the atmosphere and created the climate for the assertiveness of the faculty 200 and finally for the stunning victory for free speech that took place in the Academic Senate on December 8. It is impossible, in my view, to designate a single author of the December 8 resolutions, which in some ways went significantly further than earlier draft resolutions prepared by faculty supporters of free 5 Carl E. Schorske, A Life of Learning (ACLS Occasional Paper No. 1, 1987), p. 3. That paper provides a useful supplement to the present oral history (see Appendix A). It is reprinted in Thinking with History: Explorations in the Passage to Modernism (Princeton, 1998), pp. 17-34. xii speech.' At one level the true authors of the resolutions were Mario Savio and other FSM-ers, who had long since laid out the basic principles that those resolutions followed. But the resolutions were also a permutation over time of language created at the meetings in Sellers' office, at November meetings of the Academic Senate, at the meeting of the 200 itself, and at the huge informal December 3 gathering of faculty in Wheeler Auditorium called by panicky faculty who had not been strong supporters of the FSM, but were now prepared to heed the views of the Schorskes, Stampps, Schachmans, Smiths, Sellers, Searles, Selznicks, Wolins, Lowenthals, and Levines, to name but a few. While it would take an archeologist to reveal all the layers of authorship-- broadly conceived they of course antedated the FSM itself, drawing upon a much longer history of campus battles for academic freedom and civil libertiesâ€”no one involved in this affair could deny that the hand and mind of Carl Schorske was a presence at virtually every stage of this evolving story. Although the Regents' official response to the December 8 resolutions fell short of a straightforward endorsement, and although there were to be on occasion temporary retreats from the robust enforcement of the resolutions, it is fair to say that a genuine victory for free speech principles had indeed been achieved through the combined efforts of an aggressive student movement and a faltering but ultimately responsive faculty. Yet one of the ironic, unforeseen (and, I certainly felt at the time, disheartening) consequences of the December 8 resolutions was the election of a faculty committee, the \"Emergency Executive Committee,\" which, though its purpose was to secure the acceptance of the resolutions by the president and Board of Regents, consisted almost entirely of faculty members who, though moderates by most standards, prior to the December turnaround had to varying degrees been hostile to the FSM and, more to the point, impatient with its faculty friends. To this outcome there was only one exception, Carl, who came in seventh in the field of seven elected members of that committee, the sole representative of the 200 to survive a well organized faculty backlash that swept the elections under the banner of order and stability. If the election results reveal a great deal about the complex blend of motives that went into the voting on December 8, Carl's (bare) survival as the sole representative of what I still refer to as \"our group\" (and, not incidentally, as the sole representative of the liberal arts) was certainly a tribute to the great respect for him 6 Strictly speaking the resolutions were the work of the Senate's Academic Freedom Committee, which formally introduced them at the December 8 meeting. But while I have no doubt that they were vetted and edited by that committee, it is equally clear that the committee was sticking very closely to a version of the text that emerged after much heated debate from the December 3 meeting at Wheeler Auditorium. xiii that prevailed even in sectors of the faculty whose views he did not share. As it turned out, Carl was able to cooperate effectively with the other members of the committee, which to a great extent did accomplish its primary goal, winning the Regents' (guarded) acquiescence to most of the December 8 package. Yet the spring of 1965 marked the beginning of several years of unrelenting tension and intermittent anguish for him, as he was prevented by his very nature from resisting the continuous call of duty, placing him in pivotal positions, constantly serving the campus community, always on call, and at times, as he puts it here, \"eaten up.\" He even joined the administration as special officer in charge of academic development for a brief period, but, as his interview reveals, he grew increasingly uncomfortable with what he saw as the rigid policies of the Roger Heyns administration. More and more Carl's engagement and commitment tore him away from the scholarship (though never from the teaching and teaching innovation) that he so adored. In his own words (though he refers here to his time as a graduate student at Harvard, not his time at Berkeley): \"When political passions run strong, the relation between one's obligations to the republic of letters and to the civic republic can become dangerously conflated.\"' In academic year 1968-69 escalating war and, as a consequence, more ugly and bitter campus confrontations added to these tensions and temporarily destroyed the \"delicate balance\" that had seemed to prevail after December 8.8 Carl then made his decision, without a trace of rancor, to leave us for Princeton, where he continued under more placid conditions to display the same qualities of scholar-citizen we at Berkeley had come to appreciate so much. I know that Carl continued to love Berkeley after he left and loves it to this day.

Schorske Carl E. Schorske, professor emeritus at Princeton University, spent only a decade, from 1960 to 1969, as a member of the UC Berkeley Department of History. But what a decade! and what an active member of the university community he was during his tenure on the Berkeley campus. Knowing that his account would add an important perspective to the history of those times, in 1996 we invited him to record his recollections as the fourth memoirist in the Department of History at Berkeley Oral History Series. Rather than trying to conduct a lengthy biographical oral history during Professor Schorske 's visits to the Bay Area, we focused on his experiences at Berkeley and his perspective on the social, cultural, and political shifts that characterized his decade here. For background on his family and education, his mentors at Columbia and Harvard, and his fourteen years of teaching at Wesleyan University, we have appended his Charles Homer Haskin Lecture, \"A Life of Learning,\" given to the American Council of Learned Societies in April 1987. The oral history begins with Professor Schorske 's introduction to Berkeley as a guest lecturer in Raymond Sontag's European intellectual history class in 1959. He describes being \"dazzled\" by the charged atmosphere of the large lecture hall and by the socially diverse student body of the public university. The following year he accepted the department's invitation to join its ranks as a full professor. His oral history records how he plunged into the life of the university, relishing the opportunities to exchange ideas with like- minded faculty in departments across the campus. He participated actively in the governance of the Department of History and was chosen as chair of the department just two years after his arrival at Berkeley. He provides significant recollections of fellow faculty members and of the social and intellectual atmosphere of the department. Soon after his arrival, Professor Schorske Joined faculty efforts to expand free speech for members of the university community. His oral history, and the appended documents, provide historians with an important record of faculty initiatives from 1961 to 1963 to broaden the rights of political expression within a public university, in an era when Communists were prevented from speaking on campus, as were candidates for public office of any persuasion. A substantial part of the oral history is devoted to the 1964-1965 Free Speech Movement and other student protests in the sixties. Professor Schorske discusses his role in events as a member of the Academic Senate's Emergency Executive Committee during the FSM, his XV thoughts about educational reform, and his reflections on the personal reactions of himself and fellow faculty to the enormous cultural changes of the time. All considered, with his characteristic intellectual breadth, within the context of \"how the republic of letters relates to the civil society.\" The interview sessions for the oral history were scheduled around two of Professor Schorske's visits to the West Coast, where he travels periodically as a member of the advisory boards of the Stanford Humanities Institute and the Getty Center for Art History and the Humanities, and for family vacations in Inverness on the Point Reyes Peninsula. The first session took place on October 17, 1996, in his hotel room in San Francisco. Although he and his wife had just arrived by plane from the East Coast, he was willing to sit down for nearly three hours of interviewing before going off to another engagement that evening. As a student in Professor Schorske's European intellectual history class in the early sixties, I recalled very well the charged atmosphere in his lectures and found that he brought that same excitement to our interview, despite his demanding schedule. Although he complains of his octogenarian memory, his intellectual and physical energy seems unabated. We were not able to meet again until May 5, 1997, this time in a seminar room of The Bancroft Library. The following day we completed our interviewing at the home of Robert and Carroll Brentano, history colleagues and friends from his time in the Department of History at Berkeley. The long hiatus between the first and the second interviews naturally created some disjointedness in the narrative. Issues covered hurriedly during our first meeting were revisited in the final two sessions. In the interim between October and May, Berkeley historian David Bellinger had contributed his ideas for areas to explore, which led to some backtracking and elaborating on subjects previously discussed. No attempt was made to integrate these two discussions during the editing process, since each had its own character and emphasis. After light editing, the transcripts of the three sessions went to Professor Schorske for his review. He expressed disappointment with the impressionistic nature of his recollections and the frailty of memory. He made a careful review of the transcript, clarifing some statements and adding considerable details. He checked recollections against documents in his files and contributed several important documents for appendices. In the end, he was persuaded to let the transcript stand without further alterations. We assured him that we would add the caveat that it provided a personal account, not a final, verified record of events; that along with other oral histories in the series it would enable future scholars to assemble from varying perspectives, in concert xvi with written documents, a sense of the life of the university and the discipline of history. The editing process took time, on both coasts. Other projects competed for oral history office staff time, and Professor Schorske was writing two books. \"Since the oral history is for eternal consumption, I count on your generous disposition to forgive my procrastination,\" he petitioned in one interchange. Editorial assistant Sara Diamond prepared the final version of the transcript and assembled the appended material. By summer of 1999, the project was ready for the eye of former university archivist James R. K. Kantor, ROHO's proofreader par excellence. Professor Reginald Zelnik, a Berkeley colleague also active in the political affairs of the campus during the sixties, and James Sheehan, professor of history at Stanford University and a former Schorske Ph.D. student at Berkeley, wrote the two introductions to the volume. We thank both men for their contributions. On behalf of future scholars, we also thank the Department of History for providing the core funding to make this oral history possible. Appreciation is once again due Carroll Brentano and Gene Brucker for initiating the series on the history of the Department of History and for their ongoing efforts in planning and securing support to continue it. Additional support came from the Bancroft Library's Free Speech Movement Archives project, funded by a generous donation from Berkeley alumnus Stephen M. Silberstein, and the Schorske volume will be a part of the Free Speech Movement Oral History Series. The Regional Oral History Office was established in 1954 to record the lives of persons who have contributed significantly to the history of California and the West. A major focus of the office since its inception has been university history. The series list of completed oral histories documenting the history of the University of California is included in this volume. The Regional Oral History Office is a division of The Bancroft Library and is under the direction of Willa K. Baum.

We're not going to start with your early background because we only have a three-hour session now. We want to talk about your coming to Berkeley, why you came and how you happened to make the change from Wesleyan. Schorske: Two things. The first is that I was actually courted by Berkeley's department well before I came. I came in 1960, but in either 1955 or 1956--it was probably '55, could have been '56--after my first book came out, I was given an invitation to come to look at Berkeley. I was then at Wesleyan; I was happy at Wesleyan. I was very suspicious of California because of the loyalty oath controversy, which was a very little time before. We're talking now late McCarthy era. McCarthy had already been broken by the time this invitation was issued. We had at Wesleyan two refugees from Berkeley. One was Charles Muscatine, who figures certainly in your oral histories, and the other was Tom [Thomas] Parkinson, both members of the English Department. Muscatine was a non-signer in the oath controversy, and Parkinson- -in the end he did sign, but he was an opponent. There were many people like that on the Berkeley campus. 'II This symbol indicates that a tape or tape segment has begun or ended. A guide to the tapes follows the transcript. Lage: They came to Wesleyan as a result of this? Schorske: Yes, but they came as visitors. Muscatine didn't know what he would do. In the end he went back because they changed the regulations. A number of other signers who resigned from Berkeley because they wouldn't sign the oath-- there were only twelve, I think, in allâ€”but several of them went back. They didn't take permanent positions elsewhere. Muscatine didn't have a permanent position with Berkeley either. As I sÂ«y, they were refugees, both these guys. I had a high impression of the scholarly quality of the university, but I was a small college teacher, and I really found I loved it. So I didn't have much will to move. The combination of the oath history and being way out there--! being an easterner born and bred--. Lage: You'd never lived on the West Coast, I assume. Schorske: Right, and I had never been in a state university. I had fear of it, partly because of the political vulnerability that Berkeley had manifested and seemed to manifest in a craven way, in the sense that they didn't fight back. Of course there were many places where nobody fought, so you never noticed it. Lage: Did your impressions come from Parkinson and Muscatine, or was it just known throughout the academic community? Schorske: No, no, it was diffuse. We had another member of my Wesleyan department, a wonderful person, who was actually a student of Ernst Kantorowicz, one of the non-signers. His name was Michael Cherniavsky in Russian history. We had other Berkeley people who were connected with this oath thing not as faculty members but as grad students. The main thing was that throughout the academic community, the California oath case was huge. It was the national case of greatest moment in the early fifties. 1 didn't need the presence of the refugees, in fact their presence was only a testimony to the quality of the intellectual life that was also at Berkeley, and I knew that. Anyway, I turned that first invitation down. Lecturing at Berkeley. 1959: The Excitement of the Public University Schorske: Then I came as a fellow to the Stanford Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. I came there for the year in 1959-60. One day I got a telephone call from Ray [Raymond] Sontag. He was one of the two Berkeley people- -Ray Sontag and Carl Bridenbaugh--who had courted me in '56 at an American Historical Association [AHA] meeting. Ray said he was going back to Washington for a couple of weeks on government business. Would I take his classes? He taught an intellectual history course at the time, and would I take over his classes and give the lectures, two lectures a week for two weeks? He was on the topic of Hegel, and it was something I knew about and liked. So I said, \"Sure.\" Of course I was fond of him becauseâ€”well, anyway, I knew him somewhat from before, when he tried to get me an instructorship in Princeton. That effort failed because of the anti-Semitism that then prevailed at Princeton. I was very glad to do the lectures in a way to repay him for having been influential in getting me the offer from Berkeley. I really went up for those two weeks just to lecture. I had friends here- -Henry May who was a strong friend of mine from graduate school, and Henry Nash Smith in the English department who was likewise a Harvard friend. I had already reknit ties with them after the war. Then, when I came to California, of course somehow we activated our relation. The main thing was that I came and I lectured to that class, and I was dazzled. It was such a wonderful experience. It was one of these big things--! think it was Dwindle Hall, one of the big lecture halls. It was certainly a big hall. I hadn't had at Wesleyan that kind of experience. I had lectured at Harvard also for a term, so I knew what it was like, but here it was in Berkeley. It was the same thing, where you really felt the electricity in the classroom. Then, there were Sontag1 s two teaching assistants. One of them was Jim [James J.] Sheehan, the fellow who just drove me here, who as you know is now at Stanford. He's been the department chairman there for years; he's not anymore. The other was Peter Loewenberg, who has become a leading psychohistorian and has been a pillar of the department at Los Angeles. They were Sontag 's two assistants. Loewenberg was the nephew of a Berkeley philosopher of the same name who was the major Hegel scholar in the United States. He was, however, a non-signer. He was a resister. After just one lecture on Hegel, Peter Loewenberg invited me to have dinner at his uncle's house. Lage : Was he also a Loewenberg? Schorske: I'm ashamed that I don't remember his first name [Jacob Loewenberg]. He wrote a kind of compendium of translations of Hegel's stuff with an introduction that was very well regarded. I had used his book in my course, actually. It was a coincidence that he was also one of the resisters in the oath controversy. So I had this very interesting evening at his house. Then I began to catch on that, oath controversy or no, this was really an exciting place. I loved the class, and the more it went on, the more I liked it. I mean we got on well. Lage: Did you find the undergraduate students at Berkeley to be more exciting? Schorske: Well, it's partly the mass. It's partly the mass. At Wesleyan, let's say, a big class, a really big class would be sixty people. Sontag was a very well-regarded lecturer and for good cause; his class was 200 or 230 people or something like that. So it was a big mass of people, and that gives you a sort of actor's satisfaction. You have a public to play to in effect, so there was some of that. I also felt the differentiation in the class, a social differentiation I had never experienced. I'd taught at Harvard and Yale for a term here and there but never with that social diversity, palpably the children of people from the Valley, some fraternity types, others very urban, all kinds of types in the class. That sociological mix I found intriguing. It wasn't pure urban, and it was certainly not pure rural. It was a state university's mix, and I had never experienced it. One couldn't experience it except in a few places like Michigan, Wisconsin, Berkeley, now probably in Texas. Usually you don't get that mixture of urban and rural, as well as different classes, different types of culture, really, that compose the nation. So that struck me. Then I really did a nervy thing. I called up my friend Henry May, and I said, \"I really have been snowed by these two weeks. If that job is still open and you people still want me. I'll take it.\" So, I was then invited--! think Ken [Kenneth M.) Stampp was chairman of the department, I'm not sure. Lage: I don't think so because he's never been chairman. He's always avoided it. Schorske: Oh, really? Is that right? Is he one of the people you've interviewed? Lage: Yes, I did. It might have been Delmer Brown. Schorske: No, he was not yet chairman, not then. It probably was George Guttridge, but never mind, I don't know. That wasn't so significant. The fact was that I was invited then to give a paper at the History Club or whatever it was that used to meet in the Alumni House. That was sort of a test, used when a department hired you anyplace. I got through, and then I was invited to come. Lage: There was a very positive response to that lecture, from what I've heard. Schorske: I know, there was. I'm sure I couldn't have been asked if it hadn't been because I'd already turned them down. You asked how I got here, and that was how I got here: via the Stanford Center and then this experience of lecturing and so on. Lage: And you came as a tenured professor. Schorske: I came as tenured--! had already gotten tenure at Wesleyan. Even the original offer was for tenure, and this time it was a full professorship which I then had. Settling In; Social Connections, and Thoughts on Catholicism and Academia Lage: Was your wife amenable to moving out? Schorske: Well, she was not that amenable. She became very engaged in Berkeley, but she was not that enthusiastic at first. It would have been easier if we'd gone to Stanford which was also a possibility. We didn't because--! mean, it would have been easier because our children found wonderful schools at Stanford. When we came to Berkeley, the situation was much graver. The high school was still a high school of quality, and I'm sure parts of it still are, but the new sociology of Berkeley had begun, and the cultural problem for our two children who were in junior highâ€”or one Just before junior high and one in junior highâ€”it was a terrible shock to come from Stanford to here. From Middletown [Connecticut] to Stanford was a step up both in intellectual quality of the schooling and in the easy middle-class socialization. It was easy, it was a suburb with high quality public schools. When we came here it was Willard Junior High [on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley]. It turned out to be a terrible school for our children, psychologically, and it wasn't so easy with high school either. I've often felt my children paid a big price for my job. Then very soon on top of it came the whole culture shift. That was also a price some of our children paid for my wanting to come here. That's another story. In any case, my wife certainly came cheerfully, and we had --again the reception from the people in and out of the History Department was just wonderful. It was just so natural. It wasn't because we were special, it was just naturally the way they behaved. The Brentanos [Robert and Carroll] found a real estate agent who was interested in architecture. I was just getting interested in architecture. He knew this town of Berkeley like the palm of his hand, and before we ever looked at anything, he told us about where the possibilities were in architectural termsâ€”what kind of a little enclave we wanted to live in. He told us who the leading architects of Berkeley were and what they had done (a few I knew but most I didn't). He was a knowledgeable, nice, wonderful man. Very quickly we were taken in. I think everybody who came to Berkeley had this experience. That was something I hadn't undergone and certainly not at Harvard, the university I knew best. They would put on a big show if you were invited, but it was formal, it was dinner parties. This was personal. This was individual people who wanted to make you at home, and they did. Lage: And was your wife swept into a social circle? Schorske: Oh, yes, definitely. That was easy, too, very easy. Then we had friends or attachments through peopleâ€” the Bouwsmasâ€” we hadn't really known them, but very quickly--. Martin Malia, too, became a good friend. He was a Catholic, my wife is a Catholic. Sontag was, too. At Wesleyan she was very much odd man out. In those days Jews had already gotten into universities, but for Catholics it was very difficult. Lage: You mean for Catholics to be accepted into academic life? Schorske: Into academic life, especially in the eastern private schools. They were Protestant establishments, and the Protestants had become tolerant toward Jews, but they found Catholics very hard to take, traditionally. Their tolerance for Catholics developed later because there was something deeply creedal and institutional that was offensive to the Protestant consciousness. It produced, especially in liberal academic intellectuals, a deep intolerance. Lage: That's very interesting. I don't remember having that discussed as much as, say, resistance to the Jewish entry into academic life. Schorske: No, it wasn't, but we went through it at Wesleyan, and I saw the anti-Catholic prejudice strongly at work at Harvard in the 1930s. Well, I won't spend my time on Wesleyan, but it was a problem. Jews had already been admitted to the faculty even before the war. After the war it was totally easy. Actually, Hitler's horror in a way really did absolutely in the end wipe out anti-Semitism in the American academic establishment and in general in the country. It was a huge turn. That same thing did not apply to Catholics. You must remember that Catholics also were seen as belonging to a rigid, doctrinal religion. You might be a Catholic mathematician and be reliable, but if you were a historian it was Just as bad as being a Communist, for if you were Catholic you were a prisoner of doctrine; the pope could tell you what to think, you know, and how to behave. I mean, I exaggerate slightly, but it was a problem, a real problem. Lage: But your wife didn't encounter that here. Schorske: No, and at Wesleyan as soon as the personal element came into play, Wesleyan was a wonderful place. She had never had any friendship problems or anything, but it was easier here at the beginning. The Brentanos were Catholic too. In California it made very little difference. We found that out in the year we were at the Center [at Stanford]. It was already clear. Even the relations between the clergy, the Catholic and the Protestant clergy, were so much better in California than in New York or Massachusetts or any of those places where they were terrible, holding each other at arm's length. Lage: More Vatican II-ism? Schorske: Before Vatican II. I mean these distances between the two faiths was so great before Vatican II and the ecumenical movement started by the Protestants. Well, that's enough of that. Entering the Intellectual Life of the Campus: The Arts Club and Other Interdisciplinary Connections Lage: Shall we move on to how you entered into the life of the campus? Schorske: Yes, if you like, yes. I would say there were a couple of points of entry for me. One of them was certainly intellectual because I rapidly discovered â€” and always felt it ever after-- the intellectual as well as social welcome mat of Berkeley. I don't know if it's still characteristic, but I really did think it was there. You didn't have to prove yourself, you didn't have to do anything. You were Just assumed to be here, so people were just naturally open. I found Henry Smith at a new level of intellectual engagement, and also in the English department, Mark Schorer, whom I had also known in Cambridge before the war slightly. I got to know him better, of course, here. Chuck Muscatine, Tom Parkinson--! mean, these were all well-established people in English. That was easy. Some of them belonged to something called the Arts Club; it's still going in Berkeley, 1 hope. Lage: Now tell me what that is. Schorske: The Arts Club was founded before World War 11 to introduce the arts, the creative arts, into the university. All over the nation a fight had to be fought to make the universities what they are today, really committed to the creative arts. They are training grounds in the arts to some extent. Certainly they have programs in creative writing, in painting and things like that, not just in art history or literary history, but doing it. Lage: Just as an aside I'll tell you that the art practice program at Berkeley now is very much threatened to the point of near extinction, 1 understand. Schorske: Well, you know that that's also true in public schools at much lower levels, sometimes disastrously, like in New York where art is one of the great avenues of advancement for people of color and immigrants who are good at the visual arts and at music. We had special high schools in New York for this, not to mention kindergarten programs and God knows what all. The last to come on board is the first to be thrown overboard, and that's what's happening. I'm horrified to hear that art programs are threatened in Berkeley. The Arts Club was originally formed to expose and promote them, did that, and there were fine people in it. Lage: Who were the active club members? Schorske: By the time 1 joined it, the number of members was small, but they were very active and a real presence. The man who can tell you most about that, to my knowledge, is Charles Muscatine. Bill Fretter in the Physics Department was in it, then there was a wonderful philosopher who is still a friend of mine, he's at Harvard â€” Stanley Cavell. He was teaching here, and in that club. With my son, 1 audited his course in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations â€” an intense and deeply disturbing intellectual experience. Joe [Joseph] Kerman, who is very important in my life, important in the sense that his workâ€”well, Ann, you probably read him in my course, actually. It was a book of Kerman 's called Opera as Drama, a marvelous book, sort of opera through the ages to teach people who are not themselves musically educated what the relation is between music and theater, plot and music--it was a terrific book. He's a marvelous scholar, another one. I was getting interested in putting music into my own research, so this was important for me. There was also [T. J.) Kent, who was a city planner here, and Bill [William] Wurster, who was the dean of the College of Environmental Design, and Leo Lowenthal in sociology. These were peopleâ€”many of them, like the aesthetician Stephen Pepper, had been years at Berkeley, and they freely took in newer or younger people. In any case, there I met the whole interdisciplinary crowd. We had agreeable dinners, and we read papers to each other, giving us all feedback. Lage: So this was related to the research you were doing. Schorske: Much of it was, but more: it was related to my whole intellectual life, my teaching, too. My teaching did involve more media than the printed word, especially as I got deeper into the nineteenth century. My historical mission became, then, introducing the arts as a constituent of history- -not simply as an illustration of a history which is essentially political by tradition, but as a constituent in socio-cultural history. The people I met in the faculty outside the history 10 department made a wider, humanistic discourse possible. I had it at Wesleyan, where I had a lot of very good colleagues, but here there were many more of them, and it was so easy to open the network into the German department, for example, where I got, you might say, tutoring in Austrian literature from Heinz Politzer or people in architecture who could really tell me new things . Lage: Did you do that more than most historians, do you think? Schorske: Yes, but that's because my problems were interdisciplinary. It was also because I had good connections here in the first place. I hate to say it, but so much in academic life is dependent on connections. It's just as bad as in the corporate empires. \"Who do you know?\" These faculty people, very like- minded to myself, could open new vistas and in a way lead me to the intellectual resources of the university, to have converse and socializing with its people. So it was partly my interest, but I have to say it's more entering into a congenial community. Nobody planned it, nobody on either end was planning anything, but the structure of the place was porous and welcoming. If you put those two things together, and add my need for interdisciplinary conversation in my work, that became important. The Postwar Generation's Interest in Intellectual History Schorske: The other thing of importance to my scholarship was the Department of History itself. I somewhat disagree with Gene Brucker's picture of its character. He separates the generations: the pure political narrative historians from the social historians. At one level he's right, but the big wave of the generation I belong to, just slightly older than Gene's, five to fifteen years olderâ€”start ticking it off: Henry May, Martin Malia, Joe Levenson in Asian History, who was a marvelous man, Bill Bouwsma, Nick Riasanovsky--all these people were intellectual historians. It was a kind of a wave of intellectual history that swept the American historical profession in the forties and fifties. It isn't that we couldn't teach something else, but our commitment was very much in that vein. Lage: I think he was talking about the generation before you as being more focused on political history. I'm surprised that Sontag was teaching intellectual history. 11 Schorske: And he did it for modern Europe as a whole, but with great discomfort. He did it because he thought it was a field that needed doing, now high on the profession's agenda, and the fact that people like all those I've mentioned were coming along. The talent in history, which very soon went to social history, at that time was going into intellectual history. Ray felt the need for American students to be exposed to modern intellectual history even though he was not an expert in it. He offered the course in the way that in my time I've taught Greek history- -we do the things we sometimes do because an institution has a lack, and you do the best you can. He didn't want to do that forever; he wanted the position filled, and so did the department . So they hired a whole bunch of people. Tom Kuhn, the historian of science, was another who became a real good friend. That was a new tendency in the earliest postwar generation; we flocked to intellectual history. It became a really live and active field. It was still happily wedded to social history, not the intense archival social history that, say, Gene Brucker did, which is a very special kind. Nevertheless, we had a lot of that too. The American progressive tradition combined social and intellectual history in a way that I still regard as--you know, that's where I live. Social history and intellectual history both have gone in other, autonomous directions, but we could talk about that some other time. Intradepartmental Politics; Thomas Kuhn. Carl Bridenbaugh, Raymond Sontag Lage: Would you have more to say about Tom Kuhn? He does come up quite a bit--you'll see when you see the videotape from the meeting [history department colloquium on the history of the Department of History] that he's talked about. Schorske: Yes, well, I'm sure that he's talked about. On the one hand, we all recognized that this was a very first-class guy. I don't think anybody had the idea that he was the world-class scholar which he is now recognized to have been. There are some historical reasons for this recognition that has come to him in the last twenty years. Among us faculty people in history, he certainly was thought to be first-class. There were a lot of departmental troubles that revolved around him. There were a lot of troubles for Tom that revolved 12 around his attempt, a valiant attempt, to be both a historian and a philosopher of science. In the end, he had to be content to be labeled a historian of science, though in his very last years, he had turned more and more to philosophy and had developed that. In the philosophy department here he had, by his own account, real foes. I'm not knowledgeable about all those quarrels. We in history tended to support him, but then we had a big crisis aboutâ€”that you probably have been told about-- about his promotion to full professor, I think it was to full. He already was associate, I think; I'm not sure. It was the thing that led in the end to Carl Bridenbaugh's resignation because Bridenbaugh didn't think he should have that job. Lage: Tell me what to recall about that. Schorske: Well, that was true. In any case, there was a complicated reason for that. Bridenbaugh had his own candidate, Hunter Dupree, a competent man, too, but Bridenbaugh faced in Kuhn supporters a very solid phalanx of the people who had been his ally in so many things in the earlier quarrels, most of which were over by the time I got here. In any case, he was a disappointed man that Tom was promoted over his negative assessment. Lage: Yet history would certainly vindicate that decision. Schorske: It certainly would, and it is not in denigration of Dupree, who also had a professorship here but could not compete with Kuhn in sheer intellectual brilliance. Who among us could? I'm not going to go into the politics because partly I distrust my memory of the department's politics even more than elsewhere. All of this is tricky. I like it better when you can go back and forth to documents and correct yourself. In any case, Hunter Dupree has had a good career as a historian of American science. In the end, both left: Bridenbaugh in 1962, Dupree in 1968. They went to Brown along with Bryce Lyon (1965] and Perry Curtis [1975]. Bridenbaugh went first and brought the others after him. I think that's the way it went.' 2 For more on this incident, see oral history with Kenneth Stampp in this series, and David Bellinger's \"Afterword\" in History at Berkeley; A Dialogue in Three Parts (Berkeley: Center for Studies in Higher Education, UC Berkeley, 1998). 13 Lage: Then shortly after Bridenbaugh left, he made that kind of amazing presidential address to the American Historical Association. Schorske: Oh, he did that after he left? That was a horror, yes, I remember that, I remember it vividly. It was an attack on Oscar Handlin, but in a form which suggested that children of recent immigrants lacked the sensibility to write American history. II Schorske: 1 can only say that in all these things, intradepartmental fights are like family fights. It's very difficult to control the ill effects of these fights. Bitternesses arise which turn judgments sour. This is a grave difficulty. Bridenbaugh was never my kind of historian. I learned from his kind of history, and I respected what he did. I never liked him much as a person. That was the way it was. I know he was a very valuable member of the department and did a lot of good work. In the end, the people then who became disappointed in his behavior over Kuhn would begin to see that he was flawed in other ways. When he made that terrible speech in the AHA, it was like a vindication of the bad opinion that was formed of him by people who could not accept his view on something else. So you get a general drop in his reputation that perhaps went too far. I don't know. Unlike many of my colleagues I was attached to Sontag as a person. On national politics we disagreed basically; there we had very little in common, very little. I knew that he was a wonderful teacher, and he did things in the department nobody else did. One of them was to foster connections with the Pacific Coast Historical Association. Now this may have changed, but he was a vigorous protagonist of that organization. Maybe a year after I came--no, it could even have been beforeâ€”on his invitation I went to one of these conferences. It was in Utah. There I met people who would not have had the money to go to the national conventions. They could only get this far. They could only go where they could sleep in dormitories on the cheap because they were in small, bad-paying little colleges scattered all up and down the West Coast and on into the mountain country. The importance of this meeting for those people was huge. They were drinking at the professional font of history, and therefore the responsibility of people who had connections with the national or international guild seemed to be enormously Lage: important. Sontag took that responsibility very seriously and tried to enlist people in that enterprise. That's the kind of citizenship you don't find very often because most university people say, \"Why do I want to go to meet the guys from Slippery Rock State Teachers College? That isn't where I live, that isn't where 1 move.\" He had that service orientationâ€”he was the same way towards students. I know he played favorites among students. But he rescued people for intellectual life that would have gone down the drain if he hadn't put the investment in. He had these admirable qualities as a person. Okay, so his politics- including his departmental politics which then became very suspect and distrusted because he belonged to the old guard that Gene Brucker describes in his lecture, he was a leader of it. I felt, well, okay, so he has his flaws maybe, but don't exaggerate to the point where you lose the huge services that this man is doing for history as a profession, as a constituent in the communal life of the country. He's doing something for it. He was another wonderful lecturer who attracted students into the discipline of history. Schorske: Indeed he was, terrific. I'm a profiteer from his generosity, which of course contributes to my positive attitude. I told you about the two people who were his assistants when I came to this university, James Sheehan and Peter Loewenberg. The next year, when I joined the faculty, the first thing he did was, he persuaded these two guys to leave him. They were going to write their theses with him. He was the man in German intellectual historyâ€”they were working in German history. He persuaded them to sign up with me. In other words, he gave me two of his very best Ph.D. candidates. I always felt it was a welcoming present. He never said anything about it, but I knew that that was what was going on. A Vocational Mission and a Humanistic View of History Lage: This takes us a little off track, but was the opportunity to work with graduate students another thing that you appreciated? Schorske: Well, I had to learn that slowly. I didn't appreciate it in principle. I felt very strongly, and it's one of the reasons 15 that I favored undergraduate work in my own vocation for so long, I felt that you really formed people in terms of their intellectual outlook when they were undergraduates. You have the most impact in opening them to possibilities in the pre- professional moment. When they are grad students, and you are taking them on as serious professionals, your first duty is to equip them with the tools of the craft--teach them clear thinking, rigorous methods, the arts of demonstration, and, if possible, encourage their imaginative initiative. Fundamentally, the graduate student is somebody who has already made a kind of choice for himself, and he has the parameters of his intellectual categories fairly well-defined. So I was a little leery about being a graduate teacher. In the end, of course, 1 came to love it, and at the end of my career at Princeton, I was a really good graduate trainer, better I think than I had been at Berkeley, though 1 had marvelous students here. I enjoyed the students, but I don't think it was my real mission. My real mission was more as an undergraduate teacher, and I think I had that in common with Sontag, probably, more than with most other colleagues in the department. Professionalization, as was correctly observed by Brucker in his excellent lecture: that was the name of the game. So saying, \"What are the newest methods?\"--that was the way most people introduced students to historiography. I always taught it as historiography, not as a historical methods class, not as, \"What is going on in the game today?\" It was always, \"What are the large views of history, how have they evolved in relation to the historical context in which those historians conceived their mission and wrote their books?\" I was making a history out of history, not dealing so much with the methods and the latest cutting edge of the discipline, but going back in time to see how the nature and function of history as thought evolved in relation to history as actuality. Woodrow Borah and I were at opposite ends of this, and I respected him a lot. He was a real methodologist , but he and I for a whileâ€”we each had a section of the graduate historiography course. Everybody could do it their own way, and many people have done it since in various ways, I'm sure- he was much more interested in the latest developments in historical thought and methods, and I was much more interested in the evolution of the idea of history and what historical works showed about culture and society. It's just a different point of view. Partly it's the difference between a social scientist and a humanist. History 16 lies between. Some of us lean more to the one, some to the other. The best of us can do both, but very few are the best of us. So, those are the poles. Lage: You put yourself more towards the humanist? Schorske: I would be more on the humanist side, yes. I used to be more on the social science side, but when social science began to go behaviori'.st and used natural scientific models, I began to withdraw from that form. I would have been fully on board with, let's say, Gene Brucker's kind of history, social history, but I wouldn't have been with other forms, such as quantitative history and things like that. Woodrow Borah was into that with great results. Lage: You talked a little bit about factions in the department. Is there more to say there, how it broke down? Was there more than politics that made the factions? Schorske: Yes, I would say--let's put it this way. On the whole, I felt that the intensity of factional feeling was kept under control. There were crucial decisions about tenure appointments where it would necessarily surface. The problem was the aftermath of those decisions, so that one side would consider the other to be manipulative and so on. Lage: Would they surface over, What kind of history do we want here at Berkeley? Or, Is this radical coming into our department? Schorske: I know of only one case, that of Richard Drinnon, where a political radical was denied tenure [ 1959-1960] .' I think that that case could be--and wasâ€”decided in terms other than the candidate's radicalism. One of the problems with anybody who is a deviant, whether they're politically radical or whatever they are, is that there are people who would make the decision because of the deviance but who would justify it in terms of scholarly or teaching inadequacy. That's one way. The opposite is equally true. There are people who would be so partisan that they would overvalue a candidate's scholarly accomplishments- -you know. Anyway, the thing is that politics enters the equation, but in my opinion, the department didn't succumb to that type of thing, either in this case or in any other that I recall. God knows when I came I already had a record as a radical because I worked for Henry Wallace. Kenneth Stampp was appointed in this department; he had a similar record. Most importantly, after I left the department overwhelmingly supported Reginald Zelnik for tenure when, I believe, there was opposition to him 3 See the oral history with Kenneth Stampp in this series for a fuller account of this incident. 17 at the regental level for his identification with the New Left students. Involvement in Civil Libertarian Issues Lage: Schorske : Lage: Schorske: Lage: Schorske: Lage: Schorske: Tell me about your background because we've got to pick up on your own political views. Well, okay, I mean my background--f irstly, as I said, I was a Wallace supporter, serving on the Connecticut state board of that movement. In the thirties I had been a left-wing isolationist, never a communist, but an isolationist--! sent you that little biographyâ€”because as a child of German extraction the experience of World War was burned into my childhood consciousness. [See Appendix A) My father was both a banker and a socialist, a very odd combination. I had the deepest suspicion of world politics and also, therefore, tremendous interest in it. I had left-wing proclivities but then mixed them very oddly with pacifism. (This is still true, although there is no left to go to anymore.) Ken Stampp had this similar background, banker, but he was a German. His father wasn't a He was a Wisconsin German, that's right; I hadn't ever put this together, of course you're right. His father didn't come from an elite cultural or social group. My father didn't come from an elite group, but he moved into it. He was not college educated. The fact is that he was a 19th century type, an autodidact of great intellectual acquirement. Anyhow, Ren and 1 had some similar experience except Ken also came from a Lutheran background, right about that. I think I'm It's Protestant, but I don't think it was Lutheran. It's Protestant, maybe not Lutheran. He came of a very hard moralistic school, and I was not trained that way. My parents were much more modulated. My father was an atheist, but my mother was Jewish, he was gentile. They didn't--how shall I put it?--they did not inculcate moral rigidities. They were more flexible, perhaps more aesthetic. That sometimes modulatesâ€”morals and aesthetics don't necessarily go hand in 18 hand, they can go at cross purposes sometimes, know how we got off on this . Anyway, I don't Lage: This is why one thing leads to another. We were talking about the makeup of the department, the political factions, and I wanted to get your political background as well. Schorske: My political background was that; plus, of course, in the McCarthy period, like every just plain liberal, if you were a serious liberal, thtn you had to get into the business of the defense of communism, in a certain senseâ€”not communism itself, but of Communists whose freedom of speech and even livelihood were being arbitrarily threatened or withdrawn. One of my first political involvements, thanks to Ken Stampp and Henry Smith, was with the ACLU activities. I don't remember whether I was a member of ACLU or not, but I can tell you that they got into one issue after another, the same group of people. I was astonished to find in my documents how far back the group with whom I became associated in the FSM crisis had been working together on other free speech questions from way back--1961 and probably before. Lage: The academic freedom and.... Schorske: There was Slate, I don't know if you know about the banning of Slate. That was the first one I was involved with. I never had done this stump speaking. I think Kenneth got me involved in that. Lage: And did you do stump speaking? Schorske: I remember only one occasion. In those days our Hyde Park was not on Sproul steps. There was an oakâ€”beautifully planted inside Sather Gate, near Wheeler Hallâ€” an oak, I hope it still stands, in a kind of concrete planter. That was a place where you'd get up and make speeches at lunchtime. So I remember giving a speech at lunch. In fact, there was more to it than that. Political Tolerance within the History Department, the Nature of the Discipline Schorske: Now you were talking about the department, though. I never felt the splits in the department deeply. We could have disagreements about politics, but on the whole I don't think of 19 the department as ever factionalized by politics, even if there was the case I mentioned of the American historian, Richard Drinnon, who is the biographer of Emma Goldman, who was denied tenure. There was a divisionâ€”some of the people may have voted just because of his politics. He was a leader in the movement against capital punishment, revolving around the Chessman case. I wasn't personally involved in that. Lage: I think Ken Stampp discussed hin, too. Schorske: Ken was close to him. Lage: And there was some question as to whether he was academically up to snuff, also. Schorske: Yes, there was. Did Ken raise it that way? Lage: Yes. Schorske: 1 think Ken favored his appointment, that was my recollection, but he would give you the right answer on that. He was most favorable to him partly because they were such close political colleagues. I wasn't that close to him personally, but I liked him very much. Anyway, the long and short, I think that was the only case where even a suspicion could be aroused that there was political prejudice as a factor in professional decisions. When I came along, nobody raised it about me, I'm sure. Henry May knew all about my political past such as it was, and other people, Henry Smithâ€”all the people at Harvard knew that I had been active in the interventionist-isolationist debate, that 1 was a leftist of sorts. I never felt any prejudice in the department about politics any more than I felt it about being Jewish. I don't think the department really acted that way. Lage: It wasn't an issue on departmental, professional matters? Schorske: No, no. I can tell youâ€” I've said it a million times with deep satisfaction. The terrific experience of the departmental ethos was during the FSM when political splits developed that were on-campus issues but with national resonance. Even then, it was a matter of great pride to me, and I'm sure to people who were miles away from me politically, that the History Department provided leadership for a variety of group positions on the spectrum of campus politics. Yet the same people who were opponents on the senate floor would divide differently over the decisions about history in the departmentâ€” on appointments, promotions, departmental policy, hiring, 20 committees, anything. Campus political orientations would be put aside in department meetings; you would be there because you were a group of professionals committed to your own subject and your department. Lage: Do you have an explanation for that because it wasn't true in all departments â€” sociology andâ€” Schorske: I have an explanation, 1 have a very simple, primitive explanation. History is a very ancient discipline. History can ill-afford, and every decade shows it more, to assume that it will ever create a full consensus of historical understanding. It isn't possible. Look, we're not as old as Methuselah, we're not as old as the Jewish race, but we are old enough to have known that people who fervently believed in the truth of one set of meanings in history have been superseded again and again by people with totally different ideas. The \"cutting edge\" is suspect in history because we know from experience that it will soon prove ephemeral. It too will vanish. You know, when you get to be older, you realize that you, too, have vanished--! mean that your works will dieâ€”or, at best, will be absorbed into the stream of historical thought. The work that one day is the rage, the next day it's old hat. Historians are, I think, much more aware of transience than social scientists. That's the way it is. I feel that the historian's skeptical sensibility has tended to make them more catholic. Their judgements about people in the profession should not be derived from the opinions they hold, the faith they are committed to, the politics they pursue or things of that sort, for they do not constitute a good basis for professional judgement. It's too uncertain. If a person looks as though he's got a great faith or general idea, and he's interpreting history by means of it, just because you don't share the great idea, that doesn't mean he isn't doing something really creative and important in his historical work. Fine history can be written with ideas and values we may not share. Look at Thucydides or Ranke! Lage: Why doesn't a discipline like sociology share this? Schorske: That's the second point. It often does, but its belief in itself as a science causes difficulties. I've been very involved in this quite lately because I've been running the project in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a history of the development of academic culture since World War II, the last fifty years. We've only studied four disciplines (history is not one of them). We didn't take sociology either; we took political science. 21 I can tell you that there is one theme that comes up in the fifties: the use of the scientific model. If you look at the political science department in the crisis of FSM, and the campus upheaval, it is split, and so is sociology, to a large degree on the lines of methodological commitment. The people who are working firmly within the scientific model are on the right side of the political spectrum. The people who are either descriptive of social inequities, social suffering and so on, where you've already got the intrusion of some kind of ethical norm into the definition of the scholarly problem, those people are likely to be on the left of the spectrum. In sociology, it certainly worked that way. Kingsley Davis in sociology, a master of demographic sociology; Charles Clock, who did survey researchâ€”these men brought new statistical power to their discipline. They were very conservative people in campus affairs. I've never figured out this whole taxonomy psychologically. There are different reasons for different groups, surely there must be, but in political science, too, the correspondence between attitude in campus politics and scholarly method was palpable. Lage: They are still a very split department from what I understand. Schorske: The people who committed themselves to the scientific method at the moment when it became the thingâ€”the behavioralists in political science â€” assumed responsibility for a certain predictive capacity. They became very suspicious of traditional political philosophy and the intrusion of its normative externalities into the business of scientific hypothesis formation and testing. The problem with testing is it's always based on regularity and repetition. If something comes along, like the nineteen- sixties cultural revolutionâ€” which nobody expected, nobody could have anticipated, this explosion; or the race problem-- with a scientific predictive mechanism, you couldn't do that because you're always working with the existing reality. Hence the future is a closed book to you except insofar as you think you can extrapolate. A new situation challenges your very method, your scientific ego. Lage: The 1960s may have thrown them more, then. Schorske: It threw them more. I think it really threw them more, throughout the country, not just in Berkeley. When I look at the Aaron Wildavskys and others, who were that side of political science at Berkeley, they were the people who felt most outraged by the student movement. 22 Now there was another group that was very close always to governmental policyâ€”Paul Seabury, Robert Scalapino, etc. --it was also on the right in the university crisis and on the Vietnam War. They were descriptive in their approach to politics. It was the [Sheldon] Wolins, Hanna Pitkin, [John] Schaar--it was a cluster of people, actually they came to center around Wolin--who were in the tradition of philosophical political theory. Schaar was an Emersonian. Wolin was a mixture of classical and Old Testament scholarship with the great books of political science â€” from Plato to Tocqueville and Hannah Arendt. He became a very close friend of mine and a collaborator on the left in the university crisis. Anyway, those divisions in method that reenforced the political split we never had in history; and I always felt that made life possible. One could go back to the history department feeling reasonably happy about the way intellectual respect and humility blunted the cruel edges of political division. Lage: So you think it's the nature of history more than the social relationships and the culture of the department? Schorske: I don't want to say that it's \"more than,\" but that it is a factor I would certainly say, and it is not often noticed. As I remember it, in the chemistry department there was one personâ€”there was one person who was on the left, he was all alone. Although everybody liked him. Physics wasn't so, it was split. There are different kinds of physicists, and I don't know how much a taxonomy of methodological analysis could be co-related with a taxonomy of political attitude there. Lage: Maybe theoretical versus experimental physicists. Schorske: I do not know. I really don't know enough about it. 1 can think of a few examples that would lead one to that view, but that would take more looking. As you say, social factors enter in. What place does the department have in the university councils? Does it have a strong ego or a weak ego as a consequence? Where is it in the national roster? That can also affect people's conservatism or radicalism. Lage: What I'm also thinking, Just very much more simplyâ€” what kind of social interaction is there between the members? The development of "
