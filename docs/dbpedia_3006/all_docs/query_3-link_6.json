He studied at Cambridge University in England for a year and in 1937 began his career in physics at the University of California-Berkeley. In the summer of 1938 he married Elizabeth Jane Little.\n\nUpon receiving his Ph.D., he taught in the UC-Berkeley physics department, was appointed assistant professor in 1943 and full professor in 1951, and from 1955 to 1962 was chairman of the physics department. He worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II, continued nuclear studies with various successors of the cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory until his retirement in 1980, and helped establish the distinguished visitor lecture program at the university, which continues today.
