        "text": "Are you an EPFL student looking for a semester project?\n\nWork with us on data science and visualisation projects, and deploy your project as an app on top of GraphSearch.\n\nLearn more about Graph Apps.\n\nLindsay Helmholz (November 11, 1909 – March 17, 1993) was an American physicist who participated in the Manhattan Project during World War II that created the atomic bomb. He earned a PhD in chemistry at Johns Hopkins University before studying under Linus Pauling at California Institute of Technology and becoming a professor at Dartmouth College. After World War II, he joined the faculty at Washington University in St. Louis where he continued his work with X-ray diffraction and retired in 1978. Lindsay Helmholz was born in Chicago on November 11, 1909, the son of Henry Helmholz and his wife Isabel Lindsay. He had two brothers, Henry Frederic and August Carl Helmholz, and a sister, Margaret. He entered Cornell University in 1926, and graduated two years later. He then went to Johns Hopkins University, where he submitted his PhD thesis on \"Lattice energies of rubidium bromide and sodium chloride and electron affinities of their halogens\" in 1933, writing under the supervision of Joseph E. Mayer. He was one of the few students of Mayer who was an experimental rather than a theoretical chemist. He investigated the Born–Haber cycle in order to determine the electron affinity of fluorine. Helmholz was a National Research Council postdoctoral fellow from 1934 to 1936, and he studied crystallography at the California Institute of Technology, working under Linus Pauling. After his fellowship ended, he became an instructor there. Pauling attempted to secure Helmholz a more permanent position, at Duke University. He wrote to Paul Gross at Duke, describing Helmholz as \"one of our best men.\" Unsuccessful in this attempt, he then wrote to Elden B. Hartshorn at Dartmouth College: Dr. Helmholz is a pleasant and cultured young man and is married to a pleasant and cultured young woman. His father is head of the pediatrics division of the Mayo Foundation at Rochester. This approach was ultimately successful, and Helmholz moved to Dartmouth College in 1941 as an assistant professor. He created his own X-ray apparatus in order to continue his research into crystallography."
