Institutional History

Abstract

Formed in 1873, the Physics Department at the University of California, Berkeley has been home to numerous discoveries in the physical sciences. It is home to 7 Nobel laureates in physics and was a part of such important work as the development of the atomic bomb, cyclotrons. It has been in charge of Lick Observatory, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
