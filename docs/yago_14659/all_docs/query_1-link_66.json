All thanks to the collaboration with our #HR team and 10 different departments across our organization. 😄😄👏🏼👏🏼 MTR is deeply committed to creating a #diverse and #inclusive workplace where everyone can thrive, and the EmpowerZ program is our way of turning that commitment into action. The response has been nothing short of incredible - over 130 applications! That's a testament to the amazing talent out there, and I'm grateful to the #departmentheads, #mentors, #supervisors, and #buddies who came together to make this program a reality.💪🏼💪🏼 We are honored to have our #CEO Jacob, Corporate Affairs and Branding Director Linda Choy, Capital Works Director Carl Delvin, and Legal & Governance Director Gill Meller joining us to officially kick off this 1-year journey. A big, big shoutout to our supporting organizations - your partnership and guidance have been invaluable: CareER Association Equal Opportunities Commission Hong Kong Network for the Promotion of Inclusive Society The Hong Kong Council of Social Service (HKCSS) 香港社會服務聯會 (社聯) The Zubin Foundation SENsational Foundation WEDO GLOBAL Special mention to #HKCSS's \"Professional Traineeship Program for Ethnic Minorities,\" for giving us the inspiration for the program!

Their unique perspectives will help us foster an even more inclusive and innovative MTR. 😊😊 This is just the beginning, my friends.

This momentous event signifies a significant stride towards our unwavering commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace. 🌟 Huge kudos to our exceptional #HR team— Doreen Siu, Emily Chan, Mandy Sau, Stella, Janet and Veronica for spearheading this resounding success. Their passion and unwavering dedication in promoting #diversity and providing #equalopportunities for all candidates have been truly inspiring. It is through their vision and relentless efforts that we have established a platform where talents from diverse backgrounds can come together and #thrive. 😊😊 Stepping into the Kowloon Mosque, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of potential candidates who expressed their interest in exploring careers with MTR Corporation Limited 香港鐵路有限公司. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to our #ESGProjectAllies, The Zubin Foundation, for conducting insightful interview workshops to support the on-site interviews. A special shout-out goes to Marlie Fong Binta Rai Khan Ajaz for their invaluable support! 👏🏼👏🏼 My sincere thanks to Chief Imam & Mufti Muhammad Arshad, Mr. Saeed & Mr. Qamar for sharing precious photos and narratives of the Mosque, even before the birth of MTR.

Looking ahead, I am filled with immense anticipation for the positive #impact this day will have on our organization. Together, we will forge an even more inclusive workplace where every individual feels deeply valued, respected, and empowered to unleash their utmost potential! 😄😄 #DEI #Diversity #Equity #Inclusion #ESG\n\n🚀🌟 Will AI be the catalyst for women's increased participation in the Hong Kong workforce? 🌟🚀 When I first received this mind-boggling challenge from TWF three weeks ago during our intro call, I had no idea what I was getting myself into! As a #MaleAlly from MTR Corporation Limited 香港鐵路有限公司, I decided to step up and participate in this debate to push myself and dive deeper into the topic of gender equity. But let me tell you, I was questioning my sanity at that very moment as this will be my first public English debate ever in my life! Time flew by, and before I knew it, the big day arrived—the day of the debate. Alongside my incredible teammates Justin Bonnett 博家田 and Garkay Wong (and of course, #ChatGPT), we practiced and brainstormed various arguments. And you know what? I learned more than I could have ever imagined! 😊😊 Those three minutes on stage felt like a mere blink of an eye. And it was during the fascinating Q&A session that my mind truly ignited with profound thoughts. Even after the event, I couldn't stop pondering over the topics we discussed. It was an experience that left an indelible mark on me. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the The Women's Foundation Male Allies Hong Kong TWF Mentoring Programme for Women Leaders team for organizing such an extraordinary event. With over 90 registrations, it was a testament to the importance of the subject. I not only learned from the reference materials but also embraced the power of debating with my teammates, listening to the opposition's arguments, and engaging with the vibrant participants. What an unforgettable journey! 👏🏼👏🏼 I must confess that after the event, my hope for a brighter future skyrocketed. And you know what? We even found #commonground with the #opposition team—we all agreed that #humanbeings hold the key to a more #equitable future! 😄😄 Now, I'm eagerly looking forward to next year's debate. Let's keep pushing boundaries and shaping a future where everyone, regardless of gender, thrives! 🌍💪 Fiona Nott Sam Gourlay Ewan McAllan Amy V.

This platform served as a catalyst for the exchange of ideas, exploration of innovative strategies, and the formation of collaborations to drive positive change. 😄😄 Here are my key takeaways from the summit: 1. Approach \"Inclusive language\" as if learning a second language, embracing curiosity and learning without the fear of failure. 2. True inclusivity is always rooted in intention, context, and delivery. It requires a holistic understanding of the diverse perspectives and experiences of others. 3. Purpose and meaning in our work play a vital role in maintaining mental well-being and happiness, especially in challenging environments. My heartfelt gratitude goes to SCMP for extending the invitation and affording me the opportunity to serve as an ambassador at this year's SCMP DEI Summit, alongside the remarkable Razlan Manjaji Eva Cheung Sudesh T Faride Shroff Belinda Esterhammer Kirti Lad Michael Cheuk-Hon Chan, MPH Tina Arcilla Vibha Karnik Adil Ali Chris Ng 🌟🌟 As we step into this new year, let us radiate boundless energy and unyielding hope.

The enthusiasm for \"#designforgood\" and the positive energy was definitely contagious. 😄😄 The highlight of the event was undoubtedly the diverse range of topics covered at #SDHK2023 - From #renewableenergy to #impactmeasurement, from #insurance tailored for minority groups to exploring the impact of #AI on the #healthcare system, the sharing & panel discussions by the design practitioners were thought-provoking and inspiring. 👏🏼👏🏼 I particularly enjoyed the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with like-minded individuals who are genuinely committed to making an #impact.

This remarkable event brought together an exceptional ensemble of #differentlyabled musicians who not only showcased their immense talent but also shared their awe-inspiring stories of #resilience. One of the most unforgettable moments was witnessing the extraordinary performances of #MandayHavery, a #hearingimpaired musician who, despite losing her hearing at the age of 18, relearned music through the vibrations in her throat and a music tuner. Her journey culminated in the incredible achievement of receiving the #GoldenBuzzer on #AmericanGotTalent. Equally remarkable was #AdrianAnatawan, a single-armed violinist who triumphed over childhood #bullying and graced the stage at the prestigious #WhiteHouse. Their passion and unwavering dedication left an indelible mark on my heart, reminding me of the privileges I often take for granted. The enchantment continued with the presence of PURPLE SYMPHONY LIMITED from Singapore, a symphony orchestra composed of exceptionally talented #differentlyabled musicians. Additionally, a choir comprising parents, family members of special educational needs (#SEN) musicians, and corporate partners of TCS added an extra layer of magic to the concert. However, the True Color concert went beyond being a mere musical extravaganza. The musicians also embarked on #community #outreach programs to local secondary schools, touching the lives of thousands of students by sharing their personal stories of triumph over adversity, particularly in #mentalwellbeing. Furthermore, an intimate private concert at the MTR Corporation Limited 香港鐵路有限公司 Headquarters Buildings allowed for a profound interaction between colleagues, Mandy, and Adrian. It served as a powerful reminder that, regardless of the challenges we face, we possess the inner strength to overcome them. Often, we ourselves are the only #obstacle standing between us and our dreams. Let us continue to celebrate the power of music, embrace #inclusivity, and support one another on our respective journeys. Together, we can break barriers and create a world where every individual's unique talents and stories are celebrated.

It's amazing to see so many people working towards creating a more sustainable future with more attention on #impactmeasurement.👏🏼👏🏼 Connecting with like-minded individuals and catching up with our #NGO and #SocialEnterprise partners was a highlight for me. As part of our small but passionate #ESG team at MTR Corporation Limited 香港鐵路有限公司, forging meaningful connections between people and creating something new and meaningful is always a privilege.😊😊 I'm thrilled to see what the future holds, especially with the exciting initiatives shared by Olivia Wong (She/Her/Hers), like Carbon Wallet, #LOUDER, the upcoming 1-year internship program for #EthnicMinorities and #PeoplewithDisabilities, etc. It's great to see more support was given towards creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace. 💪🏼💪🏼 Thank you to the organizers of the Rethink Conference for another amazing event.

From their initial interviews to their first English presentations before our seniors Gill Meller Olivia Wong (She/Her/Hers), we've witnessed the remarkable growth of these six young students. Beyond their #onthejobtraining in the office, they had participated in Dark Experience curated by our ESG Project Allies Dialogue Experience (special thanks to CEO Louis Hou for a special discussion session with them), the #depot and train visits led by our Rolling Stock engineers, the fun-filling corporate inductions with #legoseriousplay, and invaluable career insights from young graduates. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the various departments and their supervisors who dedicated their time to help mentoring these promising young talents: - Data Studio / Technology Development: Andy Pang, Shera Lai, Billy Tam - Customer Experience: Lawrence Hui, Gigi Lam, Jerry Tang - Rolling Stock: Edmund Law - Learning & Development: Chester Tsang, Alston Leung, Apple Ip, Wing Kwong - Environmental & Social Responsibility: Ava Lau - Career Chat: Mandy Ho & Linus Lee At MTR Corporation Limited 香港鐵路有限公司, we are committed in fostering #community growth and to creating #advancement and #opportunities.
