        "text": "14 Aug â€“ Hong Kong's music producer Jun Kung has recently dismissed rumours saying that he and girlfriend Sandy Lam will be getting married in September.\n\nAccording to Singpao News, the singer, who attended the press conference announcing his entry into Paco Wong's Sun Entertainment, said that he has never thought about the matter and is currently busy focusing on his career.\n\n\"For now, I want to do more good deeds and write more songs,\" said Jun.\n\nWhen asked to address rumours saying that his relationship with Sandy has improved her own relationship with daughter Lee Xi Er, the 35 year-old music producer said that he has not seen the report.\n\nJun Kung and Sandy Lam have been dating since 2011 and are currently living together. Sandy was previously married to Taiwanese music producer Jonathan Lee.\n\nMeanwhile, Paco Wong expressed his delight to finally be able to sign Jun Kung as a resident artiste of his company.\n\n\"I have wanted to sign him 15 years ago after hearing his voice. I missed the chance, until today that is,\" he said.\n\n(Photo credit: nextmedia.com)"
