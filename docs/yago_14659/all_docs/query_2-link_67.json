        "text": "This article originally appeared in the September 2015 issue of Architectural Digest.\n\nBy now Derek Lam and Jan-Hendrik Schlottmann have learned a lot about working together. After all, they’ve been partners in life and work for well over a decade, spending a dozen years running Lam’s influential fashion label, the past three years as a married couple. “Our motto has been ‘Divide and conquer,’” Lam says. Schlottmann adds with a teasing smile, “What that means is, when it comes to creative issues, I keep my mouth shut.”\n\nThe men are sitting in the library of what they like to call their tree house, an airy apartment with abundant wood paneling and verdant views of Gramercy Park, the famously private Manhattan square. The residence, in a 1930 building redesigned a decade ago by British architect John Pawson, is a combination of the couple’s complementary aesthetic sensibilities. Schlottmann, for his part, craves the cozy and well-lived-in. The yellow velvet sofa they’re seated on is a prized perch for relaxing, while the nearby tables are surfaces for casually cluttering with newspapers and coffee mugs—or glasses of red wine. Schlottmann says he doesn’t even mind when their two-year-old Irish terrier, Roscoe, “antiques” the rugs as he plays.\n\nLam, meanwhile, says he seeks “unpretentious luxury with an unexpected mix-up of styles,” qualities that also define his fashion designs. Pointing to the sofa, he remarks, “It’s as if a bohemian inherited a nice piece and had just enough cash to get it re-covered.” Searching for a fitting stylistic term, he ventures, “Rich-poor? Poor-rich?” before settling on “impoverished creativity.”\n\nA San Francisco native, Lam met the German-born Schlottmann in 1997, when they were both on holiday in Thailand. A year later, Schlottmann, who had been living in Paris, accepted a job in the Manhattan offices of the beauty company Coty and moved into Lam’s Greenwich Village home. According to Schlottmann, it was the easiest move in New York history: “I had a job, a boyfriend, and an apartment waiting for me when I got off the plane.”\n\nOver the next few years, Schlottmann became a vice president in Prada’s beauty division, while Lam was named a design director at Michael Kors, his second stint at the label. But the couple also began to discuss starting their own brand. In 2003, pooling their savings, they launched Derek Lam, with Schlottmann as CEO. Two years later Lam earned the emerging women’s wear designer award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America; he has since gone on to dress the likes of Rachel Weisz, Rihanna, and Kendall Jenner. Moreover, he and Schlottmann have added a successful lower-priced line, Derek Lam 10 Crosby, and an expansion of the Derek Lam flagship boutique on Madison Avenue is planned for next year.\n\nWith the brand hitting its stride, the couple recently sought to settle down in a new home. They had lived all over downtown, but when they saw this apartment something clicked. “Gramercy Park is charm personified,” Lam says. “It feels like a hidden oasis in the city.”\n\n1 / 8\n\nThey enlisted interior decorator Neal Beckstedt, who had done their Fire Island beach retreat, to help outfit the rooms. In addition to designing the apartment’s elegant pale-washed millwork, Beckstedt created or commissioned a number of furnishings and sourced select vintage pieces. “Neal constantly brought in new accessories,” Lam says. “We were always coming home to something fun.”\n\nBeckstedt enjoyed how he and Lam fed off each other’s aesthetic obsessiveness. “It’s refreshing to have someone who can be equally consumed by an eighth of an inch of grosgrain!” he says with a laugh.\n\nStill, a number of furnishings came with the couple and tell their story. There's the table in the living area that Lam bought with his very first paycheck from Michael Kors in 1991. \"I carried it through the Village because I couldn't afford the delivery charge,\" he recalls. \"I would carry it a block, put it down and sit on it for a bit, then pick it up and carry it another block.\"\n\nHighlighting their art collection is a large Chuck Close portrait of artist Sienna Shields, his wife, which presides over the library. \"We bought it at Pace Gallery in Chelsea the afternoon before Hurricane Sandy hit,\" Lam recounts. \"We thought, Isn't this place going to flood? We got it not even knowing if it would fit anywhere.\"\n\nSeveral idiosyncratic abstract works by Jim Lee are displayed throughout the apartment, including two mounted in the sanctuary-like master bedroom, atop a leafy Madeleine Castaing wall covering. The vibrant fabric—a nod to the park outside—was also used for the window's Roman shades. The challenge of getting everything to line up seamlessly appealed to Lam's love of precise detail. \"You know,\" the designer says with a grin,\"it only took about ten attempts to get it right.\""
