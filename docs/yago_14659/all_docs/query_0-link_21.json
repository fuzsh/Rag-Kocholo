        "text": "At 46, singer Sandy Lam has not stopped releasing new albums and performing concerts. Constantly challenging herself, the Hong Kong-based artists will play guitar for the first time on stage for her upcoming concert, MMXTT, in Beijing.\n\n\"I learned guitar from my 14-year-old daughter. She is also a big fan of rock,\" says Lam, who will be dancing and singing rock songs during the concert.\n\nA radio DJ in Hong Kong since she was 16, Lam has released 30 albums under Sony, Warner Music, and Rock Records - Taiwan's largest independent label. She sings in Cantonese and Mandarin. Her smooth, soft voice has won her a huge fan base across the region, with Chinese listeners.\n\nShe married one of the most productive and famous singer-songwriters and producer in Taiwan, Jonathan Lee, in 1998, but divorced in 2004. She once said that Lee wrote some of her best songs, and brought her pain and happiness.\n\n\"The reason why my songs are widely shared by fans, especially the female fans, is because they can relate to my personal experiences,\" she once said. \"But now I am a mother and I have more fun with my daughter. When I sing those heartbreaking songs now, I feel as if I'm telling someone else's stories.\"\n\n8 pm, on Aug 10. At Mastercard Center, the former Wukesong Arena, No. 69, Fuxinglu, Haidian district, Beijing. 400-610-3721."
