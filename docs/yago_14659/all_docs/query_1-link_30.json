        "text": "Only 159 centimeters in tall, and with a pair of small, and plain-looking eyes, Lam thought of herself as an ugly duckling before high school. But after marching onto the pop scene, she first adopted a Japanese idol image, then later found an image suited her most, a mature girl who is seeking love. She wore her hair in curls and had a wild and perplexed expression in her eyes.\n\nHong Kong singer Sandy Lam\n\nIn 1988, Lam signed with Warner music and released three \"City Rhythm\" albums, in which urban women's life, love, happiness and sorrow were depicted.\n\nIn 1990, Lam gained huge popularity with her debut Mandarin album release \"Home Without You\". The title song became a smash hit in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Mainland.\n\nIn 1993, Lam released another Mandarin album \"No Need to Care Who I Am\" under rolling stone label, with songwriter Jonathan Lee as the supervisor. It was Lam and Lee's second collaboration after they sang a duet for theme song of movie \"Farewell, My Concubine\", \"When Love Becomes Past Stories\". The two became partners both in life and career after that.\n\nIn 1995, Sandy teamed with Lee to release her 4th Mandarin album \"Love, Sandy\", featuring the hit single \"Scars\". \"Love, Sandy\" became one of the all time best selling Chinese language albums, with 4 million copies sold. With that album, she established herself as an indisputable Asian pop star.\n\nLam shun the public scene for a while in 1998, after giving birth to her daughter. Then in 1999, She released \"Spunky Rose\" featuring electronic styles.\n\nIn 2000, Lam released \"Sandy's\" after signing with Virgin. The hit song \"At Least I've Got You\" led KTV music charts for eight months around China.\n\nThen after a five-year hiatus, Lam returned to the pop scene in 2005 with the release of her Cantonese album \"True Colors\", and held a concert series at Hong Kong Coliseum at the end of year.\n\nShe went on to hold a world concert tour the following year, entitled \"Night Scene Without Boundaries\", with stops in Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei, United States' Lake Tahoe, and Malaysia.\n\nThen Lam release another Mandarin album \"Breathe\" and sang at the \"Friends of Love The Earth 2006 Concert\" in Japan.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2009, Lam spent two busy years staging concerts around the world. Now Lam has unwrapped another national concert tour this year, entitled \"One Zero Sandy\", with the first stop in Shanghai on February the 19th. Her next stops will be Beijing, Tianjin and the southern city Foshan. Lam will release another Mandarin album in the second half of this year.\n\nAfter two decades of phenomenal success, it seems that Sandy Lam hasn't slowed down one bit in the Asian pop music scene."
