        "text": "A comprehensive playlist of the music of Los Angeles would have to include film scores, cool jazz, surf bands, frat rock, folk-rock, Sunset Strip psychedelia, Chicano soul, country rock, hardcore punk, Paisley Underground, hair metal, gangsta rap, and G-funk. Lists of performers and bands associated with Los Angeles invariably include plenty rock groups, soul singers, and rappers. Inevitably, most are either black or white.\n\nLos Angeles is the world’s great Pan-Asian metropolis. Metro Los Angeles is home to the largest populations of Indonesians and Mongolians in the US. Metro Los Angeles is home to the world’s largest communities of Cambodians, Filipinos, Koreans, Taiwanese, Thai, and Vietnamese outside of their respective homelands. Asians are Los Angeles’s largest and fastest-growing racial minority. Naturally, then, Los Angeles has produced and attracted a number of Asian American musicians from diverse backgrounds composing and performing music in an enormous variety of styles. Metro Los Angeles, too, was the epicenter of vibrant and almost exclusively Asian-American oriented scenes including the sansei dance band scene, Pinoy rock, Vietnamese New Wave, and others — not that you’d know that even if you read every single music related listicle or article joylessly generated by the city’s content creators. This being Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, however, I decided to do something about that.\n\nI started by thinking about the Sooyoung Park’s Ear of the Dragon — but for some of the nineteen Asian-American (and Canadian) bands on that seminal compilation, their entire recorded output seems to be limited to their inclusion on the album and in most cases, they’re not from California. So this list is primarily drawn from my own admittedly knowledge with the addition of a few unfamiliar K-pop stars I found out about on Wikipedia.\n\nI know there are loads more Asian Angeleno musicians out there, because I’ve seen some of them performing at Jologs Fezt, Laklak Fest, the Lotus Festival, night markets, Songkran, and Tết; at Thai restaurants, on Paris By Night, on videos shot at La Lune, the annual Asian American Music Festival and elsewhere. I know, too, that this can never be a comprehensive directory (I don’t even think that I’d want it to be — apologies to my fifteen-year-old neighbor who briefly took guitar lessons and learned that awful song by fun.) but of course, additions and corrections are encouraged.\n\nACID RAIN\n\nAcid Rain played Jologz Fest 2016.\n\nALAN NAKAGAWA\n\nAlan Nakagawa is an interdisciplinary artist working primarily with sound.
