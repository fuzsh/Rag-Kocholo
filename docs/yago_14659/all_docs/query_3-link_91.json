        "text": "I’m always telling my coaching clients: “DO NOT SQUANDER YOUR YOUTHFUL ENERGY”\n\nNobody has more embraced this ideal—as part of my coaching program—than today’s guest.\n\nJaekyu Lee, who goes by Jonathan, is a young man I’ve been working with for a little over a year. Watching someone so dedicated to his own personal growth & development has been inspiring and intrinsically rewarding [for me].\n\nHis story is nothing short of awe-some. He’s that 1st-generation Asian fella down the hall you’ve never taken the time to ask:\n\n“Hey man, what’s your story?”\n\nWell, I got that opportunity when “J,” as I call him, came down from Dallas a few weeks ago.\n\nWe actually recorded in a professional studio, so it may sound a little better than previous episodes.\n\nHere’s that story. There was a sex offender I’d gotten to know over the past several months (and liked). In fact, I liked “Jerome” (not his real name) so much that I offered to be the sales rep for his mobile car washing business.\n\nI was going to dust off the ‘ole blue suit and visit high-rises where I had connections in Houston. I’d see if we could setup on the first floor of the garage. He’d be stationary at 70 years old, and it’d be much more lucrative for him.\n\nJerome was smart, a great storyteller, and reminded me of Morgan Freeman. Not to mention the crime he committed occurred before I was born.\n\nSo I wanted to help Jerome. Plus, I thought he’d be a great guest on the podcast. Such a great guest, in fact, that I rented a professional studio on the day & time we had agreed to meet.\n\nWell, Jerome “went dark” on me a few days before we were scheduled to record. I actually still haven’t heard from him. And I didn’t want to leave the studio’s owner hanging, so I asked J if he’d want to tell his story on my podcast.\n\nHe said, “Absolutely!”\n\nAlthough he was in town visiting friends—I challenged him to a game of pickleball at Lifetime Fitness—loser buys the winner their book of choice (we’re both avid readers).\n\nAfter J got smoked, getting A Monk’s Guide to Happiness by Gelong Thubten in the mail was like Christmas morning. You see I didn’t tell him what book I wanted—I just sent him a screenshot of the Notes app from my iPhone. I’ve kept a running tab for years of books I plan to get to someday. So I didn’t know what would show up in the mail. But this book is a gamer. Highly recommend! Thanks, J!\n\nBack to my Asian friend who got the dog sh*t beat out of him on the pickleball court. By the way, if he didn’t talk so much sh*t by text the previous week about how he was going to dominate me, this story probably doesn’t even get told. But here we are.\n\nJonathan’s not your average Asian dude down the hall. His upbringing took him all over the world, spending the first half of his life in three countries.\n\nHe was born in Busan, South Korea. His dad, who worked for LG, was transferred to Jakarta, Indonesia, then Monterrey, Mexico, before they finally arrived in the States (El Paso, TX). Jonathan earned his Doctorate of Pharmacy in 2018 from the University of Houston, then completed a 2-year post-graduate residency for the US government.\n\nToday, J works for the government as a pharmacy manager, and holds down another full-time job as a Realtor at Rendon Realty, LLC (I’ve been there—it’s no joke).\n\nJ says his passion for reading & financial independence will continue to provide all the fuel he needs to accomplish his goals. He’s up at 4am every morning so he can get to the gym.\n\nWhat’s his primary goal? To become a multi-millionaire and retire by age 40 (he’s 29 now).\n\nHe’ll do it.\n\nJonathan, whose online moniker is Doctor_RealEstate, is a strong advocate for self-development and passionate about helping other men fulfill their true potential.\n\nHope you enjoy listening as much as we did recording!\n\nOther topics discussed:\n\nSouth vs North Korea\n\nMeeting North Koreans\n\nNorth and South Korea relationship\n\nSeoul’s massive population\n\nPressure from parents to be successful\n\nWhy Jake’s family moved to Indonesia\n\nWhy Jake thinks corporate life is not for him based on his dad’s coping mechanism to de-stress\n\nGoing to school in Indonesia\n\nMoving to America at age 15\n\nCoping with frequent relocation\n\nJake’s identity crisis in El Paso, Texas\n\nCalling someone Asian vs Oriental\n\nGrowing up in a homogeneous community in Houston\n\nWhy Jake wont go the pharmacist route if given the chance to go back\n\nWorking at the Veterans Affairs\n\nJosh Rogin and Peter Zeihan’s talk about China’s future\n\nWhere did COVID really come from\n\nForging vaccine cards\n\nLong term consequences of vaccines\n\nPfizer’s recurring revenue from boosters\n\nGetting our hearts checked for myocarditis\n\nEffects of cocaine, heroin, benzodiazepine, and opioids\n\nStudent loan debt and lifestyle inflation\n\nThe power of compound interest\n\nHouse hacking\n\nBrad’s 2 clients whose debts has been wiped out\n\nWorking as a real estate agent on the side\n\nReal estate challenges that people don’t know\n\nWhy Brad advises his buyer clients to show up the last 10-15 minutes of the inspection\n\nWhy Jake got into real instate\n\nHow Jake met Brad and why he decided to look for a coach\n\nBenefit of one-on-one coaching\n\nCompeting with yourself and journaling\n\nFinding the ideal partner\n\nJake’s ideal age for marriage\n\nJake’s favorite social media app\n\nPaying for Facebook ads\n\nVirtual assistants in the Philippines\n\nJake wanting to meet Jordan Peterson\n\nTesla and Twitter stocks\n\nLack of sleep and testosterone\n\nFaith as a common denominator for successful people\n\nLife’s challenges and growth\n\nQuestions asked:\n\nDo people assume South Korea when you say you’re from Korea?\n\nHave you ever met a North Korean?\n\nDo you take a high level of interest in North Korea?\n\nCan South and North Koreans tell each other apart?\n\nDid your parents put a lot of pressure on you to be successful?\n\nWere you in Busan when you lived in South Korea until age 9?\n\nAt what age did you move to Indonesia?\n\nWhat sort of business did your father open up in South Texas?\n\nDid you ever think you were going to do what your dad did when you were growing up?\n\nDid you go to Bali while you were there [in Indonesia]?\n\nDid you go to a Korean-speaking school or did you have to learn the language?\n\nAt what age did you come to America?\n\nHow did you feel about leaving your friends every four years?\n\nWhich part of the US did you come to?\n\nHave you experienced any discrimination?\n\nIf you were 18 years old and continuing your education, would you go the same route [as a pharmacist]?\n\nDid your parents dictate your route [to be a pharmacist]?\n\nDo you have any thoughts on COVID and whether or not that came from a lab or from a bat in the wild?\n\nDid you see that interview with Damar Hamlin?\n\nDo you recommend as a pharmacist that we get our hearts checked to see if we may have myocarditis?\n\nHow much school debt did you finish with?\n\nWhat was your starting salary as a pharmacist?\n\nAre you paying the minimum on your school debt or are you trying to accelerate payments on that?\n\nHave you ever met anybody famous in your life?\n\nWhat else do you do [aside from being a pharmacist]?\n\nWhy is being a real estate agent more of a culture shock for you than coming to the US for the first time?\n\nWhat made you decide to look for a coach?\n\nWhat has been the biggest benefit of having a one-on-one coach that you speak with weekly?\n\nDescribe to me your perfect type of woman.\n\nIf I were married to a woman who weighed 195 pounds and I was out of shape myself, would you have hired me as your coach?\n\nAt what age are you getting married?\n\nHow do we know how many views our Facebook ads are getting?\n\nWhy are you not buying Twitter stock?\n\nDo you have a car payment right now?
