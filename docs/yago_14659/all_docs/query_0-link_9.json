        "text": "Canadian singer Celine Dion appointed a new manager after her husband Rene Angelil stepped down from the post he held for more than 30 years.\n\nThe entertainment industry has many instances of celebrities who married their managers or chose to have their significant other become their manager, but not all the partnerships have turned out as well as how it did for Dion, 46, and her husband, 72. Here are several other celebrities who have chosen to mix their personal lives with their work.\n\nMariah Carey\n\nThe American singer known for her wide vocal range married her manager Tony Mottola, who was the president of Sony Music at the time, in June 1993. Mottola had heard a demo tape of the then waitress in 1988, and was so impressed that he quickly signed her to a record deal.\n\nThey separated four years later in May 1997, and finalised their divorce in March the following year. In a statement announcing their separation, they said they had split \"mutually and amicably\". Reports, however, said the pop diva had become unhappy with Mottola's attempts to control her every move.\n\nMary J. Blige (MJB)\n\nThe Queen of Hip-Hop Soul married record producer Kendu Isaacs in December 2003, three years after Isaacs became MJB's manager. The Grammy winner credits her husband with helping her turn her life around - from one filled with drugs, alcohol and low self-esteem - by loving her despite her shortcomings. Her song, We Ride, is a celebration of the happiness that she has found with Isaacs.\n\nThe couple have had their fair share of drama, with Isaacs being accused of infidelity. But Blige has stated that their marriage is not on the rocks.\n\nKelly Rowland\n\nRowland started dating her manager, Tim Witherspoon, in 2011. The two entered matrimonial bliss on May 9 this year in a small ceremony in Costa Rica. She was previously set to marry professional American football player Roy Williams, but broke off the engagement in 2005. The former Destiny's Child singer is now expecting her first child.\n\nShania Twain\n\nThe country singer met music producer Robert Lange in June 1993, and married him six months later. Lange was behind several of Twain's albums, including the hit 1997 album, Come On Over. In August 2001, she gave birth to their son.\n\nHowever, after the Canadian star found out her husband had been cheating on her with her best friend, she divorced him on June 9, 2010. She later married Frederic Thiebaud, the ex-husband of her former bestie, on New Year's Day in 2011.\n\nSheila Majid\n\nPopular Malaysian singer Sheila Majid married producer Roslan Abdul Aziz in a Valentine's Day ceremony in 1989. Mr Roslan was behind some of her best-selling albums, such as Emosi and Warna.\n\nHowever, the nine-year marriage ended in divorce in November 1998, with the Kuala Lumpur-born singer claiming that Roslan often beat her. They have two children together.\n\nSandy Lam\n\nIn February 1998, the Hong Kong singer married Taiwanese songwriter and music producer Jonathan Lee, who wrote many of her songs, including Scar and Bygone Love, which was used as the theme song for the Golden Palm Award-winning film Farewell To My Concubine. Their daughter was born in May the same year.\n\nHowever, they went their separate ways in 2004. Both remain tight-lipped over why they split. Lee says he is still on cordial terms with Lam.\n\nMavis Hee\n\nUnlike the others on this list, Singaporean singer Mavis Hee never went beyond the \"romantically linked\" stage with her music producer and mentor Chen Jiaming, who was married at the time. Chen discovered Hee, and was her pillar of (professional) strength as she built up a strong following in East Asia, even topping the Hong Kong Cantonese charts at one point to beat other well-known singers such as Andy Lau. However, she has strongly denied the rumours that they were ever an item.\n\nIn 2006, Hee was diagnosed with clinical depression after an incident where she verbally harassed two guests at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Singapore, allegedly due to her \"failed relationship\" with Chen."
