        "text": "My name is Joong ‚ÄúJonathan‚Äù Lee. I am around 55 years old. Many people have told me that my age has finally caught up with my looks. I now take that as a compliment! üôÇ\n\nI have been married for close to 32 years now, and my wife, Susanna, has been a blessing to me throughout the years. Some lessons in marriage are contained in these posts.\n\nI am also a pastor. I‚Äôm currently serving as one of the network directors of Acts2 Network. Being a part of this community of faith has been a rich blessing for me. Many of my sharings arise from the context of ministry.\n\nI am also a proud parent to two children [who have grown up now]. It is such a delight to see my daughter and son grow up over the years. Naturally, some of my posts will feature some lessons I‚Äôve learned along the way of parenting‚Ä¶ (My kids frequent my old posts to remember the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù of Lee family!) And this year, I got upgraded to grand-daddy status!\n\nScience also interests me; having invested a big chunk of my life and several years as a chemistry professor, I am always up for a quick nerdy ‚Äúshop talk‚Äù with science majors. Another interesting fact is that I once had the nickname ‚ÄúBucky‚Äù (short for Buckminsterfullerene, aka C60) during my Ph.D. days. Some of my favorite stores include (which reveal different facets of my life): Home Depot (handyman), REI-Outlet.com (hiker), Fry‚Äôs Electronics (high-tech nerd), and Costco (hungry ‚Äî I love their Polish hotdogs)! As you can see, I also like alliteration and I‚Äôm prone to play with words when writing weblogs. (I‚Äôm sorry, but I couldn‚Äôt help it.)\n\nAll in all, I‚Äôve been richly blessed. My parents have continually showered me with prayers. I also have spiritual mentors who have led me throughout the past 40+ years (Pastor Ed & Kelly Kang of Acts2 Network), close friends, sharing the up‚Äôs and down‚Äôs of life together, and a life filled with God‚Äôs grace‚Ä¶"
