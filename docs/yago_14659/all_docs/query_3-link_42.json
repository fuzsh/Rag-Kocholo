        "text": "Jonathan Lee knows that every client deserves an unwavering advocate who keeps them informed. Seeing clients who have had their lives upended by car accidents, pedestrian accidents or dog bites has made him passionate about giving those victims the personal attention and knowledge they need to move forward. Jonathan Lee has dedicated his career as an attorney and his time at Premier Law Group to personal injury, wrongful death and diminished value claims.\n\nJonathan is a native of Washington State, and grew up locally in Bellevue. He earned his double degree in Political Science and Law, Societies and Justice from the University of Washington in 2006, and a Juris Doctor from Seattle University in 2009. He joined Premier Law Group as an associate attorney in 2014.\n\nMaking sure all his clients are able to fully understand their case despite language barriers is very important to Jonathan, which is why he is glad to be able to offer legal services in English and Cantonese.\n\nIf heâ€™s not working, Jonathan is most likely spending time with his wife and kids, George and Autumn. He also mentors students at the University of Washington. Outside of football season, he loves to bbq, travel, snowboard, and hike in the pristine Pacific Northwest. And, yes, he does love the rain and windstorms."
