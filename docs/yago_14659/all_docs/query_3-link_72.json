        "text": "Jonathan Lee McElhenny is a husband, father, pastor, worship leader and songwriter. But when asked to describe who he is, he answers, “matchmaker.” “I was created to worship, and to lead others in worship,” he says. “I like to think of myself as a matchmaker between God and man in partnership with The Holy Spirit. I want more than anything for people to have a true revelation of who God is because when people truly see Jesus, it changes them forever. That is what I am called to do. People many times have told me that my music helps them see Jesus, There is nothing better than that to me.” Jonathan’s focus on making Jesus famous has attracted many talented artists to record songs he’s written. These artists include the Newsboys, For King & Country, Laura Story, Phillips, Craig & Dean, People & Songs, Jeff Deyo, Aaron Shust, Tricia Brock, Melanie Tierce, Rebecca St. James, Selah, Jordan Merritt, Acquire The Fire and others. Three of those songs have been nominated for four Dove Awards (Worship Song of the Year for “When The Stars Burn Down” by Travis Cottrell and Phillips, Craig & Dean, Inspirational Song of the year for ‘More And More Of You’ by Selah, Song of the Year and Pop Song of the Year for “Proof Of Your Love” by for King & Country.) (Added Note When The Stars Burn Down was number 1 on the charts inspirational Christian Radio.) You Are My Shepherd and the Altar by Tricia Brock were in the top 5 of inspirational Christian Radio along with More and More Of You by Selah which was also in the top 5 of inspirational Christian Radio. Proof Of Your Love by For King And Country was in the top of Christian Radio. You Are My Shepherd, When The Stars Burn Down and Proof Of Your Love have all won Sesac Awards. McElhenny’s success is well-deserved, according to those who know him. “Jonathan is someone that I’ve written some of my best songs with.” Says co-writer, friend and label-head of People & Songs, Jennie Lee Riddle. “It’s a true honor to serve and help send him out as a blessing for such a time as this.” McElhenny is a highly successful songwriter, known as “Jonathan Lee”. And yet, he obeyed the urging of the Holy Spirit and transitioned from the road to full time pastoring in 2016. He says. “I want to leave a legacy that leads people to Jesus, and pastoring helps expand the Kingdom exponentially by helping others around me to grow in Christ. I love it.\" Jonathan’s songs, co-written with notables Benji Cowart, David Moffitt, Chad Cates, Jennie Lee Riddle, Richie Fike, BJ Putnam, Doug Inquist, Corey Voss, Jordan Merritt, and Jared Anderson, bring the worshipper back to the basics as a follower of Christ. If the track record is any indication, Jonathan Lee McElhenny’s music will continue to match the hearts of men and women to the heart of a loving Savior.\n\nRead More ..."
