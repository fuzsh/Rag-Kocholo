        "text": "Jonathan Roy Lee (aka Mr. Sunshine aka Uncle Jon Jon aka Johnnie)\n\nFor reasons we do not understand, God called Jonathan Roy Lee home on April 25, 2023, at the young age of 33.\n\nJonathan is survived by a family that adored him – parents, Jeff and Kathy Lee; brother Justin Lee and his wife, Darcy Lee, who was the sister Jonathan needed; nephew Jude and niece Annmarie, who were his best buddies; grandmother, Sandy Lee; aunts Cindy, Dixie and Rosemary; and godmother Jean Perrault Batic.\n\nMore than anything, Jonathan loved his family. He was always all in for any of our crazy family antics, including comical Christmas photo shoots, Circus Breakfast at the Lake, 4th of July boat parade silliness and family vacations anywhere. He was the best uncle to Jude and Annmarie, who adored him. They never passed up an opportunity to spend time with Uncle Jon Jon, who was “energetic and had a beautiful soul.” Jonathan wanted to do any activity they wanted to do, like zip lining, skiing, 4-square, playing Exploding Kittens, watching movies, and throwing frisbees with the dogs. Justin and Darcy were his “go-to” besties, always there when he needed to talk, or to help him revise his resume, or just to sit on their porch and talk. Justin loved his little brother dearly and treasured the time they had together. He will miss his little bro.\n\nJonathan graduated from Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in 2008. There, he was a swimmer for Brebeuf and Pike Red Devils swim club. Jonathan attended college at Loyola University in Chicago, earning degrees in International Business with honors in 2012. While at Loyola, he was a cheerleader for the Ramblers.\n\nJonathan spent 5 years in the fashion industry in New York City until he decided he needed to be with family and friends back in Indiana. He cheered with Cheer New York, a charitable organization that empowers athletes and raises money for LGBTQ+ charities. Also, while in New York, Jonathan saved a dog named Gryphon from a kill list and brought him back to Indiana. Jonathan always said, Gryphon saved him, not he saved Gryphon.\n\nJonathan loved charitable giving. He loved supporting the YMCA Breakfast with Santa program and Wheeler Mission, and volunteering teaching for cheer clinics, including Franklin Township Middle School.\n\nJonathan loved to sell! He loved the thrill of connecting someone with what they needed or wanted. He was a Million Dollar seller at Coach on Michigan Avenue in Chicago during his days at Loyola. He won numerous awards for Top Sales while at various companies he worked for, including Salesforce.\n\nJonathan is survived by too many friends to mention, but you know who you are! He loved to be there for you, even when you didn’t want him to be!! Jonathan also loved a good gym workout, and he would want anyone who reads this to get their butts in a gym. He would want a shout out to Shred-It, Rumble Boxing North Indy and 148 Wellness.\n\nJonathan thrived on supporting charities. It filled his heart to help others in need. If you want to donate in his name, do so to Damien Center (https://damien.org/give), Humane Society of Johnson County (https://www.hsjc.org/donate), Wheeler Mission (https://wheelermission.org/donate-to-wheeler/), or the YMCA Breakfast with Santa (contact the YMCA for more info – https://indymca.org/athenaeum/).\n\nJonathan also loved Eagle Creek Park in Indianapolis – his go-to place for tranquility and a good hike. For that reason, Jonathan’s Celebration of Life will be held there on June 25, 2023, in Shelter A from 1:00-4:00pm EDT. Please bring a Jonathan story! $5.00 gate entry fees can be reimbursed by his family at the Shelter.\n\nIf you knew Jonathan, you knew JOY! He was the light and the smile in every room! Heaven is a brighter place with him there!"
