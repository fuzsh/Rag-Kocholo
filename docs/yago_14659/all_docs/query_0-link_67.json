        "text": "GMA Edition:\n\nWhat is GMA?\n\nJolin & GMA 2000-2008\n\nJolin & GMA 2011-2016\n\nJolin GMA 2019\n\nThe end of June (or early July) has always been one of the important time in C-pop industry because that’s when Golden Melody Awards giving honours to the artists who have been giving us outstanding and touching music last year. Golden Melody Awards aka GMA is the most prestigious music awards in Chinese pop music industry, it is also known as the Cpop Grammys. (Click here to have a basic intro about Golden Melody Awards.)\n\nFor your record, Jolin Tsai has been awarded 4 Golden Melody Awards trophies which are 2 Song of the Year awards, 1 Best Mandarin Female Singer and 1 Album of the Year. It made her the “dance-pop singer” with the most Golden Melody Award trophies received. In 2016, her album PLAY set the record for the most Golden Melody Awards nominations (ten nominations), leading to a tie with other singers including Jay Chou’s Fantasy (2001) and aMei’s Amit (2009).\n\nIt’s never easy to “compete” with other top artists to get the GMA recognition. Sometimes, the controversies/gossips that sparked after the ceremony will make the audience lose focus on the music itself. I think there is a love-hate relationship between Jolin Tsai and the Golden Melody Awards. During 29 years of GMA, Jolin Tsai has given us several iconic performances on the GMA stage and her hard works are being recognised as well. However, there is also some backlash and even “hates” that she has gained after the night of the award ceremony. These ‘bad experience’ definitely shatter her confidence and might haunt her for several years but she overcomes it like a boss. In her latest album Ugly Beauty, there is a song which is related to her GMA experience. In Ugly Beauty music video, there is also a scene which throwback to her GMA moment. Debuted in 1999, Jolin has been participating GMA since 2000. Participating Golden Melody Awards is more than just walking on the red carpet and getting awards, especially for Jolin.\n\n2000 11th Golden Melody Awards\n\nThis is Jolin’s first time attending Golden Melody Awards. She walked the red carpet with actor and singer, Cecilia Cheung and Daniel Chan. Jolin also presented awards with singer Where Chou and popular host/singer, Hsueh-Liang Pu.\n\n2003 August 2 14th Golden Melody Awards\n\nOn March 2003, Jolin Tsai released her fifth studio album Magic after her contract issue. It’s a huge comeback because this album shows the biggest transition in her music career. The album contains a lot of dance-pop music and people start to label her as the “dance pop singer”.\n\nDue to the SARS outbreak, GMA was postponed from May 3rd to August 2nd. Jolin Tsai was invited to perform and present the awards during the ceremony. She was wearing a Dior Fall 2003 RTW short black dress and carrying a white Dior saddle bag.\n\nShe was accompanied by Harlem Yu to walk the red carpet. She mentioned that her costume is specially made which helped her to change to another outfit real quick, hoping to surprise the audience. Her performance of the night is titled, “Watch her 72 Changes” and you can see a hint of Butterfly. The setlist was Magic (72 Changes).\n\nAfter performing, she was presenting the Best New Artist award with popular host and singer, Jacky Wu. She presented the award to the winner, Evonne Hsu.\n\n2004 May 8 15th Golden Melody Awards\n\nOn March 2nd, Jolin has released her sixth studio album, Castle. In the same year, her album Magic was nominated for 3 awards including Best Mandarin Album, Best Mandarin Female Singer and Best Arranger in 15th Golden Melody Awards. Magic has won the Best Arranger award with Prague Square arranged by Baby Chung.\n\nJolin Tsai walked the red carpet with her bestie Show Lo. She was wearing a green dress by Prada Spring 2004 RTW. She was very nervous and it was nice to be accompanied by her close friend.\n\nThat night, her other task is to present the award with special guest, 今井翼 Tsubasa Imai. The award that they’re presenting Lyricist of the Year (Traditional) and Lyricist of the Year (Pop).\n\nWhen Baby Chung was announced as the winner of Best Arranger, Jolin Tsai went to the stage to get the award on behalf of Baby Chung because he was absent. But she made a mistake when she was saying the thank you speech, she spoke the wrong name Yao Hung instead of Baby Chung. Before the Best Mandarin Female Singer was presented, Jolin Tsai had a chance to make up her mistake by thanking Baby Chung again. She also said that she was quite chill when being asked by the host about her feelings.\n\nNominations:\n\nBest Arranger\n\nBaby Chung 鍾興民 – 布拉格廣場 Prague Square (《看我72變》Magic by Jolin Tsai) – Winner\n\nLiu Shau Xi 劉劭希 – 地狱浮沉录 ( 《八方来客》 by Liu Shau Xi )\n\nHai Lin 林海 – 空城 Desolate City (《將愛》 To Love by Faye Wong)\n\nZhang Yadong 張亞東 – 不留 Leave Nothing ( 《將愛》 To Love by Faye Wong)\n\nYao Hung 洪敬堯 – 以父之名 In the Name of Father (《葉惠美》Yeh Hui-mei by Jay Chou)\n\nAlbum of the Year\n\n《葉惠美》Yeh Hui-mei by Jay Chou – Winner\n\n《看我72變》Magic by Jolin Tsai\n\n《將愛》To Love by Faye Wong\n\n《一儕·花樹下》by Hsieh Yu-Wei 謝宇威\n\n《風吹的願望》 by Jody Chiang 江蕙\n\nBest Mandarin Female Singer\n\nFaye Wong 王菲 – 《將愛》To Love – Winner\n\nJolin Tsai 蔡依林 – 《看我72變》Magic\n\nPenny Tai 戴佩妮 – 《No Penn, No Gain》\n\nTanya Chua 蔡健雅 – 《陌生人》Stranger\n\nFish Leong 梁靜茹 – 《美麗人生》Beautiful Life\n\nDuring the first round of voting, Jolin Tsai and Tanya Chua have been eliminated. In the second round of voting, Faye Wong received 9 votes, Fish Leong received 8 votes and Penny Tai received 2 votes. Because no one has exceeded half of the total number of the votes, so there is a third round of voting. Faye Wong has received landslide victory in the third round of voting.\n\n2007 June 16 18th Golden Melody Awards\n\nIt has been 3 years since her last GMA nomination and participation. Although Castle and J-Game helped her to become the best-selling album by a female artist of the year in Taiwan, the 2 albums didn’t get any recognition from the GMA juries. Dancing Diva was not only the best-selling album of the year in Taiwan, it also helped Jolin Tsai to earn her two Golden Melody Award nominations for Best Mandarin Album and Best Mandarin Female Singer, and she finally won the Best Mandarin Female Singer award!\n\nJolin Tsai has received 4 awards that night, 2 Golden Melody Official Awards and another 2 unofficial awards which are Golden Melody Caller Tune Singer awards and she has been voted as the Most Popular Female Singer (Group) by the audience.\n\nJolin Tsai attended 18th Golden Melody Awards in a Versace Spring 2007 RTW Fish Scales Dress and Bvlgari jewellery. She said that she is very nervous because she was opening the show. She was concerning about the performance as it involved fire shows. She said she will feel better after finishing the show. She did not prepare for the thank you speech because she thought the speech was never used when it’s prepared. She also revealed that she was wearing red underwear for good luck.\n\nJolin Tsai opened the Golden Melody Awards by performing Dancing Diva. The performance included tribal elements and also gymnastic movements. Although she was lip-syncing during the performance, she still gave us a visually stunning performance.\n\nJolin Tsai was the first place in the Most Popular Female Singer (Group) category, her total votes have surpassed S.H.E (Second place) and Fish Leong (3rd place). This unofficial GMA award was selected by the audience. Audience can vote for their favourite artist through online and SMS. She has received a total 92,762 votes, 89,269 votes are online, 3,493 votes are from SMS. Jolin received the award from her best friend, Show Lo and Japanese singer-songwriter Mai Kuraki.\n\nThe first official GMA award that Jolin has won that night was Best Song of the Year for Marry Me Today. Marry Me Today featuring Jolin Tsai was released in David Tao’s album, Beautiful.\n\nThen Jolin presented Best Mandarin Male Singer award with singer-songwriter WuBai. WuBai has released his song, You’re My Flower which features a dance. Both of them were performing the dance on the stage before presenting the award. Finally, they presented the Best Mandarin Male Singer to Nicky Lee.\n\nOne of the highlights of the night is when The legendary pop band, The Wynners announcing the winner of Best Mandarin female artist. There are 6 nominees in the category, all of them are popular and have several hits. Jolin Tsai won her first Golden Melody Award. She is a GMA winner!\n\nHer second outfit of the day is from Dolce & Gabanna SS2007.\n\nNominations\n\nProducer of the Year, Single\n\nJay Chou 周杰倫 – 《霍元甲》Huo Yuan Jia （Fearless by Jay Chou）- Winner\n\nAdia 阿弟仔 – 《舞孃》Dancing Diva （Dancing Diva by Jolin Tsai）\n\nHigher Band 亥兒樂隊, Zhu Jian Hui 朱劍輝 – 《炎黃子孫》Yan Huang Zisun （ Yan Huang Zisun by Higher Band ）\n\nBest Mandarin Album\n\n《Wake Up》 – MC HotDog 熱狗 – Winner\n\n《舞孃》 Dancing Diva – Jolin Tsai\n\n《Blue in love》 – Hao-en and Jiajia 昊恩家家\n\n《My Life Will…》 – Deserts Chang 張懸\n\n《小宇宙》Little Universe – Sodagreen 蘇打綠\n\n《浪費時間快樂的 All I want》 – Joystna Peng 彭靖惠\n\nBest Song of the Year\n\n今天你要嫁給我 Marry Me Today – David Tao & Jolin Tsai,《太美麗》Beautiful – winner\n\n種樹 Planting Trees – Lin Sheng Xiang 林生祥,《 種樹 》Planting Trees\n\n千里之外 Far Away – Jay Chou 周杰倫,《依然范特西》 Still Fantasy\n\n小情歌 Little Love Song – Sodagreen 蘇打綠,《小宇宙》Little Universe\n\n寶貝(in the night) Baby(in the night) – Deserts Chang 張懸 ,《My Life Will…》\n\n天下大同 Same World – Karen Mok 莫文蔚,《 如果沒有你 》 Without You\n\nMini Commentary:\n\nPlanting Trees is a Hakka song dedicated to Taiwan Farming Association. The whole album helps to raise awareness about the farming industry and also the farmers. It’s a Hakka new folk, the arrangement is simple but the song is calm and touching. Usually, this kind of song with a meaningful background will win the category. Although the song didn’t win this category, it helped Lin Sheng Xiang win the Best Lyricist, Best Hakka Singer and Best Hakka Album. However, Lin refused to accept the trophy (but he accepted the award money and he promised that he would donate the money to the farming industry) and this cause the first controversy of the night. Everyone tended to doubt that why a wedding song can beat other hits like Far Away, Baby and Little Love Song. Little Love Song is like the karaoke song (ballad) of the year. Far Away by Jay Chou featuring the legendary singer Fei Yu-ching will forever be the classic collaboration between a pop singer and a legendary(senior) singer. No doubt that Marry Me Today is the popular wedding song for several years (like Ed Sheeran’s Perfect?).\n\nBest Mandarin Female Singer\n\nJolin Tsai 蔡依林 – 《舞孃》 Dancing Diva – Winner\n\nSandy Lam 林憶蓮 – 《呼吸》Breathe Me\n\naMei Chang 張惠妹 – 《 我要快樂 》 I Want Happiness\n\nPenny Tai 戴佩妮 – 《 ipenny 》\n\nAngela Chang 張韶涵 – 《潘朵拉》 Pandora\n\nJoystna Peng 彭靖惠 – 《浪費時間快樂的 All I want》\n\nThere’re altogether 3 rounds of voting. During the first and second round, the number of votes is a deadlock between aMei and Sandy Lam. In the last round, it’s the fight between Jolin Tsai and Penny Tai. Eventually, Jolin received the recognition from 2/3 of judges.\n\nControversies\n\n1. Leak\n\n18th Golden Melody Awards is the most disastrous in its history because there is a serious result leak right before the awards ceremony. Around 7pm, the complete list of winners has been revealed. As a result, some of the nominees were acting calmly like nothing happen even though they knew that they are not the winners. Some other nominees even left the ceremony since they know they lost. According to the news, aMei has been told by her assistant that she lost before the category is revealed and she was forced to act naturally. When Jolin was being accused that she already knew the result just because her thank you speech is flawless, Jolin’s manager, Chiang said that he never inform Jolin because she didn’t know how to act. Furthermore, she was saying aMei’s name before the winner was announced. Her speech was good because that’s her heartfelt words. Of course, haters gonna hate, they said that Jolin’s reaction to her win is so fake.\n\n2. Lipsync\n\nLip-sync used to be a big no-no in the Cpop industry unless it’s necessary. Jolin was lip-syncing during her opening performance and it receives complain and backlash from the netizens. Her manager replied that the performance involved fire and the smokes were choking even during the rehearsal. Eventually, it’s decided to let Jolin lip-sync. When she was tumbling, it might affect the ear monitor to play the sound. Netizens responded that Jolin should’ve put singing as her priority since it’s a singing awards ceremony and not circus.\n\n3. Her win\n\nAnother controversy of the night will be Jolin Tsai winning Best Mandarin Female Singer Awards. Fans of other nominees started doubting her win and things got worse when the netizens bashing her in PTT (Taiwan’s Reddit) saying that, “how Jolin Tsai can beat aMei and Sandy?”. The next day, the media described her win as an unexpected win. Labels started flowing in like “the gymnast won the best singer” and “the best singer lip-synced in the awards ceremony”. Her win at this year’s GMA has been one of the reasons when people wanted to criticize this award ceremony. For some of the audience and critics, her win represents that GMA started losing its prestige and fairness.\n\nWhen her manager was being asked whether Jolin Tsai is qualified to win the Best Mandarin Female Singer even though she was lip-syncing, her manager answered that everyone can see her improvement during the concert, she is a hardworking artist. The smoke during the performance and the dance moves would affect her performance, so it’s a special situation here. The comment given by the judges is that Jolin Tsai is a visionary singer, her works are very active, diverse and the skills are smooth. Her biggest competitor is Penny Tai but her latest work is not as good as her past which is why Jolin Tsai won the awards. The judges also praised that she is smart and agile, able to sing and dance which make her leading. The content of Dancing Diva is diverse which makes her breaking the borders of an artist and become a real singer. She wins because of her multifacetedness. As the music platform is changing, music download is trending, she is keeping up with the trend. A critic criticized the judges that they have different standards on different categories. The critic added that one of the reasons that Jolin won the category is because she is multifaceted, but ain’t aMei is multifaceted as well? “Cirque du Soleil is multifaceted too”, the critic added.\n\naMei responded that everyone should recognise Jolin’s strength, and also the other nominees’. She’s sad that she didn’t win and she’d try again next year. She also showed up at Jolin’s appreciation party after the ceremony. aMei’s manager Isaac Chen (he has written lyrics for Jolin’s 22 songs) said that aMei already knew she won’t win the prize. He responded that the judges have different standards every year, Jolin is the most popular idol now. If the judges are using this perspective to recognise the singer’s hard work, it’s a glorious defeat for aMei. Angela Chang congratulated on Jolin’s win although she was rooting for aMei. She said that Jolin is a hardworking singer and everyone has their own strength.\n\nApparently, most of the people were rooting for aMei’s win that night. Jolin was being treated as an “idol singer” and her vocal can’t beat the other 2 legendary singers. All the nominees are great and each of their albums is excellent and significant. Among the nominees, Joystna is not the mainstream singer, both her and Jolin were from the same singing contest organised by MTV, Jolin won the first place and Joystna was runner-up. All I Want is Joystna’s first Jazz album, before that she was singing ballad pop song. Angela Chang’s Pandora features a “national anthem” called “Invisible Wings”, this song is a hit at all the Chinese-speaking countries. Sandy Lam debuted in 1985, Breath Me was her 29th studio album (10th Mandarin Album). aMei Chang‘s I Want Happiness is her 13th album and it features jams like Hostage and I Want Happiness. This album has received big success in terms of sales and reputation. Penny Tai composes her own song and all the albums that she has released are purely written by her including lyrics and song. In my opinion, I think “breakthrough” is the key word of Jolin’s win. Besides luck, Jolin has a major leap compared to the other nominees. Dancing Diva is her biggest improvement since Magic, this album proves that she is not only a singer, she is also a performer and an artist.\n\nIt’s quite unfair because she has to suffer all the bullying just because she accepted an award given by a group of juries. It feels terrible when there’s someone who doesn’t think you deserve an award. We wouldn’t understand how suffering it is for Jolin to take all these into the heart. She never reveals any of her feelings about all these negativity. Even during her Myself concert, she confessed to her fans with a smile but the tears never stop.\n\n*On 2018 April 11, she reposted this video and wrote down the status below on her Weibo.\n\n“Looking back at the different stages of myself, I might be concerning too much about winning or losing, overexerting myself, closing myself off, looking down on myself. But, every moment that has been recorded show the real situation that I’ve been through. I hope that one day I can quietly smile at that silly stubbornness and resentment of my old self and then feel jubilant and say “how wonderful isn’t it”. It’s like a dream. Don’t be afraid, don’t need to hide, it’s still a gem regardless of good or bad. If you’re overpowered (spending too much effort) on doing something, it’s time to let go! “\n\nIn Ugly Beauty album, the last song titled, Shadow Self includes short audio from 18th Golden Melody Award. It shows the moment when The Wynners announcing the winner of Best Mandarin Female Singer. This song talks about facing your dark side introduced by Carl Jung.\n\n2008 July 5th 19th Golden Melody Awards\n\nIn July 2007, Jolin released her ninth studio album, Agent J , it features several hits including Sun Will Never Set, Agent J and Bravo Lover. It sold more than 200,000 copies sold in Taiwan alone. It’s critics acclaimed because it’s nominated for 2 categories in 19th Golden Melody Awards . Jolin Tsai was the final one walking on the red carpet. She was wearing a dress from Giambattista Valli SS08.\n\nThe opening of the night featured a parody by the hosts. Barbie Hsu was mimicking Jolin’s iconic “Dancing Forever World Tour” outfit.\n\nAgent J received the first award for Best Arranger. The award was received by the arranger Andrew Chen (小安).\n\nThat night, Agent J won its second award which is Producer of the Year, Single. Adia won this category for producing Agent J.\n\nJolin was presenting the Best Mandarin Female Singer with the Bad Day Singer, Daniel Powter. He complimented her for her talent and performance.\n\nJolin’s second outfit was from Lanvin Fall 2008.\n\nNominations:\n\nBest Arrangement\n\nAndrew Chen 小安 – Agent J 特務J (《特務J》Agent J by Jolin Tsai) – Winner\n\nChen Chien-chi 陳建騏 – j’Adore 崇拜, (《崇拜》j’Adore by Fish Leong)\n\nBaby Chung 鍾興民 – Blue and White Porcelain 青花瓷, (《我很忙》On the Run by Jay Chou 周杰倫)\n\nHuang Chung-yueh 黃中岳 – Darwin 達爾文, (《Goodbye & Hello》by Tanya Chua蔡健雅)\n\nMartin Tang – Against the Light 逆光, (《逆光》Against the Light by Stefanie Sun孫燕姿)\n\nMichael Tu 涂惠源 – Wake-up Song 起床歌 (《Super Sunshine》by Gary Chaw曹格)\n\nQing Feng Wu吳青峰, Wei史俊威, Claire Hsieh謝馨儀, Kay Liu 劉家凱, A-Fu何景揚, Zephyr龔鈺祺, Will Lin 林暐哲 – Incomparable Beauty 無與倫比的美麗 (《無與倫比的美麗》Incomparable Beauty by Sodagreen蘇打綠)\n\nProducer of the Year, Single\n\nAdia 阿弟仔 – Agent J 特務J (《特務J》Agent J by Jolin Tsai) – Winner\n\nChen Chien-liang 陳建良 – Fool 傻瓜, (《熱浪》Hot Wave by 溫嵐Landy Wen)\n\nTiger Chung 鍾成虎 – Pussy, (《Track 4》 by 陳綺貞Cheer Chen)\n\nMa Yufen 馬毓芬 – A Moment 一眼瞬間 (《STAR》by 張惠妹aMei & 蕭敬騰Jam Hsiao)\n\nTank – Counterterrorism 反恐小組, (《延长比赛 keep Fighting》by Tank 呂建中)\n\nFuss\n\nThis is not supposed to happen at all.\n\nJolin Tsai’s red carpet outfit stole some highlights and attention when she attended the red carpet wearing Giambattista Valli SS08 ruffle dress. The dress was described as cuttlefish and sanitary pad by the netizens, bloggers and media. Since then, her outfit and her fashion taste have become the subject to tease and mock her for years. This outfit also contributes to one of her nickname, Queen of Seafood.\n\nJolin’s Giambattista Valli dress was selected by Club Designer Taiwan founder and her daughter Miss Yi. Miss Yi said that the ruffle is very GV style, the pink colour is the trendy colour, the outfit suits Jolin’s age and image. She wanted Jolin to look young in a formal occasion. Everyone can have their own opinion, but a good design will still be appreciated by someone who knows and loves the design.\n\nAccording to Vogue Taiwan and her stylist 小倫, Jolin’s outfit was selected out of 10 brands and was being “approved/verified” by the record label. She tried everything and all of them think that she looks the best in the dress. They wanted Jolin to wear a fresh brand instead of wearing a well-known brand. She added that everyone overlooks the bold colour of the dress and its elegant cutting, it actually fits Jolin’s “contrasting/clashing” character.\n\nAfter 10 years, Jolin mocked herself again by appearing in the music video wearing the same outfit. During the interview at Ugly Beauty conference, she said that everyone seems to be pretty strict on her, she also doesn’t understand what mistake the outfit has done. She added,” It has been 10 years, I hope that I’m carrying it better than last time.”\n\nThis is the first 10 years of her participating Golden Melody Awards. The next post will be covering her GMA involvement from 2010 – 2016.\n\nTo end this part, I’d like to quote the last line of Dancing Diva’s lyrics, “Blurring the years and ages, no one has seen the happiness and sadness of a dancing diva”.\n\nGMA Edition:\n\nWhat is GMA?\n\nJolin & GMA 2000-2008\n\nJolin & GMA 2011-2016\n\nJolin GMA 2019\n\nThis is the first time Shifang Ma meeting and interviewing Jolin Tsai.\n\nShifang Ma （馬世芳）is an experienced radio announcer and columnist from Taiwan.

And I can observe the different role plays for the songs in this album.\n\nJo: Yes, it’s like a split of different roles and I like this feeling. I love role-playing and this opens up my imagination. Even though I don’t have the opportunity to act, but I’m curious about how the actors interpret the characters, how can they able to imitate/mimicking somebody and even their accents are so alike. That’s why I would love to try it in the recording room.\n\nMa: I think ‘PLAY’ album is the important turning point in your music career, right?\n\nJo: Yes, I’m becoming braver to perform, in visual form, it’s a breakthrough for me. When I was producing ‘PLAY’, I told my project manager that I want to act. That’s why in ‘PLAY’ music video, you can see some humorous, exaggerated expression. I think I have some talent in comedy. It helped to open up my heart to try many different things.\n\nMa: Also from the ‘PLAY’ album, you started to have more interaction/collab with Starr Chen continuously to ‘Ugly Beauty’. I’m amazed by the sound processing in this album, the bass of this album is killing.\n\nJo: Yes, this is my goal. I told Starr Chen that I want to strengthen the bass. He knew what I wanted because we have been working on during the ‘PLAY’ tour for so long. When I first met him while producing ‘PLAY’, I told him that “Kid, you really got the potential.” I’m like a senior. In dance-pop, both of us has our own opinion. He is exploring what I wanted. I don’t know a lot about his music background, I think he is quite smart and quirky. He explores every type of music and integrates into something we want.\n\nSetting Theme for Ugly Beauty\n\nMa: The working experience this time seemed different than your previous work. You also attended the music composing camps. How do you start to produce this album including songs selection and deciding the album’s concept? You’d need to decide on one thing then only continue to the next step?\n\nJo: I would set a big direction first. I would like to have an album for women, then I started to brainstorm about what’s a woman, I’d idolise what kind of woman. Cuz I’m used to the “man’s way” of working style in setting the work’s target. For example, you need to know which rank are you in. When I’m looking for the women I respect, I think it’s more abstract. So it’s quite hard for us to get the point. We started to think about what kind of images we have? like bad girl’s image. I also thought about if there is a woman character that you are not scared about her ‘soft weak’ image or her fierce image. Because in films or other female characters, we tend to adore female characters who are portrayed as assertive/aggressive which make us want to become them. On the other hand, the female characters being portrayed as soft, weak, we would think that they are having ‘Princess Syndrome’ (being self-centred & spoilt). It’s so vague, I’m thinking how can we define ‘Woman’. Typically, I thought young and beautiful equals to highly get attention, there might be a lot of limits. As it goes, I’m on this direction right until I read some books about the dark side. I only aware that’s the woman side that I’m looking for. I read Carl Jung’s book about spirituality, I found out the term called ‘dark side’ and then I found ’emotion’. I realized the woman that I actually looking for is me. I think this is a special path, I want to become the woman whom I adore. I need to know what kind of emotions I have, my strength is inside my emotion. After finishing the album, then only I understand my inspiration is so vague, it’s like walking in the dark and I need to find out what’s the answer.\n\nMa: In this album, David Ke is the lyrics coordinator (PIC to finalise the lyrics in the album). The lyrics coordinator role is interesting because you need to communicate with him about the concept of the album.\n\nJo: Actually the PIC has been changed several times, the people are different from the first year to the second year to the post-production. Then my company suggested me to work with David Ke because he wrote lyrics for me before. I’m not working closely with him and I think this is the album that I need to explain the most because most of them don’t understand what Ugly Beauty means. (Ma: How do you explain to them?) I said it’s not literally about ugly and pretty, it’s about the diversity of emotions that you do not dare to face, someone might think that these emotions are ugly, dirty or weak, we can’t show these emotions on live television. If you are tearing up on TV, the audience might say you’re begging for sympathy. Society is not willing to discuss and face these emotions. To me, these emotions are private, and I will have to face them so that I can fully understand myself. Through writing, I discovered more about myself, I also discovered that I’m good at asking myself questions. When I’m having a mood swing, it’s easier for me to look for the answers, it’s all about asking a good question.\n\nProcess of writing Necessary Evil\n\nMa: I think the sequence of the songs is interesting. The first opening song is ‘Necessary Evil’, it’s the song that set the style/theme of the album. The lyricist of this song is the late WeiJing Li, assisted by Razor Chiang. We all deeply miss WeiJing, it’s something new to learn that WeiJing was writing the lyrics. Can you explain to us?\n\nJo: The author of these lyrics was recommended by my manager because he likes her novels. Also because I want to learn more about women, of course, I need to start with Eileen Chang [張愛玲, She is a famous Chinese novelist writing about relationship and women’s stories]. Then, my manager recommended me to read WeiJing’s novels and I love it, why not I invite her to write lyrics for me. This is just a thought and we’re not sure whether she is willing to try. After meeting her, I got to know that she actually listens to K-pop songs and she was interested in writing dance-pop, that’s why she accepts the challenge. After chatting with her, she wrote a passage. I think it’s totally what we have discussed about the album. I met her, discussed with her about what I want to say and the direction to write the lyrics. (Ma: What do you mean by writing a passage?) So she wrote down the lyrics without following the melody, she just wrote what I want to express in a small passage, then Razor Chiang turned the passage into ‘Necessary Evil’ lyrics by arranging based on the rapping rhymes.\n\nMusic Composing Camp\n\nMa: Ugly Beauty is really superb, the process of making this album must be a brand new experience to you because you have spent so much effort in collaborating with different composers to do some brainstorming. Where did you go?\n\nJo: I went to Sweden, Thailand and the rest were in Taipei.\n\nMa: Let’s talk about the Asian pop scene especially dance-pop, we can see lots of involvement from Northen Europe these few years. Thailand’s pop music industry is booming as well, there is a long history of Thailand interacting with Taiwan’s pop music industry. How do you start interacting with international music composers?\n\nJo: During the ‘PLAY’ album, I’ve been working with the Northern European team. Besides collaborating with the former team, I also collaborated with 2 to 3 teams which under the same music company to write some songs. I was still a little scared when I just started composing with them because I don’t have any experience. During the first time, I’m not sure what they want to do, maybe there’s one who has already written a beat, but some teams don’t even have a beat to begin with, they would compose it on the spot, like Thailand’s team, the composers are from the UK. For example, we need to start composing tomorrow, they wrote something very rough the night before. When we start composing the music, they will start matching different instruments, also discussing the visual, singing the melody. First, we have 1 to 2 topliners and we will add more people. We didn’t have a target to write numbers of songs, it depends on how strong our idea direction is.\n\nMa: We need to explain to the audience about the “Music Composing Camp”. From the Taiwan music glorious era 80s, the division of work that we used to understand is there’s one who composes the music, one lyricist, then find one person to do the music arrangement, then find a singer to sing. Throughout the years of the development of Asian pop especially dance-pop, the music production is done by a team. From rhythm, verse to the chorus (or not divided into verse & chorus), the number of people in a team must be at least 3 members and more.\n\nJo: I think the biggest difference is we need to start with melody then look for the rhythm. However, dance-pop is the other way round. Sometimes, you have the melody, but the arrangement that you want could not match the melody. That’s why during the previous album, I said, can I have the beat first, then I’ll sing what I want. Last time, I didn’t fly to the country, I just did a rough version of beat that I want and sing a few sentences in Taipei then I send it to the team and the team will send back to me, back and forth. This album, I purposely fly to the country in person so I can provide direct feedback and they can amend it immediately. I think dance-pop is about your body needs to have responses when you listen to it.\n\nMa: So the sequence is different than what we have thought, rhythm is the priority. In this album, you will find out the rhythm is great, there are many works in it, it didn’t contain too much but there is something meticulous in it. The core is great and the bass is killing. So, the composers will start by doing the basic rhythm first, what’s next?\n\nLyrics\n\nJo: They will start composing the melody, start matching the arrangement and instruments followed by recording a demo. After that, we started collecting the lyrics. (Ma: You will simply sing the words during the demo stage?) Yes, (Ma: Simply throw in some English vocab and dragging?) Yes. (Ma: Then, you were looking for the lyrics?) Yes, the lyrics are the part that I spent most of the time, it took forever. Because I want to inform them about the theme, like Ugly Beauty, I will give the lyricist a topic. For some, I didn’t give them a topic, I will just give them a demo or melody, and see if we can have any fresh outcomes. Sometimes, I give them the direction and they will be very lost. If the outcomes are not what I want, why not just ditch the framework first and see whether the lyricist have any intuitive work by just listening to the tune.\n\nProcess of Writing Ugly Beauty\n\nMa: Ugly Beauty is a very short song, it only has 3 minutes 3 seconds, which is like the duration length of the early 21st century 78rpm recordings, that’s the early pop music standard because we couldn’t insert more songs. There’s a long time the pop songs are mainly 2 to 3 minutes long. Nowadays, songs are longer because they want to insert more elements. But Ugly Beauty is just 3 minutes and it still contains so many elements in it (in terms of the music, excluding the visual). Looking at the composer and lyricist, wow, it’s the outcomes from a team (Jo: ya, the Thailand team), written in Thailand, there’s a lot of idea in the sound processing. Can you help us to dissect the song?\n\nJo: This song is started from a very rough tune, we have the kissing sound and the variation at the end of the song which is the rap part first. After listening to these 2 parts, I have decided to write the melody together, I really like these 2 parts. Back to Taipei, I was hounding Starr Chen to death. I thought that we can still add more elements to the song, both of us have different opinions on the song and lyrics. That’s why we have been working on this song like forever, this is the last song that we have done in this album.\n\nMa: The lyrics of this song is contributed by QingFeng right? (Jolin’s awkward laughing)\n\nJo: I have given QingFeng this theme, he is a very clever lyricist. I really like his stuff. Maybe the time is not right, I haven’t approved these lyrics yet. Maybe after sometimes like half a year, this song has been abandoned and we were not willing to record it. We are thinking if this song can be improvised to more precise. We also have our own barrier, we could not say what we don’t like about this song, seems like lack of something. Poor QingFeng has written 4 versions of lyrics to us, totally four different versions. When I met him privately, I did not dare to talk about the progress of this song. I chatted with him in between. It’s very cruel that I have decided to use the first version at last. It proved that we have been thinking a lot. Music composing is like this, sometimes the most intuitive works are already there, and you keep going round in circles, end up spending more time. When I was doing the sound recording with Starr Chen, he thought there’s something wrong and me too. Then, I decided to sit back and listen to his suggestions, he said, “you can try to use this voice”. I was very pissed in the end, I said, “I’m like squeezing a voice for you, I don’t think that’s my voice, I feel like I’m trying to achieve what you wanted.”. I used to follow the producer’s orders, I will try very hard to squeeze out the voice they wanted, but I felt that I’m uncomfortable singing that, that’s not the character that I want. I said can you just leave me alone, let me try. That’s how communication started, not everything always goes smoothly. Sometimes he likes it but I’m in doubt, sometimes I agree with him. (Ma: It’s like the director and superstar) Haha, it’s because I’m close with him. (Ma: Sometimes when you have ideas, you can try both and observe which is the best) Yup, I’m learning how to communicate because I don’t communicate before that, I’ll just follow the producer. I can be a puppet, but then I think I need to take responsibility. I need to be able to express my feelings on the works and there’re interactions in the works.\n\nMa: We can clearly catch that this is the statement that Jolin wants to send and where she stands. It’s not role-playing or something that you squeeze out. It’s very hard to deal with this song, there are so many things in these 3 minutes, surprisingly it doesn’t sound gimmicky at all, there’s never a dull moment.\n\nMusic Video\n\nMa: When the music video is too great, you will not think about anything beyond the music video visual when you’re listening to a song.\n\nJo: Maybe because I was born in the music video era, so I don’t think there’s any difference if the song with or without the music video. But when you pointed it out, I quite agree.\n\nMa: Yes, like when you think about Michael Jackson’s ‘Thriller’ or ‘Bad’, you will think about the visual, how they dance (Jo: What they’re wearing), you won’t think about the song. Nowadays, music and music video are inseparable. I have a class with 100 students, I wanted them to do an assignment about the song that best represents our times, the majority of students wrote about “We’re All Different Yet The Same”, some students wrote ‘PLAY’, these bunch of kids were born after 1995.\n\nJo: Is it because of the story behind? What’s the subject title?\n\nMa: It’s a called “Literature Development and Pop Music Culture”, it’s about the history of pop music. When asking about the reasons for selecting these songs, their answers were mainly about the visual from the music video. To them, the music and music video is a package, they weren’t aware of the things we listen and see are actually different.\n\nJo: Do they think about this idea and agree with you?\n\nMa: Just like what you’ve said, they are born in the music video era, it’s a full package.\n\nJo: Maybe you can try setting a topic about their opinion on the songs without watching the visuals.\n\nMa: Ya, like asking whether they capable to ignore the music video and just focus on the song instead. But it’s not applicable to those who have already seen your music video though. It’s too late if you have watched the “Ugly Beauty” music video, the visual is too strong. (Jo: the director is really great!) ‘PLAY’ music video has become a hot issue, everyone would pause at each frame to look for the details. Youtube has made this thing possible which TV will not allow us to do it. “Ugly Beauty” music video is also the same.\n\nJo: I feel that the Grass Jelly team’s art production is very impressive, every time I walk into the studio and looking at the details, I very appreciate their precise work, their ideas are fresh and the team really have the coherence. Every time when I have this kind of teams, as a singer, I will think that I can unleash my potential and I would feel very secure. The director also has his own barrier when directing the music video because the title of the lead single has been changed several times. The tone and style of the song were different. The last meeting is almost near to our shooting dates. In the end, the director said he wanted to talk about my story, he wanted me to share more about what my album wanted to express, he even used voice recorder pen to record what I’ve said. He explored himself and one day he found out many of my controversies and he thought why not just shoot them. When I first listen to his idea, I didn’t realise he was talking about the stories that happened on my past, I was like listening to a script, like when he talked about the ‘seafood costume’, I was like that’s so fun, let’s shoot! Until I’ve seen the final cut, my god, then only I realize that’s my story. I felt like I wasn’t part of this, I have the feeling that I didn’t go through these issues before. That’s why I can totally understand why there are some books are related to “The Power of Now”. When you are facing fear, you can solve it by free/withdrawing/removing yourself from the situation. Like when I’m watching a movie, the stories belong to the characters, not us, then we will not feel so much pain. The sad emotion will not stay in your body for too long, I started to understand what the book is talking about because it happened in reality. When the director provided me with 20 ideas to let me choose, I was like shopping, I want this, this, this and this. He listed out my past 20 issues and let me pick like I’m picking a dessert. This is actually like a self-help moment, I have gone through all of them, you won’t feel you are still under the mud. This is a fresh experience for me, I think both of us are quite courageous to do this kind of things.\n\nThe Power of Now\n\nMa: Indeed, when you were going through the situation during that time, you must be thinking, why me?\n\nJo: Yes, I can confirm. During the album launching, the host was asking do you have anything to say to this girl, then my tears immediately gushed down, I felt like I’m not watching a story, I was speaking up for this girl. I was reluctant to leave the past. When I look back, I realize the whole process happened without you discover it. You have spent more than 10 years, you thought that’s not my story anymore but it’s actually still in my life forever. (Ma: It’s always there, the abandoned injuries will rot eventually if it’s not getting fixed.) Yes, this is the power of the dark side, (Ma: That’s why we need to read Carl Jung’s) Yup, it’s difficult and meaningful. (Ma: It’s an opportunity to open your scars, look at it, face it and clean it, it’s a good process to self-help yourself) The obvious difference that I aware of is I didn’t dare to mention something, I was too scared to even write about it or expressing it indirectly, I’m not ready to face it. If one day I can write it out directly without hiding, without feeling embarrassed or regretful, that’s the time I think I’m fully recovered, this is my biggest experience in this journey.\n\nMa: It’s definitely not bad, I need to say congratulations to you!\n\nJo: Yes, I also do something like that every day. The morning I woke up, I’ll say “you are very great” to myself!\n\nMa: Because you started to live under millions of eyeballs since your teenage years…\n\nJo: Yes, that’s why I think child stars are very hard. They can never ever escape from the public’s attention. Some things no matter good or bad, they are being exaggerated. It’s so helpless because I don’t have the power to control. One day I was getting compliments, the next day I will get defamation. During the days when you’re thinking ‘why me?’, it shows that you’re not confident enough. I also want to tell all the youth through my stories especially when ‘Youtuber’ is the thing, everyone wants to be remarkable, they would feel that they are insignificant when they listen to all those comments/opinions. Some even not able to find happiness, they don’t know how to gain confidence, they only think about whether my ‘likes’ exceed other creators. It’s so easy for us to lose the meaning of our life when we feel that we are worse than others (low self-esteemed). This album is also my personal journey, I want to use this story to encourage the youth and also my fans. I also hope that my story can influence how your life goes on.\n\nMa: yes, starting from inexplicable/unreasonable to forcing yourself to let go of yourself, it’s an assignment for different life phases. When the phase isn’t over, even though there is a majority of people applause for you, you would still be haunted by only one critic.\n\nJo: Is it something like the ‘black hole mode’ when you’re in a depression?\n\nMa: Yes, most of the time. If you can overcome this barrier, it’s something that worth celebrated. It’s very important like the concept you’ve said just now, you need to find your own value and not the compliments you get from other people because one day they will take it back. (Jolin: Yes, you will feel confused and lost.)\n\nLooking for the songs for UGLY BEAUTY and her own voice\n\nMa: 2019 is Jolin’s 20th debut anniversary. It also means that we hardly read the lyrics inside the album booklet. Do you suffer from long-sightedness? (Jo: I have very serious astigmatism) So you can’t read the lyrics in the album booklet? (Jo: I have someone to help me proofread the lyrics when making the mockup. I don’t read the words, I only look at the design.)\n\nMa: The title of “Life Sucks” will get banned by the Government Information Office 20 years ago. (Jo: Really?) Sometimes the album is released to the market, some audience will report that the album has harmful content, then the Government Information Office will order to ban the song from broadcasting. The company will need to retrieve the song or record a ‘clean version’ so that it can be played in the radio station. Luckily, you’re not in the era. Is this song the outcomes from the “Music Composing Camp”?\n\nJo: This song is the demo I have selected. When I start open files for this project, I have thousands of songs for me to pick, (Ma: Wait, are you serious? Literally thousands of songs?) Yes, it’s a lot. From time to time, I will receive lots of folders for me to pick. In the beginning, I couldn’t pick the songs that I want. (Ma: How do you listen to thousands of songs?) I will listen to the songs for a while because the folders come by batches. 1 folder will have approximately 60 songs. Some songs are selected from the demos. And because I still couldn’t find the important songs and lead single, that’s why I have the music camp. (Ma: Usually the company will filter out the songs for you to choose right?) I told my company to try to not filter out the songs because we have different likings. We have changed several A&R, I told them to just leave all the demos to me, they can do recommendation but don’t select for me. (Ma: No wonder you need to listen to thousands of songs) Ya, that’s why, there are so many genres of music.\n\nMa: After listening to so many songs, you must be very familiar with what’s the current trend in the market right now?\n\nJo: But the dance-pop demo that I’ve received have so similar style, so it’s not a tough job for me when picking the songs. (Ma: So, what everyone was doing?) I think there’s a lot of K-pop style, it’s like the typical K-pop format songs. And then when I want Hip Hop, R&B and Soul, there will be folders that contain so many similar songs. Same goes to Latin music. Some of the music arrangement in Ugly Beauty is more to Reggae because I want that style. The demos that I’ve received are similar to DJ Khaled or the current trendy beat. (Ma: It’s like everyone will just follow the current trend and compose the song that’s currently hit.) I have a very high standard on slow songs, I’ve sung for so many years, I’m thinking to go out of the old method, can I produce songs that can show my character or sends out the message that I want to express. I know my voice’s strength and weakness. Formerly I would just satisfy what the people said, they will say something like ‘you need to do a ballad love song”. When I was picking the slow song demos, they are way too slow, I would be very lost. I told my manager whether I can skip all the slow songs. I enjoy picking fast songs because I like fast songs, that’s why I’m inspired when picking it. When writing the slow songs, I would try to express based on my shape of the mouth, I don’t want to increase my vocal range for the sake of high pitch or for the sake of showing off. The emotions, the ways of telling a story are what I’ve lacked those days. I’m like trying to be aMei, but I’m actually not that kind of material. I’ve set my target wrongly. When I was having an impromptu singing lesson with my tutor YunHui, she encouraged me by saying there is some part of my voice is very nice. You can just sing what you want, then only I realize the characteristic of my voice. We would use our ear to listen to others’ voice but we won’t listen to our voice when we are humming, maybe we will listen to our own when we are showering. But during the impromptu class, you will feel that there is someone right beside you, you will be scared, worrying you are not on harmony, you will start limiting yourself. YunHui will encourage me, she said it’s fine to sing wrongly but she wanted me to have emotions. Thus, during the class, I’m very free, unrestrained, I’m aware that my voice can achieve this and it leads me to do the music camp. (Ma: When were you having the class with YunHui?) It’s about 3-4 years ago. (Ma: 3-4 years ago? You have debuted for more than 10 years already.) Yes, I’ve been singing in incorrect ways. I always think that skill is important, that’s why I’ve been taking a variety of vocal lessons. My vocal tutor said I can do it because my voice belongs to soprano, not alto. But what’s the reason that’s stopping me? That time, I’m not fully aware. I only want to train my voice like training my muscle, vocal cord is also a type of muscle. They taught me I need to train my vocal cord so that it can be stretched. I know this concept but I always feel that I don’t like my voice. I think my voice lack of something. After that, only I know my voice is lack of emotion, lack of courage, lack of freedom. Everyone always says that you need to have a ‘big’ voice to become a singer. It’s my character, I like to be fully prepared, making sure everything is perfect then only I’m okay. When producing this album, every step is being reduced and minimalised, breaking my ‘rituals’, then only I can fully enjoy singing the song. In the album, there are some songs that contain my imperfect voice, the voice of me getting out of breath, I will still think that those are the character that I want to present. In the recording album, you can receive the emotions instantly just like in the movies, the expression in the characters’ eyes, recording album can also provide the same feelings. Therefore, I’m braver to perform in the recording room. I used to blame myself in the recording room when I can’t reach a certain pitch.\n\nMa: Sigh, it’s like the “Top Student Syndrome”.\n\nJo: Yes! That’s when I know perfect is actually quite stressful, I will never ever achieve perfect because I always self-criticize myself. (Ma: There’s no scientific standard about perfect, you can’t achieve the perfect state.) I keep telling myself that it’s enough, I need to accumulate my confidence, learning about my own strength, focusing on these instead of looking at others’ strength and chasing after them. In the end, you lose your identity and characteristic.\n\nMa: Able to find your voice’s characteristic, first time seriously listening to your own voice and found out your voice’s identity.\n\nJo: You will be touched by your own voice, it’s not the narcissist, it’s like when the top student discovered that she is deeply moved by her own voice. We usually deeply moved by someone’s voice but when it happened, I’ll be curious about how this happens. That’s something cannot be taught by my tutor.\n\nMa: You will need to feel it by yourself because when you feel disappointed about yourself, you hate yourself, you are not able to discover your own good. Then, you need to depend on others to encourage yourself to be more hardworking. Eventually, you might misunderstand that as long as I’m hardworking, I will be excellent. The truth is, they are two different things. You can be very good actually, there is something that you can obtain without being hardworking. But you can’t. Rationally, you could not accept that there is something that can be obtained without spending effort. You will feel like this is not “Top students”.\n\nJolin: Yesss, like it’s a must for us to work really hard, accepting critics then only we can achieve something. Totally different logic.\n\nMa: The last song in the album, “Shadow Self” is like the subject we have discussed just now. The idea and the writing process is not like the regular method.\n\nJolin: When we were writing this song, we actually planned to write a fast song. We decided to take a break because we were not inspired no matter how hard we are trying. Then, I asked my partners to play the piano and guitar, then we decided to jam and just like that. We were in this small recording room, we just humming and singing then recording it, just like that. When I was singing, I’m moved by myself because I felt that I’m very free, freedom kind of moved. It’s like you are in the ocean, a very broad endless ocean. There are story and emotion in it, there’s an image pop up when I was singing.\n\nFace your Fear & Searching Answers\n\nMa: After debuting for 20 years, Jolin finally found her own voice, (Jo: The most comfortable and best way to express myself) the whole journey is interesting because it seems like the usual way to produce an album in the beginning, but its standard is bigger. Usually, a company will only listen to 100 demos but you have listened to thousands of demos and still not able to pick the songs. It shows that you have your own ideas, you are clear with what you don’t want. What do you want? Instead of keep waiting for the songs, why not you create your own. I think this an interesting learning experience (Jo: Yess, totally worth it.). Every segment from composing to produce to record to sing, and you finally can identify the person you want to be.\n\nJo: Actually start from setting the direction of the album, this is the first step. It’s like peeling onion, I’m taking out things that I don’t like and I able to see the core inside. I need to continuously face something that I afraid. I’m afraid of communication, afraid of not getting what I want, afraid of singing wrongly, afraid of not enough skills, afraid of people don’t like what I have selected, there’s always doubt in my heart. But, for sure, I want to look for the answers, I’m certainly sure. And then in between, there were fewer newly added assisting partners, to me they’re like the person that answer my questions including my producers, YunHui (tutor), the composers from the music camp, PIC for mixing, music video, styling and photographers, everyone is working for this. Of course, I would doubt myself if I was making the wrong decision. (Ma: What would you do?) I’ll remind myself to look back my goals. My goal is to tell everyone about my story, that simple. I don’t want to make money or reach a higher rank, I only want to share my story. Because this album energizes me when I found emotions, found out how do I gain confidence and I was formed. I want to share with everyone, it feels like publishing a book. This is my goal, I shouldn’t expect it whether it will succeed or viral, care about the compliments and critics. I should throw them out so that I can stand firm. (Ma: It’s hard to throw them out.) Especially when I’m producing ‘Ugly Beauty’, I have this doubt, self-doubt. Then only I acknowledge that I need to very clear about my goal and no turning back, just go forward, that’s all. When we are working on a goal, turns out, it will become profit-oriented. Then I need to adjust myself to what’s my core content is, this is a valuable lesson for me.\n\nLove your body\n\nMa: Every song in this album has a story to tell. There’s an important song called “Womxnly”, it seems like the sequel of “We are different, yet the same”. Written by Ashin and you.\n\nJo: We have the melody first, I wrote it with Razor Chiang. When I first heard the beat and he was arranging the beat, I’m already writing the lyrics. The feelings I have on this song is I think that my body is so free. I knew what kind of lyrics that I want to write. I have jotted down all the important keywords. While I’m selecting a song and listening to the beat, the images will pop up. It’s not that detailed, but I know what’s my direction so I’ll write down a brief narrative. Then, we also discussed that maybe we can write about ‘Rose Teen’ (YungChih Yeh) as the title. Soon, I found out that I lack vocabulary. I think that I’m writing about the freedom of the body. I think that YungChih has inspired me a lot since the ‘PLAY’ tour. I also think that’s about the story of the body. I think that what I’ve written is not profound so I seek help from Ashin. I told him that I have this song, you can change everything, it’s ok, I don’t mind, I hope that you write about ‘Rose Teen’. When composing the melody, the core is to write about the body, I want to love my body. When I was in front of the mirror, I need to love my body without restraint. Regardless if it’s following the society’s stereotype about sex, what girls should have, what boys should have. I want to ditch all the ‘rules’, this is what I feel about this song. Until the title is set, I think that my lyrics is not enough, I need more insightful adjectives. When I read Ashin’s lyrics, my god, I felt like I’m illiterate. Compare to mine, his lyrics are so accurate and spot on, maybe because I’m not experienced in writing lyrics. I can only describe a big framework, but he can narrow it down, every word is meaningful. (Ma: He brings out the plot and visual.) and emotion!\n\nMa: So which part of the lyrics are by you?\n\nJo: The English part? Hahahaha, and also the body part, “Try to imagine when you switched to his body” (Ma: “Sexuality, be careful on what will hurt you” this part too?) Yes. (Ma: With this guidance, Ashin can give us more profound images and plot.) Ya, he wrote about the rose and the emotion. He didn’t emphasize on the social impact, (Ma: but he has written everything.) yes, and it’s poetry. (Ma: “You complain in silence, But a lot of truth has been confessed, Awaken numerous genuine heart.” Ashin actually has a social responsibility.) Yes, “You complain in silence”, after singing the song, I’ll feel like crying.\n\nMa: I think there’s a lot of people would say thank you to you. Because as an influential public figure, you make lots of people aware of these stories through your work.\n\nJo: I actually don’t know about the responsibility of an idol, I’m an idol right? During the ‘PLAY’ tour, I got the feedback from my fans. Actually, the meaning of the song is not only glamorous, but it can also encourage people through what you want to say to the public. It’s not only about love.\n\nSlow Songs\n\nMa: As Jolin said, there is at least one love song/ ballad or slow song in every album, this time we have 3 slow songs and they are totally different.\n\nJo: Yes, I always think that I can have some slow songs that derived from my dance-pop songs and also match with them. That’s why the arrangement is dramatic. ‘Shadow self’, ‘Romance’ and ‘Vulnerability’, I hope there’re music video visuals in the music arrangement.\n\nMa: Furthermore, the rhythm being formed is very high class, Howe Chen is amazing.\n\nJo: When collaborating with him, he really understand the music arrangement that I want. In ‘Romance’ and ‘Vulnerability’, he took full responsibilities in arranging the music, I didn’t limit him. (Ma: ‘Vulnerability’ is like soft rock arrangement) A little retro feel, (Ma: Ya, it’s like 70s tone. Romance is more modern.) Romance is a little dark and ghostly feel.\n\nMa: You have sung many harmonies on many channels for this song. Are you feeling unrestraint when singing the song?\n\nJo: I was like suffocating when singing this song because the music arrangement makes me think that I don’t have to sing it forcefully. Based on the lyrics, I think that it’s useless even though I yell for help. Like I’m already dead, losing hope for everything, feeling fatigued after crying, I was applying all these feelings to sing this song like I’m passing away soon. (Ma: Wyman Wong need to bear some responsibilities, why did he write these lyrics. )\n\n20th Anniversary\n\nMa: It’s your 20th debut anniversary, are you planning for your international tour?\n\nJo: I’ve mentioned it to my company, I hope that we can do it this year. We are writing the script and looking for the production team. I’m excited about the concert because I can share the visuals and imaginations that I have from ‘UGLY BEAUTY’ with everyone. Of course, there are some technical limitations or location limitations, but as long as I can interact live with the audience, it’s a totally different feeling when you’re in the recording room. That will ‘electrify’ me, the concert is like the powerhouse to me. (Ma: Standing on the stage, seeing many people cheering for you and looking at you down there, you are like electrified.) Yes, but when you are waiting at the stage before the show starts, that makes me nervous. The audiences are like expecting something.\n\nMa: Jolin has debuted for 20 years, you have seen everything. Are you still nervous when you’re on the stage?\n\nJo: I would be nervous if I’m presenting something new, like a new tour, new choreography, going to stage the next day. Am I going to miss one step? (Ma: You need to handle all 100 details when you’re performing on stage, changing clothes, the walking position, doing the action.) Yes, I think my mind is so busy when I’m singing a slow song, I will get stunned. I’m actually getting used to it, I can dance when singing slow songs, the audiences might think I’m too busy. To me, it’s easier for me to remember the steps than standing still and walking only. I felt like I want to do something more.\n\nFans\n\nMa: Let’s talk about your fans. You mentioned that you have left the comfort zone while producing this album. How do you imagine your fans? What’s the image of your fans?\n\nJo: I don’t think about my fans when I’m writing songs. I feel like I’m challenging myself when I’m writing music. I would think about them when I have finished doing the album, I felt like I’m awake from the dream, I’m ready to present my album to them. Of course, I would make sure that it’s something that excites me, it will not change. But when I think that my hardcore fans might not used to the music, I’ll feel a little nervous. I don’t know where I got my confidence from, but I’m sure the fans will get used to it. I’m not really sure but I’m confident they know what I’m doing. I want my fans to be happy about my last album because it’s ‘PLAY’, I want to express that I can entertain you all. This time is totally personal, it’s not only happy, but there’re also stories that the fans don’t want to get reminded about, the history of them getting despised just because they support me. It’s different. I always get the feedback from the fans saying, “my friends would tease me when I’m supporting you last time”. They are like confessing to me, either they hate me at the beginning or their point of views about me. A lot of the comments that I received have this ‘twist’, and I think it’s interesting. Of course, I’m not expecting everyone to support the same artist forever, but it’s weird to think there is someone who supports me for 15, 18 or 20 years. When you open their drawer, you can find out something that the fans are scared to say to me during the journey of supporting me. After listening to the album and watching the music video, they are like opening a desk, opening a pandora box, there are lots of emotions pouring out, I don’ think that’s bad. I also hope that you can also find out something hidden in your drawer. Like when you were criticising the person or yourself those days, do you think it’s right? are you still in the same situation? I want to remind everyone about this. (Ma: Ya, you think that is a dark history but it’s actually a very genuine relationship.) Yes, this album can unite me and my fans.\n\nMa: After listening to this album, I noticed the ways you sing, how you apply your voice, the key is the answer that you have told us. You found the comfortable and favourite way for you to sing, every song is a story that you want to talk about, you have used various ways to create the music that you wanted, and the outcomes seem so effortless，it just happens that way. (Jo: Thank you!) The album was produced so down-to-earth, the sound mixing is very high class, it’s also the contribution from all the talents and geniuses.\n\nJo: Yes indeed! I’m really thankful to all the producers that I’ve met while making this album and also those who work behind the scenes. Some I’ve never seen in person before like the music arrangers, the instrumental musicians. I hope that there is more excellent youth to get encouraged by more people. Like the “Sweet Guilty Pleasure”’s music arranger, I just found out that 10 years ago when he is still a child, he presented a bouquet of flowers for me before. He told me that he went to my show in Vegas before, he even showed me the photo. And now, he arranged the music for me. This story is really inspiring, he likes dance-pop just because he be in touch with me and now he is working for me. Of course, I hope there are more people to participate in making dance-pop. I discovered that there are some people thinks that dance-pop is for people who don’t have singing talents, it can cover your flaws just because there are so many layers of tracks in the song or thinking dance-pop is for the artist who never sings before. I’m thinking that dance-pop is being divided. I hope there are more and more dance-pop composers to create an image for C-pop’s dance pop.\n\nMa: Let’s think about the term, “Dancing Singers”. Michael Jackson, Madonna, Rihanna and Lady Gaga are “dancing singers”, Jolin Tsai is also a dancing singer and she sings better and better! I also want to congratulate you. Just like what you’ve said, you are able to use your sources to create a platform for all the talented young musicians.\n\nJo: I’m very welcoming all of you who can convince me and ‘electrify’ me regardless of your background. (Ma: But you have to go through the 1000 demos first!) You are welcomed to join my team.\n\n-end-"
