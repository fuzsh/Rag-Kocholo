        "text": "John and Susie met over a decade ago in chemistry class at Bothell High School. John sat in front of Susie, and they immediately became great friends and even went to Prom together later on. LIttle did they know, they would be getting married after spending almost every day together for six years and raising a very special canine boy named Howie together. After college, John traveled around to pursue winemaking for a number of years, and Susie earned her PhD in Pharmacy. In November of 2017, John and Susie both came back to Washington and went out for coffee (and a glass of champagne or two) at a small cafe called “the Newsroom.” Fast forward to New Year's Eve in Anacortes, they shared their first kiss and have been inseparable ever since. Over the six years of dating, it has not always been easy, but John and Susie learned to overcome obstacles together, learn from each other, support each other, and love each other like family. When you share a love like Susie and John do, there is nothing left to do but get married! In their free time, Susie and John love to disappear into a mountain to find a great alpine lake to camp on but also love to snuggle up for a chill movie night with Howie. They are thrilled to have their loved ones celebrate and witness their love and the most important step in starting their future as a married couple and starting a family together."
