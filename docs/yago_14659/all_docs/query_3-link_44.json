        "text": "SERIES I, CORRESPONDENCE, 1781-1805, consists primarily of letters exchanged between members of the Lee family. Jonathan Lee maintained a regular correspondence with family members, including his parents, brothers, sisters, and his wife. Early letters consist of messages from Jonathan Lee to family members as he studied at Yale College and Andover Theological Seminary. Lee wrote regularly and in great detail of his studies and life at school. Lee also corresponded with family members while in the Michigan Territory during the 1820s and 1830s. He ventured there as a representative of the American Home Missionary Society, and engaged in religious work in the area of Tecumseh, Michigan. Lee exchanged religious views and family information from the Midwest, and he continued this correspondence upon his return to New England in the 1830s, after which he assumed positions in Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. During the 1840s he corresponded with his offspring quite regularly, including several letters to and from his daughter Harriet, as she recuperated from an illness in an Utica, New York asylum.\n\nSERIES II, SERMONS, 1812-1836, consists of several handwritten sermons which Lee delivered in the course of his religious training and practice. These sermons, as indicated on the text, were often delivered several times in a variety of locations in and around New England.\n\nSERIES III, VOLUMES, 1804-1844, consists of a commonplace book, a journal (1804-1844), and several notebooks which Lee compiled in the course of his academic work at Yale College (1808-1809).\n\nThe Lee Papers were donated by William Todd and supplemented by purchases, in 1941.\n\nUnpublished materials authored or otherwise produced by the creator(s) of this collection are in the public domain.
