You can find all of your wedding details, including directions to our venue, registry information, and a little bit about our story. Please also use this website to RSVP! We can’t wait to see you there— thank you for your support and warm wishes so far. Love, Joy & Jonathan\n\nWe met through Skype, after being introduced by Joy's cousins, Jeremy and Kathleen, and Jonathan's sister, Diane. After talking for several months and developing a friendship, we met in Austin, Texas in person for the first time. After 2.5 years of long-distance dating, we decided to finally tie the knot and become one. We are both blessed to have found each other and are forever grateful that God brought us together. We can't wait to celebrate our wedding with all of our friends and family."
