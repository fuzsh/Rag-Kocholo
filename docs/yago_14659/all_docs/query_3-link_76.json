        "text": "Jonathan Lee Allmett, age 36, formerly of Atlanta, GA and most recently of Houston, TX passed away on Monday, August 20, 2007. Our most giving and loving husband, son, brother and friend slipped from our arms to enter eternal peace. Jonathan was born in Epsom Surrey, England on February 23, 1971. He moved with his family to Texas in 1978 and spent the remainder of his childhood in Houston. He attended the Houston School for the Performing & Visual Arts and graduated from Eisenhower High School and was a current student at The University of Houston. Jonathan joined the Marines and spent four years stationed in Okinawa, Japan and in the Philippines. Jonathan was a professional musician whose incredible voice and stage presence left his listeners spellbound. During his remarkable life, Jonathan wrote and recorded countless original songs both with his band, Garrison Field, and as a solo artist. CDs include \"Open\", \"Dawn\", \"Nowhere is Too Far\", and \"Some Trees Grow Bananas\". Jonathan touched thousands of lives through his music. He also recorded two Christmas CD compilations for charities. He was the musical director for Camp Twin Lakes special needs camps for the last 8 years. His work with the camp kids was the most significant of his life; every single one of their hearts touched his. Jonathan recently joined Bootleggers Music Venue in Minneapolis as a partner in charge of all booking and entertainment. He also recorded commercials for Earhole Agency, Leo Burnett Agency and Spank Agency in Chicago. He leaves behind his wife, Dr. Michelle Ludwig of Houston, whom he recently married on May 26, 2007, his parents John and Carol Allmett of Panama City Beach, FL, brothers Colin and Justin Allmett of Atlanta, his Nan Iris Poulter of Wiltshire, England, uncles Malcolm and Geoffrey Poulter, and many other relatives in the UK. Jonathan had the most vibrant personality and giving heart of any angel on earth. His generosity to all who had the pleasure of sharing his life will always be remembered. Without him, our hearts are broken and our tears run endless, but our memories and joys are immeasurable. If love could have saved him, he would have lived forever and now the pause in our hearts is from the echo of Jonathan. The services for Jonathan Lee Allmett will take place on Saturday, August 25, 2007: 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM Visitation at A.S. Turner and Sons Funeral Home in Decatur, GA; 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM Visitation at Grace United Methodist Church in Atlanta, GA; 3:00 PM Memorial Service at Grace United Methodist Church. Burial at Decatur City Cemetery will follow the service. Family and friends will gather at Camp Sunshine House after the interment. The family knows that many of Jonathan's loved ones were the children from his camps. The gathering at Camp Sunshine House will be a time of celebration in honor of Jonathan's life. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to Camp Sunshine, Camp Kudzu, or Twin Lakes Camp. For addresses and information, contact A.S. Turner and Sons Funeral Home, 2773 N. Decatur Road, Decatur, GA 30033 Phone: 404-292-1551 www.asturner.com"
