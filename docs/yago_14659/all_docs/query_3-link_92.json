Two recent funerals (beautiful outpourings of love for men who loved the Lord very much) served as reminders that we never know how many days we have left. But those days are indeed numbered. If you don't know an attorney, reach out to me and I'd be glad to offer suggestions. #estateplanning #financialplanning\n\nIn most marriages, there are two types of people: one is the spender and one is the saver. When my son, Luke was about eight years old, he was figuring stuff out. He said to me, “I think I understand how this works. Dad makes the money and mom spends the money. Is that right?” It is pretty close. You know, she is not a saver. She is a spender. A good strategy for that is for the spenders to get an allowance. And then the savers are required to spend something on yourself each month. You have to buy something as part of self-care. Then, the spenders get a budget and they figure it out. #Churchillleadership #marriage #spenderandsaver\n\nFebruary: Love is in the Air!

Funerals and funeral choices were at the discretion of their owners. Quite often the carcass would be left to rot in public view of the other Enslaved; this served as a deterrent for runaways! It was usual practice for the Enslaved families to build their own coffins. This would consist of 6 pieces of wood creating a box. Once freed, Black families upgraded to elaborate Caskets which demonstrated wealth, comfort for the deceased and ultimately freedom. Today families still insist on purchasing beautiful caskets for the very same reasons. Quite often my families ask me the difference between a coffin and a casket? My usual response is that “Dracula steps out of a coffin”. Irrespective of length and width, a casket has four sides. A coffin has six sides. Three weeks ago we buried triplet babies. Each were buried in caskets.? Caskets can be opened half way (half couch) or the entire lid can be opened (full couch) apparently caskets held a padded area that mourners could ‘sit on’ hence ‘’a couch. American caskets can be wooden or metal and are extremely popular amongst Clergy and higher ranking individuals. However irrespective of rank, Black people love a casket. Prices range from £1,000 to £30,000 Maxine Edgar\n\nAre you familiar with funeral honorariums and their role in the funeral process? This month, we're taking a deep dive into this topic with a five-part series, posting every Sunday in December. At a funeral, there are many expenses to consider - the professional services of the funeral home staff, the casket or urn, the cremation permit, the cemetery plot, and more. Among these costs is the honorarium, which is often overlooked. We'll be answering five key questions to help you understand the role of honorariums and how they factor into the funeral process. #honorarium, #5partseries, #December, #funeralexpenses, #honorariumfacts #everysunday #resthavenfuneralhome #cemetery #cremation"
