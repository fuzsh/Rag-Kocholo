        "text": "Meet singer-songwriter, producer, and pianist from Hong Kong, TikChi 迪子.\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself.\n\nI’m TikChi – a singer-songwriter, producer, musician and pianist that was born and raised in Hong Kong. Joined a rock band and started writing my own songs back in high school, and once graduated I ignored all the discouragement my family gave me and went on to study Fine Art for a year. A record label discovered and signed me after a few years, after a while it felt like the best way for me to express myself through my music was for me to manage it myself, so I left the record label and became an indie artist. Going independent meant I could finally write music the way I want, cult is something I really like but the record label never let me tap into, and now I finally have the freedom to do whatever style or genre of music I want.\n\nDescribe the city you’re living in and what it’s like to live there.\n\nDynamic, expensive and busy little city, packed with dream chasers, it’s hard to take a break from the hustle and bustle.\n\nDynamic, expensive and busy little city, packed with dream chasers, it’s hard to take a break from the hustle and bustle.\n\nWhat is the best and worst thing about living in your city?\n\nA really great place for workaholics or those who want to earn some hard-earned cash real quick, but it’s not the best place if seeking work-life balance.\n\nGive us 3 words that describe what it’s like to be a creative in your city.\n\nMad, materialistic, cold.\n\nHow did you start your career in art?\n\nBegan piano lessons when I was just three. To me, that’s where it all started.\n\nWere the people around you supportive of your decision on working as a creative?\n\nWould not have made it this far if it wasn’t from the support of my friends and fans.\n\nWhat are some goals and ambitions you have for your future work?\n\nBeing able to travel the world to share my music, and sing in my mother tongue.\n\nBeing able to travel the world to share my music, and sing in my mother tongue.\n\nIf you could collaborate with any person in the world who would it be?\n\nSheena Ringo, Sandy Lam, DEAN, TaeYang… Basically, anyone who is super talented.\n\nHow would you describe the women around you?\n\nBrave, independent, feeling for justice, have their own mind and traces of thoughts.\n\nWere there any local female creatives that you looked up to when you were growing up?\n\nFaye Wong!!\n\nAre there any challenging aspects of being a female in your industry?\n\nI’ve only just recently found out about this — people in Hong Kong are actually still quite close-minded, for example, women are expected to get married by 30, and finding a good husband is your best achievement in life. Women’s self-value will decline as she ages, and in a way, it feels like women are just men’s property. Women are very easily labeled as a slut, whereas if the same thing was done by men it would just be seen as a fling.\n\nBe passionate in what you do, don’t settle with how people define you, live your own life.\n\nDo you have any advice to young women who are aspiring to work in your field?\n\nBe passionate in what you do, don’t settle with how people define you, live your own life."
