        "text": "The marriage of Jonathan Lee Davis, 14, and Shirley Davis, 44, is such a rarity that the story appears in the current issue of the National Enquirer. The couple also will appear on the Sally Jessy Raphael Show on Nov. 27. They were flown last week to New York to tape the show.\n\n\"Most of the audience didn't like it,\" Jonathan said. \"They said it wouldn't last.\"\n\nJonathan, who moved to Gadsden two years ago, and Shirley, who was born there, met for the first time last year, when Jonathan was 13.\n\n\"When I set eyes on him, it was like fireworks!\" Shirley is quoted as saying in the Enquirer.\n\nShirley, who is divorced, has five children, ranging in age from 7 to 23. She hired Jonathan as her babysitter.\n\nAfter they realized that they were in love and had decided to get married, they had many problems.\n\nFirst, Jonathan's parents would not consent to the marriage. In Alabama, the law says that a 14-year-old can only get married with a parent's permission. Jonathan and Shirley would not give up.\n\n\"I told my mother that since I was living with her, it didn't matter,\" Jonathan said. \"I said that I would marry her when I am 16 anyway.\"\n\nJonathan's mother eventually consented to the marriage, but the couple had to drive out of town to find a judge who would perform the ceremony.\n\nJonathan was best friends with Shirley's 11-year-old son before the marriage, and they still are. His relationships with his other stepchildren are different.\n\n\"Rachel (the 7 year-old) thinks of me as \"daddy,' \" he said. \"The older children don't like me.\""
