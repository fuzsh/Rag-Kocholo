        "text": "An important update on charity campaigning from the CharityCommission. To find out about other guidance and legislation governing charity campaigning during General Elections then just sign up for my webinar next week! https://lnkd.in/dr6Nwvyx #GeneralElection #CharityCampaigning\n\nThe 5 Behaviours is one of Aspire's 'go-to' frameworks because it is simple, powerful and practical. If you want to improve YOUR board's/team's performance, get in touch at enquiries@aspiremcl.co.uk, or call 020 3904 7501. Check out some of Aspire MCL's testimonies here: https://lnkd.in/gK7eB-K #boarddynamics #teambuilding #thefivebehaviours #aspiremcl\n\nUnderstandably a lot of focus on the general election at the moment, but some other useful updates including one about having your say to steer changes for the Governance Code. Any questions or if you want to sign up to our mailing list, let me know!\n\nCharities know that it's important to build trust with the public. In this video, Helen Stephenson CBE, CEO of the Charity Commission for England and Wales, explains why trust and reporting go hand in hand. Discover more about @PwC UK's Building Public Trust Awards https://pwc.to/3wPnRX8 #Charity #Reporting #BuildingPublicTrust\n\nThis story identifies a common theme for teams who take on critical emergencies and respond with superhuman behaviors to get the job done on time and at highest quality. Without a roadmap for the team before, during, and after critical incidents, the result can be burnout, cynicism, and toxic behaviors. Enter Everything DiSC and the Five Behaviors for teams to identify behavioral strengths and opportunities for improvement for individual team members and their teams. We've seen results like these and look forward to providing the same roadmap for you and your team. Let's do this together! #teameffectiveness #teamleadership #teamcoaching #JHCAPN\n\nCheck out our newest blog all about the role of trustees within charities! We have a lot of blogs on there which may be useful to you, charities and trustees! To find out more > https://buff.ly/3mZiEd0"
