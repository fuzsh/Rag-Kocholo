He was known as Emil Chau through the 1980s and 1990s, and by 2000 he reverted to his given name Wakin. As of August 2007, he has released more than 40 albums and held several international concert tours.\n\nWakin had high hopes to establish a career as a recording artist, and he actively sought out contacts in the music industry. But a persistent lack of interest eventually led him to give up trying to become a performer â instead, he could sign on as an assistant producer at Rock Records, where he wrote marketable pop songs for other artists.\n\nJonathan Lee - Li Zongsheng\n\nJonathan Lee is a Taiwanese record producer, singer, and songwriter. Throughout the mid-1980s through the 1990s, he composed song lyrics and melodies for numerous musical artists in the Rock Records label, including Angus Tung, Sarah Chen, Sandy Lam, Sylvia Chang, Winnie Hsin, Tarcy Su, Jeff Chang, Jackie Chan, Chao Chuan, and Wakin Chau.\n\nLee is hailed as one of the godfathers of Taiwanese Mandopop. He was one of the most successful producers of the 1990s and 2000s and has been credited with building Rock Records into the foremost independent label in Asia.
