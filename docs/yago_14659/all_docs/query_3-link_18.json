        "text": "Jonathan Lee Craig, a beloved member of the Liberty, Texas, community, passed away on June 25, 2024, at the age of 42. He was well-known and greatly admired by his co-workers and customers both at the old Express Lube on Highway 90 and, more recently, at Main Street Car Wash. A devoted husband, father, and grandfather, Jonathan leaves behind his wife, Jennifer Jannise Craig; a son, Jonathan Craig, Jr., 20; a daughter, Kaylee Marie Craig, 15; and a six-month-old grandson, Jonathan Craig, III.\n\nJonathan lived his entire life in Liberty, where he forged deep connections and left a lasting impact. He ran cross country for Liberty High School’s Class of 2001, and he was a role model to the many young men he worked with over the years.\n\nIn 2001, Jonathan married his high school sweetheart, Jennifer, and together they built a loving family. Jonathan adored his children, Jonathan and Kaylee, and cherished every moment spent with them. His family was his anchor, and he found great joy in family activities, especially simple pleasures like fishing and riding go-carts.\n\nJonathan always had a natural talent for mechanics. This talent was nurtured by his maternal grandfather, Lawrence David Scott, who passed away several years ago. Starting with Bobby Pope at Express Lube and later with Brian Carter at Main Street Car Wash, Jonathan’s skills and dedication earned him a reputation as someone who could tackle any mechanical challenge.\n\nJonathan was not only skilled with his hands but also known for his selflessness and willingness to help others. Whether it was fixing a car on the side of the road or lending a hand with household repairs, Jonathan was always ready to assist, embodying the true spirit of community.\n\nBeyond his work and hobbies, Jonathan had a fondness for watching wrestling and “The Jerry Springer Show” on television, and he loved snacking on chips and salsa with a refreshing Coke by his side.\n\nBorn on October 8, 1981, in Liberty, Texas, Jonathan was the cherished son of James Larry Craig and Connie Sue Scott Craig.\n\nJonathan is survived by his devoted wife of 23 years, Jennifer Craig; his children, Jonathan Jr. and Kaylee Marie; his parents, Larry and Connie Craig; his sister, Cassandra Hughes; his grandchild, Jonathan Lee Craig III; his in-laws, Brenda Jannise and Toby Jannise; brothers-in-law, Justin Jannise, TJ Jannise and wife Ruby; nephews, Gerardo Delosreyes, TJ Jannise and a host of extended family members and friends who will deeply miss him.\n\nVisitation for Jonathan will be held on Saturday, June 29, 2024, from 10:00-11:00 a.m. at Pace Stancil Funeral Home in Dayton, Texas, followed by a funeral service at 11:00 a.m. The service will be officiated by Pastor Kim Percival.\n\nJonathan Lee Craig will be remembered for his kind heart, his unmatched skills as a mechanic, and his unwavering dedication to his family and community. His presence will be greatly missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him. May he rest in peace."
