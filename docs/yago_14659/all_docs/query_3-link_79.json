This deed was this day exhibited in this office with the certificate of acknowledgement thereon written and admitted to record. <br/< Signed: Teste Wm. ROBINSON, D. C. <br/<\n\nNote by Niblick-85: This is the only deed we have found where Jonathan signed his middle initial. However, the signature is not in his handwriting.\n\nAncestry Profile: #390078111585\n\n1998 Ancestral File (An online database On FamilySearch.org)\n\n1997 Ordinance Index (Latter Day Saints Record, maybe old AIS?)\n\n2000 Ordinance Index (Latter Day Saints Record, maybe old AIS?)\n\nResearch Notes\n\n(By Niblick-85 in AUG 2024, not a descendent of Jonathan Right Lee, but a descendant of Zachariah Lee and Jean Right.)\n\nAccording to an Ancestry Tree, (link above) Delilah Dooley was born 1813 Botetourt Co. VA and died 23 MAY 1884 Kanawha Co. WV.\n\nIt is unknown when Jonathan married Delilah Dooley. The same Ancestry Tree claims it was 1831 and that they had 5 children:\n\nMary Elizabeth Lee b. 1832 d. 1905\n\nGeorge Lee b. 1834\n\nLucy Jane Lee b. 1840 d. 1877\n\nFrances Ann Ellen Lee 31 OCT 1846 d. 1931 (confirmed child)\n\nJames Washington Lee b. 1850\n\nHowever, on the 1840 Census, Jonathan's probable wife is 40-49, which is probably Sarah Brickey Lee. So it looks like Jonathan and Delilah married between 1840 and 1846. This would agree with an old Family Group I have which claims George Lee, b. 1834 as a son of Jonathan and Sarah.\n\nDid Sarah die between 1840 and 1846? We have no Find A Grave memorial for her. I have an old Family Group Record that has Sarah's death at 1863/1851 Marmet, West Virginia. (Kanawha County.) Could it be that there was a divorce and she remarried?\n\nJonathan Right Lee's sister, Mary (Polly) Lee married 01 SEP 1823 to Jacob Dooley. Jacob Dooley and Delilah Dooley are most likely brother and sister. Jacob Dooley and Mary'/Polly Lee were married 01 SEP 1823 in Botetourt County Virginia and lived in Scott Co. VA in 1850 and 1860. Mary/Polly (also called Dolly and Jane) died 01 SEP 1868. Jacob died 06 OCT 1868. Jacob and Mary/Polly named a daughter Delilah. Interesting that they were living next door to Peter and Malinda Brickey in 1850. Peter Brickey b. ca. 1809 Virginia. I was unable to find a connection to Sarah Brickey, but Peter's father William C. Brickey (1779-1865) was born in Botetourt County, Virginia.\n\ntodo find above FamilySearch.org record"
