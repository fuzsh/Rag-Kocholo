Beauchesne enrolled at ESM in 1990 as an undergraduate trombone major. In his senior year, Director Robert Freeman appointed Beauchesne to the Eastman Commission on the Teaching of Music. His work earned him an invite to work with Doug Dempster to create ALP. He served as ALP’s Associate Director from 1996 to 2001.\n\nAn innovative leader, Beauchesne joined RIPO&MS in 2006 and has helped transform it into a field-leading dual mission organization that demonstrates artistic and educational excellence while promoting community service and positive change in and through music. RIPO&MS is the largest combined professional orchestra and community music school in the United States. Deeply committed to community, collaboration, sustainability and equity, Beauchesne helped create a coalition to pass two Rhode Island cultural bonds resulting in $40 million in direct grants to RI’s cultural institutions, and worked with US Senator Jack Reed and others to author relief legislation that made over $265 million in Shuttered Venues Grants available to orchestras nationwide. RIPO&MS utilized streaming technology to maintain and expand access to music instruction and live orchestral performance for its community during the pandemic. The school closed for only two weeks in 2020, and RIPO was one of the first professional orchestras in the nation to resume performing for live and remote audiences. Under Beauchesne’s leadership, RIPO&MS has increased diversity on its staff, on its stages and in its classrooms, has expanded access to music education in RI and launched partnerships with the Papitto Opportunity Connection, Boston University and Brown University to create models for lasting change. He is fortunate to learn from and collaborate with colleagues, patrons and community partners at RIPO&MS and beyond in service of transforming lives and communities through music.\n\nKristian Bezuidenhout ’01E, ’04E (MM)\n\nKristian Bezuidenhout is one of today’s most notable and exciting keyboard artists, equally at home on the fortepiano, harpsichord, and modern piano.

He earned a Bachelor of Music degree with highest honors from Harvard University and a diploma in piano performance from the Longy School of Music. In 1957-58 he held one of Harvard’s Sheldon Travelling Fellowships. At Princeton University, he was awarded an MFA and a PhD in musicology. A Fulbright Scholarship enabled him to pursue further studies in Vienna in 1960-1962. He was awarded a Martha Baird Rockefeller Foundation Award in 1962. In 1963 Freeman joined the Princeton music faculty, leaving in 1968 to join the music faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nIn 1972 he was named director of the Eastman School of Music, a position he held until 1996. He had a longtime connection to the school and to Rochester: his parents were Eastman graduates, and his paternal grandfather had been the first trumpet teacher at the school. Freeman’s father was a double bass player, and ultimately principal bass, in the Boston Symphony Orchestra.\n\nRobert Freeman’s 24 years at Eastman were a time of great growth for the school. As director, Freeman oversaw a major expansion in the campus, including a new Student Living Center and a new building for the Sibley Music Library. He appointed many distinguished artists and scholars to the Eastman faculty, while pointing the school’s curriculum towards the realities of the musical world. He helped to increase national and international exposure for such Eastman performing groups as the Eastman Wind Ensemble, Jazz Ensemble, and Philharmonia. An enthusiastic and opinionated Rochesterian, he was a leader of the development of the downtown Cultural District, and an articulate spokesperson on the subject of Eastman’s responsibility to the Rochester community.\n\nOne of Freeman’s most successful and enduring initiatives involved commissioning faculty member Joseph Schwantner, a Pulitzer Prize winner, to compose a new work for the Eastman Philharmonia that would include a narrator role intended for Willie Stargell, the beloved and iconic first baseman of the Pittsburgh Pirates. New Morning for the World incorporated text from the writings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., drawing attention to one of the most critical social issues of the time, the civil rights movement. The work’s premiere at the Kennedy Center in 1983 and its subsequent performances and recordings were tremendous musical experiences for our students and brought wide acclaim and visibility to the Eastman School of Music.\n\nFrom 1996 through 1999, Freeman served as president of the New England Conservatory, then as dean of the College of Fine Arts at The University of Texas at Austin till 2006. He is now the Susan Menefee Ragan Regents Professor of Fine Arts at the UTA, where he teaches courses in musicology.\n\nA Steinway artist, Freeman has performed in concerts and recitals throughout North America and Europe, and has made several recordings, mainly with colleagues from Eastman and the University of Texas. As a musicologist, his publications have focused on 18th-century music history and on the history and future of musical education.
