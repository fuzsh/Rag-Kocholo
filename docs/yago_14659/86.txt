The daughter of Hongkong singer Sandy Lam and Taiwanese musician-producer Jonathan Lee — the couple divorced in 2004 after six years of marriage — has become the talk of the town.

The reason? Her curvy figure.

Yesterday (Aug 28), the 21-year-old Renee, who's studying in the States, had Instagrammed this pic along with this caption: “Your friendly neighbourhood Asians”.

Not friendly though were netizens who compared the shapely Renee to her very petite and slender 53-year-old mum Sandy.

“America’s full of junk food, no wonder she's this size,” commented one nasty netizen after the Chinese media reported on her new photo. “She doesn’t look like her mum at all,” criticised another.

But there were those who came to Renee's defense, commending her for her confidence.

“She’s beautiful. Self-confidence is the most beautiful. Where can I buy your confidence?” said a fan.

Netizens have also started comparing Renee to another fuller-figured second generation star: Joyce Cheng, daughter of the late Lydia Sum. In recent years, Joyce has become a body positive style icon for millennials, and in April had told 8days.sg in an interview: I don’t think someone’s appearance should define who they are. It’s about what you have on the inside.

You say it right, gurl.
