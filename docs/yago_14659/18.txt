28 Apr - Rumours are rife that singer Sandy Lam has rejected her boyfriend Jun Kung's proposal of marriage.

As reported on Liberty Times, previously, it was rumoured that Sandy will be announcing her plans to tie the knot with her singer boyfriend after she completed her participation in the reality show, "Singer 2017".

However, the 51-year-old reportedly turned down Jun Kung's proposal for the umpteenth time recently.

Sources claimed that the reason for her to stay away from a second marriage was because of her daughter Renee, since it would affect the 18-year-old. Renee is Sandy's daughter from her first marriage with record producer, Jonathan Lee, whom she was divorced from in 2004.

However, when asked about the rumours recently, Sandy's camp denied that there is any proposal at all, while Jun previously shared that they never had any plans to tie the knot.
