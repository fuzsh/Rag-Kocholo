Why is the Census important?

The Census gives the most accurate estimate of all the people and households in England and Wales. The information you give helps decide how services are planned and funded in your local area, such as doctors' surgeries, housing, or new bus routes. It asks questions about you and your household to build a picture of all of us. There's no other survey that gives as much information about our society and future needs. Charities also use census information to help get the funding they need. Businesses use it to decide where to set up, which creates job opportunities.

It is a legal obligation to complete the Census. If you don't, you could face prosecution, a fine of up to £1000 and a criminal record.
