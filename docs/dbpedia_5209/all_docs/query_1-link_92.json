        "text": "View the religion interactive data report.\n\nChristianity\n\nIn 2021, less than half of the population described themselves as “Christian” in Portsmouth (39.4%, a 12.8% decrease from 52.2% in 2011).\n\n“Christian” was the most common response to the religion question in 2011, but was the second most common response in 2021.\n\nNo religion\n\n“No religion” was the most common response in Portsmouth in 2021, increasing to 47.1% in 2021 from 35.0% in 2011.\n\nOther religions\n\nThere were increases in the number of people in Portsmouth who described themselves as:\n\n“Muslim” (10,174 residents; 4.9% in 2021; up from 7,162 residents; 3.5% in 2011);\n\n“Hindu” (1,596 residents; 0.8% in 2021; up from 1,282 residents; 0.6% in 2011);\n\nand “Other religion” (1,259 residents; 0.6% in 2021; up from 1,050 residents; 0.5% in 2011).\n\nThe percentage who described themselves as “Jewish” and “Sikh” remained similar from 2011 to 2021 (0.1% and 0.2% respectively). The number of people who described themselves as “Buddhist” decreased (1,077 residents; 0.5% in 2021, down from 1,162 residents; 0.6% in 2011).\n\n6.4% of Portsmouth’s population did not answer the religion question in 2021, which is similar to the England average (6.0%). The percentage not answering the question in Portsmouth in 2021 was lower than in 2011 (7.3% in 2011).\n\nPopulation projections are based on the 2018 subnational population projections, which may be an overestimate as the population of Portsmouth was lower in the 2021 Census.\n\nChildren and young persons\n\nBetween 2021 and 2043 the population aged 0-4 years is likely to remain relatively stable with an increase of 9%, which is roughly 1,000 infants.\n\nThe 5-11 years age group is projected to reduce by 2030, roughly by 2,100 fewer children compared to 2021, before increasing again by 2043 with an additional 600 children compared to 2030. The 12-17 years age group is predicted to remain relatively stable with a decrease of 8% by 2043, which is around 1,100 children.\n\nThe 18-24 years age group is expected to increase by 16% by 2030, which is around 5,100 more young persons compared to 2021, before going down again by 2043 which is almost 3,100 fewer compared to 2030.\n\nWorking age population\n\nBetween 2021 and 2030, the Portsmouth working age adult population aged 18-64 years is expected to go up by 1%, which is nearly 1,300 people; this increase is due to the younger age group, as there is an estimated decrease of 14% in the 50–59-year-old age group. By 2043, the working age adult population is expected to reduce back to a similar number seen in 2021.\n\nPopulation aged 65 and over\n\nBetween 2021 and 2030, the population of Portsmouth aged 65+ years is expected to increase by 19% (projected population of 37,200 in 2030) and those aged 80+ years by 28% (projected population of 11,000 in 2030). In 2043, 19% (around 42,100 people) of Portsmouth’s population are expected to be aged 65 years and over, compared to 14% (around 32,000 people aged 65 and over) of Portsmouth’s population in 2020."
