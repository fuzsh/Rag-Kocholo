The information you give helps decide how services are planned and funded in your local area, such as doctors' surgeries, housing, or new bus routes. It asks questions about you and your household to build a picture of all of us. There's no other survey that gives as much information about our society and future needs. Charities also use census information to help get the funding they need. Businesses use it to decide where to set up, which creates job opportunities.\n\nFor more information or questions about the Census, visit Census.\n\nIt is a legal obligation to complete the Census. If you don't, you could face prosecution, a fine of up to £1000 and a criminal record.\n\n2011 Census results\n\nThe 2011 Census took place on 27 March 2011.
