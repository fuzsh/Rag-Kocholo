        "text": "Wherever possible, the Rural Urban Classification is used to distinguish rural and urban areas. The Classification defines areas as rural if they fall outside of settlements with more than 10,000 resident population. For the smallest geography areas, the classification assigns them to one of four urban or six rural categories:\n\nRural: Hamlets and Isolated Dwellings\n\nRural: Hamlets and Isolated Dwellings in a sparse setting\n\nRural: Village\n\nRural: Village in a sparse setting\n\nRural: Town and Fringe\n\nRural: Town and Fringe in a sparse setting\n\nUrban: City and Town\n\nUrban: City and Town in a sparse setting\n\nUrban: Minor Conurbation\n\nUrban: Major Conurbation\n\nThose described as “in a sparse setting” reflect where the wider area is remotely populated.\n\nWhen data are not available at a small enough geographical scale, it may be possible to apply the Rural Urban Local Authority Classification. This classification categorises districts and unitary authorities on a six point scale, based on the share of the resident population that resides in rural areas. The six categories are:\n\nMainly Rural (80% or more of the population resides in rural areas)\n\nLargely Rural (Between 50% and 79% of the population resides in rural areas)\n\nUrban with Significant Rural (Between 26% and 49% of the population resides in rural areas)\n\nUrban City and Town\n\nUrban with Minor Conurbation\n\nUrban with Major Conurbation\n\nLookup tables have been produced to ease the use of the 2011 Rural Urban Classification for all geographies in further analyses. Each lookup table consists of a spreadsheet with the full list of areas for each geography and both of the accompanying detailed and simple 2011 Rural Urban Classification.\n\nRural urban analysis of the 2011 Census is available for a wide range of Census data via the Office for National Statistics. A guide on how to access the data is provided with the Practical guides for using the 2011 Rural Urban Classification."
