        "text": "For the first time in 2008 the Annual School Census (ASC) required all schools to provide pupil information on the language spoken at home. Our analysis focuses on children attending state schools in London. Over 300 languages are spoken by London pupils, around 60% of London pupils are English speakers however, there are over 40 languages spoken by more than 1,000 pupils. Bengali, Urdu and Somali are the top three languages spoken in London, other than English. We show that English has a `doughnut&#x27; shaped geographical distribution in London, being the predominant language in most of Outer London. Languages other than English are more common in Inner London. Most minority languages, such as Bengali, Urdu and Turkish, have one, two or three main clusters, reflected settled immigrant communities. However others, notably Somali, are widely dispersed. This has implications for service provision. Some of the ethnic categories that are widely used in analysis of Census data hide subs...\n\nRecording the home languages of schoolchildren has long been acknowledged as a useful way of mapping community multilingualism. However, the need to process large quantities of data on many different languages has meant that in order to assess the vitality of community languages, researchers have had to rely on schoolchildren’s self-reported language preference and proficiency. Moreover, large scale data collection among minors poses ethical and data protection issues. We describe a pilot study carried out in Manchester, England, in which a method was tested to record home language proficiency based on rapid, anonymous speech acts. These were correlated with respondents’ self-reported exposure to their home languages. The results indicate that different factors can play a role in language maintenance in different communities, and that home language maintenance does not have an adverse effect on proficiency in the majority language.\n\nAs recent reports have confirmed, the UK is becoming more and more linguistically diverse, especially in urban areas. This article explores ways in which educational policy might respond to these changes. It begins by reporting on a small-scale research project designed to find out from a number of community language teachers in Nottingham what they consider to be the linguistic needs of their children and how these might be fulfilled in both mainstream and supplementary schools. Having identified these needs, the article then turns to a description of the Sheffield Multilingual City Project. An analysis of this project serves to identify some useful principles for the development of a coherent policy which would include the voices of the various community language speakers. The article concludes by arguing that there is a need for a national policy framework designed to promote appropriate language policies in all areas, and that this should ensure that the linguistic needs of all of ou(children are met, regardless of where they live."
