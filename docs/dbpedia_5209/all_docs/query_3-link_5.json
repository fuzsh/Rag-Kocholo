classifications.\n\nBackground\n\nRead about how we developed and tested the questions for Census 2021.\n\nComparability with the 2011 Census\n\nBroadly comparable\n\nThe question about the ethnic group people feel they belong to is self-identified and is subjectively meaningful to the person answering the question. This means that how a person chooses to identify can change over time.\n\nWe have included a new Roma category next to the Gypsy or Irish Traveller tick-box within the White category. We have also added a write-in option for those selecting African within the Black, Caribbean or Black British category. This means that a more specific ethnic background could be recorded.\n\nWhat does broadly comparable mean?\n\nA variable that is broadly comparable means that it can be generally compared with the same variable used in the 2011 Census. However, changes may have been made to the question or options that people could choose from or how write-in answers are classified.\n\nEngland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland comparisons\n\nNot comparable\n\nThis variable is not comparable as the data is not available for all countries.\n\nWhat does not comparable mean?\n\nA variable that is not comparable means that it cannot be compared for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nFind out more about variables produced for Census 2021 in Northern Ireland and Census 2022 in Scotland.\n\nCensus 2021 data that uses this variable\n\nWe use variables from Census 2021 data to show findings in different ways.\n\nYou can:"
