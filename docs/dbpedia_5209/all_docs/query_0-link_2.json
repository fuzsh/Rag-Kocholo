        "text": "Contemporary missions has come under significant threat owing to a great decline in missionaries. Indeed, Mark Greene laments that “globally, 98% of Christians are neither envisioned nor equipped for mission in 95% of their waking lives” (2010:4). This implies that despite the mandate for the whole church to disciple the whole world, only two percent of Christians are adequately prepared to effectively engage Unreached People Groups (UPGs). A key reason for this could be the sacred-secular divide, leading to the assumption that a missiological education may be only for conventional missionaries and other clergies. In Africa, missiological education (ME), which is “most important” for the future of Christianity, is challenged. This has resulted in inadequate training for probably up to 80% of African pastors (World Council of Churches, 2013:8. Mugambi, 2013:108. Houston, 2009; as cited by Wahl, 2011:269). Additionally, since Jesus was holistic in His earthly ministry (meeting spiritual, economic and other needs), the conventional missiological training (addressing spiritual needs only) is inadequate. Therefore, the Xhosa people of East London, South Africa, need a comprehensive model of discipleship that incorporates missiological, moral, as well as business training. The 2012 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Africa Report highlights the critical need of addressing the continent’s business skills gap, a situation leading to extreme poverty; low innovation and business efficiency; as well as an inability to compete in a hyper-competitive global market. In other words, Africa is existing far below her economic and mission potential. An important solution to this crisis could be the implementation of the Missiological Discipleship Training Center (MDTC) model, which includes Business is Mission (BiM) teaching among other key doctrines of the faith. MDTC should decisively address Africa’s discipleship, mission, low business skills, and poverty challenges. This holistic model could be critical for effective engagement of the Xhosa ethnic groups in East London, South Africa. The multiplier effect of discipleship, morality, and economic empowerment could also heal family, government, education, and other social institutions."
