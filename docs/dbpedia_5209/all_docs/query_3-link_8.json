        "text": "Census 2021 figures show Tower Hamlets as among the top ten local authorities for people aged over 16 identifying as LGB+, at 7.2pc.\n\nThe census classified those who did not identify as heterosexual as LGB+, including lesbians, gays, bisexuals, as well as pansexuals, asexuals and people who identify as queer.\n\nWaltham Forest came in at 4.5pc, Newham at 4pc and Barking and Dagenham at 2.3pc, with Redbridge at 2.2pc and Havering at 2pc.\n\nThe data also shows Newham is the highest local authority for those whose gender identity differs from their sex at birth.\n\nIn Newham, 1.51 per cent of people aged 16 and over said their gender identity was different from their sex at birth.\n\nThis includes those who identify as trans women, trans men, non-binary, or another gender identity.\n\nBarking and Dagenham and Waltham Forest also ranked in the top ten at 1.17pc and 1.08pc respectively.\n\nIt is the first time figures on sexual orientation and gender identity have been included, with people aged 16 and over asked to provide this information on a voluntary basis.\n\nStonewall chief executive Nancy Kelley said: \"For the past two centuries of data gathering through our national census, LGBTQ+ people have been invisible, with the stories of our communities, our diversity and our lives missing from the national record.\"\n\nThe LGBT Foundation said it \"cautiously welcomes\" the data, saying it is a \"huge first step in making LGBTQ+ people feel included\" but \"remains incomplete\".\n\nThe charity said: \"Unfortunately, there are a range of reasons why people wonâ€™t feel able to disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n\"The historic and ongoing attitudes towards LGBTQ+ communities, particularly trans and non-binary people, will stop many from feeling safe to provide this information.\n\n\"Meanwhile, many LGBTQ+ people are living within households and environments where they are unable to be open about their gender identity, sexual orientation and trans identity.\n\n\"As such it will be years before we get an accurate picture, informed by figures from, and comparison with, future surveys.\"\n\nOffice for National Statistics (ONS) director Jen Woolford said the first census estimates were \"crucial\", adding: \"They will ensure decision-makers have the best information so they can better understand the extent and nature of disadvantage which people may be experiencing in terms of educational outcomes, health, employment and housing.\""
