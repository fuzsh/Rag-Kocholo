That the operation will be A strong but moderately and yet a quite persistently profitable to the participants therein seems likely from declining stock market has been the condition for the fact that the transcontinental transfer of the metal some days. The money market not only as at present from San Francisco will, as is customary, be effected ruling, but its future prospects, has controlled the situa- through Treasury order, thus saving not only the extion, forcing conservative as well as weak holders to pense of transportation but the time-cost, or interest, THE FINANCIAL SITUATION. and of very favorable outturn of the crops. An announcement by the Secretary of the Treasury that on October 2 he would resume refunding operations, issuing 2 per cent consols of 1930 at 101 in exchange for 4 per cents of 1907 and 3 per cents of 1908-18 was looked upon in some quarters as a harbinger of easier money. This forecast is based upon the expectation that an increase of the 2 per cents afloat would mean an increase of claimed would national bank notes, which was excellent trade prospects sell in spite of while the gold theoretically in transit across the con- is tinent. We have further action this week showing the increasing repugnance felt in Europe to the loss of gold. This is a natural development of the present state of the Bank of England reserve and of the special effort being put forth to resist the outflow of that metal from London. It should be remembered that so far as the gold current to America is purely in response to a confident of such favorable trade situation, it cannot be effectually relieve stringency. We cannot feel a result from the cause specified. An enlargement of that is permanently resisted. The experience had national bank notes must act very much as would an in 1903 most clearly illustrates the soundness of that enlargement of the greenback notes National bank cur- statement, as we have shown in this article in previous rency is semi-legal tender, and their increasing issue is weeks. On this ocasion among the earlier evidences — . a species of inflation. affairs we think it In the present condition of of opposition to the gold outflow at London was the likely to disturb hardening and then the movement upward of the would be more stock values than relieve the money market. The engagements of gold in London for shipment to New York which were announced this week, and indeed those which immediately preceded them on the 18th, attracted attention because more likely to relieve the monetary crisis here. There has, however, been a feature connected with those transactions which does not encourage belief in a large increase in the moveunless there is a change in conditions. The truth ment is, at the current rate for exchange at London it was difficult, if New York on not impossible, to figure a on the transactions as direct exchange operations. The conclusion, therefore, seemed to be irresistible that they were special transactions which were profit made possible by the pants therein. If it and American Eagles from 77s. 9d. for bars to 77s. 9^d. and from that to 77s. 9^§d. and again to 77s. 9%d.; concurrently the open market rate at London had grown more active, then rose, followed by an advance in the Bank rate to 3 per cent, and thereupon by a general rise in money at London, Berlin and Paris all and each of which increased the cost of shipments to New York and consequently tended to hold back the outflow of Europe's supply of gold.

It affords Japan an assurance that she cannot be crowded by Russia through any one-sided interpretation of between Russia and Japan, the peace contract which we asserted a month would happen. It will be we were discussing at that time afraid much remembered that when ago we in this were column (Sept. 2 1905, pages 74S-749) the yielding of the Japanese envoys to every point Russia had objected to, we stated that the terms thus agreed to, as to afford treaty with Great Britain be a better defense than the Treaty of Peace.\" We are now not at all surprised that Japan yielded to Russia. She only wanted peace that could not be broken by her old enemy. Her act was con- sequently a wise one; she accepted Russia's terms solely and under a consciousness assured her of absolute immunity by the terms of this treaty with Great Britain.

This action is equivalent to approval of increase in fares, because in many cases where a passenger now reaches destination through the transfer privilege on a single fare he will hereafter have to pay a double fare. The fact of the matter is, however, that the single fare was unprofitable to the t railway. And this being so, the logic of the situation we understood them, obviously demanded that Japan that safety from constant annoyance and sinister courses by Russia which Japan sought to obtain by the war.\" In closing, we at that time likewise said, what seems now in a kind of prophetic way. that peace has come \"in a form that leaves almost a certainty that the same issue must be fought out again in another campaign, unless, forsooth, the \"failed 1009 in it these not contrary to the principle of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all nations.

In the long run, the railroads, whether electric or steam, will have to be allowed to earn a fair return on the capital invested; otherwise only one result can follow, namely that capital will refuse to go any longer into that class of enterprises and that class of investments. The final outcome would be that no further railroad facilities would be furnished. There can be no doubt that the matter of granting free transfer privileges has been carried beyond reasonable lengths, not alone in Massachusetts, but elsewhere in the United States. As the Massachusetts Commission well says, in its opinion with regard to the Boston & Northern, the original purpose of these a profit to those capital for carrying transfers — to it on. place travel upon the same footing as by way of connecting lines travel over direct lines —has sometimes dropped cmt of sight, and transfers have been issued simply to extend the distance of travel for a five-cent fare.

PROSPERITY AND SPECULATION. The present financial situation and outlook in this [Vol. lxxxi money this week, to a rate not reached except in a temporary pinch for two years past, we hardly need to speak. The broad inference to be drawn from these phenomena, home and foreign, is that demands on the world's capital, which a year ago were far below available supplies, are now pressing so closely as narrow margin. Ordinarily such a situation would mean nothiDg except that a somewhat troublesome bridge must be crossed before the real situation finds its normal reflection on the Stock Exchange. When the crops have been moved, one hears, money will ease again and will be readily obtainable. This is the view rather generally held to-day in Wall Street. It is the more pronounced because the spirit of speculation is, at the moment, permeating the whole American community in a degree, we suppose, that has not been witnessed since the early days of 1901. By this we do not mean that the host of petty speculators of all sorts and conditions who besieged Wall Street at that to leave a fairly country are in several ways remarkable.
