        "text": "4.1 Where to access the censuses\n\nThe censuses from 1841 to 1921 are available online. Links to our official partner websites, Ancestry and Findmypast, for each census (£) are listed in the table below. Images and indexes for all censuses from 1841 to 1911 are available on both of these sites, and on a number of other commercial websites (£).\n\nIt is free to search on these sites, but there is a charge to view full search results and digitised images. However, you can view censuses from 1841 to 1921 free of charge on site at The National Archives in Kew, and from 1841 to 1911 at many libraries and record offices and at FamilySearch Centres worldwide. The 1921 Census is also free to view via Findmypast at the Manchester Central Library, on St Peter’s Square, Manchester, supported by the Manchester and Lancashire Family History Society helpdesk and the Archives+ Team, and at the National Library of Wales, in Aberystwyth.\n\nMany local and county record offices also hold microfilm or microfiche copies of the census returns for their own area, excluding 1911 and 1921. Use Find an archive to find contact details for local and county record offices.\n\nRead section 12 for information on the census returns for Scotland and Ireland.\n\nCensus year Online version of censuses for… Provided by 1921 England, Wales, Channel Islands and Isle of Man Findmypast.co.uk 1911 England, Wales, Channel Islands and Isle of Man Findmypast.co.uk 1901 England, Wales, Channel Islands and Isle of Man Findmypast.co.uk 1891 England, Wales, Channel Islands, Isle of Man Ancestry.co.uk 1881 England, Wales, Channel Islands, Isle of Man Ancestry.co.uk 1871 England, Wales, Channel Islands, Isle of Man Ancestry.co.uk 1861 England, Wales, Channel Islands, Isle of Man Ancestry.co.uk 1851 England, Wales, Channel Islands, Isle of Man Ancestry.co.uk 1841 England, Wales, Channel Islands, Isle of Man Ancestry.co.uk\n\nThere are free indexes to all of the census returns up to 1911 at FamilySearch.org, with links to the images on Findmypast (£). You can also search census returns for England and Wales on Findmypast (£).\n\nSome transcripts of census records covering England, Wales and Scotland are available free of charge on FreeCEN.org.uk. Statistics on coverage are listed, by county, on their website.\n\n4.2 How to search the censuses\n\nYou can search by name, browse by place, or locate an exact page if you have the full census reference. Read section 11 for information on using census references. Depending on the census year, and the site, other search options may be available.\n\nStreet indexes were created for districts containing towns with a population of around 40,000 or more, from 1841 to 1901. Online versions for the street indexes for 1841, 1851, 1861, 1871 and 1891 are preserved in the UK Government Web Archive. Please note that the limitations of the software that captures website content means that some links within archived web pages do not work. Printed copies of the 1841, 1881 and 1901 street indexes are available in the reading rooms at The National Archives. For 1871 census registration district maps see Cassinimaps.co.uk (£).\n\n4.3 Post-1911 censuses\n\nUnlike earlier censuses, the 1921 census (and later censuses) are subject to the Census Act 1920, as amended by the Census (Confidentiality) Act 1991 c.6 which makes it an offence to disclose personal information held in them until 100 years after the date they were conducted. Until then, they are held by the Office for National Statistics. Statistical information from these censuses is openly available.\n\nUnfortunately, the 1931 census for England and Wales was destroyed by fire in 1942, and no census was taken in 1941 because of the Second World War.\n\n5. People in the census\n\nThe following information on individuals enumerated within households is included in each census year as follows (slightly different questions were asked on schedules for institutions and vessels, depending on the location and census year):\n\n1841\n\nfirst name and surname\n\nage (rounded down to the nearest five years for those aged 15 or over)\n\nsex\n\noccupation\n\nwhether they were born in the county where they were enumerated (Y or N)\n\nwhether they were born in Scotland (S), Ireland (I) or Foreign Parts (P)\n\n1851 and 1861\n\nfirst name, middle names (often just initials) and surname\n\nrelationship to the head of the household\n\nmarital status\n\nage (at last birthday)\n\nsex\n\nrank, profession or occupation\n\nwhere born – county and parish if born in England or Wales, country only if born outside England and Wales)\n\nwhether blind, or deaf and dumb\n\n1871 and 1881\n\nAs 1851 and 1861, except for the following difference:\n\nthe last column now reads: 1. Blind 2. Deaf and Dumb 3. Imbecile or Idiot 4. Lunatic\n\n1891\n\nAs 1871 and 1881 with the following extra details on employment:\n\nwhether Employer, Employed, or Neither Employer nor Employed\n\nlanguage spoken (Wales only)\n\n1901\n\nAs 1891, with occupation details changed to:\n\n‘Employer, Worker or Own account’\n\na new column ‘If working at home’\n\nlanguage spoken (Isle of Man only)\n\n1911\n\nAs 1901, with extra questions:\n\nFor married women only, the number of years of their present marriage, the number of children born of that marriage, the number still living, and the number that had died.\n\nAs well as their occupation, the industry in which the person was employed. If employed by a government, municipal or other public body, the name of that body.\n\nParish and county of birth for anyone born in the UK (which included all of Ireland). If born elsewhere in the British Empire, the colony or dependency, and the state or province.\n\nFor anyone born outside England and Wales, whether they were resident or visitor in the country.\n\nNationality of anyone born overseas whether British by parentage, British by naturalisation (including year of naturalisation) or, if a foreign national, of which country.\n\nIn the Infirmity column, the age at which the person had become afflicted.\n\nIn 1911 all the household schedules were kept, for the first time (see RG 14), and were not copied into enumeration books. There are instead enumerators’ summary books which list every address, including unoccupied buildings, and the only names they contain are those of the head of each household (see RG 78). These summary books are the only place you will find a description of each building such as ‘House and shop’, ‘Hotel’, ‘Private house’. Unoccupied houses and non-residential properties such as churches and factories are also listed.\n\n1921\n\nThis was the first census where old questions were dropped, as well as new ones being added. The questions about the length of present marriage, and the number of children born within it, were no longer included. For the first time since 1841, there was no longer a question on infirmity or disability.\n\nThere were also changes to some existing questions:\n\nAge was asked for in years and months, not just in years\n\n‘Divorced’ was added as an option for marital status\n\nName and business of each person’s employer (in 1911 this was only required from those in public service), and the address of their place of work. ‘No fixed place’ was added as an option, in addition to ‘Home’\n\nFor persons born outside the United Kingdom, country and state or province of birth; state or province was previously asked only of those born in the British Empire. Naturalised British subjects were no longer asked for their year of naturalisation\n\nNew questions were added:\n\nFor children under 15, whether both parents were alive, father dead, mother dead, or both dead\n\nWhether in full-time or part-time education\n\nMarried men, widows and widowers were asked for the number and ages of their living children and step-children under 16\n\nIn 1921 there are household schedules, as in 1911, but there are no enumerators’ summary books as there are for 1911. Instead, there are ‘Plans of Division’ which describe the boundaries and contents of each enumeration district.\n\n6. Places in the census\n\nThe first page of each enumeration book contains a description of the area covered. In the earlier years the amount of detail varies; they could contain a list of streets, and describe the route taken by the enumerator, but in rural areas the description might simply read ‘The whole of the parish of …’. From 1891 onwards there are separate sections for a description of the boundaries of the ED, and for a list of the streets or dwellings included.\n\nIn 1911 these details are in the Enumerators’ Summary Books, and in 1921 they are in the Plans of Division.\n\n7. Addresses, houses and other buildings in the census\n\nExact addresses were not required in 1841, only ‘place’. From 1851 an exact address was required, including the house name or number, if any. However, in rural areas the only information given still might be the name of the village or parish. Numbers in the left-hand column are schedule numbers, and should not be mistaken for house numbers.\n\nA note was made of buildings that were uninhabited, or under construction, in every census year. In 1891 and 1901 the number of rooms in a dwelling was listed, if fewer than five. In 1911 and 1921 the number of rooms is shown on all household schedules, and other information is in the Enumerators’ Summary Books, described in section 5, above, for 1911 only.\n\nFrom 1851 to 1901 a census entry for a new household is indicated by a new schedule number. In all census years except 1851, 1911 and 1921 the last entry in a building is indicated by a double oblique line //, and where there is more than one household within a building, they are separated by a single oblique line /. In 1851 a line is ruled across the page at the end of a building, or half-way across the page between households within a building.\n\n8. Ships and institutions in the census\n\nSpecial enumeration books were completed for institutions such as workhouses, barracks and hospitals in every census year from 1851, including 1911. Special schedules for vessels were introduced in 1851, although none are known to survive from that year, so in practice 1861 was the first year to include returns from the Royal Navy and merchant shipping, at sea and in ports at home and abroad. Due to the difficulties of collecting enumeration books from ships in distant ports, shipping returns are likely to be incomplete.\n\nIn 1861 all returns from the Royal Navy and from merchant vessels are at the end of the series, but after that vessels in home ports are listed at the end of the districts where they were moored, and only those in foreign waters are grouped together at the end of the series.\n\nThere are no surviving records for Royal Navy ships in foreign waters in 1891. It is not known what happened to these records.\n\nIn 1901 Royal Navy ships in foreign waters are listed alphabetically, and there are no returns for ships between HMS Amphion and HMS High Flyer. However, a duplicate copy of the enumeration of HMS Cygnet in 1901 was sent to the General Register Office by the Admiralty and is included in RG 19/20.\n\n1911 was the first census where the British Army overseas was enumerated; previously there was only a headcount. This also applies in 1921, with the addition of Royal Air Force bases overseas.\n\n9. Common census terms and abbreviations\n\nIn addition to the terms and abbreviations described below, section 5 and section 7 of this guide describe other conventions used in the censuses.\n\nRelationships (from 1851)\n\nIn practice, the head of the household was often the oldest male, but not necessarily. Everyone else, whether wife, son, servant or anyone else, should have been described in relation to this person, but this was not always followed accurately. In three-generation families young children may be shown as ‘son’ or ‘daur’ (daughter) when they are really the grandchildren of the head. ‘Son (or daughter)-in-law’ can mean a stepchild, as well as the husband or wife of the head’s own children. A boarder is someone who resides within the household but is not a relative or servant, while a lodger only rents a room or rooms, but these terms are often used interchangeably.\n\nRelationships are not recorded in most schedules for vessels or institutions. Instead, there may be a question on each person’s rank or position within the vessel or institutions. However, the exact details vary depending on the type of schedule, the year, and the location.\n\nCondition (as to marriage)\n\nMar or M – married\n\nUnm, Un or U – unmarried (replaced by S for single from 1891)\n\nWid or W – widowed\n\nD – divorced (1921 only)\n\n‘Divorced’ was not an official category until 1921, and does not feature in the statistical tables, but does appear occasionally in this column in some earlier census years.\n\nRank, profession or occupation\n\nThere were specific instructions on recording extra details for several occupations; notably the professions, the armed forces, public servants and anyone involved in agriculture or manufacturing. Sometimes the clerks in the Census Office altered or expanded these definitions to assign them to one of the categories in the Registrar General’s classification of occupations for that census year.\n\nThese are some of the most common terms and abbreviations found in the ‘Rank profession or occupation’ column:\n\nAg lab – agricultural labourer\n\nAnnuitant – living on income from investments\n\nAp or App – apprentice\n\nFS, MS – used in the 1841 census for ‘female servant’ and ‘male servant’\n\nFWK – also in 1841, for ‘framework knitter’ a common occupation in the East Midlands\n\nGentleman – Usually denotes someone living on an income from investments, or retired from business, but has no official definition\n\nInd or Independent – ‘Of independent means’\n\nJ – journeyman; someone who had completed an apprenticeship but was not a master with a business and apprentices of their own\n\nPensioner – usually means an army pensioner; other types of pensioner are generally identified as such, including Greenwich Pensioner (naval pensioner), police pensioner and so on. Old age pensions were introduced in 1908, so the term ‘old age pensioner’ appears for the first time in 1911\n\n10. Why can’t I find my ancestor in the census?\n\nThere are many reasons that explain why you might not find somebody in the census. Read our blog post ‘Missing from the census?’ or watch our webinar, also called ‘Missing from the census?’, to discover how information can be missed or altered, as well as to learn tips for more successful searching.\n\nThere are some pages missing from all censuses, but 1861 has suffered most.\n\nMissing from 1861 census\n\nYou can use The National Archives catalogue to find out which parishes or districts are known to be missing from the 1861 census. Use the keyword ‘missing’ to search within series RG 9 in our catalogue.\n\nMissing from 1841 census: Wrexham\n\nThe 1841 census returns for the whole registration district of Wrexham, Denbighshire, were believed to be missing. However, the original enumeration books for the town of Wrexham were discovered in a bookshop, and are now deposited in the Denbighshire Archives. An indexed transcript has been published by the Clwyd Family History Society, and a copy is available at The National Archives.\n\nMissing from other censuses\n\nAs with the 1861 census, you can use our catalogue to search the record series for any other census year to find out about whole parishes or districts that are known to be missing, but compared to 1861 there is less detail about odd missing pages. Use section 11 to determine which National Archives record series to search within and search using the word ‘missing’.\n\nFor more guidance on how to search our catalogue, read Discovery search help.\n\n11. The National Archives references for censuses\n\nAlthough most people now access the census online, and not on microfilm, census references are still very useful. Search engines on websites vary, and they can also change over time, but the original National Archives references never change. If you have a full reference, you should be able to use it to find a page on Ancestry.co.uk or on Findmypast.co.uk, even if you have obtained it from a different site, or from some other source. This is particularly useful when a person can be found using a name search on one site, but not on another, due to differences in transcription.\n\nYou may find census references quoted in books and articles, and you will also need to know how to use them if you are consulting our online and hard-copy street indexes (see section 4.2).\n\nA census reference has three main elements; a department (letter) code, a series number, and a piece number. The department and series codes for each census year are:\n\n1841 and 1851: HO 107\n\n1861: RG 9\n\n1871: RG 10\n\n1881: RG 11\n\n1891: RG 12\n\n1901: RG 13\n\n1911: RG 14\n\n1921: RG 15\n\nA piece may contain hundreds of pages, so extra information is required to find the right place within a piece. The census returns for most years follow a single format, but there are slightly different arrangements for 1841, 1911 and 1921.\n\nCensus returns from 1851 to 1901\n\nThe extra reference is a folio number and (optionally) a page number."
