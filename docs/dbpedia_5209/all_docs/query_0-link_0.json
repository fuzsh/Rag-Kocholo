        "text": "Metropolitan municipality in Eastern Cape, South Africa\n\nThe Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality (Xhosa: uMasipala oMbaxa wase Buffalo City) is a metropolitan municipality situated on the east coast of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. It includes the towns of East London, Bhisho and Qonce, as well as the large townships of Mdantsane and Zwelitsha.\n\nThe municipality was established as a local municipality in 2000 after South Africa's reorganisation of municipal areas, and is named after the Buffalo River, at whose mouth lies the only river port in South Africa. On 18 May 2011, it was separated from the Amathole District Municipality and converted into a metropolitan municipality.\n\nThe area has a well-developed manufacturing base, with the auto industry playing a major role. Daimler AG through its wholly owned subsidiary Mercedes-Benz South Africa (MBSA) has a large assembly plant located next to the port of East London, which produces a variety of vehicles for export.\n\nThe climate is mild, with year-round sunshine. Average rainfall is 850mm (33.5 inches).\n\nThe population of 701,873 (2001) is largely African (85.2%), with White (8.4%) and Coloured (5.7%) minorities. There is also a small Indian community (0.6%).\n\nThe previous mayor, Dr Sindisile Maclean (ANC), was elected in 2000. Buffalo City elected its first female mayor on Friday, 17 March 2006. Ntombentle Peter was voted in as Executive Mayor at the inaugural meeting of the new council following the municipal elections.\n\nThe 2011 census divided the municipality into the following main places:\n\nNote:Only the most populated places are reported\n\nPlace Code Area (km2) Population Berlin 260060 38.22 3,048 Bhisho 260032 8.08 11,192 Bulembu 260065 1.63 1,212 Dimbaza 260039 17.28 21,783 Ducats 260102 1.24 3,546 Duncan Village 260114 0.90 16,380 East London 260113 168.86 267,007 Eluxolweni 260062 8.51 15,300 Ententeni 260139 0.84 2,731 eSingeni 260048 2.60 1,343 Ginsberg 260073 2.39 10,766 Gompo 260133 0.53 2,254 Gonubie 260106 10.11 11,471 Goodhope 260137 4.06 2,127 iKhiwane 260165 1.38 1,039 Ilitha 260061 5.64 8,145 Izeleni 260098 2.11 1,187 Jaftas 260106 0.68 442 Kayser's Beach 260178 2.36 697 Kidd's Beach 260160 2.13 499 Qonce 260044 65.52 34,019 Kuni 260136 6.14 2,179 KwaBhonke 260091 1.19 1,174 KwaLini 260074 1.13 1,696 KwaMasingata 260045 1.11 1,204 KwaMlakalaka 260108 0.96 1,279 KwaMpundu 260055 5.19 1,544 KwaNoncampa 260077 1.30 1,552 KwaQongqotha 260118 1.32 1,425 KwaRhayi 260072 0.75 1,144 KwaTshatshu 260085 6.68 4,719 Kwetyana 260054 18.42 5,863 Macleantown 260016 9.94 580 Embekweni 260083 0.53 7,123 Mdantsane 260088 45.55 156,835 Modaka 260036 0.95 1,745 Mzamonhle 260107 2.49 8,338 Nxarhuni Dam Settlement 260078 0.93 131 Ncalukeni 260056 2.13 1,892 Needs Camp 260129 7.41 6,696 Ngxwalane 260075 1.61 1,027 Nkqonkqweni A 260007 1.00 1,546 Nomgwadla 260040 3.15 2,384 Nompumelelo 260112 0.73 7,269 Nkqonkqweni 260066 3.52 1,766 Nxarhuni 260068 2.64 1,481 Pefferville 260114 0.94 16,380 Phakamisa 260103 2.32 6,602 Pirie Mission 21446 0.74 356 Potsdam East 260113 1.25 1,664 Potsdam South 260114 8.02 5,329 Potsdam Village 260103 4.14 5,649 Sandile 260161 2.78 855 Sea Vale 260103 0.17 291 Silverdale 260132 4.00 647 Sunrise-on-Sea 260092 0.68 655 Tshabo 2 260095 2.67 1,114 Tyusha 260103 2.16 1,289 Tyutyu 260043 3.58 2,676 Umzantsi 260050 0.99 1,373 Zabalaza 260037 1.72 1,188 Zwelitsha 260086 4.64 18,189 Remainder of the municipality 260010 1867.19 10,359\n\nMain article: Buffalo City elections\n\nThe municipal council consists of one hundred members elected by mixed-member proportional representation.
