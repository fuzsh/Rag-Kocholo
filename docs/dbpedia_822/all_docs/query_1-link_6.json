        "text": "We’ve been proudly making food for over 150 years. Our heritage is a testament to the iconic brands and delicious foods that our employees—past and present—created and continue to build upon today. Explore a few milestones along our journey.\n\n1914\n\nDr. John T. Dorrance, inventor of condensed soup, becomes president of the company. He leads the company until his death in 1930.\n\n1897\n\nWhen John, born on November 11, 1873, came to Joseph Campbell Preserve Co. at the age of 24 to work as a chemist, he brought with him a Bachelor of Arts from M.I.T. and a doctorate from the University of Göttingen in Germany. John used his academic background to create the process of condensing soups.\n\n1910s & 1920s\n\nThroughout the 1910s and 1920s, John Dorrance and his wife, Ethel, host annual meetings for farmers at their home on Campbell’s research farm in Cinnaminson, New Jersey. Campbell’s in-house agricultural experts would discuss new growing techniques and methods, educating farmers on crop rotation, water savings, seed selection, and how to maximize yields.\n\n1920s\n\nHarry Hall, Chief Agricultural Expert, inspecting tomatoes in his office at Campbell’s research farm in Cinnaminson, New Jersey. With the growing popularity of Campbell’s condensed soups, John recognized that a stable supply of vegetables was critical to the company’s success. John invested heavily in agricultural research by hiring Harry, who shared new techniques and methods with Campbell’s farmers to help increase their yields.\n\n1929\n\nJohn Dorrance and Chef Louis Charles DeLisle celebrating his Order of Chevalier du Merite (Knight of Merit) award in 1929. In 1902 Chef DeLisle became the first executive chef of Campbell’s. John believed that his condensed soups should be of the highest quality, so he worked closely with Chef DeLisle on refining each soup’s recipe until it met their exacting standards.\n\n1961\n\nWe acquire Pepperidge Farm, a baked goods company founded by Margaret Rudkin in Fairfield, Connecticut in 1937. Here are a few moments from Pepperidge Farm history, before Maggie joined the Campbell family.\n\n1937\n\nMargaret Rudkin, of Fairfield, Connecticut founds Pepperidge Farm to make the wholesome bread—for her son who suffers from allergies—she can’t find elsewhere on the commercial market.\n\n1980\n\nCape Cod potato chips founders started selling their homemade potato chips out of a tiny storefront in Hyannis, Massachusetts. The Cape Cod Potato Chip Hyannis Factory opened in 1985, where visitors can stop by for a self-guided tour."
