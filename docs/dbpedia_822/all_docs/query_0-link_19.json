        "text": "Barry Frank, a television sports impresario who over a half-century negotiated deals for sportscasting stars like John Madden, developed or created popular shows like “The Skins Game” and “Superstars,” and helped engineer high-priced network rights deals, died on Tuesday in a hospital in San Francisco. He was 87.\n\nHis wife, Elizabeth (Packer) Frank, said the cause was pulmonary problems after he had choked on some food.\n\nMr. Frank had once dreamed of being an actor. But he ended up working on different stages — as a network official but chiefly as an executive at the International Management Group (IMG), the sports and entertainment agency founded by Mark McCormack in the early 1960s."
