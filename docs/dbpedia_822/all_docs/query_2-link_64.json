The actress filed her suit back on February 7th of this year, against Corday Productions (the entity behind the Peacock streaming soap opera), its executive producer, Ken Corday, and former executive producer, Albert Alarr.\n\nOn the July 29th episode of the series, Zucker’s final episode streamed, which saw Nicole Walker leave Salem and head to Paris. The door was left open for a Nicole return either by potentially Zucker or another actress in the future.\n\nNow, in a Los Angeles County judge decision on Thursday, Rolling Stone shares that Zucker can now move ahead with the disputed portion of her complaint that’s seeking a formal order barring former DAYS Co-EP, Albert Alarr, from harassing behavior in any future workplace.\n\nZucker is suing Alarr for sexual harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, under a section of California’s business code. Alarr had asked the court to strike the alleged business code violation, claiming it didn’t apply to him.\n\nAlarr’s lawyer Robert Barta argued at the hearing, “There have to be allegations he is engaged in continuing behavior. He’s not even employed. There’s no allegation that he’s employed anywhere in this industry, as a result of what has transpired. It’s a matter of law. There are simply no facts alleged to support a claim for injunctive relief.”\n\nHowever, the judge felt differently and expressed, “The plaintiff has alleged a long-standing course of conduct by Mr. Alarr. An inference arises from the facts alleged that the behavior would be likely to recur,”\n\nThe judge added that although Alarr says he’s no longer working, an injunction could be appropriate if Zucker “ultimately proves that Alarr engaged in the behavior alleged, and that the behavior is likely to occur in other jobs.”\n\nZucker’s attorney told Rolling Stone, “Ms. Zucker wants to ensure that no other woman can be harmed at the hands of Alarr again, and I will fight to make that happen.” However in court filings, Alarr and his lawyers claim Zucker’s allegations “range from fictional to embellished to taken wildly out of context.”\n\nNext up, the case is next scheduled to be heard in court in October.\n\nSo, what do you think about the judge allowing Zucker’s complaint against Albert Alarr in the workplace to move forward? Comment below.\n\nDays Of Our Lives\n\nEmily O’Brien Exits Days of our Lives\n\nBy\n\nIt’s the end of the line for Theresa Donovan, for now, as she headed to Statesville on the August 8th episode of Peacock’s Days of our Lives. With Theresa spending some time in the slammer, that marks the conclusion of Emily O’ Brien’s run in the part.\n\nBack in October of 2023, O’Brien had the distinction of seeing her original DAYS character of Gwen Rizchech being written-out on the same day as she debuted as a recast Theresa complete with blonde wig. Previously, Emily had played Gwen since 2020, and Theresa had been last played by Jen Lilley.\n\nNow with both roles being given a rest, Emily is onto many new projects including voicing the one and only Wonder Woman for the upcoming video game, DC Heroes United.\n\nEmily spoke with Soap Opera Digest about her emotional final day on set (which was months ago in DAYS time). “I just told everyone how incredibly lucky I am. I wasn’t supposed to be on the show for as long as I was,” shared O’Brien. “I never thought that daytime would be something that was accessible to me again (she previously played Jana Hawkes on Y&R 2006-2011). I not only got to play one amazing role, but I played two amazing roles.”\n\nThe actress admitted she did fall in love with playing the troublemaking Theresa, which was not originally intended to be her role. Emily expressed, “I just feel so grateful for that experience. It’s been a crazy, wild ride — just mind-blowing. Every single day there is something that keeps everyone going full force to do everything they can to put out another amazing episode where people are so invested. It’s the hardest job ever, and I’m so grateful that I got to experience that with this group.”\n\nAs viewers know, Days of our Lives has a penchant for bringing back characters from the dead, or characters written off the canvas down the line for a new cycle of shows. So, you just never know if Gwen, Theresa or Emily, in yet another DAYS role, might pop again!\n\nSo, sad to see Emily written off as Theresa? Should the show cast her to play yet another character in the future?

So it’s Out There.”\n\nBy\n\nDid anyone see coming Brady falling off the wagon and then hitting the sheets with Xander’s (Paul Telfer) mother, Fiona (Serena Scott Thomas)? Neither did Brady’s Daytime Emmy-winning portrayer, Eric Martsolf.\n\nWhile Brady has certainly had some intriguing and unique liaisons in his past, including his torrid affair with Kristen DiMera (who was also his dad, John Black’s girlfriend back in the day), this time he has really taken things to another level. Now, Brady is shacking up with the mother of his newly realized uncle … Xander Cook (Kiria)\n\nSpeaking with Soap Opera Digest, Martsolf shared on being paired with Serena Scott Thomas as both drinking buddies and lovers, “If you really examine the connective tissue of this, it’s unprecedented.” Eric added, ” Xander is now my newly found uncle, so I’m sleeping with my uncle’s mother, too. So it’s out there.”\n\nAs for how far the Peacock streaming soap opera will take things between Fiona and Brady, the actor teased, “What I can say without spoiling anything is it’s not just a one-and-done thing. It actually unfolds into other events. It comes into play down the line and will lead to a storyline that I’m looking forward to everyone actually seeing, because it’s quite a wild ride.”\n\nAre you enjoying the pairing of Brady and Fiona on DAYS? ?
