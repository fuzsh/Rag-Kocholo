        "text": "There's very little chance that you're planning to watch \"Battle of the Network Reality Stars\" on Bravo tonight, but if you are, do not.\n\nThis boring goof is meant to be a throwback to the hilarious hokeyness of \"Battle of the Network Stars,\" those old red-white-and-blue showdowns in which 1970's greats -- \"Fawcett, Crystal, Carter and Kaplan,\" as they're recalled in tonight's nostalgia segment -- met up in Malibu for a showdown in events like dunk box and obstacle course. They wore Speedos and sweatbands and ha ho ha. Those shows are fun to remember, maybe, but tonight's reprise is a good reminder of how vapid they actually were.\n\nA medium-tech field day for flabby or dopey reality has-beens, \"Battle,\" a six-part series, spends way too much time on the choosing of teams and further bores the viewer by focusing on its scoring system. As if anyone will care who wins.\n\nOne funny moment-- and I'm being charitable -- comes when Richard Hatch, the \"Survivor\" Ã¼berwinner from the first season, tests the jousting chops of Charla Faddoul, the dwarf from \"The Amazing Race.\" They're on the same team, so this is just for practice, to make Charla prove her claim that she can't be toppled because she's so short. Richard, skeptical, gives her a couple of serious shoves, which she withstands."
