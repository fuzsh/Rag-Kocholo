        "text": "IN the 500-channel universe, dead shows don't get to rest in peace. Yet ABC's ''Battle of the Network Stars'' has managed to vanish completely from the rerun afterlife. An occasional quasi-sports competition that ran from 1976 to 1988, ''Battle of the Network Stars'' featured teams of celebrities from ABC, CBS and NBC (back when there were just three networks) going head to head in everything from flag football to kayak racing to Simon Says. At the play-by-play mike sat Howard Cosell, his sarcasm oddly muffled. Or maybe he just didn't care anymore.\n\nMost of the celebrities, though, seemed to take things way too seriously. Everybody who was anybody in prime time suited up for ''Battle of the Network Stars'' -- it was like Emmy night with taunting and a dunk tank. Which led to memorable incidents, like Robert Conrad, the competition-crazed captain of the NBC team, crowing over a foot race and making the ABC captain, Gabe (''Welcome Back, Kotter'') Kaplan, so mad that he dug down deep and blew Mr. Conrad off the track.\n\n''Battle of the Network Stars'' was a celebrity peep show, with egos as exposed as a Charlie's Angel in a wet T-shirt (of which it offered many glimpses). It was utter trash, and it was delicious. Back then, though, we didn't know that it would spawn an entire genre, that way off in 2003 we'd summon our fuzzy memories of Grizzly Adams and the Incredible Hulk straining at opposite ends of a tug-of-war rope and realize that we'd witnessed the dawn of celebreality.\n\nCelebreality, the junk genre du jour, turns the notion of reality TV upside down. Instead of real people acting like celebrities on shows like ''Survivor,'' ''Big Brother'' and ''The Bachelor,'' celebreality gives us celebrities acting like real people on shows like ''The Osbournes,'' ''The Anna Nicole Show'' and ''Celebrity Boot Camp.'' I'm using the term ''celebrity'' loosely here -- we're not talking about Russell Crowe, Julia Roberts and Dame Judi Dench eating bugs and scrubbing latrines.\n\nNo, the celebrities of celebreality are a motlier crew, like, well, Motley Crue's Vince Neil, the former rap superstar M. C. Hammer and the wee ex-Michael Jackson ornament Emmanuel (''Webster'') Lewis. Those three will be setting up housekeeping together on Thursday in ''The Surreal Life'' on WB, a celebreality spin on MTV's ''Real World.'' Not to be outdone, ABC sends a Baldwin brother (Stephen), a supermodel (Frederique) and a former ''L.A. Law'' star (Corbin Bernsen) to Hawaii for ''Celebrity Mole Hawaii,'' beginning Wednesday.\n\nCelebreality is awash in one-hit wonders (Vanilla Ice, Tiffany) and ''Baywatch'' babes (Gena Lee Nolin, Traci Bingham), former child stars (Barry Williams) and former child stars with police records (Todd Bridges), repeat offenders (Tonya Harding) and star witnesses (Kato Kaelin). Our digital-cable-and-gossip-driven culture creates new stars every day, and most of them can't really do anything. So celebreality has replaced the variety shows of yore; it's a showcase for stars who have little to offer beyond being famous.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
