        "text": "When Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks get together, they tell some of the best World War II you’ve ever seen. We’re talking Saving Private Ryan, The Pacific, and the fantastic HBO miniseries, Band of Brothers.\n\nIn 2024, they'll partner with Austin Butler (Elvis) and Barry Keoghan (Banshees of Inisherin) for the long-awaited Masters of the Air—which is based on Donald L. Miller’s book of the same name. Originally pitched as an Apple TV+ launch title in 2019, the WWII series will finally see the light of the day this winter. In the latest trailer for the upcoming war drama, the boys howl as they take to the skies and \"send up the largest air armada ever assembled in the history of mankind, straight into Hitler's territory.\" We also glimpse the bombing raids that were conducted over Nazi Germany, as well as the perilous battles that took place over 25,000 feet in the air.\n\nDeadline reports that the nine-episode series cost around $250 million to produce, and you can see the budget in AppleTV+'s first look. Plus, in addition to Keoghan and Butler, Masters of the Air will also feature Sex Education’s Ncuti Gatwa and Fantastic Beasts's Callum Turner. Graham Yost, the creator of Justified, penned the screenplay alongside John Orloff (Band of Brothers).\n\n\"Masters of the Air is a salute to the brave men of the 8th Air Force, who, through their courage and brotherhood, helped defeat Nazi Germany in World War II,\" executive producer Gary Goetzman said in a press release. \"Tom and Steven have always wanted to visualize cinematically what our author Don Miller has called, this ‘singular event in the history of warfare.' We’re thrilled that Apple TV+ has given us the opportunity to combine the efforts of so many talented people, on-screen and behind the camera, to tell this important story.\"\n\nThe first two episodes of Masters of the Air will premiere on Apple TV+ on January 26, 2024, continuing weekly through March 15. If it’s anything like Band of Brothers, we’re in for something special."
