        "text": "ABC’s revival of Battle of the Network Stars announced its 100 competitors, and said the revival of the 1976 to 1988 show “will be a nostalgic throwback to the original series, where TV celebrities blended athleticism with hilarious antics while featuring an array of fan favorites from numerous TV series.”\n\n20 of those people competed on the 1970s and 1980s version, including Facts of Life and Survivor star Lisa Welchel. The cast also includes many people we’ve seen on other reality shows, such as Lance Bass, Jack and Kelly Osbourne, Lou Ferrigno, and Nick Lachey, whose names are marked with an asterisk below.\n\nOver 10 episodes, teams of television stars will compete in simple and ridiculous games such as archery, tug of war, and a dunk tank, and they’ll do that in teams based on their characters, not with people from the same network, like they did in the past.\n\nFormer NFL player DeMarcus Ware and Olympian Ronda Rousey will captain the teams. Hosting the show are ESPN’s Mike Greenberg and Joe Tessitore.\n\nBattle of the Network Stars’ teams and cast\n\nHere are the teams, via ABC’s announcement:\n\nTV Sitcoms (Bronson Pinchot, Tom Arnold, Dave Coulier, AJ Michalka, Tracey Gold)\n\nvs. TV Kids (Joey Lawrence, Corbin Bleu, Nolan Gould, *Lisa Whelchel, *Kim Fields)\n\nPrimetime Soaps (Ian Ziering, Josh Henderson, Gabrielle Carteris, *Donna Mills, Mischa Barton)\n\nvs. ABC Stars (*Olivia d’Abo, *Shari Belafonte, Michael Fishman, Jason Hervey, Anson Williams)\n\nVariety (Joanna Krupa, Nick Lachey, Vanessa Lachey, Gilles Marini, Jack Osbourne)\n\nvs. TV Sex Symbols (Keegan Allen, Traci Bingham, Rosa Blasi, Brant Daugherty, Galen Gering)\n\nCops (Erik Estrada, *Larry Wilcox, Kelly Hu, Jodi Lyn O’Keefe, *Lorenzo Lamas)\n\nvs. TV Sitcoms (*Todd Bridges, Leigh-Allyn Baker, Dave Foley, Willie Garson, Jenna von Oy)\n\nWhite House (Cornelius Smith Jr., Marlee Matlin, Joshua Malina, LaMonica Garrett, Mary McCormack)\n\nvs. Lawyers (Elisabeth Rohm, Corbin Bernsen, Matt McGorry, Romi Dias, Catherine Bell)\n\nTV Moms & Dads (Chad Lowe, *Greg Evigan, *Ted McGinley, Lesley Fera, Jackee Harry)\n\nvs. TV Kids (*Jimmie Walker, *Mackenzie Phillips, Jonathan Lipnicki, Krista Marie Yu, Jeremy Miller)\n\nFamous TV Families (Danny Bonaduce, Barry Williams, Beverley Mitchell, *Willie Aames, *Charlene Tilton)\n\nvs. Doctors (Thomas Calabro, Taye Diggs, Rachelle Lefevre, *Deidre Hall, Benjamin Hollingsworth)\n\nTroublemakers (Vivica A.
