Brand manager Lisha Perez said the company’s mission was to “make a woman’s looks a source of confidence, not anxiety, around the world.”\n\nSteve Schiffman, CEO of the Justice Channel, shared that when the network enlisted John Walsh to be part of the network – which airs a 30-second interstitial every hour to get help identifying missing children – “We weren’t just getting John Walsh, we were getting the whole Walsh family.” Walsh’s son Callahan, accepting the Cynopsis Legacy award on his father’s behalf, brought some in the room to tears as he talked of his brother Adam being kidnapped and killed as a little boy, a tragedy that motivated his parents to start a national organization for children’s rights. “Adam’s song is to continue, and we must continue to do the singing,” said Walsh. The center has solved the cases of over 232,000 missing children to date.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nNBCUniversal will sell $1 billion of its inventory in this year’s upfront market using data from its Audience Targeting Platform (ATP), which includes information from set top boxes and third party sources. “By bringing together premium content at scale with guarantees based on business priorities, we’re giving clients the best of both worlds: The audiences they need and the targeting they crave which is superior to other platforms,” said Linda Yaccarino, NBCU Chairman of Advertising Sales and Client Partnerships.\n\nCASTING\n\nLeah Remini and Jessica Gunning are set to star in NBC pilot What About Barb?, a female-centric adaptation of the 1991 film What About Bob?.
