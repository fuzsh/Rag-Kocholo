        "text": "ABC’S hit summer revival of Battle of the Network Stars continues Thursday with TV Cops against the stars of TV Sitcoms. The special thing about this episode is the re-teaming of original BOTNS veterans and former CHiPs co-stars Larry Wilcox (Jon Baker) and Erik Estrada (Frank \"Ponch\" Poncherello) who haven’t shared the screen since TNT’s CHiPs '99 reunion movie (telecast in 1998). For Wilcox, who actually appeared on the first-ever BOTNS in 1976, getting the call to do this update was a surprise. “I got an email asking if I would do it and if I was handicapped in any way that would prevent me,” Wilcox shared with me during his BOTNS taping at Pepperdine University. “Initially there was a bunch of paranoid reactions, but I told them I could do everything."
