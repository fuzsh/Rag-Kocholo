        "text": "It looks like Las Vegas very well could be the future home of some high profile movie studios.\n\nOne of the more popular headlines this year has been the relocation of celebrity Mark Wahlberg to Las Vegas. Wahlberg famously brought his family to Vegas for a better life. And since his relocation, Wahlberg has been doing film projects in Southern Nevada.\n\nWell, apparently, Wahlberg is pretty impressed with the film industry in Sin City. He believes we have a lot of talent in Las Vegas. He’s so impressed that he believes Southern Nevada should be home to its own movie studios. And we’re not just talking about the independent ones. Big names like Disney and Sony have been dropped.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wahlberg was in Carson City to lobby for a new bill that would expand Nevada‘s film tax credit program, thenevadaindependent.com reported. The bill would allow for new studio projects in Las Vegas for the next 20 years. It would also give big tax breaks to companies who film movies and television shows in Nevada.\n\nOne such project would be a new studio built in Summerlin. Located near the I-215 and Hualapai Way, the studio would be in partnership with the Howard Hughes Corp. Another studio, called the “Zone One” project, would be built near the I-215 and Durango. That project, lead by California real estate developer, Brandon Birtcher, is already in negotiations with big studio companies, including Sony and Disney (ktnv.com).\n\nThere are a few more steps before Sin City gets its own movie studio.\n\nCurrently the new bill has only gone before the Senate Finance Committee. It would still need to pass through the Senate and State Assembly. The final step for approval would be a signature from Governor Joe Lombardo."
