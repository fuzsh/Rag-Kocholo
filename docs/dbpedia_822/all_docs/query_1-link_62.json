        "text": "This list only includes child care facilities from the past two years that have had a certificate of registration/license revoked, suspended or administratively closed or the department refused to renew it. An administrative closure occurs when the department agrees to allow closure of a certificate of registration/license despite unresolved disciplinary issues. Administrative closures are listed on the table as closed.\n\nNote: An individual or organization may be refused a certificate of registration/license for at least two years after having a certificate of registration/license revoked, suspended or administratively closed. Effective May 27, 2010, if the certificate of registration/license was revoked due to violations that resulted in serious injury or death of a child, the individual or organization can never be issued a certificate of registration/license.\n\nIf you would like additional information on a facility, including a copy of the notice of intent, settlement agreement or final order closing the certificate of registration/license, you may submit a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Go to the FOIA page for instructions on how to submit a request."
