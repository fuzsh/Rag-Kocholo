        "text": "When you're trying to tease a couple billion dollars out of a roomful of advertisers, it helps to have a smokin' PowerPoint presentation. Last week, when Fox tried to sell its fall lineup to advertisers in New York City, its idea of exciting was asking the studiously bland Carrie Underwood to sing a tune. The folks at ABC hired a real star--Mary J. Blige--but played \"Desperate Housewives\" clips shamelessly while she performed. NBC's presentation was soporific; CBS's was terrific: Mariah Carey and the cast of \"Jersey Boys.\" But it was Chris Rock, creator of \"Everybody Hates Chris,\" who gave the crowd what it really wanted--a sales pitch without the song and dance. \"We want you to buy more ads because Chris is going to be played by a white girl,\" he said. \"You are going to see more white people this year than you have before. Sometimes they are just going to walk through, wave and say, 'Hi! I'm white'.\"\n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is a peek inside the weeklong suck-up known as the upfronts. They're called that because the networks hope to entice companies into advertising upfront--that is, before the fall season starts and the corpses start floating to the surface. Each network spends a half day selling itself with slick clips, lavish parties (where you can take a Polaroid with your favorite star) and Rumsfeld-size boasts. \"We've hit a gold mine here!\" said NBC's Kevin Reilly. \"ABC has more appointment television than anyone. Period,\" said ABC's Steve McPherson. When you think about it, \"upfront\" is a funny name for the whole affair. \"Where I come from, 'upfront' means straightforward, honest,\" said Spike Feresten, who will host a new Fox talk show in the fall. \"After watching these for the last four days, one word that doesn't come to mind is 'upfront'.\"\n\nPerhaps a better word is \"desperate.\" How else to explain Fox's hauling in the Rutgers marching band--flag twirlers and all--to punch up a sales pitch on its sports programming? The networks should be nervous, frankly. Last year advertisers paid more than $9 billion after the upfronts, but the networks didn't produce a single breakout hit on the order of \"Housewives\" or \"Lost\" or \"Grey's Anatomy.\" And since then, streaming video, iPods and cell-phone broadcasts have become all the rage. Will traditional TV still bring home the bacon? NBC actually spent as much time bragging about video players, I-villages and broadband channels as it did hyping its new shows (which may say something about the shows). The folks at CBS touted their \"brand extensions\" with a commercial for the mock \"Criminal Minds' Greatest Hits\" album, featuring \"50 Ways to Cleave Your Mother,\" etc.--which might have gotten a decent laugh without the syringes and knives.\n\nBut forget about the silly spectacles. How are the new shows? It's nearly impossible to tell what's promising from five-minute clips--it's like judging a cappuccino by licking the froth. But you can already spot some trends. Look for more high-concept dramas. One (NBC's \"Kidnapped\") follows a single child abduction over the course of the entire season, and another (ABC's \"Day Break\") features a detective who relives the same day until he can exonerate himself in a murder case. There are two shows about weddings (ABC's \"Big Day\" and Fox's \"The Wedding Album\"), two starring Baldwin brothers and two starring Corddry brothers, late of \"The Daily Show.\" There are also two set behind the scenes at a late-night comedy show: one a comedy from Tina Fey, the other a drama by Aaron Sorkin. Surprise, surprise--they're both on NBC. \"We put them both on because they both deserved to be on,\" said Reilly. Right. And the fact that they're both virtually product placements for \"SNL\" had nothing to do with it.\n\nDespite appearances, the upfronts are not just a big, expensive game of smoke and mirrors. Some folks do tell it like it is--and snarkily. Not long before McPherson boasted about ABC's \"appointment television,\" talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel announced to the crowd: \"If you've got raffle ticket number 113654, you won an 'Emily's Reasons Why Not' tote bag!\" (Heather Graham's show was last season's biggest bomb.) When Paul Haggis, the writer/director of \"Crash,\" introduced a clip from his NBC show, \"The Black Donnellys,\" he took a swipe at his new home: \"You win a couple of Oscars, and you'd think you have a show on the No. 1 network.\" And if you watch upfront presentations carefully, you can pick up some clues about what's to come. Meredith Vieira received a noticeably bigger reception at NBC than Katie Couric did at CBS. Could that be a portent of the fall? Or what about the fact that the audience all but booed \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" alum Brad Garrett when he promoted his Fox sitcom by saying: \"It's just great to stay on a stage where I don't have to kiss Ray Romano's a--.\"\n\nIn the end, the week's biggest ovation went to ABC's McPherson. He lost a bet with Kimmel about \"Dancing With the Stars\" and paid up by doing a cha-cha with sexy Edyta. \"Let it never be said that I welch on a bet,\" said McPherson. Fair enough. Last year he stood on the same spot and raved about \"Emily's Reasons Why Not.\" But that was just bluffing."
