        "text": "Battle of the network stars is one of those tv shows that stands as probably one of the best team competitions of all time. The show pins the television stars of the 70's and 80's from all three major networks ABC, NBC, and CBS in head to head competition for prize money. The competition is broken down into a combination of athletic events along with an obstacle course and many other fun and exciting events. The show is hosted by the legendary commentator Howard Cosell along with other celebrity commentators that join him, such Bruce Jenner, Morgan Fairchild, and others throughout the shows run. This show was fun to watch when celebrities back then could let their hair down and be themselves and have a great time competing. Robert Conrad has to be one of the best standouts of the entire shows run for his athleticism and competitive nature, especially against Gabe Kaplan and his team. The show provided some of the best moments in team competition especially the tug of war finals. Some of the other standout competitors was Scott Baio, Tony Danza, Patrick Duffy, John Beck, Tracy Scroggins, Mr. T, Sherry Belafonte, Kristie Mcnickel, Tele Savalis, and many others which made the show entertaining to watch. It's too bad the entire ten year run of the show has not been released for streaming, yet maybe someday. This show is definitely a throwback to a much better era which was a privilege to grow up in and for me will never be forgotten. BATTLE OF THE NETWORK STARS IS A TIMELESS PART OF TELEVISION HISTORY. There are some episodes on the internet, so take some time and watch it, you will be glad you did."
