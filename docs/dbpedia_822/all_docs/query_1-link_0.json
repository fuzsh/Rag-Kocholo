DDE also held on to ABC/Kane Productions' library and will continue to represent ABC News Productions.[91]\n\nABC News Productions\n\nABC News Productions (ABCNP) is a long form documentary production unit[92] within ABC News's ABC News Digital Media Group.[93] ABCNP produces documentaries for cable channels, international broadcasters and home video.[92]\n\nABC News Productions was formed in 1994. In August 2006, ABCNP was placed into ABC News All Media along with the ABC News production unit.[92]\n\nABC Motion Pictures\n\nABC Motion Pictures was a production company of ABC that operated from May 1979.[95] 20th Century Fox was the company's distributor. Until October 1985, the division produced theatrical films along with TV movies, series and mini-series.[96]\n\nHistory\n\nABC Motion Pictures was founded in May 1979 with Brandon Stoddard as president.[97] Soon the division was swapped with old film projects. While a boutique would make only a few films per year, Stoddard figured that ABC would succeed in movie production as there were additional revenue sources from video cassettes and cable on top of theater ticket sales and broadcast TV sales.[95] ABC Motion Pictures was incorporated by June 11, 1980.[98]\n\nThe division waited two years to get its first slate of three films into production with National Lampoon's Class Reunion just an announcement and Young Doctors in Love beginning production in December 1981 under the theatrical directorial debut of Garry Marshall. In June 1982, \"Chain Reaction\" (later \"Silkwood\"[96]) starring Meryl Streep was expected to be in production.[99]\n\nThe Flamingo Kid after released by Fox did well but not strong business, Fox pulled the film from release so as to stop spending money on advertising.[96]\n\nWith networks getting better rating for their own movies of the week over films released on cable and cassettes, networks reduced licensing of theatrical films. Additional boutique production companies entered the market at the same time crowding the market and increasing filming costs. With films distributed by a major studio, ABC's films were slotted in less desirable release dates. On October 28, 1985, ABC shut down ABC Motion Pictures theatrical motion picture operation after the release of only 6 theatrical films[96] which was within weeks of CBS shutting down CBS Theatrical Films.[95] The unit released one last movie, SpaceCamp, already produced in the summer of 1985.[84] The unit would continue producing TV movies and mini-series while increasing TV series output. A Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation media analyst forecast ABC's losses on its theatrical operations for 1985 to be $5 million.[96] After ABC shuttered down, the company elected to terminate its agreement with Mercury Entertainment in March 1986.[100]\n\nFilmography\n\nTheatrical films\n\nTitle Year Notes Young Doctors in Love 1982 profitable[96] National Lampoon's Class Reunion 1982[99] Silkwood 1983 profitable[96] The Flamingo Kid 1984 profitable[96] Impulse 1984 Prizzi's Honor 1985[57] profitable[96] SpaceCamp 1986[84]\n\nABC Pictures International\n\nABC Pictures International, Inc.

Selznick owned films were sold after his death in 1965 to API by his widow, Jennifer Jones.[103]\n\nThe company's films (including those made by Selmur and Palomar) were not profitable[104] and, with the recession of 1969–1971, ABC Pictures Corporation closed down its operations[li 3] in early 1973.[li 1] The 36 films cost $75 million to produce and generated rentals of $107 million, but with other costs such as distribution fees and interest, generated losses of $35 million.[104] Only 6 of the films were profitable.[104]\n\nOn October 20, 1977, ABC Picture Holdings, Inc. changed its name to ABC Pictures International, Inc. and was finally dissolved on February 19, 1988.[101]\n\nRelease Date Title Other production co. 1967 Good Times[104] Motion Pictures International[105] May 20, 1970 Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came August 12, 1970 Lovers and Other Strangers October 1, 1970 How Do I Love Thee?

In May, AMP was developing The Aisha Tyler Show, a variety & comedy talk show with interactive components including social media, for cable or broadcast syndication.[116]\n\nPrograms\n\nCha$e, Sci Fi Channel[115]\n\nWho Wants to Be a Millionaire, syndication\n\nAt the Movies With Ebert & Roeper, syndication (1986-)\n\n\"The Fashionista Diaries\" (SoapNet)\n\n\"Camouflage\" Game Show Network[117]\n\nWayne Brady Show [118]\n\nAmerican Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres Pictures\n\nAtlas Pictures Corporation, formerly American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres Pictures Corporation (also known as AB-PT Pictures and AB-PT) was the film production subsidiary of American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres.\n\nThe company was formed due to a shorting of films produced,[119] which was the reason for AB-PT not to sign a consent agreement in 1949 against the company's production of films.[120] Films from AB-PT were first shown in Paramount Theater circuits prior to release to other chains.[119] AB-PT Pictures used the Republic Pictures lot for productions.[121] Republic was also their distributor, physically delivering to even AB-PT theaters plus sale to non-AB-PT theaters.[122]\n\nAmerican Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres Pictures Corporation was formed on December 30, 1956.

On May 9, 1957, AB-PT Pictures executives met with the exhibition arm of the film industry where they announced their first slate of 7 films with announcement of a distributor in the next 10 days.[121]\n\nOn June 6, 1957, AB-PT agreed to have Republic distribute their films.[122] The company's first double bill films did well despite the films uneven quality.[123] On September 24, 1957, AB-PT Pictures indicated that the company would move in the next year into A features with 5 of their 15 planned films to be of this type. For the A films, budgets would run from $.5 million to $1 million. However, AB-PT would only produce four films.[119] AB-PT Pictures provided funding for The Bat (1959 film).[126]\n\nLevin along with Harry L. Mandell purchased AB-PT Pictures and AB-PT Distribution Corporation from AB-PT in May 1958.[127][128][129] AB-PT Pictures was renamed Atlas Pictures Corporation.[126]\n\nFilms\n\nBeginning of the End (June 19, 1957)\n\nThe Unearthly (June 19, 1957)[121]\n\nEighteen and Anxious (February 1958)\n\nGirl in the Woods (February 1958)[126]\n\nCircle Seven Productions\n\nNot to be confused with ABC Circle 7 Productions, or with Circle 7 Animation, a division of Walt Disney Animation Studios created to make Pixar sequels.\n\nCircle Seven Productions was the production company of ABC's owned-and-operated station in San Francisco, KGO-TV, in the 1950s and 1960s.
