        "text": "Antiracism protesters gathered in Britain\n\nThousands of police officers were mobilized across Britain yesterday amid fears of a new round of anti-immigrant riots, after far-right groups called for further protests. But at least as of early evening, large far-right demonstrations had not materialized, and only a handful of arrests had been made.\n\nInstead, thousands of antiracism protesters gathered across the country, including in Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool and London. Some of those demonstrations were close to places that had been identified as potential targets for rioters.\n\nIn Liverpool, people banged drums, chanted “Fascists out!” and held signs that read “Love Not Hate,” as a helicopter circled overhead. The gathering was diverse, made up of locals who were surprised that their street had become the center of a demonstration, as well as union groups and others who voiced condemnation of the recent violence."
