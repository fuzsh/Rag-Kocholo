        "text": "Empowering amicable parenting\n\nCo-parenting can be tough. You are navigating an unexpected new reality. OurFamilyWizard helps reduce conflict—so your kids have two healthy homes.\n\nPowerful features custom fit to your family\n\nNew: Secure calling for co-parents\n\nStay connected to your child when you're apart. Use Calls for a midweek chat, virtual visitation, or to talk with your co-parent.\n\nConsent is required for both parents—turn on consent when you're ready to receive video or audio calls.\n\nCall activity is automatically documented, from who called to who turned off their mic.\n\nCalls use an internet connection, not a cell network, so your phone number is never shared.\n\nShared co-parent calendar\n\nSimplify your shared parenting schedule and request/accept time trades in one click—reducing tension from back-and-forth negotiation.\n\nStay organized with color-coded time slots and real-time updates\n\nSimplify time trades with Yes/No responses\n\nSolidify holiday schedules well into the future\n\nDocumented messaging\n\nInstead of sending text messages and emails, communicate through one app. Ensure all communications with your co-parent remain on the record. Because messages are unalterable and securely stored in our servers, you will always have one court-admissible source of truth.\n\nTimestamps record when a message was received and read, providing transparency and accountability\n\nLogin history gives a clear picture of everyone's in-app activity\n\nEasy expense tracking\n\nTracking shared parenting expenses, attach receipt files, and keep an accurate payment history so you know who paid what and can settle reimbursements with less legwork.\n\nSpecify payment responsibility splits like 50/50, 80/20, etc.\n\nResolve unpaid expenses with in-app bank transfers via OFWpay™\n\nAlways know what you owe with real-time balance tracking\n\nImportant info, on-demand\n\nThe Info Bank securely stores medical histories, insurance information, emergency contacts, school schedules, photos, and more—so you're never scrambling for details when they matter most.\n\nAccess everything from medical records and insurance policies to school information\n\nUpload and store documents and details\n\nReduce reliance on your co-parent for vital information\n\nTone-check your messages\n\nToneMeter helps keep communication respectful by identifying and flagging emotionally charged phrases while you write, empowering productive, low-conflict conversations.\n\nPrevent conflict before it starts with ToneMeter flags\n\nLike an emotional spell check, ToneMeter can improve communication patterns over time\n\nHelping families living separately thrive since 2001\n\nThe app saved us\n\nI can’t say enough good things about this app and website!! Me and the mother of my children have been separated since our sons were 1 yrs old and before getting this app we had a lot of challenges communicating on major topics. This app saved us and always made this clear and simplistic.\n\nApp Review\n\nConflicts have become far less frequent\n\nOurFamilyWizard has been a H U G E blessing since being court ordered to use it. It has brought undeniable accountability to co-parenting my son, and the conflicts have become far less frequent. As a direct result, I have watched my son flourish and become confident and loving of both myself and his mother. No further need for counseling and a complete 180 with his academics.\n\nApp Review\n\nUnburdens parents from stressful co-parenting\n\nThis app massively unburdens parents from stressful co-parenting situations. Everything is logged, clearly organized, viewable by a judge, a great way to distance yourself from a toxic co-parent and keep things simple and streamlined for the benefit of the child.\n\nApp Review\n\nA great way to start co-parenting effectively\n\nOurFamilyWizard is a great way to start co-parenting effectively especially if you are dealing with a combative parent. It helps monitor and store all the messages for future references. I have had great experiences with it thus far and more than likely will be continuing to use it for the long run!\n\nApp Review\n\nYour next step is simple: Try us for 30 days.\n\nThe OurFamilyWizard app is risk-free with our money-back guarantee\n\nAs Seen In\n\nDo you work with parents?\n\nSee why more legal professionals recommend OurFamilyWizard to their clients than any other co-parenting app."
