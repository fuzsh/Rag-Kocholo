        "text": "Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is a premier federal law enforcement agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). We shield our nation from global threats to ensure Americans are safe and secure.\n\nHSI investigates crime on a global scale – at home, abroad and online – to prevent harm to you locally.\n\nWe live and work alongside the people we are sworn to protect, so our work is personal. HSI identifies, investigates and stops criminals, while supporting those victimized by their crimes.\n\nHSI is committed to protecting you and serving our country. Through innovation, hard work and determination, we work with our partners to combat crime and keep you safe.\n\nOur Mission – What We Do, How We Do It\n\nAt HSI, we protect what matters most – our country, our people and our future. What makes us unique is the global nature of the crimes we investigate and the broad legal authorities available to us to combat them.\n\nHSI conducts federal criminal investigations into the illegal movement of people, goods, money, contraband, weapons and sensitive technology into, out of and through the United States. HSI’s investigations are wide ranging – our cases include drug and weapons smuggling, cyber and financial crime, illegal technology exports and intellectual property crime. We also play a crucial role in investigating crimes of exploitation. This includes combating child exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud and scams and other crimes against vulnerable populations.\n\nGlobal crime requires a global response. HSI has offices in 235 cities across the United States and an international presence that spans over 90 offices in more than 50 countries. HSI identifies and stops crime before it reaches the United States. Crime doesn’t stop at our borders, and neither do we.\n\nPartnerships with law enforcement counterparts, the private sector and our local communities are a key part of HSI’s success. From our communities at home to our partners abroad, we work together to fight global crime.\n\nAt the end of the day, HSI’s goal is clear – to shield Americans from threats to their safety and security – at home, abroad and online.\n\nOur Pledge – Fighting Global Threats, Protecting American Lives\n\nGlobal crime impacts every aspect of our lives – HSI’s job is to protect you and keep you safe from it. We do this every day, in cities and communities across the United States and around the world.\n\nHSI’s value lies in the outcome of our investigations:\n\nKeeping dangerous drugs and gang members off our streets.\n\nIdentifying and supporting victims rescued from child exploitation, human trafficking and forced labor.\n\nPreventing intellectual property theft and keeping dangerous and deadly technology out of our enemies’ hands.\n\nStopping financial fraud, illegal trade and the sale of fake goods to protect the U.S. economy, American businesses and your money.\n\nProtecting American consumers, businesses, vulnerable populations and the public from cyber threats.\n\nPreventing terrorists and other bad actors from entering the country and harming our people.\n\nHSI does this by stopping criminals. We identify, disrupt and shut down their illegal networks. We seize their money and their assets to keep them from breaking the law again. Our agents arrest criminals and work with prosecutors to provide justice to their victims.\n\nThis comprehensive approach is key to HSI’s mission. Our efforts today help ensure a safer tomorrow.\n\nOur Core Values – Honor, Service, Integrity\n\nWe will:\n\nPerform our duties honorably and with dignity in a manner befitting the oath of office we are sworn to uphold.\n\nServe the nation proudly and face challenges with courage and determination.\n\nExemplify integrity by adhering to the highest ethical and moral code.\n\nOur History – Honoring Our Legacy\n\nOur public service mission dates back to 1789. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on 9/11, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as a stand-alone, Cabinet-level department to further coordinate and unify national homeland security efforts.\n\nDHS opened its doors on March 1, 2003, and was created through the combination of all or part of 22 different federal departments and agencies into a unified Department. Two of those agencies combined within DHS were the U.S. Customs Service (formerly part of the Department of Treasury) and the INS (formerly part of the Department of Justice). The customs law enforcement responsibilities and investigations components of those two agencies formed the Offices of Investigations, Intelligence, and International Affairs within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement."
