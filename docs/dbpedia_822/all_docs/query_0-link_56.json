        "text": "I am very proud to be Welsh and particularly to be from the Rhondda Valley, but before the Eisteddfod came to Pontypridd, just 10 minutes away from my home, I had never considered going for one really simple reason - I can't speak Welsh.\n\nMy parents don't speak Welsh so I went to English-medium schools where it was obligatory to study Welsh until the age of 16 and take a GCSE in Welsh as second language. While I had weekly Welsh lessons from the age of 11 to 16, I can honestly say I don't ever use a word of it.\n\nI am very clearly Welsh - you can't hide my Rhondda accent - and proud of it, but I never really had a good experience learning the language in school, and I thought it would be embarrassing to go to the Eisteddfod and not be able to understand or speak to people.\n\nREAD MORE: Eisteddfod mural artist reveals the sweet story behind stunning artwork\n\nREAD MORE: I went to my first ever Eisteddfod and was blown away by one thing\n\nI don't look back on my Welsh lessons at school with any fondness and many of the others in my class didn't see the point in learning the language, not helped by the constant focus and repetition on writing basic sentences about Tom Jones and Charlotte Church, or Casualty being filmed in Wales.\n\nIt wasn't the fault of my teachers who always seemed to be fighting an uphill battle, but there was a general lack of desire to learn Welsh, which for some reason wasn't the same when it came to studying other languages, like French or Spanish.\n\nThe lack of Welsh teachers in my school was another problem, to the point where my sister was taught her Welsh second-language GCSE by someone who wasn't fluent in the language. I know the Welsh Government has an ambitious goal of creating a million Welsh speakers by 2050 with its Cymraeg 2050 strategy, but if Welsh second-language education is not invested in and nurtured in areas like mine, we will continue to be left behind.\n\nGoing to the Eisteddfod has made me wish I could speak Welsh even more than before. While everyone was more than happy to speak to me in English once I said \"dim siared Cymraeg\", I always felt slightly embarrassed. For the latest Pontypridd news, sign up to our newsletter here\n\nThis hit home the most when I went to watch the solo recitation for those aged between 12 and under 16 at the Pavilion. You didn't need to understand what was being sung to enjoy the performances, but when my translation headset told me the song was about the Welsh language being revived in the valleys, I couldn't help but think that in my experience, this wasn't really true.\n\nHowever, even if you can't speak Welsh there is still plenty at the Eisteddfod to enjoy. I didn't realise Ynysangharad War Memorial Park was so big and it was great to see that it has been completely transformed for the festival in the centre of town, which in turn has led to more Welsh being spoken on the streets.\n\nLeaving the railway station and heading towards the Maes, it was lovely to immediately hear Welsh being spoken on the streets of Ponty, with police officers welcoming everyone by saying \"Bore da!\" Hearing Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau at the Gorsedd ceremony was also brilliant, albeit sounding a little bit different to how it's sung at the rugby.\n\nIt has also been great to see Pontypridd and the surrounding areas get behind the Eisteddfod, even though not everyone understands what goes on there. Throughout Rhydyfelin and Hawthorn there are hundreds of metres of colourful bunting, Welsh flags and signs saying \"croeso\" and \"shwmae\". Local high streets throughout the valleys, from Porth to Treorchy, are also covered in Welsh flags and bunting.\n\nEven though it rained, there was a great atmosphere on the Maes. The drizzle did not dampen anyone's mood, the crowds remained and there were plenty of places to enjoy a picnic under cover in the many tents that have been set up.\n\nYou also didn't need to understand the language to enjoy the music on offer. From the competitions at the Pavilion to the bands and artists performing on the main stage, the Eisteddfod is a fantastic display of Welsh talent.\n\nThere is also plenty to see in terms of the stalls on offer, which you need plenty of time to explore. There are bigger stalls for places like the National Museum of Wales, where you can learn more about what work they are doing, to smaller stalls for small businesses selling beautiful handmade gifts and homeware.\n\nMeanwhile, activities are on offer for children of all ages, with music, table tennis and basketball hoops at the Maes B area, and many stalls offering games and things to keep the little ones occupied. There is also a great food offering, but if the prices are too expensive there are also plenty of cheaper options in local cafes on the local high street, just off the Maes.\n\nI really hope that the Eisteddfod has a legacy in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Towns and villages in the valleys in particular deserve investment, so that in the future more people from RCT can go to the Eisteddfod - not just because it is in their local park, but because they can speak Welsh and feel that it is for them.\n\nThe Welsh Government is currently reworking the rules surrounding Welsh second-language education. The Welsh Language and Education Bill is designed to alleviate the gap between pupils' levels of Welsh depending on the school they attend, and also aims to ensure that all pupils in English-medium schools receive more Welsh education. I really hope they listen to the experiences of people like me and my teachers about what needs to change.\n\nWhile my experience may have been bittersweet as it made me long to be able to speak Welsh, the Eisteddfod itself is a great day out for everyone, Welsh speaker or not. There is plenty of food to enjoy, things to do and fun to be had, even in the rain!"
