        "text": "In PlayStation Stars, a campaign is a set of objectives that you can complete to earn a specified reward. Depending on the objective(s) involved, the reward may be either a digital collectible or points.\n\nTo find your full list of currently available campaigns, check the PlayStation Stars hub on PlayStation App. Campaign offerings rotate frequently.\n\nYou may need a PlayStation Plus subscription to complete certain campaigns and some campaigns offer exclusive rewards for PlayStation Plus subscribers when completed.\n\nOnce you redeem a reward with points, in some countries and/or regions, you have time to change your mind, cancel your purchase and get a refund. However, if you consent to immediate delivery of the digital content (such as a digital collectible) or immediate supply of the service, we can provide them immediately to you and limit your right to cancel those orders provided we explain to you how that affects your cancellation rights. Because most of our customers want to use their purchases straight away, we design our purchase flows to get your consent to immediate delivery of digital content and services and we provide you with clear information about how that affects your cancellation rights. So, unless your purchase is faulty, or you have other rights to cancel your order under applicable local laws, when you redeem your points with us you will not be able to change your mind and cancel your purchase once you begin to download the content or add credit to the PSN Wallet.\n\nYou can increase your status level by earning a set number of Rare and Above Trophies and purchasing a set number of Full Games from the PlayStation Store within any calendar year (January 1 to December 31). See below for details:\n\nLevel 1 Entry level Level 2 Purchase one Full Game from PlayStation Store and earn one Rare and Above Trophy. Level 3 Purchase two Full Games from PlayStation Store and earn 32 Rare And Above Trophies. Level 4 Purchase four Full Games from PlayStation Store and earn 128 Rare And Above Trophies.\n\nNote that Full Game purchases and Trophies earned during a calendar year are not carried over to the next calendar year for purposes of determining your status level in that next calendar year.\n\n‘Full Game(s)’ means a paid for digital game purchased and downloaded from PlayStation Store and classified as ‘full game’ or ‘premium edition’ on the game page. It excludes free games, games for $0.00 or equivalent, free trials of games, games included in PlayStation Plus for subscribers, demos, DLC, add-ons or any other purchase from PlayStation Store. Bundles that include one game or more, or bundles that include a game and upgrades, other versions, add-ons, DLC, avatars or other items will count as one ‘Full Game’. All other bundles that do not include one game will not count as a ‘Full Game’.\n\n‘Rare and Above Trophy and Trophies’ include those trophies with rarity values of rare, very rare and ultra-rare at the time of earning and can be from any game you already own.
