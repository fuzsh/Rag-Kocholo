Everything old really is new again.

After seeing success with a block of nostalgic game show revivals, ABC is looking to bring back another — of sorts. The network is already casting a new iteration of Battle of the Network Stars, the long-running series of specials that aired between the 1970s and ‘80s.

The show, which drew from talent from the Big Three networks, featured primetime players competing in sporting events while sportscasters (such as O.J. Simpson) offered play-by-play commentary. The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that the new version is eyeing a May shoot. It hails from ABC and rights-owner IMG, with The Wall makers Glassman Media on board to produce.

Like the original, the rebooted Battle of the Network Stars would draw from talent across broadcast, now a much wider playing field, and feature said celebrities. It’s not the first time the show has been rebooted since its official wrap in 1985. ABC had a one-off several years later, and NBC briefly brought it back in 2003 — though it selfishly only drew from internal talent.

If all goes according to plan, it will join Celebrity Family Feud, Match Game, The $100,000 Pyramid and the upcoming The Gong Show on ABC’s roster of familiar games this summer.
