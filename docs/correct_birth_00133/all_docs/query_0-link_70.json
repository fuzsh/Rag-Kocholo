        "text": "As one spectator was heard to mutter: ``I didn't even know we had that many male players.''\n\nLast year Henman, 21, from Oxford, exited from this tournament in disgrace. Playing doubles with Jeremy Bates he fired away a ball in anger and hit a ballgirl on the head. He was immediately disqualified.\n\nYesterday he rinsed away that awful memory with a gutsy 7-6, 6-3, 6-7, 4-6, 7-5, 3hr 30min triumph over the pro tour's fastest rising star. Henman was a break down in the final set and saved two match points with blistering aces.\n\nTim hails from a tennis-mad family. His grandfather was a regular at Wimbledon and his parents, there to cheer him on yesterday, played to county standards.\n\nIt was reckoned to be the best British performance since John Lloyd beat Roscoe Tanner, the No.4 seed back in 1977.\n\nHenman is a confident character. ``Yes, I thought I could beat him on grass,'' he declared, ``but I knew it was going to be hard.\n\n``The crowd were fantastic; they were behind me when I was two sets up and even when I lost that lead they stayed loyal. One of the reasons I won was their backing.\n\n``I was tired at the end but it was a wonderful way to make your debut on the centre court. This is the greatest moment of my career.''\n\nHe now faces Sapsford in the next round today.\n\nTo be fair, Kafelnikov was carrying an injured knee but he refused to make that an\n\nContinued on Page 37\n\nContinued from Back Page\n\nexcuse. ``I have a problem but it did not affect the result. Some of the calls at vital points were a bit poor but, playing the British No.1 you have to expect that.\n\n``This is a tragic day for me.''\n\nProbably the most astonishing winner was Petchey, the 25-year-old blond Essex man, ranked 202 in the world, who came back from an appalling start to beat Indian Davis Cup star Leander Paes 1-6, 6-2, 6-4, 7-6, the fourth set going to a 13-11 tie-break.\n\nFor the first half-hour Petchey would have been lucky to have hit a stationary bus. Paes passed him on both wings and he was lucky to have a single game.\n\nThe next two sets Mark appeared to be an entirely different player. ``It just took me a little time to settle,'' he explained and, having done so, he pocketed the sets comfortably.\n\nPaes psyched himself up for the finale and there was a lot of finger-pointing. Petchey held serve and nerve for one of the best wins of his career.\n\n``It is important for the Brits to come here and play well. These are the two weeks which matter most to us,'' Petchey commented. ``We are pulling for each other and, hopefully, five years down the line we will have someone that could possibly win this championship.'' I am not sure my nerves could cope with that.\n\nGreg ``the Grin'' Rusedski was the biggest crowd-pleaser of the home victors. He won hearts and minds last year when he leapt the Atlantic by turning his back on his native Canada and adopting Britain, his mother's birthplace. He now has a passport to match.\n\nIronically he had to play Daniel Nestor who rather likes being a Canadian although he was born in Belgrade. There might even have been a little grudge in the air.\n\nNestor never had much of a chance as the Rusedski serve went past him time and again - an incredible 30 aces - and he was beaten in straight sets, two of them tie-breaks. Yet our Greg later revealed he was lucky to be playing at all.\n\n``I put my hip out of joint at Nottingham last week and I was not sure I would be fit until a few days ago.\n\n``My return of serve was not as good as usual but I was confident in the tie-breaks.'' He took up the recurrent theme of the day.\n\n``There is a much more positive attitude in the British squad.''\n\nLuke Milligan is a 19-year-old Middlesex lad who was making his senior Wimbledon debut. Ranked 278th, he faced the Swede Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden, the world No.64, and defeated him 4-6, 6-1, 2-6, 7-5, 6-4, another astonishing performance.\n\n``Once the novelty of being here wore off I played a good second set,'' declared the surprise winner. ``I served well and although I was actually very nervous in my final service game, a couple of people watching said I didn't look it, so I must have hidden it pretty well.''\n\nSapsford, from Surrey, is not exactly a household name either despite 11 appearances in the tournament. Yesterday was the 27-year-old's first-ever singles victory when he beat the Australian qualifier Peter Tramacchi 7-5, 6-4, 6-3.\n\n``I have scrubbed around in the lower reaches of the game,'' he admitted, ``but I never ever lost hope. Playing in two Davis Cup matches helped to raise my morale.''\n\nHe is going to be a father in August which will cheer him still further.\n\nWas there anything else but Brits yesterday? Not too much, in fact.\n\nq GREG Rusedski followed in Princess Diana's footsteps after a hip injury threatened his Wimbledon involvement.\n\nThe British No.2's challenge for the 110th Championships was put in serious doubt when he put his hip out of joint in the Nottingham Open.\n\nBut rather than miss the world's greatest tournament, Rusedski went to a physio called `Razor' - based at the Princess' favourite Harbour Club gym - to come up with a solution.\n\n``He realigned me,'' explained Rusedski, who has hired `Razor' for the week. ``He had to put some acupuncture in there and had to fix up my back and put it back into place, and it was very painful.\n\n``He managed to flick it in and it was brilliant, no trouble whatsoever. I didn't feel anything.''"
