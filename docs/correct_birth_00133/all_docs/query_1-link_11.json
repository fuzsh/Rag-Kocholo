        "text": "TIM HENMAN is a national treasure but unfortunately never managed to make it to a Grand Slam final.\n\nThe 43-year-old made a successful move into the commentary box after retiring and has been a respected member of the BBC punditry team since.\n\nWho is Tim Henman?\n\nTimothy “Tim” Henman was born in Oxford. He is a retired English professional Tennis player.\n\nHenman was ranked British No 1 in 1996 and again from 1999 to 2005, after which he was succeeded by Andy Murray.\n\n\"Tiger Tim\" was a star at Wimbledon, but never managed to reach the final - making the semi-final four times but sadly missing out, each time losing to the eventual champion.\n\nHe also made four other quarter-finals at SW19.\n\nAn expert on grass for much of his career, 2004 was his best season as he also made the semi-finals at the French and US Open.\n\nHe reached a high of World No 4 in three periods from July 2002 to October 2004, before finally retiring in September 2007.\n\nHe has been a part of BBC coverage since 2008.\n\nWhat was his early life like?\n\nHenman began playing tennis before the age of three with a shortened squash racket in his family owned garden tennis court.\n\nThe Oxford-born star came from a long line of Wimbledon legends.\n\nBoth his maternal grandfather, Henry Billington, and his maternal grandmother, Susan Billington, were regulars in the 1950s - and even played mixed doubles together at Sw19.\n\nHis maternal great-grandmother, Susan Billington, also played and was reportedly the first woman to serve overarm.\n\nHenman was picked up by the Slater Squad at the age of 11 where he was coached by David Lloyd.\n\nSlater continued to fund Henman despite the youngster missing two years with injuries, because of insistence from Lloyd who believed in Henman's tennis abilities.\n\nFrom seven to eleven he was enrolled in the private Dragon School in Oxford. He was appointed the school's captain of tennis and led the school's tennis team to win 21 out of 27 matches.\n\nAt the age of 16, Henman told his mother that it was impossible for him to achieve good grades while keeping up in the tennis world.\n\nIn 1990 he dropped out of school and focused on becoming a singles player with the support of coach David Lloyd.\n\nHow was his tennis career?\n\nHenman played both singles and doubles across his career.\n\nHe managed to win 11 ATP titles and at the start of his career won a brilliant silver medal at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.\n\nEarning a reputation as a nearly man, Henman reached six Grand Slam semi-finals but lost all of them - four of those in agonising fashion at Wimbledon.\n\nHe was the first British player to reach the semis since Roger Taylor in the 1970s.\n\nHe reached his highest ever career ranking of World No 4 on July 8, 2002.\n\nAt his last Grand Slam appearance ever, he lost in the second round to Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in four sets.\n\nAs a doubles player, Henman won another four ATP titles.\n\nHenman made more than £10million in prize money during his career.\n\nIs Tim Henman married?\n\nOn 11th December 1999, Henman married his long-time girlfriend Lucy Heald, in Hampshire.\n\nThey have had three daughters."
