        "text": "Tim is feeling confident. He is happy with the way he is playing.\n\nOf course he knows there are a few other players who are in the running for the sought after Wimbledon title.\n\n\"I would say Sampras is the favourite even with his present form just because of his record there. After him I would like to think Hewitt, Agassi, Roddick and myself but the numbers are few on grass.\"\n\nTim's belief in himself is brimming more than ever at the moment.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned professionally I feel in a good frame of mind with where my game is going, and I feel clear on the things I have to work on and improve on. It definitely helps when you are doing that and you are getting good results on the court.\"\n\nHe slipped up against Hewitt in the final at the Stella Artois tournament last week when the young 21-year-old Australian beat him 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.\n\nBut hopefully that was just a glitch in his form. On Monday he goes to Wimbledon ranked fourth in the world. Apart from Queen's his track record has been good. He won at Adelaide, was in the final at Indian Wells TMS, the semi-final in Monte Carlo TMS, quarter- final in Dubai and the fourth round in the Australian Open and Nasdaq 100 Open in Miami.\n\nI caught up with Tim at Stoke Park Club where he chatted during lunch after opening the new tennis facilities which include indoor carpet courts, outdoor all weather courts and grass courts built to Wimbledon standard.\n\nThe 27-year-old, who once trained at Bisham Abbey, says he has improved because he has changed his game.\n\n\"I don't think there's a shot really I can say hasn't been worked on or hasn't been talked about. There's been so many aspects of my game that I've worked on.\n\n\"I think the serving has been the biggest change and had the biggest impact on my game. I have had a lot more consistency with my serve. I can serve a little more aggressively and a little bit faster.\n\n\"My ground strokes I don't think have changed technically too much. My preparation is something that I've been working on.\n\n\"When you see your opponent and see if the ball is coming to your forehand or backhand, I'm very keen to get into position. That was not something I was accustomed to. My strokes were all one motion. As soon as I started the shot the swing would be continuous and I would hit, but then if I was rushed that caused a few problems. What I have worked hard on is if I see the ball to my forehand or backhand I get the racket back and that gives me a lot more time.\"\n\nAlthough Wimbledon is a title he would love to win he takes a pragmatic view.\n\n\"I have never shied away from or denied that it is the ultimate goal for me. That is the one tournament I would love to win, but whether I win it or not only time will tell.\n\n\"If I don't win Wimbledon in my career but I approach my career and continue with the same attitude and commitment, I won't have any complaints because I won't have any regrets. But if I look back in five or six years and say I wish I had trained harder or had worked more on the facets of my game then I would have regrets, and that wouldn't be good news.\"\n\nWith his wife, Lucy, pregnant with their first baby he is looking forward to being a dad in October.\n\n\"I'm very excited. As far as my profession life that goes on. I don't think it will make any difference. I've always been totally committed to what I have wanted to do, and it certainly won't distract me professionally. Away from the court it will be a brilliant distraction to have.\"\n\nThe baby is due when the Davis Cup is on, Tim says the team might have to play without him.\n\n\"I wouldn't miss being at Lucy's side when she goes into labour for anything,\" he says.\n\n\"We've seen the scan and the pictures are amazing. I'm very excited, and I just hope that everything goes well.\"\n\nAlthough he is delighted with the prospect of being a dad, he is not keen on attending birthing classes with Lucy.\n\n\"I don't fancy sitting in a room with six people who know who I am but I don't know who they are.\"\n\nTim first picked up the tennis racket at the age of two and a half. It isn't any wonder he showed a flair for tennis, as his parents Tom and Jane and two older brothers all played the game on a tennis court in their back garden in Oxford.\n\nTennis had always been an important part of the Henman family's way of life. His grandfather, Henry Billington, competed at Wimbledon, and reached the third round in 1948, 1950 and 1951.\n\nTim was a sporty child. Apart from tennis, he also enjoyed playing soccer, cricket, rugby and golf.\n\nHis tennis skills began to shine at the age of ten when became an active member of the David Lloyd/Slater squad. Then after leaving Reeds School with 10 GCSEs he trained at David Lloyd at Raynes Park Club as a junior.\n\nHe showed his talent on the court when he won the under-18 singles and doubles (with Delgado) national titles in 1992.\n\nFrom then he had his foot firmly on the tennis ladder and was playing in the grand slams and on the ATP tour.\n\nHis success on the court meant that in 1997 he was runner-up in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year and Carlton Sports Personality in 1998.\n\nTim is still very much aware that tennis needs to be promoted in this country.\n\nThat is why, he says, he agreed to do a rather risque advertisement for Ariel where it looks as if he does a striptease on the court.\n\n\"With Ariel backing the game, they were keen for someone to front the campaign. When they proposed the idea there were a few doubts from my side. I think it is important that we should have a giggle at ourselves from time to time. And I mixed that in with a bit of cringing.\"\n\nHe knows how important it is to keep the game of tennis to the forefront of sport.\n\n\"Soccer is a massive competitor. It is a lot easier to play if you have a ball and a team. You are ready to go. Tennis is a little bit more difficult and that is where the financial side comes in for making the accessibility of the sport much easier.\"\n\nWhen he finally hangs up his professional tennis racket, what does he think he will do?\n\n\"I definitely think I will be involved in tennis in some shape or form. It would be impossible for me to step away and not have tennis as a part of my life. It is the major passion in my life. I would definitely like to do other things and get involved in working with some of the kids of different ages, and try to pass on some of the experiences I have. That is definitely where I can help.\"\n\nBut before that, he has a tournament to compete in starting on Monday, and hopefully he will be holding up the cup on Sunday July 7 on Centre Court in Wimbledon."
