        "text": "Mr Henman, who was born in Oxford, served up an ace opening at South Moreton primary school, near Didcot, by planting trees with the children as part of the opening ceremony.\n\nThe new building had cost £380,000.\n\nThe tree-planting exercise coincided with the school’s International Day, with parents interested in sending their children to the school invited to visit and talk to teachers.\n\nMr Henman retired from tennis the previous year, and is now a familiar face on the BBC’s coverage of Wimbledon."
