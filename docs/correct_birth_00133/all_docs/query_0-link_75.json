Born Lincoln County, Ny according to Civil War discharge certificate. But I have learned there is no Lincoln County Ny. But since this county and Township is close to Manlius, Onondaga Co., Ny where his father and my GGgmo Louisa HILLS where married I was hoping that Licklean was pronounced Lincoln in those days and that my SANDERS / SAUNDERS roots are here. I'm at the proverbiable brick wall on my GGgfa and birth location of his son Joel Cornelius SANDERS. My GGgfa was Wm Charles SANDERS / SAUNDERS as he always claimed. He supposedly was raised by Indians and spoke the tongue fluently. GGgfa married Louisa HILLS of Truxton Cortland Co., Ny abt 1830 in Manlius, Onondaga Co. Ny. She is buried Waterloo. Black Hawk County, Iowa. She was in Green county Wisc and then Iowa. I have not found Wm Charles SANDERS yet.\n\nCHURCH\n\nCynthia Power Tue Mar 12 08:15:58 2002\n\nMy family is from Smithville (Tyner)/Oxford.

Part of the census was missing at the top so I could not determine what column was what. This was on ancestry.com. Don't think it was there fault it was condition of the census. I suspect that this could be my GGgfa Wm Charles SANDERS (he was b. abt 1810) who married my GGgmo Louisa HILLS in Manlius, Onondaga Co., in abt 1830. In looking at the map for this web site I see that Truxton, Cortland Co. is just aways over the line from Lincklaen. The point being my GGgmo was born in Truxton.\n\nGGgfa always claimed name was SAUNDERS and I see quite a few SAUNDERS buried in Lincklaen. Does anyone know anything about this Wm SANDERS?.\n\nDIBBLE - DANIELS - CLARK\n\nRea Trotter Sun Mar 17 20:06:37 2002\n\nCharles DIBBLE m. Lovina (MN unknown).
