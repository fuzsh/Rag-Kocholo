        "text": "Tim Henman is a British professional tennis player.\n\nHe was the first male player from the United Kingdom since Roger Taylor in the 1970s to reach the semi-finals of the Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship. Henman never reached the finals of any Grand Slam but reached six Grand Slam semi-finals and won 15 career ATP titles (11 in singles and 4 in doubles), including the Paris Masters in 2003. Also, he scored 40 wins and 14 losses with the Great Britain Davis Cup team.\n\nHenman was ranked British number 1 in 1996 and from 1999 to 2005, from which point he was succeeded by Andy Murray. He reached a career high ranking of World No. 4 during three different periods between July 2002 and October 2004. He is one of Britain's most successful open era male tennis players.\n\nThroughout his career, Henman was a noted grass specialist, only becoming truly comfortable on clay and hard court near the end of his career, when in 2004 he reached the semi-finals in both the French and US Open. The year 2005 began a decline for Henman, and from that year on-wards he never managed to pass through the third round in a Grand Slam tournament. Henman retired from professional tennis in late 2007, but he remains active in the ATP Champions Tour (a tour for former professional tennis players)."
