        "text": "“It’s like when I practise with Andy on Centre yesterday, he’s helping me, and vice versa when I hit with Arthur Ferry today.”\n\nEvans, who meets French player Quentin Halys - ranked 85th in the world - on Tuesday in the first rlound, dismissed any suggestion that he had aimed his comments at his fellow Brits, adding: “I've never made it personal towards anybody. I'm not singling people out.”\n\nHis comments have been backed by Liam Broady, the Stockport-born man who reached the third round last year at SW19.\n\nThe world No 147, facing France’s Constant Lestienne on Monday in the first round, said: “I support Dan completely. It’s a middle-to-upper class sport here and needs to become more accessible for different backgrounds.”"
