A fantastic piece of signed Tennis memorabilia from one of the best british players ever. 100% authentic and signed in person, supplied with a Coa. It is framed and ready to hang on the wall.\n\nTim Henman Bibliography.\n\nTimothy Henry Henman OBE was born 6 September 1974 and is a British retired professional tennis player. He played a serve-and-volley style of tennis. He was the first male player from the United Kingdom since Roger Taylor in the 1970s to reach the semi-finals of the Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship. He never reached the finals of any Grand Slam but reached six Grand Slam semi-finals and won 15 career ATP titles (11 in singles and four in doubles), including the Paris Masters in 2003. Also, he scored 40 wins and 14 losses with the Great Britain Davis Cup team. He was ranked British number 1 in 1996 and again from 1999 to 2005, from which point he was succeeded by Andy Murray.\n\nHe reached a career high ranking of World No. 4 during three different periods between July 2002 and October 2004.He is one of Britain's most successful open era tennis players, winning $11,635,542 prize money. In the 2004 New Year Honours, he was appointed an OBE.\n\nHe started playing tennis before the age of three, and began systematic training in the Slater Squad at eleven. After suffering a serious injury which affected him for the better part of two years, he began touring internationally as a junior and achieved some successes. He rose quickly up the ATP rankings, and by 1996 had reached the quarter-finals of the Wimbledon Championships.\n\nThroughout his career, he was a noted grass specialist, only becoming truly comfortable on clay and hard court near the end of his career, when in 2004 he reached the semi-finals in both the French and US Open.\n\nFrom 2005 onwards he began a decline and from that year onwards he never managed to pass through the third round in a Grand Slam tournament. He retired from professional tennis in late 2007, but he remains active in the ATP Champions Tour.\n\nA lovely piece of signed Tennis Memorabilia, a must for any collector of Tim Henman signed tennis memorabilia.
