        "text": "\"It will be a great tournament,\" he said in an interview at the BBC in London. \"Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have improved their game by a phenomenal extent. Roger Federer was once way out in front, but those guys are on his heels. There has never been three players like this for such a long time: playing at the level they are and being so consistent.\"\n\nHenman believes that this formidable trio will be pushed by a pack of strong players. \"Those three are the favourites but then you have a group behind and Andy Murray is among them,\" he said. \"There is also Ivo Karlovic, Andy Roddick, Lleyton Hewitt, David Nalbandian, Richard Gasquet . . . \"\n\nHe applauds the quality at the top. Djokovic has already won a grand slam title by lifting the Australian Open earlier this year. But Henman has the highest praise for the two leading lights of the men's game. \"Federer and Nadal have taken the game into a new territory and that is the challenge ahead for those guys who are behind them: they must improve, step up to the challenge. For me, Federer is the best, most complete player that has ever played. He is certainly the best I ever played. Nadal is the best claycourt player ever. Ever. It is an unbelievable generation.\"\n\nHenman, who has a 6-7 win/loss match record against Federer, rates the Swiss champion even above Pete Sampras, the American who won seven Wimbledon titles and 14 grand slam crowns. \"Yeah, no doubt,\" he confirms. \"I was up 6-1 in matches against Federer at one stage. The secret is to play them when they are young . . . about eight or nine,\" he adds dryly.\n\nBut who will win Wimbledon? \"If someone gave me a tenner, I would put it out Federer,\" he said. \"But what Nadal has done is phenomenal. To play the best claycourt match I have ever seen the French final against Federer and then three days later come to grass the Stella Artois at Queen's and play with that passion, as if his life depended on it, and then win the trophy . . . it speaks volumes for him as a player and as a person.\"\n\nHenman also believes Murray has the quality to win a major and could pose a threat over the two weeks of the championship.\n\n\"He has to improve in lots of areas,\" says Henman of the 21-year-old from Dunblane. \"But this is the exciting thing: he can do that. When you see the clips of him playing his best, the potential is there. He needs to have more consistency with his serve. He can be a little bit more proactive, more aggressive with his shots. His forehand and backhand are technically so sound, I think he could go for it more. Physically, he is getting better; he is much stronger.\"\n\nMurray, of course, is inheriting the mantle of great British hope from Henman. The Englishman insisted, though, that he always enjoyed Wimbledon and felt under no extra pressure. He is determined, too, to \"have fun\" with his new role as a commentator.\n\nHe said: \"Hopefully, given my experiences of Wimbledon I will be able to portray what the tournament is about. I can also give an educated opinion of what Andy, in particular, is going through. And that will be interesting.\"\n\nHenman also declared that he would have no qualms about speaking out. \"I feel much more comfortable about speaking freely about lots of different issues now I am no longer playing, whether it is the press, the LTA, players or the weather. The public will see a different side of me,\" he said."
