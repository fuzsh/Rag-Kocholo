        "text": "At least one British player will reach the second round of the US Open, which begins at Flushing Meadows next Monday, with Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski having been drawn together in the opening round. A few years ago it would have caused a considerable stir but yesterday all eyes were on Andy Murray, the 19-year-old British No1, who for the first time in his career is seeded for a grand slam, having risen to a career-high 19th in the world rankings this week.\n\nHe will play a qualifier in the first round, with his first major obstacle likely to be in the third round against the hard-hitting Fernando González of Chile, the No10 seed, who reached the semi-finals of the last two Masters series events in Toronto and Cincinnati. The two have played each other only once, and that was indoors in Basle last year with González winning 6-4, 3-6, 6-1.\n\nThe American Larry Stefanki, who previously coached Henman, is currently guiding the Chilean, and to good effect. Stefanki was linked to Murray before Brad Gilbert became the Scot's coach and he has already curbed some of the Chilean's wilder tendencies, turning him into a more complete all-court player.\n\nWhile Henman and Rusedski may have greeted the draw with a wry smile, there would be more of a grimace when they realised that their second-round opponent is almost certain to be the world No1, Roger Federer, who opens up against Yeu-Tzuoo Wang of Chinese Taipei. Henman is one of the few players to hold a career advantage over the Swiss, although he has lost their last four meetings.\n\nThe rivalry between Henman and Rusedski first began at national level in Telford, with their first ATP Tour confrontation coming 10 years ago in Ostrava. Since then they have played each other nine times, with Henman holding a 7-2 lead and having won their last six encounters.\n\nOnly once have they previously played each other in a slam and that was in the third round of the Australian Open four years ago when Henman was again the winner. Rusedski, who suffered a hip injury just before this year's Wimbledon, had not won a match since the Italian Open in May prior to this week. However, despite his own lack of form, Henman will be the overwhelming favourite to win what may be their last match against each other.\n\nRusedski will be 33 on September 6, the same day that Henman is 32, and although he has not said when he will retire his ranking dropped this week to No138 which, unless he suddenly picks up a multitude of points in the remainder of this year, would leave him having to qualify for all the major events next year. Rusedski's courage and resilience must never be underestimated, but the end of the road may come this year.\n\nSpain's Rafael Nadal, the world No2, who has faced Federer in the finals of the last two slams, winning at Roland Garros and losing at Wimbledon, has a potentially awkward opening match against Mark Philippoussis. The huge Australian, a wild card, was runner-up to Pat Rafter at Flushing Meadows in 1998, and although his form is virtually non-existent, he retains the power to cause an early upset.\n\nAndre Agassi, like Federer the winner of eight slams, has said he will retire after the tournament and plays Romania's Andre Pavel in the first round. If he gets through that test, he may meet the fast-rising Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus, who is seeded No8.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2002 the Williams sisters dominated the US Open, each winning the title twice. This year Venus is seeded No30, while the injury-prone Serena, outside the world's top 50, is a wild card. The latter is in the same quarter as France's Amélie Mauresmo, the world No1 and reigning Australian Open and Wimbledon champion, and Martina Hingis of Switzerland who are seeded to meet in the quarter-finals. Venus is in the same section as the Russian pair Elena Dementieva and Svetlana Kuznetsova, the 2004 champion.\n\nThe No2 seed Justine Henin-Hardenne of Belgium appears to have a relatively easy path to the quarter-finals where she could meet the No7 seed Patty Schnyder. Henin's first-round opponent is the Italian Elena Camerin.\n\nFull draw on www.theguardian.com/sport\n\nHead-to-head\n\nTim Henman GB\n\nAge 31\n\nBorn Oxford, England\n\nBirthday September 6\n\nHeight 6ft 1in\n\nTurned pro 1991\n\nCareer prize money $11.4m\n\nWorld ranking 62\n\nBest ranking 4 (Aug 2002)\n\nGrand slam titles 0\n\nGrand slam finals 0\n\nATP Tour titles 11\n\nWife Lucy\n\nGreg Rusedski GB\n\nAge 32\n\nBorn Montreal, Canada\n\nBirthday September 6\n\nHeight 6ft 4in\n\nTurned pro 1993\n\nCareer prize money $8.9m\n\nWorld ranking 138\n\nBest ranking 4 (June 1997)\n\nGrand slam titles 0\n\nGrand slam finals 1\n\nATP Tour titles 15\n\nWife Lucy\n\nPrevious meetings\n\nHenman leads 7-2\n\n1996 Ostrava (Carpet) Henman 7-6 7-5\n\n1997 Vienna (Carpet) Rusedski 6-4 6-4\n\n1998 Hanover (Hard) Rusedski 6-2 6-4\n\n1999 Indian Wells (Hard) Henman 6-4 2-6 6-4\n\n2001 Adelaide (Hard) Henman 6-2 7-6\n\n2002 Adelaide (Hard) Henman 6-4 6-4\n\n2002 Australian Open (Hard) Henman 6-4 6-3 6-1\n\n2005 Dubai (Hard) Henman 4-6 7-6 6-4"
