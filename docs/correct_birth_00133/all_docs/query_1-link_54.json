        "text": "TIM HENMAN admits he is on a knife-edge as he prepares once more to conquer Wimbledon.\n\nThis could be the year Tiger Tim finally takes the title ... or ends up quitting the sport.\n\nHe once again goes into the tournament as Britain's best hope of claiming the men's singles crown, a burden he has long carried.\n\nBut he knows that, now he has turned 30, time is rapidly running out on him fulfilling his dream. As it does, Britain's best tennis player for 70 years says bowing out of the sport he has graced could be only a snap decision away.\n\n''It might be. I might wake up tomorrow and think...'' said Henman. \"It will be something that perhaps comes over time. But I don't know because I haven't retired before, I don't know what the process will be.\n\n\"It's a very personal thing. As I said, I might wake up one morning and just say, 'That's it, I'm done'.\n\n\"Or I might just want to play 10 tournaments a year.\n\n\"I have spoken to people about Pete Sampras and after winning a tournament he just decided 'That's it, I'm done'.\n\n\"Sometimes that is the best way to bow out.\"\n\nHenman's thoughts on his future are not meant to alarm his army of SW19 fans, or undermine his 12th attempt at taking the crown he craves most of all.\n\nThey are just a realistic appraisal that, with his 31st birthday coming up in September, time waits for no man - not even a four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist and national sporting hero.\n\nWhich is why his mind sometimes wanders to the day when he is finished with the demanding tennis circuit. \"Yeah, absolutely. When I play golf for a couple of days I sometimes think I'd love to go away for a couple of weeks and just play golf,\" said Henman.\n\n\"But then it only takes me a split second to remember that I love what I do, I want to compete and that there's more things to achieve.'\n\n\"So I want to commit everything I've got, all my energies, to my career right now.\n\n\"I don't know how many more opportunities I'm going to have.\n\n\"There are not going to be endless opportunities, are there?\n\n\"It is getting harder to stay fit and healthy and that's a big issue. I've had a few problems with my back and my shoulder, but if I stay healthy, there's no reason why I can't play for two, three, four or maybe five more years.\n\n\"Andre Agassi is 35 and he's still playing some good tennis - and he's played a hell of a lot longer than I have.\"\n\nIt's clear that, despite the thoughts about packing in that sometimes creep into Henman's mind, he does not think 2005 is his last Wimbledon chance - and he firmly believes he has become a better player.\n\nA best campaign last year, when he reached the semi-finals of both the French and US Opens and the quarters at Wimbledon, backs up that claim.\n\nHe's still in love with the game, still determined to put in the hours on the practice court and in the gym - and optimistic he can be Britain's first Wimbledon men's finalist since Bunny Austin in 1938. The fact that Henman reckons he hasn't played well at Wimbledon for THREE years, yet still reached the last two quarters, has lifted his confidence.\n\nBut after all these years, does he still get the same big buzz at the tournament?\n\n\"If it gets to a stage where I am out on a practice court or I'm in the gym and I think 'I don't want to do this', then I'll stop.\n\n\"Because I know that without 100 per cent commitment, I will not be able to match the standards that are out there. I will not do anything half-heartedly.\n\n\"I play this game and I'm lucky that it's my hobby, I love to do it. If that wasn't the case, then it's time to stop.\n\n\"But I just don't see that happening for a few years yet.\"\n\nHowever, Henman knows, better than anyone, that he will ALWAYS be judged on his performance over this next frantic fortnight.\n\nHe said: \"If, at the end of my career, the semis at Wimbledon is the best I've done, then that's as good as I was.\n\n\"Would I be disappointed if I didn't win Wimbledon? Yeah. But I don't necessarily think that's a failure as such.\n\n\"Just because I want to win it that badly, it doesn't actually guarantee me anything.\"\n\nWimbledon 2005 is the 150th Grand Slam of the Open era.\n\n\"That would be a nice one to win,\" added Henman, with a smile.\n\nAnd so say all of us.\n\nSTATATTACK\n\nTIM HENMAN\n\nAGE 31\n\nBORN Oxford (6.9.1974)\n\nTURNED PRO 1993\n\nHIGHEST SINGLES WORLD RANKING No.4 (July 2002)\n\nCURRENT WORLD RANKING No.9\n\nWIMBLEDON RANKING No.6\n\nSINGLES TITLES WON/LOST\n\n11/16 1994\n\nGRAND SLAM RECORD:\n\nAustralian 3rd RND; French SF; Wimbledon QF; US SF\n\nWIMBLEDON RECORD\n\n1994 1st Rnd\n\n1995 2nd Rnd\n\n1996 QF\n\n1997 QF\n\n1998 SF\n\n1999 SF2000 4th Rnd\n\n2001 SF\n\n2002 SF\n\n2003 QF\n\n2004 QF"
