        "text": "Mr Henman, who grew up in Weston-on-the-Green, went to the Dragon School and played tennis for Oxfordshire as a schoolboy, became Ms Raducanu’s unofficial “courtside cheerleader” during her run to the title in his role as a pundit for Amazon Prime.\n\nMs Raducanu even singled out the former Wimbledon and US Open semi-finalist as an inspiration in her victory speech following her win over Canadian teenager Leylah Fernandez in the final.\n\nBut Mr Henman played down his part in her success, adding: “I’ve done very little. I’ve been courtside cheerleader. I think that is about the maximum.\n\n“But I feel very lucky to be part of the Prime team here in New York and therefore I’ve been courtside for every match, the best seat in the house, to see her and the way she has played and this fairytale run.\n\n“And fairytale runs don’t always end with a victory and that’s what’s happened. I think I’m still slightly in shock so I dread to think how she feels.”\n\nKent teenager Ms Raducanu took New York by storm as she came from nowhere to win the title, the first qualifier in history to claim a grand slam crown.\n\nThe 18-year-old is also the first British woman to win a major singles title since Virginia Wade at Wimbledon in 1977, and Mr Henman believes she will go on to win many more.\n\nSpeaking on Radio Four’s Today programme, Henman said: “What’s been astonishing is how she’s taken it in her stride, at 18 years of age.\n\n“She’s the real deal, and she’s going to win more of these events in the future, I’m convinced. She’s going to be a superstar in this sport and an incredible role model for young girls and young children.”"
