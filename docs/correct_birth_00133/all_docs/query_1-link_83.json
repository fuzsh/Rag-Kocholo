        "text": "Andy Murray yesterday recalled the win that made him a national hero and said: \"I was just happy to wake up and find it wasn't a dream.\"\n\nThe British No1, who fought back from the brink of defeat to an epic victory against Frenchman Richard Gasquet at Wimbledon on Monday, said: \"I think it may be a real turning point in my career and for me at Wimbledon.\n\n\"The crowd really lifted me when I was behind and the roar when I went ahead was just amazing.\"\n\nToday the gutsy 21-year-old Scot - seeded No12 - plays the match of his life in a fierce quarter final battle with No2 seed Rafael Nadal.\n\nIf he wins a semi-final place he will equal former favourite Tim Henman.\n\nMurraymania has already broken out since his win - ticket prices for today's clash soared to £2,500 and queues of fans camped out overnight for the chance to see him in action.\n\nMurray Mount - the grassy bank once known as Henman Hill - will erupt as the Centre Court action is shown on a giant TV screen. Girlfriend Kim Sears, 20, his mum Judy and 15,000 spectators will cheer him on. Andy had a 45-minute session on the All England Club practice courts yesterday, looking relaxed during rallies with his coach and bantering loudly with Spanish player Feliciano Lopez as crowds enjoyed the entertainment.\n\nLopez shouted: \"You served like an animal.\" Andy smirked and replied: \"I served like you.\"\n\nHis brother Jamie, the British doubles No1, met him at around midday to talk things through.\n\nJamie, 22, said: \"We had a good chat. He's doing really well.\"\n\nAndy raked in £93,750 for his last match and will increase it to £187,500 if he wins today.\n\nHis supporters, known as Team Murray, will be rooting for more blistering 136mph serves and textbook volleys. Punters are expected to flood bookies with bets totalling £10million, with odds of 3-1 to beat Nadal.\n\nLadbrokes' David Williams said: \"Fans have gone potty for him. Every match he wins brings us closer to our nightmare of a massive payout.\"\n\nInternet ticket sales went through the roof. Eric Baker, of website Viagogo, said: \"When Murray won we got flooded.\n\n\"This has been the hottest ticket we've ever seen for Wimbledon - and it's not even the final.\"\n\nFans flocked as Andy signed autographs. Student Peach Everard, 21, said: \"I never fancied Andy Murray before but now look at those biceps.\n\n\"He's a lot sexier since he ramped up his fitness training. And his tennis is great - Nadal should watch out.\"\n\nTracy Quigley, 46, of Earlsfield in South West London, who has sons aged 14 and 16, said: \"Murray mania has taken my family by storm. My sons never had any interest in tennis but now they really want to play.\"\n\nKate Wright, 20, of Oxford, said: \"My mates are loving Murray now. We'll be shouting our heads off.\" Student Alice Bailey-Kennedy, 20, said: \"His grit and determination make you want to shout your lungs off for him.\"\n\nMURRAY'S PUPPY IS STUNG BY WASP\n\nAndy Murray's victory against Richard Gasquet had a sting in the tail yesterday. Or rather the leg, as his beloved puppy was attacked by a wasp.\n\nMurray was in training for today's clash with Spaniard Rafael Nadal when border terrier Maggie yelped as she was stung.\n\nHis mother Judy said: \"She's not very well, she got stung by a wasp and she's a little bit poorly. She's going to the vets, so that's a bit of a distraction for Andy.\"\n\nMurray's girlfriend Kim Sears, 20, made the trip to the vets and the pup was spotted later leaving the surgery with one leg swathed in a blue bandage.\n\nMaggie May, named after the Rod Stewart song, has been credited with aiding Murray's more laid-back approach during this tournament. Judy said: \"Andy's really chilled and it's showing on the court. He wants to play with the puppy all the time.\""
