        "text": "Yes: Stephen Bierly\n\nTwo years ago, when both Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon only to be utterly crushed by Michael Stich and CÃ©dric Pioline respectively, the belief of many was that if Britain was ever to produce a champion to equal Fred Perry then he had yet to be born.\n\nBut later that year Rusedski surprised everyone by reaching the final of the US Open. Then, a year ago, Henman made it through to the semi-finals at Wimbledon.\n\nThe British press, unused to such riches, continually rush back to the record books to churn out their \"not since\" paragraphs, as if the success of Rusedski and Henman had any relevance to the past. It hasn't.\n\nHere are two players, one home-grown, the other having chosen to live in Britain, who have proved their excellence in an age when the competition in the men's game, at least as regards sheer depth, has never been greater.\n\nIt is no fluke that Henman is currently ranked sixth in the world and Rusedski 12th. They are world-class players, and if Henman is criticised for lacking concentration, and Rusedski chastised for not being able to produce a consistent top-spin backhand, it is because they are being evaluated at the highest level.\n\nHenman, the product of an English middle-class family with a tennis heritage, has dreamed of being Wimbledon champion, perhaps almost believed it to be his sporting destiny. Rusedski, waving a passport of convenience, came to England from Canada because his game was ideally suited to grass and here was the opportunity to make his name and fortune.\n\nIrrespective of any arguments concerning their individual talent, or mental capabilities, the fact that they are playing on grass and in front of their home supporters gives them a tremendous advantage.\n\nRusedski's serve is at its most poten,t and Henman's ease on the surface allows him those extra few milliseconds which, coupled with his range of shots, can be enough to unhinge all but the best.\n\nRusedski's need to win within the next two years is the more pressing, for the back remains a long-term doubt and his serve is bound to lose its authority. His on-court poise and his relaxed but totally focused demeanour off court carry echoes of his run to the US Open. His concentration appears absolute.\n\nBut, as Pete Sampras has said, there are no guarantees. As yet Henman has failed to get to any major final, and Rusedski lost at Flushing Meadows when it mattered the most to Australia's Pat Rafter.\n\nSince they reached the last eight in 1997 the expectations have increased enormously. \"But I won't be going out thinking about the nation's hopes. I'll be playing for myself,\" said Henman.\n\nRusedski, who had a Union Jack bandana in 1995 when he made his first appearance at Wimbledon as a fully fledged Briton, is always more likely to wear patriotism on his sleeve but is equally self-centred when it comes to winning.\n\nSo can one of them win? \"Absolutely,\"says Henman. \"Of course,\" says Rusedski.\n\nFor the first time in more than 60 years there is a real reason to believe a British player can become the Wimbledon champion.\n\nAnd that, in itself, takes some believing.\n\nNo: Paul Weaver\n\nThe Greek philosopher Diogenes used to beg money from statues and explain to bewildered onlookers that he was practising disappointment. Today he would paint \"Tim\" or \"Greg\" on his face and visit the green acres of London SW19.\n\nBritish tennis fans have become adept at practising disappointment. When you have not produced a winner since Fred Perry in 1936, and when the last British player to reach the final, Bunny Austin, is 92 and in a wheelchair, you qualify for a doctorate in frustrated hope. So it will not be too painful when Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski once again fail to lift the trophy this year.\n\nThis is not to say that they are not good enough to win, because they manifestly are. But for one who has watched these championships since the heady days of Buster Mottram, John Feaver and John \"Legs\" Lloyd, since when it feels that the union flag has been bleached to a flag of truce under countless suns, such an outcome defeats the imagination in straight sets.\n\nThis may sound unduly pessimistic, and perhaps it is. But it is more than that. Henman and Rusedski are not only up against the grim countenance of history this week; they are up against Pete Sampras.\n\nPistol Pete is lined up to knock Rusedski out in the quarter-finals before disposing of Henman in the semis.\n\nThe wise whispers over punnet and Pimm's say that Sampras is not playing well. Maybe so. But he has still won three matches without dropping a set, and when you have won the title five times you know when to disengage cruise control.\n\nThe records of the two British players against Sampras are not encouraging. He has beaten Henman five times out of five, including two Wimbledon wins in 1995 and 1998. In those five matches Henman has won a single set. In seven matches against Rusedski the American has won six times, including a straight-sets victory in their only meeting at Wimbledon four years ago. It is difficult to read much into Rusedski's solitary triumph on carpet in the Paris Indoor last year.\n\nBut even if Sampras is overcome, the bottom half of the draw looks certain to throw up a formidable finalist. Richard Krajicek has fallen but Pat Rafter and Andre Agassi both present fatal possibilities.\n\nAgassi is enjoying his best Wimbledon form since he won in 1992. The courts are hard, as they were then, and the extra bounce suits his pugilistic, counter-punching baseline game. Once again he is hitting the ball devilishly early and hard, and he is fired up after his victory in Paris.\n\nRafter is another who has benefited from the conditions. On turgid surfaces the Australian's kick-serve sits up with a \"please hit me\" invitation but on courts such as these the extra bounce makes it a potent weapon and suits his volleying game.\n\nMeanwhile the faults of the British players are all too evident. Rusedski's groundstrokes need even further improvement and so do the chips and blocks of his backhand return of serve. Henman is still the more impressive all-round player but he does not get enough first serves in and his second serve can be vulnerable. He is a creative, inspirational player, one whose moods cover a wide arc. He can beat anyone on his day, but consistency over two weeks can be difficult for him.\n\nSo can either of them win it? In a word, no."
