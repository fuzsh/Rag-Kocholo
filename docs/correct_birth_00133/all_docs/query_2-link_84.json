        "text": "The beauty now is that I have normal weekends. Playing the tennis circuit, I travelled so much for so long, that being at home is now one of my favourite things.\n\nFor a perfect start to the weekend, my wife Lucy and I would have a group of friends around for a dinner, drinks and a good chat. It'll be a mix of my friends, her friends and people we've met locally. We moved to south Oxfordshire nearly five years ago, and have met a lot of really great people, mostly through the kids. We've got kids at the same school and are in the same boat.\n\nMy wife will cook, because I can't, and she's really good at it. I love a rack of lamb with a good bottle of red wine. I only cook if we barbecue. We've got a great butcher nearby in a village called Cholsey who does an excellent butterfly of beef. I love red meat.\n\nI'm always in charge of booze. I used to enjoy the occasional beer or glass of wine when I played professionally, but now I can have two or three more. That's a reflection of my whole life. Since I've stopped playing there's been an amazing sense of freedom. I love it.\n\nIdeally, I'd have a lie-in on Saturday morning, but with three small children that's not going to happen. I've got three girls. Rosie is nearly seven, Olivia is four-and-a-half, and Grace is 20 months. If the first sound is at 7am, that's pretty good going. Weekends usually mean ferrying the kids around to swimming pools and birthday parties, and playing with them. They like riding their bikes, playing in the Wendy house, climbing trees and playing hide and seek.\n\nOn a perfect weekend they'll be dropped off with friends and I'll get a game of golf in while my wife takes the dogs and rides her horses on the Ridgeway. She's got a couple of horses in livery at a stable up there. Our dogs are two black Labradors, Bonnie and Bumble, who are mother and daughter. They're very good and love their walks.\n\nI don't ride – I'm scared of horses. Golf is my passion now. I sometimes play in tournaments at Huntercombe and Sunningdale courses, and sometimes with friends – quite often with the golfer Sam Torrance. He's good enough for me! I'm getting there – my handicap is one. Hopefully with a couple more tournaments I'll be down to scratch.\n\nIf we've had a big night on Friday, we'll get a babysitter and go to our village pub – The Sweet Olive – on Saturday evening with six or so friends. It's walking distance, they've got a great menu and the food is delicious.\n\nUnlike everyone else, it seems, we never buy newspapers on a Sunday morning. I haven't bought a newspaper for 15 years. It was a conscious decision when I was playing never to read anything, positive or negative. Before that, I'd read something about myself that was just pure fiction, and I'd think \"where on earth have they dreamt that up from?\" Then I'd turn the page and read something about someone else and say to myself \"wow, that's amazing!\" then say \"hang on a minute, if it's not true about me, why is it true about them?\" So I gave up reading papers.\n\nSunday morning will be spent playing with the kids. Sunday lunch is always pretty social. My two brothers and my parents all live quite close, and my wife's family is in Hampshire so that's not too far away. Sunday is a good time for uncles and grandparents to come around and have a big roast.\n\nOn Sunday evening we'll kick everyone out and my wife and I will sit down and have a quiet time. We'll probably feel we've eaten too much over the weekend, so we'll just have scrambled eggs on toast and watch a film. We really enjoyed The Notebook recently.\n\nIf we watch television, it will always be sport. Lucy doesn't mind sport but doesn't watch it like me. She'll often be busy emailing friends, doing admin for her horses, but mostly getting ready for the kids' school week. With three kids, it's always pretty busy!\n\nTim Henman is an ambassador for the HSBC road to Wimbledon National 14 & Under challenge www.wimbledon.org\n\nMY FAVOURITE THINGS\n\nFamily: my wife and three children\n\nMy Labradors, Bonnie and Bumble\n\nWine, particularly champagne\n\nMy golf clubs\n\nSunshine, just being outside in it"
