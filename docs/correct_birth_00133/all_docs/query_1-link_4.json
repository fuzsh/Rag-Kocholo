        "text": "Tim Henman was born in Oxford in 1974 and began playing tennis on his parents' court aged two. He left school after GCSEs to go on the world junior tennis circuit, and he turned professional in 1993. He will be playing at this year's Wimbledon, which starts on Monday. He is married with two children and lives in Oxfordshire.\n\nWhat is your idea of perfect happiness?\n\nA weekend at home with my family.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nIll health.\n\nWhich living person do you most admire and why?\n\nBono, for the impact he's had on both his industry and the rest of the world.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nImpatience - and unsolicited advice.\n\nWhat has been your most embarrassing moment?\n\nIn 1995, when I was disqualified from Wimbledon for accidentally hitting a ball girl on the ear.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nI am not really materialistic, but I'd probably choose our home.\n\nWho would play you in a movie of your life?\n\nPierce Brosnan.\n\nWhat is your most unappealing habit?\n\nEating too quickly.\n\nWhat is your favourite book?\n\nThere's a very limited number to pick from: it would have to be Harry Potter.\n\nCat or dog?\n\nDog. We have two black labradors and a cat, but the dogs get the nod.\n\nWhat is your guiltiest pleasure?\n\nMy wine cellar. I don't know that much about wine - the only thing I know for sure is that I like the taste.\n\nWhat do you owe your parents?\n\nIn some respects, everything.\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse?\n\n'Yes' - I should learn to say no more often, so I'd get more time at home.\n\nWhat is your greatest regret?\n\nWhen it rained during my 2001 Wimbledon semi-final.\n\nWhen and where were you happiest?\n\nThe days our daughters were born.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest achievement?\n\nWhen I was number four in the world.\n\nWhat is the most important lesson life has taught you?\n\nPerspective - my job is important but, at the end of the day, it's a game. The health and happiness of my family is what really matters."
