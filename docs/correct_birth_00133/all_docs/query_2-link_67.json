He was the first player from the united kingdom since roger taylor in the 1970s to reach the semi-finals of the wimbledon men's singles championship. Henman never reached the finals of any grand slam but reached six grand slam semifinals and won 15 career atp titles (11 in singles and four in doubles) including the paris masters in 2003. He reached the ranking of world number four and was one of britain's most successful open era male tennis players.\n\nI am U.A.C.C member 881 (universal autograph collectors club) and registered dealer 0095 with A.F.T.A.L (autograph fair trade association ltd) and abide by their rules and ethics."
