        "text": "Tennis icon Federer was defeated in the fourth round at Flushing Meadows, and fans were stunned to see the usually ice-cool competitor struggling with the heat.\n\n‘The Fed Express’ was derailed by John Millman, and afterwards the 37-year-old stated that he was unable to get any air whilst playing.\n\nTemperatures soared to 30C as Federer crashed out of the tournament.\n\nIn his post-match interview, Federer explained that he was struggling to breathe on court.\n\n“One of those nights where I felt I couldn't get air. There was no circulation at all. For some reason I just struggled in the conditions. It’s one of the first times it’s happened to me.” Federer stated.\n\n“It’s uncomfortable. Clearly you just keep on sweating more and more and more and more as the match goes on. You lose energy as it goes by.”\n\nThese comments came as a shock to Henman, who suggested that a rule change could be brought in to counter incidents like these.\n\n“When you hear the dialogue that's coming from the players and someone like Federer saying he got to the stage where he was happy the match was over, then that raises alarm bells for me,” Henman explained.\n\n\"I've always been against the heat rule because I feel the physicality is an important part of a player's armoury, and the ones that have prepared better, trained better, will reap the rewards.”\n\nThe 2018 US Open was one of the most eventful grand slams in living memory, with arguments about umpiring, clothing and the way tennis copes with extreme heat.\n\nThis year’s US Open was the first time an extreme heat policy had been introduced by the US Tennis Association.\n\nThe policy stated that male players can request a 10-minute break in-between the third and fourth set, whilst female players can request a break after the second set.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
