        "text": "Nick Kyrgios and Tim Henman playfully insinuated that Novak Djokovic might have intentionally allowed Jacob Fearnley a chance to recover in their match to ensure Andy Murray secured a prime television spot.\n\nDjokovic swiftly took a two-set advantage over Britain's world No. 277 Fearnley at Centre Court on Thursday.\n\nYet, the Serbian seemed to falter as he conceded the third set 7-5 and appeared to struggle in the fourth.\n\nDjokovic was the opening act on the main show court, with the Murray brothers scheduled for the third doubles match of the day.\n\nSimultaneously, on Court 1, British No. 1s were battling it out, reports the Express.\n\nHarriet Dart triumphed in an epic encounter against Katie Boulter, while Jack Draper was entering the court to face Cameron Norrie.\n\nThis sequence of events led Kyrgios and Henman to speculate whether Djokovic was intentionally prolonging his match to avoid clashing with the Brits' games on Court 1.\n\nBBC presenter Clare Balding commented, \"Listen, the schedulers are relieved if that happens because what we don't want is the Murray brothers playing doubles at the same time as Cam Norrie is playing Jack Draper,\".\n\nTo which Kyrgios remarked, \"Maybe Novak knows that deep down. Maybe he does.\"\n\nHenman chimed in, \"He's almost trying to help the tournament, he's a member of the club.\"\n\nKyrgios then probed Henman about securing a membership, typically reserved for Wimbledon champions.\n\n\"When can I be a member? \" the Australian enquired.\n\n\"I'm working on it. I've got some pull around here but not that much,\" Henman responded with a chuckle."
