        "text": "A visibly emotional Tim Henman has led tributes to the much-loved journalist Mick Dickson, who tragically passed away aged 59 while covering the Australian Open.\n\nDickson - who was less than two weeks away from celebrating his 60th birthday on January 27 - spent 33 years working for the Daily Mail after joining the newspaper in 1990. He initially served as the Mail's cricket correspondent before switching to tennis in 2007 - and he was in Melbourne covering the first Grand Slam of 2024.\n\nHenman, the former British No.1, was working as a pundit for Eurosport and, with his voice cracking, said: \"It's incredibly sad that he passed away in Melbourne. He was a great friend of the tennis community and our thoughts go out to his family.\"\n\nThe devastating news was announced via a social media post on behalf of the family. It read: \"We are devastated to announce that our wonderful husband and Dad, Mike, has collapsed and died while in Melbourne for the Aus Open. For 38 years he lived his dream covering sport all over the world. He was a truly great man and we will miss him terribly. Lucy, Sam, Ruby and Joe.\"\n\nCurrent player Liam Broady wrote on social media: \"Don't know what to say. A strong, good and fair man. Cared about me when I was at my lowest ebb. Rest well Mike.\" Former player Laura Robson said: \"Truly devastating news. Can't believe it. All my thoughts with Mike's family.\"\n\nFormer British No. 1 Anne Keothavong added: \"Truly awful news. Thoughts are with his family during this devastating time.\" Ex-player turned coach Jamie Delgado said: \"RIP Mike. Awful awful news and shocked. The tennis world will be devastated and we will miss you. A legend of tennis journalism. RIP.\"\n\nLee Clayton, the Mail's global publisher for sport, added: \"Dicko was everything you want a correspondent to be – a brilliant news hound, a terrific writer and a friend to so many in his sport.\n\n\"The world of tennis will join us in mourning. He was a giant of a journalist. It will be an impossibly difficult time for us all as we digest this huge loss.\n\n\"Dicko was a magnificent tennis correspondent, but he would also turn his hand to any sport, especially cricket, golf and football, and support colleagues across our team in any challenge, always in such a generous manner. He was just a brilliant bloke, a class act. It was a privilege to work alongside him and to know him.\"\n\nThe Daily Mirror's Mike Walters and Andy Dunn also paid tribute to Dickson. \"Shaken to the core and shattered - 'Dicko' was the best of colleagues, the best of men,\" Walters wrote. \"He loved his job and did it brilliantly, but above all he was a devoted family man. Heartfelt condolences and love to Lucy, Sam, Ruby and Joe.\"\n\nDunn added: \"Shocked, stunned, saddened. So sorry for your loss. Dicko was a truly top man and top operator. Great professional, great company, never took himself too seriously, an expert across all sports. And a loyal Evertonian. Sincere condolences and RIP Mike\"\n\nDickson was a supporter of both Tranmere Rovers and Everton and both clubs shared their own tributes, with Tranmere saying: \"The thoughts of everyone at Tranmere Rovers Football Club are with Mike's wife and family at this extremely sad time. RIP Mike.\"\n\nEverton added: \"Such sad news. Everyone at Everton send our condolences to Mike’s family. He was a great man who achieved a lot in his career. RIP Mike.\""
