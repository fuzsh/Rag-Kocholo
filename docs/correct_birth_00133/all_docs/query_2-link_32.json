        "text": "Timothy Henry Henman was born on 6 September 1974, joining a family steeped in tennis history. His great grandmother was the first woman to serve overarm at Wimbledon in 1901, while his grandfather also competed there.\n\nAt the age of 11, he was awarded a Slater scholarship - allowing him to combine his normal schoolwork (he got 10 GCSEs) with three hours of tennis training a day at a David Lloyd centre.\n\nStill, Henman's junior career was far from outstanding - his 1992 win in the British Junior Championships win (pictured here) was perhaps the highlight - and at the age of 18, he was still ranked outside the top 700 on the senior stage."
