        "text": "ByEurosport\n\nPublished 04/11/2004 at 09:42 GMT\n\nThe 30-year-old serve-volleyer enjoyed the best season of his career in 2004 reaching the semi-finals of the French and U.S. Opens, plus a quarter-final outing at Wimbledon. While he was unable to win a title and defend his Paris Masters crown, the Briton has improved under coach Paul Annacone.\n\nBorn: 9 September 1974, Oxford\n\nResidence: London, England\n\nProfessional Since: 1993\n\nHOUSTON PROFILES\n\nRoger Federer (Switzerland)\n\n13/11/2004 at 06:48\n\nCareer Singles titles: 11\n\nSingles Titles in 2004: None\n\nMAJOR CHAMPIONSHIP RECORD 2004\n\nAustralian Open – 3R (lost to Guillermo Canas); Roland Garros – SF (lost to Guillermo Coria); Wimbledon – QF (lost to Mario Ancic); U.S. Open – SF (lost to Roger Federer)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nWith his first Masters Series victory in Paris last November, Tim Henman and Paul Annacone went on to forge a successful partnership in 2004.\n\nThe serve-volleyer's Australian Open campaign ended in the third round at the hands of Guillermo Canas, but Henman recovered to defeat Roger Federer on the way to the Rotterdam semi-finals the following month.\n\nA final appearance in Indian Wells, losing to Federer has proven to be the 30-year-olds only final appearance this season.\n\nHowever, at Roland Garros he became the first Briton since Mike Sangster in 1963 to play a semi-final match and reached the same stage at Flushing Meadow, three months later.\n\nCroat Mario Ancic proved too good at Wimbledon, but Henman has had a consistent season and is sure to perform well in Houston, his first season-ending championship since 1999.\n\nHOUSTON PROFILES\n\nAndy Roddick (United States)\n\n12/11/2004 at 07:00\n\nHOUSTON PROFILES\n\nLleyton Hewitt (Australia)\n\n11/11/2004 at 07:14\n\nHOUSTON PROFILES\n\nGaston Gaudio (Argentina)\n\n10/11/2004 at 07:23\n\nJoin 3M+ users on app\n\nDownload\n\nScan me\n\nRelated Topics\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement"
