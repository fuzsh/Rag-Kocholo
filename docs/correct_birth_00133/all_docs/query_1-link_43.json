        "text": "It's fair to say Tony Henman is not a heart-on-the-sleeve man. For years, his impassive chiselled features in the centre court box at Wimbledon reflected all the emotion of an Easter Island monolith rather than the agony and the ecstasy of being the father of \"Tiger Tim\", Britain's most dogged, talented and disappointed tennis playing legend. What was this mild-mannered man feeling as his son failed heroically to reach a final?\n\nIt was none of our business. He refused all the blandishments of publicity. He never gave an interview. Suddenly, Tim Henman's father has dropped his usual restraint to reveal he is every bit as passionate a fighter as his son. \"I have spent the last 15 years avoiding the press like the plague,\" he admits. \"Now, within three months of Tim hanging up his racquet, I find myself involved in this. It's surreal, really.\"\n\nBy \"this\" he means the campaign to save the Oxfordshire village where he and his family have lived for the past 40 years. Weston-on-the-Green, near Bicester, is one of the 15 shortlisted sites across England that could become what the Government calls an eco-town, made up of little green eco-homes, but which Mr Henman and his pressure group describe as a snare and a con trick. \"Eco scam!\" are the words they use on the posters.\n\n\"It is a blind, in my view,\" he says. \"It's a housing estate, isn't it? A big housing estate. It will be detrimental to everything you try to achieve in a rural community. Our community would be stolen from us, and it would be stolen for ever. If we don't fight this, no one else will.\n\n\"The local landowners who are prepared to sell are historic farming families. They will take the money [land is expected to fetch about £1.5 million an acre] and disappear into the sunset. I have no wish to be personal, it's their right, but they have got the message from the protesters. People don't speak to them in the villages. They know who they are.\"\n\nThis is strong stuff from a man more usually in the shadows. But look at what is at stake, he says. The eco-town of what would be called Weston Otmoor would swallow up 1,200 acres of countryside, including three sites of special scientific interest, a grass strip airfield that is a haven for wildlife, farmland and a lot of green belt.\n\nIt would bring a whole new population, adding their 20,000 cars to one of the busiest motorway junctions in southern England – junction 9, where the thundering M40 (carrying 107,000 vehicles a day) meets the even more terrifying A34 (carrying 65,000 vehicles a day). When these roads are snarled up, lorries on their way from the Midlands to Southampton funnel down the B430 (6,500 vehicles day) and into Weston-on-the-Green. That's now.\n\n\"You and I think of change as a bit more of what's here already,\" warns Norman Machin, a local architect and joint chairman, with Mr Henman, of the pressure group feistily named the Weston Front. (They rejected the suggestion of WOG Off as lacking tact.)\n\n\"But it will not be like that. This place will be unrecognisable. The transport model is flawed. We are being bullied by central government who don't give a damn. If you can build here, you can build anywhere. All the rules will go out of the window. What we have is ordinary. But it's a high standard of ordinariness.\"\n\nWeston is on a war footing and \"Brigadier\" Henman, tall, lean and imposing in his blue, open-necked shirt and immaculate cream chinos, stands in the map room of his elegant home. \"The game plan is this...\" he begins. No one should underestimate the power of an Englishman roused to defend his realm.\n\nFrom nothing more than a vague concern, suddenly there are packed public meetings in the village hall, standing room only. A full-time fighting unit has been formed, including a planning expert, a website\n\nco-ordinator, a lobbyist and a PR man. A\n\nsub-committee represents 15 threatened villages within a six-mile radius of Weston. There is a campaign office. People are pledging thousands of pounds.\n\nMr Henman, so disgruntled with the main political parties that he voted Green last time, decided he had to come out of his bunker and fight. He is cynical about the fact that 12 of the 15 shortlisted sites are in Conservative constituencies.\n\n\"I feel the selection of sites has been politically motivated. If it is allowed, the first bricks will be laid in 18 months. It would be outrageous if that were to happen, with a Government in turmoil, before the general election.\"\n\nMr Henman and Mr Machin argue that eco-homes would be better grafted on to existing urban settlements. With only six weeks of the consultation period left, they are investigating the possibility of a judicial review of the planning process, if the scheme is allowed.\n\nThe protest has thrown up the fact that the Prince of Wales has an interest: the Duchy of Cornwall owns the village playing field. \"We'd like to give him a job on the committee,\" says Mr Henman. \"The campaign has promoted a feel-good factor and a great sense of unity in the surrounding villages. It has stiffened their resolve for what will be a very long haul.\"\n\nThe CV\n\nName: Tony Henman\n\nBorn: April 12, 1940\n\nEducation: Malvern College, Worcestershire. Qualified as a lawyer in 1963."
