        "text": "Tim Henman is a legendary British tennis player with an impeccable track record. He became the first male player from the UK after Roger Taylor to reach the Wimbledon Men’s Single Championship semi-finals. Even though Henman did not enter any of the finals at Grand Slam, he did reach the semi-finals of the same competition six times winning fifteen ATP titles. With such a track record, one has to wonder, what's Tim Henman net worth?\n\nIn 1996, Tim Henman was listed as British Number 1, a title he won again consecutively from 1999 to 2005 before Andy Murray succeeded him. What is Tim Henman net worth and how is his life generally?\n\nWhat is Tim Henman worth?\n\nHow rich is the former British No. 1 Tim Henman? Throughout his tennis career, Tim has done considerably well, and a combination of the prize money he accumulated in both doubles and singles during his career was $11,635,542.\n\nBesides this, Tim has received numerous endorsement and sponsorship deals that are believed to have been worth more than $32 million. As a result of his success and earnings throughout his career, Tim Henman net worth is valued at $20 million.\n\nWhat does Tim Henman do after retirement?\n\nWhat does Tim Henman do for a living now? Presently, the former British number one tennis player is a sports commentator at BBC, and he continues to get well-paid sponsorship deals from top companies like HSBC.\n\nTim Henman's house and property\n\nWhere does Tim Henman live? In 2003, Tim Henman and his Wife Lucy Heald relocated from Branes, in Southwest London to a small village in Aston Tirrold.\n\nThe move was necessary because the couple had started having kids and also because of his wife's horses. Presently, the couple shares their home with their three adorable daughters.\n\nIt is reported that Tim Henman’s house worth is almost £2m. The house known as Filberts is a 5-bedroomed house situated at the edge of the southern Oxford shire, which is nearly 5 miles from Dicot.\n\nFilberts sit on a three-acre piece of land and are equipped with a tennis court, a swimming pool, and a separate 2-bedroom cottage. The mansion goes as far back as 1625, and Tim and Lucy are still head over heels for the place and would love to live there for the rest of their lives.\n\nTim Henman's cars\n\nBesides Tennis, Tim is passionate about English sports cars, and it is believed that his motoring history might be close to the one he has with the tennis court. Tim explained in an interview that his love for cars began when his dad would drive him and his siblings to school in a black MGB GT.\n\nWhen he was old enough to drive, Mr Henman got a Peugeot 306 XSi as the first car for £13,000. Tim later used part of the cash earned from his second attempts at Wimbledon semis in 1999 to purchase a Porsche 911 Carrera 4S for £100,000. After the Porsche, Tim was lucky to get several car offerings from his official sponsors including a Mercedes SL 500 in 2003, and a Jaguar XKR in 2004.\n\nCurrently, Tim Henman drives a Jaguar F-Type R, which he got in 2018. Tim explains that he is glad that his wife owns a Range Rover that they use to drop kids to school. The Range Rover is useful as it has enough room to accommodate all kids, a dog, as well as pull a horsebox. Tim’s future dream car is the Jaguar I-Pace model, which Andy Murray owns and has nothing but good things to say about it.\n\nHere is a summary of Tim Henman cars\n\n1995 Peugeot 306 XSi\n\n1999 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S\n\n2003 Mercedes SL 500\n\n2004 Jaguar XKR\n\n2016 Range Rover\n\n2018 Jaguar F-Type R\n\nTim’s dream car Jaguar I-Pace\n\nThe life of retired Britain’s top tennis player is not so bad after all. Henry explains that he now spends most of his time in his wine cellar more than on the court. Yes! Your favourite tennis hero loves wine, and he is not shy to say it.\n\nEven though he has not played tennis professionally for over a decade now, Tim Henman net worth is evidence enough that he is still among the top venerated male tennis players in the United Kingdom to date. We wish him all success in his future endeavours.\n\nSource: TUKO.co.ke"
