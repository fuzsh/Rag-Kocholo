        "text": "As SW19 becomes the focus of British psyche once more, The Sugarman returns from an 18 month exile with a question to put to the Bookiebusters faithful. Why has Britain failed to produce a mens singles champion for nearly 70 years?\n\nNot since Fred Perry triumphed in 1936 has the famous silver gilt cup been held aloft by a British male on centre court.\n\nThe answer is startlingly simple.\n\nTennis in England was, is, and forever will be firmly in the grip of the middle classes. Like the top public schools, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Royal Ascot and the Henley Regatta, Wimbledon is a closed shop.\n\nAn old boy network in the form of the all England club has held tennis in a vice like grip for 130 years, and with it they have denied Britain a champion.\n\nIt doesnt take a genius to realize that provision to actually play tennis in England is socially divisive. Good clubs with decent coaches are expensive and beyond the means of most. Municipal courts are run down and badly funded. State schools have sold off tennis courts and playing fields for housing development to fund the shortfall in government funding.\n\nIn short, the only people rich enough to play tennis in Britain are the middle classes.\n\nThus we move onto the poster boy of middle class tennis in Britain, a man who is a personification of everything wrong with the sport, one Timothy Henry Henman.\n\nBorn is the ghetto of Oxfordshire in 1974 Henners (as he likes to be called) toughed it out learning his craft on the family court in his back garden (didnt we all Timothy). Lacking in roll models the young Tim had to rely on the exploits of his grandfather Henry Billington, who played at Wimbledon 3 times, to inspire him to greatness."
