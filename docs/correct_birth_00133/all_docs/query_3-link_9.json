        "text": "It is curious, given how affable he is in person, that public opinion on Tim Henman was so polarised in his years at the top of tennis.\n\nFor the fortnight of Wimbledon he would be feted as the very summit of English decency and pluck; but immediately upon his (often disappointingly early) exit from the tournament he would be scorned by pub experts as a naff Oxfordshire boy who should never have left school.\n\nAnd so rather than be praised for his very respectable record in SW19, his failure to win there was interpreted as a defining example of English sporting mediocrity around the turn of the century. But speak to Henman and you find a man of dry humour at ease with the successes and failures of his career, and determined to improve the lot of young tennis players in Britain – especially those from poorer backgrounds.\n\n\"It's probably true that tennis is seen as a middle-class sport, and I guess I was part of that impression,\" says the 34-year-old. \"In the past, a kind of stigma was there. 'It's not as cheap as football', people thought to themselves. And then the summer would come, Wimbledon would be on, and everybody picks a racquet and plays the game. There's so much interest in it, and people realise it doesn't cost a packet to play. We've got to do a lot to break down the barriers to entry and get kids in schools playing. And I want to devote time to that.\"\n\nHe has been promoting a new scheme, with the drinks company Robinsons, aimed at getting young people involved in the sport. When the tournament opens on Monday he and pop star Alesha Dixon will be rallying with lucky members of the traditionally long queue. \"Alesha was fantastic,\" he says. \"When we started working together she said she'd never played tennis in her life, but she's got amazing co-ordination and had me running around by the end.\"\n\nThese days Henman leads a life of blissful retirement. He lives just south of Oxford with his wife Lucy – who will soon be going back to work in television – and three daughters, Rosie, seven, Olivia, four and a half, and Grace, 20 months. He seems almost apologetic about the freedom he has. \"I hardly do anything these days,\" he chuckles. \"I seem to be going on a lot of skiing holidays, but being a father is the most important thing in my life. It does just change the way you think about things when you realise there are people whose interests come before your own.\"\n\nWhat about the golf? Henman is widely reported to be a very steady hand on the fairway, and his partners over 18 holes are known to include Sam Torrance. \"Oh yes, I do play a lot of golf. I play a bit with Sam too, who's great fun\". And his handicap? \"Oh, I play off about one at the moment.\"\n\nHenman will be commentating again for the BBC at Wimbledon this year. Last year's final, in which his gasps of shock at the quality of the tennis could be heard every few seconds, was \"the best match of tennis I ever saw\". He was attacked by a few television critics as bland, but vying for the microphone with John McEnroe would leave most people susceptible to that accusation.\n\nThe task this year, as members of the public recognise, will be to keep tabs on Murraymania. \"Andy's got a very good chance this year, as good as anyone beyond Federer.\" Including Novak Djokovic? \"No I think actually he's pulled clear of Djokovic, who is a fantastic player, but I think Andy's got that No 3 slot to himself. He'll only get better too, which is the exciting thing about British tennis just now.\"\n\nHenman, whose highest ranking was No 4 in the world, says he recognises how different a character Murray is to him. \"I was never really into the fame game, and I don't think Andy is either. But he's a lot more volatile on court, which is absolutely fine because that's how he plays, working himself up. I was more reserved and calmer.\" Murray's game will get better naturally, Henman says, but there are a few tactical things he could do that would help him break into the seemingly impenetrable duopoly at the top of the game.\n\n\"Andy's got a brilliant mind on court. He could be more aggressive with his first serve, and give his opponent less opportunities with his second. Courts are slower at the moment, and the balls are bouncing higher, so he could be a bit more pro-active with his serving. Other than that, his game will just keep developing as his body does.\"\n\nAnd is there just a hint of jealousy in Murray's assault on the title, and burgeoning popularity, just as Henman takes a back seat? \"A lot of people ask me that. But you know one of my first tasks last year was interviewing Andy on the hill. I asked him if he thought Henman Hill would ever really be Murray Mountain and he said, 'No way, it'll stay yours for a long time'. I must say, I agree.\"\n\nThe Brit pack: Who to cheer (beyond Murray)\n\nWOMEN\n\nAnne Keothavong\n\nAge: 25.
