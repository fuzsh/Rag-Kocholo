        "text": "Easily Britain’s best tennis player for a generation and ranked among the world’s top ten for the best part of a decade, reaching number four in the world in 2002. Henman carried British hopes at their home Grand Slam for more than ten years, reaching the Wimbledon semi-finals on four occasions, twice losing to Pete Sampras (one of the greatest players of all time), and once to the then World Number One Lleyton Hewitt.\n\nHenman came closest to fulfilling his dream of winning Wimbledon in 2001. After beating Roger Federer in the quarter-finals, he lost a rain affected semi-final against the eventual champion Goran Ivanisevic. Henman also reached the semi-finals at both the US Open and French Open in 2004 and has won eleven titles in his career so far, including the Paris Masters in 2003."
