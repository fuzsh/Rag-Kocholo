On the basis of his novel “The possibility of an island” this film was conceived by the writer Michel Houellebecq himself. In a process spanning several years, mostly before actual shooting, I composed this film music for orchestra, chorus, Solists and pop band.

La Possibilitée d’une Île by Mathis Nitschke

“Mathis Nitschke makes an impressive composing debut with this French post-apocalyptic cloning fable. If Jerry Goldsmith went for primal sounds in PLANET OF THE APES as characters wandered across a desert Forbidden Zone, then Nitschke goes for stunning orchestrations, ranging from big symphonic reveals to a solo viola, piano or harp representing one clone’s existential sadness. It’s the kind of intriguingly unique music that Europeans seem to hear more than us – a scoring debut that opens the mouth with the wonder of who the heck this guy is. Hopefully we’ll be finding out a lot more in Nitschke’s musical future, one that signifies anything but an end of days.”
