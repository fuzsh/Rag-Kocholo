He subsequently moved to Ireland for several years,[1] before moving back to France, where he currently resides.[2] He was described in 2015 as \"France’s biggest literary export and, some say, greatest living writer.\"[3] In a 2017 DW article, he is dubbed the \"undisputed star, and enfant terrible, of modern French literature\".[4]"
