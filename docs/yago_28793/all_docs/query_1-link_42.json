        "text": "Emmanuel Buzay is an assistant professor of French and Francophone Studies in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. He received degrees from the Université de Paris III – Sorbonne Nouvelle and the Université de Paris XIII – Villetaneuse, prior to earning his Ph.D. in French and Francophone Studies from the University of Connecticut, where he subsequently taught for several years.\n\nA twentieth- and twenty-first-century modernist specializing in French and Francophone literature, Professor Buzay also has a professional background in the fields of cinema and new media studies, which inform his research and teaching. In addition, Professor Buzay studies and gives courses on French and Francophone video games and films. He is also certified by the French Embassy and the Paris Chamber of Commerce in the teaching of French for specific purposes in the fields of Diplomatic French, Medical French, and Scientific and Technical French.\n\nWith a focus on the posthuman imaginary in French and Francophone literature, Professor Buzay’s current research project examines how futuristic novels explore the very limits of that which refers to humankind and the perception of its origins. He does this by honing in on a recurrent concern rooted in the mythologies that represent the invention of writing as the “double of mankind”, exemplifying a trend that he terms “the longing to be written and… its refusal”."
