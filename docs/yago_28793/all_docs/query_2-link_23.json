        "text": "Michel Houellebecq, the presiding enfant terrible of French literature, whose last two novels resulted in scandals, lawsuits and huge sales, has announced plans to direct a movie version of his next novel, provisionally called ''An Island.'' His publisher, Éditions Fayard, said the novel would appear next year, while the movie will be produced by GMT Productions, which, like Fayard, is owned by the Lagardère Group. So far, of novels by Mr. Houellebecq (pronounced WELL-beck), left, only ''Whatever'' has been adapted for the screen. In an interview with Le Monde, Mr. Houellebecq, 46, who divides his time between Ireland and Spain, said that after completing his new novel he would write the screenplay for it. To direct a movie, he noted, would offer respite from the extreme solitude that accompanies writing a novel. He added that he also hoped to write a movie version of his last novel, ''Platform'' (Knopf), which, he said, would work better on the screen than ''The Elementary Particles'' (Knopf), the novel that made his name in France in 1999.\n\nALAN RIDING"
