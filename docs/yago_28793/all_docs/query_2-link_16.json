        "text": "Michel Houellebecq’s memoir Quelques mois dans ma vie: Octobre 2022–Mars 2023 (A Few Months in My Life: October 2022–March 2023) has been universally panned—in Europe and the States. The book addresses two events that Houellebecq was involved in during the period that produced a fair amount of press. The first was an interview in which he made several critical statements about Islam. In Quelque mois he apparently attempts to walk these back a bit. The second was an explicit video in which he appeared. The film was made by the Dutch artist collective Keeping It Real Art Critics (KIRAC), and while Houellebecq had agreed to appear in the film, he claims in Quelques mois that he was tricked into signing a release for the film to be distributed."
