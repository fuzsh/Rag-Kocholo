        "meta_description": "This article analyses Michel Houellebecq’s use of multimedia in order to reveal how he creates transmedial worlds that cross media thresholds. Through plurimedial combinations, expansive adaptations, and post-textual work, Houellebecq extends the realms of creative intervention. Through these three types of activity, Houellebecq troubles textual boundaries and the sacralised and mythologised notions of author and text. His transmedial undertaking addresses artistic marginalisation while encouraging new forms of creative production in a growing space of possibilities.",

        "text": "Plurimedial Combination\n\n4As media forms combine, plurimedial artifacts are created which “produce the effect of medial hybridity whose constituents can be traced back to originally heterogeneous media” (Wolf 2011: 5). In the creation of a hybrid piece, the message doesn’t reside solely in one medium but exists across multiple media forms. The seuils become blurred and contested as each medium comes to rely on the other’s presence in the new creation, forming an indivisible partnership. An example of plurimedial combination in Houellebecq’s œuvre is the photo-novel Lanzarote (2000). This piece is composed of a fictional text and a collection of Houellebecq’s own photographs of Lanzarote. The novel follows a frustrated middle-aged man on holiday and a cult on the island. The novel is fictional, however the presence of Houellebecq’s photographs adds a sense of realism and authenticity to the piece. Lanzarote is described as a récit on the Flammarion cover, evoking non-fictional texts such as a récit de voyage or récit de vie, further blurring the lines between autobiography and fiction. The various editions of Lanzarote present the photographs in different ways to different effects. The first edition of the hypotext places the photographs after the text but holds them together in the one coffret. The reader is free to look upon the images at any point in the reading process, permitting multiple subjective ways of experiencing the piece. However, in newer editions, such as the 2004 English language version, the photos are inserted into the text at seemingly random intervals. They often come at pivotal points in the story; for example, a photograph of arid plants interrupts the climatic moment of a sex scene (58), disrupting the flow of the narrative thread and the dramatic tension. The interspersed photographs disturb the linearity and cohesion of the narrative in this edition yet they, as with the coffret, add new subjective interpretive possibilities. The reader is pushed to consider the links between the image and the text, but this time in relation to particular scenes. Thus, whether the photographs are presented separately or interspersed within the text, they present new semiotic and semantic possibilities for the reader to interpret.\n\nExpansive Adaptation\n\nPost-Textual Works\n\nConclusion\n\n17By investigating three observable types of media activity, this article has shown that Houellebecq moves beyond text to create a transmedial œuvre. Through plurimedial combinations, Houellebecq contests “closed” interpretations of the text as a story-world extends across media. The text is not an untouchable sacred medium and other media cannot be neglected. This same is true of Houellebecq’s adaptations as they extend the themes and worlds of the hypotexts, exploring new, at times contrefictionnel, subjective possibilities. This diaspora of adaptation puts into question the concept of an authoritative hypotext, refuting the idea of copy versus original. This way of analysing adaptations places focus on the transmedial processes rather than focusing on adaptation as secondary. As more subjective possibilities are opened, notions of textual authority are disturbed. A paradox emerges as Houellebecq both asserts the multiplicity of interpretative possibilities while taking a dictatorially omnipotent approach to his work. Houellebecq’s post-textual short films and his 2016 exhibition reveal that he is presenting himself as a post-textual author, asserting himself as more than an author, an objective that is confirmed by his roles as an actor. These films show how Houellebecq continues to contest authorial myths while also productively using his notoriety to access various kinds of Bourdieusian capital. This article has sought to show the advantages of viewing an author’s work through a transmedial lens. Looking beyond the text has opened up new fertile ways of understanding Houellebecq’s œuvre and as such each of the types of activity mentioned in this article deserves to be addressed further as Houellebecq continues his career. These transmedial projects influence, link, and add to Houellebecq’s textual work and as such should not be marginalised or treated as inferior. Through his transmedial work, Houellebecq deconstructs the stability of the text, challenging its integrity while producing questions around its place and value within the current multimedia cultural climate. These techniques allow Houellebecq to protest against the restrictive artistic hierarchies as well as allowing him to address the domination of mass media. By using other media, Houellebecq manages to concurrently protest both the marginalisation of the authors’ non-literary work in the literary field and the marginalisation of literature in the larger cultural horizon. In doing so, he also addresses and engages with the broader cultural context, placing himself into a more strategic market position. Through his transmedial work, Houellebecq thus promotes the new possibilities of artistic production within an expanding space of possibilities, a move that has meant challenging the limitation and mythologisation of the author and the text."
