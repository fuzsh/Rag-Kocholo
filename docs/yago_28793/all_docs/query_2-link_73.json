        "text": "Much of the book is superficially repellent – especially the details about the persecution of Michel’s half-brother, Bruno, while he is at the sort of bestial boarding school that some would have you believe only the English can specialise in. At least Michel’s grandmother shows some interest in him: but as he pursues studies that end up becoming not merely life-changing but world-changing – with existence losing its magic and mystery and becoming simply about atoms – he becomes introverted in the extreme (one suspects a degree of autism) and finds it almost impossible to forge normal relationships with others, not least Annabelle, the schoolfriend who dotes on him. Eventually – more than 20 years later – they attempt intimacy and it is a disaster.\n\nThe stories of both men turn, in the end, on the elimination of normal human feelings (a process apparently begun by their parents, especially their mother), and their role in the creation of life. Bruno’s course is, however, rather different from his brother’s. He becomes a sex addict, relying on the services of prostitutes, until he eventually meets a woman as interested in these matters as he is. I do not wish to spoil the book as, despite its less-than-vanilla content, it is superb, and I hope some of you will think of reading it; but her end is predictable, albeit in an unpredictable way (few characters leave Houellebecq novels in a conventional way) and Bruno is eventually liberated from a mental asylum (where he has been consigned because of an inability to control himself while out in public) by his more rational, but no-less damaged, half-brother."
