The way to achieve it was difficult ...",

My collaboration was to turn most of the field and a few scenes in Benidorm.\n\nWell, good ...\n\nShooting with Houellebecq is not so simple, or rather it is a very different from a conventional shoot. Michel, as a writer, accustomed to working alone and have very little experience of filming, he developed the short film its own way of working.\n\nMany tracking, we filming many sets, I proposed ideas plans, he climbed on these locating his computer at night, returning to try again another time, went back looking for a film language. Obviously, the short preparation time a little limiting its research.\n\nHe wanted to find itself and would have liked to take much more time, like when you write a book, he hates improvisation, refuses to turn the plan, at the time, it would seem unnecessary, even to Contrechamps the principal actor for example. As if it saw and did not need to be seen. But it also has an exceptional intelligence, speed of understanding, thinking out of the ordinary, a very special personality, is a charming man, very reserved about his work on his approach, which did not want to part of its questions, which speaks only when itâ€™s absolutely necessary.\n\nA very special then.\n\nWe move a little in the dark, actors included, which has not always been easy.\n\nThen there was the intervention of Eric Guichard, it must talk about himself. I have had my baby. I met Michael at the end of filming, exhausted, frustrated at the lack of time to shoot, apparently not ready to repeat the experience.\n\nThen silence."
