The French author has a dedicated room for fellow smokers at his photography exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo, and it features a jukebox with musical covers of his poems and a bar.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

Germany’s Central Council of Jews calls an upcoming sale at Hermann Historica “disgusting.” The auction features Hermann Göring’s underwear and his container for cyanide, which he eventually used to commit suicide in 1946. The country’s law doesn’t prohibit buying or owning Nazi artifacts.\n\nEngland’s first trade union for artists gets certification. The Artists’s Union England (AUE) was given its official “certificate of independence” this week.\n\nAdrien Brody is Art Basel’s man-about-town. The Academy Award winner stood in for Hollywood’s most frequent fairgoer, Leonardo DiCaprio, at this week’s Art Basel, making appearances at the Grand Hotel Trois Rois, the Messplatz and a dinner hosted by Pace Gallery’s Marc Glimcher. We still miss seeing Leo on the fair floor though.\n\nYBA Michael Landy steals the show at Art Basel. The British artist’s exhibition at the Tinguely Museum has been a big hit this week, and features an artwork called the Credit Card Destroying Machine, which does exactly as the title suggests. However, committing plastic to the machine is probably no big deal for Basel regulars, since it doesn’t do any more damage to your bank account than throwing down cash at the fair."
