        "text": "by Michel Houellebecq\n\nPremiere 9.8.2008 Locarno Film Festival\n\nStarring: Benoît Magimel, Patrick Bauchau, Jordi Dauder, et al.\n\nDirector and Screenplay: Michel Houellebecq – Production: Eric Altmeyer, Mandarin Cinema\n\nCinematography: Eric Guichard, Jeanne Lapoirie – Editing: Camille Cotte – Sounddesign: Raphael Sohier – Music: Mathis Nitschke\n\nOn the basis of his novel “The possibility of an island” this film was conceived by the writer Michel Houellebecq himself. In a process spanning several years, mostly before actual shooting, I composed this film music for orchestra, chorus, Solists and pop band.\n\nLa Possibilitée d’une Île by Mathis Nitschke\n\n“Mathis Nitschke makes an impressive composing debut with this French post-apocalyptic cloning fable. If Jerry Goldsmith went for primal sounds in PLANET OF THE APES as characters wandered across a desert Forbidden Zone, then Nitschke goes for stunning orchestrations, ranging from big symphonic reveals to a solo viola, piano or harp representing one clone’s existential sadness. It’s the kind of intriguingly unique music that Europeans seem to hear more than us – a scoring debut that opens the mouth with the wonder of who the heck this guy is. Hopefully we’ll be finding out a lot more in Nitschke’s musical future, one that signifies anything but an end of days.”\n\nBy DANIEL SCHWEIGER, Soundtrack Editor\n\nPublished 4/27/2009"
