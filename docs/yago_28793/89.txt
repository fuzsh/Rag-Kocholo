Michel Houellebecq's directorial debut is the most liberal and most visually stunning filmic adaptation of one his works to date. The former film student shows he is well versed in the works of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Michelangelo Antonioni. LA POSSIBILITÉ D’UNE ÎLE is a science fiction film about humankind's alienation from itself. In an undefined future, 25th generation clone Daniel (Benoît Magimel) dwells in a high tech cave. He is the penultimate specimen of his kind. LA POSSIBILITÉ D’UNE ÎLE describes in flashbacks how catastrophe came about. It all began with Daniel's father's sect promising humanity an eternal life based on cloning technology. Star architect Rem Koolhaas contributed buildings for the set, and artist Rosemarie Trockel supplied sculptures for Houellebecq's vision of a human race that has lost the belief in individuality.
