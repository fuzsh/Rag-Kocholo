Not wanting to let down his best friend and manager Skeets Maguire, who has hopes of him becoming the next champion, he is reluctant to bring up the subject with him. Maisie convinces Terry to tell Skeets, whose unexpected reaction induces him to step into the ring again.",

        "text": "Maisie is on her way to a job when she gets kicked off the train for not having a ticket. A boxer gives her a ride, but his manger assumes she's a floozy looking to get hooked up with him. Of course Maisie charms everyone, even the manager but they have a real volatile relationship.\n\nIt gets a bit long toward the end, but this was a pretty entertaining Maisie show. She doesn't assume every guy is a wolf, every guy doesn't act like a wolf, However, she does end up with a guy, but this would have been a good one for her to just move on at the end.\n\nAfter watching five Maisie movies, I can say you don't have to start at the beginning and watch them in order, each film is a world unto itself so you can drop in on any of them and be charmed by the wonderful Ann Southern.\n\nletterboxd.com/retrohound/list/maisie-films-ranked/\n\nMaisie is the woman we should all aspire to be. A hard-working gal who's kind to everyone, takes care of herself, and often wears ruffles on her bum.\n\nThis installment starts with a delightful sequence where Maisie is dancing her feet off as a taxi dancer. I would have been happy if the whole film was set there, but we quickly move on to an Adirondacks lodge/nightclub and the world of championship boxing. It's a good story with fine performances, but that's all gravy cause allI need is Maisie to be happy.\n\nAnn Sothern remains charming as ever as Maisie here, but I was a bit disappointed that Maisie gets written as a bit more of a fool here. That's not a thing with just her, though; all the characters left a lot to be desired with the exception of Mrs. Dolan (Margaret Moffatt). Across the board, I don't think the characters were handled consistently or believably. The biggest issue was the lack of chemistry between the love interests while there's far too much where there isn't supposed to be a love interest. The whole thing just doesn't mesh as far as the plot goes.\n\nAs far as the franchise goes, this also is surprisingly dark, like with Maisie ending up stranded…\n\nThe last Maisie movie I hadn’t seen yet, and I absolutely loved it. If might—maybe—rank near “Gold Rush Maisie”, but I’ll have to re-watch both to confirm. :)\n\nThe core of what makes the Maisie series so enjoyable is fully on display here. Some good people have some serious problems. Maisie, despite a series of her own serious problems, wants to help them due to her generous spirit. She is generally effective at doing so. She makes some mistakes, and while they are always well-intentioned, they can be severe. But these serve to humanize her further. The scenarios are well-written and expertly played. And Ann Sothern is just so, so good in this role.\n\nThis one is perhaps a bit long on boxing scenes. But they are well-done, and it also has a Virginia O’Brien song as a special bonus.\n\nGreat chemistry between Ann Sothern and George Murphy. Interesting that the cast member she married was Robert Sterling.\n\nI wish these movies would lean more towards comedy and less towards melodrama, as Ann Sothern was such a talented comedic actor. This doesn't deviate from the formula of the Maisie movies at all but it is still worth watching for Sothern's performance and way with a quip. She starts out broke and needing a job, gets mixed up in some family drama because of her big heart, and ends up in love with a man who will never be heard from again. The final Maisie movie should be a big reveal of how she murders all the men she ends up with in the series.\n\ndecent movie til it starts takin itself seriously. and very typically, the two best ppl in this movie get zero screentime. rags gets 5 seconds in a phone call at the beginning of the movie and ginny o’brien is basically the highlight of this movie with her number. travesty for real. not surprised tho, they didn’t kno what they had. Mayb that’s part of what makes em special too, the extreme undersaturation of their movie appearances. not a bad movie , not that good either. 60/100\n\nThere was only one Ann Sothern and there was only one Maisie, and she was always a joy to watch. I think there were nine or ten 'Maisie' films, and this was number five, so she was well-established (and, perhaps, dare I say even typecast) as Maisie by now. Basically, people she cares about have problems, and she tries to sort them out for them. Psychologists might call it co-dependency, but we call it a very entertaining movie. x"
