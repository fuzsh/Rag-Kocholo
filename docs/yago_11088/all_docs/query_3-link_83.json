        "text": "While doing research for an article I came across an unexpected search result: \"Was Jack Benny Gay?\"\n\nThere was no more than the question as previously stated from the original poster, but the replies made for interesting reading, ranging from:\n\nJack Benny Celebrating his 39th Birthday\n\n\"Of course not, he was a well known skirt-chaser in his youth, and he was married to Mary Livingston for many years\"\n\n\"Sure he was, everyone in Hollywood with the possible exception of John Wayne was and is homosexual!\"\n\n\"Part of Benny's \"schtick\" was his limp-wristed hand-to-face gestures. He was not gay, but emphasized what his fans observed as \"acting like a girl\" for humor. While heterosexual Benny tried to gay it up, many really gay actors or comedians in those days tried to act as \"straight\" as they could muster.\"\n\n\"... the idea behind his character was to have him a little on the ambiguous side. His character was also supposed to embody some of the most negative characteristics, and his effeminate mannerisms were more designed to be pompous rather than \"gay\". Also, back in the 50s society wasn't so obsessed with men acting masculine and defining the more effeminate ones as \"gay\", it was a lot more acceptable. In fact, you could probably look at most actors and comedians from the 20s-50s and point out quirks and mannerisms that today's society would define as \"gay\".\n\nIts a silly question on several levels. First of all, the writer seems to know very little about Jack Benny. Yes, he was married to Mary Livingston (born Sadie Marks) from 1927 until his death in 1974.\n\nHaters will argue that means nothing, many Hollywood actors were married to disguise their \"preferences\". They well also point to Jack's \"less than macho\" stage presence. This ignores the fact that Jack's comic genius was based on creating a character that was so much NOT like him. The Jack Benny who appeared on the air was vain, self-centered, miserly, and insisted on being the center of attention. According to all reports, in real life Jack was warm, generous, and pleasant to be around. In real life Jack was even a good (perhaps not great) violin player; in his later years he appeared with several orchestras around the country as part of their fund raising, and by all accounts he had no reason to be embarrassed by his playing.\n\nHis Jack Benny v Fred Allen feud was a hilarious fake. Fred Allen & Jack Benny worked adjoining time-slots on Sunday nights for a long time, and the feud was simply a gag that worked very well for both shows. Fred and Jack were actually very close friends, according to many that is why the supposed feud worked so well for so many years.\n\nThe real reason that the supposition that Jack Benny was gay is so ludicrous is the simple fact that no one had sex before 1974 any way! Yes, there were more than a few hot ladies in show business, as well as several manly men. O.K., there were some men who may have been a little \"light in the loafers\" as well, but the important point is that NONE OF THEM WAS HAVING SEX BEFORE 1974! Don't believe me? Just look at the old movies--men and women, even married men and women, didn't sleep in the same bed. They weren't even allowed to kiss unless they were fully clothed and each had at least one foot on the ground!\n\nLabels"
