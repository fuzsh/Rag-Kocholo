        "text": "Born. To Dinah Shore, 30, dark-eyed scorch-singer, and George Montgomery, 31, cow-puncher-turned-cinemactor: their first child, a daughter; in Los Angeles. Name: Melissa Ann. Weight: 7 Ibs.\n\nMarried. Roy Rogers, 35, guitar-strumming “King of the Cowboys,” idol of cinema-going U.S. moppets; and Dale Evans, 29, his unkissed leading lady through 24 Westerns; each for the second time; at a ranch near Davis, Okla.\n\nMarried. Thomas J.Herbert, 53, round-faced, silver-haired governor of Ohio; and Mildred Helen Stevenson, 40, his doctor’s secretary; each for the second time; in Indianapolis.\n\nDivorced. By Ann Sothern, 38, cinema’s blowzy, blousy “Maisie”: second husband Robert Sterling, 31, B-picture kid-brother type; after four years, seven months of marriage, one child; in Los Angeles.\n\nDivorced. By Mignon Good Eberhart, 48, tireless producer of best-selling whodunits (26 in 18 years): second husband John Prince Hazen Perry, 65, Manhattan construction executive; after 14 months of marriage, no children; in Reno.\n\nDied. Hans van Meegeren, 58, master forger of old masters; of a heart ailment; in Amsterdam. Painter Van Meegeren set out to even scores with hostile art critics by showing them up as incompetents, produced such a persuasive “Vermeer” that critics acclaimed it as Vermeer’s masterpiece. In 1945, charged with collaboration for having sold Hermann Göring a Vermeer, Dutchman Van Meegeren saved his neck by declaring himself a faker, proved it by painting another “Vermeer” in his prison cell.\n\nDied. Albert Carl Grzesinski, 68, German democrat, Minister of the Interior (1926-30) for the Weimar Republic; of pneumonia; in Queens, N.Y. In 1931, as Berlin’s Police President, he tried to gag Rabble-Rouser Hitler, ordered him deported as an undesirable alien, but Chancellor Heinrich Brüning did not sign the order, and a year later the Nazis hounded Grzesinski out of the country.\n\nDied. Jessie Lincoln Randolph, 75, granddaughter of Abraham Lincoln and his last direct descendant born with the Lincoln name; in Bennington, Vt.\n\nDied. Mary Scott Lord Dimmick Harrison, 89, widow of Benjamin Harrison, 23rd U.S. President; in Manhattan. A niece of Harrison’s first wife, she helped out as White House hostess during her aunt’s last illness, married Harrison in 1896, 3½ years after her aunt’s death, three years after Harrison left the White House."
