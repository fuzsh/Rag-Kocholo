        "text": "In 1933, after spending five years playing bit parts in movies, Ann Sothern began to play leading ladies for Columbia Pictures. Her first starring role was in \"Let's Fall in Love,\" and for the next three years, she played ing√©nues in a series of assembly-line pictures. However, the films were not major motion pictures, but rather what Sothern called \"Z pictures.\" She told a reporter, \"I'd trade a pretty girl role any day in the week for that of an old hag, if the hag was a real character.\"\n\nSothern met Lucille Ball, who was struggling in the same issues, and the two became close friends. Both actresses began their movie careers as showcase beauties, graduated to larger roles in B movies, and longed to demonstrate their real talent in major movies.\n\nIn 1936, Sothern signed on with RKO and married Roger Pryor, a band leader and part-time actor. After churning out eight movies in 1937, she resigned from RKO and went on tour with Pryor's band.\n\nIn 1938, Sothern received an offer to play the role of Fredric March's wise-cracking secretary in the MGM movie \"Trade Winds.\" Many reviewers thought that Sothern stole the show, and one of the people who immediately took notice of Sothern's performance was movie producer Walter Ruben, who was looking for Jean Harlow's replacement in the 1938 MGM movie \"Maisie.\"\n\nThe movie was so successful that it spawned eight sequels over the next 10 years and was also the basis for the popular radio series, \"Maisie,\" which ran from 1945 to 1952. In many ways, the self-assured characteristics of Maisie were the same that Sothern possessed.\n\nBecause of the success of the \"Maisie\" films, Louis B. Mayer, the MGM studio boss, signed Sothern to a long-term contract.\n\nIn 1939, she co-starred in the musical \"Fast and Furious.\" In 1941, she co-starred in another musical, \"Lady Be Good,\" and introduced the song, \"The Last Time I Saw Paris,\" which won an Oscar for best song.\n\nNot all her movies were musicals. Sothern either starred or co-starred in a number of dramatic roles in movies as well, the most dramatic being one of the three wives in the thriller \"A Letter to Three Wives.\" In 1950, MGM cancelled Sothern's contract after she contracted infectious hepatitis.\n\nDuring the time Sothern was under contract with MGM, she divorced Pryor in 1942; married actor Robert Sterling in 1943; conducted successful USO tours with the military during World War II; gave birth to her only child, Patricia, in 1944; and divorced Sterling in 1949.\n\nIn the early 1950s, when Sothern's health began to return, most of her movie offers were for minor roles. However, television was providing opportunities for many actors.\n\nOn Feb. 1, 1953, the television series \"Private Secretary\" debuted, with Sothern starring as Maggie McNamara, the ambitious secretary of a talent agency. The show soon became a hit. The producers wanted to continue the series, but the show was cancelled in 1957 because of a contract dispute with Sothern.\n\nBecause of Sothern's close friendship with Lucille Ball, she was Lucy's first guest star on her new hour-long program. The show was a smash hit, and the writers wanted to create a new role for Sothern on the show, but she declined. Then, Desi Arnaz, Lucy's husband, asked the writers to come up with a new idea so that Sothern could have her own show, which would be produced by Lucy and Desi.\n\nThe writers came up with \"The Ann Sothern Show,\" which debuted on Dec. 6, 1958. Sothern played the role of Katy O'Connor, the ambitious assistant manager of a plush New York City hotel. Once again, Sothern had another hit, and the series ran for three years.\n\nOnce financially secure, Sothern became very selective in the offers she entertained. She did agree to play Jerry Van Dyke's mother in the television series \"My Mother, the Car.\" The role was easy because Sothern never had to appear on screen. Van Dyke's mother had died and was reincarnated as his car, so all she had to supply was the voice. Desi Arnaz coaxed Sothern to temporarily replace Vivian Vance, Lucy's sidekick on \"The Lucy Show.\" Desi tried to persuade Sothern to remain on the show, but she declined.\n\nIn 1973, while appearing on stage, a fake tree fell on top of Sothern, fracturing a lumbar vertebra and shattering the nerves in her legs. From that time on, she could only walk with the use of a cane. As limiting as it was, Sothern continued to perform. In 1986, she was cast as the outspoken Tisha Doughty in the movie, \"The Whales of August,\" for which she received an Academy Award nomination. This movie was a real treat for Sothern because her daughter, Tisha, also appeared in it. It was the last screen performance for Sothern. She died at her home in Ketchum, Idaho, on March 15, 2004.\n\nHer obituary in the Los Angeles Times summed up Sothern's career achievements with the headline, \"Ann Sothern gave strong women a voice in films and on television.\""
