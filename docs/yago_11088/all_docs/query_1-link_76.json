        "text": "Film and television actress Audrey Totter (1917-2013) had a relatively short-lived film career, but created several memorable movie moments, mostly at MGM, from 1944 until the early 1950s. The former radio actress first played small parts in films such as “Main Street After Dark” (1945, her debut film), “The Sailor Takes a Wife” (1945) and “The Postman Always Rings Twice” (1946), until she got her break in the whodunit “Lady in the Lake” (1947), based on Raymond Chandler’s detective novel, with Robert Montgomery playing Marlowe; he also directed the film.\n\n“Lady in the Lake” is notable for its experimental use of the first-person narrative style because for most of the film the camera serves as the eyes of private detective Philip Marlowe. Ms Totter’s character looks directly into the camera, as if she’s sparring with Marlowe and by extension with the audience. In the film, Robert Montgomery appears only occasionally, reflected in a mirror, so the camera largely focuses on Ms. Totter as a conspiring publisher who hires Marlowe but has secrets of her own.\n\nYet, “The Set-Up” (1949), directed by Robert Wise, is maybe the most outstanding film in her career. It’s a screen classic in the noir genre, played out in real time, with Robert Ryan as a washed-up boxer who refuses to give up; Ms. Totter delivers a nuanced performance as his supporting yet despairing wife.\n\nMs. Totter also played hardboiled dames with the same ease, as she did in “Tension” (1949), directed by John Berry who was later blacklisted. In this suspenseful noir thriller she cheats on her husband, played by Richard Basehart, and gets him blamed for the murder of her boyfriend, played by Lloyd Gough. ‘If you haven’t got enough brains to agree with me, then keep your mouth shut!’ she says. “Tension” is one of those diamonds in the rough that you find when you least expect it, but powerhouse performances by Ms. Totter are the file rouge throughout her film career.\n\nIn the late 1930s, she began her acting career in radio in Chicago, and she moved to Los Angeles a few years later to work in films. She performed in various film genres, but to film audiences, she gained much attention for her work in film noir and for playing femme fatale characters, as well as tough and complex women. She became a standout actress of her time.\n\nI met Ms. Totter in April 2004 when she was 86 and lived at the Motion Picture and Television Home, a.k.a. the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, a healthcare facility and retirement community less than an hour from Los Angeles, where the film and television industry has been taking care of its own for decades. Casting director and mutual friend Marvin Paige (1927-2013) drove me from his West Toluca Lake home on Landale Street to Woodland Hills, where we had the following conversation with the veteran actress.\n\nAfter our interview, the three of us had lunch in the restaurant of the Motion Picture and Television Home where Ms. Totter pointed out who sat where; two tables from us was former actress Virginia Grey, who, by that time, rarely left her room. She had made her screen debut in 1927 at age ten. How close could you get to the early beginnings of film history?\n\nWith her soft voice, Ms. Totter—at age 86 still looking radiant as ever—recalled her days at MGM and her wonderful life after she virtually retired from the screen in the early 1950s.\n\nAudrey Mary Totter was born on December 20, 1917, in Joliet, Illinois. More than nine years after we met in 2004, she died in Woodland Hills on December 12, 2013, at age 95—a few days shy of her 96th birthday. The cause was complications of congestive heart failure, her daughter Mea Lane said. The death of the versatile and stylish actress marked the end of a significent era in Hollywood, as she was one of the last surviving stars from the golden age of film—and of film noir.\n\nMs. Totter, how did you end up signing for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer?\n\nMetro and 20th Century Fox wanted me at the same time after they had heard me on the radio, but everybody suggested that I go with MGM, so I did. And they were right. I did several screentests for wardrobe before I became a contract player and did my first film at the studio [“Main Street After Dark,” 1945], so by then, I was used to the camera. You also had a coach who helped you when you needed it. At MGM, we all made a lot of friends; it was like a fraternity. We were all young, eager, and happy to get the opportunity to work there.\n\nIn “The Set-Up” there is this wonderful scene with the character of Robert Ryan in his final boxing fight. Your character is in the hotel room but can’t stand it any longer and decides to go for a walk. You pass this newspaper stand where the radio is on and you’re able to follow what’s happening. Your performance and that film stand the test of time, don’t they?\n\nYes, although I think I made other films that were at least as important and interesting, but I never made another film that I enjoyed more than “The Set-Up.” Robert Wise was such a wonderful director, and that was one of his first pictures. I was under contract with Metro then, and RKO wanted to borrow me. So then I asked, ‘Who is the director?’ ‘Robert Wise.’ ‘Who’s that?’ [Laughs.] Then I read the script, which was wonderful, and when I met Mr. Wise, I thought he was wonderful, so I decided to do it. I was very glad that I did. And Robert Ryan was marvelous; he should have won an Academy Award, or he should at least have been nominated. Don’t you think so? But, you see, they were making “Champion” [with Kirk Douglas as the boxer] at that time, and for whatever reason, Mr. [Howard] Hughes—the owner of RKO—thought “Champion” would be more important. So when “The Set-Up” was released, we had no publicity. But the film did very well. Robert Wise was so talented, and both of us knew that it would work.\n\nDo you think today’s audiences still remember Robert Ryan? In Europe, he’s completely forgotten.\n\nHis films are still on television, but I don’t think he gets the credit he deserves.\n\nI suppose your most famous film still is “The Postman Always Rings Twice” [1946]. You appeared in only one scene with John Garfield, but it was a very interesting character to play, wasn’t it?\n\nYes, and that was a very important film for me career-wise, with two big stars like Lana Turner and John Garfield; later I also worked with his daughter Julie [“The Nativity,” 1978]. That car scene put me on the map. When my car breaks down, I step out as John Garfield offers to look under the hood. And then I say, ‘I’m going to wait standing up. It’s a hot day, that’s a leather seat, and I’ve got on a thin skirt’ [laughs].\n\nYou worked for several years at MGM, and also at Columbia. Was there a big difference if compare those two studios?\n\nLike night and day. Metro treated all their people really great; actors all had their own private dressing rooms. Mr. [Louis B.] Mayer was like a father to all of us. Columbia was very different, but I was there for only one year. I spent most of my career at MGM.\n\nOne of your MGM films was “Any Number Can Play” [1949] with Clark Gable. Did you know him before you made that film?\n\nI knew him socially before we did the film. I have a funny story; we were at a dinner party once, and he was sitting next to me. Lana Turner was there too; she always looked gorgeous with all her jewelry. Clark Gable asked me, ‘Are you admiring her jewelry?’ I said, ‘Yes, they’re very beautiful.’ Then he said, ‘You know, you got something much more important: you have jewels inside’ [laughs]. He was a nice man—a gentleman—and he always talked about Carole Lombard [Mr. Gable’s third wife who died in a plane crash in 1942]. He was still very much in love with her, and I don’t think he ever got over her. Most of the women he dated since her death, I think, had a slight resemblance to her—including me.\n\nWere you aware then that you were a part of an important era in film history?\n\nNo. We had no idea; we thought we were doing only B pictures, but some are very popular now. “Lady in the Lake,” for example, was a B movie, and it seems to work better when you see it on television. I don’t know why, but it looks great on a smaller screen. Robert Montgomery had tested a lot of actresses, but they all looked at him and not into the camera. But I did. And he asked me, ‘How come you looked at the camera and not at me?’ When I worked for radio, I was used to look at the microphone the whole time. In films, they always tell you to ignore the camera, and for “Lady in the Lake” you had to treat the camera as another actor. Since I was used to playing to the microphone for several years, it was almost natural for me to play to the camera. So that background helped me. To this day, I’m still very fond of that film.\n\nDid you live a life filled with glitter and glamour?\n\nNot at all. It was a very nice life and my acting career brings back nothing but fond memories, but in 1952 I sort of put it all aside after I had met Leo Fred, a doctor. I fell in love with him, and we got married in 1953. We were married for forty-two wonderful years until he passed away in 1995, and we have a wonderful daughter who also resides here in Woodland Hills. My career was fun—that’s maybe the best word to describe it, I think—but I decided to give it up when I got married. From then on, I didn’t take any long assignments and did mostly television, playing guest roles and some recurring roles in TV shows [including as Nurse Wilcox on the TV soap opera “Medical Center” from 1972-1976, shot at the old MGM studios]. So a life filled with glitter and glamour? No. My life away from the camera was a very happy one, a life of complete normalcy.\n\nWoodland Hills, California\n\nApril 13, 2004\n\nFILMS\n\nMAIN STREET AFTER DARK (1945) DIR Edward L.
