        "text": "Some remember her as \"Maisie\" in a series of movies made back in the 1940s. Others remember her as Susie in television's Private Secretary or as Katy in a later TV series, the Ann Sothern Show. But Ann Sothern never limited herself to comedy roles; it just seems that, for her, those parts turned up more often.\n\nHer career actually began in drama on the New York stage. But it was not long before she was off to Hollywood. After her film debut in 1934 in Let's Fall in Love, Ann Sothern became one of MGM's most dependable stars.\n\nThe Maisie series began in 1939, but it was not designed as a series. It was only after the fan mail poured in that the studio decided more Maisie adventures were in order, and over the next eight years Ann Sothern was cast in eight more Maisie films, nearly always with a different leading man.\n\nMs. Sothern made but one film in the '50s, devoting her time to television instead. Since 1960 she has been seen less often, but has appeared in a mix of film, television and stage productions.\n\nHer last film was 1987's The Whales of August, for which she received an Academy Award nomination. But her favorite film is 1949's Letter to Three Wives, in which she played one of the title roles. Thirty-five years later Letter to Three Wives was remade for television, and Ms. Sothern this time played the role of the mother. \"I liked coming back for that,\" she said.\n\nAfter years of living in the nation's movie capital, Ms. Sothern has forsaken California for Idaho, where she says \"we have beautiful, perfect air.\"\n\n\"If I work I go south, but I hate it,\" she said. \"Southern California is too dirty.\"\n\nShe has been married and divorced twice, and has a daughter, Tisha, by her second husband, Robert Sterling. Her daughter also lives in Idaho.\n\nLife in Idaho began for Ms. Sothern when she went to Sun Valley to ski. Eventually she bought a house and lived there for seven years. But after hurting her knee and back, she could no longer ski, and sold the house. That, she soon learned, was a mistake. \"I longed for this place,\" she said, \"where there is no smog, no anything. It's so beautiful.\" So it was back to Idaho, and it now is her permanent home and has been for the past seven years.\n\nShe says she spends much of her time painting. \"I'm having great success with it,\" she said. \"I do oils, and now I'm into pastels.\"\n\nHer subjects generally are native Americans, and she uses old black-and-white photographs as models. \"They have such wonderful faces,\" she said. A gallery in Ketchum, Idaho, near her home, is showing and selling her work now. \"I don't sell as a celebrity artist,\" she said. \"I sell as an artist.\"\n\nShe also participates in acting seminars for university students. \"I have a lot of experience,\" she said, \"and I think it's incumbent on those who've had years of experience in acting to pass on their knowledge.\"\n\nFifty years after that first Maisie movie was made, Ms. Sothern says she still enjoys watching them. \"I have them all,\" she said, \"and my friends borrow them. They were awfully cute, and I think they hold up awfully well.\"\n\nAs for today's movies, she takes a dimmer view. \"I just hate those crazy Terminators and Star Wars and all that junk,\" she said. \"I guess audiences just don't want to sit still for a play that has a story or a motive _ or just plain entertainment.\"\n\nBut she says there are exceptions. She liked Driving Miss Daisy, and she is ecstatic about Kevin Costner and his Dances With Wolves.\n\n\"I love him because he beat the system,\" she said. \"They wouldn't help him with Wolves, so he did it himself and he just wiped them out. I thought it was a fantastic picture. The almighty buck is the important thing in our business today, not quality _ and quality is what he stood up for, and he put up his own money to do it.\"\n\nDespite her relatively infrequent appearances today, Ms. Sothern, now 81, says she still gets \"lots of fan mail. I guess most people know where I am. I love hearing from people, and I always answer everybody.\""
