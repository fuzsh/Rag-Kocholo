        "text": "The thead on Anna May Wong got me thinking on other now forgotten movie stars ....\n\nNils Asther - Swedish silent star, gay?\n\nAnton Walbrook - perfect as Lermontov in Powell's The Red Shoes in 1948.\n\nKay Kendall - maybe because she died so young in 1959, her two with Cukor (Les Girls) and Minnelli (The Reluctant Debutante with husband Rex Harrison + Sandra Dee & John Saxon & Dame Angela in bitch mode) are still delicious fun now, plus the British comedy Genevieve.\n\nMabel Normand. She was the original star of Chaplin's films and a wonderful comedienne, also had her own production company, before it was the thing to do. Was good friends with Olive Thomas, who married Jack Pickford, Mary Pickford's brother. Thomas died in Paris, of an overdose of what is thought to have been the mercury pills for Jack's syphilis. Unknown if it was suicide. Thomas and Normand were really into cocaine and morphine.\n\nWas involved in the scandal of William Taylor Desmond, who was shot, and either Normand did it, or Mary Miles Minter or her mother did it. MMM was another forgotten actress, supposed to have been competition for Mary Pickford.\n\nYes, William Haines was a huge movie star, R32, at the time. I've seen several of his films in silent revival festivals, so they do exist, but they aren't going to get the same play as other silents, like anything with Louise Brooks, or made by Chaplin.\n\nThe film they used at the time disintegrated very quickly, and during the early years film, his heyday, film was seen as disposable. Why would anyone want to see an old picture when there are new ones, they thought. Plus, I think there was effort to ensure his pictures didn't make it. He refused a movie career for ANOTHER MAN.\n\nHe went on to have huge impact as an interior designer. He did all-white rooms first. It's a cliche now, but was a revelation back then. Carole Lombard always said he and Jimmy had the best marriage in Hollywood, and he had a wonderful second act, designing and loving/being loved.\n\nEleanor Parker - big star late 40's/early 50's, last appeared in thankless role as \"Elsa the Countess\" in \"The Sound of Music,\" though both her songs from the Broadway version were cut for the movie. Nominated several times for Best Actress Oscars, but never won. Just seems to have faded away.\n\nIrene Dunne has been mentioned, but I can't think of another actress who did it all: musicals, dramas, comedy, character parts. Big name in her day, practically typified the 30's, then married a mogul in Texas, as I recall, and never did anything else. (Of course, by that time, she had been doing only character roles; so I don't blame her.)\n\nGinger Rogers - barely any mention of her nowadays, except in conjunction with Fred Astaire, and no one cares about her \"dramatic\" side, even though she did win an Oscar for \"Kitty Foyle.\"\n\n(But then, Cliff Robertson also won an Oscar, and, like, who the fuck cares?)\n\nJoan Fontaine - pretty big in her day, but major roles didn't last long, and she balked at character parts\n\n[quote]A star is a larger than life personality who always plays himself/herself. Think Gable, Hepburn, Grant, Crawford, Monroe.\n\nI always thought the difference between a star and a character actor is that the star can bring in the money, he is the BO draw. But it has little to do with whether they can act or not, whether they can convincingly become a character or not.\n\nBrad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp are (were) stars only, not character actors\n\nPacino, RDJ, De Niro, Bette Davis are stars and character actors\n\nPaul Scofield, Edward Norton, Michelle Williams, Judi Dench are not stars but character actors\n\nI think the line is very blurry\n\nMost of these were character actors and in no way stars that brought people in to the box office.\n\nTwo real HUGE stars that are forgotten by just about everyone except for TCM junkies are Lana Turner and Paul Muni.\n\nYou can't say you love movies and not have seen the original Postman Always Rings Twice and Scarface.\n\nIn fact though I haven't seen the remake of Scarface a friend tells me the whole incredible violent twisted incest scene at the end of the original film which is truly amazing doesn't exist in the Pacino version.\n\nAnd Fields' The Bank Dick is one of the great American comedies and needs no excuse for age.\n\nTierney was the better actor, R139, but Brady was more commercially successful since Tierney drank himself out of being a real contender. By the late 50's Tierney was reduced to bit and small supporting parts in TV and mostly B movies, then was briefly resurgent in the 80's as Sergeant Jenkins in Hill Street Blues, in a supporting part in Prizzi's Honor, and thanks to Tarantino for Reservoir Dogs in '92. Brady costarred or had strong supporting roles from the late 40's through the late 60's in mainstream stuff (Johnny Guitar, Gentlemen Marry Brunettes) and starred in westerns as well as in some grade Z stuff later. He also starred in his own series (Shotgun Slade) from 1959-1961. By the 70's both Brady and Tierney were doing roughly the same, relegated to the margins. Brady succumbed to pulmonary fibrosis in 1985.\n\nR147, the picture is from a Modern Screen pictorial in September of 1951. Here's another pic of Brady.\n\n[quote] Joel Mccrea. I love his low-key, funny characters from when he was young. One of my favorite movies is The More The Merrier with Joel, Jean Arthur, and Charles Coburn. The plot is corny and tortured, but who cares! The acting is fun, as are the sets and the costumes.\n\nA total and complete babe, McCrea is wonderful in this movie. And Charles Coburn is great in his Oscar winning (Best Supporting Actor) role.\n\nI believe McCrea was a California guy, attended Hollywood High and was friends with the girls who were daughters of the studio moguls. The daughters all thought he was dreamy.\n\nHe was also great in Hitchcock's \"Foreign Correspondent\".\n\nJeanne Crain was indeed gorgeous, fresh and wholesome but was a terribly wooden actress, foisted onto directors by Fox chief Darryl Zanuck. She almost ruins A Letter to Three Wives as the first wife. Thank goodness she was too pregnant to accept the role of Eve Harrington.\n\nBut a big YES to Linda Darnell, the second wife of ALTTW. A brunette beauty whose smoldering charisma made up for any lack of acting talent.\n\nAlso forgotten: ALTTW's third wife Ann Sothern, who began in the 1930s as a mini Joan Blondell soubrette in B musicals, moved over to MGM in the 1940s to star in their hugely popular Maisie B films (occasionally breaking out in A musicals), but found real stardom on 1950s TV as Private Secretary's Susie McNamara and then as Katy O'Connor on the Ann Sothern Show in the early 1960s. And she capped off her career with an Oscar nomination in The Whales of August in 1987. Now that's a a long LONG career, and yet entirely forgotten today.\n\nRalston was only in those Republic pictures because of her involvement with Republic's studio head Herbert Yates, whom she eventually married. Her English was so bad that she had to learn her lines phonetically. After suffering through two films with her, John Wayne refused to do any more, convinced that costarring with her was bad for his career.\n\nInterviewed by Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show, Maureen Stapleton was asked what she did to make herself feel better when she knew she'd given a bad performance: \"I look through the TV Guide and try to find a Vera Hruba Ralston picture to watch because I know, no matter how bad a performance I may have given, I could NEVER be as bad as she was!\".\n\nJeanne Crain could have been so much more if she had been more interested in being a mega star. The parts that were written with her in mind, then turned down by her, are mind boggling. By her own admission she was just lazy and wanted to stay home with her kids. All six of them. That she had one after another. A couple, by her own admission, to get out of a commitment. She really was drop dead fucking gorgeous. In a lot of her pics she still looks very modern. She may be mostly forgotten but I find her very interesting.\n\nWell there you go. I knew it had to be something. I recently watched a double feature of her in A Portrait of Jenny and The Song of Bernadette. The intro was such a build up of her. Especially her beauty. The movies weren't bad but she wasn't worth the glowing intro and all I read about her that was just as glowing. Completely miscast in A Portrait of Jenny. I'm sure though there are others who have more expertise in old movies who will disagree with me. I was just completely underwhelmed.\n\nGene Nelson had a truly remarkable and varied career. He started off as a skater in Sonja Heine's Ice Shows, had two bits in two of her Fox movies, comes back to Fox briefly after the war where he appears in bits in MIRACLE ON 34th STREET and GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT then goes to Warners where he becomes their answer to Gene Kelly & Dan Dailey, partnering June Haver, Doris Day & Virginia Mayo, in musicals like THE DAUGHTER OF ROSIE O'GRADY, LULLABY OF BROADWAY, SHE'S WORKING HER WAY THROUGH COLLEGE, SHE'S BACK ON BROADWAY and PAINTING THE CLOUDS WITH SUNSHINE, appears in the film of OKLAHOMA as Will Parker, then becomes one of Hollywoods busiest hack directors for films and TV, directing a few Elvis movies, and episodes of everything from I DREAM OF JEANNIE, F-TROOP, STAR TREK, THE DONNA REED SHOW, THE MOD SQUAD, even GET CHRISTIE LOVE! and caps it all by creating the role of Buddy in the original Broadway cast of FOLLIES.\n\nHe was an exceptional dancer, one of Hollywoods best - but he lacked charisma, sex appeal and a winning singing voice. I think it also did not help him that he was also named Gene. I wish he had written an autobiography.\n\nI always thought a young Russell Crowe would have been a great choice to star in a movie about Wallace Reid.\n\nSupposedly Debra Winger was at one time to have starred in in movie about the life of Mabel Normand. I think she could probably qualify as a \"forgotten\" movie star. Hugely popular in silent comedy films (she was very athletic and was great in the frantically physical comedies back then) her career was ruined by her addiction to cocaine and her involvement in the William Taylor murder scandal. She was not really considered a suspect in his murder, but she was a close friend of his and just being associated with him damaged her reputation. She was considered a beauty, but I didn't really think she was. Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle was a frequent co-star of hers; the only thing he's remembered for is his involvement in the demise of Virginia Rappe, a young woman (NOT a slut, NOT a hooker, NOT pregnant, NOT riddled with VD, NOT dying of a botched abortion) who became stricken in his hotel room and later died. I don't think I've ever seen any movies of his on TCM. Maybe they showed something of his once, but he's one silent star you almost hear nothing about, unless it's in the context of the scandal that ruined his career as a movie star (he still found employment in movies, as a director).\n\nBrian Aherne, a Englishman who moved to the US and made movies here for decades. He wrote a WONDERFUL autobiography in the late 60s, then lived about 20 years longer.\n\nHe's probably best known to young audiences today from a Twilight Zone, the one about the old actor who goes through a door and gets to be with his young wife and colleagues again, back when he was a big star. The episode was titled \"The Trouble with Templeton\" and there's a folk/alt band that took that name.\n\nI read Brian Aherne's autobiography. I am the gayest man in the universe.\n\nr220: Blyth & McNulty were together for the rest of his long life.\n\nIn 1953, Blyth married obstetrician James McNulty, brother of singer Dennis Day, who had introduced them. The bridesmaids were actresses Joan Leslie, Jane Withers, and Betty Lynn. After her marriage, Blyth cut back somewhat to focus on raising their five children, Timothy Patrick (June 10, 1954); Maureen Ann (December 14, 1955); Kathleen Mary (December 23, 1957); Terence Grady (December 9, 1960); and Eileen Alana (April 10, 1963). In 1973, she and McNulty, both devout Catholics, were accorded the honorific rank of Lady and Knight of the Holy Sepulchre in a ceremony presided over by Cardinal Terence Cooke. McNulty died May 13, 2007, in La Jolla.\n\nAlthough Olivier seems not to have been a very nice person he is magnificent in Wuthering Heights, Carrie, and Richard lll.\n\nAnd as an old man he did remark how good Monroe was in Showgirl. Good? She wipes him off the screen. Jealous much Larry?\n\nAnd to be fair Monroe had many people hating her because of what her insecurities put them through.\n\nIt was only years later after the anguish was over did those same people praise her.\n\nPat O'Brien, Frank McHugh, and Lee Tracy were all over Hollywood for 30+ years each. Mostly at Warners, but really at every studio, and a ton of tv as well. Huge careers, and actors you'd know by face as each did many movie roles in mostly A pictures with big stars. They all also played leads themselves, but today not one of their names rings a bell. They were exactly the same age and all started at the same time in Hollywood during the first years of the talkies.\n\nPat O'Brien did nine films with his great friend James Cagney including the final film for both, \"Ragtime\".\n\nBeing that Ann Miller was brought I'll mention that I recently watched her interview with Robert Osborne.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how generous she was in her praise of Ginger Rogers and Lucille Ball.\n\nI always had the impression these two were very ambitious jealous people.\n\nBut Miller noted that when she was young at RKO and could have been a threat to them they watched out for her and helped her as if there was a sisterly affection as you see in the film Stagedoor.\n\nAlso Lucille Ball who was not one to suffer fools gladly as we say on DL thought Rogers mother was a stage mother to all of them in the best way possible watching out for the male sharks who were going to exploit them.\n\nBut on the other side of the coin I understand Rogers did not like Betty Grable who has a great reputation as being a generous colleague.\n\nYou can see a very young very pretty Grable as a back up singer to Ginger in Follow the Fleet.\n\nPoor Betty. In DuBarry Was a Lady she stopped the show with Porter's Give Him the Ooh La La.\n\nSo Merman took it from her. It's a tough business."
