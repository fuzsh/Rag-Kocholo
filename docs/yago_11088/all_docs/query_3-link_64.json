She made her film debut in 1929. Her first film roles were negligible and she headed for Broadway in 1930, quickly rising from small parts to leading roles. In 1933, she returned to Hollywood under contract to Columbia, this time under her stage name of Ann Sothern. After ten years in B pictures, she became a hit in the persona of a lighthearted heroine in a series of ten films, \"Maisie,\" where MGM put her talents to good use as a bouncy, scatterbrained blonde.\n\nSothern was not entirely fluff; she showed dramatic talent in \"Cry Havoc,\" 1943 and \"Letter to Three Wives,\" 1949. She starred in her own TV series, \"Private Secretary,\" 1953-1957, followed by \"The Ann Sothern Show,\" 1957-1961. She received an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress in \"The Whales of August,\" 1987.\n\nShe was married twice; to actors Roger Pryer, 1936-1942 and to Robert Sterling, 1943-1949. Their daughter, Tisha Sterling, born 10 December 1944, is an actress.\n\nShe died at 92, on 18 March 2001 of heart failure at her home in Ketchum, Idaho.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nfriend relationship with Cromwell, Richard (1910) (born 8 January 1910)\n\nparent->child relationship with Sterling, Tisha (born 10 December 1944)\n\nEvents\n\nWork : New Career 1929 (Film debut)\n\nWork : Gain social status 1930 (Broadway debut)\n\nRelationship : Marriage 1936 (First marriage Roger Pryer, six years)\n\nWork : Published/ Exhibited/ Released 1943 (Appeared in \"Cry Havoc\")\n\nRelationship : Marriage 1943 (Second marriage Robert Sterling, six years)\n\nFamily : Change in family responsibilities 10 December 1944 (Daughter Tisha born)\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nWork : Begin Major Project 1953 (Own TV series, four years)\n\nWork : Gain social status 1987 (Oscar nomination)\n\nDeath by Heart Attack 18 March 2001 (Age 92, heart failure)\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nSource Notes\n\nStephen Przybylowski quotes B.C. 5/2001.
