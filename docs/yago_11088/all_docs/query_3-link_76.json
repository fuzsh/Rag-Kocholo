Ronald Reagan was still pining for his ex-wife, Jane Wyman, in 1949, running up $750-a-month nightclub bills and throwing himself into his job as president of the Screen Actors Guild. Nancy Davis, proper Chicago debutante, was struggling to launch her own movie career while tongues wagged about her friendship with an MGM executive. In an excerpt from his new book, Bob Colacello lifts the veil on a courtship that was sparked by Hollywood’s anti-Communist frenzy and would change the political map forever.",

        "text": "The Little Brown Church in the Valley, a Disciples of Christ outpost on the southern fringe of the San Fernando Valley, is everything its name suggests: small, simple, picturesque. A rose-covered picket fence frames the church’s neatly trimmed lawn, and the dark-brown clapboard structure is topped by a squared-off steeple bearing a plain white wooden cross. Another unadorned wooden cross stands on the altar, a bare table with the words “In Remembrance of Me” carved along its front edge. The wall behind the altar is draped in red velveteen, there are only nine rows of pews, and the center aisle is just three feet wide. This is where Ronald Reagan, 41, and Nancy Davis, 30, were married on Tuesday, March 4, 1952, at five o’clock in the afternoon.\n\nThe only attendants were the couple’s witnesses, the actor William Holden and his wife, Ardis. Neither Reagan’s mother, Nelle, an active member of the Disciples of Christ, nor his older brother, Neil, was invited, though they both lived in Los Angeles. When I asked Nancy Reagan why the wedding was so small, she answered, “That was the way we wanted it.” Tellingly, she had convinced herself that her groom’s wishes were her own. “Came our wedding day,” Reagan wrote in his autobiography, Where’s the Rest of Me?, “and not one protest from Nancy over the fact that I cheated her out of the ceremony every girl deserves. . . I can only confess that at the time to even contemplate facing reporters and flashbulbs made me break out in a cold sweat.”\n\nReagan’s first marriage, to Jane Wyman 12 years earlier, had been lavishly covered by the columnists, who routinely referred to the two Warner Bros. stars as “the All-American couple.” Their wedding reception was held at the Beverly Hills home of Louella Parsons; the gossip columnist took a special interest in Reagan, for they both hailed from Dixon, Illinois. When that marriage began to fall apart in 1947—largely because Jane was “bored” by Ronnie’s growing involvement in Hollywood politics—Reagan came to resent the press for intruding into his private life, and he was determined to keep his second wedding off-limits.\n\nInstead of a wedding gown, Nancy wore a smart gray wool suit with white collar and cuffs from I. Magnin, the Beverly Hills department store, and the single strand of pearls her parents had given her for her debutante party, in 1939. Her dark hair was brushed back high off her forehead and crowned with a chic white-flowered hat and veil. Ronnie presented his bride with a bouquet of white tulips and orange blossoms when he picked her up at her Westwood apartment, where her German housekeeper, Frieda, had helped her dress. The brief nuptial service was performed by the Reverend John H. Wells, and Nancy later wrote that she was “so excited” she “went through the ceremony in a daze.”\n\nIf Ardis hadn’t arranged for a photographer to be at the Holdens’ house, a few miles away, there would be no visual record of the historic event. Ardis also had ordered a three-tiered wedding cake, and in the photograph of Ronnie and Nancy cutting it, they both look truly content. From the Holdens’, they drove to Beverly Hills, to the house of MGM publicist Ann Straus, who helped them prepare the press release announcing their wedding.\n\nAt some point they called Nelle Reagan in West Hollywood; Edith and Loyal Davis, Nancy’s mother, an actress turned socialite, and stepfather, a prominent neurosurgeon, in Chicago; and Ronnie’s children, Maureen, 11, and Michael, 7, at their boarding school in Palos Verdes, to say, “OK, it’s official,” as Maureen later wrote.\n\nThe happy twosome then drove off in Ronnie’s turquoise Cadillac convertible to the Mission Inn in Riverside, the Spanish-colonial-style hotel that was famous locally for hosting presidents going back to William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt. Richard and Pat Nixon had been married there in 1940. A plaque in the lobby commemorates the Reagans’ first night as man and wife:\n\nUpon arrival, a bouquet of red roses greeted the couple, compliments of the hotel with wishes for a long and successful union. Before continuing on to Phoenix the following morning, the Reagans gave the roses to another guest of the Inn—an elderly woman staying across the hall from the newlyweds.\n\nAfter a long day on dusty Route 10, Ronnie and Nancy checked into the Arizona Biltmore. The Davises arrived in Phoenix four days later. Reagan recalled, “Meeting her father, the doctor, wasn’t the easiest moment I ever had. After all, here was a man internationally renowned in the world of surgery, a fearless stickler for principle, and a man who could no more choose the easy path of expediency than he could rob the poor box. My fear lasted about a minute and a half after we met—which was as long as it took to find out he was a true humanitarian.”\n\nRonnie related to his new mother-in-law on a less elevated plane. They quickly discovered a shared fondness for off-color humor, and, according to Richard Davis, Nancy’s stepbrother, whenever they got together from then on “the first thing Edith would do was take Ronnie into the guest bedroom and lock the door. They would tell dirty jokes and stories for hours. . . She just adored him.”\n\nThe Davises weren’t staying at the hotel, as they had recently built a house in the adjacent Biltmore Estates, which was considered Phoenix’s best address. A couple who was also honeymooning at the Biltmore that month remembered the Davises showing up every afternoon to join Ronnie and Nancy at their poolside cabana. It was clear that Ronnie was impressed with his new in-laws, and not without reason. Two years earlier Loyal, in his mid-50s, had been elected to the board of regents of the American College of Surgeons, and by the end of the decade would become chairman—the most prestigious position in American surgery.\n\nFor her part, the 63-year-old Edith was a champion networker. A few months before her daughter’s wedding, while Loyal was giving a lecture at Oxford University, she was having tea with Queen Mother Mary in London. The Davises’ European tour had also included a visit with General Dwight Eisenhower, then commander of NATO, and his wife, Mamie, at their home outside Paris. Ronnie and Nancy received a congratulatory telegram from the Eisenhowers soon after their wedding.\n\nThe couple spent 10 sun-drenched days in Phoenix, leaving just in time for Ronnie to start shooting Tropic Zone with Rhonda Fleming at Paramount. “From the start, our marriage was like an adolescent’s dream of what a marriage should be,” Reagan wrote years later. “It was rich and full from the beginning, and it has gotten more so with each passing day. Nancy moved into my heart and replaced an emptiness that I’d been trying to ignore for a long time.”\n\nThree years earlier Nancy Davis had been a struggling actress in New York, albeit one who had graduated from Smith and had an apartment just off Beekman Place, around the corner from her mother’s old friends Lillian Gish and Katharine Hepburn. In January 1949 she received a call from her agent telling her that “someone from Metro”—meaning MGM, the biggest and best of the seven major Hollywood studios—had seen her in the television adaptation of a play called Ramshackle Inn and suggested that she come out to the Coast for a screen test. Nancy was so delighted that, as she said in her autobiography, Nancy, “I started packing before I hung up the phone.” She added proudly, “This was one opportunity that none of my family friends had anything to do with.”\n\nNonetheless, she immediately called her mother in Chicago, and Edith began working the phone, starting with a call to her pal Spencer Tracy, urging him to make sure that Nancy was handled with kid gloves. By mid-January, Edith and Loyal were in Phoenix for their annual winter vacation, and Nancy joined them. So did Spencer and Louise Tracy, who were with their good friend Benjamin Thau, MGM’s vice president in charge of talent.\n\nBenny Thau was 49 and still a bachelor. A short, heavyset man with thinning hair, he had started out in show business as a vaudeville booker and was made casting director of MGM by studio boss Louis B. Mayer in 1928. “From then on,” according to Mayer biographer Charles Higham, “Thau’s casting couch was the busiest in Hollywood.”\n\n“It was my impression that Benny was there to see Bob Rubin, who was with Metro in New York,” Nancy Reagan told me, referring to MGM’s East Coast vice president, J. Robert Rubin. “Bob and his wife stayed at the Biltmore every year and became good friends of my parents’.” Richard Davis told me that his father had taken an instant dislike to Thau and strongly disapproved of Edith’s backstage machinations on Nancy’s behalf. “Dr. Loyal was all for someone getting ahead on his or her own,” Davis said. “To have the inside track was against his principles. And he didn’t want his daughter to be mixed up with this man at all. I think my father thought this whole Hollywood thing was a little unsavory for his daughter.”\n\nA newspaper photograph of the Davises, Thau, and Louise Tracy at the opening of the Sombrero Playhouse confirms their presence in Phoenix. Nancy is not in the picture, but she saved it in her scrapbook, a rare piece of printed evidence linking her to a man she has never mentioned in any of her books or talked about on the record until now. Her silence only fueled suspicion that she had something to hide, and several previous biographers, unaware of their meeting in Phoenix, have written that Nancy met Thau on a blind date in New York shortly before her screen test and that she became his girlfriend in Hollywood.\n\nThis version of events was based largely on an interview Thau gave, at age 80, to Laurence Leamer, the first Reagan biographer to research Nancy’s background in some depth. Recalling a trip to New York in early 1949, Thau said that a friend had suggested, “If you want to take somebody out to a show, call Nancy Davis. She’s a nice girl who likes company.” Over dinner after the theater, Thau said, he uttered the magic words: “Nancy, why don’t you come out and make a screen test?”\n\nNancy Reagan told me there was no blind date—or love affair. “I never had dinner with Benny in New York,” she said. “When I came out to Los Angeles to do the test and stayed—yes, then I saw him, had dinner with him, and so on. . . I was not his girlfriend. He took a liking to me, that’s true . . . and I liked him as a friend. But that was it.”\n\nIn any event, Spencer Tracy had lined up another powerful MGM executive on Nancy’s behalf. Dore Schary, vice president in charge of production, had been brought over from RKO the previous year by Nicholas Schenk, the head of Loew’s Inc., MGM’s New York–based parent corporation, and it was generally thought that it was only a matter of time before he replaced the aging Louis B. Mayer. At some point before Nancy’s screen test, Tracy called Schary and recommended her. “The girl,” he said, “knows how to look like she’s really thinking when she’s onstage.”\n\nAccording to Kenneth Giniger, a publishing executive Nancy dated in New York, it was Schary “who brought her out to the Coast. That’s what I understood from her at the time.” However, there can be little doubt that meeting Thau in Phoenix advanced matters immeasurably. “You can say I helped her” was how Thau later summed up his role. “Stars like Norma Shearer, Elizabeth Taylor—she couldn’t compete with that. She was attractive, but not what you’d call beautiful. She [was] a very nice behaved girl.”\n\nNancy Davis’s screen test was like few others in the history of Hollywood. Ordinarily, tests were done by whatever studio technicians were available. Nancy’s was directed by George Cukor, one of MGM’s most important directors, and filmed by George Folsey, the celebrated cinematographer. Both were known for flattering female stars, Cukor so much that he was dubbed “the women’s director.” Fortunately for Nancy, he was extremely close to both Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, whose long-term love affair was conducted in a guesthouse Tracy lived in on the director’s estate. When Tracy asked him to direct Nancy’s test, Cukor found it hard to say no.\n\nOn Thau’s instructions, the studio’s drama coach, Lillian Burns, spent three weeks working with Nancy on her acting, voice, dancing, deportment, and appearance. As Lucille Ryman, the head of MGM’s talent department, told biographer Kitty Kelley, “I had told Lillian to give her extra special care because Benny had asked me to do the best I could with her.” Despite all her advantages, Nancy was so nervous on the day of the test that she had a friend of her mother’s, Natalie Moorhead Dunham, a retired actress, accompany her to the studio. “I remember Natalie standing there,” Nancy told MGM’s “hairdresser to the stars,” Sydney Guilaroff, years later, “while you were doing my hair, the two of you talking and her making suggestions and you saying what you thought and me just sitting there. I was terrified.”\n\nNancy read a scene from East Side, West Side, a high-society melodrama that was scheduled to begin shooting that summer. Howard Keel, a handsome newcomer who would soon become a star in Annie Get Your Gun, played opposite her. As Nancy remembered it, Cukor was “kind and understanding.” According to his biographer Emanuel Levy, Cukor “told the studio Nancy had no talent,” and would make nasty remarks about her for the rest of his life.\n\nMayer reportedly agreed with Cukor’s assessment, but the combination of Thau and Schary prevailed. On March 2, 1949, MGM signed Nancy Davis to a seven-year contract starting at $250 a week. “I grabbed it,” she later wrote. “I was finally earning a regular paycheck, which meant that I would no longer have to accept money from my parents.”\n\nNancy was almost immediately cast in Shadow on the Wall, a murder mystery starring Ann Sothern and Zachary Scott. It was a B movie, and they were B stars, but Nancy was given a featured role, playing a child psychiatrist. She barely had a day off before starting The Doctor and the Girl, in which she was typecast as the daughter of a Park Avenue neurosurgeon. Nancy’s role called for her to be patient, understanding, and smart as she tried to make peace between her domineering father, played by Charles Coburn, and her rebellious younger siblings, played by Glenn Ford and Gloria DeHaven.\n\nLife seemed to fall into place fairly easily for Nancy in her newly adopted city. She found a nicely furnished two-bedroom bungalow with a garden in Santa Monica. Van Johnson, one of MGM’s top leading men, and his wife, Evie, lived next door and kept an eye on her. Clark Gable took her to lunch at the studio, and John Huston, the son of Edith Davis’s old friend Walter Huston, gave a dinner party at Chasen’s to welcome her to town. “That was the first time I met Nancy,” recalled Leonora Hornblow, the wife of MGM producer Arthur Hornblow. “She was very nice. Un-actressy. Very simple, very good manners, cheerful, bright, charming.”\n\n“It was a very clubby feeling at Metro,” recalled Armand “Ardie” Deutsch, who met Nancy soon after she signed with the studio. “I don’t believe I ever took Nancy out on a quote-unquote date. But hosts would call and see if I could pick her up to come to dinner. And we got to be good friends. I developed an ability to make her laugh by just looking at her. One day we were going into a big soundstage—L. B. Mayer was going to lecture us on the evils of Communism or something of that sort—and Nancy and I happened to meet at the entrance. I said, ‘Nancy, don’t laugh. We could get fired.’ She said, ‘Why would I laugh?’ Well, she sat a few seats from me, and I called, ‘Nancy, Nancy.’ And she looked at me and I said, ‘Don’t laugh.’ Well, she was gone. She had to take out her handkerchief and hide her laughter.”\n\nArdie Deutsch had come to Hollywood the same way Nancy had: via the social route. A grandson of the founder of Sears, Roebuck, he had met Dore Schary at a dinner party in New York in 1946 and formed a fast friendship that led to a job as Schary’s assistant at RKO. When Schary jumped to MGM two years later, Deutsch jumped with him and became a producer. Within a few years’ time, Ardie would marry a stylish young widow named Harriet Simon, Nancy would marry Ronald Reagan, and the Deutsches would become charter members of what eventually would be known as the Reagan Group.\n\nOne of the hostesses who sometimes asked Deutsch to pick up Nancy was Dore Schary’s wife, Miriam. The Scharys were quite snobbish about their guest lists, and not every newly signed actress was asked to dinner at their home in Brentwood. Nancy was also taken up by Kitty LeRoy, the very social wife of the director Mervyn LeRoy. Kitty was from Chicago, and one of her three previous husbands was the owner of the Pump Room, where Edith Davis often held court. The LeRoys entertained in the grand manner at their house in Bel Air, and the guests almost always included MCA chairman Jules Stein and his wife, Doris. “Kitty saw herself as Nancy’s duenna,” says her stepdaughter, Linda LeRoy Janklow. “She tried to protect her and promote her socially and professionally.”\n\nWhen Mary Astor dropped out of East Side, West Side, Mervyn LeRoy’s next movie, he decided to offer her part to Nancy, and Dore Schary gave his O.K. Two weeks later the studio picked up her first six-month option, and she finally felt secure enough to move into an unfurnished apartment closer to work and have her belongings shipped out from New York.\n\nRichard Davis, who had just graduated from Princeton, went to visit his sister that summer. He told me he remembered two things about his stay: Katharine Hepburn lent him her beat-up old Ford so that he could drive to Santa Barbara to see a girlfriend, and one night he and Nancy had dinner at Benny Thau’s house in the Hollywood Hills. “It was all very much on the up-and-up,” Davis said. A butler served dinner, and Thau “didn’t paw Nancy or fawn over her. . . But you could see he was a controller—sort of reminiscent of a mafioso type.”\n\nNancy was seeing a lot of Thau, and rumors about their relationship were so widespread that the studio put out stories suggesting that Clark Gable, who had taken Nancy out a few times in New York, had been the hidden hand behind her “gilt-edged” screen test. Nothing was written about her evenings out with Thau—the studio made sure of that—but, according to MGM talent chief Lucille Ryman, “Benny took her to premieres and benefits and parties.” “People said he was her beau,” said Leonora Hornblow, noting the general perception at the time. “I don’t think this was a great passion on her part. It couldn’t have been. But as far as her career went, it didn’t hurt.” Thau’s receptionist later told Laurence Leamer that Nancy would visit his office every Saturday morning, presumably for a quick tryst. Nancy Reagan vehemently denied this—“I did not!”—and her brother backed her up: “I think Nancy would only go to bed with someone she was in love with,” he told me.\n\nAlong with the famous family friends and the instant A-list social life, Nancy’s closeness to Thau stirred up a tremendous amount of envy—the same kind of envy that would later follow her from the governor’s mansion in Sacramento to the White House. What’s more, her reputation as Thau’s paramour scared off younger, less powerful suitors. Amid all the studio-inspired fluff in her scrapbooks, there is not a single item about her dating anyone in Hollywood until November 1949, eight months after she arrived. And then her date was Ronald Reagan, a power in his own right as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and chairman of the Motion Picture Industry Council (M.P.I.C.), the alliance of studio, guild, and union chiefs that had been formed in the wake of the 1947 House Un-American Activities Committee (huac) hearings to restore Hollywood’s image and cleanse the industry of Communist influence.\n\nProduction on East Side, West Side began in September. Nancy was again cast close to type as the socialite wife of a New York press baron. She appeared in only two scenes, but they were with the film’s star, Barbara Stanwyck, and Mervyn LeRoy made sure Nancy had her fair share of close-ups. On October 28, 1949, The Hollywood Reporter published a list of “Communist sympathizers” who had signed an amicus curiae brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the convictions of Dalton Trumbo and John Howard Lawson, two of the Hollywood 10, the group of screenwriters and directors who had refused to cooperate with huac and been found guilty of contempt. To Nancy’s horror, her name was on the list. Since she had also been receiving unsolicited mail from left-wing organizations, she called LeRoy in a panic. “She drove over that evening to show me some of the propaganda that was being slipped under her door,” the director wrote in his memoir. “We [were] both anti-Communist, and strongly so, so the whole business was annoying.”\n\nBehind the klieg-lit premieres and glittery dinner parties, Hollywood was an increasingly divided and frightened community in late 1949: the right saw a Red under every bed, the left an F.B.I. agent; according to playwright Arthur Laurents, people even suspected their analysts of being government informers. The Los Angeles Times was running as many as 20 anti-Communist articles a day, and California state senator Jack Tenney, who chaired a mini-huac in the state capitol, had launched investigations into the political activities of Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, Gene Kelly, Gregory Peck, Frank Sinatra, and Nancy’s good friend Katharine Hepburn.\n\nGale Sondergaard, a well-regarded character actress who had a supporting role in East Side, West Side, was married to one of the Hollywood 10, director Herbert Biberman, and under investigation by both the F.B.I. and huac while the film was being shot. Sondergaard had signed the amicus curiae brief, and seeing her name on *The Hollywood Reporter’*s list made Nancy all the more nervous.\n\nLeRoy tried to reassure Nancy by telling her that the studio would take care of her problem, and on November 7, Louella Parsons ran an item declaring her “100 per cent American” and pointing out that there was another Nancy Davis, who supported “leftist theater.” Nancy was not satisfied, so LeRoy told her he would talk to his old friend SAG president Ronald Reagan and ask him to call her. “I had seen him in films,” she later wrote, “and, frankly, I had liked what I had seen. On the set the next day, Mervyn reported that Ronnie Reagan had checked me out . . . and the Guild would defend my name if it ever became necessary. I told Mervyn that was fine, but I was so worried I’d feel better if the Guild president would call me and explain it all to me.”\n\n“She had her heart set on meeting Ronnie,” LeRoy told a reporter years later. “I knew they’d make a great pair, so I went along with it and fixed them up.”\n\nThe phone rang soon after Nancy got home that afternoon. Reagan said he had an early call the next morning, but if she was free they could have a quick dinner to discuss her concerns. She told him it was awfully short notice and added that she too had an early call. “I didn’t, of course, but a girl has to have some pride,” she would write. “Two hours later, my first thought when I opened the door was, This is wonderful. He looks as good in person as he does on the screen!”\n\n“The door opened,” Reagan wrote in describing the same scene, “not on the expected fan magazine version of a starlet, but on a small, slender young lady with dark hair and a wide-spaced pair of hazel eyes that looked right at you and made you look back. Don’t get ahead of me: bells didn’t ring or skyrockets explode, although I think perhaps they did. It was just that I had buried the part of me where such things happened so deep, I couldn’t hear them.”\n\nA year and a half had passed since Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman were divorced, in June 1948, and although he put on his usual cheerful face, bachelorhood did not agree with him. To cope with his loneliness, he was going out too much, drinking too much, and spending too much—his nightclub bills alone were running $750 a month. And while he dated a succession of actresses, singers, and models, including Patricia Neal, Ann Sothern, and Ruth Roman, the word around town was that he was still obsessed with Wyman. Reagan would later brag to a buddy that he was sleeping with so many different women that he woke up one morning at the Garden of Allah and “couldn’t remember the name of the gal I was in bed with. I said, ‘Hey, I gotta get a grip here.’” But, according to Kitty Kelley, some of the women he was linked with in 1948 and 1949 described him as sexually “passive” and sometimes so drunk and heartbroken over Jane that he couldn’t perform.\n\n“I just can’t get it right,” Reagan told Doris Lilly, a buxom blonde who later became well known as the author of How to Meet a Millionaire. “I’m no good alone.” According to Lilly, Reagan proposed to her a few months after they met, but she turned him down because she knew he wasn’t in love—just desperate for someone “who was willing to make the big moves, push, be there, encourage him, never leave him alone for a moment. . . I couldn’t do it.”\n\nReagan continued to drive the Cadillac convertible Jane had given him before they split, and he moved back into the Londonderry Terrace apartment they had shared as newlyweds, claiming he couldn’t find anything else because of the postwar housing shortage. He and Jane dined together regularly to discuss the children, and she seemed to play with his hopes of reconciliation, telling reporters that she was wearing a dress he had given her to the October 1948 opening of her film Johnny Belinda, then announcing at a Hollywood dinner party the following month that her co-star “Lew Ayres is the love of my life.” Such behavior did little for Reagan’s self-confidence, and one can only wonder how he felt when his ex-wife, with Ayres at her side, won the best-actress Oscar in March 1949. By then she had already signed a new, 10-year contract from Warner Bros.\n\nReagan’s own situation at Warner was going from bad to worse. He had no films in theaters in 1948, and two of his three 1949 releases—John Loves Mary and Night unto Night—were flops, with only The Girl from Jones Beach, a cotton-candy comedy designed to show off shapely Virginia Mayo in a variety of bathing suits, scoring at the box office. “Ronnie wasn’t considered a big leading man then,” recalled Connie Wald, the widow of Warner’s top producer, Jerry Wald. “We used to see him after he broke up with Jane. He’d come over to the house, we’d go out to dinner, and the girls were after him like mad. I don’t think he was ever with anybody—seriously—until he went with Nancy. We always liked him so much. But as far as his career went, it was really going downhill. . . Who knows what he felt inside? As warm as he was, he was always a very distant person. Charming, but very private—that was Ronnie.”\n\nReagan was convinced that if only he could star in the kind of Western that had made John Wayne a top box-office draw his popularity would rebound. To please Jack Warner, he agreed to take the second male lead in The Hasty Heart, a wartime drama set in a military hospital, but on the condition that his next movie would be Ghost Mountain, a Western based on a short story he had persuaded the studio to buy. He spent four cold months filming in London—it was his first trip abroad, and he complained incessantly about the weather, the food, and the austerity policies of Britain’s Labour Party government—only to read in Variety on the day he returned that Ghost Mountain was being given to Errol Flynn.\n\nHurt and angry, Reagan refused to take his next assignment, a loan-out to Columbia. Lew Wasserman, his agent at MCA, let his client rage and sulk for a month, then persuaded him to accept a compromise: Reagan would make one picture a year for Warner for the remaining three years of his contract, his $150,000 annual salary would be cut in half, and he would be free to work for other studios. Even before the Warner deal was finalized, in May 1949, Wasserman announced that Universal had signed Reagan to a five-year, five-picture deal at $75,000 per picture.\n\nAs bad luck would have it, Reagan broke his right thigh in six places in a charity baseball game three days before he was to start shooting his first film for Universal, and was hospitalized for seven weeks. He had a hard time getting around on crutches when he was released, so Jane let him stay in her fully staffed new house in Holmby Hills while she was in London filming Stage Fright for Alfred Hitchcock. When she returned, he moved into his mother’s house, on Phyllis Avenue, for a few weeks. If anyone could make him feel better about himself, it was Nelle, his deeply religious mother, who in her late 60s still visited tuberculosis patients at the Olive View Sanitarium and showed them movies her son got for her from the studio.\n\nBy November, however, things were looking up. Jerry Wald came through with a part in what promised to be a good film, Storm Warning, about a courageous district attorney who busts the Ku Klux Klan in a southern town. On November 13, two days before his first date with Nancy, Reagan won a third term as SAG president by an overwhelming majority.\n\nRonnie arrived at Nancy’s apartment on the dot of 7:30, still using a pair of canes. She greeted him in a trim black dress with a crisp white collar, the kind of always right, good-taste classic she had favored ever since she graduated from private school in Chicago. He took her to LaRue’s, on the Sunset Strip. On the way, he came up with what he thought was an ideal solution for her name problem. “Have the studio change your name,” he said. “You would hardly be the first.”\n\n“I can’t do that,” she replied. “Nancy Davis is my name.”\n\n“Without her amplifying the statement by a single word,” he later wrote, “I knew that whether there were three or thirty Nancy Davises, they could do any name-changing that was going to be done.”\n\nReading their separate accounts of that first dinner, it is clear that he was impressed and she was mesmerized. “One of the things I liked about Ronnie right away was that he didn’t talk only about himself. . . He told me about the Guild, and why the actors’ union meant so much to him. He talked about his small ranch in the San Fernando Valley, about horses and their bloodlines; he was also a Civil War buff, and he knew a lot about wine. When he did talk about himself, he was personal without being too personal. The whole world knew that he had recently been divorced from Jane Wyman, but he didn’t go into details, and I wouldn’t have liked him if he had.”\n\nHe was fascinated to learn that her mother had been on Broadway and that the great actress Nazimova was her godmother. In talking about the miserable time he had had in London, he turned his misadventure into a long comedy routine about too little sunshine and too many Brussels sprouts.\n\nShe laughed at his stories, and he was so enchanted by her laugh that he asked if she’d like to catch Sophie Tucker’s act at Ciro’s, the nightclub just down the Strip, so that he could hear her laugh some more. They ended up staying for the second show—they even managed to dance despite his injured leg. It was almost three in the morning when he took her home, a little giddy perhaps, because, as he told his biographer Edmund Morris, the usually abstemious Nancy had helped him consume two bottles of champagne during the course of the evening.\n\n“Why do people fall in love? It’s almost impossible to say,” she reflected in the introduction to a book of his love letters that was published on their 48th wedding anniversary. “If you’re not a teenager or in your early twenties, you’ve gone on a lot of dates and met a lot of people. When the real thing comes along, you just know it. At least I did. . . I saw it clearly that very first night: He was everything I wanted.”\n\nYet after a spate of dates over the next few weeks—“Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis together again at Kings,” “Ronnie Reagan doing Mocambo with Nancy Davis,” “Ronnie Reagan’s romancing Nancy like mad”—Reagan pulled back. During most of 1950, the couple saw each other now and then, and both dated other people. “Ronnie was in no hurry to make a commitment,” Nancy later explained. “He had been burned in his first marriage, and the pain went deep.”\n\nEager to make up for lost time and income after being incapacitated for months, Reagan completed four films that year: Storm Warning at Warner, Louisa and the infamous Bedtime for Bonzo at Universal, and a Western, The Last Outpost, at Paramount. With the exception of Bonzo the chimpanzee, every one of his co-stars—including 18-year-old Piper Laurie in Louisa—was linked to him by the Hollywood press, but these “romances” lasted only as long as the shooting schedules. “He danced well and had a pleasant personality,” said Doris Day, who played opposite him in Storm Warning. “When he wasn’t dancing, he was talking. It really wasn’t conversation; it was, rather, talking at you, sort of long discourses on subjects that interested him. I remember telling him that he should be touring the country making speeches.”\n\nIf any woman had a hold on him in 1950, it was still Jane Wyman. Although one of the columns had Wyman and Lew Ayres “gaga” over each other as late as November 1949, by early 1950 he had decided not to marry her, and Jane once again focused her attentions on her ex-husband. For his 39th birthday, February 6, Reagan was honored by the Friars Club at a black-tie dinner in the ballroom of the Beverly Hills Hotel, and Wyman was among the 600 attendees. It was a big night for Reagan—Cecil B. DeMille and Pat O’Brien, his Knute Rockne, All American co-star, made speeches extolling his virtues; Al Jolson sang “Sonny Boy” and said he hoped his son would grow up “to be the kind of man Ronnie is.” Jane sat at a table close to the dais, beaming. A few nights later, when she received *Photoplay’*s Gold Medal in the same ballroom, Reagan had a ringside seat, and “clapped louder than any other person in the audience,” according to the magazine’s reporter, who added, “So many in town are still hoping that these two will reconcile.”\n\nNancy saw in the New Year with her family in Chicago. She must have been happy to get away: not only had Ronnie stopped calling, but a few days before she left, the studio announced that the part she viewed as her big chance and was sure she had—the female lead opposite Cary Grant in Crisis—was going to Paula Raymond. Another disappointment came as she arrived in Chicago: East Side, West Side opened in New York to generally favorable reviews but with nary a mention of her.\n\nUpon her return to Hollywood, she, too, started playing the field, dating the actors Robert Walker and Robert Stack and the playwright-producer Norman Krasna. Perhaps coincidentally (but probably not), Stack and Krasna were friends of Reagan’s. Nancy had met Stack—who would later play Eliot Ness on TV’s The Untouchables—when she arrived in town, with a letter of introduction from silent-screen star Colleen Moore, a family friend, to his mother, a grande dame of Los Angeles society. They didn’t really hit it off, and even now he bored her a bit, but she was pleased when he called and asked her out. She was more amused by Norman Krasna, who had a production deal at Warner with Jerry Wald and was bright, Jewish, and 12 years her senior. Krasna was crazy about her and proposed marriage soon after they started dating.\n\nShe became quite involved with Robert Walker, one of the most talented leading men on the MGM lot, and one of the most troubled. Three years older than Nancy, Walker had been married twice, to the movie star Jennifer Jones, who left him for producer David O. Selznick in 1945, and then in 1948, to director John Ford’s daughter, Barbara, who threw in the towel after five weeks, reportedly because he beat her up when he drank too much. When Nancy met him, he was putting his life back together after spending nearly a year at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, where he was treated for what The New York Times called “a severe psychological crackup.” He was still under psychiatric care and prohibited from drinking, and Nancy made it her mission to make sure he stayed sober. By April 1950 one Hollywood columnist was reporting, “Someone close to Bob tells me that he is happier with Nancy than he has been at any time since his parting from Jennifer Jones.”\n\nNancy’s best shot at stardom came that winter, when she was cast in Dore Schary’s pet project, The Next Voice You Hear, which was based on a magazine story that imagined how people would react if the voice of God suddenly came over the radio. The script focused on an Everyman named Joe Smith, who works in a Los Angeles aircraft factory, his pregnant wife, Mary, and their 11-year-old son, Johnny.\n\nBoth Schary and the director, William Wellman, felt strongly that the principal roles should be played by unfamiliar faces, not well-known stars who they thought would be less believable as such utterly average types. James Whitmore, whose second movie, directed by Wellman, had earned him a nomination as best supporting actor, was quickly cast as Joe Smith. Miriam Schary suggested Nancy for Mary. “This idea took a bit of getting used to,” Dore Schary wrote in Case History of a Movie. “This would be an exacting star role and Nancy had had only three small parts in pictures, and all of them had been on the ‘society’ side rather than a middle-class wife and mother. But in her favor was the fact that her looks and manner and inner self were ‘nice’ rather than cover-girl glamorous.”\n\nSchary asked her to read for the part with Whitmore—“I remember . . . her waiting next to Jim on one of the straight chairs in the anteroom, her fingers clasped tight in her lap to conceal the turbulent emotions which her enormous brown eyes betrayed.” He feared he might have to tell her “she wouldn’t do.” But he and Wellman were so impressed that they gave her the part without further ado.\n\n“It was the first starring role for both of us, and we worked intensely because [we] were very serious about our careers,” James Whitmore recalled. “Nancy was definitely not a frivolous person. She was delightful to work with, very affable, and had a good, hearty laugh. . . But we didn’t socialize off the set, and there was never any personal conversation about her boyfriends or anything like that. I do recall, though, that she held very strong political opinions, which weren’t exactly mine.”\n\nNancy’s role required great subtlety: although Joe Smith comes across as capable and good-natured, it is Mary who quietly holds the family together and gently directs her husband when he stumbles. On Wellman’s instructions, Nancy wore almost no makeup, combed her own hair, and was fitted with a wire-framed pregnancy pad under $12.95 maternity smocks.\n\n“Nancy Davis is considered a new ‘perfect wife’ type on the strength of her portrayal of James Whitmore’s spouse in The Next Voice You Hear,” the New York Herald Tribune reported on April 5. “M-G-M feels that she can be groomed to follow Myrna Loy, who first earned the title as Nora Charles in the ‘Thin Man’ series. Studio head Dore Schary has instructed M-G-M producers to be on the lookout for likely material for the young actress.”\n\nSchary himself immediately cast her as a small-town schoolteacher opposite Fredric March in It’s a Big Country, which Schary had co-written and was personally overseeing. In May, Nancy’s first movie, Shadow on the Wall, was released after nearly a year’s delay, with some very good notices for her. A few days later Mayer and his new wife, Lorena, hosted the first screening of The Next Voice You Hear, at their Benedict Canyon home. Nancy was so anxious she broke her string of pearls and spilled coffee on Bill Wellman’s wife. Happily, the early reviews in the trades were glowing. “The screen has never had a better example of husband-wife affection and understanding than that which Wellman builds between James Whitmore and Nancy Davis,” said The Hollywood Reporter. “And they play it to boff results.” Variety added, “Nancy Davis gives her role high realism and full polish.”\n\nThe studio flew Nancy to New York for 10 days of interviews and personal appearances before the June 29 opening, at Radio City Music Hall. She was thrilled to see her name on the marquee of Manhattan’s most prestigious movie house. *The New York Times’*s Bosley Crowther found Nancy “delightful,” and Time praised her for “a fine, attractive piece of well-balanced acting.” The critics were less enthusiastic about the film itself, and it did not do as well as Schary had hoped. Still, because he pushed it so hard, The Next Voice You Hear received tremendous coverage, and Nancy was highlighted in national publications ranging from Look and Seventeen to The American Magazine, which called her the “Silver-spooned starlet.”\n\nOn July 6, 1950, wearing a black dress, a white hat, and a big corsage, Nancy celebrated her 29th birthday with Benny Thau and the Mayers at the Cocoanut Grove. Although she was pleased to be seen with the head of the studio, all was not well between her and Benny. Despite his coldhearted reputation, the jaded old roué had fallen in love with his proper young protégée and was pressing her to marry him. This became increasingly problematic, especially after she started going out with other men, who were closer to her in age. When I asked her if her dates with Reagan, Walker, and Stack made Thau jealous, she snapped, “I don’t know. I was not his. . . He would have liked to have married me. I did not want to marry him. . . He was a strange little man, really. He gambled a lot. I think he gambled all his money away. I finally got through to him that the answer was no.”\n\nBefore his death in 1983, Thau was asked if he had wanted to marry Nancy. “I was friendly with her folks, and me being Jewish, I don’t know,” he answered. “I thought about it, but that’s all I did.”\n\nAccording to Richard Davis, it was Loyal who insisted that Nancy bring the Thau situation to a head. “Dr. Loyal laid down the law,” Davis said. “Nancy talked to Dr. Loyal very, very frequently, and he was very negative in terms of this man. It was for Nancy’s own good.”\n\nNancy saw a lot of her family that summer. In early July she went to San Francisco, where her parents were attending a medical convention. Later that month Richard Davis visited Nancy in her new two-bedroom duplex on Hilgard Avenue in Westwood. The highlight of that trip for him, he said, was accompanying her to a dinner party at Dinah Shore’s house, where he met Groucho Marx and golf champion Ben Hogan. In August, Nancy traveled to Chicago for Richard’s wedding to Shirley Hull, a socialite from suburban Wheaton. According to clippings in Nancy’s scrapbook, she had been “quite ill” before leaving Los Angeles, and “on reaching Chicago, collapsed of nervous exhaustion and had to be hospitalized.” She missed a private screening of The Next Voice You Hear that Edith had organized, but after being treated for a “vitamin deficiency,” she was released in time for the wedding. The studio said Nancy “wore herself to a frazzle plugging her film in New York,” but surely breaking with Benny Thau while juggling the fragile Robert Walker, the irrepressible Norman Krasna, and the elusive Ronald Reagan added to the strain.\n\nRonnie and Nancy had seen each other infrequently since that first rush of dates in late 1949, but the relationship took off again in the fall of 1950. In a photograph taken at the Ice Capades in September, Nancy looks wan and thin, and Reagan has his arm reassuringly around her shoulder: maybe he needed to feel she was weak as well as strong, in need of support as well as capable of giving it. In an interview a few days later, Louella Parsons asked Nancy, “Any one man in your life?” The gossip queen expected her to name Walker, but Nancy was noncommittal. “Not yet,” she answered. “I won’t be trite and say I’m married to my career, but that’s pretty much the truth.”\n\nOn October 2, Nancy started shooting Night into Morning with John Hodiak and Ray Milland—she played a “sturdy war widow” whose big scene involves talking Milland out of committing suicide—and later that month Reagan left for Tucson, where The Last Outpost was being filmed. He wrote her while he was on location—“Just a quick line. . . I’m balancing this on my knee while I wait to ride gallantly over another hill”—the first of hundreds of letters, postcards, and telegrams he would lavish on her until Alzheimer’s stole his gift for words. After he returned, there were more nights out—a cocktail party, a Friars Club roast, supper at the Sportsmen’s Lodge.\n\nYet, she continued to entertain proposals of marriage from Krasna—“Norman Krasna, alter ego of producer Jerry Wald, is so currazy about Nancy Davis that he’s already popped the all-important question,” Hollywood columnist Edith Gwynn reported on October 13. “Nancy and her whole family are thinking it over at the moment.” Maybe the Davises were just being practical: Krasna and Wald had recently signed a $50 million production deal with Howard Hughes at RKO. Or maybe Nancy was trying to make Reagan jealous. By mid-December she had turned Krasna down, and for Christmas, Ronnie gave her a gold key from Ruser Jewelers in Beverly Hills to congratulate her on getting her own dressing room at MGM.\n\nNancy worked to get closer to Reagan in other ways as well. She took a few riding lessons from Peter Lawford, the handsome British-born Metro actor and future brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. She put aside her distaste for alcohol and let herself have a weak cocktail or two when Ronnie took her out to dinner. “I’d drink a little,” she told me. “Nothing very strong like a martini—that would taste like gasoline to me. But some orange juice and vodka I would drink.”\n\nPerhaps the most important factor in drawing Reagan closer to Nancy was her appointment to fill a vacancy on the SAG board. The minutes from October 9, 1950, open with “President Reagan welcomed Nancy Davis to her first Board meeting.” The following November she was elected to a full three-year term. Although the SAG board was deeply involved in such controversial issues as loyalty oaths, Nancy Reagan told me, “I don’t remember any tension. Maybe it’s my memory, or maybe it’s that I was falling in love.”\n\nGoing on the board meant that Nancy saw Ronnie every Monday night, and after the meeting they would get a quick bite with Bill Holden, SAG’s first vice president. It also meant that Nancy witnessed firsthand, and over an extended period, how Reagan functioned as a leader: how he took advice, how he could be influenced, how he dealt with opposition, how he achieved a consensus, how he reached a decision. It would be an invaluable experience for what lay ahead, and by the time they got to Sacramento she may have had a clearer understanding of Reagan’s decision-making process and leadership style than he did.\n\nFor Reagan, the SAG presidency, which he held until 1952 (and again in 1959–60), was “a second full-time job.” Yet he relished every moment, from traveling to New York for meetings with the American Federation of Radio Actors about which union would represent the growing number of television performers to wrangling with the studio bosses to get actors a five-day workweek. On nights when he didn’t have a date, Reagan worked late at SAG headquarters, and he was often seen dining alone at Chasen’s, sipping a glass of wine while reviewing guild papers. At a time when his movie career was faltering, running the guild kept his profile high and boosted the ego he hid so well.\n\nClosely related to Reagan’s SAG duties were his activities as “a leader in the industry drive against Communists and their sympathizers,” in Nancy’s words. Although Reagan’s term as chairman of M.P.I.C. had expired in July, he remained on its executive board and met with State Department officials that fall to discuss ways in which the industry could help the government fight Communism overseas. He had also become heavily involved in the Crusade for Freedom, a new national organization supported by the recently created C.I.A. and headed by General Lucius Clay, the army commander who had organized the 1948–49 Berlin airlift.\n\nIn September 1950, the Crusade held mass rallies at every major Hollywood studio, at which speakers ranging from liberal producer Walter Wanger to the ultra-right-wing John Wayne called for the liberation of the Soviet-dominated nations of Eastern Europe. Reagan participated in these rallies, and fired off a telegram to General Clay pledging the support of SAG’s “more than 8,000 members . . . in the battle for men’s minds now being waged around the world.”\n\nBy then, after Mao Zedong’s takeover of China, the North Korean invasion of South Korea, and the arrest of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for giving atomic secrets to the Russians, anti-Communism had become something akin to a national religion. The movement’s wild-eyed ayatollah, Senator Joseph McCarthy, a Wisconsin Republican, had burst from obscurity in February 1950 with a fiery Lincoln Day speech accusing the State Department of harboring 205 “card-carrying Communists.”\n\nReagan, brought up a Democrat by his father, neither condemned nor praised McCarthy, perhaps because he had never targeted Hollywood. In the November 1950 election for a Senate seat from California, Reagan campaigned for Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, the wife of actor Melvyn Douglas, against Richard Nixon, who had made a name for himself on HUAC by helping to expose Alger Hiss, a former State Department official, as a Soviet spy, and who now accused Douglas of being “pink right down to her underwear.”\n\nThere is reason to believe, however, that Reagan’s loyalty to the Democratic Party, as well as to Douglas, was wavering—and that Nancy might have had something to do with that. Nancy Reagan told me, “I knew nothing about politics, and I wasn’t even registered when I met Ronnie.” Reagan, however, has written that his future wife “was more than disinterested in Leftist causes: she was violently opposed to such shenanigans.” Once, when I asked her if she believed that there was a Soviet-backed plan to infiltrate Hollywood, she declared without a moment’s thought, “Damn right there was. And they were trying to get their message into the movies.”\n\nIn her memoir, A Full Life, Helen Gahagan Douglas recalls that Nancy’s old acting mentor ZaSu Pitts, “who was livid on the subject of communism, made a particularly vicious speech about me.” Reagan biographer Anne Edwards quotes Pitts as referring to Douglas as “the Pink Lady who would allow the Communists to take over our land and our homes as well.” Unbeknownst to Douglas, Reagan was in the audience that night with Nancy, and he apparently liked what he heard. Robert Cummings, Reagan’s co-star in Kings Row, recalled Reagan phoning in the middle of the night to ask him to support Nixon. “We’re giving a party for him tomorrow night,” Reagan said. “Can you come?” “But isn’t he a Republican?,” Cummings asked. “I’ve switched,” said Reagan. “I sat down and made a list of the people I know, and the most admired people I know are Republicans.” Reagan would not formally change his party registration for another 12 years, but he never endorsed another Democrat.\n\nIn 1951, Reagan stepped up his anti-Communist activities. He took to the rubber-chicken circuit on behalf of the Crusade for Freedom and even made a short film for the organization that was “circulated to schools, civic groups, and churches around the country.” That spring another round of HUAC hearings on Communist influence in the film industry was endorsed by the boards of both SAG and M.P.I.C. The SAG board refused to support Gale Sondergaard—Nancy’s colleague from East Side, West Side—after she took an ad in Variety announcing she had been subpoenaed by the committee and intended to take the Fifth Amendment. Sondergaard wouldn’t make another movie until 1969. Actor Sterling Hayden, on the other hand, testified that “joining the party was the stupidest thing I ever did,” identified three industry associates as Communists, and called Reagan “a one-man battalion” against Communism in Hollywood. Hayden went right back to work at Twentieth Century Fox and was rewarded with an official statement from the SAG board congratulating him on “his honesty and frankness.”\n\n‘Ronnie Reagan . . . is a happy man these days,” Hedda Hopper reported that summer. “He has a new 350-acre ranch that he loves and it’s very obvious that he’s in love with Nancy Davis.” For months, the Hollywood press had been describing Ronnie and Nancy as an “everynightem,” predicting an imminent marriage or even an elopement. Reagan refused to take calls from reporters; Nancy would say only, “He hasn’t asked me yet.” That spring she had stopped seeing Robert Walker; in August he died from a sedative injection administered by a psychiatrist.\n\nRonnie and Nancy were occasionally photographed at premieres and nightclubs, and frequently dined at their favorite restaurant, Chasen’s, “especially on Tuesday nights, when the special was beef Belmont,” according to her. But they spent many more evenings at her apartment watching TV, or having quiet dinners at Bill and Ardis Holden’s house. Almost every Saturday, Ronnie invited Nancy to accompany him and the children to his new ranch in Malibu Canyon.\n\n“As far as we all knew at the time, she was the first woman in his life since Mother,” Maureen Reagan wrote in her memoir, First Father, First Daughter. “You could tell the two of them were crazy about each other. They weren’t lovey-dovey or anything like that, at least not in front of us kids, but they had a natural, easy way of being with each other that suggested that they belonged together.”\n\nMaureen took to her future stepmother immediately: “I especially liked Nancy because when the four of us were at the ranch, she would happily perform one of my most hated chores—whitewashing the thousands of feet of redwood fence that Dad was building.”\n\nLittle Michael liked the way Nancy would let him sit on her lap and would massage his back on their rides out to the ranch. “She was always cheerful, unlike Mom, who had constant mood shifts,” he wrote in his memoir, On the Outside Looking In. An unhappy child who cried himself to sleep most nights, Michael craved attention and stability. The previous year he had joined Maureen at the Chadwick School, in Palos Verdes; the children spent alternate weekends with Jane and Ronnie. While Michael tended to blame his mother for the divorce, he idolized his father: “Dad taught Maureen and me how to ride by leading us around the corral. He was a pussycat as a teacher, always calm and patient.”\n\nReagan had bought the Malibu Canyon property, a stretch of oak-covered hills a half-hour’s drive inland from the Pacific Coast Highway, for about $85,000 in March 1951. Curiously, he kept the name of his old ranch Yearling Row, which combined the titles of movies Jane and he had made—The Yearling and Kings Row. But, at Maureen’s suggestion, the first foal born at the new ranch, “a gorgeous dappled filly,” was named Nancy D.\n\nNot surprisingly, Jane and Nancy saw each other as rivals. Michael Reagan wrote that even in those early days the two women said “derogatory” things about each other—and, as children of broken marriages often do, he would agree with both of them. According to Nancy, Jane “convinced” Ronnie that he shouldn’t remarry before she did, “because it wouldn’t be good for the children.” Reagan-family friends told me that when Jane realized Ronnie was getting serious about Nancy she made one last play to get him back, telling him she’d like to start over again.\n\nIn the February 1951 issue of Modern Screen, Louella Parsons wrote, “Not long ago, I went to a dinner party at [Jane’s] home and Maureen came in to cut her birthday cake. Her mother and father stood by her side, polite to each other and respectful—so different from those gay kids who went barnstorming with me [on a publicity tour in 1939]. I turned away so they couldn’t see the tears in my eyes. Since then, when I see Janie, she seems self-sufficient, independent, and oh, so gay. But I know that not long ago she said to someone, ‘What’s the matter with me? I can’t seem to pick up the pieces of my life again. Will I ever find happiness ahead?’”\n\nReagan naïvely believed that the two women could get along, and even took Nancy to the premiere of Jane’s film The Blue Veil in September. Jane’s date was the Hollywood lawyer Greg Bautzer, a slick playboy who had previously romanced Lana Turner, Merle Oberon, and Ginger Rogers. Though Jane had hopes of marrying him, by the end of the year he had resumed his long-term, up-and-down relationship with Joan Crawford.\n\nMeanwhile, Ronnie took Nancy to meet his mother. The Disciples of Christ lay missionary and the Chicago Gold Coast princess would seem to have had little in common, but Nelle approved of Nancy’s sedate style and earnest personality. According to Nancy, Nelle “very quickly sized up the situation” between Ronnie and her. “You’re in love with him, aren’t you?,” Nelle asked Nancy, who admitted she was. “I thought so,” said Nelle.\n\nNancy introduced Ronnie to Edith and Loyal “over the telephone; I called my parents every Sunday, and Ronnie would get on and say hello.” On one of his trips to the East Coast he met Edith when he changed trains in Chicago. She brought Colleen Moore and Lillian Gish along to look him over. Both of them shared her concern that Nancy was in danger of never marrying. Moore declared that Reagan reminded her of Loyal, which Edith saw as a good sign, given Nancy’s adoration of her stepfather. “It will take,” Gish reportedly predicted.\n\nStill, two years after they had met and a year after they started going steady, Reagan needed more time.\n\nAs 1951 drew to a close, Nancy’s film career was all but over, and the man of her dreams still had not proposed. In September she was told that MGM would terminate her contract when her next option came up, in March 1952. It was clear by then that, while her talent was substantial, her star appeal was limited. Earlier in the year she had made her last two films for Metro, turning in her usual solid but uncharismatic performances, as James Whitmore’s wife (again) in Shadow in the Sky, and George Murphy’s wife in Talk About a Stranger. “After reading the script of that frightful picture,” Murphy later said, “Nancy and I both realized the studio wanted to get rid of us.”\n\nNancy decided not to go home for the holidays that year, preferring to stay close to Ronnie. “Ronnie brought over a small tree for my apartment,” she recalled, “and on Christmas Eve I finally got up the courage to ask him what was, for me, a very bold question: ‘Do you want me to wait for you?’ And he said, ‘Yes, I do.’”\n\nWhat was holding him back? According to Kitty Kelley, he was secretly seeing an actress named Christine Larson. He was also mired in his own career crisis and worried about his financial situation. On January 15, 1952, Universal cut his five-picture deal back to three after he rejected two scripts that he considered beneath him. Two weeks later he completed his 42nd and last movie for Warner Bros. For a change it was a picture he wanted to make—The Winning Team, in which he played Grover Cleveland Alexander, the troubled baseball great—but that was the end of his guaranteed annual income.\n\nBoth Ronnie and Nancy were now on their own, at a time when the studio system was collapsing all around them. The major film companies, battered on one side by the 1948 Supreme Court ruling forcing them to sell their lucrative theater chains and on the other by the ever rising popularity of television, were in a state of upheaval. Weekly movie attendance had plummeted from a postwar high of 100 million to half that by the early 1950s, and the studios were dropping contracts, slashing budgets, and cutting back production to stem their losses. The King of Hollywood, Louis B. Mayer, who more than anyone had created and upheld the old order, had finally been toppled by Dore Schary in June 1951.\n\nAccording to Nancy, sometime in January 1952 she told Ronnie that she was thinking of calling her agent to “see about getting a play in New York.” “I decided to give things a push” is how she later put it. “As I recall, he didn’t say anything, but he looked surprised. Not long afterward, while we were having dinner in our usual booth at Chasen’s, he said, ‘I think we ought to get married.’”\n\nShe quietly answered, “I think so, too.”\n\nA few nights later, during an M.P.I.C. meeting, Ronnie asked Bill Holden to be his best man. “It’s about time!” Holden blurted out.\n\nOn February 20, MGM issued a face-saving press release stating that Nancy had asked to be let out of her contract. That same evening, Ronnie called Loyal from Nancy’s apartment and asked for her hand in marriage. “Davis-Reagan Nuptials Set,” Louella Parsons proclaimed the next day, saying the wedding was scheduled for early March. “Ronnie stands for all that’s good in the industry,” added Louella about her old favorite from Dixon.\n\nOn February 27, MGM announced that the wedding would take place the following Tuesday at “some small church in Southern California.” The day after that, Nancy and Ronnie were photographed at Santa Monica City Hall getting their marriage license: Ronnie looked a little pale in a turtleneck and trench coat, Nancy radiant in a white-collared black dress, just like the one she had worn on their first date.\n\n“Thank God we found each other,” Nancy Reagan told me in 1997, when her husband was in an early stage of Alzheimer’s. “Our relationship was—is—unique. We were—are—very much in love.”\n\n*Excerpted from *Ronnie and Nancy: Their Path to the White House, by Bob Colacello, published by Warner Books; © 2004 by the author.\n\nInside the Reagan Diaries\n\n1 / 13"
