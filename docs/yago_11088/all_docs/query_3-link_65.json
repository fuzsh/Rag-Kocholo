The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m., in room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Jeff Sessions presiding. Present: Senators Sessions, Grassley, and Schumer. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF SESSIONS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA Senator Sessions. Good morning. We are delighted you are here today, and we have a nice agenda of nominees. I am glad to have as Ranking Member for this Committee today Senator Chuck Schumer with us. He is the Ranking Member of the Courts Subcommittee also, on which we have worked together on a number of issues. Our tradition, since we have Members of Congress here, would be to start with the Senate Members, and I see Senator Shelby, my colleague from Alabama, here and I know that you have some remarks to make about the nominee for the district court in Alabama. So I would recognize my colleague, Senator Richard Shelby. PRESENTATION OF R. DAVID PROCTOR, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, BY HON. RICHARD SHELBY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA Senator Shelby. Chairman, Senator Schumer, I will be very brief, but I think this is very important. I want to commend you, Mr. Chairman, for getting this hearing together. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the Committee today to introduce David Proctor, the President's nominee for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Concentrating in labor and employment law, David is an experienced and skilled attorney with an impressive record of trying cases in both the Federal and State courts. He has served a broad range of individual and corporate clients while also representing the State of Alabama, my State, in various matters. David is also active in the community, having served on the board of Alabama Goodwill Industries for a dozen years, while also remaining active in his church and the lives of his wife, Teresa, who is here with him today, and his three children. Luke is here; he is 12 years old. Jake is 8. And Shelly Grace is 5, but tomorrow, Mr. Chairman, will be her birthday; she will be 6 years old tomorrow. I and all who know David Proctor have high regard for his intellect and integrity, and I believe that he will make a fine addition to the Federal bench. Most importantly, Mr. Chairman, David Proctor is a man of the law. He understands and respects the constitutional role of the judiciary and specifically the role of the Federal courts in our legal system. I am confident that he would serve honorably and apply the law with impartiality and fairness and, thus, I support his confirmation without any reservation. Again, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for holding today's hearing on David Proctor's nomination. I urge the Committee to expeditiously report this nomination to the full Senate where we can hopefully move it. And, Mr. Chairman, I have some other meetings, and if I could leave at this time, I appreciate the time of both of you. Thanks. Senator Sessions. Thank you, Senator Shelby. Senator Grassley, would you like to make comments on the Iowa nominee? Senator Grassley. Yes, I sure do, obviously. Senator Sessions. You are sitting at that table. You could be sitting up here on my right where you normally sit on this Judiciary panel. Senator Grassley. Don't take it personally. Senator Sessions. All in all, it is better on this side than down there, normally. Trust me. PRESENTATION OF STEVEN M. COLLOTON, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT, BY HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Schumer. I am pleased to be here today to introduce Steve Colloton, who has been nominated by President Bush to be a Federal judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. He is an outstanding individual with an extensive record of public service and an impressive legal career. Steve Colloton will make an excellent Federal judge, and I am happy to support his nomination. He is here with family members and friends who are extremely proud of the work that he has done throughout his lifetime in the law and in community service, and they are here to support him. I have known some of the family for a long, long period of time, and he comes from a sound background that is also probably as much to do with his capabilities of being a good judge as his understanding of the law. He hails from Iowa City, Iowa, a graduate of Princeton and Yale Law School. I have never held that against him. [Laughter.] Senator Grassley. He went on to serve as a law clerk to Judge Laurence Silberman, U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C., and then as a law clerk to Hon. William Rehnquist, Chief Justice. After that, he worked as an attorney with the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department, and then as Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Iowa 8 years, with a brief detail as an associate independent counsel in the Office of Independent Counsel. He went on to become a partner in a prominent law firm in Des Moines where he managed a wide range of civil litigation. Steve Colloton returned to Government service right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks when he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to the position of U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Iowa. In that job, he has focused on making sure that we get the bad guys, but at the same time, he has made sure to protect the civil liberties that are so dear to us. In addition to fighting terrorism, Steve has focused his efforts on combating crime and enforcing drug laws. Specifically, under Steve Colloton's direction, the Iowa U.S. Attorney's office has worked hard to implement the Project Safe Neighborhood Program to reduce gun violence and has conducted extensive training for prosecutors and local law enforcement regarding the prohibition of firearms possession by domestic abusers. Steve Colloton has also made child support enforcement a top priority, forming a task force with State and Federal child support recovery workers and investigators. In addition to his stellar legal experience and remarkable public service, Steve Colloton has many strong supporters. Let me give you some examples of the support he has received from fellow Iowans. Twenty-seven past presidents of the Iowa State Bar wrote, ``The exceptional quality of Mr. Colloton's experience, together with its relevance to this position, uniquely qualifies him to represent Iowa on the United States Court of Appeals.'' A member of the Polk County Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs Association wrote, and I quote, ``Steve Colloton is the right choice for the Eighth Circuit judge position, and we fully endorse President Bush's nomination.'' The interim president of the University of Iowa wrote, and I quote, ``Mr. Colloton is a person of highest ethical standards and integrity and would be''--and I continue to quote then--``a superb member of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.'' Drake University Professor of Law Gregory Sisk wrote, ``Steve Colloton is one of the brightest and most thoughtful, hardworking, scholarly, and yet simultaneously practically minded attorneys likely to be nominated for any judicial position in this State.'' Even people who have worked on the other side of Steve Colloton think highly of him. For example, the attorney for Jim Guy Tucker, George Collins, wrote the Judiciary Committee, and I quote, ``I am convinced Steve Colloton is an honorable man and that when cases come before him, he will call them as he sees them. I do not think that a conservative litigant demonstrably as such will have any better chance before him than any other litigant. I believe that his cases will be decided on the law and, to the extent applicable, the facts. I respect Steve Colloton and hope that your Committee will also respect him and approve the appointment.'' These letters of support show how much confidence people have that Steve Colloton will make a great Federal judge. As I have said on many occasions in the past, there are a number of things that I look for when I assess whether an individual should be a Federal judge. I asked whether the judicial nominee has the requisite intellect, knowledge, integrity, and judicial temperament to serve on the Federal bench. In addition, I ask whether a particular judicial nominee will follow the law. That is the text and intent of the Constitution and the statutes ratified and enacted. I believe that Steve Colloton has all of these qualifications. I believe that he will follow the law and have a healthy respect for case precedent. And I also believe that he understands the role of a judge is to interpret the law rather than create it. In sum, I strongly believe that Steve Colloton will make an excellent judge of the Eighth Circuit. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this excellent candidate for the Federal bench. Senator Sessions. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Senator Harkin? PRESENTATION OF STEVEN M. COLLOTON, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT, BY HON. TOM HARKIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Harkin. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing, and I am pleased to be here with my Iowa colleagues to introduce Steve Colloton, who has been nominated to serve on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Steve Colloton, as my colleague has said, is a Yale Law School graduate, has been Iowa's U.S. Attorney in Des Moines since November of 2001. Before then, he practiced law for Belin, Lamson, McCormick, Zumbach, and Flynn in Des Moines. He has also served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Cedar Rapids for 6 years. Early in his legal career, he clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. As Senator Grassley has said, I have known his family in Iowa City for a number of years. Mr. Chairman, I supported Steve Colloton's nomination to be U.S. Attorney in 2001, and I urge the Committee to give his nomination to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals full and fair and expedient consideration. And I hope and I trust, Mr. Chairman, that this Committee and the United States Senate will treat Mr. Colloton more fairly and judiciously than it did the last nominee from the State of Iowa to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, Bonnie Campbell, who was not even given the privilege of a vote on the Senate floor. I hope this nominee will be treated more fairly. This concludes my statement, and I want to again thank the Chairman for holding this hearing. Senator Sessions. Thank you, Senator Harkin. Congressman Leach? PRESENTATION OF STEVEN M. COLLOTON, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT, BY HON. JIM LEACH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Representative Leach. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Schumer. Let me just say I am honored to be with my two colleagues from Iowa. I will be very brief. I come before the Committee not only as not a member of the body but not a member of the Judiciary Committee and not trained in the field of law. But I do want to give a sense of community support for Steve Colloton. Steve and I come from the same home town, myself more recently than he, but I have known Steve for some 20 years. He comes from one of the most respected families in Iowa. He as an individual has an exceedingly high intellect, great integrity, decency of judgment, fair-mindedness, common sense, respect for the law, and I am truly impressed with, in my knowledge of Steve, what a natural judicious temperament he has. I personally believe he is one of the strongest court nominees in memory and will embellish the court, and I would hope the Committee gives Steve every benefit of the doubt. Thank you all. Senator Sessions. Thank you, Congressman Leach, for those good words, and we appreciate your service to the country, and we are glad that you could join us today. Representative Myrick, it is a delight to have you with us. I know you want to share your thoughts about the nominee. PRESENTATION OF H. BRENT MCKNIGHT, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA, BY HON. SUE MYRICK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA Representative Myrick. Yes, thank you very much, Chairman and Senator Schumer. I appreciate the opportunity to be here. Both of our North Carolina Senators are out of town today, and so I have the honor of introducing to you Brent McKnight and his family and his friends. He has been nominated for a Federal judgeship in North Carolina from the Charlotte area. Brent has a very impressive resume, which I am sure you have seen and I will not go into detail, but I will just simply say to you he was a Rhodes Scholar, which I found very, very helpful for what he does right now. He is a friend in the sense that I have known Brent for a long time. He is one of those people that you would be very hard pressed to find anybody in our community who has bad things to say about him. He is extremely well respected throughout the community, not just the judicial community, because he currently serves as a judge, but the community as a whole. And he has impeccable character, and he has a very strong intellect. But the thing that impresses me about him is he has common sense as well, and he gets along very well with people. Brent relates well with people, which is very important with what he does as a judge. He also very carefully evaluates his opinions, and you will find again in our community that the people who work in the judicial system will tell you he is impartial in his decisions. He does what is best. So North Carolina would be very fortunate to have him as a Federal judge, and I hope this Committee will see its way able to send the nomination forward to the full Senate. And, again, I appreciate the opportunity to be here today, and I am going to take leave, if that is permissible with you. Senator Sessions. That will be fine, Representative Myrick. And I would note, I wonder if you would agree with Senator Elizabeth Dole, likewise highly complimentary of Mr. McKnight, and she submitted a statement for the record noting that, yes, he was a Rhodes Scholar, but perhaps even impressive to those in North Carolina, a Morehead Scholar at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, which is quite a prestigious event, too. Representative Myrick. Very, very important in our State and nationally. Thank you for mentioning that. Senator Sessions. Thank you very much. I will offer to put her statement in the record. Senator Schumer, would you like to make any opening comments? STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Senator Schumer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all of our colleagues in the House and Senate and you, Mr. Chairman, for holding these hearings. Before I begin, Senator Edwards could not be here to introduce Brent McKnight, and he expresses his regrets. And I would ask unanimous consent that his statement in favor of Mr. McKnight be put in the record. Senator Sessions. Without objection, yes. Senator Schumer. And also Senator Leahy's statement on the nominees be put in the record. Senator Sessions. Without objection, they will be made a part of the record. Senator Schumer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And now I want to thank you for holding this hearing today and agreeing to put the four New York nominees on the agenda. This is a fine day for New York. Normally we abide by a rule that requires a week from completion of paperwork to a nominee being eligible for a hearing. But you and Senator Leahy were willing to waive the rule so that these four outstanding nominees could appear before us today. The rule could be waived because these four nominees are not only excellent and moderate and diverse--those are my three standards for choosing judges--but because they have broad bipartisan support, including, most importantly, support from their two Senators, myself and Senator Clinton, the White House, and our Governor, Governor Pataki. So this is a bipartisan day, and that is how it ought to be when we choose judges. It is a stark contrast between the pitched battles we are fighting over nominees from other parts of the country. Stephen Robinson, Kevin Castel, Richard Holwell, and Sandra Feuerstein are very moderates. When you look at these four nominees' records, you have a hard time identifying even one remark that looks like it comes from an ideologue or an extremist. As I said, I do not believe ideologues, whether from the far left or the far right, are good fits for the bench. Ideologues tend to want to make the law, not interpret the law, as the Founding Fathers in their--I think this is a statement usually used in reference to the deity, but in their infinite wisdom. I am so impressing with the Founding Fathers the more I am around that it comes close. Anyway, that is what they wanted judges to do, interpret the law, not make law. And when you have people at the extremes, they feel with passion, God bless them, that is part of America. But they do not tend to make good judges because they want to impose their views on what the law should be. These judges meet my three criteria for the judges that I am involved in selecting: excellence, legal excellence, all four have it. Moderation, as I said, none are at the extremes. And diversity, they are not--each individual is not diverse, but as a group of four, they are quite diverse, Mr. Chairman. And so this gang of four gets high marks on all categories. Mr. Chairman, over the past several weeks, Governor Pataki, Counsel Gonzales, and I have been able to put the finishing touches on an agreement that ensures that all of New York's current and immediately forthcoming vacancies will be quickly filled and with judges who will do justice for all New Yorkers. If you compare our agreement to a trade between baseball teams, it is one of those deals where everyone wins, most particularly and most importantly, the people of New York. These four fine candidates will be followed by two more who have already been nominated, two we have all already agreed upon, and a fifth judge to be named later. And every one of them will be great additions to New York's Federal bench. Now, first I want to mention that Senator Clinton had a scheduling conflict that prevents her from being here today, but I have talked to her and I know she joins me in thanking the White House and Governor Pataki for not playing politics with New York's bench. And I am proud to have played a role in putting these four candidates on the court. Mr. Chairman, I would note that the Senate has now confirmed 138 of President Bush's judicial nominees. By the end of the week, it could add up to 145. And before the August recess, if we are lucky, all four of these New Yorkers will be confirmed, and our total for President Bush will be over 150. So for those keeping score back home, we have confirmed 150; we have blocked two. We may block a few more, but even so, Yankee fans would be envious of that kind of win-loss record. And we are doing pretty good this year, except for those Atlanta Braves. I don't know if you root for them from the State next door. Senator Sessions. Yes, I do. Senator Schumer. We have the next best record in baseball. Anyway, when you look at those numbers and you look at the quality of the nominees we have produced in New York, you have got proof positive there is no obstruction going on from our side of the aisle. We are working hard to fill the Federal judiciary with the best judges out there, but we have to draw the line at nominees who want to make law, not interpret it. These four nominees are the best evidence of what happens when a bipartisan process works right. Let me introduce each of them briefly and present their credentials to the Committee. Richard J. Holwell, 56, has practiced for over three decades as a litigation attorney with White and Case in New York, where he acts as the executive partner in charge of the firm's global litigation practice. Mr. Holwell is a 1967 graduate of Villanova University and a 1970 cum laude graduate of the Columbia Law School. After law school, he studied at Cambridge University on the Columbia-Cambridge fellowship in criminology, and he received a diploma in criminology from Cambridge University in 1971. He is currently a member of the American Bar Association, the New York State Bar Association, and the Law Society in London. He currently serves as chairperson of a panel of the New York State Supreme Court Departmental Disciplinary Committee. He is married, his wife is here, and he has two daughters. P. Kevin Castel celebrates his 53rd birthday in 2 weeks and was born in Jamaica, New York. That means Queens. He received his B.S. and J.D. both from St. John's, also in Queens. He began his professional career as a law clerk to Hon. Kevin Duffy in the Southern District of New York, before joining the law firm of Cahill, Gordon and Reindel, where he has been a partner since 1983, serving for several years as the firm's administrative partner. Over the years, Mr. Castel has been involved in an array of civic activities, including service on the Legal Aid Board of Directors. He and his wife, Patricia, have been married for 26 years, and they have two lovely daughters who we are fortunate to have with us here today. Stephen C. Robinson, 46, was born in Brooklyn--that is a very good credential, as far as I am concerned--and received both his B.A. and J.D. from Cornell. After spending several years in private practice, he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Mr. Robinson went on to spend a few years as managing director and associate general counsel of Kroll Associates before being tapped to be principal deputy counsel and special assistant to the Director of the FBI. From 1995 to 1998, he was counsel and chief compliance officer at Aetna Insurance. With the support from Senators Dodd and Lieberman, President Clinton then made this great New Yorker the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, where he served from 1998 to 2001. Mr. Robinson's wife, Kathleen Sullivan, was a professor at Yale Law School, and she passed away a few years ago. He has done--and I know this because I have talked with him personally about it--a wonderful job raising their daughter as a single dad, and I know that Kathleen would be tremendously proud of the job Stephen has done as a father and that she is smiling down on us today. And, finally, Sandra J. Feuerstein has spent 15 years as a judge in the courts of New York State. She has a distinguished record of judicial service in New York. Since 1999, Judge Feuerstein has served as an Associate Justice of the New York State Supreme Court Appellate Division. From 1994 to 1999, she served as a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court, and from 1987 to 1993 as a judge in the Nassau County District Court. Since 1998, Justice Feuerstein has served as an adjunct professor of law at Hofstra University School of Law. Prior to joining the State bench, Justice Feuerstein served for 2 years as a law clerk to Hon. Leo H. McGinity. He is administrative judge of the State Supreme Court in Nassau County. In addition to all that legal experience, she was a public school teacher in the New York State Public Schools from 1966 to 1971. She attended the University of Vermont and Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where she graduated cum laude. Justice Feuerstein has a distinguished record of service as a judge beyond her work on the bench. In addition to her other major roles, she has served as the president of the Nassau County Women's Bar Association and vice president of the New York State Women's Judges Association. Among other honors, she has been named Judge of the Year by the Long Beach Lawyers Association and Woman of the Year by the Merrick Chamber of Commerce. All four of the nominees--Stephen Robinson, Kevin Castel, Richard Holwell, and Sandra Feuerstein--are here with their families and friends. I want them all to know how proud we all are of their accomplishments and how honored I am to have played a role in their ascending to New York's Federal bench. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. PRESENTATION OF R. DAVID PROCTOR, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, BY HON. JEFF SESSIONS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA Senator Sessions. Thank you, Chuck, and those were good words indeed. And I know that the New York bench will benefit from having four new judges there. You have a lot of important cases in that district, and always have over the years, and it is always maintained a reputation of legal excellence. I hope that my colleague does not believe that an advocate who has fought for truth and justice is not a moderate and, therefore, cannot be a judge. But the nominee-- Senator Schumer. Any particular names in mind? Senator Sessions. Well, I have one in mind who I believe has stood firm for truth and justice, and I do not think he is in any way an ideologue or unqualified for the bench. But the nominee that I would like to call our attention to today and speak of highly is, maybe more in your style, not someone that has been involved politically or active in any way of that kind, but he has all the necessary traits to make an outstanding jurist on the Federal bench. I have known David Proctor for a number of years, and I have followed his career. He is one of the more respected lawyers in the Birmingham legal community and throughout the State, really, on all sides of the bar. He is a working, practicing lawyer. This is undoubtedly attributed to his excellent work ethic, honesty, and dedication to the rule of law. Attorneys that I have personally spoken with describe him as level-headed, fair-minded, trustworthy, and highly intelligent. He will prove to be an invaluable asset to the very busy Northern District of Alabama and to our country. David's past offers strong evidence of his future promise. He received his bachelor's degree from Carson-Newman. In 1986, he graduated with honors from the University of Tennessee School of Law, where he was a member of the Law Review. Immediately after graduating from school, he clerked for Hon. H. Emory Widener, Jr., on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. So, in addition to practicing in the Federal district courts, he has learned from firsthand experience the role a Federal judge must play in the appellate level and in maintaining a docket. This experience cannot be gleaned from any other source. After his clerkship, he spent 6 years with one of Alabama's finest law firms, Sirote and Permutt. Thereafter, he began his own firm, Lahr, Middlebrooks, Price and Proctor. For almost 20 years, David has served numerous clients and handled a wide range of challenging civil issues. David understands the Federal courtroom, having litigated approximately 300 cases in Federal court alone, some of which proceeded to verdict after full trial. From all these experiences, he has learned how lawyers and litigants should be treated at trial, and this is important to me. This conclusion is confirmed by the broad support David has earned for his nomination. I would like to quote from a letter submitted to me by one of the State's most successful trial lawyers, a strong Democrat, Jerry Beasley, a leading trial lawyer in the State and one of the most successful in the Nation. Although Mr. Proctor is a defense lawyer and was generally arguing in positions in opposition to Mr. Beasley, Mr. Beasley had this to say about David Proctor: ``I have known David Proctor for several years, and he will make an outstanding addition to the Federal bench. He is a man of high moral character and unquestioned integrity. His evenhanded temperament and keen knowledge of the law make him well suited for the position.'' The praise does not end there. Andrew Allen, a prominent civil rights lawyer in Birmingham, offered the following support: ``Although I am a lifelong Democrat and though I have litigated against David Proctor and his firm for almost 15 years, I write this letter on behalf of David in support of his nomination to serve as United States District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama. I strongly support his nomination because he is a man of high moral character, unquestioned integrity, keen intellect, even temperament, and superior work ethic.'' Those are good qualities in a judge. In sum, I believe he will make an outstanding addition to the Federal bench and that he will ensure an even playing field for all who come before him. He has deep roots in the community, which from 1989 to 2000 he served on the board of the Alabama Goodwill Industries, which provides employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. He has also volunteered countless pro bono hours for A Baby's Place, a home for HIV-positive children. Still other charitable organization have benefited from his dedication, and he is a deacon at Briarwood Presbyterian Church. His involvement in the community demonstrates a commitment to public welfare, a trait that will serve him well as a judge. He has a reputation for integrity, and I believe he will be a welcome addition to a bench that needs some additional support at this time. And I think he is a professional, is experienced, he works well with people. He can manage a caseload, as all of you judges are going to be called upon to do, and that strong work ethic. At one time, Mr. Chairman, you know, people thought you could be a Federal judge and maybe ease off into retirement. But it is a busy, tough job today. If you are not prepared to work, you do not need the job. All right. Anything else we need to do? I would call up-- well, no. First, U.S. Attorney Steve Colloton, since he is the court of appeals nominee, we will start with you first, if you will raise your right hand and take this oath. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Mr. Colloton. I do. Senator Sessions. All right. You may take a seat. If you would like to make an opening statement or introduce your family, we would be pleased to hear from you at this time. STATEMENT OF STEVEN M. COLLOTON, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT Mr. Colloton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no formal statement, but I do want to thank the Committee for convening this hearing. I would like to thank Senator Grassley and Senator Harkin and Congressman Leach for introducing me here this morning. I would, if I may, like to introduce my family. I am joined today by my wife, Deborah, my sisters, Laura and Ann. My parents came out from Iowa, John and Mary Ann Colloton, and my brother-in-law, Chip and my sister-in-law Wendy are here. Senator Sessions. Maybe they will stand for us. We just want to see you all. Senator Schumer. Very nice. Senator Sessions. We are glad you are here from Iowa, and other places I assume. Anything else? Mr. Colloton. No, that is all. Thank you for that opportunity, Mr. Chairman. [The biographical information of Mr. Colloton follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] Senator Sessions. Mr. Colloton, I appreciate the fact that you are a United States Attorney, having had that job myself for a number of years. Do you think that is a good experience for you for the office that you are seeking, the Court of Appeals? Mr. Colloton. I do, Senator. I thank you for the question and appreciate your comments about the United States Attorney job. It has been for me a fine experience in which I have been able to continue my contribution to public service. I have been privy, of course, to a wide range of litigation in both criminal and civil areas in that capacity, and I have also had a better chance to really understand the administration of justice from a management level in that capacity, so I think in all those ways it has been a helpful preparatory experience. Senator Sessions. Were you an Assistant United States Attorney in Iowa, there? Mr. Colloton. I was, Senator. Senator Sessions. How long? Mr. Colloton. From about 1991 to 1999, so about 8 years in the Northern District of Iowa, and now I am the United States Attorney in the Southern District, the partner district in the State. Senator Sessions. Of course, all of your practice as an Assistant United States Attorney was in Federal Court before Federal Judges, or virtually all of it. Tell me about any observations you have about things you would like to do that you think could make the legal system better? Do you have any insights that you have gained over the years? Mr. Colloton. Well, Senator, I think particularly in Iowa where we are fortunate to have a strong Federal bench and a good solid bar, I believe civility among attorneys, civility among the bar is an issue that's always important to lawyers, and I think that we have an opportunity to grow in that area through bar relationships, bench/bar relationships. So that is one area that I would focus on and suggest would be an important area. Senator Sessions. You were the appellate coordinator in the United States Attorney's Office in the Northern District when you were an assistant; is that correct, the appellate coordinator and handled appellate work while you were there? What court was that in, and do you think that experience would be beneficial to you in this job? Mr. Colloton. Yes, Senator, I do. During my service as an Assistant United States Attorney I ultimately was asked to serve in that capacity as the coordinator of appellate litigation for the U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Iowa. This was toward the end of my service in the late 1990's, and that gave me an opportunity to manage a range of litigation within the office to appear with some regularity before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which is the court to which I've been nominated, and I think that among other experiences I've had was a very useful and germane experience in preparing me for this potential service if I'm so fortunate to be approved. Senator Sessions. You have been a litigator. Do you think bringing that experience to the Court of Appeals might be helpful in some instances? Do you think in your experience, have there been times when you think the appellate court might not have quite captured the essence of what was occurring in the courtroom? Mr. Colloton. Well, far be it from me to say that about a court of appeals, Senator Sessions, but I do think that experience as a member of the practicing bar and for judges sometimes that come from the practicing bar can be an advantage for a court. I have been a practicing lawyer for several years now, and my focus has been on practicing law. It's been sort of a case-by-case incremental law practice, and I've been in the trenches, so to speak, in the District Courts practicing both in the Federal and to some extent in the State courts during my time in the private practice, but particularly in the Federal Courts, and I do hope that if I am fortunate enough to be approved that my recent experience as a member of the practicing bar would bring some insight to the Court of Appeals, yes. Senator Sessions. The Court of Appeals academic grade points are not always determinative in my view, but I think a lawyer who shows an aptitude and an interest and is able to handle written work as well as litigate, that is an asset to you on the Court of Appeals, and your background as an honors graduate from Princeton, and a Yale graduate, having clerked for Judge Silberman on the D.C. Circuit, having clerked for the Chief Justice of the United States, now Chief Justice Rehnquist. Your experience as an appellate lawyer in the U.S. Attorney's Office is a really special background for it, and I think from the reputation you have garnered as a man of integrity and character and good judgment, those combinations make you a really highly-qualified nominee. We are glad to have you. Mr. Colloton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for those kind words. I appreciate them. Senator Sessions. I congratulate Senator Grassley and Harkin and the President. Senator Schumer. Mr. Chairman, since I have to leave soon, in the interest of getting on to our next panel, I will just ask consent that I be allowed to submit some questions in writing. I congratulate the family on their pride in Mr. Colloton getting this far. Senator Sessions. It is a great honor, and one step below the Supreme Court. You will handle a lot of important cases and so far you have received extraordinary support and congratulations. The good news it here are no more questions, and I thank you very much. Mr. Colloton. Thank you very much. Thank you, Senator. Senator Sessions. Now we will have the next panel. I think we will have room for everybody, do we not? Senator Schumer. We do. Senator Sessions. If you will step up, all the district nominees. You have taken your seats. I now have to ask you to stand and take your oath. If you would raise your right hand and take this oath. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Mr. Castel. I do. Judge Feuerstein. I do. Mr. Holwell. I do. Judge McKnight. I do. Mr. Proctor. I do. Mr. Robinson. I do. Senator Sessions. Thank you very much. Senator Schumer, I know you have got some nominees here, people you care about, and I will yield to you at this time. Senator Schumer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will not ask long questions of the nominees. I will reserve the right to submit other questions in writing, but obviously, I am very familiar with four of the six and have heard good things about the other two. So I have one question for every nominee, and unfortunately, you have to answer it first-- Senator Sessions. I normally ask them to tell about their families or if you need to go first-- Senator Schumer. No, no. One of the joys I get is seeing the families, so I would like that. Senator Sessions. I guess we can start over here with Mr. Castel. If you want to give a brief opening statement or any comments, then introduce your family, that would be fine. STATEMENT OF P. KEVIN CASTEL, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK Mr. Castel. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am delighted that at this moment my wife, Patricia, and my daughter, Jeanne, are in New York following this on capitalhearings.org, and my young daughter, Allison is at camp. So I am here today on my own, and very happy to be here. I have no opening statement.

Judge Feuerstein? STATEMENT OF SANDRA J. FEUERSTEIN, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK Judge Feuerstein. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Senator Schumer. I have no formal opening statement, but I would like to welcome family and friends here today. First of all my mother, Judge Annette Elstein, who is an Immigration Judge; my husband, Albert, who was born in Brooklyn, Senator Schumer. That's good, right? [Laughter.] Judge Feuerstein. My terrific sons, Adam Feuerstein, who is here with his wife, Karen and my granddaughter, Arielle; my wonderful son, Seth, who's here with his wife Sharon and my grandsons. I think they're watching on closed circuit TV which is why it's quiet here. My grandsons Jacob and Joshua. My dear friends, Joan Katz, Phil and Joyce Glickman, Nan Weiner, Dale Twillis and Arlene Zalayet, have also accompanied me here today. Senator Sessions. Outstanding. We are glad that you are all here. Senator Schumer. If they are in the room, could we have them stand? I just like to see them. It is nice. Judge Feuerstein. Well, I would like you to see Arielle's dress because it's quite spectacular, but perhaps afterwards. Senator Schumer. Welcome. Senator Sessions. Thank you. Judge Feuerstein. Thank you.

I too have no prepared remarks, but I would like to introduce my beautiful wife of 32 years, Nancy; my two wonderful daughters, Ana and Eve; my sister-in-law Barbara; and my good friend, Hon. Paul Friedman, a District Court Judge here in the District of Columbia. Senator Sessions. Very good. If you would stand. We are delighted to have you with us.

I am honored to be here. I would like to thank Senators Edwards and Dole for their support, and Congressman Myrick for coming and speaking today. In addition, my wife, Beth, I would like to introduce, and my sons, Brent, Matthew and Stephen. This is their first introduction really to Washington, and they are learning a lot. I'm so proud and happy to have them here. In addition, my father-in-law and mother-in-law, Charles and Sherry Herion are here, as well as some friends. Howie and Debbie Donahoe and their sons Chris and C.J.; John and Carol Sittema; and Larry and Barbara Gregory. I hope I've got them all, and if we could-- Senator Sessions. Yes, if you would stand, we would appreciate it. It is good to see the boys there. I got to meet them earlier. Very good, thank you.

David Proctor. STATEMENT OF R. DAVID PROCTOR, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA Mr. Proctor. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Senator Schumer. My lovely wife, you've heard the line my better half, she's my better nine-tenths. Teresa is here, along with our children, Luke, Jake and Shelly Grace. And Senator Shelby was nice enough to mention Shelly's birthday is tomorrow. We are very pleased that she could be here for that. Also I have--my mother is unable to travel. She's in a retirement community in St. Petersburg, Florida, but her brother and sister, David Ames and Tootie Brown are here, along with David's wife, Carol, and Tootie's children Alec Brown and Liz Repass, who are my cousins, and Liz's son, John Thomas. They've traveled up from Salem, Virginia to be with us today. I would like to thank you. It's an honor and privilege to be here before you. Senator Sessions. Thank you. If you would please stand. Happy birthday, Shelly Grace. Since it is not today, I will not sing, not that I could. Senator Schumer. He would not sing tomorrow either, Shelly Grace.

Mr. Robinson. STATEMENT OF STEPHEN C. ROBINSON, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK Mr. Robinson. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senator Schumer, thank you so much for your kind remarks. In particular, thank you for mentioning my wife, who I hope is watching and would be proud, not so much that I'm here today, but mostly proud of our daughter, who has grown to be a fine young lady, and she is here with us today, Victoria. Unfortunately, my mother, Yvonne Robinson, and my two brothers, Guy and Chester, are not here today, but they are back at Brooklyn anxiously awaiting word on the events of today. I also would like to thank Senator Clinton and Senators Dodd and Lieberman for their long-term friendship and support that I've enjoyed over the years. Thank you very much and I'm very happy to be here. Senator Sessions. Very good. Mr. Robinson. If Victoria could just stand for a moment. Senator Sessions. Yes, excuse me. Hello. [The biographical information of Mr. Robinson follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] Senator Sessions. Senator Schumer? Senator Schumer. Thank you. I always enjoy seeing the families. It is a nice day. And to see the family's pride in their loved one before us is a wonderful thing. I just have one question. Before I do that, I do want to ask you something, Mr. Castel. I have a daughter, Allison, a young daughter, who is also in camp right now, so we share something in common. My daughter is 14. Mr. Castel. Mine is going to be 13 on September 7th, and she also plays CYO basketball, as I know your daughter does. Senator Schumer. Yes, she does. My daughter is a--I loved sports, but I was not--our team's motto in high school was: ``We may be small, but we are slow.'' [Laughter.] Senator Schumer. My daughter has a gift from God. She is just a great athlete, and she loves sports, and she is at sports camp actually up in the Catskills, Kutcher Sports Academy. Anyway, my one question for all the nominees is this, and unfortunately you have to answer it first, Mr. Castel. Can you name for me a judge, could be at your local level, could be at the national level, but a judge you admire and would hope to-- we all have role models we look up to as we move forward. That is what I would ask each of you. Mr. Castel. Well, I may be criticized for being someone who is trying to influence a future colleague, but Chief Judge Mike Mukasey in the Southern District is somebody who I do admire greatly. He has a terrific temperament. He has shown backbone and courage, and I have a very high regard for him, and I have a very high regard for him, and I have to quickly mention before--not to take Senators' time--but my own personal mentor, Hon. Kevin Thomas Duffy for whom I clerked and who is still sitting on the Southern District Bench. He has been a great influence on me. I thank you for the question, Senator. So I don't get into trouble, I want to mention that my brother-in-law, Kevin McLernon, has arrived in the Senate room and is here. Thank you. Senator Schumer. Thank you. Judge Feuerstein? Judge Feuerstein. I actually can't think of one person in particular, but there are certainly-- Senator Schumer. Name a few. Judge Feuerstein. There are attributes that I think go into making a good judge, and beyond being a good judge, a good person, and as far as judges go, I would have to say Judge Arthur Spatt, who sits in the Court which hopefully I will someday sit in; and Judge Leo McGinity, with whom I worked for many years, and who is now a colleague of mine on the appellate division. Judge Marie Santagata, and of course, as a role model for women, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in the Supreme Court. Senator Schumer. Mr. Holwell? Mr. Holwell. Thank you for the question, Senator. The two that stand out in my mind of the judges I've practiced before, I would have to mention Judge Gagliarti from the Southern District, who was a man of great demeanor and great measure, and Judge Weinfeld, also of the Southern District, who was a man of great intelligence and brilliance. Senator Schumer. Thank you. Judge McKnight? Judge McKnight. Thank you, Senator. If I could name a few as well? Senator Schumer. Please. Judge McKnight. In terms of a judge that's known nationally, someone I greatly admire, is Learned Hand, for his fidelity to the law and to the facts, his precision of analysis and language, his courage in his defense of liberty. At the local level, I've been a judge on the State Court as well as the Federal Court, and four come to mind. The Honorable Sam Ervin of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, again for his courage and fidelity to the law, and understanding of trials and how they work; James B. McMillan for his courage in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg integration; Graham Mullen, my chief, for his attention to the details of the Court as well as to the ideals of the Court; and Frank W. Snepp, who is now deceased, but on the North Carolina State Superior Court, who taught me much. Senator Schumer. Thank you. Mr. Proctor? Mr. Proctor. Yes. Senator Schumer, thank you for the question. I would have to start with Judge Widener, who I had the privilege of clerking for and who really introduced me to the Federal Court system. We've had two very high-quality chief judges, one retired now, Sam Pointer, who works at the Birmingham firm of Lightfoot, Franklin and White, and I look forward to hopefully, if I'm fortunate to be confirmed, to serve under Judge Clemon, who I've gotten to know quite well over the years in both a legal and a personal way. Senator Schumer. Mr. Robinson? Mr. Robinson. Thank you for the question, Senator Schumer. If I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would have the great honor of serving with several judges whom I have practiced before and have gotten to know and admire and respect greatly. One has been mentioned by Mr. Castel, Chief Judge Mike Mukasey. He's a judge who has shown great integrity, great courage in the work that he's done, and also a sense of humor and a good rapport with both colleagues on the bench and the practitioners before him. Secondly, I would mention Judge Keenan. As a young Assistant United States Attorney I was fortunate enough to try three cases before Judge Keenan, and admired the way he conducted his courtroom, and treated even a very green, young Assistant United States Attorney, and did one of the most impressive things that ever happened to me in my career. He actually asked me to bring my mother in so that he could talk to her in chambers without me present. And to this day I've never found out the content of that conversation, but at least I am happy to say my mother did not disown me. But I've always respected him, and the way he worked a courtroom, the way he treated counsel, and then both of their knowledge and fidelity to the law. And the last I'll mention is Judge Lynch, who was the Chief of the Criminal Division when I was an Assistant United States Attorney, and has been a person who has been very influential to me and very supportive of me. He's a giant intellect, a person of great integrity, and someone I admire greatly. Senator Schumer. Thank you. I want to thank you all. I apologize to the Chair and all of you that I have to be gone, but I congratulate all of you on your nominations and look forward to your confirmations. Mr. Castel. Thank you, Senator. Judge Feuerstein. Thank you, Senator. Mr. Holwell. Thank you, Senator. Mr. Proctor. Thank you, Senator. Mr. Robinson. Thank you, Senator. Senator Sessions. I just have a few questions I would ask you. One of the questions that is important is understanding the role of courts. This is the last opportunity the people just about, except when the matter is on the floor and then there are no questions to be asked, this is really the only chance in which the people get to ask you, will you be true to the constitutional framework? Because when a judge declares that the Constitution says something, you have a lifetime appointment, and it is difficult to deal with if that is not accurate. So we would like to know, do you understand the role of the court, what do you understand with regard to the role of the court and your responsibility to follow the law as it is existing, as exposed to expansive interpretations of the law? Mr. Castel. Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman. I think an affection for the rule of law in our constitutional system means a tremendous respect for the separation of powers. The role of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary have to be confined to their respective domains if our system is going to work. I would view my job, if I were confirmed, as not only following the precedent handed down from the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, but also at the same time, respecting the boundaries, not trying to play amateur legislator in any respect. I appreciate the question. It's a very important question, and I believe in the separation of powers doctrine down to my toes. Thank you very much. Senator Sessions. Thank you very much. Judge Judge Feuerstein. Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman. I agree with Mr. Castel as far as the separation of powers and following precedent. I presently sit on an appellate court, so I am really in favor of this. [Laughter.] Judge Feuerstein. I view a judge's role as interpreting and not creating law. That is the job of the legislature, and I believe that my career on the bench has demonstrated my execution of my duties with respect for separation of powers and precedent. And that would be the end of my statement. Thank you. Senator Sessions. Thank you. Mr. Holwell? Mr. Holwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with Mr. Castel and Judge Feuerstein. Judicial restraint surely ha to be the touchstone of the court system, particularly at the District Court level. No one elects a District Court Judge, and yet he sits or she sits for a lifetime, and it's particularly imperative for judges to understand that great power cannot be abused, and the deference must be paid to the other branches of the Government. Senator Sessions. Judge McKnight? Judge McKnight. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I am so fortunate as to be confirmed, it is my deep-seated belief, one that I've acted on in 14 years now as a judge, that the role of the judge is precisely to interpret the law as it is given to him or her, not to make law, not to expand beyond the law, not to play legislator, but to follow precedent, honestly, fairly, with integrity, to respect precedent that is established, to follow the statutes and give a precise and fair interpretation of the statutes, and do my best with what is given to me, to apply it to specific fact situations accurately and justly. Thank you. Senator Sessions. Thank you. Mr. Proctor? Mr. Proctor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When I clerked for Judge Widener, that was ingrained in my from the beginning of my legal career, that we should respect the rule of law; we should decide cases and controversies from the meaning of the Constitution and not try to legislate, and that we should seek the narrowest holding possible and not overwrite from the bench. And I'm committed to virtually all the things I've heard my co-panelists say, but I think you know from our conversations before, I am committed deeply to the rule of law and the fact that a judge has an inherently limited Federal judicial power invested in him by the Constitution, and I would uphold that duty if I was so fortunate to be confirmed. Senator Sessions. Very good. Mr. Robinson? Mr. Robinson. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for that question. I think it is an important one, and let me start briefly by saying I agree with my colleagues. I have a deep and abiding respect for the rule of law. I have tried to show that and live that as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, as Deputy General Counsel of the FBI, and again as a U.S. Attorney. I believe that the way this system works well is for judges to follow the precedent that has been set before them and to rule narrowly, as narrowly as possible, with an eye towards the law as it has been set forth. We are not legislators. We have not been elected. We have not chosen that path in life. But we have chosen to participate in an executive--I mean in a judicial, in a co-equal branch of the Government, and that's important, but it's also important for us to understand our role in that process, and that is not to legislate, but to interpret and follow the law. Senator Sessions. I think you have answered that well. There will be temptations. There will be times when somebody would want you to rule in a way that you think would really be good public policy perhaps, but it is not supported by the law, and the more I look at the strength of the United States, the more I am convinced that this Nation's fundamental power and ability to grow and progress is based on the rule of law. You look at the countries like Hong Kong, that have a legal system, how they flourish when other countries around them are not doing well. New York, for example, has these complex commercial cases affecting the whole world a lot of times, and plus we are having those all over the country now, in Alabama and everywhere else. But people invest here. They believe in doing business with Americans. We are able to be competitive in the world marketplace because people think they can get justice in our courts, and they are not worried about an investment. You think about the idea of an average citizen can borrow $150,000 to buy a house and pay it back at less than 6 percent interest over 30 years, this is a tribute to our legal system. It has really been a source of our strength, and I do believe that some opinions in recent years have gone beyond a legitimate interpretation of our law, and I think it undermines public respect for law, and if the public ever believes that judges are nothing more than politicians too like us, then I think that great respect and reservoir of respect that exists could be undermined. Let me ask you this, now briefly, each one of you. The challenge of a Federal District Judge is great. There are a lot of pressures and a lot of intensity, a lot of deadlines that have to be met. Frequently there are injunctions and things that require weekends and nights. The backlog is there. Clients have large amounts of money at stake. Are you willing to see yourself as a servant to the system, and if need be, put in extraordinary hours and manage your docket effectively? It is certainly not an easy job. Do you have any thoughts about that, Mr. Castel? Mr. Castel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have some thoughts. First of all, I think, and I probably can say this about my co-panelists, you don't get to this table unless you have an incredible work ethic, and I think you really particularly--my familiarity tends to be more with the Federal Courts in New York. It is a crushing load. It is hard work. I've told my family, because they've asked the question, you know, will I be working harder or less hard than I am now, a partner in a law firm. My answer is probably over at least the next 3 years until I get my sea legs, I anticipate probably working harder, but it's responsibility that I eagerly embrace. Thank you, Senator. Senator Sessions. Thank you. Judge Feuerstein? Judge Feuerstein. Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman. I presently sit in what I believe is the busiest appellate court in the country, and so I am used to work, and as Mr. Castel has said, I believe everyone on this panel probably is. I have never shirked it. I look forward to the challenges if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed. And frankly, when you love what you do, it's not a hardship. Senator Sessions. Well said. Mr. Holwell? Mr. Holwell. Mr. Chairman, I agree with a statement you made earlier, that if it were ever true, it certainly is not the case that one can retire to the bench. The extraordinary demands on the judiciary can only be met by people continuing to put their shoulder to the wheel of labor. I think what Mr. Castel said is correct, we've all done that to get this far, and should we be so lucky as to be confirmed by the Senate, we will continue in that vein. Senator Sessions. Good. Judge McKnight? Judge McKnight. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question. In my time on the bench I have seen the importance of it over and over again. When I was a State judge we have a very overburdened court system in Charlotte, and I worked hard to manage the docket there and did so. Likewise on the Federal bench as a Magistrate Judge, we have one of the highest weighted caseloads in the country, and I have, I believe, effectively manage the cases. But let me just say this. My commitment is to work hard, to put in the hours and give each case the time and thought it deserves, and I will do so. Senator Sessions. Judge McKnight, do you have any comments on the role of the magistrate for your fellow judges to be? I know in the Southern District of Alabama, where I practiced for a number of years, the magistrates were given a lot of work and they responded very well. It is a prestigious position, and you got quality nominees and they did quality work. Do you think some judges, district judges around the country could use magistrates more effectively? Judge McKnight. Thank you, sir. I believe so. I have been very fortunate in the Western District, that the District Judges who reviewed and supervised my work, have allowed me to work to the full extent of the statute, which has been expanded in terms of the responsibility of the magistrate judge several times since 1980, and I would encourage judges to make full use of it. It, of course, takes loads off of them and gives them time to focus on their role, what is important. And yes, sir, I would underscore their role as strongly as I could. Senator Sessions. Mr. Proctor? Mr. Proctor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think the reason that I have sought this position is a call to service, a call to service of my country, the people of Alabama and my colleagues in the bar. I plan to bring the diligence and work ethic I've demonstrated as a lawyer and that I've been taught by my partners, such as Richard Lehr and David Middlebrooks, and from some of my former partners at my old firm, like Steve Brickman and Brad Sklar. I hope to bring that diligence and work ethic to the bench. And I certainly agree with your comment that you've shared with me before, that this is not a retirement job, this a roll-your-sleeves-up-and-get-to-work job. Senator Sessions. You have that reputation as a worker. Mr. Robinson? Mr. Robinson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with my colleagues again. I have always been a person who has worked extremely hard, in large part because I enjoy that, and that's what the jobs that I've been in require. And should I be fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would pledge that the question for me will not be am I putting in the hours that I will work diligently so that everyone who appears before the bench has the confidence that their case has been heard, that their voice has been not only listened to but heard by the Court, and that a careful and thoughtful process has been engaged in and a decision reached. And I think that that's important, not only for myself going forward in the job, but for the confidence that litigants and parties have before the Court. So I think that's extremely important that we all do that, and have tremendous faith, having gotten to know my colleagues at the table recently, that we will all do that. Senator Sessions. I agree. This is a first rate panel. We are glad you are here. There are litigants that have filed motions that ought to be granted, and the sooner they are granted, the better things happen in the legal system. I know you will do that. Your backgrounds have held up. You have been investigated by your bar association and by the President and by the FBI, by the staff of the U.S. Senate, and you have passed a whole lot of hurdles to get here. I think each one of you represent the best of the legal system of America. I look forward to your confirmations. If there is nothing else at this point, we will be adjourned. But I will note that the record will be open for further questions that you may receive in the form of written questions. Anything else? If not, we are adjourned.

The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:17 a.m., in room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Orrin G. Hatch presiding. Present: Senators Hatch, Specter, Sessions, Graham, Leahy, Feinstein, Feingold, Durbin, and Edwards. Chairman Hatch. I apologize for being a little bit late. I have been in since 6:00 and I am still having trouble keeping up with it all, and I apologize to my colleagues who have had to wait. I apologize to my colleagues on this Committee. Senator Leahy. I can vouch for the fact that he was here at 6:00. I looked out the window and I saw him coming in. [Laughter.] Chairman Hatch. Leahy does not even get out of bed at 6:00, I have to tell you. I have been around him. I cannot blame him. I am going to forego, or at least hold off on my statement. Should we hold off on our statements so that we can accommodate our fellow Senators? If you do not mind, we will start from your right and go to the left, and start with you, Fritz. Senator Hollings, we will call on you to speak first, then John Warner. Excuse me. We are going to have Senator Feinstein go first because she has an amendment on the floor and has asked to speak first. Senators Levin and Stabenow have asked for 45 minutes to speak and have agreed to follow all of the other Senators. I will ask them and Congressman Rogers to come to the witness table. You are due on the floor too and you want to speak. So we will go with Senator Feinstein, then with Senator Specter, and then we will go to Senator Hollings. PRESENTATION OF LARRY ALAN BURNS AND DANA MAKOTO SABRAW, NOMINEES TO BE DISTRICT JUDGES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, BY HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Feinstein. Mr. Chairman, let me thank you very much for this courtesy. I really do appreciate it, and I will try to be very brief. I am very pleased to introduce to the Committee two Southern District of California nominees, Larry Burns and Dana Sabraw. These nominees will fill two of the five new Southern District judgeships created by the Department of Justice reauthorization legislation enacted last year. The screening committee submitted their names to the President in March, who then nominated them in May. I think their presence here really represents a very successful conclusion to what was a multi- year effort to address a tremendous caseload crisis in the San Diego area. I would very much like to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member without whom these judgeships would not have been created, so thank you very, very much. Until these judgeships were authorized, the Southern District of California had a weighted caseload average of approximately a thousand cases per judge. This is the highest in the country and more than twice the national average. I hope we can confirm Judge Sabraw and Judge Burns as quickly as possible because the District truly needs them. They have a very heavy caseload of complex and heavy cases including some large narcotics cases. I am pleased to report that both judges come unanimously endorsed by the California Bipartisan Judicial Selection Committee. They are two more examples of how well this process can work if Democrats and Republicans approach the issue collaboratively. Judge Burns is joined at today's hearing by his wife Kristi and his two sons, Andrew, 17 and Adam, 15. Could you all stand up so the Committee could acknowledge your presence? We are delighted to have you here. Thank you very much. Judge Burns is a lifetime California resident, graduated from the University of San Diego Law School in 1979. The American Bar Association unanimously rated him well qualified, its highest rating. Since 1997 he served as a magistrate in the Southern District where he has garnered rave reviews. Notably, he received the Judge of the Year award from the Consumer Trial Lawyers of San Diego. Prior to his servi"
