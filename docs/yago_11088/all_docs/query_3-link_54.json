        "text": "American actress with a film debut in 1929. Her first film roles were negligible and she headed for Broadway in 1930, quickly rising from small parts to leading roles. In 1933, she returned to Hollywood under contract to Columbia, this time under her stage name of Ann Sothern. After ten years in B pictures, she became a hit in the persona of a lighthearted heroine in a series of ten films, \"Maisie,\" where MGM put her talents to good use as a bouncy, scatterbrained blonde. Sothern was not entirely fluff; she showed dramatic talent in \"Cry Havoc,\" 1943 and \"Letter to Three Wives,\" 1949. She starred in her own TV series, \"Private Secretary,\" 1953-57, followed by \"The Ann Sothern Show,\" 1957-61. She received an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress in \"The Whales of August,\" 1987. She was married twice; to actors Roger Pryer, 1936-42 and to Robert Sterling, 1943-49. Their daughter, Tisha Sterling, born 12/10/1944, is an actress. She died at 92, on 3/18/2001 of heart failure at her home in Ketchum, ID. Link to Wikipedia biography"
