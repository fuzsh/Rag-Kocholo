        "text": "Special Feature:\n\nFun with Dick and Jane\n\nA Broadcasting Veteran Remembers Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Radio Productions\n\nRichard Pirodsky\n\nFrom the late 1930's to the early 1980's, William Richard \"Dick\" DeFreitas was a fixture at WHN, 1050am in New York. Whether as an announcer, newsman, program host, or Director of Public Affairs, his voice was heard throughout radio's golden age and far beyond. By fortunate happenstance (for me, at least) his mother and my grandmother were sisters, making him my first cousin, once removed by a generation.\n\nWhen I joined the New York radio scene in the 1990's as the Director of Broadcasting at L.I.U.'s C.W. Post campus, Cousin Dick proposed a grand project on the history and importance of radio, as explained by the reflections of someone who had seen and heard it all, since the beginning of broadcasting.\n\nSo when scheduling permitted, I made weekend treks to Cousin Dick's Stamford, Connecticut home. He and his gracious wife Jane made these recording sessions oases of enjoyment in a desert of disinterested academia. To borrow from a bygone, popular primer, it truly was \"Fun With Dick and Jane.\"\n\nWe started at the very beginning and Cousin Dick's memory took us back to the 1920's. Some of his observations, such as the power early radio wielded (especially over those who believed, \"It must be so, for I heard it on the radio!\"), found their way into my novel, The Demigod which, based on the career Father Charles Coughlin, follows the rise of an early radio demagogue.\n\nAt lunch time, Jane would always have a sumptuous spread prepared. So we would retire to the dining room and, though technically \"taking a break,\" the stories would continue. As Cousin Dick told it, the post-WWII years were heady times in the New York area and for New York radio.\n\n\"WHN had pretty much cornered the market in local sports, both professional and amateur. For example, our Brooklyn Dodger broadcasts were so popular that the pre-game shows for afternoon games began in the morning! Despite the competition, it wasn't unusual for little WHN to beat the networks' New York affiliates with this kind of fare.\"\n\nHowever, something was missing. Even today's all-sports stations don't offer games and pre-games 24/7. Since \"talk radio\" wasn't an option then, WHN went looking for what Cousin Dick referred to as \"strategic bridges\" which, airing at key times in the schedule, could either hold or deliver an audience, thus avoiding \"desertion\" to the networks. But what could WHN offer to compete with the likes of \"The Aldrich Family,\" \"Dr. Christian,\" and \"The Lux Radio Theater?\"\n\n\"The trouble was, a lot of the syndicated programming available to us had no 'star power' and, quite frankly, reflected a shoe-string budget. But then it dawned on us that WHN wasn't alone. It had a parent company in the Loews Corporation, and thus 'siblings' such as the MGM movie studio.\n\n\"The first step was to convince Loews to help us, which wasn't too difficult since it owned other stations that could benefit from whatever programming was generated. We then set about determining which MGM 'products' would make the best shows. The studio's movie series, like Dr. Kildare, Maisie, and Andy Hardy seemed like naturals. As did the idea for The MGM Theater of the Air, a top flight anthology which we hoped would 'out-Lux Lux.' Loews agreed on all counts and contacted MGM.\n\n\"For its part, MGM wanted nothing to do with the project. It was fighting a 'two-front war' for survival, what with the encroachment of television and the court-ordered break-up of the studio system (i.e., movie studios and/or their parent companies could no longer own their own movie theaters). At best, producing radio shows would be an unnecessary distraction. But in those days, as with most families, when a 'parent' spoke, the 'children' had little choice but to obey.\n\n\"MGM heavily resisted our program suggestions. They had discontinued all the series and the stars, such as Lew Ayers, Ann Sothern, and even Mickey Rooney, were no longer under contract to the studio. Since MGM was ordered to sign them to do the radio shows, negotiating leverage was weighted heavily in favor of the actors, and they used it!\n\n\"Despite a decided lack of enthusiasm on MGM's part, we were all pleased with the final results. We even altered our call letters to reflect and trumpet our new programming. WHN became WMGM. In terms of quality and star power, the shows were 'network equivalent.' In fact, Mutual was so fond of them that it picked them up in secondary syndication.\n\n\"All in all, it was a great idea... or at least would have been, if only we had done it ten years earlier. But in the late 1940's, we should have been more concerned with television networks, not their radio counterparts. The shows were too expensive to continue when compared with the ratings they delivered in the declining market. Ultimately, the whole project was well-intentioned, grand, even glorious, but decidedly a failure from a business standpoint.\"\n\nOur radio history project also suffered a less-than-satisfactory fate in that we never came close to completing it. Neither one of us could continue to devote the time and effort needed to bring it to fruition. Cousin Dick moved to Virginia and in August of 1999 passed away. But even failures can produce unintended and extremely positive consequences. Our time together has left me with a wealth of wonderful stories and memories. And while the efforts of those at WHN, Loews, and MGM may not have generated great profits, they did produce a treasury of shows that have entertained audiences for sixty years and counting.\n\nRichard Pirodsky is a media outlet director, the former station manager of KKFI, a 100,000 watt, non-commercial radio station in Kansas City, Missouri, and the author of \"The Demigod\", a novel based on the life and career of Father Charles Coughlin."
