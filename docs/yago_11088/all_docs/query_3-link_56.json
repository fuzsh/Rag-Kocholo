        "text": "Post by mikef6 on\n\nMaisie / Edwin L. Marin (1939). Maisie: “You know, there’s one thing I like about you: you never surprise me. You act just like I figured you the first day.” Straight talking Maisie Ravier (Ann Sothern) puts down a scheming dame in the first of a 10 picture series. Maisie Ravier is a blonde, brash, buxom and perennially broke and out-of-work showgirl perpetually down on her luck and looking for a job, but never needy. Always in your face, she never minces words or beats around the bush. In the first Maisie story, she arrives in a Wyoming town to find out that the show she had contracted for had closed while she was on her way. She runs into Robert Young as a good-looking but somewhat rude manager of a failing dude ranch. She practically cons her way into a job with the ranch owner and his cheating wife (Ruth Hussey). Love triangles both real and imagined complicate matters in this light drama. Southern is most of the interest in these Maisie films, but she provides a lot of it.\n\nGold Rush Maisie / Edwin L. Marin (1940). The third of the ten “Maisie” films. Once again Maisie travels a long way from home to southern Arizona for a promised job as a singer – a job that is no longer available when she arrives. Down to her last couple of bucks, she accepts a ride from a family of dustbowl farmers who have lost their farm and have been motoring across the country for two years following crop picking jobs, but hearing of gold being discovered in the Arizona mountains, they are turning prospector, confident that riches await them. It seems hopeless for Maisie’s new “family” and the other displaced people who rush to find gold, but though Maisie’s advocacy, the film ends with the possibility of a settled life for the homeless families.\n\nRingside Maisie / Edwin L. Marin (1941). This was the fifth of 10 in the “Maisie” series of movies. Ann Sothern again stars in and shines as Maisie Ravier. Although there is plenty of humor, this series continues to be, not comedies, but light melodramas about working-class, salt-of-the-earth people in America struggling to get along in hard times. Maisie identifies herself as being among them. When she is suspected of trying to work her charms on a fella with a future, she rips into her accuser: “You hold your mouth! I’ve been earning my living since I was 14 and I never did a crooked thing or took one cent I didn’t earn.” In this one, Maisie gets a job in an upstate New York resort but is fired almost immediately for not yielding to the advances of the act’s star (2018 topical situation). She is given some help from a boxer in training, played by Robert Sterling (that most sporty spirit from the “Topper” TV show) with Sterling’s manager (future Senator from California George Murphy) opposing her all the way. A minor drama, but well-written and well and sincerely acted, delivering the message that all will turn out well when people do the right thing by others.\n\nUndercover Maisie / Harry Beaumont (1947). You know how TV shows are struggling when they change formats and cast? Well, that happened to the Maisie series. Now, instead of a showgirl, she becomes a cop on the Bunco squad. Barry Nelson is hard-nosed Detective Leutenant Scott. He requites Maisie after she is the victim of a grifter. She goes through a brief training as a police officer and then sent out as a lure for con men. As a typical 1940s light comedy thriller (e.g. Torchy Blain, Nancy Drew) it is no better or worse. It is quite enjoyable, to be honest; but it is not Maisie. “Undercover Maisie” was the only picture of the series to lose money and to not get a New York Times review. It was also the tenth and last of the series.\n\nAnn Sothern as Maisie\n\nSherlock Holmes In Washington / Roy William Neill (1943). Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce team up as Holmes and Watson for the fifth time. They would go onto a total of 14 films as the most famous detective duo in history. Roy William Neill is directing them for the second time. Neill would go on to direct every remaining entry in the series. In this one, a “modern” Holmes story set in the year of its release, the World’s First Consulting Detective is retained by the War Office when a British agent who was delivering a secret document of four legal size pages to America was kidnapped on a train travelling between New York and D.C. This film has one of the better screenplays based on an original story by Bertram Millhauser who co-wrote the screenplay. I liked it that Holmes actually does quite a bit of deduction as he follows the trail of the spies who are after the document. If you listen for it, there is even some hidden humor. In an early scene, Watson muses, “Four legal pages. He couldn’t have eaten it; it would have been very dry.” Holmes replies in his superior sounding clipped tones, “Especially legal papers.” It went by so fast, I almost missed it. My Lovely Wife and I both had a delayed laugh. I loved it. While Bruce’s Watson sometimes shows intelligence and is of help to Holmes. In this one, though, he is even more dithering than usual. The innocent young woman caught up in the plot is played by Marjorie Lord (“Make Room For Daddy”). The main baddies are played by reliable villains George Zucco and Henry Daniell.\n\nBasil Rathbone and Player in Sherlock Holmes In Washington\n\nLogan Lucky / Steven Soderbergh (2017). Soderbergh’s retirement from directing feature films lasted about four years. This light caper film was his re-entry into the arena. Channing Tatum stars as Jimmy Logan, an out-of-work former local football star in West Virginia who plans a complicated heist of the underground vault at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina during one of the year’s largest attended races. There is just so much potential in the cast and script for suspense, comedy, and sympathy for the team of robbers that is just never realized. For instance, Adam Driver, racking up an impressive resume of divers characters, does it again but, somehow, Clyde Logan and all his eccentricities don’t really matter. Driver could have played the character any old way and it wouldn’t have made a difference to the story. And (this is the most interesting one of all) Daniel Craig in a supporting role as, as he put it, an “in-car-cer-a-ted” good-ol’-southern-boy in prison who has to be broken out of jail to utilize his abilities with explosives and then broken back into jail before he is noticed missing. But the excitement isn’t there. The film just plods along. Also in the notable cast is Riley Keough, Katie Holmes, Hilary Swank, Seth MacFarlane, Dwight Yoakam, Sebastian Stan, Jack Quaid, Brian Gleeson, and Katherine Waterston.\n\nLOGAN LUCKY EDIT: You know how sometimes you will wake up at night or early morning and remember something you forgot or you have the solution to some problem you were worrying about? Well, that happened to me about 5:30 in the a.m. this morning regarding my previous day’s viewing of “Logan Lucky.” The (rather clever) method they use to steal all the money from a impenetrable vault had been used before on “Mission: Impossible.” I looked it up. It was Season Six, Episode 21, first broadcast on February 19, 1972. Titled Casino, the special guest villain was Jack Cassidy, a veteran whose specialty was oily bad guys.\n\nChanning Tatum and Adam Driver in Logan Lucky\n\nDaniel Craig in Logan Lucky\n\nPost by kijii on\n\nMudbound (2017) www.imdb.com/title/tt2396589/?ref_=nv_sr_1 is a dark movie, both figuratively and literally. I don’t know if this is what is known as natural lighting or not. But, during most of the movie, I was unable to see the characters or the action in order to put the story together properly. And, in the end, maybe that was the intention of the movie. The violent treatment of black folk in the Jim Crow South is not a new subject in film. However, I will always remember this movie for its exposure to poverty and the futile work of trying to make something grow in soil that is just mud. The two former servicemen portrayed here, one white and the other black, do form a bound based on their experiences in the war. Neither is able to readjust to the mud, poverty, and hatred of the Mississippi delta after coming home again.\n\nLaura McAllan (Carey Mulligan): [narrating] Violence is part and parcel of country life. You're forever being assailed by dead things. Dead mice, dead rabbits, dead possums. You find them in the yard. You smell them rottin' under the house. And then there are the creatures you kill for food. Chickens, hogs, deer, frogs, squirrels. Pluck, skin, disembowel, debone, fry. Eat, start again, kill. I learned how to stitch up a bleeding wound... load and fire a shotgun... reach into the womb of a heavin' sow to deliver a breeched piglet. My hands did these things... but I was never easy in my mind.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCasanova Brown (1944) www.imdb.com/title/tt0036699/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_8 was a reunion of director Sam Wood with the acting combo of Cary Cooper and Teresa Wright since their great success with of The Pride of the Yankees (1942). Unlike the sad biographical movie of Lou Gehrig, this movie is comedy, with a few very funny moments. The movie starts strong with Frank Morgan trying to talk Gary Cooper out of marrying his daughter, Madge (Anita Loise), for her money and making the same mistake he did when he married her mother:\n\n“I used to dream of outliving her. Just sit it out, as it were. But along came Madge. And then her sister. And now that odious child.”\n\nBut, Cass, undaunted, decides to marry Madge anyway. However, during the wedding rehearsal, Cass starts wondering why he is getting so much information about a maternity hospital in Chicago. Why him?\n\nAt this point we see a flashback of Cass’s earlier marriage proposal to Isabel Drury (Teresa Wright) and his first meeting with her parents—before he accidentally burns down their house during a heated argument with Isabel’s astrology-believing mother (Patricia Collinge). Though Isabel and Cass get married, the marriage had been annulled by Isabel’s parents...but... After Cass goes to Chicago to investigate the maturity hospital and his possible paternity to Isabel’s possible child, the comedy of the movie rapidly declines as Cass learns to become an instant father.\n\nThis overly convoluted comedy fails to satisfy. Especially during the era when some combination of Sam Wood, Gary Cooper, Teresa Wright, and Patricia Collinge were ruling the day at the box office. Think of it: The Little Foxes (1941), Mrs. Miniver (1942), The Pride of the Yankees (1942), Shadow of a Doubt (1943), For Who the Bell Tolls (1943) followed by The Best Years of Our Lives (1946).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Post (2017) www.imdb.com/title/tt6294822/?ref_=tt_urv. I guess any Steven Spielberg movie with Meryl Streep and Tom Tom Hanks is probably worth seeing and so was this one. Meryl Streep, once again, shows us how well she can inhabit a character and make us believe she is Kay Graham. This is a story about a \"local\" newspaper trying to survive in an environment of larger markets--The NY Times, Gannett, Knight Ridder--with larger and more talented reporters and staffs. To do this, Ms. Graham--who had basically inherited the paper from her family--is forced to \"go public\" with the paper at a time when what she about to do could ruin it. The first half of the movie is boring, but there is a pivotal moment at which it becomes interesting, and that point all rests one decision by one woman with conflicted interests and limited personal experience. While watching this movie, one is reminded of other newspaper movies where someone has to say \"start the presses.\" ---Deadline - U.S.A. (1952) - Five Star Final (1931)\n\nwww.imdb.com/title/tt6294822/videoplayer/vi11581465?ref_=tt_ov_vi\n\nI loved the scene where the camera looks down on Meryl Streep and rotates 360-degrees to show us that she is all alone in that big room with her decision....The end of the movie gives us another masterful stroke.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBright Victory (1951) www.imdb.com/title/tt0043361/?ref_=ttawd_awd_was Mark Robson's movie about a veteran returning from the War with a permanent physical disability - total blindness caused by a German sniper's bullet while on the field. Similar to Fred Zinnemann's movie, The Men (1950), it deals with coming to grips with his new disability. In The Men, Marlon Brando seemed to have a longer psychological battle than Arthur Kennedy did with his blindness. This movie is more about Kennedy's life-style rehabilitation than about his psychological battle. Arthur Kennedy received one of his five Oscar nominations for this movie.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Out (2017) www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/?ref_=nv_sr_1 is hard to classify, but it is certainly entertaining.\n\nThis movie had been nominated for 4 Oscars this year: Best Picture, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Daniel Kaluuya), Best Achievement in Directing and Best Original Screenplay (Jordan Peele). What starts out looking like a social commentary movie ends up as a Horror - Mystery - Thriller. In fact, it may be all of these things.\n\nI walked into this movie without any preconceived notions of what it was about.\n\nIs Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) paranoid or are they really out to get him as Chris's friend, Rod Williams (LilRel Howery) is telling him?\n\nWhat is up with this weird Armitage family?\n\nI built my own notions when I left the movie...\n\nBTW, Jordan Peele has an alternative ending to see once the final credits are played...make sure to see both endings.\n\nwww.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/videoplayer/vi2005186073?ref_=tt_ov_vi\n\nChris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya): I know she caught me off guard, right? But it's cool because... I'm cured. It worked!\n\nRod Williams (LilRel Howery): Bruh, how you not scared of this, man? Look, they could have made you do all types of stupid shit. They have you fuckin' barking like a dog, flying around like you a fuckin' pigeon looking ridiculous. Or... I don't know if you noticed, white people love making people sex slaves and shit.\n\nChris Washington : Yeah, I'm pretty sure they are not a kinky sex family, dawg.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeliverance (1972) www.imdb.com/title/tt0068473/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt\n\nIt's been a while since I've watched this movie.\n\nSo, I watched it again......\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Squaw Man (1918) www.imdb.com/title/tt0009650/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_40\n\nThe Squaw Man (1931) www.imdb.com/title/tt0022428/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_17\n\nThis is Cecil B. DeMille's first remake. Is it the first remake ever done by the same director?\n\n1914 silent version (DeMille's very first movie) with Dustin Farnum, Red Wing, Winifred Kingston, and Fred Montague.\n\n1931 sound version DeMille's first remake, with Warner Baxter, Lupe Velez, Eleanor Boardman, and Charles Bickford.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis Day and Age (1933) www.imdb.com/title/tt0024656/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_15 is lots of fun and total atypical of what we think of when we think of a Cecle B. DeMille epic spectale. Again, Charles Bickford plays the villain as the leader of a local mob. A dedicated group of high school kids figure out a way to capture him in a way that will hold up in a court of law. This movie is a bit like the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew series.\n\nPost by Lebowskidoo 🦞 on\n\nI didn't think I'd seen too many movies this week since I had been kind of busy, looks like I did though. I also began to watch the TV series Sons of Anarchy from the start which cuts into movie watching somewhat.\n\nBaby Driver (2017) was a stylish and fun thrill-ride, I feel like I'm the last person to finally see this. Great soundtrack and performances, Ansel Elgort was very good, and here I assumed he was just adequate in previous roles.\n\nLogan Lucky (2017) was a Soderbergh heist movie, yes, another one. It has some good moments, but not his best and yet, not his worst either.\n\nCall Me By Your Name (2017) Another Oscar nominated movie, this one unravels slowly like a lazy summer's afternoon, and by the end your feeling feels, very much like Brokeback Mountain in that it leaves you shaken.\n\nResident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016)\n\nNot sure how many chapters there have been, but now we come to the final chapter, supposedly. This movie was quite enjoyable, which I wasn't too sure it would be, there have been a few duds in this series. It has a fast pace and wraps up a few loose ends.\n\nAwakening the Zodiac (2017)\n\nWhat if the infamous Zodiac Killer was still out there and you found him? Sounds more exciting than it was.\n\n3 Generations (2015)\n\nThree generations of women sharing a NYC apartment, the granddaughter wanting to transition to male. Could have been something really special, but kinda drops the ball. One or two stand-out moments where Elle Fanning really shines.\n\nUnforgettable (2017)\n\nKatherine Heigl and Rosario Dawson in the latest Fatal Attraction-type movie. It's not bad but I think it may eventually fall into the cult-cheese section for most people. Heigl's flat-ironed platinum blonde hair was the scariest thing about it.\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha (2005)\n\nThe ups and downs of being a pre-WWII geisha in Japan, this was a great movie, visually fascinating and a John Williams score that he actually begged to do.\n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017)\n\nFrances McDormand and Sam Rockwell (see new avi!) are just so commanding of the screen in their roles that you fall in love with these two great actors all over again. The movie is hilarious and sad, not an easy feat. I predict Oscar wins for the movie, the script, Rockwell AND McDormand!\n\nRush Hour (1998) Rush Hour 2 (2001) & Rush Hour 3 (2007)\n\nI'd seen the first two movies when they came out years ago, but I'd never seen the third. Got a boxed set and off we went. Not the most original scenario for a movie, but Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan work so well together it's easy enough to go along with it's plot formula each time. You watch for their interactions and the plot is secondary."
