        "text": "THE LIGHTHOUSE COCKTAIL SHAKER USED IN FOUR MOVIES ! & More\n\n1.) Blondie of the Follies. 1932. Starring Marion Davies, sweet heart of William Randolph Hearst. Look Quick, toward the end of the movie, during the final party scene the Lighthouse Cocktail Shaker is on the shelf in the kitchen. This film has not been released on DVD yet\n\n2.) Hollywood Party. 1934. \"Musical comedy hodgepodge built around screen star Jimmy Durante throwing a gala party.\" The Lighthouse Cocktail shaker is on the bar in the classic egg-breaking sequence w/ Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, and Lupe Velez. This segment is easily found on you tube.\n\nthe Hilarious egg scene takes place 4 mins 10 seconds into this clip:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M9LS4AN8v8\n\n3.) Riptide. 1934. A big budget pre-code movie Starring Norma Shearer wearing more than one very revealing gown which only pre-code production values would have permitted. The reappearance of an old flame complicates the staid marriage of a lively ex-chorus girl to a British diplomat. The Lighthouse Cocktail Shaker is used to shake and pour a Martini by the old flame, Robert Montgomery for Shearer. MGM emptied their prop house of bar ware for this one, in one scene in the suite of Robert Montgomery you can spot: The Hawks party size mixer, page 141, w/ long glass stirring rod that has a sterling silver top knob and strainer, The Manning Bowman K128 mixer, page 60, various decanters, seltzer & bitter bottles, glasses, ice bucket, and an unidentified cut glass cocktail shaker on the table top next to a lamp. There is imbibing in almost every scene, in a Cannes bar Shearer and Montgomery both order French 75s and behind the bar you can spot an unidentified large party size tea pot style plated cocktail shaker and next to that a repousse tea pot style International Silver cocktail shaker re; page 42.\n\n4.) Manhattan Melodrama. 1934 Starring Clark Gable. William Powell & Myrna Loy are matched together for the first time. Movie winning an Academy Award for best story. Gable serves a drink to Myna Loy using The Lighthouse Cocktail Shaker.\n\nThis movie entered the lexicon of history as the last motion picture seen by John Dillinger who was shot to death leaving the Biograph theater on Sunday July 22, 1934. Legend has it that Powell and Loy rehearsed their lines separately and literally met for the first time, cameras rolling, as Powell tumbles into the back seat of the limo holding Loy. The fantastic chemistry between the two is amazing and happens instantly. Director W.S. Van Dyke uses the pair for another low budget quicky film -shot in 18 days- The Thin Man, first of the series. Nominated for a 1934 Academy Award for Best Picture, it lost out to It Happened One Night, staring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.\n\n&\n\nNIGHT AFTER NIGHT. 1932 Paramount Pictures.

In this movie the top of the long glass stirring rod, a sterling silver top cap is missing. (More as not someone must have dropped this and the top broke off- hence the reason Maxwell is so awkwardly using this stirring rod.)
