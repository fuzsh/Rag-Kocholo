        "text": "Getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is no small feat, because it’s like writing your name down in time. The terrazzo or copper stars are permanently fixed in the aisles, which testifies to the will of those who have made gigantic progress and significant achievements in the entertainment industry. Ann Sothern, an American actress and singer, has two stars in Hollywood: one for motion pictures and the other for television. In view of this, it would be ridiculous to say that his career was not successful. Beyond her professional accomplishments, here’s what you need to know about the actress.\n\nAnn Sothern Bio\n\nBorn Harriette Arlene Lake in Valley City, North Dakota, United States of America on January 22, 1909; her father, Walter J. Lake, worked as an importer and exporter, while her mother, Annette Yde, was a singer who performed mostly at concerts. Ann Sothern and her two younger sisters were raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She attended Central High School in Minneapolis and later went on to college at the University of Washington in Seattle, although she dropped out after a year.\n\nShe was very good at the piano which she started learning when she was five years old. Ann even studied at the McPhail School of Music where her mother was a teacher. She excelled in music composition winning Minnesota’s annual competition for student-level music composers for three consecutive years while still in high school. After her parents divorced, her mother moved to Los Angeles as a voice coach for the prestigious Warner Bros. Studio.\n\nAnn Sothern began her film career in 1927extras in the film “Broadway Nights”, and then in other films. She continued to do bit parts until 1933, when she was cast by Columbia Pictures in “Let’s Fall in Love.” Harry Cohn, co-founder and president of Columbia Pictures at the time, changed her name to Ann Sothern, Harriette Arlene Lake, in memory of her mother and EH Sothern (American Shakespearian actor). After being dropped by Columbia Pictures in 1936, she left for RKO, although the jobs she held remained tied to low-budget commercial films, such as the one she had acquired from Columbia Pictures.\n\nIn 1938, she got her first major breakthrough soon after in ‘Trade Winds’ which landed her a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The following year, she got her first main role in “Maisie”, which would become a successful series until 1947. In 1953, after having appeared in several successful films, she appeared on television in “Private Secretary”. The following year, after the cancellation of Private Secretary, the American actress starred in “Ann Sothern Show,” another sitcom she made for Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). She also worked as a voice artist in the lead role in “My Mother the Car”, a comedy show.\n\nThe Hollywood star retired to her home in Ketchum, Idaho in 1987 due to health issues. His last appearance in the film “The Whales of August” earned him an Oscar nomination.\n\nHis net worth\n\nAfter a successful career of nearly 60 years in film and television, the talented American actress was able to build up great wealth. His net worth was placed somewhere around an estimated worth of $16 million.\n\nAnn Sothern, wife and children\n\nAnn married American actor Roger Pryor in 1936. They then finalized their divorce in May 1943, two years after they separated over allegations of cruelty. Their union produced no offspring. Shortly after divorcing Roger, she married Robert Sterling, a film and television actor.\n\nAnn Sothern had only one child in her life, and that was with Robert Sterling. Patricia Ann ‘Tisha’ Sterling was born on December 10, 1944 in Los Angeles, California. Just like her parents, she became an actress.\n\nBody measurements\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation regarding the body measurements of the multiple Primetime Emmy Award nominee. Ann Sothern can’t be said to be tall with a height of 5ft 1in. She weighed 67 kg while, according to rumours, she would have gained weight a little before her death. Her bust and hips measured 35 and 36 inches respectively.\n\nAnn’s death\n\nThe Golden Globe Award winner died at her home in Ketchum, Idaho on March 15, 2001. According to medical reports, she died of congestive heart failure. She was 92 when she died and was buried in Ketchum Cemetery."
