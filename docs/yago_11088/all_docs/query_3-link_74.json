        "text": "The name of the boutique label Twilight Time is a sly reference to the increasing reluctance by some of the major studios to release “deep catalogue” titles — i.e., films made before, say, 1975 — on “physical media,” or DVD and Blu-rays. Begun a year ago to license such semi-orphaned films from Twentienth Century Fox Home Entertainment for limited-edition DVD editions of 3,000 copies, Twilight Time (which distributes through Screen Archives Entertainment, a longtime purveyor of movie soundtracks) is now debuting a couple of new Blu-ray editions a month of films — including some already available on DVD — that both Fox and Sony have reservations about releasing through normal retail channels.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine there isn’t a large and enthusiastic market for Henry Levin’s delightful “Journey to the Center of the Earth” (1959), which arrives on Blu-ray in a great-looking edition today via Screen Archives. Made during Hollywood’s decade-long infatuation with Jules Verne — it followed Disney’s “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea” (1955) and the Oscar-winning “Around the World” (1956) — this is an elaborately entertaining sci-fi classic that holds a special place in the holds a special place in the hearts of boomers like me but has a generation-spanning appeal.\n\nThe excellent screenplay by veterans Walter Reich and producer Charles Brackett — the writing team for “Ninotchka,” minus Billy Wilder — takes some liberties with Verne (adding a promnent duck named Gertrude who gets a special shout-out in the trailer, and references to Atlantis) but remains true to the author’s spirit and 19th-century setting.\n\n“Journey” was originally intended for two of Fox’s biggest stars of the era, singer Pat Boone and Clifton Webb. The latter, who had two other 1959 releases but made only other film after that, dropped out for health reasons and was replaced by James Mason of “20,000 Leagues,” who gives one of his most memorable performances as an irascible, newly-knighted geology professor at the University of Edinburgh (that same year, he played the chief villain in Hitchcock’s “North by Northwest”).\n\nBoone was reportedly reluctant to play a Scottish graduate student (in real life, he had just graduated cum laude from Columbia University) who joins Mason on his often arduous quest after a couple of relatively undemanding Henry Levin-directed musicals. He was persuaded to participate with top billing and a lucrative percentage of grosses from the picture (he mysteriously shares a credit with former Fox executive Joseph L. Schenck). The result is probably Boone’s best Fox vehicle, far superior to the problematic 1962 remake of “State Fair,” the only other Boone film available at this point on digital media (as an extra on the 1944 original).\n\nJoining them in confronting volanic eruptions, dinosaurs and other splendid effects — as well as villain Thayer David — are Arlene Dahl as a fellow explorer’s widow who bickers with Mason, and Peter Ronson as a heroic Swede. Diane Baker plays Mason’s daughter and Boone’s love interest, who gets serenaded by him in one of three songs composed by Sammy Cahn and James Van Heusen (with a little help from poet Robert Burns).\n\nThe film’s transfer is a bit on the soft side — not unusual for a CinemaScope feature shot in Eastmancolor (credited as Deluxe Color after the lab that Fox then owned) but the very vivid colors are a definite improvement over Fox’s 2003 DVD.\n\nWhile it would have been nice to hear a commentary track with Boone and Dahl’s recollection, the only extra besides the trailer for this 132-minute feature is an isolated soundrack for Bernard Herrman’s striking, organ-oriented score. Like all Screen Archives releases, it’s accompanied by a booklet containing excellent notes by Julie Kirgo.\n\nLike “Journey,” Henry Koster’s “Desiree” was once a big attraction on network TV — it debuted with much fanfare in the second season of NBC’s “Saturday Night at the Movies” in 1962 — but has been been surprisingly little-seen since consideringat it stars Marlon Brando, then at the height of his stardom, as Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nIt’s interesting that both of Hollywood’s major depictions of the emperor come in films focusing on the women in his life. Back in 1937, Charles Boyer had played Napoleon in MGM’s “Conquest,” a notorious flop centering on his mistress Marie Waleska, portrayed by top-billed Greta Garbo.\n\nBrando may be topped billed in “Desiree,” but the title role goes to Jean Simmons (soon to be his co-star in “Guys and Dolls”) as a silk merchant’s daughter briefly egaged to the young officer before his more politically advantageous marriage to Josephine (Merle Oberon, who has one good scene).\n\nDesiree drifts in and out of Napoleon’s life over a period of decades (neither visibly ages) as he divorces Josephine for an Austrian princess, Desiree’s French husband (Michael Rennie) becomes King of Sweden and the emperor becomes increasingly grandiose after various military victories (which occur mostly offscreen) lead up to his banishment to Elba.\n\nA bigger hit at the time than Brando’s other 1954 release, “On the Waterfront,” this early CinemaScope epic — there are no closeups and few two-shots because of technical issues with lenses — has a pair of stars with palpable chemistry (though the film does not suggest Napoleon and Desiree ever did the nasty) and really, really lavish sets and costumes. Plus, in the early scenes, Desiree’s overprotective brother is played by — hold on now — Richard Deacon, better known as Mel Cooley of “The Dick Van Dyke Show.”\n\nTwilight Time’s Sony releases are Blu-ray upgrades that were originally prepared for retail release until Sony got cold feet, so they look even better than the Fox titles. A new high-definition transfer showcases cimematographer James Wong Howe’s romantic vision of Manhattan in “Bell, Book and Candle” (1958), the other film that James Stewart and Kim Novak teamed up for the same year as “Vertigo.”\n\nRichard Quine and screenwriter Daniel Taradash created a delightfully quirky classic from John Van Druten’s play about a Manhattan book publisher (Stewart) bewitched by a witch (Novak) who wishes she weren’t. Like the TV series it loosely inspired (“Bewitched”), it’s been read as a gay and/or feminist parable, particularly Novak is she’s talking about her fraught relationship with her former college roommate (Janice Rule), now Stewart’s financee.\n\nCertainly Jack Lemmon, who plays Novak’s jazz musician/warlock brother, can be read as gay (even Novak told me she thinks so). The extremely funny supporting cast includes Elsa Lanchester as Novak’s mischevious aunt, Ernie Kovacs as a fraudulent expert on supernatural phenomenon and Hermoine Gingold as a Brooklyn watch who Stewart goes to for a cure.\n\n“Bell, Book and Candle” is a film of great moments, including a visit to a Greenwich Village beat cafe, a Christmas morning visit to the Flatiron building, and the unforgettable moment when Novak discovers she’s become human. Howe even shoots several scenes from the point of view of Novak’s scene-stealing cat.\n\nTwilight Time’s latest release from Sony’s Columbia Pictures catalogue today is arguably Fritz Lang’s best American film, “The Big Heat” (1953). Made in black-and-white just before the widescreen craze (and presented at 1:1.37), this crisp, bright new transfer of the noir classic stars Glenn Ford as a cop out to avenge the death of his wife (Jocelyn Brando) on the orders of an underworld boss (Alexander Scourby).\n\nFord finds an ally in B-girl Gloria Grahame, in her unforgettable role as a B-girl who receives a face full of scalding coffee from boyfriend Lee Marvin– one of the most indelible, and still-shocking, images of the 1950s.\n\nA pair of late John Garfield classics — Robert Rossen’s “Body and Soul” (1947) with Lili Palmer and Abraham Polonky’s “Force of Evil” (1948) with Marie Windsor — are due July 31 from Olive Films, via its licensing of Republic library titles from Paramount.\n\nErnest Schodesack and Irving Pichel’s “The Most Dangerous Game” (1932) is scheduled to make its Blu-ray debut June 26 from Flicker Alley. Copious special features include the feature-length South Seas ethnograhic documentary “Go” (1931, aka “Cannibal Island”), a commentary track by USC’s Rick Jewell, and an archival interview with producer Merian C. Cooper conducted by Kevin Brownlow.\n\nFlicker Alley is also excitingly promising the Blu-ray/DVD combo debut of “This Is Cinerama” (1952) in time for its 60th anniversary in September, with lots of special features. Flicker Alley will also be bringing out “Windjammer” (1958), produced in the rival jumbo format of Cinemiracle and later distributed by Cinerama.\n\nThe long-promised first volume of MGM’s “Maisie” film series starring Ann Sothern series arrives today from the Warner Archive Collection. Sothern had been kicking around Hollywood as a dancer and B-movie star since 1929 when her scene-stealing role in Tay Garnett’s “Trade Winds” (1937) persuaded MGM to take her on. They cast Southern as a showgirl in Edwin L Marin’s “Maisie” (1939), a one-off script originally ontended for Jean Harlow, billed second to Robert Young.\n\nThe series proper begins with “Congo Maisie” (1940), H.C. Potter’s programmer remake of “Red Dust” co-starring Clark Gable lookalike John Carroll. The other films in the first set, all directed by Marin, are “Gold Rush Maisie” with Lee Bowman; “Maisie Was a Lady” (1941) with Lew Ayres and Maureen O’Sullivan taking a break from the “Doctor Kildare” and “Tarzan” series; and “Ringside Maisie” (1941) with George Murphy and Robert Sterling.\n\nWAC is also releasing with Sam Wood’s “Navy Blue and Gold” (1937) starring Robert Young and James Stewart (billed in that order) as Annapolis cadets. Florence Rice, Lionel Barrymore and Billie Burke co-star."
