        "text": "Defining Performance\n\nPrompted by the California energy crisis of 1999 – 2001, managers at Adobe Systems' San Jose, Calif., headquarters sought to reduce energy use by 10%. Building managers quickly met the initial goal and have been continuously improving the headquarters' energy performance and sustainability ever since, resulting in ENERGY STAR scores of 100 for each of the three towers. Adobe's latest energy efficiency project involves the remodeling of office spaces, removing most office walls and placing desks in open layout “neighborhoods.” Lamps, HVAC and plug load turn off automatically in these areas when no motion is detected and the open-plan layout takes advantage of daylighting, reducing the need for artificial light."
