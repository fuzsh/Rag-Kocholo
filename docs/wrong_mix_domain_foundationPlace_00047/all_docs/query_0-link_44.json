To avoid potential hold times, you may request a call back.\n\nIn order to use the Adobe software to its fullest capabilities it is critical that the machine meets minimum requirements for installation. Prior to purchase and installation of any Adobe software, please verify that the computer meets Adobe's suggested Minimum System Requirements necessary to operate the software. Requirements can be found at http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/tech-specs.html\n\nTo get the newest version of Adobe apps working after your Adobe Invitation email is received, please follow next steps:\n\nUninstall all old Adobe applications. Every application that has Adobe name in it must be uninstalled. If you have problems uninstalling old Adobe software, please use this guide\n\nDownload and install Adobe Creative Cloud apps\n\nOpen a newly installed Adobe Creative Cloud Application; sign in again following guides above if asked.

You will also be required to Authenticate through DUO. Once you have logged in, scroll up and down to choose the software you want to install. Each Adobe product has a separate install.\n\nIf you open a PDF directly from a web browser that has a PDF extension installed, the file will open inside the browser. To open directly in Adobe, you will need to save the document to your computer before opening.\n\nIf you find that when you double-click on a saved PDF and it opens in Adobe Reader, it means Adobe Reader is set as the default for PDF documents. To bypass this, you can right click the file and chose Open With... search for and choose Adobe Acrobat Pro.\n\nIf Acrobat no longer works for you, you may need to log back into Adobe using your primary ARC email account by clicking the round icon in the top right corner of Acrobat Pro or another Adobe program you have installed."
