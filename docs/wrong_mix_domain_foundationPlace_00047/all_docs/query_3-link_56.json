        "text": "The Northside neighborhood is located at the northern gateway into the City of Riverside. Known for its history, environmental resources, and strong community connection, the Northside is one of the City's oldest neighborhoods. It has been occupied for over 10,000 years, first by Native American groups, including the Gabrielino/Tongva, Cahuilla, Serrano and LuiseÃ±o, and later by Spanish, Mexican, and American settlers. Its uniqueness comes from its proudly diverse, multi-generational residents that stand together in protecting their heritage and defining their future. The character of the Northside neighborhood is shaped by its variety of residential, office, retail, and extensive recreational facilities.\n\nThe Jefferson North Grove will be a 482-home development in the Northside neighborhood of Riverside, California.\n\nThe three-story luxury multi-family development will offer 1-, 2-, and 3-bedroom homes to residents as well as several live/work units. The homes will offer energy-efficient stainless-steel appliances and electric ranges, private tiered balconies, 9-foot ceilings, and a full-sized washer and dryer.\n\nResidents will also enjoy two resort-style pools accompanied by cabanas and outdoor firepits, an outdoor kitchen, coworking lounges, a state-of-the-art fitness center, a dog park, a bicycle storage and repair room, and electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nThe State of California Allocates $10.4 Million for the Trujillo Adobe\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom signed the 2022-23 California State Budget, which includes $10.4 million in funding for Riversideâs historic Trujillo Adobe. Funding is slated to preserve the remaining structure, site expansion and renovation. The funding will also help with the development of a museum for the public to tour, engage with and learn about the history of the Trujillo Adobe.\n\nThe Third Street Grade Separation Project includes building a new four-lane underpass, to replace the existing at-grade crossing at the BNSF railroad tracks, relocating BNSF tracks to minimize rail disruptions, and realigning Commerce Street for improved connectivity. Third Street will see upgrades with a raised median, bike lanes, and sidewalks. The project will also require constructing retaining walls, realigning the Riverside Canal, a stormwater pump station, and utility relocations.\n\nThe Project is not capacity-increasing and the purpose and need for this project is to mitigate safety and congestion impacts from the presence of an at-grade railroad crossing.\n\nA $13.8 million plan to increase safety along North Main Street just south of Highway 60 has taken a major step forward as a result of Rep. Mark Takano securing $11.1 million in funding from the federal Safe Streets and Roads for All (SS4A) Grant Program.\n\nThe project will convert Main Street between Highway 60 and Third Street to a single lane in each direction divided by a traffic median with additional parking, landscaping, and pedestrian walkways. The effort is designed to increase safety for motorists and pedestrians by slowing traffic, creating bikeways, and beautifying a major gateway into Riverside.\n\nThe City is working to find another $2.7 million in non-federal funds and move forward with project design before continuing with competitive bidding and a public engagement effort. Construction is scheduled to start in March 2026 and be completed by February 2027.\n\nThe Northside Master Development is the culmination of years of collaborative effort between the City and the community to define a vision. It will celebrate the region's culture with architectural details that reflect a connection between its history and twenty-first-century Riverside. It will expand on the area's existing assets to realize the communityâs vision as defined in the Northside Specific Planâ¯(NSP) and include a neighborhood gathering space with locally inspired retail and multi-family housing, walkable trails, bicycle corridors, restoration of the Springbrook Arroyo, open park space, and new recreational facilities.\n\nThe goal is to create a cohesive development that delivers an open and welcoming neighborhood center and park with a functional, modern, family-friendly design.\n\nSpring 2024 Update: No developer was selected for the project at the current time. No proposal met the Cityâs desired project requirements. The City is reevaluating the Master Developer RFP requirements and may or may not pursue another round of RFPs for the project site. This site will continue to reflect any upcoming changes to the project area."
