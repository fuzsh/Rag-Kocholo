        "text": "Strength\n\n1. Diverse product portfolio for both individuals and businesses: Adobe diversified its products and services to support and serve a wide range of customers. It has products in document and text, image and video editing, sound editing, digital marketing, cloud services and SaaS based services. This diversification is a great advantage to Adobe as in most of the product lines adobe has absolute monopoly. The diversification adopted by them is logical and strategic and serves to help Adobe to maintain its profit for a long period. Stepping into cloud services has acted as a vertical linkage for Adobe where it can provide a wide variety of services through cloud for medium and large enterprises. Adobe cloud services have a market share of about 12.1%, Adobe Photoshop has a market share of about 48.69% and the flash player of Adobe is expected to address a billion computers. These numbers show the strength and diversity of Adobe systems.\n\n2. Trusted brand globally with presence across many countries : Adobe is one of the few trusted brands in the global market. Some of the applications provided by Adobe have become synonymous with the service provided by them, for example Adobe Photoshop has become synonymous with photo editing and Adobe reader has become synonymous with text and documentation. Adobe's inventions have changed how people engage and interact with one another across all forms of media for almost 40 years. Adobe provides resources and services that enable people to create, collaborate, and express themselves. Their mission is to connect people, transform businesses with captivating, customized experiences new degrees of collaborative communities. Further Adobe also features on the “Top 100 Best Global Brands” by Interbrand 2018 as per the Adobe website.\n\nThe remaining section under \"Strength\" is available only in the 'Complete Report' on purchase.\n\nWeakness\n\nThis section is available only in the 'Complete Report' on purchase.\n\nOpportunity\n\nThis section is available only in the 'Complete Report' on purchase.\n\nThreat\n\nThis section is available only in the 'Complete Report' on purchase.\n\nPolitical\n\nThis section is available only in the 'Complete Report' on purchase.\n\nEconomic\n\nThis section is available only in the 'Complete Report' on purchase.\n\nSocial\n\n2. Growth in the number of social media users have led to increase in consumption of content: Social media has significantly grown and changed. Today, social media platforms give billions of users with free, highly-tailored, and personalized feeds of photos, video, music, news, games, and shoppable media, all lighted up by social networking. Top services are generating additional revenue by transforming into retail destinations and utilizing creative economies and influencers to increase consumer engagement and spending. The Consumer Technology Association recently conducted a study that will be released in conjunction with the annual CES industry event. The study found that US consumers now spend almost as much time streaming videos on social media platforms as they do watching traditional TV, highlighting the expanding role of online content in broader media consumption. The growth in the online content consumption has also led to an increase in the number of social media influencers. With the rise in content and content creators the demand for digital tools is likely to grow. This will benefit adobe as it has a suite of digital tools for creators.\n\nThe remaining section under \"Social\" is available only in the 'Complete Report' on purchase.\n\nTechnological\n\nThis section is available only in the 'Complete Report' on purchase.\n\nLegal\n\nThis section is available only in the 'Complete Report' on purchase.\n\nEnvironmental\n\nThis section is available only in the 'Complete Report' on purchase."
