        "text": "SAN JOSE — Adobe Systems, just days after it revealed plans for a huge expansion in downtown San Jose, confirmed Wednesday that it’s signed a lease for additional offices in the city’s urban core.\n\nThe tech giant has leased 65,000 square feet in an office tower at 10 S. Almaden Blvd., said Erik Hallgrimson, an executive managing director with Cushman & Wakefield, which worked with another commercial realty brokerage, Colliers International, to arrange the lease. The tower is about two blocks from Adobe’s existing headquarters and near a site the company has agreed to buy for its major expansion.\n\n“This space will be used to accommodate employees while on-going work-space renovations take place at our headquarters and for any growth leading up to the opening of the new tower,” Adobe said Wednesday through a representative.\n\nEarlier this month, Adobe revealed it would dramatically broaden its downtown San Jose headquarters through the purchase of a property at 333 W. San Fernando St., a short distance from its main offices.\n\nAbout 3,000 Adobe workers could be employed in a proposed office tower at the West San Fernando expansion site, which is just north of Adobe’s headquarters at 345 Park Ave.\n\nFor the most recent lease transaction of 65,000 square feet, Adobe signed a five-year rental agreement, Hallgrimson said. The company expects to move into the new offices in early November.\n\nAdobe’s expansion quest in downtown San Jose comes amid disclosures that Mountain View-based Google and its development partner, realty firm Trammell Crow, have embarked on an ambitious effort to create a transit village near the Diridon transit station and the SAP entertainment complex.\n\nAn estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Google employees could work downtown in the Google village.\n\n“Downtown San Jose has finally gotten the momentum it deserves,” said Bob Staedler, a principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a development and planning consultancy.\n\nAs dramatic as the Adobe and Google expansions are for downtown San Jose, they aren’t they only recent events that point toward a major upswing in activity in the city’s urban core. Other tech firms are establishing new or wider beachheads downtown.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon’s Lab 126 unit has rented one to two floors at the Towers @ 2nd office complex near the corner of North Second and East Santa Clara streets. Cohesity is renting 40,000 square feet at 300 Park Ave. near Woz Way.\n\nA million-square-foot tech campus is being proposed by realty developers TMG Partners and Valley Oak Partners, which want to replace an old industrial district on the banks of the Guadalupe River with new offices.\n\nAnd Trammell Crow is pushing ahead with its plans to develop a big office, retail and housing complex next to the future Google village.\n\nIn recent weeks, investors also paid $80.2 million for an office tower at 303 Almaden and $64 million for the Westin San Jose hotel, formerly called the Sainte Claire Hotel.\n\n“Downtown San Jose is doing very well,” Hallgrimson said. “The activity downtown is real.”"
