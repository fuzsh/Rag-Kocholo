The historic structure on the site is a two-story, U-shaped building; a fourth side to enclose the courtyard was never built.

They worked to harvest grains and vegetable crops and the ranch also produced hide and tallow. During the Mexican-American War (1846â€“1848), Vallejo was captured and imprisoned. The ranch's activity began to decline as the result of increasing prices due to the Gold Rush and squatters who took up residence on the property. He tried to revive the ranch to no avail and was forced to sell it in 1857. The Native Sons of the Golden West bought the ranch house in 1910 and owned it until the State of California purchased it in 1951.\n\nSources\n\nhttp://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=27191 http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/474/files/petaluma_adobe_sp.pdf\n\nAdditional Information"
