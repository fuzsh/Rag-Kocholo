Have an account? .\n\nYou'd expect Adobe to have a pretty snazzy office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter all, the global software company that sells creative multimedia products specializes in visuals.\n\nWell, recently, Adobe gave Business Insider a peek into their San Jose, California, headquarters. Let's just say, the $67.09 billion company's office tour did not disappoint.\n\nHere's a look at Adobe's office, along with some details on what perks employees enjoy there:\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdobe first moved its headquarters to downtown San Jose, California, in 1994.\n\n2,500 people work at the company's headquarters today. That's one in six of its total 15,000 worldwide employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, the company's headquarters underwent a renovation, led by design company Gensler, updating 143,000 square feet of its workspace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis particular piece was actually created by design firm Antlre Creative, in collaboration with Adobe's digital video and audio team. It's the visualization of an Adobe employee's voice.\n\nAnd on the building's Photoshop floor, there are several \"time capsule\" phone booths. Here's the 1990 booth — note the old Macintosh model running Photoshop 1.0. Whenever you step in to make a phone call, you're stepping back in time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the office's lobbies now has a touch screen that lets guests and employees summon creative inspiration with a flick of their fingers — the screen responds to search terms with images and illustrations.\n\nEmployees looking for an afternoon pick-me-up can head to the office's coffee bar to grab a latte, a cappuccino, or some matcha green tea. If they're hungry, they can also pick up some Nutella cheesecake or raspberry macarons from the in-house pastry chef. Baristas also spice up the menu with daily specials like Vietnamese iced coffee. There's also free drip coffee for people who like to keep things simple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are plenty of other places to grab some grub around Adobe's headquarters. The food isn't free across the board, but it's all subsidized for employees. This particular spot, Layers, is a café featuring coffee and 100% nut-free sandwiches, like the pun-tastic AdoBLT.\n\nEvery Friday, employees gather in Layers for free beer, wine, cheese plates, and even some arcade-style basketball games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPalettes is a slightly bigger cafè with a focus on local ingredients. There's a fresh salad bar, sushi, tacos, and falafel.\n\nThe design for Palettes was inspired by Silicon Valley's history as an orchard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis part of the office around Palettes also features a community garden and a living plant wall.\n\nTemplates is the third and biggest café.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe theme here is \"comfort food from around the world.\"\n\nEmployees can grab curry, Asian wok stir fries, tandoori breads, or burgers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorkers looking to sharpen their culinary skills can also stop by for cooking lessons from the company's executive chef.\n\nThere's also an outdoor patio that's open to employees at all times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUp here, people can work, eat, or just take a break to recharge and talk with coworkers. It's also a great spot for team events.\n\nThe perks at Adobe don't just revolve around eating and sitting, though. The office has its own wellness center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe center is free for employees and holds group fitness classes like spin, yoga, and bootcamp.\n\nThe wellness center's gym is equipped with weights, cardio equipment, and a QueenAx training system, which is a customizable training frame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if the open meditation room isn't private enough for employees, there's also a “Peace in a Pod\" Somadome on-site, which allows Adobe workers to embark on a guided meditation experience in a personal capsule.\n\nMassages are also offered to employees at discounted prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the amenities don't stop there. Adobe also offers on-site vehicle maintenance, dry cleaning, bicycle repair and rental, as well as mother's rooms.\n\nAdobe's employees have responded positively to the perks. They rate them 4.6 stars out of 5 on Glassdoor.\n\nSource: Glassdoor\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the biggest gathering spots in the office is known as \"the steps.\" The amphitheater includes a giant display screen, and enough seats for 170 employees — not to mention ping pong tables for a little good-natured competition.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we’re hoping to bring people together and spark innovation,\" Francom tells Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdobe employs an open office design ...\n\n... but there are plenty of spaces that allow you to slip away ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... and enjoy a quiet moment or two.\n\n\"We’ve created a variety of community areas and alternative work spaces that give our employees the ability to choose where and how to work, and provides the opportunity to meet up and collaborate in new ways,\" Francom says.\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
