        "text": "Gensler partnered with Adobe to design 100 Hooper as a compliment to their existing historic wood-and-brick building just a few blocks away. The project expands their presence in San Francisco’s Design District and creates an urban campus feel. The design supports the wide range of needs and expectations of employees by optimizing experiences outside the standard desk set-up. Work stations and alternative work spaces are strategically positioned along the perimeter to provide natural light and views of the city skyline. Meeting rooms separate work stations from a variety of collaborative areas and third spaces. Amenities intended to support employees’ whole self include a juice bar, full-service cafe, dining hall, all-hands space, VR room, themed “adventure” rooms to drive innovative thinking, and a wellness center."
