        "text": "San Jose has been home to Adobe since 1996. The design and software giant has played a prominent role in the local tech industry’s rapid growth over the years.\n\nThe 2023 opening of their Founders Tower seems to be a fitting tribute to a company with such a large presence in the area. The company described their latest office as the “physical manifestation of what we believe the future of the workplace will be — sustainably built and run, optimized for hybrid, designed for community, adaptable, and resilient to change”.\n\nFew could argue with the sustainable record of the building, with it opening to a Gold LEED certification.\n\nIt is the first all-electric building of such scale to open in Silicon Valley, with its power being generated entirely by solar and wind energy.\n\nThe food hall is the largest all-electric kitchen in North America, which helps contribute to more than 70% of Adobe’s total electricity needs being met by renewable energy. The company is confident that this figure will increase to 100% across all of their operations by as soon as 2025.\n\nThe Founders Tower sits in good company alongside Adobe’s three other corporate towers that have also been LEED certified, including Adobe West, which was credited with platinum certification in 2009 for its high level of sustainability."
