        "text": "Adobe and the Adobe Foundation announced the first-ever Adobe Film & TV Fund committing $6M to support underrepresented creators and filmmakers in finding career opportunities in the film and TV industry. Through this new initiative, the company and Foundation aim to drive greater representation in the film industry by providing resources, community, and support to underrepresented creators on-screen and behind the camera.\n\nThe Film & TV Fund aims to address the inequity in funding and career and training opportunities across multiple communities in the industry with grants, contributions, and fellowships. In the first year of the Fund, Adobe and the Adobe Foundation committed to $6M in grants, contributions, and Adobe Creative Cloud product donations with the goal of tracking inclusion in the industry and directly accelerating the careers of thousands of global creators, and ultimately increasing inclusion in film and TV series, that reach millions worldwide.\n\nAdobe and the Adobe Foundation will collaborate with a cohort of global organizations that are committed to empowering underrepresented communities and making a significant shift in representation for multi-hyphenate creators in film and TV. The initial organizations include Easterseals, Gold House, Latinx House, NAACP, Sundance Institute and Yuvaa, and will focus funding on fellowships and apprenticeships that offer direct, hands-on industry access through mentorships and networking with production houses, studios and distributors to support filmmaking. The grants and contributions will also enable organizations to directly support creators in their communities with funding for short and feature films.\n\n“Diversity in front of and behind the camera is key to unlocking more diverse and more inclusive storytelling across TV and Film,” said Stacy Martinet, VP Marketing Strategy and Communications, Adobe, and member of the Adobe Foundation board. “Through our new Film & TV Fund, Adobe is looking to leverage its leadership position in the creative industry to unlock new opportunities for underrepresented creators.”\n\nThe first fellowship program will kick off with NAACP, specifically designed to increase diverse representation in the post-production industry. The 14-week fellowship program will focus on education and training, career growth and workplace experience and will include access to Adobe Creative Cloud to further set up emerging creators with the necessary tools they need, as well as training, industry mentorships, masterclass lectures, workplace rotations and more. Applications for the NAACP fellowship will open on January 18 for four fellows, with the program starting in May of this year. For more info and/or to apply, visit the NAACP Editing Fellowship site.\n\n“Equity matters, and it is incumbent upon those of us who sit in positions of power and authority to help identify solutions to advance diversity and inclusion both in front of and behind the lens,” said Kyle Bowser, senior vice president of the NAACP Hollywood Bureau. “It’s an honor to work with a like-minded partner in Adobe, who shows up at the table with ideas and resources that make a tangible impact.”"
