        "text": "The City of Mountain View is located about 40 miles (64 km) southeast of San Francisco, California. Mountain View is home to many technology companies, and is where Adobe Systems was originally founded.\n\nStatistics[]\n\nWith an estimated population of 82,376 as of 2021, Mountain View is the 105th most populous city in the state of California.[1]\n\nHistory[]\n\nAdobe Systems was founded in Mountain View on December 19, 1982 and had its headquarters located on Charleston Road. However, Adobe co-founder Charles Geschke was kidnapped from the company parking lot on May 26, 1992 and held for ransom for 4 days before being freed by the FBI.[2] In a separate incident on September 5, 1992, Adobe engineer Laurie Houts was found murdered less than 2 miles from the company's offices. Adobe has since relocated to San Jose and the surrounding area in Mountain View is now home to the campus headquarters of Google.[3][4]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nCity of Mountain View official website\n\nMountain View at the Apple Wiki\n\nMountain View, California at Wikipedia\n\nThis article is a stub.
