        "text": "The history of Adobe can be traced back as far as the late ’70s! Adobe Systems Incorporated has produced products that are used in various ways. This company has created many applications that help make, edit, design, and digitize text/images. Some of their applications include Photoshop, Illustrator, PDF, and InDesign, to name a few of their products. With all the Adobe applications out there, one may start to wonder how it all began, what the company had to go through to become so successful, and how much of an impact Adobe has presently. Even with these curiosities, it is inevitable that this company has become one of the top software providers for a wide range of industries.\n\nFounders – John Warnock and Chuck Geschke\n\nThe history of Adobe started when John Warnock and Chuck Geschke both worked at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC) in the late 1970s. They were American computer scientists. While working at this company, computer scientists had to research devices for independent graphics systems and printers. This research inspired them to create software to translate digital text and images from computers onto printed pages. By December 1982, the company Adobe Systems Incorporated was established.\n\nAdobe Creek in Los Altos, California\n\nJohn and Chuck named the company after Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, where Adobe’s history began. A little fun fact is that this creek was right behind John’s house. John’s wife, Marva, a graphic designer, designed the company’s first logo, which was later changed in 1992. Their first product was PostScript, which “provided a practical alternative to the restrictions and complexities of the print publishing industry” (Inc., Ivestintech.com). After this development, they signed their first contract with Apple to license this software. Subsequently, the following were developed: Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Type Manager. The growing success of Adobe technologies has established the company as a reliable and high-quality solutions provider.\n\nChallenges\n\nWorking in the computer science industry has many challenges, especially when it comes to competitors. On the other hand, becoming successful was not always easy. When Adobe created the Portable Document Format (PDF), they had many emulators such as AnyView, Common Ground, Replica, and many more. However, numerous computer users do not remember the names of these companies. This is because consumers preferred to use the PDF format, which led to the program becoming the standard software for sharing/printing electronic files by the late 1990s.\n\nIn the history of Adobe – 1998, Quark Inc. made an offer.\n\nTheir “motto” was “Adobe Systems Incorporated develops and supports products to help people express and use information in more imaginative and meaningful ways across print and electronic media” (Adobe Systems Incorporated). At this point, other companies noticed Adobe’s accomplishments and knew that this company would continue to grow. By 1998, Quark Inc. offered to acquire all the shares of Adobe Systems Incorporated. Still, Adobe declined this proposal because this business opportunity could harm its customers. Undeniably, this offer was soon withdrawn. It is clear that Adobe cares about its consumers and will continue to develop applications that will benefit customers and revolutionize the computer science industry.\n\nCreative Cloud\n\nAdobe has many different programs the company offers for anyone trying to use. The Creative Cloud in Adobe includes programs that many people and businesses utilize for everyday use. These programs include: After Effects, Illustrator, Photoshop, Animate, InDesign, Adobe Premiere Pro, Dreamweaver, Creative Cloud, Adobe Muse, and Photoshop Lightroom. Many companies use some of the programs that Adobe offers for everyday business.\n\nThe critical importance of design\n\nAccording to the Adobe website, the history of Adobe has taught us that Adobe has a significant impact on the design of businesses in the modern-day business world. The four points that are key to the importance of design for business are the role of design today, design-driven companies have outperformed the S&P index by 219% over ten years, companies that foster creativity enjoy 1.5x more significant market share, and 71% of companies report creating 10x the number of assets today than just a few years ago.\n\nMost companies believe that design is a massive impact because it helps grab the customers’ attention by designing their businesses and providing customer service to get the customers to come back. This can mainly include the designs of websites and social media accounts of the companies.\n\nAdobe products and careers\n\nAs can be found on the internet, Adobe is vast in providing essential programs for people’s careers. Adobe Photoshop is the program that most photographers use for their businesses. This program allows photographers to edit their photos, create new designs, banners for their websites, logos for businesses, and so much more. Adobe Photoshop is one of the most heavily relied-on programs for most companies because they use it for advertising their business to the world. If Adobe Photoshop did not exist, many companies would have to figure out how to edit their photos themselves or have someone create their programs for photos.\n\nAdobe Animate History\n\nAdobe history has only continued to deliver great tools and resources. For example, Adobe Animate was previously called Flash Professional CC until HTML5 was incorporated into the program. This program was released in 2016 to draw, illustrate, and animate. It is said that Adobe Animate has reached over one billion devices worldwide. Thus proving that many people use it for businesses daily.\n\nAdobe Animate is used to create animations that companies use to advertise on websites or social media. These animations are seen by customers and used to attract them to their businesses or buy their products. Animation has become vital for companies in the coming yearsAdobe Premiere\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro is a program in Adobe that allows you to edit videos to use them for things like advertisements. This program makes your videos appealing to audiences if you use this from a business perspective. The videos made here can be used for ads on websites, billboards, and commercials so that many people can see your advertisement simultaneously. Premiere Pro is one of the main places to edit and enhance videos because it makes it much easier, and Adobe has all the tools you need in the program to create a spectacular video for your audience.\n\nDreamweaver\n\nThe program Adobe Dreamweaver is essential for creating websites and the things that go onto the websites. Adobe Dreamweaver has been virtually at the forefront of web design history. For example, it enables web designers to understand the anatomy of a website and follow the stages of web design. You can also define page structure with HTML and layout and style web pages with CSS.\n\nAdobe Dreamweaver allows people or businesses to publish and manage their websites for other people’s viewing or to run their businesses. This program is key to helping people figure out how to create websites and what you need to create websites. Dreamweaver is a straightforward program, and there are many tutorials on the internet to teach people how to use the program.\n\nAdobe Muse\n\nAdobe Muse is a program that offers to help provide navigation for people on websites. This program allows people to design websites to make sitemaps and easily add navigation through links to find their way around the website easily. Muse allows you to create hyperlinks, headers/footers, and a responsive web page.\n\nThis program is beneficial because it enables people to find everything they need on a website without needing help and quickly. This is very big for businesses because if customers do not know how to buy the products they want on the website, they will most likely stop searching for them. This will cause businesses to lose money because they have not been given an easy way to navigate the website.\n\nAdobe InDesign\n\nAdobe InDesign is used on Adobe for creating the layout and design of web pages. This can be done by making the text and graphics of any web page. You can also resize any elements of your layout in Adobe InDesign. InDesign is used to create brochures, business cards, postcards, flyers, and professional resumes. This program helps bring together the website to appeal to the customer and catch a customer’s attention. It also has cool features like wrapping text around images and adding images to table-based layouts. This program helps people put the finishing touches on the websites they create.\n\nAdobe After Effects\n\nAdobe’s history with After Effects has to be one of the coolest and most eye-catching programs that Adobe has to offer. This program is based on creating special effects for videos that are made. Things like adding special effects, animating logos, hoverboard effects, and enhancing videos with shapes, are examples of what you can do with After Effects. This program shares some files that are also found in Photoshop and Illustrator. One of the most extraordinary abilities is fixing unusable videos because they might be unfinished or corrupted. There are other incredible abilities, like creating Hollywood movie titles. Some Hollywood movies probably use Adobe for their films because it is effortless and appealing.\n\nFast-forwarding from the history of Adobe\n\nToday, Adobe Systems incorporate a vast amount of quality software for creators, developers, and enterprises. Also, software for video editing, app designing, game designing, and many more. After many years of product expansion, John and Chuck retired as Chief Executive Officers and procured the board’s position in 2000. In 2002, Bruce Chizen was placed as the company’s new CEO. After that, in 2007, came Shantanu Narayen, who successfully “led the company through the marketing and financial transition of providing enterprise platform technology, in addition to its already popular desktop software” (Inc., Ivestintech.com).\n\nSummary of the History of Adobe\n\nAdobe has been using these programs for many years and will continue to serve beneficial applications to many people. The reliance on jobs and careers, no doubt, rests on Adobe products. Adobe is a massive part of the business world, and business would not be the same without it.\n\nAdobe continues to develop and support user groups, forums, and communities on its website, www.adobe.com.
