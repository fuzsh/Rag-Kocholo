When they give money to eligible nonprofits and schools, we match their donations up to US$10,000 per year. We also donate US$25 for every hour they volunteer.\n\nVolunteering\n\nAdobe employees are motivated to make a positive impact in the places where they live and work. Community Impact Teams are comprised of employees across 25+ global locations who coordinate volunteering opportunities with local nonprofit partners. In 2023, our employees contributed over 200K volunteer hours for the causes they care most about.\n\nEmployee Community Fund\n\nEach year Adobe employees come together to give voice to causes that matter to their communities and invite local nonprofits to apply for grants. This multi-million-dollar employee-driven grantmaking program supports hundreds of nonprofits addressing challenges in the communities where we live and work.\n\nPro Bono Initiative\n\nWhen employees volunteer their technology, design, and marketing skills to nonprofits, they help our communities and develop their own expertise and leadership. Throughout the year, Adobe employees volunteer their skills and expertise to strategic projects that help our nonprofit partners reach their missions.\n\nBoard Service Program\n\nTo empower Adobe employees to share their valuable knowledge, experience, and skills with nonprofits, we offer training to become effective members of boards of directors for community organizations. We also help them find the board that meets their personal passions and support their service with annual grants and product licenses."
