OAMJs are a relatively recent phenomenon, and have been characterised as having four key characteristics: large size; broad disciplinary scope; a Gold-OA business model; and a peer-review policy that seeks to determine only the scientific soundness of the research rather than evaluate the novelty or significance of the work. Our investigation focuses on four key modes of analysis: journal outputs (the number of articles published and changes in output over time); OAMJ author characteristics (nationalities and institutional affiliations); subject areas (the disciplinary scope of OAMJs, and variations in sub-disciplinary output); and citation profiles (the citation distributions of each OAMJ, and the impact of citing journals). We found that while the total output of the eleven mega-journals grew by 14.9% between 2014 and 2015, this growth is largely attributable to the increased output of Scientific Reports and Medicine. We also found substantial variation in the geographical distribution of authors. Several journals have a relatively high proportion of Chinese authors, and we suggest this may be linked to these journals' high Journal Impact Factors (JIFs). The mega-journals were also found to vary in subject scope, with several journals publishing disproportionately high numbers of articles in certain sub-disciplines. Our citation analsysis offers support for BjÃ¶rk & Catani's suggestion that OAMJs's citation distributions can be similar to those of traditional journals, while noting considerable variation in citation rates across the eleven titles. We conclude that while the OAMJ term is useful as a means of grouping journals which share a set of key characteristics, there is no such thing as a \"typical\" mega-journal, and we suggest several areas for additional research that might help us better understand the current and future role of OAMJs in\n\nThe Extent of and Reasons for Non Re-Enrollment: A Case of Korea National Open University\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChoi, Hyoseon; Lee, Yekyung; Jung, Insung; Latchem, Colin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDespite continuous efforts to increase retention, dropout rates are high in distance universities.

Rezanur RAHMAN\n\n2006-04-01\n\nFull Text Available A new member of the mega-Universities, Bangladesh Open University (BOU introduced a course team approach for developing effective course materials for distance students. BOU teaching media includes printed course books, study guides, radio and television broadcasts, audiocassettes and occasional face-to-face tutorials. Each course team comprises specialist course writer(s, editor, trained style editor, graphic designer,illustrator, audio-visual producer and anonymous referees. An editorial board or preview committee is responsible for the final approval for publishing or broadcasting materials for learners. This approach has been proved to be effective, but appeared to be complicated and time-consuming. This report focuses on the quality and processes of BOU course materials development taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of the current approach.\n\nEXPERIENCES AND TENSIONS OF TUTURING AT ALLAMA IQBAL OPEN UNIVERSITY (AIOU PAKISTAN\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNabi Bux JUMANI\n\n2009-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Pakistan is a country with thick population of 160 million. Its geographical area is 796,096-sq. Km. Its 69% of population lives in rural areas and rest in urban. Since the education of rural people is a difficult task for the government therefore, there emerged a need of open and distance in Pakistan. Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU is the first Open University in Asia. It was established in 1974 and now has earned the status of Mega University. AIOU is a Distance Education institution, which provides multi disciplinary education from basic to doctoral level programs. The university employs non-formal method of correspondence, radio and television broadcasts, special textbooks and reading materials prepared on self-learning basis, part-time teachers (tutors engaged nearest to the student's residences. The university has more than 36 regional campuses and centers in various parts of the country to coordinate and facilitate decentralized system of education of the university. The regional directors keep a roster of qualified teachers and experts in each field of study in their area and enlist them as the universityâs part-time tutors.The number of registered tutors with AIOU is more than 30,000. Each group of students is entrusted to a tutor for guidance. Assignments written by the students are evaluated by the tutors and returned to them, with comments. The regional campuses also arrange practical training, teaching practice, workshops and seminars and facilitate holding of examinations in their own areas. This study presents data from a study of experiences of distance education tutors at Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU, Pakistan, in the use of face-to-face tuition to support their students undertaking teacher training programmes at a distance. It explores the tensions for âface-to-faceâ teachers involved in âdistance teachingâ courses, and discusses these in terms of the tutorsâ perceptions of the ways in which face\n\nThe Openness of the University of the Philippines Open University: Issues and Prospects\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaria Fe Villamejor-Mendoza\n\n2013-05-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper is a self-reflection on the state of openness of the University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU. An exploratory and descriptive study, it aims not only to define the elements of openness of UPOU, but also to unravel the causes and solutions to the issues and concerns that limit its options to becoming a truly open university. It is based on four parameters of openness, which are widely universal in the literature, e.g., open admissions, open curricula, distance education at scale, and the co-creation, sharing and use of open educational resources (OER. It draws from the perception survey among peers, which the author conducted in UPOU in July and August 2012. It also relies on relevant secondary materials on the subject.\n\nIntroducing Collabra, OA Journal from University of California Press\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMorgan, Daniel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAn introductory presentation of Collabra, the open access mega journal from University of California Press, highlighting its unique business model which shares and spreads revenue back to the research community.Â (Presented at the FORCE 2015 conference at the University of Oxford, January 13, 2015.)\n\nDevelopment and calibration of the tracking Compton/Pair telescope MEGA\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKanbach, G.; Andritschke, R.; Zoglauer, A.; Ajello, M.; McConnell, M.L.; Macri, J.R.; Ryan, J.M.; Bloser, P.; Hunter, S.; DiCocco, G.; Kurfess, J.; Reglero, V.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nWe describe the development and tests of the prototype for a new telescope for Medium Energy Gamma-ray Astronomy (MEGA) in the energy band 0.4-50 MeV. As a successor to COMPTEL and EGRET (at low energies), MEGA aims to improve the sensitivity for astronomical sources by at least an order of magnitude. It could thus fill the severe sensitivity gap between scheduled or operating hard-X-ray and high-energy gamma-ray missions and open the way for a future Advanced Compton Telescope. MEGA records and images Î³-rays by completely tracking Compton and Pair creation events in a stack of double-sided Si-strip track detectors surrounded by a pixelated CsI calorimeter. A scaled down prototype has been built and we describe technical details of its design and properties. Results from calibrations using radioactive sources and from measurements with an accelerator generated, fully polarized, Î³-ray beam are presented and an outlook to future plans with MEGA is given\n\nTreasure Chase: Mega Gifts Are Down--But Are They out?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMayer, Caroline E.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nJust a few years ago, the University of Notre Dame averaged about six mega gifts--$10 million or more--a year.

With over 56 percent of the global population, Asia has over 70 universities that are dedicated to open access to education, including seven out of 11 of the world's mega universities (universities with over 100,000 active students in degree-level courses serving six million active students all together (Daniel, 1996. Quite a few distance teaching universities or programs such as the Bangladeshi Open University, the Hanoi Open University, the Open University Malaysia, and the Open and Distance Learning Program in Singapore, have been established since the 1990s and now provide tertiary level education to those seeking continuing education opportunities. Virtual universities are growing fast and, with 17 virtual universities in Korea alone! Many conventional, campus-based universities have started to offer e-Learning programs as well. For example, 67 e-Colleges have been established within conventional research universities in China.\n\nWhy Academics Choose to Publish in a Mega-Journal\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShopovski, Jovan; Marolov, Dejan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWith their broad scope, high publishing volume, a peer review process based on the scientific soundness of the content, and an open access model, mega journals have become an important part of scholarly publishing.

This paper examines the experiences of Universitas Terbuka (UT, which has initiated and implemented an innovative strategy of quality assurance (QA for continuous improvement. The credo of the UT quality assurance system is \"We write what we do. We do what we write. We check. We improve continuously!\" Implementing a quality management system at the UT, a mega-university with a student body of more than a quarter of a million and which involved a network of participating institutions and regional centres, was a formidable task to accomplish. To achieve its lofty goal, UT adopted and contextualised the draft of the Asian Association of Open Universities (AAOU QA Framework to launch its own quality assurance program. This has taken a great deal of commitment and participation of all staff involved. QA at the UT required systematic and step-by-step processes, including development of the QA framework and job manuals, raising awareness and commitment amongst all staff involved, internal assessment, and integration of QA programs into the university's annual action plans, external assessment and benchmarking. This paper concludes that quality assurance must be developed as institutional policy and strategy for continuous improvement.\n\nAircushion Supported Mega-Floaters\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nVan Kessel, J.L.F.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe increase of the global population and expanding coastal mega-cities will necessitate an innovative pursuit of the utilization of the ocean space in which mega-floaters will play an important role in the future. These types of structures are very large floating artificial islands that can be used\n\n[A high sensitivity search for mu gamma: The mega experiment at LAMPF\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n1990-01-01\n\nDuring the past 12 month period the Valparaiso University group has been active on LAMPF experiment 969, known as the MEGA experiment. This experiment is a search for the decay Î¼ -> e Î³, a decay which would violate lepton number conservation and which is strictly forbidden by the standard model for electroweak interactions. Previous searches for this decay mode have set limit the present day limit of 4.9 x 10 -11 .

One of the major issues effecting environment proper disposal of sewage and development of sewage system including recycling of sewage water and its use. The heavy pressure of population calls for adequate provision of sewage disposal in the new areas and remodeling of systems in the old areas of the cities to ensure a pollution-free environment. Recycling of sewage and prevention of sewage discharge into natural water channels and the sea has to be undertaken on urgent bases. The paper seeks to outline the present status of sewage system of the city of Karachi, the problems involved and the proposals for management and development of the system compatible with the need and requirement of mega-city population.

Considerando-se que nos \"megas\" a ICC, a hipertrofia do miocÃ¡rdio e a lesÃ£o vorticilar sÃ£o fenÃ´menos raros, nossos achados (atuais e anteriores sugerem que estes estejam relacionados principalmente com a agressÃ£o inflamatÃ³ria ao miocÃ¡rdio ventricular, uma vez que a desnervaÃ§Ã£o Ã©, geralmente, mais acentuada nos casos de \"megas\" que nos de ICC.The study of 20 hearts from chagasic patients with \"megas \" and of others 20 from chagasics without \"megas\" with heart failure, shows that both, myocardial Jibrosis and inflammatory exudate are light in cases with \"megas\" and severe in group with heart failure. In chagasic with \"megas\" the myocardial hypertrophy, the apical lesion and the cardiac insufficiency are infrequent. Ourfindings suggest that they are related to the myocardial ventricular inflammation and not to the cardiac denervation. This latter is more severe in cases of \"megas\" than in cases of congestive heart failure without \"megas\".\n\nThe Extent of and Reasons for Non Re-Enrollment: A Case of Korea National Open University\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHyoseon Choi\n\n2013-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Despite continuous efforts to increase retention, dropout rates are high in distance universities. The objectives of this study were: 1 to investigate the extent and causes of non re-enrollment at a mega university, Korea National Open University; and 2 to suggest actions to improve the retention of students, in general, and those with higher risks of dropout in particular. A survey designed to establish the student demographics and the studentsâ main reasons for non re-enrollment was carried out during spring, 2009 with 1,353 respondents. The results indicate that a lack of feedback from the instructors, heavy workload, and difficulties in studying at a distance were the main reasons for non re-enrollment. The learnersâ perceptions of the value of the degrees and their ages, gender, and educational backgrounds were also found to be significant factors in decisions not to re-enroll. The suggested solutions for reducing non re-enrollment include: a decrease in the number of required credit hoursâ study per semester; the provision of stronger social support; the introduction of a more flexible enrollment system; and better use of the available technology and infrastructure to help both students and instructors build stronger learning communities.\n\nTHE CENTURY OF MEGA - DAGUOS. THE CHARTER OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE AMONG THE MEGA - DAGUOS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMÄdÄlina Virginia ANTONESCU\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The current paper discusses the origins of the concept of âdaguoâ, a term used in the Chinese academic literature to refer to the âgreat powersâ. We will use a particular concept, i.e. âmega -daguoâ, to refer to entities higher than the great powers (states, in the classic sense, that is new, trans-state or super -state actors of transcontinental or continental dimensions. Such entities create fusions among different civilizations; they have a specific behaviour, distinct from the behaviour of great powers, as currently perceived by us, in the traditional sense of the term. The current paper analyses the typology of mega-daguos; we will refer to the post-Huntingtonian age, that of a world which has overcome the dualist paradigm of the âinevitable conflictâ among the civilizations, a world which has turned the principle of dialogue among the mega-daguos into a fundamental principle underlying a world of colossi. The last part of the paper proposes a fundamental document of the new world of post-state actors (mega-daguos, for the 21st century. We will call it theâCharter of peaceful coexistence among the mega-daguosâ, with an approach to the issue of reorganizing the UN, in order to be able to come to terms with such reality, in the 21stcentury post-state world based on a global law, in which post - state actors are also legally responsible for their behaviour and their decisions, at global level.\n\nOpen University\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nPentz,M\n\n1975-01-01\n\nMichel Pentz est nÃ©e en Afrique du Sud et venu au Cern en 1957 comme physicien et prÃ©sident de l'associaion du personnel.

Here, we report a transformation of Mega to enable cross-platform use on Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems. Mega X does not require virtualization or emulation software and provides a uniform user experience across platforms. Mega X has additionally been upgraded to use multiple computing cores for many molecular evolutionary analyses. Mega X is available in two interfaces (graphical and command line) and can be downloaded from www.megasoftware.net free of charge.\n\nCan a marginally open universe amplify magnetic fields?\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShtanov, Yuri; Sahni, Varun\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn a series of recent papers, including arXiv:1210.1183, it was claimed that large-scale magnetic fields generated during inflation in a spatially open universe could remain astrophysically significant at the present time since they experienced superadiabatic amplification specific to an open universe. We reexamine this assertion and show that, on the contrary, large-scale magnetic fields in a realistic open universe decay in much the same manner as they would in a spatially flat universe. Consequently, their amplitude today is extremely small (B 0 â¼ â59 G) and is unlikely to be of astrophysical significance\n\nMesozoic evolution of the Tisza Mega-unit\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHaas, JÃ¡nos; PÃ©rÃ³, Csaba\n\nThe south-eastern part of the basement of the Pannonian Basin is made up of Variscan crystalline complexes and early Mesozoic formations showing striking affinity with the corresponding formations in the southern margin of the European Plate. This large composite structural unit, which is actually an exotic terrane of European Plate origin, has been named the Tisza Mega-unit. Based upon relevant data of the pre-Tertiary basement of southern Hungary the reconstruction of the position of the Tisza Terrane in the early Alpine evolutionary stages, the process of its separation and break-off from the European Plate, and results of its Eo-Alpine deformations are summarised in the present paper. In the Variscan and early Alpine evolutionary stages the area of the later Tisza Mega-unit was located at the margin of the European Plate. During Variscan orogeny terrane accretion led to intensive deformation and metamorphism in this belt. This was followed by transpressional tectonics and the development of molasse basins in the late and post-Variscan stages, and passive margin evolution after the Neotethys opening in the Middle Triassic. The separation of the Tisza Mega-unit began with incipient continental rifting along the axis of the later Ligurian-Penninic-Vahic oceanic branch in the Late Triassic. The end of terrigenous material deposition in the most external zones, and a coeval change in fossil assemblage, point to the separation of the Tisza Block from the European Plate in the Early Bathonian. Significant rotation of the Tisza Mega-unit and coeval paroxysm of alkaline rift-type basalt volcanism took place in the Early Cretaceous. In the mid-Cretaceous, due to the northward motion of the Adria Block and the related closure of the westernmost Neotethys basin, the extensional regime changed to a compressional one, leading to onset of the nappe stacking and low-grade regional metamorphism within the Tisza microplate. In the foreland of the nappe systems flexural basins\n\nCHINAâS RADIO AND TV UNIVERSITIES AND THE BRITISH OPEN UNIVERSITY: A Comparative Study\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nReviewed by Desmond KEEGAN\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This book is a major contribution to the fields of distance education research, the field of comparative education and to the history of Chinese and British education.The book undertakes an impossible task: the comparative study of Chinaâs Radio and TV universities and of the British Open University. The task is impossible because the two entities to be compared are essentially disparate. The British Open University (OUUK is a single university set up at Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom by Royal Charter. Chinaâs Radio and TV universities, known as the Dianda system, is a network of 45 open universities set up all over China. The essence of the success of the British Open University was its creation as a full university, offering its own university degrees on the same level as all the other universities in the country. The Dianda institutions were set up in what Wei calls the âadult higher education sectorâ in China, offering what Wei calls sub-degrees and always regarded as inferior both to the great Chinese universities (Beijing University, Qinghua University, Fudan\n\n\"The Open Library at AU\" (Athabasca University): Supporting Open Access and Open Educational Resources\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nElliott, Colin; Fabbro, Elaine\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo address challenges that learners, course creators, librarians and academics involved with OER and MOOCs are facing when looking for scholarly materials, Athabasca University Library has initiated the development of \"the Open Library at AU.\" This open library is a full library website that provides easy access to open and freeâ¦\n\nVarious Portraits of Finnish Open University Students\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJauhiainen, Arto; Nori, Hanna; Alho-Malmelin, Marika\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis article describes and analyses the background and goals of students at the Finnish open university in the beginning of the twenty-first century.

Responses will be diverse of course but the potential is so manifest that many institutions probably will consider the benefits to outweigh the barriers. The National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN has decided to combine its âclassicalâ openness with the new digital openness by fully embracing the OER approach and converting its complete course base into OER. Step-by-step, NOUN is currently implementing its strategy towards becoming an OER-based Open University with a special niche for MOOCs. During a launch event in December 2015, the first 40 OER-based courses were presented as well as the first 3 OER-based MOOCs. This paper therefore presents NOUNâs OER strategy with insight on lessons learned.

The MEGA photon detector is designed to observe the 52.38 MeV photon produced in a Î¼ â eÎ³ decay with an energy resolution of 1.25 MeV, a position resolution of 2 x 5 mm 2 , a directional resolution of 10 degrees, a time resolution of 500 ps, and an efficiency of 7%. It will consists of four independent concentric cylindrical pair spectrometers mounted within a 1.5 T magnetic field produced by a superconducting solenoid magnet. Each pair spectrometer includes two thin Pb foils to convert photons into e + e - pairs, and thereby, determine both their locations and their vector momenta. The inner drift chamber layer includes a delay line cathode to determine the z coordinates needed for track reconstruction. An MWPC located between two Pb layers identifies the conversion layer so that energy loss corrections may be applied, while plastic scintillators provide timing information. Our, group together with a group from the University of Houston, is responsible for the design and construction of the photon detector, as well as developing the computer codes necessary for Monte Carlo simulations and data analysis. During the past year, our efforts have focused primarily on two tasks, delay line cathode read-out and software development. This report describes our recent work on delay lines and data analysis along with a discussion of the new plans for multiplexing in the photon arm\n\nNEW TRENDS IN LEGAL EDUCATION AT BANGLADESH OPEN UNIVERSITY\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNahid FERDOUSI\n\n2008-04-01\n\nFull Text Available In Bangladesh, Formal legal education is provided by either a department of a university or an affiliated college. There are four public universities and above twenty six private universities in our country with law as a regular subject of teaching. Besides, the National University imparts teaching of law through law colleges in the country. All public and private universities providing law graduate degree by conventional system but many people deprived from this opportunities. Thus to increase equitable access to education and to develop the human resources of the country the Bangladesh Open University playing significant role. Large numbers of students of rural areas, particularly women, out of school and adults who must do work to support their families are include with the university. Bangladesh Open University is the only institution in Bangladesh which imparts education in open and distance mode and offers 23 formal programmes, the demand for the introduction of LL.B programme for the benefit of those who have been, for various reasons, deprived of the opportunity of undertaking graduate course in law in conventional mode of education. The decision to offer the programme in distance mode is being taken in response to the earnest desire of the relevant quarters expressed in various dailies and formal applications submitted to the university authority as the learners in the open and distance mode learn at his own place and any time whenever he feels convenient to learn and is not for restricted by time, space or age. Distance learning is, indeed, presently considered as a viable alternative of the conventional system of education to fulfill the growing demand for legal education.This paper presents the new academic trends in Bangladesh Open University by distance learning Bachelor of Laws (LL.B. degree and modern aspects of the legal education at School of Law in Bangladesh Open University.\n\n(O)Mega split\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBenakli, Karim; DarmÃ©, Luc; Goodsell, Mark D. [Sorbonne UniversitÃ©s, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMR 7589,LPTHE, F-75005, Paris (France); CNRS, UMR 7589,LPTHE, F-75005, Paris (France)\n\n2015-11-16\n\nWe study two realisations of the Fake Split Supersymmetry Model (FSSM), the simplest model that can easily reproduce the experimental value of the Higgs mass for an arbitrarily high supersymmetry scale M{sub S}, as a consequence of swapping higgsinos for equivalent states, fake higgsinos, with suppressed Yukawa couplings. If the LSP is identified as the main Dark matter component, then a standard thermal history of the Universe implies upper bounds on M{sub S}, which we derive. On the other hand, we show that renormalisation group running of soft masses aboveM{sub S} barely constrains the model â in stark contrast to Split Supersymmetry â and hence we can have a âMega Splitâ spectrum even with all of these assumptions and constraints, which include the requirements of a correct relic abundance, a gluino life-time compatible with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and absence of signals in present direct detection experiments of inelastic dark matter. In an appendix we describe a related scenario, Fake Split Extended Supersymmetry, which enjoys similar properties.\n\nSistem Keamanan Pintu Berbasis Arduino Mega\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAkbar iskandar\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available AbstractÂ : This study aims is to 1 design prototype security room lecturer room based arduino mega integrated with Fingerprint and camera, 2 Testing the effectiveness of prototype security room door lecturer.

This brief paper shows in a numerical example how mega-events may lead to inflated multipliers and exaggerated claims of economic benefits.\n\nFrom Ephemeral Planning to Permanent Urbanism: An Urban Planning Theory of Mega-Events\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEva Kassens-Noor\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Mega-events like the Olympic Games are powerful forces that shape cities. In the wake of mega-events, a variety of positive and negative legacies have remained in host cities. In order to bring some theoretical clarity to debates about legacy creation, I introduce the concepts of the mega-event utopia, dystopia and heterotopia. A mega-event utopia is ideal and imaginary urbanism embracing abstract concepts about economies, socio-political systems, spaces, and societies in the host during events. The mega-event utopia (in contrast to other utopian visions other stakeholders may hold is dictated by the desires of the mega-event owners irrespective of the realities in the event host. In short, a mega-event utopia is the perfect event host from the ownerâs perspective. Mega-event utopias are suggested as a theoretical model for the systematic transformation of their host cities. As large-scale events progress as ever more powerful transformers into this century, mega-event dystopias have emerged as negatives of these idealistic utopias. As hybrid post-event landscapes, mega-event heterotopias manifest the temporary mega-event utopia as legacy imprints into the long-term realities in hosting cities. Using the Olympic utopia as an example of a mega-event utopia, I theorize utopian visions around four urban traits: economy, image, infrastructure and society. Through the concept of the mega-event legacy utopia, I also provide some insight toward the operationalization of the four urban traits for a cityâs economic development, local place marketing, urban development, and public participation.\n\nMEGAS multi-electrode gas sensor system. Final report; MEGAS - Multi-Elektroden-Gassensorsystem. Abschlussbericht\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKelleter, J.\n\n2003-07-01\n\nIn the context of the MEGAS project, GTE developed and and constructed an electronic system for controlling and data acquisition of sensors for laboratory and test applications. The system is based on microcontrollers and has a data bus connection. Measurements made in order to find out whether the concentrations of a binary gas mixture and combustion gases are detected separately were successful. A demonstration system was constructed. The MEGAS project showed that it is possible to separate two gases by a sensitive layer at constant sensor temperature. The sensor element is a promising technology. Further research is required on suppressing sensor poisoning by siloxanes, and on reduced sensitivity to interfering gases (e.g. ethanol in the case of combustion gases).

A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn this study, changes in the occurrences of heat waves on the globe since the mid- 20th century and the synoptic characteristics of mega heat waves at regional scales in the warmer climate are examined. The NCEP-NCAR reanalysis surface data show that there have been no obvious linear changes in the heat wave frequencies at the continental scales since the mid-20th century, but amplified interdecadal variations led to unprecedented intense heat waves in the recent decades at the regional scales. Such mega heat waves have been more frequently observed in the poleward subtropical climate belts as well as in the interior region of continents. According to the analyses of upper tropospheric data, the occurrences of more intense mega heat waves since the late 20th century may be associated with the expansion of subtropical high pressures. These results suggest that populous cities near the subtropical climate zones should provide proactive mega heat wave warning systems for residents due to their vulnerability to the sudden attack of human lives harvest by mega heat waves in the warmer 21st century.\n\nSlow decay of magnetic fields in open Friedmann universes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBarrow, John D.; Tsagas, Christos G.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nMagnetic fields in Friedmann universes can experience superadiabatic growth without departing from conventional electromagnetism. The reason is the relativistic coupling between vector fields and spacetime geometry, which slows down the decay of large-scale magnetic fields in open universes, compared to that seen in perfectly flat models. The result is a large relative gain in magnetic strength that can lead to astrophysically interesting B fields, even if our Universe is only marginally open today\n\nCultural Mega-Events as an International, Cultural, and Political Tool\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJulia Nikolaeva\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This article is an attempt to offer a conceptual understanding of various kinds of mega-events and to determine their significance as an instrument of the official international cultural policy. The article examines scientific approaches to understanding and classification of mega-events. The case studies focus on such mega-events as international cross-cultural years and cultural forums. The fact that the official foreign policy ofÂ¬ten defines and shapes the goals of mega-events proves their value in establishing and promoting a positive international image of the country. Recent Russian experience in organizing cross-cultural years is examined to discuss positive and negative socio-cultural impact.\n\nCosmic microwave background anomalies in an open universe.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiddle, Andrew R; CortÃªs, Marina\n\n2013-09-13\n\nWe argue that the observed large-scale cosmic microwave anomalies, discovered by WMAP and confirmed by the Planck satellite, are most naturally explained in the context of a marginally open universe. Particular focus is placed on the dipole power asymmetry, via an open universe implementation of the large-scale gradient mechanism of Erickcek etÂ al. Open inflation models, which are motivated by the string landscape and which can excite \"supercurvature\" perturbation modes, can explain the presence of a very-large-scale perturbation that leads to a dipole modulation of the power spectrum measured by a typical observer. We provide a specific implementation of the scenario which appears compatible with all existing constraints.\n\nSistem Informasi Penjualan Berbasis Kinerja pada Proyek Apartemen Mega City Bekasi\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDyani Ayu Aisyah\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Mega City Apartment Bekasi is an integrated residence with shopping and office center developed by PT.

Exploratory insights from literature\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChanaron Jean Jacques\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Mega-sport events such as Olympic Games or Football World Cup are always presented as providing the hosting nation and/or city with huge benefits. Supporters of such events quote economic, social and cultural impacts for the region as well as contributions to scientific and technological progress and innovation. obviously, they need to politically justify the impressive and growing financial investment required by organizing Olympic Games or World Cup. The article aims at looking at a quite abundant academic literature with the objectives of defining the various potential impacts and the methods used for their assessment. It concludes that there is no universal and scientifically valid model for evaluating the benefits of mega-sport events and that organizers should be very cautious when arguing in favor of deciding to host such events.\n\nÎ³ radiation dosimetry in Mega rad range using sugar solution\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nVenkataramani, R.; Mehta, S.K.; Soman, S.D.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThe formation of malonaldehyde under Î³ irradiation of solid sucrose and aqueous sucrose, fructose and arabinose solutions has been studied in the Mega rad range.

Through a step-by-step explication of the root concepts of problem, mess, and crisis, a mega-crisis is posited to be a set of interacting crises that are severe in impact, complex in nature, and global in fallout, with no seeming end in sight. Compared to a crisis, a mega-crisis is higher in severity and deeper in complexity. The paper argues for a stakeholder perspective in megacrisis response, as relying on the organizational standpoint is inadequate for reaching long-term resolutions.\n\nThe effects of the MEGA BORG spill on Gulf of Mexico shrimp\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNance, J.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nA brown shrimp stock model was developed at the NMFS Galveston Laboratory to assess the effects of the MEGA BORG oil spill on the brown shrimp population along the Texas coast. Water and sediment samples from near the MEGA BORG spill area were collected and analyzed by the Geochemical and Environmental Research Group at Texas A ampersand M University. Hydrocarbon concentrations found at the sediment collection stations ranged from 1.38 ug/g to 7.42 ug/g, while concentrations at the water column sampling sites ranged from 0.69 ug/l to 27.39 ug/l. Evaluation of chromatograms and analytical data suggested that sediments from the area contained primarily biogenic hydrocarbons. Only one station had elevated hydrocarbon levels. However, these values were only three to five times higher than the concentrations measured at the other stations. Evaluation of the water samples from the area showed only very low concentration levels of hydrocarbons were present in the water column. A bioassay study was conducted by the US Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Research Laboratory in Gulf Breeze, Florida. The main conclusion from the bioassay study was that the concentrations of hydrocarbons measured at the field sites where water samples were taken tended to be three orders of magnitude lower than the hydrocarbon concentrations causing toxic responses in mysid and white shrimp. There were no detected effects of the brown shrimp population along the Texas coast from the MEGA BORG oil spill\n\nOpen FRW universes and self-acceleration from nonlinear massive gravity\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGÃ¼mrÃ¼kÃ§Ã¼oÄlu, A. Emir; Lin, Chunshan; Mukohyama, Shinji\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn the context of a recently proposed nonlinear massive gravity with Lorentz-invariant mass terms, we investigate open Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universes driven by arbitrary matter source. While the flat FRW solutions were recently shown to be absent, the proof does not extend to the open universes. We find three independent branches of solutions to the equations of motion for the StÃ¼ckelberg scalars. One of the branches does not allow any nontrivial FRW cosmologies, as in the previous no-go result. On the other hand, both of the other two branches allow general open FRW universes governed by the Friedmann equation with the matter source, the standard curvature term and an effective cosmological constant Î Â± = c Â± m g 2 . Here, m g is the graviton mass, + and - represent the two branches, and c Â± are constants determined by the two dimensionless parameters of the theory. Since an open FRW universe with a sufficiently small curvature constant can approximate a flat FRW universe but there is no exactly flat FRW solution, the theory exhibits a discontinuity at the flat FRW limit\n\nOn a wave-particle in closed and open isotropic universes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCampos, L. M. B. C.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Klein-Gordon equation satisfied by the wave function in general relativity is solved for the metric of the closed and open universe corresponding to Einstein-De Sitter-Friedmann isotropic cosmological model. The angular dependences are specified by spherical harmonics for the longitude and latitude, and for the hyperlatitude by modified spherical harmonics having as variable circular functions for the closed universe and hyperbolic functions for the open universes. The time dependence of the probabilistic wave function is similar for the closed and open universes and is obtained in the following three cases: (I) constant Hubble parameter, (II) constant decceleration parameter, and (III) uniform matter and energy distribution, which corresponds to the Hubble parameter a linear function of time. Thus six solutions are obtained, namely, the three cases I-III each for closed and open isotropic universes. For each of these six solutions is considered: (i) the existence of singularities in space-time including asymptotic time in the future or past, (ii) the square integrability of the wave function over the full extent of the four-dimensional space-time, and (iii) the existence or otherwise of a positive probability density associated with the wave function.\n\nThe Mega-Terrorism - The Challenge of the Third Millennium\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDaniel AndriÈan\n\n2011-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of this article is to describe the \"new face\" of terrorism in the twenty-first centuryindicating the transition to mass destruction weapons (nuclear terrorism, chemical, biological, toethnic-religious terrorism, the occurrence of massive gray area phenomena of terrorism and how thisphenomenon became a strategic weapon. Mega-terrorism has been existing, at a conceptual level,ever since the 70âs, when the experts of this phenomenon tried to find a semantic cover for thesituations that certain organizations, groups or terrorist or extremist sections would get someWeapons of Mass Destruction Systems. Actually, the 11th of September tragedy proves that megaterrorismrepresents the premeditated destruction, the lack of negotiations, of a tactical goal that wasto be accomplished by means of a threat. The mega-terrorism actors do not intend to get themselvesknown to the public, do not require anything, do not see the threat as means or device to reach theirpurpose. The 21 st century mega-terrorism simple logic is materialized in the systemic destroying ofthe enemy, no longer representing a political power or a government, but an entire âdisobeyingâ,âcorruptedâ, âunfaithfulâ population indifferent to the mega-terrorist actorsâ desires. New dimensionagainst mega-terrorism determines not only a rethinking of how to combat it, but also the realizationof a conceptual legal framework and measures established to materialize the political decision.\n\nHave the âmega-journalsâ reached the limits to growth?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBo-Christer BjÃ¶rk\n\n2015-05-01\n\nFull Text Available A âmega-journalâ is a new type of scientific journal that publishes freely accessible articles, which have been peer reviewed for scientific trustworthiness, but leaves it to the readers to decide which articles are of interest and importance to them. In the wake of the phenomenal success of PLOS ONE, several other publishers have recently started mega-journals. This article presents the evolution of mega-journals since 2010 in terms of article publication rates. The fastest growth seems to have ebbed out at around 35,000 annual articles for the 14 journals combined. Acceptance rates are in the range of 50â70%, and speed of publication is around 3â5 months. Common features in mega-journals are alternative impact metrics, easy reusability of figures and data, post-publication discussions and portable reviews from other journals.\n\nThe MEGA [Muon decays into an Electron and a GAmma ray] hardware trigger system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSzymanski, J.J.; Amann, J.F.; Black, J.K.; Cooper, M.D.; Wright, S.C.; Crocker, J.; Sanders, H.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe MEGA experiment is designed to search for the rare decay Î¼ â e Î³ with a branching ratio sensitivity of /approximately/10 -13 . As is typical of rare-decay experiments, extensive, online filtering of the data is required for MEGA. The MEGA experiment uses a hardware pattern-recognition system based on Programmable Array Logic (PAL) devices. Additional events are eliminated in an online ACP system before data are written to tape. The MEGA trigger system is generally applicable where high-rate, short-propagation-delay trigger systems are required. This report contains an introduction to the MEGA experiment, a discussion of the MEGA hardware trigger system and a discussion of the system's measured performance. 4 refs., 3 figs\n\nEvents and mega events: leisure and business in tourism\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRicardo Alexandre Paiva\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The promotion of events and mega events mobilizes at the same time, in a concatenated way or not, leisure and business practices, which are captured by the tourism industry as a stimulus for the reproduction of capitalism,Â by the amount of other activities which raise (primary, secondary and tertiary , placing the architecture and the city as protagonists in contemporary urban development. In this sense, the article analyzes the articulation of events and mega events to the provision of architecture and urban infrastructure, as well as the construction of the tourist image of the places, motivated by leisure and business activities.

This will be discussed, in a historical perspective, the concepts of leisure and business activities that raise as moving or traveling; next it will be delimited similarities and differences between tourism events and business tourism, entering after the analysis of the distinctions between events and mega events, highlighting the complexity and the role of mega-events as a major symptom of globalization; finally it will be presented the spatial scale developments in architecture and the city in the realization of (mega events, as well as its impact on the city's image. As a synthesis, it is important to notice that spatial developments business tourism, events and mega events are manifested in various scales and with different levels of complexity, revealing the strengths and / or weaknesses of the places. The urban planning, architecture and urbanism are important objects of knowledge and spatial intervention to ensure infrastructure and urban and architectural structures appropriate for events, which should be sensitive to the demands of tourists and host communities.\n\nRip Currents, Mega-Cusps, and Eroding Dunes\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nThornton, E.B.; MacMahan, J.; Sallenger, A.H.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nSubmitted to Marine Geology 1 November 2006 Dune erosion is shown to occur at the embayment of beach mega-cusps O(200m alongshore) that are associated with rip currents. The beach is the narrowest at the embayment of the mega-cusps allowing the swash of large storm waves coincident with high tides to reach the toe of the dune, to undercut the dune and to cause dune erosion.

Combined data included 15 hybrids and 9 test locations common for both years and it was analyzed as balanced experiment. The analysis of variance components showed that hybrid by location interaction explained 2.74, 5.8, and 3.72 times more variation than hybrid, for grain yield, for 2006, 2007, combined data, respectively, and indicated potential mega-environment existence. Our results showed the existence of two mega-environments in Serbia sunflower growing region: (1 Kula Vitovnica, Aleksa Å antiÄ, Sombor and (2 Rimski Å anÄevi, Kikinda. It has been concluded that if we want promising sunflower hybrids to be optimally used, they should be cropped differently for the two determined mega-environments.\n\nMEGA-CC: computing core of molecular evolutionary genetics analysis program for automated and iterative data analysis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKumar, Sudhir; Stecher, Glen; Peterson, Daniel; Tamura, Koichiro\n\n2012-10-15\n\nThere is a growing need in the research community to apply the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) software tool for batch processing a large number of datasets and to integrate it into analysis workflows. Therefore, we now make available the computing core of the MEGA software as a stand-alone executable (MEGA-CC), along with an analysis prototyper (MEGA-Proto). MEGA-CC provides users with access to all the computational analyses available through MEGA's graphical user interface version. This includes methods for multiple sequence alignment, substitution model selection, evolutionary distance estimation, phylogeny inference, substitution rate and pattern estimation, tests of natural selection and ancestral sequence inference. Additionally, we have upgraded the source code for phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood methods for parallel execution on multiple processors and cores. Here, we describe MEGA-CC and outline the steps for using MEGA-CC in tandem with MEGA-Proto for iterative and automated data analysis. http://www.megasoftware.net/.\n\nDevelopment of MicroMegas for a Digital Hadronic Calorimeter\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nAdloff, Catherine; Blaha, Jan; Espargiliere, Ambroise; Karyotakis, Yannis\n\n2009-01-01\n\nRecent developments on the MicroMegas prototypes built by use of the bulk technology with analog and digital readout electronics are presented.

The beach is the narrowest at the embayment of the mega-cusps allowing the swash of large storm waves coincident with high tides to reach the toe of the dune, to undercut the dune and to cause dune erosion. Field measurements of dune, beach, and rip current morphology are acquired along an 18 km shoreline in southern Monterey Bay, California. This section of the bay consists of a sandy shoreline backed by extensive dunes, rising to heights exceeding 40 m. There is a large increase in wave height going from small wave heights in the shadow of a headland, to the center of the bay where convergence of waves owing to refraction over the Monterey Bay submarine canyon results in larger wave heights. The large alongshore gradient in wave height results in a concomitant alongshore gradient in morphodynamic scale. The strongly refracted waves and narrow bay aperture result in near normal wave incidence, resulting in well-developed, persistent rip currents along the entire shoreline. The alongshore variations of the cuspate shoreline are found significantly correlated with the alongshore variations in rip spacing at 95% confidence. The alongshore variations of the volume of dune erosion are found significantly correlated with alongshore variations of the cuspate shoreline at 95% confidence. Therefore, it is concluded the mega-cusps are associated with rip currents and that the location of dune erosion is associated with the embayment of the mega-cusp.\n\nMega Borg oil spill of the Texas coast: An open-water bioremediation test\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOppenheimer, C.H.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nNature has developed hydrocarbons as a part of life. Since the origin of life, more than 60,000 organic molecules have evolved that make up protoplasm; a given percentage of these molecules are hydrocarbons. Commercial hydrocarbon deposits are a by-product of this natural process and a continual source of oil in the aquatic environment through seeps. As a result, nature has also evolved a recycling system for the hydrocarbons. This cycle is the basis for a program of bioremediation using microorganisms. Effort has been made to develop mixed cultures capable of a wide range of hydrocarbon metabolism and co-metabolism. The cultures are economically produced in high concentrations as a dry powder with a shelf life of one year. The result is an economical process for the application of bacteria to hydrocarbon pollutants on water and soils. The process of bioremediation to the recent Mega Borg accident will be discussed\n\nSouth Asia | Page 106 | IDRC - International Development Research ...\n\nInternational Development Research Centre (IDRC) Digital Library (Canada)\n\nFor observers elsewhere in the world, the most striking feature of distance education (DE) in Asia is the mega-universities and mega-schools that have added many millions to the global tally of distance learners in recent decades.

They should be designed for equal use despite disabilities and special recreational needs. Their design must be functional and must meet userâs special requirements, either everyday functional or special (recreational needs. It is not just about overcoming architectural obstacles by building ramps of suitable slope and size; it is about inclusive, universal landscape design of urban space made for all citizens. For this matter, different ways of public use for each group of users is defined, functional criteria are determined, and examples of good and bad design are assembled to present the differences between technically accomplished ramps, and slope paths that include quality landscape inclusive design. To prove the unsuitability of public open spaces in Ljubljana, various analyses were made, including the measurement of steepness, lengths and wideness of certain urban elements. As an application of results, the universal designing principles are summarized in new proposal for entrance into Tivoli Park.\n\nMEGA - A next generation mission in Medium Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKanbach, Gottfried\n\n2001-01-01\n\nA Medium Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy (MEGA) detector is being developed and proposed for a small satellite mission. MEGA intends to improve the sensitivity at medium Î³-ray energies (0.4-50 MeV) by at least an order of magnitude with respect to past instruments. Its large field of view will be especially important for the discovery of transient sources and for conducting all-sky surveys. Key science objectives for MEGA are the investigation of cosmic high-energy accelerators and of nucleosynthesis sites with Î³-ray lines. The large-scale structure of the galactic and cosmic diffuse background is another important goal for this mission. MEGA records and images Î³-ray events by completely tracking Compton and pair creation interactions in a stack of double sided Si-strip track detectors and 3-D resolving CsI calorimeters\n\nSCALES OF FLOWS: Qatar and the Urban Legacies of Mega Events\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnna Grichting\n\n2013-07-01\n\nFull Text Available In 2022, Qatar will become the first Middle Eastern and Arab country to host such an Â important Mega-Event as the FIFA World Cup. Global cultural and sporting Mega Events Â ave driven the urban transformation of cities such as Barcelona, London, Rio, Beijing,Shanghai, and Lisbon and the spectacle and economic boosterism encourages cities to Â compete on the World Stage for these events. The best practices of successful bids and Â their enduring legacies create a knowledge and policy flow of Mega Event strategies for global branding and sustainable Urban, Social, and Economic Development at the local and regional scales. This paper discusses the urban legacies that will result from Qatar hosting the World Cup and other Mega Events, and questions how an emerging global host city like Doha will benefit on the long and short term.\n\nResearchers' perspectives on open access scholarly communication in Tanzanian public universities\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nF.W. Dulle\n\n2009-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This research explored the awareness, usage and perspectives of Tanzanian researchers on open access as a mode of scholarly communication. A survey questionnaire targeted 544 respondents selected through stratified random sampling from a population of 1088 university researchers of the six public universities in Tanzania. With a response rate of 73%, the data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. The study reveals that the majority of the researchers were aware of and were positive towards open access. Findings further indicate that the majority of researchers in Tanzanian public universities used open access outlets more to access scholarly content than to disseminate their own research findings. It seems that most of these researchers would support open access publishing more if issues of recognition, quality and ownership were resolved. Thus many of them supported the idea of establishing institutional repositories at their respective universities as a way of improving the dissemination of local content. The study recommends that public universities and other research institutions in the country should consider establishing institutional repositories, with appropriate quality assurance measures, to improve the dissemination of research output emanating from these institutions.\n\nAssembling university learning technologies for an open world\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHannon, John; Riddle, Matthew; Ryberg, Thomas\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper considers the emergence of social media in university teaching and learning and the capacity or universities as complex organisations with disparate interacting parts to respond to the shift of pedagogies and practices to open networks. Institutional learning technology environments...... reflect a legacy of prescriptive, hierarchical arrangements associated with enterprise systems, and are a poor fit with the heterarchical and self-organised potential for learning associated with social media and open education practices.

J.; Forveille, T.; Delfosse, X.; ReylÃ©, C.; Bertin, E.; Albert, L.; Artigau, E.; Robin, A. C.; Allard, F.; Doyon, R.; Hill, G. J.\n\n2008-06-01\n\nAims: We present the first results of a wide field survey for cool brown dwarfs with the MegaCam camera on the CFHT telescope, the Canada-France Brown Dwarf Survey, hereafter CFBDS. Our objectives are to find ultracool brown dwarfs and to constrain the field-brown dwarf mass function thanks to a larger sample of L and T dwarfs. Methods: We identify candidates in CFHT/MegaCam i' and z' images using optimised psf-fitting within Source Extractor, and follow them up with pointed near-infrared imaging on several telescopes. Results: We have so far analysed over 350 square degrees and found 770 brown dwarf candidates brighter than z'_AB=22.5. We currently have J-band photometry for 220 of these candidates, which confirms 37% as potential L or T dwarfs. Some are among the reddest and farthest brown dwarfs currently known, including an independent identification of the recently published ULAS J003402.77-005206.7 and the discovery of a second brown dwarf later than T8, CFBDS J005910.83-011401.3. Infrared spectra of three T dwarf candidates confirm their nature, and validate the selection process. Conclusions: The completed survey will discover ~100 T dwarfs and ~500 L dwarfs or M dwarfs later than M8, approximately doubling the number of currently known brown dwarfs. The resulting sample will have a very well-defined selection function, and will therefore produce a very clean luminosity function.

Up to now, there are several different opinions about formation problems of lakes and mega dunes. Actually, these problems are directly correlated to the groundwater circulation and alternation in the area. Refering to the prevenient research results and combining with the current hydrogeological investigation in the desert, the paper discussed the problems about the formation mechanisms of lakes and mega dunes. The Primary cognition is that: the lakes in the desert were formed mainly by the lateral recharge of groundwaters both from Yabulai mountain and mega dunes. The formation of the mega dunes was related nearly to the rainfall and groundwater in the area. The formation and coexistence relationship between lakes and mega dunes is that: the mega dunes were formed firstly, and then the lakes. That is to say the mega dunes are the basic conditions for the lake formation.

The simultaneous impacts of \"pure\" mega-ENSO and \"pure\" conventional ENSO events on the ISR in its developing summer remains unclear. This study examines the different linkages between mega-ENSO-ISR and conventional ENSO-ISR. During the developing summer of mega-El NiÃ±o, negative rainfall anomalies are seen over the northeastern Indian subcontinent, while the anomalous rainfall pattern is almost the opposite for mega-La NiÃ±a; as for the conventional ENSO, the approximate \"linear opposite\" phenomenon vanishes. Furthermore, the global zonal wave trains anomalous are found at mid-latitude zones, with a local triple circulation pattern over the central-east Eurasia during mega-ENSO events, which might be an explanation of corresponding rainfall response over the Indian Peninsula. Among 106-year historical run (1900-2005) of 9 state-of-the-art models from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), HadGEM2-ES performs a promising skill in simulating the anomalous circulation pattern over mid-latitude and central-east Eurasia while CanESM2 cannot. Probably, it is the models' ability of capturing the mega-ENSO-ISR linkage and the characteristic of mega-ENSO that make the difference.\n\nMega-Analysis of School Psychology Blueprint for Training and Practice Domains\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBurns, Matthew K.; Kanive, Rebecca; Zaslofsky, Anne F.; Parker, David C.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMeta-analytic research is an effective method for synthesizing existing research and for informing practice and policy.

Various strategies regarding development, prices, costs, new business opportunities, production scenarios, demand and energy policies can be evaluated through this model in order to determine, after analyzing the economics results, a set of strategies to follow in the mid and long term. MEGAS could be also used to make risk analysis studies, considering that probabilistic parameters and variables like gas quality, production, demand, plant shutdowns and others are to be represented by their distinctive function. It is possible to set up a probabilistic function for each economic indicator or operating variables with an appropriate experiment design. MEGAS is based on a dynamic simulation language, which facilitates both the real system components representation and the main variables statistical data accumulation. It also allows graphical representation of results and the simulation animation. Demand and price forecasts, new projects, costs and capabilities of the systems are some of the model input data. MEGAS should be considered as a tool that eases the strategic planning of the business, making it possible for the Corporation to foresee changes, both in the domestic and international market, to predict how these changes could affect its business affairs and to visualize different return scenarios\n\nWorkshop for Open Source Universal Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS)\n\nNational Research Council Canada - National Science Library\n\nTohme, Walid G\n\n2006-01-01\n\n....

In order to review the academic literature about the subject, we used the following keywords: legacies; sports mega-events and its legacies; UEFA European Championship; and their corresponding terms in Spanish and Portuguese. It was also reviewed some important research basis: Annals; BVS; DOAJ; EBSCO; REDALYC; PeriÃ³dicos CAPES; PubMed; Scielo; Scopus; Science Direct; and, Scholar Google. The results were analyzed by categories. Regarding the sport mega-event Eurocopa, it was found that the tourism legacies, the economics impacts and the social aspectÂ have been discussed more often, as well as projections and predictions of events that will occur later. It was also concluded that most of the articles shows an absence of discussion about the negative impacts of sports mega-events. It is therefore recommended to use standard methods with comparisons of results and longitudinal studies to better understand the impacts and the use of legacy.\n\nDesign Principles of Open Innovation Concept â Universal Design Viewpoint\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMustaquim, Moyen; NystrÃ¶m, Tobias\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe concept of open innovation is becoming an increasingly popular topic of interest and seems to promise a lot in organizational development.

We first derive the equations of motion for a cosmic string in an open Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space-time. With these equations and the cosmic string stress-energy conservation law, we construct a quantitative model of the evolution of the gross features of a cosmic string network in a dust-dominated, Î© 2 /Mpc. In a low density universe the string+CDM scenario is a better model for structure formation. We find that for cosmological parameters Î=Î©hâ¼0.1 - 0.2 in an open universe the string+CDM power spectrum fits the shape of the linear power spectrum inferred from various galaxy surveys. For Î©â¼0.2 - 0.4, the model requires a bias b approx-gt 2 in the variance of the mass fluctuation on scales 8h -1 Mpc. In the presence of a cosmological constant, the spatially flat string+CDM power spectrum requires a slightly lower bias than for an open universe of the same matter density. copyright 1997 The American Physical Society\n\nThe Economic Effects of the Mega Sport Events on Tourism in the BRICS Countries Case\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIuliana Pop\n\n2016-11-01\n\nFull Text Available At the beginning of the 21st century, events tourism witnessed an impressive development in a series of countries due to the increase of the spare time and of the peopleâs income, to the cheaper and more diversified world transport, especially the air transport and due to the emergence of new destinations. Emergent countries, such as China and Russia, recorded not only an increase in the number of tourists but also in the revenues from tourism activities. One of the reasons is the opening of these countries frontiers in order to reaffirm their power on international level (Golubchikov, 2016. Besides the relaxation, business and religious tourism, the sport tourism becomes more and more important. It also comprises the tourism for mega sport events, such as the Summer and Winter Olympics or the World Championships in different sports. For the organising countries, there is a real challenge to ensure the investments for the infrastructure, although it supports their economic development, being used after the sport events conclusion. Considering the available data from the World Bank and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO, the authors make a quantitative investigation regarding the impact of the mega sport events on the tourism phenomenon in the BRICS countries. The article also researches a small and specific group of countries (BRICS, considering a niche tourism phenomenon. The article aims to emphasize the role of the mega sport events in the BRICS countries, directly connected with their capacity to economically support the organization of these events and also with the desire to internationally promote their national values.\n\nMega-events in India, Brazil, and South Africa: Lessons for safer cities\n\nInternational Development Research Centre (IDRC) Digital Library (Canada)\n\n2016-12-13\n\nDec 13, 2016 ...

A significant factor influencing this status is the low research output, with the main contributor to this status being minimum access to scholarly content to support research. Stellenbosch University, a leading research institution on the African continent, is committed to contributing to changing this status quo through the distribution of its own research output utilizing open sources. Given the challenges that have plagued Africa in developing processes for the distribution of their research, Stellenbosch University has developed the African Open Access Repository Initiative (AOARI which uses open source software for two platforms that support the âgreenâ and âgoldâ route to sharing scholarly literature: Ubuntu is used as the operating system, DSpace is used for its repository and Open Journal Systems for its publication platform.

Respondents were asked about journal hosting services in their organization as well as their thoughts on internal and external support for open access publishing. Results showed that most of the organizations are hosting OA journals, largely between one and five in number, and many supply journal hosting services, including some technical support. Personnel resources are a notable factor in the ability to host journals. Most respondents engage in some sort of internal support for open access publishing and are open to options that they are presently not utilizing. They are particularly amenable to OA publishing support from outside of their organizations, especially assistance at a consortial level.\n\nMega-events in India, Brazil, and South Africa: Lessons for safer cities\n\nInternational Development Research Centre (IDRC) Digital Library (Canada)\n\n13 dÃ©c. 2016 ...
