I once picked him in a draft winning side. Left arm bowler and right handed bat who was a decent all rounder. I’d never have stumbled across him if I didn’t participate in drafts. He was supposedly one of the first players who used the forward defense.\n\nWas a famously slow scorer (once carried his bat scoring 5 out of 60 iirc), and was mentioned in the poem “At Lord’s” in the line “O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago”.\n\nSurendra Nath\n\nSurendra Nath Profile - Cricket Player India | Stats, Records, Video\n\nRead about Surendra Nath cricket player from India profile, stats, rankings, records, videos, photos at ESPNcricinfo\n\nOne of the many cricketers who did not get their due from the selectors, Surendra Nath was a tireless medium pacer who could swing the ball prodigously. His bowling was ideally suited to English conditions and he was a success on the 1959 tour when he took 79 wickets in first-class games, next only to Subash Gupte's 95. He played in all five Tests, heading the Test averages with 16 wickets (26.62) and taking five wickets in an innings at both Old Trafford and the Oval. He did well at home too. Against Australia in 1959-60 he bowled both the openers McDonald and Favell. Against Pakistan in 1960-61, he was outstanding in the third Test at Calcutta, when he used the conditions very effectively. He picked up 4 for 93 from 46 overs in the first innings. In the next Test at Madras, however, he was less successful and was promptly discarded for good. He certainly deserved better.\n\nSurendra Nath however continued to play in the Ranji Trophy until 1969. He took 178 wickets (20.67) in the national competition. In a first-class career that started in 1955, he took 284 wickets (24.95).\n\nFew guns from early editions of International Cricket Captain never made more than a fleeting impression in real life:\n\nMichael May - Opener who always ended up with England in ICC 98\n\nMatt Bulbeck - World class left arm bowling allrounder from Somerset in the early editions\n\nArshad Khan - Played 7 tests for Pakistan in real life but often became the new Saqlain in ICC\n\nI'm still convinced 90% of my \"random 90's/00's domestic cricketer\" knowledge (other than the Aussies) is linked to ICC somehow, lol.\n\nChris Drum. Kiwi pacer who kept Tendulkar quiet for 3 consecutive overs and then dismissed him in 99 ODI series in IND after Sachin scored 186 in previous ODI.\n\nRetired at the age of just 27 with an extraordinary FC record. I believe he retired because he thought he would make more money doing other things - not even really a case that he had a particularly lucrative career lined up, just that it would probably be better than being a test cricketer for NZ, which is pretty telling.\n\nRetired at the age of just 27 with an extraordinary FC record.

And the ushering in of the International contracted players squad.\n\nBut, still about 5 or so years before domestic contracts.\n\nRetired at the age of just 27 with an extraordinary FC record. I believe he retired because he thought he would make more money doing other things - not even really a case that he had a particularly lucrative career lined up, just that it would probably be better than being a test cricketer for NZ, which is pretty telling.\n\nHe became a cop/detective, did he not?\n\nAndrew Mathieson would be my answer to this. Played for NZ in 2015, dismissed Jason Roy with his first ball in international cricket, got humped for 40 off 4 or so (ODI) and I'm not even sure he played much even FC cricket after that.\n\nIIRC the selection of Mathieson was a bit of a throwback to a bygone era in that it was the arse end of the series and NZ had some injury woes, so for reinforcement they have to pluck whoever they could find out of local club cricket and into the team\n\nPretty much a modern day Tony Pigott in effect"
