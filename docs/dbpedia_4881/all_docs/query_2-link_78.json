        "text": "Riverside Cricket Club play in the NTCA Grade Cricket Association which is the 2nd highest level of Cricket in Tasmania, nicknamed the Blues, Riverside has a rich history having been founded in 1948.\n\nThe club has 4 senior men’s NTCA A-Grade Premierships to its name, the last being back in the 1980/81 season where Riverside was the first club to win all three grade titles in Tasmanian cricket history.\n\nPlaying their home games out of the Windsor Park precinct, the club has various teams participating in juniors, women’s and senior men’s grade cricket. In recent times, Riverside has won a variety of limited overs cricket tournaments, including the State 20/20 premiership in 2015/16 season, however the prestigious NTCA A-grade Premiership has eluded the club over the past 4 decades.\n\n‘In recent history we’ve had success in 20/20 and the 50 over format, but the one that has evaded us is the NTCA premiership in the longer format,’ said Senior Coach Patrick Mackrell.\n\nThe club currently sits 2nd on the NTCA A-Grade ladder and was in a strong position to take first innings points against fellow finals contenders and benchmark club Westbury when this was submitted to press. ‘Westbury have probably been the best team in the competition over the last 10 years, we’ve got to perform well to take this one out.’ Said Patrick.\n\nThe club has had some very notable players over the years, former New Zealand International Richard Hadlee had a spell at the club while former Tasmanian Shield players Steve Howard and the late Tony Benneworth both featured prominently during the late 1970’s-early 1980’s as did Riverside legend and all-time games record holder, former wicketkeeper/batsman Tony Walters during an era that saw Riverside dominate the competition with 3 A-grade premierships.\n\n‘Our greatest era was the 70’s and early 80’s and at that point the NTCA was the strongest competition in the State.’ Said Patrick.\n\n‘Although we haven’t quite got over the line for that elusive flag in recent times, over the last 5 years the club is progressing well. We’ve played off in a few grand finals and got very close.’ Patrick added.\n\nThe club has an excellent record of producing outstanding cricketing talent, current Tasmanian Tigers and Hobart Hurricanes WBBL batter Emma Manix-Geeves came through the ranks at Riverside and she has gone on to become one of the best young female players in Australia, winning Cricket Tasmania’s prestigious Female young player of the year for season 2021/22, while current State u17’s captain Aidan O’Connor and State u19’s captain Cooper Anthes have both come through the ranks and continue to play their club cricket at Riverside C.C.\n\nTwo current Riverside players play for the Greater Northern Raiders in the TCA competition, which sits just below Sheffield Shield level on the national curriculum.\n\nThe club has a very healthy social scene, some great sponsors and is in great shape…pushing hard to break that 40 plus year drought since winning an NTCA Premiership. Not that winning such a trophy is the only metric used to measure sporting success, but it would be nice to finally get that Cup back to Windsor Park!\n\nCoach Patrick Mackrell said. ‘This year we’re in a good position and we’re heading in the right direction, we’ve got some very talented younger players and a good mix of young and older players that are dedicated to put ourselves in the best position possible to take the NTCA, but it’s a hard one to win!’\n\n‘The competition is very even, any team can win it on their day, so we’ve just got to be switched on and focused to make every moment count and continue to push hard in each game we play.’\n\nGood luck to Patrick and Riverside Cricket Club for the remainder of season 2022/23 and beyond."
