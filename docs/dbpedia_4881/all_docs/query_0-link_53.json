        "text": "Hard and soft borders have been very much part of daily political discourse in recent times. In every sector of public life speculation has been rife as to what might be the likely effects of the UK's withdrawal from the EU and TE has been drawn into that debate as part of that debate. However, it is not the current debate with which I want to begin my remarks about the book Linda Clarke, Teresa O'Doherty and myself have written about teacher preparation in NI, and which will appear on bookshop shelves in the autumn. Rather I want to begin with the effects the turbulent period surrounding another withdrawal almost a hundred years ago had on teacher education here in NI, and then to highlight how we have managed since. A hundred years ago it was the withdrawal of twenty-six of Ireland's thirty two counties from the UK to form the IFS in 1921, and the establishment of a devolved government in the remaining six counties, that I will discuss. Then, teacher education featured in a small, but not insignificant manner, in building what became our very own hard border within and between Ireland's two jurisdictions. I want to refer to that contribution as the first part of my answer to the question of 'how did we get to where we are'. In February 1922 the recently established Ministry of Education for NI assumed responsibility for education from the two Dublin based bodies which had hitherto exercised overall government responsibility for the sector, the Commissioners for National Education, and the Commissioners for Intermediate Education. The former had responsibility for the funding, for the curricula and for the general supervision of national/elementary schools as well as of the country's six teacher training colleges. The majority of schools were conducted under religious auspices of one kind or the other-mainly the local churches, a common situation across other parts of the UK as well. Likewise in the case of the colleges, five of which were conducted under religious auspices, while the sixth was under the commissioners own auspices. The same commissioners were also responsible for the management of over twenty model schools which had been established alongside the elementary school system in the 1830s. Model schools which were essentially super elementary schools were established to provide a form of initial teacher preparation on a master-apprentice basis for pupils who had been identified as potential teachers. These pupils, described as either pupil teachers, or monitors, taught classes under the supervision of school principals. At second level, where the number of schools was much fewer, there was another commission controlled by the Commissioners for Intermediate Education. It's main responsibility was to conduct examinations, on the results of which schools were awarded funding. But these commissioners had no role in the preparation of second level teachers and it was only towards the close of the 1800s that teacher preparation courses began to be provided. Indeed here in the North courses only commenced at QUB in 1914. However, since subject mastery was valued above teaching skills at secondary level, such courses were not compulsory. For specialist subject teachers, notably in art, music and domestic science, courses of a kind were provided at Belfast's technical college, again not compulsory. Even before it had officially assumed its responsibilities for the sector NI's Ministry of Education had set about planning significant reform, particularly with respect to the governance and funding of elementary schools. In 1921 the ministry had established what became known as the Lynn Committee to advise on future structures within the education sector. Separately, the government was faced with an immediate problem as far as teacher preparation was concerned. That was the absence of any provision for the preparation of male teachers, Catholic or Protestant, or for female Protestant teachers since the only training college in NI was St Mary's, an exclusively female and Catholic institution."
