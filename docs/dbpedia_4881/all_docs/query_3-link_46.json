        "text": "Research Interests\n\nMy central research interest is the geographical political economy of local, regional and urban development, governance and policy.\n\nThis core provides the basis for two main strands of work. First, this research is concerned with the concepts and theory of the meaning and governance of development regionally and locally in an international context. In particular, this work seeks to question and broaden our understandings of ‘development’ beyond the economic to encompass the social and ecological in more sustainable and progressive ways and to begin more meaningfully to connect development locally and regionally in the global North and South.\n\nSecond, this research focuses upon the intersections between local, regional and urban development and Economic Geography. This theme has been explored recently in work on: economic evolution, structural change and adaptation in British cities (ESRC); financialisation, the local state and infrastructure (EPSRC and ESRC); manufacturing renaissance in industrial regions and local industrial policy (ESRC); and, 'left behind places' and understanding demographic and socio-economic change in peripheral regions in France, Germany and the UK (ESRC ORA).\n\nMy research builds upon close policy and institutional engagement and has informed local, regional and urban development, governance and policy for international (e.g. European Commission, United Nations International-Labour Organisation (UN-ILO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), national (e.g. Government Departments – Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; Housing Communities and Local Government, National Audit Office, devolved administrations, Joseph Rowntree Foundation), regional (e.g. Local Enterprise Partnerships, Regional Development Agencies, trade unions, voluntary organisations) and local (e.g. Local Authorities, Development Agencies) institutions.\n\nRecent Work\n\nMy recent work was focused on 3 areas of activity:\n\n1.Financialisation, the local state and infrastructure\n\nWe published a book – Financialising City Statecraft and Infrastructure (2019, Elgar) – written by Andy Pike, Peter O’Brien, Tom Strickland, Graham Thrower and John Tomaney. Financialising City Statecraft and Infrastructure addresses the struggles of national and local states to fund, finance and govern urban infrastructure. It develops fresh thinking on financialisation and city statecraft to explain the socially and spatially uneven mixing of managerial, entrepreneurial and financialised city governance in austerity and limited decentralisation across England. As urban infrastructure fixes for the London global city-region risk undermining national ‘rebalancing’ efforts in the UK, city statecraft in the rest of the country is having uneasily to combine speculation, risk-taking and prospective venturing with co-ordination, planning and regulation. See https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/financialising-city-statecraft-and-infrastructure. The book was based upon work funded through the inter-disciplinary research centre i-BUILD (Infrastructure BUsiness models, valuation and Innovation for Local Delivery) involving the Universities of Birmingham and Leeds and funded by EPSRC and ESRC began in 2013. See: http://research.ncl.ac.uk/ibuild/.\n\n2. Economic evolution, structural change and adaptation in British cities\n\nOver the past few years, cities and city-regions have assumed growing prominence in discussions over economic growth and performance. Both geographers and economists point to the increasing concentration of economic activity and wealth creation in cities, and their crucial importance as the loci of national prosperity. National governments and international bodies have likewise recognised the key economic role that cities play, and have correspondingly directed attention to cities as the foci of policy intervention and governance reform. In the UK, interest in the economic performance of cities takes on particular importance given the Government's concern spatially to rebalance the economy between the less prosperous North and the more prosperous South. 'Powering up' northern cities to unlock their growth potential is seen as crucial to securing that political imperative. This project is intended to help inform these concerns and debates by focusing on how far and in what ways, over the medium to long term, cities have differed in their ability to reorientate and transform their economic structures in response to or anticipation of changes in demand, competition, trade, and technology, and how those differences have then influenced the comparative growth paths of cities. How far these divergent growth evolutions have been influenced by differences in structural transformation and reorientation was the basic focus of this research. Most of the analysis focused on the past forty years, since 1971, a period when, nationally, a major shift in the national economy has occurred from manufacturing to services. How the structural details of this shift have played out across Britain's cities, and with what consequences for city growth patterns, are key questions the research addressed. The project is led by Ron Martin (Cambridge University) and is funded by the ESRC Urban Transformations programme. See: https://www.cityevolutions.org.uk/\n\n3. The governance of uneven development\n\nThis ongoing research focuses on the governance of uneven development. This work specifically examines the governance of economic development in England and has recently explored the shift away from regions, regionalisation and regionalism toward rebalancing, decentralisation and localism under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition and now Conservative government in the UK. This research includes studies of the demise of the RDAs, the emergence of the LEPs and the Combined Authorities and metro-mayors in England. Future areas of work aim to focus on the austerity state and decentralisation and the impacts of Brexit. It has been undertaken in collaboration with David Marlow (Third Life Economics and CURDS), Anja McCarthy (CURDS), Peter O’Brien (CURDS) and John Tomaney (UCL). This work was part of my involvement in the Spatial Economics Research Centre (SERC) funded by ESRC, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (DBIS), and the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG). See www.spatialeconomics.ac.uk.\n\nCurrent Research\n\n1. Beyond 'left behind places': understanding demographic and socio-economic change in peripheral regions in France, Germany and the UK\n\nThe aim of the project is to develop a new understanding of socio-economic and demographic change in peripheral regions, going beyond the problematic label of ‘left behind’ places through in-depth investigation of their predicaments and prospects. Adopting a cross-national comparative approach, this aim translates into four objectives: i) To understand the distinctive circumstances and development pathways of peripheral regions, overcoming the tendency to subsume different kinds of places beneath the broad category of ‘left behind’; ii) To assess the relationships between the demographic dynamics of peripheral regions and people’s socio-economic, health and political outcomes, covering both population mobility and immobility to redress the existing research bias towards interregional mobility; iii) To examine the livelihood activities and practices of residents in peripheral regions, remedying the neglect of how ‘ordinary’ people deal with peripherality; iv) To identify new policy responses that combine conventional and alternative perspectives, addressing the limitations of prevailing city-centric approaches to regional inequality based upon agglomeration and positive spill-overs from larger cities. In summary, the project will move beyond the label of ‘left behind’ places to advance a more sophisticated cross-national understanding of the development pathways and prospects of peripheral regions. Adapting a process-oriented, context sensitive approach, the research will give agency and voice to people in peripheral regions and support the development of regionally-tailored policy responses. This project is led by Danny MacKinnon and funded by Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR; France), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; Germany), the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC; UK) as part of the Open Research Area (ORA) for the Social Sciences scheme. The project consortium includes partners in the United Kingdom (Newcastle University and University College London), France (Universities of Strasbourg and Montpellier) and Germany (Leibniz institute for Regional Geography, Leipzig).\n\n2. Manufacturing renaissance in industrial regions and the potential of advanced manufacturing for sectoral and spatial rebalancing\n\nThe deep recession from 2008, and the persistent sectoral and spatial imbalances in the recovery, have provoked a political call for ‘rebalancing’ the economy. It is argued that rebuilding the country’s manufacturing base will not only help provide a more stable mode of economic growth, but promote a more even geographical distribution of growth. Strengthening manufacturing in the Midlands and North is integral to sectoral and spatial rebalancing. However, despite its centrality to aspirations for national and regional economic renewal and rebalancing, and the profound uncertainties surrounding manufacturing after the Brexit vote, there has been a lack of recent research into the evolution of manufacturing across Britain. Focusing on the advanced manufacturing industries seen as key to any industrial renewal, this proposal seeks to explain the determinants and geographies of their differential economic performance. It examines whether and how ‘traditional’ industrial regions provide a conducive context for their growth, and whether there are significant local, regional and urban dimensions to the causes of advanced manufacturing development. This project is examining the geographical, organisational and economic dynamics of four key manufacturing industries: electrical, computing and optical equipment; aerospace; pharmaceuticals; and motor vehicles. The project is led by Peter Sunley (Southampton) and is funded by the ESRC http://www.manufacturing-regions.org.uk/\n\n3. Financialisation and the local state\n\nScrutinising accounts of risky and speculative activities, this project on ‘Financialisation and Local Statecraft in England: Councillors at the Casino?’ is developing a new theory of local statecraft to explain the differentiated financialisation of local government and its implications for local financial sustainability, development, wellbeing, and politics. Focusing on England as a public sector reform laboratory amidst austerity since 2010, it is examining how financialising is unevenly rewiring and rescaling the objectives, incentives and accountabilities of local statecraft and relocating risks and uncertainties onto local government and the local state.\n\n4. 'Inclusive growth’ and ‘inclusive economies’ in cities\n\nThis research aims to explore the emergence of ‘inclusive growth’ and ‘inclusive economies’ and their utilisation and adaptation and urban development and policy.
