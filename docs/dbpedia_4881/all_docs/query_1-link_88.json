The spatial concentration of innovation activities in the US and in Canada has created a âgeography of innovationâ. Technological, but also social, artistic and cultural innovations can have repercussions on urban space. What is called innovation may be hard to define but its symptoms are usually found in big urban centers and allow certain regions to stand out. This paper proposes to study three important aspects of the effects of economic innovation on urban space: firstly, urban decline and reinvestment processes linked to the gentrification of inner-cities; secondly, the role played by new social classes arising from the transformation of the economy; and lastly, the concept of metropolisation related to the concentration of tertiary activities.\n\nThe Future of the Space Age or how to Evaluate Innovative Ideas\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVollerthun, A.; Fricke, E.\n\n2002-05-01\n\nBased on an initiative of the German Aerospace Industry Association to foster a more transparent and structured funding of German commercial-oriented space projects a three-phased approach is suggested in this paper, to stepwise improve and evaluate proposed concepts for space-related innovations. The objective of this concept was to develop a transparent, structured, and reproducible process to select the right innovative project in terms of political, economical, and technical objectives for funding by e.g. a governmental agency. A stepwise process and related methods, that cover technical as well as economical aspects (and related sensitivities) are proposed. Based on the special needs and requirements of space industry the proposals are compared to a set of predefined top level objectives/requirements. Using an initial trades analysis with the criteria company, technology, product, and market, an initial business case is analyzed. The alternative innovative concepts are in the third process step subject to a very detailed analysis. The full economical and technical scale of the projects is evaluated and metrics for e.g. the 'Return on Investment' or 'Break Even Point' are determined, to compare the various innovations. Risks related to time, cost, and quality are considered, when performing sensitivity analysis by varying the most important factors of the project. Before discussing critical aspects of the proposed process, space-related examples will be presented to show how the process could be applied, and how different concepts should be evaluated.\n\nSocio-economic research for innovative energy technologies\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nOgawa, Yuichi [Tokyo Univ., High Temperature Plasma Center, Kashiwa, Chiba (Japan); Okano, Kunihiko [Central Research Inst. of Electric Power Industry, Tokyo (Japan)\n\n2006-10-15\n\nIn the 21st century global environment and energy issues become very important, and this is characterized by the long-term (in the scale of a few tens years) and world-wide issue. In addition, future prospect of these issues might be quite uncertain, and scientific prediction could be very difficult. For these issues vigorous researches and various efforts have been carried out from various aspects; e.g., world-wide discussion such as COP3 in Kyoto, promotion of the energy-saving technology and so on. Development of environment-friendly energy has been promoted, and new innovative technologies are explored. Nuclear fusion is, of course, a promising candidate. While, there might be some criticism for nuclear fusion from the socio-economic aspect; e.g., it would take long time and huge cost for the fusion reactor development. In addition, other innovative energy technologies might have their own criticism, as well. Therefore, socio-economic research might be indispensable for future energy resources. At first we have selected six items as for the characteristics, which might be important for future energy resources; i.e., energy resource, environmental load, economics, reliability/stability, flexibility on operation and safety/security. Concerning to innovative energy technologies, we have nominated seven candidates; i.e., advanced coal technology with CO2 recovery system, SOFC top combined cycle, solar power, wind power, space solar power station, advanced fission and fusion. Based on questionnaires for ordinary people and fusion scientists, we have tried to assess the fusion energy development, comparing with other innovative energy technologies.

The geostrategic dimension of economic spaces includes spatial redefinitions as a result of new global strategies of the major transnational corporations. This is, therefore, of a space-time configuration of scenarios in the articulation between the importance of the place, action site, and expression of power. Territorial administration adopts new outlines, sharing and is linked to the logistics of market interests. In the new configuration of interests of global economics, the spatial barriers are set aside and global places are created, representing fragmentations of territorialized space. Territorialization of global productive spaces represents deterritorialization of national spaces. Forms of power and influence of power radiate from them in all directions. Power and administration of territory in the large complex economic and political organisms â regional blocks â confront each memberâs historic reality, the inequalities of the rates of development, culture and social levels. These realities are hard to harmonize and eventually categorize hegemonic centers of power and a national fringe of dependence. Global geostrategy, therefore, takes over, redefines and reorders productive circulation spaces, establishing new relations of power and administration of territories. Historically, Latin America continued to depend heavily on the economic order established by the colonizing countries and this dependence gradually shifted to the world financial supremacies. This dependence intensified the indebtedness process that today characterizes the so-called market of foreign debts, with significant reflections on the internal social order.\n\nInnovation, resources and economic growth\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCurzio, A.Q.; Fortis, M.; Zoboli, R.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe book is concerned with the following items: 1.

The question is how to sustain an innovative environment, in order to generate creative ideas for the market. The authors debate two solutions, namely marketing and fiscal policy, but we have to underline that there are other instruments available to induce innovativeness. This paper submits to the attention, the innovation as being one of the main forces which supports economic development and economic recovery. Governments which sustain enterprisesâ innovation of products and process will have many chances to transform economies into developed and prosperous ones. But innovation by itself does not bring always success, and that is why marketers, economists and innovators must cooperate for favourable outcomes to occur.\n\nDevelopment of Innovative Component for the Regionâs Economic Security\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIrina Markovna Golova\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This article studies the development of innovative component for the regionâs economic security. The hypothesis of the study is that in the context of globalization and development of network society, innovation is becoming one of the key elements ensuring the economic security of a region. We considered the relationship between the concepts of sustainable development and economic security. The authors show that currently, the economic security of the country directly depends on its place within the innovation chain. We substantiate that Russian Federation and its regions need to shift to the innovation development based on strengthening its own sources for long-term growth. The paper considers the basic theoretical and methodological problems in the formation of innovation component of the Russian regionsâ economic security. We reveal the major essence and elements of the innovative component of the sustainable economic development of the region. The authors show that the formation of the innovative component of the regionâs economic security demands the correlation of the strategy of regional innovation development and the production and technological type of territory. Additionally, this strategy should correlate with the desirable ways of production type transformation in the future, considering the trends of the world economy. We have highlighted the production and technological types of Russian regions as well as identified the features of relevant regional components for the innovation system of the Russian Federation to ensure sustainable development. The study defines the priority directions and goals for the development of economic security innovative component in the Russian regions. The authorsâ calculations allowed to select a group of territorial subjects of the Russian Federation, which appear to be the most promising for the development of innovative activities for the elaboration of export-oriented high-tech industries\n\nEconomic Constitution, social democracy, innovation and economic culture of Basque Cooperativism\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSantiago Larrazabal BasaÃ±ez\n\n2009-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In the study of Constitutional Law, the author calls for more attention to be paid to the part in which almost all Constitutions set down economic models, the guiding principles of social and economic policy and economic and social rights.

Thus, the definition of this phenomenon - in all that it captures in it - suggests dynamism and ease of communication. The complexity of the phenomenon of innovation is the creative capacity, around which there revolve all other matters concerning innovation. The present paper also illustrates the relationship between technology and economy, meaning that technical progress makes the economic system that created it. This, in turn, provides a more consistent support for changing technology. Economic factors play a major role in the development of technology, because they are interested in reducing costs, increasing productivity, sales volume, as well as goals that can be achieved through innovation. Successful entrepreneurs in an increasingly more competitive environment try to assert through value creation rewardingly new and different outputs, a fact which represents a change from what was known at the beginning of the business. In general, innovation and to the same extent technical and technological innovation has always accompanied the development of human society. Innovation has manifesting itself throughout history with different levels of intensity. Technical-scientific revolution, present in all spheres of human activity through the accelerated mutations that produce them, fundamentally influence the way in which orientation and innovation evolve.\n\nSharing Space as Social Innovation Re-embedding Social Values into Public Space\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nFigueroa, Maria J.\n\nenvironmental problems in cities.

I. Ovchinnikova\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The basis for innovative development of the agroindustrial complex is the goals, principles and methods that determine the economic security of the region. The category of âeconomic securityâis often identified with the sustainability, competitiveness and risk-free economy of agricultural and processing enterprises. Ensuring the economically safe functioning of all industries and spheres of regional agribusiness is impossible without interconnection with science and education. The most important principles necessary for the formation in the regional and national agribusinesses of a developed economically secure market of scientific, technical and innovative products for agroindustrial purposes are the following: providing the scientific and research sphere of the agro-industrial complex with highly qualified personnel; ensuring real freedom and independence in the activities of research institutions; the formation of a common interdependent economic space and interest; organization of specialized market structures in the field of research and innovation development; development and application within the regional agro-industrial complex of a scientifically grounded economic mechanism for regulating the functioning and stimulating the development of the market for scientific and technical innovation products. Purposeful development of the civilized market of scientific, technical and innovative products of agro-industrial design with its corresponding structures and organizational-economic mechanism is an objective necessity of functioning of economic security of the national economy. The interests of the economic and food security of the region and the state as a whole need to increase the financing of the agricultural sector and the processing industry to a level that will overcome the investment and innovation crisis caused by sanctions. To this end, we believe it is necessary to finance the innovative investment agrarian fund at the\n\nSmart space technology innovations\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nChen, Mu-Yen\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRecently, ad hoc and wireless communication technologies have made available the device, service and information rich environment for users.

Ensuring development of Russia as social and economic system, demands wide use of technical, organizational and administrative, and social innovations that canât be reached without distribution of innovative consciousness. The consciousness determines character of decisions on an exit from a crisis situation, in particular by overcoming âa raw damnationâ. Innovative consciousness allows to identify challenges adequately and to realize effective system of actions on the basis of the systematized threats. In these circumstances the consciousness becomes economic factor, one of the most important drivers of growth. Using the system and systemic-functional analysis, as well as the theory of crisis management, the author reveals a role of innovative consciousness in overcoming crisis situations, and also the factors defining formation of innovative consciousness in Russia. In this article the model according to which any consciousness, including innovative, is defined by cumulative influence of ideology, outlook, the social and economic stimulation given to the system corresponding to national model of management is offered. It is shown that in Russia, distribution of innovative consciousness as dominating for the persons making the decision can be reached at correction of the most mobile factors forming consciousness, ideologies, and socio-economic stimulation. Results of the work are intended for federal and regional authorities of Russia, managing directors of innovation development of economics.\n\nTHE PRACTICE OF EVALUATING THE ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF THE INNOVATIVE PROJECT\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nI. A.

It is therefore important now gets to determine the effectiveness of research and development activities, improving the measurement methods of economic evaluation of innovative projects and innovation. For informed decision-making requires a deep study and objective assessment of the real situation. This is due to changes in economic relations between the producers and consumers of scientific and technical products. Earlier in this activity involved only state scientific institution and the enterprise, then now they are gradually joining financial institutions, commercial and non-profit organizations. The adoption of innovative solutions should be preceded by thorough and comprehensive analysis of the economic feasibility of the innovative project. In this paper we propose to consider how business is costing innovative projects and determine their effectiveness for the enterprise business hotel.\n\nWorkplace Innovations as Reflected in the Romanian Economic Press\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCristina Leovaridis\n\n2015-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Workplace innovations are designed to optimize production processes in firms and improve employeesâ working conditions; few researches on this topic have shown that workplace innovations increased employeesâ job satisfaction, as well as a sense of responsibility and autonomy, but also employeesâ overall well-being, especially regarding to workâlife balance and health.

Danilkova\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article addresses the problems of the conceptual apparatus of innovation as an economic category, the basic aspects of the innovation activities of the organization, conducted a historical analysis of the evolution of the concept of âinnovationâ. Previously, it was customary to assume that the process is driven by innovative organizations that develop and offer innovations, today; society has come to the realization of the consumer â the driving force of innovation development. All the analyzed theory can be combined approach to âinnovationâ consideration in terms of business benefits. The authors of the twentieth millennium write about innovation because of constant movement and change of the market economy, which leads to the speedy preparation of pre â businessman benefits by satisfying needs. Based on the foregoing, we believe that it is necessary to distinguish the concept of âinventionâ and âinnovationâ. Under the invention, we mean a new technical solution. An innovation is the initiation of the idea of innovation as a way out of intellectual activity, i.Â e., a new product, a new method, a new solution. By innovation author implies innovation, ie an invention or innovation after the commercialization process, demanded and implemented - introduction to the market, has successfully sold and which brought a profit. Treat innovation as the development process is not entirely correct, because not every development is innovation, development or process cannot be measured qualitatively, and it is impossible to talk about innovation as a result of the process will not be launched on the market and consumer demand there as the final result of the innovative activity of the enterprise. Because such an interpretation does not meet the scientific and practical needs of economic systems, the resolution of the identified contradictions, perhaps for the demarcation of the terms âinnovationâ and âinnovation processâ\n\nInnovations as a Factor for Ensuring Economic Safety\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaxim SANDU\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available In modern conditions of development of the competitive environment, one of the main ways to solve economic, social and environmental problems is to use the latest achievements of science and technology. Each enterprise seeks to ensure that economic growth is intense, i.e. to be a consequence of the application of more sophisticated factors of production and technology. The prerequisite for intensive growth is the use of innovative strategy in the practical activities of enterprises. The end result of innovations is the materialization and industrial development of innovation, the idea of which can be the scientific and technical activity, and marketing research to identify unmet needs. The innovations are an effective defensive reaction of the firm to the emerging threats of losing market place, constant pressure from competitors, the challenge of new technologies, shortening the life of products, legislative restrictions and changing the market situation. In the offensive version, the innovation is a mean of exploiting new opportunities to preserve or gain a competitive advantage. In the long term aspect, the company has no choice but to pursue an innovation policy, which is the only source of lasting success. The main objective of researching the innovation activity of any organization is to ensure competitiveness in market conditions in order to identify risk factors and ways to overcome them.\n\nProblem framing in new innovation spaces\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nLema, Rasmus\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper is concerned with the global distribution of innovation activity. It uses the case of the software industry to show that there is considerable scope for innovation as an incremental extension of routine outsourcing low-cost countries. To show this, the paper develops a new vocabulary...... for the analysis of innovation outsourcing in global value chains. It then draws on qualitative case study research focused on outsourcing from firms in OECD countries to firms in Bangalore, India. Some buyers are willing to farm out âadvancedâ activities to firms of the new innovation spaces. But such advanced...... to developing countries fails to recognize that innovation tasks, even advanced ones, are becoming increasingly mobile. It also explains why innovative software activities including problem framing activities are likely to follow the relocation of routine âsoftware productionâ activities to the new innovation...\n\nPublic choice economics and space policy: realising space tourism\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCollins, Patrick\n\n2001-03-01\n\nGovernment space agencies have the statutory responsibility to suport the commercialisation of space activities. NASA's 1998 report \"General Public Space Travel and Tourism\" concluded that passenger space travel can start using already existing technology, and is likely to grow into the largest commercial activity in space: it is therefore greatly in taxpayers' economic interest that passenger space travel and accommodation industries should be developed. However, space agencies are doing nothing to help realise this â indeed, they are actively delaying it. This behaviour is predicted by 'public choice' economics, pioneered by Professors George Stigler and James Buchanan who received the 1982 and 1986 Nobel prizes for Economics, which views government organisations as primarily self-interested. The paper uses this viewpoint to discuss public and private roles in the coming development of a space tourism industry.\n\nBasic Properties and Problem Fields of Scientific-Innovation Space of the Region\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlexey Aleksandrovich Rumyantsev\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Increasing scale of the scientific-innovative activity in administrative-territorial units, complicating structure of the regional scientific-innovative complexes and development of inter-regional horizontal and vertical ties expand the space of the scientific and innovation activity research of which primarily involves the development of theoretical and methodological provisions.

O. Zhitinskaya\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article provides a selection of methods for determining the feasibility of an investment-innovative project. Estimated indicators are identified analytically, on their basis a conclusion is made about the economic efficiency and feasibility of the project, which is the basis of its competitiveness. Such growth analytics is necessary, since the social and economic development of the country and the region largely depends on the investment climate, which is facilitated by the legislation of the Russian Federation (the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, the law of the Russian Federation on the regulation of investment activities, etc.. Since competitiveness is also determined by the economic feasibility and financial solvency of innovative projects, modern information and software, as well as the methodology for project appraisal and the corresponding order of their implementation, are needed. In the Russian Federation, a method is used to assess the efficiency of capital investments in capitalist countries, as well as the methodology of economic (competitive analysis of investment-innovative projects. The basis of the method is that reimbursement of investments occurs in two economic forms: net profit and depreciation (net income. Of the numerous methods for assessing the feasibility of investment, the most often used along with discount methods (taking into account the factor of money changes over time, statistical methods with determining the payback period and the average rate of return on investment. Defined indicators: the net present value (NPV and the internal rate of return (IRR. The methodology specified in the article is useful to the investor in order to rationalize investment flows, helps to achieve the maximum IRR. The implementation of the innovative project serves the competitiveness of the manufacturing enterprise by increasing the technical and technological levels of the products.\n\nRegional technical innovation suitability and economic growth in China\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nZhou, Qing; Zhu, Dan; Brouwers-Ren, Liqin\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis paper aims to use quantitative method to analyse the suitability of regional technical innovation and further compare its influence to regional economic growth in China.

The economic growth and competitiveness of developing economies are powerfully connected to its innovation status. The purpose of this paper is to examine the significance of innovation in driving economic growth per capita and competitiveness in selected developing economies. In order to determine the interconnection among the variables of innovation, competitiveness, and growth, assorted methodological measurement instruments have been applied. The data were collected from both primary and secondary sources. The results suggest the importance of specific innovation dimensions for prospective economic growth in developing economies. The identical measures responsible for fragile innovation are associated to the low composite measures of innovation accomplishment. This demonstrates the enormous disparity concentrated in every innovation aspect over time, specifically in innovation output and enterprise performances between the developing economies and the EU-28 average measures. The research results indicate the usage of appropriate economic instruments in diminishing the problems that developing economies are currently dealing with.\n\nEco-innovation Dynamics and Green Economic Change: the role of sectoral-specific patterns\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nAndersen, Maj Munch; Faria, Lourenco\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper investigates the features of Green Economic Change process at the meso-level, the greening of industries.

It draws on the sociology of space in exploring the social practices, institutional forces and material complexity of how people and spaces interact. We assess how space influences the development of innovative solutions to challenges in the health sector. Our aim is to advance an understanding of the social production of space for healthcare innovation. We draw empirical examples from the Innovation Hub at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town to illustrate that innovation does not take place in an institutional vacuum, but requires space that facilitates interaction of different players. This paper demonstrates that space matters in promoting innovation, particularly through its influence on social relationships and networks. An attractive and novel space, which is different from the usual workplace, stimulates innovation, mainly through being a base for the creation of an ecosystem for the productive interaction of different players. The interaction is important in inspiring new ideas, facilitating creative thought processes, maintaining the flow of information and bringing innovation to life. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In an environment of accelerating technological change, a methodological approach to addressing non-core technology trends and potentially disruptive, game-changing developments not yet linked to the space sector is increasingly important to complement efforts in core technology R&D planning. Various models and organisational setups aimed at fulfilling this purpose are in existence. These include, with varying levels of relevance to space, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC, operational form 1998 to 2007 and recently re-established), the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Department of Defence, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Medialab, the early versions of Starlab, the Lockheed Skunk Works and the European Space Agency's Advanced Concepts Team. Some of these organisations have been reviewed and assessed individually, though systematic comparison of their methods, approaches and results have not been published. This may be due in part to the relatively sparse scientific literature on organisational parameters for enabling disruptive innovation as well as to the lack of commonly agreed indicators for the evaluation of their performance. Furthermore, innovation support systems in the space sector are organised differently than in traditional, open competitive markets, which serve as the basis for most scholarly literature on the organisation of innovation. The present paper is intended to advance and stimulate discussion on the organisation of disruptive innovation mechanisms specifically for the space sector. It uses the examples of the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts and the ESA Advanced Concepts Team, analyses their respective approaches and compares their results, leading to the proposal of\n\nConvergent innovation for sustainable economic growth and affordable universal health care: innovating the way we innovate.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDubÃ©, Laurette; Jha, Srivardhini; Faber, Aida; Struben, Jeroen; London, Ted; Mohapatra, Archisman; Drager, Nick; Lannon, Chris; Joshi, P K; McDermott, John\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThis paper introduces convergent innovation (CI) as a form of meta-innovation-an innovation in the way we innovate. CI integrates human and economic development outcomes, through behavioral and ecosystem transformation at scale, for sustainable prosperity and affordable universal health care within a whole-of-society paradigm. To this end, CI combines technological and social innovation (including organizational, social process, financial, and institutional), with a special focus on the most underserved populations. CI takes a modular approach that convenes around roadmaps for real world change-a portfolio of loosely coupled complementary partners from the business community, civil society, and the public sector. Roadmaps serve as collaborative platforms for focused, achievable, and time-bound projects to provide scalable, sustainable, and resilient solutions to complex challenges, with benefits both to participating partners and to society. In this paper, we first briefly review the literature on technological innovation that sets the foundations of CI and motivates its feasibility. We then describe CI, its building blocks, and enabling conditions for deployment and scaling up, illustrating its operational forms through examples of existing CI-sensitive innovation.

Geneva\n\n2018-01-01\n\nÂ In this talk I will show that the space in which scientific, technological and economic developments interplay with each other can be mathematically shaped using pioneering multilayer network and complexity techniques. We build the tri-layered network of human activities (scientific production, patenting, and industrial production) and study the interactions among them, also taking into account the possible time delays. Within this construction we can identify which capabilities and prerequisites are needed to be competitive in a given activity, and even measure how much time is needed to transform, for instance, the technological know-how into economic wealth and scientific innovation, being able to make predictions with a very long time horizon. Quite unexpectedly, we find empirical evidence that the naive knowledge flow from science, to patents, to products is not supported by data, being instead technology the best predictor for industrial and scientific production for the next decades. &...\n\nModelling efficient innovative work: integration of economic and social psychological approaches\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBabanova Yulia\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article deals with the relevance of integration of economic and social psychological approaches to the solution of enhancing the efficiency of innovation management. The content, features and specifics of the modelling methods within each of approaches are unfolded and options of integration are considered. The economic approach lies in the generation of the integrated matrix concept of management of innovative development of an enterprise in line with the stages of innovative work and the use of the integrated vector method for the evaluation of the innovative enterprise development level. The social psychological approach lies in the development of a system of psychodiagnostic indexes of activity resources within the scope of psychological innovative audit of enterprise management and development of modelling methods for the balance of activity trends. Modelling the activity resources is based on the system of equations accounting for the interaction type of psychodiagnostic indexes. Integration of two approaches includes a methodological level, a level of empirical studies and modelling methods. There are suggested options of integrating the economic and psychological approaches to analyze available material and non-material resources of the enterprisesâ innovative work and to forecast an optimal option of development based on the implemented modelling methods.\n\nOrganizational-economic maintenance of innovation activity in the region: comparative assessment\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNadezhda Igorevna Antipina\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFull Text Available The article proposes the approach to evaluate the organizational-economic maintenance of innovation activity in the regions in quantitative and qualitative indicators, as well as the method to calculate the assessment of regulatory support of this activity.

This study suggests the need for a systemic view of policies related to the industrial base and innovation in health and the construction of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS. The authors investigate the relations between health, innovation, and development, seeking to show and update the political, economic, and social determinants of the recent Brazilian experience with the Health Economic-Industrial Complex (HEIC. They discuss how the agenda for innovation and domestic industrial production in health gained a central place in the project for construction of the SUS. The article thus seeks to link inherent issues from the agenda for development, production, and innovation to social policy in healthcare, as observed in recent years, and based on this analysis, points to political and conceptual challenges for implementing the SUS, especially as regards strengthening its technological and industrial base. As a byproduct, the article develops an analytical and factual focus on the consolidation of the HEIC in Brazil, both as a dynamic vector of industrial development, generating investment, income, employment, and innovations, and as a decisive element for reducing vulnerability and structural dependence in health. The authors aim to show that strengthening the SUS and orienting it to social needs is an essential part of building a social Welfare State in Brazil.\n\nInclusive Innovation in Biohacker Spaces: The Role of Systems and Networks\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJeremy de Beer\n\n2018-02-01\n\nFull Text Available In this article, we examine the development of biohacker spaces and their impact on innovation systems through the lens of inclusive innovation. Examining issues associated with people, activities, outcomes, and governance, we observe that biohacker spaces offer an alternative approach to biotechnological research outside the orthodox walls of academia, industry, and government. We explain that harnessing the full innovative potential of these spaces depends on flexible legal and regulatory systems, including appropriate biosafety regulations and intellectual property policies and practices, and organic, community-based social and financial networking.\n\nThe UK Ecosystem for Fostering Innovation in the Earth & Space Sciences\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, V. E.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe UK national government supports an ecosystem of government-funded organisations that carry a specific remit for innovation. By specifically cultivating the commercialisation of research where appropriate, the UK demonstrates a forward-thinking and coordinated approach to deriving economic and societal impact from scientific research activities. This presentation provides an overview of innovation activities at government-backed organisations that support the Earth and space science communities. At the broadest and highest levels, the UK has a whole-of-government approach to fostering innovation. The government also has a designated innovation agency - Innovate UK - which works with people, companies, and partner organisations to find and drive the science & technology innovations that will grow the UK economy. A primary source of scientific funding to UK-based researchers comes from the Research Councils UK (RCUK), which has seven constituent Research Councils. Along with funding activities that support basic research, innovation is supported through a variety of activities. The National Environmental Research Council (NERC), the UK's leading public funder for Earth & environmental science, has brought to market a wide variety of ideas and innovations, including by helping to register patents, negotiating licensing deals, and setting up spin-out companies or joint ventures with commercial organisations. Case studies of NERC commercialization successes will be given, as well as an overview of mechanisms by which NERC supports innovation. These include 'Pathfinder' awards that help enable researchers to develop a greater understanding of the commercial aspects and possibilities of their research. Complementary 'Follow-on Fund' awards provide proof-of-concept funding to support the commercialisation of ideas arising from NERC-funded research. Early-career researchers are also eligible for NERC's Environment Young Entrepreneurs Scheme.

In modern conditions, great attention is paid to economic sustainability which besides effectiveness takes into account the impact of human activities over the environment. Europe has always been one of leading forces of innovation in the world. However, its importance has constantly decreased due to rise of the US, Japan and newly of China. The European Union has oriented much effort towards fostering innovation through various policies and instruments in order to keep up with the growing pace of economic and technologic development in the modern world. By these policies, the EU aims at creating favourable conditions for countries to promote innovation taking into account the national peculiarities as to allow improved flexibility and adaptability. The main goal of the present paper is to assess the impact of the EU innovation policies upon sustainable development of the member countries. There are to be analysed the main paradigms,concepts, initiatives and strategies frame-working innovation in the EU and, consequently, their impact upon economic development and the consistence in facing new challenges. In the end,on the base on identified correlations, concrete actions and measures to foster performance of innovation policies in general are identified.\n\n\"Journal of Space Economics - theoretical and practical considerations\"\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBeldavs, VZ; Sommers, J.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis paper will address theoretical and practical considerations for the emerging field of space economics and propose an editorial policy for a journal of space economics to provide a forum for the discussion of space economics issues.

This has been a costly mistake not just of space policy, but also of economic policy and environmental policy. This is because it is very unlikely that space tourism will remain just a small-scale activity of the very rich; it is much more likely to grow into a major new industry, employing millions of people in high quality employment - eventually much of it outside the Earth's eco-system. This is particularly important because, although the European âsocial-economic modelâ has greater popular support than the âUSA modelâ (including among the general USA population), Europe today faces the major problem of high unemployment, which is imposing heavy social and economic costs. If Europe makes serious efforts soon to encourage the growth of passenger space travel, and of the many other economically and environmentally valuable space activities to which this will lead, then commercial space activities could become a major new axis of economic growth and employment-creation for Europe. Moreover, Europe has several advantages over the USA, Russia, Japan, China and India, and so could play a leading role in this field, if policy errors are corrected.

P. Anisimov\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article explores the theoretical foundations of innovative potential of the enterprise and its role for sustainable development and economic security. The urgency of the problem of sustainable development innovative capacity, low level of theoretical and practical elaboration, poor methodological and conceptual basis for the development of economic security, increasing competitiveness and strengthening market situation of enterprises, determined the choice of the research topic. Scientific awareness of the key problems of the economy determined the significance of the research topic, the relevance of which is determined by the need for new theoretical concepts, methodological developments and practical recommendations on the role of innovation potential in the management system of economic security of enterprises. The system of economic security management is the basis of the successful functioning and development of enterprises. In market conditions, the economic security of organizations is directly outside-the implementation of innovations into the production process, which is an effective means of increasing competitiveness, improving the quality of products. The innovative capacity of enterprises consists of a unique ability to increase such components as material and investment, information, personnel that will help the organization to achieve new strategic goals. It should be noted that not all products are offered by organizations on the existing market, generates potential, but only one that is potentially profitable. That is, the products created on the basis of innovative technologies, from-while a high quality and should demand amongst consumers. Economic security policy is a system of views, different measures, methods of solutions, specific actions in the area of economic security, which determine the conditions for achieving business goals. Thus, the implemented security policy allocates the organization to carry out economic\n\nRegional Innovation System And Local Economic Development In Indonesia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAdiwan F Aritenang\n\n2013-08-01\n\nFull Text Available In Indonesia, decentralization and globalization has introduced a new spirit for localism. Since decentralisation, regions have been motivated to accelerate economic development through local endowment and resources. The democratic Indonesia government has been interested to follow economy theories and case studies develop in the advance countries. Over the years, government policies have supported and strengthen technology development through industrial clusters and national and regional innovation systems. This research aims to explore current progress of Indonesia innovation system through industrial clusters. The research found the presence of industry clustering and very limited innovation system in Indonesia. The research argues that these activities has significant impact on employment growth, but does not increase the industry's value added.\n\nDoes Innovation Performance Depend on Economic Growth?: The Case of a Country in Transition\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndrzej H Jasinski\n\n2011-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper is an attempt to analyze a possible influence of economic growth on innovation performance. Econometric model based on principal component analysis is the research tool. Poland, as a country in transition, is here a case-study. The analysis has confirmed an interesting pattern: in 1989-2007, corporate innovation performance was changing, in principle, in the same direction as macro-economic changes but with a one-to-two-year delay. This is some proof that the innovation activity followed the cyclical development of the national economy. Innovation performance was demand-driven, i.e., pulled by demand resulting from the economy's recovery and high economic growth. So, technological innovation appeared to be highly sensitive to the general economic situation in Poland as a transitional economy. Economic growth seems to be a kind of tag-boat pulling innovation activities in the business sector.Este artÃ­culo intenta analizar una posible influencia del crecimiento econÃ³mico en el desempeÃ±o de la innovaciÃ³n. La herramienta de investigaciÃ³n empleada es el modelo economÃ©trico basado en un componente principal de anÃ¡lisis. El estudio de caso es Polonia, una economÃ­a en transiciÃ³n. El anÃ¡lisis ha confirmado un patrÃ³n interesante: durante el periodo 1989-2007, el desempeÃ±o de la innovaciÃ³n cambiÃ³, en principio, en la misma direcciÃ³n que los cambios macroeconÃ³micos pero con un retraso de uno a dos aÃ±os. Esto muestra de algÃºn modo que la actividad innovadora correspondiÃ³ al desarrollo cÃ­clico de la economÃ­a nacional. El desempeÃ±o innovador se orientÃ³ por la demanda, es decir, una demanda impulsada por la recuperaciÃ³n econÃ³mica y el alto crecimiento econÃ³mico. Por lo tanto, la innovaciÃ³n tecnolÃ³gica parece ser muy sensible a la situaciÃ³n econÃ³mica en general de Polonia, como economÃ­a en transiciÃ³n. El crecimiento econÃ³mico parece ser una especie de motor que impulsa las actividades innovadoras del sector de negocios.\n\nEvolutionary-Hierarchical Bases of the Formation of Cluster Model of Innovation Economic Development\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYuliya Vladimirovna Dubrovskaya\n\n2016-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The functioning of a modern economic system is based on the interaction of objects of different hierarchical levels. Thus, the problem of the study of innovation processes taking into account the mutual influence of the activities of these economic actors becomes important. The paper dwells evolutionary basis for the formation of models of innovation development on the basis of micro and macroeconomic analysis. Most of the concepts recognized that despite a big number of diverse models, the coordination of the relations between economic agents is of crucial importance for the successful innovation development. According to the results of the evolutionary-hierarchical analysis, the authors reveal key phases of the development of forms of business cooperation, science and government in the domestic economy. It has become the starting point of the conception of the characteristics of the interaction in the cluster models of innovation development of the economy. Considerable expectancies on improvement of the national innovative system are connected with the development of cluster and network structures. The main objective of government authorities is the formation of mechanisms and institutions that will foster cooperation between members of the clusters. The article explains that the clusters cannot become the factors in the growth of the national economy, not being an effective tool for interaction between the actors of the regional innovative systems.\n\nSpaces for sustainable innovation : solar photovoltaic electricity in the UK.\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSmith, A.G.; Kern, F.; Raven, R.P.J.M.; Verhees, B.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper engages with recent research concerning the roles of niche spaces in the strategic management of sustainable innovations.

Over the last two decades there has been an increasing interest by economists in the technologist's view of technical change and its mechanisms. The author looks at the zone between technology and economics, the technological economics, and discusses the theory of innovation recently sketched out by Nelson and Winter. The relevance to project management and technology transfer of contemporary writing by economists leads to the view that there are welcome signs of a convergence of the conceptual models now emerging and the practical problems of technology management and movement. Economists now seem more willing to come to terms with technology than technologists with economics. The economic significance of the multitudes of technically unglamorous activities in development work is seriously neglected as a result of over-emphasis on the spectacular technological break. If economic elegance were to be admitted to the criteria of success, one might get a significant improvement in the engineering of technological change. 29 references, 4 figure.\n\nInnovative Methods in Strategic Planning of Foreign Economic Activity of Enterprises\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nValentyna Yakubiv\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Changes in the external conditions of business in Ukraine, European integration vector of the country development, and possibilities of import/export operations facilitate foreign trade.

It is in the scope of OECD's International Futures Programme. The global space economy, as defined by the OECD Space Forum, comprises the space industry's core activities in space manufacturing and in satellite operations, plus other consumer activities that have been derived over the years from governmental research and development. In 2013 commercial revenues generated by the space economy amounted to USD 256.2 billion globally that is huge amount of space investment in the world. Recently, Turkey has also entered to the sector and it has growing strategic interest in space. First satellite project was started with a technology transfer from UK by TUBITAK Space Technologies Research Institute in 2001 and it launched to its orbit in 2003. Then RASAT and GÃKTÃRK-2 satellites were developed and launched to their orbits respectively in 2011 and 2012. Today, we have other satellite projects that are going on, too. However, we do not have a mechanism or a model to assess the impacts of those projects. What kind of model can be used to measure the impact of direct public R&D and innovation investments in Turkish space sector? The aim of this study is to develop a model which would be useful for monitoring the performance of R&D and Innovation investments that are conducted through government policies and strategies and so on to give feedback for effective strategy making. When we look at the impact analysis studies in Turkey, we see a few such as TUBITAK (ÃzÃ§elik and Taymaz, 2008; Erden, 2010; TandoÇ§an, 2011), Ä°Åkur (World Bank Report, 2013), Ministry of Economy (TTGV, 2013), Development Agencies (Ä°ZKA, 2011; ElÃ§i vd., 2011; PÄ±nar, 2014; Meydan, 2014). There is need for a systematic approach to impact analysis. Since there is no data for this study, we would develop a model with\n\nHealth Physics Innovations Developed During Cassini for Future Space Applications\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNickell, Rodney E.; Rutherford, Theresa M.; Marmaro, George M.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe long history of space flight includes missions that used Space Nuclear Auxiliary Power devices, starting with the Transit 4A Spacecraft (1961), continuing through the Apollo, Pioneer, Viking, Voyager, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Pathfinder, and most recently, Cassini (1997). All Major Radiological Source (MRS) missions were processed at Kennedy Space Center/Cape Canaveral Air Station (KSC/CCAS) Launch Site in full compliance with program and regulatory requirements. The cumulative experience gained supporting these past missions has led to significant innovations which will be useful for benchmarking future MRS mission ground processing. Innovations developed during ground support for the Cassini mission include official declaration of sealed-source classifications, utilization of a mobile analytical laboratory, employment of a computerized dosimetry record management system, and cross-utilization of personnel from related disciplines.\n\nThermodynamics of long-run economic innovation and growth\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGarrett, Timothy J.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis article derives prognostic expressions for the "
