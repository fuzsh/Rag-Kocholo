        "text": "Stage 1. Starting up (April–December, year 1)\n\nIn April, year 1, I am invited by Daniel, USC coordinator at my local university (LU), to join a national internship program (NIP) as one of four academics from this university. The idea is that the academic (“mover”) should work part-time at a host organisation for a 3-6-month period during “year 2” and have own workplace there. I feel very proud to have been asked, and thrilled about the opportunity to collaborate with external actors. Daniel conveys NIP guidelines, which among other things require the academic and the host to keep a diary during visits and participate in follow-up examinations. Daniel summons me and the other movers to a group interview that is audio-visually recorded. All these requirements seem somewhat overwhelming, but I am also impressed with the seriousness of the endeavour. The obligation to keep a diary prompts me to start the logbook.\n\nSince my research interest lies on the management of human services, I believe that the County Council (CC) may be a potential host organisation for my internship. Daniel firstly contacts them and I then take over communication with Margareta, who is division manager at CC research and development unit. I present my background and sphere of competence, and immediately get a positive response.\n\nIn September, I meet with Margareta and four of her unit managers to present my proposition to use the internship for research on a CC undertaking of their choice. Being a bit anxious for the meeting, I have prepared well, but so have also the unit managers, each presenting a potential project for our collaboration. I am quite amazed with the reception. After further communication, we agree that I will follow a recently created project where a mobile team (MMT) staffed with doctor and nurse will provide home-based care to multiple-disabled adults in case of suddenly upcoming conditions. The intention is to avoid unnecessary hospital intake for this vulnerable target group; after the one-year project period, CC management will decide if the team should be permanently inaugurated or not. My task will be to follow and document the team's undertakings during the first half of the project period in order to assess the team's organisational design, external integration and patient outcome, to be presented in an evaluation report as foundation for the coming CC decision. In combination with this task, I will also have the opportunity to collect data for own research. Our agreement is based upon a written proposal I send to Margareta to which she consents.\n\nI am very expectant:\n\nVignette. September, year 1. E-mail from me to Daniel:\n\nMy expectations on this collaboration is to work with something that is considered important and interesting for practice and that lies within my area of competence. I also expect to gain new insights on how certain parts of the health care system works. These insights might lead to new research ideas.\n\nThe MMT idea originated from one hospital manager, Beatrix, who is now project leader. During the autumn, I meet with Beatrix and the two team members, Doctor Ann and Nurse Doris, a couple of times to get insights on the project and to discuss my evaluation approach. These meetings contribute to raise my expectations:\n\nVignette. November, year 1. Notes from first meeting with team:\n\nThe doctor and I go through a draft template for documentation of house calls. I make some suggestions that are positively received.\n\nReflection: It feels good that they want to talk and listen to me!\n\nAlso on the second meeting with MMT, discussions seem promising and mutually fruitful. Here, a CC controller also participates, asking for my “expert opinion” on what data the team should register from their house calls. I am eager to been seen as useful for practice – not a guest from “the ivory tower” or a criticizing inspector! I had expected to also meet Beatrix to discuss my schedule for the internship starting in January next year, but she isn't there. I am thinking that I will have to draw up my own timetable.\n\nNext, I participate in an information meeting that MMT holds for primary care (PC) actors. The team picks me up by car to go to a PC centre. During the meeting, I am able to sit on the side and take notes without anyone taking much notice of me. Afterwards in the car, Nurse Doris remarks to Dr. Ann that it would have been better if PC actors had been invited to participate earlier in the project process. I sense some frustration regarding project preparations.\n\nThese meetings allow me to better grasp the role of the team in the overall caretaking of the target group. As my intention is to also use the internship for own research, I begin to note potential research ideas; e.g. regarding the caring profession's perspective on collaboration.\n\nAccording to NIP requirements, a formal contract must be signed between my university and the partner organisation. Daniel signals that this is an urgent matter and as soon as CC manager Margareta and I have agreed on collaboration, I inform him whom to contact at the host organisation. In October, and again in November, I remind Daniel about the contract but receive no response and begin to wonder why. Finally in December, Daniel e-mails that he has been occupied; now he will let the university lawyer draw up a contract. After that, I don’t hear from Daniel again.\n\nVignette. Re-reflection, year 3:\n\nI still don’t know if any contract was ever signed.\n\nStage 2. Engagement (January–April, year 2)\n\nThe engagement stage constitutes the actual internship period of four months from 1st January. During this period, there is no communication with university actors at all. I take no initiative to contact LU liaison office, and nobody contacts me. Actually, I am fully occupied with the internship and do not really bother; rather, it suits me fine to be more independent.\n\nMy interactions with county council and team actors are, on the other hand, intense through meetings, telephone calls and e-mail communication.\n\nI call Dr. Ann to ask if I could join the team on their house calls for a couple of days to get a better understanding for their work. The team is currently situated in very narrow localities so Ann suggests that I participate when they have moved to a bigger office at the hospital. I reflect that she feels positive and accommodating.\n\nIn mid-February, I get to spend two full days with the team. Their “bigger” office turns out to be a crammed room furnished with desks for Ann and Doris and a tiny table for me. It is definitely not a workplace where I can spend my internship. So apart from these two days and team-related meetings, I fulfil the internship from my university office.\n\nI find it very interesting to follow the team on their home visits. We travel by car and when entering the patient's home, the doctor goes first and introduces herself, followed by the nurse who does the same, and I come last. I usually stand in a corner and watch their work but may occasionally help out by lighting lamps etc. During car rides and breaks, we chat on both work-related and personal matters. In their office, I sit next to Dr. Ann and can follow her work on the computer screen:\n\nVignette: February, year 2. Notes from first day:\n\nBack at the team’s office. Dr Ann sits down by the computer to enter prescriptions and to contact various people (doctors, nurses, others) with information, questions or instructions, and to register the house calls. Dr Ann shows me how slow the patient records system works.\n\nRe-reflection, year 3: I was here a very passive observer, most of the time I did not even understand what I was looking at.\n\nDuring this two-day visit, the team shares their thoughts with me, displaying both excitement about their work with the patients, and critique of project preparations.\n\nOn the other hand, project leader Beatrix is too busy with her ordinary job to engage herself much with the project, or with me. Thus, I independently plan the internship work.\n\nAs part of my evaluation of the MMT project, I perform a considerable number of interviews with CC actors. Beginning with the doctor, Ann describes that she was at first excited about working in the team to support multiple-disabled adults. After joining she was however frustrated with having to fix with many practical things such as developing work routines and procure medical equipment, before the team could start making house-calls. Half-way through the interview, Ann suddenly declares: “I have resigned from the team.” Apparently, the doctor and the project leader have quite fallen out. These are worrying news for the project and for my internship! On my question what would make her withdraw her resignation, Ann contends that she would like a more engaged project leader, and the conversation continues:\n\nVignette. February, year 2. Transcript from interview:\n\nMe: Such a decision would require intervention from somebody higher up – Henry [head of primary care], or who is Beatrix’ boss?\n\nDr. Ann: Margareta is overall project owner.\n\nMe: So the ball is really with her whether the project will continue?\n\nDr. Ann: Yes.\n\nMe: Does she know about this [decision to quit]?\n\nDr. Ann: No. But maybe she ought to know.\n\nRe-reflection year 4: Here, I suddenly took on a new role: receiving confidences. It felt like a sign of having gained a closer relationship with a key actor; but I was also a bit baffled with not recognizing this conflict before.\n\nAs this transcript displays, the bonds developed during the home-visit days dares me to engage in the conflict. Next, I interview Nurse Doris. She believes that the team's house calls work very well. She appreciates the collaboration with the doctor; should Ann leave, it is doubtful that Doris will stay. Doris also mentions that the team and Beatrix will meet with PC head Henry, to inquire about the team's future. She and the doctor “have overheard” that it has already been decided to make MMT permanent.\n\nVignette. Reflection after interview:\n\nPeculiar to make the team permanent without evaluation or analysis or discussion with the team.\n\nAs I turns out, I am not invited to the team's meeting with Henry even though I am thinking this could have been relevant for my evaluation. The day after their meeting, in beginning of March, I contact the nurse regarding a patient survey, but without response. I now feel a bit outside and confused.\n\nA couple of days later, Beatrix suddenly requests a telephone meeting to update me on the project. Henry has confirmed his intention to keep the team, but no official decision has been taken. The issue of Ann's resignation is not brought up until I mention it, to which Beatrix responds that the doctor wishes to be more closely involved in project management. Then I ask how she looks upon my work. She claims to appreciate it:\n\nVignette: March, year 2. Notes from telephone conversation:\n\nBeatrix: It is very valuable with someone from the outside looking at our work, what patients and healthcare partners think. Not just us sitting and complaining. Your report will be an important foundation for Henry regardless of whether the project terminates with Dr. Ann or not.\n\nLater the very same day, Doris comes by my office to deliver some patient surveys and we come to talk for quite a while. The meeting with Henry was “pointless”, she says; further, Dr. Ann is still dissatisfied and thinking of quitting. I suggest to Doris that they deliver their viewpoints to the appropriate person.\n\nA few days later, I send a short summary of the patient survey to the team. I get a quick response:\n\nVignette. Mid-March, year 2. E-mail from Dr. Ann:\n\nThank you for the information. I talked to Margareta today. I think it was your idea. It felt good. She understood my points about project management and will see to that it improves. So I will stay.\n\nReflection: Maybe I have done some good after all!!\n\nHere, I feel quite pleased with possibly having made a positive impact on the project's continuation, for the benefit of both the CC, the disabled – and myself.\n\nInteractions during home visits and interviews concurrently spur new ideas for own research, e.g. regarding professional roles in home-based care, or methodological reflections on the “shadowing” method. Hoping to gain further input to future research, I choose add own research time to the NIP funded internship time. During March, I interview many nurses, managers and administrators in the surrounding healthcare system to inquire about their collaboration with the team. Most actors seem enthusiastic about the MMT idea. Some respondents take the opportunity to bring viewpoints back to the team such as suggested improvements. In a few instances, however, the respondent confidentially shares critique on team endeavours. Yet other actors had not heard about the project; I then have to explain to them about the MMT idea. Altogether, interactions with actors in the surrounding empirical field are multifaceted and place diverse demands on my evaluator/researcher role.\n\nWhen interviewing Ola, manager at a primary care centre and head of MMT steering committee, he mentions that Henry, head of PC, intends to place MMT at Ola's PC centre; still, the project must firstly be evaluated: “it must show that the team has had a positive effect”; hence suggesting that the decision is still open.\n\nI get the notion that participating in MMT steering committee meetings would be valuable and so I e-mail Beatrix to inquire about the next meeting. There is no answer. During a visit at Dr. Ann's and Nurse Doris' modest office, they however invite me to the next meeting; this proves to be an interesting occasion.\n\nVignette. Early April, year 2. Notes from MMT steering committee meeting:\n\nParticipants when meeting starts: Margareta, Ola, Beatrix, Ann, Doris, myself.\n\nBeatrix unexpectedly asks about my report. I describe my data collection activities […] and try to think up some preliminary findings. [---]\n\nBeatrix informs that MMT will formally be organized under Ola’s PC centre but physically remain in their current localities during the project period.\n\nDiscussions commence regarding staffing of MMT during Summer.\n\nReflection after the meeting: I get the feeling that they aim for a mediocre solution instead of rethinking all parts: staff dependency, scope, target group. Bring up in report! Feels ad-hoc.\n\nMore persons join the meeting: a hospital coordinator and the local authority disability care manager, Ron. The remainder of the meeting addresses MMT collaboration with the local authority, which is a key issue during the entire project period. After the meeting, I join CC actors in the car ride back to the university and hospital area. Margareta says she looks forward to my report. I am pleased with being allowed to participate in official project meetings. On the other hand, I have become a bit apprehensive regarding the county council's intentions to actually consider my conclusions:\n\nVignette. Reflection after the meeting:\n\nI seriously believe that they will ignore my report if it doesn’t say what they already want to do; but if it does, they can use it to legitimize [what they have already intended to do].\n\nMy interviews with actors in the empirical field generally progress satisfactory, with the exception of actors in primary care. I spend considerable time trying to gain access. Since primary care has chief medical responsibility for disabled patients, MMT collaboration with PC is vital; yet, there are signals that this collaboration is not functioning well. But when contacting primary care for interviews, I meet a dismissing attitude – not sure if this depends on my affiliation with MMT or their strained work situation.\n\nWith the exception of this drawback, I find it very interesting and engaging to meet the actors in the healthcare system surrounding MMT and listen to their stories. The expanding load of empirical material feels promising but also somewhat overwhelming: how proceed with all this? There are many possible routes to take in future research, I think.\n\nMy final interview is with project leader Beatrix. She takes the opportunity to thoroughly explain the arduous project start with resistance from primary care, perhaps to counter possible critique in my evaluation report. Moreover, she argues that the team has good political support and that the key issue is not whether to make the team permanent, but how to design it. Actually, local authority disability services staff are very positive towards MMT: to verify this Beatrix reads aloud from an e-mail praising the team's support to disabled patients. This interview provides insights into what the project leader, apparently, expects from my evaluation report.\n\nIn late April, I eventually find out date, time and place to the next steering committee meeting from Ann and Doris. After checking with Beatrix, they say it is ok that I go with them to the meeting, which I appreciate. Nevertheless, I also feel a bit awkward:\n\nVignette. Late April, year 2. Reflection during steering committee meeting:\n\nI did not get the call to the meeting, or notes from the last one. Again: Am I in or am I out?\n\nThe meeting summons the same persons as the previous one except for Margareta. Beatrix goes through the memorandum from last meeting, which the others seem to have received. Next, she explains that she and local authority manager Ron have agreed to form a joint group to handle all collaboration between the county council and the local authority. Therefore the MMT steering committee will be dissolved. Apparently, this is the last meeting in the committee, which makes me quite concerned.\n\nBeatrix suddenly turns to me and asks: “Has Joline contacted you yet?” I am perplexed as it turns out that Joline is a CC communicator who will “package my report for politicians”, which I find quite worrying:\n\nVignette. Reflection during the meeting:\n\nThis is MY report!\n\nWithout MMT steering committee – where should I present my report?\n\nThis, somewhat discouraging, meeting rounds off my interactions with CC actors during the internship period.\n\nStage 3. Aftermath (May, year 2 – onwards)\n\nThe formal internship period is now over. During late spring and summer, I focus on report writing to fulfil my internship task.\n\nIn the beginning of May – after four months of mutual silence–I suddenly receive an e-mail from my university's liaison office. Noah, head of office, invites local “movers” to a follow-up meeting. I find it quite interesting to share experiences with the other movers. Noah takes notes for a summary to the national NIP report; neither the summary nor the NIP report is distributed to us movers.\n\nNobody asks for my diary; I am thinking this is just as well, considering all details on interactions and experiences that I have entered!\n\nIn Mid-June, I meet with the team to check some facts for my report. Beatrix says PC head Henry is awaiting the report as foundation for his decision on MMT. She thinks he ought to invite me to a PC management meeting to present my report. Beatrix will send me a mailing list of those officials and politicians who should get the report. A few days later, however, she e-mails that I should only send the report to Henry. This makes me I wonder if the report will be “buried” if not receiving his approval.\n\nI finalize my MMT report at the end of June. It is a mainly positive evaluation of the team's potential to increase health and quality of life for multiple-disabled adults. In the conclusions I highlight two issues that need to be addressed in order for the team to function well: better delimitation of the target group, and an elevated team model that is jointly run by primary care and local authority disability care.\n\nNotwithstanding Beatrix’ instructions, I e-mail the report not only to Henry but also to the team and all (previous) steering committee members. I also express appreciation for our collaboration, propose to present the report on suitable meetings and point out my interest to further follow the process. Beatrix calls me up to say the report is great: “It warms my heart”. There is no response from Henry, but Margareta, my initial CC contact, gets back:\n\nVignette. July, year 2. E-mail from Margareta:\n\nThank you for the report. Interesting reading. Looking forward to future collaboration of some sort.\n\nThis feedback raises my expectation on continued contacts with the county council.\n\nIn parallel, CC communicator Joline contacts me to explain that she will design a presentation to show the “project's success” – which I find quite odd:\n\nVignette. June, year 2. Reflection after telephone call from Joline:\n\nAt first, I did not get this at all … I tried to emphasize that this is an independent evaluation based on research.\n\nLater in June, Joline informs that she will prepare slides to “visualize the benefits of MMT” for Beatrix’ and Henry's coming presentation to PC managers. It worries me that they seem to be presenting the report without me:\n\nVignette. Mid-July, year 2. Extract from logbook:\n\nJoline sends slides. I convey viewpoints.\n\nTelephone conversation with Joline, late August:\n\nBeatrix wants to present my report at PC management meeting at 2.00 pm today. I say the presentation is ok.\n\nReflection: It feels awkward that I am not there when the report is presented. I must call Beatrix next week to inquire how the presentation went, and what is the next step.\n\nAt this point, I feel as if both my report and my presentation of it have been hijacked. I try to contact Beatrix after the meeting, and finally reaches her in mid-September. Apparently, the slideshow didn’t work, and the reception from PC participants was “so-so”; altogether, Beatrix’ enthusiasm seems curbed. Next, she will present the report for CC Board of directors. She asks if I am interested to follow the further course of events, to which I eagerly consent. She will get back to me after the board meeting.\n\nIn October, I respond to a NIP national online survey regarding my experiences. I convey some critique on the local management of the collaboration arrangement. I also suggest further LU/NIP support to uphold established relationships with partner organisations. Later, I accidently find out that LU administrators were invited to a national NIP conference; this invitation was not passed on to movers.\n\nIn relation to county council actors, I still wish to uphold relationships for own research purposes. Beatrix does not get back to me after the CC board meeting and I am disappointed not hearing about the politicians' reactions on the MMT report or their decision on the team's future. Still, other assignments require my attention, so it takes time before I resume contact:\n\nVignette. February, year 3. E-mail to Beatrix:\n\nWhat is happening with MMT? Will the team be permanent?\n\nNo response.\n\nI look for protocols on CC webpage. MMT has not been on the agenda of the political council. I then try to reach the team directly:\n\nVignette. Mid-March, year 3. E-mail to Dr Ann:\n\nIs the team still existing? Please get back to me if possible.\n\nDr. Ann: The team has been made permanent but otherwise much remains to be desired. I will not stay.\n\nMe: Thank you for your response! Will Nurse Doris stay on? Could we meet?\n\nNo response.\n\nAs last attempt, I e-mail to Ola, former head of CC steering committee; he immediately responds and we have a brief telephone conversation where he explains that MMT is now under his PC centre. He says that Dr. Ann disagreed on the team's current work methods and will be replaced with another doctor. Apparently, the chosen team design has very little in common with the one I suggested. Ola doesn’t know how the decision to make the team permanent was made and refers me to Beatrix.\n\nLater during year 3, I begin to reflect more systematically on my experiences. I visit the NIP public website where I find a lot of documentation, also a set of initial instructions:\n\nVignette. Guidelines for internships [extract]:\n\n- The host organisation should assign resources for a mentor and possible internal training.\n\n- During the internship, there should be a close dialogue between the university and the partner organization.\n\n- The researcher should be an active “co-worker” and have a physical work place in order to be present and actively participate in the work.\n\nEvidently, neither of the above requirements were fulfilled in my case, or checked by LU actors."
