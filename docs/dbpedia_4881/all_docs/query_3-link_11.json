        "text": "IN A DAMP AND WINDY CORNER OF EASTERN England, a large run-down Victorian mansion stands as an unlikely monument to a revolutionary idea in education. It was here in the 1920's that a Scottish teacher founded Summerhill as the first modern ''free school,'' where classes were not compulsory and key decisions were made by an assembly of pupils and teachers. The objective was even more unorthodox: that children should be happy at school.\n\nIt proved to be a powerful idea that challenged the authoritarian tradition of British schooling and appealed to anti-establishment intellectuals. In the 1960's, Summerhill became a role model for alternative education in the United States, and to this day, the prolific and passionate writings of its founder, A. S. Neill, are studied widely by progressive educators.\n\nYet, 26 years after Neill's death, the school is largely forgotten in Britain. Or, rather, it was until last spring, when the British government threaten-ed to close it after inspectors from the Office for Standards in Education, or Ofsted, concluded that ''Summerhill is not providing an adequate education for its pupils.'' Suddenly it was back in the news. It had last been featured in London tabloids in 1992, when a television documentary showed teachers and pupils swimming naked together. This year, newspapers have had fun with headlines like ''Kool Skools Rool O.K.?'' and references to ''Lord of the Flies'' aplenty.\n\nBut if Summerhill is used to controversy, the recent Ofsted report was cause for particular alarm, because it attacked the school's defining policy of allowing children to decide whether they wanted an education. ''The school has drifted into confusing educational freedom with the negative right not to be taught,'' the report said. ''As a result, many pupils have been allowed to mistake the pursuit of idleness for the exercise of personal liberty.''\n\nThis verdict did not come out of the blue. Ofsted inspectors have been dissatisfied since at least 1990. Traditionally, British schools have been reviewed every five years or so, but inspections as a whole have become tougher and more frequent since 1997, when Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government took office, pledging to raise educational standards across Britain.\n\nA spokeswoman for Britain's Department for Education and Employment said that the Secretary of State, David Blunkett, had a duty to ensure that children were safe and being educated. She added, ''He has said that he cannot allow what is happening at Summerhill to continue.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
