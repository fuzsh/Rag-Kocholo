        "text": "Welcome to Meanwhile, in which I bundle together the finest hyperlinks loitering in my tabs and drop them into your inbox – fuel for the week ahead. Check out previous editions for further inspiration, fascination and procrastination.\n\nAn honour to have designed Joe Mulhall’s new book Rebel Sounds, coming from Footnote in September. Photograph of The Specials fans at Leeds Carnival in 1981, by the great Syd Shelton. For more rectangles of words and pictures, check out my site.\n\n“It's taught me much about myself over the years, even though I cringe at so much of what I've written. It helped me realise that consistently showing up without expectations often leads to more inspiration than relying on random bursts of motivation” –\n\n‘s Gabby Lord on the changes and challenges she's seen over a decade of design.\n\nAbsolutely astonishing shot by Peter Iain Campbell of the Ninian Northern oil platform being decommissioned in Lerwickby Harbour, Shetland. Looks like Howl’s Moving Castle regurgitated by shonky AI, but it’s real.\n\nSee also: Jonathan Hoefler’s Life Imitates AI Art.\n\nAnthony Burrill uses typography to visualise the work of rock's greatest drummers, joining forces with five music legends in a unique collaboration to raise funds for Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nTim Andraka’s art will break how you see the world.\n\nMS Paint in browser is all very well, but call me when you’ve recreated Deluxe Paint IV (via relentless blog overlord J-Kott).\n\nSlate’s spot-on review of Deadpool and Wolverine, a film I begrudgingly went to see (because I don’t like to miss an issue) but was genuinely surprised by. Soooooo much better than the first two. It’s The Madagascar 3 of Deadpool films. I just wish they hadn’t spaffed quite so much of the casting in the marketing. People were going to show up, you didn’t need to reveal that BLANK and BLANK and BLANK were involved.\n\nIn memory of Sir Kenneth Grange, 1929-2024.\n\nSubstack finally offers in-app post editing! It’s still missing a couple of little features that I’d want before giving it a spin – namely syncing drafts and the ability to add a subtitle – but so glad this is finally a thing.\n\nThat is all."
