And now the video essay is on YouTube:\n\nIt‚Äôs a quick one about the sustained two-shot, a type of shot that was used a lot in the olden days but still has its uses today ‚Äî and gives actors room to actually act.\n\nSo happy to see Ramos and Zhou back at it. I‚Äôm not sure if I should even say this, but they indicated during their XOXO appearance that there will be more to come (in fewer than 8 years).\n\nHere‚Äôs my post about them shuttering the channel and a few of my favorite videos of theirs.\n\nMapping Cinematic Paths\n\nArtist and illustrator Andrew DeGraff makes maps that show where the characters travel during movies ‚Äî imagine Billy‚Äôs trail maps from Family Circus but for films like Back to the Future, The Breakfast Club, Pulp Fiction, and Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nDeGraff collected these maps into a book called Cinemaps: An Atlas of 35 Great Movies.\n\nSaturday Night\n\nSaturday Night is a forthcoming movie directed by Jason Reitman about the premiere of Saturday Night Live.\n\nAt 11:30pm on October 11, 1975, a ferocious troupe of young comedians and writers changed television ‚Äî and culture ‚Äî forever. Directed by Jason Reitman and written by Gil Kenan & Reitman, Saturday Night is based on the true story of what happened behind the scenes in the 90 minutes leading up to the first broadcast of Saturday Night Live. Full of humor, chaos, and the magic of a revolution that almost wasn‚Äôt, we count down the minutes in real time until we hear those famous words‚Ä¶\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Succession‚Äôs Nicholas Braun (Cousin Greg) plays both Andy Kaufman and Jim Henson in the film. (via @ernie.tedium.co)\n\nPoint Break & Kathryn Bigelow‚Äôs Revolutionary POV Shots\n\nIn this video, Evan Puschak takes a close look at the iconic chase scene in Point Break to see how director Kathryn Bigelow uses POV shots to help put the viewer right into the action in a way that is incredibly immersive. Oh, and there a surprise appearance by Disneyland‚Äôs Mr. Toad‚Äôs Wild Ride.\n\nConfession: I have never seen Point Break. Guess I should watch it now?\n\nHow Sci-Fi Movies Have Changed Since the 50s\n\nIn this visual essay (and video embedded above), Alvin Chang shows how science fiction movies have gotten darker and more complex since the 1950s, when many movies were set in the present with a clear existential threat that was then overcome.\n\nBut these days, it‚Äôs much more likely that protagonists also have to overcome societal forces ‚Äî political movements, systemic inequality, rampant capitalism. These are basically things that seem too big to fix.\n\nIt‚Äôs also far more likely that the narrative explores inner conflicts ‚Äî moral dilemmas, identity crises, and wrestling with our understanding of what it means to be human. We don‚Äôt just face outside threats; we also face threats within ourselves.\n\nUltimately, today‚Äôs sci-fi stories are far more likely to be a commentary on current social issues. These might be critiques of political ideologies, runaway capitalism, irresponsible innovation, human apathy, or eroding mental health.\n\n(via studio d)\n\nMoving Posters for Studio Ghibli Films\n\nBritish designer Hayden Wills has created some cool moving posters for Studio Ghibli films like Howl‚Äôs Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and The Wind Rises.\n\nYou can see more of Wills‚Äô posters on Behance, download the collection on Steam, or learn how to make your own moving posters in Photoshop.\n\nSee also Moving Film Posters. (via @0xjessel)\n\nAyo Edebiri Browses the Criterion Collection\n\nAs if we needed more reasons to love her, Ayo Edebiri is a total film dork. First, there‚Äôs the account on Letterboxd ‚Äî her review of Empire Strikes Back: ‚Äúthis movie is great but I was really shocked by how ugly Yoda was sorry if that pisses anybody off but I had only seen baby Yoda and adult Yoda is fucking busted‚Äù. And recently, she totally nerded out in the Criterion Collection closet.\n\nThe actor shares her love for sexy and stylish heist movies like Charade and Thief; praises the work of Juzo Itami (whom she calls ‚Äúthe G.O.A.T.‚Äù) and his wife, Nobuko Miyamoto; and talks about the African American surrealist imagery in To Sleep with Anger.\n\nSo infectiously joyful! As one of the YT commenters said:\n\nBetween the prepared list on her phone and the Radiohead t-shirt I feel like this was the closest the comments section has been to having one of us in the closet\n\nThe Science Behind the Emotions in Inside Out 2\n\nFor National Geographic, Tony Hale (who played Fear in Inside Out 2) talks to psychologist and author Dr. Lisa Damour about Pixar‚Äôs new film, her role as a consultant for the filmmakers, and what science says about the emotions in the movie. From The Kid Should See This:\n\nBy blending Pixar‚Äôs storytelling with scientific expertise, the Inside Out films and this discussion help make the complex topic of emotional development approachable and more familiar. They offer viewers of all ages vocabulary to better understand and express their feelings, while normalizing the intricate emotional experiences we encounter throughout life.\n\nI have heard a lot of good things about Damour‚Äôs books from other parents, particularly Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions into Adulthood and The Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.\n\nVox also has a really interesting article on the science of the emotions of Inside Out 2, with quotes from Damour and emotion scientist Dacher Keltner.\n\nOne of the things that happens when people become teenagers is that their brain becomes more sophisticated, and it allows for self-conscious emotions. Before age 13, kids are concrete in their thinking. They can‚Äôt always see things from another perspective. Then around 13 or 14, the ability to picture oneself on the outside, to imagine different scenarios, arrives as a result of brain development.\n\nWith that arrival comes the ability to be embarrassed and to imagine what other people think of you. Or to have envy, to want something somebody else has and to want to know why you don‚Äôt have it. Ennui is so funny and wonderful and really maps onto the natural disdain and over-it-ness teenagers can have for everything. Then, of course, anxiety is a major player in this movie. What anxiety requires is the ability to imagine and anticipate. Fear is our response to the threat right in front of us, whereas anxiety is picturing things that might happen.\n\nSee also The Making of ‚ÄúInside Out 2‚Äù episode of Damour‚Äôs podcast.\n\nAs the parent of two teens and also as someone who perhaps remembers a little too much what it felt like to be a teenager, I found Inside Out 2‚Äôs portrayal of the emotions (and how to manage them) to be really convincing. (via the kid should see this)\n\nGladiator II\n\nOk, this trailer for Ridley Scott‚Äôs Gladiator II really got me wound up. Denzel Washington, Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, Connie Nielsen ‚Äî I am here for all of it. November 22 can‚Äôt come soon enough (for several reasons‚Ä¶)\n\nThe Avengers Assemble for Lakota Dub\n\nMembers of the original cast of The Avengers (Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, and Mark Ruffalo) reunited to dub the movie in the Lakota language.\n\nMark Ruffalo and members of the initiative sit down with us to share the story of this amazing reunion and its very special cause. From the recording studio to the big screen, we explore this important cinematic milestone and celebrate the release that took over 15 months, 62 Lakota-Dakota language speakers, and the original Avengers team to come together and Assemble!\n\nMore details from the Lakota Times:\n\nOn June 14th, 2024, Disney plus will release the Avengers film that will be dubbed in Lakota. Cyril ‚ÄúChuck‚Äù Archambault, Ray Taken Alive, Dallas Nelson, Lawrence Archambault along with the Lakota Reclamation Project, Grey Willow Studios, students from McLaughlin school, elders from the Standing Rock community and many others have all worked very hard together to complete this project.\n\nA couple of years ago, Ray and Chuck talked about the idea of dubbing the Avengers movie. From there, Chuck spoke with Mark Ruffalo about the idea and Ruffalo said he will get back to them about it. Several months later, a meeting was set up with Marvel and Disney to discuss this idea. Not only did they approve of the project, but Marvel and Deluxe studios helped them through it.\n\nFrom there, they were able to receive a grant to help with funding, within the budgets they made sure that the Elders would be the highest paid in the project.\n\nHere‚Äôs the poster for the Lakota dub, which is now streaming on Disney+ (change the language option to Lakota).\n\nSee also Why Star Wars Was Dubbed Into the Navajo Language.\n\nAnxiety in Inside Out 2 Is Too Real\n\nNY Times critic Maya Phillips wrote about seeing her anxiety reflected in Pixar‚Äôs Inside Out 2.\n\nWhen an emotion takes over in the ‚ÄúInside Out‚Äù movies, a control board in Riley‚Äôs mind changes to that feeling‚Äôs color; Anxiety‚Äôs takeover, however, is more absolute. She creates a stronghold in Riley‚Äôs imagination, where she forces mind workers to illustrate negative hypothetical scenarios for Riley‚Äôs future. Soon, Riley‚Äôs chief inner belief is of her inadequacy; the emotions hear ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough‚Äù as a low, rumbling refrain in her mind.\n\nI‚Äôm familiar with anxiety‚Äôs hold on the imagination; my mind is always writing the script to the next worst day of my life. It‚Äôs already embraced all possibilities of failure. And my anxiety‚Äôs ruthless demands for perfection often turn my thoughts into an unrelenting roll-call of self-criticisms and insecurities.\n\nAnd yet ‚Äî Anxiety isn‚Äôt the villain of this movie.\n\nA cursory spin around social media reveals many other people who identified with that aspect of the film.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie and loved that they didn‚Äôt make Anxiety the villain. It would have been so easy to do so ‚Äî Hollywood has a habit of really dumbing things down, especially in movies aimed at kids. The filmmakers seemed to understand that anxiety is the flip-side of a coin that includes some mixture of watchfulness, anticipation, and exhilaration. That emotion can be useful to people, until it spins out of the control as in the movie and then it wreaks havoc.\n\nWallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl\n\nWallace & Gromit are returning for a feature-length film later this year ‚Äî and so is Feathers McGraw, the scofflaw penguin that made off with the wrong trousers in, um, The Wrong Trousers. Here‚Äôs the premise of Vengeance Most Fowl:\n\nIn this next installment, Gromit‚Äôs concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions proves justified, when Wallace invents a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù gnome that seems to develop a mind of its own. When it emerges that a vengeful figure from the past might be masterminding things, it falls to Gromit to battle sinister forces and save his master ‚Ä¶ or Wallace may never be able to invent again!\n\nTimely! Vengeance Most Fowl will debut on BBC in the UK in late December and at some later date on Netflix in the US and elsewhere.\n\nSeven Samurai‚Äôs 4K Restoration\n\nA 4K restoration of Akira Kurosawa‚Äôs epic Seven Samurai is heading to theaters this summer. The film screened at Cannes in May and screenings in the US start in July:\n\nJanus will open the restoration on Friday, July 5 in New York at Film Forum after which a Los Angeles premiere will take place at the American Cinematheque‚Äôs Egyptian Theatre on Sunday, July 7. The film will open wide on Friday, July 12 in Los Angeles at Laemmle Royal.\n\nHere‚Äôs the official poster for the restoration:\n\nOn a personal note, I‚Äôm pretty disheartened there‚Äôs a 99% chance this won‚Äôt be playing anywhere near me in Vermont. Run Lola Run was rereleased in theaters last week and I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere within a reasonable drive. And the nearest IMAX is 2h15m away. I‚Äôm thankful that I can get all sorts of culture pumped into my house at gigabit speeds, but per contemporary wisdom, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got Seven Samurai‚Äôs 4K restoration at home‚Äù is just not the same.\n\nAI Can Ruin Movies Now, Too\n\nYouTuber Nerrel takes James Cameron to task for releasing 4K remasters of Aliens and True Lies that have been, well, ruined by using AI to clean them up.\n\nThe best 4k releases tend to follow a pretty simple template: clean and scan the negative, repair any obvious signs of damage, and restore the colors to match the original grading, with as little meddling beyond that as possible. The process should not be about modernizing the style or forcing film to look like digital video. 35mm film was capable of incredible picture quality, and 4k is the first home format capable of delivering most of that detail ‚Äî that should be enough. A well done 4k is like having a pristine copy of the original negative to watch in your own home, with the full data from that celluloid ‚Äî grain and detail alike ‚Äî digitally preserved forever. And that‚Äôs the problem with deep learning algorithms ‚Äî they can‚Äôt preserve details. They make their best guess about what an object is supposed to be, then pull new details out of their digital assholes and smear them across the screen.\n\nIf Hollywood and one of its best directors don‚Äôt care enough about their movies to do them right, how are they supposed to convince us to care about their movies?\n\nThe Trailer for Black Barbie\n\nThe first Black Barbie doll was created and sold in 1980. Black Barbie, a documentary streaming on Netflix later this month, tells the story of how the doll came to be and the impact it had on a generation of young people who were able to see themselves in a doll with the same color skin, perhaps for the first time.\n\nThe trailer opens with this line: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve gone your whole life and you‚Äôve never seen anything made in your own image, there is damage done.‚Äù Which is then echoed later in the trailer when a little girl is describing her Barbie: ‚ÄúReally pretty, and has lochs, just like me‚Äù.\n\nShonda Rhimes produced the film and was recently on the Today show talking about the importance of representation. And here‚Äôs a tour of Sonya Larson‚Äôs collection of 1000+ Black Barbie dolls.\n\nBrats, a Documentary Film About the 80s Hollywood Brat Pack\n\nI was a little too young (and culturally sheltered ‚Äî like I‚Äôd never heard of New York magazine) in 1985 to really understand what the heck the Brat Pack was (not to mention what the name was referencing), but as a child of the 80s, I obviously grew up watching movies and TV shows that featured these actors. According to Wikipedia (which is a good read if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the whole thing), here are some of the actors that were in the Brat Pack (or Brat Pack-adjacent): Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Tom Cruise, Charlie Sheen, James Spader, Robert Downey Jr., John Cusack, and Matthew Broderick.\n\nThe Brat Pack moniker was coined in a 1985 New York magazine article and it stuck. And according to some of the members, it ruined lives, careers, and friendships. Now one of the group members, Andrew McCarthy, has directed a documentary about the group: Brats. From Deadline:\n\nBrats looks at the iconic films of the 1980s that shaped a generation and the narrative that took hold when their young stars were branded the ‚ÄúBrat Pack.‚Äù McCarthy reunites with his fellow Brat Packers ‚Äî friends, colleagues and former foes, including Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Jon Cryer, Lea Thompson and Timothy Hutton, many of whom he had not seen for over 30 years ‚Äî to answer the question: What did it mean to be part of the Brat Pack? The actor-filmmaker also sits down for a first-time conversation with writer David Blum, who fatefully coined the term Brat Pack in a 1985 New York Magazine cover story.\n\nThat trailer definitely hooked me in. Brats will be available on Hulu on June 13.\n\n‚ÄúPlanet of the Apes‚Äù Goes to a 70s Mall\n\nFrom Life magazine and photographer Ralph Crane, a gallery of outtakes from the filming of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes in 1972.\n\nThe Century City mall, selected for its futuristic appearance, was a primary battleground in the plot. LIFE staff photographer Ralph Crane came to the set and took pictures of the costumed actors in the mall, trying on shoes and making eyes at the lingerie store display, as well as eating in the mess hall with their masks half off. The pictures make for easy laughs, capturing the kind of shenanigans that help liven up a fourth Apes film in as many years.\n\n(via daniel benneworth‚Äìgray)\n\nA Documentary Film About Jim Henson\n\nTwo of my biggest childhood touchstones were Sesame Street and the Muppet Show. The creative spark behind both shows was Jim Henson, the subject of a forthcoming documentary directed by Ron Howard. From the press release:\n\nProduced with the full participation and cooperation of the Henson family, ‚ÄúJim Henson Idea Man‚Äù is an unprecedented, intimate look at Henson‚Äôs illustrious, revolutionary career and complex personal life. Using never-before-seen personal archival home movies, photographs, sketches, and Henson‚Äôs personal diaries, as well as interviews with those who knew him best, the film is the definitive portrait of one of the world‚Äôs most inspiring and iconoclastic creators.\n\nJim Henson Idea Man will be available to stream on Disney+ on Friday. (via the kid should see this)\n\nListening to Sand: The Sound Design of Dune\n\nFrom the SoundWorks Collection, this is a 30-minute featurette on the sound design of Dune, in which the film‚Äôs sound teams talks about how they created the sounds of the Arrakis desert, the sandworm, ornithopters, spice, and the voice of the Bene Gesserit.\n\nThat‚Äôs something which - I learned a trick from Lee Scratch Perry, who I worked with in Switzerland about 10 years ago. He‚Äôs the pioneer of dub reggae, which must be the genre of music with the most bass. And one of the tricks that he used was to record a bass line and then to play it back through a huge speaker in a room that‚Äôs resonant‚Ä¶and record that. So it enhances the resonance of the bass. You also hear something of the shaking of the room. So that was one of the tricks that we used to give a sort of a very tactile sense to this spiritual adventure that Paul‚Äôs going on.\n\nThere are several other videos on this topic should you desire to rabbit-hole: The Sounds of Dune, How The Sounds of Dune Were Made, Dune Sound Design Explained, Director Denis Villeneuve and Sound Team on Dune, and Dune: Part Two | Deeper into the Desert: The Sounds of the Dune:\n\nQueendom\n\nQueendom is a documentary film by Agniia Galdanova about queer Russian activist and performance artist Jenna Marvin and her unusual form of protest against the war in Ukraine and Russia‚Äôs treatment of LGBTQ+ people. From a short review in the Guardian:\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, some brave souls took to the streets of Moscow to voice their horror at the war, and were met with batons and police brutality. Radical queer performance artist Gena Marvin took a different approach. Wearing platform boots, body paint and wrapped in barbed wire, she walked the streets of Moscow in a stark, silent statement against the war. To call Gena a drag artist fails to capture just how subversive and courageous are her public ‚Äúperformances‚Äù. Her otherworldly costumes, created from junk and tape, show the influence of Leigh Bowery; her fearlessness evokes the punk provocation of Pussy Riot.\n\nMarvin‚Äôs performances can be intense ‚Äî check out this video from Paris in 2022. France had just advanced into the semifinals of the World Cup and she went out on the streets dressed in an all-black costume straight out of Alien or Pan‚Äôs Labyrinth:\n\nQueendom opens in theaters and will available on streaming on June 14.\n\nThe Trailer for Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs Megalopolis\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola has been making Megalopolis since 1983 and has self funded it ‚Äúin part by the sale of a significant portion of the director‚Äôs wine empire‚Äù. But the trailer is finally here and it premieres at Cannes in two days‚Äô time. Here‚Äôs a synopsis shared by Coppola himself:\n\nA man balances precariously on a ledge high above a once-grand city in the opening scene of Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs MEGALOPOLIS, and the movie that follows is ‚Äî at least in part ‚Äî about an entire civilization teetering on a similarly precarious ledge, devouring itself in a whirl of unchecked greed, self-absorption, and political propaganda, while a few bold dreamers push against the tide, striving to usher in a new dawn. The man is called Caesar (Adam Driver), like the Roman general who gave rise to the Roman Empire, Cesar the labor leader who organized California‚Äôs farm workers in the 1960s, and a few other notably great men of history. But he is also clearly an avatar of Coppola himself ‚Äî a grand visionary witnessing a once-great thing (call it cinema if you must) withering before his very eyes and determined to revivify it. And, after decades of planning, MEGALOPOLIS the movie is the powerful elixir he has produced: a sweeping, big-canvas movie of provocative ideas and relentless cinematic invention that belies its maker‚Äôs 84 years of age.\n\nCoppola seems to have been born-again by a strike of filmic lightning, and the movie ‚Äî no, the experience (complete with in-theater ‚Äúlive cinema‚Äù) ‚Äî that has emerged feels at once the work of a film-school wunderkind unbowed by notions of convention, but also the work of a wizened master who knows much about life and the ways of the world. To paraphrase Coppola himself speaking decades ago about his APOCALYPSE NOW, MEGALOPOLIS isn‚Äôt a movie about the end of the world as we know it, it is the end of the world as we know it. Only, where APOCALYPSE left us in a napalm-bombed fever-dream haze, MEGALOPOLIS, surprisingly and movingly, bestows on us a final image glowing with hope for the future.\n\nYou should also watch this clip of the film shared by Coppola, which reveals another aspect of the story:\n\nThis is either going to be amazing or a beautiful disaster, but either way I‚Äôm excited to see it‚Ä¶if they can find someone to distribute the film.\n\nThe Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed\n\nHere is a pleasantly painful trailer for a new movie from the filmmaker Joanna Arnow. It opens this Friday, April 26, at IFC and Lincoln Center in NYC. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going to watch it, but I couldn‚Äôt really look away.\n\nArnow also stars as‚Ä¶\n\nan emotionally detached young Brooklynite drifting through unremarkable days and nights. Neither her on-again-off-again BDSM relationship with a mildly disinterested older dom, nor her nondescript corporate job, appear to bring her any satisfaction.\n\nAnd yet ‚Äúshe finds a core of poignant truth about the ways people search for ‚Ä¶ emotional happiness and sexual gratification‚Äù (per the Lincoln Center summary). It‚Äôs currently at a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, FWIW. (This bit also made me laugh out loud.)\n\nPapyrus 2: A Bold New Look for Avatar\n\nRyan Gosling was on Saturday Night Live this weekend and they did a sequel to one of my favorite SNL sketches (which is completely dorky in a design nerd sort of way) ever: Papyrus. Behold, Papyrus 2:\n\nAvatar spawned worlds, right? Every little leaf of every little flower, every little eyelash of every little creature: thoroughly thought out. But the logo: it‚Äôs Papyrus, in bold. Nobody cares. Does James Cameron care? I don‚Äôt think so.\n\nTobey Maguire‚Äôs Non-CGI Tray Catch Scene in Spider-Man\n\nPeter Parker‚Äôs iconic tray catch scene from 2002‚Äôs Spider-Man took 156 takes, but it was done without CGI, which is nice.\n\nThe 15 Greatest Documentaries\n\nA thoughtful video essay from The Cinema Cartography about 15 of film‚Äôs greatest documentaries, including The Thin Blue Line, Grizzly Man, The Act of Killing, Shoah, Hoop Dreams, and OJ: Made in America (my personal favorite).\n\nI am not sure I agree with their #1 pick? But it‚Äôs been a loooong time since I saw it (in the theater when it came out, if you can believe it), so maybe it‚Äôs time for another viewing. (via open culture)\n\nDawn Baillie: The Art of the Movie Poster\n\nI love a good movie poster and Dawn Baillie designed one of the best ones ever: the iconic poster for The Silence of the Lambs. Her other work includes posters for Dirty Dancing, Little Miss Sunshine, Zoolander, The Truman Show, and The Royal Tenenbaums. A show of her work opens soon at Poster House in NYC. Some of Baillie‚Äôs original posters are for sale at Posteritati."
