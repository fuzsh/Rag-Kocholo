Another great find by the BCTHIC – thanks for forwarding on Anne

Lowerhouse CC professional Tony Benneworth (centre) with his Tasmanian colleague Clem Smith, are welcomed by Mr Scaife at the Bridge, Burnley.

The Lowerhouse CC professional Tony Benneworth arrived a day earlier than he and the club expected. A miscalculation on the part of the booking clerk in Tasmania failed to take into accurate account the travelling time from east to west. Consequently the West Ender’s popular young pro, who played at amateur last season, had to telephone Burnley and notify officials of his appearance in this country on Wednesday instead of Thursday. However, Lowerhouse moved immediately and with supreme organisation Mr J. Dawson collected Tony and his cricketing colleague Clem Smith and took them to their temporary headquarters at the Bridge Inn, Burnley. Here they were welcomed by licensee Mr P. Scaife, a cricket enthusiast who has signed amateur forms for the club.

Tony received a great welcome when he visited the West End on Thursday evening and a large attendance of players and officials waited to greet him. He was out at the nets with the players on Good Friday. Tony is regarded as Tasmania’s outstanding player and so keen is he to develop the game in his home state that he has refused to join clubs on the Australian mainland and press for Sheffield Shield honours. Benneworth is the first Tasmanian to play in Lancashire League cricket and so, first to sign as a professional. He will be giving his wholehearted best for the West Enders during the season which starts on April 28th.
