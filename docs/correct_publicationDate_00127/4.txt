Biography

Jonathan Lethem has been much hyped and fairly well praised. Any writer who is essentially a science fiction writer but who is not marketed as such obviously has something going for him. Lethem undoubtedly has a fascinating and weird imagination. Unfortunately, his writing skills leave much to be desired. His characters are wooden and uninteresting. His plots are unconvincing. Reading Lethem is rather like finding a very attractive sex partner but, when it comes to the clinch, you both leave each other very unsatisfied. Frankly, when reading Lethem, I had no desire to see what happened next, no interest in the characters. I just wanted it to be over so I could read a real book.

Perhaps it’s me. He has certainly been well promoted. Gun, with Occasional Music has been optioned for a film, though they seem to be taking their time about making it. He has clearly been influenced by the right authors – Philip K. Dick, J G Ballard, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut and co. He went to Bennington with Bret Easton Ellis/, Jill Eisenstadt, and Donna Tartt. But none of this makes for a great writer. He’s fashionable. He’s trendy. He will fade away.

Lethem was born in 1964 in Brooklyn, His father was a painter and his mother a political activist. He went to Bennington College but dropped out, hitchhiking around the United States and working in book shops, before becoming a successful writer. In 2011, he became Roy E. Disney Professor in Creative Writing at Pomona College, replacing David Foster Wallace.
