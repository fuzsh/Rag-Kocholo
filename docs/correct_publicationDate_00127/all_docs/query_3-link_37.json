        "text": "Jonathan Lethem (1964-) is an American novelist and essayist born in Brooklyn, New York. Lethem attended Bennington College in Vermont, worked as a book store clerk in California, and has written over ten novels and short story collections, in addition to numerous essays. His most well-known works are Motherless Brooklyn and Fortress of Solitude. Lethem received the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction in 1999 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 2005.\n\nCollections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections as they are acquired, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.\n\nThis collection received a basic level of processing, including rehousing and minimal organization.\n\nInformation included in the Description of Papers note and Collection Contents section is drawn from information supplied with the collection and from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles are supplied by staff during initial processing.\n\nThis finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description."
