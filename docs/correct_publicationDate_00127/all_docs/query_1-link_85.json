        "text": "College Literature, 2011\n\nBy David Coughlan\n\nJonathan Lethem’s long-evident interest in comics, for example in his 2003 novel The Fortress of Solitude, culminated in his 2008 reworking of Steve Gerber and Mary Skrenes’s 1976 comic book series from Marvel Comics, Omega: The Unknown. Demonstrating that Lethem’s self-conscious paraphrasing of the prior series is part of a sustained examination of repetitions and relations, this essay shows how the serial nature of comics enables Lethem to address themes of families, legacies, and communities, both in this comics work and in his earlier novel also. It will be argued that The Fortress of Solitude and Omega: The Unknown together read the repeating-but-differing images of the comic book in contrast with the repetitions of the franchised brand to present a sustained critique of capitalist cultures. In all of this, it will be seen, Lethem draws on the idioms and traits of comic books: colours, panels, word balloons, margins, gutters, lines....Read more\n\nRelated Papers\n\nThis paper aims at understanding the complex implications of Jonathan Lethem’s decision to write the story of a graphic novel, Omega the Unknown (2007), which resurrected a forgotten superhero from the Marvel universe, and re-told his origins. Lethem seems to have been attracted to the original Gerber & Skrenes series, published in the Mid-Seventies, because it contained some of his favourite themes in nuce: alienation, adolescence and its obsessions, street life in New York City, especially in a racially mixed neighbourhood, and a science-fictional context (Omega-Man comes from another planet and has to fight against androids). However, the Omega series also offered Lethem the opportunity to somewhat disassemble the figure of the superhero in its main components, that have been embodied in three characters of the graphic novel: the silent Omega-Man, as the real Hero; Titus-Alexander Island, a gifted but odd adolescent, as the Would-Be Hero, and Rex Kansur, aka the Mink, as the Bogus Hero or Anti-Hero. This allows Lethem to articulate an original interpretation of superheroes as American icons, well rooted in the national tradition but also tied to such a classical text as Shakespeare’s Hamlet.\n\nDownload\n\nThis review situates the book Considering Watchmen: Poetics, Property, Politics (2014) in the current debates about characteristics and production contexts of comic books.\n\nDownload\n\nPerhaps the most befuddling and widely debated point in comics scholarship lies at its very core, namely, the definition of “comics” itself. Most arguments on this issue focus on the roles of a few distinct features: images, text, sequentiality, and the ways in which they interact. However, there are many other aspects of this discussion that receive only passing notice, such as the industry that produces comics, the community that embraces them, the content which they represent, and the avenues in which they appear. The complex web of categorization that these issues create makes it no wonder that defining the very term “comics” becomes difficult and is persistently wrought with debate. This piece offers a dissection of the defining features that “comics” encompass, with aims to understand both what those features and the term “comics” really mean across both cultural and structural bounds.\n\nDownload\n\nStarting from the graphic novel Etenesh. L’odissea di una migrante [Etenesh. The odyssey of a migrant] by Paolo Castaldi (2011), the present contribution proposes to interpret the comic book as a ‘space of encounter’ between disparate subjectivities and as a ‘place of mediation’ between different cultural and geographical perspectives. The first part of the article aims to situate the analysis of Etenesh within the recent field of ‘comic book geographies’, paying particular attention to the encounter between comics, postcolonial, and geographical studies in the emerging debate around ‘postcolonial comics’. Furthermore, the graphic novel by Paolo Castaldi is proposed as an example of how comics could profitably enter contemporary ‘Italian postcolonial studies’. The second part will present the reasons why it is appropriate to embrace ‘interviews’ as methodological tools in postcolonial geographical research: on the one hand, I respond to the question about who is the interviewer, pre...\n\nDownload"
