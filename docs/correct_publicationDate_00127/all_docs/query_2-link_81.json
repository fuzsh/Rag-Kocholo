In his post-apocalyptic novel Amnesia Moon, he introduces a young man named Chaos who can seemingly remake reality in his dreams. Setting off on a grand adventure, Chaos attempts to learn the secrets behind the world's destruction. \"Lethem tempers a liberal dose of quirky surrealism with interesting, believable characterizations and a compelling, imaginative story line.\"-Booklist"
