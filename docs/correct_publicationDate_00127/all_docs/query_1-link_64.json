        "text": "You’ll find a lot of “hard” science fiction here – not much fluff.\n\nIsaac Asimov\n\nFrom his overwhelming output, I recommend novels from his Robot/Galactic Empire/Foundation universe. Best of all is the Foundation Trilogy, which received a special Hugo Award as the greatest all-time science fiction series:\n\nThe Foundation Trilogy\n\nFoundation (1951, ISBN 0553293354)\n\nFoundation And Empire (1952, ISBN 0553293370)\n\nSecond Foundation (1953, ISBN 0553293362)\n\nThere are several related novels from the Foundation/Galactic Empire universe listed below. Years after this trilogy, Asimov integrated the foundation universe with his “Robot” series. If you get hooked on this universe, there are also prequels and sequels of varying quality and age:\n\nPrequels to the Foundation Trilogy\n\nThe Robot Novels\n\nThe Caves of Steel (1953, ISBN 0553293400)\n\nThe Naked Sun (1957, ISBN 0553293397)\n\nThe Robots Of Dawn (1983, ISBN 0553299492)\n\nRobots And Empire (1985, ISBN 0345328949 or 0586062009)\n\nThe Galactic Empire Novels\n\nPebble In The Sky (1950, ISBN 0837604621)\n\nThe Stars, Like Dust (1951, ISBN 0449235955)\n\nThe Currents of Space (1952, ISBN 0553293419)\n\nFoundation Trilogy Prequels\n\nPrelude To Foundation (1988, ISBN 0553278398)\n\nForward The Foundation (1993, ISBN 0553565079)\n\nSequels to the Foundation Trilogy\n\nFoundation’s Edge (1982, ISBN 0553293389)\n\nFoundation And Earth (1986, ISBN 0586071105)\n\nGreg Bear\n\nThe librarian recommends almost anything Greg Bear has written, highlighting the following novels of exceptional quality:\n\nMoving Mars (1993, ISBN 0812524802)\n\nQueen Of Angels (1990, ISBN 0446361305) and Slant (1997, ISBN 0812524829)\n\nThe Forge Of God (1987, ISBN 0812524330) and Anvil Of Stars (1992, ISBN 0446364037)\n\nDarwin’s Radio (1999, ISBN 0-345-43524-9)\n\nGregory Benford\n\nBenford is a physicist whose works range in quality from fascinating to tedious. His Galactic Center series has an intriguing concept, but he totally exhausts it by the sixth book (reminiscent of Herbert’s overextension of the Dune saga). Instead, try these three novels:\n\nArtifact (1985, ISBN 0380791951)\n\nTimescape (1980, ISBN 0553297090)\n\nHeart Of The Comet (with David Brin; 1986, ISBN 0553258397)\n\nJedediah Berry\n\nA tour de force of world-building, atmosphere, humor, and characterization, Berry fully transported me into his world of somnambulism.\n\nThe Manual of Detection (2009, ISBN 0143116517)\n\nRay Bradbury\n\nNo one else writes with Bradbury’s lyricism and poignancy. He is the master of the short story, and there you will enjoy him best.\n\nFavorite Short Stories\n\nThere Will Come Soft Rains\n\nThe Veldt\n\nSkeleton\n\nCalling Mexico\n\nAll Summer In A Day\n\nFavorite Novels\n\nFahrenheit 451 (1953, ISBN 0345342968)\n\nThe Martian Chronicles (1946-1958, ISBN 0553278223)\n\nDavid Brin\n\nYou can’t go wrong reading anything by Brin, but the librarian is particularly fond of his Uplift novels, which are as much fun to read as Niven’s Known Space series.\n\nGlory Season (1993, ISBN 0553567675)\n\nEarth (1990, ISBN 055329024X)\n\nThe Uplift Novels\n\nSundiver (1980, ISBN 0553269828)\n\nThe Uplift War (1987, ISBN 0553279718)\n\nStartide Rising (1983, ISBN 055327418X)\n\nBrightness Reef (1995, Bantam, ISBN 0-553-57330-6)\n\nInfinity’s Shore (1996, Bantam, ISBN 0-553-57777-8)\n\nHeaven’s Reach (1998, Bantam, ISBN 0-553-57473-6)\n\nJohn Brunner\n\nWant a wild romp through a dystopia? John Brunner is definitely your man. Stand On Zanzibar is a classic you should not miss, and won the 1969 Hugo. If you like the book and want more, Jagged Orbit is for you. If you are not into dystopias, go for Total Eclipse.\n\nStand On Zanzibar (1968, ISBN 0837604389)\n\nJagged Orbit (1969, ISBN 0283980850)\n\nTotal Eclipse (1974, ISBN 0297770063)\n\nArthur C. Clarke\n\nThe father of hard science fiction, Clarke is probably best-known for 2001: A Space Odyssey and the memorable Childhood’s End. He was the first person to conceive of the communications satellite and has a much better track records at predictions than most. Clarke was justifiably famous for his non-fiction as well as his fiction, and I own almost every book Clarke ever authored. Here are the personal favorites:\n\nA Fall Of Moondust (1961, ISBN 9993559385 or 0575602902)\n\nThe Fountains Of Paradise (1978, ISBN 0446677949)\n\nRendezvous With Rama (1973, ISBN 0553287893)\n\nThere are three sequels to the Rama book. They were co-written with Gentry Lee, so they have a very different feel, but they do eventually solve all of Rama’s mysteries:\n\nRama II (1989, ISBN 0553286587)\n\nGarden of Rama (1991, ISBN 0553298178)\n\nRama Revealed (1994, ISBN 0553569473)\n\nThomas M. Disch – Criticism and Analysis\n\nThe Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of: How Science Fiction Conquered the World (1998, Free Press/Simon & Schuster, ISBN 0-684-82405-1)\n\nDisch was a respected author of sci-fi who offered a powerful, chatty, and quite readable look at how science fiction has evolved and meshed with our culture’s fabric with conspicuous weaves of politics, religion, and entertainment. He offered tough love for everyone, from conservatives ala Heinlein and Pournelle to liberals ala LeGuin to crazed ala Dick. The behind-the-scenes viewpoint from this sci-fi author is particularly compelling.\n\nRobert L. Forward\n\nAnother physicist, Forward’s story of life on a neutron star is great fun.\n\nDragon’s Egg (1980, ISBN 034543529X)\n\nThere is a sequel, Starquake (1985, ISBN 0345312325), but it is not as nifty.\n\nNeil Gaiman\n\nHere is where a bit of fantasy creeps into the list. Neil Gaiman’s work is fantastic in both senses of the word. Unforgettable characters and dark storylines (and quite funny black humor in the book with Terry Pratchett) make his work far more appealing than fantasy’s more typical riffs on Tolkien. If you want entertainment, start with Good Omens, but if you want to see Gaiman’s power, read American Gods.\n\nGood Omens (1990, ISBN 0441003257)\n\nAmerican Gods (2001, ISBN 0380789035)\n\nNeverwhere (1996-7, ISBN 0380789019)\n\nWilliam Gibson\n\nGibson is famous for his invention of “cyberspace” in Neuromancer (1984, ISBN 0441569595, Amazon), which began his series of cyberpunk novels and started a new genre in science fiction. I particularly like the ones listed below, with his near-future work of Pattern Recognition having some amazing prose.\n\nPattern Recognition (2003, ISBN 0425192938)\n\nVirtual Light (1993, ISBN 0553566067)\n\nThe Difference Engine (with Bruce Sterling, 1991, ISBN 055329461X)\n\nFrank Herbert\n\nHerbert’s Dune universe is fascinating and horrifying. He took it too far, but the first four of the six books are worth reading, with the fourth one my favorite for its outrageous, twisted humor:\n\nDune (1965, ISBN 0441172717)\n\nDune Messiah (1969, ISBN 0441172695)\n\nChildren Of Dune (1976, ISBN 0441104029)\n\nGod Emperor Of Dune (1981, ISBN 0441294677)\n\nHeretics of Dune (1984, ISBN 0441328008)\n\nChapterhouse: Dune (1985, ISBN 0441102670)\n\nMadeleine L’Engle\n\nThese haunting children’s books deal with good and evil. The first one is a classic and deservedly won the Newbery Award; the last one is the most complex of the three.\n\nA Wrinkle In Time (1962, ISBN 0440498058)\n\nA Wind In The Door (1973, ISBN 0440487617)\n\nA Swiftly Tilting Planet (1978, ISBN 0440401585)\n\nJonathan Lethem\n\nA newer voice in near-future science fiction. Lethem has a fertile imagination and loves to bring a sci-fi twist to literary themes, from detective noir to the western. His early books are short and great, a nice change from the heavy lifting of many recent sci-fi efforts. I’m not as fond of his longer, later works, nor his short stories.\n\nGun, with Occasional Music (1994, Tor [Tom Doherty Assoc.], ISBN 0-312-85878-7)\n\nAs She Climbed Across the Table (1997, Vintage [Random House], ISBN 0-375-70012-9)\n\nAmnesia Moon (1995, Tor [Tom Doherty Assoc.], ISBN 0-312-86220-2)\n\nGirl in Landscape (1998, Vintage [Random House], ISBN 0-375-70391-8)\n\nLarry Niven\n\nNiven is my favorite science fiction author, so this listing will be extensive. Niven’s universe-building is magnificent and he has some of the best aliens around. His “Known Space” series is immense fun, seeing how the different parts coalesce over a period of over a thousand years, with the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Ringworld a great place to start. Unfortunately, his work since 1990 suffered as he would sacrifice narrative for logistics and puzzles, but he rebounded with Ringworld’s Children and the Fleet of Worlds collaboration.\n\nKnown Space\n\nUnderlined titles shown with years of publication are novels. You can locate most of the various short stories in one of these collections: Neutron Star (1968, ISBN 0345336941), A Hole In Space (1974, ISBN 0345240111), Tales of Known Space (1975, ISBN 0345334698), N-Space (1990, ISBN 0812510011), Playground Of The Mind (1991, ISBN 0812516958). All of the Gil Hamilton stories have been collected in Flatlander (1995, ISBN 0345394801), while only the first three appear in The Long ARM of Gil Hamilton (1976, ISBN 0345248686). The Beowulf Shaeffer stories were all collected and linked together in Crashlander (1994, ISBN 0345381688).\n\nPresent – 2100\n\nThe Coldest Place\n\nBecalmed In Hell\n\nWait It Out\n\nEye Of An Octopus\n\nHow The Heroes Die\n\nThe Jigsaw Man\n\n2100-2300\n\nThe Gil Hamilton Stories\n\nDeath By Ecstasy\n\nThe Defenseless Dead\n\nARM\n\nPatchwork Girl\n\nThe Woman In Del Rey Crater\n\nWorld Of Ptavvs (1966, ISBN 0345345088)\n\nAt The Bottom Of A Hole\n\nIntent To Deceive\n\nCloak Of Anarchy\n\nProtector (1973, ISBN 0345353129)\n\nThe Adults\n\nVandervecken\n\n2400-2500\n\nA Gift From Earth (1968, ISBN 0345350510)\n\nThe Ethics Of Madness (erroneous dates are given)\n\n2600-2700\n\nThe Beowulf Shaeffer Stories\n\nNeutron Star\n\nAt The Core\n\nFlatlander\n\nThe Handicapped\n\nGrendel\n\nThe Borderland Of Sol\n\nProcrustes\n\nGhost\n\nA Relic Of Empire\n\nThe Soft Weapon\n\nFleet of Worlds with Edward M. Lerner (2007, ISBN 0765357836)\n\n2800-3100\n\nThere Is A Tide\n\nRingworld (1970, ISBN 0345333926)\n\nThe Ringworld Engineers (1980, ISBN 0345334302)\n\nThe Ringworld Throne (1996, ISBN 0345412966) (this novel is weaker than the first two in the trilogy)\n\nRingworld’s Children (2004, ISBN 0765341026)\n\nSafe At Any Speed\n\nDraco’s Tavern Stories\n\nStories set in a universe that centers on a certain bar…reminds one of Clarke’s White Hart stories. You’ll find these in the collections Convergent Series (1979, ISBN 9991661247), Limits (1985, ISBN 0345321421), and Playgrounds Of The Mind (1991, ISBN 0812516958).\n\nThe Schumann Computer\n\nAssimilating Our Culture, That’s What They’re Doing\n\nCruel And Unusual\n\nThe Subject Is Closed\n\nGrammar Lesson\n\nFolk Tale\n\nThe Green Marauder\n\nWar Movie\n\nThe Real Thing\n\nLimits\n\nTeleportation Stories\n\nThese stories explore the consequences of teleportation; their “displacement” booths also appear in the Known Space universe. You’ll find the first four stories in the collection A Hole In Space (1974, ISBN 0345240111) and the last one in The Flight Of The Horse (1973, ISBN 0345334183).\n\nThe Alibi Machine\n\nThe Last Days Of The Permanent Floating Riot Club\n\nA Kind Of Murder\n\nAll The Bridges Rusting\n\nFlash Crowd\n\nTime Travel Stories\n\nThe first six stories are the adventures of the blundering Svetz and his extension cage. The first five can be found in The Flight Of The Horse (1973, ISBN 0345334183), and more recently grouped with the novel-length sixth tale, Rainbow Mars. The last two are found in either All The Myriad Ways (1971, ISBN 0345334167) or N-Space (1990, ISBN 0812510011).\n\nThe Flight Of The Horse\n\nLeviathan!\n\nBird In The Hand\n\nThere’s A Wolf In My Time Machine\n\nDeath In A Cage\n\nRainbow Mars (1999, ISBN 0812566785)\n\nAll The Myriad Ways\n\nFor A Foggy Night\n\nRammers\n\nWhat links these very different tales together is the use of ram-jet technology. You’ll find the first two short stories in A Hole In Space (1974, ISBN 0345240111) and All The Myriad Ways (1971, ISBN 0345334167), respectively. The first novel is a personal favorite out of Niven’s work.\n\nRammer\n\nPasserby\n\nA World Out Of Time (1976, ISBN 0345336968)\n\nThe Integral Trees (1983, ISBN 0345320654) and The Smoke Ring (1987, ISBN 0345302575)\n\nMagic Stories\n\nHere are magic-fantasy tales with the Niven twist. You’ll find them spread around in The Flight Of The Horse (1973, ISBN 0345334183) as well as Playgrounds Of The Mind (1991, ISBN 0812516958) and a collection in The Time Of The Warlock (1984, ISBN 0916595021).\n\nWhat Good Is A Glass Dagger?\n\nThe Flying Sorcerers (with David Gerrold, 1971, ISBN 0345334973)\n\nThe Magic Goes Away (1978, ISBN 0441515444)\n\nNot Long Before The End\n\nUnfinished Story #1\n\nTalisman (with Dian Girard)\n\nThe Lion In His Attic\n\nNotable Collaborations\n\nNiven’s long collaboration with Jerry Pournelle has produced some worthy novels, although Pournelle brings out right-wing philosophies, similar to those Heinlein espoused late in life. Niven’s Dream Park novels with Steven Barnes offer little, and the testoterone-drenched Heorot books with Pournelle and Barnes wears very thin. Below are some recommended highlights of Niven/Pournelle:\n\nThe Mote In God’s Eye (1974, ISBN 0671741926) and The Gripping Hand (1993, ISBN 0671795740)\n\nLucifer’s Hammer (1977, ISBN 0449208133)\n\nOath Of Fealty (1981, ISBN 0671532278)\n\nFootfall (1985, ISBN 0345323440)\n\nDavid Pringle – Science Fiction Encylopedia\n\nThe Ultimate Encyclopedia of Science Fiction: The Definitive Illustrated Guide (1996, JG Press/World, ISBN 1-57215-212-5)\n\nPringle, the editor and publisher of the monthly Interzone sci-fi rag offers a very tasty and filling overview of the genre, complete with many appreciated photos. The history, movies, television, authors, characters, and magazines all receive full treatment with polished text and superb visuals.\n\nAlastair Reynolds\n\nReynolds is busy constructing a wonderful environment of extremely advanced future nanotech, complete with plagues. Interesting characters and plot extensions retain your interest after you’ve discovered much of his construct.\n\nRevelation Space Universe\n\nThe Prefect (2007, ISBN 0441017223)\n\nTakes place in the Glitter Band era, at the height of civilization before The Plague.\n\nChasm City (2001, ISBN 0441010644)\n\n“Set slightly earlier than the main action in the first book of the Inhibitors Trilogy, this is a “noirish revenge thriller set in the aftermath of a nanotech-engendered plague.”\n\nThe Inhibitors Trilogy:\n\nRevelation Space (2000, ISBN 0441009425)\n\n“A dark-tinged space opera set five hundred years from now, in a universe in which intelligent life is puzzingly rare.”\n\nRedemption Ark (2002, ISBN 044101173X)\n\n“A loose sequel to Revelation Space, set about 50 years later. The hero of the book is the war veteran Clavain, who has already appeared in a couple of short stories.”\n\nAbsolution Gap (2003-4, ISBN 0411011586)\n\n“The third and final part of the loose sequence of books dealing specifically with the Inhibitor threat.”\n\nDiamond Dogs, Turquoise Days (2003, ISBN 0575075163)\n\n“Diamond Dogs and Turquoise Days are two independent novellas set against the same background as the other books. The first concerns a murderous alien structure, while the second concerns life on an aquatic world dominated by semi-sentient alien lifeforms.”\n\nCentury Rain (2004, ISBN 0411012906)\n\n“Much less of a hard-SF book than the others. It does have some space travel in it, but it is also about alternate history and the possibility of time travel. Much of the book is set in two versions of Paris: one in a future recognisably derived from our present, and one in a past that is not quite the one in the history books…[Century Rain] has elements of noir and the hardboiled crime novel”\n\nPushing Ice (2004, ISBN 0441015026)\n\nA tale, independent of the other books, which has a great shift of scale to grand space opera.\n\nHouse of Suns (2008, ISBN 0575082372)\n\nAnother independent tale of grand scale with a touching climax.\n\nCharles Sheffield\n\nSheffield’s work is reminescent of both Clarke and Niven and offered a nice contrast to the cyberpunk genre. He usually focused on the future development of the solar system and had very memorable characters.\n\nTomorrow and Tomorrow (1996, ISBN 0553578898)\n\nThe Mind Pool (1993, ISBN 0671721658)\n\nCold As Ice (1992, ISBN 0812511638) and The Ganymede Club (1995, ISBN 0812544609)\n\nThe Spheres of Heaven (2001, ISBN 067131856)\n\nThe Web Between The Worlds (1979, ISBN 0345344359)\n\nMy Brother’s Keeper (1982, ISBN 0441551343)\n\nBetween the Strokes of Night (1985, ISBN 067155977X)\n\nThe Proteus Stories – Sheffield explores a future where humans can physically transform themselves with biofeedback. These works are uneven but interesting.\n\nSight Of Proteus (1978, ISBN 0345344332) and Proteus Unbound (1988, ISBN 0345344340) (available as Proteus Combined, 1994, ISBN 0671876031)\n\nProteus In The Underworld (1995, ISBN 0671876597)\n\nThe Heritage Universe – Sheffield develops a universe populated by mysterious Artifacts. Fun characters, but somewhat like Clarke’s Rama stories, some mysteries are best left unsolved.\n\nSummertide (1990, ISBN 0345369378)\n\nDivergence (1991, ISBN 0345369386)\n\nTranscendence (1992, ISBN 0345369815)\n\nConvergence (1997, ISBN 0671877747)\n\nDan Simmons\n\nSimmons takes you on an epic adventure in his four Hyperion books. They have great characters and an intricate plot that blends religious imagery, some fake hard science, and a bit of fantasy into one magnificent space opera. If you know Chaucer, which I don’t, you’ll likely enjoy it all the more. The first two books could stand alone, but you wouldn’t want to miss out on the rest of the story. Like Asimov, Simmons stumbles a bit making it all work, but his series hangs together better than Herbert’s Dune saga.\n\nHyperion (1989, Bantam/Doubleday, ISBN 0-553-28368-5)\n\nThe Fall of Hyperion (1990, Bantam/Doubleday, ISBN 0-553-28820-2)\n\nEndymion (1995, Bantam/Doubleday, ISBN 0-553-57294-6, Amazon)\n\nThe Rise of Endymion (1997, Bantam/Doubleday, ISBN 0-553-57298-9)\n\nNeal Stephenson\n\nStephenson has taken the cyberpunk genre pioneered by Gibson and Sterling to an entirely new level. His Diamond Age is smashing good fun, and Silicon Valley finds the vision of virtual reality presented in Snow Crash “insanely great”.\n\nThe Diamond Age or, A Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer (1995, ISBN 0553573314; the hardback is more readable than the paperback)\n\nSnow Crash (1992, ISBN 0553562614)\n\nBruce Sterling\n\nSterling is one of the best cyberpunk writers. He also has some very interesting short stories.\n\nDistraction (1998, Bantam/Random House, ISBN 0-553-57639-9)\n\nHoly Fire (1996, ISBN 055357549X)\n\nIslands In The Net (1988, ISBN 0441374239)\n\nHeavy Weather (1994, ISBN 055357292X)\n\nThe Difference Engine (with William Gibson, 1991, ISBN 055329461X)\n\nSchismatrix (1985, ISBN 0441003702)\n\nVernor Vinge\n\nVinge is a creative writer who can build a universe. His physics in the Realtime work is questionable, but it is fun and reminds one of Niven and Pournelle’s war stories. The “Deep” books are tales of creatively imagined aliens on a single planet, embedded in a space opera with a sweeping scale of space and time. Vinge’s limited output has racked up one Hugo nomination after another.\n\nA Fire Upon The Deep (1992, ISBN 0812515285)\n\nA Deepness in the Sky (1999, ISBN 0812536355)\n\nAcross Realtime (1991, ISBN 0671720988) – a collection of the novel The Peace War of 1984, the novella “The Ungoverned” of 1985, and the novel Marooned in Realtime of 1986\n\nConnie Willis\n\nWillis has racked up numerous Hugo and Nebula awards with her outstanding characters and clever plots.\n\nTo Say Nothing Of The Dog (1998, Bantam, ISBN 0553575384)"
