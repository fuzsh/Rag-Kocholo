        "text": "Last issue, as tradition demanded, we presented our annual Editor's choice list, The Best SF and Fantasy Books of 1998, as selected by over 40 editors, writers, and freelancers of the SF Site. As usual we invited you to comment, critique, and -- up until the day our choices were announced -- submit your own selections for the best of the last 12 months. And this year, for the first time, we received more than enough votes to generate a truly significant sampling of the general reading populace -- enough, in fact, to warrant separate Reader's Choice Awards. And so here we are.\n\nA Reader's Choice Awards, as intriguing and popular feature as it is, isn't without its own set of problems [note to Editor: next year we computerize the whole process. No more hand counting -- I don't care how many pizzas you buy.] The biggest one, of course, is the issue of ballot stuffing. And yes, there was ballot stuffing... all too tempting a process in this day of multiple e-mail accounts and continent-wide chat groups, I'm afraid. Eliminating multiple notes from a single e-mail address isn't enough to prevent it (not nearly enough) -- you have to check X-sender IDs, do routing traces, and have Ralph the lapdog sniff incoming ballots for familiar scents.\n\nStill, the bulk of the ballot stuffing was easy to spot -- ridiculously easy, in fact. While genuine votes from readers generally arrived with a list of 8-10 books, invariably with some idle chatter and \"P.S. Where does Stephen King get his ideas??\" tacked at the end, yer basic mass produced ballot-stuffer was limited to something like \"I vote for The Clowns of Booger -- it rocked!!\" In the end, a few simple rules helped cut out the vast majority of the ballot stuffing -- including eliminating all those notes which cast votes for a single book. [That last rule alone disqualified over 50 messages, affecting the voting totals of a grand total of two books. Like we said: in large part, obvious.]\n\nBut, just as the \"Best SF and Fantasy Books of 1998\" list did in our last issue, this list had its share of surprises and treasures. As much effort as these kinds of Awards are to do right, the rewards for the diligent compiler are considerable. Internet SF & Fantasy readers have diverse and eclectic taste, there's no doubt about it. But you also have a nose for the rare find, and everyone who worked on this list -- no matter how widely read we thought we were -- walked away with a discovery or two (or ten) that made all the work worthwhile. The fact that the voting was open to virtually all books published in 1998, reprints included, also opened the door to a few surprises as well. Many of the superb books we were led to didn't make the Top Ten list you're about to read... but we'll make sure you know about many of them in the issues to some, and that's a promise.\n\nEnough of the preliminaries. On to the Awards - presented in reverse order this time. Enjoy.\n\n[Editor's Note: Where possible, links lead to SF Site reviews of the books. You can find links to other Best of the Year columns here.]\n\nTop Ten Original Works of 1998\n\nSmoke & Mirrors - Neil Gaiman\n\nThe Death of the Necromancer - Martha Wells\n\nTo Say Nothing of the Dog - Connie Willis\n\nGirl in Landscape - Jonathan Lethem\n\nSong For the Basilisk - Patricia A. McKillip\n\nThe Best of Crank! - edited by Bryan Cholfin\n\nFine Prey - Scott Westerfeld\n\nNewton's Cannon - J. Gregory Keyes\n\nChild of the River - Paul J. McAuley\n\nDeepdrive - Alexander Jablokov\n\nBag of Bones - Stephen King & Bloom - Wil McCarthy (tie)\n\nOriginals versus Reprints\n\nThere's been no shortage of controversy surrounding our decision to allow readers to vote for the very best genre books they read in 1998 -- including reprints and foreign titles. As long as it was published in 1998 and in English, it qualified. But while it's one thing to see a neglected classic from yesteryear find new favour with today's audience, it's quite another to see your deserving original novel get barely edged out by the paperback version of a work that was heaped with awards last year. Enough already old-timer, it's time to give up the mike and let a fresh act take the stage.\n\nWe can see both sides of this argument. And to make sure none of the fine original work that deserved to make the list gets overlooked, we're providing two distinct supplemental lists -- the Top Ten original titles of 1998 according to our readers (at right), and also the Ten Best reprints (below). That's two Top Ten lists for one price -- don't let anyone tell you the SF Site isn't the biggest value on the Web.\n\nThe Runners-Up\n\nWe've said it before -- more than once -- but it probably bears repeating. Trust the average Top Ten list about as far as you can throw it -- ours included. We don't seriously believe that the finest work of 1998 can be encapsulated with a list of ten titles, no matter how many voters you have, nor how carefully selected your criteria are. We do these lists for three simple reasons: they're fun, they're popular, and we can't think of a better way to publicize work of real quality from the last 12 months. If the above lists have brought even one title to your attention that you might have otherwise overlooked, then we've accomplished our goal.\n\nWhich means that, as long as we're hogging the microphone, there's nothing to stop us from rolling out those books which damn near made the list. By far the most popular title just shy of the list was new author Scott Westerfeld's novel Fine Prey (Ace, paperback, August), the extremely impressive sequel to his debut novel Polymorph. Next was perpetual bridesmaid Newton's Cannon by J. Gregory Keyes (Del Rey, trade paperback, May), the first volume in the The Age of Unreason, which was also in neck-and-neck competition for a position on the Editor's Choice list as well.\n\nIn a near tie for next place are two fine examples of true science fiction: occasional SF Site reviewer Paul J. McAuley's Child of the River (Avon/Eos, hardcover, May), the first book of Confluence, and Alexander Jablokov's standalone novel Deepdrive (Avon/Eos, hardcover, August) -- both part of the superb Avon/Eos line, and both beneficiaries of Avon's introductory hardcover series, which offered excellent original work in hardcover at unbeatable prices ($14 each, or $19 in Canada).\n\nTop Ten Reprints of 1998\n\nNeverwhere - Neil Gaiman\n\nSlant - Greg Bear\n\nThe Rise of Endymion - Dan Simmons\n\nForever Peace - Joe Haldeman\n\nCorrupting Dr. Nice - John Kessel\n\nRibofunk - Paul Di Filippo\n\nA Game of Thrones - George R.R. Martin\n\nJack Faust - Michael Swanwick\n\nFreeware - Rudy Rucker\n\nGreenmantle - Charles de Lint\n\nJohn Kessel's unique vision of time travel and bizarre character study, Corrupting Dr. Nice (Tor, reprint, trade paperback, February) made its own unique impression on readers, and shouldered its way into the next position on the list with its high-quality reprint edition. Next was a novel that needs no introduction: Bag of Bones by Stephen King (Scribner, hardcover, September), considered by many of his fans as his best effort in years.\n\nTied with Stephen King was a breakout novel by Wil McCarthy -- his first hardcover release, and a novel that generated an enormous buzz in the industry when it landed on shelves in the fall: Bloom (Del Rey, hardcover, September). A disturbing and fully-realized vision of a far-future Earth occupied by a sentient micro-organism, it was an edge-of-your seat thriller of the sort that's rare in any genre.\n\nNeil Gaiman crowded on to the list again in the next slot, with his latest novel Stardust (Avon/Eos, hardcover, December) which is technically a February 1999 release. And close at its heels was Earth Made of Glass by John Barnes (Tor, hardcover, April) an SF novel set in the universe of his early favourite, A Million Open Doors.\n\nThe last entry in our runner's-up list was a surprise -- albeit a very pleasant one. The small press is rarely well represented on popular lists such as this one, for obvious reasons: small print runs, even smaller marketing budgets, and often subject matter that is far off the commercial track. But occasionally a small press publication will strike a chord, and word of mouth will do what glossy advertising cannot -- and a deserving work with a limited press run will attract a vocal group of fans. Such is the case with Beyond the Wall of Sleep, the first book by Avon/Eos publicist Andy Heidel (Mortco, hardcover, August). A collection of previously unpublished short stories and poems, this is a book that was shared by many here in the SF Site offices, and deserves a wider audience.\n\nAnd until next year, good reading -- and good web surfing."
