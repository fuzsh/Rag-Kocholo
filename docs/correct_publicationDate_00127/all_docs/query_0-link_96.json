        "text": "Biography\n\nJonathan Lethem has been much hyped and fairly well praised. Any writer who is essentially a science fiction writer but who is not marketed as such obviously has something going for him. Lethem undoubtedly has a fascinating and weird imagination. Unfortunately, his writing skills leave much to be desired. His characters are wooden and uninteresting. His plots are unconvincing. Reading Lethem is rather like finding a very attractive sex partner but, when it comes to the clinch, you both leave each other very unsatisfied. Frankly, when reading Lethem, I had no desire to see what happened next, no interest in the characters. I just wanted it to be over so I could read a real book.\n\nPerhaps it’s me. He has certainly been well promoted. Gun, with Occasional Music has been optioned for a film, though they seem to be taking their time about making it. He has clearly been influenced by the right authors – Philip K. Dick, J G Ballard, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut and co. He went to Bennington with Bret Easton Ellis/, Jill Eisenstadt, and Donna Tartt. But none of this makes for a great writer. He’s fashionable. He’s trendy. He will fade away.\n\nLethem was born in 1964 in Brooklyn, His father was a painter and his mother a political activist. He went to Bennington College but dropped out, hitchhiking around the United States and working in book shops, before becoming a successful writer. In 2011, he became Roy E. Disney Professor in Creative Writing at Pomona College, replacing David Foster Wallace.\n\nOther websites\n\nHis homepage\n\nJonathan Lethem\n\nJonathan Lethem\n\nOverrated Writers, Part Four: Cormac McCarthy and Jonathan Lethem\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nInterview\n\nThe ecstasy of influence: A plagiarism (article by Lethem)\n\nBibliography\n\n1994 Gun, with Occasional Music (novel)\n\n1995 Amnesia Moon (novel)\n\n1997 The Wall of the Sky, the Wall of the Eye (stories)\n\n1997 As She Climbed Across the Table (novel)\n\n1998 Girl in Landscape (novel)\n\n1999 Motherless Brooklyn (novel)\n\n1999 Kafka Americana (with Carter Scholz) (stories)\n\n2003 The Fortress of Solitude (novel)\n\n2004 Men and Cartoons (stories)\n\n2005 The Disappointment Artist (non-fiction)\n\n2006 Believeniks!: 2005: The Year We Wrote a Book About the Mets (with Christopher Sorrentinom, as Ivan Felt and Harris Conklin) (novel)\n\n2006 How We Got Insipid (stories)\n\n2007 You Don’t Love Me Yet (novel)\n\n2009 Chronic City (novel)\n\n2010 They Live (non-fiction)\n\n2011 The Ecstasy of Influence: Nonfictions, Etc.\n\n2012 Talking Heads’ Fear of Music\n\n2013 Dissident Gardens (novel)\n\n2015 Lucky Alan And Other Stories (stories)\n\n2016 A Gambler’s Anatomy (novel)\n\n2017 The Blot (novel)\n\n2017 More Alive and Less Lonely : On Books and Writers (literature)\n\n2018 The Feral Detective (novel)\n\n2020 The Arrest (novel)\n\n2021 The Arrest (novel)\n\n2023 Brooklyn Crime Nove (novel)"
