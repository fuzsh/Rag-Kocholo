        "text": "What does the Neanderthal genome have to with post-apocalyptic science fiction? It may seem like odd inspiration, but Neanderthals have aroused my interest in one of the most venerable genres of science fiction. Last summer I was awaiting the release of The Road movie, reading a piece of classic post-nuclear sci-fi (John Wyndham's 1955 The Chrysalids), and thinking about some recent news stories on the (then) forthcoming Neanderthal genome sequence.\n\nI was struck by the thought that the last Neanderthals lived in what could be thought of as a post-apocalyptic world. They were going extinct. Did they notice? What kind of world did the last survivors live in?\n\nIt's doubtful that Neanderthals had any concept of extinction, of course, at least on a continent-wide or global scale. Yet you can imagine that there may have been some sense that something had gone terribly wrong, perhaps a recognition of an unyielding process that was squeezing them out, that the world was taking a new direction without them. Extinction was gradual, taking place over generations, and therefore most likely difficult to recognize.\n\nThey were living in a post-apocalyptic world. Nature had turned against them. They were being threatened by alien invaders with new, powerful weapons. Perhaps the Neanderthals were doing each other in, resorting to cannibalism and inter-tribal violence in their desperation. Did their society begin to crumble as their numbers dwindled, or as previously predictable rhythms of nature shifted? Were there lost traditions, passed-on legends of long-gone better days? With a little imagination, it's easy to think of the Neanderthals in a classic, end of the world sci-fi context. What is it like to be a member of a self-aware, intelligent species that is dying away? What is it like to be the very last living members of that species?\n\nMy somewhat unmoored speculation has driven me to immerse myself in post-apocalyptic science fiction. This project is not only fun, but also an interesting study of fictional takes on science. Post-apocalyptic fiction obviously isn't only (or even primarily) about science, but it is an excellent form in which to explore questions about the role of science as a mediator between humans and nature.\n\nScience is remarkable because it is an extremely successful method for understanding and controlling nature by intellectual effort. Neanderthals, and their modern human neighbors, lived in close proximity to nature, and were engaged in a constant battle for survival. Most of us encounter the struggle for survival remotely, listening to the unflappable British voice of David Attenborough as we watch kangaroo rats, lions, elephant seals, and wildebeest relentlessly pursuing food and mates in a world where small, careless errors and weaknesses are punished with casual brutality. Neanderthals and other early humans lived in that world.\n\nScience and technology have proven the most effective means to \"turn the tide\" in our battle with nature (as Aldous Huxley put it, with some bitterness, in his post-nuclear novel, Ape and Essence). Science is a mediator between humans and nature. This mediating role rests on the ability science gives us to predict, control and manipulate nature. Even science done out of pure curiosity is based on control: in order to obtain scientific knowledge, we manipulate nature by doing experiments. The prime test of our scientific theories is how predictive they are, how well they enable us to manipulate nature with predictable results. From a scientific perspective, is impossible to understand nature without controlling it.\n\nPost-apocalyptic science fiction describes situations in which our ability to predict and control fails catastrophically. Nature escapes our control, through world-wide plagues, collisions with asteroids, or invasions by alien species; or else we're done in by our own efforts at control, by nuclear war or human-induced ecological catastrophe.\n\nThus End of the World science fiction is a fine setting for fiction writers to explore the relationship between science and society. To what extent does civilization depend on the ability to control nature, i.e., depend on technology? How do our relationships with each other depend on the security of scientific control? Are there dark (animal?) elements of human nature, kept normally under wraps by civilization, that surface when science fails and civilization cracks up? In other words, how much does being human depend on how we relate to nature? What are the negative side-effects of our scientific quest to render nature tame and predictable? Have we deluded ourselves into believing we have more control than we really possess? Extinction is what happens when a species loses the battle for survival, and the Neanderthals lost. Is it possible that we could lose as well?\n\nIntentionally or not, most post-apocalyptic sci-fi touches on these themes to some degree, and so, to commemorate both the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome and the release of The Road, I'm going to embark on a post-apocalyptic sci-fi project: The road to The Road, 60 years of End of the World fiction.\n\nInspired by this excellent series of blog posts on 50 years of Hugo awards, I'm going to blog about one End of the World novel for each year from 1947 to 2006. 60 years, 60 novels. Why 60? There are excellent apocalypse novels in the first half of the 20th century (like these and these), but after 1947, there are enough choices out there in this genre to make it feasible to choose one book for each year.\n\nAnd now for the inevitable genre definition: my criteria for inclusion are shaped by my Neanderthal speculations. I'm interested in books that deal with the possible extinction of humanity, or a large portion thereof - whether by alien invasion, ecological ruin, plague, nuclear war, or some other destructive force. I'm including pre- and post-apocalypse scenarios. Books about post-catastrophe survival, or civilization coming unraveled in the face of an overwhelming threat are in, books about stable dystopias (such as 1984) are not. A holocaust that occurred deep in the past doesn't count if it's merely a setting for fantasy novel - the end of civilization, even hundreds of years in the past, has to be central to the book. The threat of extinction however isn't absolutely necessary; a destabilizing interaction with other intelligent life forms also works (as in Philip Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?). Generally, I'm also sticking to stand-alone novels, although it should be noted that some excellent post-apocalyptic series exist.\n\nAnd so, below is my proposed chronological curriculum for 60 years of End of the World Sci-Fi, based on when a work was first published in book form. I've listed the books I propose to read, and, in some years, other great books worth checking out. Availability may be a problem for some of these books, and so I'm still looking for suggestions for books first published in 1970, 1979, 1981.\n\nI'm drawing a complete blank for the year 2000 (it can't be possible that no good End of the World sci-fi was published in Y2K!!).\n\nI could also use some alternate suggestions for 1996, 1998, 2001, 2002, and 2005.\n\nInevitably, this is primarily a list of works in English. I'm not familiar with recent post-apocalyptic works in other languages, but I'm open to suggestions. I have no idea whether post-apocalyptic novels are most popular in English, or if I've just missed a huge literature outside of the US and the UK. The Russians seem to have a fairly strong post-apocalyptic tradition, but I'm only familiar with a handful of Russian sci-fi books.\n\nRead along, comment about a different book for a given year, and offer your insights into these books about the apocalyptic future.\n\n1947 - Greener Than You Think, Ward Moore\n\n1948 - Ape and Essence, Aldous Huxley\n\n1949 - Earth Abides, George Stewart\n\n1950 - Genus Homo, L.
