        "text": "DATE September 30, 2003 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/A\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nInterview: Jonathan Lethem discusses his new semiautobiographical\n\nnovel \"The Fortress of Solitude\"\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nMy guest Jonathan Lethem won a National Book Critics Circle Award for his\n\nnovel \"Motherless Brooklyn.\" Now Lethem has a new novel called \"The Fortress\n\nof Solitude\" that's based on his own experiences growing up in Brooklyn. The\n\nnovel revolves around two best friends, Dylan Ebdus and Mingus Rude, who live\n\nin a largely African-American neighborhood in Brooklyn. When the novel begins\n\nin the '70s, Dylan is one of the few white students in his grade school. His\n\nmother is a hippie; his father is a painter. Mingus is the son of a soul\n\nsinger who used to be in a popular vocal group. The novel begins in the '70s,\n\nends in the '90s and follows the neighborhood through the changes of hip-hop,\n\ncrack and gentrification, and follows the two main characters' diverging paths\n\nas Dylan goes to a predominantly white college in Vermont and Mingus goes to\n\nprison. Reviewing the novel in The New York Times Sunday Book Review, A.O.\n\nScott described it as `melancholy and marvelous.'\n\nYour new book really confronts the issue of race and what it's like to grow up\n\nas a white child in a largely African-American neighborhood. Race is a very\n\ndifficult subject to write about. Was it hard for you to take it on?\n\nMr. JONATHAN LETHEM (Author, \"The Fortress of Solitude\"): Well, I avoided it\n\nfor years. I wrote a whole series of novels that dealt with questions of\n\ndifference and alienation very indirectly. So of course it was intimidating.\n\nAnd then in the doing, I was constantly afraid that I'd wander into\n\npontificating or sociology or trying to do something I'm not good at, and I\n\njust kept reminding myself that I wanted to make it very much an intimate\n\nreport, kind of a testimony from one body's experience moving through time\n\nbut not try to speak for anyone.\n\nGROSS: Now this is a semiautobiographical novel, and you're writing from the\n\npoint of view of a white kid who's growing up in an African-American\n\nneighborhood. That calls into question what it means to be a majority group\n\nor a minority group, because the white kid is, after all, the member of the\n\nmajority group, the theoretically more powerful group, but in his neighborhood\n\nhe's the minority group and he's the kid who's picked on a lot.\n\nMr. LETHEM: Right.\n\nGROSS: So it's a very kind of confusing territory to be in.\n\nMr. LETHEM: It's sort of a double reverse. And yet all of the, you know,\n\nwider context in American society was sort of present, I think, on those\n\nstreets where I grew up. And I've given Dylan the burden of those\n\nexperiences. The fact that a white kid had different kind of escape routes,\n\ndifferent ways to move out of those streets and those very immediate and\n\nconfusing racial conflicts that one moves through, that was never out of\n\nanyone's mind, the fact that I was sort of free to export myself to college\n\nand to an America where the white majority was, of course, the rule, wasn't\n\nlost on anyone.\n\nGROSS: Now the parents in the novel have chosen to live in this neighborhood\n\nbecause--well, first of all, they don't have much money, and also as a kind of\n\nbadge of their social consciousness. The father is an artist; the mother sees\n\nherself as a social activist. What were your parents' motivations for living\n\nin the neighborhood you lived in? And you should describe that neighborhood.\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, you know, I grew up in a neighborhood that's now called\n\nBoerum Hill, and just before that it was either a nameless place or it was\n\nSouth Brooklyn or Gowanus; it was kind of a zone between the more upright and\n\nalready gentrified or middle-class neighborhoods of Brooklyn, like Park Slope\n\nand Brooklyn Heights. And the neighborhood was really a patchwork. It wasn't\n\nonly black by any means. It was black and Hispanic and hippie and sort of\n\nother--there were legacies of Native Americans living in the neighborhood\n\nbecause, for whatever reason, the Native Americans who built the skyscrapers\n\nhad settled in Boerum Hill.\n\nAnd my parents were attracted to it, I think, in a very beautiful and, you\n\nknow, hopeful way. My mother grew up in Queens and felt like a Brooklyn\n\nstreet kid herself. My father was a painter looking for a home big enough to\n\ninclude a studio, and this was a place where you could buy a town house for\n\nkind of nothing. And the contradictions of a coming gentrification and the\n\nway that would compromise their own political ideals was something that was\n\nhard to anticipate.\n\nGROSS: Now the mother in your novel boasts that her son is one of only three\n\nwhite children in the whole school, the elementary school. Did your mother\n\nhave that attitude, too, and are there things you thought she didn't\n\nunderstand about what it meant to be one of the very few white kids in the\n\nelementary school?\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, that's a good question. She was proud that we were in\n\npublic school when a lot of the other white kids in the neighborhood were\n\nbeing exported to local private schools. But she wasn't nearly as scattershot\n\nor flighty as the character Rachel in the book. My mother was pretty savvy\n\nabout street life and a great guide to the neighborhood. She actually really\n\nknew the way things were playing out on the streets and in the schools. She\n\nwas sick; she died when I was 14, and she was sick for a few years before\n\nthat. So her kind of savvy and her know-how was unfortunately taken away.\n\nGROSS: Did you stay in the neighborhood after she died? I think your parents\n\nwere separated by then.\n\nMr. LETHEM: We lived in the neighborhood and my father continued to live in\n\nthe neighborhood until just a few years ago, and I'm actually back there\n\nmyself. Of course, it's a neighborhood that's become very, very fashionable\n\nnow; it's one of the nicest parts of New York City to live in, I think.\n\nGROSS: Is that bizarre for you to experience?\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, it's wonderful. I mean, the simplest thing to say is it's\n\na nice place for me as it would be for anyone, and if I weren't from Boerum\n\nHill, I very well might have ended up living there again or living there for\n\nthe first time now because it's attractive. And I see it with a kind of\n\ndouble vision. I see the old stuff which is still incompletely renovated.\n\nYou know, the thing about Brooklyn that I think sets it apart from Manhattan\n\nis that it never renovates completely; the past is always sort of lying around\n\nin chunks in full view if you want to see it. And as much as it's changed and\n\nas much as obviously property values have skyrocketed, there are lots of kids\n\nI grew up with living in the houses that their parents owned. There are lots\n\nof parts of Smith Street and Court Street that are still deeply, you know,\n\ndeep ethnic enclaves of Dominicans or Puerto Ricans or Italians. And it\n\ndoesn't feel to me that it's ever going to change completely.\n\nGROSS: Kids are always bullying kids, and that's just the way the world\n\nworks, I guess. But when you were bullied in the neighborhood, you were\n\ngrowing up, did race come into play into that bullying?\n\nMr. LETHEM: Oh, absolutely. I mean, the search for me in trying to write\n\nthis book was to give name to something, an experience that I'd had and never\n\nbeen able to talk about, because it fell kind of between the names I was\n\noffered. You know, when I first left New York, I was asked a question people\n\nwho grew up in New York, especially in the '70s, are asked constantly, which\n\nis: Have you ever been mugged? And I wouldn't know what to say. It seems so\n\nsimple, but I knew what they had in mind was a kind of, you know, \"Kojak\" or\n\nBatman scenario where a guy with a handkerchief on his face, you know, pulls a\n\ngun out and makes two well-dressed New Yorkers step into an alley and, you\n\nknow, says, `Your money or your life.' And that hadn't happened to me,\n\ncertainly.\n\nBut what had happened to me wasn't only bullying, it wasn't only typical\n\nschool yard stuff, that there was an undercurrent of, you know, racial hazing\n\nin the kind of experience that I've had that was--well, it was systematic, but\n\nit was also inconsistent; the experience changed a lot, and it was very\n\nslippery and hard to talk about. In fact, its unnameability was almost its\n\nprimary quality. You were told at the time, `This isn't anything. You know,\n\nI'm taking your money, but I'm your friend. You know I like you. What, do\n\nyou think I'm not your friend? Are you a racist?' And the kind of\n\nundercurrent of, I guess, rehearsals of racial identity was everywhere in this\n\nexperience. I knew I was meant to understand that I was a white boy and that\n\nthat entitled me to certain privileges, but it also meant that, you know, I\n\nwas going to pay a kind of toll of my bus pass or whatever pocket money I had\n\nwith me pretty much every day I went to school, and that I wasn't going to get\n\nto talk about it because to do so would be to seem to be a racist.\n\nGROSS: You did give a name to this.\n\nMr. LETHEM: Yeah, yoking. You know, it's a funny story. I took that word\n\nfor local vernacular. I really thought when the kids in my neighborhood would\n\nsay, `Throw a yoke on him,' or, you know, `You got yoked,' that it was\n\nsomething so specific to the '70s and to Brooklyn and to the black and\n\nHispanic kids. And I suppose slang always seems a lot more recent than it\n\nreally is. But it turns out yoking is kind of--it goes back to, like,\n\n18th-century English slang. It's a synonym for mugging, having to do with\n\nspecifically kind of an arm thrown around a neck, a headlock. And it was\n\nreally liberating to me when I discovered that the word had some provenance,\n\nthat it wasn't just my own sort of personal nightmare.\n\nGROSS: And why is yoking better than mugging?\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, yoking was, as I say, this intermediate activity. It\n\nwasn't real crime. It wasn't totally hostile. It had a conversational\n\nquality. It was, in a weird way, a kind of act of community-making. I was\n\nyoked by a lot of guys I knew, and I was often hanging out with them shortly\n\nthereafter. Or, you know, I was yoked by the older brothers of kids I was\n\nhanging out with. It was a transaction. And I ended up feeling that it was\n\nkind of a rehearsal.\n\nGROSS: Were you able to talk to your mother about this?\n\nMr. LETHEM: Barely, barely. I mean, it took me years to talk even to friends\n\nwho'd gone through it with me in school. It was something that was unnameable\n\nin full view. My brother and my good friends were part of this experience,\n\ntoo, and it was something that we were so ashamed of that we'd erase it almost\n\ninstantly; we'd erase it walking home from school before we got a chance to\n\ntalk to our parents about it.\n\nGROSS: There's another white boy who moves into the neighborhood, but your\n\nmain character doesn't want to deal with him because his character is weak and\n\nit gives off the sense of being oppressed. And your main character describes\n\nthis kid as practicing pre-emptive suffering. `Nobody could do much with a\n\nkid who was already crying. He didn't have a spirit to crush.' Was that your\n\nobservation of other kids when you were growing up?\n\nMr. LETHEM: Actually, that's as much confession as it is an observation.\n\nWhen I started to kind of research this book, which was really in some ways\n\nlike the first research I've--the first scholarship I've ever done in my life.\n\nI was a college dropout and I'd never learned to study, but I sort of had to\n\nwrite a dissertation on my own childhood to just, you know, find out what\n\nsongs were playing on the radio when I was doing this. But I also was going\n\nback and digging up old friends. And I thought I remembered a lot about this\n\nstuff, and I did remember a lot about this stuff, but there was one blind\n\nspot; there was one thing I hadn't really allowed myself to acknowledge, which\n\nwas my own utter cowardice. I mean, the degree to which I bailed out on other\n\nkids who were in threatening situations and saved my own skin, and the degree\n\nto which I kind of cringed and keened on the ground just begging not to be\n\nhurt. And I had a couple of friends lead me very patiently and gently to the\n\nmemory of how I would fall down before I was even hit, and that's an image\n\nthat is kind of pathetic but also funny, and I gave it to Arthur Lom(ph).\n\nHe's kind of the guy who figures out that strategy.\n\nGROSS: So I take it you weren't a real physical kid. You were probably\n\nreading a lot.\n\nMr. LETHEM: No, well, I was raised as a Quaker, so I wasn't allowed to hit\n\nanyone.\n\nGROSS: Oh, great.\n\nMr. LETHEM: This was basic, basic principle. I was a pacifist. I was meant\n\nto be solving these problems with, you know, non-violent resistance, and I\n\nguess that's what that consisted of.\n\nGROSS: Did that seem unfair to you that you were supposed to be non-violent?\n\nYou were from this non-violent background...\n\nMr. LETHEM: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...but on the other hand, in a neighborhood where power and dignity\n\nand self-respect were probably measured by your ability to physically stand up\n\nfor yourself.\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, there were such a variety--I hope the book shows the kind\n\nof enormous palette of approaches that kids in this neighborhood took. And\n\nyou know, I really have gathered so many--into these characters, these small\n\nnumber of rather isolated characters, I've gathered the testimony and the\n\nmemory and the impression of lots and lots of different responses and\n\nstrategies. I mean, Arthur, the kid who starts as the cringer and the one who\n\npretends to have asthma in order not to get hit, ends up as this ultimate\n\nassimilator, a kid who passes as though he's black himself. He's kind of an\n\nearly version of, you know, like, the Beastie Boys archetype. And the\n\nstrategies and the responses change day to day. It's why it was always so\n\ndifficult to talk about, because it was a kind of transitive experience.\n\nProblems were being worked out in this arena, in a way, and no strategy could\n\never be stable. So falling down, cringing, that was one moment in my\n\nexperience, but talking your way out of things or making friends with people\n\nor turning situations on their ear--you know, I tried to get all of the\n\npossible responses into the book, not just the most humiliating ones.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Jonathan Lethem. His new novel is called \"The Fortress of\n\nSolitude.\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Jonathan Lethem. His new novel is called \"The Fortress of\n\nSolitude.\"\n\nFor the main character growing up in this novel, everything seems to have some\n\nkind of, like, racial subtext, and certainly the music does. And there's a\n\ngreat paragraph I want you to read about a record that kind of strikes terror\n\ninto the heart of your main character, Dylan.\n\nMr. LETHEM: Right.\n\nGROSS: Should we say what the record is before you read it, or...\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, it sort of emerges, so either way.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. No, let's let it emerge.\n\nMr. LETHEM: OK.\n\n(Reading) `It was entirely possible that one song could destroy your life.\n\nYes, musical doom could fall on a lone human form and crush it like a bug.\n\nThe song, that song, was sent from somewhere else to find you, to pick the\n\nscab of your whole existence. The song was your personal crappy fate manifest\n\nas a throb of pop floating out of radios everywhere. At the very least, the\n\nsong was the soundtrack to your destruction, the theme. Your days, reduced to\n\na montage, cut to its cowbell beat, inexorable double bass line and raunch\n\nvocal, a sort of chanted sneer, surrounded by groans of pleasure, the stutter\n\nand blurt of--What?--a tuba? French horn? Rhythm guitar and trumpet pitched\n\nto mockery. The singer might as well have held a gun to your head. How could\n\nit have been allowed to happen? How could it have been allowed on the radio?\n\nThat song ought to be illegal. It wasn't racist--you'll never sort that one\n\nout; don't even start--so much as anti-you. \"Yes, they were dancing and\n\nmoving to the groovin', and just when it hit me, somebody turned around and\n\nshouted...\" Every time your sneakers met the street the end of that summer,\n\nsomebody was hurling it at your head, that song. Forget what happens when you\n\nstart haunting the green-tiled halls of Intermediate School 293(ph).\n\n`September 7th, 1976, the week Dylan Ebdus began seventh grade in the main\n\nbuilding on Court Street and Butler, Wild Cherry's \"Play That Funky Music\"\n\nwas the top song on the rhythm and blues charts. Fourteen days later, it\n\ntopped Billboard's pop charts. Your misery's anthem, number-one song in the\n\nnation. Sing it through gritted teeth: \"White boy, lay down the boogie and\n\nplay that funky music till you die.\"'\n\nGROSS: And for anyone who doesn't know the record, you know, it's `Play that\n\nfunky music, white boy.'\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, I later found out--my copy editor discovered that `white\n\nboy' isn't in the title; it stops at \"Play That Funky Music.\" So...\n\nGROSS: But it's in the song.\n\nMr. LETHEM: It's in the song.\n\nGROSS: So now later on, your character becomes a music critic.\n\nMr. LETHEM: Right.\n\nGROSS: And it's only later on in life that he realizes that the band that did\n\n\"Play That Funky Music\"--`white boy'--was actually a white band.\n\nMr. LETHEM: Those are white guys who inflicted that on him, yep.\n\nGROSS: So what's the difference to him whether it's a black group or a white\n\ngroup? How does the meaning change in his mind?\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, Dylan, this character, is--he's so--he reads race and\n\nculture and music so intensely to try to discover what's wrong with the way he\n\nfeels about himself. And he's tormented by these ironies, these kinds of\n\ndouble reverses. You know, `I come from a family of right-thinking leftists,\n\nand yet I'm constantly accused of racism just for being beaten up in school.'\n\nHe's tormented by the ironies of his own freedom to escape this situation by\n\nhanging out with other white kids and leaving the neighborhood, including his\n\ndear black friends, behind. And he's completely tormented by the musical\n\nironies, that the things he loves the most, the things that seem to tell him\n\nhow he feels about himself, don't match his apparent, you know, cultural\n\nportfolio. And then, of course, the fact that this song that he kind of\n\nadores and loathes for pinning him to his place in time and culture, for\n\nbeing--you know, he's like the white boy in the crosshairs of this song, the\n\nfact that it was a bunch of, you know, spaced-out Midwestern--you know, a bar\n\nband, basically, that created this black-sounding hit, it drives him, you\n\nknow, absolutely crazy. These guys know nothing of black experience as far\n\nas he can tell.\n\nGROSS: Did this record mean anything to you when you were growing up?\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, sure. I mean, it was sort of the bane of my existence, but\n\nit also--it's kind of irresistible. You know, you could only laugh at\n\nyourself for having it trapped in your head, because it was being sort of\n\nturned against you. But it was the thing that exposed you; it made you naked\n\nthat this song was on the radio at this time in your life and that the phrase\n\n`white boy,' which was already beginning to dog your steps, was suddenly OK;\n\nit was in the cultural vocabulary; it was the number-one song on the radio.\n\nGROSS: Jonathan Lethem is the author of the new novel \"The Fortress of\n\nSolitude.\" He'll be back in the second half of the show.\n\nI'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Play That Funky Music\")\n\nWILD CHERRY: (Singing) Yeah, they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the\n\ngroovin'. And just when it hit me, somebody turned around and shouted, `Play\n\nthat funky music, white boy. Play that funky music right. Play that funky\n\nmusic, white boy. Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die.\n\nHeh, till you die. Yeah...\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: Coming up, actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. She starred in the film\n\n\"Secretary\" and acted with her brother Jake Gyllenhaal in \"Donnie Darko.\"\n\nShe's one of the stars in John Sayles' new film \"Casa de los Babys.\" And we\n\ncontinue our conversation with novelist Jonathan Lethem.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Jonathan Lethem. His\n\nnovel \"Motherless Brooklyn\" won a National Book Critics Circle Award. His new\n\nnovel, \"The Fortress of Solitude,\" is based on his own experiences growing up\n\nin Brooklyn, where he was one of the few white people in his school. The\n\nnovel follows the characters and the neighborhood from the '70s through the\n\n'90s, through the eras of hip-hop, crack and gentrification.\n\nYou know, as you pointed out, the people in your life kind of related to their\n\nworld through culture, whether it was, you know, graffiti or music or, you\n\nknow, painting. And your father is a painter; Dylan's father in the novel is\n\na painter as well. But the father in the novel is also--instead of painting\n\non canvases, he's doing this experimental painting on film so his images can\n\nhave motion. And the father takes the son to a talk by Stan Brakhage, the\n\nfamous experimental filmmaker, and Brakhage is saying things like, `I would\n\nrather see my work as an attempt to clear aesthetic areas, to free film from\n\nprevious arts and ideologies, perhaps to leave it clear to be of use to men\n\nand women of various kinds which might help evolve human sensibility.' I'm\n\nwondering if your father had that kind of more abstracted, intellectualized\n\napproach to art and what that meant to you, for you. You know, 'cause Dylan\n\nin the novel is kind of fascinated by this, and he's hanging on every word,\n\nbut he doesn't understand a word of it.\n\nMr. LETHEM: Yeah. Actually, my father's own painting is much more messy and\n\nengaged than anything I've given to this father character in the book.\n\nAbraham's film is a kind of superpurified and--he's a very hermetic artist,\n\nand his practice is very isolated and monklike. It's actually--in some ways,\n\nAbraham's a confession of my own work as a writer. That painted film and this\n\nincremental progress day by day is really a description of a writer working on\n\na long novel. It's a self-portrait. My father's painting was, and his life\n\nas an artist, was much more ground-level. He was really engaged with the\n\nneighborhood, and his work is very colorful and full of content and full of\n\npolitics, and his studio was always full of live models, many of them just\n\npeople from the neighborhood. And he was very engaged. So Abraham's hermetic\n\nstyle is kind of an exaggeration of, you know, the response to living in a\n\nconfusing place that I flirted with, which was to just pretend you didn't know\n\nanything about it.\n\nGROSS: Right. In writing about race in your new novel, were you afraid at\n\nany point that you would be misunderstood? Because it's such a loaded\n\nsubject, and people are always reading between the lines to see what is your\n\nmotivation, what are you really saying. So were you afraid that you'd be\n\nmisunderstood...\n\nMr. LETHEM: Of course.\n\nGROSS: ...and that you might come off as sounding racist in spite of the fact\n\nthat that's certainly not your intention?\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, of course. And I mean, I had to embrace that fear. You\n\nknow, I wasn't trying to write a very short, simple book that could be\n\npurified of ambivalence or confusion. There's a lot of stuff in it that\n\nprobably kind of is racist in its way. Back and forth--you know, there are\n\ncharacters who are racist. And it's an embrace of my own experience, and I\n\nwanted to keep it kind of scrupulously intimate and, as I said at the start,\n\nmake it like a testimony of one person, one body in time, not preach or\n\npontificate or pretend to have figured things out that our culture hasn't\n\nfigured out. But the fear was with me all the way through, of course.\n\nGROSS: When you were growing up, you know, your mother was a social activist,\n\nyour father a painter. You've also described your mother as a hippie. And\n\nyou know, people who are in the arts or people who were hippies, bohemians,\n\noften see themselves as being, like, outside of class, as like the bohemian\n\nclass sometimes outside of, you know, working class, middle class, upper\n\nclass; at least that's how they're sometimes perceived by the larger culture,\n\nand that's how they sometimes perceive themselves. As a child of that type of\n\nfamily, did you feel outside of social class, or did you feel a part of it,\n\nand where did you think you fit?\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, I absolutely had a kind of beautiful, a blissful confusion\n\nabout class that came from the vitality of my parents' bohemian milieu. Their\n\nworld was so full of life and art and energy that I never thought to wonder\n\nwhether we were deprived of something. It didn't make any sense to think of\n\nmyself as being from a poor family, despite, you know, what in retrospect\n\nmight have been kind of whopping clues like the fact that I did go to public\n\nschool instead of private school. And it was more possible to sustain that\n\nblissful confusion that surrounded my family. I didn't understand that there\n\nwas real privilege. I did understand that the kids living in the projects\n\ndown the street, you know, had less than we did. So if anything, I thought we\n\nwere probably rich. But I didn't think about it very coherently.\n\nGROSS: Now you went to public school, and your parents are very proud of that\n\nfact that you were in public school. What kind of education do you think you\n\ngot in the public school in your neighborhood?\n\nMr. LETHEM: Well, you know, the experience changed again and again. I was\n\npulled out of my grade school, my local grade school. The one that I leave\n\nDylan in, I actually left behind to go to kind of cross neighborhoods into\n\nCarroll Gardens, which was a mostly Italian neighborhood. So suddenly I was\n\namong a lot of other white kids who nonetheless saw me as another kind of\n\noutsider or freak. But strictly speaking, the education there was\n\nmagnificent. I had the best teacher in my life in fourth grade, a woman named\n\nCarmen Farina who I dedicated my first novel to, and she was as in love with\n\nbooks, well, and talking and culture and life as my parents were. And so\n\nsuddenly school was very alive for me.\n\nAnd that happened again when I got to high school. I went to Music and Art,\n\nwhich is this great public school and, you know, it's a kind of legendary\n\npublic school in New York with a legacy of, you know, all sorts of funny,\n\nfamous people who went there. And I was part of this great tradition there,\n\nagain, one that was sort of classless and very Utopian. So I was lucky. I\n\nmean, New York City has vestiges of, you know, the greatest public education\n\nsystem ever constructed, I suspect, and I was in and out of really exciting\n\nschools, actually.\n\nGROSS: Jonathan Lethem, thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nMr. LETHEM: Thanks for having me.\n\nGROSS: Jonathan Lethem's new novel is called \"The Fortress of Solitude.\"\n\nComing up, actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Maggie Gyllenhaal discusses her latest film, \"Casa de\n\nlos Babys,\" and other films she has acted in\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nMy guest Maggie Gyllenhaal starred in the popular independent film\n\n\"Secretary.\" She played a withdrawn young woman who is awakened by a\n\nsadomasochistic relationship with her boss. In the movie \"Donnie Darko,\" she\n\nplayed the sister of a troubled young man who was portrayed by Gyllenhaal's\n\nreal brother, Jake Gyllenhaal. Now she's one of the stars of the new John\n\nSayles film \"Casa de los Babys.\" She plays the youngest of a group of women\n\nwho have gone to an unnamed Latin American country to adopt babies, and\n\nthey're growing impatient of waiting. The ensemble cast includes Marcia Gay\n\nHarden, Mary Steenburgen, Lili Taylor and Daryl Hannah. The actresses stayed\n\nat a hotel during the early phase of the film, but then they moved into a\n\nhouse together for the duration. Gyllenhaal told me that she thinks she and\n\nthe other actresses were unconsciously behaving a bit like their characters.\n\nMs. MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL (Actor): You know, the person I play in the movie, I\n\nthink, is not comfortable in her brain, which is not to say that she's not\n\nsmart; I mean, I think she's as smart as I am because otherwise, I mean, I\n\njust don't think you can play someone who's not as smart as you are. I don't\n\nthink that's a possibility. But she doesn't feel confident and comfortable in\n\nher brain. And it's really hard to be down there that way with all of these\n\nactresses who I really respected, who I think, you know, all of them are\n\nreally interesting. And I was unusually quiet and unusually unprotected, I\n\nthink. And I think that each actress had an experience like that in their own\n\nway.\n\nGROSS: Well, you made this John Sayles movie right before you made\n\n\"Secretary,\" so even though the movie's coming out after \"Secretary,\" it was\n\nfilmed the other way around.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: It wasn't, actually. I made \"Secretary,\" and it came out\n\nabout a month after I finished filming the John Sayles movie.\n\nGROSS: Well, you must have felt like all these actresses didn't know what you\n\nhad really just done.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Yeah, I did. I did, kind of. But Mary Steenburgen actually\n\nI knew a little bit, and she had seen me do some theater, and she was really\n\nsupportive of it and great. Yeah, but I did. I kind of felt like, `I'm an\n\nactress, too.' You know what I mean? Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's talk a little bit about \"Secretary.\" And, you know, in\n\nthis movie, for our listeners who haven't seen it, your character is a young\n\nwoman who's just come out of a psychiatric hospital. She's a cutter; she cuts\n\nherself. And she obviously has no confidence in herself. She's miserable at\n\nhome. She takes a secretarial job with this really strange lawyer, played by\n\nJames Spader. And after a while, when he criticizes her typing, in addition\n\nto the verbal criticism, he spanks her, and she actually likes it, and they\n\ndevelop this sadomasochistic relationship that is very fulfilling for each of\n\nthem. And they even get married at the end, and it ends up being quite\n\nromantic. What was your interpretation of this character?\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: My interpretation has shifted a lot, actually. I mean, at\n\nthe moment I think it's a really political movie. John Sayles' movie also is\n\nvery political, you know...\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: ...\"Casa de los Babys.\" And \"Secretary,\" I think, seems like\n\nit's more of a, you know, really, really dark romantic comedy, and it is. But\n\nthe more I think about it, I think it's the most radical movie that I've made,\n\nor really the most radical thing I've done in my life so far.\n\nGROSS: So what's your political interpretation of your character?\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Well, I think it's a complicated thing to make a movie about\n\nsomebody who is opened up and moved and, I think, woken up by playing the\n\nsubmissive in an S&M relationship, because I think it makes you question what\n\nis OK politically. Is it OK that this woman is opened up and moved by this?\n\nWell, if she is, then it has to be OK on some level. And you know, I think\n\nit's also in a lot of ways about moving through a kind of old-school feminism,\n\nI guess, is what I've been calling it lately, which I think is something that\n\nI'm resting everything I have on. You know, I mean, my grandmother on my\n\nmother's side was a doctor, and my mother's a screenwriter, and I feel like\n\nI'm coming from a really privileged place to be able to question some of this\n\nold-school feminism, you know, where I think there were rules set up to\n\nprotect women against all sorts of inequality. You know, you can't act this\n\nway; you can't say this; you have to pay a woman this.\n\nGROSS: And a certain kind of sexuality is demeaning.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Yeah, and a certain kind of behavior in the workplace is\n\ndemeaning and, you know, just don't cross these lines, because if you cross\n\nthem, we'll fall off this very tenuous line we're walking. I guess I feel\n\nlike those rules--which have been really helpful, I mean, unbelievably\n\nhelpful, and I don't at all take for granted--if they're not questioned, can\n\nstart to feel just as oppressive as what they were trying to protect us from.\n\nGROSS: In preparation for the role, did you read any of the, you know, like,\n\nbad-girl feminist literature? 'Cause there's a whole, like, library of\n\nfeminist literature about the pleasures of dark sexual relationships like S&M\n\nrelationships.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Well...\n\nGROSS: I mean, there's a whole kind of a body of, like, theoretical works\n\nabout that.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Yeah, yeah. You know, I think Mary Gaitskill, who wrote\n\nthat...\n\nGROSS: She'd kind of be part of that, right, yeah.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: She would totally be part of that.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: \"Secretary\" is actually the mildest, I think, of her bad-girl\n\nliterature. You know what I mean? In the book, the story, \"Secretary,\" it's\n\nabout a girl who--I mean, it's very short; it's like five pages long. It's\n\nabout a girl who gets a job in a lawyer's office. He ultimately spanks her\n\nand she feels degraded and strange and somewhat turned on by feeling degraded\n\nand strange and doesn't know how to order it I think is really more what the\n\nstory says. And the movie says not sh--I don't think I feel degraded and\n\nstrange. I know I didn't feel degraded and strange, you know. I felt\n\ncomplicated things and I think that's what's interesting about it, is that\n\nthere are dark things as well as light things in the sex and the love that\n\nthey have in that movie. But I think it's mostly opening and moving.\n\nGROSS: Obviously, you have this kind of interesting and complicated analysis\n\nthat takes into account feminism, you know, analysis of the film and of your\n\ncharacter. Some of the people who see the movie probably just see it as,\n\n`Hey, it's a cool movie about sadomasochistic sex,' you know...\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...and aren't kind of operating on that level. I wonder if you've\n\ngotten feedback from any of them and whether that more like superficial and in\n\nsome instance maybe even crass interpretation, how that affects you\n\npersonally. Because it's not only, like, your acting that's on the line here,\n\nit's your body because there's, you know, a nude scene and so on and so, you\n\nknow, what's it like to not be interpreted on the level that you are operating\n\non?\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: I think it is scary to me in some ways. I think it's so\n\nscary to me how the movie could be interpreted, how my body could be\n\ninterpreted that I have put up a really strong defense against feeling that\n\nfear, to be honest. You know, I did an interview awhile ago and this guy who\n\nwas interviewing me said, `Yeah, you know, I watched \"Secretary\" and--in the\n\nmovie theater and then I came home and a friend of mine said, \"Oh, here, here\n\nI've got a tape of it. Let's just fast forward to the sexy parts.\"' And I\n\ndidn't feel anything when he said it. I mean, I didn't like, you know, giggle\n\nand say that's fine or something, I just sort of shut it out completely and\n\nwent on with the 10-minute interview I had to do with him. And afterwards, I\n\njust took a breath and felt that. And I was--I mean, I think that such a sort\n\nof strange, awful thing for him to have said to me, I almost couldn't take it\n\nin at the moment that he said it. And when I did take it in--I mean, it's a\n\nlevel of having my body and my mind be out of my control that it's hard to\n\nfathom.\n\nGROSS: Right. Right.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: At the same time, though, you know, I feel like it's kind of\n\nworth it. And I thought about it. I thought, you know, yeah, I've had some\n\nweird responses to having been naked in \"Secretary.\" I think that I really\n\nclearly chose to be naked to say something that I think was important and\n\nworth saying. I don't know if I'll continue to feel that way as I get older\n\nand continue to do this.\n\nGROSS: Well, just--like, another thing about \"Secretary,\" in preparation for\n\nthe role in addition to, you know, like, reading what you read, did you also,\n\nlike, read just, like, straight out S&M pornography or rent, you know,\n\nstraight out S&M videos...\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...just to get a sense of, like, that world, that culture?\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Well, I started out reading some S&M pornography and also\n\nsome S&M, like, theory stuff. You know who I really liked from that is Robert\n\nCoover, who wrote this book, \"Spanking the Maid.\" It was really interesting.\n\nHe's a novelist.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, oh, he's, like, a real, like, literary guy. He's...\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Yeah, he's a real literary guy, yeah, yeah. But I did. I\n\nstarted out reading that stuff and I was totally unmoved by it. I mean, I\n\njust wasn't moved by it. And actually the stuff that I was reading, and maybe\n\nit wasn't the best stuff and I probably could have done better research and\n\nfound better stuff, was, you know, stuff like this unnamed person likes to do\n\nthis sexy, kinky thing. And, you know, it all felt really `other' and exotic\n\nand, you know, different from me somehow, very separate from me, and it wasn't\n\nhelping me. And then I got this porno which was, at first, I felt the same\n\nway about it. I felt like, you know, it's these two women and was really\n\nintense S&M stuff. This girl was really being sort of beaten up by this other\n\nwoman. And at first I felt like this is not helping me. This is making me\n\nfeel like this is so far from my sense of sexuality and my sense of love; at\n\nfirst, I thought that. And then this porno, I mean, I've never seen a porno\n\nwhere they done this before. They zoomed in on the woman who was being hurt.\n\nThey zoomed in on her face, and I was just looking at her face and it was\n\nundeniable that she was overwhelmed with feeling. And I think that--I mean,\n\nI've never seen a porno where I felt like anyone was feeling anything really\n\nreal.\n\nGROSS: Was the real feeling pain?\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Well, you know, it's hard to distinguish. It was an\n\noverwhelming feeling of something. And, you know, if, you know, in the movie,\n\nin \"Secretary,\" Lee, the character I play, is so dead in the beginning of the\n\nmovie, I think she's sleepwalking. And she's kind of OK to do that 'cause\n\nshe's seeing no other option. I think it takes something undeniable, like\n\nphysical pain, to wake her up.\n\nGROSS: Well, she's been afflicting it on herself. She's been a cutter up\n\nuntil...\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: I know, and ta...\n\nGROSS: ...the point where she gets involved in the relationship, yeah.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: I think it's sort of different. I think the cutting stuff\n\nis--you know, there's a lot of pain in her life, which I think, you know,\n\nthere's the stuff about her parents fighting and her dad's a drunk and, you\n\nknow, beat her mom up and stuff like that. And I think that's what causes,\n\nyou know, in the movie anyway, a lot of the cutting stuff. But I think, you\n\nknow, her family is just uninterested in dealing with it. Her mother's, like,\n\nhappy, great. You know, in the script, her mother used to offer her candy\n\nanytime anything would go wrong. So I think, you know, she has no way of\n\nordering this really complicated, real human emotional pain that she's dealing\n\nwith. So she puts it into a little cut and, you know, gets to sort of keep it\n\nall in one physical place and watch it heal, whereas, I think the S&M stuff in\n\nthe movie is more about exploding feeling into her body and then I think\n\nultimately her mind and her heart. And I can't tell you why those two\n\ndifferent kinds of pain work in such different ways, but they do.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Maggie Gyllenhaal. She played the title role in the film,\n\n\"Secretary.\" Now she's one of the stars of John Sayles' new film \"Casa de los\n\nBabys.\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: Maggie Gyllenhaal is my guest and she starred in the film \"Secretary.\"\n\nShe's now co-starring in the John Sayles' film \"Casa de los Babys.\"\n\nI'd like to talk a little bit about your family. Your mother, Naomi Foner, is\n\na screenwriter. Your father, Stephen Gyllenhaal, is a director. Your\n\nbrother, Jake Gyllenhaal, is like you, a new star. So when you were growing\n\nup, did you have--like overhearing your parents' conversations and then\n\nhearing what they told you about movies...\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: ...did this sound like the kind of thing you wanted to do when you\n\ngrew up? Did it sound like a good deal? Did it sound like interesting work\n\nor did it sound like a lot of, like, headaches?\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: I remember Debra Winger--all right, this was when I was a\n\nlittle older. I was probably like 14. But they made \"A Dangerous Woman\" with\n\nher, and I remember her coming over for lunch and my dad or my mom--I can't\n\nremember--one of them saying, `Look, she's dressing like the person that she's\n\nplaying.' I thought that was really fascinating, and I've thought about that\n\na lot since then. You know, just--I mean, what an interesting thing and\n\nespecially if it's unconscious so, you know, then, how interesting. 'Cause\n\nthat happens to me, I think. I'm realizing more and more. You know, I won't\n\nrealize while it's happening, but, you know, I made a movie last winter where\n\nI was playing someone really glamorous and interested in herself as a sexy,\n\nwell-dressed woman. And I'd found the way I wanted--what I wanted to adorn\n\nmyself with shifted. Or when I made \"Casa de los Babys,\" I mean, really\n\nshifted, you know, the way I--what I felt was beautiful, what I felt was not\n\nbeautiful, how I felt about myself as a person, as a, you know...\n\nGROSS: Is this a transitional period for you where people in the movie\n\nindustry are figuring out that you're--I guess, they've figured this out\n\nalready, that you're not just, you know, Naomi Foner and Stephen Gyllenhaal's\n\nkid, that you're an adult, you're your own person now. 'Cause when people\n\nknow you as the son or daughter of somebody, it's sometimes hard to have them\n\nsee you as who you really are beyond that?\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Mm-hmm. The person in my family that it's gotten the most\n\ncomplicated with is my mother. You know, there was a point last year when I\n\nwas going--it was during all this award stuff and I was, you know, it was the\n\nfirst time I've ever had--you know, gone to any of this, you know, this party\n\nand that party and this thing and that thing. And it was both exhausting and\n\nthrilling to me, all of it. But some of these places where I was invited to\n\ngo or interested in going, like, you know, there's a film company called\n\nKeller Films(ph), and some of my good friends work there. And my mother is\n\nworking with one of my good friends on developing a movie. And so I was, you\n\nknow, invited to this party. It was a party of people who I felt were my\n\ncontemporaries. My mother was also invited to this party. She felt it was a\n\nparty of people who were her contemporaries, you know, 'cause there were all\n\nsort of different ages of people at this party. And I felt really conflicted,\n\nyou know. I'm going to go to this party and my mom's going to be there, you\n\nknow.\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: And I thought it was really great that my mother said, `I\n\nwant to do everything I can to respect you.' I mean, this was finally what\n\nshe said. It was much harder at first, but finally, she said, `I want to\n\nrespect you. I also need you to respect me,' which is much more kind of\n\ngive-and-take adult conversation than, you know, any kind of conversations\n\nwe'd ever had before. You know, with my brother, it's easier. I mean, he's\n\nmy brother, it's fine. He goes to a party with me, it's great. He's my\n\nfriend, you know, or he...\n\nGROSS: Right. Right.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: ...and he and I have had to deal more with being competitive\n\nand getting jealous. I mean, there have been times when, you know, it seems\n\nlike we wouldn't be up for the same things, but we're both interested in, you\n\nknow, the one good movie that's being made and, you know...\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: ...for a couple of months' time and the two characters that\n\nwe could play are lovers. So on...\n\nGROSS: Can't do that.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: No.\n\nGROSS: Can't go there.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: So only one of us can do it and, you know, but I think we've\n\nactually been doing pretty well. I mean, I think all of this stuff we've\n\nbeen--and this is in retrospect, but, you know, we've been using as a way of\n\ncommunicating about more complicated things.\n\nGROSS: Well, I hate to end it here, but we're out of time. Thank you so much\n\nfor talking with us.\n\nMs. GYLLENHAAL: Sure.\n\nGROSS: Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the stars of John Sayles' new film \"Casa\n\nde los Babys.\"\n\n(Credits)\n\nGROSS: I'm Terry Gross."
