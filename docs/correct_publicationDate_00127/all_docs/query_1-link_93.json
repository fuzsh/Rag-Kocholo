        "text": "Category Archives: Books\n\nNavigating a Submerged Future: An Analysis of J.G. Ballard’s The Drowned World\n\nJ.G. Ballard’s The Drowned World is a seminal work in the canon of apocalyptic fiction. Published in 1962, this novel offers a prescient vision of a climate-ravaged Earth, serving as a haunting reflection on humanity’s relationship with its environment.\n\nNarrative and Style\n\nBallard’s narrative is set in a future where rising temperatures and melting ice caps have transformed the planet. Major cities are submerged, and the world is reverting to a prehistoric state. The story follows Dr. Robert Kerans, a biologist, as he navigates this dystopian landscape, which is as much a psychological realm as it is a physical one.\n\nThe prose in The Drowned World is rich and evocative, with Ballard’s descriptions of the sunken cities being particularly vivid and haunting. The narrative is less about the action and more about the internal journeys of the characters as they adapt to their changing world. Ballard masterfully uses the environment as a character in itself, shaping and reflecting the mental states of the protagonists.\n\nCharacters and Themes\n\nKerans, the protagonist, is a complex character, emblematic of humanity’s struggle to find meaning in this new world. His journey is introspective, exploring themes of memory, identity, and the unconscious mind. Other characters, like Beatrice Dahl and Colonel Riggs, represent different responses to the crisis – resignation, resistance, and adaptation.\n\nA central theme of the novel is the psychological impact of environmental change. Ballard delves into the idea that the external world can profoundly influence the human psyche, suggesting that the drowned world is not just a physical reality but also a metaphor for the characters’ inner landscapes.\n\nThe book also grapples with themes of time and evolution. The regression of the planet to a more primitive state raises questions about the nature of progress and the cyclical nature of time and history.\n\nOriginality: 5/5\n\nThe Drowned World stands out for its visionary approach to the apocalyptic genre. Ballard’s focus on the psychological effects of environmental disaster was groundbreaking for its time and remains highly relevant in today’s context of climate change concerns.\n\nThoughtfulness: 4.5/5\n\nBallard’s novel is a deeply thoughtful exploration of complex themes. His examination of how human beings might psychologically respond to drastic environmental changes challenges readers to think about the interconnectedness of our external and internal worlds.\n\nEntertainment: 4/5\n\nWhile The Drowned World is not a conventional page-turner, it offers a unique and immersive reading experience. The novel’s slow pace and introspective nature might not appeal to all readers, but those who appreciate rich, descriptive prose and deep thematic exploration will find it captivating.\n\nOverall Rating: 4.5/5\n\nIn conclusion, J.G. Ballard’s The Drowned World is a profound and beautifully written novel that delves into the impact of environmental catastrophe on the human psyche. Its prescient vision of a climate-changed world, combined with its exploration of deep psychological themes, makes it a standout work in apocalyptic literature.\n\nImmerse yourself in J.G. Ballard’s prophetic vision by purchasing The Drowned World on Amazon, and explore the depths of human psychology in a changing world.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nExploring Resilience and Art in a Post-Apocalyptic World: A Review of Emily St. John Mandel’s Station Eleven\n\nStation Eleven, a novel by Emily St. John Mandel, stands as a poignant and beautifully crafted work of apocalyptic fiction. The book weaves a compelling narrative that transcends the typical boundaries of the genre, offering a thoughtful exploration of humanity, art, and survival.\n\nNarrative and Style\n\nAt the heart of Station Eleven is a narrative that stretches across time, characters, and geographies. Mandel elegantly shifts between the pre-apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic worlds, with the collapse catalyzed by the Georgian Flu, a deadly pandemic. The book is not merely about the fall of civilization but is an ode to the world that was lost.\n\nThe narrative centers around a troupe of actors and musicians, known as the Traveling Symphony, who journey through the remnants of North America. Their motto, “Survival is insufficient,” borrowed from Star Trek: Voyager, encapsulates the book’s essence – that survival in a post-apocalyptic world demands more than just the preservation of life; it necessitates the preservation of that which makes life worth living.\n\nCharacters in Station Eleven are intricately drawn, each carrying their own stories, losses, and hopes. The central character, Kirsten Raymonde, a child actress turned Traveling Symphony performer, serves as a thread connecting various narrative elements. Her memories of performing in a production of King Lear just before the pandemic, and her interactions with the enigmatic Arthur Leander, a famous actor, set the stage for a complex web of relationships that span decades.\n\nThemes and Symbolism\n\nMandel’s narrative is rich with themes and symbolism. One of the most striking is the exploration of art and culture as humanity’s enduring legacy. In a world stripped of modern comforts, the Traveling Symphony’s performances become a beacon of hope, a reminder of the beauty and resilience of the human spirit.\n\nAnother significant theme is the interconnectedness of people and events. Mandel masterfully illustrates how the lives of her characters intertwine, both before and after the collapse, suggesting a deep, almost mystical network of human connection.\n\nThe novel also delves into the nature of memory and nostalgia. Characters grapple with their recollections of the past – a world of electric lights and airplanes – and the pain of knowing it can never be reclaimed. This nostalgia is not just for individual loss but for the loss of a way of life.\n\nOriginality: 4.5/5\n\nStation Eleven stands out for its unique approach to apocalyptic fiction. Mandel eschews the typical focus on survivalism and dystopia, instead choosing to illuminate the enduring nature of art and human connection. The novel’s structure, jumping between characters and timelines, is executed with skill, making the story both fresh and intriguing.\n\nThoughtfulness: 5/5\n\nThe depth of writing and the themes explored in Station Eleven are exceptional. Mandel’s prose is both elegant and haunting, filled with reflections on the human condition. The novel encourages readers to ponder not just the fragility of civilization, but also the enduring qualities that define humanity.\n\nEntertainment: 4.5/5\n\nWhile the pace of Station Eleven is more reflective than action-driven, it remains an utterly engaging read. The characters are compelling, the narrative is rich with detail and emotion, and the world-building is immersive. Readers will find themselves lost in Mandel’s post-apocalyptic vision, captivated by the intertwining stories and the lyrical quality of her writing.\n\nOverall Rating: 4.67/5\n\nIn conclusion, Station Eleven is a masterful work of literature that transcends the boundaries of its genre. It’s a novel not just about the end of the world, but about the things that survive: art, memory, and human connection. Emily St. John Mandel has crafted a story that is at once a lament for a lost world and a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nClick here to purchase Station Eleven on Amazon and explore the enduring beauty of Emily St. John Mandel’s post-apocalyptic vision.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Folk of the Fringe by Orson Scott Card\n\nIntroduction:\n\n“The Folk of the Fringe” by Orson Scott Card, a collection of interconnected stories set in a post-apocalyptic America, offers a unique take on survival and community rebuilding. Published in 1989, this book takes readers through various narratives that converge to paint a picture of a society trying to hold onto its humanity amidst chaos.\n\nReview:\n\nOriginality: 3.5/5\n\nCard’s approach to the post-apocalyptic genre in “The Folk of the Fringe” is noteworthy for its focus on community and rebuilding rather than on the collapse itself. The book’s structure as a series of interconnected stories rather than a single narrative arc gives a broader perspective on the post-disaster world. However, some of the themes and scenarios may feel familiar to avid readers of the genre, slightly impacting its originality score.\n\nThoughtfulness: 4/5\n\nOrson Scott Card excels in creating deeply human and morally complex characters. The stories in “The Folk of the Fringe” are rich with religious and philosophical undertones, exploring themes of faith, community, leadership, and morality in times of crisis. The character-driven narratives offer a thoughtful exploration of how personal beliefs and values are tested and reshaped in a world where societal norms have been upended.\n\nEntertainment: 3.5/5\n\nThe book’s segmented structure provides varied and intriguing insights into the post-apocalyptic world Card has created. While each story is engaging and emotionally resonant, the collection’s diverse narratives might not provide the cohesive suspense or pacing that some readers prefer in their post-apocalyptic fiction. However, those who appreciate character development and moral dilemmas will find the book highly engaging.\n\nOverall Rating: 3.7/5\n\n“The Folk of the Fringe” is a thoughtful and introspective addition to the post-apocalyptic genre. It offers a unique perspective on how individuals and communities might strive to rebuild society on the fringes of a collapsed world. While it might not have the constant thrills of more action-oriented post-apocalyptic stories, it compensates with depth and moral complexity.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOrson Scott Card’s “The Folk of the Fringe” is a compelling read for those interested in the human aspect of survival in a post-apocalyptic setting. The book’s strength lies in its exploration of the resilience of the human spirit and the complexities of rebuilding civilization. It’s a recommended read for anyone who appreciates thought-provoking, character-driven narratives in their science fiction.\n\nAffiliate Link:\n\nInterested readers can delve into the compelling world of “The Folk of the Fringe” by Orson Scott Card by purchasing through this Amazon Affiliate link: Buy “The Folk of the Fringe”.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSurviving the Seas of Despair: The Last Ship by William Brinkley\n\n“The Last Ship” by William Brinkley is a riveting piece of apocalyptic fiction that delves into the aftermath of a global nuclear catastrophe.

Set in a dystopian future England, Hoban’s novel is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring quest for meaning amidst chaos.\n\nWhat sets “Riddley Walker” apart is its unique narrative style. Hoban immerses the reader in a world through the eyes and language of Riddley, a young boy navigating the complexities of a society rebuilt from the ashes. The language is fragmented, echoing the broken world in which Riddley lives. This linguistic creativity not only adds depth to the novel’s atmosphere but also challenges readers to piece together the world as Riddley sees it.\n\nThe story unfolds in an England reverted to a primitive state, where folklore and myth intertwine with the remnants of a forgotten technological age. Hoban masterfully crafts a narrative that is both a coming-of-age tale and a philosophical musing on the cyclical nature of history and knowledge. Riddley’s journey is not just physical but also intellectual, as he uncovers the mysteries of the past and grapples with the implications for his future.\n\nThe magic of “Riddley Walker” lies in its ability to transport readers into a world that is at once alien and eerily familiar.

Comprising “Annihilation,” “Authority,” and “Acceptance,” this trilogy delves into the surreal and the unknown, leaving readers both enthralled and unsettled.\n\nThe apocalypse type in VanderMeer’s trilogy is unique—a slow, creeping ecological and biological transformation, originating from a mysterious zone known as Area X. This entity or phenomenon, ever-expanding and altering the landscape and life within it, creates a setting that is both eerily beautiful and profoundly disturbing. VanderMeer’s depiction of Area X is a masterclass in environmental storytelling, blending elements of cosmic horror with ecological intrigue.\n\nThe trilogy’s tone shifts across the three books, mirroring the evolving nature of Area X itself. “Annihilation” is claustrophobic and intensely personal, told through the eyes of the Biologist. It’s a tale of discovery and transformation, heavy with a sense of foreboding. “Authority” switches gears to a more bureaucratic, but no less eerie, perspective, focusing on the Southern Reach, the agency tasked with understanding Area X. Finally, “Acceptance” weaves multiple viewpoints, timelines, and revelations, culminating in a finale that is as enigmatic as it is satisfying.\n\nVanderMeer’s characters are deeply complex and flawed, each shaped by their encounters with Area X. Their development is as much a part of the story as the mysteries they unravel.

At its heart, it’s a saga of the decline and fall of a Galactic Empire, echoing the historical cycles of rise and fall that characterize our own history. This sprawling epic is set against the backdrop of a universe teetering on the edge of a dark age, instilling a sense of impending doom that is quintessential to apocalyptic literature.\n\nThe series begins with “Foundation,” where Asimov introduces us to Hari Seldon, a visionary mathematician. Seldon’s psychohistory, a blend of history, sociology, and mathematical statistics, predicts the inevitable fall of the Empire and a subsequent dark age lasting 30,000 years. To mitigate this, he proposes the creation of the Foundation – a repository of knowledge aimed at reducing this period of barbarism to a mere 1,000 years. This premise alone is a masterful stroke, blending the intellectual thrill of seeing the future through the lens of psychohistory with the visceral dread of an impending collapse.\n\nAs the series progresses, we are treated to a rich tapestry of characters and civilizations, each grappling with the legacy of the fallen empire and the looming shadow of the future. The tone of the story fluctuates between hope and despair, capturing the existential dread of an apocalypse with the thrill of potential rebirth. The series spans centuries, allowing us to witness the evolution of societies and ideas, a rare treat in fiction.\n\nWhat stands out in the “Foundation” series is not just its grand scale but its focus on the resilience and adaptability of humanity. It’s a story about how knowledge, culture, and science are beacons in the dark times. The entertainment value lies in the intricacies of the plot, the intellectual challenges posed by the problems the characters face, and the satisfaction of seeing the long arc of history bend.\n\nFor those interested in exploring this seminal work, I’d recommend starting with the first book, “Foundation,” available Here . This not only sets the stage for the rest of the series but introduces you to Asimov’s unique style of blending grand historical themes with engaging storytelling.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAmnesia Moon by Jonathan Lethem\n\n“Amnesia Moon” by Jonathan Lethem is a phantasmagoric journey through a post-apocalyptic America, a narrative that blends the boundaries between reality and dream. In this novel, Lethem takes us into the life of Chaos, a man living in a movie theater in a town where the color green has ceased to exist. The story unfolds as Chaos embarks on a road trip across a nation fragmented into myriad micro-realities, each dictated by the psychic dominion of individual dreamers.\n\nLethem’s world is a kaleidoscope of bizarre landscapes and even stranger characters. The towns Chaos visits are surreal microcosms, each governed by its own set of peculiar rules and realities. From a town where everyone shares the same dream to another where people are unable to wake up, Lethem’s America is a fragmented puzzle of existential crises and distorted perceptions.\n\nThe narrative is as much a psychological exploration as it is a physical journey. Chaos’ quest is not just to understand the fractured world around him, but also to piece together his own shattered identity. The tone of the novel is one of persistent uncertainty, a dream-like quality where the lines between reality and illusion are perpetually blurred.\n\nFor fans of speculative fiction, “Amnesia Moon” is a richly imaginative and compelling read.

The novel, a masterpiece of apocalyptic fiction, takes us on a journey through a land ravaged by an unspecified cataclysm. The story is centered around a father and son, traveling towards the coast, hoping for a better future amidst the ashes of the old world.\n\nThe starkness of McCarthy’s prose mirrors the barrenness of the landscape, a world where the remnants of civilization lie in ruins. The author masterfully crafts an environment where the silence is as profound as the desolation, and every breath of the wind carries a tale of lost hope and enduring love. This journey is not just a physical one but also a deep exploration into the human spirit, testing the limits of endurance, morality, and the unbreakable bond between parent and child.\n\nThe Road’s apocalyptic setting is not defined by the usual tropes of nuclear fallout or alien invasions.

The tone of the story is grim, yet it’s punctuated with moments of tender warmth, serving as a poignant reminder of what it means to be human in the face of overwhelming despair.\n\nThe entertainment value in “The Road” lies not in action-packed sequences or thrilling plot twists, but in its profound emotional depth and the beauty of its sparse, poetic language.

E. Borton Author of the Post Apocalyptic Book Series Without\n\nThis guest post is by E. E. Borton, author of the post apocalyptic book series Without. I was excited to hear from E. E. Borton since the Without Series tells the story about the devastation following an geomagnetic storm that permanently disables all of the electrical devices on Earth. This fictional scenario happens to be one of my favorites, in part because it is a fairly common on our planet, at least as far as we know. The last time a major solar flare collided with Earth’s magnetosphere was in 1857 (see Carrington Event). If we had a geomagnetic storm of similar magnitude today, we might be looking at a scenario quite similar to E.E. Borton’s Without series. Thank you to E. E. Borton for sharing some insights into his post apocalyptic book series.\n\nThe WITHOUT series is a collaboration between friends. Sean Chase and Keith Foster pitched me the idea for the first novel over a pitcher of beer. I was hooked and finished two versions of the first chapter the next day. Once I convinced them to let me create the story in first person versus third, and change the title from WITHOUT POWER, I was off to the races. Three months later, I wrote the last page.\n\nBefore I set out to write a book, I have a detailed outline to keep myself on track. There is a certain pace and cadence a writer follows, and all of them are different. There was no outline created for WITHOUT.\n\nSean and Keith gave me the premise for the first chapter. The characters I created gave me the rest. They told me where they wanted to go and what they were going to do when they got there. All I had to do was write down what happened along the way. It was the most challenging novel I’ve written in my career so far, but by far the most rewarding. It taught me a lot about myself as a writer.\n\nI served twice in Naval Intelligence. Once after school and again after 9/11. The travel and experiences were phenomenal. It showed me what the rest of the world looked like. Some of it was breathtaking. Some of it was heartbreaking.\n\nThere are 7.5 billion people on the planet. 1.2 billion of them live without power. I’ve traveled to many third world countries and have witnessed their daily struggle to survive. It intrigued me to think about how the population of our country would survive if electricity was taken away…forever. Life for those who never had it wouldn’t change much at all. Ours would be turned on its head.\n\nMy novels are works of fiction, but the amount of research I had to complete WITHOUT was extreme compared to my other books. I had to answer questions about a world few of us have experienced. The most glaring was how fast would a modern society disintegrate after a large scale catastrophic event. The answer was disturbing. In an urban environment – in a city – it would start as soon as the sun went down.\n\nMy research covered a wide range of events that were either man-made, accidental, or natural disasters that caused large-scale power outages. Most only lasting a few days, but some lasting a few weeks. In every situation, the good and the bad in people hit both ends of the spectrum. In every situation when large groups of people were plunged into darkness, things went from bad to worse within 24 hours. The downward spiral didn’t change until power was restored.\n\nThose who were prepared – even slightly – fared much better than those who were caught off guard. A portable generator, store of batteries, or even a hand-cranked radio/charger/flashlight combo became more valuable than a pot of gold. At the very least it gave them the ability to see what went bump in the night, work in the dark, and communicate with the outside world. It may not seem like much, but it made all the difference for them.\n\nWITHOUT and WITHOUT II – The Fall, are novels about what may happen if the lights go out…and they don’t come back. I wanted to immerse my character, and myself, into that world and push the boundaries of my creative process. I walked most of the route the character took. I lived without power for days. I was alone while doing both. I didn’t want to tell you what happened to the characters in my book. I wanted to show you.\n\nE. E. Borton\n\neeborton.com\n\n@EEBorton on Twitter\n\nE.E.

Pickering, author of the post-apocalyptic novel Hood: American Rebirth Series Book 1. Evan skillfully shares a profound personal experience with us. He shows us how this experience has influenced him and how it relates to his unique perspective and writing. Thank you Evan for describing end of the world fiction in a way that fans and newcomers alike can and will appreciate!\n\nOur Own Destroyed World\n\nDoesn’t it feel like the end of the world sometimes?\n\nFor us, I mean. For us as individuals in our own lives. The longer we live, the probability that we make some catastrophically bad choice for ourselves will eventually reach 100%.\n\nIt’s part of existence. We fuck it all up. Hopefully it doesn’t kill us. When I was 13 I jumped into the street on my BMX bike and got smashed by a car. Because, y’know, I was thirteen and a dumbass. I had to have my leg rebuilt but otherwise I was still alive. In some realities, maybe I or someone like me would have been killed. It seemed like an easy decision: there’s no one in the road, I want to bomb this gap. Oh wait, a car came while I wasn’t looking. Smash. Lying bloody in the middle of road, unsure of who I was, so deep in shock.\n\nWe can all look back at our lives and point to events that caused our world to fracture and collapse around us. A ruined relationship and the profound emptiness that follows. A terrible life decision that destroys a career. There’s many, many creative ways to fuck up your own life.\n\nAnd from those personal tragedies comes a deep satisfaction in reading/watching apocalypse narratives–all our great mistakes and convoluted modern lives have been wiped away. We are reborn in our survival. The world has changed. In Apocalyptic scenarios, the earth is like me on the bike jumping in front of a car. It limps on, injured but coalescing, turning into something else. Reborn.\n\nBecause that’s what happens to us, isn’t it? Or at least, it can be. In the wake of whatever catastrophic event we have in our personal lives, there is an opportunity. A window wherein we can be reborn, change profoundly and become someone different than who we were before.\n\nAs I lay in the road with my shattered leg, I quietly observed the world around me. People came to me and asked me questions and called an ambulance, but I was not me. Deep in shock and under the influence of whatever drugs my brain had dispensed to keep me from losing my mind, I was no one. I distinctly remember thinking:\n\n“This sucks for whoever this is happening to.”\n\nI didn’t even realize that I was me. A feeling that lies somewhere in the realm of holy shit territory. But eventually when I attributed my consciousness to myself again, I had to deal with the implications of what had happened to me. My life was changed, forever altered, and already I started to question what I was doing, what I wanted moving forward, what my life would be like from then on out.\n\nMy take on Apocalyptic fiction in general is one that is obsessed with rebirth. With the idea that apocalypse narratives are just macrocosms of our own lives. Sometimes it feels like we’ve destroyed our own world, that we feel so distant from who we used to be and what we used to believe. But where something is lost the opportunity for something new to be born arises. A new life can come from the part of us or our world that has died. That’s what I write about. That’s the story I want to tell of the apocalypse.\n\n-Evan Pickering\n\nwww.EvanPickeringAuthor.com\n\nhttps://twitter.com/EvanTP87\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/EPAuthor/\n\nFollow Evan on his social media above and check out his post-apocalyptic American Rebirth Series.

Clark Author of Behind our Walls\n\nThis guest post is by Chad A. Clark, author of the end of the world novel Behind Our Walls. It’s fascinating and encouraging to see some of the influences that inspire people to write books. Growing up in the 80’s, I can sure relate to a lot of Chad’s inspiration! Thanks for sharing Chad! I encourage all of you other guest posters and readers to chime in and leave a comment and follow/say hi to Chad A. Clark.\n\nSeveral years ago, I wrote a short story, titled Tomorrow’s Memory. It is set in an apocalyptic future following some undefined event in which the governments and societies of the world have collapsed. The main character is a man in his early twenties, traveling with a female companion. Along the way, he decides to start keeping a journal and the story consists of his entries in that journal.\n\nI have always been fascinated with what the landscape of the end of the world might look like. And what I mean by that is, we have seen no shortage of films and books, laying out scenarios by which our society could meet its ultimate destruction. And while I have certainly enjoyed these stories, I also wanted to try going in a different direction. I was interested in the perspective of the people on the ground and how their lives are affected, where they go from here.\n\nJust as an example, one thing that has always captivated me about the film Cloverfield is how it is essentially the telling of the Godzilla story, but from the perspective of the screaming mob trying to get away from the monster. This was the sensibility I tried to bring to this story. In an age where we depend so much on technology for our information, what happens when the world crashes down around us and the only means of learning about things is from the mouths of people you encounter on the road. People you may or may not be able to trust.\n\nThese were my favorite aspects of writing Tomorrow’s Memory and it would eventually spark my desire to write a full length novel in that same universe. It was from the seeds of that initial story that Behind Our Walls would eventually grow.\n\nI didn’t want this to be a supernatural story. There are no zombies. I didn’t want this to be a techno-thriller. I wanted it to be a human story. I wanted to take genuine characters and see how they handled complete immersion in a hostile and violent environment. What would it look like if a group of survivors were to try and rebuild on the ashes of a society and start over?\n\nThe book I wrote was originally much longer and offered a few more backstory and clues as to what caused society’s downfall. In the end, I decided that I was being too ambitious and that it would be better to quickly immerse the reader in the world of this story. I wanted to challenge myself to bring the reader closer to the experiences of the characters.\n\nBehind Our Walls is a dark book. It presents a bleak picture of our humanity and what people could be capable of, if left alone with each other and to their own devices. But I think there is also a hint of optimism there as well. As I wrote this, I definitely wanted to bring to bear all of the beautifully grim fiction I had read over the years but I also wanted to avoid the idea that all hope was lost. At the end of the day, I still believe in the inherent goodness of ourselves and I think that should be evident as the story draws to a close.\n\nThis book, as the rest of my writing in general, is driven by my love for dark fiction. There are any number of sources I could point to as the origins for my narrative sensibilities. As a child, I was reading at a very early age and by the time I was ten or eleven, I was given a fair amount of liberty in terms of what I was allowed to read. It wasn’t long before I found my way to the likes of Stephen King and Robert McCammon.\n\nAnd of course, no discussion of the eighties can rightfully leave out the incredible horror movie franchises that came about. There was a special immediacy and dark reality of the practical special effects of the day. Watching slasher or zombie movies, you had an uncomfortable feeling that you were being made privy to something that you weren’t supposed to see.\n\nAll of this acted as a brine of sorts, in which my narrative outlook would start to develop. I love the visceral experience of the horror genre. I love the view you get of humanity in the reflection of horrific events of a story. I love reading and writing books with dark content because it forces you to be a part of the process. You have to bring your own morality to bear and evaluate the things that are happening and how they make you feel. That’s what I think all good art should do.\n\nAnd if I can accomplish that at least some of the time with my own writing, I will consider myself to be a success.\n\nChad A.

Cain Author of Dead Salvage Series\n\nOur latest guest post is from M.L. Cain, author of the post apocalyptic book series Dead Salvage of which the first book called Mourning is now available. M.L. Cain told me that he wrote this on his phone which I must say is impressive! Thanks to M.L. Cain for sharing his very unique perspective with us below!\n\nAlright, my name is ML Cain, an author within the Post apocalyptic/ Military Sci-fi genre, though I don’t like to limit myself. I typically don’t talk about myself much, so forgive me if the awkwardness bleeds through.\n\nOddly enough I’m not a fan of fiction books (there are a couple of exceptions, of course), when it comes to books I prefer non-fiction, usually within the realm of Military History, Ancient Greek history/mythology, and books about killers or other strange happenings and subjects based somewhat in reality.\n\nSo what was my motivation to create a post-apocalyptic fiction series? Simply and honestly put, I enjoy entertaining the idea of human extinction, and the path or struggle to extinction. I grew up on Horror movies, and the gory, adult themed Anime of the 70s- 90s era. I’ve always been fascinated by dark stories of gore, horror and the annihilation of the human race via movies and anime. I’m sure I can attribute some of my inspiration to these films and series which held me spellbound in my early childhood and teen years.\n\nFor me, personally, I look at writing as a form of art, as self expression… I don’t play an instrument, I don’t draw or paint, so I write, it is my release… more than communicating a message, I may want to communicate an emotion or ask a question, or maybe i just want to assault the reader in a non physical way. I’m someone that writes without care for social or moral norms, or rules of a genre. My works are an outlet for my thoughts, emotions and philosophies.\n\nDead Salvage is my first work of fiction, and my first series. My goal with the Dead Salvage series is to tell the story of human extinction, in a unique, meaningful and interesting way. With this and my other up coming works I hope to define/refine myself and my style as a writer,thank you.\n\nOfficial page: Authormlcain.com\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
