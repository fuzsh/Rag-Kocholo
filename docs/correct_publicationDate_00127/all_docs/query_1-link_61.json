        "text": "Over the years, Science Fiction has offered me ways of understanding literary genres, as well as ways of thinking about the world. These understandings inform the courses on language, literature and identity that I have taught here and elsewhere. The first part of the presentation is an extended analogy: it develops an account of the genre of Science Fiction through an autobiographical telling of exploring the city of Hyderabad. The second part of this presentation touches upon some of the “thought-tools” that Science Fiction makes available to us. We argue that the imagined worlds of Science Fiction not only paint for us a variety of futures, but perhaps even more importantly, help us to reflect upon, and act in, the complex times we live in.\n\nFrom Hugo Gernsback to Joseph W. Campbell, from the Golden Age to the rise of paperbacks, the New Wave, cyberpunk, and the dominance of film and TV, the established history of American sf has been told and retold several times now. This is how histories and canons are cemented: by the sustained repetition of a narrative that takes on—slowly, eventually, and even inexorably—the appearance of objectivity. A cynical approach to reading Gary Westfahl’s new book, which is a collection of eight previously published chapters, now updated, alongside six newly-written chapters designed to create a “mosaic of my general argument about the genre’s development” (4), would be to summarize it as yet another retelling of the entrenched history of the genre in America, with all of the usual figures and texts that, while crucial to sf’s development, are now so well-known among critics and scholars as to be hardly worth dragging into the spotlight. It would be easy to conclude, rather dismissively, that this history has become a kind of metanarrative, to borrow Lyotard’s term, and that its recapitulation lacks critical and scholarly value.\n\nPostmodern literature, fiction in particular, is, according to Barth (1984), a literature of exhausted possibility due to its entangled thematic and technical approach which defies the conventional modern fictional form. It reflects the zeitgeist or the spirit of postmodernism which is regarded as a revaluation of the modern enterprise; an enterprise that embodies universality and coherence. The present research paper attempts to address the recurrent thematic element that postmodern fiction revolves around: that of the presence of the historiographic element in postmodern fiction which reflects in itself the evaluation of past history; such a fictional preoccupation reflects the major postmodern philosophers' and thinkers' concerns, such as those of Lyotard and Baudrillard, on the impossibility for the existence of a universal coherent history. This criterion is one amongst other criteria that justify the exhaustion of postmodern fiction.\n\nWhen seen from the perspective of soul, literature reveals itself as psyche’s other. By this I mean that psyche reflects its self-movement in literature. The intimate relationship between psyche and language has only been discovered around the 18th or 19th centuries when an explosion of interest in the phenomenon of language occurred. But this intimate relationship has always been so, although unrecognized as such, until consciousness was able to “perceive” language as a phenomenon, distinct from natural phenomena. … We are now in a time of a transformation in the configuration of consciousness-world and, correspondingly, new genres of literature are in the process of forming—genres that may one day reflect and articulate the psyche as newly re-configured…. With this catastrophic psychic transformation in mind, we must ask what genre of literature can express, articulate and manifest movement as is now privileged by the psyche so that new cultural practices may come into being and new contours of the world may be perceived. The first part of this essay concerns my efforts towards finding such a genre as I personally underwent the catastrophe of the collapse of opposites, and the second part addresses some very interesting and relevant work occurring throughout the literary world, which I believe is heading in the same direction as my own efforts.\n\nThis thesis studies hybrid fiction to identify characteristics of contemporary American literature in the twenty-first century. Hybrid fiction represents the role of affect in the constitution of human subjectivities. Affect presupposes an interconnection between humans and nonhumans and challenges the distinction between the subject and the object. Hybrid fiction thus portrays humans as relational entities with the potential to affect and be affected by humans and nonhuman others. Moreover, it emphasizes the influence of affect in the relationship between the text and the reader. It uses certain forms, structures, and writing styles are used in hybrid fiction to make the reader an active participant in meaning production. Accordingly, hybrid fiction is committed to hybrid and affective thinking both at the levels of form and content. The thesis considers the juxtaposition between affect and subjectivity in three aspects: authenticity, literacy, and critique. The first chapter exami..."
