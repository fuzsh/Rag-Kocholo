Travels to Europe were influential in his developing style.

Not long after his arrival he started singing for Freedom Press. From 1989 to 1997 Zolty along with bandmates Annie Wilkinson and Wayne Adams played in Zolty Cracker, a band formed around the presentation of his songs. Three albums were produced in that time as well as tours across Canada, down the west and east coasts of the United States and over to Europe. Not long after Zolty Cracker's last gig Gilles started on his second solo venture. Called Horny Astronaut, it was finished in 2000.\n\nZolty has had a number of other music related pursuits. He is one of the founders of Music Waste, an annual festival in Vancouver established in 1994, supporting and promoting independent bands.[3] While living in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Zolty continued to support young artists.[4][5] In 2007 he and Aleyna May Morin co-produced a compilation album of young aboriginal hip hop artists, Burden of Truth.[6]\n\nHe has studied film scoring at Berklee College of Music and continues to work as a composer and sound designer having worked on more than 60 Theatre productions to date.[1]\n\nZolty released an eponymous solo album in 2010 on the record label Boutique Empire.[7]\n\nGilles moved back to his home town of Montreal June 2023.\n\nZolty Cracker released an EP named \"Bodies Apart\" in November 2023.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nZolty (1987)\n\nZolty Cracker (Zolty Cracker – 1990)\n\nGo Please Stay (Zolty Cracker – 1993)\n\nFlush (Zolty Cracker – 1995)\n\nHorny Astronaut (Zolty – 2000)\n\nGilles Zolty (Gilles Zolty - 2010)\n\nBodies Apart EP (Zolty Cracker - 2023)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMusic portal\n\nCanada portal\n\nMusic of Canada\n\nCanadian rock\n\nList of Canadian musicians\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
