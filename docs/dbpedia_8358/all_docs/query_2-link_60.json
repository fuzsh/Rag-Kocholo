I'd like to\n\nexpand this with some nice info in an eMail which I kept an year ago - but\n\ncould not find on-line now. I had to do some research for a friend. His family is related to the\n\nWeizmanns from Motol. Chaim Weizmann, the first president of modern Israel,\n\nwas born in Motol, in today's Belarus. Searching for Weizmanns and Motol, I\n\ncame across this. The author of the eMail.mentioned quoted his uncle Aaron.\n\nAaron - believed to live across from the Weizmanns in Motol - said that\n\n\"the Weizmanns were so rich\" that....\n\n\"they had sugar in their tea every day.\" !!\n\nCertainly many of us take some things for granted nowadays - sugar, for\n\nexample. Extracting and refining sugar from sugar beet was the activity of\n\nsome of my family members. Probably, the Weizmann's sugar came from sugar\n\nbeet, too. By the way, I remember the tradition of cube-in-teeth and tea- in- tall-\n\nglasses (with and without handles) for family members originating as North\n\nas Vilna Gubernia and as South as Kremenchug, Ukraine.

Porat, February 11th, 2003\n\nI, Meltser Dovid-Leyzer was born in Volozhin in 1923. Meltser Shimen Itskhok son of Zvi of Vishnevo was my father; Sore Sheyne nee Rabinovitsh was my mother.\n\nI was studying in the Volozhin Hebrew Tarbut School and in the Polish Primary Povshekhna until 1939. From 1939 until 1941, during the Soviet rule, I completed my studies in the Russian School.\n\nThe Germans occupied Volozhin on June 1941. All Jewish inhabitants were transferred into the Ghetto a month later. 200 Jews were gathered on the towns Sport Stadium and executed by shooting In October 1941. It was the first mass slaughter in Volozhin. The second massacre occurred near the ancient Graveyard on May 10, 1942, where 2000 Jews were murdered. The last mass slughter, the third one took place in the Volozhinka streambed in August 1942. Our family; my parents, brother and sister and I were driven away from the ghetto by the Germans and their assistants; local Policemen. We were taken into the black smith building that was erected during the time of the Soviet rule. The building was located on the Dubinski Street (now Sovietskaya) .\n\nThe Aktion took place during the second Pogrom, They put us in groups of eighty people each and transfered us group by group to the killing field.\n\nthe killings were conducted near the Jewish Graveyard The Jews were executed by shooting.\n\nMy father told me...\n\n\"Run, my son, perhaps you'll be the sole to survive of our family\".\n\nI put myself on his shoulders, removed some tiles from the roof and run away.\n\nOne other person was able to jumped and run away after me, It was Ele Mlot. I spent some days in forest, than returned to the Volozhin Ghetto where I was hiding in a nook.\n\nI found out that my parents, my sister and brother were executed on May 10, 1942. I run back into forest after the third slaughter, than I was able to transfer to the shtetl Krevo, where a ghetto still existed. From Krevo I went to Smorgon where from they transferred us to Lithuania and imprisoned in the Zhensistoria concentration camp. A group of us they brought into Vilnius in December 1942, where we were ordered to build a commercial rail station. Once in the evening, returning from work, I run away into a near by forest. I wandered there some days until I met with Russian Partisans. I joined the Bagration group of the Voroshilov Brigade. I was with the partisans until the liberation of Belarus and Lithuania. After liberation I joined the Red Army. The Victory day I met in Magdenburgh, Germany. I was released from the army and returned to Volozhin in December 1945 and went to work. I married Sofiya (Sonia) Milikovski, daughter of Leyzer Itskhok and Hana born Berman from Horodok\n\nOur marriege took place in Volozhin in 1947. Our daughter Hasia was born in 1950. She was ill and passed away at age 31 to our great grievance in the year 1981.\n\nOur son Shimon was born in Volozhin on 1954. We made Aliya to Israel, the entire family, my wife, my son Shimon, his wife Polina, his children Asia and Yakov and me where now we live.\n\nI will post the letter in Volozhin stories\n\nsome of the tree;\n\nZvi MELTZER (grandfathjer of Shimon Peres)\n\nBorn: Abt 1865, Volozhin, Vilna, Poland\n\nPERISHED: 22 Oct 1942, Vishnevo, Vilna, Russia\n\nSpouse: ELTE Children:\n\nShimon Isaac MELTZER Born: Abt 1895, Volozhin, Vilna, Russia.

I (Jason I Alpert) knew Kalman and Mary well. (I was born in Lewiston, Maine, March 8, 1940.) My mother worshipped her Aunt Mary, and repeatedly took me to visit her. Many years ago, I spent a few hours with Kalman Scolnik at 210 Ash Street. I picked his brain in compiling our family tree. Unfortunately, Kalman has passed on, and the piece of paper containing that family-tree has been lost. Some things survive in my memory, to wit: Kalman said that our ultimate ancestor was named Eliyahu Der Vilner (meaning Eliyahu from the City of Vilna). This is undoubtedly the Eliyahu Zaludik that is listed on Dave Fessler's excellent family-tree (see below). (And, no -- this is NOT the Vilner Gaon.) Kalman lived to the age of perhaps 110 or 120. In case you want to try to figure out his exact age, consider this: Kalman once told me that he (Kalman) was born in Kurenitz (Kurenets in Belorus) \"the year of the big fire.\" Kalman also told me that he'd had a brother who'd changed his name to Alperowicz (a very popular family-name in Kurenitz), and that this brother had then moved (from Kurenitz) to Bobruisk (Belorus). Someone should try to locate any descendants of this displaced family-member ...\n\nKalman's wife (and first-cousin) was Mary. \"Aunt Mary\" was a sister of my grandfather (Eliyohu-Shlomo or \"E-le-SHLEY-me\") Gurewitz. My mother Dorothy Gurewitz Alpert (Eleshleyme's daughter) used to address her as \" Mi-YA-she\" (probably from the Russian name Mar-ya-sha)\" My mother OB\"M passed away Feb 1991.\n\nKalman and Mary's two unmarried sons, Bill and Eddy, still live at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston. Bill and Eddy probably possess a treasure-trove of information that could be used for family genealogical research. By this I mean correspondence from pre-war Europe. This is because the Scolniks have lived at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston \"forever\", and that address has for many years served as a rally point for separated and dispersed family members to seek each other. (According to Dave Fessler's family-tree, Bill was born in 1913, and Eddy in 1917 -- so I wouldn't procrastinate contacting them.)\n\nFor example, cousin Ida Manpel Rubin (see below) once told me the story of how she'd been reunited with her brother Elye after the Holocaust. She said that Elye had written to the Scolniks at 210 Ash Street saying that he was still alive. He'd survived the Nazis, and was living in Russia. (The only American address that he had was 210 Ash Street.) The Scolnik's contacted Ida in NYC upon receipt of this letter (more about this below). Nevertheless, Ida disliked her uncle Kalman. She called him \"a miyeser shlang!\". (Perhaps she was jealous of his great wealth???) Ida (Chaya-Hinda) MANPEL was born in Dalhinov (Dolginovo), which is now in Belarus. Ida emigrated to the USA, where she married Israel \"Tulie\" RUBIN. They lived in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nI used to have a b/w photo of Ida Manpel and her parents and siblings, sent from Dalhinov to my grandfather Louis Sam Gurewitz in Auburn, Maine. It was sent before she emigrated to the USA. Does anyone have a copy of this priceless photo? I doubt that Ida is still alive. You could check with her son Lewis -- with whom I once played chess while the Rubin family lived on (367?) Miller Avenue in the East New York section of Brooklyn -- around 1954 or so. Here is his address: Rubin, Lewis MD (Urologist)\n\n2320 Bath St # 309\n\nSanta Barbara, CA 93105 Phone: 805-682-7661\n\nAfter Ida Manpel emigrated to the USA, her brother Elye Manpel remained behind in Dalhinov (Dolginovo). Elye was there during the Holocaust. Fortunately, Elye caught the very last train that managed to leave Dalhinov before the Nazis arrived, and thus miraculously escaped the invading Nazis. MANY YEARS LATER, a letter from him was received by the Scolniks at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston. He was (is?) living in the Russian city of Orel (pronounced Aryol). I am attaching a file named Manpel.GIF. This is an image of Elye's address written in Cyrillic characters. Here is my transliteration of the Cyrillic version, and it may be WRONG.\n\nElye Manpel\n\nKomsomolskaya Street 46, Apt. 3\n\nOrël, Russia 302001 (ANSI character-set, used in Windows)\n\nOrl, Russia 302001 (ASCII character-set, used in DOS)\n\nI believe that Elye was Ida's YOUNGEST sibling. Therefore, he might still be alive. Someone should try to locate him, and any possible descendants (as well as Kalman's brother in Bobruisk, mentioned above) ...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLewis Rubin's older brother is Seymour, and the oldest is Jackie.\n\nI found these 2 addresses for Seymour on the Internet.\n\nI don't know if either is correct. Rubin, Seymour\n\n2085 Rkwy Pkwy\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11236\n\n(718) 763-5419 Rubin, Seymour\n\n4218 Bedford Ave\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11229\n\n(718) 769-2444 I also found Jackie's address on the Internet. I KNOW that this address is correct, because I used to visit Ida there.\n\nRubin, Jack\n\n2896 W 8th St\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11224\n\n(718) 373-2049\n\n(718) 373-0230 Since Jackie Rubin is occupying his parents' apartment, and since he is the oldest son -- I would think that he might be in possession of old family photos and correspondence from pre-war Eastern Europe. (Similar situation to Bill and Eddy Scolnik, above)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***** More About the Family ***** During the years 1953-1956 (when I first came to NYC from Maine to study in a yeshiva), I used to regularly visit cousin Ida Manpel-Rubin and her husband Israel (Tulie), and their three sons.\n\nThey lived in the East New York section of Brooklyn, at 367 ? Miller Avenue.\n\n(Later, they moved to 2896 West 8th Street in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.) After visiting with Ida, I would walk over to (129?) Miller Avenue, and visit with cousin Sadie (Mrs Jake) Friedland, and her daughter Pauline. (I was just 13 or 14 years old. Ida and then Sadie would both feed me well.) I believe that Sadie had a sister (Becky Williams?) maybe in Far Rockway,NY. Besides their daughter Pauline, Sadie and Jake had a son named Al Friedland. Al married his second-cousin Estelle (nee Gurewitz), from Ithaca, New York (more below). -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy grandfather Louis Sam (Eleshleyme) Gurewitz (changed from Zaludik) had these siblings (as far as I recall): 1. Mary (Maryasha), who married her first-cousin Kalman Scolnik.\n\n(They lived at 210 Ash Street in Lewiston, Maine, as mentioned above.)\n\n2. David, of Lewiston, Maine. He never married.\n\n3. Harry, of Ithaca, New York. [I recall now that Mary's husband Kalman couldn't stomach Mary's brother Dovid. Dovid would have to sneak over to 210 Ash St. for a meal when Kalman wasn't home. Maybe this is one of the reasons that cousin Ida Manpel-Rubin didn't like him. (As I mentioned above.)\n\nI never met Harry Gurewitz. According to my records, Harry's daughter Estelle married her second-cousin Al Friedland. They had three children: Rickie, Phillip, Jay Lee, and Lisa Sue.\n\nI don't remember if I ever met any of Estelle's children. I MAY have met Estelle and Al Friedland, possibly at Sadie's home on 129 Miller Avenue in Brooklyn. I don't remember.) I vaguely remember that family members would stay with Estelle, whenever they visited Florida. (Why pay for a hotel?)\n\nMy records show her address as: Estelle Friedland\n\n17521 N. E. 1st Court\n\nNorth Miami Beach, Florida 33162 But I couldn't find it on the Internet. I am fairly sure that her husband Al Friedland has passed away. I don't know about her. The children are probably alive.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------- A 3rd son of Kalman and Mary Scolnik is Sam Scolnik. Sam is married to the former Mary Abromson. He is a (retired?) lawyer.\n\nHere is their address: Samuel and Mary Scolnik\n\n3700 Calvert Pl\n\nKensington, Maryland 20895\n\n301-949-0519\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n******** Re the surname \"GUREWITZ\" ********\n\nIda Manpel once told me that the family-name Gurewitz wasn't genuine. The name was really Zheludek (Ida even wrote Zheludek for me on a paper.)\n\nAlso, As a child, I once questioned \"Uncle Dovid\" (as I used to fondly address him) as to why the family name had been changed from Zheludek to Gurewitz. His reply was something like: \"Vos bin ich shul-dik vos der ta-te hot amol ge-ton?\" -- which gave me the impression that he couldn't, or didn't want to, explain why his father Yosef (after whom I'm named), had changed the name. Well, this is confirmed by Dave Fessler's family-tree. Only there, the name is spelled Zaludik -- which is probably more correct.\n\nThere is a Yizkor-book commemorating a TOWN named ZHELUDOK. See\n\nhttp://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/zaludok/zheludok.html\n\nMany years ago I skimmed through this book. In it I found some cousins of\n\nmine (from a different side of the family, not related to the Scolniks and Zaludiks) named ALPEROWICZ (ALPEROVITCH) and SZYFMANOWICZ (SHIFMANOVITCH). (Lyuba SZYFMANOWICZ died in the Holocaust according to page 314 in this book.)\n\nIt doesn't make sense for a family-name (surname) to be identical to a town name. Someone from Vilna might be named Vilner (not Vilna). Someone from ZHELUDOK might be named ZHELUDKER. That's why I think that Zaludik is correct. An alternate spelling might be Zaludok or Zaludek.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to Lester Solnin (changed from Sosensky) and Marian Anderson, Dave Fessler of Houston, Texas, has a large amount of information. They sent me a paper copy of Dave's family-tree, which is entitled \"Descendants of Eliyohu Zaludik. It is a masterpiece ...\n\nThey also sent me a digitized image (Paperport .MAX file) of a 1-page Report, which is information extracted from Dave's family-tree (database).\n\nDave's email address is dfessler@houston.rr.com. -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpeaking of \"Sosensky\", I vaguely recall seeing a photo of an old bearded man. I think he was a cousin named Sosensky. And I very vaguely recall being told that he was referred to as \"Der Feter\" (\"The Uncle\"). ====================================\n\nI know nothing about the following person:\n\nP Scolnik\n\nLewiston, Maine\n\n207-784-5573 -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI know nothing about the following person (Helen Manpel).\n\nPerhaps she is Ida's sister-in-law or niece?\n\nManpel, Helen\n\n1071 Eglinton West\n\nToronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nTel. 416-782-6465\n\n------------------------------------\n\nSame is true for the following couple: Manpel, Jack & Frida\n\n569 Sheppard Avenue, West\n\nToronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nTel. 416-636-9640 ------------------------------------\n\nThis is Ida's brother (a wealthy merchant?).

There I unexpected ly met a man named Julius Scolnik, of the Bronx, NY. (This is NOT the Julius Scolnik of Lewiston, Maine.)\n\nJulius said that he is a cousin of Kalman Scolnik of Lewiston, Maine. Julius was born circa 1897. At that time, Julius's telephone was 933-1062 (now area-code 718).\n\nOn 5/15/1986 I spoke with Julius by phone. He said that a meeting of the KURENITZER FAREYN had just been held on Sunday, 5/4/1986.\n\n============= RESOURCES ============= *** Jewish Home for the Aged in in Portland, Maine (\"Cedars Campus\") *** My mother Dorothy (OBM) had a best friend.

One of the articles has a reference to Volozhin. I put a link to your website. Here is a link to the article. It's about the Rabbi's of Zabludow Best regards, Tilford Bartman http://www.zabludow.com/chosenpagesleadershipmirsky.html click for the site\n\n- Saturday, June 21, 2003 at 10:31:20 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBronia (Breine) nee Kur Rabinovitz Story\n\nBreine is the daughter of Rivka, daughter of Alexander Volozhinski from Volozhin (Rivkas mother Mtya was from the Bunimovitz family of Volozhin). Breines father was Mordechai Kur whos father was a well-respected scribe (writer of Torah books) in Vileyka; (Koor). Rabbi yakov Landu ZL ABD bnai Brak wrote about Yehoshua Kur in the yizkor book for kurenets;  Amongst the shoemakers I must tell about Moshe Kur the Shoemaker from Dolhinov Street. He was a spiritual Jew and would read with excitement from the Torah. He was also a Kadainov Hasid. His father was Reb Yeoshua, the writer from Vileyka. The son of Moshe, Shlomo Chaim studied Torah in our minyan, and when he arrived at the age where he would be taken to the army, he escaped and went to London. His last name was Koor and from what I heard he became a Hazan in one of the synagogues in London, where he later passed away * The parents of Breine came from very respected religious families and a matchmaker arranged their marriage as the custom of Jews in 1900. The relatives from the groom side said that Rivka did not come to the marriage with the appropriate dowry but she had other qualities to compensate for it. The oldest boy; Avraham was born in 1910, Eliezer was born in\n\nHe was Tamid Chacham a Yeshiva Bachur. A distant cousin; Arie Shevach remembers that there was a time when Eliezer had to serve in the Polish army c 1937. He was station near Krasne and the rabbi of Krasne ordered the family to prepare Kosher food for Eliezer and he would deliver it to Eliezer everyday. Arie was about 12 years old and was getting ready for his Bar Mitzva and Eliezer helped him with some of his studies.\n\nBreine attended the TARBUT school in Horodok. All the subjects [other the mandatory class in the Polish language] were instructed in HEBREW. Breine also attended the tuition free Polish public school for a few years. .\n\nAfter the Soviets took control of the area in September of 1939 and instituted a communist rule in the area Breine.'s oldest sister; Leyka, who owned a coffee store in Horodok knew that she would be classified unfavorably as capitalist so she moved to Vileyka. Vileyka, one of the region's main towns, became an important place for the Soviet municipal authorities and She worked for them.\n\nWhen the German invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941 The Soviet officers and official evacuated the area and crossed by trains the old border (the pre 1939 Poland/ Soviet union border) . Some of them insisted that Breine's sister, along with other Jews in the town who worked for the Soviets, left with them because they knew what the impending German invasion would mean for them. (in some cases the Soviet officials actually pushed Jews they encountered around town onto departing trains without leaving them a moment to return to their homes and families. One Jewish woman, Dora Rabinovitz told me that that she came to Vileyka to work that day wearing a light summer dress and, by chance, carrying a picture of her family in her pocket. She was pushed onto a train and sent to the cold of Russia for more then two years and was the only member of her family to survive E. D)\n\nBreine.'s brother Eliezer was studying in a yeshiva in Poland. In 1939, when the area was given to the Soviets the whole yeshiva received illegally acquired papers from the Japanese ambassador, or assistant to the Japanese ambassador in Lithuania. With these papers, the residents of the yeshiva were allowed to immigrate to China before the German invasion. In China, Breine.'s brother contacted their other brother back in the area of Horodok who subsequently traveled all the way to China so as to bring him back to Poland, where he would later perish in German hands. (He might have never left for China, his brother might have taken him from Lithuania back to Horodok the Soviets would never let anyone without papers go all the way to China and back the papers were very very hard to obtain)\n\nDuring the German occupation Breine and her family first went to a former Christian neighbor and asked him to hide them. However, because they had previously given him their possessions for safe keeping, he was loathe to the idea of saving those who may later ask for his newly acquired, albeit on loan, goods. So, when they asked to be let in, he threatened to kill them\n\n.\n\nBreine and the rest of the family escaped the killing in Horodok and came to the krasne ghetto. Most of the Jews in the krasne ghetto came from towns that were already annihilated. Every time before they annihilated a community, they chose a few Jews who could be useful and transferred them to Krasne. The place was chosen as a supply base for the Germans, where materiel was relayed to and from the front, including a large amount of weapons captured from the Soviets. Thousands of Jews worked in construction, in loading and unloading goods, and in other logistical support positions. Since the ghetto could not contain thousands of workers, the Germans established a labor camp, and they continuously brought Jews from neighboring towns after each action. As in other ghettoes and camps, there was a Jewish committee or Judenrat. At the head of the Krasne Judenrat was Shabtai Oryuk. During the First World War he had been a POW in Germany for a few years and learned to speak German fluently.\n\nShaptai Olyuk and the brothers of the Kaplan house, Yitzhak and Moshe.\n\n. Breine and her family believed that working for the Germans will save them. She worked with other Jewish women and children to lay new train tracks. German soldiers routinely routed out and murdered Jews who were weaker or more feeble than the rest. The food given daily to the Jews who worked for the Germans consisted of one piece of bread with marmalade, and on occasion, a soup made from discarded potato peals. Often, the garbage of non-Jews was served to the Jews as food. Once, B. saw the German soldiers throw a live dog into the soup they were serving and then forced the Jews who had witnessed the event to eat the soup. At another time, a Jewish child returned to ask for an extra helping of soup. Instead of granting his request, the German soldiers put the child into the boiling soup. On one occasion, she spotted some moldy bread in the garbage and treasuring it, picked it out of the trash, eating a little and saving the rest for her family. Some German soldiers saw her and abused her for taking the bread.\n\nThere was one Jew from Horodak who would tell the Germans which Jews were wealthy, in hopes of being spared by the soldiers. Nevertheless, the German soldiers later killed him Breine and her family thought that the Germans needed them as workers so they worked very hard because they thought it would be their ticket to survive. At one point they realized that they should go into hiding in a hidden ditch they had dug for that purpose. Many Jews resorted to living in ditches to escape the Germans. The ditches varied in size - some holding five, others ten, and still others, up to twenty people. Often ditches were designated for different age, and gender groups. While they were in hiding in the ditch and fearful of the German soldiers they knew were near, one of the young girls (about 10 years old) in the ditch with B. and her family started crying for water. A man in the ditch started choking her to silence her. B. Prevented him from killing the girl by pushing him away and placing her hands over the girl's mouth. The young girl is now a doctor in the U.S..\n\nThey had large amounts of gold and while hiding out in the ditch, they decided that the best thing to do would be to offer the wealth to the Germans in return for a promise of security. B was on her way to deliver the gold and solicit such a promise when Zemitre, a Christian from the village, came to her and challenged the logic of her mission. He said, \"Are you crazy? Why are you going back to them? They're killing everyone.\" He then took Breine to his barn and hid her in the area used for storing hay, where she remained for a week.\n\nBreine's family didn't know what had happened to her after she left the ditch. Although everyone left the ditch while Breine was still missing, her family, because they were worried about her whereabouts returned to look for her. Tragically, her family was killed upon their return while the rest of the people who had left the ditch survived.\n\nA neighbor of the Christian who had saved Breine had also taken the risk of hiding a fugitive Jew. When the other neighbors found out they attacked and killed him, and burnt down his house. After this incident, Breine's host was afraid and forced her to leave. For a time she hid where she could, moving from place to place, and eating what she could find, including grass and garbage.\n\nOne farmer who was out searching for eggs in his yard discovered Breine in hiding. He immediately knew who she must be. Terrified, she told him that she knew the location of a large quantity of gold and promised to lead him to it, should he chose to spare her from the Germans. The farmer told her to that he did not need her gold, he will help her but she must wait where she was and left since this occurred shortly after they sloutherred the Jews of Krasne many of the Jewish bodies were left in different areas were they were killed and the Germans were worried that disease would spread yet they did not want to touch the remains and all their Jewish slave workers were killed by them they ordered the local population to get rid of the budies and the man was ordered to do it. B. was certain that he had gone to fetch German soldiers. However, after ten minutes the farmer's wife appeared and offered B. a bowl of soup and a spoon. B. hadn't eaten in a long time, and ravished with hunger, drank the soup straight from the bowl. The farmer's wife cried to seeing her desperate condition.\n\nBreine stayed with the farmer and his wife, living exclusively in their barn for one week. She remained in hiding in the barn because there were many Germans in the area. She was never allowed in the house. Later, they made her a nanny to their children, although she continued to sleep in the barn. Most of the neighbors were never aware of her because of the lengths that B. and the family went to in keeping her presence a secret.\n\nThrough rumors that had spread among the non-Jewish farming residents of the area, Isaac Noll, a Jewish member of the partisans, found out that there was a Jewish girl surviving alone in the area. (B. remarks that it was amazing that the residents had not yet turned her in). Isaac asked them where they could find her and they told her Maruska Kamarouski had her staying with him.\n\nThe partisans Months before the German troops began slaughtering the Jews in KRASNE, many young Jewish men realized what was about to transpire and escaped deep into the surrounding forest where they joined forces with partisan groups already established by Soviets, and especially former Soviet prisoners of war who had been treated as badly as the Jews under the Germans. Together, they began ambushing and killing German soldiers. Much of the local population was afraid of the partisans because the partisans made it clear that anyone found collaborating with the Germans would be killed.\n\nWhen B. initially tried to join the partisans they would not accept her because she came empty handed. However, a younger first cousin of hers (his father was the brother of Breine's mother), Mayer Vol (previously known as Volojinski) ambushed a German and stole his weapon, which he then gave to B. so that she would be accepted in by the partisans. Now this cousin lives in Windsor, Canada.\n\nBreine. returned armed to the partisans, who let her in, and Breine became a member of the Atriad Staritsky. This group of partisans hid out in the forest between the towns of Baranovic and Volozhin, remaining closer to latter. Breine stayed in the forest for one and half years. After staying for awhile with the partisans she came to understand that the Germans were losing the war because, for the first time, she had access to radio broadcasting, and in 1944 they began seeing Allied planes fly overhead.\n\nBreine didn't fight with the partisans, but facilitated their goals in other ways, tending to the livestock and helping out with the cooking. After the war she received medals for her participation in the resistance, but hadn't killed anyone and so felt as though she didn't deserve them.\n\nBreine felt that Jews and Soviets alike were treated equally within the partisan ranks and generally, got along well. She does recall one instance, however, when a Jew by the name of Fole Parovsky went to town to find food with two Soviets, and never returned. The two Soviets claimed he had been killed by German soldiers. However, one partisan by the name of Jaunsh didn't believe their story and started investigating only to find that the Soviets had killed Fole. The partisans had a trial and found one of the Soviets guilty. He was subsequently killed. Breine can only speculate on his motivation, but believes it may have been anti-Semitism. However, this was a rare case.\n\nIn the evenings, the partisans would make communal fires and sit around and sing together. They would sing so loudly and happily that Breine would be afraid that the German soldiers would find them. However, her cousin Isaac reassured her that they were too scared of the partisans to come to the forest that was controlled by the Russian partisans.\n\nOnce the partisans caught a German soldier. This particular German soldier was a special target of their anger because he carried with him numerous photographs of Jews he had killed, (They used to send the pictures to Germany) They ordered everyone to watch while they killed him. Breine covered her face, refusing to watch. However, her cousin chided her, telling her she was crazy to feel any sympathy to Germans who mercilessly killed so many Jews.\n\nThere was a woman named Yokha Rubenshik from Minsk who was a partisan member. When the Germans packed the Jews into train cars to be killed, she and her siblings where among those on the train. Yokha, realizing what their fate must be, pushed her younger brother out of the train. He eventually survived the war and became a dentist. She survived because she worked for the Germans and then escaped. Later, she joined the partisans and was sent by them back to Minsk where she recruited twelve more Jews. Together, this fugitive band removed their stars of David and escaped. However, while they were escaping a German soldier came by. Yokha approached him and spoke to him Russian, knowing that he would recognize her Yiddish accent if she spoke in German. She acted very self-assured and invited the German to eat with her. She emphasized that she had ham to eat and told him to meet her at a particular place and time later that evening. Meanwhile, the other Jews escaped.\n\nTowards the end of the war, when the Germans were clearly losing, a boy from Minsk named Moshe managed to round up thirty Germans who thought they were surrendering and would be made POWs.\n\nWhen the commanders told the partisans that the area was free of German troops, forty Jewish partisans decided to re-enter the city of Volozhin, the closest town. Upon returning they found that many homes and been burnt down and destroyed. Also, this town, previously famous for its large Jewish population had been repopulated by Christians. When the Christians saw that Jews were returning they began to weep and were afraid. However, the group of forty Jews were still scared to disband and live separately, and so they re-occupied only three houses in the town. Because there were so few Jews that had survived the war, this group of survivors became like family to one another.\n\nIt was while staying in this house that Breine met her husband to be. He had spent the war as a soldier in the Red Army in Russia, although he was originally from Breine's hometown of Horodok. As soon as he heard that his home region had been freed by the Red Army, he boarded a train and returned. When he had left for Russia he left behind a wife and two children, who were to perish in the Holocaust. His first wife's name was Blumke, she was a beautiful woman (one of her brothers survived the war and lives iin Israel). Because of her beauty, the Germans wanted to take her to work for them and send her children to be killed, but she insisted on accompanying her children. Everyone knew this story about Blumke and her children and so were able to tell her husband what had happened when they eventually met up with him upon his return.\n\nBreine's future husband returned to find Christians living in his old house. As soon as they saw him, one of the Christians went to look for an axe with which to kill him. Understanding what they were about to do, Breine's future husband jumped out of a window in the house and went for the Soviet police. After this incident, he was too afraid to ask any Christians about what had happened to his family, and couldn't find any Jews in the town. However, he did eventually learn that there were a few Jews living in Volozhin.\n\nWhen he arrived in Volozhin and met Bronia, he immediately asked her to marry him. Since Bronia had come from a religious family she had never looked at another man before him. After getting married they stayed in Volozhin for one year and began selling things from a horse and carriage. Breine's first son was born there. However, like all the other Jews living in Volozhin, Bronia and her husband wanted to leave.\n\nAll of a sudden, Breine's sister who had traveled on a train to Siberia before the German invasion, returned. Her sister had written a letter to a Christian neighbor named Yokobovsky inquiring about her family. Breine happened to return to Horodok with her husband to visit and was given the letter. She responded to her sister's letter from Kemarov, Siberia, writing that the rest of the family had died, but not to grieve because she was still alive. Upon getting the letter, her sister fainted and was taken to the hospital where she spent two months. After recovering, she returned to Volozhin with a Jewish man she had met in Siberia, and lived with Breine. and her husband.\n\nShortly after they arrived in Volozhin they decided to leave for Germany. From Germany they believed they would be able to travel to other countries. They had terrible associations with the town of Volozhin and the surrounding area and couldn't wait to leave. However, when they arrived in Germany they found themselves marooned in refugee camps for a year and a half, which, compared to other fellow refugees, was a short time. As refugees, however, they were allowed to stay in real homes and apartments, which had previously been inhabited by members of the SS.\n\nPart of the problem was that no country wanted to accept them. Although they received free food and goods from the U.S., they were barred from emigrating there. B.'s husband said he didn't want to go to the U.S. anyway and preferred instead to move to Israel where he felt there would be more of an assurance that what had happened to them in Poland would not reoccur.\n\nEventually they were able to travel on a ship named the Queen Anna Maria to Israel. In Israel they lived first in a refugee camp named Binyamina in very difficult\n\nconditions in tents. Later, they settled in Brandeis in Israel\n\nI received emails form other members of the family; Dear Eilat\n\nWonderful to hear Breines story\n\nMy grandfather - Shlomo Hayim, son of Moshe and cousin of Breine had family both in England and in Russia\n\nShlomo Hayim had 4 children\n\nMarie - married name Coleman - Stephen's mother\n\nHenry- my father\n\nHanna - married name Mather\n\nLily/Leah- married name Broza\n\nI moved to Israel from England about 25 years ago.

Porat-Perlman, from VYB p. 345\n\nThere were three synagogues in Volozhin: The Beys Midresh near the Market place, The \"Aroptsu\" Shool on the left shore of the Volozhinka, and the \"Klayzl\" near Vilna Street.\n\nThe caretaker of the Beys Midrash was Itshke der \"Shamesh\" with his assistant \"Leybe der Shamesh\" as a Torah Reader. Kopel Deretshinski served as caretaker and Reader at the Aroptsu Shul (Downhill Synagogue). Moyshe Lavit served as Shamesh at the Vilna Street Klayzl and Moyshe Shloyme der Melamed was the Torah Reader.\n\nRabbi Refoel Shapiro, the Shochett Avreml Perski and all the Yeshiva students prayed at the Yeshiva.\n\nThe \"korobka\" (money box), the yeast and candles were safeguarded by Leybe Eshke's (his daughter Gitl Eshke's lives in the States).\n\nAvreml Perski served as Shochett, Velvl Blokh was the Cantor.\n\nThe town butchers were Yehuda Khayim, Khayim Itskhok Zoosie (his son Yoel lives in the States) and \"Ore der Koltoon\".\n\nBread was supplied by: Zlotke di Bekerke (her son lives in the US), Elke di Bekerke, Sorke di Bekerke, Feytshe di Bekerke, Froome Leyzer's di Bekerke and Hirshl der Beker (His son Beniyomke Kleynbord came to Israel on the ill-fated ship Altalena. He was also a member at the Volozhin Committee}.\n\nMilk was supplied by: Reuven der Arendator (lesse), Golde di arendatorke and Der Arendator from Kapusgtshine.\n\nMy uncle Yudl Mordkhai and Gershon Rogovin were involved In the fish trade. Yudl Mordkhai was a unique person. He was short in stature, stocky and possessed a low-pitched hoarse voice. At that time I write about he was in his sixties. In spite of age he would often carry the heavy fish crates on his shoulders. Both of us prayed in the Klayzl Synagogue. Since he was a deeply religious Jew he abstained from smoking inside the Synagogue. He would not smoke cigar as soon as he would see its entrance, because a god fearing Jew should not smoke near a holy place, it's forbidden. He used to smoke expensive Havana made cigars. I assume that the entire income from his Fish enterprise vanished up in smoke He was a guest in our home during every holiday. We honored and respected him tremendously.\n\nR' Yudl Mordkhai traveled to America numerous times. After spending a few weeks in the state he would yearn to be in Volozhin.. On the same token after returning to Volozhin he would long to be in the States  So, he became accustomed to taking his bundle and journeying to Volozhin. And a short time later he would gather the same bundle and return to the States.\n\nIn his eyes Volozhin and America were like a chamber and its waiting room. He used to consider a back and forth journey from New York to Volozhin as a cart and horse trip from Volozhin to Minsk as Avrom Leyb would often take, or as 40 kilometers travel by foot from Volozhin to Rakov that Hayim Der Galentreyshtchik's would undertake.\n\nWhen he was still very much alive he arranged for burial garments for himself. Leah Yoel Ore's measured him for the shrouds. Reb Yudl Mordkhe paid her amply for it. Than he bought a burial place and paid for it to the \"Khevre Kadishe\" with good money. \"I want to arrange and provide all that I am able to now in order to avoid any disputes or misunderstandings after I pass away\" he would often tell me.\n\nMoyshe Shlomo der Rebe, Moyshe Fayve, Simkhe der Melamed from Greyevo and Reb Ele-Itshe Dveyre Elkes der Melamed served as \"Melamedim\"(in Hebrew/Yiddish it means teachers in Kheyder-religious teaching rooms) in Volozhin:.\n\nVolozhin teachers in the \"modern Version\" Hebrew language were: Avrom Gorelik (left Volozhin with his family to the States), Pesakh Yerosolimski and Kamenstein from Mizheyki.\n\nMikhl-Gavriel with his son Hershl, Yudl der Stoler (Yudl the carpenter), Myshl Shimen's and Zalmen Shaybe's were engaged in the carpentry profession.\n\nThe shoemaking in Volozhin was executed by Leyzer Itshe der Shooster, Itshe Getsl, Alter Dvoshke's, Hershl der Greysser, Avrom Itshe the cobbler, and Hershl Elke's (his son lives in Israel).\n\nThe blacksmiths were the brothers Ruven der Shmid, Avrom, Zalmen Wolf, Sane der Zilaner (his son lives in Israel), Moyshe Yoyne and Avreml (his daughters lives in Israel).\n\nTin smiths were Ben Ziyon der Blekher (tinker) and his sons.\n\nLeybe Kaganovitsh der Glezer was the sole Glazier in shtetl.\n\nHome builders were the brothers Fayve, Yehoshua and Matess der Muller (the stove mason) and also the family of the \"pool-Zhidkes\" (Half Jews).\n\nPharmacies owners were Itshe Shriro (son and two daughters in Israel) and Avrom Berkovitsh (daughter Shoshana Nishri in Israel).\n\nAlter and Meyshke were the town barbers.\n\nThere was no running water in Volozhin. Water was drawn from wells by a bucket on a rope and brought home in a pair of buckets suspended on a rod \"Koromislo\", from the shoulders.\n\nBut it was a possibility to buy the water on the door sill from Hirshl Der Wasser Feerer , Itshe Tane's and his son Ore who was called \"Ore der zavoznik\". Each one of them transported a barrel of water on a horse cart and sold it to house kipper women.\n\nCircumcising used to be executed by the town's Feldsher (paramedic) Avrom Tsart.\n\nThere were no dental surgeon's in Volozhin; Dentists from Minsk visited from time to time the shtetl.\n\nThe only grist mill owner in pre-war Volozhin was Michael Wand-Polak (passed away in Israel).\n\nWine could be bought in two stores; one owned by Yoohanan Rodke's (The Rebetsin Haye Feyge Unterman's father), the second one by Moyshe Perlman (his grand son lives in Israel- now translating this article to English).\n\nCloths merchants, providing materials for the shtetl inhabitants and for peasants in surrounding hamlets, were Avrom Shuker, Bashke Mendl's and Rela Levin.\n\nThe brothers Mikhl and Moyshe Weisbord, Yankl Rudenski brothers and Levin were flax traders.\n\nAvrom Leyb Kooshke's and Avremke Oyzer's owned the Matses baking \"factories\"\n\n\"Kushke der Amerikaniets\" did manage the \"Talmud Toyre\" school.\n\nThe single boarding house in town belonged to Velvl Zelig Pshtsholke. Beer was sold by Yosl-Yankl Skloot; Soda water- \"Seltsn Wasser\" has been produced by Yankev Shepetnitski (his son in Israel). Ele-Meyshe Goldes sold grain.\n\nVodka was a monopoly product. It was sold in two stores only; one was situated at the market place, the second one that belonged to the Gendarme Bokshtanovitsh was placed \"Aroptsoo\". Each autumn, when young men were called to serve in the Tsar's army a scandal would break out near the vodka selling stores. The \"prizivniki\" (the called to report) from Baksht, Nalibok and Derevnie, on their way to Oshmena stopped in Volozhin. The authorities ordered immediately to close all the stores. The \"Novobrantsi\" (the freshly mobilized) intended to break into the liquor store, but the \"pristav\", the Ooriadnik (Police officers) and militia men defended the shtetl, its stores and population with drawn swords.\n\nTwo Russian orthodox churches (tserkov) functioned at that time In Volozhin and a Polish Catholic church (Kostiol). The relations between the Jews, the \"Pop\"  the orthodox priest and the \"Ksiondz\" - the Polish one were friendly.\n\nThe graph's estate was situated In the town center and in its middle sat the Palace. The count's children, the \"Graphtshiks\" lived near Vilna by their grand-mother. They spent their summer time vacations in Volozhin. The count's estate was surrounded by a magnificent orchards of fruit trees. Some families would lease the orchards in common. Only a few elected persons would be permitted by Zhoovirko, the orchards-guard, to enter inside this Volozhin Paradise.\n\nA group of Volozhin children once discovered a brand new, until that point never seen by them, red fruit growing inside the garden by the orchards. It was an unfamiliar plant to Russia, the tomato. Its color and beauty attracted the children. They chose a dark night to sneak inside the garden and quickly flee away with some fruit specimens. After successfully escaping they assembled to taste the fairy fruit. They cut the specimens and divided and tasted the trophies. And as great as their expectations were so immense were the disappointments. They foresaw a paradise of sweetness, but they encountered acidity and sharp taste. The tomato became known in Volozhin as the \"Khazershe Eppele\"- \"the piggish apple\" (I heard The story told also by my father, he was one of the adventures children translator's note).\n\nYosef Yoozl Perski, the \"Starosta\" served as head of the Kehila. His son Shimon Perski (his son in Israel) has been the Volozhin Rabbi \"on behalf of\".\n\nVolozhin was situated on the intersection of the Vilna-Minsk road with the way to Novogrudek. The shtetl received an abundant number of visits of beggars and emissaries, so the Starosta's hands were full with work.\n\nThe shtetl tailors to whom the profession passed by inheritance were Khayim der Shnayder, Yankev der Blinder (sightless), Beniyomke der Ainbinder amd Ayzik Minke's. The hatter was \"Yankl Der Kirzhner\".\n\nShimon Di Bord was repairing the tile-roofs.\n\nKhayim Meyer Shaye's was engaged in rags dealing.\n\nThere were two railway stations, Listopad and Polotshan, both situated some twenty kilometers from the town. The passengers were conveyed by Peretz the prodigious who originally came to Volozhin as Yeshiva student and by Itshe the Tsar's soldier \"Nikolayevskiy Soldat\"\n\nDespite of the fact that The distance from Volozhin to Minsk was 80 Km and to Vilna more than hundred. Anyway 98% of Volozhin trade and commerce was made through Vilna. The sole dealer who used to buy goods in Minsk and to supply it to the Volozhin shops was Avrom Leyb Shmuel's (Rogovin  his two sons are in Israel).\n\nMr. Heler, the renowned forest trader, had bought huge forests from the count Tishkevitsh. It was an important source of bread winning for the town and its vicinity.\n\nMany Volozhin inhabitants worked in the woods as forest specialists, and in the Company's offices. Among the specialists were Menahem Yoel Potashnik (his grand children in Israel), Isroel Kaplan, Alter Bunimovitsh, Yosef Kaganovitsh, Moyshe Rogovin, Eyliyohu Brudno, Tsvi Elyashkevitsh, Meyir Levin, Hayim Shulman (his son in Israel) and Hirsh Yuzefovitsh (his daughter in Israel). As manager of the forest exploitation served Tsvi-Hirsh Malkin* (his son Osher Malkin* lives now in Israel).\n\n*Translator's note: Tsvi-Hirsh Malkin, the translator's Grand Father with his wife Haya-Riva were murdered by the Fascists in Volozhin on May 10, 1942. Osher Malkin the Tanslator's uncle (his mother's brother) made aliya to Israel in 1952.He served 15 years as Manager of Mikveh Israel, the famous agriculture school near Tel Aviv. Osher Malkin passed away during the fall 1973 Yom Kippur war in Holon, Israel.\n\n.\n\n- Saturday, June 07, 2003 at 13:17:10 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n....In every village a Jewish family or two remains. These are the people who have the keys to the Jewish cemetery and who show visitors the way to the buildings that were once yeshivos or homes of rabbonim. In Volozhin it is Moshe Alterman who performs this function. He, his wife, and his daughter live isolated among the gentiles. Their life is not easy in the material sense, and it is certainly not easy to live with the memories that stare them in the face. Opposite the Alterman home is the mass grave where the Jews of Volozhin were slaughtered. \"Every morning when I open my eyes,\" says Mrs. Alterman in tears, \"I see the spot where they murdered my mother.\"\n\nIn Mir one Jew is left alive. Likewise in Radin. In Rakov, the hometown of R. Osher Katzman, where his uncle R. Avrohom Kalmanowitz zt\"l served as rav, not a single Jew remains. All the local inhabitants know of Jews is the story of how the Nazis herded them all into the synagogues and burned them alive.\n\nIn Kovno there are still Jews, not all of whom are aware of their history. Chatzkel Zak, the gabai who used to act as tour guide to Jewish visitors, emigrated to the United States a few months ago, so we find our way with the help of Yehudah Ronder, who speaks perfect Hebrew and is excited to meet us. Listening to the exchange between him and R. Leib Baron, we are impressed once again by R. Leib's acute memory.The first time had been when Moshe Alterman had come to unlock the gates of the Volozhin cemetery for us. R. Leib remembered that he had known a family called Alterman in his childhood hometown, Horodok. Soon the two of them were reminiscing about their youths and R. Leib was recalling various members of the Alterman family by name, wondering what had become of them.Now, as we meet Yehuda Ronder, we are just as astonished as R. Leib recalls that he and his friends from Yeshivas Mir had stayed with a family called Ronder during their escape from the Nazis. Our guide is almost struck speechless. To think that sixty years later he is face to face with one of the Mirrer bochurim that his family had taken in. \"I never dreamed I would be zoche to such a miracle, to meet Jews like you and walk with you on Lithuanian ground,\" he says. On the way, Ronder reminds us repeatedly that the Nazis had plenty of help in their work from local citizenry. He sees it as one of his life's purposes to try to bring these criminals to justice....\n\nclick for the site\n\n- Wednesday, June 04, 2003 at 05:43:47 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi,\n\nMy name is Joshua Sklut.

The family originated in Volozhin or Vishnevo (in both places they had many relatives). Shimon and Raisel Rocha lived in Krasne. Shimon was a blacksmith who had a great talent for making gadgets and all his grandchildren enjoyed the great toys he made for them Other then Miryam Shimon and Reise Rocha had;\n\n1. A daughter; Sarah who married Baruch Kaganovitz who had family in Volozhin and Horodok they had a son ; Motel who was born c 1930 and a daughter who was much younger. The family perished in Krasne.\n\n2. A son; Yakov Sklut who was born in 1900. Yakov was a blacksmith. He had three children; Chaika was born in Krasne in 1924, Asher in 1925 and Motel in 1927. The family perished in Krasne.\n\n3. A son Moishe Itzha; He had seven children and passed away in his sleep. Shortly after, his wife passed away. At that point of time there were no organized institutions to take care of Jewish orphans. To be an orphan most time was a \"verdict\" of desuetude. The grandfather; Shimon ordered his other children to divide the seven children amongst the three of them and raise them as their own. As it was the custom at the time to respect and obey the father, they did as they were told. The two who grew up with Arie were Hirshl and Asher. Hirshl was sent to the Volozhin yeshiva and would come home for the holidays. When he reached the age of service in the Polish army, everything was done to make him \"undesirable\" for service since he was religious and in the polish army you could not keep Kosher rules. The most common way was to be underweight for service. He took the usual route of barely eating and drinking strong tea. He would get up early in the morning and go by foot all the way to Molodetchno and back, a distance of about 32 km. And after a month he went to the draft board in hope that he would be found unfit and be discharged. Since the Polish authorities recognized that some young men purposely did such things, they gave him a postponement, and he had to do a similar routine to avoid service until he was finally, permanently discharged.\n\nThere was another one, Motl, who Arie met in Vilna. He was studying to become a teacher there. Later on, they were able to escape the Nazis and join the partisans, and there they met again, but Motl Sklut was killed when the Germans started retreating in 1944, when he was guarding a partisan camp. The Germans, who wanted to clear the area so that they could retreat a little more easily, attacked the camp and he was killed.\n\nAryes' mother; Miryam first married Shmuel Kelman and had a daughter, Dvora born in 1915. Dvora married and her last name became Einharver, which is now Ein Habbar in Hebrew. When Miryam was still pregnant with Dvora her husband passed away under tragic circumstances immediately after World War 1. At a late night hour, robbers came to the house. They broke in and killed Shmuel Kelman. This phenomenon was common at the time, as lawlessness was widespread.\n\nThe area of Krasne was since the 1790's under Russian rule. Just about that time Katherine the great traveled from Moscow to her parent's mansion in Keningsburg. Traveling at that horse did time and carriage and deferent locations for changing horses and resting were designated for her ahead of time. The places were named for her mood when she arrived; Radoshkovichi (happinesss) and Krasne (to do with red blood). There were many other places named Krasne and this Krasne was also known as Krasne nu Uzsha (Krasne near Uzsha)\n\nIn 1921 Poland took control of the area. Poland also took control of Vilna, the former capital of Lithuania, the rest of Lithuania became independent.\n\nBinyamin Shevach was born in Pieski to Arie Leib and Zlate Shevach in 1900. What was the origin of the name Shevach is unclear but family legend is that an ancestor who originated in France (and maybe before in Spain later came to Germany and eventually other ancestors came to the area of Lithuania/ Poland,\n\nArie Leib and Zlate Shevach had Other then Binyamin\n\n2. Chanoch Shevach who had a business of alcohol which a Jew at that time was not allowed to own (1935 or 1936). When the authorities found out about his business and were about to arrest him he was able to escape and immigrate to South Africa.\n\n3.Yosef Shevach lived in Vilna and was married before 1939. (perished in Vilna)\n\n4.Shalom Shevach lived in Vilna and was a pharmacist he was single (perished in Vilna)\n\n5. Sarah nee Shevach Las was married in Shtzotzin . She had a son ; Arie Leib they perished in Shhtzozin.\n\nArie Leib died in 1924 or 1925, and in the 1930s his widow lived in Vilna.\n\nDuring the war Binyamin was taken to serve in the cavalry of the Polish Army. His brother Chanoch was a true entrepreneur with a lot of initiative, and succeeded in getting him discharged from the service. Then the family moved to Vilna. He married Miryam from Krasne. In 1930 Binyamin and Miryam Shevach had another son\n\nDvora was a devout Zionist. She was a member of \"HaChalutz\" in Krasne and in the 1930s went to \"HaChshara\" Preparation for becoming Chalutz (pioneer ) in Eretz Israel. Young Jewish men and women would live together in communities in Eastern Europe and earn money by doing difficult manual labor in preparation for doing agricultural work in a Kibbutz in Israel. Dvora spent about eighteen months in the Hachshara and when she ended her training she went back to Krasne to await her certificate form the British to be able to immigrate to Israel, that was at the time under their control. The British gave very limited amounts of certificates, after a long wait Dvora decided to join \"Bitar\". \"Bitar\" was the most popular Zionist movement in Krasne in the 1930s. Unlike HaChalutz and hashomer Hatzair who had a Socialist Zionist core Bitar had no Socialist ideology and had a more \"militaristic\" dogma. Eventually Dvora as other members of \"Bitar\" used Aliah Stavski, which was illegal Aliah. Stavski was a businessman and a member of the Zionist Revisionist party that established a route of illegal immigration. They embarked on a Greek ship . The original boat they went on was sunk after a storm that pushed the boat near rocks by the Greek shore, but the second boat was able to make it.\n\nArie spend six years in the Krasne \"Tarbut\" Schol.\n\nEvery vacation Arie would visit his Shevach family in Vilna. He would go there with accompanied by a family member about three times a year.\n\nTo go from Krasne to Vilna in the 1930s you would take a train. There was a train station in Krasne that was about 150 kilometers from Vilna. The trip took six hours. When Arie was about eleven years old his parents let him take the trip all by himself. When he arrived in the train station in Vilna he hired a horse and carriage to take him to his grandmothers' house.\n\nWhen Arie graduated from the Tarbut School the family decided to send him to a Gimnasia in Vilna. In order to attend the Gimnasia he needed to attend seven school grades. Since the Tarbut school only contained six grades the only choice in Krasne was the Polish public school which he attended for one year.\n\nArie attended the Gimnasia in Vilna only for a short time.\n\nIn September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Polish forces were overwhelmed by the Germans' might, and there was great fear in Horodok, but shortly after the invasion, people found out that there was a secret pact with the Soviet Union, a non-aggression pact, and Poland was divided between the two countries. Shortly after, the Polish officials and army quickly retreated from the area. They were replaced by huge Soviet Army. A never-ending parade of tanks came into town.\n\nThe first to be deported to Siberia for counter-Revolutionary activities were the asdoniks. They asdoniks were Polish veterans of war who because of their service to Poland, received land that was overwhelmingly settled by Belarussians.\n\nAlso sent to Siberia were the wealthier Polish schlachtas.\n\nArie was sent to a Russian school in Molodetchno. With him were three other guys from Horodok, amongst them Mendel Greenhouse. They lived together in the house of a Jewish woman in Molodetchno. The Soviet schools had no particular days for a day off, since there was no religion, the day off would arbitrarily be the seventh day depending on when the school year started. So Arie and his friends would stay in Molodetchno for six days, and on the seventh day they would take the train to Krasne, which only took half an hour. They lived at the Jewish home because the family wanted them to keep kosher. But about keeping the Shabbat, it wasn't possible. In the Polish schools, prior to this time, when they had to go to the Shabbat, they could sit in the class and not take notes. But in Soviet times this was clearly forbidden.\n\nJune 22, 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union. The Jewish people of Krasne were in shock. Although there was a train station nearby in Krasne, no residents were allowed. They were filled with soldiers and officials of the USSR. Only one family, the Brudner family of Krasne, succeeded in getting on a military train that took them deep in the Soviet Union, and they survived. For three days, Arie and his family tried to cross the old Polish-Russian border. They arrived there on horse and carriage, and found thousands of people trying to cross, but the Red Army stood, armed, in different areas and prevented them from crossing. Arie's father thought he knew of a place to cross and they went there, but by the time they got there the Germans had reached the area. So they had no choice but to return to Krasne. As soon as they returend they locked themselves at home, in panic. It took a week and the Germans entered. They immediately put announcements on the buildings, telling all Jews that from now they were not allowed to walk on the sidewalk, that they had to wear a yellow Jewish star on their arms, that they had curfew hours, and one night at a very late hour they surrounded their homes and kicked everyone out and put them in certain designated homes, surrounding it with barbed wire. IT was a square that contained Radishkoviczi street to Horodok Street. As we later found out, the Germans planned long before conquering the area that Krasne would be designated a base for a large battalion of supply troops. It was used as a transit point for things coming from the west as well as the pillage that was coming from the front in the east.\n\nThe Jews were told to establish a Judenrat, and Shabtai Orloch, a watchmaker who spoke German fluently since he had been a POW in Germany during WWI, became now the head of the Judenrat. Once in a while, the Germans would order the Judenrat to bring them cash, leather for boots, fabrics for clothing, and other supplies and if they wouldn't do it in time, they would kill or torture a few Jews. Arie was sent to cut trees with other Jews from Krasne. One time when he was out in the forest he found pamphlets dropped by Soviet planes calling for the local population to arm themselves and to fight the Germans. Strangely, none of these pamphlets reached the town. They were to be found only deep in the forest.\n\nMeanwhile they started bringing in other Jews from other towns to work in Krasne, and they established a labor camp there. The young people who came from Horodok and Volozhin and had already lost their families and wanted to fight the Germans. They dreamed of joining the partisans, and when they had the opportunity they started stealing rifles from the Germans and hiding them in the ghettoes and camps to prepare for the day they would escape and join the partisans. They were eventually able to gather 25 semi-automatic rifles, but the Judenrat found out about it and started torturing the young men and threatening to hurt their family members until they gave them some of the weapons. As it turns out they gave some of the weapons through their own fmily members, though the reason they gave for asking for the weapons was that the Germans would kill the entire Jewish community if they found out. At the same time, many Red Army soldiers who escaped when the area fell to Germany, and lived in the forest and worked in the villages, were starting an anti-German movement. In the beginning of 1942 the whole movement was very disorganized. There were no leaders, just armed bands . But slowly, the people from the Soviet Union started communicating with them and it became more and more organized. Yitzhak Rogovin from Horodok was able to establish a connection and escape and join the partisans . There were another ten or twelve people who were already with weapons. In order to join you needed to have weapons. Anyway, Yitzhak Rogovin sent a Christian by the name of Salvostrovich, a villager from a nearby hamlet, to the ghetto to take Arie out. He was able to help him escape and they went together by horse and buggy to the area of the partisans. As it turned out, Yithak Rogovin had to go on a mission and couldn't meet him there. Meanwhile, although Arie was able to establish connections with the partisans, he had to go back to the ghetto because the Judenrat found out he hsd escaped, so they threatened his parents and sent a Jewish person to look for him. When he found him, the person claimed the Judenrat would do something to his parents if he didn't return, and he added that if he didn't return th whole ghetto would be destroyed. So he returned, but he escaped two other times, but returned. Others escaped, but when they met with the partisans they would either be killed for their weapons, or their weapons would be taken from them and they were sent away. Eventually the last escape was in January of 1943. Although his father would get upset with him for escaping, thinking that he could cause the killing of the rest of the Jews and that if they worked hard for the Germans they would survive At that point, the Krasne camp was the last place where Jews were still alive. All the other communities in the area had been annihilated. Yet he still had hope that they would be needed. His mother, on the other hand, was not so delusional, and she said to him, I support you in your decision, maybe you'll escape to the forest, and maybe you'll be the one remnant of our family who will survive. Anyway, he was able to establish communications with the Partisans, and it was a unit by the name of Andreyov, and also was called Sovietski Byelorussia. Storitzky and Layev were the leaders. His father worked for the Germans in the mill. Arie as well as the other Jewish partisans realized that soon time would come when the Nazis would annihilate the rest of the Jews in Krasne, and they got permission to bring the rest of the family to the forest. But in March of 1943, Krasne camp was annihilated. On the same day, the unit where Arie was, went to put explosives on the train tracks, and on their way they saw Christians with sleighs filled with their plunder from the ghetto. They wrote down the names of those who took all the pillage. As it turned out, the Jews were concentrated in two places, one group in the ghetto, one in the camp. They were ordered to unrobe, and there they were taken through the entire town, and were watched by the local population, who were cheering while they were walking naked. They were taken to a barn that once belonged to Strikoviczh, who was a very wealthy person. The Jews were locked in there and they put about 800 Jews in the barn, then the Germans spilled oil all around it and lit it on fire, and the Jews were burned alive.\n\nDuring his time as a partisan, Arie carried out many demolitions missions . At one point, Arie was wounded and was taken by plane into the Soviet Union to recover. He was questioned by the NKVD about who he was and the details of his service, and when he said that he served for the unit Andreyev, he realized that they looked at him as if he had said something very wrong. They said such a unity didn't exist. After further checks, they found his name in a unit called something like Belarussia for the Soviets. In 1994, when he was invited to Minsk to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their liberation, someone from there who served with him was able to give him his personal records and Arie realized that even in the forest they kept detailed personal records of everyone who took part in the fight, and there it did say that he served in the unit Andreyev. As it turned out, Andreyev was someone who fell out of favor with Stalin, and you couldn't name a heroic unit with such a name. Although the Russian partisans who were out of touch with the politics in the Soviet Union, when they needed to find a name they chose the name of an old hero....\n\n.\n\n- Wednesday, May 21, 2003 at 12:20:25 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLEASE I DON LAND HEREOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nMUGUMAN <GUYMAMAN@YAHOO.COM>\n\nLONDON, USA - Saturday, May 17, 2003 at 07:54:35 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShprintza nee Weisbord from Volozhin married a Persky from Volozhin.

Through rare films, photographs, memorabilia, music, and interviews with survivors of the lost culture, the film brings to life the full range of the Jewish experience in the years before the disaster.\n\nSubject(s): Jewish Life in Poland Pre-World War II\n\nVendor: Zenger Video HaRav Yechezkel Sarna was born in Horodok Russia, in 5650 (1890). His father was R' Yaakov Chaim, a maggid meishorim in Horodok and Slonim, who became famous for his outstanding rhetoric as the maggid of Slonim. His mother Eidel stemmed from the Buxenbaum family.Like all of the other children of the period, he began his education in the local cheder. His father, who recognized young Yechezkel's talents, sent him when he was still very young to various yeshivos in the area. Yechezkel wandered from yeshiva to yeshiva, until his older brother, Reb Leib finally brought him to Slabodke in Kovno, where he began to study in the Or HaChaim yeshiva ketana, known locally as Yeshivas Rebbe Herschel. The mashgiach at that time, Reb Eliyahu Laicrovits, planted mussar roots in young Yechezkel's heart.Yechezkel remained in Slabodke for only a year. In 5662 (1902), he journeyed to Maltshe, where he studied under one of the most famous Torah giants of the time, HaRav Zalman Sender Kahana-Shapiro, who also presided as the Chief Rabbi of Maltshe. Due to an inner conflict which occurred in the yeshiva, Reb Zalman Sender left Maltshe, and transferred to Kriniki. This was only a year after Yechezkel had arrived in Maltshe. However, without a mentor, he too left Maltshe and returned in 5663 to Slabodke, in order to study in Knesses Beis Yitzchok, headed by HaRav Chaim Rabinowitz, who later on became known as Rav Chaim of Telz. He was very fond of the youth, who became bar mitzvah that year, and recognized his brilliance of mind and swift grasp. When Rev Chaim was invited to deliver shiurim in Telz, at the end of 5664, he included the young Yechezkel in the group of well known Torah scholars who were schooled in halocho.In the beginning of the winter of 5666 (1906), the young Yechezkel once more returned to Maltshe, in order to study under HaRav Shimon Shkop.Another year passed, and Reb Shimon left Maltshe. Under the influence of the son of the Alter, HaRav Shmuel Finkel, the young Yechezkel, who was by then seventeen years old, decided to return to Slabodke.5667 (1907) was the most important year in the life of Reb Yechezkel. His searching and wandering had ended, and he decided to remain in Slabodke -- and he remained there until his final day.Slabodke itself wandered first to Eretz Yisroel in Chevron the city of the forefathers, and then to Geula in Yerushalayim, but he always remained in Slabodke. He never left it. Regarding this, he later said that he was very grateful to Reb Shmuel Finkel for having drawn him into the Slabodke life.End of Part I\n\n.\n\n- Thursday, May 15, 2003 at 20:31:53 (PDT)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAllderdice sophomore Daniel Love will receive the Young Humanitarian of the Year Award at the annual conference of the Pennsylvania Association for Gifted Education (PAGE).

Moshe's parents met when his father attended the Volozhin Yeshiva and he had a \"Keset\" (room and board) at the house of of the Weisbord family in Volozhin.\n\nEster nee Weisbord had four sisters;\n\n1. ? Married a Persky in Volozhin and had two daughters; Gitel born c 1912 and Zila born c 1916. Gitel was married before the war. The family perished in Volozhin.\n\n2. Shoshke married Yisrael Mayzel and lived in Horodok. At one point they immigrated to the U. S and some of their children were born there. The family returned to Horodok were the mother died. some of their children went to Cuba and in 1950 went to Luisiana.the rest of the family perished in Horodok.\n\n3. Bela, a twin sister to Ester went to Louisiana (Shreveport) she had a family there.\n\n4. Chana married a lampart and perished in Volozhin.\n\nMoshes' father; Yosef Baran had a brother; Hirshel Leib Baran who moved to Kurenets after his wife died. one of his sons also moved to Kurenets. Hirshel perished in Kurenets. His son escaped to the forest and was later killed. Moshe had twin sisters; Mina and Musha, they were born in 1928 his brother Yehoshua was born in 1922.\n\nIn 1928 the family moved to Rakov. The father had a leather factory there. Yakov Lifshitz was Moshes' teacher in Rakov. Pruma nee Shulman lifshitz (Yakov's wife) was his teacher in Horodok.\n\nThe family lived in Rakov until 1932 and then returned to Horodok.\n\nMoshes' father and one of his sisters perished in the holocaust. Moshe, his mother, his brother Yehoshua and the other sister were sent to the work camp in Krasne.\n\nOne time when Moshe was working on the rail road for the Germans two Jews from Warsaw were working near by. They were ordred to put away some Russian weapon that the Germans found.Moshe and the guys were able to hide some of it and take it to the Ghetto. in January of 1943 a Jewish woman asked Moshe to help her to escape with her two children (7 and 9) she told him that she knew of a forest were other Jews from the area were hiding and she would take him there if he would help them.\n\nMoshe took his weapon and escaped with the woman and her children. They arrived in the area of Kramnitz near Ilja and found the Jews. Since Moshe had weapon he became a member of the partisan unit Hanokem (Masitel) the leader was Lunin and the Komisar was Patashkevitz.\n\nMoshe was able to help his mother, sister and brother escape from the Krasne camp on March 17,1943 two days before the camp was annihilated. Moshe served with the partisans until 1944. in the spring of 1944 when the Germans knew that they had lost the war in the East (Of Europe) they started a huge blockade against the partisans. Moshe and his unit were hiding in the marshes for many days.\n\nMoshes' Mother; Ester was the only Jewish mother in Horodok who survived the Holocaust. after the war ended the family was on the way to Israel when the family of Ester's sisters in Shreveport, Louisiana found out that they survived. They pleaded with them to join them in the U. S. They were well of and helped them to settle in America.\n\nToday Moshe lives in Pittsburgh next to his sister. Yehoshua lives in Los Angeles.\n\nMoshe told me that some years ago he visited Yisrael Garber the son of the Shochet of Hordok who now lives in New York. Yisrael had a movie that was made in Horodok in 1933 by Dov Shapira who was born in Horodok.\n\nDov left Horodok when he was 13. He did well in America and in 1933 he and his wife came for a visit and Ga"
