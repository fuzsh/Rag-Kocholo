        "text": "ENTERTAINMENT B8 The Weekend Sun, Saturday, March 8, 1997 Music business worth $340 million, 7,300 jobs This joint is really jumping: Who's who in Vancouver music, and how they sound Continued from B1 ,14 6.4p;!-A4'..!..-A,;;.,!,,it.74::4114(it, V141, 1 $4 i -71 11, :1.:,: kl i' ft; :1k.4.:..!.i.,:.::4:..:IN'.:...!:5,'\":-?:.:f i It 1t tNICIF.11 A. V4i'''' LI -A. 7.I Other \"local acts\" to pull off the same feat include Alberta ex-pat, k.d. lang, who signed direct to SireReprise in the same year and Vancouver rock poster boy Bryan'Adams, who signed with in the early '80s after proving himself as a songwriter for BTO, Joe Cocker and Juice Newton. \"In 1986, people started to look at Vancouver differently,\" says Porteous .\n\nZ' Indeed, when Expo turned the eyes of the world toward the little city nuzzled in the bosom of the Coast Mountains, it marked a turning point for Vancouver's Music scene. After wheezing through the early'70s and an endless supply of top-40 cover bands taking up residence in local koms, fans of original live music were finally starting to see some light on local 'stages. In addition to folkies like Ferron, who played the coffee house circuit alongside Bim (Roy Forbes) and Valdy, a bunch of misfit revolutionaries started playing music the loudest way they knew how. By the late '70s, Vancouver was a thriving punk sanctuary with local heroes like Art Bergmann, Buck Cherry, iftandy Valentino, Dimwit and the whole DOA crew who successfully put Vancouver on the hip city world map. But after a five-year punk fire, the scene succumbed to the rise of disco cullture and a taste for things big, hairy and arena-bound .\n\nLocal acts like Loverboy soon eclipsed punk and pushed the remaining alternative tendrils back into the rich, dark, loamy soil of the Lower Mainland. REVIVAL MEETING: Ray Condo and the Ricochets helped bring country back jobs. Included in that province-wide figure are 100 sound recording studios, more than 200 venues, countless managers, agents, publicists, media, labels and distributors. Within the bulk figures, there's a wider-than-ever spectrum of services and product. On one side of the equation, you have such high-end professionals as Bruce Fairbairn and his Armory Studio, where world-class acts like the Cranberries and INXS have tracked .\n\nOn the other, you've got the Turtle Studios of the city where non-label acts can produce themselves and each other for a fair price. According to people like Porteous, B.C. and specifically Vancouver has created an economy of scale that allows bands to survive. They may not thrive, but they're given the opportunity to develop. Vancouver has attracted more bands from other parts of the country .\n\nIn fact, many of the major signings out of Vancouver are with bands that only moved to the Lower Mainland recently. Age of Electric, for instance, moved to Vancouver from the Prairies in 1992. Lured by the laid-back lifestyle, the existing music community and more venues per capita than every other city in the country save Toronto, the band assimilated into the sloshing music gene pool alongside other emigres including Holly McNarland, lang, McLachlan, Ray Condo and John Bottomley. The constant stream of new and developing talent flowing in and out of the city has added a new dimension to the local scene: cross-pollination and mutant spores. In fact, one of the sole defining features to Vancouver's music community is just how much it shares itself .\n\nBand overlap is at an all-time high, allowing artists to try new things, weave new textures and once again, create something unique. couver's whole identity is based on this idea of It's never going to be Toronto.\" several reasons chief among them being its geographical location. \"Vancouver is West Coast. Its close proximity to Los Angeles and Seattle gives bands a better chance at being heard by a larger, especially American, audience,\" Jordan says from his Toronto office after spending five days in Vancouver watching the local offerings. \"There's a real concentration of great bands coming out of Vancouver right now best of all, they're all doing something quite different.\" Porteous says there are good bands all -L' -L A non-exhaustive look at some of the bands cresting the Vancouver wave: AGE OF ELECTRIC A rock-pop outfit formed in 1989 in Lanigan, Sask .\n\nAge of Electric pursued the indie route for more than six years. When the band moved to Vancouiter in 1992, it continued as an independent until reaching the highest chart position of any independent in 1994. Majors came courting and AOE signed a distribution and licensing agreement with Universal in Canada, a management deal in New York and a U.S.-worldwide deal with Mercury in the States. Side projects from AOE members include Limblifter and the Bloody Chicletts. Age of Elec .\n\ntric's major-label debut, Make A Pest a Pet, hit Canadian retail in February. TAL BACHMAN: Son of Randy, Tal Bachman is considered an emerging singer-songwriter who writes \"timeless\" music. Tal was discovered via a demo tape that the elder Bachman placed in the hands of Neil Young's sound engineer, Greg Archilla. The tape made its way to a handful of L.A. industry watchers .\n\nAfter a showcase in the Big Apple, Bachman was signed by the president of Columbia Records to a multi-record international deal. He is currently in the process of writing songs for his debut. BIF NAKED: Radio queen and tat- tooed priestess, Naked is a hard rock howler and alternative diva who broke through with the catchy single, Daddy's Gettin' Married two years ago. Naked recently spent Grammy week in New York and signed a worldwide deal with Sony Music. Her new record, a spoken word project called Oken-spay Ord-way comes out at the end of the month and she starts pre-production on a new record next week at the Armory Studio .\n\nCUB: One of the founding bands to coin the term \"cuddlecore,\" cub write cute, poppy tunes with poignant lyrics. Written up in Rolling Stone's \"bands to watch out for\" in 1997, cub is the epitome of the DIY-Vancouver factor: three young women hook up through the UBC student radio station, CiTR and start a band with little or no previous musical experience. Now the flagship act for Mint Records, the Vancouver-born indie label, cub tour across North America. Their latest release, Box of Hair, is a regular on college and independent rock radio charts. MOLLIES REVENGE: Led by the mohawked Yvette, and featuring the talents of seasoned local players, Mollies Revenge play music that fuses raunch, roll and sweet The two-year old band signed a multi-record, international deal with L.A.-based 143 Records, headed by David Foster, sister Jaymes (vice-president, and Brian Avnet (president) Their debut, Every Dirty Word, hits retail next week .\n\nPURE: Having experienced a major-label nightmare once already, power. poppers Pure were reluctant to get back on the big band wagon after signing an ill-fated six-figure deal with Reprise Records. They licked their wounds with the outstanding Extrapurestrial EP and once more attracted big attention. Pure are signed to Mammoth Records in the U.S. and are currently working on a new record to be released through Universal .\n\nows 1.04..-..:-,,..,'-\"..,!:!-4'.;.,:.,.......:.,. ,..,..1:: ,:10:141.:,, Is\" s' tliii.i::::--iiiot:::'I'\":\":-::.;:.- NOT ANOTHER SEATTLE Nor, for that matter, will Vancouver ever be Seattle. Though we are undoubtedly of the Pacific Northwest and share a regional sensibility to our dosest, major urban neighbor to the south, there is no one sound that typifies the cresting wave of talent. Grunge unified Seattle's independent scene. It became a recognizable genre and labels started signing Nirvana soundalike bands to cash in on the buzz .\n\nLabels like Sub-Pop and Records evolved into quasi-talent brokers who issued stamps of approval. And, sooner than later, the city was mined of anything worthwhile, the indies were co-opted by the industry and the movement had nowhere else to go. \"Vancouver has so many different kinds of music that it's impossible to pick out one defining feature,\" says Jordan. You can find almost any kind of music on Vancouver's stages, with a dizzying array of labels to apply to the bands' styles: classic punk outfits, hard-edge post-punkers hairy rockers, bobby soxers, grrrl rioters, techno-poppers, hip-hoppers, mop-toppers, reeferheads, Celtic crossovers, world beatniks, blues bakers, big banders, acid jazzers, cocktail crooners, country swingers and folk-bent hippies. \"I think 20 years after the first DIY revolution, the second generation realizes they can do anything,\" says Ellie O'Day, representative of the Pacific Music Industry Association (PMIA a local industry support and lobby group) .\n\n\"The diversity keeps it healthy, but at the same time, with so many bands in town there's going to be a squeeze in terms of who can make a career out of it. If you have 500 artists trying to make a living in the city, it's clear a lot of them will have to readjust their expectations. There's not enough room,\" says O'Day, a broadcaster, writer and longtime fan of live music who recently spent a weekend at Heritage Minister Sheila Copps' roundtable on culture. O'Day has watched Vancouver evolve musically over the last two decades and says we've hit critical mass. Not only are there great bands, there's also a whole infrastructure to offer financial support, professional advice IIENENEEIlrun 1 and feedback .\n\nIN YOUR EYE: Here's Mudgirt D.I.Y. RENAISSANCE Twenty years later, however, the punk, D.I.Y. (do-it-yourself) ideals have resurfaced, stronger than ever, in a myriad of forms from the in-your-face geniality of a band like Mollies Revenge, to the hyper-pop sensibilities of Pluto and Bloody Chicletts to the hippie-chick 'hunk-hop\" of Kinnie Starr. I \"Political accountability was the only theme that emerged at the beginning Nifith the punk movement and seems to have continued through the years. But tile music is incredibly varied,\" says Porteous .\n\n\"On one side, you've got the whole Sarah McLachlan thing going on on the other, you have the second generation punk scene. It's all over the map,\" says Porteous who mentions immigration, multi-culturalism and the natural tendency to look south as factors contributing to our uniqueness. Dave Chesney, a former Sony Music representative who's in the midst of forming his own, Vancouver-based independent label says the music is only part of the picture. \"What's happening in Vancouver now goes much deeper than just music,\" he says. \"I think we're in the midst of a cultural and Vancouver ahead of the hype as it's had a chance to evolve in relative isolation .\n\n\"Vancouver isn't coming up with the same regurgitated sounds it's different because of where we are and where this community has come from.\" Chesney, Porteous and Steve Jordan, an MER representative for Warner Muic Canada, say Vancouver is unique for over the country, but Vancouver is blessed by being far from Toronto. \"The problem comes in what happens to a band after it forms. If you're in a band in Toronto, within the second week of you playing in town, chances are that some A8cIt guy is going to see you. In Vancouver, it might be two years before someone sees you and those two years allow a band to experiment without worrying about what some label exec thinks,\" says Porteous. \"Acts that have made a dent in the music industry aren't the ones that sound like everyone else they're the ones that do their own thing and do it with passion .\n\nNo one in Canada wanted to sign k.d. lang she was way too weird at the time. But now, she's an international star because she's unique LOOKING OUTWARD But for all the inward mingling, every band that lives west of the Rockies knows the future lies outside the province and probably outside Canada. It was west-coasters like Adams' manager Bruce Allen, agency king Sam Feldman and Nettwerk Records' co-founder Terry McBride who first proved the viability of West Coast acts around the world. \"I don't even spend a lot of time in Vancouver anymore because most of my business is outside,\" McBride says .\n\n\"I spend two weeks of every month in New York because that's where I have to be now,\" says McBride, who also functions as manager to Sarah McLachlan, Moist and Barenaked Ladies. \"Vancouver is a beautiful place to live, but there's only one direct flight to New York a day. It's not exactly convenient.\" McBride says Nettwerk still signs local talent, but it can't focus on B.C. or Canada if it's going to be successful. Hence Nettwerks' London and New York offices, the latter of which has locked up the multi-media! enhanced CD market in the U.S .\n\nwith B.C.-born programmers. \"We've grown, but we still can't compete with the big boys as far as being a label is concerned,\" says McBride. \"So we've had to focus our energies on a limited number of projects and taking them as far as we can.\" That's the essence of the frontier mentality, says Chesney. And it's precisely that mixture of internal confidence and external ambition that will maintain Vancouver's position as a music destination Well into the millennium. \"We know what we can do and we've proven that we can do it around the world .\n\n\"I think Vancouver has always been close to a grassroots way of thinking all we have to do now is roll up our sleeves and keep going.\" I I I ct alg Keffifitm 'AV: AiW1U5 Ka.gfitM AV THE FIGURES According to a 1996 Price-Waterhouse-PMIA study, there were close to 1,200 music and sound related businesses in B.C., worth about $340 million to the local economy and accounting for more than 7,300 BOMB W33 MA1THEW GOOD BAND: One of the Lower Mainland's radio heroes, Good climbed rock radio charts with his single, Alabama Motel Room, while he was still unsigned. He attracted much interest from U.S. majors after being picked as the Canadian act to watch by Billboard Magazine's Larry LeBlanc. Good opted for a U.S. deal with Private Music, a mid-size label that went under this year before Good's new album had a chance to fly .\n\nGood is expected to sign a new deal some time this year.
