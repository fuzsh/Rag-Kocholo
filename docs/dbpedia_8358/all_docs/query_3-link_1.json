He was given his first guitar at age 9, wrote his first song at 13, and began performing at 14. After many years perfecting his songwriting and guitar playing technique he relocated to Toronto, Ontario. He released his self-titled debut on his own Soffwin label in 1982. Zacharin has released another five solo albums since this. 2007’s ‘Waiting on Your Love’ featured the best of Toronto’s pop and jazz players, as well as long-time Tom Waits alumnus Ralph Carney. Since release it has received national airplay on the CBC and its French partner Radio-Canada. Much sought after as a guitarist, he has recorded and performed with some of Canada’s finest writers, including Penny Lang, Bruce Murdoch (with whom he has also co-written), Lucien Francoeur, Rick Fielding, Danny Marks, etc. As a soloist he has opened shows for the likes of Odetta, David Lindley, Dave Van Ronk, Jesse Winchester, Alex de Grassi, and Fairport Convention. He has twice been runner-up in the OCFF ‘Songs From the Heart Contest’, and has consistently short-listed in the competition. Zacharin has published hundreds of poems, translations, and reviews in periodicals and anthologies worldwide, and is currently at work on two volumes of poetry and several children’s books.\n\nSingles\n\n2023 Red Red Bird (Soffwin)\n\nAlbums\n\n1982 Noah Zacharin (Soffwin) SW-33-101\n\n1997 Silence Spoken Here (Soffwin)\n\n2000 aLIVE!

Zahalan was a Miss Canada finalist in 1976 before embarking on a career as an entertainer. She was a performing arts teacher at Oakville’s Sheridan College. She released two independent singles on various labels in 1981 and 1982 before signing with the Avalon label. Her debut album, ‘Think of Me’, was released in 1982 on the Avalon label which spawned two charting singles – “If I Had One Wish” and “Breaking Away”. She received a JUNO Award nomination in 1983 as ‘Most Promising Female Vocalist’. She formed her own label, Mazu, in 1985 and released the single “Call Me”. She wouldn’t release another full-length album until signing with Jeff Burns’ Justin Entertainment in 1990. Her ‘Zahalan’ album was released that year and featured the single “I Can’t Forget About You”. In January 2011, Zahalan graduated from Liverpool Hope University in England with a Masters Degree in a program that studied The Beatles called ‘The Beatles, Popular Music and Society’. She was the first graduate of the program. Her dissertation paper has since been turned into a book entitled ‘Cultural Capital: The Beatles In Canada’; Mary-Lu Zahalan died of lung cancer on May 27, 2023.\n\nSingles\n\n1981 Try a Little Love Sometime/Take Me Through The Twilight (Heart) HRT-8110\n\n1982 Turn of the Wheel/Think of Me (Sefel/Almada) 45-015\n\n1983 If I Had One Wish/Caught In This Love (Avalon) AVN-104\n\n1983 Breaking Away/Would You Believe Me (Avalon) AVN-108\n\n1985 Call Me/[same] (Mazu) MAZ-02\n\n1990 I Can’t Forget About You (Justin Entertainment)\n\nAlbums\n\n1982 Think of Me (Avalon) AVE-1010\n\n1990 Zahalan (Justin Entertainment) JED-004\n\nZALARMES, Les\n\nAn 8-piece all female Québec vocal group featuring singers between the ages of 15 and 2.

With proper guitar lessons by age 12, Zappacosta’s guitar teacher began arranging weekend gigs for him at Italian weddings. As work progressed, Zappacosta found himself playing with a plethora of musicians on stage including accordion players and flamenco guitarists. Weary of the wedding circuit, he decided he would rather get into contemporary music which led to a series of Top-40 bands during the late ’70’s disco era. His first professional, unionized, card-carrying gig was with Robert E. Lee followed by the disco/R & B Janette Brant Lee which featured three female vocalists, a horn section and sequined three-piece jumpsuits. Zappacosta soon grew tired of this three ring circus and decided to form an original rock and roll act in 1979 by utilizing Paul Delaney (drums) and Steve Jensen (guitar) from the disco act and called it Surrender. They recorded their self-titled debut in 1979 for Capitol Records which just barely cracked the RPM Top 100. After touring and several member changes, Surrender returned to their original three member line-up. In September 1981 they released the EP ‘No Surrender’ which failed to chart despite the release of two singles. The trio trudged on despite resistance from Capitol who reluctantly agreed to another album but shipped the band off to LA to work with Ed Thacker. The resulting album was considered an unmitigated disaster, was shelved, and Surrender disbanded. In 1983 Zappacosta began selling himself as a solo act and just as he was about to sign a management deal with American agents Leber-Krebs, he received a call from manager Lou Blair (Loverboy) who enticed Zappacosta back into the Canadian talent pool. With a fresh vision the new team decided to revive the finished Surrender album but it needed an overhaul. With Dee Long and John Jones’ new ESP Studios (which was home to many other Capitol recording acts) the record was reworked and remixed by Dee Long (Klaatu) in three weeks. The 1984 result was named ‘Zappacosta’ and featured several members of Surrender (Steve Jensen, Mitch Starkman, Paul Delaney and Gerald O’Brien) and guest appearances by Jeff Jones (Red Rider) on bass and Gerry Mosby (The Hunt, Rhinegold) on background vocals. The album spawned several hit singles including the Bob Ezrin co-write “Passion” and landed Zappacosta a Juno Award for ‘Most Promising Male Vocalist of the Year’. As 1985 marched on Zappacosta’s next album was in the proverbial can, and once again Capitol dragged their heels. In the interim he performed in the musical stage production of ‘Evita’ as Che Guevara and was one of many Canadian superstars to lend his voice to the “Tears Are Not Enough” Ethiopia relief record ‘We Are the World’. With the ‘Evita’ production on a roll in Halifax, Zappacosta received word that his album would be picked up by Capitol Records after all. ‘A-Z’ was released in 1986 and resulted in another fistful of hits. During the time of uncertainty with Capitol Records Zappacosta had been courted by Millenium Records president Jimmy Ienner but Zappacosta refused his advances. However, in 1988 Ienner approached him again about adding a song to an upcoming movie he was producing called ‘Dirty Dancing’. Zappacosta co-wrote a tune called “Overload” with Marco Luchiani which the producers loved and the song was featured in the movie soundtrack which became not only a hit movie, but one of the biggest selling movie soundtracks up until that time. That same year Lou Blair’s business partner Bruce Allen founded Penta Records and signed Zappacosta. However, Penta Records would soon become unmanageable as a five-headed business proposition and the label lost its distribution deal with Elektra on the eve of release of Zappacosta’s next album. Bruce Allen cut his ties with Zappacosta and Lou Blair helped clear up the contractual mess and Zappacosta was left with a finished master tape and no distributor. Using money from his ‘Dirty Dancing’ soundtrack profits, he was able to convince Capitol to take a chance on him one more time and they released his A-Zee Records album ‘Quick!…Don’t Ask Any Questions’ two years after it was recorded. A heavy tour schedule followed with his new band featuring Steve Jensen (guitar, vox), Corrine Plomish (vocals, keyboards), Marco Luciani, Darren Bowler (bass), and Tony Azzopardi (drums). Zappacosta even brought in long time road crew Bob Shindle (audio) and Brad Campaigne (lighting, tour manager). Following the wrap up of the tour he decided to take a much needed break to do some soul searching and finally focus on his abilities as both a singer, by taking vocal lessons, and a guitarist (by taking up classical guitar). In 1993 Zappacosta fronted a trio who played the club circuit with his flair for adult contemporary charm and new classical stylings. By late 1995 he had recorded his next effort, ‘Innocence Ballet’, for fre/EMI and did a Canadian promotion tour with few actual gigs. By early 1996, Syndrome Records had released the disc in the US and Zappacosta found himself touring on some very successful and well received dates stateside. In July 1996 after the particularly grueling tour schedule, the singer/songwriter was admitted to an Edmonton hospital with severe pneumonia that made it necessary to perform a tracheotomy (rather than damage the singer’s vocal chords with a standard breathing tube). But the pneumonia was only part of a larger complication as doctors discovered 2 large pancreatic tumors. These were removed successfully. During Zappacosta’s recovery, he took time to reflect on his career and choices he had made. He had made it clear in many interviews that it had never been his intention to be a front man. Writing songs and playing guitar had always been his passion. But somewhere along the way, he realized that he really did want to sing. If that decision was going to ring true, he wanted to be the best he could be. In 1998, he began work with renowned vocal couch David Dunbar. The result was an incredible growth that inspired Alfie to record once again. In 1999, with a new label, White Feather Records, and lifelong friend/producer Gerry Mosby, Zappacosta headed to Wellesley Sound Studios to record his 7th CD “Dark Sided Jewel”. While this recording has certainly received the critical acclaim it deserved, it never did garner airplay. The music industry was just not ready for a new Zappacosta. In 2001, Zappacosta returned to Neptune Theatre in Halifax, Nova Scotia to resurrect his role as Christ. Teamed with Heather Rankin (The Rankins), ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’ was a smashing success and put Zappacosta back on the radar. On a return visit to Halifax in 2001, Alfie met Anne Oakley, a promoter/publicist from Halifax. They began to work together and six months later, she became his manager. In 2002, Alfie returned to Edmonton to once again portray Che in ‘Evita’ and began to tour Canada to introduce his new music. During a DVD filming in Toronto, Zappacosta signed to LiveTourArtists and Alfie began to find a home in theatres and soft seater venues. Zappacosta was finally home, singing in venues with an audience who wanted to hear the music and buy the CD’s. In 2003, he signed to Marquis Records/EMI. Teamed with producer Glenn Morley (Gino Vannelli) Zappacosta recorded ‘Start Again’.

At the age of thirteen, she began playing with other young musicians to find her musical direction. Although Classical music was always part of her passion, the teenager also loved Janis Joplin and often imitated her. A few years later, she founded the hard rock band Silver & Lace. She was also the band’s manager and booked their shows in bars and clubs around Québec. The band would eventually split up in 1997. In December 1999, she joined the cast of ‘Notre-Dame de Paris’ playing the character Esmeralda as part of a tour of France before returning to Québec, where she alternated performances with France D’Amour until August 2001. While juggling multiple projects she recorded her first album, ‘Café Noir’ which was released in the spring of 2002. Zarzour co-wrote most of the tunes along with Charles Lanteigne. Following the release of the album Zarzour played Lady Capulet in a Québec performance of ‘Romeo and Juliet’ for most of 2002. She then joined Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas for two years beginning in the fall of 2003 as part of the troupe Zumanity.\n\nSingles\n\n2001 Café Noir (A & R) AR2-4505\n\n2002 Stratosphere (Gestion Lez Arts) GLACD-01021DJ\n\nAlbums\n\n2002 Café Noir (Gestion Lez Arts) GLAC-D0102\n\nZAZA, Paul\n\nBorn: Paul James Zaza\n\nToronto, Ontario’s Paul Zaza is a classically trained pianist who completed a degree at the Toronto Conservatory of Music.

They released two albums for Epic (distributed by CBS) and gained a foothold in the Canadian prog rock sweepstakes next to the likes of Saga, Klaatu, FM and Rhinegold. The Don V. Lorusso produced ‘Astral Projector’, released on blue vinyl, became an FM radio staple in the late ’70’s. The album garnered the band a ‘Best New Group’ Juno nomination. The band would find itself opening up gigs for the likes of The Tubes at Toronto’s Maple Leaf Gardens, and Styx at CNE Stadium getting opening slot encores on both occasions! 1979’s ‘Back Down To Earth’ was produced by Don V. Lorusso and the late Vancouver keyboard whiz Dale Jacobs. The band played Toronto as headliners where a hometown crowd swelled to 17,800 people. A reporter for the Globe & Mail, who had only stayed to see the opening act, wrote a scathing review thinking he had seen Zon. The negative review was the headline of the entertainment page, nationally in Canada. CBS demanded compensation for the impact on Zon’s popularity but neither the band, nor the label, ever recovered. Zon was dropped from CBS after a thorough corporate housecleaning of the A & R Department despite Zon already having their contract picked up for a third album. The ensuing legal battle took much of the heart out of the band, but they did manage one more album for Falcon Records called ‘I’m Worried About The Boys’ produced by then former CBS A & R man Bob Gallo. The record featured a cover version of the Velvet Underground’s “Sweet Jane”. As part of the 1980 tour to support the album, Zon did an ill-fated opening slot for Alice Cooper at Toronto’s CNE Stadium. When Cooper failed to appear minutes before showtime due to an apparent throat infection, Denton Young was given the onerous task of telling the audience. A riot ensued and police had to be called out. Audience members threw chairs and garbage onstage and Zon barely got away unharmed. The band broke-up shortly after despite the 1981 single “For You” reaching #2 on CKOC in Hamilton (higher than any of the previous singles on CBS Records). Singer Denton Young most recently popped up on Rik Emmett’s solo work; Kim Hunt would go on to join Hanover, Urgent, and Moxy along with Jim Samson; Roddi Chappell is in long running AOR band Lightspeed who released two CDs on Pacemaker in the ’90s; Brian Miller works at Toronto’s famed 12th Fret guitar store; Howard Helm joined Michael Fury which mutated into Refugee. In 1988 Helm was offered a job as touring keyboardist for Mick Ronson and Ian Hunter. He took the job and spent 4 years on the road touring the world. That band released one live CD for the BBC on Windsong Records; Helm eventually settled in Tampa, Florida (whilst touring with Hunter/Ronson) and has a music production company where he writes music for film, commercials and television. He is currently writing for TBS television in Atlanta and Universal Studios in Orlando. He continues to play keyboards in-studio for the likes of bands like Seven Mary Three on their ‘Orange Ave.’ CD among others; Zon’s first two albums were released as a double CD in Europe in 2003; Brian Miller passed away from cancer in the fall of 2015. With notes from Denton Young, Howard Helm, Rick Wharton, Rod Chappell, Jack Palmerston, and Jef Leeson.\n\nSingles\n\n1978 Melody/On the Road (Epic/CBS) E4-4177\n\n1978 Talkin’ About [Stereo]/ Talkin’ About [Mono] (Epic/CBS) DJE4-4189\n\n1979 Back Down To Earth/When He’s Old (Epic/CBS) E4-4217\n\n1979 Gods and Kings/Take It From Me (Epic/CBS) E4-4226\n\n1980 Sweet Jane/Takin’ The Easy Way Out (Falcon/A & M) FAS-1005\n\n1980 For You/Just The Other Side (Falcon/A & M) FAS-1006\n\n1981 Better Get Up/Want My Baby (Falcon/A & M) FAS-1007\n\nAlbums\n\n1978 Astral Projector (Epic/CBS) PEC-90442\n\n1979 Back Down To Earth (Epic/CBS) PEC-80026\n\n1979 Back Down To Earth/Special Edited Mix (Circus/Take It From Me/Lifeline/Gods and Kings / Please Stay/Cheater) [12″] (Epic/CBS) 12E4X-4217\n\n1980 I’m Worried About The Boys (Falcon/A & M) FAL-80003\n\n2003 Astral Projector/Back Down To Earth [2CD] (Escape) ESMO-91\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1979 “Circus” on ‘Chocolate Hits From Nestle Quik’ (CBS Special Products) CSPS-1513\n\n1979 “Cheater,” “Back Down to Earth,” and “Gods and Kings” on ‘Northern Stars’ [2LP] (CBS) 2-CDN-12\n\n1984 “Circus” on ‘Striktly for Konnoisseurs’ (Music for Nations) MFN-32\n\nZONE\n\nJean Robitaille (vocals)\n\nMontréal, Québec studio act.\n\nSingles\n\n1984 Space Love/Space Love (Instrumental) (TGO) TGS-1012\n\n1984 Space Love/Space Love (Instrumental) [12”] (TGO) TGS-112\n\nZOO, The\n\nBryan Duffy (vocals, guitars) / Phil Houston (bass) / Brent Gagnon (drums)\n\nFollowing his departure from See Spot Run, Bryan Duffy formed short-lived trio The Zoo who released on album on Bullseye Records before Duffy relocated to Los Angeles.\n\nAlbums\n\n2005 The Zoo (Bullseye) BLR-CD-4112\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n2006 “Original” on ‘Unsigned, Sealed & Delivered: A New Breed V2.0 (Frontline/Bullseye) FL-804009\n\nZOOM\n\nChris Haight [aka Chris Paputts] (guitar) / Johnny [aka John Hamilton] (drums; switched to bass) / Bent Rasmussen (drums)\n\nZoom was formed in the Fall of 1976 and debuted at Toronto Queen Street bar The Beverly Tavern on New Year’s Eve of that year. It was there that the band would meet up with future scene makers Steve Leckie (The Viletones) and Lucasta (The B-Girls). In January 1977 the band revived the Colonial Underground and began playing there regularly while booking other bands like The Diodes, The Viletones, The Cads, The Battered Wives and Teenage Head. Jimmy The Worm (Chris Haight’s brother) was club manager. The band hastily released a single in the Spring of 1977 but it wasn’t long before they played their last gig on Toronto Island — kicking out their original bassist for dressing badly (Hamilton switched from drums to bass), and recruiting Diodes drummer Bent Rasmussen. With most of the punk acts in disarray at the same time, Hamilton wound up in The Diodes as their drummer; Haight changed his name to Hate and joined the Viletones as bassist; Rasmussen ended up in Johnny & The G-Rays. Between work with their respective full-time bands Hamilton and Haight re-issued the Zoom single with a picture sleeve with plans to release a Zoom album on the side. Though the album was recorded and produced by BB Gabor and Bob Segarini, it was never released. The recording features additional musical input from BB Gabor, Bent Rasmussen, Lucasta and Zenia (B-Girls), Screamin’ Sam Sinatra (The Ugly), and Dr. Bourque (The Curse) among others. Later Hamilton and Haight would reconvene in the early 1980’s as musical frustration led the two musicians to quit The Diodes and The Viletones respectively. With Haight’s departure from The Viletones, that band essentially folded and members Motor X (drums) and Freddy Pompeii (guitar) joined Hamilton and Haight first for a Zoom review-styled production, then as backing musicians for several Toronto singers and finally as The Secrets. with notes from John Hamilton.

Their original line-up shifted with the exit of bassist Ted Koti over personality conflicts. It wasn’t long before they brought in Brian Doss on bass and renamed themselves Zuckerbaby – taken from the 1985 German art film by Percy Adlon. The group garnered plenty of attention across the country opening for larger touring acts, eventually landing a recording contract with Mercury Records in 1996. The self-titled debut record was recorded at Sundae Sound Studios in Calgary, Alberta during January/Febuary1997 and was released in May of that year. The album was produced by Krisjan Leslie and Reed Shimozawa with six songs mixed by Jack Joseph Puig (Black Crowes, Tonic, Jellyfish). The album produced three singles and accompanying videos: “Andromeda”, “Heavy” and “Shampoo”. The “Andromeda” video reached No.13 on the Much Music Video Countdown. Both “Andromeda” and “Heavy” received heavy rotation on Canadian rock radio, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto. Among the band’s accomplishments was performing at Edgefest dates in Barrie and Ottawa, Ontario as well as opening for the Cardigans and Savage Garden as well as playing with INXS at Vancouver’s Coliseum, a month before Michael Hutchence’s death. The band went through some personality conflicts with bassist Brian Doss and Ted Koti returned to the line-up. Zuckerbaby’s sophomore effort, ‘Platinum Again’, for Mercury Records was recorded between October 1999 and January 2000 at the Factory Studios (formerly Little Mountain Sound) in Vancouver, British Columbia. The album was produced by John MacLean and Zuckerbaby and featured new bassist Ed Tiegs. Guest artists were ex-Age Of Electric’s Todd Kerns & Ryan Dahle keyboardist Dave Genn (Matthew Good Band). The first single/video from the CD was “Overexposure.” Eichhorn would go on to a solo career; Tiegs would go on to join Thousandsticks; Shimozawa would became a session player and producer;\n\nSingles\n\n1997 Andromeda/Grease Flowers [FlexiDisc 7″] (Eva-Tone Sheets – US)\n\n1997 Andromeda (Mercury/Polygram) PCD-498\n\n1997 Heavy (Mercury/Polygram)\n\n1998 Shampoo (Mercury/Polygram) PCD-529\n\n2000 Overexposure (Mercury/Universal) UMCR-4144-2\n\n2000 Holiday (Mercury/Universal)\n\nAlbums\n\n1997 Zuckerbaby (Mercury/Polygram) 453457\n\n2000 Platinum Again (Mercury/Universal) 542763\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1996 “Jealousy” and “Andromeda” on ‘Oooh, I’m So Pretty’ (Gone Tomorrow) 6-23667-20020-2\n\n1997 “Heavy” on ‘Hott Rocks No. 21’ (Multi Music Services) HR-21\n\n1998 “Heavy” on ‘Smash’ (Polymedia Marketing Projects) 555-895-2\n\n1998 “Shampoo” on ‘Hott Rocks No. 25’ (Multi Music Services) HR-25\n\n1998 “Jealousy” on ‘Big Wheelz 98’ [2CD] (Chart Magazine) [no cat.#]\n\n1998 “Heavy” on ‘Barq’s B3 10 Tounes Extremes Pour L’Ete’ (Polygram Special Projects) PSP-9811C\n\n1999 “Andromeda” on ‘Molson Canadian Rocks Edge Fest ’99 CD Sampler Disc no. 5 (Universal Music Special Projects) MC99#5\n\n2000 “Heavy” on ‘Rave™ Sound Bites’ (Universal Music Special Projects) USP-20002\n\n2013 “Heavy” on ‘Canada 24: Rock Your Cottage Weekend’ (Universal) 5344050\n\nZUMPANO\n\nA.C.

His songwriting skills and determination landed him a deal with Ready Records. He released his debut EP, ‘Five Seven, Maybe Five Eight’, in 1984 under the name Michael Zee. The record spawned two singles but gained almost no attention at radio. Undaunted, Zweig would eventually form his own band called The Knockouts with Victor D’Arsie, Anton Evans and Terry Martell. After being signed to Justin Entertainment in the late 1980s they changed their name to Seventh Son and had a modicum of success with their self-titled debut. Zweig opened his own production studio called Candyland in the early 1990s and released another solo album in 1995 with that title. As the decade wore on he joined Classic Rock act The Carpet Frogs playing hundreds of shows on their own and as backing band for Burton Cummings and occasionally Randy Bachman including their appearance at Live 8 in Toronto. He produced, co-wrote and performed on The Carpet Frogs second studio album, ‘Pretending to Fly’, in 2006. In recent years he decided to forego touring to be with his family in Toronto and focus on his production work. He is also a coach for the ‘Legion of Rock’ team-building company; The Knockouts reunited under their original name and have been performing around Southern Ontario in recent years. He is also in cover band Kings of the Midway featuring The Carpet Frogs Jeff Jones. Zweig writes music for TV and radio advertising including jingles for the Home Hardware chain. He also co-wrote “The Place’ll Be Rocking ‘Cause It’s Saturday Night” for CBC’s ‘Hockey Night In Canada’.
