Page Publications, later known as Page Music from 1996 onward, was an independent record label run by Steven Page's father Victor Page. It is mainly remembered for releasing Barenaked Ladies' 5-song self-titled cassette EP known as The Yellow Tape. After the runaway success of the tape, Page Publications became a full-time job for Victor, and they later released or distributed records by several other Canadian artists.
