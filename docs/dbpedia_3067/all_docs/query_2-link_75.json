        "text": "DECEMBER 2023\n\nMy show Something Wild and Unruly went better than I could have dreamed! I am so proud of myself and grateful for all the love and support from friends, family, colleagues, and the spectacular audience. What an extraordinary way to end a beautiful year!\n\nPhotos: Marcus Maddox\n\nNOVEMBER 2023\n\nI spent an exhilarating week with Little Lord at the Mercury Store, building a new show about fears and humiliation (among other things 😳). I love these nutballs and I'm proud to count myself among them.\n\nOCTOBER 2023\n\nIt’s official! My one woman show Something Wild and Unruly is on December 19th at 7pm at Pangea in the East Village. I LOVE this image that Taylor McGee designed! \"Join Meg at the worst moment of her life: the night her teenage daughter doesn’t come home. As she figures out the Where, she also figures out the Why. After all, she comes from a long line of women who knew when it was time to flee… and did. In Something Wild and Unruly, Meg's hilarious and poignant family stories and fears about raising a daughter in New York City are interspersed with songs about rebellion, motherhood, and love.”\n\nTIX AND INFO HERE\n\nSEPTEMBER 2023\n\nMatt Gasda's newest play One Winged Dove is “tightly scripted, cleverly structured… all executed with a steady, purposeful hand.”\n\nWe're up and running all through September and October at Brooklyn Center For Theatre Research and beyond!\n\nAUGUST 2023\n\nAfter a summer filled with theater, I escaped to the woods to compete in Outlast, a 4 day Survivor game. Episodes will be on YouTube soon, so no spoilers.😉\n\nJULY 2023\n\nI had the honor of playing Mrs. Pat in Galatea 2.0, written by Sophie Dushko, directed by C.C. Kellogg, and starring Isabel Mar, Violet Savage, and Vince Santvoord at Brooklyn Art Haus. This play is extraordinary. This team is pitch perfect in every way. And this is just the beginning!\n\nJUNE 2023\n\nSophie Dushko and I did a reading of Through the Cracks by Karen Cecilia, directed by C.C. Kellogg for Adult Film.\n\nThen we all headed to Bath, Maine to rehearse Galatea 2.0, directed by C.C. and written by Sophie, with Isabel Mar and Violet Savage and Vince Santvoord (not pictured). I love this play so very much. I feel like the luckiest girl in the world to be working on this text with these people.\n\nMAY 2023\n\nMatt Gasda is writing up a storm and I've been in two readings of his new work this month: Salt and One Winged Dove. Both readings were at his space Brooklyn Center for Theater Research, which is becoming a lovely clubhouse for theater folk in Greenpoint.\n\nSharone Halevy, Kate Mulley, and I escaped to Pennsylvania to work on my one woman show. Goal: Rehearsal Script✅ Stay tuned!\n\nAPRIL 2023\n\nI played in a one day Survivor game hosted by Competitive Events and and… drum roll… I WON! Crazy times. I’m still processing it all. I’m so grateful to have met and played with this group of strategic and social powerhouses. I believed deep down that I could do it, but now I know:)\n\nMichael Levinton and the marvelous group at Little Lord invited me to The Mercury Store to help build their next show. We spent a week exploring Tupperware, transparencies, Supermarket Sweep, and humiliation.🤡\n\nMARCH 2023\n\nJessica and I did our first LIVE RECORDING of our podcast Desperately Seeking the '80s at Malt and Mold’s beer garden at 21st Street and 2nd Avenue. We had a blast and all our BFFs did too! To the first of many:)\n\nOur run of Dover by Matthew Gasda starring me, Izabel Mar, and George Olesky is going strong. The show is evolving beautifully. AND Dimes Square and Other Plays by Matthew Gasda is available on Amazon and includes Minotaur, which we premiered last summer. I love working with these people.\n\nFEBURARY 2023\n\nJessica and I celebrated the ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY of our podcast Desperately Seeking the '80s with all our BFFs! We are very proud of our 50+ episodes about crime and culture in NYC in the '80s, and we’re just getting started...\n\nImprobable Stage is developing a new piece about gathering. I loved meeting and playing with a whole new group of performers during their weekend workshop.\n\nJANUARY 2023\n\nHitting the ground running in 2023! George Olesky, Izabel Mar, and I are doing an extended run of Dover by Mathew Gasda. We’ve performed in loft spaces across the city to sold-out houses. The show keeps building and growing. I’m very proud of the work we’re doing.\n\nDECEMBER 2022\n\nMatthew Gasda asked me and Izzy Mar and George Olesky to perform his play Dover… in 10 days. And we freakin’ did it. It was wonderful - don’t be fooled by the photo - and we’re doing it again in January!\n\nI played a tiny role in Mary Neely’s new film Or Something. Everyone on set was lovely. They look exhausted here, but that’s because they were working so hard. Can’t wait to see it!\n\nNOVEMBER 2022\n\nI did something very scary. I invited my most trusted colleagues to the workshop of my one woman show: Something Wild and Unruly. I’m so grateful for their super valuable feedback and the guidance of Sharone Halevy (Director), Michael Hicks (Musical Director), and Kate Mulley (Dramaturg). Watch this space.\n\nI played a deeply narcissistic, manipulative, and volatile mother in Max Cohen’s short film \"My Mother Is\".\n\nOCTOBER 2022\n\nI spent a blissful week upstate making whacky theater at Little Lord’s retreat. Michael Levinton has some fantastic ideas cooking! This is a self portrait of what the pandemic did to me.🤪\n\nSEPTEMBER 2022\n\nCheck out the amazing RED TRIBE of Survivor Brooklyn South All Stars!! These games are so challenging and incredibly rewarding.♥️\n\nDesperately Seeking the 80’s hit 5000 downloads!!

It was a beautiful and empowering evening… and my 15 year old son was in the audience🥹\n\nThe amazing Bethany James had another reading for her FANTASTIC pilot and this time I Zoomed from my bathtub because of Wifi issues… I’m not sure if anyone could tell😂\n\nJULY 2022\n\nI spent a blissful week working on one of the best scripts I’ve read in years. Galatea 2.0 by Sophie Dushko is like Pygmalion in The Matrix and features love dolls and incel culture and Dolly Parton. The incredible C.C. Kellogg of Invulnerable Nothings directed the workshop at the Mercury Store in Gowanus. Vincent Santvoord, Alida Rose Delaney, Lauren Guglielmello, and I went deep on this extraordinary piece.\n\nI went straight from the Galatea 2.0 workshop to a 4-day Survivor LRG in upstate New York. No spoilers… but it was EPIC. Survivor New York Season 5 will be on YouTube in the next few months :)\n\nJUNE 2022\n\nOn the opening night of Minotaur, I thought to myself how lucky I am to be back on stage. I missed theater so much. This show introduced me to a new set of wonderfully talented people, reunited me with some old pals, and was incredibly creatively fulfilling. What a wonderful welcome back! Huge thanks to Matthew Gasda, Bob Laine, George Olesky, Katie Kane, Cassidy O’Grady, Eliza Vann, Mary Neely, Aubrey Mann, and Michael Segal💜\n\nMAY 2022\n\nDying to Survive, directed by Anna Sørrig, won the Grand Jury Prize at its first screening at Apple Box Short Film Festival!\n\nI had the absolute delight to perform in Peace and Love in Brooklyn, a new musical by Eamon O’Tuama at the incredibly cool Beckett’s Bar as part of Origin Theatre’s Mondays in May reading series. Pictured here with Maria Deasy, Annalisa Chamberlin, Ciaran Bowling, and Gary Troy.\n\nI had the pleasure of helping The New Wild develop Everybody is Gone, a piece of immersive journalism that illuminates for audiences some of the experiences that the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Western China face as a result of the Chinese government's systematic oppression.\n\nAPRIL 2022\n\nRehearsals for Minotaur, by Matthew Gasda, are going so well. I love this group of people. They make staging a psychosexual family drama fun😂\n\nDesperately Seeking The ‘80s, my podcast with my highschool bestie Jessica about NYC in the 80s hit 1500 downloads! We’re delighted and going strong.\n\nMARCH 2022\n\nOur podcast Desperately Seeking The ‘80s: NY Edition is live! Revisit the crime and culture of NYC in the ‘80s with BFF Gen-Xers Jessica and Meg.\n\nI was in a slew of readings this month: the new musical Peace and Love in Brooklyn by Eamon O’Tuama, directed by John Keating at the Irish American Writers and Artists, Inc.; the short play Roommates by B.J. Burton, directed by Alisa Matlovsky for The Women in the Arts and Media Coalition; and a new TV pilot, Roebling Project, by Bethany Lauren James and Hunter Gardner.\n\nThe public reading of Minotaur by Matthew Gasda went wonderfully, and we’re excited to get back into the rehearsal room, gearing up for a full staging in May.\n\nFEBRUARY 2022\n\nThe director, Anna Sørrig, and most of the crew of the short film \"Dying to Survive\" are Danish. There was a soothing babble of Danish underscoring the whole day of shooting. Very Hygge!\n\nFebruary was chock full of readings: I played a gay local politician from Minnesota in The Chaos Theory of Now by Jennifer Joy Pawlitschek, directed by Alisa Matlovsky for the League of Professional Theatre Women, and reprised Evelyn in the musical two-hander The God of In Between by Christopher Wall. Lots of creative energy in the air!\n\nJANUARY 2022\n\nJessica Jones and I started recording our podcast, Desperately Seeking the ‘80s: NY Edition. Revisit the crime and culture of NYC in the ‘80s with BFF Gen-Xers Jessica and Meg. We’ve banked five episodes and are scheduled for a February release!\n\nReunited with Bob Laine from the old NADA days (pictured here in 2019 recording the radio play of American Revolution by Kirk Wood Bromley.) We’re playing a dysfunctional couple in Minotaur by Matthew Gasda, when we’re not reminiscing about hanging out on Ludlow in the ‘90s.\n\nDECEMBER 2021\n\nCarl Belfatti and I worked so beautifully together on \"Care and Feeding,\" our mini-musical that helped raise $30,000 for the Actors’ Fund earlier this year, that we’ve started to write a full length musical😊 More soon!\n\nNOVEMBER 2021\n\nI performed a reading of my one woman show (which is still untitled) for four very supportive and wise colleagues.

What with Deborah and Gina Manfredi at DDO Artists Agency, I now have a bonafide TEAM of reps😊\n\nI voiced all the adult roles in a reading of wonderful Laura Winters' new musical: The Last Age of Moonsteeds. Think Stand By Me, except it’s about a group of girls in the 90’s. And it’s funny as hell.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2021\n\nThis month I competed in Survivor Brooklyn South, hosted by the amazing George Nicolaidis and a crew of astoundingly beautiful Survivor super fans. A teeny tiny part of me didn’t believe I could do it—and that part of me died a gruesome death. It was amazing! I made alliances and strategized and won TWO individual immunity idols and found an idol and played it on my closest remaining ally and made it to FINAL FOUR and George gave me the torch (!!!!) AND I won Fan Favorite! BEST DAY EVER\n\nI sang \"Around The World\" from Grey Gardens at The Players this month. I just love the story of Little Edie. While preparing the song for the evening celebrating the return of Broadway, I came to deeply respect her vulnerability and gumption—qualities that are often underappreciated in women. Michael Hicks accompanied me and was outstanding, as well as a lovely dinner date.\n\nAUGUST 2021\n\nStephani has road rage! And she was a ton of fun to play. Watch her 6-minute episode of The Drive-Thru Therapist.\n\nI’m THRILLED to announce that I'm being represented by DDO Artists Agency in their On-Camera Division. Gina and Michaela are wonderful to work with. Having a strong team is the best feeling!\n\nMy mother had a milestone birthday this month and I formed The Family Band with my uncle Randy and cousins Will, Trish, and Wilson, to sing \"If You Knew My Story\" from the musical Bright Star. It’s a song about a woman who has lived an incredible life and is ready to talk about it, so it seemed particularly fitting for my mother:) Watch our performance.\n\nTogether Apart raised over $40,000 for The Actors Fund! \"Care and Feeding\", the mini-musical I wrote with Carl Belfatti, was a joy to work on. I am so grateful to Carl, Ann Harada, Mia Ellis, Kitty Balay, and the incomparable Vivienne Benesch for making the experience and the piece more than I dreamed it could be.

He is performing the Samuel Beckett tribute in The Actor's Nightmare by Christopher Durang, LIVE on Zoom. I had so much fun directing these amazing kids.

They created theater magic in tiny Zoom squares and I’m just bursting with pride!\n\nAPRIL 2021\n\nHere’s a screenshot from \"Care and Feeding\", which I wrote for Together Apart, a collection of new short musicals written, composed, directed by, and featuring Brown University alumni.

Here are some of the inspiration materials Michael has us reading:\n\nMAY 2017\n\nWorked with the best crew ever on All That Glitters, a short whacky film that takes place the day after the election. Here are some stills. Can't wait to see the finished product!\n\nAPRIL 2017\n\nI reunited with the writer/director of Matriarch, Jaydn Gosselin, to film its prequel: Reach. Dark content. Lovely team.\n\nAnd more Little Lord workshopping…\n\nAnd Five on a Match retreated to upstate NY to work on Seen/By Everyone: the San Francisco version!\n\nMARCH 2017\n\nI performed with Little Lord as part of the ComPassion Plays (Purim 2017) at DCTV. I think the picture speaks for itself.\n\nIn anticipation of THE SALON meeting this month, I've been writing short scenes in hour spurts. Not sure what or if they add up to anything, but enjoying the exercise!\n\nFEBRUARY 2017\n\nThe Five on a Match crew has started working on a rewrite of Seen/By Everyone in anticipation for a run at Theatre of Yugen in San Francisco in the Fall of 2018! We are starting from scratch in many ways, but staying true to the heart of the play: mourning and moving on in the digital age.\n\nHere we are visiting the Ali Forney Center to deliver the $5000 we raised for LGBTQ youth last month at #11/9; or EVERYTHING is TERRIBLE so we put on a SHOW*\n\nThe creative geniuses of Little Lord have invited me to romp with them as they build a new show. Do you recognize the inspiration for their next piece?\n\nJANUARY 2017\n\nThings have been quite rough since the election in November. Five on a Match (the theater collective with which I work) found ourselves itching to respond to the political shift. So this month at Theaterlab we produced:\n\n#11/9; or EVERYTHING is TERRIBLE so we put on a SHOW*\n\n(A night of plays & performance grappling with the reality of T***P)\n\n*it might be shout-y but you know it's true\n\nAnd… we oversold the house! People were standing against the walls, sitting on the floor, and in the aisle. The plays and performances were funny, heartfelt, and ultimately uplifting. MOST IMPORTANTLY, we raised $5000 for the Ali Forney Center for homeless LGBTQ youth!\n\nThe I, Witness episode I shot in July just aired. I have a small role in this fraught docudrama. It's a rough story, well presented.\n\nDECEMBER 2016\n\nWorked with a wonderful producing team shooting Matriarch, a short film about grief, by Jaydn Gosselin.\n\nAmir Darvish, Matthew Cohn, Nana Mensah, Pranav Phull, and I had a private reading of Disgraced by Ayad Akhtar. Fascinating play and spirited discussion… more soon…\n\nNOVEMBER 2016\n\nWhile working on Seen/By Everyone, a creative seed in me was sown. I'd never even considered writing a play… until now! And I am meeting periodically with a few fellow actor/writers to experiment and share our writing projects. THE SALON: Polly Lee, Adam Patterson, Matthew Cohn, Rachel Claire, and me!\n\nThis Fall I directed 8th graders from Allen-Stevenson and Nightingale in The Tempest. My daughter, Alice, played Miranda!

(We should be so lucky:)\n\nJULY 2016\n\nHad the time of my life working with the visionaries at Little Lord on their new show Now Is the Time. Now Is the Best Time. Now Is the Best Time of Your Life at Abrons Art Center.\n\nLay in a coffin for a couple hours today filming the first episode of I, Witness, due to air in January.

Charles Socarides on this, along with David Kersey and Melissa Constantinides.\n\nAPRIL 2015\n\nAmir Darvish, Jen Taher, Matt Cohn, Enormvs Muñoz and I spent a weekend upstate in this beautiful barn working on a devised piece: stay tuned!\n\nMARCH 2015\n\nRehearsing with fantastic ladies on Abigail Gampel's new script Through the Window.\n\nMet and worked with a wonderful group assembled by Andy Bragen to read Bright Lines by Lee Vance at the Lark.\n\nFEBRUARY 2015\n\nHad so much fun filming this House of Cards parody, House of Pancakes! Excuse the potty mouth :-)\n\nHouse of Pancakes (YouTube)\n\nJANUARY 2015\n\nI joined in Target Margin's Gertrude Stein Festival by reading If I Told Him: A Completed Portrait of Picasso at The Bushwick Starr. Wonderful, whiskey filled evening of words, words, words.\n\nAhh January, the Month of the Class. I am taking 2 fantastic classes, one with Candice Alustiza from Meredith Tucker Casting and one with Ted Sluberski, an on-screen acting coach. I feel thoroughly primed for 2015!\n\nDECEMBER 2014\n\nI spent the days before Christmas filming in Rome, NY with Kobi Libbi on his newest project. He is developing a style of performance that results in remarkably honest, vulnerable, and complex work. Here is a shot of Ben Mehl filming in an old steel mill.\n\n\"Do you want the moon? I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.\"\n\nFor four magical nights I played Mary in a staged radio play of my absolute favorite movie It's a Wonderful Life. Also brushed up my Glee Club chops caroling in four part harmony before the show. I wish we could do it year round! Thank you Cake Productions for a beautiful ride.\n\nNOVEMBER 2014\n\nSince October I've been directing a remarkable group of 8th graders in A Midsummer Night's Dream. The name of the game is \"patience.\" Just when I've given a direction too many times and in too many ways and resigned myself to lowered expectations, those crazy kids blow me away. They listen, absorb, process, and, when it counts the most, hit it out of the park. So proud!\n\nOCTOBER 2014\n\n\"Miyagawa's play is clever, stylish, and often funny.\" —The New Yorker\n\n\"The fascinating Meg MacCary... is indeed a compelling narrator.\" —nytheaternow\n\n\"...if you trust the talented cast... you will be in for a great night at the theatre.\" —The Huffington Post\n\n\"MacCary's comic timing is spot on, and she does a fine job of bringing the audience into the scattered world she inhabits.\" —Front Row Center\n\nSEPTEMBER 2014\n\nI'm excited to open This Lingering Life by the incomparable Chiori Miyagawa next week!\n\nGet Tix Here\n\nThis is my costume as Woman With Tragic Hair:\n\nAUGUST 2014\n\nJust went out to Governor's Island to film a scene for Trade Practices, HERE's new interactive theater piece inspired by the financial industry.\n\nIt's just gorgeous out there and the show is going to be fantastic! It opens August 31st.\n\nTrade Practices Info\n\nJULY 2014\n\nThe best way to start off the summer is playing with David Herskovits and the Target Margin folk at The Bushwick Starr. We spent five days experimenting with Eugene O'Neill, Shakespeare, and the extraordinary poem \"Dining Out With Doug and Frank (for Frank Polach)\" by James Schuyler. I've included a link here, in case you have time to read it. Published in 1980, it loves New York, warts and all. Poem + Bushwick Starr's gorgeous view of the city + Target Margin = Bliss.\n\n\"Dining Out With Doug and Frank (for Frank Polach)\"\n\nJUNE 2014\n\nIn September I will be playing The Woman with Tragic Hair in Chiori Miyagawa's This Lingering Life at HERE, directed by Cat Miller and produced by Cake Productions.\n\nIcing on the cake... the handsome and remarkably talented Amir Darvish is in it as well. This will be our third show together in two years! Here's a picture of us at the HERE benefit.\n\nMAY 2014\n\nI just did a reading of the fascinating play Cogito by Huzir Sulaiman as part of the PEN World Voices Festival of International Literature at the Martin E. Segal Center. A man downloads his wife in an attempt to keep her alive forever. After his death, the multiple versions of her meet...\n\nJenny Seastone Stern, Birgit Huppuch, and I played different incarnations of Katherine Lee. Charles Socarides played our capable young lawyer. The impossibly smart and delightful Mike Donahue directed.\n\nFor the third year in a row, I'm honored to read and evaluate plays for the Princess Grace Award in Playwriting.\n\nAPRIL 2014\n\nI was delighted to go on 7 times in Dinner With Friends. In one crazy stretch, I went on 6 times in 5 days as both Karen and Beth!\n\nI'll miss these lovely ladies.\n\nMARCH 2014\n\nFEBRUARY 2014\n\nJANUARY 2014\n\nDECEMBER 2013\n\nI'll be understudying both Karen and Beth in Dinner with Friends at the Roundabout this Winter and Spring. I went to the first read-through and was delighted to see so many old friends: Chuck Turner, Marin Hinkle, Jeremy Shamos, and Pam MacKinnon. Looking forward to becoming a memorizing fiend!\n\nNOVEMBER 2013\n\nI spent a day in New Jersey shooting an episode of Frenemies for Discovery ID. My son gets murdered by his best friend. I'm distraught. Airs in February!\n\nJust discovered the Actor's Green Room. It's a wonderful, relaxed place to learn and meet people. Took a great class with Clint Alexander, Angela Bowers, Brette Goldstein, and David Vaccari.\n\nOCTOBER 2013\n\n\"Creative, engaging, and quite brave.\" —Huffington Post\n\n\"Crafted in true collaborative spirit.\" —Show Business\n\n\"Surprising…poignant and humorous…authentic in experience.\" —Broadway World\n\n\"The piece is wonderfully tidy.\" —Time Out\n\n\"Emotionally honest…it will leave you thinking about it long after the cast members have taken their well-deserved bows.\" —Off Broadway\n\nI'll miss you, I Came To Look For You On Tuesday.

I play a 6 year old girl, a teenager with wanderlust, the mom of a grown daughter, a betrayed farmer, and more. Pictured above are me and Alexis Camins during our last run in the rehearsal space.\n\nGet Tix\n\nHad a blast playing a talk show host for a video cameo in Trade Practices, opening in October.\n\nAUGUST 2013\n\nRehearsals for Chiori Miyagawa's new play I Came to Look for You on Tuesday start next week! I can't wait to get back in the room with Susan and Amir and Jens and Alice and the whole gang.\n\nThe show doesn't open until September, but Chiori and others have planted artistic seeds about the city and the web, all inspired by the idea of reunion.\n\nTo tide you over until the show opens, visit the HowlRound blog on the creation of the piece (I'm interviewed in one article):\n\nInterview\n\nAnd The Tuesday Project website, which features street art by James Bayard and reunion stories (one of which I wrote):\n\nStory\n\nJULY 2013\n\nI joined the artistic team of Trade Practices at Mass MoCA, a center for contemporary art in North Adams, Massachusetts, for an artist retreat to help work on the show. It was mind blowing to explore the remarkable exhibitions at the museum after hours. But that was just a bonus. The real joy was singing and playing with this incredibly talented group of people.\n\nJUNE 2013\n\nChiori Miyagawa, author of I Came To Look For You on Tuesday and This Lingering Life, graduated from New Dramatists this month and asked me and Joe, along with 7 other couples, to renew our vows as part of her glorious, art-affirming graduation ceremony. These people shared their words of commitment to each other and to their chosen life in the arts and, as with most New Dramatist events, I felt so lucky and blessed to be part of this artistic community.\n\nMAY 2013\n\nTwo years ago I worked on Chiori Miyagawa's remarkable play I Came To Look For You on Tuesday at New Dramatists. It has haunted me ever since. I could not be happier to return to 44th Street this May and continue the adventure with the awesome Alice Reagan at the helm.\n\nI am helping to direct a group of seventh graders in Animal Farm this month. It's bringing back lovely memories of playing Clover with Synapse Theater. Who knew that 13 year olds would be so eager to snort and grunt and flap their wings? Animalism!\n\nAPRIL 2013\n\nI'm back in the rehearsal room with the audacious Little Lord, helping to develop their new piece inspired by \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\", \"Rip van Winkle\", and other works by Washington Irving.\n\nFor the second year, I'm honored to read and evaluate plays for the Princess Grace Award in Playwriting.\n\nMARCH 2013\n\nTickets are on sale for The (*) Inn!\n\nFreaky black hens, whips, and, yes, a haunted Inn. David Herskovits has flipped this Yiddish play on its head and spun it around a little. Come on down to the Lower East Side (it's in a beautiful, old proscenium theater) and hear me say \"Oy Vey\"!\n\n*empty, vacant, abandoned; usually translated as \"Haunted\".\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nFEBRUARY 2013\n\nStarting rehearsals for The (*) Inn! The play is wild. The cast is fantastic. David Herskovits is the master. I'm in heaven.

This year, we're doing Much Ado About Nothing, and I must give a shout out to this remarkable group. Their insight and instincts inspire me. These kids can drive me crazy, but watching them learn how to tell a story is easily the most satisfying experience around.\n\nOCTOBER 2012\n\nWe are deep into rehearsals for Barking Girl by the fantastic Susan Bernfield. Pirronne Yousefzadeh, my new favorite person, directs. I play Becca, the gay, expecting sister of the very conflicted Rae. We open November 8th at The 4th Street Theatre.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2012\n\nI am reprising my role as Woman with Tragic Hair in a reading of Chiori Miyagawa's striking play This Lingering Life.

The Pocahontas! workshop re-lit my inner museum-fiend fire. Our time at The Bushwick Starr featured bonnets, copious brainstorming, and gorgeous sunsets. Check out the blog of the workshop here: http://littlelordnyc.tumblr.com/\n\nThe wonderfully talented actress Clare Barron is also a delicate and insightful playwright. She is a member of the Youngblood collective at EST. I played a mom in a disfunctional Midwestern family trying to muddle through a natural disaster in the EST reading of her fantastic new play Baby Screams Miracle.\n\nJUNE 2012\n\nOn Monday I attended the screening of The Giraffe That Knew Too Much, the live action short I did earlier this year. The lovely Katie Baldwin was there to hold my hand. I survived watching myself! And, truth be told, it turned out beautifully. I'll try to post it here when I get a copy.\n\nNext week I'm off to the Bushwick Starr for 3 weeks to play with Little Lord. They are workshopping their new show Pocahontas! and have invited some people to help with the development. I'm such an admirer of these guys. Their work is wacky and fun and as smart as it gets. A perfect way to kick off the summer!\n\nMAY 2012\n\nI'm spending next week workshopping a new play by the beautiful Chiori Miyagawa at New Dramatists, with David Herskovits directing. I'm playing \"Woman with Tragic Hair.\" Fitting.\n\nI've been reading and evaluating plays for the Princess Grace Award in Playwrighting. I haven't read a stack of plays in a while. I've really loved it.\n\nAPRIL 2012\n\nIf you're in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, come see me in Mr. and Mrs. Fitch. I play \"Mrs.\", the snarky but adoring wife of a has-been gossip columnist.

I'm so eager to see the stills and footage. The production design is gorgeous.\n\nI got a chance to reprise \"The Master\" song from The Tempest at Target Margin's benefit with only two hours' sleep after shooting all weekend. I was too loopy to even be nervous! It was a lovely evening and I can't wait to see Uncle Vanya in May.\n\nThe 15 year old boy I coached for the English Speaking Union's Shakespeare competition made it to the New York finals! I'm very proud. He did an awesome job.\n\nFEBRUARY 2012\n\nI was just cast in the short film The Giraffe That Knew Too Much. I'm playing the mother of a five year old boy — not much of a stretch! The film takes place in a dystopian future, where an oppressive government has banned my son's favorite book. I will have to take it away from him or get in a LOT of trouble. Rehearsals start next week; I'll post on the progress!\n\nJANUARY 2012\n\nThis month is officially The Month of the Class. I'm treating myself to the tough love of Paul Davis, David Cady, and James Callari. A hefty dose of constructive criticism to start the year off!\n\nI'm also coaching a great kid to compete in the English Speaking Union's Shakespeare Competition. He is 15 and performing Angelo's slimy speech to Isabella. He has such an inspiring work ethic and is finding wonderful layers to explore. I'll post updates as the competition approaches.\n\nDECEMBER 2011\n\nJust spent 2 glorious weeks at New Dramatists for their PlayTime developmental lab. I was working on a new play by Chiori Miyagawa inspired by the tsunami in Japan, Tom Waits, and \"Bobby Jean.\" It is an astounding work. I am so grateful to Alice Reagan, who directed, and the wonderful actors and New Dramatists folk for the experience.\n\nNOVEMBER 2011\n\nI am directing an awesome group of 8th graders in As You Like It. Every time I work on this play I discover something new. Orlando and Adam's love kills me.\n\nI'm taking an onscreen class with James Calleri. Oh, I am learning so, so much. I can't wait to put it into practice.\n\nOCTOBER 2011\n\nTickets are on sale for Prison Light! Think the movie Brazil meets The Office. I play Pembroke, the boss from Hell. The awesome Alice Reagan directs.\n\nTickets and info\n\nI've also been workshopping Uncle Vanya with Target Margin. David Herskovits and his gang are feeling out a whole slew of translations.

I was mugged over and over again until 4:00am. I got a few bumps and bruises and only three hours of sleep, but had a great time with a very worthy project.\n\nFEBRUARY 2011\n\nIt's official!\n\nI am playing Stephano, the drunken butler, in Target Margin's production of The Tempest this May.\n\nWe are going to workshop it for 2 weeks this month at the Chocolate Factory.\n\nAlso, Judy Bowman's on-camera class has been a revelation. I'm learning fresh approaches and thinking in a new way about performance. I feel recharged!\n\nJANUARY 2011\n\nThe new year is already busy and fruitful!\n\nDuring this brief hiatus from The Tempest, I'm taking an on-camera class with the fantastic Judy Bowman.\n\nI've also been called in and called back for a number of commercials lately, so I'm eager to pursue those opportunities more aggressively in 2011.\n\nIt was so lovely to eat pizza, drink fresh sparkling water, and read aloud Sheri Graubert's new comedy about small town environmental politics. I can't wait to see the next draft!\n\nNOVEMBER 2010\n\nIn preparation for a Spring production of The Tempest, Target Margin has gathered 6 actors to work on various scenes. This month, I'm playing the Boatswain, Iris, and Trinculo — a more varied group would not be possible! As part of the workshop, we spent a morning at the Metropolitan Museum finding inspiration in classical sculpture and romantic paintings. The show is going to be remarkable.\n\nMy November is sponsored by Shakespeare; I'm also co-directing a production of Romeo and Juliet with 13-year olds. The kids are smart and understand the text very well. Their challenge is to express it emotionally and physically. I rush from rehearsing The Tempest to a room full of 30 kids, who are so new to the rhythms and picture of a play that no entrance or gesture is taken for granted. I'm trying to approach my own performance work with such freshness and daring.\n\nOCTOBER 2010\n\nI'm spending an incredible and inspiring week doing table work on The Tempest. Around the table: Kristin Linklater, Michael Kahn, David Herskovits, Michael Sexton, and scholars Ruth Carpenter and Rich McCoy. The week culminates in a panel discussion sponsored by The Shakespeare Society at 7:00 on Monday, October 25th at The Mint Theater. I'll be reading Antonio!\n\nSUMMER 2010\n\nI'm strapping on a corset for the first time in years to play Lady Fidget in a New York production of The Country Wife by William Wycherly, directed by Bradford Cover. Come by The Chernuchin Theater on W. 54th this July!\n\nPress Release\n\nReview in Backstage\n\nMAY 2010\n\nI'm having a marvelous time tinkering on The Tempest with David Herskovitz in a two week workshop at the BRIC.\n\nAPRIL 2010\n\nIt's been so lovely to work with old friends on an all-girl choral piece of \"Visions of the Blessed Bruder Klaus\" by Sibyl Kempson, directed by Ken Rus Schmoll. The performance is on Sunday, April 25th at Glasslands. It benefits Andrew Dinwiddie's show Get Mad at Sin! Come by if you can!\n\nI'm playing a mad scientist in a two week workshop of Do Clones Dream of Identical Sheep? by Jon Kern, directed by Heidi Handelsman, sponsored by New Georges. The reading is April 12th at The Room at 7:30.\n\nMARCH 2010\n\nI'm commuting to Brooklyn to play an explosively angry church lady in Thank You, Kind Spirit, directed by Alisa Matlovsky in Target Margin's The Unknown Williams lab series. We open March 18th at The Bushwick Star.\n\nJANUARY 2010\n\nI am stranded on an ice floe on a work-in-progress showing of Staying Afloat by Lenora Champagne at Dixon Place. There are two showings: January 22nd and 23rd. It would be lovely to see you there!"
