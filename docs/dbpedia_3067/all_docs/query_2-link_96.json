        "text": "What's in a name? About £10m, it would seem. This morning we learned that the Cottesloe will eventually be renamed the Dorfman. The reason is that Lloyd Dorfman, founder and chairman of Travelex and a member of the National Theatre board, is to provide a large donation towards the National's £70m future development programme. It's an extremely generous gesture and one that fully deserves recognition. I just wonder whether re-christening an established theatre is a good idea and whether it may not set a dubious precedent.\n\nThe naming of the National's three auditoriums was always a controversial business. Some of us felt it odd that only one of the three houses, the Olivier, nominally honoured an artist. The Lyttelton was so called in honour of Oliver Lyttelton, Lord Chandos, a lifelong champion of the National and a former chairman of the board. But, in terms of envisioning what a national theatre could be, he was not to be compared with a playwright and theatrical visionary like Harley Granville-Barker. As for the Cottesloe, that was named after a former chairman of the Arts Council and the NT board. I'm sure he was an honourable man. But, again, one felt a theatre devoted to radical experiment might have been more romantically christened. The fact is, however, the name has stuck. So is it sensible to change it?\n\nMy real concern, however, is with the symbolism of the gesture. The Tories are anxious to shift the balance of arts funding from the public to the private sector. And, if philanthropy becomes a criterion for the renaming of theatres, we may be going down a very rocky path. If someone caps Lloyd Dorfman's gift of £10m with £20m or £30m, does that mean the NT may re-brand the Olivier or the Lyttelton?\n\nMy own instinct is that philanthropy should be an altruistic gesture that neither asks, nor even expects, anything tangible in return. I also feel that theatres should ideally honour artists rather than enlightened entrepreneurs. I rejoice in the fact that, in the West End, the Globe has become the Gielgud, the Strand has been re-christened the Novello and the Albery is re-titled the Noel Coward.\n\nMaybe the National, which Private Eye used to mischievously suggest should be called Peter Hall, should consider whether it might be more fitting to celebrate a playwright, director or actor when it comes to re-branding its auditorium. I mean no discourtesy to Lloyd Dorfman. But how does the Cottesloe family feel about the loss of its foothold in posterity? And wouldn't the Bennett, Stoppard or Frayn be an equally good title for a theatre?"
