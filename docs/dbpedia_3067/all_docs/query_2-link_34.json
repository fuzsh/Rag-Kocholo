The Rev. Dr. Charles J. Ping, a Presbyterian minister and president emeritus of the university, is to perform the ceremony.\n\nMiss Dorfman, 52, who will keep her name, is the director of the university's School of Theater and a professor of theater. She graduated from the University of Iowa and received a master's degree in theater arts from Columbia University.\n\nShe is a daughter of Barbara Riley Kurtz of Patagonia, Ariz., and the late William Dorfman, and the stepdaughter of Dr. Stanley M. Kurtz of Fort Worth.\n\nMr. Gaddis, 56, is the Robert A. Lovett Professor of Military and Naval History at Yale University and the founder of the Contemporary History Institute at Ohio, where he is a professor emeritus. His most recent book is ''We Now Know: Rethinking Cold War History,'' (Oxford University Press, 1997). His first book, ''The United States and the Origins of the Cold War, 1941-47,'' (Columbia University Press, 1972), won the Bancroft Prize, which honors notable books on American history."
