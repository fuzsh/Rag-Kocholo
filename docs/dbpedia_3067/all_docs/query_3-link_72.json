        "text": "The Great Gildersleeve - 498 Episodes\n\nFORMAT: DVD / CD\n\nThe Great Gildersleeve is a radio situation comedy broadcast from August 31, 1941, to March 21, 1957.[2] Initially written by Leonard Lewis Levinson,[3] it was one of broadcast history's earliest spin-off programs. The series was built around the character Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve, a regular element of the radio situation comedy Fibber McGee and Molly. The character was introduced in the October 3, 1939 episode (number 216) of that series. Peary played a similarly named character, Dr. Gildersleeve on earlier episodes. The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest popularity in the 1940s. Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spin-off and later in four feature films released at the height of the show's popularity.\n\nIn Fibber McGee and Molly, Peary's Gildersleeve had been a pompous windbag and nemesis of Fibber McGee. \"You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!\" became a Gildersleeve catchphrase. The character went by several aliases on Fibber McGee and Molly; his middle name was revealed to be \"Philharmonic\" in \"Gildersleeve's Diary\" episode on October 22, 1940.\n\n\"Gildy\" grew so popular that Kraft Foods—promoting its Parkay margarine—sponsored a new series featuring Peary's somewhat mellowed and always befuddled Gildersleeve as the head of his own family.
