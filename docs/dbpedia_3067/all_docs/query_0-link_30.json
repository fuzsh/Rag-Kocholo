        "text": "David Steinberg’s life has straddled comedy’s old and new schools. He was friends with Groucho Marx and palled around with the L.A.-based Hillcrest Country Club gang, including members such as Jack Benny and George Burns. As he chronicles in his new memoir, Inside Comedy, Lenny Bruce was the first stand-up comedian he ever saw, and he grew up to direct Larry David in episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nAs a stand-up and on television appearances, the former rabbinical student, now 78, belonged to a generation that pushed stand-up away from mother-in-law and airline-food jokes to something more confessional and confrontational. At Chicago’s legendary Second City, Steinberg’s signature routine was an improvised sermon (“God, whom I’m sure you’ll remember from last week’s sermon…”).\n\nOne of those sermons, about Jonah and the whale, was deemed not ready for prime time by CBS censors when Steinberg performed it on the controversial variety series The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. That episode, though taped, never aired, and the sermon was instrumental in the series ultimately being canceled in 1969.\n\nInside Comedy traces Steinberg’s more-than-half-century career while offering insights gleaned from his talk show on Showtime, also titled Inside Comedy, on which he interviewed such icons, torchbearers, and modern masters as Mel Brooks, Billy Crystal, Tina Fey, Gilbert Gottfried, Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele, Robert Klein, Richard Lewis, Don Rickles, and Jonathan Winters.\n\n“I had so many memories over the past 50 years and I wanted to share them,” he told Vanity Fair in an email exchange about the impetus for his book. “I’ve been working on this for a while. I’m so happy it’s finally done.”\n\nThis interview was edited for length and clarity.\n\nVanity Fair: You write that radio was your comedy gateway. Who were your favorite radio comedians?\n\nDavid Steinberg: We didn’t have a television then. I lived at the movie theater, often skipping school. But radio was the best of everything. You could paint pictures in your head and let your imagination fly. It was so exciting. My favorites were The Great Gildersleeve, The Jack Benny Show, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy and My Friend Irma. I couldn’t get over them.\n\nYou were a rabbinical student when comedy found you. Was there any “Jazz Singer” drama from your parents?\n\nLuckily, I was the baby in the family, not really on their radar. They had already raised three children that were grown (I was a surprise when my mom was 40). They were just relieved that I was going away and doing something that I loved. My dad had a great sense of humor. When I left Winnipeg at 16 to go to Chicago on a scholarship, he said, “I kiss the train that takes you away.”\n\nThis is an assumption on my part, but when did you realize that the majority of the people who made you laugh were Jewish, and how did that impact you?\n\nWhen I was a kid, I looked around and they were all Jews. In the ’50s, I can’t think of that many comedians who were not Jewish. They were the jazz musicians of comedy for me. They were the outsiders.\n\nWas Lenny Bruce the comedian whom you most related to because he spoke in the language and to the concerns of your generation, much like George Carlin would do in the ’70s? Was he influential in what you chose to talk about onstage?\n\nLenny Bruce was the first comedian I ever saw. He was a huge influence. He was compelling. He told stories he cared about and never pandered to an audience. He taught me that you could talk about real life, controversial thoughts. I was irreverent because he led the way. It got me in some good trouble over time, like going after Richard Nixon.\n\nYou appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson 140 times. I’m a sucker for Tonight Show debut stories. What do you remember most about your first appearance?\n\nI was bumped from the show at the last minute three times. The third time my agent Irvin Arthur was irate. “They can’t do this to you! That’s it! We are out of here!” As we were putting on our coats and leaving, Tony Bennett started singing “I Left My Heart in San Francisco.” Irvin turned to me and said, “Wait a minute, we can’t leave. I love this song.” When I finally got on a month later and sat down with Johnny, my life changed. Johnny and I instantly connected. I had a career the next day. I hosted the show when I was 26. I was on the show every few months for over 30 years. Looking back, being on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson was my career.\n\nAre you a good audience for comedy? Can you be in the moment when watching a comedian or sitcom, or do you focus on the craft?\n\nI’m a fan of comedy like everyone else. When I’m in the audience, I can enjoy what I’m hearing, but I am acutely aware of how and why it’s working. So I guess I’m doing both.\n\nToday viral tweets or YouTube videos can get an aspiring comedian a Netflix special. Do you think something is lost when comedians don’t go through the meticulous process of honing their material night after night in front of a comedy club audience; having a place to fail?\n\nWhen Richard Pryor, George Carlin, and I were doing stand-up, the only goal was to get a good solid hour and to be onstage as much as possible. You have to fail often onstage to get a good act. The audience will let you know what works and what to leave out. If you can’t take failure, don’t be a comedian.\n\nPlease fill in the blanks: A rabbinical student sees the world’s ills and thinks…\n\nI’m going to make some money with this.\n\n…A comedian sees the world’s ills and thinks…\n\nI’m going to make more money with this.\n\nOne thing that is so valuable about your book is that it may introduce a new generation to some essential comedians whose names have fallen into obscurity. How important do you think it is for today’s comedians to be cognizant of the history of comedy?\n\nIt was everything to me and all of my peers. When we were starting out, we wanted to know everything about everyone who came before us. We were students of comedy; different forms, approaches to getting laughs and styles. We had respect for those who came before. If you want to be good at something, you study everything about it.\n\nYou and the best of your generation pushed stand-up as an art form. But is there also something to be learned from the journeyman comics from the Catskills/Vegas/nightclub eras?\n\nYou can’t slough off the comics from the Catskills. They were some of the funniest who ever lived. Mel Brooks, Shecky Greene, Buddy Hackett, Mal Z. Lawrence, and many, many more. These comedians honed their craft with some of the toughest audiences.\n\nAn observation about the book: You may be the first person to suggest that Milton Berle’s legendary appendage, a comedy cliché, is overrated.\n\nMy best friend Ziggy Steinberg (no relation) and I were working on The David Steinberg Show (1976) in Toronto. Milton was a guest star. We brought a script to his hotel room. He answered the door with a “Do Not Disturb” sign on the “legendary schlong.” All I can say is it didn’t measure up. Perfect Milton Berle bad joke.\n\nWhat is the most disturbing trend you see in comedy? (I’m anticipating you might say “cancel culture.” If so, do you believe there are topics that should be off limits)?\n\nOn principle there should be no topic at all that is off limits for comedians. That is what guided me in my career. I went against Nixon and was followed by the FBI. I did controversial sermons that contributed to the cancellation of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. There are always repercussions. But comedy needs freedom to explore. It seems even more complicated today with cell phones and social media.\n\nThe inevitable question: What do you hope readers get from this book?\n\nLaughs, and insight into what goes into making people laugh.\n\nAll products featured on Vanity Fair are independently selected by our editors.
