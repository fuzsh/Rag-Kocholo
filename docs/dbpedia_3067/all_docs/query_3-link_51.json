Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve was a pompous, larger-than-life windbag, who originated as one of Fibber McGee's (comically) quarrelsome neighbors. When Throckmorton got his own series on NBC, it found him moving to the town of Summerfield, where he began to oversee his deceased brother-in-law's estate and care for his orphaned niece and nephew. That made Gildersleeve one of the first single-parent characters to headline a prime-time program on U.S. television. This box set contains four episodes of the series: PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH, where Gildersleeve teaches his nephew about the ins and outs of dating; GILDY GOES DIVING, where Gildersleeve makes a foolish bid for publicity via a dangerous deep-water dive; GILDY STEWS ABOUT A COOK, where Gildersleeve will do anything to get rid of his housekeeper, even if it means marrying her; and ONE TOO MANY SECRETARIES, where pandemonium erupts when Gildersleeve's girlfriend replaces his secretary.\n\nView full details"
