        "text": "The Great Gildersleeve is a radio situation comedy broadcast from August 31, 1941, to March 21, 1957. Initially written by Leonard Lewis Levinson, it was one of broadcast history's earliest spin-off programs. The series was built around the character Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve, a regular element of the radio situation comedy Fibber McGee and Molly. The character was introduced in the October 3, 1939 episode (number 216) of that series. The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest popularity in the 1940s. Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spinoff and later in four feature films released at the height of the show's popularity.\n\nIn Fibber McGee and Molly, Peary's Gildersleeve had been a pompous windbag and nemesis of Fibber McGee. \"You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!\" became a Gildersleeve catchphrase. The character went by several aliases on Fibber McGee and Molly; his middle name was revealed to be \"Philharmonic\" in \"Gildersleeve's Diary\" episode on October 22, 1940.\n\n\"Gildy\" grew so popular that Kraft Foods--promoting its Parkay margarine--sponsored a new series featuring Peary's somewhat mellowed and always befuddled Gildersleeve as the head of his own family.\n\nAudition Show (7.8Mb)\n\nGildy Arrives at Summerfield (27.1Mb)\n\nThe Cake (27Mb)\n\nLeroy's Paper Route (6.8Mb)\n\nMarjorie's Girl Friend Visits (6.8Mb)\n\nHiccups (6.8Mb)\n\nInvestigate the City Jail (6.6Mb)\n\nPranks at School (10.2Mb)\n\nA Visit from Oliver (10.2Mb)\n\nBabysitting (10.2Mb)\n\nBirdie Quits (13.6Mb)\n\nServicemen for Thanksgiving (13.5Mb)\n\nLeroy Smokes a Cigar (10.2Mb)\n\nThe Canary Won't Sing (10.2Mb)\n\nCousin Octavia Visits (9.7Mb)\n\nSelling the Iron Deer (6.7Mb)\n\nChristmas Gift for Fibber McGee (17.1Mb)\n\nLeroy's New Dog (27.3Mb)\n\nGildy Goes on a Diet (25.5Mb)\n\nGildy Arrested as Car Thief (10.2Mb)\n\nA New Bed for Marjorie (10.2Mb)\n\nMatchmaker (27.7Mb)\n\nLeroy Runs Away (27.4Mb)\n\nAuto Mechanics (6.8Mb)\n\nSelling the Drugstore (6.8Mb)\n\nFortune Teller (6.8Mb)\n\nTen Best Dressed (6.8Mb)\n\nGildy's New Neighbors (6Mb)\n\nGildy Writes to Servicemen for Marjorie (6.8Mb)\n\nLeroy Sells Flower Seeds (10.2Mb)\n\nGildy's Goat Horace (10.2Mb)\n\nShip Christening (10.2Mb)\n\nMystery Voice (10.2Mb)\n\nCollege Chum Visits (10.2Mb)\n\nDinner for Judge Hooker (10.2Mb)\n\nThe Sneezes (10.2Mb)\n\nGildy Produces a Play (10.3Mb)\n\nFather's Day Chair (10.2Mb)\n\nGildy Is in Love with Amelia Hooker (10.2Mb)\n\nFishing Trip to Lake Hackmatack (10.2Mb)\n\nGolf Tournament (10.2Mb)\n\nPlanting a Tree (10.2Mb)\n\nFirst Cold Snap (10.2Mb)\n\nAppointed Water Commissioner (13.6Mb)\n\nGildy's First Day on the Job (10.2Mb)\n\nA Pal to Leroy (10.2Mb)\n\nQuiet Evening at Home (10.2Mb)\n\nCollege Chum's Son Visits (10.2Mb)\n\nThanksgiving Dinner (10.2Mb)\n\nAttend the Theatre -
