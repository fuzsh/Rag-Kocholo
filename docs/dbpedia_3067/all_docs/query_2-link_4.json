The film stars Ruth Warrick, Joan Carroll, and Walter Reed, and was released by RKO Radio Pictures (who also produced the film) on July 7, 1943.\n\nRadio child star Joan Mitchell appears on a popular crime series called \"Undercover Angel,\" but she's fed up with what she believes are the corny scripts, complaining that real children don't speak like that. She decides to \"research\" her role by investigating actual criminals. She's discovered snooping in their home by a trio of goofy, small time crooks, who, believing she's an orphan, take her in and agree to teach her some tricks of the trade. Meanwhile, her sudden disappearance has everyone naturally assuming she's been kidnapped, and things take a turn for the worse when she's recognized and snatched for realâ€”so her new guardians take it upon themselves to rescue her.\n\nRuth Warrick as Pat Mitchell\n\nJoan Carroll as Joan Mitchell/Small Change\n\nWalter Reed as Bill Morgan\n\nWally Brown as Sam Colfax\n\nTom Kennedy as Pinky\n\nJimmy Conlin as Jitters\n\nVince Barnett as Stogie\n\nPaul Guilfoyle as Joe 'Tinhorn' Foster\n\nGrant Withers as Detective Hogan\n\nEarl S.
