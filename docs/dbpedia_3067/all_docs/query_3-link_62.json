        "text": "Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve is as jolly as can be as he and the kids make some final preparations for Christmas. As Leroy and Gildy head out to get the tree, Birdie gives the baby a bath. A pleasant surprise awaits Gildersleeve at the tree sales lot. Though he only wants a small family gathering, He feels obligated to invite Judge Hooker.\n\nLater, he stops in at Floyd’s barber shop to talk about the baby, and her first Christmas. Though the plan was to just have a simple family party on Christmas Eve, Gildy feels guilty, and one by one, asks each of his friends over. Even Peavey gets invited to get away from his mother in law.\n\nBefore the guests all arrive, Gildy spends a few quality moments with the kids. He reads the poem, Twas the Night Before Christmas. Or at least a condensed version to fit the short radio slot. The gang all arrives, and sing a chorus of Deck the Halls.\n\nThe Judge wants to share a special word about his friend Bob Clark, the Christmas tree salesman, but Gildy somehow keeps putting him off. Bob hits it off well with the baby. In a candid moment, the listener learns the truth. Bob is the baby’s missing dad. Gildy is upset, but sings the baby a song. In an emotion filled moment, Gildy does the right thing, and reunites dad and baby."
