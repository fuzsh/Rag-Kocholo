        "text": "Roman Polanski (born August 18, 1933, Paris, France) is a French Polish director, scriptwriter, and actor who, through a variety of film genres, explored themes of isolation, desire, and absurdity.\n\n(Read Martin Scorsese’s Britannica essay on film preservation.)\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nShortly after the young Polanski’s family settled in Kraków, Poland, his parents were interned in a Nazi concentration camp, where his mother died. Polanski escaped internment and survived the war years by finding occasional refuge with Catholic families and often fending for himself. At age 14 he appeared on the stage, later acting in films directed by Andrzej Wajda, the leading figure in the Polish film revival of the 1950s. Polanski studied directing at the State School of Cinema in Łódź. By the time he graduated in 1959, he had already directed several award-winning short films. He made the French film Le Gros et le maigre (1961; The Fat and the Lean) and then returned to Poland to direct his first full-length feature, Nóż w wodzie (1962; Knife in the Water), a tense psychological study of sexual rivalry that brought him international fame.\n\nAfter he left Poland in 1962, Polanski made several major films in Great Britain and the United States. Repulsion (1965) traces the psychotic breakdown of a young woman whose fear and loathing of sex drive her to commit several murders. The dark comedies Cul-de-Sac (1966) and The Fearless Vampire Killers; or, Pardon Me but Your Teeth Are in My Neck (1967) followed. In 1968 Polanski directed his first American film, Rosemary’s Baby (1968), a thriller about a young New York City woman who unwittingly bears a child by the Devil. The film was a huge success and became a classic.\n\nThe following year, Polanski’s second wife, Hollywood actress Sharon Tate, who was pregnant at the time, was brutally murdered (along with four others) by followers of Charles Manson at the couple’s rented home in Los Angeles (see Tate murders). The violence of her death influenced his next film, Macbeth (1971), a gory yet artistically effective adaptation of the play by William Shakespeare. Chinatown (1974) reinvigorated the moribund film noir genre and is considered a classic of neo-noir. These films were notable for their careful buildup of mood and suspense, their subtle handling of human psychology, and their fascination with evil in its various forms.\n\nIn 1977 Polanski was arrested and eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawful intercourse with a 13-year-old. He subsequently jumped bail and fled to France, where he remained active in both the theatre and motion pictures. His subsequent films included Tess (1979), based on Thomas Hardy’s novel Tess of the d’Urbervilles; Frantic (1988), a suspense film; Bitter Moon (1992), an erotic comedy; and Death and the Maiden (1994), a psychological drama adapted from a play by the Chilean author Ariel Dorfman. In 1989 Polanski married the French actress Emmanuelle Seigner, who starred in his films Frantic (1988), Bitter Moon (1992), The Ninth Gate (1999), La Vénus à la fourrure (2013; Venus in Fur), and D’après une histoire vraie (2017; Based on a True Story).\n\nThe Pianist (2002), which tells the true story of Władysław Szpilman’s survival of the Nazi occupation of Poland during World War II, shared much in common with Polanski’s own childhood experience and earned the Palme d’Or at the Cannes international film festival and a best director Academy Award for Polanski. It was followed by Oliver Twist (2005), an adaptation of Charles Dickens’s classic novel, and The Ghost Writer (2010), a thriller involving a former politician and the author who is writing his memoir. For the latter movie Polanski won his third French César award for best director. He then directed Carnage (2011), a biting comedy in which two sets of parents tangle over approaches to child rearing; the film was based on Yasmina Reza’s play Le Dieu du carnage. In the drama J’accuse (2019; An Officer and a Spy), Polanski explored the real-life Dreyfus affair, which involved a Jewish army captain whose 1894 conviction for treason in France attracted controversy following allegations of anti-Semitism.\n\nFor more than 30 years U.S. authorities sought Polanski’s extradition on the 1977 rape charges, and in September 2009 he was arrested in Zürich, Switzerland. Polanski was later placed under house arrest as Swiss courts reviewed the extradition request. In July 2010, Swiss authorities rejected the request, and Polanski was subsequently freed from house arrest. These events are the focus of the documentary Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out (2012). The earlier Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired (2008), explores allegations of misconduct by the presiding judge in the original case.\n\nIn addition to his film work, Polanski directed and occasionally acted in theatrical productions. His autobiography, Roman, was published in 1984."
