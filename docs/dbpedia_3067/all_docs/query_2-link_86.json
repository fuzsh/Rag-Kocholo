        "text": "TOMMY Dorfman is famous for her role in the Netflix drama series 13 Reasons Why.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about the American actress and Hollywood starlet.\n\nWho is Tommy Dorfman?\n\nTommy Dorfman is an American actress, writer, photographer, and director.\n\nShe was born on May 13, 1992, in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nShe is the cousin of The Bachelorette star Andi Dorfman.\n\nIn 2015, she graduated with an acting degree from Fordham University.\n\nIn July 2021, Dorfman reintroduced herself to the world as a transgender woman.\n\nShe told Time magazine: \"For a year now, I have been privately identifying and living as a woman — a trans woman.\"\n\n\"I view today as a reintroduction to me as a woman, having made a transition medically.\"\n\n\"Coming out is always viewed as this grand reveal, but I was never not out.\"\n\n\"Today is about clarity: I am a trans woman. My pronouns are she/her. My name is Tommy.\"\n\nDorfman said that she will keep her name because she feels connected to the family history behind it.\n\nDorfman revealed that \"Tommy\" was the name of her mother's brother, who passed away a month after she was born.\n\nShe said: \"I feel very connected to that name, to an uncle who held me as he was dying.\n\n\"This is an evolution of Tommy. I’m becoming more Tommy.\"\n\nWhat role did Tommy Dorfman play in 13 Reasons Why?\n\nThe actress's big break came when she landed the role of Ryan Shaver in 13 Reasons Why.\n\nBased on Jay Asher's 2007 novel, the teen drama series premiered on Netflix in 2017.\n\nDorfman played Ryan Shaver, a student at Liberty High who betrayed Hannah's trust.\n\nHannah Baker was one of the show's main characters, portrayed by Katherine Langford.\n\nBefore landing her breakout role in 13 Reasons Why, Tommy made her acting debut as Jason in the 2009 short film Foreign Exchange.\n\nShe also appeared in the 2013 short film In My Skin.\n\nShe has since had recurring roles in Jane The Virgin and American Princess.\n\nDorfman has also appeared in episodes of Insatiable, Love, Victor, and Love In The Time Of Corona.\n\nIn October 2019, she received the GLAAD Rising Star Award.\n\nIn 2021, she appeared in the movie The Shuroo Process as Mark.\n\nIn 2022, she portrayed Tali in the movie Sharp Stick, written, directed, and produced by Lena Dunham.\n\nIn 2023, she co-wrote and directed I Wish You All The Best, starring Alexandra Daddario, Corey Fogelmanis, and Cole Sprouse.\n\nThe film is set to premiere in late 2024.\n\nIn December 2023, it was announced that Dorfman signed on to direct the movie adaptation of Mariko Tamaki's coming-of-age graphic novel, Laura Dean Keeps Breaking Up With Me.\n\nIs Tommy Dorfman married?\n\nOn May 2, 2024, Tommy Dorfman revealed she was officially married again.\n\nDorfman and her partner, Elise, had a \"spontaneous\" wedding in 2023.\n\nThey also decided to have an intimate family portrait session in Brooklyn at the end of 2023 to celebrate their recent nuptials with family and friends.\n\n“We decided that, at some point down the line, we would just elope,\" Dorfman told Vogue.\n\n\"Our love had formed and grown in a contained bubble, so why couldn’t our marriage be on the same terms?”\n\nDorfman also posted a few photos of the happy couple on her Instagram.\n\n\"I married my best friend and didn’t tell anyone except @hunterabrams who came and photographed us towards the end of last year,\" she captioned the post.\n\nIn August 2022, Tommy spoke about her then-new relationship status on Rachel Bilson's Broad Ideas podcast.\n\nShe announced her engagement during the episode, telling Bilson: \"I'm going to spend the rest of my life\" with her.\n\nWhile she didn't reveal the identity of her mystery woman, Dorfman did say that she is \"just a gay girl,\" and an Aries.\n\n\"I fell in love with someone who doesn't fetishize me,\" she added.\n\nThat girl was revealed to be Elise, who Dorfman says prefers to stay out of the public eye.\n\nElise has a private Instagram account and reportedly doesn't even follow Dorfman.\n\nDorfman was previously married to Peter Zurkuhlen.\n\nThe two tied the knot in 2016.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Zurkuhlen is a former real estate agent who founded the tech company ChipChop Systems and is the Chief of Staff at Get Help.\n\nDorfman revealed that they have redefined their relationship since coming out.\n\nShe said: \"I was in a nine-year relationship in which I was thought of as a more male-bodied person, with a gay man.\n\n\"I love him so much, but we’ve been learning that as a trans woman, what I’m interested in is not necessarily reflected in a gay man.\n\n\"So we’ve had incredible conversations to redefine our relationship as friends.”"
