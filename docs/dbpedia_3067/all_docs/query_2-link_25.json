        "text": "This week’s mystery movie was the 1955 RKO Superscope production Underwater! with Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan, Lori Nelson, Robert Keith, Joseph Calleia, Eugene Iglesias and Ric Roman.\n\nScreenplay by Walter Newman. Based on a story by Hugh King and Robert B. Bailey.\n\nPhotography by Harry J. Wild. Technicolor consultant James Gooch, underwater photography by Lamar Boren. Music by Roy Webb. Musical director C. Bakaleinikoff. Art directors Albert S. D’Agostino and Carroll Clark. Edited by Stuart Gilmore and Frederic Knudtson. Sound effects by Walter G. Elliott.\n\nSound by S.G. Haughton and Terry Kellum. Assistant director William Dorfman. Set decorations by Darrell Silvera and John Sturtevant. Costumes by Michael Woulfe. makeup by Mel Berns. Miss Russell’s makeup artist Layne Britton. Hairstyles by Larry Germain.\n\nProduced by Harry Tatelman.\n\nDirected by John Sturges.\n\nPresented by Howard Hughes.\n\nColor by Technicolor.\n\nUnderwater! is available on Blu-ray in a Warner Archive (RIP) release from the soon-to-close TCM shop.\n\n::\n\nI picked Underwater! by going through the trades and looking for a critically acclaimed film. The photography is striking and the plot is a standard adventure tale. Newspapers said the premiere was staged underwater in Silver Springs, Fla., with the audience 20 feet underwater in oxygen masks.\n\nMore on the history of the film is available from the AFI catalog.\n\nLet’s see what Bosley Crowther had to say about it. I’m guessing he’ll dismiss it as “old hat.”\n\nYes, it’s Bosley, all right, Feb. 10, 1955:\n\nThey have tried many ways of showing Jane Russell’s attractiveness in films, from rigging her out in low-cut dresses to pouring her into tight-fitting cowboy duds. Now they have put her in a swim suit, wearing a pair of mechanical gills and paddling around among the fishes in the subaqueous gloom of a sunken ship. This happens in Underwater! which came to the Mayfair yesterday. The title conveys a description and an estimation of the contents in one word.\n\nSeldom has anything so trifling as this story of delving for treasure beneath the seas been dished up as feature entertainment — or even as a special vehicle.\n\n… This presentation of Miss Russell is like one of those fountain pens that is guaranteed to write underwater. it is novel, but impractical. Miss Russell does nothing that she hasn’t done better above.\n\nFor Monday, we have a mystery fellow.\n\nUpdate: This is Eugene Iglesias.\n\nFor Tuesday, we have a mysterious musician.\n\nUpdate: This is Perez Prado.\n\nBrain Trust roll call: Mike Hawks (mystery movie and Monday’s mystery guest), Jenny M. (mystery movie and Monday’s mystery guest) and Howard Mandelbaum (mystery movie and Monday’s mystery guest). Adding: Mary Mallory (mystery movie and Monday’s mystery guest).\n\nNote: I am having continuing problems with comments disappearing, with Howard and Mary the latest victims. They’re not in the spam folder or in the trash; they’re gone. If I don’t give you proper credit, please drop me a note. Thanks!\n\nFor “Hm Wednesday,” we have a mystery guest.\n\nUpdate: This is Robert Keith.\n\nBrain Trust roll call: Mary Mallory (Tuesday’s mystery pianist), Howard Mandelbaum (Tuesday’s mystery pianist), Jenny M. (Tuesday’s mystery pianist) and Mike Hawks (Tuesday’s mystery pianist).\n\nFor “Aha Thursday,” we have a mystery gent.\n\nUpdate: This is the hardly recognizable Joseph Calleia.\n\nWe also have a mystery woman. And Back of the Head Guy.\n\nUpdate: This is Lori Nelson and Gilbert Roland as Back of the Head Guy.\n\nBrain Trust roll call: Mary Mallory (Wednesday’s mystery gent), Sylvia E. (mystery movie and all mystery guests), L.C. (mystery movie and mystery cast), Incredibleinman (Wednesday’s mystery gent), Howard Mandelbaum (Wednesday’s mystery gent), Richard Wegescheide (Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s mystery guests), Mike Hawks (Wednesday’s mystery gent), B.J. Merholz (mystery movie and Wednesday’s mystery gent), Pat in Michigan (mystery movie and Wednesday’s mystery guest), Gary (mystery movie and mystery movie’s tagline!), Benito (mystery movie and Wednesday’s mystery guest), Roget-L.A. (mystery movie and Wednesday’s mystery guest) and Tucson Barbara (Wednesday’s mystery guest).\n\nNote: Several more comments ended up in the trash folder. Thanks for your continued patience.\n\nFor Friday, we have a mystery fellow.\n\nUpdate: This is Gilbert Roland.\n\nAnd a second mystery gent.\n\nUpdate: This is Richard Egan.\n\nFinally, our mysterious leading lady.\n\nUpdate: This is Jane Russell."
