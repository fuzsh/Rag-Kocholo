        "text": "I hope you’re keeping safe and well. Between work trips and sales conference it’s been a few weeks for me, and there are a lot of covers this month, so I am going to stop prattling and let you get straight to the post…\n\nAnother Word for Love by Carvell Wallace; design by Rodrigo Corral (MCD / May 2024)\n\nBirding by Rose Ruane; design by Charlotte Stroomer; photograph by Kelsey McClellan (Little, Brown / May 2024)\n\nI feel like there was another ice cream book cover recently and that somehow Ben Denzer has manifested this.\n\nBlue Ruin by Hari Kunzru; design by John Gall; painting by Chad Wys (Knopf / May 2024)\n\nJohn Gall also designed the cover of Hari Kunzru’s previous novel Red Pill.\n\nChallenger by Adam Higginbotham; design by Pete Garceau (Avid Reader Press / May 2024)\n\nCoexistence by Billy-Ray Belcourt; design by Kelly Hill (Hamish Hamilton / May 2024)\n\nDead Animals by Phoebe Stuckes; design by Will Speed (Hodder & Stoughton / April 2024)\n\nEvenings and Weekends by Oisín McKenna; design by Jo Thomson (HarperCollins / May 2024)\n\nGlorious Exploits by Ferdia Lennon; design by Gregg Kulick (Henry Holt / March 2024)\n\nI was trying to think what this cover reminded me of, and then I remembered this.\n\nThe Great State of West Florida by Kent Wascom; design by Jeff Miller / Faceout Studio (Grove / May 2024)\n\nKairos by Jenny Erpenbeck; design by John Gall (New Directions / May 2024)\n\nThis is the cover of the newly released US paperback. John Gall also designed the cover for the hardback, published by New Directions last year. Author Jenny Erpenbeck and translator Michael Hofmann recently won the 2024 International Booker Prize with Kairos.\n\nKilworthy Tanner by Jean Marc Ah-Sen; design by David Drummond (Esplanade Books / May 2024)\n\nThis composition brings to mind David Pelham’s covers for J. G. Ballard. (On a semi-related note, air-brushed covers are probably overdue a revival. Or is it a dying art now?)\n\nKittentits by Holly Wilson; design by Eli Mock (Zando / May 2024)\n\nLike Love by Maggie Nelson; design by Suzanne Dean (Vintage / May 2024)\n\nSuzanne Dean also designed the cover of Bluets by Maggie Nelson.\n\nLoneliness & Company by Charlee Dyroff; design by Mia Kwon (Bloomsbury / May 2024)\n\nLove Junkie by Robert Plunket; design by Oliver Munday (New Directions / May 2024)\n\nOlive Munday bringing his A game.\n\nMonsters, Martyrs, and Marionettes by Adrienne Gruber; design by Tree Abraham (Book*hug / May 2024)\n\nThe Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley; design by Alison Forner; typography by Andrew Footit (Avid Reader Press / May 2024)\n\nThe Novices of Lerna by Ángel Bonomini; design by Sarah Schulte (Transit Books / May 2024)\n\nPerfume & Pain by Anna Dorn; design by Math Monahan (Simon & Schuster / May 2024)\n\nJust so much pink this month!\n\nThe Red Grove by Tessa Fontaine; design by Sara Wood (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / May 2024)\n\nThe Skunks by FIona Warnick; design by Beth Steidle (Tin House / May 2024)\n\nSupplication by Nour Abi-Nakhoul; design by Emma Dolan (Strange Light / May 2024)\n\nCan anyone tell me who designed the cover of the UK edition of Supplication for Influx Press? I’d love to include it in next month’s round-up when it’s published.\n\nThe Z Word by Lindsay King-Miller; design by Andie Reid (Quirk Books / May 2024)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAt the turn of the year, writer and activist Cory Doctorow coined the term “enshitification.” Although he was specifically describing the process of online services getting worse for users, it was hard not to see it everywhere in 2023.\n\nIn his annual look at the year’s best book covers for the New York Times, art director Matt Dorfman recounts a friend describing 2023 as a “year of survival”, a year of “no growth, no withering, just getting by.”\n\nThis year saw a centuries-old business contending with rounds of buyouts and layoffs, alongside an endless news cycle involving two brutal wars from which no authors, friends, enemies or strangers were immune from accountability for any unrehearsed sentiment they might voice in passing. Add to this the ongoing concern about how artificial intelligence will affect a business historically dependent upon human creativity — yet through it all, there was still the matter of making books, and their covers, to get on with.\n\nI read Matt’s piece the same day I read an article by Kyle Chayka in the New Yorker about his search for an epochal term to “evoke the panicky incoherence of our lives of late.” The suggestions range from the bland ‘Long 2016,’ to the incredibly ominous-sounding ‘Chthulucene,’ the Lovecraftian ‘New Dark Age,’ and the frankly terrifying and plausible ‘Jackpot’ from William Gibson’s 2014 novel The Peripheral.\n\nThis was the context of life and work in 2023.\n\nMatt notes some designers found inspiration in the zeitgeist. He’s not wrong. But, ironically perhaps, I feel less optimistic about the overall picture than he does.\n\nAt the risk of repeating what I’ve written in the past couple of years, it’s like we’re stuck in a holding pattern, circling the same design ideas. Trends have stuck around. A lot of covers feel safe. Some of this was the books themselves. I’m not sure exactly how many celebrity memoirs is too many, but I’m pretty sure we reached that point and sailed right past it in 2023. No doubt some of it is sales and marketing departments sanding down all the edges and demanding the tried and true (see Zachary Petit’s alternative best of 2023 piece on killed covers for Fast Company). But I would not be surprised if it designers were just getting caught up in the churn — too many books, too many covers, and too much other stuff to worry about.\n\nOr maybe it’s just me.\n\nOne of the themes of the year was nostalgia, which I’m sure can also be put down to the present being pretty fucking awful. It was apparent across almost all genres, including literary fiction, but nowhere more so than in the resurgent supernatural suspense and horror categories. There were creative stylistic mashups with retro vibes, along side fastidious Stranger Things-like homages to the 1980s and Stephen King.\n\nOne genuinely pleasant surprise was the number of interesting covers from Canadian publishers this year. They’ve been quietly risk-averse in recent years, so it was nice to see a few bolder design choices getting approved. I was happy to see a Canadian cover was one of the top picks on Literary Hub’s (very, very long) list of the best covers of 2023.\n\nThere were other things to cheer this year too.\n\nSpine continued to give space to designers to talk about their work in a way I’ve never been able to do consistently here. You can find their 2023 cover picks here.\n\nDavid Pearson started the Book Cover Review, a website for short reviews of book covers.\n\nZoe Norvell’s I Need A Book Cover, a resource for book cover inspiration as well as place for authors and publishers to connect with designers, also went live.\n\nSteve Leard launched Cover Meeting, a podcast series of in-depth interviews with cover designers (including David and Zoe among others). As Mark Sinclair notes in his piece on book cover design this year for Creative Review, Steve’s conversations shed light on wider concerns in the industry as well as each designer’s individual process.

The paperback is out next month.\n\nLast Resort by Andrew Lipstein; design Rodrigo Corral (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / January 2022)\n\nBetween this, and the covers of All Day is a Long Time, and Falling by T. J.

November pubs are always tricky.\n\nPatti recently posted a few of her covers from 2021 on Instagram. I like the cover of Today a Woman Went Mad in the Supermarket by Hilma Wolitzer a lot too.

I’ve featured a couple of the covers here in the past too.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nEarlier this year, a Canadian magazine asked me what the latest trends in book cover design were. I don’t think I had a very satisfactory answer. 2021 felt very much like a continuation of 2020, which itself felt like a year on hold.\n\nThe trends that came to mind were not exactly new. In no particular order: big faces (big sunglasses!); cropped faces; hands; mouths; postmodern typefaces; big skies; rainbows; gradients; the colour orange; psychedelia; collage; contemporary painting.\n\nA lot was made of “blob” covers this year. I’m not sure that anything has really changed since Vulture published this article about “blocky” covers in 2019. They seemed like much the same thing.\n\nDesign is about the constraints and, as it turns out, the constraints around designing commercial literary fiction covers that have to work just as well online as in bookstores can lead to similar design solutions — large, legible type, and bright, abstract backgrounds. The surprising thing is not that a few covers look the same when you squint; it’s that more of them don’t.\n\nThere were a lot of good covers (that didn’t look alike) in 2021. LitHub posted 101 of them. Still, it didn’t exactly feel like a vintage year.\n\nDo I say that every December? Possibly.\n\nA few years ago I worried that covers were moving in a more conservative direction, particularly at the big publishers. I’m not sure this has come to pass, at least not in the US. There are plenty of covers from the big, prestigious American literary imprints in this year’s list, as there were last year, and every year before that.\n\nThere are fewer covers from the UK in this year’s list than in previous years though, and I feel less confident about the situation there. From a distance, things seem a little sedate. I may be mistaken. It’s quite possible I haven’t see enough covers — or perhaps enough of the right ones — from British publishers to get a good sense of the overall picture.\n\nIt would not be a surprise, however, if publishers were feeling a little risk-averse at the moment. We are two years into a global pandemic, experiencing a major supply chain issues, and living through a seemingly endless series of sociopolitical crises.\n\nNor would it be a surprise if designers were personally feeling the effects too — I’m not sure we are talking about this enough, and I’m not sure I know how to.\n\nThank you to everyone who has supported the blog in 2021. It means a lot. Here are this year’s book covers of note…\n\nAfter the Sun by Jonas Eika; design by Lauren Peters-Collaer; art by Dorian Legret (Riverhead / August 2021)\n\nAmoralman by Derek Delgaudio; design by John Gall (Knopf / March 2021)\n\nAlso designed by John Gall:\n\nAnimal by Lisa Taddeo; design by Greg Heinimann (Bloomsbury / June 2021)\n\nGreg Heinimann talked to Creative Review about his work in April.\n\nAre You Enjoying? by Mira Sethi; design by Janet Hansen (Knopf / April 2021)\n\nAriadne by Jennifer Saint; design by Joanne O’Neill (Flatiron Books / May 2021)\n\nAlso designed by Joanne O’Neill:\n\nhe Art of Wearing a Trench Coat by Sergi Pàmies; design by Arsh Raziuddin and Oliver Munday (Other Press / March 2021)\n\nThe Atmospherians by Alex McElroy; design by Laywan Kwan (Atria / May 2021)\n\nBlack Village by Lutz Bassmann; design by Anne Jordan (Open Letter / December 2021)\n\nA Calling for Charlie Barnes by Joshua Ferris; design by Gregg Kulick (Little Brown and Company / September 2021)\n\nCome On Up by Jordi Nopca; design by Roman Muradov (Bellevue Literary Press / February 2021)\n\nConsent by Vanessa Springora; design by Stephen Brayda; art by Rozenn Le Gall (Harpervia / February 2021)\n\nStephen Brayda talked about his design for Consent with Spine Magazine.\n\nAlso designed by Stephen Brayda:\n\nThe Copenhagen Trilogy by Tove Ditlevsen; design by Na Kim (FSG / January 2021)\n\nNa Kim talked to PRINT about her career and the designs for the Ditlevsen series in February.

Perhaps it is a thing?\n\nAn American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser; design by Mark Abrams (Vintage / May 2021)\n\nAriadne by Jennifer Saint; design by Joanne O’Neill (Flatiron Books / May 2021)\n\nThe don’t look that similar side by side, by I was reminded of Will Staehle‘s 2018 cover for Circe by Madeline Miller, and the UK cover of the more recent Sistersong by Lucy Holland, designed by Melissa Four (I’m fairly sure I’ve seen an orange/red version of the Sistersong cover. Perhaps it was an ARC?).\n\nThe Art of Wearing a Trench Coat by Sergi Pàmies; design by Arsh Raziuddin and Oliver Munday (Other Press / March 2021)\n\nThe Atmospherians by Alex McElroy; design by Laywan Kwan (Atria / May 2021)\n\nDead Souls by Sam Riviere; design by Jamie Keenan; paper engineering and photography by Gina Rudd (Weidenfeld & Nicholson / May 2021)\n\nI thought David Drummond had maybe done a cover similar to this, but I couldn’t find one. David does like neutral backgrounds and cutting type though!\n\nDouble Trio by Nathaniel Mackey; design by Rodrigo Corral and Boyang Xia (New Directions / April 2021)\n\nThis is a 3 volume box set and all of the covers are spectacular…\n\nFault Lines by Emily Itami; design by Holly Ovenden (Orion Books / May 2021)\n\nThe cover of the US edition of Fault Lines, available this fall, was designed by Mumtaz Mustafa using a photograph by Tsuguaki Abe.\n\nFeatherweight by Mick Kitson; design by Helen Crawford-White (Canongate / May 2021)\n\nLiving in Data by Jer Thorp; design by Rodrigo Corral; art by Andrew Kuo (MCD / May 2021)\n\nWhen I first saw this cover I immediately thought there was some kind of link to Josef Albers ‘Homage a Square’ series, but nobody else seems to have mentioned it, so perhaps it is coincidental? Is that possible? I should probably pick up the book!\n\nThe Mission House by Carys Davies; design by Lauren Peters-Collaer (Scribner / February 2021)\n\nMona by Pola Oloixarac; design by Thomas Colligan (Farrar, Straus and Giroux / March 2021)\n\nMonsters by Alison Croggon; design by Daniel New (Scribe / March 2021)\n\nNectarine by Chad Campbell; design by David Drummond (Signal Editions / May 2021)\n\nThe Plot by Jean Hanff Korelitz; design by Anne Twomey (Celadon Books / May 2021)\n\nA Tall History of Sugar by Curdella Forbes; design by Gill Heeley (Canongate / February 2021)\n\nGill Heeley also designed the cover of the UK hardback edition of the book published last year…\n\nThings We Lost to the Water by Eric Nguyen; design by Chip Kidd (Knopf / May 2021)\n\nIt’s been a while since I’ve posted a Chip Kidd cover on the blog.

Cain.\n\nPermanent Record by Mary H. K. Choi; design by Lizzy Bromley; illustration by gg (Simon & Schuster / September 2019)\n\nThis reminded me of the panels of Tony Abruzzo romance comics that Roy Lichtenstein liked to lift from.\n\ngg also illustrated the cover of Mary H.

Title only appears on the spine (which, if my social media is anything to go by, gets big high fives from book designers everywhere).\n\nTo The Island of Tides by Alistair Moffat; Art by Andy Lovell; art direction Gill Heeley (Canongate / August 2019)\n\nIt’s lovely to see contemporary landscape art featuring prominently on book covers of late…\n\nThe Water Dancer by Ta-Nehisi Coates; design Greg Mollica; art Calida Garcia Rawles (One World / September 2019)\n\nThe New York Times ran a short article about the genesis of this cover earlier this year.\n\nFor the font-curious, the typeface is Alias Harbour according to the folks at Fonts In Use. Another calligraphic type alternative to the ubiquitous Lydian perhaps?\n\nWe Are the Lost and Found by Helene Dunbar; design Nicole Hower; illustration by Adams Carvalho (Sourcebooks / September 2019)\n\nThe World Doesn’t Require You by Rion Amilcar Scott; design by Laywan Kwan; art by Fahamu Pecou (Liveright / August 2019)\n\nAnd I am definitely here for the contemporary figure painting on book covers trend…\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s almost the first day of spring, the snow and ice have just about melted in Toronto (for now!), and everything is still awful, so it must be time for March’s book covers of note!\n\nBangkok Wakes to Rain by Pitchaya Sudbanthad; design by Grace Han (Riverhead / February 2019)\n\nThe Bird King by G. Willow Wilson; design by Helen Crawford-White (Grove / March 2019)\n\nThe Bold World by Jodie Patterson; design by Jaya Miceli (Ballantine / January 2019)\n\nBoşluktakiler by Tom McCarthy; design by David Drummond (Jaguar / February 2019)\n\nThis is the Turkish edition of Men in Space by Tom McCarthy. I like how the composition and colour palette echo the cover of the US edition published by Vintage, designed by John Gall:\n\nIt also reminds of the golden leaf cover for ‘True Faith’ by New Order designed by Peter Saville.\n\nThe Cook by Maylis de Kerangal; design by Na Kim (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / March 2019)\n\n(I feel like a Freudian could have a field day with this cover.)\n\nDaisy Jones and The Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid; design by Lauren Wakefield (Hutchinson / March 2019)\n\nThe cover of the US edition published by Ballantine (I couldn’t find an image without the book club sticker… sorry), was designed by Caroline Teagle Johnson. The book is getting a lot of buzz so I’ve seen both versions of the cover a lot online. It’s a pretty striking photo. I’m curious about where it came from…\n\nFollow This Thread by Henry Eliot; design by Elena Giavaldi (Three Rivers Press / March 2019)\n\nGood Kids, Bad City by Kyle Swenson; design by Henry Sene Yee (Picador / February 2019)\n\nHalibut on the Moon by David Vann; design by Erin Fitzsimmons (Grove / March 2019)\n\nHeroine by Mindy McGinnis; design by Erin Fitzsimmons (Katherine Tegen Books / March 2019)\n\nI’ve Been Meaning to Tell You by David Chariandy; design by Tree Abraham (Bloomsbury / March 2019)\n\nLanny by Max Porter; design by Jonny Pelham (Faber & Faber / March 2019)\n\nMidnight by Victoria Shorr; design by Sarah-May Wilkinson (Norton / March 2019)\n\nThis uses some very fancy metallic stock that you can’t really appreciate from the image.\n\nThe type reminded me a little of the cover of a Faber & Faber collection called Sex & Death from a couple of years ago designed by Luke Bird.\n\nThe Municipalists by Seth Fried; design by Matt Taylor (Penguin / March 2019)\n\nRutting Season by Mandeliene Smith; design by Grace Han (Scribner / February 2019)\n\nUnspeakable by Harriet Shawcross; design by Jamie Keenan (Canongate / March 2019)\n\nAnd sticking with blue-green covers…\n\nThe Wall by John Lanchester; design by Utku Lomlu (Norton / March 2019)\n\nThe cover of the UK edition published by Faber & Faber (featured in January’s post) was designed by Alex Kirby:\n\nWhen Brooklyn was Queer by Hugh Ryan; design by Rob Grom (St. Martin’s Press / March 2019)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis is my last monthly round-up for 2018. Next month I’ll post my round-up for the year. I have to confess that I have not given the blog 100% of my attention of late, so if you think that there are covers I might’ve overlooked this year please feel to send them my way for consideration.\n\nBitwise: A Life in Code by David Auerbach; design by Tyler Comrie (Pantheon / August 2018)\n\nThe Book of Beautiful Questions by Warren Berger; design by Tree Abraham (Bloomsbury / October 2018)\n\n‘Broadsword Calling Danny Boy’ by Geoff Dyer; design Jim Stoddart (Penguin / October 2018)\n\nThe blackletter is similar, I believe, to the type used for the movie title / credits, and the chevrons are a nice reference to a design that appears in the movie. The Guardian reviewed the book last month if you are curious. (And someone in the UK needs to buy it for me as a Christmas present!)\n\nThe Deserters by Pamela Mulloy; design by David Drummond (Véhicule Press / September 2018)\n\nEvening in Paradise by Lucia Berlin; design by Na Kim (Farrar, Straus and Giroux / November 2018)\n\nNa Kim designed the cover for Welcome Home by Lucia Berlin, also released this month, too:\n\nThe cover of the UK edition of Evening in Paradise was designed by Justine Anweiler I believe. Justine designed the wonderful cover for hardback of A Manual For Cleaning Women:\n\nFeminasty by Erin Gibson; design by Anne Twomey; photograph by Ricky Middlesworth (Grand Central / September 2018)\n\nUsually I’m a bit reluctant to post the covers of celebrity books, but this is pretty great.\n\nCelebrity book covers are often look beautiful — the recent memoirs by Sally Fields and Michelle Obama come to mind — but often that’s because of a glamourous photograph. The designer’s job is just to get out of the way. That makes sense from a marketing point of view, it’s just not terribly interesting from a design perspective. This feels like it has a bit more to it somehow. Or maybe it’s just more fun…\n\nThat all said, I have started to see this kind of swashy retro type pop-up more frequently of late. A couple of recent examples that come to mind are the covers of All the Beautiful Girls by Elizabeth J. Church, designed by Anna Morrison (Fourth Estate), and The Dakota Winters by Tom Barbash designed by Allison Saltzman (Ecco):\n\nI was also reminded of Kelly Winton‘s covers designs for the reissues of Black Swans and Sex and Rage by Eve Babitz from Counterpoint.\n\nI would guess the fonts are Bodoni or variants thereof, but no doubt someone with a better eye for type will be able to tell us for sure.\n\nUPDATE: Anna Morrison tells me the font she used for All the Beautiful Girls is Cabernet, which just goes to show what I know. According to the ever-useful Fonts in Use, Cabernet is “an uncredited revival of Benguiat Caslon, a 1970s Photo-Lettering typeface by Ed Benguiat.” I’m pretty sure Benguiat Caslon was used for the iconic Philip Roth covers in the 1970s so I probably should’ve recognized it…\n\nThe Feral Detective by Jonathan Lethem; design Allison Saltzman; photograph Kate Bellm (Ecco Press / November 2018)\n\nHeavy by Kiese Laymon; design by Na Kim (Scribner / October 2018)\n\nHippie by Paulo Coelho; design by Tyler Comrie (Knopf / September 2018)\n\nIs this the year of the orange cover…?\n\nThe Hole by José Revueltas; design by John Gall (New Directions / November 2018)\n\nJohn Gall has a new book collecting 10 years of his collages out this month too.\n\nYou can read my 2011(!) Q & A with John about his collages here.\n\nHomeland by Walter Kempowski; design by Dan Mogford (Granta / November 2018)\n\nDan also designed the cover for All for Nothing by Walter Kempowski a couple of years ago:\n\nI Do Not Trust You by Laura J.Burns & Melinda Metz; design by Olga Grlic (St. Martin’s Press / September 2018)\n\nI had it in my mind that snaky red covers with big white type were very “in” for thrillers right now, but the only other example I could think of was the US cover for Our Kind of Cruelty by Araminta Hall designed by Alex Merto, which is really not that similar…\n\nPerhaps I am imagining it.\n\nThe Library Book by Susan Orlean; design by Lauren Peters-Collaer (Simon & Schuster / October 2018)\n\nNotes from the Fog by Ben Marcus; design by Jamie Keenan (Granta / September 2018)\n\nThe US cover, which I featured in a previous post, was designed by Peter Mendelsund:\n\nOdessa Stories by Isaac Babel; design by Anna Morrison (Puhskin Press / November 2018)\n\nPortraits Without Frames by Lev Ozerov; design by Dan Mogford (Granta / November 2018)\n\nThe Son of Black Thursday by Alejandro Jodorowsky; design by Richard Ljoenes (Restless Books / November 2018)\n\nRichard also designed the cover of Jodorowsky’s previous novel Where the Bird Sings Best:\n\nAnd take a moment to check out Richard’s online portfolio, which is new I believe.\n\nWasteland by W. Scott Poole; design by Jaya Miceli (Counterpoint / November 2018)\n\nThe Winters by Lisa Gabriele; design by Nayon Cho (Viking / October 2018)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHere are the book covers that caught my eye this month…\n\nBeirut Hellfire Society by Rawi Hage; design by Lisa Jager (Knopf Canada / August 2018)\n\nThe Boatbuilder by Daniel Gumbiner; design by Sunra Thompson (McSweeney’s / May 2018)\n\nThis goes rather nicely with Sunra’s cover for the hardcover of All My Puny Sorrows by Miriam Toews…\n\nThe Boneless Mercies by April Genevieve Tucholke; design by Elizabeth H. Clark; illustration by Will Staehle (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / October 2018)\n\nThe Death Scene Artist by Andrew Wilmot; design by Michel Vrana (Wolsak & Wynn / October 2018)\n\nI guess skulls aren’t going out of fashion any time soon!\n\n‘Exterminate the Brutes’ by Sven Lindqvist; design by Luke Bird (Granta / October 2018)\n\nOne for the maps list.\n\nThe Fifth Risk by Michael Lewis; design by Pete Garceau (W. W. Norton / October 2018)\n\nI feel like I should at least try to collect some of the best political covers from the past year or so together into a post at some point. On the other hand, I really don’t want to…\n\nGin: Distilled by Gin Foundry; design by James Paul Jones (Ebury Press / October 2018)\n\nThe Infinite Blacktop by Sara Gran; design by Alex Merto (Atria Books / September 2018)\n\nNervous States by William Davies; design by Suzanne Dean (Jonathan Cape / September 2018)\n\nNo Country Woman by Zoya Patel; design by Astred Hicks (Hachette Australia / August 2018)\n\nOcéans by James Hyndman; design by David Drummond (Les Éditions XYZ / September 2018)\n\nRabbit & Robot by Andrew Smith; Design by Lucy Ruth Cummins; art by Mike Perry (Simon & Schuster / September 2018)\n\nRed Birds by Mohammed Hanif; design by Greg Heinimann (Bloomsbury / October 2018)\n\nSawkill Girls by Claire Legrand; design by Aurora Parlagreco; illustration by Ruben Ireland (Katherine Tegen Books / October 2018)\n\nSomething Great and Beautiful by Enrico Pellegrini; design by Gray318 (Other Press / September 2018)\n\nI’m not entirely sure why, but cover of Something Great and Beautiful brought to mind the 2014 cover of the UK edition of The Empathy Exams by Leslie Jamison, designed by Tom Darracott for Granta. They’re really not that similar, and yet…\n\nSon of Amity by Peter Nathaniel Malae; design by David Drummond (Oregon State University Press / October 2018)\n\nStatistics Without Tears by Derek Rowntree; design by Matthew Young (Penguin / June 2018)\n\nThere Will Be No Miracles Here by Casey Gerald; design by Grace Han (Riverhead Books / October 2018)\n\nAre black and white stripes / op art having a moment in New York?\n\nBoth these covers reminded me of Riverhead art director Helen Yentus’s black and white cover for The Stranger by Albert Camus:\n\nWasted Calories and Ruined Nights by Jay Rayner; design by Dan Mogford (Faber & Faber / October 2018)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
