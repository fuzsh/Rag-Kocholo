        "text": "Tommy Dorfman is going behind the camera, and she’s highlighting nonbinary and trans talent while doing it.\n\nThe 13 Reasons Why star recently announced that she’s making her directorial debut with the film adaptation of the young adult novel I Wish You All the Best.\n\n“I’m so excited to finally announce that I’m going to be directing my first film this fall. It’s called I Wish You All the Best,” Dorfman said in an Instagram video. “I also wrote this film, and I based it off of the hit novel by Mason Deaver.”\n\nThe book follows 17-year-old nonbinary teen Ben De Backer, who, after coming out to their parents, is thrown out and forced to move in with their estranged older sister and her husband. At first they try to hide their identity at their new school, but when a charismatic student named Nathan befriends them, things start to change.\n\nDorfman also announced that she is seeking a nonbinary actor to star in the movie — and she’s holding an open casting call.\n\n“We are casting somebody to play a non-binary teenager in North Carolina who is coming of age and falling in love, and figuring out who they are after a tragic incident with their family,” she said.\n\n“So, if you fit this description in any way shape, or form, and you are interested in auditioning for this film, and you think you can play the role of Ben and carry this movie alongside some really amazing actors this fall, starting shooting in October, I believe. Then please, please, please go to Atomic Honey's casting page,” she added.\n\nThe post also encourages prospective stars to email iwishyouallthebestcasting@gmail.com.\n\nIf you think you might be the next big nonbinary teen actor, submit your audition today!"
