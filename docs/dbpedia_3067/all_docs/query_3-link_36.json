        "text": "The Great Gildersleeve\n\nVolume 7\n\nTThe Great Gildersleeve portrayed its lead character as not only a family man, but also as one of Summerfield’s most eligible bachelors. Perhaps one of the best remembered suitors pursuing Gildy was the one who actually almost caught him. The Widow Ransom, played by Shirley Mitchell, spoke with a syrupy Southern drawl, referring to her man as ‘Throck-mahhhtin’. The Widow’s pursuit of Gildersleeve was a major part of the early shows, leading right up to the altar itself. In June 1943, the nuptials were interrupted, when the Widow’s supposedly dead husband interrupted the services! Making use of such dramatic turns is just one reason The Great Gildersleeve stood out as more than just another comedy.\n\nSummerfield, the setting for The Great Gildersleeve, was a town that typified small town America. Most of the episodes took place within eight blocks around the Gildersleeve home. There was a park nearby. Mr. Peavey’s drugstore cornered on the street that Gildy lived on, Judge Hooker living just across the street from the pharmacy. Down the avenue was Floyd’s Barber Shop, which would become home to the unofficial fraternal order Gildy would join, the Jolly Boys. A water reservoir also was oddly placed in this eight block area, but would prove to provide Gildy with something he needed- a job as water commissioner.\n\nThe Great Gildersleeve stood out as one of the comedy shows that took advantage of a device usually reserved for soap operas or movie matinees - serial storylines. Beginning with the Widow Ransom’s pursuit of Gildy, having stories spread over several episodes became somewhat a standard for the show. These events that took up several episodes often revolved around Gildy’s love life and the chaos that ensued\n\nTune in to the twelve original broadcasts in this collection to find out just what sort of love and trouble Gildy gets into, presented as they originally aired, complete with Kraft Foods commercials.
