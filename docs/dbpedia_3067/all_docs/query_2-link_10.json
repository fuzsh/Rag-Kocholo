He's killed before, and he lets the two know that as soon as they're no longer useful, he'll kill again. The two friends plot an escape, but the hitchhiker's peculiar physical affliction, an eye that never closes even when he sleeps, makes it impossible for them to tell when they can make a break for it.",

        "text": "Faces suspended in a void have nothing but their own grim performances to convey. The desert setting does not serve to create the touted claustrophobia; it's the shadows, the darkness that encompasses them in open spaces, around campfires, under the stars. Light only shows the most prominent clue to their emotional states and nothing more, leaving the viewer trapped intimately with the three men. When the light returns, the wide open spaces offer barrenness. The feeling isn't claustrophobia; it's preemptive weariness at the thought of that sweat-drenched, dry-mouthed, rock-scoured journey.\n\nOthers speak of the tension, but it becomes clear early on that what these men face isn't death. They face torment. Their lifespans are defined by how long an arbitrary…\n\nA marvel of economy, Ida Lupino's cut to the bone roadway thriller remains a tense and to the point white knuckle ride all these years later.\n\n\"When was the last time you invited death into your car?\" (tagline from the U.S. Poster)\n\nIt kicks off with one of the more harrowing opening credit sequences of the day, following the demise of multiple victims at the hand of an unknown serial killer. Lupino presents the roadside deaths in such a matter-of-fact way that by the time the killer jumps into the back seat of a car with the film's other two leads...the viewer is well aware of the precarious position these men are in. It all happens within the movie's first…\n\nAction! - Female 4 Front: Breaking Grounds With Ida Lupino\n\nWith this film, which in many ways represents Ida Lupino's zenith, the director proves that she is at her best when she is not relying on melodrama but instead crafting works that are fraught with great tension.\n\nThe cinematography and camera work are somewhat minimalist but effective for the most part in employing the characteristic elements of film noir (which this actually makes history by becoming the first mainstream film within the genre directed by a woman) to create these great moments of tension and even horror, such as the scene where our two victims are about to be run over by our killer.\n\nWhen it comes to the characters,…\n\nBased on a true story, The Hitch-Hiker comes by its all-male core honestly, but that doesn't make its exploration of masculinity any less interesting.\n\nIn the absence of the woman who would traditionally be the most vulnerable victim in a situation like the one portrayed in the film, everything is forced to shift. The kidnapper (Emmett Myers, played by William Talman) has no clear focus for his threats, and his male victims (Edmund O'Brien as Roy Collins, and Frank Lovejoy as Gilbert Bowen) are left without someone for whom they can make noble sacrifices — or, of equal importance, before whom they feel compelled to embody the most tradition kind of masculine strength. The result leaves a vacuum behind, a…\n\nI call this movie Psychological Horror Noir. The terror the victims receive from the demented serial killer / kidnappper is enough to put you in therapy for life, if you’re able to survive the ordeal.\n\nThe Hitch-Hiker is lean and mean. With only a 70 minute runtime, it gets everything out with every minute used just right. A lot of credit goes to Director Ida Lupino. She is fantastic. She also gets every bit of energy and emotion out of her actors, and she keeps the suspense alive by using different locations. She’s a damn good director, and was the only woman I know of who was directing films in the 1950s. Much respect to a badass director.\n\nEach of…"
