Cheers…\n\nDEERE JOHN (20th Anniversary Restoration)\n\nIt’s the 20th anniversary of this, my first dance-film. Often considered my signature film, I’ve gone back to the original footage and completely reconstructed it with newer video technology—and it looks great. Enjoy. A man and a 22-ton John Deere excavator dance a dance of discovery, fulfillment, and loss. Winner of 19 festival awards. “A funny and surprisingly touching fantasy.” — The New York Times\n\nEXQUISITE CORPS\n\nBefore there was And So Say All of Us, there was Exquisite Corps. 42 contemporary choreographers chain together making one dance. One million views.\n\nNotebook (3 experiments)\n\nA trilogy of films featuring choreography of Bebe Miller and a performance by Douglas Dunn… and 120 other people.\n\nOr is this the dance? See Mitchell filming Douglas Dunn here.\n\nWEHNU SAÏ\n\nWehnu Saï means “unity in many” and was made as a response to the forced isolation of the pandemic. One piece of Africanist choreography is performed by 140 people.\n\nSee the “Making Of” here."
