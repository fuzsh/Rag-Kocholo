        "text": "Hollywood never knew a man who could write such a nasty line into a screenplay as could Clifford Odets.\n\nMaybe one other man, but that man was Billy Wilder.\n\nUnfortunately, there was also hardly a director who could very well wrangle the complex intellect in Odets’ text into something resembling a cohesive motion picture.\n\nHarold Clurman, the man behind the camera of noir “Deadline at Dawn,” was not one of those directors. Much like Odets’ scripts, Clurman worked better on the stage. He was a long time colleague of Odets from the time the two were members of the Group Theatre, the institution responsible for introducing Method Acting to America via the conduit of Lee Strasberg. Clurman and Odets partnered…\n\n\"This is New York... where 'hello' means 'goodbye.'\"\n\nThere are many reasons to check out the NYC noir Deadline at Dawn, adapted by Clifford Odets from a Cornell Woolrich novel and also notable as the lone film made by Harold Clurman (famed Broadway director and then-husband of legendary acting teacher Stella Adler), but I'll narrow the checklist down to just two people: Susan Hayward and Steven Geray.\n\nWhen I think of Susan Hayward, certain film genres come to mind: the biopics of immense suffering (With a Song in My Heart, I'll Cry Tomorrow, I Want to Live!); the super-soapy melodramas (My Foolish Heart, Back Street, Where Love Has Gone); the ancient odysseys (David and Bathsheba, Demetrius and the Gladiators); and,…\n\n\"The logic you are looking for... the logic is that there is no logic. The horror and terror you feel, my dear, comes from being alive. Die, and there is no trouble. Live, and you struggle.\"\n\nUnlike similar noirs about the guilt of being saddled with a big pile of cash or about the greed of wanting to keep it, this one's just about having the money and trying to do the right thing with it (return it to is owner; a little guy too benevolent and altruistic to keep what’s not rightfully his, unlike the covetous capitalists who are more than happy to exploit you for your labor), and about how sometimes the folks who help you out are…\n\n*JUST HUNDREDS OF SPOILERS. SEE THE FILM FIRST. DO, IT’S GREAT*\n\nThere’s a purposefully offbeat scene in this brilliant humanist noir from the typewriter of Clifford Odets, in which a sailor trying to solve a murder sees a nervy man dash from a building next to the crime scene. He tails the man… right to the door of a vet’s, where the suspect breaks down in tears. It’s closed, and he was too late anyway. His cat is dead.\n\nThere are other stories, you see. And this film intersects with those. In the irritating vernacular of 2020, it is “noir adjacent”. The cat vignette seems the sort of thing that would happen during the night, in the New York of…\n\nDensely written and very stagey murder mystery that makes good use of several tropes that would become Noir standbys.\n\nBill Williams nice but dim sailor gets blackout drunk with a woman he meets in a bar and when he starts to sober up finds he has a whole lot of unexpected cash. Pulling Susan Hayward's taxi dancer along as he tries to return it he finds a corpse and sets on clearing his name before returning to his base the next morning.\n\nHayward's sharp outwardly tough dance hall girl steals the show, a little too cynical to really go along with it all but won over by Williams sweet niavety. She's not the most believable character, it's not the most…"
