        "text": "Economy & Jobs\n\nSupporting Virginia Businesses & Entrepreneurs Rep. Spanberger is focused on advancing legislation that grows Virginia’s economy, supports Virginia’s small businesses, reduces unnecessary regulatory burdens, cuts red tape, and invests in critical physical infrastructure improvements. She is proud to have received the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s “Jefferson-Hamilton Award for Bipartisanship” for her work to bring Democrats and Republicans together to advance legislation that supports Virginia’s economy, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s “Spirit of Enterprise Award” for her leadership on policies that help grow Virginia’s small businesses. Strengthening Workforce Training & Apprenticeship Programs Whether they choose to go to college or not, Rep. Spanberger believes that all Virginia workers should have access to the education and training they need to achieve career success, earn a good living, and keep the Commonwealth the best place in the country to raise a family, work, and start a business. Rep. Spanberger is working to increase investments in vocational training and apprenticeship programs for young people. These programs lead to better-paying jobs, meet the workforce demands of our local businesses, and make sure the next generation of Virginians stays ahead in a competitive and rapidly changing global economy.\n\nHealthcare\n\nExpanding Access to Affordable Healthcare Coverage Virginians deserve strong access to quality, affordable health insurance, and Rep. Spanberger is fighting to protect the healthcare coverage of Virginians. She believes in stabilizing the Affordable Care Act and preserving its protections for the more than 1.3 million Virginians with pre-existing conditions. Rep. Spanberger is also working to reduce premiums in the insurance marketplace and to lower out-of-pocket costs. She supports universal coverage through the adoption of a public option and, in Congress, she advocates for solutions that achieve real progress, respond to the unique challenges of Virginia’s rural communities, support the Commonwealth’s Medicaid expansion, and preserve funding for critical programs like the Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP). Lowering Prescription Drug Costs As Rep. Spanberger meets with families, patients, providers, and community healthcare organizations across Virginia’s Seventh District; she repeatedly hears about the financial struggles facing seniors, families, and those with chronic conditions as their prescription drug costs continue to rise. That’s why Rep. Spanberger voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act — which gave Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices, capped insulin copays at $35 per month for seniors on Medicare, and capped out-of-pocket costs for Virginia seniors. She believes that no one in the Commonwealth should have to choose between putting food on the table or paying for their lifesaving medications. That’s why she has also led several bipartisan efforts to hold transnational pharmaceutical companies accountable, increase transparency, and reduce America’s dependence on nations like China for essential medications. Addressing the Opioid Abuse & Addiction Epidemic Rep. Spanberger recognizes that the addiction and overdose crisis is a deadly epidemic happening in our country. She’s spoken to too many families who have lost loved ones to addiction and overdose. Rep. Spanberger supports a national response that invests in preventing overdoses, expanding access to treatment, and supporting individuals in recovery from addiction as they seek to reclaim their health and well-being. She believes that an effective response involves working directly with community leaders, law enforcement officials, religious organizations, and healthcare professionals to build an actionable strategy to provide treatment, recovery, and wraparound services to everyone impacted by the opioid epidemic. In 2022, the President signed into law Rep. Spanberger’s bipartisan legislation — the Summer Barrow Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Act — that provides major funding for programs that focus on overdose prevention, first responder training, co-prescribing, and alternatives to opioids in emergency rooms. Defending Women’s Healthcare Access Rep. Spanberger believes that protecting women’s access to reproductive healthcare is a social and economic necessity. In the wake of the Dobbs decision, which undermined decades of established precedent and settled case law, Rep. Spanberger has focused on taking steps against policies that undermine the right to privacy and a woman’s right to choose. She has voted to codify Roe v. Wade into law, protect contraception access, and defend the right of Americans to travel across state lines to seek lawful abortions. Additionally, Rep. Spanberger — a Member of the Black Maternal Health Caucus — is actively seeking innovative, bipartisan legislative solutions to help combat rising rates of maternal mortality in the United States, particularly within historically underserved and disadvantaged communities in Virginia. She also supports maintaining federal funding to Planned Parenthood and other providers that provide essential healthcare screenings and preventive services to both women and men."
