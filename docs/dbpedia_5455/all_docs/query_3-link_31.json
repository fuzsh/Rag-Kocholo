        "text": "Law\n\nUnder Maryland Election Law, Section 13-505, counties may establish their own system of public campaign financing. In September 2014 the Council unanimously enacted Bill 16-14, which established a Public Election Fund to provide public campaign financing for County Executive and County Council candidates. When the Council enacted Bill 16-14 it was the first measure of its type in the Washington metropolitan region and in Maryland. The Council amended its campaign finance law in 2018 with Bill 40-18, and again in 2020 with Bill 31-20.\n\nThe goals of this law are to:\n\nEncourage greater voter participation in County elections\n\nIncrease opportunities for more residents to run for office\n\nReduce the influence of large contributions from businesses, political action groups and other large organizations\n\nThe Maryland State Board of Elections is responsible for certifying candidates and generally administering the public campaign financing system.\n\nThe County’s Director of Finance is responsible for establishing a Public Election Fund and distributing the public contributions to certified candidates.\n\nThe Council is responsible for appropriating funds. As of January 2021, the Council has appropriated $7.2 million to the Public Election Fund.\n\nTo qualify for public financing, a candidate would have to:\n\nFile a Notice of Intent prior to collecting qualifying contributions\n\nEstablish a publicly funded campaign account\n\nRefuse to accept a contribution from any group or organization including a political action committee, a corporation, a labor organization or a State or local central action committee of a political party\n\nCollect a qualifying number of contributions from County residents: at least 500 for County Executive candidates, 250 for at-large Council candidates and 125 for district Council candidates\n\nMeet qualifying dollar thresholds ($40,000 for County Executive, $20,000 for at-large Councilmember and $10,000 for a district Councilmember)\n\nNot accept a contribution from a resident of greater than $250 per 4-year election cycle.\n\nOnly contributions from County residents are eligible for matching funds, which are as follows:\n\nCounty Executive candidates - $6 for each dollar of the first $50 of a qualifying contribution received from a County resident, $4 for each dollar for the second $50, and $2 for each dollar for the third $50.\n\nCounty Council candidates - $4 for each dollar of the first $50 received from a County resident, $3 for each dollar for the second $50, and $2 for each dollar for the third $50.\n\nThe maximum limits on public funds per candidate for either the primary election or the general election are $750,000 for a County Executive candidate, $250,000 for a Council at-large candidate and $125,000 for a district Council candidate. Matching funds will only be disbursed to a certified candidate in a contested election and will not be distributed for self/spouse contributions to candidates running unopposed.\n\nA candidate who wins the nomination after receiving County matching funds up to the maximum for the office during the primary, may continue to receive matching funds from the County up to the maximum amount for that office during a contested general election for additional qualifying contributions received.\n\nPublic contributions to certified candidates must be used for primary or general election expenses. With certain limited exceptions, candidates must return any unspent public campaign funds after withdrawing as a candidate, losing in a primary election or at the conclusion of the general election.\n\nFurther details on the County’s public campaign financing can be found in the ARTICLE IV. PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FINANCING. (amlegal.com)."
