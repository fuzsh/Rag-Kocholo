        "text": "Changing the destiny of Muslims: Union Ministry of Minority Affairs’ multi-sectoral development program The developmental plans in the minority-majority districts have been causing changes in 90 districts of India. Photo Courtesy: UNI The minority communities in India, as identified under section 2 (c) of the National Commission for Minority Act, 1992, include Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Parsis, and Jains. The ‘Multi-Sectoral Development Program for Minorities’ is the official name of this scheme. The Union Ministry of Minority Affairs, Government of India oversees the implementation of this scheme. The scheme holds a significant value for Muslims due to their high poverty rate in India. While 53% of Dalit men are employed, only 48% of Muslims have jobs. Similarly, 23% of Dalit women are employed compared to only 9.6% of Muslim women. According to the 2001 census, the literacy rate of the country is 64.80%, but among Muslims, it is only 59.10%. The inadequate access to clean drinking water is also resulting in a higher average rate of illness among Muslims, as only 19% of their homes have plumbing. The Government of India is committed to improving the situation as it is extremely serious. The multi-sectoral development program has completed 14 years and is now showing positive outcomes in numerous districts. Out of the 90 districts identified under the Multisectoral Development Program, the majority of them are in Uttar Pradesh. In this program, 21 districts have been identified in Uttar Pradesh, 13 in Assam, 12 in West Bengal, 7 each in Bihar and Arunachal Pradesh, 6 in Manipur, 4 each in Jharkhand and Maharashtra, 2 each in Haryana, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, and Mizoram, and 1 each in Delhi, Meghalaya, Andaman and Nicobar, and Orissa. The scheme covers the states of Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Sikkim, and Ladakh, along with 338 towns and 1228 blocks of class 1. The scheme focuses on districts and towns with a minority population of 25% or more. By including towns and blocks at the local level, the scheme ensures the coverage of minority areas even in states that are not listed in the district-level scheme. For example, Punjab and Rajasthan are not in the national list of 90 districts, but the scheme covers 26 towns in Punjab and 16 towns in Rajasthan based on the town list. However, this does not mean that towns or blocks in districts are excluded. For instance, Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of 21 districts covered under the MCD scheme, and it also includes an additional 71 towns under the scheme. The objective of the scheme is to improve infrastructure for education, skills development, health, sanitation, shelter, roads, drinking water, and create income opportunities for minorities. It is a joint effort between the Central and State governments. The scheme not only fills the gaps in existing government schemes but also provides additional resources for minority welfare projects to expedite development in t...\n\n🔵 Three points to understand whether MP is still a BIMARU state or not Political battle in Madhya Pradesh is at its peak! Recently, while addressing a public rally, PM Modi made a remark where he said that MP is no longer a BIMARU state. This narrative was further promoted by other party leaders including the present CM of MP. Opposition engaged in counterclaims. But, the most interesting thing in this whole argument is neither the ruling party nor the opposition cited any data to substantiate their claims. And, that generated a curiosity in me to look at what numbers actually say about the state of development in MP. Hence, this short write-up is to bring things into perspective and be able to see where our state stands! Whether MP is still a BIMARU state or not? I have three quick responses to it: 1. Low ranking in overall poverty reduction: The most simple way to understand this whole debate is, despite whatever the argument is, MP is the 5th poorest state in India and it continues to hold this position in NFHS 2015 and 2019 as well. No change there. 2. MP ranks poorly in most of the social indicators: Out of 12 crucial social indicators that the Poverty Index of India uses, MP ranks poorly in most of them barring three or four. These indicators are as important as nutrition, cooking fuel, drinking water etc. In fact, in most of these indicators, we are far worse than the national average. For instance: The national average of the population without drinking water is 7%. However, for MP it is 22%. That's huge! 3. Significant improvement still a long way to go: After UP (3 cr 42 lakh), Bihar (2 cr 25 lakh), MP has been able to pull the maximum people out of poverty (1 cr 35 lakh). This is really significant. Also, the improvements made in indicators like sanitation (from 65% in 2015 to almost 35% in 2019), bank accounts, and electricity are worth applauding. Yet, as mentioned above, this has not been enough to improve the rankings of the state in the overall poverty index. 🔴 Some important caveats: - This is a small effort to present an overall and simplified picture of such a complex issue. There are multiple other factors to look at this data and interpret. But this is to develop a general understanding of the issue. - MDPI has its own drawbacks and critics but for the sake of this analysis, we continue to rely on it as it is. - Also, we are not economists. But a bunch of public policy and development professionals from MP who love to see things through data. Hope this helps! 👉 We (The Analysis) will try and bring more such simple-to-understand insights and perspectives on developmental issues in Madhya Pradesh.

The universally accepted Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI) brings into its ambits the dimensions of health, education and living standards – each of which either expand or restrict human capabilities by posing as either a resource or a constraint. Thus establishing the multiple deprivation that the poor face simultaneously - lack of money, time, calories, health, education and geographic or social isolation that lead to varied incidences of poverty with differential intensity. Development economist, Michael Lipton speaks of the ‘ultra-poor’ - the most deprived of the lot who spend 80 percent of their total expenditures on food and still cannot attain 80 percent of their standard caloric needs. Why are the 'ultra-poor' still underserved in spite of the back-breaking efforts of the government's progressive welfare agenda ? In the book, Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty; the authors Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo ponder on ways to improve the lives of the poor and their capabilities to achieve betterment. It speaks about the ‘extra push’ that the poor require to get started and the enablers that help them sustain at a certain level of living standards. There is thus an ardent need for blended and innovative service-models and diverse financing instruments for the poorest of poor besides enabling their access to the marketplace so that they can overcome their inherent low risk-taking and entrepreneurial behavior. SETU -Graduation Approach Pilot in Assam under DAY-NRLM (and its counter-part ASRLM) is a step in this direction. Dr. Rousy K. Baruah and I write on the need of such projects to run-over poverty traps and in building resilient communities.

It shows that 34.1 per cent of Bihar’s population has a monthly household income of Rs 6,000 or less. This benchmark figure of Rs 6000 per month corresponds to what the official “poverty line” itself should be on the government’s own criterion, though these days the government has stopped talking about the poverty line altogether; it has adopted instead the concept of “multi-dimensional poverty” propagated by some international organisations which shows only 15 per cent of the country’s population in poverty! Bihar, it is true, does not represent the country as a whole, but the Bihar Survey figure is so large that the pervasiveness of poverty in the country cannot be denied. https://bit.ly/3sQSaAm\n\nOne of the striking findings of the Bihar Caste Survey, which bears out what the Left has been asserting for a long time, is that absolute poverty in the country is far more pervasive than what successive governments in India have been claiming.
