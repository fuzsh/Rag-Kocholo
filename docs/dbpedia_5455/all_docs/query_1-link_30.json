        "text": "District 3\n\nThe District\n\nThis district stretches the Bay Area and Sacramento: It includes the eastern part of California’s wine country, as well as parts of Contra Costa, Solano and Yolo counties. The district was designed to keep together counties along the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, as well as farming communities.\n\nVoter registration: 49.6% Democrat, 22.5% Republican, 20.7% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nFive candidates are vying for Sen. Bill Dodd’s seat as he reaches his term limit. Rozzana Verder-Aliga, vice mayor of Vallejo, received Dodd’s blessing and also earned endorsements from the California Democratic Party, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and State Treasurer Fiona Ma. Verder-Aliga is a mental health professional by trade, and has significantly outraised her Democratic competitors. Christopher Cabaldon, West Sacramento’s mayor from 1998 to 2020, is credited with transforming the city. He was also the first openly gay Filipino person in the U.S. to be elected mayor. Jackie Elward — also a Democrat and a city councilmember in Rohnert Park, has worked for clean power and homelessness organizations in Solano County. She was the first Black woman to be elected in Rohnert Park.\n\nTwo Republicans have also entered the race, though they face an uphill battle in the predominantly Democratic district: Thom Bogue, a city councilmember and former mayor from Dixon, and Jimih Jones, an automotive parts salesman who unsuccessfully ran in the Fourth Congressional District in 2022.\n\nFundraising\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nChristopher Cabaldon\n\nEquality California\n\nSierra Club\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nSacramento Bee\n\nMercury News\n\nJackie Elward\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nSEIU California\n\nCalifornia Environmental Voters\n\nCalifornia Legislative Black Caucus\n\nCalifornia Nurses Association\n\nRozzana Verder-Aliga\n\nCalifornia Democratic Party\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nCalifornia Teachers Association\n\nRelated News\n\nVallejo Times-Herald\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 5\n\nThe District\n\nThis district includes San Joaquin County and parts of Alameda County, including Dublin and Pleasanton, and stretches to Stockton and Tracy. The suburban communities on the outskirts of the Bay Area share transportation routes, water sources and concerns about the cost of living and affordable housing.\n\nVoter registration: 44.3% Democrat, 27.2% Republican, 21.2% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nEdith Villapudua, wife of state Assemblymember Carlos Villapudua, originally filed to run for this seat that Susan Talamantes-Eggman is vacating due to term limits. But in a last minute switch-a-roo, Carlos Villapudua opted to run for this state Senate seat instead. While Edith Villapudua’s path may have become easier, Carlos Villapudua may face a tougher one: Talamantes-Eggman has given money to former U.S. Rep. Jerry McNerney, rather than a fellow member of the Legislature.\n\nAlso running is Jim Shoemaker, a Republican and truck driver who ran in the Ninth Congressional District in 2022, but the district is safely Democratic.\n\nFundraising\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nJerry McNerney\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nCalifornia Environmental Voters\n\nMercury News\n\nJames Shoemaker\n\nCalifornia Republican Party\n\nHoward Jarvis Taxpayers Association\n\nRelated News\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 7\n\nThe District\n\nThis district encompasses large parts of the East Bay, including Alameda County and parts of Contra Costa County. The cities in the district have long shared concerns on homelessness, gentrification and affordable housing. It’s also a district that’s diverse by race, ethnicity and income.\n\nVoter registration: 68.9% Democrat, 6.0% Republican, 20.2% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nSen. Nancy Skinner is reaching her term limit next year, which means this district loses one of the more powerful members of the Legislature. Skinner has served as the Senate’s budget chairperson since 2020. The battle to replace her includes an Oakland vs. Berkeley face-off, with Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguín and Oakland City Councilmember Dan Kalb trying to stand out despite their rather similar records. Arreguín has gained an early lead in fundraising — some of it from Realtor groups, which is unsurprising given his pro-housing stance as mayor. Other Democrats in the crowded field: Jovanka Beckles, who is an AC Transit director, and Sandré Swanson, a former Assemblymember.\n\nFundraising\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nJesse Arreguín\n\nState Building and Construction Trades Council\n\nCalifornia Professional Firefighters\n\nAssemblymember Buffy Wicks\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle\n\nDan Kalb\n\nCalifornia Environmental Voters\n\nCalifornia Jewish Legislative Caucus\n\nU.S. Reps.

Tony Thurmond\n\nRelated News\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 25\n\nThe District\n\nThis district spans parts of Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties, from Glendale in the west to parts of Rancho Cucamonga and Upland in the east. The northern side of the district includes the Angeles National Forest. Some of the top issues amongst the smaller and medium-sized cities that make up one of the state’s most ethnically diverse districts are the preservation of natural resources, economic and education issues. It’s also home to the Bob Hope Airport and the cities surrounding Griffith Park.\n\nVoter registration: 46.2% Democrat, 22.4% Republican, 25.3% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nAnthony Portantino is reaching his term limit in this safely Democratic district that is turning out to have its fair share of drama. Candidates include Democratic Party and Labor favorite Sasha Renée Perez, an Alhambra city councilmember and former mayor of the city, and Monterey Park city councilmember and businesswoman Yvonne Yiu, who in 2022 unsuccessfully ran for state controller and largely self-funded her campaign.\n\nYiu is once again funding much of her own campaign, and has come under criticism for her stance on reproductive rights — though her campaign confirms she supports access to safe and legal reproductive care. She and Perez share similar priorities on affordable housing, education and gun control.\n\nFundraising\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nSasha Renée Pérez\n\nCalifornia Democratic Party\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nCalifornia Teachers Association\n\nSEIU California\n\nSierra Club\n\nCalifornia Environmental Voters\n\nYvonne Yiu\n\nCalifornia Police Chiefs Association\n\nCalifornia Asian and Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus\n\nElizabeth Wong Ahlers\n\nCalifornia Republican Party\n\nRelated News\n\nPasadena Star-News\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 37\n\nThe District\n\nThis district encompasses most of Orange County and its cultural and geographic differences — the coastal region from Huntington to Laguna Beach, the more commercial city of Orange, the master-planned city of Irvine, plus Whiting Ranch and Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness parks in the east. The make-up explains some of the top issues in the region: open space, affordable housing, an aging population and traffic.\n\nVoter registration: 37.1% Democrat, 33.0% Republican, 23.8% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nA better question might be: Who isn’t running for the state Senate seat that Dave Min of Irvine is vacating to run for Congress? Min flipped the district from red to blue in 2020, and, fortunately for the Democratic contenders, there’s more of a Democratic majority than there was when Min ran, though it’s only by 4 percentage points. State Sen. Josh Newman of Fullerton has the advantage of incumbency: Due to redistricting, he’s eligible to run for this seat. Another familiar face from the Legislature: Former Assemblymember Steven Choi, a Republican and former mayor of Irvine. The race also includes four health industry professionals (all Democrats), a realtor and the former president of the Stonewall Democrats, an LGBTQ+ political advocacy group.\n\nFundraising\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nJosh Newman\n\nCalifornia Democratic Party\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nCalifornia Teachers Association\n\nAlex Mohajer\n\nStonewall Democrats\n\nSunrise Movement\n\nFormer Democratic Party progressive caucus leader Amar Shergill\n\nSteven “Steve” Choi\n\nAssemblymember Tri Ta\n\nU.S. Rep.
