        "text": "When are the tours?\n\nPublic, guided tours of the Udall Building are offered at 2:00 PM Eastern Time on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Advance reservations are required.\n\nHow do I make a tour reservation?\n\nVisitors wishing to take a building tour must make reservations in advance by calling the Interior Museum at 202-208-4743. While Interior Museum staff members make every effort to field calls during weekday business hours, their work often takes them away from their desks. Should a call go to voicemail, callers should leave their name, callback number, tour date requested, number of people in the group, and an email address. Reservations are confirmed via email. For groups of eight or more, other weekday times may be arranged, based upon staff availability; please call to schedule.\n\nVisitors with Color Vision Deficiency (also known as color blindness) may borrow EnChroma-enhanced eyewear to aid in seeing an expanded range of colors more clearly and vibrantly during their tour. Please request this when reserving your tour, so that we can have the glasses ready for you at the outset.\n\nHow long is the tour?\n\nTours typically last 60 to 75 minutes and cover an indoor distance of approximately one mile (2,000 steps). Please note that because the tour takes place in an office corridor environment, there are not many options for sitting along the route.\n\nWhat can I expect?\n\nA member of the Interior Museum's staff will meet you and serve as your guide. Your overview of the U.S. Department of the Interior past and present will provide historical context for the \"Department of Everything Else\" and explain how the agency has evolved since its founding in 1849 to currently employ more than 70,000 professionals and steward one-fifth of the nation's lands. Throughout the tour, you will view a selection of the more than 40 painted murals by New Deal-era artists, plus several of the 1941â€“1942 photomurals by Ansel Adams.\n\nBonus: With the American bison included on the official seal of the U.S. Department of the Interior, you will see several bison in the building's artwork and architectural details.\n\nCan I view the New Deal-era murals on my own?\n\nNo. While a few of the murals are visible from where visitors enter the headquarters on the 1st floor, the majority of the murals are located throughout the building in areas not otherwise publicly accessible. The guided tour is the way to see many of these other murals.\n\nWhere can I find answers to other questions I might have about visiting?\n\nFor information about security, directions, accessibility, and more, please consult our resources on planning a visit.\n\nWhere can I learn more about the murals?\n\nFor additional imagery and historical information about the murals, see the following resources:"
