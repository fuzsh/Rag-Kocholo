A few points lower than last time reported but well above the needed percentage to pass.\n\n— Mateo Rosiles, 10:09 p.m.\n\nAbernathy alcohol and school elections\n\nAbernathy Independent School District voters considered three bond proposals — (Measure A) $2.6 million for facility renovations, land and school buses, (Measure B) $750,000 to replace the turf at the district's football stadium and (Measure C) $5.9 million for a pre-K through 12th grade activity center. Early voting numbers from Lubbock County only showed all three with majority support. Measure A had 63.64%, Measure B had 52.33% and Measure C had 54.02%. Those numbers don't include vote totals from Hale County, which weren't immediately available.\n\nIn the city of Abernathy, voters are also choosing whether the city becomes \"wet,\" deciding whether to authorize a local option allowing the sale of beer and wine for off-premise consumption. Through early voting, passage of local option proposition was leading by a more than two-thirds margin, with about 68% of early voters in favor and 32% against.\n\n— Adam Young, 9:23 p.m.\n\nWolfforth city charter popular with early voters\n\nA proposal to adopt a charter for the City of Wolfforth and make the town a home-rule municipality received nearly 90% approval during early voting. 89.4% of early voters approved the charter, while 10.6% said no.\n\nMore: Wolfforth voters to consider adopting charter as home-rule city\n\nWolfforth is currently classified as a Texas class A general law city, which do not have city charters and are generally municipalities with under 5,000 people. Texas home rule cities generally have more flexibility in governance and policy compared to general law cities, and cities can vote to become home rule cities once their populations surpass 5,000. Wolfforth's population is estimated at just over 6,000, according to the latest U.S. Census data.\n\n— Alex Driggars, 8:27 p.m.\n\nTexas Tech's TUF funding moving closer to reality\n\nWith the establishment of a $3.9 billion research fund that will help benefit Texas Tech University among other universities on the line, Lubbock County and Texas early voting numbers are looking favorable for the fund.\n\nMore: Texas University Fund goes to vote in November, here's what to know\n\n81.53% of Lubbock County voters agreed with Prop 5, with the Texas Secretary of State's website reporting that 65.85% of Texans have voted in favor of the fund.\n\n— Mateo Rosiles, 8:02 p.m.\n\nEarly voting results look favorable for ME's office bond\n\nEarly voting results released just before 8 p.m. show the majority of Lubbock County residents who cast an early ballot were in favor of nearly $35.5 million in bond funding for a new medical examiner's office in the county.\n\nAbout 59% voted in favor and about 41% against the bond package during early voting.\n\n— Alex Driggars, 7:54 p.m.\n\nWatch Lubbock County officials count ballots live\n\nUnder a relatively new state law, Texas counties with more than 100,000 residents are required to livestream ballot counting and storage to its website. The Texas Legislature passed the law in 2021 in an effort to combat voter fraud and ballot tampering.\n\nLubbock County's streams are available at this link.\n\nMore: Some Texas counties are required to livestream election ballot storage areas. Here's why.\n\n— Alex Driggars, 7:44 p.m.\n\nPolls are now closed\n\nPolls closed at 7 p.m. across the region, though anyone in line before 7 o'clock was able to cast their ballot. Results are expected to begin rolling in later this evening. Check back on this page and for updates and find additional coverage at lubbockonline.com.\n\n— Alex Driggars, 7:13 p.m.\n\nWhat was on the ballot?\n\nIn Lubbock County, voters will decide whether the county can issue $35.5 million in bonds to fund a proposed new medical examiner's office.\n\nIf approved by Lubbock County voters, the $35.5 million in bond-supported funds would be used along with $10 million in federal ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) funding previously approved for allocation by the county to pay for what would be an approximately $45 million project to re-establish an in-house medical examiner's office in the county, according to previous reporting.\n\nThe bond proposal would add about 3/4 of a cent per $100 valuation onto the Lubbock County property tax rate. That would amount to about $15 more per year on a $200,000 home, the Avalanche-Journal previously reported.\n\nVoter guide: What to know to vote on statewide proposals, ME's bond in Lubbock County\n\nMeanwhile in Wolfforth, voters considered whether to adopt a city charter to become a home-rule municipality.\n\nWolfforth is currently classified as a Texas class A general-law city, which do not have city charters and are generally municipalities with under 5,000 people. Texas home-rule cities generally have more flexibility in governance and policy compared to general-law cities, and cities can vote to become home-rule cities once their populations surpass 5,000. Wolfforth's population is estimated at just over 6,000, according to the latest U.S. Census data.\n\nA charter commission was appointed in February and has worked since March to craft the \"constitution of Wolfforth,\" which voters had the opportunity to approve on the Tuesday ballot. The charter, if adopted, will determine how the City of Wolfforth is governed and grants additional powers to its citizens.\n\nIn Abernathy, residents will decide whether the city becomes \"wet,\" deciding whether to authorize a local option allowing the sale of beer and wine for off-premise consumption.\n\nAbernathy Independent School District voters considered a pair of bond proposals — $2.6 million for facility renovations, land and school buses, and $750,000 to replace the turf at the district's football stadium.\n\nMore: 14 constitutional amendments on the Texas ballot on Election Day and what they mean\n\nIn addition to the local issues, 14 Texas constitutional amendments were on the ballot, including a proposition that would create the Texas University Fund, providing billions of dollars in research funding annually for Texas Tech and other emerging state universities.\n\n— Alex Driggars"
