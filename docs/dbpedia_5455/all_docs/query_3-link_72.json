        "text": "Image\n\nAll people have the right to live long and well. People who encounter barriers to health and have ideas to improve health have the right to raise the issue, engage with their community and expect action to be taken.\n\nThis year, we continue to focus on the connection between civic participation and health, called civic health. Evidence shows that participating in our communities, whether through volunteering or joining neighborhood groups, strengthens our social connections and sense of belonging which in turn, benefits our physical and mental health. Civic participation in political or electoral processes through voting or organizing can also influence policies that create opportunities for health, including safe spaces to live and work and funding for public health initiatives.\n\nThis report highlights the importance of civic infrastructure, spaces to connect and be informed, with a focus on access to local news, broadband internet and public libraries. We call attention to structural barriers like policies, laws and practices that can create obstacles to forms of participation such as voting and worker unionizing.\n\nCivic health reflects the opportunities people have to participate in their communities. It welcomes everyone’s voice to set priorities, make decisions and share resources. Civic health begins with our local communities and is the cornerstone of our democracy, embodying hope, opportunity, belonging and shared responsibility.\n\nWe look at two elements of civic health:\n\nCivic infrastructure provides us with spaces to meet, make our voices heard, engage in cultural activities and assure belonging. How we cultivate these spaces is also a part of infrastructure. This requires intentional policies and practices to create and cultivate environments where everyone can exchange ideas and solve problems together.\n\nCivic participation includes the ways people engage in community life to improve conditions, whether through voting, advocacy, volunteering, mentoring or participating in unions so that their work can meet their basic needs. Supporting ways to participate is foundational to building healthy, thriving and equitable communities.\n\nImage\n\nCivic infrastructure supports connection within communities and makes civic participation possible. Civic infrastructure encompasses places such as libraries, parks and schools and access to information needed for individual and group decision-making.\n\nDespite the strong links between civic participation and our health, disinvestment in or deliberate exclusion from our civic infrastructure means that not everyone can participate. Structural barriers such as policies, laws and practices can create obstacles to forms of participation such as voting and worker unionizing. Structural barriers, such as limited infrastructure to support public deliberations, can also be obstacles to authentic community input into decisions.\n\nInvesting in an accessible and high-quality information environment can foster inclusive and informed participation in our communities, a critical component of a healthy democracy. Creating spaces where everyone has a voice supports conditions where everyone can thrive. On the other hand, exclusionary practices, such as laws and practices that limit voting and organized labor, can be detrimental to health.1\n\nImage\n\nHealthy communities depend on a culture where all people have the power to make change and a say in the decisions that affect them.\n\nBut not all U.S. communities have the same opportunities for civic health. Many groups, including women, immigrants, LGBTQIA+ people and racialized groups such as Native people, Black and Hispanic populations experience the impacts of a history of disinvestment in civic infrastructure. They have also faced exclusionary policies and practices that limit opportunities to participate through a variety of means including restrictive voting laws. Redlining, disinvestment in rural economies and legal actions to terminate tribal culture and land rights are examples of long-standing discrimination that have created structural barriers to social and economic opportunity, civic participation and the potential to live long and well in these communities today (see map at right).\n\nDespite this enduring history, change is possible. Structural barriers can be dismantled through voting, ballot initiatives, volunteering and union and community organizing. Civic participation that builds power to break down structural barriers can benefit the health and well-being of everyone.\n\nWe can advance health and equity when all people have a say in their futures. To provide these opportunities, we must undo policies, practices and worldviews that exclude people from participating in decisions about how to create heathy communities.\n\nDemocracy requires an informed public. The information environment is the space where people obtain information to make sense of the world. This includes digital and non-digital resources that shape information flow and the conditions for people to access, process and absorb information. The information environment involves things like access to broadband internet, local news and public libraries. The information environment requires structural protections, such as preservation of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech, a free and independent press, and protections against disinformation.\n\nThe quality and accessibility of the information environment matters because it is tied to our health and is crucial infrastructure for civic participation. Some people do not have access to the information, resources and services that support health, nor the ability to raise issues in their communities because they lack sufficient access to various types of information. The information environment is in transition, which presents opportunities and risks.\n\nNews media outlets provide a first draft of history and serve as a watchdog that holds those in power, including public officials, accountable. People with access to local news vote more and, in some communities, local news may be the only source for information about public decisions like budgets, planning and other deliberations. However, local newspapers are disappearing and large news outlets are laying off reporting staff. Nine out of 10 adults in the U.S. get at least some of their news online3 and many sites recycle their news from traditional news media — mostly from larger urban newspapers.\n\nBroadband internet access is uneven across the country. Pockets of rural, lower-income, marginalized and racialized communities have the least reliable access. This is due in part to disinvestment in rural economies and digital redlining, as described below. Broadband internet access enables people to seek job opportunities, education, online medical care and can also decrease loneliness and social isolation. Broadband internet access can support civic participation, as seen by the rise in virtual town halls where people can have their voices heard and learn about issues.\n\nPublic libraries are unevenly funded, particularly in rural and lower-income urban areas. In recent years, some public libraries have also faced defunding and attempts to censor library materials.4 Public libraries promote health by lending reading materials, providing access to broadband internet, offering classes and programming, connecting people to health and social services and serving as community hubs during disasters. Libraries are often sites for community meetings and voting.\n\nTransitions within our information environment did not occur solely due to consumer preferences. These changes are structural in nature and often — though not always — serve to maintain current economic and political power through their implementation.\n\nAll these changes matter. The information environment is key to transmitting evidence-informed knowledge of issues relevant to health to the public via trusted messengers. It is also important in our understanding of the needs and opportunities in our communities. The information environment influences our actions, whether communications are about the importance of vaccinations or confidence in who we elect to make decisions on our behalf.\n\nImage\n\nWe all lose when we disinvest in civic spaces and information environments that serve everyone.\n\nSome libraries in the U.S. experienced attempts to reduce staff and funding because they made certain materials available, thereby removing a vital public resource for all.5 In 2023, the American Library Association reported 695 attempts to censor library materials and challenges to almost 1,915 unique titles, which was a 20% increase from the same reporting period in 2022. Most of the challenges were to books written by or about a person of color or a member of the LGBTQIA+ community.6 Book banning as a form of censorship in the information environment has deep historical roots. In 18th and 19th century America, religious groups pushed to ban books they considered immoral. Many Southern states banned anti-slavery books.\n\nGlossary of terms\n\nCivic health: The degree to which citizens participate in their communities, from local and state governance to interactions with friends or family. Civic health relates to the overall well-being of neighborhoods, communities, states and the nation (National Conference on Citizenship 2023).\n\nCivic infrastructure: Places, policies, programs and practices that undergird strong communities and foster civic participation (Patrick and Brady 2015).\n\nCivic participation: The ways people participate in the life of a community in order to improve conditions and/or shape the community’s future (Adler and Goggin 2016).\n\nCommunity power: The ability of communities most impacted by structural inequity to develop, sustain and grow an organized group of people who act together through democratic structures to set agendas, shift public discourse, influence who makes decisions and cultivate ongoing relationships of mutual accountability with decision-makers that change systems and advance health equity (Lead Local 2023).\n\nDemocracy: A form of government where citizens elect leaders to govern on their behalf.\n\nDigital redlining: The modern equivalent of this historical form of redlining creates and maintains technological policies, practices and investment decisions that enforce class boundaries and discriminate against specific populations. For example, this entails under-resourced broadband infrastructure in low-income and rural areas and neighborhoods, often with high proportion of people of color (Gilliard and Culik 2016).\n\nHealth equity: Assurance of the conditions for optimal health for all people. Achieving health equity requires valuing all individuals and populations equally, recognizing and rectifying historical injustice and providing resources according to need (Jones 2014).\n\nInformation environment: The space where people process information to make sense of the world. This includes the digital and non-digital resources that shape information flow and the conditions for people to access, process and absorb informatio(Center for Democracy & Technology n.d.).\n\nRedlining: The Federal Housing Administration’s policies from the 1930s that entrenched racial residential segregation. Redlining denied Black people and some other ethnic groups access to government-insured mortgages and labeled homes in neighborhoods where Black people and some other ethnic groups lived as uninsurable, thereby guaranteeing that property values in those neighborhoods would be less than those in non-immigrant white neighborhoods (Mapping Inequality n.d.).\n\nRight-to-Work policies: These policies prohibit unions from collecting dues from non-unionized workers in otherwise unionized workplaces, which weakens the scope of collective action and deprives unions of funds to exert political influence to support workers (Frymer, Grumbach and Hill 2023).\n\nSocial solidarity: Emphasizes the interdependence between individuals in a society, which allows individuals to feel that they can enhance the lives of others. It is a core principle of collective action and is founded on shared values and beliefs among different groups in society (Douwes et al. 2018).\n\nStructural barriers: Obstacles that collectively affect a group disproportionately and perpetuate or maintain stark disparities in outcomes (American Hospital Association Institute for Diversity and Health Equity n.d.).\n\nStructural racism: Refers to the totality of ways in which societies foster racial discrimination through mutually reinforcing systems of housing, education, employment, earnings, benefits, credit, media, health care and criminal justice. These patterns and practices in turn reinforce discriminatory beliefs, values and distribution of resources (Bailey et al. 2017).\n\nFind more information and relevant readings on civic health.\n\nTechnical notes\n\nDefinitions for regions and county categories:\n\nThe Appalachian Region is defined as the 423 counties across 13 states from southern New York to northern Mississippi that span the Appalachian Mountain range and are served by the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n\nThe Black Belt Region is defined as the 285 counties in the southern region of the U.S. that have populations where greater than or equal to 30% of their residents identify as non-Hispanic Black or African American alone, according to the 2020 decennial census.\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico Border Region is defined as the aggregate of 44 counties within 100 kilometers (or 62.5 miles) of the international boundary, stretching 2,000 miles from the southern tip of Texas to California.\n\nAI/AN tribal areas and their surrounding counties is defined as counties where any part of the county includes an American Indian or Alaska Native tribal area as delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nData sources and measures\n\nStructural Barriers: Data sources for structural barriers include the 2020 Cost of Voting Index (COVI) and the State Democracy Index. The 2020 COVI, which measures the relative difficulty of voting in each state, was created from nine issue areas, including: registration deadlines, registration restrictions, registration drive restrictions, pre-registration laws for 16 and 17 year olds, automatic voter registration, voting inconvenience, voter ID laws, poll hours and early voting. The State Democracy Index, which measures the quality of democratic institutions in states, uses 51 democracy indicators, such as measures of gerrymandering, electoral policies that affect the eligibility to or cost of voting, electoral policies that increase the integrity of elections and observed democratic outcomes. We stratified the COVI into tertiles for analyses capturing more or fewer structural barriers.\n\nLibraries: Data on library use come from the Public Libraries Survey for 2021 conducted by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Note: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic likely affected library operating hours and use in 2021.\n\nNews Outlets: Data on the availability of local news outlets come from the Medill Local News Initiative at Northwestern University’s “The State of Local News” 2023 report.\n\nVolunteering: Data on volunteering at the state level come from the 2021 Current Population Survey Civic Engagement and Volunteering Supplement conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and AmeriCorps.\n\nUnion Membership: Data on union membership at the state level come from the 2023 Current Population Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nWe define the healthiest and least healthy counties as those that scored among the 10th (least healthy) and 90th (healthiest) percentile counties, nationwide, for the 2024 Health Outcomes z-score."
