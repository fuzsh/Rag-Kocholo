        "text": "Thank you for joining us for the UK general election results. Our coverage has moved here.\n\nThe UK has a new political reality. Here's what you need to know\n\nBritain’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer has started to name his cabinet, including appointing Rachel Reeves as the country’s first ever female Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister.\n\nEarlier, the Labour leader made his first speech as prime minister, promising to steer the UK toward “calmer waters” during his time in office.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nLabour Party wins big: The center-left Labour won the election by a landslide, securing the biggest majority in its history. Party leader Starmer celebrated the victory in front of supporters at the Tate Modern art gallery in London. “Change begins now. It feels good, I have to be honest,” he said.\n\nHandover of power complete: Sunak formally tendered his resignation to King Charles, before Starmer had his audience with the monarch, who asked him to form a government. Starmer then traveled to Downing Street to address the nation before he and his wife, Victoria, entered Number 10 for the first time.\n\nStarmer promises change: In his first speech as prime minister, Starmer pledged to steer the UK toward “calmer waters” after 14 often turbulent years of Conservative rule. “You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change, to restore service and respect to politics, end the era of noisy performance, tread more lightly on your lives, and unite our country,” Starmer said.\n\nCabinet appointments: Starmer has announced a number of cabinet appointments, with Angela Rayner named deputy prime minister as well as Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, while Rachel Reeves is the first ever female finance minister in British history.\n\nSunak to step down: The outgoing prime minister said that he will leave his post as leader of the Conservative party in an address to the British public outside Downing Street. “I have heard your anger, your disappointment, and I take responsibility for this loss,” Sunak said after delivering the party’s worst-ever defeat.\n\nProminent Conservatives lose their seats: The Tories have had a tough night, suffering the biggest defeat since the party was formed. Among the top brass Conservatives losing their seats: the former (albeit short-lived) Prime Minister Liz Truss, House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt, Defense Secretary Grant Shapps and Justice Secretary Alex Chalk.\n\nReform UK makes breakthrough: An insurgent rightwing populist party led by the Nigel Farage secured four seats, with Farage himself getting into the parliament for the first time – after running seven times in the past.\n\nLiberal Democrats reborn: The Liberal Democrats were on course to secure their best result ever – and will return as Britain’s third-biggest party in Westminster. They unseated several high-profile Conservatives.\n\nGreens quadruple their seats: The Green Party won four spots in the Parliament, gaining three more seats compared to the last election in 2019.\n\nSNP wipeout: The Scottish National Party has suffered big losses in Scotland, likely putting the question of an independent Scotland to rest for now. Labour took a host of seats from the party.\n\nLow turnout: Turnout is on track to be the lowest for more than 20 years. Of the seats declared by early Friday morning, turnout is hovering just below 60% – down from 67.3% at the last election in 2019.\n\nWho is Rachel Reeves, the first woman to take the helm of Britain’s economy?\n\nRachel Reeves has been appointed by Keir Starmer as the UK’s new Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister, becoming the first woman to hold the role.\n\nThe daughter of teachers, Reeves studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University before taking a graduate job at the Bank of England, initially tasked with analyzing how Japan attempted to emerge from its period of stagnation in the 1990s.\n\nBritain’s economy today faces a similar challenge. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Britain’s economic growth has mostly flatlined. The last time the average Briton went so long without a real-terms pay rise, Queen Victoria had not been born.\n\nLabour made kickstarting economic growth a key mission. In a recent lecture, Reeves diagnosed the root of Britain’s economic ills.\n\nReeves said the years of political instability that followed was a product of the economic harm wrought by austerity. She called the failure to invest when the government could borrow cheaply “an act of historic negligence.”\n\nAlthough Labour has been criticized for not making bolder tax-and-spend commitments – leading some to argue there is little difference between their plans for the economy and the Tories’ – Starmer’s government will face far more constraints than the Conservative government in 2010. After the surge in borrowing costs, Britain is much more fiscally constrained now than it was then.\n\nStill, within these limits, Reeves has made a series of quietly radical promises. She calls her agenda “securonomics” – a homage to “Bidenomics” – an attempt to build secure supply chains to avoid future inflationary shocks.\n\nTo this end, Labour has also pledged to create two new economic institutions: a National Wealth Fund, aiming to rebuild Britain’s industrial strength and encourage private investment, and Great British Energy, a mission to create a publicly-owned clean energy company by 2030.\n\nWhat is clear is that Labour is not promising overnight fixes to Britain’s malaise. Starmer and Reeves say they hope to embark on “a decade of national renewal.”\n\nStarmer names more senior cabinet positions\n\nNew British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has appointed three more senior ministers to his cabinet.\n\nDavid Lammy has been appointed foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper is the home secretary and John Healey is the defense secretary.\n\nStarmer appoints first female finance minister in UK history\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer has appointed Rachel Reeves as UK chancellor, making her the first woman to take charge of the Treasury.\n\nReeves said it was the “honor of her life” to be appointed as UK finance minister.\n\nReeves, a former Bank of England economist, said it was a “historic responsibility” to be appointed to the position and addressed other women and girls, saying there should be “no limits on your ambitions.”\n\nThere will also be a record number of female lawmakers in the new House of Commons when it returns, continuing a trend towards increasing female representation in parliament over the last few elections.\n\nMore than 260 female lawmakers have been elected to parliament. The previous record set was 220 in 2019.\n\nStarmer starts to name his cabinet, with Angela Rayner appointed deputy prime minister\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer has appointed Angela Rayner as deputy prime minister, his office announced in a post on X Friday.\n\nRayner will also serve as Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.\n\nSeveral senior Labour MPs have been seen entering Downing Street, where Starmer will name his cabinet.\n\nReform UK’s Nigel Farage heckled and called racist at chaotic press conference\n\nNigel Farage from the right-wing start-up Reform UK party was subjected to a barrage of heckling from protesters at a press conference that he called to celebrate his party’s election success.\n\nFarage, known for his leadership in the UK’s Brexit campaign and his close ties with former President Donald Trump, won his first seat in parliament in Thursday’s vote, along with at least three others from the Reform party.\n\nAs he tried to address journalists and supporters, several hecklers shouted abuse, including one that said he was racist.\n\nFarage and his party have vowed to freeze illegal migration and “stop the boats,” in reference to migrants who arrive in the country by sea, usually across the English Channel.\n\nFarage shouted, “Boring, boring, boring,” to drown out hecklers’ remarks as his supporters cheered and security officials ejected the protesters from the room.\n\nHe took a jibe at newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying that, although Labour won by a landslide in terms of seats in parliament, the popular vote showed the party’s win was not a resounding victory.\n\nDespite the Labour landslide, Starmer’s party only increased its vote share by a few percentage points from its dismal 2019 showing.\n\nStarmer and his wife enter 10 Downing Street for the first time\n\nAfter making his first address as Prime Minister, Keir Starmer and his wife, Victoria, entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, greeted by staff and civil servants on Friday.\n\nWhat will Keir Starmer’s leadership mean for the world?\n\nEver since the UK voted to leave the European Union in 2016, there has been a perennial debate about Britain’s place in the world.\n\nThere are some who believed that Brexit would lead to the UK having a diminished voice on the world stage, despite still being a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a G7 economy and a nuclear power.\n\nIt’s hard to quantify exactly how much power any country has, but arguably the biggest hinderance to the UK’s international influence has been the domestic political chaos and instability since 2016.\n\nThe logic goes that if you cannot provide certainty at home, what you say on international issues doesn’t carry much weight.\n\nDiplomats often point to the relative stability of a country like Ireland, whose political consistency, particularly on foreign affairs, affords its diplomats disproportionate heft, compared to say Australia, who went through a period of political instability which saw it lose influence.\n\nIt’s not an exact science, but political stability matters to your allies. Starmer can now as good as guarantee five years of consistency to the world, which will mean his views on foreign affairs can be taken seriously.\n\nOn Ukraine, Starmer is expected to maintain the UK government’s support.\n\nHe has said Israel has a right to defend itself, but it is expected that he will come under pressure to restrict arms sales if they are being used to commit war crimes.\n\nHe has said that he wants to improve the UK’s relationship with Europe, but has ruled out rejoining the EU or any of its institutions.\n\nHow the return of Farage created a nightmare for the Tories\n\nAfter Britain left the European Union in 2020 – a cause he had championed for three decades – Nigel Farage retreated from frontline politics. When his fledgling Brexit party renamed itself as Reform UK, he slunk into the role of party chairman – still a political force, but a dormant one.\n\nJust weeks ago, it looked set to stay that way. Farage initially said he would not stand in this election, and that he would instead “help with the grassroots campaign” in the US, presumably to try to reelect former President Donald Trump.\n\nThis came as a relief to the Conservatives, who had long feared losing their more right-wing voters to Reform. But, lacking a recognizable leader, Reform looked set to be a disparate protest vote, failing to pose a real electoral challenge to the Tories.\n\nThen, everything changed. Farage said at the start of June that he was set to make an “emergency announcement,” striking fear into Conservative HQ.\n\nHe went on to win the seat comfortably, finally being elected Parliament after seven unsuccessful attempts.\n\nFarage’s return injected energy into the Reform campaign and skewed the electoral arithmetic. While Reform won just four seats, it secured millions of votes, potentially costing the Conservative dozens of constituencies by splitting the vote on the right.\n\nIn the past, the Conservative Party has seen off the Faragist threat by adopting his policies. The much-diminished party now faces a similar choice: Does it try to bury Reform, or bed it?\n\nFinal results not expected until Saturday after recount in Scottish seat\n\nThe final result of the UK’s general election will likely be delayed until Saturday after a recount was called in a constituency in the Scottish Highlands.\n\nThe outcome in Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire was expected early Friday morning, before it was announced that a second recount was required and would be held Saturday.\n\nThe seat was held by the Scottish National Party in the outgoing parliament on a majority of more than 12,000.\n\nWe are also still waiting on the result from South Basildon and East Thurrock – which is expected to be held by the Conservatives – meaning just two seats out of 650 are outstanding.\n\nHere’s a reminder of the results so far:\n\nLabour: 412\n\nConservatives: 121\n\nLiberal Democrats: 71\n\nScottish National Party: 9\n\nSinn Féin: 7\n\nIndependent: 6\n\nGreen Party: 4\n\nReform: 4\n\nPlaid Cymru: 4\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party: 4\n\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party: 2\n\nAlliance Party of Northern Ireland: 1\n\nUlster Unionist Party: 1\n\nTraditional Unionist Voice: 1\n\nMeet Victoria Starmer, wife of new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\n\nThe British public has elected a new government, and with that a new family will be moving into 10 Downing Street.\n\nUnlike some other countries, such as the United States, when a new British prime minister comes to power, the transition into both the new role and home happens almost immediately.\n\nThat means, not only will Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, be settling into his home down the road from the Houses of Parliament, but so will his wife, Victoria, and their two teenage children.\n\nStarmer’s wife, whom he usually refers to as Vic, kept a relatively low profile during the election campaign, but she was at his side on Friday as he arrived at Downing Street for the first time as prime minister.\n\nSo, who is Victoria Starmer, and what do we know about the new occupants of 10 Downing Street?\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAt the scene: Keir Starmer's first speech as PM\n\nLittle more than an hour separated Keir Starmer’s speech from Rishi Sunak’s, but the mood outside Downing Street could not have been more dramatically different.\n\nA crowd of Labour staffers and their family members gathered a few steps from the Number 10 door while Starmer was at Buckingham Palace, some holding Union Jack umbrellas, others waving flags.\n\nAt one point a member of staff handed out Scottish and Welsh flags, after an election that saw Labour overturn a deficit to the Scottish National Party north of the border. The “One Nation” optics drew a clear parallel to Tony Blair’s Labour victory.\n\nEven Larry the cat, Downing Street’s beloved demouser-in-chief, broke out of his midday nap on the pavement and limbered up for his new housemate, doing a few laps of the street before slipping back inside.\n\nThe helicopter circling overhead and the increasingly enthused cheers from the amassed crowd signalled Starmer’s arrival, and the ever-serious politician appeared relaxed, the burden of campaigning lifted, as he took his time greeting them on arrival.\n\nHis speech was statesmanlike if not exactly soaring, the energy dipping slightly as he reached for well-worn phrases already used in countless campaign speeches.\n\nThere was no new, surprising side to Starmer that emerged - perhaps none ever will. But Starmer ended on a powerful note, promising his government’s “urgent work” will “begin today.”\n\nIt’s not an exaggeration: Starmer has decisions to make about his Cabinet, and while his majority is almost historic, he must face a public eager to see results after a fragile coalition of voters saw him into Downing Street.\n\nBut those are conversations for another day. Friday belongs to Keir Starmer, Britain’s new, uniquely powerful prime minister.\n\nStarmer pledges to steer UK toward \"calmer waters\"\n\nWrapping his speech, Starmer pledged to steer the UK toward “calmer waters” after 14 often turbulent years of Conservative rule.\n\n“If I asked you now whether you believe that Britain will be better for your children, I know too many of you would say no,” he said, pledging to fight “until you believe again.”\n\nStarmer said his government would try to “defy, quietly, those who have written our country off.\n\nHe said the four nations of the United Kingdom would stand together as they confront “the challenges of an insecure world, committed to a calm and patient rebuilding.”\n\nStarmer pledges to heal the \"weariness in the heart\" of Britain\n\nKeir Starmer said the country voted “decisively for change, and a return of politics to public service.”\n\n“When the gap between the sacrifices made by people and the service they receive from politicians grows this big, it leads to a weariness in the heart of a nation, a draining away of the hope, the spirit, the belief in a better future, that we need to move forward together,” Starmer said.\n\nThis wound, Starmer said, “can only be healed by action, not words.”\n\nHe said he intends to start work right away “with the simple acknowledgement that public service is a privilege and that this government should treat every single person in this country with respect.”\n\nStarmer praises predecessor Sunak in first speech\n\nNew UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has praised his predecessor Rishi Sunak in his first speech as prime minister.\n\nAfter confirming he’d accepted an invitation to form a government following a landslide win, Labour leader Starmer recognized the “extra effort” Sunak made in becoming the country’s first Asian prime minister.\n\n“And we also recognize the dedication and hard work he brought to his leadership,” added Starmer.\n\nStarmer to make first address to nation as prime minister\n\nThe UK’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to address the nation from outside Downing Street shortly.\n\nStarmer has just had an audience with King Charles at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch invited him to form the next government.\n\nHe’s now left the palace and is on his way to his new home.\n\nStarmer arrives at Buckingham Palace for audience with the King\n\nKeir Starmer has arrived at Buckingham Palace with his wife, Victoria, where they were welcomed into the King’s door for an audience with Charles III.\n\nAfter the process known as “the kissing of hands,” Starmer will be invited to form a government in His Majesty’s name.\n\nWhen he leaves the palace, Starmer will have become the 58th prime minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nRishi Sunak formally tenders resignation to King Charles\n\nRishi Sunak is no longer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, having formally tendered his resignation to the King during an audience at Buckingham Palace.\n\nSunak was pictured along with his wife, Akshata Murty, leaving Buckingham Palace.\n\nIncoming Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet the King next and officially take power.\n\nStarmer set for morning meeting with the King\n\nKeir Starmer will soon become the third prime minister of King Charles III’s reign. When Charles acceded the throne in 2022, Liz Truss had been in office for 48 hours. Just 49 days later, Sunak replaced her. So, how does this next part play out?\n\nAs head of state, appointing new prime ministers is one of Charles’s core constitutional duties, along with the State Opening of Parliament and signing parliamentary bills into law.\n\nSunak will head to Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation and for a final farewell audience with the monarch. Little is known about what happens at this meeting.\n\nGordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister in office between 2007 and 2010, said in his memoir that his last PM meeting with the late Elizabeth II didn’t involve handing over seals of office, but “simply saying goodbye to the Queen – and thanking her.”\n\nIn his autobiography, “My Life, Our Times,” he said “as usual, she was charming and the occasion itself was relaxed.” Brown recalled how the Queen permitted his two young sons to be present when he received a parting gift – an inscribed photograph of the monarch.\n\nShortly after, Starmer will travel over to the royal residence for a process known as “the kissing of hands.” The old ceremony reflects loyalty to the sovereign, but the kissing is not expected these days. Starmer will then be invited to form a government in His Majesty’s name.\n\nThe transition is a relatively quick process, taking about half an hour. Once back, we’ll get Starmer’s first address to the nation from outside Downing Street.\n\nAt the scene: Sunak's final speech as British prime minister\n\nRishi Sunak fired the starting gun on his six-week downfall in the rain. His premiership ended on Friday morning, in a drizzle.\n\nThere were plenty of umbrellas unfurled among the media masses opposite Downing Street’s famous black door — an instrument infamously ignored by the outgoing prime minister when he called the election at the end of May.\n\nBut at least the worst of the rain had cleared, averting the prospect of Sunak’s speech being hurriedly moved inside.\n\nIn the windows above Downing Street, as Sunak said his final goodbyes inside, the lights were on and the silhouettes of staff members flashed by, occasionally fiddling with the blinds.\n\nFor Sunak and for most of his political appointees, this will be their final moments inside the famous building. The handover in power in British politics is infamously sudden.\n\nThen he emerged, with his wife a few paces behind as he took to the podium. It was a cleaner speech than six weeks ago. He sounded humbled and apologetic.\n\nBut a protestor could clearly be heard shouting “Tories Out!” as Sunak delivered his final words, Sunak tapping his left foot hurriedly as he did so.\n\nWith a touch of poetic humor, the clouds did at last part over Sunak’s head as he neared the end of his speech. After a miserable, gray morning, the sky noticeably brightened over Downing Street seconds after Sunak’s departure.\n\n“I have heard your anger,” Sunak says in contrite farewell speech\n\nMore now on Rishi Sunak’s farewell speech from Downing Street.\n\nThe outgoing PM said he had heard the “anger” of British voters, who delivered his Conservative Party its worst-ever defeat, and apologized to the candidates who had lost their seats.\n\nSunak announced he will step down as party leader in the near future. Reflecting on his 21-month premiership, Sunak said he had “returned stability to our economy” and rebuilt Britain’s relations with its allies.\n\nHe singled out a major deal he struck to normalize relations between the UK and European Union in the wake of Brexit - a policy he championed - as another of his achievements.\n\nSunak wished Labour leader Keir Starmer success when he becomes prime minister later Friday.\n\nFinally, Sunak – the first British Asian prime minister – reflected on his background.\n\nPerhaps in a nod toward the surge in support for the hard-right Reform UK party, Sunak said: “We must hold true to that idea of who we are – that vision of kindness, decency and tolerance that has always been the British way.”\n\nBREAKING: Sunak pledges to step down as Conservative leader after landslide election loss\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has said that he will step down as leader of the Conservative party after losing the election in a landslide.\n\n“Following this result, I will step down as party leader,” he said, a move that will trigger a contest to become next Conservative leader.\n\n“To the country, I would like to say first and foremost: I am sorry,” he said in an address to the British public outside Downing Street to mark the end of his time in office.\n\n“I have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change, and yours is the only judgment that matters,” added Sunak.\n\nHis party was routed by the opposition Labour party and squeezed by the Nigel Farage-led Reform Party and the resurgent centrist Liberal Democrats.\n\nSeveral Conservative cabinet ministers lost their seats and the party must now decide how to respond to the challenges of opposition.\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to address public from Downing Street\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak is to make a statement as he prepares to make way for election winner Keir Starmer to form a government.\n\nA podium has been set up outside Downing Street, with Sunak expected to address the public shortly.\n\nNationalist Sinn Féin party becomes largest Northern Irish party in Westminster parliament\n\nSinn Féin has become largest Northern Irish party in the Westminster parliament after a historic showing in the UK general election.\n\nNorthern Irish politicians can choose to either run for a seat in the Westminster parliament or for a seat in the devolved legislature, the Northern Ireland Assembly, referred to as Stormont.\n\nThe Assembly passes laws regarding policy areas such as health, education and policing whilst the Westminster parliament presides over issues which have not been devolved including foreign policy and defense.\n\nThe nationalist Sinn Féin party, which advocates for reuniting Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in the south, succeeded in winning seven out of the 18 available seats in the Westminster parliament.\n\nAfter a sweeping victory in Assembly elections held in 2022, Sinn Féin now has the largest number of seats for a Northern Ireland party in both Westminster and Stormont.\n\nSinn Féin MPs do not take up their seats in the Westminster parliament as part of the party’s refusal to recognize British sovereignty over Northern Ireland.\n\nThe party’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill hailed their success in a social media post on Friday, thanking voters for “endorsing Sinn Féin candidates who will work hard for you every day and lead positive change for everyone.”\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the leading Unionist party which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, won five seats in total, losing some long-held seats in stronghold areas.\n\nPro-Palestinian independent candidates upset Labour in three constituencies\n\nWhile it undoubtedly has been a good night for Labour, its stance on the war in Gaza has cost the party votes.\n\nPro-Palestinian independent candidates have managed to upset Labour in three constituencies the party won in 2019: Blackburn, Leicester South and Islington North.\n\nAdnan Hussain, who promised to make sure that opposition to “the injustice being inflicted against the people of Gaza be heard,” won in Blackburn, a constituency which had previously voted Labour in every election since it was created in 1955.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour’s Shadow Paymaster General Jonathan Ashworth, who had been Leicester South’s MP since 2011, was unseated by the independent candidate Shockat Adam, who won 35.2% compared to Ashworth’s 32.9%.\n\n“As a genocide is being committed in Gaza, according to all human rights observers, many have expressed feeling betrayed and ignored on this matter,” Adam said in his campaign to win the Leicester South constituency.\n\nFormer left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was expelled from the party in a spat over antisemitism, won the Islington North constituency as an independent. His win gives him the opportunity to challenge the current Labour leader (and next PM) Keir Starmer in parliament, who has sought to remold Labour from the Corbyn era.\n\nHowever, Labour has gained the Rochdale constituency from the pro-Palestine politician George Galloway.\n\nGalloway dramatically won the constituency in a by-election earlier this year, in which he accused the “political class” of having “failed Rochdale, failed Britain and failed Gaza.”\n\nIn Scotland, SNP loses scores of seats, including several in capital city\n\nThe Scottish National Party has lost scores of seats across the country, including a number in Scotland’s capital city Edinburgh.\n\nThe party has lost at least 38 seats in total, including Edinburgh North and Leith, Edinburgh East and Musselburgh, and Edinburgh South West — all of which were picked up by the Labour Party.\n\nMost of the seats the SNP lost have been Labour gains, but two, Mid Dunbartonshire and North East Fife, were lost to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nLabour has won a total of 37 seats so far across Scotland. The Conservative Party meanwhile, has only won in one constituency in Scotland so far — Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk.\n\nThe left-leaning SNP has led Scotland’s devolved government since 2007, and it forced an independence vote in 2014 in which Scottish voters opted to remain part of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe SNP descended into disorder last year amid a widely publicized police investigation into the party’s financial irregularities, which eroded its public support.\n\n\"Change begins now,\" Keir Starmer tells victory rally in London\n\nThe soon-to-be new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has addressed cheering supporters at a Labour Party victory rally in central London, and pledged “national renewal” following 14 years of Conservative rule.\n\n“You campaigned for it, you fought for it, you voted for it and now it has arrived. Change begins now,” Starmer told Labour staff. “It feels good, I have to be honest … This is what it is for. A changed Labour party, ready to serve our country.”\n\nHowever, Starmer cautioned that having “a mandate like this comes with a great responsibility.”\n\nSpeaking a few moments after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak conceded defeat in the general election, Starmer said, “Our task is nothing less than renewing the ideas that hold this country together. National renewal. If you work hard, if you play by the rules, this country should give you a fair chance to get on… We have to restore that.”\n\nHe continued: “We have to return politics to public service, show that politics can be a force for good. Make no mistake, that is the great test for politics in this era. The fight for trust is the battle that defines our age.”\n\nHouse of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt loses seat in most high-profile defeat so far\n\nPenny Mordaunt, the House of Commons leader and a potential frontrunner in the impending race for the leadership of the Conservative Party, has lost her seat – the most high-profile loss of the night so far.\n\nMordaunt, who has been an MP since 2010, was dislodged by Labour challenger Amanda Martin in Portsmouth North. Martin received 14,495 votes to Mordaunt’s 13,715 votes.\n\nMordaunt beat Martin in 2019 with a majority of more than 15,000 votes.\n\nHer defeat will be a blow to moderate Conservatives who are hoping to wrest control of the party away from its populist wing; Mourdaunt ran against Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak in the race to replace Boris Johnson as leader in 2022, and would have been expected to run again in another contest.\n\nShe also won attention around the world as the “lady in blue” at King Charles’ coronation.\n\nRight-wing populist Nigel Farage becomes MP for the first time after winning in Clacton\n\nNigel Farage, the right-wing populist leader of the Reform UK party, has become an MP at the eighth attempt, winning a seat in the heavily pro-Brexit town of Clacton.\n\nFarage’s Reform UK party has attacked the Conservatives on their failure to bring down rates of legal and illegal migration, and their message won over a considerable number of socially conservative former Tory voters.\n\nThe veteran Euroskeptic played a leading role in bringing about Britain’s departure from the European Union, and has remained a divisive and disruptive figure in the country’s politics since.\n\nBut he has never been elected to parliament, losing seven elections since 1994 before this victory. He won Clacton on a massive swing towards Reform, picking up 21,225 votes to the Conservatives’ 12,820.\n\n“It’s not just disappointment with the Conservative Party. There is a massive gap on the centre right of British politics and my job is to fill it. And that’s exactly what I’m going to do,” Farage said after winning the seat.\n\nHe pledged to “challenge the general election properly in 2029,” and promised to turn his rhetoric towards Labour as they seem set to enter government.\n\nHis presence during the election campaign upended the Tories’ efforts to win back socially conservative, pro-Brexit voters. Now, he’ll likely be a prominent outside voice as the Conservatives decide on their next direction as the new opposition party.\n\nCNN visited Clacton in the run-up to the election, to take the temperature of voters and assess how Farage’s anti-immigration message was received.\n\nTwo Cabinet ministers lose seconds apart\n\nTwo Conservative Cabinet ministers have lost their seats just seconds apart, as the scale of the Tories’ misery increases on a devastating election night.\n\nDefence Secretary Grant Shapps lost his seat to Labour in Welwyn Hatfield, the most high-profile defeat of the night so far.\n\nShapps has held a number of Cabinet positions under different prime ministers, including energy security and net zero secretary, business, energy and industrial strategy secretary and home secretary. He was elected to parliament in 2005.\n\nHe lost his seat to Labour’s Andrew Lewin, who won by 3,799 votes. It’s quite the fall from grace after he secured his seat back in 2019 with a majority of almost 11,000 votes.\n\nHe had been one of a number of prominent Tory candidates expected to lose their seat after the exit poll released.\n\nAlmost at the same time, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk lost his seat to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe twin defeats painted the perfect picture of a miserable night for the Conservatives, who have been carved up by Labour and the Lib Dems across the country.\n\nAnd it could get worse – more Cabinet ministers are at risk, including the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt – in what could be an unprecedented evening.\n\nWhat the UK front pages are looking like\n\nWe’re starting to get a glimpse of the Friday morning front pages which are obviously being dominated by the results of the exit poll, which foreshadows a Labour landslide and an undeniably poor showing from the Conservatives.\n\nThe Sun has opted to emphasize Labour’s win with the electoral map and a front page emblazoned with “Britain sees red.”\n\nTabloid paper the Daily Mirror has a full page shot of the Labour leader and his wife as they cast their vote on Thursday, with the headline: “KEIR WE GO.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Daily Express has gone with “CRUSHING BLOW TO TORY PARTY IN ELECTION WIPEOUT” with a photo of Conservative Party leader Rishi Sunak and his wife.\n\nKeir Starmer says \"it is time for us to deliver\" after winning seat\n\nKer Starmer, who seems likely to be Britain’s next prime minister, said the country is “ready for change” after winning his seat in north London.\n\n“Tonight, people here and around the country have spoken. They are ready for change,” Starmer said at the count.\n\nStarmer was beaming as he arrived at the count, posing for selfies and taking his time to work his way through supporters and activists.\n\nOn stage, he was joined by a number of novelty candidates – including one dressed as Elmo – a unique feature of British democracy.\n\n“I promise this: Whether you voted for me or not, I will serve every person in this constituency,” Starmer said.\n\nStarmer has \"net unfavorability ratings\" despite predicted landslide for Labour, expert tells CNN\n\nDespite a predicted landslide win for the UK’s Labour Party, its leader Keir Starmer may have some work to do on his favorability raings, according to one think tank director.\n\n“We see net unfavorability ratings for Keir Starmer, even though he’s going to have this massive, massive majority,” Anand Menon, director of think tank UK in a Changing Europe told CNN. “Beneath this sort of happy story for Labour, there are some warning signs about levels of dissatisfaction with prevailing political trends in this country.”\n\nMenon noted that Starmer intends to “reset relations with European states and the European Union” after a tumultuous few years between the UK and EU after Brexit.\n\nPeople in the UK are “disillusioned,” said Menon, who is a professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at King’s College London. “If you look at the polling, there’s a significant majority of people saying Brexit was the wrong decision, not the right decision.”\n\n“If you do a focus group with voters, they might say Brexit has been bad, Brexit has been a failure. But if you say to them, how about we do another referendum then and go through it all again? You will get a collective eyeroll and a groan and say actually, please, let’s not go through that again,” he told CNN.\n\nHow Labour's \"ming vase\" campaign steered it to victory\n\nThe Labour Party had a very good problem at the start when the election was called: How do you run a campaign that absolutely everyone expects you to win?\n\nKeir Starmer’s party had enjoyed a double-digit lead in opinion polls for the entirety of Rishi Sunak’s premiership, which began in October 2022, and was guaranteed to win the election as long as it didn’t rock the boat during the six-week campaign.\n\nLabour appealed to an electorate tired of the Tories’ chaotic period in government with a single-word slogan: “Change.” But Starmer simultaneously followed a path that some party strategists took to calling a “ming vase” approach, metaphorically looking after a precious and delicate lead in opinion polls. The party repeated its key themes, avoided the temptation to unveil any major policy announcements, and pledged time after time that the party would keep a tight lid on public finances.\n\nThe party’s manifesto was modest, pledging to revive Britain’s flagging public services without a large injection of cash. That has raised eyebrows by independent watchdogs, including the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which said their public spending offer was “tiny, going on trivial.”\n\nBut that was a calculation Labour has stuck to, as they sought to gain a reputation as a sensible, moderate party that can appeal to former Tory voters.\n\nStarmer avoided gaffes, and didn’t interrupt his opponent Rishi Sunak when he was making mistakes of his own.\n\nAnd he became an increasingly difficult rival for the Conservatives to land successful attacks against. Sunak strived to convince voters that Starmer would increase taxes, make Britain less safe, and that he didn’t have the stamina for the job of prime minister — but none of these charges appear to have stuck.\n\nLabour’s projected victory is a personal triumph for Keir Starmer that once seemed impossible\n\nThe Labour Party’s projected victory marks a historic moment in modern British political history and a huge personal triumph for Keir Starmer, the Labour leader who is set to become the country’s next prime minister.\n\nThe UK broadcasters’ exit poll suggests Labour will have a parliamentary majority of 170, returning the party to office for the first time since it lost the 2010 election to the Conservatives, who have been in power ever since.\n\nStarmer’s victory is all the more remarkable considering the journey that Labour has been on since the last general election in 2019. Then, the party suffered its worst loss in a generation under former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who stood on a hard-left platform.\n\nA path back to credibility and even being competitive in a general election looked potentially a decade off, as the Conservatives emerged triumphant from the carnage of Brexit under the charismatic – but chaotic – leadership of Boris Johnson.\n\nJohnson not only defeated his political rivals, but completely upended the norms of British politics. Under his leadership, his party won seats in traditional working-class Labour areas once deemed out of reach to Conservatives. For a year at least, he seemed untouchable.\n\nIt was in this context that Starmer took control of a broken Labour Party on April 4, 2020. On that day, David Lammy, one of his Labour colleagues, took him to one side and warned Starmer: “Set yourself a 10-year cycle. You might just lose the next election, and then you can go again.”\n\nAccording to Lammy, Starmer smiled and said “No, I can do this in five.”\n\nRead more here\n\nLabour will work with Trump if he becomes US president, UK's shadow foreign secretary says\n\nA Labour government would work with Donald Trump if he is voted back in as US president, the UK’s shadow foreign secretary has said. Labour is projected to win 410 seats in the British election and take a massive parliamentary majority of 170 seats, according to the exit poll.\n\nWhen asked if Labour would work with Trump, David Lammy told ITV his party would work “with whomever the American people decide should be incumbent at the White House.”\n\nHe noted that both the UK and US are “democratic countries,” highlighting that the two countries work successfully together in areas such as intelligence and armed forces.\n\n\"This, folks, is huge.\" Farage celebrates exit poll and falsely criticizes media\n\nReform UK’s leader Nigel Farage has described his party’s projected success in the UK election as “huge.”\n\nIn a video posted on X, Farage said: “It’s midnight. There are two results in from the northeast of England that put Reform on 30% of the vote. That is way more than any possible prediction or projection. It’s almost unbelievable.”\n\nThe UK broadcasters’ exit poll predicts that Reform – which did not exist in its current form at the last UK general election – will win 13 seats.\n\n“What does it mean? It means we’re going to win seats. Many, many seats, I think, right now across the country,” Farage added.\n\n“This is going to be six million votes plus. This, folks, is huge.”\n\nFarage also attacked the media claiming that no Reform spokespeople were featured in election night coverage. “There’s not a single representative on there from Reform UK,” he said – a claim that was demonstrably false. Britain’s Channel 4 played the clip and then cut directly to a Reform representative in the studio, Ann Widdecombe.\n\nThe BBC and Sky News had featured David Bull, the deputy leader of Reform, prominently in their live coverage.\n\nLabour gains first new seat of the night, sweeping out a former Conservative minister in Swindon South\n\nThe first of many Labour gains has just been announced – the party has taken Swindon South from the Conservatives.\n\nRobert Buckland, who served as a justice minister in Boris Johnson’s government, has been ousted by Heidi Alexander, a former Labour MP who returned to contest this seat.\n\nThe seat, in western England, was won by the Conservatives last time with an 11% lead, according to the notional results. But Labour earned a thumping majority this time – they won 21,676 votes to the Conservatives’ 12,070.\n\nA disastrous Conservative campaign puts the party on the brink of a worst-ever defeat\n\nThe sight was pitiful – and could easily have been avoided. When Rishi Sunak called the snap vote outside 10 Downing Street, he was drowned out – first by the pouring rain, then by the sound of the D:Ream song “Things Can Only Get Better,” the anthem of Labour’s 1997 election landslide, blaring from a nearby boombox.\n\nThings did not get better for the Conservatives. The campaign went from bad to worse, ending in what is projected to be a heavy defeat. Trying to make smalltalk at a Welsh brewery at an early campaign event, Sunak asked punters if they were excited for the soccer, only to be reminded that Wales had not qualified for the ongoing European Championship. In another campaign stop at the Northern Ireland shipyard that built the Titanic, Sunak, seemingly unaware of the irony, was asked if he, too, was captaining a sinking ship.\n\nBut those gaffes look minor when compared to Sunak’s disastrous decision to leave the 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day landings early to give a routine TV interview that would not air until the following week. The Tories’ patriotic heartlands were outraged: The prime minister left veterans on the beaches. Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform UK party, was delighted: Here was an opportunity to snatch more votes from dyspeptic Tories.\n\nMeanwhile, one last sleaze scandal had been brewing. It was revealed that two Conservative candidates and its director of campaigning were under investigation by the gambling watchdog for allegedly placing bets on the date of the general election.\n\n“Gamble-gate,” as it became known, summed up what for many voters may be their lasting impression of the outgoing Conservative government: A prime minister too weak to control many of his party, and a party more interested in its own fortunes than those of the country.\n\nExit poll projection of a Labour landslide has margins similar to Tony Blair's 1997 win\n\nLabour’s predicted landslide win is a similar margin to the one that swept the party’s then leader Tony Blair into Downing Street in 1997, according to Gideon Skinner, senior UK Director of Politics at market research company Ipsos.\n\nSkinner told CNN the predicted Labour win could be due, in part, to tactical voting among typical Labour and Liberal Democrat voters.\n\nIn 1997, Blair’s Labour party won 418 seats, the largest majority of seats since 1945. The Conservative Party won 165 seats.\n\nAccording to this year’s exit poll, Labour will win 410 seats. That will hand Keir Starmer a massive parliamentary majority of 170 seats, just shy of the party’s greatest-ever result.\n\nThe Conservatives drop to just 131 seats, a stunning collapse by a governing party, according to the poll.\n\nHow each party has fared in the exit poll\n\nLabour is projected to win 410 seats, and a massive majority of 170 seats. This would fall just short of the party’s best-ever result, in 1997, when Tony Blair’s Labour won 418 seats, a majority of 179. The result is in line with what pollsters had projected for Labour, which has enjoyed a huge lead in public opinion for years and had held onto that advantage throughout the campaign.\n\nFor the Conservatives, the result is calamitous. The party, which has earned a reputation over the decades as a ruthless election winner, is projected to win just suffer its worst result since its modern iteration was formed in the 1830s. It is an overwhelming rejection of a ruling party by the British electorate, which has dumped the party from government.\n\nThe centrist Liberal Democrats will be pleased with their result, which puts them on course to return as the UK’s third-largest party. The group has suffered since it joined the Tories in a coalition government between 2010 and 2015, but voters have seemingly forgiven them for that stint.\n\nThe Scottish National Party, a pro-independence group that has dominated politics in Scotland for a generation, will be devastated with the forecast. It signals that the Labour Party has regained its historic strength in Scotland and represents a setback for the Scottish independence movement.\n\nAnd Reform UK, the right-wing populist group led by Nigel Farage, has been forecast to win more seats that most pollsters expected. Farage has hammered the Conservatives on their failure to bring down legal and illegal migration, and had been expected to win the seat where he was standing in Clacton, east of London.\n\nKeir Starmer thanks voters and campaigners, as exit poll puts him on the cusp of power\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer has thanked campaigners and voters, but he hasn’t commented yet on the results of the exit poll that forecast him a huge majority.\n\nAngela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said the exit poll numbers were “encouraging.”\n\n“Keir Starmer has done a tremendous job of transforming the Labour Party and putting forward a program for government that I’m hopeful that people have got behind,” she told BBC immediately after the poll numbers dropped.\n\nRayner said it would “be an absolute honor and a privilege to be reelected,” but added, “I’m not counting my chickens until we’ve got those results coming in.”\n\nSee the full exit poll results\n\nHere’s the full seat breakdown from the exit poll just released.\n\nIt’s a huge return for the Labour Party, a monumental collapse for the Conservatives just five years after they won a landslide election victory, and impressive showings for the centrist Liberal Democrats and the right-wing populist party Reform UK.\n\nLabour: 410 seats\n\nConservatives: 131\n\nLiberal Democrats: 61\n\nReform UK: 13\n\nScottish National Party: 10\n\nOthers: 25\n\nLabour will win 410 seats, exit poll projects, enough for a huge parliamentary majority\n\nLabour will win 410 seats, according to the major exit poll just released. That will hand Keir Starmer a massive parliamentary majority of 170 seats, just shy of the party’s greatest-ever result.\n\nThe Conservatives drop to just 131 seats, a stunning collapse by a governing party, according to the poll.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats will return as the third largest party, with 61 seats.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBREAKING: UK's center-left Labour Party will win general election in a landslide, exit poll projects\n\nThe center-left Labour Party will win Britain’s general election by a landslide, according to a major exit poll, ending a 14-year era of Conservative rule in decisive fashion and putting its leader Keir Starmer on course to become prime minister in the coming hours.\n\nThis is a breaking news story. More details soon…\n\nWhat is King Charles III's role in the election?\n\nYou may have noticed King Charles III hasn’t been out and about quite as much over the last six weeks and it’s not for the reason you think.\n\nIn fact, soon after Rishi Sunak called for a general election, Buckingham Palace announced the family would postpone engagements “which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign.”\n\nWhile the palace doesn’t usually spell this out, it is pretty standard practice as the royals must stay neutral and above politics. As this is the first general election of Charles III’s reign, there may have been a desire from within the institution to emphasize this. So, what is the 75-year-old King’s role in the election, and can he vote?\n\nFirst off, the PM informed King Charles of his decision to call for a general election. That conversation happened on May 22, and it was at that point that the King agreed to Sunak’s request for the dissolution of parliament. Theoretically, Charles could have refused the request but that would be unprecedented in modern times.\n\nThe King has spent the past few days in Scotland for “Holyrood Week,” an annual celebration in the royal calendar recognizing Scottish culture and community. However, he will be needed back in London by Friday. That’s because the day after a general election, the monarch invites the leader of the party that won the most seats in the House of Commons to Buckingham Palace.\n\nAs head of state, the appointment of prime ministers is one of Charles’s core constitutional duties, along with the State Opening of Parliament and signing parliamentary bills into law. During the audience, they become prime minister and are invited to form a government in His Majesty’s name.\n\nWhat election day has looked like across Britain\n\nVoters up and down Britain have been putting their cross in their ballot papers, as church halls, schools and sports centers turn into polling stations for the day.\n\nAnd plenty of Brits brought their four-legged companions along for the experience.\n\nBroadcasters can’t report much about the election while polls are open – but there’s no rules preventing us from showing you as many democratic dogs as possible.\n\nThere’s less than an hour until we can bring you some real news – that’s when the exit poll will drop and we’ll get a sense of how the day has gone for all the parties.\n\nWhat to expect - and when - during election night in Britain\n\nVote-counting in Britain begins the second that polls close, and we should have an idea of the winner a few hours later. Here’s a rough timeline of the night:\n\nThe exit poll: At 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET), the very second that polling stations across the UK close, a major exit poll will project the results of the night. The massive poll is conducted during election day, by pollster Ipsos, for the country’s main broadcasters – the BBC, ITV and Sky. Historically, it’s been an accurate guide to how the night will unfold.\n\nThe first results: Around an hour and an half later, at 11:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET), is when we can expect the first real results of the night. There’s always a race between a handful of seats in the northeast to declare first; the results here will give us clues as to which parties have had a good night.\n\nKey seats declare: By 2 a.m. (9 p.m. ET), we’ll have seen a handful of results and we’ll start to understand the narratives of the evening.\n\nA flood of results: Between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. (10 p.m. and midnight ET) is when results come in thick and fast, and by the time this period is finished, we usually know who’s won and who’s lost the election.\n\nA trip to the King: After 9 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) is when we expect the winner of the election to travel to Buckingham Palace, where he will meet King Charles III and receive permission to form Britain’s next government."
