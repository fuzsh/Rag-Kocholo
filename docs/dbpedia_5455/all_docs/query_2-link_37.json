        "text": "When was the last time you`ve seen someone using a SRM2? I know I haven't lately. Or ever. SRM4 is just so much better.\n\nIn my opinion, it needs a reduction in cooldown. Loading 2 missile tubes should take significantly less time than 4 tubes. How about 3,5 -> 2,5 seconds?\n\nImagine someone using SRM2 against an enemy with Streak SRM2 and winning, thanks to good aim.\n\nIt`s supposed to be a skill based game, remember?\n\nEdited by Kmieciu, 27 February 2013 - 11:43 PM.\n\nI don't see why there should be any reason to ever put in a smaller SRM (or LRM) launcher unles you are limited on tubes, tons, or crits.\n\nSo, no.\n\nI've seen Raven 3Ls with srm2s in the NARC tube, and the same with trebs. But that is all.\n\nall the srm's are exactly the same damage/crit/weight ratios. buff one and you have to buff all 3.\n\n2-packs are already faster than 4-packs, whcih are already faster than 6-packs.\n\nOne Medic Army, on 27 February 2013 - 11:45 PM, said:\n\nI don't see why there should be any reason to ever put in a smaller SRM (or LRM) launcher unles you are limited on tubes, tons, or crits.\n\nSo, no.\n\nAgreed.\n\nJust because it is rarely used doesn't mean that it needs an improvement. It is a niche 1 ton/1 slot (without Artemis) weapon.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of reactionary \"BALANCE ALL THINGS!\" balancing approach that would ruin this game.\n\nThey're in the same 'Why bother having them in the game?' category as machine guns and flamers.\n\nMGs need to be buffed because the next lightest ballistic weapon is 6tons and produces 2heat/second, not because they're unused.\n\nSRM2s don't need to be viable, they already have the advantage vs the SRM4 of weighing less.\n\nIf you want to make them viable, make the SSRM2 at .5tons heavier not outclass them so much.\n\nExcept that SRM launchers scale almost linearly with each other. There's no real reason to use the SRM 2 unless you have too few missile ports. (Read: there are viable alternatives)\n\nUnless you're saying that ALL SRMs need a boost. . .\n\nIf your issue is that the SSRM 2 is out of scale with SRMs, you should make a suggestion about bringing SSRMs into line, not buffing SRMs.\n\nIn my opinion a competitive online game should be balanced.\n\nI would really like to see a duel between SRM2 commando vs a SSRM2 Commando, where the first one has a chance to win. Right now, it`s almost impossible.\n\nAll I`m saying is that SRM2 should have more DPS than SSRM2.\n\nEdited by Kmieciu, 28 February 2013 - 12:33 AM.\n\nKmieciu, on 28 February 2013 - 12:31 AM, said:\n\nIn my opinion a competitive online game should be balanced.\n\nI would really like to see a duel between SRM2 commando vs a SSRM2 Commando, where the first one has a chance to succeed.\n\nMore DPS vs auto aim.\n\nIf the issue is with streaks, deal with streaks. Don't try to \"fix\" aspects that aren't out of balance.\n\nKmieciu, on 28 February 2013 - 12:31 AM, said:\n\nIn my opinion a competitive online game should be balanced.\n\nI would really like to see a duel between SRM2 commando vs a SSRM2 Commando, where the first one has a chance to win. Right now, it`s almost impossible.\n\nAll I`m saying is that SRM2 should have more DPS than SSRM2.\n\nI'd argue that a SSRM2 should be 50% better than an SRM2, since it weighs 50% more.\n\nI think the correct way to achieve this is nerfing the SSRM2 rather than boosting the SRM2.\n\nOne Medic Army, on 28 February 2013 - 12:36 AM, said:\n\nI'd argue that a SSRM2 should be 50% better than an SRM2, since it weighs 50% more.\n\nI think the correct way to achieve this is nerfing the SSRM2 rather than boosting the SRM2.\n\nAnd how will you explain the fact that it`s better to take one less heatsink and a SRM4 instead of SRM2? Or it`s better to take 2 heatsinks instead of a single SRM2 with ammo?\n\nIn general smaller launchers are already faster to reload than larger versions. Probably this reload difference could be enhanced. Just for example:\n\nSRM6 4 seconds (current value)\n\nSRM4 3.5 seconds (-0.25sec)\n\nSRM2 3 seconds (-0.5sec)\n\nSmaller launchers would find have less burst damage but overall higher DPS, This would somehow compensate for being less hardpoint-efficient.\n\nKmieciu, on 28 February 2013 - 12:47 AM, said:\n\nAnd how will you explain the fact that it`s better to take one less heatsink and a SRM4 instead of SRM2? Or it`s better to take 2 heatsinks instead of a single SRM2 with ammo?\n\nThat depends if you need that heatsink or not.\n\nMaybe you're at 10 DHS and 2 tons remaining to add SRMs (and ammo), and you don't want to remove armor.\n\nAdditionally the SRM4 will consume twice the ammunition per shot, meaning you will run out more quickly.\n\nWhy would you mount 2SL and a heatsink instead of 2 ML?\n\nI do it on 2 of my Jenner builds.\n\nEdited by One Medic Army, 28 February 2013 - 01:07 AM.\n\nOne Medic Army, on 28 February 2013 - 12:36 AM, said:\n\nI'd argue that a SSRM2 should be 50% better than an SRM2, since it weighs 50% more.\n\nI think the correct way to achieve this is nerfing the SSRM2 rather than boosting the SRM2.\n\nNew Fluff: SSRMs need to make room for the guidance systems so they have smaller warheads. SSRMS now do 1 damage per missile.\n\nDone.\n\nEdited by Sug, 28 February 2013 - 08:41 AM.\n\nIf you have ever used SRM2, you will find that they fire the two missiles with almost no spread at all. This is a significant benefit for weight limited builds that want to make sure all their missiles hit.\n\nI've used SRM2s very little. I think I used them on my Cent when I did not have any tonnage for anything else and an SSRM w/ ammo was heavier so idk.\n\nOne Medic Army, on 28 February 2013 - 12:19 AM, said:\n\nSRM2s don't need to be viable, they already have the advantage vs the SRM4 of weighing less.\n\nIf you want to make them viable, make the SSRM2 at .5tons heavier not outclass them so much.\n\nOne Medic Army, on 28 February 2013 - 12:36 AM, said:\n\nI'd argue that a SSRM2 should be 50% better than an SRM2, since it weighs 50% more.\n\nI think the correct way to achieve this is nerfing the SSRM2 rather than boosting the SRM2.\n\nThese are the things I was going to say. It's quite ironic that streaks are always compared to SRM6's (and even 4's), when they should be comparable to SRM2's."
