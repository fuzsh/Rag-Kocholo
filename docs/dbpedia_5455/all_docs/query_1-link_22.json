        "text": "City’s push for special election shows need for transparency reform\n\nUntil Nevada’s transparency laws are given teeth to hold officials and agencies directly responsible for unlawfully keeping the public in the dark, the sort of brazen secrecy we now see in North Las Vegas shouldn’t surprise anyone.\n\nAs lawmakers again debate medical aid in dying, patients and doctors say it’s far from simple\n\n2023 marks the fifth legislative session where Nevada lawmakers have debated a measure to legalize life-ending medication for terminally ill patients. The issue is far from partisan\n\nSign up for our newsletters\n\nThe Daily Indy\n\nJoin more than 20,000 Nevadans who start their day with The Daily Indy, our free flagship daily newsletter that gives you what you need to know in Nevada today.\n\nIndy Elections\n\nCompiled by The Indy's elections team, this newsletter rounds up the latest news and trends from the 2024 Nevada campaign trail.\n\nIndy Environment\n\nWritten by energy and environment reporter Amy Alonzo, this weekly newsletter is a roundup of environmental goings-on in Nevada and the West.\n\nIndy Gaming\n\nHoward Stutz’s weekly dive into what’s innovative and interesting in Nevada’s gaming, sports and hospitality industries and how it’s shaping the rest of the world.\n\nDC Download\n\nGabby Birenbaum’s Saturday newsletter brings you the latest news on Nevadans in Washington and how federal policy affects Nevada.\n\nIndy Education\n\nA recap of the top education stories from the week, profiles of interesting staff and students, plus details of family-friendly events and resources throughout the state.\n\nState police union wins salary bump through collective bargaining arbitration, litigation possible\n\nThe arbitrator’s decision requires the union’s collective bargaining agreement with the state to include a requested two percent raise, annual bonuses for longevity and pay incentives for officers with associate or bachelor’s degrees.\n\nLawmakers begin wrapping up 2021 session; ‘Right to Return’ passes, Death with Dignity fails\n\nCrunch time has finally arrived for the Legislature, with lawmakers planning to work steadily through Sunday to work out compromises and pass scores of bills with less than a day and a half left in the 120-day session. Here's a look at some of the latest developments in Carson City on the penultimate day of session.\n\nOut of the shadows: LGBTQ lawmakers reflect on past struggles, future goals\n\nAssemblywoman Sarah Peters’ (D-Reno) ability to share her sexual orientation on the floor of the Legislature without immediate political or social repercussions is not an overnight shift, but rather a product of decades of advocacy and legislation, LGBTQ advocates and lawmakers say.\n\nDemocratic senator seeks overhaul of HIV laws she says will help remove stigma\n\nSen. Dallas Harris (D-Las Vegas) has introduced a bill that would modernize the state’s laws on human immunodeficiency virus by treating HIV in the same way as other communicable diseases.\n\nFreshman Orientation: Senator Roberta Lange\n\nFive years later, Lange said the attacks and attention from her role in the convention have largely evaporated. In talking with Democratic primary voters while running her office, she said she spoke with several Sanders supporters who were at the convention, but was able to have calmer, productive conversations about what had happened.\n\nElection Preview: State Senate races will determine Democrats’ chances at reaching a super-majority\n\nIt’s unlikely Republicans will gain a majority in the Senate without a major wave that gives them victory over essentially all seats in play and a fifth seat that’s considered generally out of reach. Democrats enjoy a 13-8 advantage in the Senate, and Republicans are aiming to both pick up seats and defend potentially vulnerable districts to ensure that Democrats don’t obtain a supermajority.\n\nThe Indy Explains: Question 3, changing Nevada’s pardons and sentence commutations process\n\nBackers of the ballot question (in a digest submitted to the secretary of state’s office) say that the changes in Question 3 will allow the Board of Pardons Commissioners to process its work “in a more timely and efficient manner.”\n\nThe Indy Explains: Question 2, removing same-sex marriage ban from Nevada’s constitution\n\nIf approved, this ballot question would overturn an (unenforced and deemed unconstitutional) section of the Nevada Constitution holding that “only a marriage between a male and female person shall be recognized and given effect in this state.”\n\nLegislative candidates raised $1.8 million over last three months, campaign finance reports show\n\nBut unlike federal candidates, who are required to disclose their donors and political spending ahead of primary and general elections, no such requirement was made in Nevada law for statewide or legislative candidates — leaving voters and the public in the dark on the last two months of fundraising before the state’s primary election.\n\nWhat to watch in Nevada’s 2020 primary election\n\nA substantial number of high-profile races will eventually be decided out of Tuesday’s election, including Republican challengers to Democratic Reps. Susie Lee and Steven Horsford, both who represent swing districts and have attracted a broad field of GOP candidates.\n\nWhat to watch in the 2020 primary election: Assembly and state Senate races\n\nOf the 42 seats in the state Assembly, almost a quarter will be decided in the primary election. Four races will actually be decided in the primary — including three incumbent Republicans fending off challengers — because no other candidates filed to run in those districts. Another five races will effectively be decided in the primary, given vast disparity in voter registration totals making it all but impossible for the opposing party to gain a foothold.\n\nFollow the Money: Legislative fundraising continues at slower pace amid COVID-19\n\nDuring the reporting period, which ran from Jan. 1 to the end of March, legislative candidates reported raising just over $1.5 million, spent $1.26 million and reported holding just over $5.12 million in cash on hand.\n\nFollow the Money: Campaign finance reports show GOP edges in key Assembly races, tight contests in State Senate\n\nDetails from the 2019 contribution and expenses reports, due on Jan. 15, detailed how much legislative incumbents and candidates raised over the last calendar year and painted a more hopeful picture for Republicans in several “swing” Assembly races, with a more mixed view in competitive state Senate seats.\n\nIndy 2020: Candidates close out 2019 with final round of visits, setting stage for race to the finish in 2020\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Indy 2020, a biweekly newsletter focused on the 2020 presidential election in Nevada. A reminder that email subscribers get early access to this newsletter, so be sure to subscribe and tell your friends.\n\nCaucus backs former Democratic Party chair Roberta Lange, instead of Assembly members, for open Senate seat\n\nThe caucus announced the endorsement of Lange on Tuesday. The development marks a significant advantage for Lange in the primary election for a safely Democratic state Senate seat sought by at least two incumbent Assembly members — Ellen Spiegel and Richard Carrillo.\n\nTerms limits, higher ambitions mean at least 11 open seats in the Legislature in 2020\n\nAbout a dozen seats in the Legislature will have no incumbent in the race in the 2020 election, setting the stage for some fierce competition when candidates formally file to run in March, according to an analysis from The Nevada Independent.\n\nEverybody benefits from new and improved public records law\n\nAmong the Nevada Press Association’s six “First Amendment Champions”—announced at their annual convention on Sept. 21—were several whose bipartisan work drawing together a diverse group of stakeholders helped improve the state’s public records law. The fruit of their labors, SB 287, went into effect Oct. 1, and while journalists will certainly benefit from a better Nevada Public Records Act, we should all be thankful for a law that makes access to public information cheaper, more user-friendly, and more accountable."
