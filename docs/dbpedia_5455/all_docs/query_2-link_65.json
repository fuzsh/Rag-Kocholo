        "text": "The polls are closed in Redondo Beach, and voters have had their say on many county-wide races.\n\nREDONDO BEACH, CA — The polls are closed in Redondo Beach, and voters will soon know whether there will be runoff races for county-wide races like Los Angeles County Sheriff. (Scroll for real-time results below.)\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva's bid for a second term will move to a November runoff election against former Long Beach police Chief Robert Luna, with the pair jumping to distant leads Tuesday evening according to early ballot results.\n\nEarly returns showed Villanueva leading the nine-person field with 30.4% of the vote, while Luna collected 27.9%. Sheriff's Lt. Eric Strong was a distant third with 12.8% of the vote.\n\nOver the past century, only one incumbent sheriff in the county has lost a re-election bid. That was four years ago, when Villanueva achieved a stunning upset of Sheriff Jim McDonnell, riding to an election victory with strong backing from reform-minded community groups and Democrats.\n\nBut over the past four years, Villanueva's support among those groups has waned as he repeatedly clashed with the Democrat-dominated Board of Supervisors over funding and policy matters, fought back against claims of \"deputy gangs\" within the agency, defied subpoenas to appear before the Civilian Oversight Commission and refused to enforce the county's COVID-19 vaccination mandate among his deputies and department employees.\n\nHe has openly criticized \"progressive\" policies and politicians, most notably District Attorney George Gascón, and assailed movements to \"defund\" law enforcement agencies.\n\nThose stances, however, have helped solidify his support among many of those working for him, exemplified by his endorsement by the Association of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs.\n\nIn a campaign statement, Villanueva's campaign insists he has worked to restore public trust in the sheriff's department, pointing to the rollout of body-worn cameras and boosting minimum requirements for new deputies. The campaign also boasts the agency is \"the most diverse in the nation.\"\n\n\"In his next term, Sheriff Villanueva will work to reduce violent crime, compassionately clean up homeless encampments and hold public officials accountable for their actions,\" according to his campaign.\n\nLuna argued during the campaign that the sheriff's department is being \"mismanaged\" by Villanueva and said he will work to restore trust in the agency. He also touted his position as an outsider with no connections to the sheriff's department.\n\n\"Growing up in East Los Angeles, patrolled by the sheriff's department, opened my eyes to examples of both good and bad policing, and inspired my 36-year career in law enforcement,\" Luna said in a candidate statement.\n\nHe said he will work to \"modernize\" the sheriff's department and its jail system and improve the mental well-being of deputies and employees.\n\nStrong said his perspectives on law enforcement have been shaped by personal experiences as a crime victim who has had negative interactions with police, and as someone who has had relatives incarcerated or killed by law enforcement. A former Marine and Compton police officer, Strong said he will \"move decisively\" to eliminate deputy gangs and work with the inspector general and oversight agencies.\n\nHe added that he opposes construction of a new central jail, but wants to work to provide alternatives to incarceration to keep people out of the jail system and \"break the cycle of addiction, petty crime and homelessness.\" He also vows to \"put the needs of victims first and take steps to protect them from their perpetrators and re-victimization.\"\n\nSix other candidates were also vying for the sheriff's office, but all were effectively eliminated with the release of early returns, which put the race out of reach.\n\nThe other hopefuls were sheriff's Sgt. Karla Carranza, Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Cecil Rhambo, retired Sheriff's Capt. Matt Rodriguez, parole agent April Saucedo Hood, retired Sheriff's Capt. Britta Steinbrenner and retired sheriff's Cmdr. Eli Vera.\n\nVoters weighed in on a number of Los Angeles County positions, including Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and Los Angeles County Sheriff. Statewide, California voters cast their initial votes for California governor, with Gov. Gavin Newsom defeating challengers and moving to the November election, AP reports.\n\nFor all the county and statewide positions, the two candidates with the most votes on Tuesday will move forward to the Nov. 8 general election. If a candidate in the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors, District 3 race receives more than 50 percent of the vote, they will win outright and bypass the Nov. 8 election.\n\nThose running for LA Co. Sheriff include:\n\nAlex Villaneuva\n\nCecil Rhambo\n\nRobert Luna\n\nApril Saucedo Hood\n\nEli Vera\n\nMatt Rodriguez\n\nBritta S. Steinbrenner\n\nEric Strong\n\nKarla Yesenia Carranza\n\nAnd the candidate for State Senate District 26 is:\n\nMaria Elena Durazo\n\nReal-time results are below — use the scroll on the right to get to the race of your choice (they are in alphabetical order).
