        "text": "State police union wins salary bump through collective bargaining arbitration, litigation possible\n\nThe arbitrator’s decision requires the union’s collective bargaining agreement with the state to include a requested two percent raise, annual bonuses for longevity and pay incentives for officers with associate or bachelor’s degrees.\n\nOut of the shadows: LGBTQ lawmakers reflect on past struggles, future goals\n\nAssemblywoman Sarah Peters’ (D-Reno) ability to share her sexual orientation on the floor of the Legislature without immediate political or social repercussions is not an overnight shift, but rather a product of decades of advocacy and legislation, LGBTQ advocates and lawmakers say.\n\nSign up for our newsletters\n\nThe Daily Indy\n\nJoin more than 20,000 Nevadans who start their day with The Daily Indy, our free flagship daily newsletter that gives you what you need to know in Nevada today.\n\nIndy Elections\n\nCompiled by The Indy's elections team, this newsletter rounds up the latest news and trends from the 2024 Nevada campaign trail.\n\nIndy Environment\n\nWritten by energy and environment reporter Amy Alonzo, this weekly newsletter is a roundup of environmental goings-on in Nevada and the West.\n\nIndy Gaming\n\nHoward Stutz’s weekly dive into what’s innovative and interesting in Nevada’s gaming, sports and hospitality industries and how it’s shaping the rest of the world.\n\nDC Download\n\nGabby Birenbaum’s Saturday newsletter brings you the latest news on Nevadans in Washington and how federal policy affects Nevada.\n\nIndy Education\n\nA recap of the top education stories from the week, profiles of interesting staff and students, plus details of family-friendly events and resources throughout the state.\n\nTitus, Wheeler may face off for state Senate bid in 2022\n\nSettelmeyer’s Senate District 17 covers several western and northern Nevada rural counties, and is one of the safest Republican districts in the state — meaning the winner of the primary is essentially assured a Senate seat. Settelmeyer won the 2018 election with nearly 72 percent of the vote over his Democratic opponent.\n\nNevada grows majority-female Legislature after 2020 election, with more than 60 percent of seats to be filled by women\n\nIn total, the 42-seat state Assembly will have 27 female lawmakers and 14 male lawmakers, including 19 female Democrats and eight female Republicans. In the 21-member state Senate, men will hold 10 seats and females will hold 11 (two Republicans and nine Democrats). Women held 33 of the 63 seats in the 2019 Legislature, hitting the majority mark after two female Assembly members (Rochelle Nguyen and Bea Duran) were appointed to vacant positions by the Clark County Commission in December 2019.\n\nElection Preview: State Senate races will determine Democrats’ chances at reaching a super-majority\n\nIt’s unlikely Republicans will gain a majority in the Senate without a major wave that gives them victory over essentially all seats in play and a fifth seat that’s considered generally out of reach. Democrats enjoy a 13-8 advantage in the Senate, and Republicans are aiming to both pick up seats and defend potentially vulnerable districts to ensure that Democrats don’t obtain a supermajority.\n\nThe Indy Explains: Question 2, removing same-sex marriage ban from Nevada’s constitution\n\nIf approved, this ballot question would overturn an (unenforced and deemed unconstitutional) section of the Nevada Constitution holding that “only a marriage between a male and female person shall be recognized and given effect in this state.”\n\nWhat to watch in Nevada’s 2020 primary election\n\nA substantial number of high-profile races will eventually be decided out of Tuesday’s election, including Republican challengers to Democratic Reps. Susie Lee and Steven Horsford, both who represent swing districts and have attracted a broad field of GOP candidates.\n\nWhat to watch in the 2020 primary election: Assembly and state Senate races\n\nOf the 42 seats in the state Assembly, almost a quarter will be decided in the primary election. Four races will actually be decided in the primary — including three incumbent Republicans fending off challengers — because no other candidates filed to run in those districts. Another five races will effectively be decided in the primary, given vast disparity in voter registration totals making it all but impossible for the opposing party to gain a foothold.\n\nFollow the Money: Legislative fundraising continues at slower pace amid COVID-19\n\nDuring the reporting period, which ran from Jan. 1 to the end of March, legislative candidates reported raising just over $1.5 million, spent $1.26 million and reported holding just over $5.12 million in cash on hand.\n\nCaucus backs former Democratic Party chair Roberta Lange, instead of Assembly members, for open Senate seat\n\nThe caucus announced the endorsement of Lange on Tuesday. The development marks a significant advantage for Lange in the primary election for a safely Democratic state Senate seat sought by at least two incumbent Assembly members — Ellen Spiegel and Richard Carrillo."
