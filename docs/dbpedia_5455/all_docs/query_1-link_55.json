Orem has been the nurturing ground for our six children. OREM is HOME. My commitment to Orem runs deep. Volunteering as a baseball, soccer, and basketball coach, leadership roles in the Boy Scouts of America, as well as significant leadership roles in other charitable and service organizations, I have always sought to make a positive impact. My experience as President and CEO of a local business gave me firsthand knowledge of challenges faced by small business owners.\n\nI am endorsed by both, the Orem Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 33 and the Professional Firefighters of Orem, Local 2742.\n\nI will continue to:\n\n1. Lead with Civility\n\n2. Listen to the citizens. As a concerned and thoughtful council member, I have truly listened to and represented the citizens.\n\n3. Protect our neighborhoods. Growth is always a concern. The key is how we manage that growth.

Support First Responders and city employees.\n\n5. Collaborate and work with other community partners.\n\n385-200-1204 | Spencer@VoteRands.com | VoteRands.com\n\nVideo Interview\n\nMeet the Candidates Speech\n\nSpencer Rands is a devoted husband, proud father of five, successful businessman, and active Orem CARE and Public Safety Commissions volunteer.

As an 18-year resident, I’m ready to do my part to build an Orem that elevates, values, and empowers her people. My platform centers around three words: Trust, Listen, Collaborate. I will build trusting relationships with community, staff, and key stakeholders; I will listen to fellow residents to ensure we are focusing on issues that matter to them; and I’ll collaborate to find win-win solutions for our neighbors, our incredible city staff, and our community partners.\n\nTrue to that spirit I’ve spent years volunteering side by side with residents and working on issues that matter to our city. I served as the board chair of the group that petitioned for a new rec center and library hall; I volunteered as Head Swim Coach at Orem High School; and I’m the Operations Director for the Orem Youth Cycling Association. I hope my vision and past work will give you insight into how I’ll serve on Orem’s City Council.
