        "text": "My view is that you cannot have racing which is both 'pure' and non-processional unless/until the movers and shakers take it upon themselves to control/regulate the turbulent wake produced by F1 cars.\n\nAs long as we have cars which understeer within 1.5 seconds of a car in front, we have a problem. Processional races were not good for the sport and the 'artificial' elements introduced by the Pirelli tyres and DRS are not a sustainable solution either.\n\nTyres are just the symptom.\n\nHembery put it best, you wanted the tyres like that (Ross Brawn cough, cough), so now if you want something else and you can agree on it, go on and do it instead of lobbying in public. Fat chance, he knows that teams can't agree on anything, don't know what they want and can change their minds five times in the process.\n\niotar ,tell us exactly what tyres RB wanted from Pirelli(in 2010)? Pirelli 2011 or Pirelli 2012 or Bridgestone 2010(Canada style). For sure he didn't want narrow tyre window and tyres that work differently on different cars. Did they have to change half of the car to make tyre work on their cars in 2010? I guess not. If tyres have different performance on different cars in same conditions( I mean something bigger that 0,2sec) then tyes are not the same. You don't have to change your car to suit the tyres.\n\niotar ,tell us exactly what tyres RB wanted from Pirelli(in 2010)? Pirelli 2011 or Pirelli 2012 or Bridgestone 2010(Canada style).

If tyres have different performance on different cars in same conditions( I mean something bigger that 0,2sec) then tyes are not the same. You don't have to change your car to suit the tyres.\n\nWhere it happens with 1,5 sec difference? What setup can beat that? How there wasn't such big problem even last year? So, it is the tyres, that were made even softer and with narrow window, to challenge the teams. It is not the cars, they are different every year. But , tyres suit them all in the past, when 2012 tyres suit only some teams in every race. Which tyre window is easy to miss , 10 degree or 30 degree one? If tyres were the same like last year, there wouldn't be so many tyre threads. Everyone can hit the bigger window. They all can push more and we can be happy and see real racing. Teams can focus on car development.\n\nHow that wasn't problem before? Then tyres have to change. How is that cost saving if you have to change your car design? It is better to have tyres that work on all cars(like last year, and year before, and year before and year before and in 1992,1991,1990 and ....). Not to make them artificially challenging. We want to see cars and drivers in battle , not in resolving tyre puzzle.\n\nwe have what we have just let it be for **** sake... there doesn't seem to be any plans to change anything from the FIA so just shut up with all the artificial racing/mario kart racing/ tyre lottery crap; you and other have kept on saying all this **** over many threads and the argument keeps going in circles because ultimately EVERYONE HAS TO USE THE SAME TYRES and it is up to the team to make them work not just give them easier tyres to use.. it is clear some don't like it but many do so lets just give it a rest till after the weekend at least and see how the tyres go in Spain..\n\nWhat are you doing in this thread then? Nobody put you here against your will. You are free to go! Why are you answering me?\n\nAnother worthless 'OMG tyres - made up problem' thread.\n\nWhat annoys me the most that if you asked independently all tyres whiners if there's something wrong just from watching the races they wouldn't notice a difference . But since they heard about from an old, bitter, disgruntled mid-life crisis type of guy, there's some agenda behind it and media amplified it, they are all smart and smug. Stroking their chins and saying, oh yes we the connoisseurs, those tyres, ehh. Mindlessly repeating it without own reflection.\n\n......\n\nWhat are you doing in this thread then? Nobody put you here against your will. You are free to go! Why are you answering me?\n\nWho tell Pirelli to give them complicated tyres? Teams ask about that? I am sure all teams want easy tyres, that just do the job. So ,the teams can focus on racing.\n\nWhen I really found things odd was when I witnessed Kimi's fall from 2nd in China. Never in my years of watching F1 have I seen a car and driver drop from 2nd to 12th within 2 laps and there's nothing wrong with either car or driver or for that matter, tyres. That's how the tyres work!!! Deal with it... it's the same for everyone, right?\n\nHere we go again. Every day there seems to be another thread about tyres. When will people realise that the vast majority of people are perfectly happy with the way it is now and the minority who aren't happy are never going to be. Creating thread after thread which spiral down into the same arguments is not going to solve anything.\n\nSee here for some sanity and a view that most people share - http://www.autosport...rt.php/id/99464\n\nGee... could have been Bernie talking there. Bernie would be happy there.\n\nHis comments are a commercial one and he needs his sponsors. Which team boss in his right mind will say anything, and I mean, anything to make the sport seem officially and deliberately artificial. They'll scream about cheating, unfairness of rules and perpetuated unfair advantages. Why? It's not just and it's not honest racing. The public loves this since it ensures honest racing. The perception of honesty and fairness is essential to the overall appreciation of the proceedings, whether such honesty is genuinely there or not.\n\nThe tyre issue is quite different. It's the same for everyone and Pirelli's approach has apparently been officially sanctioned. Even though, I think it's overdone and a lot may be happening under the public eye to address this. No team principal will speak against it. It would be crazy. You simply cannot use a team principal's word on an issue as this since he has a team to run and sponsors to please.\n\nMichael has been bold to even mention it and persistently so. It takes someone in a special position to feel reasonably safe in saying anything of that nature especially since there are 4 winners after 4 races.....etc!!\n\nThe point is that the majority of viewers just don't care if the racing is artificial or not. They want action and excitement which is what the current F1 is delivering."
