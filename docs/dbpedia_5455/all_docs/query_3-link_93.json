        "text": "The Finger Lakes region is a culinary haven, from lush vineyards producing world-renowned wines to local delicacies you simply cannot find or replicate anywhere else to vibrant public markets that celebrate global ingredients and cuisines. The Finger Lakes provisions are rivaled only by the scenic settings you can enjoy them in– whether it’s in a bustling city like Syracuse or Rochester, or beside a crystal-clear lake like Skaneateles or Cayuga, there is a dish and landscape for every palate.\n\nHometown Classics\n\nGarbage Plate\n\nCredit: @theresnohook on Instagram\n\nRochester’s pride and joy is none other than the “Garbage Plate.” Don’t be fooled by the name, this is all treasure and no trash. Trademarked by Nick Tahou Hots, home of the original Garbage Plate, this local culinary concoction includes your choice of cheeseburger, hamburger, white or red hots, Italian sausage, chicken, or grilled cheese, served alongside home fries, french fries, baked beans, macaroni salad, and topped with spicy meat sauce and onions. Take a tour of the best garbage plates in town and try out award-winning DogTown, Charlie’s, or The Red Fern for a vegetarian spin on the classic dish.\n\nAbbott’s Frozen Custard\n\nPhoto credit: Anna Pakman\n\nFor nearly 100 years, Abbott’s Frozen Custard has been a staple in the Finger Lakes region. With locations throughout New York and all over the country, the smooth and creamy award-winning custard delights sweet tooths all over. Signature flavors include vanilla, chocolate, and chocolate almond, while each location offers varying specialty flavors like pistachio pineapple, black raspberry, and cotton candy.\n\nWhite Hots\n\nCredit: @stoneyardbrewingcompany on Instagram\n\nMade with uncured and unsmoked pork, veal, and beef (which is where they get their white color from), “white hots” are considered a regional delicacy. To give them their unique flavor, a blend of spices is added, which includes mustard and paprika. Chow down at F.L.X. Wienery, DogTown, or grab a famous Zweigle’s white hot on-the-go.\n\nSalt Potatoes\n\nSyracuse got the nickname “The Salt City” due to its history as one of the top salt producers in the county, thanks to prosperous salt springs mainly located on the Onondaga Lake. Irishmen working in the salt mines would boil salt water and toss potatoes in for lunch, resulting in what became known as the delicious “salt potato.” Check out Bull & Bear Roadhouse for Loaded Salt Potatoes, a flavorful twist on the Syracuse staple.\n\nGrape Pie\n\nCredit: @mollmcbutter on Instagram\n\nNaples is the Grape Pie capital of the world, producing over 70,000 grape pies every single year! Unique to the Finger Lakes, these fruity confections were first created in the 1950s and best made with grapes freshly picked in the late summer and early fall. Grab a slice at Cindy’s Pies in Naples, Heart ‘n Hand in Skaneateles, or at the Naples Grape Festival on September 28-29.\n\nMust-Try Meals\n\nRedd\n\nBoasting a Michelin star, Redd in Rochester is not-to-be-missed. Chef Richard Reddington, a native of Rochester, has made an indelible mark on the culinary landscape. His passion for food and wine was sparked by his travels throughout Europe as a young adult and fueled by his experiences working in some of the world’s best kitchens. Reddington has been honored with multiple nominations for the James Beard Award for Best Chef in the Pacific Region, and Redd was included in the “2024 USA TODAY Restaurants of the Year” list. The seasonal menu features dishes like wild halibut with summer vegetables, guajillo broth, and charred tortilla crust, a woodfired Roberta’s Bee sting pizza, with soppresata, mozzarella, honey, and chili flakes, and a Maine lobster risotto with lemon confit, truffle oil, and watercress.\n\nMoosewood\n\nCredit: @adriannainewell on Instagram\n\nEstablished in 1973, Ithaca’s Moosewood Restaurant has been a trailblazer in the realm of plant-based cuisine, gaining international acclaim for its dedication to vegetarian, pescatarian, raw, and organic dishes. The venue is also globally known for its iconic Moosewood Cookbook, which has sold more than six million copies. Named one of the \"thirteen most influential restaurants of the 20th century\" by Bon Appétit magazine, Moosewood crafts a menu daily from the freshest ingredients, ensuring that each dish is a unique and delightful experience. Enjoy seasonal dishes like the Moroccan Chickpea Stew, Chili Verde Tostada, or the Mushroom Lentil Pate.\n\nThe Cellar\n\nCalled out by Wine Spectator as one of “9 Standout Wine Restaurants in Upstate NY,” and awarded “Best of Award of Excellence” multiple times, The Cellar combines locally-sourced ingredients and a deft touch to help establish Corning’s Gaffer District as a culinary destination. Delight in dishes like sweet potato gnocchi with maple bourbon butter and pecans, local pastured pork ramen, or the ever-popular chicken and waffles, drizzled with a zesty sriracha maple syrup. To make a delicious meal even sweeter, enjoy making s’mores right at your table with house-made marshmallows and house-made graham crackers.\n\nDinosaur Bar-B-Que\n\nDinosaur Bar-B-Que has gained a national reputation for serving some of the best BBQ in the country in a vibrant and lively setting, and it all started in Syracuse. Beyond their six locations spanning New York, their sauces and rubs are sold and enjoyed nationwide, and even in Europe and Japan. The southern-style BBQ cuisine has earned recognition on the Food Network, Travel Channel, Good Morning America, and ABC World News. And their very own cookbook, Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse, was voted as one of the best BBQ cookbooks by the National Association of BBQ. Savor the smokey flavors of St. Louis Ribs, pulled pork, spicy shrimp boil, cajun fried catfish, prime brisket, West Texas ribeye, and so much more.\n\nF.L.X. Table\n\nF.L.X. Table is one of the Finger Lakes region’s premier dining experiences, and was named USA Today’s Best New Restaurant in 2017. The venue only has fourteen to sixteen seats and there is no boundary between the guests and the kitchen, making an intentionally intimate and interactive dining experience. Every evening they serve a prix fixe five-course tasting menu that constantly evolves based on seasonality. The Chef sources the best ingredients possible, both locally and from farms who share their locally derived ideals.\n\nUnique Dining Experiences\n\nRadio Social\n\nCredit: @radiosocial on Instagram\n\nRadio Social is the trifecta of foodie fun: award-winning food, craft cocktails, and engaging entertainment. The 42,000-square-foot facility (housed in a historical former radio factory) features a mouth-watering middle eastern menu, craft cocktail + whiskey bars, 34 bowling lanes, lounge areas, and a variety of indoor and outdoor games. Come for Sunday brunch and indulge in menu items like lamb shakshuka, Radio chop cheese, and watermelon salad. Stop in for dinner to try the chicken schnitzel sammie, duck sausage, and glazed pork belly. The venue regularly hosts events, and this fall they’re hosting the NY Cider Marketplace Tasting & Cheese Pairing!\n\nPlayhouse/Swillburger\n\nHoused in an old church building, Swillburger offers burgers, cocktails, and vintage arcade games in a local, sustainable modern way. Where else can you play Skee-Ball with one hand while the other holds a burger? Just about anything on the menu can be served vegan, and gluten-free buns and a gluten-free fryer allow for those with dietary restrictions to dine worry-free. Try the double veggie burger and pair it with a vegan chocolate or vanilla shake.\n\nFunk 'n Waffles\n\nPhoto courtesy of Visit Syracuse\n\nPart waffle house, part bar, part music venue — Funk ‘n Waffles is a uniquely funky food experience. Dozens of sweet and savory waffle varieties decorate the menu, which also boasts juicy fried chicken, grilled sandwiches, vegan options, and an espresso bar to wash it all down. Some of their most popular waffle creations are the “Jive Turkey” (homemade stuffing waffle with smoked turkey, garlic mashed potatoes, gravy, and a side of cranberry sauce), “Carry On My Wayward Spud” (mashed potato, bacon, and cheddar stuffed buttermilk waffle topped with more bacon and a side of sour cream), and the “James Brownie” sweet waffle (brownie with ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.) And to top it all off, live music sets the scene as you chow down!\n\nGlen Iris Inn\n\nCredit: @kh_kremer on Instagram\n\nDinner with a view has never looked better than at the Glen Iris Inn, overlooking the iconic falls of Letchworth State Park. Caroline’s Dining Room at the Inn serves breakfast, lunch and dinner daily from May through November. For breakfast enjoy brioche French toast or the Chef’s omelet of the day. The lunch offers the Nashville hot chicken sandwich or chickpea salad sandwich. And for dinner, treat yourself to seared sea scallops or steak frites.\n\nRise n Shine Diner\n\nCredit: @risenshinediner on Instagram\n\nRise N Shine’s concept consists of the 3 B’s, Breakfast, Brunch & Brinner. This Syracuse staple focuses on freshly prepared, all-natural ingredients, sourcing from area farms as much as possible. Visually stimulating food presentations combined with innovative flavor combinations culminate in the ultimate drinking and dining experience. Guests can indulge in dishes ranging from cauliflower breakfast pizza to deep fried hazelnut ganache stuffed French toast to a Korean style breakfast corn dog. If you can’t choose just one thing, try a flight of your favorite food! The popular eggs benny and pancake flights keep stomachs satisfied, while the pancake sushi captivates the eyes and the appetite (pancakes stuffed with edible cookie dough and rice krispie treats, rolled into sushi-like pieces, topped with fresh fruits, blueberry syrup, and matcha infused icing.)\n\nInternational Cuisine\n\nRochester Public Market\n\nCredit: @ava.picsoflove on Instagram\n\nThe Rochester Public Market has served the community since 1905 and offers the most diverse culinary gathering in the region; a source of character, culture, and community. You’ll find a huge assortment (over 300 vendors) of fresh seasonal produce direct from area farmers, as well as meats, seafood, baked goods, pasta, specialty and prepared foods from around the country and world! On the market grounds and in the surrounding Market Business District you’ll find cafes, coffee shops, bakeries, full service restaurants, food stands, a brewery, a distillery, and much more. The market also hosts over 40 free-admission special events every year!\n\nSalt City Market\n\nCreated by the Syracuse Urban Partnership, this food hall and public market is all about food, culture, and people building generational wealth doing what they love. The 10+ independently-owned food stalls represent regional and international cuisine like Baghdad Middle Eastern, Erma's Island, Firecracker Thai Kitchen, Habiba's Ethiopian Kitchen, and more. Pockets of food and culture are tucked away in small grocers and bodegas, community rooms, and a teaching kitchen.\n\nBon Ami French Bistro\n\nIn the charming lakeside city of Canandaigua, you’ll find Bon Ami French Bistro, serving authentic flavors of France. This upscale bistro is owned-and-operated by Georges Vindigni, who was born in a French-speaking area of North Africa and has many familial ties to Southern France. On the menu you’ll find classic French dishes like ratatouille, bouillabaisse, and tartine. Pair your meal with a French wine from the venue’s carefully curated wine list.\n\nEva’s European Sweets\n\nDelight in authentic Polish cuisine and European-style desserts right in Syracuse at Eva’s. Owned-and-operated by Eva Zaczynski, this beloved neighborhood venue has been around since 1997 and has drawn in visitors from all over– including celebrity chef Guy Fieri, who visited Eva’s and chowed down on the crispy potato pancakes on an episode of “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.” Enjoy Eva’s Polish recipes, including scratch-made pierogies, bigos stew, fried kielbasa, and the Hungarian take on traditional placki. Don’t forget to check out the dessert case as you walk in, full of homemade cakes, pies, and cheesecakes.\n\nRheinblick German Restaurant\n\nRelish in authentic German fare in an original Old World atmosphere! Owned by German natives, Gary and Gudrun Klemens, at Rheinblick you'll find a plethora of bona fide German dishes including sauerbraten, pork, chicken, or veal schnitzel, bratwurst, and kartoffelpuffer. Sip your way through the wine list which features German varietal grapes as well as options from the many Finger Lakes wineries. The atmosphere of the restaurant fully envelops you in Germany, and the servers wear traditional clothing!\n\nSweet Treats\n\nFinger Lakes Ice Cream Trail\n\nCredit: @ithaca_is_yutam2020.jp on Instagram\n\nRefreshing and innovative flavors await you on the Finger Lakes Ice Cream Trail, taking you to nine spots as scenic as they are creamy.
