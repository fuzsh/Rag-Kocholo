        "text": "Queen Maud's funeral\n\nI was watching a Pathe video about the funeral of Queen Maud and it showed her coffin in a church which the commentator said was the \"Lutheran Cathedral of Our Saviour\" in Oslo, but it doesn't look like the cathedral. Looking at pictures of the cathedral there are windows in the east wall on either side of the altar but in the video there are none, and the altars are different. Does anyone know in what church the funeral took place?\n\nI recently watched a Norwegian language film on the BBC called The King's Choice (Kongens Nei) about King Haakon's role during the German invasion of Norway.\n\nHaakon comes across as remarkable man, a true patriot & a fine king. What an inspirational story. I found it very emotional, especially a scene where Haakon talks to a very young soldier (a boy really) who is about to put his life on the line to protect his king.\n\nHaakon comes across as literally the father of his people. I loved the way Norwegians raised their hats to their king as they passed by. Haakon's relationship with his grandson was so sweet & touching. Even gruff stern old men become like children with their grand children\n\nRelated to this is the story of the loss of HMS Glorious, HMS Acasta & HMS Ardent in which over 1500 men lost their lives. There is some suggestion that the commander of HMS Devonshire, which was evacuating King Haakon & the Crown Prince to England, did not pass on a message from Glorious that it had sighted German warships. Devonshire was under orders not to break radio silence. As a result the British had no idea that the ships had been attacked & sunk by the German battleships Scharnhorst & Gneisenau & no rescue attempt was put into effect. Nine hundred men are reported to have survived the initial sinking of Glorious but almost all of them succumbed over the next 72 hours in the cold waters of the North Sea waiting in vain for help that would never come. When Norwegian ships found the survivors three days later only 40 men were still alive. One of the worst British naval disasters of all times. What terrible events they were.\n\nI will definitely rewatch this film. Very moving & uplifting.

Alt for Norge.\n\nI watched this on SBS Australia and like you I was also very moved by this film. I have always loved the Norwegian family as I admire the love King Harald has for his people but did not know much about King Haakon. This film showed what a remarkable king he was during the the war and I would encourage anyone who gets the chance to see it.\n\nWhen Prince Carl of Denmark became King of Norway, do you think he made the Norwegian people happy by taking the name Haakon for his regnal name?\n\nYes, probably; what nation regaining their independence from medieval times wouldn't be flattered? But it's not like it was an ingenious or uncommon thing to do — he would have just had to have looked at his Uncle Wilhelm, George I of Greece for the past several decades.\n\nDo you think Maud made them unhappy by not changing her name?\n\nYes, probably; what nation regaining their independence from medieval times wouldn't be flattered? But it's not like it was an ingenious or uncommon thing to do — he would have just had to have looked at his Uncle Wilhelm, George I of Greece for the past several decades.\n\nDo you think Maud made them unhappy by not changing her name?\n\nNo, I do not believe that the Norwegian people were unhappy that Maud did not change her name.\n\nYes, probably; what nation regaining their independence from medieval times wouldn't be flattered?

They are probably the best books written about Haakon and Maud, as far as i know they are only available in Norwegian.\n\nI know the question was not for me, but i answered it anyway.\n\nI have read the 8 part biographical book series about Haakon VII and Maud by Tor Bomann-Larsen, and as far as i remember there was never any suggestion that anybody unhappy that Maud did not change her name.\n\nThe 8 books where written between 2002 and 2019.

When other historians have generally pointed out his theory has huge holes in it?\n\nI have read the 8 part biographical book series about Haakon VII and Maud by Tor Bomann-Larsen, and as far as i remember there was never any suggestion that anybody unhappy that Maud did not change her name.\n\nThe 8 books where written between 2002 and 2019.

I hope you will continue to contribute. There is an unfortunate scarcity of Norwegian posters at the moment.\n\nHow can they be the best books about Haakon and Maud when they're most (in)famous for Bormann-Larsen making new accusations about their son's paternity and legitimacy? When other historians have generally pointed out his theory has huge holes in it?\n\nDid Mr. Bormann-Larsen question King Olav's legitimacy? I was under the impression that his theory was limited to Olav's biological paternity.\n\nI am not familiar with the critiques of his theories. Could you give a short summary?"
