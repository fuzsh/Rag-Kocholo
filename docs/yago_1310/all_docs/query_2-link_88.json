She was baptized 24 December 1869 in London.[1]\n\nShe was married to Carl Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg, later King Haakon of Norway, 22 July 1896 at Buckingham Palace, London, England. [2][3]\n\nMaud died 20 November 1938 at Appleton House, Norfolk, England at the age of 68. Her remains were buried 8 December 1938 at the Royal Mausoleum at Akershus Castle in Olso.[4]\n\nObituary:[5]\n\nQueen Maud of Norway Dies at 68\n\nHeart Attack Fatal in London Following Abdominal Operation\n\nLondon, Nov. 20 (AP)--Queen Maud of Norway, 68, aunt of King George VI of Great Britain and the last surviving child of King Edward VII, died early Sunday of a heart attack following an abdominal operation four days ago.\n\nHer death came so suddenly that King Haakon of Norway, who was staying at Buckingham Palace and had been almost constantly with his Queen, was not at her bedside.\n\nAnnouncement of her death was withheld until the people of Norway had been informed by radio. Norwegian radio stations immediately suspended their program for two minutes of silence and then played solemn music for the rest of their broadcasts.\n\nThe Norwegian Minister to London issued this statement from specialists:\n\n\"Her Majesty, Queen Maud of Norway, died suddenly and without previous warning of heart failure at 12:25 a.m. Saturday. During the hours preceding midnight, distresses incidental to an abdominal operation had diminished and a disturbed day had given place to restfulness.\"\n\nAfter her marriage to Haakon at Buckingham Palace July 22, 1896, the young English Princess, sister of the late George V, visted here often. She stayed frequently at Appleton House, Suffolk, which her father gave her as a wedding present on condition that she visit it every year while he and her mother lived.\n\nShe came to England also for important royal occasions and attended the funeral of the late King George and the Coronation of the present King.\n\nKing George commanded four weeks of court mourning for Queen Maud, who died exactly thirteen years to the day after her mother, Queen Alexandria.\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975\", database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NTPF-K9R : 21 March 2020), Maud Charlotte Mary Victoria Princess, 1869.\n\n↑ Wikipedia:Maud_of_Wales\n\n↑ Wikipedia:nn:Maud_av_Noreg\n\n↑ Maud Charlotte Mary of Great Britain on Find A Grave: Memorial #10198337 Retrieved 20 sep 2016.\n\n↑ Queen Maud of Norway Dies at 68, Dallas Morning News, Monday, Nov 21, 1938 , Dallas, TX, Page: Five."
