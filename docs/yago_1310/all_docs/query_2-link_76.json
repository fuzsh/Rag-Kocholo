        "text": "Tonight's episode of Atlantic Crossing shows King Haakan and Crown Prince Olav seeking refuge at Buckingham Palace in London during the German occupation of Norway. Upon their entrance, you can hear King George call King Haakan, \"uncle,\" and Olav, \"cousin.\"\n\nAnd when Haakan says \"Thanks for taking us in,\" Queen Elizabeth, the future Queen Mother, can be heard saying, \"That's what family's for, isn't it?\" But how exactly are the British royals and the Norwegian royals related?\n\nAs with so many interconnected monarchies, it all goes back to Queen Victoria and Christian IX of Denmark.\n\nNicknamed the grandmother and father-in-law of Europe, Victoria and Christian were known for the matchmaking prowess, and their ability to marry their descendants into other royal families across the continent. The Norwegian royal family is one such example.\n\nNotably, King Haakan was the grandson of Christian IX, and his wife, Maud of Wales, was the granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Maud's brother was King George V; therefore, King Haakan is King George VI's uncle by marriage, and Crown Prince Olav is his first cousin.\n\nThe current monarchs of the UK and Norway are also closely related. Queen Elizabeth (the daughter of King George VI) and King Harald of Norway (the son of Crown Prince Olav) are second cousins.\n\nAs Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip are themselves third cousins, and Prince Philip is also a direct descendent of Queen Victoria, King Harald is also independently related to him."
