        "text": "Just like a modern-day fairy tale, some royals have turned their back on tradition and married a regular commoner, instead of a fellow member of the ruling class.\n\nWhen the royals do anything, people love to hear about it, especially in the romance department. Whether it be a royal wedding or a new royal romance, people love to hear the details. And people especially love to hear about when a royal member falls for a commoner — which Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton were all considered at the time of their courting.\n\nYou’ve definitely seen a Hallmark movie that romanticizes the trope: A royal family member gives up their throne or risks everything to be with the commoner-girl-next-door type. And when Prince Harry was swept off his feet by Meghan Markle in 2016, that felt like proof that that Hallmark love happens in real life too, even down to Harry giving up his royal title a few years later. Hallmark movies didn’t lie to us after all — many Royal members in real life risk it all for love, not just Harry.\n\nFrom Great Britain to Japan, love truly knows no boundaries — and these recent famous examples aren’t the only ones who’ve had a real-life Hallmark love story. From love at first sight like Princess Beatrice to Prince Charles’ multiple proposals, check out some wild stories about how royals marrying commoners has played out over the years.\n\nA version of this article was originally published in Oct. 2021."
