Maud was already in her late twenties, old by princess standards of the day. I think she and Carl had plenty in common and he was a cousin, so she knew a lot about him anyway.\n\nApparently she was rather bored with life in Denmark, however. Healthwise Maud was unsuited to those long Scandinavian winters. She was rather delicate like all Alexandra's children (most were born prematurely, irritating Queen Victoria who liked to be in at the birth of grandchildren if possible.) Maud was very thin and delicate looking. Her waist was one of the smallest I've ever seen. A grapefruit would have seemed huge next to it.\n\nWell the alternative would have been to have remained a handmaiden to Mama dearest, Alexandra, like her sister Victoria.

Maud was very thin and delicate looking. Her waist was one of the smallest I've ever seen. A grapefruit would have seemed huge next to it.\n\nShe was harldy goig to say she wasn't \"very happy\"... I think it was an OK match, but she did IIRC prefer England to Denmark and Norway and I think there was a bit of tension about that, that she wanted to spend more time in Enlgand, and Carl and the Danish RF or the Norwegians were critical of this. However I agree that the alternative being to be a spinster daughter to Alexandra, wasn't appealing.. and she probably was happy to be married nad have some life of her own. I think she and Carl got on OK but it wasn't a big love affair...\n\nAt the time their son was born, Prince Carl had not yet been chosen to be King of Norway. Had this occurred earlier, perhaps he and Maud might have had more children.\n\nI don't quite see why. Maud was 27 when she married and it was about 5 or 6 years before she had a baby.. I think she wasn't very fertile..or Carl wasn't...."
