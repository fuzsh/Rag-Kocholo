        "text": "Most people are familiar with the major players in the British royal family: Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles, his sons William and Harry, their wives Kate and Meghan, and the royal babies, George, Charlotte, Louis, and little Archie. In contrast, the Norwegian royal family isn't quite so well known in the U.S. But Atlantic Crossing, a new series airing this spring on Masterpiece PBS could change that. The show follows the Norwegian royals during WWII, following the German occupation of their country. Amid the war, King Haakon VII left Norway for the UK; His son Crown Prince Olav went with him, and from there, they strategized how best to fight. Olav's wife Crown Princess Martha took their children to America, where she befriended FDR. (For those who loved the mix of royal drama and political intrigue in The Crown, consider this your next binge.)\n\nHere, a who's who of Olav and Martha's key descendants, including the modern monarch, King Harald V, who features in the series as just a young boy. As the Norwegian royal family's website explains: \"The Royal House of Norway belongs to the House of Glücksburg. The members of the Norwegian Royal House are Their Majesties King Harald and Queen Sonja and Their Royal Highnesses Crown Prince Haakon, Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Princess Ingrid Alexandra.\"\n\nThe site goes on to explain that these core members of the royal family \"are in addition the Crown Prince and Crown Princess’s other children, His Highness Prince Sverre Magnus and Mr Marius Borg Høiby; Her Highness Princess Märtha Louise, Miss Maud Angelica Behn, Miss Leah Isadora Behn, Miss Emma Tallulah Behn and Her Highness Princess Astrid, Mrs Ferner.\"\n\nCrown Prince Haakon is King Harald and Queen Sonja's younger child, but as he is their only son, he will inherit the Norwegian throne. In 1990, the Norwegian laws of succession were changed to abolish male primogeniture\n\n\"The Constitution was amended in 1990, and it is now the oldest child, regardless of gender, who accedes to the Throne,\" reads the royal family's website. But it notes that the line of succession was not changed retroactively: \"In connection with the entry into force of the new amendment, a decision was taken to apply the previous rule to all children born prior to 1990.\"\n\nSo, Prince Haakon is the heir to the throne, and not his older sister Princess Märtha Louise.\n\nThe royal family's website notes that Haakon loves surfing, skiing, and music, and that his official duties often focus on \"Norwegian business, youth and diversity, and nature - with a special regard for the ocean and the issue of climate change.\""
