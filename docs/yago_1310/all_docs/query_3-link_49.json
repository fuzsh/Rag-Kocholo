        "text": "Surrounding this exquisite piece of royal regalia, there exists a tale that sparkles with intrigue. A\n\ndiamond and pearl tiara sits at the centre of a crime never to have been solved. The towering\n\ndiadem is Edwardian in style featuring a delicate diamond scroll motif and pear shaped pearl toppers and is transformable into a low-lying version.\n\nRead More\n\nServing up Jack Draper, the golden boy of British tennis with razor-sharp good looks and a 138mph serve\n\nIn the August 2023 issue, deputy features editor Annabel Sampson met Jack Draper. Revisit the feature amidst the latest Olympic drama…\n\nIt is believed to have been created by the jewellers Carrington and Co in 1896 in time to be worn by Princess Maud of Wales at her wedding to Prince Carl of Denmark. Maud was the fifth child of Albert and Alexandra, Prince and Princess of Wales, who would soon ascend the British throne upon the death of Albert’s mother, Queen Victoria in 1901.\n\nWhen the union of 1814 between Norway and Sweden was dissolved it triggered the decision to invite Carl and Maud to be the new King and Queen of Norway, he was subsequently renamed and crowned a year later in 1906 as King Haakon VII. Throughout her reign, Queen Maud split her time between England and Norway, often being spotted wearing her precious pearl tiara at state events showcasing her covetable sense of style.\n\nRead More\n\n‘You were a pillar of light and love’: Sarah Ferguson says she will ‘forever remember’ the laughter she shared with Diana in a gushing tribute to the late Princess of Wales\n\nThe Duchess of York shared a snap alongside Diana on her Instagram page this week, on what would have been the Princess' 63rd birthday\n\nIt was possibly due to the impending war that Maud had brought much of her jewellery collection with her from Norway upon a stay in 1938, when, following an operation she unexpectedly passed away. For the following fifteen years, the Norwegian jewellery was held safely in the UK only to be amicably reclaimed following the family’s attendance at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.\n\nMaud’s grandson, the current King Harald V of Norway and his wife Sonja, ascended the throne in 1991. As firm fans of Maud’s tiara, they sent it to London for refurbishing by renowned British\n\njewellers Garrard in 1995, only for it to be stolen during a planned heist involving three armed robbers.\n\nNearly 70 police officers were immediately assigned to the premises but to no avail, the tiara was among the thieved items and has never been found. Of course, the House of Garrard, creators of the most significant British regal treasures, crafted a perfect replica to present to the family."
