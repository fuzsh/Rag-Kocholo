He was trained for a naval career. In 1896 he married Princess Maud, daughter of England’s Edward VII. He was offered the Norwegian crown in 1905, after the dissolution of the Swedish–Norwegian union, and he agreed to accept it only if he were approved in a Norwegian plebiscite. Overwhelmingly approved on Nov. 12, 1905, he was elected king by the Storting (parliament) on November 18. He was given the Old Norse name of Haakon.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
