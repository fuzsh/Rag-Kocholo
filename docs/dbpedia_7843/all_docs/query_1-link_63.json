        "text": "Insurance information for FH Joanneum University of Applied Sciences\n\nInsurance is important while studying at FH Joanneum University of Applied Sciences because it can protect students from financial loss due to unforeseen circumstances such as accidents, illness, or theft. It can also provide coverage for tuition and other school-related expenses in case of emergency or withdrawal from classes. Having insurance can also provide peace of mind and allows you to focus on your studies.\n\nAbout FH Joanneum University of Applied Sciences\n\nOur organization offers an education with a practical and hands-on focus and moved away from sole paperwork. We are putting lean structures and fast processes in place to improve our efficiency. We are using and testing state-of-the-art media in interacting with our partners.\n\nFind interesting master studies for FH Joanneum University of Applied Sciences at Mastersportal\n\nInsurance, that's expensive, right?\n\nNot at all! In Austria, Aon is most of the times much cheaper than insurances offered by your university. Aon provides different insurance packages staring as low as 0.53 € per day! Save money for things that matter to you.\n\nCheck it out\n\nInsurance information for Austria\n\nIf you are going to study and live in Austria, you want to be fully prepared before starting your adventure. Among other things, you want to make sure your insurance covers everything you need, without paying too much.\n\nStudents from EU/EEA countries\n\nStudents from EU/EEA countries, who are in possession of valid health insurance in their home country, may use the European Health Insurance Card (see more about EHIC in the FAQ). This is a free card that gives you access to medically necessary, state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in any of the 27 EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland under the same conditions and at the same cost (free in some countries) as people insured in that country. Please note that EHIC is according to EU recommendations not an alternative for Travel Insurance. EHIC does not guarantee free services. As each country’s healthcare system is different services that cost nothing at home might not be free in another country\n\nStudents from outside EU/EEA countries\n\nStudents from outside the EU/EEA will have to take out a health insurance corresponding to the standard of the Austrian local public carriers or arrange private insurance\n\nOption A: National health insurance for International Students\n\nDegree programme students (“ordentliche Studierende”) at all universities and universities of applied sciences (“Fachhochschulen”) as well as non-degree programme students (“außerordentliche Studierende”) at University Preparation Programmes (“Vorstudienlehrgänge”) may take out a student insurance (\"Studierendenselbstversicherung\") with the relevant Gesundheitskasse.\n\nThe main requirements are residence in Austria and a confirmation of admission or continuation of your studies from the relevant higher education institution. Certain conditions (e.g. duration of studies, income limits, possibly also study breaks and changes of fields of studies), however, have to be taken into consideration. By December 31st of each year you have to submit a valid confirmation of the continuation of your studies (“Fortsetzungsbestätigung”) to the Gesundheitskasse. This has to provide proof for the entire academic year that you are entitled to continue your studies as a degree programme student (“ordentliche/r Studierende/r”) at the Austrian university (or as a nondegree programme student in a University Preparation Programme).\n\nOption B: Private health insurance for International Students\n\nThe National Health insurance is not mandatory, you have the alternative of taking out a private health insurance. This applies for both EU and non-EU students.\n\nFor students from outside the EU/EEA visa approval an explicit written statement (a “To Whom it might concern” letter”)– in addition to the insurance policy – ,could be required, confirming what the insurance covers i.e. that the insurance does not have any waiting periods, deductibles or cost caps, the period of cover etc. It will also explain that a direct guarantee of payment can be obtained, so the medical provider will get the payment directly from us and not from the student.\n\nInsurance, that's difficult, right?\n\nNo worries, we've got you covered. Together with our partner Aon, we are going to make sure you get the perfect insurance package. Your study abroad adventure will be awesome, but insured for all risks, including health care.\n\nShow my options\n\nIs this enough?\n\nIt is important to understand that the EHIC (European Health Insurance Card) is not always enough, Please note that EHIC is according to EU recommendations not an alternative for Travel Insurance, and that the local health insurance will probably not cover:\n\nAdditional medical costs, i.e. dental\n\nRepatriation\n\nLiability\n\nHome contents and baggage\n\nAccidents\n\nLegal aid\n\nYou will need an insurance policy also covering, but also arranging for you, for example:\n\nYou returning home if a close relative is seriously ill or dies;\n\nUp to two close relatives visiting you in if you fall seriously ill;\n\nYour medical repatriation to your home country for hospitalization or rehabilitation treatment;\n\nor in the worst possible situation, returning a body home for burial.\n\nTuition Fee Insurance for international students what is it and why its useful\n\nFree quote from Aon\n\nVia our partner Aon, you can easily discover details that apply to your specific situation. To get advice and insight in the costs of insurance, you can freely request an instant quote.\n\nAbout Austria\n\nAustria offers affordable education options with free degrees for EU/EEA citizens at public universities. Non-EU/EEA students also benefit from reasonable fees, usually below 2,000 EUR per year. Despite this affordability, Austrian universities maintain high academic standards and are consistently ranked among the best in Europe. In addition to its excellent education system, Austria is known for being one of the safest countries globally, providing a high quality of life and top-notch infrastructure and services. Art lovers can indulge in numerous museums and galleries, while Austria's rich musical heritage includes renowned composers like Mozart and Schubert. Sports enthusiasts can partake in various activities such as alpine skiing, mountain biking, hockey, and swimming."
