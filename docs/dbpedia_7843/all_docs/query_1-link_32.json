        "text": "Howdy,\n\nI’m in the 2nd year of “Comunication and Design Multimedia” and I’m really interested in doing the Erasmus programme for the next year. For those that don’t know about Erasmus, it is a student exchange programme around Europe for higher education (university, etc).\n\nMy university has some agreements, not many, and what I’d like from you is information! If you live in the same country as any of the following universities, or you know about it, whats your opinion about them? Did you study there? Which one do you think is the best?\n\nHere are my options:\n\nPirkanmaa Polytechnic - www.piramk.fi @ Finland\n\nFaculdad de Ciências de la Information - www.upsa.es @ Spain (Salamanca)\n\nFacultat de Ciencies de la Comunicacion - www.uab.es @ Spain (Barcelona)\n\nSchool of Information and Comunication in Gruningen - www.schic.nl @ Holland\n\nWarsaw University - www.uw.edu.pl/ @ Poland\n\nCumbria College of Art and Design - www.cumbria.ac.uk @ UK\n\nUniversite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis - www.unice.fr @ France\n\nTechnikum Joanneum Gmbh - www.fh-joanneum.at @ Austria\n\nBanku Augstskola - www.lba.lv @ Lethonia\n\nIstanbul Bilgi Universitesi - www.bilgi.edu.tr @ Turkey\n\nKatholieke Hogeschool Kempen - www.khk.be @ Belgium\n\nThe only university I knew before getting interested in this programme, was Cumbria College, and many people already told me this is a good one. The problem is $. I think the life there is too expensive. I don’t know about the rest of the countries tho… :sick:\n\nLooking at that list, the only country I’ve visited is Spain, and that stays too close to where I’m living right now (Portugal). And what I want is to get far away from Portugal, just go out there for one year and study/party/have fun. The weather is something to consider too, sun is good, cold/rain is bad!\n\nOf course that studying is not the only thing I’m worried about. Partying too! Actually, the erasmus site I posted has a nice paragraph that explains why I want to do this…\n\nHave you ever wished to live and study abroad? Have you ever wanted to get to know a different culture, study at a foreign university, meet new friends, learn another language, all at the same time?\n\nThat says it all!\n\nMy university has agreements with some colleges around europe, not many, (I wished there were more) and Sabanci isn’t one of them. But I’ve heard good things about the other univeristy I posted that is also located in Turkey - Istanbul Bilgi Universitesi. Some colleagues stayed there the last year and they really liked it.\n\nThanks for the tip, ehe. About the university in Belgium - Katholieke Hogeschool Kempen - a friend told me that Kempen is not the greatest place in Belgium to study, what do you think?\n\nBy legal, do you mean cannabis or prostitution? They both are!\n\nI’ll tell you one thing… Legalize it and I’ll advertise it! cheers.\n\nThanks for the helpful tip. I’m having a hard finding an IT course at the Warsaw University website - http://www.uw.edu.pl/en/\n\nNow that was a really good helpful marvelous info. Thank you very much. Each day I’m more interested in going to Holland the next year, its going to be my 1st pick, and I’m still undecided about the rest.\n\nThanks for the replies.\n\nPS - Thanks to the mod that moved the thread\n\nHeya, I live in Latvia\n\nBanku Augstskola - www.lba.lv @ Lethonia\n\nWell, I personally go to Riga Technical University myself, but BA is a nice school, not very large though (which may be even better). The study level there is just the same as in all other universities, pretty much. My brother’s wife studied there, and she liked it. I would have studied there as well, but I got a full scholarship in Riga Technical University.\n\nYou will find cost of living in Latvia, when compared to Portugal, to be pretty damn low. I lived in Portugal for 3 and a half years, and it’s quite the difference.\n\nHowever, as the name suggests, it’s a Banking University, it does have other programmes as well, but it’s main specialization is banking. What sort of a course are you looking for?\n\nAlso, depending on the season, for a portuguese person, Latvia can be quite cold I had a friend come over here and he froze over, even though it was mere October Then again, that might just be what you want"
