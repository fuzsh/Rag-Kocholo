        "text": "FH JOANNEUM GmbH is one of the leading universities of applied sciences in Austria, with 50 bachelor and master degree programmes, some 5000 students, and over 300 partner universities across the world. Our six Departments – Applied Computer Sciences; Engineering; Building, Energy & Society; Health Studies; Media & Design; Management – provide excellent preparation for the world of work. As a university of applied sciences, FH JOANNEUM acts as a driver of innovation in research for the benefit of society. The applied research offered by FH JOANNEUM ranges from the transfer of results from basic research to innovative services and developments. This ensures a close link between research and teaching and high relevance for practical application. We see modern research as a multidisciplinary mission to be fulfilled not only within the individual institutes but also within and across the six departments.\n\nThe Sustainable Food-system Research Group has in-depth experience in mapping and assessing local food systems in Austria. We have experiences in technology road-mapping (e.g. as a tool to systematically assess the rural-urban stakeholder system of Graz and its peri-urban region to identify factors that help to enhance a sustainable food provision). In this respect, different fields for the implementation of sustainable innovations including social, economic, ecologic, and technologic innovations, have been targeted (see Berner et al., 2019). In addition, we have vast experience in the field of food engineering (i.e. product and process development). In our Food Processing Lab, we are developing food products and production processes and plant engineering."
