        "text": "Is this program for me?\n\nThe FH Joanneum (FHJ) exchange program was developed by GVSU's Padnos College of Engineering and Computing. Students studying in Computing and Information Systems may take courses in English at FH Joanneum during the Winter semester..While the academic program is located on the campus of Kapfenberg, it is recommended that students plan to live in the city of Graz in order to have access to the amenities of a larger city. The Kapfenberg campus is an easy 40 minute train ride from the city of Graz. Students can expect to take 3 CIS courses during the semester as well as a language and a culture course. The language and culture courses are typically offered on the Graz campus which will allow students to easily connect with other international students studying at FH Joanneum. This program requires students to exercise a high degree of independence, and is highly recommended for students looking for a full immersion experience.\n\nGraz, with a population of 301,368, is the second-largest city in Austria after Vienna. Graz has a long tradition as a student city: its six universities have more than 44,000 students. Its \"Old Town\" is one of the best-preserved city centers in Central Europe. Politically and culturally, Graz was for centuries very important for Slovinia, and still remains influential. In 1999, Graz was added to the UNESCO list of World Cultural Heritage Sites, and the site was extended in 2010 by Schloss Eggenberg. Graz was sole Cultural Capital of Europe for 2003 and got the title of a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\nStudents will take all of their CIS courses on the Kapfenberg campus which is a 40 minute train ride from the city of Graz. Students will commute to the Kapfenberg campus for weekend classes.\n\nHost University Homepage"
