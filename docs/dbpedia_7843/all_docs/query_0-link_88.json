        "text": "Our University is only 25 years old, but it keeps a traditional spirit starting with its Name. FH Joanneum was named after Archduke Johann of Austria (1782-1859), who was one of the most innovative figures of that time and who made a number of innovations, many of which still impact our life here in Styria. In line with this spirit FHJ offers students to “study their dreams” in a broad spectrum of modern educational programs- from engineering, over media & design, to health studies. The practice-specific courses are designed with a view to meeting current international, social and technological challenges, with special attention to interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nThe Department of Health Studies combines a client-oriented approach with innovative research. The bachelor’s degree program “Physiotherapy” is provided as a full-time program with 180 ECTS, for 6 semesters. The bachelor’s degree program “Health Care and Nursing” was established in 2016. It provides modern nursing education through tertiary education and a comprehensive curriculum. Nearly 300 Graduates in Nursing per year are qualified for their advanced roles in health care, allowing them to care for patients in various settings. A high priority in both departments is given to research activities which enable adapting to the changing dynamics in society, technology and health care. Research areas are related to evidence-based innovative diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, health services, and innovative training concepts for therapy-, health promotion- and prevention- and patient education strategies."
