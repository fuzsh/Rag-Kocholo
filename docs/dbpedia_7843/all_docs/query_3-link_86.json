        "text": "Grants within Europe through Erasmus+\n\nIf all requirements are met, students can receive an ERASMUS+ grant (subject to budgetary possibilities) for studying abroad. In addition to the monthly grant, the grant can also include so-called Top Up’s for “Green Travel” or “Fewer Opportunities”. You can find more information about the Top Up’s under Fewer Opportunities & Green Travel.\n\nThe funding amounts for the individual country groups and the listing of the Top Up’s are visible in the following document. The maximum funding period for mobilities within Europe is 6 months. Mobilities to home countries cannot be funded.\n\nGrants outside Europe through ERASMUS+\n\nAgain, all requirements must be met in order to apply for a grant outside of Europe. Only mobilities to ERASMUS+ partner universities are eligible for funding. To find out which partner universities are supported, please contact the International Relations Office. The monthly ERASMUS+ scholarship for a semester outside Europe is 700 € per month. In addition to the monthly stipend, so-called Top Up’s for “Green Travel” or “Fewer Opportunities” can be included in the stipend. For more information on Top Up’s, please see Fewer Opportunities & Green Travel.\n\nThe maximum funding period for mobilities outside of Europe is 4 months. Mobilities to home countries cannot be funded.\n\nInfo about the payment of the ERASMUS+ grant\n\nIf all requirements are met, nothing stands in the way of a successful application. Further information can be found under Application. During the application process, a so-called Grant Agreement will be drawn up. After signing this Grant Agreement between the student and the International Office, the funds will be disbursed as follows:\n\n80% of the calculated overall grant will be paid out right at the start of the mobility.\n\nThe remaining 20% of the grant, or the aliquot share resulting from the day-by-day calculation, will be paid after the completion of the stay abroad and after uploading the confirmation of stay or the Transcript of Records (if it contains exact dates of stay) with original signature Mobility Online and after completing the survey in the Beneficiary Module (BM) of the European Commission.\n\nGrants for study abroad\n\nStudy grant recipients will continue to receive the Austrian study grant plus the financial aid for their stays abroad from the Study Grant Authority on a monthly basis. The financial aid for study abroad is completely independant from the Erasmus+ scholarship. Study grant recipients must file an application for financial aid for study abroad with the Study Grant Authority.\n\nFinancial aid for study abroad may also be requested for non-Erasmus+ countries. Please contact the Study Grant Authority.\n\nThe Marshall Plan Scholarship\n\nThe scholarship is between 3,000 and 10,000 euros, depending on the course and length of the stay. Please note that FH JOANNEUM can only offer two places to Marshall Plan scholars each year and therefore not all applicants will receive a scholarship. For more information about how to apply for a Marshall Plan Foundation scholarship, please ask the international coordinator for your course or enquire at the International Office. Please note that FH JOANNEUM only makes the initial selection. A committee for the Marshall Plan Foundation selects the final scholarship recipients.\n\nOnline database grants.at\n\ngrants.at is Austria’s biggest online database for scholarships and research grants for all academic areas. Financial support options for students, graduates and researchers range from classical grants and scholarships, allowances and prizes to extensive national, European and international research support programmes. grants.at is an initiative of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research and the Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research (OeAD-GmbH)\n\nThe initiative has been expanded with financial support from the EU as part of EURAXESS – Researchers in Motion."
