        "text": "College in Graz, Austria\n\nFH JOANNEUM is one of the biggest universities of applied sciences (UAS) in Austria. It has about 5,000 students and about 750 employees.[1] The main campus is located in Graz and there are two additional locations in Kapfenberg and Bad Gleichenberg. All three are situated in the province Styria in Austria. FH JOANNEUM offers almost 70 degree programs in a variety of areas including business, technology, design, media, architecture, health and social services. The programmes are practice-oriented, project-based and interdisciplinary.\n\nFH JOANNEUM was established in 1995. In 2001 the campus in Bad Gleichenberg started to offer health related degree programmes.\n\nMain entrance Graz, Alte Poststrasse 149\n\nCampus building Graz, Eggenberger Allee 11\n\nAutomotive Engineering Labs, flat building, blue building to the left of it: Alte Poststrasse 154, Graz\n\nFH JOANNEUM building in Kapfenberg\n\nRefectory in Kapfenberg\n\nThe FH JOANNEUM offers almost 70 bachelor's and master's degree programs and postgraduate courses at six departments and 26 institutes. The six departments are:\n\nApplied computer science\n\nEngineering\n\nHealth studies\n\nBuilding, Energy & Society\n\nMedia & Design\n\nManagement\n\nIn addition to broad-based programs, there are courses with specialized focus, such as \"Energy, Transport and Environmental Management\", \"eHealth\" or \"Advanced Electronic Engineering\". Some new programs cover fields which have not yet been offered in Austria as university studies, for example, the midwifery education.\n\nOne of the largest projects with students participation is the \"joanneum racing team\". Every year, the students in \"Automotive Engineering\", \"Industrial Design\", \"Information Design\", \"Electronics & Technology Management\", \"Production Technology and Organisation\", \"Journalism & Public Relations\" and \"Physiotherapy\" construct, build and commercialize a car. The project is based in the course \"automotive engineering\" and is supported by sponsors. The car is then taken to the \"Formula Student\" part and other Formula SAE competitions. The greatest successes are the overall win at the 2006 Formula SAE Italy and the 3rd overall rankings 2007 in Hockenheim and at the Formula Student UK 2008 at Silverstone.\n\nAnother student project is the magazine \"blank\" and its companion web site that are created each year by students of \"Journalism and PR\".[2]\n\nThe participants of the courses \"Luftfahrt / Aviation\", \"Information Design\", \"Industrial Design\" and \"Vehicle Technology\" are also involved in projects in \"Green Mobility\". In practical projects they contribute new ideas and developments. They are supported by companies in the automotive industry. The development of a drone (UAVS) for civilian operations fall within the scope Green Mobility.\n\nDepartment of Applied Computer Science Department of Engineering Department of Building, Energy and Society Software Development and Digital Media Development Power electronics in the field of energy systems and mobility Resource saving urbanization; Building revitalization and building envelope IT infrastructure architectures & IT Security Civilian drones and aviation systems Energy efficiency in industry, building and Local Area Healthcare and computer science Total vehicle technology in calculation and testing Sustainable transport planning, pedestrian navigation\n\nDepartment of Health Studies Department of Media and Design Department of Management Diagnosis and Treatment User Interface, data visualization, simulation International strategies and business processes Health promotion and prevention Development of Product Design Competitiveness in industry and finance Activity and exercise Content strategy, Web Literacy Health promotion and (health) tourist programs\n\nOS Education: MS IT Academy\n\nElectronic Design Center: Digital Short Range Radio, Embedded Systems, DSP\n\nCompetence node telematics Kapfenberg\n\nCompetence Center for Health Reporting\n\nNetwork Education: Cisco Networking Academy\n\nSeminars and workshops for managers (Summer Business School)\n\nHealth Perception Lab (HPL) - Laboratory for Health and Sensors\n\nEntology Net: Force Lab - Showroom and explanation Forum for IT applications\n\nPerceptual laboratory VisionSpace: 3D visualization, technology-supported learning and human-computer interaction\n\nMetabolomics Laboratory: analysis methods in biomedical research\n\nSports Science Laboratory \"SpoWiLab\" [3]\n\nLaboratory of Avionics and ATC Technology\n\nLaboratory of Flight Simulation\n\nLaboratory of Physics and facade technology\n\nLaboratory for High-Frequency and Electromagnetic Compatibility\n\nAutomotive Engineering test laboratory (accreditation body in accordance with ÖVE / ÖNORM EN ISO / IEC 17025)\n\nStreaming Studio: Web Radio Studio\n\neGovernment Service Lab: Unlocks the Citizen Card and mobile signature\n\nWeb Literacy Lab [4]\n\nThe Department of International Relations takes care of all exchange students from the university (for study or internship) going abroad (outgoings) and from abroad coming to the university (incomings). It acts as a contact point for partner universities. The department also organizes German courses (as a foreign language) and holds events and excursions.\n\nFH JOANNEUM has approximately 200 partner universities in Europe, Asia, South America, North America and Australia / New Zealand.\n\nÖH joanneum is the student union (ÖH) of FH JOANNEUM. It exists since the winter semester 2005/2006 and has since become an integrated part of the Teaching Board. By anchoring the FH student representatives in the Austrian Students' system, ÖH joanneum has become a legally established body. The activities of ÖH joanneum include representing the interests of FH JOANNEUM students at a higher level (e.g. As in the Federal Representation of Students' Union). Since autumn 2010 ÖH joanneum is also working on the magazine \"JOE\", educational issues and the organization of studies and the student life at home and abroad. The first edition was published in January 2011."
