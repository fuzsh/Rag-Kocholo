        "text": "This spirit of cooperation manifests itself in the #1 technology hotspot for climate protection & circular economy, the Green Tech Valley in the south of Austria. More than 300 companies and more than 20 research institutions work together here to make the world a little better in the truest sense of the word.\n\nEmbedded in this unique ecosystem of outstanding colleges, universities and companies - from start-ups to renowned global market leaders - FH JOANNEUM unfolds its mission: as an interdisciplinary university of applied sciences, it sees itself as a university of the future that opens up new worlds - practical, scientific and bold. Opening up new perspectives through education. Living quality, in studies, in research and in cooperation.\n\nFour key objectives are pursued in order to realise this mission: Putting students at the centre of everything we do, being regionally anchored and internationally networked, continuously optimising the portfolio and leveraging synergies, while keeping an eye on the 5D orientation in terms of content: Defossilisation, digitalisation, demography, democracy and didactics.\n\nAt the Green Utopia Award ceremony, Martin Payer, Managing Director of FH JOANNEUM , put it in a nutshell:\n\n\"As a university of the future, FH JOANNEUM is convinced that green utopias are needed to make the future of our society worth living in.\"\n\nHe continues: \"We encourage people to think ahead and conduct research into important topics such as digitalisation, health, climate change, energy and mobility. Students and lecturers at all of our institutes are therefore already tackling future topics in a practical way: the energy laboratory and mobility laboratory at FH JOANNEUM in Kapfenberg conduct research into renewable energies and forms of mobility, among other things. Environmentally friendly aviation is the focus of the Aviation degree programme in Graz, sustainable tourism at the Institute of Health and Tourism Management at FH JOANNEUM in Bad Gleichenberg. And last but not least, our Information Design students deal with green utopias when they visualise the content of the eight green research utopias of 'Green Utopia' in order to communicate them to the public.\"\n\n#schongeial - the science on offer in Austria is comparable to a richly laid buffet. You can study where you want, what you want, how much you want. You could say: all you can eat, all you can learn. That's brilliant!"
