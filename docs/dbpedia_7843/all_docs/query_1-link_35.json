        "text": "Hello,\n\nI’m an industrial designer doing the integrated product design program at TU Delft.\n\nThe course is very strong, the building (workshops, computer rooms and etc.) is amazing, and the students are usually very hard working. You have to be hard working if you want to graduate here. You can take many nice electives about different subjects.\n\nBut the most important for you is to know if the course is suitable for you. I found out too late that it’s not suitable for me. It’s really engineering oriented, so you have to be really interested in it (we have lectures and workshops about electronics and cyber physical systems for example). It’s also very methodological, we have to write a lot of reports. I also don’t like the weather here (I’m from Brazil) but since you are from norway, I think you won’t bother about this.\n\nIf you have more specific questions, let me know.\n\nAlan Niski"
