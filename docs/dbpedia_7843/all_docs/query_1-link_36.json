        "text": "As of today, it's confirmed: The UK will associate with Horizon Europe, the EU's framework program for research and innovation. This is a significant achievement for the European research hub, which I wholeheartedly welcome both in my capacity as President of Universität Hamburg and personally! Especially for the scientific metropolis of Hamburg, often referred to as \"Germany’s most British City\", with its diverse societal and economic ties to the UK, this represents a true milestone. The association plays a crucial role in the innovative strength and competitiveness of the pan-European research landscape. It also sends a powerful signal for future scientific relations and a more intensive collaboration between universities. The German U15 and the British partner association, the Russell Group of Universities will meet at Universität Hamburg next week (11th and 12th September) to discuss new opportunities for cooperation. 🇬🇧🤝🇪🇺 #ResearchingEurope #HamburgUKPartnership 🇬🇧🤝🇩🇪 #HorizonEurope #UniHamburgInnovation https://lnkd.in/e_5URCZF\n\nAs we mark another milestone in the journey of Maastricht University, I am inspired to reflect on the essence of our institution's commitment to excellence and innovation. On our Dies Natalis, we not only celebrate our rich history but also look forward to a future filled with boundless possibilities. This year, our focus resonates with the powerful quote: \"Talent Unlimited: The Labour We Need, The Potential We Can't Waste.\" In the realm of employer branding, these words echo the very core of our mission. At Maastricht University, we understand that true progress is fueled by the unlimited potential within each individual. Our commitment to cultivating talent goes hand in hand with recognizing the essential role that labor plays in driving innovation and success. As we strive to be at the forefront of education and research, we embrace the diversity of talents that make up our community. It's not just about filling positions; it's about unlocking the unique capabilities that each person brings to the table. Together, we create a dynamic and inclusive environment where innovation thrives. #MaastrichtUniversity #DiesNatalis #EmployerBranding #TalentUnlimited #Innovation #PotentialUnleashed\n\nIt's time to come back formerly innovative driven Campus assembling law and economics education. Everthanks to be some time part of it on my university journey. What it's coming on my mind navigating the AI Revolution in Higher Education The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence challenges universities to evolve. Survival in this competitive landscape hinges on transforming higher education into collaborative, lifelong learning journeys, facilitated by AI. Universities who wants to transform must: 💥 Personalize education with AI while maintaining human mentorship. 💥 Break barriers to make knowledge accessible beyond traditional classrooms. 💥 Foster continuous learning, offering flexible and practical learning modules. 💥 Encourage innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration and experiential learning. In an age where AI disseminates knowledge at unprecedented rates, universities that adapt, fostering a shared educational narrative, will thrive. Is your ex alma mater keeping up with the pace of NEW INTELLIGENCE called sprunginnovation? #HigherEducation #AI #FutureOfLearning #Innovation #AI #Leipzig #Bayreuth #sprunginnovation Jörg Waniek Universität Bayreuth\n\nTU Chemnitz becomes a European University University alliance \"Across - The European University for Cross-Border Knowledge Sharing\" of ten universities from ten countries is funded by the European Union with 14.4 million euros - Technische Universität Chemnitz is consortium leader As part of this alliance, Chemnitz University of Technology, together with nine partner universities at a total of ten European locations close to borders, aims to develop a unique university space that addresses the challenges, but above all the opportunities of living, learning and working in so-called \"cross-border regions\". In four of these regions, the partners bring together around 100,000 students and 10,000 employees. Ideas developed within the framework of Across Alliance for the challenges in these regions show exemplary solutions for comparable areas within the #EU, in which over 200 million Europeans live. https://lnkd.in/ernVq8Gp\n\n🌟 Curious about the projects ICES currently supports? Interested in the latest research plans at Europa-Universität Flensburg? In this section, we keep you updated on our members' #research and invite you to delve deeper into the world of European research. Whether you're an affiliated researcher or simply passionate about European Studies, here's something for everyone! This week, we're highlighting 'Sensing ‘race’, whiteness and the nation: sonic and olfactory experiments through text and spaces of Berlin'. Led by Prof. Christine Barwick-Gross and Dr. Christy's Kulz, this project spans one year and five months and is funded by VolkswagenStiftung. 🔍 👉 \"This project will open new research frontiers in cultural studies by exploring how 'race' is produced through the sonic, olfactory and spatial by mobilising a novel methodological approach. Space and the senses are seldom explicitly employed to understand how processes of racialisation and the concomitant struggle to belong operates; omitting these affective dimensions of boundary drawing limits how we can theorise and understand these phenomena. This exploratory project interdisciplinary combines geographical, urban, postcolonial and migration studies and methods to a.) spatialise key texts in the German critical 'race' and whiteness studies canon using interactive graphic maps that span local, national and international scales; and b.) experiment with sensory participatory walking methodologies in Berlin's Wedding district to highlight the role of the spatial, sonic and olfactory in 'race'-making processes. This will reveal innovative ways to approach and theorise racialisation, whiteness and multiculture in Germany\".

Stay tuned for more exciting updates! 🌟 #EuropeanStudies #ResearchProjects #InterdisciplinaryStudies #ICESResearch\n\nFrom Germany: The three Rectors of the University Alliance Ruhr (Ruhr-Universität Bochum Bochum, Universität Duisburg-Essen, and Technische Universität Dortmund) committed themselves to the values of the MCU. They say: “In Germany, we often take the independence and inseparability of fact-based research and teaching, open dialogue and free from political influence and economic interests, for granted. But in other parts of the world, freedom of research and teaching is fiercely contested. With the Magna Charta Universitatum, renewed in 2020, we accept the responsibility to promote university values and address global challenges through our research in order to develop solutions to preserve the planet. Health, prosperity, and intellectual enlightenment are fundamental values that universities contribute to realizing through their global knowledge networks.” Full piece here: https://lnkd.in/dGsb_9eW #universityvalues #academicfreedom\n\n🌐 We celebrate 50 years of scientific and technical cooperation between Germany and India! 🎉 On 21 and 22 May 2024 we will celebrate this milestone in Darmstadt. As DLR Projektträger, we are supporting the BMBF in organising a scientific exchange programme supplementing the celebratory event which is hosted by GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research / FAIR. 🔬The aim is to highlight the remarkable journey of partnership and to showcase the progress of FAIR, an international accelerator center for research with antiprotons and ions, a unique testimony to our joint efforts in pushing and expanding the boundaries of scientific exploration. The participants are invited to witness firsthand the innovative solutions to technical challenges and the diverse array of scientific endeavors shaping our future. 🤝 Supported by the BMBF (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung), this event aims to spotlight the achievements and diversity of our cooperation. Four thematic groups will meet at different site visits in order to discuss obstacles and collect new ideas of Indo-German Cooperation in Science and Technology. Let's celebrate the past, present, and future of Indo-German cooperation in science and technology with engaging discussions, including a policy talk featuring Dr. Jens Brandenburg, Parliamentary State Secretary at the BMBF, and esteemed representatives from our Indian partner. 🌟 #IndoGermanSTC50 #ScienceDiplomacy #ResearchPartnership\n\nHave you ever been subject to science hostility? Research shows you are more likely to have been exposed to hostility than not, especially online. Astonishingly, for many, the attacks came from inside academia as often as outside. If you are in Germany and would like to understand how you can preferably avoid, but if not, how to deal with science hostility, consider signing up for our summer school on resilience to science hostility. Details in the linked post. See you there!"
