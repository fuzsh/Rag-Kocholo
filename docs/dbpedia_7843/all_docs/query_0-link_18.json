Our graduates have an outstanding reputation with employers.\n\nWe are involved in national and international R&D in all the subject areas we cover, and boast outstanding staff and a high level of specialist expertise in selected cutting-edge fields.\n\nAs an application-oriented university, we offer our students a practice-oriented education on a full-time or part-time basis, and cooperative programmes with an interdisciplinary focus. We combine academic education with practical training. The range of programmes we offer is designed with a view to meeting current international, commercial and technological challenges and the needs of industry, and with a focus on the future employability of our graduates.\n\nWe provide our students with the infrastructure they require for an excellent education, and implement new methods of teaching and learning, including the use of new media. In view of the importance of life-long learning, we offer a range of postgraduate programmes and tailored continuing education courses designed to meet the needs of our internal and external stakeholders.\n\nOur applied research and development activities ensure the high quality of our teaching. We are drivers of innovation, working in cooperation with partners in education and business. We contribute to making Styria attractive as a location for industry and as a place to live, and are firmly anchored in the region, in Graz, Kapfenberg and Bad Gleichenberg.\n\nOur teaching and research practice reflects our responsibility to ensure that students gain a valuable education and a comprehensive set of skills. At FH JOANNEUM teaching and research is based on the principle of good scientific practice. We regard the university’s autonomy as an essential basis for our industrial, technological and social developments in teaching and research.\n\nWe encourage entrepreneurial thinking and action, as well as pleasure in creativity and innovation. We are actively involved in the transfer of knowledge between university, research, industry and society. With our special focus on the generation and transfer of knowledge, we see ourselves as an organisation of experts and are aware of our qualities. As experts we provide complex and client-specific services in research and teaching. The large degree of autonomy we enjoy in decision-making plays a significant role in our success.\n\nOur university supports cultural diversity, an international outlook and an interdisciplinary approach – we believe diversity is enriching. We take responsibility for the common good and social development. We consider it our duty to use resources sustainably.\n\nOur organisation is moving away from paper. We are putting lean structures and fast processes in place to improve our efficiency. We are using and testing state-of-the-art media in interacting with our partners.\n\nResearch and teaching at the Degree Programmes and Institutes is structured in six Departments. Our thematic focus is on future career profiles and topics from society and business. We measure ourselves by international standards, promote interdisciplinary and cross-departmental cooperation and have established close networks with our partners and the scientific community.\n\nThe FH JOANNEUM university library is designed to support learning, teaching and research. It is open to everyone interested in scientific literature and information.\n\nWe work in interdisciplinary teams to develop IT solutions which incorporate all the various technological, economic, legal and societal aspects at multimedia level.
