        "text": "Fulbright Austria offers up to 24 awards, including two research awards and 22 teaching awards with research options. The great majority of awards are anchored at specific Austrian institutions and correspondingly dedicated to host institutions' specific fields of interest, ranging from natural and life sciences, engineering, and business and economics to the social sciences, arts, and humanities. Fulbright Austria hosts two US scholar cohorts per year, with the majority of scholars arriving in spring.\n\nIn recent years, Austria has established itself as one of the top-ten destinations for Fulbright US Scholars, a success which is largely due to the excellent partnerships the Austrian Fulbright commission has built with institutions across the country. As enthusiastic supporters of the Fulbright program, Austrian institutions are excited to welcome US scholars to their campuses and to expand their professional networks.\n\nPlease note that Austrian institutions will be on summer break from July 1 until September 30. If you contact faculty and staff, please consider that turnaround times will potentially be longer as of early July.\n\nFulbright Austria (the Austrian-American Educational Commission) evaluates proposals in terms of their potential to fulfill the program's mandate of promoting mutual understanding between the peoples of Austria and the United States. Proposals for flexible combinations of teaching and research will be evaluated for their scholarly excellence, comparative approaches, bilateral relevance and potential for establishing or enhancing institutional relationships. As a rule, the quality of an applicant's proposal is more important to the Austrian-American Educational Commission than the academic rank of the applicant.\n\nFulbright Austria expects applicants to take all possible measures to avoid plagiarism. For resources on plagiarism, please visit these external resources:\n\n• The Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research’s Best Practice Guide for Research Integrity and Ethics\n\n• The Austrian Agency for Research Integrity’s website\n\nGrantees to Austria are responsible for costs related to obtaining a visa in the US.\n\nIn country, the first grant payment will be disbursed at the start of the grantee's assignment, pending submission of the Austrian bank information form. Bank processing times for the first grant payment may take up to two weeks from the date of submission. Grantees should be prepared to cover their own expenses for this period. No dependent support is available.\n\nFor an estimated overview of the cost of living in Austria, please visit: https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/country/austria.\n\nFor further information on life in Austria, please visit the U.S. Embassy Vienna's website and the Austrian Embassy Washington's website."
