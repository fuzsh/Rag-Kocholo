        "text": "The population reached nearly 370,000\n\nBetween the last two censuses (held in 2011 and 2021), the population of Leicester increased by 11.7%, from around 329,800 in 2011 to around 368,600 in 2021.\n\nThe population here increased by a greater percentage than the overall population of the East Midlands (7.7%), and by a greater percentage than the overall population of England (up 6.6% since the 2011 Census).\n\nIn 2021, Leicester was home to around 35.9 people per football pitch-sized piece of land, compared with 32.1 in 2011. This area was the most densely populated local authority area across the East Midlands.\n\nThis article generally uses percentages to enable comparisons over time and between areas. The percentage point change is also used to show the difference between the 2011 and 2021 percentages.\n\nPopulation growth was higher in Leicester than across the East Midlands\n\nPercentage population change, Leicester and surrounding areas, 2011 Census to Census 2021\n\nEngland ▲6.6% East Midlands ▲7.7% Leicester ▲11.7% Source: Office for National Statistics – 2011 Census and Census 2021\n\nSave as image (PNG <200KB) | Download the data (CSV <100KB) |\n\nMedian age increased\n\nBetween the last two censuses, the average (median) age of Leicester increased by two years, from 31 to 33 years of age.\n\nThis area had the joint second-lowest average (median) age in the East Midlands (alongside Lincoln and behind Nottingham ) and a lower average (median) age than England (40 years).\n\nThe median age is the age of the person in the middle of the group, meaning that one half of the group is younger than that person and the other half is older.\n\nThe number of people aged 35 to 49 years rose by just over 11,300 (an increase of 18.0%), while the number of residents aged 4 years and under fell by around 2,000 (8.2% decrease).\n\nThe share of residents aged between 35 and 49 years increased by 1.1 percentage points between 2011 and 2021\n\nFamily in Leicester\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple with dependent children increased in Leicester, but fell across the East Midlands.\n\nIn Leicester, the percentage of households including a couple with dependent children rose from 19.5% in 2011 to 21.3% in 2021. During the same period, the regional percentage fell from 19.7% to 18.8%.\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple without children in Leicester fell from 12.9% to 11.7%, while the percentage of households including a couple with only non-dependent children increased from 6.4% to 7.3%.\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple with dependent children in Leicester increased by 1.8 percentage points\n\nMarriage and civil partnership in Leicester\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were married (or in a civil partnership) increased here, but fell across the East Midlands.\n\nIn Leicester, the percentage that said they were married (or in a civil partnership) rose from 42.5% in 2011 to 43.4% in 2021. During the same period, the regional percentage fell from 48.7% to 45.8%.\n\nThe percentage of adults who had never married or registered a civil partnership in Leicester increased from 41.5% to 43.1%, while the percentage of adults who had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership decreased from 7.1% to 6.5%.\n\nThese figures include same-sex marriages and opposite-sex civil partnerships in 2021, neither of which were legally recognised in England and Wales in 2011. Same-sex marriages have been legally recognised in England and Wales since 2014 and opposite-sex civil partnerships have been recognised since 2019.\n\nThe percentage of adults who were married or in a civil partnership in Leicester increased by 0.8 percentage points\n\nEmployment in Leicester\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed increased in this area, but fell across the East Midlands.\n\nIn Leicester, the percentage who were employed rose from 49.4% in 2011 to 50.4% in 2021. During the same period, the regional percentage fell from 56.1% to 55.1%.\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were unemployed (excluding full-time students) in Leicester fell from 5.8% to 3.6%, while the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were retired (economically inactive) decreased from 15.0% to 13.4%.\n\nCensus 2021 took place during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a period of rapid and unparalleled change; the national lockdown, associated guidance and furlough measures will have affected the labour market and our ability to measure it.\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were employed (excluding full-time students) in Leicester increased by 1.0 percentage points\n\nFewer adults working long hours\n\nIn 2021, 6.1% of Leicester residents aged 16 years and over and in employment said they worked over 49 hours per week. This figure decreased from 8.2% in 2011.\n\nThe percentage who said they worked 15 hours or less per week remained at 10.7%, while the percentage of adults in employment working 31 to 48 hours per week increased from 58.6% to 59.5%.\n\nThis area had the country's lowest percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked over 49 hours per week. Barrow-in-Furness had England's next-lowest percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked over 49 hours per week (6.6%), while City of London had the country's highest percentage (31.9%).\n\nWorking hours may have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThe percentage of adults in employment who worked 49 hours or more in Leicester decreased by 2.1 percentage points\n\nNational identity in Leicester\n\nLeicester saw England's joint second-largest percentage-point rise (alongside Boston ) in the proportion of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK (from 17.2% in 2011 to 24.1% in 2021).\n\nEngland's largest increase in the percentage of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK occurred in City of London (from 25.4% to 33.1%).\n\nBecause of its small size, comparisons to City of London should be made with caution.\n\nIn Census 2021, “British” was moved to the top response option and this may have influenced how people described their national identity. For further information, please see our quality report.\n\nThe percentage of people who did not identify with at least one UK national identity in Leicester increased by 6.9 percentage points\n\nLeicester residents' country of birth\n\nIn the latest census, around 213,600 Leicester residents said they were born in England. This represented 57.9% of the local population. The figure has decreased from around 214,400 in 2011, which at the time represented 65.0% of Leicester's population.\n\nIndia was the next most represented, with around 59,800 Leicester residents reporting this country of birth (16.2%). This figure was up from just over 37,200 in 2011, which at the time represented 11.3% of the population of Leicester.\n\nThe number of Leicester residents born in South and Eastern African countries (other than Kenya, Somalia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) rose from just under 12,400 in 2011 (3.8% of the local population) to around 12,700 in 2021 (3.4%).\n\nIn 2021, 57.9% of Leicester residents reported their country of birth as England\n\nRise in private renting\n\nLeicester saw the East Midlands' largest percentage-point rise in the proportion of privately-rented homes (from 22.7% in 2011 to 29.4% in 2021).\n\nLincoln saw the East Midlands' next largest increase in the percentage of privately-rented homes (from 21.0% in 2011 to 27.2% in 2021).\n\nEvery local authority area across the East Midlands saw a rise in the percentage of privately-rented homes, as the regional percentage grew from 14.9% to 18.7%.\n\nPrivate renting in Leicester increased by 6.6 percentage points\n\nDisability in Leicester\n\nLeicester saw the East Midlands' second-largest percentage-point fall in the proportion of residents who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot (from 11.5% in 2011 to 8.8% in 2021). These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nAcross the region, only Bolsover saw a greater fall in the proportion of residents who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot (from 13.5% to 10.6%).\n\nEvery local authority area across the East Midlands saw a fall in the proportion of residents who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot, as the regional proportion fell from 9.3% to 7.7%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived their health status and activity limitations, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people who were identified as being disabled and limited a lot in Leicester decreased by 2.7 percentage points\n\nReligion in Leicester\n\nIn 2021, 23.5% of Leicester residents described themselves as Muslim, up from 18.6% in 2011. The rise of 4.8 percentage points was the largest increase of all broad religious groups in Leicester. Because the census question about religious affiliation is voluntary and has varying response rates, caution is needed when comparing figures between different areas or between censuses.\n\nAcross the East Midlands, the percentage of residents who described themselves as Muslim increased from 3.1% to 4.3%, while across England the percentage increased from 5.0% to 6.7%.\n\nIn 2021, 24.7% of people in Leicester described themselves as Christian (down from 32.4%), while 23.0% reported having \"No religion\" (up from 22.8% the decade before).\n\nThere are many factors that can cause changes to the religious profile of an area, such as a changing age structure or residents relocating for work or education. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses. Religious affiliation is the religion with which someone connects or identifies, rather than their beliefs or religious practice.\n\nRead the bulletin Religion, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 23.5% of usual residents in Leicester described themselves as Muslim\n\nHealth in Leicester\n\nIn 2021, 42.8% of Leicester residents described their health as \"very good\", increasing from 38.2% in 2011. Those describing their health as \"good\" fell from 36.3% to 34.7%. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nThe proportion of Leicester residents describing their health as \"very bad\" decreased from 2.0% to 1.6%, while those describing their health as \"bad\" fell from 6.1% to 5.2%.\n\nThese data reflect people’s own opinions in describing their overall health on a five point scale, from very good to very bad.\n\nCensus 2021 was conducted during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and rated their health, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nThe percentage of people in very good health in Leicester increased by 4.6 percentage points\n\nEthnic groups in Leicester\n\nIn 2021, 43.4% of Leicester residents identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category, up from 37.1% in 2011. The 6.3 percentage-point change was the largest increase among high-level ethnic groups in this area.\n\nAcross the East Midlands, the percentage of people from the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" ethnic group increased from 6.5% to 8.0%, while across England the percentage increased from 7.8% to 9.6%.\n\nIn 2021, 40.9% of people in Leicester identified their ethnic group within the \"White\" category (compared with 50.5% in 2011), while 7.8% identified their ethnic group within the \"Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African\" category (compared with 6.2% the previous decade).\n\nThe percentage of people who identified their ethnic group within the \"Other\" category (\"Arab\" or \"Any other ethnic group\") increased from 2.6% in 2011 to 4.1% in 2021.\n\nThere are many factors that may be contributing to the changing ethnic composition of England and Wales, such as differing patterns of ageing, fertility, mortality, and migration. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses.\n\nRead the bulletin Ethnic group, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 43.4% of usual residents in Leicester identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category\n\nUnpaid care in Leicester\n\nIn 2021, 3.4% of Leicester residents (aged five years and over) reported providing up to 19 hours of unpaid care each week. This figure decreased from 6.2% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nIn 2021, just over 1 in 50 people (2.2%) reported providing between 20 and 49 hours of unpaid care each week, compared with 2.0% in 2011. The proportion of Leicester residents (aged five years and over) that provided at least 50 hours of weekly unpaid care decreased from 3.2% to 3.0%.\n\nThis area had the region’s lowest proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care. Boston had the East Midlands' next lowest proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care (3.8%), while Gedling had the region's highest proportion (5.6%).\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and managed their provision of unpaid care, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care in Leicester decreased by 2.8 percentage points\n\nAbout the data\n\nCensus data are adjusted to reflect estimated non-response so that the published results relate to the entire usually resident population as it was on Census Day (21 March 2021).\n\nThose respondents who were on furlough because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were asked to classify themselves as \"temporarily away from work\" to ensure they remained in the economically active population.\n\nStudents are counted as usually resident at their term-time address even if they were not physically present there on Census Day.\n\nThe questions relating to disability differed slightly between 2011 and 2021 to ensure that data were more closely aligned with the definition of disability in the Equality Act (2010). There was also a change to question wording for unpaid care, for more information read the health, disability and unpaid care quality information.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout the health, disability and unpaid care sections. They allow for fairer comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure. The 2013 European Standard Population is used to standardise proportions.\n\nPercentages and percentage point changes have been individually rounded to one decimal place. This means they may not sum exactly.\n\nTell us what you think about this publication by answering a few questions.\n\nDownload the data used in this article\n\nxlsx (1.5 MB)\n\nAbout these articles\n\nThere is an article like this for every local authority district in England and Wales.
