        "text": "At the heart of the East Midlands is Leicester, a gorgeous city that millions of people visit every year. Whether looking for a relaxing weekend, a few weeks in a new city, or a permanent relocation, Leicester has almost everything you need.\n\nThe city is conveniently located—not too far from other major cities, such as Birmingham and Nottingham, and within driving distance of London. You will also experience a strong sense of community as you walk through Leicester’s streets, with major housing areas such as Clarendon Park and Westcotes providing a satisfactory home to thousands of people.\n\nDuring your first visit to Leicester, you will undoubtedly want to visit all the iconic local landmarks and try sensational food. But if you’re planning on staying for a longer time, getting a clear sense of smaller details such as amenities, crime rate, population, developments, and more will make it easier to prepare.\n\nSo, keep reading our page below for a comprehensive area guide on the magnificent city of Leicester.\n\nLeicester Amenities\n\nFrom hotels to train stations, swimming pools to shopping centres and everywhere in between, whatever type of amenity you are looking for in Leicester undoubtedly has it somewhere.\n\nThe largest shopping centres in the city, Highcross and Haymarket, have public restrooms, restaurants, Cafes, and a car park. You can also use free Wi-Fi and benches throughout the area.\n\nThere are lots of parks dotted around Leicester, including:\n\nAbbey Park\n\nWestern Park\n\nVictoria Park\n\nCastle Park\n\nMuseum Square Park\n\nWatermead Country Park\n\nSeveral of these parks have football pitches, rugby pitches, tennis courts and more for you to enjoy.\n\nThe city has three major hospitals: Leicester General Hospital, Leicester Royal Infirmary, and Glenfield Hospital. There are also private hospitals elsewhere for you to sign up to, if you choose. Lastly, if you need to see a general practitioner, you can find information centres that will point you to the nearest doctor’s surgery.\n\nIf you’d like information about selling your house fast in Leicester, get in touch today.\n\nLeicester Population\n\nLeicester’s population was 368,600 at the most recent census, an increase of approximately 38,700 (11.7%) from ten years earlier. This ranks the city above other major urban areas around the U.K., such as Edinburgh, Bournemouth, Cardiff, and Coventry.\n\nThe average age of people living in Leicester has gone up by around two years—from 31 to 33—during the past decade. Some economists have argued that this is a result of the rising house prices in the city centre, which have nearly doubled during the past decade.\n\nAs the population has grown in Leicester, there has also been more variation in the ethnicities and religions of those living there. According to recent figures, the religious beliefs of people in Leicester are separated as follows:\n\nChristian: 24.7%\n\nMuslim: 23.5%\n\nAtheist: 23%\n\nHindu: 17.9%\n\nSikh: 4.5%\n\nAs these numbers demonstrate, Leicester has a large Muslim and Hindu community, and more mosques and temples have appeared throughout the city to accommodate this. The Leicester Islamic Centre is on Conduit Street, for example, and the Shree Hindu Temple and Community Centre is on St Barnabas Road.\n\nHealth seems to be improving throughout the city’s population, with 42.8% of residents describing their health as ‘very good’ in the latest census. This is a considerable improvement in the percentage of people who made this statement ten years earlier.\n\nIf you’d like information about selling your house fast in Leicester, get in touch today.\n\nLeicester’s developments\n\nWith Leicester’s population constantly growing and more businesses setting up offices in the city every year, it is no surprise that the city council is committed to developing infrastructure, commercial offices and residential apartments.\n\nA few new developments are in the works: a new school in Hinckley called ‘Normandy Way School’, a new surgery unit at Leicester General Hospital, and a Solar Farm at Poole Farm, Quorn.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the roads and neighbourhoods that have recently seen new houses being built include:\n\nGartree Road\n\nLubbesthorpe\n\nFrog Island\n\nOverstone Park, Market Harborough\n\nIn other news, Leicester City F.C.’s King Power Stadium has had an application approved to increase its capacity by 8,000 people. This demonstrates not only the club’s growing fanbase but also the overall need to develop in Leicester due to the rising population.\n\nLow-carbon industrial and commercial units are also being developed on the site of former council offices, which shows the city council’s commitment to attracting more businesses to Leicester.\n\nIf you’d like information about selling your house fast in Leicester, get in touch today.\n\nLeicester’s crime rate\n\nCrime in Leicester is relatively high compared to other major towns in the county. That said, there is evidence that the police and local authorities are cracking down on these challenges.\n\nFirstly, most crime types have decreased in quantity compared to one year ago. Many people who live in the city also describe themselves as feeling safe.\n\nOn the other hand, Leicester remains above the national crime average in some of the following areas:\n\nCriminal damage and arson\n\nPublic order crime\n\nDrugs\n\nBurglary\n\nBicycle theft\n\nPossession of weapons\n\nSome areas are safer than others, and this is a factor that people take into account when they move to Leicester. For example, areas in the suburbs, such as Blaby and Harborough, have significantly lower crime levels than the county’s average. Meanwhile, the centre of the city, unsurprisingly, has very high levels of crime.\n\nIf you’d like information about selling your house fast in Leicester, get in touch today.\n\nLeicester job opportunities\n\nFigures show that employment has slowly increased in Leicester over the past ten years, which is a testament to the improvement in job opportunities in the city. However, employment levels are still far below the U.K. average.\n\nMany major organisations have committed to expanding their bases in Leicester, such as IBM, Hastings Direct, Octopus Energy, Mattioli Woods and PPL PRS. Meanwhile, the largest industries in the city are:\n\nHuman Health And Social Work Activities (18.3%)\n\nWholesale And Retail Trade; Repair Of Motor Vehicles And Motorcycles (13.7%)\n\nAdministrative And Support Service Activities (13.1%)\n\nManufacturing (12%)\n\nEducation (11.4%)\n\nAll the evidence suggests that Leicester is also a great city for people who want to be self-employed. As a percentage of the overall economy, there is a higher proportion of medium and large organisations in Leicester than in the East Midlands.\n\nLocal initiatives designed to encourage innovation in the business world include the ‘Innovation Hub’ at the University of Leicester and the Leicestershire Innovation Festival, which is due to become an annual event.\n\nIf you’d like information about selling your house fast in Leicester, get in touch today.\n\nLeicester broadband speed\n\nLeicester ranks slightly above the national average regarding broadband speed, with the LE1 postcode being specifically identified on some comparison websites as an area with high speed.\n\nAlmost all the major providers operate in the city, and you can contact them for price and speed quotations on the best deals available. Virgin Media, B.T. and TalkTalk are historically the three most popular providers in the city. You can speak to these companies directly about fibre-optic options.\n\nDespite this, there are parts of the city where connections are lacking, with households around the hospital and the National Space Centre previously experiencing problems.\n\nIf you’d like information about selling your house fast in Leicester, get in touch today.\n\nLeicester transport links\n\nNo matter your age, occupation or lifestyle, it always makes your life easier if the city you’re living in has excellent transport connections.

Plenty of taxi companies operate in this part of town, and they can take you almost anywhere.\n\nIf you are interested in cycling and walking during your visit to Leicester, the city council is committed to making this easier. Cycling maps can be found online for the entirety of Leicester, and more pedestrian crossings are being implemented at several spots around town so that walking becomes easier and safer for the thousands of people who do it daily.\n\nLeicester has an aerodrome in the east of the city, although it is primarily used by private aircraft and does not offer journeys to the public.\n\nIf you’d like information about selling your house fast in Leicester, get in touch today.\n\nWhat to see in Leicester\n\nIf you want to see all the beautiful things Leicester has to offer, you have come to the right place.
