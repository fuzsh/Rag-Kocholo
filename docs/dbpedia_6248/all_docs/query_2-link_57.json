        "text": "Choosing the perfect place to call home is an important decision. It could be the difference between feeling well-connected to the local community or feeling lonely. In this article, we’ll take a look at where to live in Leicester. Here, we’ll explore different areas that cater to different needs, including personal interests and budgets.\n\nThe city of Leicester is home to around 500,000 residents, split into 37 diverse neighbourhoods. Each area has its own pros and cons, but ultimately is still home to many people who call it home. Where is a good place to live in Leicester? Leicester is very diverse, so finding an area that aligns with your personal interests is really important.\n\nHowever, some of the top areas to consider include:\n\nClarendon Park\n\nClarendon Park is a popular residential area. The unique charm of the area is characterised by the style of housing, which features a mix of Victorian and Edwardian styles. There are a few cafes in the area, and the large Victoria Park is a short walk away. Additionally, the city centre is only 2.5 miles away, which provides convenient access.\n\nStoneygate\n\nStoneygate is an affluent and desirable neighbourhood of Leicester. It is characterised by the tree-lined streets and elegant properties that make up the area. Again, the area is only 2.5 miles away from the city centre, which is a short 10-minute journey. However, the local area has enough amenities for day-to-day needs.\n\nKnighton\n\nKnighton is another great place to live in Leicester. It is quite a peaceful suburb but still provides great transport links and a strong community. Like the other two areas, it is only a 10-minute car journey from the city centre.\n\nWhere to live in Leicester for students?\n\nLeicester is home to two world-renowned universities: De Montfort University and the University of Leicester. As such, it draws in students from across the country and globally at large. Many students will look for areas to live to be near other students while being close enough to the university. If you’re a student, consider areas such as:\n\nClarendon Park\n\nLocated near the University of Leicester, the area offers a peaceful place to live. Given that it is only a 12-minute walk from the university campus, it’s a great choice.\n\nHighfields\n\nSituated close to both universities, Highfields offers a mix of student accommodation and rental properties, with easy access to campus facilities and city amenities. It’s another great choice to get the best of both worlds.\n\nWhere to live in Leicester for families?\n\nLiving in a big city can make raising a family seem like a difficult task. It’s hard to find an area that combines safety and low crime rates with easy access to city amenities. However, there are a few great options in Leicester. Consider the following:\n\nOadby\n\nOadby is a town in its own right but is still located only 15 minutes away from Leicester city centre, with a distance of 4 miles. There are multiple primary schools in the area and two high schools with easy access. This allows great access to amenities while still providing a reasonable distance away from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nWhere to live in Leicester for religious communities?\n\nLeicester is home to a very diverse population. There are many who practise different religions, and having access to religious facilities can be important for a sense of community. Take a look at the following:\n\nStoneygate\n\nStoneygate is home to the Stoneygate Baptist Church and an Islamic Academy, which ensures the area can cater to many. For those of other faiths, there are great transport links that provide easy access to other sites of religious worship.\n\nBelgrave\n\nThere are multiple temples and ethnic cuisines located in Belgrave. This allows the area to cater to the large Hindu population who live in the area.\n\nEvington\n\nEvington is known for its diverse places of worship and caters to many from different faith backgrounds. There are multiple mosques, gurdwaras, and churches catering to the various religious communities that live in the area.\n\nWhere to live in Leicester for professionals?\n\nProfessionals working in Leicester need two things: access to work and the ability to network. For that reason, there’s only one place that’s suitable: the City Centre. Here, you’ll be able to network to your heart’s content, as other professionals will also be drawn to the heart of the city. Additionally, due to the great transport links, you’ll be able to get to where you need to be quickly and efficiently.
