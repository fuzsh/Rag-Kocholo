        "text": "The United Kingdom is made up of four constituent countries -- England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, so unsurprisingly, this area has one of the largest populations in the world. Each country has its own capital, while London serves as both the capital of England and the United Kingdom as a whole. London's population makes it by far the largest city in the United Kingdom, with an estimated population of over 9.4 million. The second largest city in the UK - Birmingham - has a population of 1.1 million. Seventy-five additional cities have populations of over 100,000, while almost 900 cities have populations that fall within 10,000 and 100,000 residents, making it easy to see why this is easily one of the world's most populated countries.\n\nThe vast majority of the United Kingdom's residents live within urban areas and cities. This has been a trend throughout several decades, as much of the country is developed and natives and expatriates travel to the larger, busier urban areas in pursuit of opportunities. In 1960, only 22% of the population lived in rural areas. This number has declined to just 17% in 2015, which is on the lower end of rural populations when compared to other countries in the world. The United Kingdom's population growth across its cities can be attributed to many factors, including the rich culture and history, thriving economies and educational and employment opportunities across the country's various industries."
