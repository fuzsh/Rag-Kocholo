        "text": "Its importance was first recognised by the Romans and later by the Danes, who used it as a strategic stronghold to control the Midlands.\n\nSince then it has developed into a major commercial and manufacturing centre, known better for the diversity of its trade than for its dependence on a single industry.\n\nIt is also a historic meeting place. For centuries people of different races and cultures have gathered in Leicester, creating a rich and unique heritage. This diversity continues today, and continues to enrich city life."
