        "text": "Leicester officially became a city in 1919 and was given a cathedral and a bishop in 1927. The 1920s and 30s saw a large-scale programme of council house construction in and around Leicester. At the same time, slum clearance began in earnest and many slums were demolished in St Margaret’s parish.\n\nThanks to its diversified economic base and industrial strength the city was in a far better position than many other regions of the UK to withstand the ravages of the 1930s Great Depression.\n\nIn fact, in 1936 the Bureau of Statistics of the League of Nations identified Leicester as the second-richest city in Europe. It therefore became an attractive destination for refugees fleeing persecution and political turmoil across continental Europe.\n\nThe city escaped heavy bombing during the majority of the Second World War; however, on 19 November 1940, bombs were dropped on Highfield Street and Saxby Street killing 40 people.\n\nIf you were a working resident of Leicester in 1939, you’d most likely be employed in the following sectors or roles:\n\nTextile Goods and Article of Dress manufacture\n\nCommercial\n\nPersonal Services\n\nClerks and Typists\n\nToday, the most common job in Leicester is listed as 'professional', followed by working in science or in a technical role.\n\nIn 1939 the population of Leicester stood at 239,169. A significant extension of the city took place in 1935, with Leicester incorporating Evington, Humberstone, Beaumont Leys and part of Braunstone. Today its population stands at 329,839.\n\nSince 1939, health and well-being has improved considerably. Back then the average life expectancy was just 61.37 for men and 65.6 for women. Today across the county of Leicestershire, it’s 79.7 for men and 83.5 for women.\n\nFamous Leicester figures from the time include the Attenborough brothers. They were residing at the University of Leicester Campus in 1939, where their father was Principal. It was here that David Attenborough discovered his love of wildlife through sitting in on university lectures during his childhood.\n\nIn sports news from 1939, an open air boxing match between Eric Boon and Len Wickwar, held at Leicester Tigers Rugby Club, saw hundreds of spectators running for cover to escape the downpour. Local lad Wickwar was eventually knocked out by champion Boon in the ninth round.\n\nIn football, 1939 proved a bad year for Leicester City Football Club after they were relegated from the Football League First Division. The Foxes finished bottom of the table.\n\nMain image: The Jewry Wall and Roman Forum at Leicester, one of the finest monuments of Roman Britain, with St. Nicholas' Church (also partly made from Roman materials.
