T w o banks w h i c h had g i v e n notice o f g o i n g i n t o l i q u i d a t i o n under section 42 of COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY. V the act, prior to tbe date of tlie last report, have paid over to the Treasurer of tlie United States the amount of their outstanding circulation in lawful money and taken up the bonds which tliey had on deposit with the Treasurer for the security of such notes, as follows, viz : The First National Bank of Columbia, Missouri, $11,990. The First National Bank of Carondelet, Missouri, $25,500. These banks are now closed. During the past year the First National Bank of Leonardsville, New York, and the National Union Bank of Rochester, New York, have voluntarily given notice of going into liquidation as required by law. The First National Bank of Leonardsville has a— Capital of Bonds deposited Circulation The National Union Bank of Rochester has a— Capital of Bonds deposited Circulation - $50,000 50,500 45,000 8400,000 250,000 192,500 The Merchants' National Bank of Washington and the Venango National Bank of Franklin, Pennsylvania, having failed to redeem their circulating notes when presented for that purpose, have been placed in the hands of receivers as required by law. The circumstances attending the failure of these two banks were fully investigated and reported by a committee of the \"House of Representatives during the last session of Congress. The receiver of the First National Bank of Attica, New York, has brought his labors nearly to a close, and a dividend will be declared to the general creditors of the bank on or about tlie first of January, 1S67. The bonds deposited to secure its circulating notes, namely, $31,500 of six per cent, and $18,500 of five per cent, bonds, were sold at public auction in the city of New York on the 8th day of October last, in accordance with the provisions of section forty-eight of the currency act. The net amount realized from the sale was $51,556 25. Of this sum, $44,000 in lawful money was deposited with the Treasurer of the United States for the redemption of the outstanding circulation of the bank, and, under instructions of the receiver, $7,556 25 was paid into the treasury, according to the provisions of section fifty of the act for the benefit of the general creditors of the bank. The amount of outstanding circulation redeemed to October 1 was $5,320. W i t h these exceptions, the national banks throughout the United States seem to be in a sound and healthy condition, as evidenced by their quarterly reports to this office, verified by careful examinations made by agents appointed for that purpose. Their total resources on the 1st of October last were $1,525,493,960; their liabilities to the public for circulation and deposits were $1,024,274,386 ; leaving a surplus of $501,221,574 for capital and earnings, which are likewise a pledge for the payment of all debts D the public. The increase of capital, bonds, and circulation of national banks for the year ending October ! , 1866, has been as follows: Increase of capital paid in Increase in bonds deposited to secure circulation Increase of circulation issued $21,515,557 56,247,750 10l,824,69S This statement shows an increase of something more than one hundred millions of national currency; but during the same period national banks which have been converted from State banks have retired fully fifty millions of their Yin REPORT OF THE State circulation, making the actual increase in the volume of currency only about fifty millions. T o correct a misapprehension which exists in the minds of many that the entire amount of national circulation issued lias been added to the volume of currency, it may be well to take into consideration the amount of State bank circulation at a period just prior to the inauguration of the national system. The bank circulation of the United States in January, IS62, was one hundred and eighty-four millions of dollars, distributed as follows: Northern and western States 8144,000,000 Southern States - 40,000,000 Subsequent to this date no further returns were received from the southern States. Immediately following the suspension of specie payments there was an expansion of bauk note circulation, which reached, in January, 1S63, in the northern States alone, two hundred millions of dollars, making an increase in one year of fifty-six millions. Relieved of all liability to redeem, the evident tendency of the banks was to still greater expansion. No reliable returns later than January, 1863, are accessible; but the prevailing tendency of the times towards inflation, and the great temptation to banks to avail themselves of the opportunity to put in circulation very large amounts of their notes, without any restraints in the way of redemptions, would favor the opinion that this was not the highest point reached by the circulation of State banks. The forty millions of currency in the southern States may now be added, giving an aggregate of two hundred and forty millions State bank circulation, which lias been in great part replaced by national currency. Without making any invidious comparisons, it is no injustice to say that the substitution of a currency based upon United States bonds, secure beyond any contingency, for the miscellaneous issues of State banks, has done much towards sustaining public confidence, and preventing distrust and possible financial disaster. REDEMPTIONS. The law as it now stands provides for the redemption of national currency in the cities of St. Louis, Louisville, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Pittsburg, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Albany, Leavenworth, San Francisco, and Washington. A n amendment to the law was proposed during the last session of Congress, requiring all national banks to redeem either in Boston, New York, or Philadelphia, but was postponed until the present session. Some system of practical and effective redemptions is desirable for the preservation of a healthy currency, and as a safeguard against redundancy. Under the existing requirements, thirteen hundred and twenty banks out of sixteen hundred and forty seven voluntarily redeem in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. These banks represent two hundred and forty millions of currency, of which three*fourths are redeemed in New York. The same arguments urged in favor of requiring redemptions in these three cities would, i f carried to their logical conclusion, establish the expediency of requiring redemptions at one central point. Every national bank in the United States is obliged by the necessities of business to keep an account in New York c i t y ; clearly showing the current of trade and the tendency, of money, and affording evidence that New York is the great commercial and financial centre. A currency of uniform value in all sections of the Union is of the highest importance to the commercial and industrial interests of the country. The notes may be of uniform design and have the same ultimate security, but these conditions, though steps in the right direction, will not compass the end in view, unless the notes are available at par for\"the payment of debts and settlement of balances at the financial centre. COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY. CMLV Banks of issue are a necessity of our financial system, recognized, encouraged, and protected by the government for the public good. I n return for privileges conferred they should be required to make their issues conform to the demands of trade. The demands of trade require currency that w i l l pay debts at the centre of trade. I f the banks do not furnish a circulation that will conform to this standard, their issues w i l l be depreciated and the loss w i l l fall upon the business of the country. The question is whether this tax shall be borne b y the people, while the banks reap the profit, or whether the banks shall perform their whole duty b y furnishing a currency which shall be available for the payment of debts everywhere, and thus complete the conditions necessary for a \" uniform value.\" This question is one of* growing importance, and one that presses for an early solution. National banks i n Boston, New York, and Philadelphia recognize their obligations to meet every demand in lawful money of the United States, whether i t be gold and silver or legal tender notes. T h e y are obliged b y law to receive i n payment of debts the notes of every other national bank; but. they cannot compel their customers to receive the same notes for their balances due from the banks ; and here lies a difficulty which w i l l subject the banks in those cities periodically to very great embarrassment. The tendency of money to accumulate in these centres of trade—except at certain seasons of the year, when it is needed to bring forward the products of the middle, western, and southern States—is a fact which cannot be questioned. These banks are obliged to receive all that is offered, but cannot pay i t out. A n escape from this dilemma may be found i n \"either of three different w a y s : First, the banks may be relieved from the obligation to receive this currency i n payment of debts; or, secondly, national currency notes may be made a legal tendar from the bank to its customers; or else, thirdly, national currency may be kept at par b y redemption at the great centres of trade. W i t h o u t discussing the expediency of acting in accordance with either of the two suggestions first named—because the first method would leave the currency i n a worse condition than it now is, and because the second method would be arbitrary, and would place national bank notes 011 a par w i t h United States notes, the necessity for which is not apparent at this juncture—the natural and most feasible method would seem to be that requiring the banks to keep their own issues at par by redemptions as above stated. Under existing circumstances this requirement cannot be onerous; lawful money, which now stands as the representative of specie, as the agency of redemptions, being materially in excess of the currency to be redeemed, would make the inauguration of a system of central redemptions feasible and practicable to an exceptional degree. Four-fifths of the banks have voluntarily recognized the propriety aud expediency of such a course b y selecting their redemption agencies i n New Y o r k , Philadelphia, and Boston. Justice requires that those banks which are willing to conform to the highest standard should be sustained; and this can be done effectually only by requiring all to place themselves on the same ground. I t is questionable, however, whether this object would be best attained by the plan proposed in House b i l l No. 771, which was postponed to the present session. This bill provides that every bank shall redeem its circulating notes at an association i n one of the seventeen cities named in section thirty-one of the currency act, but that each bank in those cities shall redeem i n New York, Philadelphia, or Boston its own notes and the notes of every other bank for which it may be the redemption agent. T h e object of the last provision is indirectly to compel every bank to redeem either in New Y o r k , Philadelphia, or Boston; not so indirectly, however, but that its purpose is perfectly evident, and therefore open to every objection that would ^ be urged against a direct requirement of law to that effect. I n recommending redemptions i n New York, there is no intention to ignore Yin REPORT OF T H E the claims of any other section of the country. There are cities of great commercial importance i n the middle, western, and southern States, whose financial interests demand consideration. The notes of banks located i n those cities are, by the provisions of the law as it now stands, redeemable i n New York, and the managers of those banks would not have i t otherwise. I f the law did not require it, they would voluntarily redeem there. The proposed amendment only requires all other banks to do the same thing. I t w i l l give those cities and the banks in those cities a currency that is worth par i n New York, instead of a depreciated currency that would be a continual clog upon all .business operations. I f any particular section is not tributary to New York, the fact that the banks of that section are required to redeem i n New Y o r k w i l l not make it tributary, but w i l l make such redemptions easy and in nowise burdensome. The commercial importance of any place w i l l force its own recognition; money can be drawn from it only for the payment of its debts. Trade flows in natural channels, and money goes w i t h i t ; wherever trade centres, there money will accumulate sufficiently for its wants. I f money is arbitrarily concentrated contrary to this principle, it will flow back again, just as water will find its level. I f the argument against redeeming i n New York is based upon the preponderating importance of any other place as a centre of trade, i t ceases to be an argument, as in the natural order of things the circulation issued by banks in that place w i l l be worth more at home than at any other point, and w i l l go home for the payment of balances rather than to New York for redemption; consequently there w i l l be no hardship in the requirement. I f the argument is not based upon that assumption, it is an argument for the other side of the question; for i f it is a hardship to redeem i n New York, the hardship is evidence of the necessity. I f all national banks are required to redeem their issues i n New York, reciprocal obligations w i l l be imposed upon the banks of that city. The balances kept i n those banks will amount in the aggregate to a very large sum, and there w i l l be competition between them for the accounts of the country banks. Such competition already exists, and has led to the dangerous practice of paying interest on deposits. This practice is condemned by all prudent bankers; but where one does it, others must do i t or lose the accounts of good correspondents. A bank that pays interest on current balances is obliged to keep its funds in constant use, or lose money. I n order to do this, loans payable on call are made -upon collateral security of more or less value; and there is so much competition for such loans that it has the effect to lower the standard of security required. Everything which causes extraordinary facilities in monetary transactions tends to produce excitement, overtrading, and speculation, sure to bring compensation sooner or later, i f not checked, in pressure, distress, and disaster. Loans of this description are made chiefly to speculators, and that is reason enough why the practice should be regarded as unsafe. Conservative banks should not countenance or aid speculation; and New Y o r k city banks, made by law the custodians of the available means for redeeming the circulation of all the banks i n the United States, should be the most conservative of all banks. They should not be allowed to jeopardize the funds of the country banks by loaning them for speculation, and they would not, i f they were not obliged to pay interest on them. Stop the payment of interest, and the temptation to make improper use of such funds is removed. The only way in which the evil in question can be reached, i f it can be remedied at all, is b y a law prohibiting every national bank from paying or receiving interest on bank balances, and the propriety of such a law is recommended to the consideration of Congress. Concurrently with a practicable system of redemptions, a gradual reduction of the volume of legal-tender notes would operate beneficially upon the character of COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY. IX the national currency, b y checking its expansion beyond the necessities of business. I f legal-tenders were reduced to such an extent that the amount in circulation.should not exceed the sum required to perform the functions of lawful money as the substitute for specie, redemptions would be more stringent, and banks would be compelled to regulate their issues by tlie demands of trade. ' A law enacted during the last session of Congress provides that the Secretary of the Treasury may diminish the volume of the United States notes in circulation, not to exceed four millions of dollars in any one month. Taking four hundred millions as the point from which the diminution commences, a regular reduction of four millions each month would leave at the expiration of two years three hundred millions of legal-tender notes in existence; or one dollar in lawf u l money, for the redemption of each dollar of national currency authorized. This ratio would hardly render redemptions sufficiently stringent to produce much effect on bank circulation ; but i f this point could be reached by the expiration of one year, the effect would be more decided. Four millions per month would be at the rate of one hundred and thirty-three thousand dollars per d a y ; but i f bankers should see the means for the redemption of their issues diminishing at the rate of two hundred and sixty thousand dollars per day, they would naturally and unavoidably curtail their circulation to the lowest point their business would permit, and the benefits arising from a practical system of redemptions would begin to be realized. This proposition is based upon the presumption that it w i l l be the policy of the government to withdraw^ all its notes issued for circulation as fast as it shall have the power to do so. The fact is not overlooked, however, that an opinion prevails to some extent adverse to this view of the case. I t is frequently and strenuously urged that the government should keep its notes in circnlation, and thus have the use of so much money without interest. I t is proposed very briefly to consider this question. United States notes originated in the necessities of the government, not in the necessities of trade and commerce. Their amount was regulated, not by the business necessities of the country, but by the necessities of a great emergency, and was only limited b y reaching the maximum of expenditure during a time of war. The amount issued was entirely arbitrary so far as the business interests of the country were concerned, and altogether in excess of the demands of trade, as is evident by the high prices borne by every kind of commodity, and from the surplus of money subject to the control of speculators. This currency cannot contract or expand from natural causes. I t was issued to save the country from bankruptcy during a protracted struggle with armed rebellion, and can only be contracted by legal enactment of Congress. There is no element about it in sympathy with the commercial and industrial interests of the country. The power of issuing notes to circulate as money is too dangerous to be placed at the mercy of political parties in a government like ours, and is fraught with possibilities of corruption and disaster calculated to excite the gravest apprehension in the minds of prudent men. Having served the purpose for which it was called into existence, provision should be made fur its withdrawal. On the other hand, banks are in direct sympathy with trade, dependent upon it for their profits; they meet its wants by discounts and by furnishing a circulating medium; i f currency is issued in excess of the demand, it is immediately returned for redemption, and contracts and expands as trade requires. I n a word, banks are amenable to the laws of trade, while the government issues are not. Furthermore, the banks have rendered important aid to the government throughout the war, and they have been largely instrumental in developing our national resources and in increasing our national wealth. The managers and stockholders comprise a large, useful, and public-spirited class in the community, numbering over two hundred thousand citizens. During the past year Yin REPORT OF THE they have loaned to the business of the country an average of six hundred millions of dollars. They now hold one-fourth of the entire indebtedness of the United • States. They have redeemed and returned to the treasury of the United states over fourteen millions of mutilated legal-tenders, and have redeemed twenty-five millions of seven-thirty coupons, to the very great convenience of both the public and the Treasury Department. They have been instrumental in placing in the hands of the people more than eleven hundred millions of United States securities. They have received and disbursed from the revenues seventeen hundred and seventy-four millions of public moneys free of expense to the government. The expense of transporting and concentrating for disbursement this immense sum by ordinary means, without the agency of national banks, would have been, at a,moderate estimate, not less than three millions of dollars. The net loss sustained by the government through the failure of two banks, which were depositories of public moneys, w i l l probably not exceed six hundred thousand dollars, or about one-thirtieth of one per cent, of the total amount involved, and about one-fifth of the amount it would have cost the government to do the business without the aid of the banks. From this statement it will be evident that national banks, although organized and managed by individuals for their own profit, are yet capable of rendering important services both to the government and to the public, and have demonstrated their entire willingness to perform such service; and that if losses have occurred to the government through their agency, the amount is small compared with the outlay that would have been necessary to carry on the business without them. DISTRIBUTION OF T H E CIRCULATION A U T H O R I Z E D BY L A W . The original act of March 25, 1863, provided for an apportionment of the national currency to the several States and Territories as follows; one hundred and fifty millions according to representative population, and one hundred and fifty millions according to banking capital, resources, and business. This requirement was repealed by the act of June 3, 1864, which left the distribution to the discretion of the Comptroller of the Currency. By the amendment of March 3, 1865, the clause requiring an apportionment to be made was re-enacted, but at the same date an amendment to section 7 of the internal revenue act provided that all existing State banks should have the right to become national banks, and should have the preference over neworganizations up to the 1st day of July, 1865. These two amendments were n o t j n harmony; for, i f the apportionment was made as required by the amendment to section 21, the State banks then in existence could not have been converted without exceeding in many instances the amount of circulation apportioned to the different States. But, as it seemed to be the intention and policy of the act to absorb all existing banking institutions rather than to create new banking interests in addition thereto, the Comptroller of the Currency so construed the amendments as to permit the conversion of State banks without limitation. The effect of this action was to make a very unequal distribution of the currency, some of the States receiving more than they were entitled to by the apportionment, .and leaving but a very limited amount to be awarded to the southern and some of the western States. Now, as the government has assumed entire control of the currency of the country, involving a direct supervision of its banking interests, it becomes the duty of the government to provide adequate banking facilities to all sections. The States lately in rebellion, not being in a condition to avail themselves of the privileges granted in the national currency act at the time when they were offered, and when it was still possible to obtain them, are now left almost en COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY. XI tirely destitute of currency and banking facilities. This deficiency is tlie occasion of great inconvenience and loss to the people of those States, and i t is very desirable, for many reasons, that it should be supplied. First. I t is important to all sections of the country, particularly to the northern States, that the south should be supplied with all the facilities necessary for the production of the great staples of that section, because the export of these staples would reduce the exportation of gold. Second. Although, to a limited extent, means are supplied by capitalists from other sections for the productions of this region, yet the supply is not equal to the demand, and foreign capitalists are thus enabled to gain entire control over a very large proportion of valuable products, yielding large profits to themselves and leaving i n the country barely the cost of the production. This state of things naturally causes much discontent and dissatisfaction among tlie producers. T h i r d . Prosperous industry is the most speedy and certain remedy for the existing evils in the southern States. I t w i l l allay bitterness of feeling, dissatisfaction w i t h the results of the war, and promote contentment among the people. T h e assistance that could be rendered for the promotion of this end by local banking associations would be important both in character and extent. Besides, a community or identity of financial and pecuniary interests would bring into exercise an element of great power for the assimilation of the aims, purposes, and hopes of all the people of all the States. The extension of the national banking system throughout the entire Union would bring about such an identity of interest in the credit of the government, and of the entire system of banks, as would secure the active and zealous co-operation of all sections toward the preservation of such credit unimpaired. T w o methods have been suggested by which the southern States can be supplied w i t h banking facilities. One is by an equalization of the circulation already authorized by law among the different States and Territories. T o this plan there are two serious objections: First, the question arises as to the right of Congress to rescind any portion of the contract made with national banks at the time of their organization, b y abrogating or restricting any of the rights secured by them in compliance with the .lav/, t t is true that Congress expressly reserved the right at any time to \"amend, alter, or repeal\" the national currency act. T h e act of February 25, 1S63, under which quite a number of banks were organized, was repealed b y the act of June 3, 1SG4. But the repealing act contained this saving clause : \" Such repeal shall not affect any appointment made, acts done, or proceedings had, or the organization, acts, or proceedings of any association organized or in process of organization under the act aforesaid;\" thus recognizing the principle that the repeal should not affect any rights secured under the former act. I t is not proposed to euter into any elaborate argument upon this question, but merely to suggest the doubts which may arise i n connection with any legislation looking to an equalization of the national currency by withdrawing it from banks which have secured the right in strict conformity to law. T h e second objection is this : that, granting the rig it of Congress to withdraw circulation, as above stated, the plan is impracticable as a measure of present relief, owing to the impossibility of securing the return of a sufficient amount of circulation within the necessary time. National currency notes, when once put in circulation, are scattered from the Atlantic coast to the Rocky mountains, and from the St. Lawrence to the Gulf. No one ever looks to see by what banks the notes are issued, and, there being no established system of redemptions, they are not and w i l l not be returned to the bank of issue until they become so mutilated as to make them difficult to circulate. . T h e second plan suggested is, by an increase of the amount of circulation to be issued. This plan is met by the assertion that it would tend directly to a further inflation of the currency. But this objection may be obviated by proper Yin REPORT OF T H E care i n so adjusting tlie increase tliat i t shall not at any time, or in any month, exceed the amount by which legal tender notes are diminished. I f the proper mission of legal tenders were fully understood, and the necessity of placing our currency on a permanent basis—either of specie or legal tenders, which stand as the substitute for specie—were properly appreciated, there would be no difficulty in providing for the proper reduction of the volume of legal tenders so as to leave room for a very moderate increase of national currency, and yet secure a net reduction i n the whole volume of the currency. The well-known views of the Secretary of the Treasury on this subject, based - upon the soundest principles of financial policy, only need to be seconded and earned out by Congress i n order to make the plan suggested entirely safe and feasible.. Bearing in mind the regular monthly reduction of legal tenders at the rate of •four millions per month, as provided for b y law, an increase of national currency not to exceed twenty-five millions, to be issued at the rate of one or two millions per month, would probably meet all the wants of all the States for two years to come. A s this eeems to be the only practicable method for the accomplishment of what is generally admitted to be a desirable end, it is respectfully recommended to the favorable consideration of Congress. I f , eventually, the amount of national currency thus increased appears to exceed the requirements of the country, the system of redemptions recommended w i l l unerringly correct the evil, and ultimately bring about that equalization of national currency among the different States and Territories which cannot be effected b y immediate and arbitrary measures. AMENDMENTS. There are many requirements and restrictions contained in the national currency act, a strict compliance w i t h which is essential to the safety and success of the system. The Comptroller of the Currency is expected to see that all the provisions of the law are enforced, but in a majority of instances is left without the power to compel obedience i n case of persistent neglect or w i l f u l disregard of the law on the part of the banks. T o remedy this defect certain amendments are suggested: 1st. A n amendment to section IS authorizing the appointment of a receiver, whenever satisfactory evidence is furnished that any association is not carrying on the proper business of banking ; that any of its reports required b y law have been false or fraudulent; that its funds have been w i l f u l l y misapplied by the officers or directors in violation of law, or that i t has committed any act of insolvency. 2d. A n amendment to section 29, extending the provisions contained therein, so that the limitation to one-tenth of the capital shall apply to all liabilities for money loaned or deposited, except balances due from one national banking association to another. Large amounts are frequently placed in the hands of private bankers, ostensibly in the regular course of business, but really, in a m r j o i i t y of instances, because private bankers, not being restricted in their operations by law, are able to offer greater inducements for the use of money; or, as is not unfrequently the case, private bankers having secured a controlling interest i n a bank divert its funds from legitimate banking and use them in speculation, &c. E v e r y national bank that has failed may trace its ruin to excessive deposits w i t h private bankers and brokers, and there is urgent necessity for such an amendment to section 29 as w i l l prohibit this practice. 3d. A n amendment to section 34 doing away w i t h quarterly statements, and requiring monthly statements showing the condition of each bank i n detail. The present monthly statements are much too vague and general to be of practical benefit, while the quarterly reports now required, coming at comparatively long COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY. XIII intervals and upon certain specified days, enable banks to prepare for a good exhibit upon tliofce particular days. I f detailed reports were required monthly the preparation on the part of the banks to make a good showing would be almost constant, and the Comptroller of the Currency would be enabled to exercise much greater vigilance in carrying out the provisions of the law. Provision should also be made for the collection of penalties imposed for delinquencies in making reports, and for the disposition to be made of the funds arising from such penalties when collected. 4th. A n amendment to section 3S, providing that where the capital stock of an association has become impaired by losses or otherwise, it shall be the duty of the directors to reduce the nominal capital and the circulation of the bank i n such an amount as may be rendered necessary, so as to represent the actual capital of the association, as provided in section 13 of the act, or, upon a vote of the stockholders owning two-thirds of the capital stock of the bank, to make a pro rata assessment upon the stockholders for an amount sufficient to make up the loss sustained; and in case of failure to do one or the- other within thirty days after the amount of the loss is ascertained, the Comptroller of the Currency may appoint a receiver to wind up the affairs of the bank. 5th. A n amendment to section 59, making i t a penal offence for any person to have in his possession with intent to pass or utter any false, furged, or counterfeit national bank note, and requiring every national banking association to cause every counterfeit note that may be presented at its counter to be stamped with the word \" counterfeit.\" The forms for these amendments, and for such changes i n the law as may be necessary to provide for redemptions i n New Y o r k city, or in the cities of New Y o r k , Boston, and Philadelphia, as may be deemed most expedient, and to provide for the issue of circulating notes to banks that may be organized in States unsupplied w i t h banking facilities, are not reported ; but the views expressed upon those points are submitted for such action as may be judged best adapted to secure the ends proposed. I n conclusion, I have only to state that the national banking system is now f u l l y inaugurated and in successful operation. T h e first bank was organized i n June, 1863. There are now i n active operation sixteen hundred and fortyseven, w i t h an aggregate paid-in capital of four hundred and eighteen millions, which is owned by two hundred thousand stockholders. T h e system has the confidence of the people, because it furnishes a circulation secured beyond any contingency, and is popular because it furnishes a currency of uniform value i n all parts of the country. I t has superseded all existing State banking systems, and places the entire control of the currency of the country in the hands of the federal government. I t has proved, during its three years of existence, a most important auxiliary i n the financial operations of the Treasury Department. A system that has grown into such magnitude in so brief a time, involving interests so vast and so vital to every portion of the community, demands a careful consideration and deliberate action. I t may not be perfect, for it was devised b y men, but it embraces all the best provisions and safeguards of tho banking systems of the several States, and experience and careful study have developed but few defects.
