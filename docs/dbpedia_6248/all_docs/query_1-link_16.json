        "text": "Leicester is one of the first cities in the UK to have a non-white majority, new statistics have revealed. Census 2021 figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that 40.9 per cent of people in the city are from white backgrounds, 10 per cent lower since the last census, in 2011.\n\nThe largest ethnic group in the city now comprises people from an Asian background, with a rise of 6.4 per cent since 2011, to 43.4 per cent. Commenting on the figures, which have been released today, city mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said he was \"very pleased and proud\" that Leicester had such diversity.\n\nAcross England and Wales as a whole, white people remain the majority group, at 81.7 per cent, down from 86 per cent in 2021. Some 48.7 million people identified as white in the 2021 census, compared to 48.2 million in 2011.\n\nREAD MORE: Nine Leicestershire schools say vaping companies are peddling 'a highly addictive drug as a teen fashion accessory'\n\nThe second largest group across England and Wales are Asian people, at 9.3 per cent, or 5.5 million, compared to 7.5 per cent in 2011, or 4.2 million. Black, African and Caribbean people comprise the third largest group, at 4 per cent, or 2.4 million people, compared to 3.3 per cent, or 1.9 million people, in 2011.\n\nAlong with Leicester, Luton and Birmingham are among the areas of England where people identifying as white now form a minority of the population, the census data shows. Some 14 local authorities recorded more than half of their usual residents as identifying with an ethnic group other than white, with the highest proportion in the London boroughs of Newham (69.2 per cent), Brent (65.4 per cent) and Redbridge (65.2 per cent). Outside London, the highest non-white proportion is in Slough in Berkshire (64.0 per cent), followed by Leicester (59.1 per cent), Luton (54.8 per cent) and Birmingham (51.4 per cent).\n\nHow has Leicester changed since 2011?\n\nSince the last census was conducted in 2011, the diversity of the city has evolved. White people made up more than half the population in 2011. Now, no ethnic group makes up more than half the the city's population. According to ONS data from 2011, Leicester was made up of:\n\n37 per cent of people identified as Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\n\n6 per cent of people identified as black, black British, black Welsh, Caribbean or African\n\n4 per cent of people identified as mixed or of multiple ethnic groups\n\n51 per cent of people identified as white\n\n3 per cent of people identified as 'other'\n\nThe 2021 census data reveals that Leicester's diversity has grown stronger and is now made up of:\n\n43.4 per cent of people who identify as Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\n\n7.8 per cent of people who identify as black, black British, black Welsh, Caribbean or African\n\n3.8 per cent of people are mixed or of multiple ethnic groups\n\n40.9 per cent of people identify as white\n\n4.1 per cent of people who identify as ‘other’\n\nSir Peter, Leicester's political chief, said: \"I am very pleased and proud of our city of Leicester. It gets enormous praise for the diversity of its communities who contribute so much to every aspect of our lives.\"\n\nClaudia Webbe, independent MP for Leicester East, said the diversity in Leicester was a strength that should be celebrated. She said: \"We are the city where our minorities make up the majority. That is what makes Leicester special, and we are richer for this vibrant exchange of cultures.\n\n“The new census data reinforces the identity of our community. As a city, Leicester can play a leading role in making government change course so that policies are genuinely for the good of everyone. Our communities enhance us as a city and as a country. We should and will be celebrating that. However, the real battle is the radical change that we need to see.\"\n\nRiaz Ravat, deputy director of Leicester's St Philip’s Centre, which has run interfaith schemes since 2006, said: “The city is projected as a beacon of hope in diversity because global communities have contributed richly to the social, economic and civic mosaic which makes up Leicester. People around the world have visited the city to understand our story.\n\n\"However, we have seen in recent times that we cannot be complacent and it is incumbent on all of us to evolve our work so that this proud legacy is passed on from generation to generation. Peaceful and positive relationships across our communities have to be worked on constantly by creating and opening up arenas of encounter and interaction. Leicester’s motto may be Semper Eadem – always the same but the reality is that the city has evolved over many years and it is this development which gives Leicester a global outlook. We should be proud of this.\"\n\nBishop of Leicester the Rt Reverend Martyn Snow said: \"Leicester has long been recognised as a city with a wide mixture of backgrounds, ethnicities and faiths and this rich cultural diversity is just one of the factors that contributes to making it such an interesting and exciting place in which to live.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:"
