        "text": "Leicester and Birmingham have become the first “super-diverse” cities in the UK, where most people are from black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, according to the 2021 census.\n\nA total of 59% of people in Leicester are from minority ethnic backgrounds, while 51% of Birmingham’s population are people of colour, as are 54% in Luton, according to the data. Across England and Wales, 18% of people are BAME.\n\nJohn Cotton, a Labour councillor, said Birmingham’s ethnic diversity was a “veritable strength”, though the milestone was not a surprise.\n\n“Ultimately, people make a city, people make a home, and that city and home are one and the same here in Birmingham – and that’s something we’re proud to be: a welcoming home to all who come here.”\n\nThough the census confirmed what Birmingham council already knew about the make-up of the population, he said the data was “crucial” in informing central government when allocating resources so the city could get “our fair share of funding and support, so everyone has a chance to prosper and succeed”.\n\nDr Chris Zembe, a senior history lecturer at De Montfort University in Leicester, who specialises in colonial and postcolonial history and the African diaspora, said Leicester was so diverse because of “evolving local political willingness to accept immigrants from outside the borders of Europe”.\n\n“Welcoming and promoting integration – not assimilation – has allowed the city to be a melting pot of cultures, where cultural diversity is celebrated, making Leicester a global city with mutual respect for our differences,” he said.\n\nNext year, the university is running a project marking 30 years since the murder of Stephen Lawrence in London through its Stephen Lawrence Research Centre, which focuses on the experiences of marginalised people, institutionalised racism and racial violence. Prof Lisa Palmer, from the centre, said the census data showed “now, more than ever, all institutions nationally, from education, health and employment, need to take the issue of race and racism seriously in order to tackle deeply rooted forms of inequalities in society”.\n\nOne example of Leicester’s “melting pot of cultures” is Prana cafe in the city centre, run by the couple Sukh and Andie Johal. The vegan cafe employs staff from South Korea, Turkey, South Africa and Thailand, as well as a mix of people born and raised in Leicester, including Sukh himself. “From day one we’ve always been very diverse. It’s just naturally how it’s fallen into place. When we start putting ourselves in groups, that’s where the problems and divisions lie,” Sukh said. “I think diversity is a beautiful thing.”"
