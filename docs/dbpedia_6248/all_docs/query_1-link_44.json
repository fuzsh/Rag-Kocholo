        "text": "Leicester is one of the most diverse cities in the UK and the largest in the East Midlands, the latest census shows.\n\nInformation from the 2011 survey shows, external there are 329,000 people living in the city, 24,000 more than in Nottingham, while 250,000 live in Derby.\n\nHalf of Leicester's population describe themselves as white British, compared with 80% nationally and 63.9% in 2001.\n\nDeputy Mayor of Leicester Rory Palmer said they viewed its diversity as a major strength.\n\nThe details emerged in the latest round of information released from the 2011 census taken in March.\n\nLeicester was widely tipped to be the first city with a minority white population but just missed out on the landmark with 50.6% describing themselves as white.\n\nBut it does have one of the lowest rates of residents who identify themselves as white British, at 45%, and the highest proportion of British Indians, at 28.3%.\n\nMr Palmer, deputy city mayor, said: \"What it means is that we have a very diverse population and we view this as a great strength and something the city can be very proud of.\n\n\"We saw the Queen and the royal family kick off their Diamond Jubilee in March this year here in Leicester, probably because Leicester is a very real reflection of modern, vibrant, multi-cultural Britain.\"\n\nWhile Nottingham's population remains smaller than Leicester's at 305,680 - 38,692 more than in 2001 - it does have a higher than average mixed race community.\n\nAbout 6% are mixed ethnicity, with 4% white and black Caribbean.\n\nDerby has the lowest number of ethnic minorities, with 80% of its 248,752 residents describing themselves as white.\n\nJudith Rowbotham, a social historian at Nottingham Trent University, felt national identity was still strong: \"We still see ourselves as British.\n\n\"I think we are happy with British accents - whether that is a British version of the Afro-Caribbean accent or the Brummie accent, it doesn't matter, it is all seen as British.\n\n\"It's rather like food, which has made a huge difference to how we see ourselves. We are so enthusiastic about curries or Thai food and how can you dislike a culture when you enjoy their food?\"\n\nNottingham is the youngest city in the region, and the second youngest nationally, with an average age of 30.\n\nLeicester follows closely with its median at 31 and Derby's is 36. Across the East Midlands, it is 40 compared with 39 throughout England and Wales.\n\nWorship in the region has also changed, with Christianity remaining the dominant, despite declining numbers."
