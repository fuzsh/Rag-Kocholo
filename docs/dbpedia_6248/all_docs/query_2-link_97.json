        "text": "This event was inspired by Stephen Carr’s publication ‘City Signs and Lights: A Policy Study’ prepared for the Boston Redevelopment Authority and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (published in 1973 by The MIT Press).\n\nIt was the result of ongoing discussions over several years about the urban communication function of street lighting between Robert Harland and Nic Winter, a road, street, and tunnel lighting specialist at Thorn Lighting. These were further enhanced through conversation with Jess Gallacher, then Knowledge Transfer and Communications Manager at the Institute of Lighting Professionals (ILP).\n\nTogether, the ILP with Leicester Urban Observatory and LCB Depot hosted 20 people from the lighting industry, local councils, historical societies, and universities in Leicester and Loughborough.\n\nAbove: City Signs and Lights: A Policy Study by Stephen Carr, The MIT Press (1973).

Full text reproduced below with permission.\n\nCreating a More ‘Legible’ Public Realm\n\nA recent Institute of Lighting Professionals (ILP) event brought together academics and lighting professionals to consider how public realm lighting can be better integrated into – and even lead – urban design and placemaking.\n\nBy Graham Festenstein\n\nEarlier this year, the Institute of Lighting Professionals (ILP) collaborated with the Leicester Urban Observatory on the first of a series of events to discuss the lighting of public space from a planning perspective, with an emphasis on the integration of lighting with signage and wayfinding, along with the potential for public art to play a role in urban design and placemaking.\n\nThe Leicester Urban Observatory is a collaboration between urban practitioners at Leicester City Council and academics at three local universities: De Montfort, Leicester, and Loughborough. It aims to establish and develop a combined centre of excellence in urban studies and planning for Leicester. Three speakers took part in the event: Grant Butterworth, head of planning for Leicester City Council; Dr Sean Clark, a digital and multimedia artist who has an interest in community projects and illuminated work; and myself on behalf of the ILP (as I am a lighting designer and consultant specialising in urban lighting).\n\nThe evening was introduced by Dr Robert Harland, […] Reader in Urban Graphic Heritage at Loughborough University. We were joined for discussion by an audience of lighting professionals, planners and architects.\n\nLighting to Support Placemaking\n\nThe importance and potential of lighting to support placemaking and wayfinding within the public realm is often overlooked, with an over-reliance on street lighting to comply with standards and a design brief. This, in turn, too often precludes proper integration with landscape, architectural design and way-finding strategies.\n\nThe ILP as an Institution promotes collaboration between designers, engineers and other consultants involved with public realm design to ensure all users of public space are served, so creating comfortable, legible and safe places that are easily navigated.\n\nTraditionally, the dialogue between lighting designers and planners has been fairly limited, leading to priorities that often do not do justice to the life and community that goes on during the hours of darkness, darkness that in the winter can of course begin as early as 4:00 pm in the afternoon.\n\nLighting is often seen as a technical engineering exercise executed at the end of a project rather than one integral to the design from the start as it should be. The way a space looks, feels and performs at night is fundamental to success of our urban communities.\n\nThe purpose of this and the further events to follow is to bring together lighting designers and engineers with planners and the other disciplines involved in public realm design to better understand how lighting can be supported and strategies developed to achieve these aims.\n\nLighting for Visual Amenity\n\nGrant Butterworth started the evening with a discussion around the planning priorities for lighting for visual amenity, protection of the environment and ecology through sensitive and properly considered lighting and the economic benefits of lighting through marketing, tourism and business promotion.\n\nHe went on to consider the social benefits of lighting, community safety and the promotion of heritage, architecture and cultural engagement through community events and cultural festivals such as Diwali, which of course is especially pertinent in Leicester, and how all of these areas of discussion are interlinked and the role of the local authority in delivering and managing them.\n\nGrant used examples of Leicester’s architectural feature-lighting grant scheme to illustrate some of his points along with images of lighting in public spaces. These included examples of poor lighting, in particular some digital displays demonstrating the potential harm that can be done through bad lighting and when it is not regulated properly through the planning process.\n\nGrant’s concluding statements can be summed up as follows: ‘Lighting can generate and reveal beauty… It can be a valuable and valued community resource. It can protect… It can harm and annoy… So it does need to be managed. Understanding the design process from all technical disciplines is a key objective.’\n\nGrant Butterworth sets out the challenges associated with street advertising and illumination.\n\nLighting and Festivals\n\nSean’s presentation, meanwhile, discussed a number of public art installations and installations for cultural festivals he has produced, many involving an element of community engagement and or interactivity.\n\nIn particular, he discussed his involvement in the Light up Leicester light festival. Sean’s work is interested in using technology to explore connectedness, often in a simple yet innovative way and light, lights or illuminated elements figure prominently in much of his work.\n\nWhen working in the public realm, he explained, he is interested in how his lit installations, or the way people interact with his installations, respond to the space or environment they are located within. For example, how they may be connected or lead people across the city or react to specific locations.\n\nSean outlined how he is very keen to explore the use of technology on a city-wide basis to create city-wide installations that connect people and places across the pubic realm. As he explained, in his artwork, he is inspired by systems’ theory, the nature of interactivity and creative explorations of flow, connectedness and communication.\n\nLighting and Urban Space\n\nFinally, for my own presentation, I discussed the role of lighting in placemaking and creating what I termed as a ‘legible’ public realm at night.\n\nIn particular, my discussion brought together a number of themes from the other presentations to demonstrate how lighting can be better integrated with urban design. In essence, how using elements of architectural or landscape feature lighting, street and area lighting, public art and lighting for wayfinding can deliver public spaces that are more comfortable and easier to understand.\n\nHow, too, lighting can be used to make spaces more navigable, using visual cues to orientate and create destinations that promote footfall and permeability.\n\nMy presentation highlighted the importance of vertical illuminance on building façades or other structures, either through controlled light spill or with designed architectural lighting; how this, again, helps legibility and how, without it, the sense of a space can be dissipated.\n\nTo my mind, an urban space is often defined by the buildings that surround it and, if this is lost, the character and identity at night can be lost. Lighting can benefit the night-time economy and can bring social benefits, so potentially reducing anti-social behaviour and promoting sustainability through community living.\n\nI believe there is clear potential to develop design integration further through the use of lighting controls and smart city technologies. We need to be developing better strategies for urban lighting and using lighting masterplanning to draw together all of the threads discussed by all three speakers to create, ultimately, a much more cohesive approach to the design of public spaces at night.\n\nThe evening was then rounded off by a discussion with the audience that demonstrated the need to dig deeper into the interesting topics and differing perspectives raised. I certainly look forward to exploring these questions further as the collaboration between ILP and the Leicester Urban Observatory develops over the coming months.\n\nBut let me leave the final word to Robert Harland. The event, he argued, was a first for the Leicester Urban Observatory. ‘Conceiving the idea and making it happen with the ILP set in place not only the opportunity to hear from highly specialised lighting professionals and practitioners, spanning planning, design, and arts, but the event also provided a template for future events of this kind,’ he said.\n\nThese may involve other professionals who contribute to the way people and places interface. The academic underpinning of Stephen Carr’s City Signs and Lights policy study from Boston in the early 1970s underpinned the talks, and emphasised importance of lighting as a communication tool in cities,’ Robert added [1].\n\nGraham Festenstein CEng FILP FSLL runs Graham Festenstein Lighting Design and is the ILP’s Vice President – Architectural\n\nEvent publicity and publications from ILP.\n\nReference\n\n[1] City Signs and Lights, Stephen Carr, 1973, https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81760.City_Signs_and_Lights\n\nEvent report\n\nUrbanism in Focus was a one day exploratory event organised by Leicester Urban Observatory for LCB Depot’s Design Season. Academics and professionals came together to share ideas about Urbanism with different communities in Leicester. Four sessions were organised as follows:\n\n9:00–11:00: Looking to learn about Leicester;\n\n12:00–14:00: Working Lunch: Introducing food’s urban graphic heritage;\n\n15:00–17:00: Urban research across the region;\n\n18:00–20:00: Debate and discussion with professional societies.\n\n9:00–11:00: Looking to learn about Leicester—Moat Community College. Closed session, led by Robert Harland and Justin Webber\n\nThe day began with a session for 40 pupils in year nine and year ten (13–15 year olds) studying Geography at Moat Community College in the inner city of Leicester. The session was introduced by Head of Geography, David Hill, and comprised a short presentation by Robert Harland (Loughborough University) and Justin Webber (Leicester City Council) that introduced Urbanism. This was followed by a quiz that encouraged pupils to identify landmarks in major world cities as well as local urban details in Leicester.\n\nGlobal city images (left) and local details from Leicester (right).

Public session, led by Robert Harland\n\nThis second session invited participants to bring and eat lunch that held meaning for them and reflected their heritage, family, and lived experience. This could include places to eat or food from other countries. After a short introductory presentation, discussion with Architecture students from De Montfort University explored ways migrant communities represent themselves on high street fascia panels through graphic images that reflect their cultural identity.\n\nFour Architecture students inquisitive about food’s urban graphic heritage\n\n15:00–17:00: Urban research across the region. Public session, led by Jamileh Manoochehri and Stafano De Sabbata\n\nThis session was about academic research exchange across the region. Jamileh Manoochehri (De Montfort University) introduced the session and showed her research into the mapping of building facades on Granby Street. Frank Breheny (also De Montfort University) then introduced the work of final year Architecture students, many undertaking substantial projects in Leicester. Stefano De Sabbata (University of Leicester) shared research for everyday digital geographies of Leicester and Robert Harland (Loughborough University) introduced Urbanism research in graphic heritage, global and world cities, and the Delos network. Doctoral Researcher Yusra Ali (De Montford University) shared her research about The Public High Street, and Angelina Pan (Loughborough University) explained the concept of graphic landscaping.\n\nDoctoral Researchers networking and presenting their studies\n\n18:00–20:00: Urbanism in Focus: A public debate between built environment specialists on how we live together and interact in and around Cities – Public session, led by Grant Butterworth\n\nThis evening session concluded the day with a discussion between ‘urban practitioners’ and an audience of 20 people. Issues for debate included:\n\n—Definitions of Urbanism;\n\n—History of urban settlement and indigenous nomadic culture;\n\n—Notions of what makes a place more or less urban;\n\n—Audience members volunteered examples of good urban places (e.g. Edinburgh, Letchfield);\n\n—The proliferation of sustainable urban extensions;\n\n—Green field development;\n\n—Branding of new housing estates.\n\nGrant Butterworth chairs discussion between three urban practitioners\n\nThree invited speakers biographies\n\nMichael Hopkins is a Principal Planner in the Local Plans Team at Charnwood Borough Council. Before working in local government he was a researcher in urban morphology at Birmingham University. He will provide a perspective on Urbanism reflecting on the relationship between Leicester, Leicestershire and Charnwood. He is interested in Urbanism as an emergent phenomenon linked to the parts and wholes that make up built form (bricks – walls – dwellings – street/neighbourhood – settlement) and the importance of difference and connections in its creation. He will explore relationship of Leicester as the central city with Loughborough and the Soar Valley villages and how urban or not they are in terms of form and function.\n\nDave Singleton was originally a geographer and surveyor from the East Midlands. He stopped making maps and moved into landscape architecture some thirty years ago. Latterly he has dabbled in urban design. And even urbanism. He set up DSA Environment + Design in Nottingham 2005. DSA is currently working on a number of public realm projects including in Sheffield, Rotherham, Grimsby and a redesign of Maid Marian Way in Nottingham as well as several large housing schemes and healthcare settings. Dave will introduce a perspective on Urbanism from the Landscape architect’s point of view. Dave teaches at Nottingham Trent University and University of Nottingham. He is an author of Building for a Healthy Life and a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. His interest centres on how people engage with place, in particular the role of blue-green infrastructure in making places, and what this might mean for the health of people, creatures and the natural environment upon which these depend. Dave considers Urbanism to be the study of people’s interaction with an urban (that’s to say in contrast to rural) environment.\n\nNils Feldmann set up Feldmann Architects after twenty years of working as a registered architect in London, Hamburg and Nottingham. Nils is currently the co-chair of the RIBA East Midlands region and a co-chair of the Design Review Panel for Design:Midlands. His portfolio includes architecture, urban design and interiors with an emphasis on offices and housing for commercial and private clients.\n\nAcknowledgements: Urbanism in Focus happened through close collaboration and support from James Burkmar, LCB Depot Creative Workspace Manager.
