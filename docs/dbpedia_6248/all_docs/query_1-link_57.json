        "text": "This factsheet compares Leicester to the five most similar European cities on size and industrial structure. These are: Bochum (Germany), Bielefeld (Germany), Mulhouse (France), Clermont-Ferrand (France) and Rouen (France).\n\nComparing cities in this way helps us to understand more about how well UK cities are competing on an international scale because it groups cities with similar industrial structures, rather than on their resulting economic performance. The factsheet also compares the relative strengths and weaknesses of Leicester to its European counterparts on variables such as skills, employment and productivity.\n\nCity group characteristics\n\nLeicester is part of a group of medium sized cities with a fairly similar sized public and private services sector.\n\nPopulation\n\nIndustrial structure\n\nKey\n\nManufacturing, mining and utilities 2011\n\nBusiness services 2011\n\nPublic services 2011\n\nOther private services 2011\n\nOther sectors 2011\n\nOverall economic performance\n\nLeicester has a high number of jobs and a low number of businesses compared to its group.
