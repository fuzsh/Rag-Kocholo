The population of Leicester is about 330,000, and about 500,000 people lived in the wider Leicester urban area, making Leicester the tenth largest city in the United Kingdom.\n\nLeicestershire is a major commercial and manufacturing centre, providing jobs for 437,000 people.\n\nLeicester is located on the Midland Main Line and close to the M1 motorway. The city has a large ethnic minority population, particularly of South Asian origin, a product of immigration to the United Kingdom since the Second World War. There are many Hindu, Sikh and Muslim places of worship and the Melton Road district serves as a focus, containing large numbers of Asian restaurants and other small businesses.\n\nLeicester is a centre for higher education, with both the University of Leicester and De Montfort University being based in the city."
