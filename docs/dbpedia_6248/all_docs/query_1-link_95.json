        "text": "The views of the mountains and the scenery here is SPECTACULAR! I would say it is the best in this category of any surrounding towns of Asheville. The downside and everyone who lives here says it- Restaurants/ cozy eateries, definitely not enough to sustain this growing community. Very little restrictions on businesses we have way too many junk car businesses that look terrible and if Another Tire shop with stacked tires against New Lei Hwy goes in I will lose my mind. This is actually is illegal in certain states. I would love to see this change and the tires placed behind the business not exposed to the street. Would love Leicester to keep its beautiful rolling farmland and still get a little more shopping and restaurants. Otherwise it is a great community to live in and we love that the city of Asheville with so much to do and the rich culture, nightlife,breweries, fabulous restaurants and shopping is just 15 min away. Wish we had a little charming downtown like Waynesville + BlkMtn"
