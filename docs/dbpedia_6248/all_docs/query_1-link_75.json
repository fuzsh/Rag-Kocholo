        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nLeicester (pronounced Less-ter) is one of the oldest English towns, having been founded by the Romans as Ratae Corieltauvorum (latterly Livelli-Castrorum ) in 50 CE. Its role as an Anglo-Saxon town is less certain, but the medieval town walls and street plan retain exactly those of the Romans. It was rarely centre stage through the Middle Ages, so it lacked political impetus nationally. While other such towns acquired cathedrals and grand civic functions, Leicester gradually built up a small-scale industrial prosperity based around framework knitting. This used semi-automated, leased machines, operated in people's own homes, to make stockings. Automation and factory building in the 19th century as part of the Industrial Revolution enabled Leicester to grow in population, land area and prosperity, with knitwear and machine manufacturing providing the bedrock of its economy. In the 1920s, its size and significance were reflected in being granted city status.\n\nIt is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the United Kingdom. It is also Britain's first environment city. Leicester continued to grow rapidly throughout the 20th century. From the 1960s arrivals from the West Indies and Asians from east Africa and the Indian subcontinent added to that growth and more recently Somalia, west and southern Africa, and Poland have been some of the larger of many different national communities. The two universities also both have very high overseas student intakes.\n\nVisitor information\n\n[edit]\n\nGo Leicestershire\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy road\n\n[edit]\n\nLeicester is adjacent to the M1 Motorway, allowing speedy road access south to London and north to many other major English cities.\n\nThe M69 motorway provides good access from the south of the city at M1 junction 21 towards Birmingham, Coventry, Nuneaton and Hinckley.\n\nAs noted below, for non-motorised road users, there is good access to the city for cyclists, from all points of the compass.\n\nFirst-time visitors to the city coming by car may find the inner ring road and associated one-way systems confusing and somewhat daunting. Plan your journey well in advance, be patient, and look for signposts for the many car-parks close to the city centre; or use the Park & Ride services (see below under 'Bus').\n\nThe city is served by Park and Ride services from Meynells Gorse in Braunstone to the west, Birstall to the north, and Enderby to the south.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nOften cheaper, but also significantly longer time-wise travel from London can be done via Nuneaton, Warwickshire, with London Midland trains. In Nuneaton, change for a Stagecoach bus 48 or Arriva bus 158 going to Leicester directly (very limited service in the evening and at the weekends). A bus station in Nuneaton is a ten minute walk from the railway station, and buses to Leicester depart from the platform. Also, there is a train from Nuneaton station to Leicester. Tickets specific to the London Midland services are the cheapest.\n\nLeicester also offers direct rail access to Stansted Airport, East Midlands Airport, Luton Airport, Sheffield, Nottingham, Derby, Peterborough, Cambridge and Birmingham.\n\nCross-country services (Cambridge, Stansted, Nuneaton, Coventry and Birmingham) are operated by Cross Country Trains.\n\nThe suburban services to Sileby, Barrow-on-Soar, and Loughborough are operated by East Midlands Trains; and towards Wigston and Narborough - Cross Country Trains.\n\nLeicester station is five minutes walk from the very centre of the city and another five minutes to the coach station (St Margaret).\n\nTrain passengers are entitled to discounts for local bus travel in many British cities, also in Leicester; student railcards give access to even greater savings. A PlusBus ticket can be purchased simultaneously with the train ticket online or at the station, incl. many vending ticket machines.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is close to East Midlands Airport (EMA IATA) in the county of Leicestershire and a drive should take around 35 minutes depending on the traffic situation. The airport is served by a 24/7 SkyLink bus from St Margaret's Bus Station in Leicester. Taxi is about £30 one way.\n\nBirmingham Airport (BHX IATA) is within a 45-minute to 1-hour drive from Leicester. It can be reached by train — a ticket to Birmingham is valid for the Birmingham airport as well — or coach\n\nThere are also a few flights available from Coventry Airport (CVT IATA) about a 45-minute drive away.\n\nLondon Stansted Airport and Luton airports are linked directly to Leicester by regular train services (see links to CrossCountry and East Midlands Trains above).\n\nManchester Airport can be reached by train, changing at Sheffield.\n\nGatwick Airport can be reached by train changing at Luton, Bedford or London.\n\nHeathrow Airport, Gatwick, Luton, Stansted and Birmingham airports can also be reached by direct 24/7 National Express coach services\n\nThere is a small airfield for private planes at Stoughton to the east of the city.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nNational Express couches arrive to St Margaret's Bus station, a short walk to the city centre. There are regular services to and from London, Birmingham and Nottingham where connections are available to most of the UK\n\nEurolines services to continental Europe.\n\nMegabus connects Leicester with London and from there - other British cities, as well as Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.\n\nThere are also services operated by local companies which serve the Asian communities in West London (Southall), Bradford, and other areas. These services are not generally well advertised, they may be short-lived, but can be cheap, and get you to out-of-the-way areas.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nLeicester is a fantastic place for Indian food. Laguna has existed since the late 70s and operates a traditional tandoor oven, on Narborough Road and the Good Food Guide listed The Rise of the Raj is on Evington Road.\n\nLeicester's large Gujarati community - centred in the Belgrave area - has led to the opening of many excellent Indian vegetarian restaurants in that part of the city. Sharmilee, Sayonara and Phulnath, come highly recommended by local residents. The Chaat House is also a great places for Masala Dosas and other light meals.\n\nExcellent food can be had at Watsons Restaurant which is a refined and tasty experience (near the Phoenix Theatre) and The Case near St. Martins, the lunch menu is excellent as are the wait staff, a distinctly French feel is on offer and The Case has the joy of being connected to the delightful Champagne Bar on its ground floor. Dinos on Garrick Walk, Haymarket has an excellent reputation and a very Italianate, exciting menu. The Quarter, housed in the former wholesale vegetable market building on Halford Street has an excellent menu. This restaurant/bar is a beautiful open space with a great menu and superb cocktails.\n\nSome good, mid-range restaurants/bars with menus can be found near the City on Braunstone Gate, the best of these being the ever popular Left Bank, which is cheap, spirited and tasty. Across the road, Mobius is interesting with a lively bar to the ground floor and restaurant upstairs. The Sultan, one of a number of Turkish restaurants along the Narborough Road, has very good value authentic Turkish meals: donor, shewarma, pide and meze.\n\nMid-priced food can also be found easily at decent chains such as Ask, Zizzi, Las Iguanas, La Tasca and three Pizza Express restaurants around the city.\n\nFor those with even tighter budgets, Leicester offers a wide array of different takeaways. Leicester takeaways range from Indian food to Italian, American, Turkish, Chinese, Thai and other types of food. Generally, a takeaway meal for two can be purchased between £10 and £15.\n\nTea rooms and coffee shops abound, most notable are Mrs Bridges on Loseby Lane and Bossa close to the City Gallery, if you want to avoid the usual Starbuck and Costa chains, Fenwicks also houses a pleasant old-school cafe, steeped in the 1960s/70s, on its top floor, with excellent food on offer at reasonable prices.\n\nGelato bars offer a range of non-alcoholic drinks and puddings: Madisons Cafe Bar & Gelateria on London Road, Gelato Village on St Martin's Square, Whipee Gelato and Bru, both on Granby Street, offer daytime and evening opening, as do similar places further out from the centre, such as Narborough Road.\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nAll these are in the city centre:\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]"
