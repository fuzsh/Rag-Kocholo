        "text": "Leicester has long been overshadowed by the more well-known cities in the United Kingdom. When it comes to the most popular cities, London, Manchester, and Birmingham frequently grab the spotlight. However, in the last few years, Leicester has become a leading name around the world. To a large extent, this success is attributable to the success of the local football team, which won the Premier League in 2016.\n\nBut football isn't everything in Leicester.\n\nIt's a fun, youthful location to call home. The city's rich history and widely lauded inclusive and multicultural way of life add to this excitement.\n\nOnefamily and Lonely Planet both rank the city as one of the top ten best locations to live in the UK.\n\nLeicester's 443,800 residents can choose from a wide range of fantastic neighbourhoods and surrounding areas, confirming the city's reputation as a desirable place to live in. In this blog, we’ll cover the top five areas in Leicestershire that are not only a great place to live in but have also seen a price growth since 2020 making it a good investment.\n\nThe City Centre\n\nAverage Price of Property: £180,300\n\nPopulation: 8,500\n\nThe city of Leicester has a modest but well-established market for city living flats, some of which are located along the city's scenic waterways. As a result, city living could become a popular option in this area. A £500 million five-year proposal to create up to 3,000 new city dwelling units in the center of the city has recently been unveiled. The city center, it turns out, offers some of the most affordable houses right now.\n\nThe Western Suburbs\n\nAverage Price of Property: £200,000-£290,000\n\nPopulation: 98,000\n\nThe proximity of the M1 on Leicester's west side makes it an excellent choice for commuters. Many jobs can be found in nearby major business parks. Family-friendly areas include Glenfield; Thorpe Astley; Braunstone Town; and the Braunstone Development, a huge post-war social housing estate.\n\nNorth and North East Leicester\n\nAverage Price of Property: £200,000-£260,000\n\nPopulation: 125,000\n\nThere is a wide range of property types in the north and northeast Leicester, from low-cost to high-end, making it a good place for property investors of all budgets. Some of its inner-city suburbs, such as Highfields and St. Matthews, are very poor. Beaumont Leys is a sprawling housing development with a major shopping mall at its heart, divided into numerous sections. Further out, you'll find reasonably priced homes in Thurmaston and Birstall, as well as attractive little towns like Groby and Anstey, all of which offer easy access to the city and the M1.\n\nSouth Knighton\n\nAverage Price of Property: £300,000-£350,000\n\nPopulation: 2,912\n\nThe neighbourhood of Knighton, where South Knighton Road is located, is a green one in the city of Leicester. As a result of the industrial revolution's need for housing, a village 1.8 miles outside of town was transformed into an apartment complex. To the north is Clarendon Park, to the east is Stoneygate, and to the south is Oadby.\n\nWhile South Knighton and the surrounding area have changed throughout the years, the village's unique character has been preserved. When you visit the Church of St. Mary Magdalen, you'll be reminded of the area's rich history. People who live in South Knighton are still in the middle of the action, despite its village-like appearance and quiet surroundings.\n\nThe Southern Suburbs\n\nAverage Price of Property: £260,000-£330,000\n\nPopulation: 95,000\n\nThe London Road and Harborough Road corridor in South Leicester has some of the city's most affluent neighborhoods, making it one of the city's most popular places to live. Clarendon Park, Knighton, and Stoneygate are professional hotspots close to the city center that also cater to a student population. People looking to buy or rent in Wigston and Oadby, on the edge of Leicestershire's rural countryside, will find them appealing.\n\nAre You Looking For A House For Sale In Leicestershire?\n\nDid any of the places on our list appeal to you?
