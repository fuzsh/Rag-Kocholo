        "meta_description": "The success of Britain as a supranational state rested on subjugating England and Englishness to the British project and in preventing English distinctiveness, maintaining itself and emerging from under the cloak of the British project. This chapter explores the factors and debates that influence the nature of local government in England. The 1992 Local Government Commission rejected the production of a national unitary blueprint for local government and recommended a mix of unitary and two-tier councils. The chapter sets out a case for a new constitutional settlement for the UK; one which develops from the localities upwards and which sees political power and democracy, governance, and representation. Anglo-Saxon England, for administrative, governing and military purposes, was divided into shires, hundreds and burhs, which rested within the original Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Toulmin Smith emphasises the key characteristics of the Anglo-Saxon approach to the localities, primarily small territorial units, governing themselves.",
