        "text": "Posts shared on Facebook have claimed that “8.2% of the population of Leicester” identifies as “British”.\n\nThis is false. Data from the 2021 Census shows that over half of Leicester’s population identifies as “British”.\n\nThe claim appears to stem from a slightly different claim made earlier this month by a guest on a GB News programme presented by Nigel Farage. The guest claimed that 2021 Census data showed “only 8.2% of people in Leicester now class themselves as English”.\n\nIt is true that census data shows 8.2% of Leicester residents gave “English” as their only national identity. A further 8.2% identified as “English and British”, meaning a total of 16.4% of people in Leicester said either part or all of their national identity was “English”.\n\nHowever, when looking at those who identified as “British”, as is stated in the Facebook posts, 55.8% gave this as their only national identity, with a further 8.3% listing “British” alongside another national identity.\n\nThis means a total of 64.1% of people in Leicester said either part or all of their national identity was “British”.\n\nIn total, approximately three quarters (76%) of the city’s population listed some form of UK identity (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish, British or a combination of these) as their national identity. This includes 0.1% who listed “Irish” alongside some form of UK identity as well, and 3% who listed another national identity alongside some form of UK identity.\n\nWe’ve previously fact checked a number of claims about ethnic or national identity in UK cities, often based on misinterpreted census data."
