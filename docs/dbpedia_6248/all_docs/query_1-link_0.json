        "text": "The Leicester Built Up Area (BUA), Leicester Urban Area, or Greater Leicester is an urban agglomeration defined by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), centred on the City of Leicester in the East Midlands, England. With a population of 559,017 at the time of the 2021 census, Greater Leicester BUA is the eleventh largest in England and thirteenth largest in the United Kingdom.[1] It comprises Leicester itself and its suburbs, all of which are contiguous with or situated in close proximity to the city.\n\nAs at 2011 the Greater Leicester BUA was home to 51.8% of the total population of Leicestershire[2] (2001: 48.5%). A 2017 quote from the Leicester City Council website states that \"The Greater Leicester urban area is one of the fastest growing in the country, with a population of about 650,000, of which 350,000 live within the city council area\"[3].\n\nAnalysis: 2011\n\nLeicester Built-up Area\n\n2011 Census[4]\n\nUrban subdivision Population Leicester ONS City &\n\ninner suburbs\n\n443,760\n\nNarborough / Enderby 12,996 Outer suburbs\n\n65,156\n\nSyston 12,804 Blaby / Whetstone 12,760 Birstall 12,216 Groby 6,782 Cosby 3,506 Queniborough 2,326 Littlethorpe 1,766 Total 508,916 Change % from 2001 15.3%\n\nAnalysis: 2001\n\nLeicester Urban Area\n\n2001 Census[5]\n\nUrban subdivision Population Leicester ONS City &\n\ninner suburbs\n\n330,574\n\nWigston 33,116 Outer suburbs\n\n110,639\n\nOadby 22,679 Blaby / Whetstone 12,263 Birstall 11,480 Kirby Muxloe 9,500 Groby 6,256 Beaumont Leys 5,579 Ratby 3,862 Cosby 3,647 Queniborough 2,257 Total 441,213 Change % from 1991 5.8%\n\nAnalysis: 1991\n\nLeicester Urban Area\n\n1991 Census[6]\n\nUrban subdivision Population Leicester ONS City &\n\ninner suburbs\n\n318,518\n\nWigston 32,864 Outer suburbs\n\n98,083\n\nOadby 18,538 Birstall 11,770 Kirby Muxloe 7,780 Groby 7,183 Blaby 6,538 Whetstone 4,032 Ratby 3,601 Cosby 3,390 Queniborough 2,387 Total 416,601 Change % from 1981 3%\n\nAnalysis: 1981\n\nLeicester Urban Area\n\n1981 Census[7]\n\nUrban subdivision Population Leicester ONS City &\n\ninner suburbs\n\n324,394\n\nWigston 32,373 Outer suburbs\n\n80,008\n\nOadby 18,331 Birstall 12,519 Kirby Muxloe 6,896 Groby 4,689 Ratby 3,095 Queniborough 2,105 Total 404,402\n\nAnalysis: Notes\n\nThe Leicester ONS sub-totals are explained with reference to the following:\n\nFor 2011, there have been certain reclassifications from 'outer' to 'inner suburbs' thus contributing to the increase in population of Leicester ONS compared to 2001 and prior.\n\nThe ONS's definition of \"Leicester\" in the 2001 census excluded the northern area of the Beaumont Leys ward, which was counted separately, and amalgamated several surrounding towns and villages. Its boundaries and population were not the same as that of the Leicester UNITARY, which had a separate population of 279,921 at the 2001 Census and includes Beaumont Leys. See the 2001 Leicester ONS analysis.\n\nOngoing refinements in methodology between the two census dates meant that contiguous suburbs, external to the city boundaries and which were subdivided up to 2001, were merged into the 2011 Leicester ONS figure. These, along with infilling at the margins, also accounted for the removal of Ratby and the addition of new subdivisions.\n\nLeicester ONS figures do not include the Ashton Green/Glebelands/Thurcaston Park development (containing 556 residents in 2011). Although within the city boundaries, this incipient addition is in effect a satellite village given that there is 'green separation'. This categorisation is likely to change as future residential expansion planned around the development,[8] converges towards Beaumont Leys and Birstall; both part of the urban area/BUA.\n\nThe Kirby Muxloe figures up to 2001 includes the portion of Leicester Forest East which is to the west of the M1 motorway. The eastern section is part of the Leicester ONS subdivision, and is listed separately in the 2001 table.\n\nAlthough Stoughton is shown as a small leg of the urban area, its figures are not counted.\n\nSee also\n\nList of settlements in Leicestershire by population\n\nList of urban areas in the United Kingdom\n\nList of metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom\n\nCity Regions (United Kingdom; North, West and North Sussex-super-Mare)\n\nReferences"
