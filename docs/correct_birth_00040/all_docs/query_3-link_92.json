        "text": "What goes around comes around for Justin Timberlake. After first hitting the open market almost a year ago with a $10 million price tag, the Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, and actor has officially offloaded a sprawling parcel of land in Tennessee for $8 million—or double what he paid for the vacant property in the affluent Franklin neighborhood pocket nine years ago.\n\nThe 43-year-old Memphis native purchased the nearly 127 acres of land near the historic village of Leiper’s Fork for $4 million in spring 2015 from Aubrey Preston, a local philanthropist and preservationist, who sold him a 126-acre chunk of his 224-acre property. There’s no word on what Timberlake had planned to do with the land, which is protected against development through The Land Trust for Tennessee.\n\nRELATED: Rebel Wilson Lists in L.A., Sydney Sweeney Scoops Up Florida Estate, and More Celebrity Deals\n\n“Both of us share that love of Tennessee and enjoyed how we grew up, on land,” Preston told The Tennessean at the time of the sale. “We want to do our part to save that for future generations, and our kids,” he said. “That’s how we got to know each other.”\n\nNestled alongside the Natchez Trace Parkway in Williamson County, about 20 miles from Nashville, the picturesque ridgetop site consists of 50 acres of open pasture, wildlife food plots, a spring-fed fishing pond, and woodsy trails, all offering up sweeping views of the surrounding valley. Per the listing, which was held by Tom Sullivan of Covey Rise Properties, dual entrances include one that passes through a covered bridge spanning Dobyns Branch Creek and another for construction crews or horse trailers.\n\nRELATED: Luxury Home Buyers Are Moving to Nashville in Droves. Here’s Why.\n\nIn addition to his latest sale, Timberlake and his actress and producer wife Jessica Biel lay claim to a Hollywood Hills mansion he bought from actress Helen Hunt over two decades ago, subsequently remodeled, and recently tried to sell for $35 million before it was removed from the market. They also maintain a spacious home in the affluent Yellowstone Club near Big Sky, Montana."
