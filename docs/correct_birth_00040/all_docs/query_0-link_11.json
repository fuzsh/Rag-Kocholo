My voice is my most prized possession,\" says Justin.\n\n\"If I could talk, I could sing. I was always performing for somebody.\" His uncle agrees. \"Whether he was telling a joke, or dancing in front of everybody at Christmas, Justin was always the entertainer.\"\n\nJustin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee at 6:30 p.m to Randy and Lynn Timberlake. His parents got a divorce and both remarried, so now Justin has a step-dad Paul and a step-mom Lisa.His Dad and Lisa now have two sons: Jonathan and Steven.They also had a daughter named Laura Katherine who died shortly after birth.Justin considers her his 'Angel in Heaven'.\n\nJustin-an only child at the time of his parents divorce-moved away from Memphis, to Orlando, Florida. There, he got a kick start.\n\nRight away, he began entering contests-the first time he nabbed top prize in was, \"Dance Like the New Kids on the Block.\"\n\nIt was 1989, and that group sold millions of records, had the hearts of all the girls, and rocked the music world. Little did this ambitious little Justin know, that his time to shine would come soon enough, and much more effective than that of the New Kids. He did, however, work hard. He didn't solely rely on his natural ablity, he got MANY private lessons. He studied, and practiced, the piano and guitar, worked with his vocal coach, and invested his precious childhood playtime in every possible school play, or community talent show. His hard work often rewarded him with the lead roles, too.\n\nHis big break came in 1992, when Justin auditioned against, and beat out, 5,000 other hopeful children. This was for a part on the New Mickey Mouse Club, a variety show on the Disney Channel. The show, nicknamed MMC, had a group of about 20 regulars, and had been on since 1989. When Justin rotated in, he was at the tender age of 12. His thoughts: \"It was a great opportunity. I was able to prepare myself as a singer and dancer.\"\n\nIn 1994, the show was abruptly cancelled, and Justin had no choice but to leave his showbiz buddies and return to Memphis with his mother. There, he also began back in public school. Being a \"regular kid\" did not agree with him. \"I got so bored and down about everything,\" he recently told Teen People.\"I started to get a little rebellious. I didn't really get in trouble, but I wasn't focusing like I could. I didn't have the inspiration that music gave me. That's my place in the world, that's where I belong.\" Well, a year later, Justin got back into the world, or, more correctly, Justin got the opportunity which put him ON TOP OF THE WORLD. \"It was fate,\" he said.\n\nChris Kirkpatrick had decided to put a band together, and called up Joey Fatone, first. Justin and J.C. had no idea that their connection with Joey would soon change their worlds. Joey happened to be one of the dancers on the opening and closing numbers of the show. Well, when Joey and Chris were wondering if J.C. and Justin wanted to become a part of their band, the guys immediately agreed. After reeling in the Showstopper(a popular show choir), Lance Bass, Justin's mother came up with the band's name.\n\nWhile a member of NSYNC, Justin graduated from high school via mail, a year early, in 1998. And, Justin fully intends on furthering his education with college, once he gets the chance.\n\n\"I have a half brother, Steven Robert. He was born on August 14 1998, and I got word from my Daddy that he looks exactly like me at that age. He's got to be a hideous little lizard\"\n\nWhen Justin was ten years old, he made a guest appearance on the Grand Ole Opry, a country music show in which Justin sang a southern song to show his true heritage. He then went on to sing on Star Search,on which he also sang an adorable country western song! At age twelve, he joined the cast of the Mickey Mouse Club for two years, where he met future 'N SYNC member JC Chasez. Once the show was cancelled, Justin was called down to Orlando in order to audition for a group, which included fellow 'N SYNC member Chris Kirkpatrick. Unfortunately, the group didn't work out.Chris then got the idea of creating a group of his own and called up Justin... and well you know the rest of the story.\n\n\"I grew up singing in church, then I got voice lessons when I was about eight. Then I did some talent shows and things. From that moment on, I knew that's what I wanted to do.\" This is a main reason Justin began the Justin Timberlake Foundation. to give back to the schools, because he knows how weak their music programs are. If he hadn't enrolled in his private lessons, he may not be where he is today!!\n\nJustin's mom used to say that he was \"like a little toy\", because when he was a tot, she and his father would entertain themselvesby playing fast music, then slow, then fast;while watching in amazement as their baby boy would keep time to the music with his little feet.\n\nHe probably inherited his voice from his father, who is a talented singer in a bluegrass band. Before he was 3, Justin could harmonize with his father and with songs he heard on the radio, and, as his mother said, he never went anywhere without his favorite toy, a tiny plastic guitar. Music was DEFINITELY Justin's path.\n\nJustin has pearcing blue eyes and curly blond hair, which he sometimes dyes. He's 6'2\" tall and weighs 170 pounds, since his muscles are so big! His nicknames are Curly (because of his hair), Bounce and shot because he loves basketball, and The Baby since he's the baby of the group.\n\n\"I grew my hair out once and I'd wake up every morning and look just like Maxwell. Whoa! My hair was scaring me.\" It proved too unruly for the 14 year old Justin.\n\nHe loves singing, dancing, hanging out with the guys and playing basketball.\n\nHe hates his curly hair, girls who smoke, dishonest people, snakes and sharks, and racism. Christmas is his favorite holiday and he loves spending it with his family.\n\nHe loves collecting sneakers (he has over 20 pairs!!!)\n\nHe just can't resist going into a footlocker when he passes by one at the mall. He even brings an extra empty duffel bag on the road for sneakers!!\n\nHis favorite sport is basketball, which he's very good at.\n\nHis favorite cereal is Apple Jacks,(but he also likes the new cereal, Oreo O's).\n\nHe has two pets: a dog named Ozzie and a cat named Alley.\n\nHis favorite clothing is anything from North Carolina,(espesially in baby-blue, or, what he calls \"North Carolina Blue,\") and he usually wears Tommy Hilfiger or Calvin Klein boxers.\n\nHis favorite part of his body are his hands (because of basketball) and his most prized possessions are his voice and an autographed Shaq Jersey.\n\nJustin has a habit of talking in his sleep; in fact, you could even have a full conversation with him while he's sleeping. His mother will ask him questions in his sleep, because he will answer anything. She calims that that is the best way to find things out about him! If he can't fall asleep, he sometimes sings softly to himself or listens to soft music if the other guys aren't available to sing to him. He's also not a heavy sleeper. According to him, if someone were to stand over him, he would wake up, or at any slight noises.\n\nHis greatest fears are dying unloved, snakes, sharks, spiders, AND that he might fall unconscious at a concert from all the stuffed animals his fans throw on stage.\n\nWhen `N Sync first began... \"I still get a chill up and down my spine when I hear one of our songs on the radio, or a crowd cheering. Those thrills will never die for me, no matter how many times they happen.\"\n\n\"I told my parents, 'If we get lucky with this music career, I want to buy you guys a house, or buld you a house wherever you want.\"\n\nFor now, though, Justin says he's completely content with the house he shares with his family in Memphis. As a matter of fact, Justin says that if his dream of building his family's fantasy house comes true, Justin might ditch the Miami idea and settle down with a family of his own in that house.\n\n\"Memphis is the most homey place. It's not too big, and it's not too small. I'm like Dorothy. 'there's no place like home.\"\n\nChris's opinion?: \"Justin is our youngest member, but he's also the most mature. He's got a really good head on his shoulders. When it's time to work, he's always there to work. He's very responsible and he knows what's expected of him. That's really impressive, given that he's only 21.\" Justin is also voted most mature and one with the best head on his shoulders by his fellow NSYNCers.\n\n\"I love basketball and whenever I've the chance I play like crazy. I'm also a bit of a shopaholic, and collect North Carolina basketball gear\", He's also \"An athletic, nice sorta guy\"and \"A real party animal -- when the others let me go to parties!\" said Justin when the guys first started out.\n\nQUOTABLE QUOTES: \"Whatever your dream is, you have to practice your craft and make it the best it an possibly be.\"\n\n\"Are you looking at my bum? You bum looka!\"\n\n\"The thing that gets me mad is when they just call up, and you answer the phone and they go, 'Who is this?' and I'm like, 'Look woman, if yo don't know who you're calling, then hang up and try again!'\"\n\n\"Are you crazy? We can't do it in here, this is a Mercedes!\"\n\n\"When we put our group together-and we were together six months before we met Johnny-I didn't even know who the backstreet boys were.\"\n\n\"We put the group together ourselves. We were friends before we got a management team, before we got a record deal.\"\n\nMost of all, Justin, and the rest of the men of *NSYNC, want to continue what they've been doing all along-making music they love, for the fans they love.\n\n\"We want to be pioneers in the music industry,\" says Justin. \"We want to make our own name. We have inspirations individually and as a group. We look up to groups like Boyz II Men, Take 6, Micheal Jackson...but we just want to be *NSYNC.\""
