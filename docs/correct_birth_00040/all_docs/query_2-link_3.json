        "text": "1981-present\n\nJustin Timberlake Now: Singer Arrested and Charged with DWI\n\nPolice arrested music star Justin Timberlake on June 18 and accuse him of driving while intoxicated on New York’s Long Island. Sag Harbor Village Police confirmed to NBC News that Timberlake, 43, was in custody Tuesday morning and faces a DWI charge. The singer was later released following an arraignment. Representatives for Timberlake haven’t commented about the situation.\n\nA source told People that Timberlake had dined at the American Hotel in Sag Harbor and was driving to a friend’s house when police pulled him over. TMZ also reported the former *NSYNC star was cited for running a stop sign and failing to stay in his lane.\n\nThe 10-time Grammy winner is currently in the middle of his Forget Tomorrow World Tour, which runs through the rest of the year. He is scheduled to perform in Chicago on June 21 and June 22.\n\nWho Is Justin Timberlake?\n\nJustin Timberlake found fame as a member of *NSYNC and has since become a Grammy-winning solo musician and actor. The Tennessee native was a child star on The All New Mickey Mouse Club, alongside Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. In 1995, he became a teen heartthrob with the boy band *NSYNC. After the pop group’s immensely successful run, Timberlake went solo in 2002. He proved he could stand alone with his Grammy-winning solo debut album, Justified, and has continued that success with four more albums and hit songs such as “SexyBack” and “Can’t Stop The Feeling!” Also an actor, Timberlake has starred in the movies The Social Network, In Time, and the Trolls franchise. He is married to actor Jessica Biel. His latest album, titled Everything I Thought I Was and featuring the song “Selfish,” released in March 2024.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Justin Randall Timberlake\n\nBORN: January 31, 1981\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Memphis, Tennessee\n\nSPOUSE: Jessica Biel (2012-present)\n\nCHILDREN: Silas and Phineas\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aquarius\n\nEarly Life\n\nJustin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee, to parents Randall “Randy” Timberlake and Lynn Bomer.\n\nFour years later, Timberlake’s parents divorced. Both have remarried, and the extended family remains close. Justin has two half-brothers on his father’s side. His half-sister died shortly after birth, and Timberlake eventually paid tribute to her in the *NSYNC song “My Angel in Heaven.”\n\nRaised a Baptist, Justin grew up singing in a church choir. His family circle also included a number of musicians who nurtured his talent, including an uncle who played in a bluegrass band. One of his grandfathers, who had jammed with Elvis Presley, first taught the young Timberlake to play. His grandfather also introduced him to the songs of Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash. At the same time, his father played him songs by bands like the Eagles and Queen. Growing up in Memphis, home of the blues, Timberlake also got turned on to the likes of B.B. King and others.\n\nJustin Timberlake in September 1993, during his first year on The All New Mickey Mouse Club\n\nHis professional career began on the Disney-backed kids variety show The All New Mickey Mouse Club. The young teenager performed as a Mouseketeer from 1993 to 1995, alongside fellow future pop stars Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and JC Chasez. A young Ryan Gosling was also on the show and roomed with Timberlake and his mom for a period. After leaving the show, Timberlake had a high-profile relationship with Spears, but his friendship with Chasez ultimately became a life-changing connection.\n\n*NSYNC\n\nAfter The All New Mickey Mouse Club, Timberlake and JC Chasez were recruited by fellow musician Chris Kirkpatrick to form a boy band in 1995. Rounding out the five-person group were Joey Fatone and Lance Bass. *NSYNC became an overnight sensation in Europe with the song “I Want You Back” before signing a record deal with RCA in 1997. Timberlake’s fate as a teen heartthrob was sealed.\n\nChris Kirkpatrick, Justin Timberlake, Joey Fatone, Lance Bass, and JC Chasez formed the incredibly successful boy band *NSYNC in 1995.\n\n*NSYNC soon became one of the hottest pop groups of the 1990s in the United States, too. The U.S. version of their self-titled debut album released in March 1998 and included another early hit “Tearin’ Up My Heart.”\n\nAfter dealing with a very public legal battle with their former manager Lou Pearlman, the band released its sophomore album, No Strings Attached, in 2000. The Grammy-nominated record became the top-selling album of the year and the best-selling album of the decade. Its first single, “Bye Bye Bye,” became *NSYNC’s signature song and earned two Grammy nominations. More hits like “It’s Gonna Be Me”—the group’s only No. 1 song on the Billboard 100—and “This I Promise You” helped solidify them as one of the most popular boy bands in music history.\n\nCelebrity, the band’s third and final album, quickly followed. The 2001 release produced three more hit singles—“Pop,” “Gone,” and “Girlfriend”—as well as two more Grammy nods. Their ensuing PopOdyssey tour became one of the biggest tours of the year, earning $90 million.\n\nJustin Timberlake, center, reunited with the other members of *NSYNC at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards in September.\n\nAs big as *NSYNC was, the group went on indefinite hiatus in 2002 when Timberlake decided to pursue a solo career. However, the group hasn’t fallen into obscurity. *NSYNC performed at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2018. Then, in September 2023, Timberlake and his former bandmates surprised fans by reuniting again at the VMAs to present the Best Pop Award to Taylor Swift and, in the process, stoking speculation they might collaborate again.\n\nThose suspicions were proven true, as the group performed the song “Better Place” for the soundtrack of the 2023 animated movie Trolls Band Together. It marked their first project together in two decades. Bass hinted in a November 2023 interview that *NSYNC could work again. “I don’t see this as our last thing,” he said.\n\nSolo Career: Songs, Albums, and Super Bowl Performances\n\nIn 2002, Timberlake embarked on his solo career, debuting with the hit song “Like I Love You.” Later that year, he released his first solo album, Justified, which also featured the hits “Cry Me a River” and “Rock Your Body.” The album sold more than 7 million copies worldwide and earned Timberlake his first two Grammy Awards in 2004. Justified won Best Pop Vocal Album, and “Cry Me a River” bested the competition for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.\n\nJanet Jackson and Justin Timberlake perform the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show before Jackson’s infamous wardrobe malfunction.\n\nThe wins came on the heels of a controversial Super Bowl performance in February 2004 with Janet Jackson, in which Timberlake accidentally tore off a portion of Jackson’s costume, revealing her bare breast. The wardrobe malfunction remains one of the most infamous pop culture moments of the 21st century and even spawned a 2021 New York Times documentary.\n\nBut the controversy didn’t tarnish Timberlake’s reputation as an in-demand pop and R&B artist. He frequently collaborated with Timbaland and the Black Eyed Peas, receiving a Grammy nomination with the band for “Where Is The Love?” He also worked with Nelly, Snoop Dogg, and Nelly Furtado.\n\nA year after he started the record company JayTee Records in 2005, Timberlake released his second album. FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006) debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and was later nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards. The album’s lead single, “SexyBack,” spent consecutive weeks as the No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100. Some of the album’s other hit tracks included “My Love,” “What Goes Around Comes Around,” and “LoveStoned/I Think She Knows.” Timberlake collected four more Grammys for each of the songs.\n\nIn 2008, Timberlake helped make Madonna’s single “4 Minutes” a Top 10 hit. Not only did he provide complementary vocals, but he was also a co-writer of the song. Timberlake additionally contributed to several other tracks on Madonna’s Hard Candy album.\n\nHis next big song was also a collaboration. Timberlake returned to the music scene in January 2013 with the hit single “Suit & Tie” featuring Jay-Z. The duo performed the song at the 2013 Grammy Awards ceremony, plus Timberlake sang another new song “Pusher Love Girl.” Both won the pop star more Grammy trophies before appearing on his long-awaited third album The 20/20 Experience, released that March. Like FutureSex/LoveSounds, the record reached the top of the Billboard 200 in its first week.\n\nTimberlake continued to enjoy this wave of success in August 2013 when he picked up the VMA Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. That October, Timberlake released a companion album: The 20/20 Experience Part 2 of 2. The follow-up album didn’t achieve the same critical acclaim as its predecessor, though it still debuted at No. 1 and produced the popular songs “Take Back the Night” and “TKO.”\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Timberlake released “Can’t Stop the Feeling,” the lead single from the Trolls movie soundtrack. The song went straight to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as in 16 other countries. It also earned Timberlake his 10th Grammy Award, this time for Best Song Written For Visual Media, and an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn January 2018, Timberlake dropped the first single from his upcoming studio album, a slow bedroom number titled “Filthy.” He followed later in the month with the Top 10 hit “Say Something,” featuring Chris Stapleton. The album titled Man of the Woods, an uneven effort that included collaborations with Timbaland and Pharrell Williams, was released shortly before the Timberlake’s performance at the Super Bowl LII halftime show in early February.\n\nThe Super Bowl gig generated controversy well before Timberlake took the stage, with the hashtag #JusticeForJanet circulating on social media among Jackson fans who felt she took the brunt of the fallout from the 2004 Super Bowl show. Furthermore, the rumor that Timberlake planned to perform with a hologram of Prince incited additional backlash, as fans referenced an interview in which the deceased music icon specifically stated his opposition to that sort of special effect.\n\nAfter a relatively quiet period, Timberland briefly resurfaced in 2020 to share new songs from another Trolls movie, with the more successful single being a SZA collaboration called “The Other Side.”\n\nNew Album and 2024 Tour\n\nIn late January 2024, Timberlake released his song “Selfish” and announced a new album called Everything I Thought It Was. His first record in six years, the project released on March 15, 2024. During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the singer said he and his collaborators wrote almost 100 songs before narrowing it down to 18 tracks for Everything I Thought It Was.\n\nHis accompanying tour, titled The Forget Tomorrow World Tour, began in late April in Vancouver, Canada. Timberlake announced more than 70 dates across North America, the United Kingdom, and Europe.\n\nIn mid-June, Timberlake made headlines amid his tour when police arrested the singer following a traffic stop on New York’s Long Island. He has been charged with driving while intoxicated but was released from custody following an arraignment.\n\nMovies\n\nNot content as a major musician, Timberlake has used his performance skills onscreen as an actor. His early parts in the 2006 movies Alpha Dog and Black Snake Moan garnered little notice, but he started to find traction that year as a host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live. His routines and comedic timing made him a fan-favorite host and earned him two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, in 2009 and 2011. (His SNL performances have also won him two Emmy trophies for Outstanding Original Music And Lyrics.)\n\nOn the silver screen, Timberlake first hit it big as the voice of a young King Arthur in the 2007 smash-hit animated movie Shrek the Third, which featured Mike Myers as the title character. Other work soon followed as Timberlake teamed up with Myers once again for the 2008 comedy The Love Guru. The certified triple threat next had a role in the drama The Open Road (2009), with Jeff Bridges and Mary Steenburgen.\n\nOne of Timberlake’s most notable performances was in 2010’s The Social Network, the Oscar-winning drama about the creation of Facebook. Timberlake played real-life internet tycoon Sean Parker, opposite Jesse Eisenberg’s leading role as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. In 2011, Timberlake starred in the comedy Bad Teacher with Cameron Diaz, the rom-com Friends with Benefits with Mila Kunis, and the futuristic thriller In Time with Amanda Seyfried.\n\nHe went on to appear in Clint Eastwood’s 2012 baseball drama Trouble with the Curve and also enjoyed a leading role in the 2013 thriller Runner Runner with Ben Affleck. Keeping in stride with his string of more serious roles, Timberlake took on the part of Neil Bogart in Inside Llewyn Davis (2013).\n\nNext, he turned to voice work as the character of Branch in the animated movie Trolls (2016). He served as an executive music producer for the film, which has since spawned the sequels Trolls World Tour (2020) and Trolls Band Together (2023). Timberlake has contributed original music to all three movies in the franchise.\n\nElsewhere, Timberlake had the titular role in the 2021 Apple original film Palmer and appeared in the 2022 Netflix film Reptile.\n\nWife Jessica Biel and Kids\n\nJessica Biel and Justin Timberlake, seen here in November 2023, have been married since 2012.\n\nTimberlake is married to actor Jessica Biel. They began dating in 2007 and, after navigating an on-and-off relationship over the course of several years, tied the knot in October 2012. Their wedding was in Puglia, Italy. The couple later issued the following statement to People magazine: “It’s great to be married, the ceremony was beautiful and it was so special to be surrounded by our family and friends.”\n\nTimberlake and Biel have two sons. They welcomed Silas in April 2015, followed by Phineas in summer 2020.\n\nPrior to his relationship with Biel, Timberlake once dated pop singer Britney Spears and actor Cameron Diaz. Spears and Timberlake made headlines once more in October 2023 with the release of her memoir The Woman in Me. In the book, the pop star said she had an abortion after becoming pregnant with Timberlake’s child. “He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young,” she wrote. Timberlake hasn’t said anything publicly about Spears’ book, but a source told Elle that “Justin and Jessica [Biel] just want everyone to grow and evolve instead of continuing to bring up the past.”\n\nNet Worth\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Timberlake has an estimated net worth at around $250 million."
