        "text": "The “Mirrors” musician let go of the lush parcel of land just weeks before his DWI detention on June 18.\n\nGoodbye to Tennessee Real Estate\n\nJustin Timberlake has officially parted ways with a significant piece of Tennessee real estate. The “Mirrors” singer, 43, sold a sprawling 127-acre plot in Franklin, Tenn., for $8 million.\n\nLocated less than half a mile from the rural village of Leipers Fork and about 45 minutes from Nashville, the property offers stunning views of Leipers Creek Valley.\n\nThe land features 50 acres of wildlife food plots and pastures, a fishing pond, spring creeks, and trails. Tom Sullivan of Covey Rise Properties handled the listing.\n\nTimberlake, currently on his Forget Tomorrow World Tour, completed the sale on May 30, as per property records.\n\nA Shared Love for Tennessee\n\nAlso read: Hailey and Justin Bieber’s casual date night\n\nTimberlake, a Memphis native, purchased the land in 2015 from local philanthropist and preservationist Aubrey Preston. Nearly a year after the purchase, Preston told The Tennessean about their mutual admiration for their home state.\n\n“Both of us share that love of Tennessee and enjoyed how we grew up, on land,” Preston said. “We want to do our part to save that for future generations, and our kids. That’s how we got to know each other.”\n\nLegal Troubles in New York\n\nThe sale of the property occurred just weeks before Timberlake encountered legal troubles in Sag Harbor, N.Y. On June 18, he was arrested for allegedly driving while intoxicated.\n\nTimberlake was on his way to a friend’s house from the American Hotel when he was pulled over by a Sag Harbor police officer. He was charged with one count of DWI and received two citations: one for running a stop sign and another for failure to keep in lane.\n\nA New Chapter\n\nAs Timberlake moves forward, the sale of his Tennessee estate marks the end of an era. Despite recent challenges, the singer remains focused on his music career and continues to tour globally.\n\nThe sale underscores Timberlake’s ongoing commitment to his roots and his efforts to preserve Tennessee’s natural beauty for future generations."
