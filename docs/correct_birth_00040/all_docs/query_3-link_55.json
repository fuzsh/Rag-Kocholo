        "text": "New details have been released surrounding the arrest of famed singer Justin Timberlake and what happened in the moments leading up to it.\n\nAccording to authorities, Timberlake was arrested by police in New York and now faces a DWI, or driving while intoxicated, charge.\n\nThe Sag Harbor Police Department said Timberlake, 43, was pulled over around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday for \"failing to stop at a duly posted stop sign and failing to maintain his lane of travel.\"\n\nHe was stopped by an officer and \"upon investigation it was determined that Mr. Timberlake was operating his vehicle in an intoxicated condition,\" the department said in a release.\n\nA complaint filed in court later Tuesday indicated the officer said Timberlake's eyes were \"bloodshot and glassy\" and a \"strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath.\"\n\n\"He was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot, and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests,\" the complaint read.\n\nAccording to police, Timberlake told the officer, \"I had one martini and I followed my friends home.\"\n\nLocal\n\nHe was arrested, processed and held overnight before being arraigned in court around 9:30 a.m.\n\nThe complaint noted that Timberlake refused a chemical test.\n\nThe rules surrounding a DWI, according to the New York DMV, include a blood alcohol content of .08 or higher \"or other evidence of intoxication.\"\n\nTimberlake was ultimately released on his own recognizance.\n\nThe arrest comes just ahead of Timberlake's scheduled performance in Chicago.\n\nThe former *NSYNC boy band member is scheduled to play at the United Center both Friday and Saturday as part of his \"Forget Tomorrow World Tour.\"\n\nIt's unclear how or if the arrest will impact the shows, however.\n\nNeither the singer nor his representatives could immediately be reached for comment. The United Center also did not immediately respond to NBC Chicago's request for comment."
