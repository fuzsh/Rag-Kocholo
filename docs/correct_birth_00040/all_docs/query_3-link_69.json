He has won numerous awards and accolades, including ten Grammy Awards, four Primetime Emmy Awards, three Brit Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, the Contemporary Icon Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and MTV's Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.\n\nQuick Facts Born, Education ...\n\nClose\n\nBorn and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Timberlake appeared on musical television shows as a child, competing on Star Search; in the early to mid-1990s, he was a main cast member of the Disney Channel's Mickey Mouse Club, performing cover songs and choreography. While on the show, Timberlake worked with future bandmate JC Chasez, as well as future pop cultural figures including Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Keri Russell and Ryan Gosling. Timberlake and Chasez later rose to prominence in late 1997 as the lead vocalists for the boyband NSYNC. The group released four commercially successful studio albums, becoming one of the best-selling boy bands of all time with sales of over 70 million units worldwide.\n\nTimberlake's debut solo album, Justified (2002) yielded his first solo hit singles, \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\". His second album, FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006) reached further success as it debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and spawned three consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: \"SexyBack\" (featuring Timbaland), \"My Love\" (featuring T.I.) and \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\". Established as a solo artist worldwide, his first two albums both exceeded sales of 10 million copies and received triple platinum certification by the RIAA. Meanwhile, Timberlake collaborated with other artists on a string of successful singles, including The Lonely Island's viral hit \"Dick in a Box\" in 2006,[6] his fourth US number-one single with Timbaland's \"Give It to Me\" in 2007, as well as Madonna's \"4 Minutes\", 50 Cent's \"Ayo Technology\" and T.I.'s \"Dead and Gone\" in the following years."
