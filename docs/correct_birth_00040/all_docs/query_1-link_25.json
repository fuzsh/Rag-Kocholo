        "text": "Justin Timberlake has been spared a brush with the law after a picture he posted of himself voting caught the attention of Tennessee authorities.\n\nThe actor and pop star uploaded a picture to Instagram of him casting a ballot in Memphis.\n\nIt became illegal to take photos inside polling locations in Tennessee in 2015.\n\nTimberlake flew from Los Angeles to his hometown of Memphis to cast an early ballot ahead of the 8 November election.\n\nHowever, in a second statement, Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich said the initial response was \"incorrect\" and \"released without my knowledge,\" according to Local Memphis, external.\n\n\"I am out of town at a conference. No one in our office is currently investigating this matter nor will we be using our limited resources to do so,\" she said.\n\nTimberlake is one of a few million voters who have cast early ballots in a number of US states.\n\nIn his Instagram caption, the entertainer wrote to his 37 million followers: \"No excuses, my good people!\n\n\"There could be early voting in your town too. If not, November 8th! Choose to have a voice! If you don't, then we can't HEAR YOU! Get out and VOTE!\"\n\nAny charge would have been considered a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail or a fine of $50 (Â£41), or both.\n\nAdam Ghassemi, a spokesman for the Tennessee Secretary of State, said people should only use their phones for help with voting.\n\nBut he added that officials are \"thrilled Justin can't stop the feeling\" - which is a reference to the title of the singer's latest song.\n\nThe singer also took a few moments outside the polling booth to snap some selfies with his fans."
