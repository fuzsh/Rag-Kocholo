        "text": "MEMPHIS, TN (WMC) - Justin Timberlake delivered a heart-felt message of love for Memphis over the weekend.\n\nNow the world is taking note. Monday, the speech was trending worldwide on blogs, magazine websites, and social media.\n\n\"It's not just in the music,\" Timberlake said. \"It's in the people. It's gritty--and we grind here.\"\n\nIn his speech after being inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, Timberlake called Memphis the global capital of soul, and he challenged other Memphians to be unapologetic for who they are.\n\nTimberlake grew up in Shelby Forrest, just around the corner from legendary soul singer Reverend Al Green.\n\nDuring his speech, Timberlake expressed his love for his hometown in an emotional declaration.\n\n\"London ain't got no Gus' Fried chicken,\" said Timberlake.\n\nTimberlake described his induction among countless soul music icons as unconditional recognition.\n\n\"The Grammy's are political. The Emmy's are political. Memphis is not political,\" Timberlake said.\n\nDespite the city's reputation for crime, poverty, and its other short comings, Timberlake chose to use his platform to share his adoration for all things Memphis.\n\nChoose 901 founder John Carroll hopes Timberlake's speech is contagious.\n\n\"I think that locals sometimes forget how great this city is, and it's easy to say the grass is greener on the other side, but any big city you live in you're going to have big city issues,\" Carroll said. \"It's time for us to spend more time looking at all the positives here.\"\n\nTimberlake went on to thank his wife, actress Jessica Biel, for three years of marriage. He also expressed his gratitude to Memphis for keeping him grounded.\n\nCopyright 2015 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved."
