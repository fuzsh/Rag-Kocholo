        "meta_description": "Justin Timberlake is an American singer, songwriter, actor, and producer who first rose to fame as one of the lead singers for the legendary pop group *NSYNC before establishing himself as a top-tier solo artist and versatile entertainer. With his smooth vocals, slick dance moves, and dynamic stage presence, Timberlake has become one of pop music’s most prolific artists and entertainers over the past two decades. \nEarly Life and *NSYNC Justin Randall Timberlake was born in Memphis, Tennessee on January 31, 1981 to Lynn and Randall Timberlake. He was raised as a Baptist and performed often as a child, showcasing his singing talents at local talent shows and in his church choir. When Timberlake was 11, he made an appearance on the talent competition Star Search, performing country music songs. \nIn 1993, Timberlake was recruited to join the new pop group *NSYNC along with members JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone, and Lance Bass. The group shot to stardom in the late 1990s during the boy band craze, selling over 56 million records worldwide thanks largely to Timberlake’s vocals and stage presence. As the group’s popularity skyrocketed, Timberlake’s fame expanded beyond music thanks to appearances on shows like Nickelodeon and work as a model. \nSolo Career – Justified In 2002, Timberlake shocked the music world by announcing he was leaving *NSYNC to pursue a solo music career. Skepticism quickly turned to praise when Timberlake released his debut solo album Justified in November 2002. Fueled by hit singles like “Cry Me a River” and “Rock Your Body,” Justified sold over 7 million copies while showcasing Timberlake’s talents as a songwriter, producer, and arranger. At the Grammys, Timberlake was nominated for Album of the Year and cemented his status as pop music’s newest superstar. \nContinued Music Success in the 2000s On the heels of Justified, Timberlake continued achieving massive success across music, film and business in the 2000s decade. His 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts and contained hit singles like “SexyBack”, “My Love”, and “What Goes Around...Comes Around.” For his dynamic live performances during the FutureSex/LoveSounds tour, Timberlake won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Music Direction and Technical Direction. \nExpanding into movies, Timberlake received praise for supporting roles in films like Alpha Dog, Black Snake Moan, and The Social Network. He also began several business ventures, launching clothing lines, co-owning restaurants, golf courses, and eventually investing in a handful of tech startups. \nAfter a musical hiatus from 2007-2012, Timberlake came back in vintage form with The 20/20 Experience (2013) and The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2 (2013). Together, they became the best-selling albums of the year and contain hit singles like “Suit &amp; Tie” and “Mirrors.” On the back of the 20/20 albums and Experience tour, Timberlake fully re-established himself as an unparalleled force in pop music and live performing. \nContinued Acting, Super Bowl, Man of the Woods Embracing acting roles with equal passion as his music, Timberlake showcased both his comedic and dramatic talents in films ranging from Friends with Benefits (2011), Trouble with Curve (2012), Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) and Runner Runner (2013). \nIn early 2018, Timberlake headlined the Super Bowl LII halftime show, marking his triumphant return to the stage of pop music’s biggest spectacle 14 years after his controversial performance alongside Janet Jackson. The show featured Timberlake flawlessly singing and dancing through his classic catalog of hits both old and new. With the most-watched musical performance of all-time, the Super Bowl show affirmed Timberlake’s status as an immortal pop icon. \nLater in 2018, Timberlake released his fifth studio album Man on the Woods which debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts. Though met with mixed reviews, the album nonetheless contained the hit single “Say Something” and incorporated country and roots influences. The accompanying Man of the Woods tour marked Timberlake’s fifth world tour as he continued showcasing unique musical artistry and exceptional live performance abilities to audiences worldwide. \nActing Successes and Super Bowl Return Throughout the late 2010s and early 2020s, Timberlake expanded his acting catalog by starring in films ranging from light-hearted comedies like Trolls (2016), to lead dramatic roles in Palmer (2021). His vocal performances in multiple Trolls movie soundtracks generated smash hits like “CAN’T STOP THE FEELING!” that firmly merged Timberlake’s musical talents with his blossoming acting abilities. \nIn early 2022, Timberlake again seized the global spotlight when he co-headlined the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside Mary J. Blige, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Kendrick Lamar. The hip-hop and R&amp;B-centric performance marked Timberlake’s third Super Bowl appearance, solidifying his unique status as a halftime show mainstay performer. \nLegacy With over 88 million records sold worldwide, an arm-length list of awards, dozens of smash singles, and universal acclaim for electric live performances, Justin Timberlake has firmly established himself as pop royalty over his multi-decade career. By seamlessly crossing over between music and film for two decades, Timberlake has become one of entertainment’s most decorated and versatile stars. His influence across pop, R&amp;B, hip-hop, and acting is nearly unmatched by any male entertainer of his generation. \nFrom leading the pop explosion of 1990s boy bands to dominating the charts as a renowned solo artist, Justin Timberlake has consistently reinvented himself at the cutting edge of entertainment for twenty-plus years. With his smooth voice, slick moves, unmatched stage charisma and diverse talents ranging from singing to acting, Timberlake delivers a level of popstar power matched only by luminaries like Michael Jackson and Prince. Though still actively recording music and starring in films at just 42 years old, Timberlake’s vast career ensures enduring fame as one of history’s preeminent entertainers.
