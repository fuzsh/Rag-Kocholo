        "text": "var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([’embed’]);\n\nJustin Timberlake took a selfie Monday while voting early in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nJustin Timberlake broke the law.\n\nTaking pictures at polling places is against the law in a number of states, including Tennessee, according to Us Weekly.\n\nThe 35-year-old posted a picture of himself casting his ballot to social media, with the caption “Hey! You! Yeah, YOU! I just flew from LA to Memphis to #rockthevote.,” He also wrote “There could be early voting in your town too. If not, November 8th! Choose to have a voice! If you don’t, then we can’t HEAR YOU! Get out and VOTE! #exerciseyourrighttovote.”\n\nHe means well. Then again, is there a celebrity alive who can resist doing anything of note without having to take their own picture?\n\nThe Shelby County District Attorney’s Office communications director Vince Higgins told Us Weekly the department “was made aware of a possible violation of election law. The matter is under review by the D.A.’s office.” Offenders could face a 30-day jail sentence and a fine of $50.\n\nHe could probably handle the fine.\n\nThe law, which came into being in May 2015, says that voters may use their phones at polling stations for “informational purposes to assist the voter in making election decisions.” But taking photos or videos is a no-no.\n\nIt’s not clear who JT voted for. but his wife, Jessica Biel, attended a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in August."
