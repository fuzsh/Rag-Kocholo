        "text": "Justin Timberlake has just struck gold in the hot Nashville real estate market, selling a sprawling 127-acre property on the outskirts of the city for a cool $8 million.\n\nTimberlake, 43, bid “Bye Bye Bye” to the land at the end of May, despite it fetching $2 million less than his original asking price from last summer. However, the savvy singer still managed to double his investment, having bought it for $4 million in 2015.\n\nThe sale closed just weeks before Timberlake’s headline-making DWI arrest in the Hamptons.\n\nNashville’s real estate scene has been booming, driven by an influx of newcomers from cities like Los Angeles. Luxury homes around the metro area have seen median sale prices soar to nearly $1.7 million in the first quarter of this year, marking an 8% annual increase, according to Redfin.\n\nTimberlake, a Tennessee native and former ‘N Sync heartthrob, utilized a trust for his purchase, with an accountant tied to other Timberlake ventures listed as trustee, according to The Sun, which was the first to report on the sale.\n\nNeither the trustee nor the listing agent, Tom Sullivan of Covey Rise Properties, responded to requests for comment. The new owner is listed as a limited liability company.\n\nLocated near the village of Leiper’s Fork, the parcel is protected against development and boasts a spring-fed fishing pond, miles of trails, pastures, spring creeks, and hunting opportunities.\n\nTimberlake’s ties to the area run deep; he’s been involved in local events and businesses, including the Pilgrimage Music and Cultural Festival.\n\nThis sale coincides with Timberlake’s struggles to sell out tickets for his Forget Tomorrow World Tour.\n\nAnnounced on Jimmy Fallon’s late-night show in January, the tour has seen sluggish sales, with thousands of tickets still available for upcoming dates in Chicago and New York.\n\nDespite this, the tour has already grossed $140 million, though some of this might be jeopardized following Timberlake’s recent arrest.\n\nThe DWI incident occurred on a Monday, with Timberlake reportedly lamenting to the arresting officer, “This is going to ruin the tour.” The officer, seemingly unaware of Timberlake’s celebrity status, asked him what tour he was referring to. Timberlake replied, “The world tour.”\n\nAdding to his financial ventures, Timberlake still holds property debt on his Hollywood Hills home, which he listed for $35 million in 2021 before pulling it off the market. He’s owned the mansion since purchasing it from actress Helen Hunt for $8.3 million in 2002. Timberlake and his wife, Jessica Biel, also sold their Tribeca penthouse for $29 million in 2022.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Timberlake has apologized to his tour team and assured them that no dates will be canceled."
