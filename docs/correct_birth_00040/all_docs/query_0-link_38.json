        "text": "Justin Timberlake is going home to Memphis.\n\nThe Tennessee-born pop star has announced a rare, intimate and free concert on Jan. 19 at Memphis' Orpheum Theatre.\n\nThe surprise concert, which was announced Friday on Timberlake's social media accounts, is believed to potentially be part of the announcement and promotion of new music from the singer.\n\nA message on his website reads: \"Justin Timberlake is performing for one night only in Memphis.\" A website directs fans to Ticketmaster, where they can register for free for seats until Monday, Jan. 15, at 10:59 p.m. CT. Those who win tickets for the show will be confirmed on Jan. 18.\n\nIn his Instagram post, the *NSYNC singer also shared a video of himself pointing to the Memphis skyline when he was a child. \"This is where I come from,\" the young Timberlake says in the clip.\n\nAccording to Ticketmaster, \"Tickets are free, non-transferable and must be picked up with a matching ID at the venue on the night of the show. There is a two ticket limit per person. Note: These are not guaranteed.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Timberlake scrubbed his Instagram as a part of what appeared to be a reset ahead of a new project from the singer. His last album was 2018’s “Man of the Woods.” Timberlake last performed in Memphis at the FedExForum in January 2019.\n\nTimberlake had a fairly quiet 2023, performing just twice publicly. He made a splash, however, by reuniting with his boy band NSYNC last September at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards. Shortly thereafter, the group released its first new song in 20 years, \"Better Place,\" for the soundtrack of \"Trolls Band Together.\"\n\nContributing: Brendan Morrow, USA TODAY"
