        "text": "An extroverted intuitive (to use C.G. Jung’s terms), Justin Timberlake is open to the reality of the world, objects, and others. He has a special duality to his mind, which is made up of equal parts of intellectual resources and sensitivity, giving him great intuition and humanism. As a function of this latter, he has a great sense of his fellow human and the oracular art of divining people’s unconscious wishes and motivations – in fact, his advice is often sought. In material terms, it gives him a talent for locating lost objects and a spirit of discovery and invention. Overall, he welcomes the signs arriving from the outer world in a positive and liberal way and even incite them to promise more than they can provide. However, when something does not satisfy him, he has the ability to cheer himself up rapidly and is quick to discover whatever positive aspects it may present. This involves a process of readaptation which requires formidable ego transformations, and they are the challenge for him. It is up to him to renew himself, to behave in such a way as to drain his environment of fearsome or threatening aspects.\n\nHe is usually perceived as an idealist. Deep within himself, he senses the presence of a “new life.” It is the crucible of his ideal and all his hopes. The “new life” may assume the garb of various philosophies of liberation; whatever they may be, they all endeavor to revitalize alienated modern people, oppressed and downtrodden by Western civilization. However, in his striving to free himself and his fellow humans from a social contract based on the power of sheer lucre and corrupt lobbies, he displays a singular inclination to depend upon the very social forces he intends to topple. The reason for this is that, because he is quite sociable, the only thing he instinctively grasp profoundly is social action and organization. His perception of his own personality is vague or even negative. In fact, his grandiose personal gestures are motivated by a need to hide his unavowed feelings of inferiority and, at times, his fear of strong personalities. But he is above all an idealist. Hope is the prime mover of his spirit, and he is continually traveling along the axis of the hope/despair polarity. As he applies himself to ignoring whatever is impervious to his aspirations, he should acquire some certainty of what is still possible – for him and the world. In fact, in relation to his ideal, he behaves realistically, although others are unable to perceive his realism because he expressed himself in such an unconventional and eccentric fashion.\n\nHe is passionately committed to the quest and research he has initiated and will pursue it with determination if not fury. He judges and defines himself in opposition to society, and human relations are vital to the evolution of his personality. An elitist, he does not believe in human equality, preferring individuality. He seeks a way to unite them without abolishing their differences. He would like to create a utopian community with no ideological imperatives, a self-ruled entity which would recognize its own spirit as the only authority. His definition of friendship is spiritual love, because it establishes a subtle, vast, and delicate web of bonds, not only between people, but between people and things. He imagines a vow of true friendship as a form of freedom which reassures the freedom of others, instead of threatening it. However, he should become aware that this ideal harmony, which is often rather difficult to put into practice, sometimes hides an unavowed fear of deep commitment to another person. For this reason, his love life is among the more erratic.\n\nWarm and giving to the world in general, in certain special cases he may become cold or even distant. He is determined to elude any perceived threat to his freedom and pick his way through a world of paradoxes and contradictions. His sensuality is associated with his imagination, and he loves people not for what they are in reality, but for the way his imagination transfigures them. The result is disillusionment. But when he falls in love, it’s for real.\n\nJustin Timberlake tends to place his emotions in the forefront. He is sensitive and sometimes vulnerable to influences from the outer world.\n\nJustin Timberlake has a sense of selfless duty and devotion. Work is one of the most important aspects of life for Justin Timberlake.\n\nAt the time of Justin Timberlake’s birth, his rising sign was located in Virgo (the Virgin), while the sun was passing through the sign of Aquarius (the Water Bearer). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide his personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of his character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\nModesty – Independence – Analytical thought – Rebelliousness – Strict logic – Originality – Attention to detail – Fluctuation – Perfectionism – Irritability – Worry and anxiety – Inventive spirit – Nervousness – Sense of paradox.\n\nHe has a paradoxical nature which hosts two antinomic and conflicting tendencies at opposite poles from one another. As a result, he swings from rebellion against authority to submissiveness, from kookiness to convention. He is methodical at times and chaotic at others, shy on some days and eccentric on others.\n\nDespite this complex psychological structure, his analytical intelligence and inventive spirit have great potential. As he matures, he should attain a harmonious synthesis and balanced coordination between the conflicting tendencies. When he learns to control his nervousness, his lifestyle choices should come together nicely.\n\nBorn in the seven to ten days after the full moon rose, Justin Timberlake is of the “last quarter” lunar type. As a result, his personality is fairly independent and self-sufficient. His ideas are original and often bold, but, to his dismay, do not often garner a majority of followers.\n\nHis sense of humor is his best communications tool, but he often switches to a more severe tone which breaks his charm over his audience, and his methods do not always please the masses.\n\nHis lack of flexibility hinders his strategies and projects, and he would gain by developing his sense of diplomacy and tact. Although he is not unduly attached to success, because he is so used to being ahead of his time, his failures take a psychological toll on him. Because each setback wears him down a little more, he should try to avoid further disappointments by conforming to contemporary reality a little more closely.\n\nJustin Timberlake’s sun is located at 12° AQUARIUS. His drive for psycho-sexual fulfillment would best be aroused by a person whose Moon is at 6/18° AQUARIUS or LEO.\n\nThis relationship could yield a high degree of psychological compatibility and powerful mutual attraction. The physical and psychological reality of Justin Timberlake’s personality will exert a magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of his partner.\n\nJustin Timberlake’s moon is located at 25° SAGITTARIUS. Justin Timberlake’s ideal match is a partner with the sun at 20/30° SAGITTARIUS or GEMINI.\n\nJustin Timberlake would be particularly well-matched to someone who mirrors his underlying psychic and unconscious aspirations. The secret ideal he cherishes of the perfect partner would be aroused; it would harmonize beautifully with his ideal imaginary lover. This great psychic compatibility is the result of a harmonious relationship between the Moon of the masculine chart and the sun of the feminine one. It is propitious to a rich flow of energies between the most hidden and secret parts of both people. They are linked by an unconscious emotional bond.\n\nJustin’s Venus is located at 26° CAPRICORN. His ideal match is a partner with Mars at 20/30° CAPRICORN or CANCER.\n\nThis type of partner would complement Justin Timberlake perfectly in emotional and sentimental terms. This person would reflect and fulfill Justin’s ideal of sensuality to the greatest degree. Moreover, Justin’s ideal partner would resonate lastingly with his own psychic projections of his ideal. This positive relationship between the unconscious sexual yearnings of both partners would be likely to yield sensual relations of a tantalizingly mysterious and secret nature.\n\nJustin Timberlake has a raw sensitivity and tries to protect himself by adopting a somewhat reserved and distant attitude. Cautious and a bit wary about committing himself to an amorous relationship, he cannot relax his inhibitions unless he feels completely safe. Once he’s in love, he is both passionate and cold, demanding and devoted, possessive but reasonable. He does not readily express his affections in public and may have a fairly practical, down-to-earth attitude toward the relationship. He would be well-matched with such a partner who is serious and in control of themselves. Because this person, too, is wary of being disappointed, they will not engage in an intimate relationship without clear knowledge that their budding feelings are reciprocated. However, once they make their mind up, they will be extremely faithful, affectionate, and tender.\n\nPlanet Mars is located at 25° AQUARIUS. Justin’s ideal match is a partner with Venus at 20/30° AQUARIUS or LEO."
