        "text": "The 9:01 is a daily column on all things Memphis.\n\nGood morning in Memphis, where a Citizen rises over Midtown, but first &mldr;\n\nOl’ Tennessee Timberlake: Confess Your Unpopular Opinion: I never thought Justin Timberlake owed Memphis anything. Timberlake’s family home may have been in Millington, north of the city, but his music was never really born or bred here. It came from nowhere. (Ok, Orlando. Same difference.) It was a product of the pop industrial complex, a homestead built somewhere along the journey from Mickey Mouse Club to Michael Jackson.\n\nMore: Memphis Music 2018: Justin Timberlake, Lucero, Liz Brasher among the year's expected big releases\n\nTimberlake may have been the biggest “Memphis” star since Elvis, but Elvis abandoning Graceland for La La Land permanence would have shaken the city. Timberlake had no Graceland to leave. If Memphis had been rendered no more than a biographical footnote in Timberlake’s story, no one would have raised an eyebrow.\n\nSo Timberlake keeping a toe in the Mississippi River waters was a bonus. His Millington golf excursion. His tequila with a familiar numerical moniker. His supporting role in Craig Brewer’s “Black Snake Moan.” His failed bid to take Memphis band FreeSol national. His Memphis Grizzlies ownership stake and public role in Marc Gasol and Mike Conley’s free agent courtship. His south of the Mississippi line tour prep. His mammoth Memphis Music Hall of Fame induction speech. All gravy.\n\nWhen Timberlake got married, had a kid, and acquired an estate in the Nashville area, it was akin to settling down and moving out to the suburbs. Some in Memphis may have resented it, but Timberlake’s not here for the Memphis-Nashville rivalry. He named his band and fan club the Tennessee Kids. He wants to be a uniter, not a divider. (Show up at a Predators or Titans game, fine. But you start wearing Vol orange instead of Tiger blue, we might have to talk.) The other thing is this: Nashville is on America’s modern Mt. Rushmore of recording centers, with New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Memphis is a great music city too, but it’s comps are more Austin and New Orleans. It’s trad-cool, not titan of industry. It’s a different lane. Which brings us to this teaser, released yesterday, for Timberlake’s new album, due next month:\n\nI mean, let’s just acknowledge upfront that this is achingly close to a “Saturday Night Live” parody video, Timberlake running away from (not with) horses and auditioning for the Robert Redford role in a remake of mountain man movie \"Jeremiah Johnson.\" Or maybe that’s not the Robert he has in mind. Has Timberlake been reading Robert Bly?\n\nIt presages a country album, or “country” album, and if some even beyond the Memphis-Nashville nexus have taken this as another kind of betrayal, I take it as a logical next step. We all knew it was coming. Timberlake didn’t just move to Nashville, he started collaborating with Chris Stapleton and Little Big Town. (Bob Mehr has more on this and other Memphis-related records on the horizon.)\n\nMaybe Hank wouldn’t have done it this way, but the reason Nashville is what it still is as a music center is because country has always evolved as pop music and is now one of the steadier forces in a volatile market. Country fans still buy music, even the kind you hold in your hands.\n\nIn terms of sound, country is where non-heavy, mainstream rock has gone to survive a kind of musical nuclear winter. (Half the American radio rock acts of the 1980s would be considered “country” today.) In terms of content, it’s the only pop genre that routinely embraces the married-with-kids domesticity that’s Timberlake’s new reality and apparent theme. In a youth-centric pop world, country has become a refuge for all kinds of artists who wouldn’t have seemed to fit in an earlier age. (Taylor Swift is the maybe the only one who took it the other direction, and she’ll be back.) And mainstream country is no longer untouched by sounds and styles from elsewhere. How big of a difference is there, really, between Timberlake and hip-hop-influenced country star Sam Hunt?\n\nTimberlake doing a “country” album? Of course he is. And, hey, I guess The 9:01 can’t fully speak for the city, but if you want to go deeper into the woods and record an analog “Americana” album, Sun and Sam Phillips are always here for you, JT. You want to lace up some Memphis horns for a soul-driven project, Royal will open its door.\n\nBut here’s the thing about that video: “This album is really inspired by &mldr;. more so than any other album I’ve every written, where I’m from.” It’s not just that those snow-covered fields and snow-capped mountains and horses running free (I guess “Man of the Pasture” didn’t quite have the same ring) do not suggest “Memphis.” They don’t suggest Nashville either.\n\nHere’s a headline: Justin Timberlake reveals new Montana-inspired album.\n\nNashville: Is JT cheating on you already?\n\nLast Look at the Liberty Bowl:\n\nKnowledge Bowl Recap - Brighton 210, Kingsbury 40:\n\nDue to the holiday hiatus, we’re a couple of weeks behind on Knowledge Bowl recaps. We’ll do one today and one tomorrow. This first-round match aired the Saturday before Christmas, pitting the Brighton Cardinals from Tipton County against the Kingsbury Falcons of northeast Memphis.\n\nKingsbury was lead by senior salutatorian and drama club president Miriam, who would have gotten double points from me for coming up with the answer “commensalism.\" Other Falcons on this year’s squad were senior captain and valedictorian Chanteria, who’s Vanderbilt-bound; ukulele-playing sophomore Lydia, and senior tennis captain and Memphis Youth Symphony bassist Zavon.\n\nFor the victorious Cardinals, senior returnee Hayden was the game’s top individual scorer and most stylish competitor, with a red, snowflake-laced Christmas sweater. Speaking of which, Hayden is a Christmas music enthusiast who has a pet mouse named Nigel. Senior captain Tanner, a mountain climber and member of the robotics team, also had a strong game. Rounding out the Brighton team were senior mathlete Samantha and junior flautist Dustie.\n\nAs far as I know, this was the first time I’ve ever figured in a Knowledge Bowl question: “Name one of the five best Memphis soul songs according to a recent article by the Commercial Appeal’s Chris Herrington?” Anyone? Bueller? This drew crickets from the kids, which means not only did they not read my piece but they couldn’t name a Memphis soul song. More evidence we need a Memphis music history class in our schools. I do appreciate the excuse to throw out another link to the list though.\n\nBrighton moves on to the second round, where they will face the winner of MUS vs. Covington, which we'll recap tomorrow.\n\nQuick-and-Pop:\n\nIt was a close call in Los Angeles late last night, but the Grizzlies pulled out a narrow loss to the Clippers, gaining a game not only on their former playoff rival but, more importantly, on the Phoenix Suns and Charlotte Hornets, who failed to lose. This leaves the Grizzlies tied for third (with Orlando) in the race for draft lottery positioning.\n\nToo soon?\n\nAdditional Reading:\n\nI enjoyed this Memphis magazine essay from Anna Traverse on Village Creek State Park, near Wynne, Arkansas, the state park of my childhood which I revisited with my own family for a weekend cabin stay a few years ago. This makes me want to go back and explore the Military Road Trail.\n\nThe Towery Building at Union and McLean, where I once worked, is finally gone, and Thursday will be the groundbreaking for the new mixed-use development that going up there, which now has a name: \"The Citizen.\" We're still mulling over how we feel about that.\n\nRhodes College's Charles Hughes launched a fun blog project yesterday, The '68 Comeback Special, where he'll write about albums released in 1968, each on the 50th anniversary of their release. Memphis bats leadoff in the form of a diminishing-returns Elvis comp. (Speaking of music/year related blog projects, I've got one I've been haphazardly pursuing. My own shorter take on 1968, from last summer.\n\nThe Fadeout:\n\nWe've goofed on JT a little today, but he's made lots of really good records, and will likely continue to do so. (Of course we want to hear \"Man of the Woods.\") So we'll go out with one of the best ones:\n\nReach Chris Herrington at chris.herrington@commercialappeal.com or on Twitter at @chrisherrington and @herringtonNBA."
