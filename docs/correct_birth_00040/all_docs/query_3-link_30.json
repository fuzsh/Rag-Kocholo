        "text": "Timberlake, Justin\n\nJanuary 31, 1981 • Memphis, Tennessee\n\nSinger, songwriter\n\nIn late 2002 Justin Timberlake managed to make the leap that many young stars never accomplish—the leap from teen idol to full-fledged, adult artist. In the late 1990s, he was one-fifth of the wildly popular boy band 'N Sync, considered to be the cute, funny one, and a headline maker thanks mostly to his on-again, off-again romance with pop princess Britney Spears. But, having hit the ripe old age of twenty-one, Timberlake decided to leave the safety of his supergroup to launch a solo career. His debut CD, called Justified, was released in December of 2002, and its funky mix of hip-hop and R&B clicked with both old fans and new. More importantly, Timberlake gained the respect of critics and peers. In 2003 he took home several awards for his freshman effort, including three MTV Video Music Awards, and in February of 2004, Timberlake snagged two Grammies, considered the highest achievement in the music industry. It seemed the pop idol had grown up, and as Jenny Eliscu commented in Rolling Stone, Timberlake \"attained the one thing he wanted more than anything else: credibility.\"\n\nFrom singing toddler to Mouseketeer\n\nJustin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee, considered to be the home of the blues and the birthplace of rock and roll. From the very beginning, Timberlake's mother, Lynne, knew her son would be a performer. He was dancing along to the radio when he was just a toddler, and by the age of two and a half, Timberlake (nicknamed Curly) could sing in perfect harmony. As Timberlake later recalled in a Time for Kids interview, \"Ever since I was a little boy I always sang. So I figured out that was sort of my calling.\"\n\nWhen Timberlake was three his parents divorced. He remained friends with his father, but he grew up with his mother and his stepfather, Paul Harless, who Lynne married when Timberlake was five years old. Young Justin was, and is, extremely close to his mother. In fact, he has a small tattoo on his back of an angel holding a banner that bears her initials. In addition, Lynne later became her son's manager. Timberlake started out singing in the church choir; he began his stage career by performing in countless local talent contests. In 1992, after several years of voice lessons, he appeared on Star Search, a televised tournament-style talent competition that helped launched the careers of many top entertainers. The eleven-year-old sang under the name of Justin Randall, and although he received high marks from the judges, he did not win the contest.\n\n\"I know people have an image of me in their head, but I want them to be able to see past that. I want them to see the musicality of what I'm doing.\"\n\nTimberlake was not discouraged. He continued to make the rounds of auditions, and in 1993, at age twelve, he landed a spot on The Mickey Mouse Club, a half-hour show for kids that blended singing, dancing, and comedy sketches. Competition to be a Mouseketeer was high, considering thousands of hopefuls tried out for the show, and Timberlake was thrilled to be added to the program. He and his mother moved to Orlando, Florida, where the series was produced, and for two years he appeared as a regular along with fellow cast members, including up-and-coming stars, Britney Spears (1981–), Christina Aguilera (1980–), and future bandmate Joshua Scott (J. C.) Chasez (1976–). When the show was cancelled in 1994, Timberlake was disappointed, but he already had his sights on his next move. He and Chavez had been contacted by a young singer named Christopher Kirkpatrick (1971–) who had seen them on Mickey Mouse and now wondered if the two ex-Mouseketeers would be interested in joining a band he was putting together. Timberlake and Chavez joined forces with Kirkpatrick, Joseph (Joey) Fatone (1977–), and Jason Allen Alexander (1981–) to become one of the most successful pop groups ever, 'N Sync.\n\nThe Justin Timberlake Foundation\n\nPop idol Justin Timberlake may spend his money freely on clothes, cars, and plenty of bling, but he is also committed to helping youngsters fulfill their dreams. In 2000 Timberlake established the Justin Timberlake Foundation, with the goal of funding and supporting music programs in public schools. As the performer told Time for Kids, \"This is about an opportunity that every young person should enjoy, no matter what career they aspire to. I want to do everything I can to make sure other people can benefit from music education.\" In May of 2000, the foundation's first grant was awarded to Timberlake's own Memphis elementary school, E. E. Jeeter. In addition to money, the pop performer donates his time to help schools integrate music into the curriculum. He also helps others raise funds for what he considers to be an important initiative. For example, the foundation regularly auctions off items online, including Timber-lake concert tickets and some of the star's own belongings, such as his sneakers.\n\nIn 2002, the Timberlake Foundation joined forces with the American Music Conference (AMC), a national, nonprofit organization, which according to its Web site at http://www.amc-music.org, is \"dedicated to promoting the importance of music, music-making, and music education to the general public.\" That same year, Timberlake partnered with AMC to urge Congress to support music education in U.S. schools. Thanks to Timberlake's involvement, millions of people visited the AMC Web site, kids and adults wrote letters to their congressmen, and by late 2002, Timberlake's mother, Lynn Harless, delivered a petition containing thousands of signatures to Capitol Hill. As Timberlake explained on the AMC Web site: \"The main purpose of this petition drive is to show the people on Capitol Hill how important music education is to the people they're working for. The publicity that surrounded the petition has reached millions of people and gotten them talking. I think we've laid a foundation for more public activism in the future, and I hope people start in their own home towns.\"\n\nBoy band history\n\nThe five young men formed instant friendships and it was clear that their harmonizing styles blended together perfectly. As a result, because they were so in sync, Timberlake's mother came up with the band's appropriate name. In addition, 'N Sync was formed from the last letter of each member's first name (Justin, Chris, Joey, Jason, and J. C.). When Lance Bass (1979–) replaced Jason Allen, the boys jokingly called him Lansten so he would fit into the group's acronym. In need of financial backing, the band turned to Lou Pearlman of the Trans Continental management company. Pearlman quickly put the boys in touch with Johnny and Donna Wright, who became 'N Sync's tour managers. The Wrights were music veterans with just the right experience; they had previously managed 1980's teen heartthrobs New Kids on the Block, and they had recently helped form the Back-street Boys, another five-member teen vocal combo, and one that would be constantly compared to 'N Sync.\n\nThe rest is boy band history. 'N Sync began by touring extensively in Europe where they honed their vocals and on-stage choreography. In 1998 they released their self-titled debut album in the United States, as well as a Christmas album, Home for Christmas, and for the next three years they topped the pop charts, packed stadiums, and sold millions of records. Critics generally dismissed them as cookie-cutter bland, but millions of fans, most of them pre-teen girls, gobbled up everything 'N Sync. They plastered their walls with posters, bought 'N Sync dolls, bopped to dance numbers, such as \"I Want You Back,\" and swooned over sugary-sweet ballads, including \"God Must Have Spent a Little More Time On You.\" Thousands of Web sites and fan magazines popped up overnight and every girl had a favorite band member. Timberlake, in particular, was a fan favorite, perhaps because he was the youngest of the group. Or, maybe because of his much publicized relationship with Britney Spears, which made for constant tabloid fodder.\n\nIn 1999, after a bitter dispute, the band broke from Pearlman, who was accused of mismanaging funds. 'N Sync signed with Jive Records, and released two more albums: No Strings Attached (2000), which broke industry records when it sold 2.4 million copies in its first week of release, and Celebrity (2001), a blend of electronica, R&B (Rhythm and Blues), and country. The \"boys\" were definitely growing up, taking control, and proving that they had true staying power. They were also branching out on projects of their own. Bass and Fatone were acting in TV, film, and theater, Kirkpatrick launched a clothing line, and Chasez wrote and produced tracks for other recording artists. In 2001, however, when they officially took time out from the band to pursue individual ventures, Timberlake was the first to release a solo album.\n\nJustin is justified\n\nIn interviews Timberlake reported that he wanted to do a solo record because he needed the freedom to express himself. He also claimed that the impetus was the breakup of his almost four-year relationship with Spears. \"It was angst in the form of heartbreak,\" he told Jon Wiederhorn of MTV.com. \"Writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal with things. It was like a whole big spa treatment.\" Timberlake had the emotion, he had the singing chops, and he had some writing experience since he had penned several 'N Sync songs, including \"Gone\" and \"Girlfriend.\" But he still needed collaborators, and although he was connected with Jive Records, producers still needed convincing to become connected with the boy with the bubble-gum past.\n\nTimberlake was fortunate to snag some of the biggest names in the business, including Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo of The Neptunes, producers of such hip-hop artists as Jay-Z, Mystikal, and Ludacris; Tim 'Timbaland' Mosely; Andre Harris; and Vidal Davis. Although these industry giants definitely laid the blueprint for the album, and their urban styles are evident in such tracks as \"Nothin' Else\" and \"Last Night,\" Justified was undeniably Timberlake's own. He co-wrote each of the thirteen songs, and he injected his own sense of soul into each and every one. \"As a kid, I gravitated toward Stevie Wonder, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye\" the singer explained to Meredith Lerner of VH1.com, \"and that stuff's still with me.\" By the end of the six weeks of recording, Timberlake's collaborators recognized that talent. As producer Scott Storch told Jon Wiederhorn, \"[Timber-lake] has a passion for classic soul music, and he's learned lots of tricks from back in the day that he's applying to modern music. He's sort of a return to blue-eyed soul.\"\n\nJustified was released in November of 2002, and a nervous Timberlake wondered how it would be received. \"I kind of feel like everybody has their magnifying glasses out,\" he confessed to MTV.com. Critics, however, had nothing but praise for his solo effort. Polly Vernon of the Guardian Unlimited called it \"inventive and instant...a truly great record,\" and described Timberlake's voice as \"honeydipped and sweet.\" Jon Wiederhorn praised, in particular, the track \"Cry Me a River,\" stating that it \"marked [Timberlake's] transformation from doe-eyed teenybopper to pained and relevant singer/song-smith.\" Reviewers also compared Timberlake to a young Michael Jackson (1958–) and many, including Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone, dubbed him the new king of pop.\n\nAll grown up\n\nTimberlake had a whirlwind 2003, which he spent on the road performing and relentlessly promoting his album. In the summer he traveled throughout the United States and Europe with Christina Aguileraas part of the sold-out Justified and Stripped tour. He took a brief break to play a benefit concert in Toronto, Canada, sharing the stage with such legendary bands as the Rolling Stones, AC/DC, the Guess Who, and Rush. Timberlake was also a regular on the talk-show circuit and continued to make headlines, not as Britney Spears's boyfriend, but as the most popular performer of the moment. It seemed every move he made hit the news: he hosted Saturday Night Live in October of 2003, became part-owner of a Los Angeles-based restaurant in November of 2003, and of course his love life was not off limits. The twenty-two-year-old was romantically linked with actress Cameron Diaz (1972–), who is nine years his senior.\n\nTimberlake also popped up on every music industry awards show imaginable, from the MTV Video Music Awards to the MTV Europe Music Awards to the American Music Awards, where he took home the prize for favorite pop album of the year. In February of 2004 the new solo artist even landed two surprise Grammy wins, including best pop vocal album and best male pop vocal performance for \"Cry Me a River.\" In the latter category, he was up against such music mainstays as Sting (1951–), Michael McDonald (1952–), and George Harrison (1943–2001). Timberlake's Grammy glory was almost over-shadowed by an event that took place earlier in the month: while performing with Janet Jackson (1966–) during halftime at Super Bowl XXXVIII, Timberlake stunned audiences when he yanked off the top of Jackson's outfit. Both artists later apologized and reported that it was a mistake caused by a costume malfunction.\n\nBy the end of 2004, there was no rest for Timberlake. When he did manage to take a few days off he went traveling with girlfriend Diaz, or headed to Memphis, where his parents still live in the brick Tudor-style house Timberlake grew up in. While there, he hangs out with his dogs Bearlie and Bella, plays pinball and Halo on his Xbox, and hits a few rounds of golf, which is his latest passion. Timberlake was also fielding offers from movie producers, who were keen on tapping into his talent. He signed on to make two movies, slated for released in 2005. The first, called Edison, features Timberlake as a young journalist who teams up with two veteran investigators played by Morgan Freeman (1937–) and Kevin Spacey (1959–). The second movie is Wanna-Be, which will star Timberlake as a college baseball prodigy. Rumors also abounded about whether or not the pop star-turned actor would be joining his 'N Sync bandmates on a new album. Timberlake remained noncommittal, telling the press that he was not sure if he was contractually obligated.\n\nFor More Information\n\nPeriodicals\n\nEliscu, Jenny. \"The New King of Pop.\" Rolling Stone (December 25, 2003).\n\nHedegaard, Erik. \"The Bachelor: Pop's Mr. Heartbreak Goes It Alone.\" Rolling Stone (January 23, 2003).\n\nWeb Sites\n\n\"Justin Timberlake: Wanna Be Starting Somethin'.\" VH1.com: Artists (June 16, 2003) http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1472671/06132003/timberlake_justin.jhtml (accessed on August 23, 2004).\n\nJustin Timberlake Web site. http://www.justintimberlake.com/ (accessed on August 23, 2004).\n\nKlueber, Jill. \"Justin's Solo Act.\" Time for Kids: Kid Scoops (November 11, 2002) http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/kidscoops/story/0,14989,389161,00.html (accessed on August 23, 2004).\n\nLerner, Meredith. \"Justin Timberlake: Work in Progress.\" VH1.com: Artists (November 18, 2002) http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1458752/11182002/timberlake_justin.jhtml (accessed on August 23, 2004).\n\nVernon, Polly. \"Boy Wonder.\" Guardian Unlimited (UK) (October 6, 2002) http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,804933,00.html (accessed on August 23, 2004).\n\nWiederhorn, Jon. \"Why is Justin Timberlake the Only Youngster Who Can Stand Up to Sting?\" MTV.com: News (February 2, 2004) http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484705/20040202/story.jhtml (accessed on August 23, 2004).\n\nTimberlake, Justin\n\nCareer\n\nSidelights\n\nSelected Discography\n\nSources\n\nSinger and actor\n\nB orn Justin Randall Timberlake, January 31, 1981, in Memphis, TN; son of Randy Timberlake and Lynn Harless (maiden name, Bomar).\n\nAddresses: Office—Tennman Records, PO Box 18765, Beverly Hills, CA 90209.\n\nCareer\n\nA ppeared on All-New Mickey Mouse Club, Disney Channel, 1989-94; member, ’N Sync (pop group), 1996-2002; launched film acting career with Longshot, 2000; began solo singing career, 2002; signed deal with Turner Broadcasting to be special sports correspondent, 2003; signed agreement to become spokesman for McDonald’s, 2003; appeared in film Edison, 2005; founded William Rast clothing line (with Trace Ayala), 2005; appeared in films Alpha Dog, Southland Tales, and Black Snake Moan, all 2006; appeared on Saturday Night Live, 2006; co-founded (with Eytan Sugerman) first restaurant, Destino’s, 2006; chairman and chief executive officer, Tennman Records, Beverly Hills, CA, 2007—; provided voice for Shrek the Third, 2007; songwriter, producer, and singer for tracks on Duran Duran’s album Red Carpet Massacre, 2007; served as co-executive producer for television series My Problem with Women, 2008; songwriter and producer for tracks on Madonna’s album Hard Candy, 2008; hosted the ESPYs, 2008.\n\nAwards: Grammy Award for best pop vocal album, National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, for Justified, 2003; Grammy Award for best male pop vocal performance, National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, for “Cry Me a River,” 2003; MTV Europe Music Award for best pop artist, 2006; MTV Europe Music Award for best male artist, 2006; Grammy Award for best dance recording, National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, for “Sexy-Back,” 2006; Grammy Award for best rap/sung collaboration, National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, for “My Love,” 2006; People’s Choice Award for favorite R&B song, for “SexyBack,” 2007; MTV Video Music Award for best choreography for “My Love,” 2007; MTV Video Music Award for best direction for “What GoesAround ComesAround,” 2007; BRIT Award for international male solo artist, British Phonographic Industry, 2007; MTV Video Music Award for quadruple threat of the year, 2007; American Music Award for male artist of the year, 2007; American Music Award for favorite male pop artist, 2007; World Music Award for best male pop artist, International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, 2007; Grammy Award for best male pop vocal performance, National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, for “What Goes Around Comes Around,” 2007; Grammy Award for best dance recording, National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, for “LoveStoned/I Think She Knows,” 2007; People’s Choice Award for favorite male singer, 2008; People’s Choice Award for favorite pop song, 2008.\n\nSidelights\n\nM oving from being a member of international boy band phenomenon ’N Sync to an accomplished solo artist, Justin Timberlake became an internationally respected singer on the strength of two solo albums, Justified and FutureSex/LoveSounds. He used his musical success to launch a number of other enterprises including a record label, clothing line, and numerous product endorsements. Timber-lake began his career on the All-New Mickey Mouse Club, and became a serious film actor in the early 2000s by appearing in films such as Alpha Dog.\n\nBorn on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee, Timberlake is the son of Randy Timberlake and Lynn Harless. Raised in a small Tennessee town, he was a shy child until the age of eight or nine. Around that time, the young Timberlake had a realization that performing would bring him attention and that he enjoyed it. He discovered he had natural talent, and soon began working professionally, with an appearance on Star Search.\n\nTimberlake’s performing career began in earnest when he was cast on the Disney Channel’s All-New Mickey Mouse Club. Appearing on the show from 1989 to 1994, he was not the only cast member to achieve success. His co-stars included J. C. Chasez, who also became a member of ’N Sync, actress Keri Russell, and singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Timberlake and Spears later became ro-mantically involved during his ’N Sync days.\n\nAfter All-New Mickey Mouse Club was cancelled, Timberlake found success again. Within two years, he had joined the singing group ’N Sync. Initially guided by boy-band guru Lou Pearlman, five members—Timberlake, Chasez, Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, and Chris Kirkpatrick—quickly established themselves as a pop singing powerhouse with their self-titled 1998 debut album and a large teen following. Following a 1998 Christmas album, ’N Sync released two more albums, 2000’s No Strings Attached and 2001’s Celebrity. The group sold more than 26 million albums total in the United States alone over the course of their career.\n\nDuring his time with ’N Sync, Timberlake went from being the baby of the group to its front man and a sex symbol, seemingly outgrowing his teen following by the early 2000s. He emerged as the stand-out among the five, creating tension between the members. Questions swirled over whether the group would last. Celebrity sold only 4.8 million copies, millions less than previous releases. Even before the “Celebrity 2002” tour in support of ’N Sync’s last album, Timberlake began recording what became his first solo album and would change the course of his career.\n\nReleased in November of 2002, Timberlake co-wrote all 13 tracks on Justified with the leading writers and producers in hip-hop and R&B including Tim-baland, the Neptunes, and Bryan McKnight. The sound was far more mature, sophisticated, and sexually raw than anything released by ’N Sync, and was influenced by a variety of musical styles. Critics were somewhat surprised by the change, but generally praised the direction the multi-talented Timberlake took. The New York Daily News’s Jim Farber called the record, “a sexy, funny, and surprisingly bold work that ultimately has a lot more to say about this 21year-old’s current creativity than his musical or romantic past.”\n\nExplaining Justified’s origins to Elysa Gardner of USA Today, Timberlake says, “I grew up listening to Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway, Al Green, Michael Jackson, Prince. If you know that, then this album makes perfect sense. It’s not a departure from anything I’ve done, because I haven’t done anything on my own. ’N Sync is great, but this is different—not only from ’N Sync, but from anything out there . People aren’t used to hearing me in this way, and it may take them a few listens to get it.”\n\nFans embraced the new Timberlake as well, sending singles “Like I Love You,” “Cry Me a River,” and “Rock Your Body” to the top of the charts. Within two months of the release of Justified, more than 2.2 million copies were sold in the United States alone. The album later went at least triple platinum, and sold seven million copies worldwide by mid2006. With the success of Justified, Timberlake left ’N Sync behind and the group went on what was assumed to be a permanent hiatus.\n\nIn between tours in support of his solo album— including a co-headlining outing with Aguilara— Timberlake pursued other interests. In 2003, he inked a one-year agreement with Turner Broadcasting to serve as a special correspondent for TBS and TNT sports programming. Timberlake contributed segments and features, which aired during NBA games, as well as stock car racing, golf, and college football. That same year, he also signed a two-year deal to become a spokesman for McDonald’s worldwide. As part of the agreement, he recorded vocals for the company’s signature “I’m Lovin’ It” commercials.\n\nWhile Timberlake was sitting on top of the world, he became caught up in a controversial event. Singing at the half-time show of the 2004 Super Bowl, he accidentally tore part of the costume of co-star Janet Jackson and revealed much of one of her breasts on national television. While Timberlake was supposed to tear off part of the outfit at that time, both the inner and outer pieces were unintentionally removed in what came to be known as a “wardrobe malfunction.” The incident caused an uproar, and the network broadcasting the Super Bowl, CBS, potentially faced fines.\n\nThe storm surrounding the Super Bowl incident did not greatly affect Timberlake’s career or outside projects. Thus, in 2005, he launched his own clothing line, William Rast, with his best friend from childhood, Trace Ayala. Inspired by Timberlake’s distinctive style, Ayala did most of the designing while Timberlake oversaw fashion shows and other details. To avoid the celebrity clothing line trap, it was not even publicly announced that Timberlake was part of the project until shortly before an October of 2006 fashion show. That same year, Timber-lake also co-founded his first restaurant, Destino’s, with Eytan Sugarman.\n\nThough Timberlake’s outside projects were satisfying, his primary focus remained music. In September 2006, he released his second album, FutureSex/ LoveSounds. As with Justified, Timberlake co-wrote the tracks with leading artists like Timbaland, and also co-produced the record. Building on the dance/ hip-hop sound he created for Justified, FutureSex/ LoveSounds’ first single “SexyBack” was a number-one hit as was “My Love.” FutureSex/LoveSounds debuted as the number-one album in the United States the first week of release as well as in multiple other countries, and sold six million copies worldwide by May of 2007.\n\nCritics praised both the album and how Timberlake was managing his singing career, with Andrew Dansby of the Houston Chronicle noting “he’s successfully reinvented himself as a modernized pop practioner.” Writing in the New York Times, Jon Pare-les commented “Mr. Timberlake has suavely made a rare kind of transition: from boy-band trouper to self-determined songwriter and bandleader. He doesn’t hide who his mentors are . To compensate for what he lacks in grit and wildness, Mr. Timber-lake makes smart choices for producers and brings rappers into his songs.”\n\nAs FutureSex/LoveSounds was becoming Timberlake’s second major hit, his acting career was also growing. He made a well-regarded appearance as a guest host on Saturday Night Live in December of 2006. Among the show’s highlights was a digital short he made with Andy Samberg which parodied R&B sex songs. The short, “D*** in a Box,” became a You-Tube hit, viewed more than ten million times in December of 2006.\n\nWhile that short brought Timberlake a wide audience, he wanted to be taken seriously as an actor. After launching his film career with Longshot in 2000 and playing a reporter in the 2005 direct-to-video release Edison Force, he had three meaty film roles in 2006. One was Alpha Dog, based on a true story. In the film, Timberlake played a member of a Los Angles gang of bored teens who helped kidnap and kill the brother of another teenager who had betrayed them in a drug deal. His character, Frankie Ballenbacher, tries to prevent the killing of the young hostage.\n\nOf his secondary career and Alpha Dog, Timberlake told John Hiscock of the Toronto Star, “To me, acting is a hobby. I’ve been lucky enough to have a musical career that has gone pretty good and acting is something I have always wanted to do. I’ve been offered a lot of different things I have turned down without thinking twice about, but Alpha Dog was an opportunity for me to sink my teeth into something. It just spoke volumes to me.”\n\nIn addition to Alpha Dog, Timberlake also appeared in Southland Tales and Black Snake Moan in 2006. In the latter film, he had a small role as a troubled soldier and impressed his director, Craig Brewer, with his work in the film. Brewer told Reed Tucker of the New York Post, “When I see him in other movies and on SNL, I really respect how he’s handling himself. Even his critics and detractors are looking at him, shrugging their shoulders and saying ‘God, am I really loving Justin Timberlake?’ It’s about time.”\n\nWhile Timberlake appeared in another film in 2007—providing the voice for Artie in the animated Shrek the Third—he spent much of the year focusing on music again. He toured in support of FutureSex/ LoveSounds several times and filmed his stop at New York City’s Madison Square Garden for an HBO music special. Timberlake also launched his own record label. A joint venture with Interscope Records, Timberlake served as the chairman and chief executive officer of Tennman Records. In addition, Timberlake’s musical career took a different turn when he began contributing to other artists’ works as a songwriter, producer, and performer. In 2007, he helped write, produce, appeared on one track, and co-wrote and co-produced two others tracks on the Duran Duran release Red Carpet Massacre.\n\nTimberlake’s career continued to remain diverse in 2008. He co-wrote and co-produced five songs on Madonna’s album Hard Candy. Timberlake also sang on one track, “4 Minutes,” which was a number-one hit in the United Kingdom. His producing career also extended to acts signed to his label, as he worked with songwriter Matt Morris on his first album for Tennman Records. In addition, Timberlake acted in two films scheduled for release in 2008, the Mike Myers comedy The Guru and The Open Road. Timberlake added executive producer to his list of accomplishments as he acted in that capacity for a television series scheduled to air on NBC, My Problem with Women. He continued to capitalize on his celebrity by endorsing products such as a new line of men’s fragrances put out by Parfums Givenchy.\n\nDescribing the appeal of Timberlake as a singer and larger cultural symbol, producer/songwriter Jimmy Jam told Jon Bream in the Vancouver Province, “He’s got It—whatever It is. Whatever Eminem has. Whatever the Elvises had back in their day. Whatever It is for this generation, Justin has got It.”\n\nSelected Discography\n\n(With ’N Sync) ’N Sync, Jive, 1998.\n\n(With ’N Sync) Home for Christmas, Jive, 1998.\n\n(With ’N Sync) No Strings Attached, Jive, 2000.\n\n(With ’N Sync) Celebrity, Jive, 2001.\n\nJustified, Jive, 2002.\n\nFutureSex/LoveSounds, Jive, 2006.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nComplete Marquis Who’s Who Biographies, Marquis Who’s Who, 2008.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nAssociated Press, September 8, 2006.\n\nBirmingham Evening Mail (Birmingham, England), November 2, 2007, p. 42.\n\nBusiness Wire, March 28, 2003.\n\nCanada NewsWire, October 25, 2007.\n\nChicago Sun-Times, November 10, 2002, p. 1.\n\nDaily News (New York, NY), October 30, 2000, p. 38; October 28, 2002, p. 41; May 8, 2003, p. 105.

Petruso\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nSinger\n\nAs a member of *NSYNC, one of the most successful groups in music history, Justin Timberlake has sold millions of albums worldwide and even more merchandise. When the singer broke free from the boy band to release a solo album, no one could have expected he would become one of the most popular pop artists in the world. Like Michael Jackson, one of his musical icons, Timberlake is one of the few former band boy members who was able to distance himself from his past and become just as successful on his own. Timberlake's R&B/pop style has earned him fans of all genres, and his songwriting, producing, and dancing continue to wow fans worldwide.\n\nBorn on January 31, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee, Timberlake grew up with a strong relationship with his mother, Lynn, that continues through adulthood. His father, Randy Timberlake, played bass in a bluegrass band with Lynn's brother. After his parents divorced, both remarried and Timberlake was mostly raised by his mom and his stepfather Paul Harless. Timberlake began singing in public at the church where he grew up in Millington, Tennessee. Early on, it was clear that he had talent and soon his mother began to enter him into a string of talent shows. In 1991, Timberlake won the Preteen Mr. American Pageant and sang on the Star Search television competition show. After moving to Orlando, Florida, in 1993, Timberlake got a gig that parlayed his singing, dancing, and stage presence into a television job. For almost two years, Timberlake appeared on The New Mickey Mouse Club with other future mega stars including Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and *NSYNC's JC Chasez.\n\nAfter his stint with the Disney company, Timberlake received a phone call that changed his life. In 1996, Timberlake joined his friend Chasez, Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, and Chris Kirkpatrick in the new singing group *NSYNC. In the tradition of the Jackson 5 and New Kids on the Block, *NSYNC wooed teenager girls' hearts and stormed the record charts with bubblegum pop songs. After touring in Germany and gaining a strong European following, in 1998 *NSYNC returned to the United States for the release of their self-titled debut album. The return of the boy band was triumphant with record sales of over 10 million.\n\nOnly 14 when he joined *NSYNC, Timberlake had little to do with the group's debut. For their follow-up, two years later, both Timberlake and Chasez received songwriting credits on No Strings Attached. The group's sophomore record sold a phenomenal one million copies on the first day and 2.4 million in just one week. The group's hit song \"Bye Bye Bye\" was nominated for a Grammy, giving the group credibility in the pop field. For *NSYNC's 2001 album, Celebrity, Tim-berlake wrote six songs, including the very successful single \"Pop.\"\n\nSolo Debut\n\nIn 2001, Timberlake and Spears ended their much-publicized romantic relationship that had begun years earlier. The songwriter used his experiences to write songs for a solo album. In November of 2002, Jive released Timberlake's explosive debut Justified. Certified triple platinum in the United States, People's Chuck Arnold called the album, \"… soulful inspiration from Off the Wall-era Michael Jackson.\" With Justified, Timberlake matured into adulthood with a soundtrack to match. Citing artists Al Green, Prince, Stevie Wonder, and Michael Jackson as some of his biggest influences, Justified was emphatically more R&B, hip-hop, and blue-eyed soul than anything he had done with *NSYNC. \"All I try to do is just to make R&B music. That's where I shine…. It's what I like to do,\" Timberlake told VH1.com. As detached from boy band material as possible, Justified crossed over musical genres. Producers like The Neptunes used live instrumentation and a hip-hop and rock mix to fuel singles \"Like I Love You,\" \"Rock Your Body,\" and \"Senorita.\" A big name in hip-hop, producer/artist Timbaland created a field of sonic beats for the autobiographical \"Cry Me a River,\" a song said to be about Timberlake's relationship with Spears.\n\nAfter taking a 14-piece band on the road and spending the summer of 2003 touring with Christina Aguilera on the \"Justified & Stripped\" tour, Timberlake decided that it was time for him to take a break. \"I was really burned-out on the music,\" he told W's Robert Haskell. \"After that album, I just didn't have any creative juice left. It was my first solo record, and it was kind of like every idea I had about myself since I was a little boy.\" While the artist did some work, like hosting Saturday Night Live in October and singing the McDonald's jingle \"I'm Lovin' It,\" Timberlake took time to enjoy the simple things in life. \"That was amazing for me,\" Timberlake told Rolling Stone's Austin Scaggs about his almost two-year break. \"Just the little things, like sitting home on the weekend or making a Sunday tee time. Play golf, then come back home, have a beer and call it a day.\"\n\nTimberlake's only major appearances in 2004 included winning two Grammy Awards (Best Pop Vocal Album for Justified, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"Cry Me a River\"), and his infamous performance with Janet Jackson at February's Super Bowl XXXVIII. During the duo's performance, Timberlake went to remove part of Jackson's outfit. Unlike in rehearsal, during halftime, Jackson's breast was almost fully exposed. Dubbed a \"wardrobe malfunction,\" Timberlake apologized for the accident, which Jackson later revealed was intentional.\n\nNo Sophomore Slump\n\nAfter appearing on the Snoop Dogg hit song \"Signs\"—a direction that clearly showed Timberlake's crossover appeal—the singer had surgery in May to remove nodules from his vocal chords. As the year came to a close, Timberlake began work on is sophomore album at producer Timbaland's studio in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Working more like a freestyle rapper than a former boy band singer, Timberlake would often freeform his lyrics and melodies in the studio, taking musical chances at every turn. \"I knew that I needed something new,\" he told Scaggs. \"I wanted to take more of a chance—experiment.\"\n\nFor the Record …\n\nBorn Justin Randall Timberlake on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, TN; son of Lynn and Randall Timberlake.\n\nJoined *NSYNC, 1996, group signed to RCA Records and released *NSYNC, 1998; group signed with Jive Records, released No Strings Attached, 2000; and Celebrity, 2001; signed to Jive as a solo artist, released Justified, 2002; won two Grammy Awards, 2004; released FutureSex/LoveSounds, 2006.\n\nAwards: Grammy Awards, Best Pop Vocal Album for Justified, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"Cry Me a River,\" 2004.\n\nAddresses: Record company—Jive, 2100 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90404. Website—Justin Tim-berlake Official Website: http://www.justintimberlake.com.\n\nFutureSex/LoveSounds hit shelves in September of 2006. With a distinctly sexier and brasher sound, the album gained comparisons to works by Prince and Michael Jackson. For his new record, Timberlake's songs were less biographical. The album's first single, \"SexyBack\" (with Timbaland beats and vocals), showed a daring side to the star. \"I don't really think I'm bringing sexy back,\" Timberlake admitted to Scaggs. \"But when a twenty-eight-year-old-male or female is standing in a club in New York City at 2:30 in the morning and that f****ing song comes on, I want them to feel like they are. That's what music should do. When I was a kid and I heard 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand,' I wanted to find someone's hand to hold.\"\n\nJustin Conner of Interview wrote \"… the album taps into electroclash, disco, and gospel, remixing and matching old sounds to make them modern.\" FutureSex/LoveSounds also contained a mélange of song topics. From the falsetto and heavy synth beat of \"My Love\" with rapper T.I. to the bold \"Losing My Way,\" a track inspired by a documentary on crystal meth, the album contained all of the emotions and repercussions of sex and love. \"… FutureSex/LoveSounds is about the very nature of how sex and love are interchangeable and immutable and contradictory and complementary all at once …,\" wrote Jennifer Vineyard of MTV.com.\n\nIn the business for 15 years and in his mid-twenties, Timberlake has had a more successful (monetarily and artistically) career than artists twice his age. Though he loves it, as he told Scaggs, he can't keep doing it forever. \"The dream is to be able to have a schedule like I've had in the last five years, to put out a record and tour, then take a little break, maybe do some films. But I don't want to work this hard forever.\"\n\nSelected discography\n\n(With *NSYNC) *NSYNC, RCA, 1998.\n\n(With *NSYNC) Home for Christmas, RCA, 1998.\n\n(With *NSYNC) No Strings Attached, Jive, 2000.\n\n(With *NSYNC) Celebrity, Jive, 2001.\n\nJustified, Jive, 2002.\n\nFutureSex/LoveSounds, Jive, 2006.\n\nSources\n\nPeriodicals\n\nInterview, October 2006, p. 112.\n\nPeople, September 18, 2006, p. 47.\n\nRolling Stone, September 6, 2006.\n\nW, September 2006, p.
