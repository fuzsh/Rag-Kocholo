        "text": "Yes, Honey. As many of you already know, I love me some Justin Timberlake.\n\nSince he came onto the music scene with ‘nSync, I’ve been a huge fan of this Tennessee boy. Call it blue eyed soul, dirty pop, or futuristic dopeness, JT’s sound has always been massively addictive. How can you NOT dance to SexyBack, Take Back the Night, or Suit and Tie?\n\nI traveled to Miami in August to see Justin and Jay Z during their final Legends of the Summer concert, and would’ve tried to bum-rush the stage, had it not been for security. Dude is one of my favorite artists of all-time, his vibe and style is pretty much everything. His concerts are nothing short of epicness.\n\nBut enough of my fandom. Let’s get to the real meat and potatoes.\n\nI Love Memphis and ALIVE Magazine are giving you an opportunity to see JT live in concert in his hometown of Memphis during a concert at the FedExForum on November 18th. What’s more, you can also win accommodations for a two night stay at Memphis’ acclaimed Peabody Hotel. You may recall, the Peabody Hotel was featured in the 1993 Tom Cruise thriller The Firm. It’s a well appointed hotel and is located in the heart of Memphis.\n\nMemphis, aka Bluff City, is a town that I have come to love and adore. I first moved to Memphis in 1988 and lived there until 1991. As a former resident, I’ve been back to visit Memphis many times. The food, the music, the aura of the city is something to behold. It’s southern charm and rustic accents makes it one of my favorite cities to visit. What is there not to like about Memphis?\n\nLet me break it down to you like this-\n\nThe History:\n\nMemphis is full of culture and history. It was an epicenter during the Civil Rights Movement, and because of its place in history, houses the National Civil Rights History Museum at the Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King, Jr. was slain. I haven’t had the opportunity to visit the museum on previous trips, but hope to do so during my next trip to the mid-south.\n\nThe Soul and Music:\n\nSay the word Memphis, and what comes to mind? Music of course. Memphis has been the birthplace of many careers including Elvis, Sam and Dave, Johnny Cash, Isaac Hayes, Otis Redding, Justin Timberlake, and more. It is the home of the Stax Museum of Soul Music, Sun Records, and of course, Graceland. When it comes to music, Memphis has it on lock. Historic Beale Street with its dive bars and live music will have you wanting more!\n\nThe Food and BBQ:\n\nThe food in Memphis has always been good. From southern cooking with Italian roots at Hog & Hominy, to Memphis style BBQ at Bogarts Smokehouse, to Soul Fish Cafe, you will eat well in Memphis. Other notables include Lunchbox Eats sandwich shop downtown. Make sure to BYOB (Bring Your Own Bib!)\n\nThe Fashion\n\nMemphis has a style of its own. I describe it as a throwback to vintage looks with a touch of elegance, as you will see mixture of jeans with sequins and ruffled tops, shirt-dresses, cowboy boots, tailored slacks with pumps, and pencil skirts. And they have their very own Memphis Fashion Week, which will take place March 27th through March 29th, 2014.\n\nOther Memphis attractions include Memphis in May International Festival, NBA basketball team the Memphis Grizzlies, and the Redbirds, a minor league team from where many St. Louis Cardinals get their start. Justin Timberlake owns Mirimichi Golf Course in the Millington, a Memphis suburban enclave. It was voted the best golf course in Tennessee by Golfweek Magazine’s 2013 Best Courses You Can Play.\n\nMemphis was also voted as one of the top places to visit in the world according to National Geographic Traveler and MSN Living.\n\nMemphis is just a few hours drive away from many cities including Chicago, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Kansas City, and of course, St. Louis!\n\nAre you interested in winning the Justin Timberlake Weekend Getaway? Here’s what you will get:\n\nA two day stay at the famous Peabody Hotel (Nov 17-18)\n\nTwo tickets to the Justin Timberlake show on Monday, Nov. 18 at FedEx Forum\n\nA round of golf at Justin Timberlake’s Mirimichi Golf Course (If your golf game is a little rusty, no biggie, enjoy a complimentary lunch and tour the club instead! We heard JT often makes an appearance while he’s in town.)\n\nTickets to your choice of local music attractions like the Rock ‘n’ Soul Museum, Graceland, Sun Studio or the Stax Museum.\n\nYou must be a Missouri resident in order to participate.\n\nMosey on over to ALIVE Magazine and enter!\n\nIf you’ve been looking for an awesome place to visit and play, look no further than Memphis! For more information on ideas for your next trip to Memphis, visit the I Love Memphis website.\n\nDisclosure: I am not being compensated for this post. I am, however, trying to get in where I fit in by winning the weekend getaway so I can see Justin in Memphis. 🙂\n\nSome of the photos used in this post were from I Love Memphis’ Flickr page."
