        "text": "Full Name: Justin Randall Timberlake\n\nDate of Birth: January 31, 1981\n\nBorn: Memphis, TN\n\nOccupation: Singer, actor, producer\n\nStatus: Married to Jessica Biel (2012)\n\nChildren: 1\n\nSexy has been brought. From the Mickey Mouse Club to \"in da club,\" Justin Timberlake has been delighting fans with his top-notch talent since he was a wee one. Now one of the hottest acts on the planet, the multi-faceted fella is doing what he does best…entertain.\n\nFrom his mind-blowing musical chops to his on-screen success, the father of one and hubby to hottie Jessica Biel is going strong, putting out some of today's most popular music and lighting up theaters with his good looks and screen-stealing scenes. Here's more about \"JT\" and why fans love him - they just \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\"\n\nDisney Days\n\ni.pinimg.com\n\nIt's hard to imagine the \"SexyBack\" singer chillin' with Mickey and Minnie, but if you've been a Timberlake fan since he was a kid, you know he got his start on The All-New Mickey Mouse Club. Like Britney and Christina, a young Timberlake showed the world he was born with a gift. While the Mickey days wouldn't last forever, the launching pad was priceless. We got a taste of what was to come and it was delicious.\n\nBoy Band Bonanza\n\nNSYNC took Timberlake to the next level. The late '90s was a hot time for boy bands, NSYNC being one of the most popular. Their special blend and cool charisma was hip with tweens, teens, and twenty-somethings, and to this day, songs like \"Bye Bye Bye,\" \"It's Gonna Be Me,\" and \"This I Promise You\" are still on our playlists. With dance moves to thrill and killer harmonies, Timberlake along with Joey Fatone, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, and Lance Bass were selling out arenas and climbing the charts. They remain a band, but Timberlake had bigger dreams of going solo.\n\nOne Singular Sensation\n\nTimberlake's vocal skills, lyrical talents, and knack for churning out hits has kept him on solid rotation ever since he went solo. Always daring and down to collaborate, Timberlake's songs never fail to send shivers up our spines. From \"Cry Me a River\" to \"Suit & Tie\" to \"What U Workin' With?,\" Timberlake's tunes are fresh and fun, putting us in the mood to tap our toes and sing along. #1 hits and well-deserved awards prove that the Memphis native has made his mark around the globe.\n\nMade for Movies\n\nAs if his music career isn't outstanding enough, Timberlake has a taste for film too. His ability to act is as impressive as his musical talents, bringing fans to theaters to see their idol on the big screen. Some of his top titles include Friends with Benefits, The Social Network, Bad Teacher, Trolls, and In Time. Handsome looks and heartfelt performances wow audiences at every showing. A big bucket of hot buttered popcorn is perhaps the only thing better than seeing Justin Timberlake, the movie star.\n\nFamily Man\n\nWhile Timberlake surely had a hell of a time playing the field during his boy band days, he settled down and married actress Jessica Biel in 2012. They have one son and it seems like his role as \"dad\" is his proudest. Unlike many celeb marriages, the Timberlake-Biel relationship seems down-to-earth and solid – a gorgeous couple with a true connection and commitment. Will they have another kiddo to add to their party of three? We're eager to see if the Timberlake family becomes a foursome.\n\nWhat's next for this mega-star? Everything Timberlake touches turns to gold. He's focused. He's funny. He's a face we'll never get bored of looking at. His voice? Never better. For a guy who seems to have it all, we expect him to find a way to get even more out of life.\n\nMelissa A. Kay is a New York-based writer, editor, and content strategist.
