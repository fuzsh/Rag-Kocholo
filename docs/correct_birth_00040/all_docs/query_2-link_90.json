        "text": "Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, who have been married since 2012, are parents to two sons, Silas and Phineas. They have kept their family life relatively private but occasionally share glimpses of their children on social media.\n\nSilas Randall Timberlake, born on April 8, 2015, is the couple’s first child. Named after Justin’s maternal grandfather, Silas is often featured in sweet family moments shared by his parents. Recently, Jessica posted a heartfelt tribute to Justin on Father’s Day, highlighting his role as the family’s “rock” and sharing rare family pictures, though the boys’ faces are usually kept hidden​​. Silas, now 9, is described as unfazed by his parents’ fame. Jessica mentioned in interviews that Silas shows little interest in watching her children’s show, “Pete the Cat,” despite asking her to perform voices from the show​.\n\nPhineas Timberlake, born in July 2020, is the couple’s younger son. His arrival was announced quietly, and the couple has shared only a few images since then. For Father’s Day 2021, Justin posted the first photo of Phineas, showing him playing video games with his sons. The family values privacy but doesn’t completely shield their children from the public eye, aiming instead for a balanced approach​.\n\nJustin Timberlake is currently making headlines with his highly anticipated “Forget Tomorrow” World Tour, marking his first tour in five years. The tour kicked off in April 2024 and includes numerous dates across North America, with upcoming performances in cities such as Baltimore, Hershey, Cleveland, and Lexington​. Timberlake’s return to the stage has excited fans, with ticket prices ranging from $75 to $800 depending on the venue and seating arrangement​.\n\nMeet Silas and Phineas Timberlake: Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel’s Adorable Kids\n\nRecently, Timberlake performed at Hersheypark Stadium on July 4, 2024, as part of the tour, which has been a major highlight for fans celebrating the holiday with live music from the pop icon​. In addition to his tour, Timberlake has been active on social media, sharing moments with his family and reflecting on his role as a father.\n\nJust two days before Timberlake was arrested for driving while intoxicated in the Hamptons on June 18, 2024, he celebrated Father’s Day with a sweet post about Silas and Phineas on Instagram.\n\n“My 2 greatest gifts. I learn more about myself everyday just because you both chose me to be your Daddy,” he wrote. “I will always be there for you through your peaks and valleys… to lift you up and show you how high you can take this life and to pick you up when you fall. I love you both so much. Thank you for giving me my biggest purpose.”\n\nHere is all about Justin Timberlake and Jssica Biel’s 2 kids:\n\nSilas Timberlake, 9\n\nSilas Randall Timberlake, the first child of Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, was born on April 8, 2015. The couple maintained a high level of privacy surrounding his birth, with representatives only confirming to PEOPLE that both Biel and Silas were doing well and that Timberlake was “ecstatic.” Silas was named in honor of Timberlake’s maternal grandfather, Bill Silas Bomar, and shares the same middle name, Randall, as his father.\n\nWhen Silas was just six months old, Jessica Biel opened up about the challenges and joys of motherhood on the Today show, describing it as “an amazing, amazing experience” and “the hardest job in the world.” She expressed immense gratitude for her own mother and described Silas as “amazing” and “wonderful.”\n\nSilas has made occasional appearances on his parents’ social media over the years. In 2017, Justin Timberlake shared a rare video after Thanksgiving, where he was seen doing push-ups with Silas on his back, captioning it, “Shaking off those leftovers like… Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving!”\n\nThe following year, Timberlake posted a sweet photo of Biel and Silas in Paris, writing, “If that pic doesn’t say ‘City of Love’ then I’m out.” In 2020, Biel celebrated Silas’ 5th birthday on Instagram with a photo of her holding him over her shoulder, captioned, “This little man is 5 today! We’re at home, covered in legos and birthday cake right now… but I just found this pic on my phone from last summer and it made me so happy.”\n\nDespite Timberlake’s fame and multiple Grammy awards, Silas remains unimpressed by his father’s success. Biel shared with Jimmy Fallon in 2021 that Silas, then 6 years old, would casually acknowledge his dad’s music, saying, “Oh yeah, that’s Dad. No big deal, whatever.”\n\nJessica Biel also mentioned that she struggled to get Silas to watch her children’s show, “Pete the Cat.” She humorously recounted how Silas would ask her to perform voices from the show despite never having watched it, responding with “cool Mom, cool” after she did so.\n\nFollowing the release of Biel’s children’s book, “A Kids Book About Periods,” she shared that she and Silas had begun reading it together. She described the experience as “really cool,” noting how attentive Silas was. Biel felt triumphant, saying, “Oh my God, score. We did it,” highlighting that this was the beginning of more significant and meaningful conversations with her son.\n\nPhineas Timberlake, 4\n\nPhineas Timberlake, the second child of Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, was born in the summer of 2020. The couple kept Phineas’s birth private for a while, and it wasn’t until Justin Timberlake’s appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in January 2021 that he shared the exciting news publicly. Timberlake described Phineas as “awesome and so cute,” and humorously noted the sleepless nights, but expressed immense joy and gratitude for their new addition. When asked about Silas, Phineas’s older brother, Timberlake mentioned that Silas was enjoying his role, especially since Phineas wasn’t mobile yet to chase him around.\n\nA few months later, Jessica Biel discussed the experience of having a “secret COVID baby” on Dax Shepard’s Armchair Expert podcast. She explained that due to the pandemic, they relocated to Montana and stayed there, which contributed to the secrecy surrounding Phineas’s birth. Biel also shared her concerns about Timberlake potentially not being allowed in the hospital due to COVID-19 restrictions, which fortunately did not happen​.\n\nBiel opened up about the challenges of parenting two children, comparing it to the overwhelming feeling of “having a thousand.” She described the difficulty in balancing everything with two kids. When asked about the possibility of her children entering show business, Biel expressed her initial hesitation but acknowledged the likelihood given their musical family background. She emphasized her desire to support their passions, whether in music or any other field, and humorously noted she would prefer if they chose a more conventional career like engineering.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are dedicated to providing a normal and loving upbringing for their two sons, Silas and Phineas Timberlake. Despite their fame, the couple strives to keep their children out of the spotlight, ensuring they can enjoy childhood without the pressures of their parents’ celebrity status.\n\nSilas, born in 2015, is adapting well to his role as a big brother, while Phineas, born during the summer of 2020, brings additional joy to the family. Both parents have candidly shared their parenting experiences, emphasizing the challenges and rewards of raising two children, especially during the pandemic. Their commitment to family, coupled with their willingness to discuss personal struggles and triumphs, offers a relatable and heartfelt glimpse into their lives.\n\nJustin Timberlake and Jessica Biel’s 2 Kids (Everything About Silas and Phineas Timberlake) – FAQs\n\nDoes Justin Timberlake have a child?\n\nJustin Timberlake has two children with his wife, Jessica Biel.
