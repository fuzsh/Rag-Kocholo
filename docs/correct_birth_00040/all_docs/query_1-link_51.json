        "text": "Justin Timberlake surprised fans with a new single on Friday night. The former NSYNC member also released a teaser trailer for a new album — his first since 2018.\n\nTimberlake debuted the new song, “Selfish,” during a performance at the Orpheum Theater in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. He also shared a 33-second clip of the single on YouTube (below).\n\nShortly after the song’s release, the pop star shared a trailer on Instagram for what appears to be a new studio album, “Everything I Thought I Was.” Actor Benicio Del Toro narrates the trailer, which seemingly pulls inspiration from Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City. A model car drives into a desert gas station set before fans see Timberlake staring at a sunset backdrop.\n\n“That’s a nice car. Wait, it’s a model,” Del Toro says. “Did that say JT? OK, that sunset is definitely not real. Oh, there’s Justin. Why won’t he turn around? What the fuck is he staring at?”\n\nThe video ends with a title card that reads, “Justin Timberlake Presents: Everything I Thought It Was.” The album will be Timberlake’s sixth solo release, following Justified (2002), FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), The 20/20 Experience (2013), The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2 (2013) and Man of the Woods (2018).\n\nTimberlake’s announcement comes on the heels of news that he will appear as the musical guest on next weekend’s episode of Saturday Night Live, with Dakota Johnson as host. Saltburn star Jacob Elordi will make his SNL debut this week, with musical guest Renée Rapp. The performance will be Timberlake’s seventh time as a musical guest; he has also hosted five times."
