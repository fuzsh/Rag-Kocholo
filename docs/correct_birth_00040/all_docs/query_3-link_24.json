Born and raised in Tennessee, he appeared on the television shows Star Search and The All-New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of NSYNC, which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Timberlake won two Grammy Awards for his R&B-focused debut solo album Justified and its single \"Cry Me a River\". Another single from the album, \"Rock Your Body\", was also successful.\n\nHis critically acclaimed sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds , characterized by its diversity in music genres, debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 and produced the Hot 100 number-one singles \"SexyBack\", \"My Love\", and \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\". Established as a solo artist worldwide, his first two albums both exceeded sales of 10 million copies, and he continued producing records and collaborating with other artists. From 2008 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus. He held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, Friends with Benefits, and In Time.\n\nTimberlake resumed his music career in 2013 with his third and fourth albums The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience â 2 of 2, exploring neo soul styles, partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock. The former became the best-selling album of the year with the largest sales week in the US, and spawned the top-three singles \"Suit & Tie\" and \"Mirrors\", while the latter produced the top-ten song \"Not a Bad Thing\". For his live performances, including the eponymous concert tour for the albums, he began performing with his band The Tennessee Kids, composed by instrumentalists and dancers. Timberlake voiced Branch in DreamWorks Animation's Trolls , whose soundtrack includes his fifth Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single, \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\". His fifth studio album Man of the Woods became his fourth number-one album in the US. Supported by the two top ten singles, \"Filthy\" and \"Say Something\", it concluded 2018 as the sixth best-selling album of the year. In May 2019, Timberlake received an honorary Doctorate from Berklee College of Music.\n\nBeing one of the world's best-selling music artists, Timberlake has sold over 32 million albums and 56 million singles globally throughout his solo career. Often regarded as a pop icon, Timberlake is the recipient of numerous awards and accolades, including ten Grammy Awards, four Emmy Awards, three Brit Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, the Contemporary Icon Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame, an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music, and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. According to Billboard in 2017, he is the best performing male soloist in the history of the Mainstream Top 40. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2007 and 2013. His other ventures include record label Tennman Records, fashion label William Rast, and the restaurants Destino and Southern Hospitality.\n\nEarly life\n\nJustin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee to Lynn Harless and Charles Randall Timberlake, a Baptist church choir director. Timberlake grew up in Shelby Forest, a small community between Memphis and Millington. He has two half-brothers, Jonathan and Stephen , from Charles' second marriage to Lisa Perry. His half-sister Laura Katherine died shortly after birth on May 12, 1997, and is mentioned in his acknowledgments in the album NSYNC as \"My Angel in Heaven\". His family circle includes a number of musicians; his grandfather introduced him to music from country artists like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. Performing as a child, Timberlake sang country and gospel music: at the age of 11, he appeared on the television show Star Search, performing country songs as \"Justin Randall\". By that time, he began listening to rhythm and blues musicians from the 1960s and 70s, such as Al Green, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and he had listening sessions with his father of studio albums by the Eagles and Bob Seger.\n\nIn 1993 and 1994, he was a Mouseketeer on The All-New Mickey Mouse Club, where his castmates included future girlfriend and singer Britney Spears, future tourmate Christina Aguilera, future bandmate JC Chasez, and future movie actors Ryan Gosling and Keri Russell. Timberlake then recruited Chasez to be in an all-male singing group, organized by boy band manager Lou Pearlman, that eventually became NSYNC.\n\nCareer\n\n1995â2002: NSYNC\n\nThe boy band NSYNC formed in 1995, and began their career in 1996 in Europe; Timberlake and Chasez served as its two lead singers. In 1998, the group rose to prominence in the United States with the release of their self-titled debut studio album, which sold 11 million copies and included the single \"Tearin' Up My Heart\". Their second album No Strings Attached sold 2.4 million copies in the first week, and included a number one single, \"It's Gonna Be Me\". NSYNC's third album Celebrity was also financially successful. The group's second and third studio albums spawned top-five singles such as \"Bye Bye Bye\", \"Girlfriend\" and \"This I Promise You\". Upon the completion of the Celebrity Tour, the group went into hiatus in 2002. In its lifetime, NSYNC was internationally famous and performed at the Academy Awards, the Olympics, and the Super Bowl, as well as selling more than 70 million records worldwide, becoming the fifth-best selling boy band in history.\n\nIn late 1999, Timberlake appeared in the Disney Channel movie Model Behavior. He played Jason Sharpe, a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model. It was released on March 12, 2000. The rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to the dissolution of NSYNC. Band member Lance Bass was openly critical of Timberlake's actions in his memoir Out of Sync. By 2002, when the group went on a hiatus and members were following individual projects, he partnered with Pharrell Williams of the producing team The Neptunesâand Timbaland to start working in new music. The idea of going solo was strengthened a year earlier. Timberlake originally wrote the single \"Gone\" around 2001 for Michael Jackson, but he turned the song down, and was instead recorded by NSYNC. Before its release, however, Jackson contacted him. Timberlake declared in a later interview that the first time he felt confident to go solo happened after that conversation. In a retrospective article in 2020, Billboard staff considered Celebrity \"the group's swan song, setting the stage for Timberlake's equally massive solo career.\"\n\n.mw-parser-output .quotebox.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft p,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright p.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite@media screen and } called me on the phone and said that he wanted to cut the record , but he wanted it to be a duet between himself and I. And I said, 'Well ... we've already cut the song as an 'N Sync record. Could we do, like, 'N Sync featuring Michael Jackson', or 'Michael Jackson featuring 'N Sync'? And he was very absolute about the fact that he wanted it to be a duet between himself and I.. the first time I ever really felt the confidence to do it\n\nâ Timberlake on Master Class, 2014\n\n2002â2004: Justified and Super Bowl XXXVIII\n\nIn August 2002, Timberlake performed at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, where he premiered his debut solo single \"Like I Love You\"; it peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the UK Singles Chart. His debut solo studio album Justified was released in November and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 439,000 copies, fewer than previous 'N Sync releases. It went on to sell over three million copies in the U.S. and more than ten million copies worldwide. Its R&B influence, provided by hip-hop producers The Neptunes and Timbaland, was complimented by music critics. About the musical direction of the record, he commented, \"I just want to do R&B. It's what I grew up listening to\". The album spawned the top-five singles \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\". In summer 2003, Timberlake and Christina Aguilera headlined the Justified/Stripped Tour. Later that year he recorded a song \"I'm Lovin' It\", used by McDonald's as the theme to its \"I'm Lovin' It\" campaign. The deal with McDonald's earned Timberlake an estimated $6 million. A tour titled Justified and Lovin' It Live was included with the deal, following his initial Justified World Tour. Timberlake was featured on Nelly's song, \"Work It\", which was remixed and included on Nelly's 2003 remix album.\n\nTimberlake in London on his Justified World Tour, December 2003\n\nNear the end of 2002, Timberlake was the first celebrity to appear on Punk'd, a \"candid camera\" type show created by Ashton Kutcher to trick celebrities. Timberlake, who cried during the episode, later admitted to being under the influence of cannabis when he was pranked. Three episodes later, he set up Kelly Osbourne to be \"punk'd\", thus making him the first celebrity to appear on the show more than once. Timberlake later spoofed Ashton Kutcher and Punk'd in a 2003 episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live. Timberlake co-starred in skit titled The Barry Gibb Talk Show alongside comedian Jimmy Fallon, where the duo portrayed Bee Gees brothers Barry and Robin Gibb. It marked the beginning of a long-running friendship and collaboration with Fallon.\n\nIn February 2004, during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, broadcast on the CBS television network from Houston, Timberlake performed with Janet Jackson before a television audience of more than 140 million viewers. At the end of the performance, as the song drew to a close, Timberlake tore off a part of Jackson's black leather costume in a \"costume reveal\" meant to accompany a portion of the song lyrics. Jackson's representative explained Timberlake intended \"to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. Part of the costume detached, and Jackson's breast was briefly exposed. Timberlake apologized for the incident, stating he was \"sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl...\" The phrase \"wardrobe malfunction\" has since been used by the media to refer to the incident and has entered pop culture. Timberlake and Jackson were threatened with exclusion from the 2004 Grammy Awards unless they agreed to apologize on screen at the event. Timberlake attended and issued a scripted apology when accepting the first of two Grammy Awards he received that night . He had also been nominated for Album of the Year for Justified, and Record of the Year along with Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Where Is the Love?\" with The Black Eyed Peas.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn early 1999, Timberlake began dating fellow former The All-New Mickey Mouse Club cast member and singer Britney Spears. Their relationship ended abruptly in March 2002. Both Spears and Timberlake graduated high school via distance learning from the University of Nebraska High School; Timberlake received his diploma onstage during a concert in Memphis in 2000. In 2003, he was briefly linked to British singer Emma Bunton. In April 2003, he began dating actress Cameron Diaz soon after they met at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. After much speculation of breakups throughout their relationship, the couple split in December 2006 shortly after she introduced him as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live.\n\nIn January 2007, Timberlake began dating actress Jessica Biel. They became engaged in December 2011 and married on October 19, 2012, at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Fasano, Italy. Their son, Silas Randall Timberlake, was born in April 2015. In September 2020, ex-NSYNC member Lance Bass said that Timberlake and his wife had another child in July of 2020, a son whose name has not been announced.\n\nForbes magazine began reporting on Timberlake's earnings in 2008, calculating that he earned $44 million between June 2007 and June 2008 for his music, tour, commercials, and hospitality, making him the world's 4th best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.

As noted by a Billboard editor, \"Since his solo career began with the 2002 release of debut album Justified, Timberlake has honed his unique sense of style,\" while citing Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Frank Sinatra, as style influences: \"guys who were just really never trying to be that , they just were that.\" According to American fashion designer Tom Ford, who has dressed Timberlake since 2011 and created more than 600 exclusive pieces for The 20/20 Experience World Tour, Timberlake \"has a kind of effortless cool that makes classic menswear tailoring modern.\"\n\nThe New York Times' editor Sia Michel wrote in 2007, \"Since his last tour, for 2002's multiplatinum Justified, he has learned how to project sex-symbol edge\" adding \"he's a rock star who can commit.\"Napster's founder Sean Parker, portrayed by Timberlake in The Social Network, stated \"I don't think I look anything like Timberlake, but it's not so bad being played by a sex symbol.\" Timberlake was given Sexiest Man titles by Teen People and Cosmopolitan magazines.

And we should be using our differences to bring ourselves closer together.\" Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel received the Inspiration Award at the GLSEN Respect Awards in 2015, with the executive director saying, \"They are two vocal and committed allies to the LGBT community who are also devoted to charitable works that improve the lives of youth.\"\n\nInfluenced by the national attention received by Timberlake's selfie inside a voting booth shared on Instagram during the 2016 presidential election, which was at the moment an illegal act, Senator Brian Kelsey of Germantown brought up a bill that would allow taking photos in voting poll stations, with some exceptions against bad procedures. It was later approved by the Tennessee Senate.\n\nOther ventures\n\nBusiness ventures\n\nTimberlake has co-owned or provided celebrity endorsement for three restaurants in the United States: \"Chi\" opened in West Hollywood, California, in 2003, and \"Destino\" and \"Southern Hospitality\" in New York opened in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2005, Timberlake launched the William Rast clothing line with childhood friend Juan Ayala. The 2007 line contained cord jackets, cashmere sweaters, jeans, and polo shirts. The pair reports inspiration from fellow Memphis native Elvis Presley: \"Elvis is the perfect mixture of Justin and I,\" Ayala says. \"You can go back and see pictures of him in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat and a nice button-down shirt, but then again you can see him in a tux and a collared shirt with rhinestones on it and slacks. We like to think 'If he was alive today, what would he be wearing?'\" Target has announced that a William Rast collection, including denim, outerwear and sportswear for men and women, would launch in December and be available for a month. In 2015, the clothing line earned him a Lord & Taylor's Fashion Oracle Award at the Fashion Group International's Night of The Stars Gala. An avid amateur golfer, in 2007 Timberlake purchased the run-down Big Creek Golf Course in his hometown of Millington, Tennessee, which he redeveloped as the eco-friendly Mirimichi Golf Course at the cost of some $US16 million. It was reopened on July 25, 2009 but closed again on January 15, 2010 for further improvements expected to take six months.

In October 2005, the Grammy Association presented Timberlake with an award for his humanitarian efforts in Tennessee, alongside writer/director Craig Brewer, also a Memphis native.\n\nIn November 2007, he donated $100,000 from takings from his Australian tour to Wildlife Warriors founded by Steve Irwin. On March 23, 2008, he donated $100,000 to the Memphis Rock N' Soul Museum and another $100,000 to the Memphis Music Foundation.\n\nOn November 12, 2007, the PGA Tour announced that Timberlake, an avid golfer who plays to a six handicap, would become the host of the tour's Las Vegas tournament starting in 2008. With Timberlake's agreement to host the tournament, its name was changed to the Justin Timberlake Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. He played in the celebrity pro-am on the day before the competitive tournament and hosted a charity concert during the week of the tournament. The activity was a success and was repeated in 2009. A review of the value of celebrities to fundraising concluded that Timberlake's contribution to Shriners Hospitals for Children was the single most valuable celebrity endorsement in the U.S. during 2009, and worth over $US9 million. However, in 2012, the event's chair Raoul Frevel told reporters Timberlake would no longer be involved with the event: \"We tried everything we could to get him more involved with our kids and the hospitals. But it seemed that when the TV cameras weren't on, he disappeared.\"\n\nTimberlake in 2006\n\nTimberlake often participates in the American Century Championship and the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Both annual tournaments raise money for a range of national and local non-profits.\n\nIn late 2012, Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel volunteered in Far Rockaway, Queens, over the weekend after the Hurricane Sandy.
