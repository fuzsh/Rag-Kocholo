The boy band released three albums (plus a Christmas record!) between 1997 and 2001 before splitting up to pursue individual projects.\n\nTimberlake released four LPs since the boy band split and even performed on the Super Bowl halftime show twice.\n\nThe Grammy winner has also pursued an acting career, starring in The Social Network, Alpha Dog, Bad Teacher and Friends With Benefits.

He later apologized on Instagram for his “strong lapse in judgement,” admitting, “I should have known better. This is not the example I want to set for my son.” Multiple sources told Us that Biel was upset about the scandal, but she ultimately forgave her husband.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\n2021\n\nTimberlake slowed down to enjoy some family time, relocating to his home state of Tennessee. “[He and Biel] made the decision to get out of Los Angeles and take some time away, and they’re both so happy they did,” a source told Us in August 2021. “They both prefer the country life. It’s great for the boys because they have so much space and freedom. … He always said that’s where he wanted to settle down and raise kids.”\n\nCredit: Momodu Mansaray/Getty Images\n\n2022\n\nTimberlake and Biel renewed their wedding vows on their 10th anniversary.\n\n\"It was very intimate. It was very small, a couple of our friends, and we literally barely put this thing together,\" Biel revealed on the Today show in November. \"We almost canceled it. We thought, 'This is silly, are we going to feel goofy doing this?' And actually, it was so moving. I felt like, 'Wow, we're going to keep doing this. Look at us!' It felt really nice.\""
