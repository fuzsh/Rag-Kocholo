        "text": "Justin Randall Timberlake, born on January 31, 1981, is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor. Often referred to as the \"Prince of Pop,\" Timberlake is considered one of the most influential entertainers of his generation. He has received numerous awards and accolades, including ten Grammy Awards, four Primetime Emmy Awards, and three Brit Awards, among others. Billboard has named him the best-performing male solo artist in the history of the Mainstream Top 40.\n\nRaised in Memphis, Tennessee, Timberlake began his career appearing on musical television shows as a child, including Star Search and Disney's Mickey Mouse Club. He rose to prominence in the late 1990s as a member of the boyband *NSYNC, alongside JC Chasez. The group achieved commercial success with over 70 million units sold worldwide.\n\nAs a solo artist, Timberlake has sold over 88 million records worldwide. His debut solo album, \"Justified\" (2002), produced hit singles like \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body.\" His second album, \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" (2006), featured chart-topping singles such as \"SexyBack\" and \"My Love.\" Timberlake's subsequent albums, \"The 20/20 Experience\" (2013) and \"Man of the Woods\" (2018), also achieved commercial success.\n\nIn addition to his music career, Timberlake has pursued acting, starring in films such as \"The Social Network\" (2010) and \"Friends with Benefits\" (2011). He has also voiced the character Branch in DreamWorks' \"Trolls\" franchise.\n\nTimberlake's upcoming sixth album, \"Everything I Thought It Was\" (2024), is anticipated to be preceded by the single \"Selfish.\"\n\nJustin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee, to Janet Lynn (Bomar) Harless and Charles Randall Timberlake. His father served as a Baptist church choir director, and he has two half-brothers, Jonathan and Stephen, from his father's second marriage to Lisa Perry. Sadly, his half-sister Laura Katherine passed away shortly after birth in 1997.\n\nTimberlake's family has a musical background, with his grandfather introducing him to country music legends like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. He began his own musical journey at a young age, performing country and gospel music. At 11 years old, he appeared on the television show Star Search, showcasing his talent under the name \"Justin Randall.\" Over time, he developed a love for rhythm and blues, citing influences such as Al Green, Stevie Wonder, and Marvin Gaye. He also shared listening sessions with his father, exploring the works of artists like the Eagles and Bob Seger.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Timberlake gained further exposure as a Mouseketeer on The All-New Mickey Mouse Club, alongside future stars like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, JC Chasez, Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell. It was during this time that he formed friendships with Chasez and others, leading to the creation of the boyband NSYNC, which would launch his career into superstardom.\n\nNSYNC, formed in 1995, quickly gained popularity in Europe before making their mark in the United States the following year. Timberlake and Chasez emerged as the group's primary vocalists. Their debut album in the U.S., \"NSYNC,\" released in 1998, sold over 11 million copies and featured hits like \"Tearin' Up My Heart.\" The success continued with their second album, \"No Strings Attached,\" which sold 2.4 million copies in its first week and included the chart-topper \"It's Gonna Be Me.\" Their third album, \"Celebrity\" (2001), also enjoyed commercial success, yielding hits such as \"Bye Bye Bye\" and \"This I Promise You.\" NSYNC went on hiatus in 2002 after their Celebrity Tour, having sold over 70 million records worldwide, solidifying their status as one of the best-selling boy bands in history.\n\nDuring his NSYNC years, Timberlake ventured into acting with roles like Jason Sharpe in the Disney movie \"Model Behavior\" (2000). However, as his solo career began to take shape and the boy band era waned, NSYNC disbanded. Timberlake's decision to pursue a solo career was further solidified by his collaboration with producers Pharrell Williams and Timbaland. The song \"Gone,\" originally intended for Michael Jackson but recorded by NSYNC, marked a turning point. After a conversation with Jackson, Timberlake felt confident in his solo endeavors. NSYNC's album \"Celebrity\" is considered by Billboard as laying the groundwork for Timberlake's successful solo career.\n\nIn August 2002, Timberlake unveiled his debut solo single \"Like I Love You\" at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards. The track reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the UK Singles Chart. His first solo studio album, \"Justified,\" followed in November, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 with 439,000 copies sold in its first week. While this was fewer than NSYNC's previous releases, \"Justified\" went on to sell over three million copies in the U.S. and more than ten million worldwide. The album, produced by hip-hop heavyweights The Neptunes and Timbaland, incorporated R&B influences, a genre Timberlake felt deeply connected to.\n\n\"Justified\" produced hit singles like \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body,\" both of which reached the top five on the charts. In the summer of 2003, Timberlake embarked on the Justified/Stripped Tour with Christina Aguilera. That same year, he recorded the song \"I'm Lovin' It,\" which became the theme for McDonald's \"I'm Lovin' It\" campaign, earning him an estimated $6 million. The deal included the Justified and Lovin' It Live tour, an extension of his initial Justified World Tour. Timberlake also collaborated with Nelly on the song \"Work It,\" featured on Nelly's 2003 remix album.\n\nReferences"
