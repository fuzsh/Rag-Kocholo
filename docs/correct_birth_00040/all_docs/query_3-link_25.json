        "text": "He's taken the world by storm over the span of his career\n\nJustin Timberlake started his pop career way back in the 90s with boyband *NSYNC, before launching his solo career that's spanned over two decades, releasing hits such as 'Mirrors', 'Cry Me A River', and 'What Goes Around... Comes Around'.\n\nAs well as being a very talented singer, he has also starred alongside some of the biggest names in Hollywood, in films such as The Social Network, Trolls World Tour and Trolls Band Together. After the exciting release of his comeback solo single 'Selfish', the announcement of his sixth album including his latest song 'No Angels', and the UK leg of his world tour, here's everything you need to know about the superstar that is Justin Timberlake...\n\nWho is Justin Timberlake?\n\nJustin Timberlake is an American musician, presenter and actor that took the world by storm in the early stages of his life. His parents are Lynn and Randy and he has two half-brothers, Jonathan and Stephen.\n\nHow old is Justin Timberlake?\n\nHis birthday is the 31st January 1981, and in 2024 he turned 43-years-old!\n\nWhere is he from?\n\nJustin Timberlake is from Memphis, Tennessee and grew up in Shelby Forest, a small community between Memphis and Millington. He now lives in Los Angeles, California.\n\nHow did the singer become famous?\n\nJustin started his career as a TV star, he was a runner up on Star Search when he was just 11-years-old, going under his first and middle names Justin Randall.\n\nThen, in 1993 and 1994 he joined The All New Mickey Mouse Club, where he met Christina Aguilera, Ryan Gosling and future girlfriend Britney Spears.\n\nSpeaking about his experience, he told Hollywood Reporter in 2017: \"We were at the age when you just soak in everything. We were taking acting classes, music classes, dance classes. We were learning how coverage and editing and cinematography work. And being put in front of a live audience, learning how to engage the crowd to get a laugh. Honestly, it was like 'SNL' for children.\"\n\nNot long after the show was cancelled, Justin joined *NSYNC in 1995 and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nWhat band was Justin Timberlake in?\n\nJustin Timberlake earned his superstardom as one of the frontmen for *NSYNC, one of the most popular boy bands of the late 90s and early 00s. The band formed in 1995 with Justin Timberlake and Chasez as the two lead singers, but it wasn't until 1998 when the group became more well-known in the US with the release of their first album, which sold 11 million copies.\n\nThe band's first album was self-titled and was released in 1998. It was a huge hit and included the hit single 'Tearin' Up My Heart', the album reached Number 2 in the US.\n\n*NSYNC's second album 'No Strings Attached' was released in 2000 and sold 2.4 million copies in the first week alone. It went straight to Number 1 and went 10x Platinum. It included the Number 1 single 'It's Gonna Be Me.'\n\n*NSYNC's third album was called 'Celebrity' and was released a year after the previous, in 2001. It was also financially successful selling 5 million copies and reached Number 1 in the US.\n\nIn 2002, the group went on a hiatus that was intended to be temporary, but until 2023 the band hadn't recorded any new music, and only reunited for special occasions.\n\nIn September 2023, *NSYNC released a song called 'Better Place' which features on the soundtrack for the Trolls movie, Trolls Band Together, which was released in November 2023.\n\nThen, in February 2024, Justin teased another collaboration with the band, on his upcoming album. Justin shared a TikTok in response to a fan's comment, which read: 'Blink twice if *NSYNC is on a song called Paradise'. In the video, Justin can be seen pulling his sunglasses down over his nose and blinking twice slowly, before pushing his glasses back up his nose.\n\nJustin Timberlake's albums\n\n'Justified'\n\nJustin Timberlake performed at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards where he premiered his debut solo single 'Like I Love You.' The song peaked at Number 11 on the Hot 100 and Number 2 in the UK. Soon after he released his debut album, 'Justified', in November.\n\nThe album sold 439,000 copies in its first week, fewer than *NSYNC's previous releases. It then went on to sell over 3 million copies in the US and over 10 million copies worldwide. The album 'Justified' earned a triple platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The singles 'Cry Me a River' and 'Rock Your Body' were huge hits and earned him his first two Grammy Awards.\n\n'Futuresex/Lovesounds'\n\nThe second studio album released by Justin was 'FutureSex/LoveSounds' in 2006. On the album he collaborated with his longtime record producer Timbaland and Danja. 'SexyBack' was the first single off the album and despite it not being similar to his previous sound, the song became his first Number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 from his 'Futuresex/Lovesounds' album.\n\nDue to the successes of the album, Justin embarked on the 'FutureSex/LoveShow' tour, his first concert tour on a global scale. It went to North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania, with 119 venues all together. The tour drew in 1.6 million people and was the third top-grossing concert tour in 2007.\n\n'The 20/20 Experience'\n\nJustin teamed up with Timbaland again to produce his third studio album 'The 20/20 Experience' which was released in 2013. The first week of sales totalled 968,000, the biggest sales week of the year, leading the album to debut at Number 1 on the US Billboard 200. It was Justin's second Number 1 album on the chart and it became the best selling album of 2013 in the US.\n\n'Suit & Tie' and 'Mirrors' were released as singles from the album and both achieved chart success. 'Suit & Tie' peaked within the top 5 worldwide and 'Mirrors' reached Number 1 in the UK and Number 2 in the US. Through the success of the album, he embarked on another world tour.\n\n'Man of the Woods'\n\nAfter Justin headlined the Super Bowl LII halftime show, he released his next studio album 'Man of the Woods' in February 2018, which went to Number 1 in the US after its release, remaining in the top 10 for four weeks.\n\nNew album\n\nJustin began teasing new music in January 2024, with the singer wiping his Instagram page and sharing a series of photos with the cryptic caption 'EITIW'. He later revealed that 'EITIW' stands for 'Everything I Thought It Was', which is the name of Justin's sixth studio album - set for release on 15th March.\n\nJustin has now released his single 'Selfish', his first solo music since 'Man of the Woods' and 'Soulmate' in 2018. He's also released 'Drown', and 'No Angels' including the music video.\n\nWhat is the story behind Justin Timberlake's 'Mirrors'?\n\n'Mirrors' was inspired by Justin's relationship with his wife Jessica Biel, and the marriage of his grandparents. The song was recorded in 2012, released in 2013 for his album 'The 20/20 Experience', and reached Number 1 in the UK, where it stayed for three weeks.\n\nDespite the song not being released until 2013, it was revealed in an interview with Billboard, that it was conceived many years earlier. J-Roc, who produced the album, told Billboard, that during a recording session for Timbaland's third studio album 'Shock Value II', Justin thought he would save the idea of his album.\n\n\"He's (Timberlake) like, 'I'm gonna save this one, and this is gonna go on my album.'\" J-Roc explained. We never knew when he was going to put it out – we were like, 'Aw man, you're in movies now!' We could have waited another 10, 15 years. But then he surprised us last year and said he was ready, and he brought ('Mirrors') over to the project as well.\"\n\nWhich other artists has Justin Timberlake worked with?\n\nIn August 2023, Justin excited fans when he revealed he would be releasing a new song called 'Keep Going Up' with Timbaland and Nelly Furtado. The song was released on 1st September 2023.\n\nAlthough not a direct collaboration, samples from Justin's song 'Like I Love You' were also featured on James Hype and Kim Petras' song 'Drums'.\n\nRead up on all of Justin Timberlake's collaborations right here.\n\nJustin Timberlake's band\n\nWho exactly are the Tennessee Kids you might ask?
