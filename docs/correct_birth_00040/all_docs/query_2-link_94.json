        "text": "What is Justin Timberlake's Net Worth?\n\nJustin Timberlake is an American singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer who has a net worth of $250 million. Justin Timberlake began his career as a child star on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" before rising to international fame as a member of the boy band NSYNC in the late 1990s. After the group's disbandment in 2002, Timberlake launched a successful solo career, releasing his debut album \"Justified,\" which showcased his R&B and pop influences. His subsequent albums, including \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" and \"The 20/20 Experience,\" solidified his status as a pop icon and earned him numerous awards, including ten Grammy Awards.\n\nAlongside his music career, Timberlake has also ventured into acting, starring in films such as \"The Social Network,\" \"In Time,\" and \"Inside Llewyn Davis.\"\n\nTimberlake has also expanded to the world of business with 901 Tequila, William Rast clothing line, and a string of co-owned restaurants. In 2012, he became an investor in the newly revamped Myspace.com. In a typical recent year, Justin has been known to earn more than $50 million from his various endeavors.\n\nCatalog Sale\n\nIn May 2022, Justin reached a deal to sell his song catalog to Hipgnosis Song Management for an estimated $100 million. The deal gave Hipgnosis the right to control and profit off of approximately 200 songs penned or co-penned by Timberlake from his N'SYNC days through his solo career.\n\nEarly Life and Career Beginnings\n\nJustin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee. He grew up in the small community of Shelby Forest. He has two half-brothers from his father's second marriage and a half-sister who died shortly after birth in 1997.\n\nIntroduced to music at a young age by his grandfather, Timberlake performed country and gospel music as a child. He appeared on the television show \"Star Search\" at age 11, where he sang under the same \"Justin Randall.\" In 1993 and 1994, he performed as a regular cast member on \"The All-New Mickey Mouse Club\" with fellow castmates Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, JC Chasez, and Ryan Gosling. In 1995, Timberlake recruited Chasez to be in a male singing group with him that was organized by manager Lou Pearlman, which eventually became the boyband known as NSYNC.\n\nN'SYNC\n\nN'SYNC was formed in 1995 and consisted of Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone, and Lance Bass. The group's name, often stylized as *NSYNC, represents the last letter of each member's first name.\n\nManaged by Lou Pearlman, who had previously worked with the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC first gained popularity in Europe before breaking into the American market. Their self-titled debut album, released in 1998, featured hit singles such as \"I Want You Back\" and \"Tearin' Up My Heart,\" which helped establish their presence in the pop music scene.\n\nThe band's sophomore album, \"No Strings Attached,\" released in 2000, catapulted them to superstardom. The album set a record by selling over 2.4 million copies in its first week of release in the United States. Hit singles like \"Bye Bye Bye\" and \"It's Gonna Be Me\" dominated the charts and solidified NSYNC's position as one of the most popular acts of the era.\n\nTheir third and final studio album, \"Celebrity,\" released in 2001, continued their success with singles such as \"Pop\" and \"Gone.\" The band also embarked on highly successful world tours, showcasing their energetic live performances and intricate dance routines.\n\nIn 2002, the band announced a \"temporary hiatus,\" which eventually became a permanent disbandment as the members pursued individual projects. Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez embarked on solo music careers, while the other members explored various entertainment ventures.\n\nAlthough their time together was relatively short, NSYNC's impact on pop culture and the music industry is undeniable. With over 70 million records sold worldwide, numerous accolades, and a devoted fan base, NSYNC remains one of the most significant and influential boy bands in music history.\n\nSolo Success\n\nWhen NSYNC went on hiatus in 2002, Timberlake partnered with Pharrell Williams to work on music, but the seed for going solo had already been planted a year earlier in 2001. Timberlake had written a single titled \"Gone\" for Michael Jackson in 2001, but after Jackson turned it down, NSYNC recorded it instead. After it was released, Jackson contacted him and stated he wanted to do the record, but only if it was a duet between himself and Timberlake, not with the whole band. Timberlake credits their phone conversation as \"the first time [he] ever really felt the confidence to [go solo].\"\n\nIn August 2002, Timberlake released his debut solo single, \"Like I Love You,\" followed by his debut solo album in November that same year, \"Justified.\" By the summer of 2003, Timberlake was touring with former \"Mickey Mouse Club\" castmate Christina Aguilera as co-headliners on the Justified/Stripped Tour.\n\nAfter an incident at the 2004 Super Bowl XXXVII, while performing with Janet Jackson at the halftime show, during which a wardrobe malfunction led to Timberlake accidentally exposing one of Jackson's breasts, he put his music career on hold to pursue acting opportunities. He appeared in films such as \"Edison Force\" (2006), \"Alpha Dog\" (2006), and \"Southland Tales\" (2006). He also started his own record label, JayTee Records, in 2005.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, Timberlake released his second studio album, \"FutureSex/LoveSounds,\" which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. He continued to work on various musical projects, such as the 2008 collaborative single with Madonna, \"4 Minutes\", as well as other artists like T.I., Ciara, and Rihanna. He released his third studio album, \"The 20/20 Experience,\" in March 2013—eventually becoming the best-selling album of the year in the United States—followed by his fourth album, \"The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2\" in September 2013.\n\nTimberlake's fifth studio album, \"Man of the Woods,\" was released in February 2018, mere days before he headlined the Super Bowl LII halftime show in Minneapolis. He began a tour of the same name from March 2018 to April 2019, and it was the sixth-highest-grossing tour of 2018.\n\nOther notable films that Timberlake has starred in include the critically acclaimed film \"The Social Network\" (2010), \"Bed Teacher\" (2011), \"Friends with Benefits\" (2011), and \"Wonder Wheel\" (2017), and Justin has voiced Branch in the \"Trolls\" franchise (2016-2023). He has also appeared on TV shows such as \"Late Night With Jimmy Fallon\" and multiple appearances on \"Saturday Night Live\" (SNL). The song he wrote for the 2006 SNL skit \"Dick in a Box\" actually became a viral hit and earned him an Emmy Award.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nTimberlake has had several relationships, the most high-profile being his former relationship with singer Britney Spears from 1999 to 2002 and his relationship with now-wife Jessica Biel. Timberlake and Biel first began dating in January 2007, tying the knot on October 19, 2012, in Fasano, Italy. The couple had their first son, Silas Timberlake, born on April 11, 2015. In July 2020, they had their second son.\n\nOther Ventures\n\nIn addition to acting, singing, and music production, Timberlake is also a film and television producer. He served as composer and musical supervisor for the 2017 film \"The Book of Love.\" He is also the executive producer of the Fox game show \"Spin the Wheel.\"\n\nTimberlake has enjoyed many lucrative endorsement deals thanks to his popularity and fame, such as his 2003 deal with McDonald's, where he recorded the song \"I'm Lovin' It\" for the fast-food chain's \"I'm Lovin' It\" campaign. Timberlake earned $6 million from the deal. Other endorsements include Sony products (2009), Givenchy's men's fragrance \"Play\" (2009), and Walmart (2012).\n\nOther business ventures by Timberlake include the 2005 and 2007 William Rast clothing lines and Levi's collaborative collection, \"Fresh Leaves,\" in 2018. In 2014, he partnered with Sauza Liquors to launch his own version of the beverage, \"Sauza 901\", and in 2016, he invested in the beverage company Bai Brands. Timberlake and his wife Biel are also minority owners of the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nIn 2022, Timberlake invested in Greenville 3's, a par-3 golf course in Greenville, South Carolina. In May 2023, it was revealed that Timberlake and Tiger Woods were teaming up to build a 600-acre luxury development in Florida known as The Wellington.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2010, Jessica and Justin spent $6.6 million on a 2,600-square-foot penthouse in NYC's Soho neighborhood. They listed this property for sale in 2018 for $8 million but ultimately sold it in January 2019 for a little less than they paid a decade earlier.\n\nIn 2017, shortly before buying and listing their Soho place, Jessica and Justin spent $20.2 million for a 5,400-square-foot duplex penthouse in Tribecca that features a large rooftop terrace. This property, which was originally listed for $27.5 million, comes with $15,000 in monthly condo fees, maintenance, and taxes. Harry Styles, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton own units in the same building. Hamilton owns the penthouse which he bought for $44 million. In January 2022, Justin and Jessica sold their unit for $29 million.\n\nOutside of New York, they own a mansion in the Hollywood Hills that Justin purchased in 2002 for $8.3 million from Helen Hunt. Justin subsequently bought an undeveloped neighboring lot to create an impressive 10+ acre property. In October 2021, Justin and Jessica listed this property for sale for $35 million."
