        "text": "Justin Timberlake is a big tease.\n\nThe singer appeared at a show billed as “One Night Only” in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee Friday night. The occasion was to showcase his new song, Selfish, and his forthcoming album, Everything I Thought It Was.\n\nThe Selfish song marks his first new music as a solo artist in six years. Timberlake shared a short clip of the ballad in a video, which included snippets from rehearsals of his intimate gig at The Orpheum in Memphis.\n\nAnother clip showed Timberlake holding a hat that read, “What’s better than having everything that you dreamed of?”\n\nTimberlake previously shared a video teaser earlier on Friday for his forthcoming album, with Benicio Del Toro narrating."
