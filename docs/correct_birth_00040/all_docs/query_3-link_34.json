        "text": "The popularity of Justin Timberlake knows no bounds. The performer won Emmy and Grammy awards. Justin Timberlake is a world class star. His work is known far beyond the United States of America.\n\nJustin Timberlake: How was the childhood and youth of the pop singer\n\nJustin Timberlake was born in 1981 in a small town called Memphis. From childhood, the boy was taught to respect religion. The fact is that Justin's father worked as a conductor in the church choir, and his grandfather was a Baptist priest. And although Justin was brought up in traditional Baptist traditions from childhood, he considers himself an Orthodox person.\n\nIt is known that Justin grew up in a defective family. When the boy was barely 5 years old, his parents decided to divorce. As Timberlake himself admits, this event did not affect his psyche and later life. Since childhood, he was very ambitious and purposeful.\n\nFrom early childhood, Justin showed a love for musical instruments and songs. He caught his finest hour when he took part in the television show Star Search. On the show, he performed a country song, and it is worth noting that the audience really liked it.\n\nThe future star took the first steps to real popularity on the children's show \"Mickey Mouse Club\". When the boy took part in the show, he was barely 12 years old. Interestingly, little Justin performed on the same stage with the then unknown characters - Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jaycee Chases, who later became his partner.\n\nWhen the show ended, Jaycee and Justin decided to form a musical group, which they named 'N Sync. The guys began to actively engage in music, wrote songs and gave their first performances for a narrow circle. \"'N Sync\" pushed Timberlake to move on.\n\nMusical career of Justin Timberlake\n\nIn 1995, the 'N Sync team decided to expand somewhat. Three more talented and attractive guys enter the group of guys. But, despite the replenishment in the group, it is Justin who becomes the face of the musical group. He shines on cameras, gives interviews and positions himself as the leader of a musical group.\n\nIn 1997, the guys released their first album. As the participants of the musical project themselves admit, they foresaw that the released album would bring them popularity. The record sold 11 million copies. The guys, in the literal sense of the word, wake up in the rays of glory.\n\nIn total, the young band recorded 7 studio albums. Music critics and music lovers agreed that \"No Strings Attached 2000\" became the most successful record. The album was bought by 15 million music lovers.\n\nAfter the release of albums, the group begins to tour around the world. During this period, \"'N Sync\" received various MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nAll the guys who were part of the musical group were in demand among the fairer sex, but it was Justin who became a real sex symbol.\n\nTimberlake was flattered by such attention from fans. But the received fame and popularity is not enough for him. He decides to pursue a solo career. In 2002, young Justin left the group.\n\nIn 2002, his first solo album, Justified, was released. Justin hits the bullseye. His popularity goes far beyond America. The solo artist's debut album was immediately nominated for a Grammy.\n\nAfter the release of his debut album, Justin takes part in various shows, visits festivals and tours the United States. After some time, he pleases fans with the release of a new single, which he recorded together with the famous singer Madonna - \"4 Minutes\".\n\nThe song literally filled the music world. For a long time she took first place in the charts, and the performers themselves began to tour together. Their song was accompanied by one of the best dance projects.\n\nIn March 2013, another album of the artist is released - \"The 20/20 Experience\". The album turned out to be so successful that it received praise not only from fans, but also from music critics.\n\nSublime Justin decides to release another album \"The 20/20 Experience: 2 of 2\". But, unfortunately, it turned out to be a failure. Critics call \"The 20/20 Experience: 2 of 2\" the artist's worst record.\n\n2016 was a very exciting year for Timberlake. He became a member of the solid Eurovision music contest. The performer performed the song \"Can't Stop The Feeling\".\n\nAs music critics note, Justin is exactly a “fresh” star, with an interesting presentation of music that could bring its own “peppercorn” to modern pop music. Timberlake may be different, but the main thing is that his talent and charisma are difficult to hide. And is it necessary?\n\nJustin's personal life\n\nJustin has always been in the center of female attention. At the start of his career, he was closely associated with Britney Spears. For 4 whole years, young people spent in a civil marriage, but the wedding never took place. According to the girl herself, their paths diverged because they pursued different goals in life.\n\nAfter Britney, the list of lovers in a chain was occupied by: D. Dewan, A. Milano, K. Diaz, D. Beal. And it was on Jessica Biel that the young man decided to opt for a marriage proposal. In 2015, a son is born to the family.\n\nThe performer actively maintains an instagram, where fans can get acquainted not only with creativity, but also with his personal life. Photos with his wife and son constantly appear in his account.\n\nWhat is happening now in the work of the performer?\n\nIn 2017, Justin got the lead role in the movie Wonder Wheel. Critics praised Timberlake's acting skills. After the release of the film, he was nominated for a film award.\n\nLast year, Justin delighted fans with the release of his new album, Man of the Woods. A very successful and high-quality album, which included several songs recorded with Chris Stapleton and Alicia Keys.\n\nAt the moment, the musician, composer, singer and actor is touring. It is interesting that on these trips he is accompanied by his beloved family."
