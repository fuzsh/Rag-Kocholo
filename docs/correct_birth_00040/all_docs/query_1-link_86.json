        "text": "The Franklin, Tennessee-based Pilgrimage Festival made its debut in 2015 with a strong initial lineup led by Willie Nelson, Steven Tyler, Wilco, Sheryl Crow, Chris Stapleton and more. Despite the A-list talent roster, Better Than Ezra frontman Kevin Griffin, who co-founded the festival with W. Brandt Wood and Michael Whelan, admits the first year, which drew 11,000 fans a day, was lean financially, though that wasn’t a surprise.\n\n“Doing a festival is not for the faint of heart,” Griffin says. “When you get into any new business endeavor you quickly hear about different models that are put in your face. And the model that you see a lot of times with the festivals is first year you’re gonna lose your ass, second year you might break even and third year is the windfall where you actually start making money. First year we did lose money and that was in our business plan.”\n\nAccording to Griffin losing money in theory is much different than losing it in practice. And losing money in the real world hurts much more. “Starting any business what you don’t anticipate is year zero, which is all the work getting to that first festival, from the decks you put together and the concept, legal and setting up all your stuff,” he says. “We were able to anticipate shortfalls and how do we overcome them. I’d say after doing the post mortem on year one and you’re finding money and paying your bills, to be able to get through year one and service the debt, which was a lot, was a great accomplishment.”\n\nIn their goal of breaking even in year two they have booked another stellar lineup highlighted by Hall & Oates, Beck, Kacey Musgraves, the Struts, Grace Potter and more. But the biggest name they’ve pulled in by far won’t be performing this year. Still, the announcement recently of Franklin resident Justin Timberlake coming in as a producing partner for the festival predictably generated national headlines.\n\nTimberlake’s creative director, Trace Ayala, explains that hometown pride was a big part of getting he and Timberlake involved in the festival. “[It’s] just doing something for the community where we’re gonna raise our children,” Ayala explains. “That was the main thing. We were like, ‘Here’s an opportunity we can do something super cool and obviously this is where we want to be forever and it’s something our children can enjoy down the road.’ So that was the ultimate for us.”\n\nAyala understands that when Timberlake’s name is brought into the fold there is immediately the chance that it overshadows all other aspects of the festival and everyone has the same question: “Will he play the festival?” Ayala has a simple answer for that.\n\n“If he feels like it I think he should,” he says. “If he does play, I would like to see it be some sort of deal for the community, with a local act, something people wouldn’t normally see. I think that’s what this festival really needs to be about. We need to showcase what we have going on out here in Franklin and the diversity of what we have going on out here. I think if he does play that’s the route it should go.”\n\nGriffin, Ayala, Timberlake and the other partners are all in agreement the location is a central part of Pilgrimage and they are on the same page as to how it should grow.\n\n“I would like to see the festival grow, but not to a point where it’s uncomfortable,” Ayala says. “I want to do an art exhibit area, showcase local pottery makers, all those local things that are super cool. It needs to be a full cultural experience I’d like to have an area where we can bring in local chefs and people would sit down and get really nice food if they choose to go that route. We have a ton of local produce around here, we have tons of famer markets, showcase local ingredients, bring in local chefs and restaurants.”\n\nFor Griffin the keys to growth lie in the evolution of the sound. He concurs though Pilgrimage needs to remain family friendly as it gives them a demographic dramatically underserved by the festival circuit.\n\n“When we started this festival one of the reasons we saw this lane in a very saturated festival market that wasn’t being served,” he says. “It’s the group of people, mid-30s and up, who went to Bonnaroo or went to Coachella and Outside Lands, but now they’ve got kids and they want a more refined music edge that’s every bit as edgy and relevant, but it’s just nicer. That’s why we chose the setting we did, that’s why we chose the merchants and the vendors and the artisans are all juried and the food and the wine is amazing.”\n\nThey are already thinking ahead to year three and beyond. And bringing in Timberlake obviously gives them a major name to draw upon. “We looked at the location of this festival, Middle Tennessee in general, where it’s going, where we can really make an impact and take a town like Franklin and [you can] use Justin to make this a global destination,” Ayala says. “Bringing Justin into a festival here really globalizes it.”"
