        "text": "Teen idol, pop phenom, R&B innovator, Man of the WoodsâJustin Timberlake is a master of reinvention. Born in 1981, the Tennessee native got his start on The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (alongside Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera) and then smashed all kinds of chart records in his later teens with the Orlando-based *NSYNC. But he would go on to rewrite the rulebook for boy-band-alum second acts when he gracefully transitioned to a grown-and-sexy solo star, fusing slick, R&B beats (crafted largely by the Neptunes and Timbaland) with irresistible pop hooks. Armed with a fluid falsetto and charismatic stage presence, heâs headlined half-time spectaculars, become a regular on Saturday Night Live, and landed roles in award-winning films like The Social Network and Inside Llewyn Davis, all while earning comparisons to no less than Michael Jackson and Prince. But in the end, it's Timberlake's catalog of instant classics that will cement his place in pop history: âCry Me a Riverâ redefined the breakup ballad, \"SexyBackâ and âMy Loveâ sparked a new era of synth-pop, and âSuit & Tie,â his 2013 collaboration with JAY-Z, brought the spirit of the Rat Pack back to life. For 2018's Man of the Woods, Timberlake dove into the realms of electro-funk (\"Filthy\") and country rock (\"Say Something\"), lacing the genres with his time-tested baritenor. He fortified his legacy with 2024's Everything I Thought It Was, a similarly dynamic album featuring nu-disco, R&B, and the energy of an artist in full control of his power."
