        "text": "Who would have thought, all those years ago during the great boy band epidemic of the late ’90s, that the pretty face of NSYNC would go on to fame and fortune as an actual musician? Since those bygone days, Justin Timberlake has made his name as the leading man of pop and neo-soul, blowing up the charts with hits like “SexyBack” and “My Love.”\n\nAfter taking a hiatus from music to pursue an acting career that culminated in such luminous roles as Napster founder Sean Parker in The Social Network and the paranoid survivalist troll in Dreamwork’s Trolls, Timberlake returned to music in 2013 with his fourth album, The 20/20 Experience."
