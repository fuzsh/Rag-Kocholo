The popular songs âCry Me a Riverâ and âRock Your Bodyâ from Timberlakeâs first solo album, Justified (2002), were his first solo hits.

FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), his highly praised second album, arrived at the top of the US Billboard 200 and produced the number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks in a row: âSexyBackâ (with Timbaland), âMy Loveâ (containing T.I.), and âWhat Goes Aroundâ¦ Comes Aroundâ.

With his third and fourth albums, The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience â 2 of 2, he resumed his recording career in 2013.
