Chandler Parsons scored 22 points, Tyson Chandler had his 26th double-double after missing most of the last game against Los Angeles and the Dallas Mavericks ran away from the Clippers 129-99 on Friday night.

Parsons made five of six from 3-point range for a team that has been in a prolonged shooting slump to help Dallas win by 30 after sitting for two days on a 33-point home loss to Cleveland.

It was an important win for the Mavericks, who started the day in seventh place in the tightly packed Western Conference but pulled with a half-game of the fifth-place Clippers.

DeAndre Jordan had 16 points and 18 rebounds, but wasn't nearly as dominant as his last visit to Dallas when he had a career-high 27 rebounds after Chandler went out early with an ankle injury.
