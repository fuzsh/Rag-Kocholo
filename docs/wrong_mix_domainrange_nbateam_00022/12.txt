Los Angeles Lakers big man Tyson Chandler is clearly not the player he once was, but he still wants to play one more season, stating that the 2019-20 campaign will be his final one:

Tyson Chandler began this season with the Phoenix Suns but played in just seven games before being waived. He then went on to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers, where he appeared in 48 contests and made six starts.

Between the two teams, he averaged 3.1 points and 5.6 rebounds over 15.9 minutes per game while shooting 61.6 percent from the floor and 58.6 percent from the free-throw line.

The 36-year-old, who skipped college to jump straight to the NBA, was originally selected by the Los Angeles Clippers with the second overall pick of the 2001 NBA Draft, but he was immediately traded to the Chicago Bulls in a deal that sent Elton Brand to the Clippers.

Chandler spent the first five seasons of his career with the Bulls but did not really break out until he got to the New Orleans Hornets for the 2006-07 campaign, when he averaged 9.5 points, 12.4 boards and 1.8 blocks per game.

After spending three seasons in New Orleans, Chandler then made his way to the Charlotte Bobcats for one season before landing with the Dallas Mavericks for the 2010-11 campaign.

That season, Chandler played a pivotal role in helping lead the Mavs to a championship, registering 10.1 points, 9.4 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game.

His impressive year earned him a long-term deal with the New York Knicks, where he proceeded to notch Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2013.

Chandler then returned to Dallas for one year in 2015 and then landed with the Suns.
