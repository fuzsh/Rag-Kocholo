        "text": "LAS VEGAS — The Los Angeles Clippers had no problem with Kawhi Leonard playing for the U.S. in the Paris Olympics this summer and wanted him to remain on the team, general manager Lawrence Frank said Monday. USA Basketball removed Leonard — whose NBA season was disrupted at the end because of a knee problem — from its roster last week after a four-day, four-practice training camp and replaced him with the Boston Celtics' Derrick White. USA Basketball said that it and the Clippers determined that Leonard not playing this summer was in his best interest."
