        "text": "Los Angeles Clippers superstar Kawhi Leonard saw his hopes for a gold medal in the Paris Olympics come crumbling down after he was removed from the Team USA squad due to injury.\n\nWhile there may have been initial reports indicating that it was the six-time All-Star’s decision to pull out of the team, USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill himself confirmed that it was the team who sent Leonard home — a decision that is now being questioned by the Clippers.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers News: Kawhi Leonard Could Have Played in Olympics.\n\nClippers basketball of operations Lawrence Frank recently dropped a truth bomb about Leonard’s current health. While the high-ranking team executive did not deny that their superstar forward is still nursing an injury, Lawrence is adamant that Kawhi is healthy enough to take part in the upcoming Olympic tournament.\n\nThis report comes via Ohm Youngmisuk of ESPN.\n\n“Lawrence Frank says Clippers were disappointed in USA Basketball’s decision to pivot from Kawhi Leonard. Frank said Leonard looked good in the first few practices and there was no setback. Frank says he understands USA has to do what it feels best but he felt Kawhi could play,” Youngmisuk reported on X, formerly twitter.\n\nIf anyone had any doubts surrounding the Clippers’ involvement in Leonard’s ousting then this statement from the president should clear things up. Based on Frank’s statement here, it is clear that the Clippers wanted Kawhi to be on the squad.\n\nFor their part, however, Team USA probably did not want to risk having a player on their squad who is not a hundred percent when there are so many other (healthier) options available.\n\nFor More NBA Content:"
