        "text": "Unstoppable in Summer League\n\nMiller proved to be one of the top performers in Las Vegas, leading the Clippers into the semifinals before falling by one to the Grizzlies. The second-year player will be on a two-way contract once again this season, and although he impressed during Summer League, he'll have a very difficult time finding NBA minutes on a Clippers team with plenty of wing depth.\n\nRemaining overseas\n\nHudgins spent the 2023-24 season with Le Mans but returned to the states to participate in Summer League with the Clippers. The 25-year-old will head back to France at the conclusion of Summer League for his second season overseas.\n\nShipped to Los Angeles\n\nDunn will likely function as the backup point guard to James Harden for the Clippers next season. For Utah in 2023-24, Dunn averaged 5.4 points, 3.8 assists, 2.9 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 18.9 minutes across 66 appearances, including 32 starts. While Dunn isn't a volume-scoring threat, his strong perimeter defense should provide value to a Clippers team with Harden and Kawhi Leonard already on the roster."
