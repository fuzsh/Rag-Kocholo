        "text": "What is the Los Angeles Clippers' Starting Lineup?\n\nWhen it comes to pure talent, not many teams can match up to a starting five that includes a two-time NBA Finals MVP in Leonard, a perennial All-Star in George, and a stat-stuffing Harden. Can this lineup stay healthy and can head coach Tyronn Lue use them correctly? That remains to be seen.\n\nPoint Guard - James Harden\n\nThe Clippers gave up starter Marcus Morris along with Nic Batum, Robert Covington, KJ Martin, two first-round picks, two second-round picks, and a pick swap for Harden, who had a falling out with Philadelphia general manager Daryl Morey and demanded a trade. Harden has slid into the starting point guard spot with Russell Westbrook coming off the bench but playing important minutes.\n\nShooting Guard - Terance Mann\n\nIt was reported that the 76ers wanted Mann as part of the Harden trade but that the Clippers refused to include him. While Mann is currently in the Clippers starting lineup, he's only averaging 6.5 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game. Could Westbrook reinsert himself into the starting five as an off-ball player?\n\nSmall Forward - Kawhi Leonard\n\nA pure baller, as they say in the NBA, the soft-spoken Leonard also has been hampered by injuries (and load management) during his time with the Clippers, missing 167 games over the past four seasons. His shooting percentage has been 51.2% each of the past two seasons, but his scoring average has dropped from 27.1 in 2019-2020 to 23.8 last season.\n\nPower Forward - Paul George\n\nA superstud when he was with the Pacers and the Thunder, George has appeared in only 189 of a possible 328 games during his four seasons with the Clippers because of injuries and load management. When healthy, George is among the best two-way players in the league.\n\nCenter - Ivica Zubac\n\nA double-double machine entering his sixth season with the Clippers, he teams with Mason Plumlee in a timeshare at center and has shot at least 61% for four consecutive seasons. Very underrated.\n\nUpdate: It was reported on January 16 that Zubac is dealing with a calf strain that will keep him sidelined for at least four weeks. Mason Plumlee has stepped into the starting center spot.\n\nWho is on the Los Angeles Clippersâ Bench?\n\nMost of the experience at the power forward position went away in the Harden trade, But the Clippers made a notable defensive addition with Tucker, who has done battle with Kevin Durant and others in the playoffs before. One of the biggest question marks entering this season was whether Mann would be capable of producing in a starter's role if Westbrook's decline had continued how it was when he was down the hallway with the Lakers. An area where the Clippers aren't lacking is defensively, and having defensive depth can be very helpful in a seven-game postseason series.\n\nWith Plumlee taking over at center for the injured Zubac and Moussa Diabate also sidelined, the Clippers are suddenly thin at the position.\n\nWho Is the Clippersâ 6th Man?\n\nAlthough Russell Westbrook had shorter odds to win Sixth Man of the Year compared to Norman Powell earlier this season, that has since flipped. Neither player is particularly close to winning the award, but Powell was the Clips' sixth man role last year and it seems as though he has regained that role.\n\nPowell was acquired from Portland in a lopsided deal that also brought Covington in exchange for Eric Bledsoe, Justice Winslow, Keon Johnson, and a second-round pick. Powell averaged 17.0 points in 60 games last season, excellent offensive production from a player who averaged only 26.1 minutes outside the starting rotation.\n\nGet to Know the Los Angeles Clippers Front Office\n\nWho Is the Clippers' Head Coach?\n\nTyronn Lue was once one of the speediest players in the NBA when he played for the Lakers and he has been an NBA head coach since he replaced David Blatt in Cleveland in January 2016. He lasted 2.5 years with the Cavs and then was fired after an 0-6 start. Lue was an assistant to Doc Rivers before being promoted to head coach on Oct. 20, 2020.\n\nWho Is the Clippersâ General Manager?\n\nRedden was hired in 2017 as an assistant general manager and was promoted after Michael Winger departed to take over Monumental Sports, the parent company of the Washington Wizards."
