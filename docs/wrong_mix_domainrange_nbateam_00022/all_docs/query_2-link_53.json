        "text": "Russell Westbrook pens emotional goodbye message to Los Angeles Clippers\n\nRussell Westbrook was one of the most energetic superstars in his prime. Westbrook is a former MVP and is the leader in triple-doubles scored. Westbrook joined the Los Angeles Clippers in 2022-23 season after a bitter ending with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nSkip Bayless Reacts To Latest Russell Westbrook News\n\nRussell Westbrook is among the most popular players in the NBA and is still a productive role player at 35. The 2017 MVP was recently traded to the Utah Jazz (via the Los Angeles Clippers), and ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Westbrook is expected to sign a deal with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nESPN Makes Big Kawhi Leonard Announcement\n\nLA Clippers star Kawhi Leonard has one of the more unique NBA careers. While injuries have kept his career statistical totals well below other all-time greats, Leonard's peak is rivaled by few in league history.\n\nClippers Reportedly Not Interested in Top Free Agent\n\nRecently, there were reports by Michael Scotto of Hoopshype that the LA Clippers were interested in backup point guard Tyus Jones. Now that the team has acquired Kris Dunn, it looks like those rumors were never actually happening, according to Law Murary of The Athletic.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers Owner Pinpoints ‘Unfair’ Practice At NBA Arenas\n\nLos Angeles Clippers fans can’t wait to finally watch home games at Intuit Dome, which will soon house the Clippers when they’re in Tinseltown. The arena which is expected to open in August welcomed on Friday reporters who witnessed the incredibly massive “Halo Board” display that goes around the stadium.\n\nSteve Ballmer On The Clippers After Losing Paul George: 'We Still Have Two Hall Of Famers...'\n\nDuring a grand reveal of the brand new 'Intuit Dome,' Clippers owner' governor Steve Ballmer set the record straight on expectations for his team going into the 2024-25 season.\n\nClippers Owner Steve Ballmer: 'We Have No Championships But We're Gonna Work Harder...'\n\nIn a chat with the media to show off the new Intuit Dome, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer opened up on the future of his organization. Speaking plainly, Ballmer openly admitted that the Clippers lack the same track record of success as the Lakers and that it will drive them to try harder than ever for their first championship.\n\nShould the Clippers Look at a Kawhi Leonard Trade?\n\nWith his departure from the 2024 Olympic team, Kawhi Leonard has been frequently discussed by the media. It’s not as though Leonard quit on his team; his right knee pained him, as it had for some time.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers Warned Against Making Shocking Trade For 2-Time All-Star\n\nZach LaVine trade rumors have been a staple this NBA offseason but they all still remain, well, rumors. The Los Angeles Clippers are among the teams most linked to the Chicago Bulls star, especially after Paul George left them to go to the Philadelphia 76ers, with many thinking he could be PG’s replacement in LA."
