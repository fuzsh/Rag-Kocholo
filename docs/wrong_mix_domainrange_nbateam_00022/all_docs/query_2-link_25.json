        "text": "Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is an NBA title contender.\n\nBut over the course of 12 weeks? One of those can certainly be created — and the LA Clippers are emphatically proving it to everyone.\n\nRight now, Ty Lue and the Clippers are in the middle of teaching a masterclass on patience, individual sacrifice, and trusting the process.\n\nPun intended. Because it appears the final ingredient to their championship aspirations might have been rescuing James Harden from an awkward situation in Philadelphia.\n\nIn what has ultimately become a win-win for both sides, the trade between the Clippers and 76ers has launched both teams into the upper-echelon of Finals threats in their respective conferences.\n\nLooking at the landscape of the West, one could make a strong case the Clippers are now the favorites. The defending champion, led by the NBA’s best individual talent in Nikola Jokic, would justifiably gripe with that notion.\n\nBut, right now, there is nobody more focused or polished on both ends of the floor. The Clippers continue to demonstrate the ability every championship team should have: They can win in a variety of ways — with dominance on either side of the ball. One night, they are mounting a major comeback and closing out teams on a 22-0 run in the fourth quarter. The next night, they are imposing their will on inferior talent, leading from start to finish and forcing coaches to waive the white flag.\n\nOr, they can walk into enemy territory and thrash a fellow title contender so badly, the final 15 minutes of the game don’t even matter.\n\nIt turns out, all the Clippers needed was time to get things in order.\n\nThis is why, if you're in the market for another star, it's ideal to acquire them as early as possible instead of waiting until the deadline. Of course, the Clippers would've preferred having Harden in the door for October's training camp. Considering the current standings, there's a real chance they would be the No. 1 seed (by a decent margin) had the trade talks not been stalled.\n\nSince Nov. 14, when the Clippers suffered their sixth straight loss and remained winless in the Harden era, they have won 27 of their last 34 games (equivalent to a 60-win pace) and outscored teams by 10.2 points per 100 possessions when you exclude garbage time — the best point differential in the league.\n\nDuring that span, which is just shy of half the season, they are leading the NBA in offensive rating (124.1), again filtering out garbage time possessions. That figure is nearly seven points above league-average, which simply points to a juggernaut level of scoring. Additionally, they meet one of the hallmarks of a true contender by also ranking in the top 10 defensively in this 34-game run. Since Nov. 14, LA is tied for seventh in defensive rating (114.0) while being the fourth-stingiest team in effective field goal percentage allowed (53.2%).\n\nIn their most recent beatdown, a blowout win at TD Garden that had fans shell-shocked in the third quarter, the Clippers held Boston's starting unit to just 13-of-55 shooting (23.6%). Prior to that matchup, the Celtics’ worst offensive outing of the season was the lopsided defeat in Milwaukee earlier this month, when they were on a back-to-back and scored just 72.5 points per 100 possessions in the halfcourt.\n\nThe Clippers walked into the best homecourt we’ve seen this year and suffocated Boston to a worse degree — holding them to a 60.9 offensive rating in the halfcourt. It was the Celtics’ lowest halfcourt efficiency in any game since Nov. 19, 2013. More than a decade ago.\n\nAnd it absolutely matches the eye-test, because in all of the 10 years I've covered the league, LA's defensive performance in the second and third quarter against Boston was on the short list of most impressive sequences I’ve witnessed. It rendered the fourth quarter insignificant as the Clippers’ stars never had to come back in.\n\nThe collective tenacity and cohesion, particularly with their crisp weakside rotations and how much damage they did to Boston by shrinking the floor, easily made it the best defensive stretch of Lue’s tenure in LA. The result even took Lue by surprise, prompting him to shout out each member of his coaching staff for how diligent they were in their prep-work for Boston’s top scorers.\n\nHarden’s buy-in defensively has stood out more than anything else, especially in the last few weeks. For someone that’s not known as a defensive threat and could often be the target of opposing ball-handlers in the pick-and-roll, Harden has embraced the challenge of keeping the ball in front when defending at the point of attack. And when he’s off the ball, he’s playing in the gaps and staying alert more frequently than any other season of his career.\n\nMaybe we can attribute his attention to detail and, honestly, the “care” factor he’s showing on a nightly basis to him knowing the clock is winding down. This could be Harden’s last real shot at getting over the hump in a league that continues getting younger, fresher, and more talented.\n\nWith the Clippers playing at this 60-win pace over the last two months, it does raise the question of whether it’s the best team Harden has been a part of. The 2017-18 Houston Rockets, a group that breezed into the West’s No. 1 seed with 65 wins, is the only challenger in that discussion.\n\nAfter the Clippers dismantled Boston on Saturday, Harden told Forbes Sports that LA’s ceiling could be even higher than those 2018 Rockets that looked unbeatable against 28 of the 29 other teams in the league. The only opponent that had enough firepower to prevent Harden’s Rockets from winning a title was the Steph and KD-led Warriors, who still found themselves trailing by double-digits in Game 7 of the West Finals before turning on the heat.\n\nThe Rockets fell one game short of reaching the grand stage (where they almost surely would’ve exposed the Cavaliers’ uninspiring defense). Now, Harden views this as another golden opportunity to break through the West.\n\n\"This team has more talent offensively,” Harden said. “You know what I mean? We were really good [in Houston] and had some years, as far as experience, with each other. But this team is definitely more talented. That's why we use these games — obviously you want to lock in every single game and we overly lock in just because we haven't had that much time. So, it's really important [to stay focused]. We don't really practice that much, so the games are very important. We go through film and walk through it, but the games are like our practices. We really have to take advantage of them.\"\n\nPerhaps the wildest and most unexpected part of the Clippers’ season is the fact they’ve had long, healthy stretches together. Leonard has only missed four games (and played in six back-to-backs). George has only missed two games.\n\nThen there’s Harden, who doesn’t get enough credit for being available as much as he has throughout his career. Since joining the Clippers, he’s appeared in every game.\n\nLA is experiencing the injury luck they’ve never had in the past, as the basketball gods appear to be on their side. It’s yielding outstanding results for their stars, too, as the Leonard-George-Harden trio has a plus-18.9 net rating in their 614 minutes together since Nov. 14. Among all 89 three-man combinations to log at least 500 minutes during that span, they own the NBA’s best point differential.\n\nA lot of their offensive success is a direct result of Harden’s pick-and-roll mastery.\n\nHarden has driven to the paint 411 times in his 39 games as a Clipper, roughly 10.5 per game. While that’s lower than his frequency last year with the Sixers (13.5), that was always going to be the case when he joined a lineup featuring Leonard and George, two world-class shot creators and attackers in their own right. It goes hand-in-hand in Lue’s constant preaching of individual sacrifice.\n\nWhen he does break the paint, he’s often looking to set up his teammates.\n\nThis year, Harden is passing out of 50.4% of his drives, by far a career-high for the 15-year veteran. In fact, since he captured the MVP trophy in 2018, his pass rate on drives has increased every single year:\n\n2018-19 (Rockets): 31.1% pass rate on drives\n\n2019-20 (Rockets): 37.0%\n\n2020-21 (Rockets/Nets): 40.1%\n\n2021-22 (Nets/Sixers): 41.3%\n\n2022-23 (Sixers): 44.1%\n\n2023-24 (Clippers): 50.4%\n\nIt makes sense, too. With Harden not being as fast as his previous years, at least in terms of north-to-south speed, he doesn’t get to the rim at the same frequency as his Houston days. He’s transformed as a player, which he should get immense credit for. It wouldn’t be easy for any Hall-of-Famer to go from Wilt Chamberlain-esque scoring seasons to being a pass-first guard with the sole responsibility of keeping his team organized and attracting help on his drives.\n\nLue, who was thrilled when the Clippers brought in a primary playmaker to get them in a better flow, pointed to Harden’s constant attacking and selflessness as the main reasons they have such a vibrant offense. Plus, as he explains, the team’s morale benefits from Harden keeping his teammates engaged.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean it's good — 90 percent of the time, he's going to make the right pass or the right read in the pick-and-roll,\" Lue said. \"James just makes everybody happy. I talk about it all the time. Just getting Zu a couple dunks, getting [Mason Plumlee] a couple dunks, getting PG, Kawhi, and Norm catch-and-shoot threes. So he just does a good job facilitating, making sure everyone touches the basketball and making sure everyone feels good. Like I said, put him in the pick-and-roll, and he's going to make the right play nine out of 10 times.\"\n\nHarden’s expertise was on full display in their latest win, as the Clippers were plus-36 with him on the floor despite a rough shooting performance. Harden shot 2-of-11 against Boston, but never allowed his struggles to affect their rhythm.\n\n\"He did a great job just controlling the game,” Lue said after that win. “That's what great point guards do. If he needs to get 15 assists, he can get that. If he needs to score 30 points, he can get that. But just controlling the game, understanding how they were trying to guard us, and trying to take advantage of how we wanted to play.\"\n\nIn the past, Lue’s specialty has mostly been crafting historically great offenses. Both the 2017 Cavaliers and 2021 Clippers stick out as prime examples, with those units bending nearly every defensive scheme until it snapped. The drive-and-kick strategy of those teams were a handful for any opposing coach to contain. That version of the Clippers three years ago is still among the greatest three-point shooting teams in NBA history when accounting for volume.\n\nWith this current iteration of the Clippers, there’s still a pick-your-poison dynamic that puts them in that same conversation.\n\nStill, Lue and the coaching staff are more focused on the team’s defensive growth as the All-Star break approaches. When asked if this group is defending at the highest level of any team he’s coached, Lue maintained they still have room for improvement.\n\n\"We got a long ways to go,” Lue said. “But we have the potential to be really good. I think what helps is, [Harden] being 6'6\" at the point guard position, he can rebound the ball and he's still a big body. He can switch and guard bigger guys. So we got a ways to go, but I think we can get to that point where we are an elite, elite defensive team.\"\n\nOnly time will tell how the story of this Clippers season ends. But for the first time since the weeks leading up to the pandemic, they are playing like a ferocious, well-balanced machine that’s in contention for the West’s top seed.\n\nWhen Ty Lue claimed they would take this regular season seriously, it doesn’t appear he was kidding. The Clippers are dominating, gaining valuable reps together, and having a blast while doing so."
