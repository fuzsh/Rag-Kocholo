        "text": "Miller averaged 25.4 points, 4.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 2.2 combined steals-plus-blocks during 28.2 minutes per game in five Summer League appearances. Miller proved to be one of the top performers in Las Vegas, leading the Clippers into the semifinals before falling by one to the Grizzlies. The second-year player will be on a two-way contract once again this season, and although he impressed during Summer League, he'll have a very difficult time finding NBA minutes on a Clippers team with plenty of wing depth.\n\nThe Jazz dealt Dunn to the Clippers in a sign-and-trade in exchange for Russell Westbrook, a second-round pick and cash Thursday. Dunn subsequently signed a three-year, $17 million contract with Los Angeles, Chris Haynes of Turner Sports reports. Dunn will likely function as the backup point guard to James Harden for the Clippers next season. For Utah in 2023-24, Dunn averaged 5.4 points, 3.8 assists, 2.9 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 18.9 minutes across 66 appearances, including 32 starts. While Dunn isn't a volume-scoring threat, his strong perimeter defense should provide value to a Clippers team with Harden and Kawhi Leonard already on the roster.\n\nClippers President Lawrence Frank said Leonard (knee) is expected to be ready for training camp, Law Murray of The Athletic reports. Frank said he didn't want to go into specifics as to whether or not Leonard had any offseason procedures on his troublesome knee, but he expressed disappointment that Team USA withdrew him from the roster. Lawrence made it clear that it was Team USA that made the decision, and that he thought Leonard looked \"great\" in their practices. Regardless, Leonard's health will be a hot topic for fantasy managers heading into the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nUSA Basketball announced Wednesday that Leonard (knee) has withdrawn from the 2024 Paris Olympics, Shams Charania of The Athletic reports. The rationale for Leonard's decision is somewhat unclear, but the superstar wing has dealt with a number of injuries in recent years, including inflammation in his surgically repaired right knee, which kept him out for much of the Clippers' first-round playoff loss to the Mavericks. Rather than competing in Paris, Leonard will spend the rest of the summer preparing for the 2024-25 NBA season. USA Basketball has yet to formally announce a replacement for Leonard on the roster, though Charania relays that Boston guard Derrick White could be a leading candidate.\n\nChristie agreed Friday with the Clippers on a four-year, $7.9 million contract, Michael Scotto of USA Today reports. The fourth year of the deal is a club option worth an estimated $2.49 million. The No. 46 overall pick in last month's 2024 NBA Draft, Christie won't turn 19 years old until later this month and is viewed as more of a long-term project from the Clippers rather than someone who's expected to be a major contributor as a rookie. During his lone collegiate season at Minnesota, the 6-foot-5 wing averaged 11.3 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 30.0 minutes over 33 appearances while shooting 39.1 percent from three-point range.\n\nBamba agreed to a one-year deal with the Clippers on Monday, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports. Bamba will join the Clippers and provide extra depth behind Ivica Zubac. The 26-year-old played for the 76ers last season, during which he averaged 4.4 points, 4.2 rebounds and 1.1 blocks across a career-low 13.0 minutes in 57 regular-season games. However, Bamba did shoot a career-high 39.1 percent from deep in a limited number of attempts at 1.1 per game.\n\nDunn (foot) has agreed to a contract with the Clippers, Chris Haynes of Turner Sports reports. The terms of the deal have yet to be disclosed, and the club is reportedly looking into the possibility of a sign-and-trade, per Jake Fischer of Yahoo Sports. This move also indicates that the Clippers are looking to trade Russell Westbrook at some point before the 2024-25 campaign. Dunn averaged 5.4 points, 2.9 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.0 steals in 66 appearances a season ago with the Jazz and will serve as guard depth behind James Harden.\n\nBatum and the Clippers agreed to a two-year, $9.6 million deal Monday, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reports. Batum had a strong market in free agency including some reported interest from the Spurs, but the veteran opted to return to a familiar franchise. Batum spent four seasons with the Clippers before joining the 76ers in 2023-24, and he will provide the team with some quality depth at both forward positions despite his advanced age."
