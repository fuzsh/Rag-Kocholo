        "text": "Knicks' center Tyson Chandler was named to the NBA's All-Defensive First Team, along with the Miami Heat's LeBron James, the Memphis Grizzlies' Tony Allen, the Los Angeles Clippers' Chris Paul, the Oklahoma City Thunder's Serge Ibaka, and the Chicago Buls' Joakim Noah.\n\nChandler, who won the 2011-12 Defensive Player of the Year award but finished on the NBA's 2nd Team All-Defensive team last season, saw his fortunes flipped this year by losing out on this season's NBA Defensive Player of the Year award, but still being named to this year's 1st Team.\n\nMarc Gasol of the Memphis Grizzlies duplicated Chandler's feat this season by being named the 2012-13 Defensive Player of the Year, yet finishing on the NBA's 2nd Team All-Defensive list.\n\nChandler and Noah each received 24 points and shared the first-team center spot.\n\nThe media votes for Defensive Player of the Year, while the coaches decide the All-Defensive teams.\n\nThe All-Defensive Second-Team was led by the San Antonio Spurs' Tim Duncan, the Indiana Pacers' Paul George, the Boston Celtics' Avery Bradley, and Gasol and his teammate Mike Conley."
