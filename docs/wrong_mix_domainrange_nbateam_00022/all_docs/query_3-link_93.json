        "text": "The 2024 NHL offseason is in full swing as there's been drastic changes this summer around the league. This includes the Seattle Kraken who spent a boat load of money to bring in free agents Brandon Montour and Chandler Stephenson.\n\nWhile their free-agent spending may continue with just over $6 million in cap space remaining, there's a chance a trade or two transpires between now and the start of training camp. If GM Ron Francis is going to entertain some trade scenarios, here's three players who could be invovled:\n\nYanni Gourde\n\nSo far there hasn't been much noise around Gourde re-signing in Seattle as he's been eligible for an extension since July 1. Gourde is coming off an 11-goal and 33-point season and has one season remaining on his contract at $5.1 million against the cap. The veteran forward owns a 23-team trade list and has some say in the matter if a trade gets finalized. One team to keep an eye on would be Gourde's old team, the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nBrandon Tanev\n\nTanev is in the same boat as Gourde as he's entering the final season of his contract. The depth forward will make $3.5 million against the cap in 2024-25 and owns a 10-team no-trade list. If Seattle gets off to a tough start next season, expect to see Francis open to moving out some of his pending free agents to get ahead of the rental market. Tanev recorded 16 points in 66 games last season and could bring his penalty killing and physical play to a contending team.\n\nAdam Larsson\n\nLarsson had trade calls made on him throughout most of last season as a big, tough, physical right-handed defenseman is hard to find these days. Larsson is also a pending free agent after next season and will make $4 million against the cap. Seattle wouldn't likely have to retain any money in a trade and if they end up eating some salary, the price tag is going to increase dramatically. Larsson is a great penalty killer, he blocks a lot of shots and isn't afraid to muck it up in the dirty areas of the ice. There's plenty of teams who could use a RHD who can eat 22 minutes a night. The Swedish blueline will have some say in the matter as he owns a 10-team no-trade clause."
