        "text": "The Los Angeles Clippers, more commonly referred to as the “LA Clippers”, are a professional basketball team that compete in the National Basketball Association’s Western Conference Pacific Division. The franchise was established in New York in 1970 as the Buffalo Braves. The team moved to San Diego in 1978 where it was renamed the San Diego Clippers, before relocating to Los Angeles in 1984.\n\nThe Clippers currently play their home games at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. During the 2021/22 NBA season, the average regular season home attendance for a Clippers game stood at 16,926 per game and total attendance for that same season amounted to 694,005. The franchise generated around 362 million U.S. dollars in revenue in the 2021/22 season and saw an decrease in operating income to 12 million U.S. dollars compared to 57 million U.S. dollars two years prior. As of 2022, the franchise value for the LA Clippers stood at an estimated 3.9 billion U.S. dollars. In 2014, the team’s former owner, Donald Sterling, was embroiled in controversy over publicly exposed racist comments he made. This led to a life ban from the NBA for Sterling, who then sold the team to its current owner, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, at a purchase price of two billion U.S. dollars.\n\nUnlike the historically successful Los Angeles Lakers, the LA Clippers have never reached the NBA Finals in their history. The franchise made the playoffs during the 2020-2021 season, but were beaten in the Conference Finals by the Phoenix Suns. The Clippers have a combined total of around 5.6 million fans and followers on Facebook and Twitter."
