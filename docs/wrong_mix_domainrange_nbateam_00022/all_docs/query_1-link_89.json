        "text": "Chandler wasn't able to turn around Chicago, and historically speaking, he is considered a disappointment as a Bull. Chandler likely wasn't ready for that yet blossom into a great player, winning the Defensive Player of the Year in 2012 with the New York, but this shouldn't discount his development in Chicago.\n\nChandler's rebounding numbers were substantial for his age, putting forth two nine-plus rebounding years in the last two of his five seasons as a Bull. Playing 340 Games for Chicago, Chandler averaged 7.1 Points, 7.7 Rebounds, and 1.4 Blocks per Game, which were decent for a player who was slightly below the 25 MPG plateau."
