        "text": "How valuable is Tyson Chandler?\n\nThe Mavericks found out Monday night.\n\nChandler left Monday night’s game in the first minute with a left ankle injury, and the Mavericks quickly evolved into an overmatched sparring partner for the Blake Griffin-less Los Angeles Clippers, falling 115-98.\n\nThe Mavericks are not a team that relies on defense or rebounding. They rank 23rd in the NBA in scoring defense and 20th in rebounding. But Chandler is the one player who does play defense and does rebound for the Mavericks.\n\nWithout his 7-1 presence to protect the basket, the Mavericks were lost in the defensive end against the Clippers. Los Angeles put up 64 points in the first half alone and reached 100 with nine minutes remaining in the game.\n\nMinus Chandler, Los Angeles center DeAndre Jordan had his way in the paint with an NBA season-high 27 rebounds, including 11 in the offensive end. He also threw down 22 points.\n\n“He looked like Wilt Chamberlain out there,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said.\n\nIn addition to Chandler, the Mavericks also lost Monta Ellis, their leading scorer at 20.4 points per game, with a hip injury. He left the game less than two minutes after Chandler was helped from the court.\n\nSo Carlisle was a man of few words afterward. This was not a game he’d want to store in a time capsule. And he was mum on the injuries.\n\n“Injuries are part of the game,” Mavericks guard Devin Harris said. “We hated to lose those two guys, but we’re definitely a capable team. We have guys who can step up. It’s hard … but life’s hard.”\n\nThe Mavericks are a team that’s all about offense, all about scoring. Don Nelson used to say the first team to 100 wins — and he is so right about this Mavericks team.\n\nThe Mavericks have won the race to 100 30 times this season. They are 28-2 in those games. Monday night marked only the 11th time an opponent has beaten the Mavericks to 100 points, and Dallas is 2-9 in those games.\n\nThe loss of Chandler also hurt the Mavericks in the offensive end. He ranks second in the NBA in shooting percentage at .684 and averages almost 11 points per game. Dallas wound up shooting just 40 percent against the Clippers.\n\nThis is not a Western Conference power without its leading scorer and leading rebounder — and now the All-Star break can’t get here fast enough for the Mavericks.\n\nThe Mavericks are a team that wants to match you point for point. They want to turn each game a shooting match.\n\nDirk Nowitzki, Chandler Parsons and Ellis are all capable of 30-point nights. And Charlie Villanueva came off the bench Monday night and hit three three-pointers en route to 13 first-quarter points. He finished with 26.\n\n“We have playmakers,” Carlisle said. “I believe we have a team of playmakers.”\n\nAnd that’s why the offense clicks. The Mavericks are collectively hitting 46.8 percent of their shots, fifth best in the league. They have so many quality shooters, the Mavericks can always find a hot hand. One slumping player isn’t going to take this team down.\n\nBut losing Chandler and then Ellis were blows the Mavericks could not overcome.\n\nThe Mavericks knew Chandler would need some help on defense if this team is to make a deep playoff run. The post-season is all about defense, not offense.\n\nSo the Mavericks engineered a blockbuster trade with the Celtics for point guard Rajon Rondo, figuring he could provide at the front end what Chandler provides in the back end.\n\nBut Rondo has missed the last five games now with facial fractures and isn’t expected back until after the All-Star break. Without Rondo to guard him, point guard extraordinaire Chris Paul had 25 points, 13 assists and six rebounds for the Clippers.\n\nThe Mavericks now have problems that only a healthy Chandler, Rondo and Ellis can solve.\n\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on The Ticket (KTCK-AM 1310) with Norm Hitzges."
