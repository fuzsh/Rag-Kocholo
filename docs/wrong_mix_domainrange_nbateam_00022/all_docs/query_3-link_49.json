        "text": "While the Mavericks spend the weekend in Boston, Chandler has still offered counsel to his pupil from afar. “All he’s telling me to do is the little things, no matter if that’s hitting them on the box-out or being able to talk to my teammates on the backside,” Lively said. “Just doing the little things so that everybody is connected on the court, so we’re not leaving anybody behind.”\n\nChandler, working as a volunteer, also attended most of those sessions and has been a regular at the Mavs’ home practices throughout the season because he so thoroughly enjoys aiding in Lively’s development. Chandler, whose 19-year career was highlighted by the Mavs’ championship and a Defensive Player of the Year honor won with the New York Knicks two seasons later, has watched as Lively learned and implemented the dirty-work details of the game that Chandler said took years for him to fully grasp. “I didn’t know he’d be this sound as a rookie. I think that’s more impressive than anything,” Chandler told ESPN after Lively averaged 11.5 points and 11.3 rebounds in four consecutive wins bridging the West semifinals and finals. “He steps into the moment and is not afraid of the moment or second-guessing himself.” Kidd, for his part, sees the easy parallels between the two big men.\n\nIsaiah Hartenstein on being a second-round pick: 'I got red-flagged on draft night for something (an injury) I didn't have'\n\nMichael Scotto: When you came into the league as a second-round pick, did you have a chip on your shoulder? Isaiah Hartenstein: Yeah. It was a frustrating time, especially going into the draft. I was projected a lot higher, and then, on draft night, I got red-flagged for something (an injury) I didn’t have. That was frustrating. I think everything happened for a reason. I think I was put in a situation that maybe at the time I didn’t really get it, but I was blessed to learn from Hall of Famers Chris Paul, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and from a big’s standpoint, I had Nenê to help me a lot and Tyson Chandler who was helping me a lot. At the time, I feel like you don’t really get what’s happening, but I think being consistent and changing my mental approach helped a lot."
