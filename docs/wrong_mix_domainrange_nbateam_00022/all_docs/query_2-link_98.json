        "text": "Clippers co-owner Shelly Sterling decided to sell the team last week rather than fight to maintain half ownership in part because of a novel arrangement that will make her “owner emeritus” and fund a major foundation to serve the poor, minorities and battered spouses, according to people familiar with the $2-billion sale of the team.\n\nThe special provision in a sales agreement signed last week with former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer will allow Sterling, 79, to maintain a significant presence with the franchise, even though she is giving up her 50% stake. The other half of the Clippers is owned by Donald T. Sterling through a family trust. Shelly Sterling sold the entire team to Ballmer after taking control of the trust, citing her husband’s alleged mental failings.\n\nDonald Sterling still hasn't signed off on the official sale of the Clippers because he hopes the NBA will rescind a $2.5-million fine and lifetime ban from all league activities, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nSterling recently saw a draft of a statement from the league which he thought absolved him of the penalties, but a person familiar with the NBA's position said the statement, which was not released to the public, offered no such relief.\n\n\"In terms of saying something in a draft press release that indicated they would be dismissing the lifetime ban and the fine, that is not true at all,\" said the person, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. \"That doesn't mean that [Sterling] wouldn't have read something like that into it.\n\n\"But if they interpreted it that way that is wrong and there is no thought of lifting the lifetime ban or the fine being rescinded.\"\n\nAs the NBA prepares to finalize the record-breaking $2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Clippers, banned owner Donald Sterling insists he's ready to \"move on.\"\n\n\"I feel fabulous, I feel very good,\" Sterling told NBC4 on Tuesday night when asked how he felt about his wife, Shelly, selling the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. \"Everything is just the way it should be, really. It may have worked out differently, but it's good. It's all good.\n\n\"I'm OK, I'm OK. Is the NBA OK? I'm not sure about that. Is [NBA commissioner] Adam Silver OK? I'm sure he's OK.\"\n\nShelly Sterling asserted that she is acting as the sole trustee, with no mention of Donald Sterling, who bought the team three decades ago.\n\nDonald Sterling’s lawyers have asserted that he needs a final sign-off before the team can be sold. However, according to two media reports, Shelly Sterling has said her husband was not capable of making the decision to sell the team. The Times has not verified that report.\n\n\"I am delighted that we are selling the team to Steve, who will be a terrific owner,\" Shelly Sterling said in a statement. \"We have worked for 33 years to build the Clippers into a premiere NBA franchise. I am confident that Steve will take the team to new levels of success.\"\n\nI will be honored to have my name submitted to the NBA Board of Governors for approval as the next owner of the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nI love basketball. And I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that the Clippers continue to win -- and win big -- in Los Angeles. L.A. is one of the world’s great cities -- a city that embraces inclusiveness, in exactly the same way that the NBA and I embrace inclusiveness. I am confident that the Clippers will in the coming years become an even bigger part of the community."
