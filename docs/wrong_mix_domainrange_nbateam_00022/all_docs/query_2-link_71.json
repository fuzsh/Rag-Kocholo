        "text": "The NBA is investigating a report of an audio recording in which a man purported to be the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, Donald Sterling, makes racist remarks while speaking to his girlfriend.\n\nThe NBA spokesman, Mike Bass, said in a statement on Saturday that the league is in the process of authenticating the validity of the recording, which was posted on TMZ's website. Bass called the comments \"disturbing and offensive\" and said the league would have no further comment at this time.\n\nMessages seeking comment from the Clippers were not immediately returned.\n\nThe Clippers were practising in San Francisco ahead of game four of their first-round play-off series against the Golden State Warriors on Sunday. Los Angeles leads 2-1. The Clippers coach, Doc Rivers, and players were scheduled to speak to reporters.\n\nIn the recording posted on TMZ, the man questions his girlfriend's association with minorities. TMZ reported the woman, V Stiviano, who is of black and Mexican descent, posted a picture of herself with Lakers Hall of Famer Magic Johnson on Instagram – which has since been removed.\n\nThe man asked that Stiviano not broadcast her association with black people or bring black people to games.\n\n\"I will never go to a Clippers game again as long as Donald Sterling is the owner,\" Magic Johnson said on Twitter. He also said the alleged comments were \"a black eye for the NBA\" and said he felt bad that friends such as Rivers and Clippers point guard Chris Paul had to work for Sterling.\n\nThe former Clippers guard Baron Davis wrote on Twitter that Sterling's discrimination has been \"going on for a long time\".\n\nSterling, a real estate mogul, bought the Clippers in 1981. He is the longest-tenured owner in the NBA since the Lakers owner Jerry Buss died last year.\n\nHe has been frequently criticised for his frugal operation of the Clippers, although in recent years he has spent heavily to add stars such as Paul and Rivers, who led the team back to the play-offs in his first year as coach.\n\nSterling has been involved in several lawsuits over the years, including ones with discrimination accusations.\n\nIn November 2009, Sterling agreed to pay $2.73m (£1.62m) to settle allegations by the government that he refused to rent apartments to hispanics and black people and to families with children. The Justice Department sued Sterling in August 2006, for allegations of housing discrimination in the Koreatown area of Los Angeles.\n\nIn March 2011, Sterling won a lawsuit against the former Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor when a jury rejected the Hall of Famer's claim of age discrimination and harassment. Baylor, who was 76 at the time, had sought about $2m after claiming he was forced out of the job he had held for 22 years. The team said Baylor left on his own and a jury awarded him nothing.\n\nSterling is a courtside fixture at Clippers home games. He rarely visits the team's locker room at Staples Centre, although he made an appearance in December 2012 after they had won their 11th straight game, when he led an awkward locker room cheer."
