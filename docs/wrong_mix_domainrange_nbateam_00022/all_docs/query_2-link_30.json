        "text": "Jasen Powell\n\nDirector of Medical Services / Head Athletic Trainer\n\nEducation: California State Poly University–Pomona (B.S.)\n\nHometown: Oakland, CA\n\nNBATA Member Since: 1999\n\nJasen Powell became Head Athletic Trainer of the Los Angeles Clippers in 1999 after serving as assistant athletic trainer with the National Football League’s San Francisco 49ers for four seasons. Powell is the only NBATA member to have combined an educational pursuit of athletic training with college basketball-playing experience. His athletic training career began as an undergraduate student at San Diego State University where he was a member of the Aztecs basketball team. He transferred to California State Poly University-Pomona in 1995, earning an undergraduate degree in kinesiology and health promotion, while completing his collegiate basketball-playing career with the Broncos. In addition to spending the 1994-95 season as an Assistant Athletic Trainer for the Clippers, Powell was a summer assistant athletic trainer with the National Football League’s Atlanta Falcons.\n\nJasen is an advocate for cutting edge and innovative changes that evolve around sports medicine helping many organizations with ideas on how to implement new methodology. In 1997, he leveraged his own funds to establish the Jasen Powell Health Promotion Scholarship in the Oakland Unified School District, which supports college-bound students in pursuit of a career in athletic healthcare.\n\nPowell is a member of the National Athletic Trainers’ Association and the National Strength and Conditioning Association.\n\nThe Oakland, California native attended Bishop O’Dowd High School, where he was an All-California selection in basketball and played against current NBA stars Jason Kidd and Lamond Murray. His hobbies include reading and watching movies.\n\nJasen and his wife, Mia, reside in Pasadena with their children, Aaron and Ariel.\n\nThomas Murdock\n\nAssistant Athletic Trainer\n\nEducation: Chapman University (B.S.)\n\nHometown: Mariposa, CA\n\nNBATA Member Since: 2016\n\nTommy joined the Clippers as Assistant Athletic Trainer in the 2016 season. He served as the Clippers athletic training intern in the 2013-2016 seasons, and the pre-season athletic training intern for the San Francisco 49ers in 2012. He developed an interest in athletic training after leaving high school. He visited Chapman University knowing he was pursuing a career in sports medicine. Tommy never had the pleasure or luxury of having an athletic trainer throughout his high school sporting career being from a small rural town that idolized athletics. He learned that a lot of schools in California lack this essential medical persona as well. He also learned that California was and still is one of the only states without any type of licensure or state specific regulations. This drove him to pursue the legislative portion of advocating for athletic training regulation in California.\n\nTommy attended “Hit the Hill” campaigns for multiple years as well as becoming involved in leadership positions at Chapman University and the District “FWATA” level as the 2012-1013 Student Committee President. This drove him to become the athletic trainer he is today and is always pursuing serving others and helping athletes be the best in all facets of their athletic careers, including mentally, physically, and emotionally. Tommy has learned so much from so many great mentors; athletic trainers and other medical professionals alike in his short career of athletic training. Tommy is looking forward to giving back to those that have gotten him to this point already."
