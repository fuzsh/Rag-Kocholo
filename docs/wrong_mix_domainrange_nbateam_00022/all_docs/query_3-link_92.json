        "text": "Chandler Hallow Gallery\n\nChandler Lewis Hallow (born December 3, 1998 (1998-12-03) [age 25]) is a YouTube star who is a frequent collaborator on the channel MrBeast and a major affiliate of the channel, appearing in many of Jimmy's videos from 2018 and onward.\n\nBiography[]\n\nHe was born on December 3, 1998, in Greenville, North Carolina.\n\nHe studied and graduated from JS Rose High School and later graduated from Chowan University in Murfreesboro. In 2018, he began playing baseball for the Chowan University Hawks.\n\nAccording to Jimmy in a video with Kwebbelkop, Chandler was originally his janitor.[2] After his debut in We Are Better Than Dude Perfect, he continued to appear in Jimmy's videos since 2018 due to people really liking him.\n\nIn mid-2021, he had been appearing less frequently for unknown reasons, but has later come back on a regular basis.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nChandler is the most childish person in the group. He's always hungry and is afraid of unusual things, such as pickles. He's very expressive and lacks the ability to do certain things, like cooking (for example, when he microwaved cheese onto goldfish for dinner for Mark Pate, his contestant, in Last To Take Hand Off $1,000,000 Keeps It). A running gag is jokes about his \"sanity\", and a previous running gag was his inability to win challenges, which changed in the video Last To Leave Revolving Door Wins $50,000, when Chandler won his 1st major challenge on the MrBeast channel. On his social media accounts, like his father, he openly shows his faith towards Christianity and he and his wife got baptized in April 2023.\n\nFamily[]\n\nTodd Hallow (father)\n\nTricia Hallow (mother)\n\nCassidy Hallow (older sister)\n\nZach Hallow (older brother)\n\nHannah Hallow (younger sister)\n\nMike Hallow (brother)\n\nJordan Hallow (brother)\n\nChallenges he participated in[]\n\nLast To Leave Circle Wins $10,000\n\nLast To Remove Hand, Gets Lamborghini\n\nLast To Leave Slime Pit Wins\n\nLast To Remove Hand, Wins House\n\nEgg Olympics\n\nI Went Back To 1st Grade For A Day\n\nI Spent 24 Hours Straight In Insane Asylum\n\nAmazing Beast Race\n\nLast To Leave The Tesla, Keeps It\n\nWorld's Largest Bowl Of Cereal\n\nLast To Stop Running Wins\n\nLast To Leave VR Wins\n\nLast To Leave Revolving Door Wins\n\nLast To Leave Roller Coaster Wins\n\nLast To Leave Pool of $20,000 Keeps It\n\nLast To Leave Ramen Noodle Pool Wins\n\nLast To Take Hand Off Boat, Keeps It\n\nLast To Fall Wins $1,000,000\n\nExtreme Hide And Seek #1\n\nLast To Stop Swinging Wins $1,000,000\n\nLast To Leave Toilet Wins $1,000,000\n\nLast To Stop Biking Wins $1,000,000\n\nLast To Take Hand Off $1,000,000\n\nExtreme Hide And Seek #2\n\nI Went Back To Boy Scouts For A Day\n\nLamborghini Race\n\nExtreme Hide And Seek #3\n\nI Built The World's Largest Lego Tower\n\nI Ate The World's Largest Slice Of Pizza\n\nLast To Leave $800,000 Island Keeps It\n\nPush This Red Button For $100,000\n\nSteal This $100,000 Diamond, You Keep It\n\nI Put 1,000,000 Christmas Lights On A House (World Record)\n\nExtreme $100,000 Game of Tag!\n\nVictories[]\n\nIn I Bought Everything in the Store, he opened a cola bottle and won $100.\n\nIn Last To Leave Revolving Door Wins $50,000, at 10:28, Zach leaves the Revolving door, leaving Chandler to finally win his first challenge.\n\nIn Last To Leave Roller Coaster Wins $20,000 - Challenge, at 14:11, Chandler wins the fourth match, winning for the white team, and his second challenge win.\n\nIn Last To Leave Pool Of $20,000 Keeps It, at 16:05, Thomas decided to leave, so he is the runner-up of this challenge, and this made Mary Lisa and Chandler the winners of this challenge, where Mary Lisa has won $20,000 and Chandler has won $10,000. Mary Lisa is also the first female to win a challenge on MrBeast's channel, and not only that, but this is the first time Chandler has ever won three challenges in a row.\n\nIn Surviving 24 Hours In The Bermuda Triangle, he won in all three mini-challenges each $2000 made by MrBeast.\n\nThe first challenge was that the last person to fall off the water carpet in the sea would win $2000. Jake fell first, followed by Marcus and Chris, thus Chandler won.\n\nThe second challenge was that the person who dived into the sea from the yacht with the fullest streak would win $2000. Marcus was eliminated, followed by Chris and Jake, hence Chandler won again, having done a front flip.\n\nThe last challenge was a hide-and-seek challenge, and the last to be found would win $2000. Chris was found first, followed by Marcus and Jake, hence Chandler won yet again.\n\nIn Last To Stop Riding Bike Wins $1,000,000 (Part 4), he coached Cody and Mark. Jeremy decided to leave to take $10,000, so Mark wins the challenge and gets the chance to get $1,000,000, so that also makes Chandler a winner of this challenge.\n\nIn Last To Take Hand Off $1,000,000 Keeps It, he coached Mark. Eventually, Mark become the winner of this challenge, gaining $1,000,000, and 10% of that money goes to Chandler because he was his coach, which also makes Chandler a winner for this challenge.\n\nIn Last to Leave $800,000 Island Keeps It, after accomplishing many challenges, the last challenge is rather a vote on who should win: Chandler or Karl Jacobs. They each had 4 votes, and Jedd took a vote to decide who would win the island and it was Chandler whose name was on the paper.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"It only exists in my head.\"\n\n\"My ostrich is a free man.\"\n\n\"Can I throw my poop?\"\n\n\"I'm a free man! Time to eat some weenies!\"\n\n\"I'm love yoghurt.\"\n\n\"McDonald's!\"\n\n\"WHERE'S THE MILK?!\"\n\n\"It just finds it's way into my hand.\"\n\n\"I'm already itching my butt sack off\"\n\n\"Can I go poop?\"\n\n\"I feel like a dead body\"\n\n\"I like doors\"\n\n\"I love food\"\n\n\"Invest in beast so we can give stuff to homeless people more\"\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe is 6 ft 5 in (195 cm).[3]\n\nIn one of the videos in Videos I Could Not Upload, he made two world records.\n\nIn Surviving in a Desert for 24 Hours, he went crazy and ate most of the food.\n\nChandler is the only one to have consecutive wins with 3 wins in a row. One is an individual challenge, one is a team challenge, and one is a coaching challenge (coaching Mary Lisa to win).\n\nHe is very good at basketball, as shown in his debut.\n\nEven though many people said for Chandler to be the one who loses the most, he did win several challenges (Karl Jacobs has never won a single challenge on the main channel before Push This Red Button For $100,000.)\n\nHowever, Chandler has done more challenges than Karl.\n\nIn some videos that are not even a Last to Leave challenge, Chandler ends up leaving. In I Opened a Free Car Dealership, he left due to feeling sick. In Surviving 24 Hours Straight In A Rain Forest, he left due to getting bit by something venomous (offscreen). In I Ran A Marathon In The World's Largest Shoes, he left due to the 5 lb shoes. In I Built The World's Largest Lego Tower, he left his team due to running out of energy.\n\nHe tends to get hostile when he's hungry.\n\nHe formerly dated Lauren Farquhar who is the sister of Katie Farquhar, Chris' wife.\n\nHis favorite colors are black and red.\n\nHis favorite TV series are Game of Thrones and Friends.[4]\n\nOn July 11, 2021, Chandler has publicly stated in his Instagram that he is engaged with Cara Davis.[5]\n\nHe is the youngest out of the Beast Gang.\n\nChandler states that he cannot pee when others are looking.\n\nChandler has won over more than $3,000,000 pounds In challenges.\n\nChandler suffers from a rare type of colour blindness called Achromatopsia. This makes it so that he sees only see black, white and types of grey. This is also the reason why he failed so many challenges.\n\nOn June 25, 2023 Chandler made his youtube channel his channel is about golf.\n\nOn the news it was confirmed that he was dead the reason was that he was killed while filming a stunt but the statement wasn't true but this went viral on media.\n\nIn a relative universe he is married to Fernanda Manchester since January 23, 2020 (Fernanda es creada por @Dayanvps, la cual la creo para ir a su realidad deseada)\n\nReferences[]"
