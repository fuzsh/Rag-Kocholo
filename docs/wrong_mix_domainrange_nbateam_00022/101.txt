Amidst the glitz and glamor of a league full of fame, Los Angeles houses some of the most show-stopping names. After all, it is the City of Angels. Apart from some of the most eye-catching players in the league, it is also host to one of the richest sports team owners in the world. Even though the franchise is constantly compared with its cross-town rival, the LA Clippers boasts a rich history and a narrative that is uniquely its own.

The Clippers first came into existence in 1970, as an NBA expansion team in New York known as the Buffalo Braves. Soon, they were relocated to San Diego. However, their reidentification lasted only for 6 years. Along with their struggles, the franchise stirred off-court controversies by pushing an unauthorized move to Los Angeles. However, the Clippers had a different owner, along with pressure to make a mark in the league.

Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft, owns the Los Angeles Clippers. Ballmer has earned the title of the world’s richest sports team owner eight times since he acquired the team. However, in the current landscape of 2023, Mukesh Ambani of India has dethroned him; with his Mumbai Indians from the Indian Premier League.

At the age of 67, Ballmer boasts a staggering net worth of $111.5 billion; standing amongst top-10 in the list of richest people in the world. Furthermore, as of 2023, the LA Clippers have an estimated valuation of $4.5 to $5 billion. The tech world luminary was once assistant to Bill Gates and acted as CEO of Microsoft from 2000 to 2014. Despite initially intending a prolonged tenure at Microsoft, Ballmer decided to call it quits and venture into other arenas.

With his vibrant personality, Ballmer has won fans’ hearts and earned the respect of players in LA. In less than a decade, the billionaire has reshaped the basketball landscape of the franchise; courtesy of his optimistic approaches.

Beyond the confines of the court, Ballmer has left an indelible mark on the city. Apart from refurbishing over 300 basketball courts, the visionary owner has his sights set on a grander project–giving the franchise its very own home court arena. With the franchise pursuing its first-ever NBA championship, Ballmer is ready to inaugurate the official Clippers arena in Inglewood ahead of the 2024-25 season.

However, things weren’t always looking pretty for the Clippers. Before Ballmer took the reins, another owner was associated with the franchise. While the notable billionaire saw the franchise cruise through decades, he is probably one of the most despised names in the league.

Clippers’ ex-owner banned from the NBA

Before Steve Ballmer took the reins, Donald Sterling held the LA Clippers’ ownership for over three decades. Snatching up the franchise in 1981 during its San Diego chapter, he wasted no time in stirring up controversies with his bold moves. Without the NBA’s approval, the billionaire uprooted the team and relocated it to Los Angeles in the coming years.

However, Sterling’s knack for eyebrow-raising decisions didn’t end there. The NBA and the owner repeatedly found themselves at a negotiating table, navigating the storm of his controversial choices. However, the breaking point came on April 29, 2014, when the NBA delivered a bombshell–slapping Sterling with a lifetime ban. The decision came after a leaked audio tape exposed Sterling’s voice echoing racist ideologies.

As a result, fans and the league erupted in outrage. Players even took to the court in protest. Given the seriousness of the situation, the newly appointed NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, stepped up to the plate. In a decisive move, he announced the ban, barring Sterling not only from the league but also from any business dealings associated with it. The era of Sterling’s influence in team decisions came to a screeching halt, marking another significant chapter in the Clippers’ history.
