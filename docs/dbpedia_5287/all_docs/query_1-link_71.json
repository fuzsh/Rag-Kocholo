        "text": "The history of artificial intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.\n\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College in the U.S. during the summer of 1956.[1] Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation, and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true.\n\nEventually, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. In 1974, in response to the criticism from James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress, the U.S. and British Governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial intelligence. Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government inspired governments and industry to provide AI with billions of dollars, but by the late 1980s the investors became disillusioned and withdrew funding again. The difficult years that followed would later be known as an \"AI winter\". AI was criticized in the press and avoided by industry until the mid-2000s, but research and funding continued to grow under other names.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s machine learning was applied to many problems in academia and industry. The success was due to the availability powerful computer hardware, the collection of immense data sets and the application of solid mathematical methods. In 2012, deep learning proved to be a breakthrough technology, eclipsing all other methods. The transformer architecture debuted in 2017 and was used to produce impressive generative AI applications. Investment in AI boomed in the 2020s.\n\nPrecursors\n\n[edit]\n\nMythical, fictional, and speculative precursors\n\n[edit]\n\nMyth and legend\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Greek mythology, Talos was a giant constructed of bronze who acted as guardian for the island of Crete. He would throw boulders at the ships of invaders and would complete 3 circuits around the island's perimeter daily.[4] According to pseudo-Apollodorus' Bibliotheke, Hephaestus forged Talos with the aid of a cyclops and presented the automaton as a gift to Minos.[5] In the Argonautica, Jason and the Argonauts defeated him by way of a single plug near his foot which, once removed, allowed the vital ichor to flow out from his body and left him inanimate.[6]\n\nPygmalion was a legendary king and sculptor of Greek mythology, famously represented in Ovid's Metamorphoses. In the 10th book of Ovid's narrative poem, Pygmalion becomes disgusted with women when he witnesses the way in which the Propoetides prostitute themselves.[7] Despite this, he makes offerings at the temple of Venus asking the goddess to bring to him a woman just like a statue he carved.\n\nMedieval legends of artificial beings\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Of the Nature of Things, written by the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus, he describes a procedure that he claims can fabricate an \"artificial man\". By placing the \"sperm of a man\" in horse dung, and feeding it the \"Arcanum of Mans blood\" after 40 days, the concoction will become a living infant.[8]\n\nThe earliest written account regarding golem-making is found in the writings of Eleazar ben Judah of Worms in the early 13th century.[9] During the Middle Ages, it was believed that the animation of a Golem could be achieved by insertion of a piece of paper with any of God’s names on it, into the mouth of the clay figure.[11] Unlike legendary automata like Brazen Heads, a Golem was unable to speak.[13]\n\nTakwin, the artificial creation of life, was a frequent topic of Ismaili alchemical manuscripts, especially those attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan. Islamic alchemists attempted to create a broad range of life through their work, ranging from plants to animals.[14]\n\nIn Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, an alchemically fabricated homunculus, destined to live forever in the flask in which he was made, endeavors to be born into a full human body. Upon the initiation of this transformation, however, the flask shatters and the homunculus dies.[15]\n\nModern fiction\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in fiction\n\nBy the 19th century, ideas about artificial men and thinking machines were developed in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), and speculation, such as Samuel Butler's \"Darwin among the Machines\", and in real-world instances, including Edgar Allan Poe's \"Maelzel's Chess Player\". AI is a common topic in science fiction through the present.[19]\n\nAutomata\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Automaton\n\nRealistic humanoid automata were built by craftsman from many civilizations, including Yan Shi, Hero of Alexandria, Al-Jazari, Haroun al-Rashid, Jacques de Vaucanson, Leonardo Torres y Quevedo, Pierre Jaquet-Droz and Wolfgang von Kempelen.\n\nThe oldest known automata were the sacred statues of ancient Egypt and Greece. The faithful believed that craftsman had imbued these figures with very real minds, capable of wisdom and emotion—Hermes Trismegistus wrote that \"by discovering the true nature of the gods, man has been able to reproduce it\".[31] English scholar Alexander Neckham asserted that the Ancient Roman poet Virgil had built a palace with automaton statues.[32]\n\nDuring the early modern period, these legendary automata were said to possess the magical ability to answer questions put to them. The late medieval alchemist and proto-protestant Roger Bacon was purported to have fabricated a brazen head, having developed a legend of having been a wizard.[33][34] These legends were similar to the Norse myth of the Head of Mímir. According to legend, Mímir was known for his intellect and wisdom, and was beheaded in the Æsir-Vanir War. Odin is said to have \"embalmed\" the head with herbs and spoke incantations over it such that Mímir’s head remained able to speak wisdom to Odin. Odin then kept the head near him for counsel.[35]\n\nFormal reasoning\n\n[edit]\n\nArtificial intelligence is based on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized. The study of mechanical—or \"formal\"—reasoning has a long history. Chinese, Indian and Greek philosophers all developed structured methods of formal deduction by the first millennium BCE. Their ideas were developed over the centuries by philosophers such as Aristotle (who gave a formal analysis of the syllogism), Euclid (whose Elements was a model of formal reasoning), al-Khwārizmī (who developed algebra and gave his name to \"algorithm\") and European scholastic philosophers such as William of Ockham and Duns Scotus.\n\nSpanish philosopher Ramon Llull (1232–1315) developed several logical machines devoted to the production of knowledge by logical means;[37] Llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic and undeniable truths by simple logical operations, produced by the machine by mechanical meanings, in such ways as to produce all the possible knowledge.[38] Llull's work had a great influence on Gottfried Leibniz, who redeveloped his ideas.[39]\n\nIn the 17th century, Leibniz, Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes explored the possibility that all rational thought could be made as systematic as algebra or geometry.[40] Hobbes famously wrote in Leviathan: \"reason is nothing but reckoning\".[41] Leibniz envisioned a universal language of reasoning, the characteristica universalis, which would reduce argumentation to calculation so that \"there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants. For it would suffice to take their pencils in hand, down to their slates, and to say each other (with a friend as witness, if they liked): Let us calculate.\"[42] These philosophers had begun to articulate the physical symbol system hypothesis that would become the guiding faith of AI research.\n\nThe study of mathematical logic provided the essential breakthrough that made artificial intelligence seem plausible. The foundations had been set by such works as Boole's The Laws of Thought and Frege's Begriffsschrift. Building on Frege's system, Russell and Whitehead presented a formal treatment of the foundations of mathematics in their masterpiece, the Principia Mathematica in 1913. Inspired by Russell's success, David Hilbert challenged mathematicians of the 1920s and 30s to answer this fundamental question: \"can all of mathematical reasoning be formalized?\" His question was answered by Gödel's incompleteness proof, Turing's machine and Church's Lambda calculus.[a]\n\nTheir answer was surprising in two ways. First, they proved that there were, in fact, limits to what mathematical logic could accomplish. But second (and more important for AI) their work suggested that, within these limits, any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized. The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction. The key insight was the Turing machine—a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation.[45] This invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines.\n\nComputer science\n\n[edit]\n\nCalculating machines were designed or built in antiquity and throughout history by many people, including Gottfried Leibniz, Joseph Marie Jacquard, Charles Babbage,[48] Percy Ludgate,[49] Leonardo Torres Quevedo,[50] Vannevar Bush, and others. Ada Lovelace speculated that Babbage's machine was \"a thinking or ... reasoning machine\", but warned \"It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that arise as to the powers\" of the machine.[52]\n\nThe first modern computers were the massive machines of the Second World War (such as Konrad Zuse's Z3, Alan Turing's Heath Robinson and Colossus, Atanasoff and Berry's and ABC and ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania). ENIAC was based on the theoretical foundation laid by Alan Turing and developed by John von Neumann, and proved to be the most influential.\n\nBirth of artificial intelligence (1941-56)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earliest research into thinking machines was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that it might be possible to construct an \"electronic brain\".\n\nIn the 1940s and 50s, a handful of scientists from a variety of fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) explored several research directions that would be vital to later AI research.[56] Alan Turing was among the first people to seriously investigate the theoretical possibility of \"machine intelligence\". The field of \"artificial intelligence research\" was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[58]\n\nTuring Test\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Turing test\n\nIn 1950 Turing published a landmark paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines that think.[60][b] In the paper, he noted that \"thinking\" is difficult to define and devised his famous Turing Test: If a machine could carry on a conversation (over a teleprinter) that was indistinguishable from a conversation with a human being, then it was reasonable to say that the machine was \"thinking\". This simplified version of the problem allowed Turing to argue convincingly that a \"thinking machine\" was at least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition.[62] The Turing Test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.\n\nArtificial neural networks\n\n[edit]\n\nWalter Pitts and Warren McCulloch analyzed networks of idealized artificial neurons and showed how they might perform simple logical functions in 1943.[63][64] They were the first to describe what later researchers would call a neural network.[65] The paper was influenced by Turing's paper 'On Computable Numbers' from 1936 using similar two-state boolean 'neurons', but was the first to apply it to neuronal function. One of the students inspired by Pitts and McCulloch was Marvin Minsky who was a 24-year-old graduate student at the time. In 1951 Minsky and Dean Edmonds built the first neural net machine, the SNARC.[66] Minsky would later become one of the most important leaders and innovators in AI.\n\nCybernetic robots\n\n[edit]\n\nExperimental robots such as W. Grey Walter's turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast, were built in the 1950s. These machines did not use computers, digital electronics or symbolic reasoning; they were controlled entirely by analog circuitry.[67]\n\nGame AI\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1951, using the Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the University of Manchester, Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers program and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess.[68] Arthur Samuel's checkers program, the subject of his 1959 paper \"Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers\", eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur.[69] Game AI would continue to be used as a measure of progress in AI throughout its history.\n\nSymbolic reasoning and the Logic Theorist\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Logic theorist\n\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the mid-fifties, a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could well be the essence of human thought. This was a new approach to creating thinking machines.[70]\n\nIn 1955, Allen Newell and future Nobel Laureate Herbert A. Simon created the \"Logic Theorist\", with help from J. C. Shaw. The program would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, and find new and more elegant proofs for some.[71] Simon said that they had \"solved the venerable mind/body problem, explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind.\"[72] This was an early statement of the philosophical position John Searle would later call \"Strong AI\": that machines can contain minds just as human bodies do.[73] The symbolic reasoning paradigm they introduced would dominate AI research and funding until the middle 90s, as well as inspire the cognitive revolution.\n\nDartmouth Workshop\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Dartmouth workshop\n\nThe Dartmouth workshop of 1956 was a pivotal event that marked the formal inception of AI as an academic discipline.[74] It was organized by Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, with the support of two senior scientists Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester of IBM. The proposal for the conference stated they intended to test the assertion that \"every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".[75] The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was introduced by John McCarthy at the workshop.[76][c] The participants included Ray Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Trenchard More, Arthur Samuel, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, all of whom would create important programs during the first decades of AI research.[78] At the workshop Newell and Simon debuted the \"Logic Theorist\". The workshop was the moment that AI gained its name, its mission, its first major success and its key players, and is widely considered the birth of AI.[80]\n\nCognitive revolution\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: cognitive revolution\n\nIn the fall of 1956, Newell and Simon also presented the Logic Theorist at a meeting of the Special Interest Group in Information Theory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At the same meeting, Noam Chomsky discussed his generative grammar, and George Miller described his landmark paper \"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two\". Miller wrote \"I left the symposium with a conviction, more intuitive than rational, that experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and the computer simulation of cognitive processes were all pieces from a larger whole.\"[81]\n\nThis meeting was the beginning of the \"cognitive revolution\"—an interdisciplinary paradigm shift in psychology, philosophy, computer science and neuroscience. It inspired the creation of the sub-fields of symbolic artificial intelligence, generative linguistics, cognitive science, cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience and the philosophical schools of computationalism and functionalism. All these fields used related tools to model the mind and results discovered in one field were relevant to the others.\n\nThe cognitive approach allowed researchers to consider \"mental objects\" like thoughts, plans, goals, facts or memories, often analyzed using high level symbols in functional networks. These objects had been forbidden as \"unobservable\" by earlier paradigms such as behaviorism. Symbolic mental objects would become the major focus of AI research and funding for the next several decades.\n\nEarly successes (1956-1974)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe programs developed in the years after the Dartmouth Workshop were, to most people, simply \"astonishing\":[82] computers were solving algebra word problems, proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak English. Few at the time would have believed that such \"intelligent\" behavior by machines was possible at all.[83] Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years.[84] Government agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA, then known as \"ARPA\") poured money into the field.[85] Artificial Intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and US universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nApproaches\n\n[edit]\n\nThere were many successful programs and new directions in the late 50s and 1960s. Among the most influential were these:\n\nReasoning as search\n\n[edit]\n\nMany early AI programs used the same basic algorithm. To achieve some goal (like winning a game or proving a theorem), they proceeded step by step towards it (by making a move or a deduction) as if searching through a maze, backtracking whenever they reached a dead end.\n\nThe principal difficulty was that, for many problems, the number of possible paths through the \"maze\" was astronomical (a situation known as a \"combinatorial explosion\"). Researchers would reduce the search space by using heuristics that would eliminate paths that were unlikely to lead to a solution.[86]\n\nNewell and Simon tried to capture a general version of this algorithm in a program called the \"General Problem Solver\".[87] Other \"searching\" programs were able to accomplish impressive tasks like solving problems in geometry and algebra, such as Herbert Gelernter's Geometry Theorem Prover (1958) and Symbolic Automatic Integrator (SAINT), written by Minsky's student James Slagle in 1961.[88] Other programs searched through goals and subgoals to plan actions, like the STRIPS system developed at Stanford to control the behavior of the robot Shakey.[89]\n\nNatural language\n\n[edit]\n\nAn important goal of AI research is to allow computers to communicate in natural languages like English. An early success was Daniel Bobrow's program STUDENT, which could solve high school algebra word problems.[90]\n\nA semantic net represents concepts (e.g. \"house\", \"door\") as nodes, and relations among concepts as links between the nodes (e.g. \"has-a\"). The first AI program to use a semantic net was written by Ross Quillian[91] and the most successful (and controversial) version was Roger Schank's Conceptual dependency theory.[92]\n\nJoseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA could carry out conversations that were so realistic that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with a human being and not a computer program (see ELIZA effect). But in fact, ELIZA simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to it, rephrasing its response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatbot.[93]\n\nMicro-worlds\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the late 60s, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert of the MIT AI Laboratory proposed that AI research should focus on artificially simple situations known as micro-worlds. They pointed out that in successful sciences like physics, basic principles were often best understood using simplified models like frictionless planes or perfectly rigid bodies. Much of the research focused on a \"blocks world,\" which consists of colored blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface.[94]\n\nThis paradigm led to innovative work in machine vision by Gerald Sussman, Adolfo Guzman, David Waltz (who invented \"constraint propagation\"), and especially Patrick Winston. At the same time, Minsky and Papert built a robot arm that could stack blocks, bringing the blocks world to life. Terry Winograd's SHRDLU could communicate in ordinary English sentences about the micro-world, plan operations and execute them.[95]\n\nPerceptrons\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Perceptron\n\nIn the 1960s the cognitive revolution was highly influential and most funding was directed towards laboratories researching symbolic AI. However, there was one exception: the perceptron, a single-layer neural network introduced in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt (who had been a schoolmate of Marvin Minsky at the Bronx High School of Science). Like most AI researchers, he was optimistic about their power, predicting that a perceptron “may eventually be able to learn, make decisions, and translate languages.\"[98]\n\nRosenblatt was primarily funded by Office of Naval Research.[99] Bernard Widrow and his student Ted Hoff built ADALINE (1960) and MADALINE (1962), which had up to 1000 adjustable weights.[100] A group at Stanford Research Institute led by Charles A. Rosen and Alfred E. (Ted) Brain built two neural network machines named MINOS I (1960) and II (1963), mainly funded by U.S. Army Signal Corps. MINOS II[101] had 6600 adjustable weights,[102] and was controlled with an SDS 910 computer in a configuration named MINOS III (1968), which could classify symbols on army maps, and recognize hand-printed characters on Fortran coding sheets.[103][105]\n\nMost of neural network research during this early period involved building and using bespoke hardware, rather than simulation on digital computers. The hardware diversity was particularly clear in the different technologies used in implementing the adjustable weights. The perceptron machines and the SNARC used potentiometers moved by electric motors. ADALINE used memistors adjusted by electroplating, though they also used simulations on an IBM 1620 computer. The MINOS machines used ferrite cores with multiple holes in them that could be individually blocked, with the degree of blockage representing the weights.[106]\n\nHowever, partly due to lack of results and partly due to competition from symbolic AI research, the MINOS project ran out of funding in 1966. Rosenblatt failed to secure continued funding in the 1960s.[106] In 1969, research came to a sudden halt with the publication of Minsky and Papert's 1969 book Perceptrons. It suggested that there were severe limitations to what perceptrons could do and that Rosenblatt's predictions had been grossly exaggerated. The effect of the book was that virtually no research was funded in connectionism for 10 years.[98] The competition for government funding ended with the victory of symbolic AI approaches over neural networks.[105][106]\n\nMinsky (who had worked on SNARC) became a staunch objector to pure connectionist AI. Widrow (who had worked on ADALINE) turned to adaptive signal processing. The SRI group (which worked on MINOS) turned to symbolic AI and robotics.[105][106]\n\nThe main problem was the inability to train multilayered networks (versions of backpropagation had already been used in other fields but it was unknown to these researchers). Rosenblatt attempted to gather funds for building larger perceptron machines, but he died in a boating accident in 1971.[98]\n\nOptimism\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first generation of AI researchers made these predictions about their work:\n\n1958, H. A. Simon and Allen Newell: \"within ten years a digital computer will be the world's chess champion\" and \"within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem.\"[108]\n\n1965, H. A. Simon: \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.\"[109]\n\n1967, Marvin Minsky: \"Within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved.\"[110]\n\n1970, Marvin Minsky (in Life Magazine): \"In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.\"[111]\n\nFinancing\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 1963, MIT received a $2.2 million grant from the newly created Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later known as DARPA). The money was used to fund project MAC which subsumed the \"AI Group\" founded by Minsky and McCarthy five years earlier. DARPA continued to provide $3 million each year until the 70s.[112] DARPA made similar grants to Newell and Simon's program at Carnegie Mellon University and to Stanford University's AI Lab, founded by John McCarthy in 1963.[113] Another important AI laboratory was established at Edinburgh University by Donald Michie in 1965.[114] These four institutions would continue to be the main centers of AI research and funding in academia for many years.[115]\n\nThe money was given with few strings attached: J. C. R. Licklider, then the director of ARPA, believed that his organization should \"fund people, not projects!\" and allowed researchers to pursue whatever directions might interest them.[116] This created a freewheeling atmosphere at MIT that gave birth to the hacker culture,[117] but this \"hands off\" approach did not last.\n\nFirst AI Winter (1974–1980)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised public expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding targeted at AI was severely reduced. The lack of success indicated the techniques being used by AI researchers at the time were insufficient to achieve their goals.\n\nThese setbacks did not affect the growth and progress of the field, however. The funding cuts only impacted a handful of major laboratories and the critiques were largely ignored. General public interest in the field continued to grow, the number of researchers increased dramatically, and new ideas were explored in logic programming, commonsense reasoning and many other areas. Historian Thomas Haigh argues that there was no winter, and AI researcher Nils Nilsson described this period as the most \"exciting\" time to work in AI.\n\nProblems\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early seventies, the capabilities of AI programs were limited. Even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve; all the programs were, in some sense, \"toys\".[124] AI researchers had begun to run into several limits that would be only conquered decades later, and others that still stymie the field in the 2020s:[125]\n\nLimited computer power. There was not enough memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful.[126] For example: Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only 20 words, because that was all that would fit in memory. Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power in the same way that aircraft require horsepower. Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power increases, eventually it could become easy. \"With enough horsepower,\" he wrote, \"anything will fly\".[d]\n\nIntractability and the combinatorial explosion. In 1972 Richard Karp (building on Stephen Cook's 1971 theorem) showed there are many problems that can only be solved in exponential time. Finding optimal solutions to these problems requires extraordinary amounts of computer time, except when the problems are trivial. This meant that many of the \"toy\" solutions used by AI would never scale to useful systems.[130]\n\nCommonsense knowledge and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require enormous amounts of information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database large enough and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.[131]\n\nMoravec's paradox: Proving theorems and solving geometry problems is comparatively easy for computers, but a supposedly simple task like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything is extremely difficult, and research into vision and robotics made little progress in the early 1970s.[132]\n\nThe frame and qualification problems. AI researchers (like John McCarthy) who used logic discovered that they could not represent ordinary deductions that involved planning or default reasoning without making changes to the structure of logic itself. They developed new logics (like non-monotonic logics and modal logics) to try to solve the problems.[133]\n\nDecrease in funding\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: AI winter\n\nThe agencies which funded AI research, such as the British government, DARPA and the National Research Council (NRC) became frustrated with the lack of progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected AI research. The pattern began in 1966 when the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report criticized machine translation efforts. After spending $20 million, the NRC ended all support.[134] In 1973, the Lighthill report on the state of AI research in the UK criticized the failure of AI to achieve its \"grandiose objectives\" and led to the dismantling of AI research in that country.[135] (The report specifically mentioned the combinatorial explosion problem as a reason for AI's failings.)[136][e] DARPA was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the Speech Understanding Research program at CMU and canceled an annual grant of $3 million.[f]\n\nHans Moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues. \"Many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration.\" [g] However, there was another issue: since the passage of the Mansfield Amendment in 1969, DARPA had been under increasing pressure to fund \"mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research\". Funding for the creative, freewheeling exploration that had gone on in the 60s would not come from DARPA, which instead directed money at specific projects with clear objectives, such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems. [h]\n\nThe major laboratories (MIT, Stanford and CMU) had been receiving generous support from the U.S. military, and when it was withdrawn, these were the only places that were seriously impacted by the budget cuts. The thousands of researchers outside these institutions and the many more thousands that were joining the field were unaffected.\n\nPhilosophical and ethical critiques\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Philosophy of artificial intelligence\n\nSeveral philosophers had strong objections to the claims being made by AI researchers. One of the earliest was John Lucas, who argued that Gödel's incompleteness theorem showed that a formal system (such as a computer program) could never see the truth of certain statements, while a human being could.[140] Hubert Dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises of the 1960s and critiqued the assumptions of AI, arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little \"symbol processing\" and a great deal of embodied, instinctive, unconscious \"know how\".[141][142] John Searle's Chinese Room argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program could not be said to \"understand\" the symbols that it uses (a quality called \"intentionality\"). If the symbols have no meaning for the machine, Searle argued, then the machine can not be described as \"thinking\".[143]\n\nThese critiques were not taken seriously by AI researchers. Problems like intractability and commonsense knowledge seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference \"know how\" or \"intentionality\" made to an actual computer program. MIT's Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle \"they misunderstand, and should be ignored.\"[144] Dreyfus, who also taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers \"dared not be seen having lunch with me.\"[145] Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, was also an outspoken critic of Dreyfus' positions, but he \"deliberately made it plain that [his AI colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus] was not the way to treat a human being,\"[146] and was unprofessional and childish.[147]\n\nWeizenbaum began to have serious ethical doubts about AI when Kenneth Colby wrote a \"computer program which can conduct psychotherapeutic dialogue\" based on ELIZA.[148] Weizenbaum was disturbed that Colby saw a mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool. A feud began, and the situation was not helped when Colby did not credit Weizenbaum for his contribution to the program. In 1976, Weizenbaum published Computer Power and Human Reason which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life.[149]\n\nLogic at Stanford, CMU and Edinburgh\n\n[edit]\n\nLogic was introduced into AI research as early as 1959, by John McCarthy in his Advice Taker proposal.[150] In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had discovered a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 1960s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems.[151] A more fruitful approach to logic was developed in the 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel [fr] who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.[152] Prolog uses a subset of logic (Horn clauses, closely related to \"rules\" and \"production rules\") that permit tractable computation. Rules would continue to be influential, providing a foundation for Edward Feigenbaum's expert systems and the continuing work by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon that would lead to Soar and their unified theories of cognition.[153]\n\nCritics of the logical approach noted, as Dreyfus had, that human beings rarely used logic when they solved problems. Experiments by psychologists like Peter Wason, Eleanor Rosch, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman and others provided proof.[154] McCarthy responded that what people do is irrelevant. He argued that what is really needed are machines that can solve problems—not machines that think as people do.[155]\n\nMIT's \"anti-logic\" approach\n\n[edit]\n\nAmong the critics of McCarthy's approach were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like \"story understanding\" and \"object recognition\" that required a machine to think like a person. In order to use ordinary concepts like \"chair\" or \"restaurant\" they had to make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic. Gerald Sussman observed that \"using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn't make them any more precise.\"[156] Schank described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"scruffy\", as opposed to the \"neat\" paradigms used by McCarthy, Kowalski, Feigenbaum, Newell and Simon.[157]\n\nIn 1975, in a seminal paper, Minsky noted that many of his fellow researchers were using the same kind of tool: a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something. For example, if we use the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on. We know these facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not be \"logical\", but these structured sets of assumptions are part of the context of everything we say and think. He called these structures \"frames\". Schank used a version of frames he called \"scripts\" to successfully answer questions about short stories in English.[158]\n\nThe emergence of non-monotonic logics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe logicians rose to the challenge. Pat Hayes claimed that \"most of 'frames' is just a new syntax for parts of first-order logic.\" But he noted that \"there are one or two apparently minor details which give a lot of trouble, however, especially defaults\".[159] In the meanwhile, Ray Reiter admitted that \"conventional logics, such as first-order logic, lack the expressive power to adequately represent the knowledge required for reasoning by default\".[160] He proposed augmenting first-order logic with a closed world assumption that a conclusion holds (by default) if its contrary cannot be shown. He showed how such an assumption corresponds to the common sense assumption made in reasoning with frames. He also showed that it has its \"procedural equivalent\" as negation as failure in Prolog.\n\nThe closed world assumption, as formulated by Reiter, \"is not a first-order notion. (It is a meta notion.)\"[160] However, Keith Clark showed that negation as finite failure can be understood as reasoning implicitly with definitions in first-order logic including a unique name assumption that different terms denote different individuals.[161]\n\nDuring the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, a variety of logics and extensions of first-order logic were developed both for negation as failure in logic programming and for default reasoning more generally. Collectively, these logics have become known as non-monotonic logics.\n\nBoom (1980–1987)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 1980s, a form of AI program called \"expert systems\" was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. Governments provided substantial funding, such as Japan's fifth generation computer project and the U.S. Strategic Computing Initiative.\n\nAlthough symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning produced these useful applications in the 80s, it was still unable to solve problems in perception, robotics, learning and common sense. A small number of scientists and engineers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would ever be sufficient for these tasks and developed other approaches, such as connectionism, robotics, and soft computing.\n\nExpert systems become widely used\n\n[edit]\n\nAn expert system is a program that answers questions or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.[162]\n\nExpert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem) and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place. All in all, the programs proved to be useful: something that AI had not been able to achieve up to this point.[163]\n\nIn 1980, an expert system called XCON was completed at CMU for the Digital Equipment Corporation. It was an enormous success: it was saving the company 40 million dollars annually by 1986.[164] Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it to in-house AI departments.[165] An industry grew up to support them, including hardware companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines and software companies such as IntelliCorp and Aion.[166]\n\nGovernment funding increases\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1981, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry set aside $850 million for the Fifth generation computer project. Their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations, translate languages, interpret pictures, and reason like human beings.[167] Much to the chagrin of scruffies, they chose Prolog as the primary computer language for the project.\n\nOther countries responded with new programs of their own. The UK began the £350 million Alvey project. A consortium of American companies formed the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (or \"MCC\") to fund large scale projects in AI and information technology. DARPA responded as well, founding the Strategic Computing Initiative and tripling its investment in AI between 1984 and 1988.[171]\n\nKnowledge revolution\n\n[edit]\n\nThe power of expert systems came from the expert knowledge they contained. They were part of a new direction in AI research that had been gaining ground throughout the 70s. \"AI researchers were beginning to suspect—reluctantly, for it violated the scientific canon of parsimony—that intelligence might very well be based on the ability to use large amounts of diverse knowledge in different ways,\"[172] writes Pamela McCorduck. \"[T]he great lesson from the 1970s was that intelligent behavior depended very much on dealing with knowledge, sometimes quite detailed knowledge, of a domain where a given task lay\".[173] Knowledge based systems and knowledge engineering became a major focus of AI research in the 1980s.[174]\n\nThe 1980s also saw the birth of Cyc, the first attempt to attack the commonsense knowledge problem directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows. Douglas Lenat, who started and led the project, argued that there is no shortcut ― the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand. The project was not expected to be completed for many decades.[175]\n\nChess playing programs HiTech and Deep Thought defeated chess masters in 1989. Both were developed by Carnegie Mellon University; Deep Thought development paved the way for Deep Blue.[176]\n\nRevival of neural networks: connectionism\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1982, physicist John Hopfield was able to prove that a form of neural network (now called a \"Hopfield net\") could learn and process information, and provably converges after enough time under any fixed condition. It was a breakthrough, as it was previously thought that nonlinear networks would, in general, evolve chaotically.[177] Around the same time, Geoffrey Hinton and David Rumelhart popularized a method for training neural networks called \"backpropagation\".[i] These two discoveries helped to revive the exploration of artificial neural networks.\n\nNeural networks, along with several other similar models, received widespread attention after the 1986 publication of the Parallel Distributed Processing, a two volume collection of papers edited by Rumelhart and psychologist James McClelland. The new field was christened connectionism and there was a considerable debate between advocates of symbolic AI the \"connectionists\".\n\nIn 1990, Yann LeCun at Bell Labs used convolutional neural networks to recognize handwritten digits. The system was used widely in 90s, reading zip codes and personal checks. This was the first genuinely useful application of neural networks.\n\nRobotics and embodied reason\n\n[edit]\n\nRodney Brooks, Hans Moravec and others argued that, in order to show real intelligence, a machine needs to have a body — it needs to perceive, move, survive and deal with the world. Sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills such as commonsense reasoning. They can't be efficiently implemented using abstract symbolic reasoning, so AI should solve the problems of perception, mobility, manipulation and survival without using symbolic representation at all. These robotics researchers advocated building intelligence \"from the bottom up\".[j]\n\nA precursor to this idea was David Marr, who had come to MIT in the late 1970s from a successful background in theoretical neuroscience to lead the group studying vision. He rejected all symbolic approaches (both McCarthy's logic and Minsky's frames), arguing that AI needed to understand the physical machinery of vision from the bottom up before any symbolic processing took place. (Marr's work would be cut short by leukemia in 1980.)\n\nIn his 1990 paper \"Elephants Don't Play Chess,\" robotics researcher Brooks took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since \"the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail there is to be known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough.\"\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the embodied mind thesis.[186]\n\nBust: second AI winter\n\n[edit]\n\nThe business community's fascination with AI rose and fell in the 1980s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble. As dozens of companies failed, the perception in the business world was that the technology was not viable. The damage to AI's reputation would last into the 21st century. Inside the field there was little agreement on the reasons for AI's failure to fulfill the dream of human level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the 1960s. Together, all these factors helped to fragment AI into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches, sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of \"artificial intelligence\".\n\nOver the next 20 years, AI consistently delivered working solutions to specific isolated problems. By the late 1990s, it was being used throughout the technology industry, although somewhat behind the scenes. The success was due to increasing computer power, by collaboration with other fields (such as mathematical optimization and statistics) and using the highest standards of scientific accountability. By 2000, AI had achieved some of its oldest goals. The field was both more cautious and more successful than it had ever been.\n\nAI winter\n\n[edit]\n\nThe term \"AI winter\" was coined by researchers who had survived the funding cuts of 1974 when they became concerned that enthusiasm for expert systems had spiraled out of control and that disappointment would certainly follow.[189] Their fears were well founded: in the late 1980s and early 1990s, AI suffered a series of financial setbacks.\n\nThe first indication of a change in weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more powerful than the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.[190]\n\nEventually the earliest successful expert systems, such as XCON, proved too expensive to maintain. They were difficult to update, they could not learn, they were \"brittle\" (i.e., they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs), and they fell prey to problems (such as the qualification problem) that had been identified years earlier. Expert systems proved useful, but only in a few special contexts.[191]\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Strategic Computing Initiative cut funding to AI \"deeply and brutally\". New leadership at DARPA had decided that AI was not \"the next wave\" and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results.[192]\n\nBy 1991, the impressive list of goals penned in 1981 for Japan's Fifth Generation Project had not been met. Indeed, some of them, like \"carry on a casual conversation\" had not been met by 2010.[193] As with other AI projects, expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible.[193][194]\n\nOver 300 AI companies had shut down, gone bankrupt, or been acquired by the end of 1993, effectively ending the first commercial wave of AI.[195] In 1994, HP Newquist stated in The Brain Makers that \"The immediate future of artificial intelligence—in its commercial form—seems to rest in part on the continued success of neural networks.\"[195]\n\nAI behind the scenes\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 1990s, algorithms originally developed by AI researchers began to appear as parts of larger systems. AI had solved a lot of very difficult problems[196] and their solutions proved to be useful throughout the technology industry,[197] such as data mining, industrial robotics, logistics,[198] speech recognition,[199] banking software,[200] medical diagnosis[200] and Google's search engine.[201]\n\nThe field of AI received little or no credit for these successes in the 1990s and early 2000s. Many of AI's greatest innovations have been reduced to the status of just another item in the tool chest of computer science.[202] Nick Bostrom explains \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"[203]\n\nMany researchers in AI in the 1990s deliberately called their work by other names, such as informatics, knowledge-based systems, \"cognitive systems\" or computational intelligence. In part, this may have been because they considered their field to be fundamentally different from AI, but also the new names help to procure funding. In the commercial world at least, the failed promises of the AI Winter continued to haunt AI research into the 2000s, as the New York Times reported in 2005: \"Computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers.\"[204][205][206][207]\n\nMilestones and Moore's law\n\n[edit]\n\nOn May 11, 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.[208] The super computer was a specialized version of a framework produced by IBM, and was capable of processing twice as many moves per second as it had during the first match (which Deep Blue had lost), reportedly 200,000,000 moves per second.[209]\n\nIn 2005, a Stanford robot won the DARPA Grand Challenge by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail.[210] Two years later, a team from CMU won the DARPA Urban Challenge by autonomously navigating 55 miles in an urban environment while responding to traffic hazards and adhering to traffic laws.[211] In February 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two best Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[212]\n\nThese successes were not due to some revolutionary new paradigm, but mostly on the tedious application of engineering skill and on the tremendous increase in the speed and capacity of computer by the 90s.[213] In fact, Deep Blue's computer was 10 million times faster than the Ferranti Mark 1 that Christopher Strachey taught to play chess in 1951.[214] This dramatic increase is measured by Moore's law, which predicts that the speed and memory capacity of computers doubles every two years, as a result of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) transistor counts doubling every two years. The fundamental problem of \"raw computer power\" was slowly being overcome.\n\nIntelligent agents\n\n[edit]\n\nA new paradigm called \"intelligent agents\" became widely accepted during the 1990s.[215] Although earlier researchers had proposed modular \"divide and conquer\" approaches to AI,[216] the intelligent agent did not reach its modern form until Judea Pearl, Allen Newell, Leslie P. Kaelbling, and others brought concepts from decision theory and economics into the study of AI.[217] When the economist's definition of a rational agent was married to computer science's definition of an object or module, the intelligent agent paradigm was complete.\n\nAn intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. By this definition, simple programs that solve specific problems are \"intelligent agents\", as are human beings and organizations of human beings, such as firms. The intelligent agent paradigm defines AI research as \"the study of intelligent agents\". This is a generalization of some earlier definitions of AI: it goes beyond studying human intelligence; it studies all kinds of intelligence.[218]\n\nThe paradigm gave researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that were both verifiable and useful. It provided a common language to describe problems and share their solutions with each other, and with other fields that also used concepts of abstract agents, like economics and control theory. It was hoped that a complete agent architecture (like Newell's SOAR) would one day allow researchers to build more versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents.[217][219]\n\nProbabilistic reasoning and greater rigor\n\n[edit]\n\nAI researchers began to develop and use sophisticated mathematical tools more than they ever had in the past.[220] There was a widespread realization that many of the problems that AI needed to solve were already being worked on by researchers in fields like mathematics, electrical engineering, economics or operations research. The shared mathematical language allowed both a higher level of collaboration with more established and successful fields and the achievement of results which were measurable and provable; AI had become a more rigorous \"scientific\" discipline.\n\nJudea Pearl's influential 1988 book[221] brought probability and decision theory into AI. Among the many new tools in use were Bayesian networks, hidden Markov models, information theory, stochastic modeling and classical optimization. Precise mathematical descriptions were also developed for \"computational intelligence\" paradigms like neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.[222]\n\nDeep learning, big data (2011–2020)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, access to large amounts of data (known as \"big data\"), cheaper and faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy. In fact, McKinsey Global Institute estimated in their famous paper \"Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity\" that \"by 2009, nearly all sectors in the US economy had at least an average of 200 terabytes of stored data\".\n\nBy 2016, the market for AI-related products, hardware, and software reached more than $8 billion, and the New York Times reported that interest in AI had reached a \"frenzy\".[223] The applications of big data began to reach into other fields as well, such as training models in ecology[224] and for various applications in economics.[225] Advances in deep learning (particularly deep convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) drove progress and research in image and video processing, text analysis, and even speech recognition.[226]\n\nThe first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park, UK, in November 2023 to discuss the short- and long-term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[227] Twenty-eight countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.[228][229]\n\nDeep learning\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Deep learning\n\nDeep learning is a branch of machine learning that models high level abstractions in data by using a deep graph with many processing layers.[226] According to the Universal approximation theorem, deep-ness isn't necessary for a neural network to be able to approximate arbitrary continuous functions. Even so, there are many problems that are common to shallow networks (such as overfitting) that deep networks help avoid.[230] As such, deep neural networks are able to realistically generate much more complex models as compared to their shallow counterparts.\n\nHowever, deep learning has problems of its own. A common problem for recurrent neural networks is the vanishing gradient problem, which is where gradients passed between layers gradually shrink and literally disappear as they are rounded off to zero. There have been many methods developed to approach this problem, such as Long short-term memory units.\n\nState-of-the-art deep neural network architectures can sometimes even rival human accuracy in fields like computer vision, specifically on things like the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database, and traffic sign recognition.[231]\n\nLanguage processing engines powered by smart search engines can easily beat humans at answering general trivia questions (such as IBM Watson), and recent developments in deep learning have produced surprising results in competing with humans, specifically in games like Go, and Doom (which, being a first-person shooter game, has sparked some controversy).[232][233][234][235]\n\nBig data\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Big data\n\nBig data refers to a collection of data that cannot be captured, managed, and processed by conventional software tools within a certain time frame. It is a massive amount of decision-making, insight, and process optimization capabilities that require new processing models. In the book \"Big Data Era\" by Victor Meyer Schonberg and Kenneth Cooke, big data means that instead of random analysis (sample survey), all data is used for analysis. The \"5V\" characteristics of big data, as proposed by IBM, are: Volume, Velocity, Variety,[236] Value,[237] Veracity.[238]\n\nThe strategic significance of big data technology is not to master huge data information, but to specialize in meaningful data. In other words, if big data is likened to an industry, the key to realizing profitability in this industry is to increase the \"process capability\" of the data and realize the \"value added\" of the data through \"processing\".\n\nLarge language models, AI boom (2020–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: AI boom\n\nThe AI boom started with the initial development of key architectures and algorithms such as the transformer architecture in 2017, leading to the scaling and development of large language models exhibiting human-like traits of reasoning, cognition, attention and creativity. The new AI era has been said to have begun around 2022–2023, with the public release of scaled large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT.[239][240][241][242][243]\n\nLarge language models\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Large language models\n\nIn 2017, the transformer architecture was proposed by Google researchers. It exploits an attention mechanism and later became widely used in large language models.[244]\n\nFoundation models, which are large language models trained on vast quantities of unlabeled data that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks, began to be developed in 2018.\n\nModels such as GPT-3 released by OpenAI in 2020, and Gato released by DeepMind in 2022, have been described as important achievements of machine learning.\n\nIn 2023, Microsoft Research tested the GPT-4 large language model with a large variety of tasks, and concluded that \"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\".[245]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nHistory of artificial neural networks\n\nHistory of knowledge representation and reasoning\n\nHistory of natural language processing\n\nOutline of artificial intelligence\n\nProgress in artificial intelligence\n\nTimeline of artificial intelligence\n\nTimeline of machine learning\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
