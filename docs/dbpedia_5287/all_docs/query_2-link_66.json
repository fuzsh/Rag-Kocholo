        "text": "New Zealand composer and cellist\n\nArnold Wilberforce Trowell, also known as Thomas Wilberforce Trowell, (25 June 1887 – 16 December 1966) was a New Zealand composer, cellist and teacher, who became Professor of Music at the Guildhall School of Music in London.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nArnold Trowell was born in Wellington, New Zealand in 1887.[1] He was the son of Thomas Trowell and twin of Garnet Carrington Trowell.[2] In 1903 both brothers went to Europe to study; Arnold the cello and Garnet the violin.[1]\n\nTrowell studied at the Hoch Conservatorium in Frankfurt and in Brussels, winning the Concours prize for the cello.[1] He settled in London in 1907.[3]\n\nBefore leaving for Europe Trowell had become friends, and romantically involved, with Katherine Mansfield and they continued to correspond when Mansfield was living in London and Trowell was studying in Brussels. Mansfield later fell in love with Garnet.[4]\n\nTrowell became a member of The Chamber Music Players, a group formed by Lionel Tertis, in 1922 until 1923.[5]\n\nHe became Professor of Cello at the Guildhall School of Music in 1924 and joined the staff of the Royal School of Music from 1937.[2]\n\nTrowell was both performer and composer.[6] He wrote seven concertos, three sonatas, four symphonic poems and numerous pieces for cello and piano[3] and songs.[7]\n\nLike Fritz Kreisler, Trowell forged in 1924 a version of Louis Francœur's cello/violin sonata in E (which is also often misattributed to Francœur's brother, François Francœur). Trowell replaced Francœur's second movement with his own Allegro Vivo movement and modified the final Gigue movement. There are several recordings of the forgery with this misattribution.[8][9][10][11][12]\n\nSelected works\n\n[edit]\n\nSix morceaux pour violoncelle avec accomp. de piano (1908) - dedicated to Kathleen M. Beauchamp\n\nConcerto for violoncelle avec accompagnement d'orchestre (ou piano) (c1909)\n\nQuartet for two violins, viola and violoncello, G major (c1917)\n\nViola Sonata, E-flat major (c1922) - dedicated to Lionel Tertis\n\nTechnology of violoncello playing - Books 1–3 (1922–1925)\n\nSuite for orchestra : the golden age : childhood (c1930)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nGriffiths, M.
