        "text": "The changes were sparked by a series of antitrust lawsuits against the National Association of Realtors\n\nThe three investigations against ex-officer Nicolas Paloma were dropped or fell inactive in the months following his arrest.\n\nDeputy Chief Ruth Cate sent an email addressing criticism of women in law enforcement following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump.\n\nTubular Tokes’ Skylar Strickland has been jokingly called the “vape Nazi,” but his battery arrest and use of bear spray have some concerned.\n\n“Simply put, we bought a beautiful condo 32 years ago that was supposed to be our forever home,” they wrote in a letter to Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nSome key positions remain up for grabs as the Bulls break camp this weekend."
