        "text": "Landmark U.S. civil rights and labor law\n\nThis article is about the 1964 Civil Rights Act. For other American laws called the Civil Rights Acts, see Civil Rights Act.\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964Long titleAn Act to enforce the constitutional right to vote, to confer jurisdiction upon the district courts of the United States of America to provide injunctive relief against discrimination in public accommodations, to authorize the Attorney General to institute suits to protect constitutional rights in public facilities and public education, to extend the Commission on Civil Rights, to prevent discrimination in federally assisted programs, to establish a Commission on Equal Employment Opportunity, and for other purposes.Enacted bythe 88th United States CongressEffectiveJuly 2, 1964; 60 years ago ( )CitationsPublic law88-352Statutes at Large78 Stat. 241CodificationActs amendedTitles amendedTitle 42—The Public Health and WelfareLegislative history\n\nIntroduced in the House as H.R. 7152 by Emanuel Celler (D–NY) on June 20, 1963\n\nCommittee consideration by Judiciary\n\nPassed the House on February 10, 1964[1] (290–130)\n\nPassed the Senate on June 19, 1964[2] (73–27) with amendment\n\nHouse agreed to Senate amendment on July 2, 1964[3] (289–126)\n\nSigned into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 2, 1964\n\nMajor amendmentsUnited States Supreme Court cases\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 88–352, 78 Stat. 241, enacted July 2, 1964) is a landmark civil rights and labor law in the United States that outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex,[a] and national origin.[4] It prohibits unequal application of voter registration requirements, racial segregation in schools and public accommodations, and employment discrimination. The act \"remains one of the most significant legislative achievements in American history\".[5]\n\nInitially, powers given to enforce the act were weak, but these were supplemented during later years. Congress asserted its authority to legislate under several different parts of the United States Constitution, principally its enumerated power to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause of Article I, Section VIII, its duty to guarantee all citizens equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment, and its duty to protect voting rights under the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nThe legislation was proposed by President John F. Kennedy in June 1963, but it was opposed by filibuster in the Senate. After Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed the bill forward. The United States House of Representatives passed the bill on February 10, 1964, and after a 72-day filibuster, it passed the United States Senate on June 19, 1964. The final vote was 290–130 in the House of Representatives and 73–27 in the Senate.[6] After the House agreed to a subsequent Senate amendment, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed into law by President Johnson at the White House on July 2, 1964.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nReconstruction and New Deal era\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 1883 landmark Civil Rights Cases, the United States Supreme Court had ruled that Congress did not have the power to prohibit discrimination in the private sector, thus stripping the Civil Rights Act of 1875 of much of its ability to protect civil rights.[7]\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the legal justification for voiding the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was part of a larger trend by members of the United States Supreme Court to invalidate most government regulations of the private sector, except when dealing with laws designed to protect traditional public morality.\n\nIn the 1930s, during the New Deal, the majority of the Supreme Court justices gradually shifted their legal theory to allow for greater government regulation of the private sector under the Commerce Clause, thus paving the way for the federal government to enact civil rights laws prohibiting both public and private sector discrimination on the basis of the commerce clause.\n\nInfluenced in part by the \"Black Cabinet\" advisors and the March on Washington Movement, just before the U.S. entered World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, the first federal anti-discrimination order, and established the Fair Employment Practices Committee.[8] Roosevelt's successor, President Harry Truman, appointed the President's Committee on Civil Rights, proposed the 20th century's first comprehensive Civil Rights Act, and issued Executive Order 9980 and Executive Order 9981, providing for fair employment and desegregation throughout the federal government and the armed forces.[9]\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1957\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1957, signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on September 9, 1957, was the first federal civil rights legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to become law. After the Supreme Court ruled school segregation unconstitutional in 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education, Southern Democrats began a campaign of \"massive resistance\" against desegregation, and even the few moderate white leaders shifted to openly racist positions.[10][11] Partly in an effort to defuse calls for more far-reaching reforms, Eisenhower proposed a civil rights bill that would increase the protection of African American voting rights.[12]\n\nDespite having a limited impact on African-American voter participation, at a time when black voter registration was just 20%, the Civil Rights Act of 1957 did establish the United States Commission on Civil Rights and the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. By 1960, black voting had increased by only 3%,[13] and Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which eliminated certain loopholes left by the 1957 Act.\n\n1963 Kennedy civil rights bill\n\n[edit]\n\nIn winning the 1960 United States presidential election, Kennedy took 70% of the African American vote.[14] But due to his somewhat narrow victory and Democrats' narrow majorities in Congress, he was wary to push hard for civil rights legislation for fear of losing southern support.[14] Moreover, according to the Miller Center, he wanted to wait until his second term to send Congress a civil rights bill.[15] But with elevated racial tensions and a wave of African-American protests in the spring of 1963, such as the Birmingham campaign, Kennedy realized he had to act on civil rights.[16][17]\n\nKennedy first proposed the 1964 bill in his Report to the American People on Civil Rights on June 11, 1963.[18] He sought legislation \"giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public—hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments\"—as well as \"greater protection for the right to vote\". In late July, Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, warned that if Congress failed to pass Kennedy's civil rights bill, the country would face another civil war.[19]\n\nEmulating the Civil Rights Act of 1875, Kennedy's civil rights bill included provisions to ban discrimination in public accommodations and enable the U.S. Attorney General to join lawsuits against state governments that operated segregated school systems, among other provisions. But it did not include a number of provisions civil rights leaders deemed essential, including protection against police brutality, ending discrimination in private employment, and granting the Justice Department power to initiate desegregation or job discrimination lawsuits.[20]\n\nLegislative history\n\n[edit]\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 11, 1963, President Kennedy met with Republican leaders to discuss the legislation before his television address to the nation that evening. Two days later, Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield both voiced support for the president's bill, except for provisions guaranteeing equal access to places of public accommodations. This led to several Republican Representatives drafting a compromise bill to be considered. On June 19, the president sent his bill to Congress as it was originally written, saying legislative action was \"imperative\".[21][22] The president's bill went first to the House of Representatives, where it was referred to the Judiciary Committee, chaired by New York Democrat Emanuel Celler. After a series of hearings on the bill, Celler's committee strengthened the act, adding provisions to ban racial discrimination in employment, providing greater protection to black voters, eliminating segregation in all publicly owned facilities (not just schools), and strengthening the anti-segregation clauses regarding public facilities such as lunch counters. They also added authorization for the Attorney General to file lawsuits to protect individuals against the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution or U.S. law. In essence, this was the controversial \"Title III\" that had been removed from the 1957 Act and 1960 Act. Civil rights organizations pressed hard for this provision because it could be used to protect peaceful protesters and black voters from police brutality and suppression of free speech rights.[20]\n\nLobbying efforts\n\n[edit]\n\nLobbying support for the Civil Rights Act was coordinated by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of 70 liberal and labor organizations. The principal lobbyists for the Leadership Conference were civil rights lawyer Joseph L. Rauh Jr. and Clarence Mitchell Jr. of the NAACP.[23]\n\nAfter the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, on August 28, 1963, the organizers visited Kennedy to discuss the civil rights bill.[24] Roy Wilkins, A. Philip Randolph, and Walter Reuther attempted to persuade him to support a provision establishing a Fair Employment Practices Commission that would ban discriminatory practices by all federal agencies, unions, and private companies.[24]\n\nKennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House in late October 1963 to line up the necessary votes in the House for passage.[25] The bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in November 1963 and referred to the Rules Committee, whose chairman, Howard W. Smith, a Democrat and staunch segregationist from Virginia, indicated his intention to keep the bill bottled up indefinitely.\n\nJohnson's appeal to Congress\n\n[edit]\n\nThe assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, changed the political situation. Kennedy's successor as president, Lyndon B. Johnson, made use of his experience in legislative politics, along with the bully pulpit he wielded as president, in support of the bill. In his first address to a joint session of Congress on November 27, 1963, Johnson told the legislators, \"No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.\"[26]\n\nJudiciary Committee chairman Celler filed a petition to discharge the bill from the Rules Committee;[20] it required the support of a majority of House members to move the bill to the floor. Initially, Celler had a difficult time acquiring the signatures necessary, with many Representatives who supported the civil rights bill itself remaining cautious about violating normal House procedure with the rare use of a discharge petition. By the time of the 1963 winter recess, 50 signatures were still needed.\n\nAfter the return of Congress from its winter recess, however, it was apparent that public opinion in the North favored the bill and that the petition would acquire the necessary signatures. To avert the humiliation of a successful discharge petition, Chairman Smith relented and allowed the bill to pass through the Rules Committee.[20]\n\nPassage in the Senate\n\n[edit]\n\nJohnson, who wanted the bill passed as soon as possible, ensured that it would be quickly considered by the Senate.\n\nNormally, the bill would have been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was chaired by James O. Eastland, a Democrat from Mississippi, whose firm opposition made it seem impossible that the bill would reach the Senate floor. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield took a novel approach to prevent the Judiciary Committee from keeping the bill in limbo: initially waiving a second reading immediately after the first reading, which would have sent it to the Judiciary Committee, he took the unprecedented step of giving the bill a second reading on February 26, 1964, thereby bypassing the Judiciary Committee, and sending it to the Senate floor for immediate debate.\n\nWhen the bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the \"Southern Bloc\" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and lone Republican John Tower of Texas, led by Richard Russell (D-GA), launched a filibuster to prevent its passage.[28] Russell proclaimed, \"We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would tend to bring about social equality and intermingling and amalgamation of the races in our [Southern] states.\"[29][30]\n\nStrong opposition to the bill also came from Senator Strom Thurmond, who was still a Democrat at the time: \"This so-called Civil Rights Proposals [sic], which the President has sent to Capitol Hill for enactment into law, are unconstitutional, unnecessary, unwise and extend beyond the realm of reason. This is the worst civil-rights package ever presented to the Congress and is reminiscent of the Reconstruction proposals and actions of the radical Republican Congress.\"[31]\n\nAfter the filibuster had gone on for 54 days, Senators Mansfield, Hubert Humphrey, Everett Dirksen, and Thomas Kuchel introduced a substitute bill that they hoped would overcome it by combining a sufficient number of Republicans as well as core liberal Democrats. The compromise bill was weaker than the House version as to the government's power in regulating the conduct of private business, but not weak enough to make the House reconsider it.[32]\n\nSenator Robert Byrd ended his filibuster in opposition to the bill on the morning of June 10, 1964, after 14 hours and 13 minutes. Up to then, the measure had occupied the Senate for 60 working days, including six Saturdays. The day before, Humphrey, the bill's manager, concluded that he had the 67 votes required at that time to end the debate and the filibuster. With six wavering senators providing a four-vote victory margin, the final tally stood at 71 to 29. Never before in its entire history had the Senate been able to muster enough votes to defeat a filibuster on a civil rights bill, and only once in the 37 years since 1927 had it agreed to cloture for any measure.[33]\n\nThe most dramatic moment during the cloture vote came when Senator Clair Engle (D-CA) was wheeled into the chamber. Suffering from terminal brain cancer, unable to speak, he pointed to his left eye, signifying his affirmative \"Aye\" vote when his name was called. He died seven weeks later.\n\nFinal passage\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 19, the compromise bill passed the Senate by a vote of 73–27, quickly passed through the conference committee, which adopted the Senate version of the bill, then was passed by both houses of Congress and signed into law by Johnson on July 2, 1964.[34]\n\nVote totals\n\n[edit]\n\nSenate vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 June 19, 1964 Party Total votes Democratic Republican Yea 46 27 73 Nay 21 6 27 Result: Passed\n\nRoll call vote[35]\n\nSenator Party State Vote R Vermont Yea R Colorado Yea D New Mexico Yea D Alaska Yea D Indiana Yea R Maryland Yea R Utah Yea D Nevada Yea R Delaware Yea D Maryland Yea D North Dakota Yea D Virginia Nay D West Virginia Nay D Nevada Yea R Kansas Yea R New Jersey Yea D Idaho Yea D Pennsylvania Yea R Kentucky Yea R New Hampshire Nay R Nebraska Yea R Illinois Yea D Connecticut Yea R Colorado Yea D Illinois Yea D Mississippi Nay D Oklahoma Yea D Louisiana Nay D California Yea D North Carolina Nay R Hawaii Yea D Arkansas Nay R Arizona Nay D Tennessee Nay D Alaska Yea D Michigan Yea D Indiana Yea D Arizona Yea R Iowa Nay D Alabama Nay D Florida Nay R Nebraska Yea D Minnesota Yea D Hawaii Yea D Washington Yea R New York Yea D South Carolina Nay R Idaho Yea D North Carolina Nay R New York Yea D Massachusetts Yea R California Yea D Ohio Yea D Louisiana Nay D Missouri Yea D Washington Yea D Montana Yea D Minnesota Yea D Arkansas Nay D Wyoming Yea D South Dakota Yea D New Hampshire Yea D Michigan Yea R New Mexico Nay D Montana Yea R Iowa Yea D Oklahoma Yea D Oregon Yea R Kentucky Yea D Utah Yea R South Dakota Yea D Maine Yea D Wisconsin Yea D Oregon Yea D Rhode Island Yea R Kansas Yea D Rhode Island Yea R Vermont Yea D Wisconsin Yea D West Virginia Yea D Connecticut Yea D Virginia Nay D Georgia Nay R Massachusetts Yea R Pennsylvania Yea R Wyoming Nay D Florida Nay R Maine Yea D Alabama Nay D Mississippi Nay D Missouri Yea D Georgia Nay D South Carolina Nay R Texas Nay D Tennessee Nay R Delaware Yea D New Jersey Yea D Texas Yea R North Dakota Yea D Ohio Yea\n\nTotals are in Yea–Nay format:\n\nOriginal House version: 290–130 (69–31%)[1]\n\nCloture in the Senate: 71–29\n\nSenate version: 73–27[2]\n\nSenate version, as voted on by the House: 289–126 (70–30%)[3]\n\nBy party\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginal House version:[1]\n\nDemocratic Party: 152–96 (61–39%)\n\nRepublican Party: 138–34 (80–20%)\n\nCloture in the Senate:[36]\n\nDemocratic Party: 44–23 (66–34%)\n\nRepublican Party: 27–6 (82–18%)\n\nSenate version:[2]\n\nDemocratic Party: 46–21 (69–31%)\n\nRepublican Party: 27–6 (82–18%)\n\nSenate version, voted on by the House:[3]\n\nDemocratic Party: 153–91 (63–37%)\n\nRepublican Party: 136–35 (80–20%)\n\nBy region\n\n[edit]\n\nNote that \"Southern\", as used here, refers to members of Congress from the 11 states that had made up the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War. \"Northern\" refers to members from the other 39 states, regardless of their geographic location.[37]\n\nHouse of Representatives:[3]\n\nNorthern: 281–32 (90–10%)\n\nSouthern: 8–94 (8–92%)\n\nSenate:[2]\n\nNorthern: 72–6 (92–8%)\n\nSouthern: 1–21 (5–95%) – Ralph Yarborough of Texas was the only Southerner to vote in favor in the Senate\n\nBy party and region\n\n[edit]\n\nHouse of Representatives:[3]\n\nSouthern Democrats: 8–83 (9–91%) – four Representatives from Texas (Jack Brooks, Albert Thomas, J.

Mechem (NM), and Milward Simpson (WY) voted against\n\nAspects\n\n[edit]\n\nWomen's rights\n\n[edit]\n\nOne year earlier, the same Congress had passed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibited wage differentials based on sex. The prohibition on sex discrimination was added to the Civil Rights Act by Howard W. Smith, a powerful Virginia Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee and strongly opposed the legislation. Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133. Historians debate whether Smith cynically attempted to defeat the bill because he opposed civil rights for Black people and women or attempted to support their rights by broadening the bill to include women.[39][40][41][42] Smith expected that Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1944,[43] would probably vote for the amendment. Historians speculate that Smith was trying to embarrass northern Democrats who opposed civil rights for women because labor unions opposed the clause. Representative Carl Elliott of Alabama later said, \"Smith didn't give a damn about women's rights\", as \"he was trying to knock off votes either then or down the line because there was always a hard core of men who didn't favor women's rights\",[44] and according to the Congressional Record, laughter greeted Smith when he introduced the amendment.[45]\n\nSmith asserted that he was not joking and sincerely supported the amendment. Along with Representative Martha Griffiths,[46] he was the amendment's chief spokesperson.[45] For 20 years, Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment (with no linkage to racial issues) in the House because he believed in it. For decades he had been close to the National Woman's Party and its leader Alice Paul, who had been a leading figure in winning the right to vote for women in 1920, co-authored the first Equal Rights Amendment, and had been a chief supporter of equal rights proposals since then. She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category, and felt now was the moment.[47] Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that that was unfair to white women. Black feminist lawyer Pauli Murray wrote a supportive memorandum at the behest of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women.[48] Griffiths also argued that the laws \"protecting\" women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs.[49] The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The final law passed with the votes of Republicans and Northern Democrats. Thus, as Justice William Rehnquist wrote in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, \"The prohibition against discrimination based on sex was added to Title VII at the last minute on the floor of the House of Representatives [...] the bill quickly passed as amended, and we are left with little legislative history to guide us in interpreting the Act's prohibition against discrimination based on 'sex.'\"[50]\n\nDesegregation\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the bill's opponents' most damaging arguments was that once passed, the bill would require forced busing to achieve certain racial quotas in schools.[51] The bill's proponents, such as Emanuel Celler and Jacob Javits, said it would not authorize such measures. Leading sponsor Hubert Humphrey wrote two amendments specifically designed to outlaw busing.[51] Humphrey said, \"if the bill were to compel it, it would be a violation [of the Constitution], because it would be handling the matter on the basis of race and we would be transporting children because of race.\"[51] Javits said any government official who sought to use the bill for busing purposes \"would be making a fool of himself,\" but two years later the Department of Health, Education and Welfare said that Southern school districts would be required to meet mathematical ratios of students by busing.[51]\n\nAftermath\n\n[edit]\n\nPolitical repercussions\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Political realignment\n\nThe bill divided both major American political parties and engendered a long-term change in the demographics of the support for each. President Kennedy realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Both Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Vice President Johnson had pushed for the introduction of the civil rights legislation. Johnson told Kennedy aide Ted Sorensen that \"I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway.\"[52] Senator Richard Russell, Jr. later warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill \"will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election\".[53] Johnson, however, went on to win the 1964 election by one of the biggest landslides in American history. The South, which had five states swing Republican in 1964, became a stronghold of the Republican Party by the 1990s.[54]\n\nAlthough majorities in both parties voted for the bill, there were notable exceptions. Though he opposed forced segregation,[55] Republican 1964 presidential candidate, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, voted against the bill, remarking, \"You can't legislate morality.\" Goldwater had supported previous attempts to pass civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 as well as the 24th Amendment outlawing the poll tax. He stated that the reason for his opposition to the 1964 bill was Title II, which in his opinion violated individual liberty and states' rights. Democrats and Republicans from the Southern states opposed the bill and led an unsuccessful 60 working day filibuster, including Senators Albert Gore, Sr. (D-TN) and J. William Fulbright (D-AR), as well as Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV), who personally filibustered for 14 hours straight.[56]\n\nContinued resistance\n\n[edit]\n\nThere were white business owners who claimed that Congress did not have the constitutional authority to ban segregation in public accommodations. For example, Moreton Rolleston, the owner of a motel in Atlanta, Georgia, said he should not be forced to serve black travelers, saying, \"the fundamental question [...] is whether or not Congress has the power to take away the liberty of an individual to run his business as he sees fit in the selection and choice of his customers\".[57] Rolleston claimed that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a breach of the Fourteenth Amendment and also violated the Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments by depriving him of \"liberty and property without due process\".[57] In Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States (1964), the Supreme Court held that Congress drew its authority from the Constitution's Commerce Clause, rejecting Rolleston's claims.\n\nResistance to the public accommodation clause continued for years on the ground, especially in the South.[58] When local college students in Orangeburg, South Carolina, attempted to desegregate a bowling alley in 1968, they were violently attacked, leading to rioting and what became known as the \"Orangeburg massacre.\"[59] Resistance by school boards continued into the next decade, with the most significant declines in black-white school segregation only occurring at the end of the 1960s and the start of the 1970s in the aftermath of the Green v. County School Board of New Kent County (1968) court decision.[60]\n\nLater impact on LGBT rights\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in three cases (Bostock v. Clayton County, Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which barred employers from discriminating on the basis of sex, precluded employers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.[61] Afterward, USA Today stated that in addition to LGBTQ employment discrimination, \"[t]he court's ruling is likely to have a sweeping impact on federal civil rights laws barring sex discrimination in education, health care, housing and financial credit.\"[62]\n\nTitles\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle I – voting rights\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle I barred unequal application of voter registration requirements. This title did not eliminate literacy tests, which acted as one barrier for black voters, other racial minorities, and poor whites in the South or address economic retaliation, police repression, or physical violence against nonwhite voters. While the Act did require that voting rules and procedures be applied equally to all races, it did not abolish the concept of voter \"qualification\". It accepted the idea that citizens do not have an automatic right to vote but would have to meet standards beyond citizenship.[63][64][65] The Voting Rights Act of 1965 directly addressed and eliminated most voting qualifications beyond citizenship.[63]\n\nTitle II – public accommodations\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle II outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin in hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce; Title II defined \"public accommodations\" as establishments that serve the public. It exempted private clubs, without defining the term \"private\", or other establishments not open to the public.[66]\n\nTitle III – desegregation of public facilities\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle III prohibited state and municipal governments from denying access to public facilities on grounds of race, color, religion, or national origin.\n\nTitle IV – desegregation of public education\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle IV enforced the desegregation of public schools and authorized the U.S. Attorney General to file suits to enforce said act.\n\nTitle V – Commission on Civil Rights\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle V expanded the Civil Rights Commission established by the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1957 with additional powers, rules, and procedures.\n\nTitle VI – nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle VI prevents discrimination by programs and activities that receive federal funds. If a recipient of federal funds is found in violation of Title VI, that recipient may lose its federal funding.\n\nGeneral\n\nThis title declares it to be the policy of the United States that discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin shall not occur in connection with programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance and authorizes and directs the appropriate Federal departments and agencies to take action to carry out this policy. This title is not intended to apply to foreign assistance programs. Section 601 – This section states the general principle that no person in the United States shall be excluded from participation in or otherwise discriminated against on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\n\nSection 602 directs each Federal agency administering a program of Federal financial assistance by way of grant, contract, or loan to take action pursuant to rule, regulation, or order of general applicability to effectuate the principle of section 601 in a manner consistent with the achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the assistance. In seeking the effect compliance with its requirements imposed under this section, an agency is authorized to terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue assistance under a program to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding pursuant to a hearing of a failure to comply with the requirements under that program, and it may also employ any other means authorized by law. However, each agency is directed first to seek compliance with its requirements by voluntary means.\n\nSection 603 provides that any agency action taken pursuant to section 602 shall be subject to such judicial review as would be available for similar actions by that agency on other grounds. Where the agency action consists of terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial assistance because of a finding of a failure of the recipient to comply with the agency's requirements imposed under section 602, and the agency action would not otherwise be subject to judicial review under existing law, judicial review shall nevertheless be available to any person aggrieved as provided in section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 1009). The section also states explicitly that in the latter situation such agency action shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning of section 10. The purpose of this provision is to obviate the possible argument that although section 603 provides for review in accordance with section 10, section 10 itself has an exception for action \"committed to agency discretion,\" which might otherwise be carried over into section 603. It is not the purpose of this provision of section 603, however, otherwise to alter the scope of judicial review as presently provided in section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nExecutive Order\n\nThe December 11, 2019, executive order on combating antisemitism states: \"While Title VI does not cover discrimination based on religion, individuals who face discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin do not lose protection under Title VI for also being a member of a group that shares common religious practices. Discrimination against Jews may give rise to a Title VI violation when the discrimination is based on an individual’s race, color, or national origin. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to enforce Title VI against prohibited forms of discrimination rooted in antisemitism as vigorously as against all other forms of discrimination prohibited by Title VI.\" The order specifies that agencies responsible for Title VI enforcement shall \"consider\" the (non-legally binding) working definition of antisemitism adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) on May 26, 2016, as well as the IHRA list of Contemporary Examples of Anti-Semitism, \"to the extent that any examples might be useful as evidence of discriminatory intent\".[67]\n\nTitle VII – equal employment opportunity\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle VII of the Act, codified as Subchapter VI of Chapter 21 of Title 42 of the United States Code, prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin (see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2[68]). Title VII applies to and covers an employer \"who has fifteen (15) or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year\" as written in the Definitions section under 42 U.S.C. §2000e(b). Title VII also prohibits discrimination against an individual because of their association with another individual of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, such as by an interracial marriage.[69] The EEO Title VII has also been supplemented with legislation prohibiting pregnancy, age, and disability discrimination (see Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, Age Discrimination in Employment Act,[70] Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990).\n\nIn very narrowly defined situations, an employer is permitted to discriminate on the basis of a protected trait if the trait is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. To make a BFOQ defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between the trait and the ability to perform the job; the BFOQ's relation to the \"essence\" or \"central mission of the employer's business\", and that there is no less restrictive or reasonable alternative (United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187 (1991), 111 S. Ct. 1196). BFOQ is an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination based on protected traits (Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321 (1977) 97 S. Ct. 2720). An employer or customer's preference for an individual of a particular religion is not sufficient to establish a BFOQ (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha School – Bishop Estate, 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1993)).[71]\n\nTitle VII allows any employer, labor organization, joint labor-management committee, or employment agency to bypass the \"unlawful employment practice\" for any person involved with the Communist Party of the United States or of any other organization required to register as a Communist-action or Communist-front organization by final order of the Subversive Activities Control Board pursuant to the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950.[72]\n\nThere are partial and whole exceptions to Title VII for four types of employers:\n\nFederal government; (the proscriptions against employment discrimination under Title VII are now applicable to certain federal government offices under 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e-16)\n\nFederally recognized Native American tribes;[73]\n\nReligious groups performing work connected to the group's activities, including associated education institutions;\n\nBona fide nonprofit private membership organizations\n\nThe Bennett Amendment is a U.S. labor law provision in Title VII that limits sex discrimination claims regarding pay to the rules in the Equal Pay Act of 1963. It says an employer can \"differentiate upon the basis of sex\" when it compensates employees \"if such differentiation is authorized by\" the Equal Pay Act.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), as well as certain state fair employment practices agencies (FEPAs), enforce Title VII (see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-4).[68] The EEOC and state FEPAs investigate, mediate, and may file lawsuits on employees' behalf. Where a state law contradicts federal law, it is overridden.[74] Every state except Arkansas and Mississippi maintains a state FEPA (see EEOC and state FEPA directory ). Title VII also provides that an individual can bring a private lawsuit. They must file a complaint of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of learning of the discrimination or they may lose the right to file suit. Title VII applies only to employers who employ 15 or more employees for 20 or more weeks in the current or preceding calendar year (42 U.S.C. § 2000e#b).\n\nAdministrative precedents\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2012, the EEOC ruled that employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity or transgender status is prohibited under Title VII. The decision held that discrimination on the basis of gender identity qualified as discrimination on the basis of sex whether the discrimination was due to sex stereotyping, discomfort with a transition, or discrimination due to a perceived change in the individual's sex.[75][76] In 2014, the EEOC initiated two lawsuits against private companies for discrimination on the basis of gender identity, with additional litigation under consideration.[77] As of November 2014 , Commissioner Chai Feldblum is making an active effort to increase awareness of Title VII remedies for individuals discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.[78][79][needs update]\n\nOn December 15, 2014, under a memorandum issued by Attorney General Eric Holder, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) took a position aligned with the EEOC's, namely that the prohibition of sex discrimination under Title VII encompassed the prohibition of discrimination based on gender identity or transgender status. DOJ had already stopped opposing claims of discrimination brought by federal transgender employees.[80] The EEOC in 2015 reissued another non-binding memo, reaffirming its stance that sexual orientation was protected under Title VII.[81]\n\nIn October 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions withdrew the Holder memorandum.[82] According to a copy of Sessions' directive reviewed by BuzzFeed News, he stated that Title VII should be narrowly interpreted to cover discrimination between \"men and women\". Sessions stated that as a matter of law, \"Title VII does not prohibit discrimination based on gender identity per se.\"[83] Devin O'Malley, on behalf of the DOJ, said, \"the last administration abandoned that fundamental principle [that the Department of Justice cannot expand the law beyond what Congress has provided], which necessitated today's action.\" Sharon McGowan, a lawyer with Lambda Legal who previously served in the Civil Rights division of DOJ, rejected that argument, saying \"[T]his memo is not actually a reflection of the law as it is – it's a reflection of what the DOJ wishes the law were\" and \"The Justice Department is actually getting back in the business of making anti-transgender law in court.\"[82] But the EEOC did not change its stance, putting it at odds with the DOJ in certain cases.[81]\n\nTitle VIII – registration and voting statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle VIII required compilation of voter-registration and voting data in geographic areas specified by the Commission on Civil Rights.\n\nTitle IX – intervention and removal of cases\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the prohibition of sex discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities, see Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.\n\nTitle IX made it easier to move civil rights cases from U.S. state courts to federal court. This was of crucial importance to civil rights activists[who?] who contended that they could not get fair trials in state courts.[citation needed]\n\nTitle X – Community Relations Service\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle X established the Community Relations Service, tasked with assisting in community disputes involving claims of discrimination.\n\nTitle XI – miscellaneous\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle XI gives a defendant accused of certain categories of criminal contempt in a matter arising under title II, III, IV, V, VI, or VII of the Act the right to a jury trial. If convicted, the defendant can be fined an amount not to exceed $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than six months.\n\nMajor amendments\n\n[edit]\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Act of 1972\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween 1965 and 1972, Title VII lacked any strong enforcement provisions. Instead, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was authorized only to investigate external claims of discrimination. The EEOC could then refer cases to the Justice Department for litigation if reasonable cause was found. The EEOC documented the nature and magnitude of discriminatory employment practices, the first study of this kind done.\n\nIn 1972, Congress passed the Equal Employment Opportunity Act.[84] The Act amended Title VII and gave EEOC authority to initiate its own enforcement litigation. The EEOC now played a major role in guiding judicial interpretations of civil rights legislation.[85]\n\nUnited States Supreme Court cases\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle II case law\n\n[edit]\n\nHeart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964)\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, the Supreme Court upheld the law's application to the private sector, on the grounds that Congress has the power to regulate commerce between the States. The landmark case Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States established the law's constitutionality, but did not settle all the legal questions surrounding it.\n\nKatzenbach v.

Martin Marietta Corp., a 1971 Supreme Court case about the Act's gender provisions, the Court ruled that a company could not discriminate against a potential female employee because she had a preschool-age child unless it did the same with potential male employees.[42] A federal court overruled an Ohio state law that barred women from obtaining jobs that required the ability to lift 25 pounds and required women but not men to take lunch breaks.[42] In Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations, the Supreme Court decided that printing separate job listings for men and women is illegal, ending that practice at the country's newspapers. The United States Civil Service Commission ended the practice of designating federal jobs \"women only\" or \"men only.\"[42]\n\nWashington v. Davis (1976)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Washington v.

White (2006)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 22, 2006, in Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, the Supreme Court held that White's reassignment to from forklift operator to less desirable duties as a track laborer as well as her suspension without pay after complaining about workplace sexual harassment constituted retaliatory discrimination.[88] This was a landmark case because it clarified that Title VII’s retaliation provision is not confined to harmful acts occurring at the workplace or are related to employment.[89] Title VII’s anti-discrimination provision prevents actions including a hire, a discharge, a change in compensation, conditions, privileges, opportunities, or status of employment.[90] However, Title VII’s retaliation provision contains no such limiting language.[91] The definition of retaliation against a complainant of sexual harassment was changed to encompass any unfavorable job decision or treatment that might deter a \"reasonable worker\" from filing a discrimination claim or from supporting one.[91]\n\nLedbetter v.

Clayton County, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 that Title VII protections against workplace discrimination on the basis of sex apply to discrimination against LGBT individuals.[92] In the opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that a business that discriminates against homosexual or transgender individuals is discriminating \"for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex.\" Thus discrimination against homosexual and transgender employees is a form of sex discrimination, which is forbidden under Title VII.[93]\n\nBostock was consolidated with Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda.[94] Before the Supreme Court's intervention, there was a split in the circuit courts, including these two cases[95][96] as well as Evans v. Georgia Regional Hospital in the Eleventh Circuit.[97]\n\nR.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2020)\n\n[edit]\n\nR.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission determined that Title VII covers gender identity, including transgender status.[95][94]\n\nGroff v. DeJoy (2023)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Groff v. DeJoy\n\nInfluence\n\n[edit]\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990—which has been called \"the most important piece of federal legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964\"—was influenced both by the structure and substance of the previous Civil Rights Act of 1964. The act was arguably of equal importance, and \"draws substantially from the structure of that landmark legislation [Civil Rights Act of 1964]\". The Americans with Disabilities Act paralleled its landmark predecessor structurally, drawing upon many of the same titles and statutes. For example, \"Title I of the ADA, which bans employment discrimination by private employers on the basis of disability, parallels Title VII of the Act\". Similarly, Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \"which proscribes discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations, tracks Title II of the 1964 Act while expanding upon the list of public accommodations covered.\" The Americans with Disabilities Act extended \"the principle of nondiscrimination to people with disabilities\",[98] an idea unsought in the United States before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Act also influenced later civil rights legislation, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968, aiding not only African Americans, but also women.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAffirmative action in the United States\n\nAngelita C. et al. v.
