        "text": "Township in Burlington County, New Jersey, US\n\nFor the township in Warren County, see Mansfield Township, Warren County, New Jersey.\n\nTownship in New Jersey, United States\n\nMansfield Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 8,897,[8][9] an increase of 353 (+4.1%) from the 2010 census count of 8,544,[17][18] which in turn reflected an increase of 3,454 (+67.9%) from the 5,090 counted in the 2000 census.[19] The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.[20]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore European settlement, the land that would become Mansfield Township was occupied by the Lenape Native Americans. Mansfield was first formed on November 6, 1688, and reformed by Royal charter on May 9, 1770. Mansfield was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships. Portions of the township were taken to form Fieldsboro (March 7, 1850, within township; became fully independent c. 1894), Bordentown Township (March 8, 1852) and Florence Township (March 7, 1872).[21]\n\nThe township was named for Mansfield, England.[22][23]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 21.89 square miles (56.69 km2), including 21.73 square miles (56.29 km2) of land and 0.16 square miles (0.40 km2) of water (0.71%).[1][2]\n\nThe township borders the Burlington County municipalities of Bordentown Township (to the north and northeast), Chesterfield Township (northeast), Florence Township (southwest) and Springfield Township (south).[24][25][26][27]\n\nUnincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Bishops Barn, Columbus (where the town hall is located), Georgetown, Hedding, Kinkora, Mansfield, Rising Sun Square (also known as Mansfield Square) and Three Tuns.[28][29] Homestead, a retirement village, consists of 1,200 homes in Columbus.\n\nLiberty Lake is a 6-acre (24,000 m2) freshwater spring-fed lake, that allows boating, swimming and fishing.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18101,810—18201,9276.5%18302,0838.1%18402,40115.3%18502,95323.0%18602,777*−6.0%18702,8803.7%18801,648*−42.8%18901,6711.4%19001,518*−9.2%19101,5260.5%19201,517−0.6%19301,70912.7%19401,642−3.9%19501,90716.1%19602,0849.3%19702,59724.6%19802,523−2.8%19903,87453.5%20005,09031.4%20108,54467.9%20208,8974.1%2023 (est.)8,991[8][10]1.1%\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2010 United States census counted 8,544 people, 3,401 households, and 2,452 families in the township. The population density was 393.0 per square mile (151.7/km2). There were 3,529 housing units at an average density of 162.3 per square mile (62.7/km2). The racial makeup was 79.04% (6,753) White, 10.42% (890) Black or African American, 0.16% (14) Native American, 7.69% (657) Asian, 0.06% (5) Pacific Islander, 0.62% (53) from other races, and 2.01% (172) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.01% (428) of the population.[17]\n\nOf the 3,401 households, 25.6% had children under the age of 18; 63.5% were married couples living together; 6.2% had a female householder with no husband present and 27.9% were non-families. Of all households, 24.8% were made up of individuals and 16.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The median age was 48.9 years. For every 100 females, the population had 90.3 males. For every 100 females ages 18 and older there were 86.0 males.[17]\n\nThe Census Bureau's 2006–2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income was $74,671 (with a margin of error of +/− $7,953) and the median family income was $97,774 (+/− $17,454). Males had a median income of $62,215 (+/− $5,997) versus $57,917 (+/− $10,212) for females. The per capita income for the borough was $38,899 (+/− $4,224). About 2.5% of families and 2.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.6% of those under age 18 and 3.6% of those age 65 or over.[41]\n\n2000 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2000 United States census[14] there were 5,090 people, 2,077 households, and 1,561 families residing in the township. The population density was 234.3 inhabitants per square mile (90.5/km2). There were 2,122 housing units at an average density of 97.7 per square mile (37.7/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 95.42% White, 1.91% African American, 0.18% Native American, 1.49% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.22% from other races, and 0.75% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.83% of the population.[39][40]\n\nThere were 2,077 households, out of which 23.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 68.4% were married couples living together, 4.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.8% were non-families. 22.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 2.86.[39][40]\n\nIn the township the population was spread out, with 18.7% under the age of 18, 4.9% from 18 to 24, 21.4% from 25 to 44, 23.1% from 45 to 64, and 31.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 49 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.[39][40]\n\nThe median income for a household in the township was $50,757, and the median income for a family was $59,040. Males had a median income of $45,560 versus $40,968 for females. The per capita income for the township was $26,559. About 2.9% of families and 4.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.9% of those under age 18 and 4.3% of those age 65 or over.[39][40]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal government\n\n[edit]\n\nMansfield Township is governed under the Township form of government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government.[42] The Township Committee is comprised of five members who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle.[6][43] At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor. Legislative and executive powers of the township are exercised by the Township Committee as a whole, with the mayor presiding over meetings and voting as a member of the committee.[3]\n\nAs of 2024 , members of the Mansfield Township Committee are Mayor Marcial Mojena (R, term on committee ends December 31, 2024; term as mayor ends 2024), Deputy Mayor Brian Sisz (R, 2024), Tim Boyd (R, 2025), Valerie Jennings (R, 2026), and Kelly Stobie (R, 2026).[3][44][45][46][47]\n\nLocal elections\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2020, independent candidates Dan Golenda and Bob Tallon ran a successful write-in campaign against incumbent Republicans Janice DiGiuseppe and her running mate Efthimios \"Paul\" Tsiknakis, winning 4,812 total votes versus 4,262.[47] This was in response to a public outcry of Mansfield losing an affordable housing litigation suit, and the then-committee voting several actively-farmed parcels as \"redevelopment\" to cover financial issues in the township, which started a warehousing boom in the community. The following year 2021, Marcial Mojena (R) and Paul 'Brian' Sisz (R) ran a similarly successful \"No More Warehouses\" campaign.[46] In 2022, the committee adopted an ordinance to remove warehousing as a permitted use in all zones of the township, until the impact from the currently approved warehouses in the township could be evaluated.[48]\n\nJanice A. DiGiuseppe resigned in August 2015, citing personal reasons for leaving office after five years.[49] The following month, the council selected Laverne Cholewa from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the vacancy.[50] In November 2015, Cholewa was elected to serve the two years remaining on the term of office previously held by DiGiuseppe.[51]\n\nIn 2023, Republicans Valerie Jennings and Kelly Stobie were elected, returning the Township Committee to 5-0 Republican control.\n\n2013 revaluation issues\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter a property revaluation was completed in 2013 and based on changes in tax levies by the municipality and the local school districts, the property tax rate increased by almost 50%, from $2.01 per $100 in assessed value in 2012 to $2.93 in 2013. A group of residents has complained to the New Jersey Division of Taxation, claiming that home values had been calculated incorrectly and arbitrarily, showing data that a sample of smaller homes saw taxes drop 8% while taxes on larger homes increased by 10%. The Mansfield Township tax assessor denied the claims and responded that the revaluation complied with all state legal requirements.[52]\n\nFederal, state and county representation\n\n[edit]\n\nMansfield Township is located in the 3rd Congressional District[53] and is part of New Jersey's 8th state legislative district.[54][55][56]\n\nFor the 118th United States Congress, New Jersey's 3rd congressional district is represented by Andy Kim (D, Moorestown).[57] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker (Newark, term ends 2027)[58] and Bob Menendez (Englewood Cliffs, term ends 2025).[59][60]\n\nFor the 2024-2025 session, the 8th legislative district of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the New Jersey Senate by Latham Tiver (R, Southampton Township) and in the General Assembly by Andrea Katz (D, Chesterfield Township) and Michael Torrissi (R, Hammonton).[61]\n\nBurlington County is governed by a Board of County Commissioners composed of five members who are chosen at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year; at an annual reorganization meeting, the board selects a director and deputy director from among its members to serve a one-year term.[62] As of 2024 , Burlington County's Commissioners are: Director Felicia Hopson (D, Willingboro Township, 2024),[63] Tom Pullion (D, Edgewater Park, 2026),[64] Allison Eckel (D, Medford, 2025),[65] Deputy Director Daniel J. O'Connell (D, Delran Township, 2024)[66] and Balvir Singh (D, Burlington Township, 2026).[67][62][68][69][70][71]\n\nBurlington County's Constitutional Officers are: Clerk Joanne Schwartz (D, Southampton Township, 2028)[72][73] Sheriff James H. Kostoplis (D, Bordentown, 2025)[74][75] and Surrogate Brian J. Carlin (D, Burlington Township, 2026).[76][77]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of March 2011, there were a total of 6,195 registered voters in Mansfield Township, of which 1,838 (29.7% vs. 33.3% countywide) were registered as Democrats, 1,957 (31.6% vs. 23.9%) were registered as Republicans and 2,396 (38.7% vs. 42.8%) were registered as Unaffiliated.
