        "text": "Tom Burlinson has confirmed that it was definitely him who rode the horse down the side of the mountain for the \"terrible descent\" during the dangerous rideâ€”commenting that he had been asked about this numerous times, and that he became known as \"The Man from Snowy River\" because of his ride. Burlinson had ridden a horse only a few times before being cast in the film. He was taught to ride by mountain cattleman Charlie Lovick, who owned the buckskin horse Burlinson rode in the film. Gerald Egan doubled for Burlinson for several riding shots in the film, including the jump into the \"terrible descent\". Other moments in the film such as when Jim is thrown over the fence into the path of the brumbies were performed by professional stunt men. Nevertheless, Burlinson did much more of the action riding in the film than an actor normally would, including all the profile shots of the downhill ride."
