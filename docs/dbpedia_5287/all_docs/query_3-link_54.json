        "text": "WASHINGTON — Joseph R. Biden III, the former attorney general of Delaware and the elder son of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., died on Saturday in Bethesda, Md. He was 46.\n\nThe cause was brain cancer, his father said.\n\nMr. Biden had spent more than a week receiving treatment at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he died.\n\nIn a statement Saturday night, the vice president said, “It is with broken hearts that Hallie, Hunter, Ashley, Jill and I announce the passing of our husband, brother and son, Beau, after he battled brain cancer with the same integrity, courage and strength he demonstrated every day of his life.”\n\nThe statement went on to say, “In the words of the Biden family: Beau Biden was, quite simply, the finest man any of us have ever known.”\n\nIn 2010, the younger Mr. Biden, known as Beau, had suffered what officials described as a mild stroke. Three years later, he was admitted to the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston after what White House officials described at the time as “an episode of disorientation and weakness.”\n\nOfficials said in 2013 that the doctors in Texas had removed a small lesion from his brain.\n\nMr. Biden’s death is a second tragic loss for the vice president, whose first wife, Neilia, and 13-month-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car accident in 1972 when the station wagon they were driving in to go Christmas shopping was hit by a tractor-trailer. Beau Biden and his brother, Hunter, were also injured in the crash, but both survived.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
