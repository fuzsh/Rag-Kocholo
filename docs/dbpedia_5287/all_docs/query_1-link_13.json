The standard of quality for good articles is less than that for featured articles. Here is the complete list of good article nominations: there are currently 619 nominations listed, of which 525 are waiting to be reviewed.\n\nAny significant contributor to an article may nominate it, and any uninvolved and registered user with sufficient knowledge and experience with Wikipedia may review the nominated article against the good article criteria. A responsive nominator and reviewer can complete a review in about seven days. Nominators should respond positively to constructive criticism and work with the reviewer to improve the article (if there are any issues) to good article status. If the article is promoted, a small plus sign inside a circle ( ) will appear on the top right corner of the article's page indicating that the article is good.\n\nTo nominate or review an article, follow the instructions. Similarly, to delist an article which no longer meets the good article criteria, follow the instructions for reassessment.\n\nATTENTION NEW NOMINATORS AND REVIEWERS: PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS PAGE.\n\nThis page has a backlog that requires the attention of willing reviewers.
