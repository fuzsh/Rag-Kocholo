        "text": "“Let us do nothing by halves. If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire from beginning to end; so as it be a German play …” (Ch. 13)\n\nLovers’ Vows is a play by Elizabeth Inchbald. She adapted it from the German play Das Kind der Liebe (literally “Child of Love” or “Love Child”) by August von Kotzebue. It was first performed in 1798 at Covent Garden and was successful, though some considered it too risqué.\n\nThe story begins with Agatha being thrown out of an inn because she can no longer pay. A soldier comes across her and gives her the very little money he has. Agatha recognizes him as her son Frederick, who has been away in the army for five years. He has come for his birth certificate which he finds he needs to gain employment. Sorrowfully, Agatha tells him that he has no birth certificate, for he is illegitimate. She tells him how she was seduced by the Baron Wildenhaim. Instead of fulfilling his promise to marry her, the Baron marries another woman. Agatha was turned out of her home and struggled to bring up her son on her own. Frederick leaves his mother with some generous Cottagers and goes to beg for money. Coming across a hunting party, he begs of them and, not receiving enough money for his mother’s wants, draws his sword and attempts to rob one of them and gets arrested.\n\nThe man Frederick attempted to rob was Baron Wildenhaim. He is trying to get his daughter Amelia to marry Count Cassel, a stupid, dissolute man. The Baron asks Amelia’s tutor Anhalt, a chaplain, to discuss marriage with her. Unknown to him, however, Anhalt and Amelia are in love. Amelia takes the opportunity to force a declaration of love from Anhalt. They are interrupted by the “rhyming Butler” who tells them in verse of Frederick’s arrest. The Baron insists that Frederick must be punished as an example, but Amelia takes pity on him and brings him “a basket of provisions”. From her, Frederick learns the identity of the man he attempted to rob and requests a private interview with the Baron.\n\nAmelia has learned of Count Cassel’s dissolute behaviour and reveals it to her father who confronts him. The Count readily admits to having made promises of marriage to other women and points out that “if every man, who deserves to have a charge such as this brought against him, was not permitted to look up—; it is a doubt whom we might not meet crawling on all fours”. Reminded of his own behaviour to Agatha, the Baron is embarrassed. Amelia tells her father of her love for Anhalt. Anhalt tells the Baron of Fredericks wish for an interview. Frederick reveals his relationship to the Baron and then leaves. Anhalt goes to Agatha and explains how the Baron came to marry another woman. Persuaded by Anhalt, the Baron agrees that he must marry Agatha despite her low social position. He also allows Anhalt and Amelia to marry, despite Anhalt’s poverty. Everyone is reconciled.\n\nIn Mansfield Park, the characters were cast as follows:\n\nBaron Wildenhaim … John Yates\n\nCount Cassel … James Rushworth\n\nAnhalt … Edmund Bertram\n\nFrederick … Henry Crawford\n\nVerdun the Butler … Tom Bertram\n\nAgatha Friburg … Maria Bertram\n\nAmelia Wildenhaim … Mary Crawford\n\nCottager’s Wife … Mrs. Grant\n\nElizabeth Inchbald lived from 1753 to 1821. She was an English actress, playwright, and novelist. She was born Elizabeth Simpson, one of the nine children of John and Mary Simpson. The family was Roman Catholic. Elizabeth’s brother George became an actor in 1770, and when she was 19 she went to London to act. In 1772, she married the actor Joseph Inchbald. They travelled with a theatre company. After her husband’s death in 1779, Elizabeth continued to act. She wrote many plays, including Lovers’ Vows, and two novels. She quarreled with Mary Wollstonecraft in 1797 when it was discovered that Mary had not been married to her daughter Fanny’s father. Elizabeth died in August 1821 in Kensington.\n\nAugust von Kotzebue had a rather dramatic life (pun intended). He was a German dramatist and writer and lived from 1761 to 1819. He also worked as a consul in Russia and Germany. As a young man he studied legal science. After graduating in 1780, he practiced law in Weimer. He then became secretary to a Governor General in Russia. He married the daughter of a Russian lieutenant general in 1783. His first literary works were well received. His first wife died in 1790 and Kotzebue left Russia. He was appointed dramatist to the court theatre in Vienna in 1798, but the position did not last long. He returned to Germany, but had troubles there due to disagreements with Goethe as he had attacked the romantic style which Goethe was known for. In 1800 he tried to return to Saint Petersburg, but was arrested on suspicion of being a Jacobin and was transported to Siberia. He was rescued by Tsar Paul I of Russia and was appointed director of the German theatre in Saint Petersburn. After the Tsar’s assassination, Kotzebue returned to Germany. After Napoleon’s victory in 1806, he fled back to Russia. Beethoven suggested that Kotzebue write libretto for an opera, which never ended up being written. However Beethoven composed music for two of Kotzebue’s plays. His famous “Turkish March” was originally written for Kotzebue’s play Ruin of Athens. Eventually he returned to German as consul general for Russia. He was disliked by nationalist liberals due to his writings against Germans who wanted free institutions. On March 18, 1819, soon after moving to Mannheim with his family (he had eighteen children), he was murdered in his own home by one of the national liberalists, Karl Ludwig Sand.\n\nFor part of my “Literary Allusions” series, where I have collected various literary allusions from Mansfield Park, I wrote a post on “Dr. Johnson’s Celebrated Judgment”. In it, I included a link to a page with the definition of the word “nice” from Johnson’s dictionary, for “those who are as curious as I was as to what [his] definition” was. As the page that I linked to is down, I have decided to repost that definition here.\n\n_______________________________\n\nIn Northanger Abbey, Miss Tilney refers to Johnson’s Dictionary:\n\n“But now really, do not you think Udolpho the nicest book in the world?” [said Catherine]\n\n“The nicest—by which I suppose you mean the neatest. That must depend upon the binding.”\n\n“Henry,” said Miss Tilney, “you are very impertinent. Miss Morland, he is treating you exactly as he does his sister. He is forever finding fault with me, for some incorrectness of language, and now he is taking the same liberty with you. The word ‘nicest,’ as you used it, did not suit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way.”\n\n“I am sure,” cried Catherine, “I did not mean to say anything wrong; but it is a nice book, and why should not I call it so?”\n\n“Very true,” said Henry, “and this is a very nice day, and we are taking a very nice walk, and you are two very nice young ladies. Oh! It is a very nice word indeed! It does for everything. Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness, propriety, delicacy, or refinement—people were nice in their dress, in their sentiments, or their choice. But now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word.”\n\n“While, in fact,” cried his sister, “it ought only to be applied to you, without any commendation at all. You are more nice than wise. Come, Miss Morland, let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction, while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms we like best.” (Northanger Abbey, Chapter XIV).\n\nThe definition of “nice” and its forms “nicely”, “niceness”, and “nicety” fill more than an entire column of Johnson’s Dictionary—no small accomplishment, considering that a column is nothing short of 13-1/2 inches long, not including the margin. For those who are as curious as I was as to what Johnson’s definition of “nice” is, here it is, complete with all of the quotations:\n\nNICE. adj. [ne_e, Saxon, soft.]\n\n1. Accurate in judgment to minute exactness; superfluously exact. It is often used to express a culpable delicacy.\n\nSuch a man was Argalus, as hardly the nicest eye can find a spot in.

I updated some of the text, dropping the long “s” (ſ), etc.\n\nAll images in this post are publicity shots from the 2007 adaptation of ‘Northanger Abbey’ with Felicity Jones as Catherine Morland and J. J. Feild as Henry Tilney. I used these pictures, despite the fact that the delightful scene quoted above was completely eliminated from that adaptation. I obtained the images from Period Films.\n\nIn chapter 30 of Mansfield Park, Henry Crawford tells his sister, Mary, of his intention of marrying Fanny Price.\n\n“Yes, Mary,” was Henry’s concluding assurance. “I am fairly caught. You know with what idle designs I began; but this is the end of them. I have, I flatter myself, made no inconsiderable progress in her affections; but my own are entirely fixed.”\n\n“Lucky, lucky girl!” cried Mary, as soon as she could speak; “what a match for her! My dearest Henry, this must be my first feeling; but my second, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your choice from my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it. You will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude and devotion. Exactly what you deserve. What an amazing match for her! Mrs. Norris often talks of her luck; what will she say now? The delight of all the family, indeed! And she has some true friends in it! How they will rejoice! But tell me all about it! Talk to me for ever. When did you begin to think seriously about her?”\n\nNothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question, though nothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked. “How the pleasing plague had stolen on him” he could not say … (Mansfield Park, Ch. XXX)\n\nMr. Crawford is quoting the last line of the first verse of this poem by William Whitehead:\n\nThe Je Ne Scai Quoi. 1\n\nA Song.\n\nYes, I’m in love, I feel it now, And Cælia has undone me; And yet I’ll swear I can’t tell how The pleasing plague stole on me. ‘Tis not her face which love creates, For there no Graces revel; ‘Tis not her shape, for there the Fates Have rather been uncivil. ‘Tis not her air, for sure in that There’s nothing more than common; And all her sense is only chat, Like any other woman.Her voice, her touch might give th’ alarm— ‘Twas both perhaps, or neither; In short, ’twas that provoking charm Of Cælia altogether.\n\nThis charming little poem is by the little-known poet and playwright William Whitehead (1715 – April 14, 1785). He is probably best remembered now for his comedy School for Lovers. William Whitehead was born in 1715 (he was baptized on February 12, 1715) in Cambridge, the second son of a baker. His father was a spendthrift, who spent much time and money on a piece of land which came to be known as Whitehead’s Folly. He left debts behind him when he died, which William paid off. Through the patronage of Henry Bromley, at the age of fourteen he went to Winchester College. In 1735, he entered Clare College, Cambridge on a scholarship and as a sizer.2 He became a fellow of Clare Hall in 1742. While there he wrote “The Danger of Writing Verse” (first printed in the year 1741), as well as some other poems, including Ann Boleyn to Henry the Eighth (1743), and Essay on Ridicule (1743).\n\nIn 1745, Whitehead became tutor to the Viscount Villiers, the son of the Earl of Jersey, and began living in London. There he wrote two tragedies: The Roman Father (1750, based on Corneille’s Horace) and Creusa, Queen of Athens (1754, based on Ion of Euripides). The Roman Father was well-received and probably the work he was best known for in his day. In June 1754 he went abroad with Viscount Villiers and Viscount Nuneham (son to Earl Harcourt) as tutor to both young men. They travelled in France, Germany, and Italy, returning to England in the autumn of 1765.\n\nSometime ca. 1755, due to the interest of Lady Jersey, Whitehead was made secretary and registrar of the Order of the Bath.3 In 1757, after Thomas Gray (author of ‘Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard’, a poem which contains the lines Full many a flow’r is born to blush unseen, / And waste its sweetness on the desert air, stanza 14, lines 55-56, and Far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife, stanza 19, line 73) refused the position, Whitehead was offered and accepted the position of Poet Laureate.4 While Poet Laureate, he wrote the humorous poem “A Pathetic Apology for all Laureates, past, present, and to come”. Unfortunately, upon becoming Poet Laureate, Whitehead was subjected to much criticism, especially from Charles Churchill, who did much damage to Whitehead’s poetical character. In 1762, in the third book of The Ghost, Churchill described Whitehead as “the heir of Dullness and Method”.\n\nIn 1762, Whitehead wrote a successful comedy, the School for Lovers. It was well-received, but his reputation continued to go downhill. Whitehead made no reply to his critics, and even wrote verses complimenting Churchill. In 1770, Whitehead’s farce The Trip to Scotland was performed, but, due to the contempt he was held in, only on condition that its author be concealed. The play was well-received by the public. Also applauded was his poem “Variety”, which he published anonymously due to his poor reputation. Other works by Whitehead include a burlesque poem The Sweepers, the poem “The Goat’s Beard”, &c. In his Specimens of the British Poets, Vol. VII, Thomas Campbell wrote that Whitehead “certainly wrote too many insipid things; but a tolerable selection might be made from his works, that would discover his talents to be no legitimate object of contempt”.5\n\nAfter his return to England, Whitehead continued to live with his patrons on the invitation of Lord Jersey, but from 1769 until his death he lived in London. In 1774, he collected his Plays and Poems, which were published in two volumes. Thomas Campbell writes that his “health began to decline about his seventieth year, and in 1785 he was carried off by a complaint in his chest. His death was sudden, and his peaceable life was closed without a groan.” 6\n\nFor further reading:\n\nGoogle Books has available for free Whitefield’s School for Lovers, Creusa, Queen of Athens, a volume of some of his poems (containing also The Roman Father), and other works by him. They also have volume vii of Thomas Campbell’s Specimens of the British Poets, of which pages 1-29 are devoted to a short biography of William Whitehead (one of the sources which I used in writing this article), as well as his poem “Variety: A Tale for Married People” and an excerpt from his tragedy of Creusa.\n\nSeveral websites were useful to me in compiling this post. The Wikipedia article on William Whitehead includes the text of The Je Ne Scai Quoi. English Poetry 1579-1830 has some good information on William Whitehead, as well as the text to several of his poems.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1 The title of this little poem is French and translates as “The I don’t know what”. Je ne sais quoi [ˌ zh ə nə sā ˈkwä] is a French phrase, literally translated as “I don’t know what”, used to describe that certain, undefinable something, “an intangible quality”, the “I don’t know what it is” that “makes something or someone distinctive or attractive” (see Wiktionary on the phrase). For those who are interested, the French verb “to know” is savoir, the first person present indicative form of which is sais—ju sais = “I know”. Obviously the word in the title of the poem differs from the current French word. Apparently the verb savoir used to be spelled sçavoir, with sçai or sçay being the je form. This was changed in the 19th century. (See this page on the poem.)\n\n2 A student who receives assistance in return for performing certain duties.\n\n3 The Most Honourable Order of the Bath is a British order of chivalry found in 1725 by King George I. (For more information see http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Order_of_the_Bath and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath.)\n\n4 In Britain, a poet laureate is the title of a poet appointed by the monarch. For more information see the Wikipedia article. William Whitehead was Poet Laureate 1757-1785. He was preceded in the position by Colley Cibber, and succeeded by Thomas Warton. Some well-know poets were Poets Laureate of Great Britain, including Alfred, Lord Tennyson, who held the position 1850-1892. A list of past poets laureate can be found here.\n\n5 Thomas Campbell, Specimens of the British Poets, Vol. VII (London: Printed by Thomas Davison, Whitefriars, 1819), pp. 11-12.\n\n6 Ibid., p. 12.\n\nThe illustrations in this post are of, first, Mr. Crawford and Miss Crawford, played by Robert Burbage and Jackie Smith-Wood in the 1983 version of ‘Mansfield Park’, second, William Whitehead, an engraving by William Ensom, and, third, William Whitehead, a painting by Benjamin Wilson. The two latter portraits can be found here on the online National Portrait Gallery.\n\nThe living in incessant noise was, to a frame and temper delicate and nervous like Fanny’s, an evil which no superadded elegance or harmony could have entirely atoned for. It was the greatest misery of all. At Mansfield, no sounds of contention, no raised voice, no abrupt bursts, no tread of violence, was ever heard; all proceeded in a regular course of cheerful orderliness; everybody had their due importance; everybody’s feelings were consulted. If tenderness could be ever supposed wanting, good sense and good breeding supplied its place; and as to the little irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris, they were short, they were trifling, they were as a drop of water to the ocean, compared with the ceaseless tumult of her present abode. Here everybody was noisy, every voice was loud (excepting, perhaps, her mother’s, which resembled the soft monotony of Lady Bertram’s, only worn into fretfulness). Whatever was wanted was hallooed for, and the servants hallooed out their excuses from the kitchen. The doors were in constant banging, the stairs were never at rest, nothing was done without a clatter, nobody sat still, and nobody could command attention when they spoke.\n\nIn a review of the two houses, as they appeared to her before the end of a week, Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson’s celebrated judgment as to matrimony and celibacy, and say, that though Mansfield Park might have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures.\n\n(Mansfield Park, Chapter XXXIX)\n\nThe reference here is to a sentence in Dr. Johnson’s book The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia. Towards the end of chapter 26, it is written, “Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures.” Johnson wrote Rasselas in one week. He began writing it when he heard, on January 13, 1759, that his mother was seriously ill, so as to be able to meet her expenses. She died, however, on January 23, just as he was finishing it, so the money paid for her funeral and covered some debts that she had left. The work was immediately popular. By 1764, it had been translated into French, Dutch, German, Russian, and Italian, and was eventually traslated into many other languages.1\n\nIn addition to being referred to in Mansfield Park, Rasselas is alluded to in many other works of fiction, including Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë, The House of the Seven Gables by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell, Middlemarch by George Eliot, and Little Women by Louisa May Alcott.\n\nBesides his Rasselas, Jane Austen also refers to Johnson’s Idler in Mansfield Park:\n\n“I shall walk down immediately after breakfast,” said he [Edmund], “and am sure of giving pleasure there. And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt you any longer. You want to be reading. But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you, and come to a decision. Sleeping or waking, my head has been full of this matter all night. It is an evil, but I am certainly making it less than it might be. If Tom is up, I shall go to him directly and get it over, and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good-humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity. You, in the meanwhile, will be taking a trip into China, I suppose. How does Lord Macartney go on?”—opening a volume on the table and then taking up some others. “And here are Crabbe’s Tales, and the Idler, at hand to relieve you, if you tire of your great book. I admire your little establishment exceedingly; and as soon as I am gone, you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting, and sit comfortably down to your table. But do not stay here to be cold.” (Chapter XVI).\n\nIn Northanger Abbey, Miss Tilney refers to Johnson’s Dictionary:\n\n“Henry,” said Miss Tilney, “you are very impertinent. Miss Morland, he is treating you exactly as he does his sister. He is forever finding fault with me, for some incorrectness of language, and now he is taking the same liberty with you. The word ‘nicest,’ as you used it, did not suit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way.”\n\n“I am sure,” cried Catherine, “I did not mean to say anything wrong; but it is a nice book, and why should not I call it so?”\n\n“Very true,” said Henry, “and this is a very nice day, and we are taking a very nice walk, and you are two very nice young ladies. Oh! It is a very nice word indeed! It does for everything. Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness, propriety, delicacy, or refinement—people were nice in their dress, in their sentiments, or their choice. But now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word.”\n\n“While, in fact,” cried his sister, “it ought only to be applied to you, without any commendation at all. You are more nice than wise. Come, Miss Morland, let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction, while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms we like best.” (Northanger Abbey, Chapter XIV).\n\nFor those who are as curious as I was as to what Johnson’s definition of “nice” is, I have posted it here, as it is too long to include in this post. The definition of “nice” and its forms “nicely”, “niceness”, and “nicety” fill an entire column’s worth (and then some!) of Johnson’s dictionary—no small accomplishment, considering that a column is nothing short of 13-1/2 inches long, not including the margin.\n\nDr. Johnson was said to be one of Jane Austen’s favorite authors, and one that had a great influence on her own writing. In his A Memoir of Jane Austen, James Edward Austen-Leigh wrote: “Amongst her favourite writers, Johnson in prose, Crabbe in verse, and Cowper in both, stood high. It is well that the native good taste of herself and of those with whom she lived, saved her from the snare into which a sister novelist had fallen, of imitating the grandiloquent style of Johnson.” (Chapter V). Jane Austen herself wrote to her sister Cassandra, “There, I flatter myself I have constructed you a smartish letter, considering my want of materials, but, like my dear Dr. Johnson, I believe I have dealt more in notions than facts.” (February 8, 1807). In a poem she wrote, ‘To the Memory of Mrs. Lefroy’, Jane Austen refers to Dr. Johnson as “the first of Men”:\n\nAt Johnson’s death by Hamilton ’twas said,\n\n‘Seek we a substitute – Ah! vain the plan,\n\nNo second best remains to Johnson dead—\n\nNone can remind us even of the Man.’\n\nSo we of thee – unequall’d in thy race\n\nUnequall’d thou, as he the first of Men.\n\nVainly we search around the vacant place,\n\nWe ne’er may look upon thy like again.\n\nWhen Jane Austen’s brother James began, in January 1789, his own weekly magazine, he called it The Loiterer. Claire Tomalin comments in her Jane Austen: A Life, The Loiterer “was modelled on Dr. Johnson’s great periodicals, the Rambler and the Idler, each number consisting of a single anonymous essay or story.” 2\n\nSamuel Johnson, an English author, lived from September 18, 1709 to December 13, 1784. He wrote, among other things, A Dictionary of the English Language, Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets, and, of course, The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia. Besides his other books, he also wrote various essays (The Idler was a series of 103 essays, 91 of which were written by Johnson), pamphlets, sermons, poetry, periodicals, biographies, criticism, and a play.\n\nHe was born to a bookseller, Michael Johnson, and his wife, Sarah Ford. Very soon he contracted scrofula (a form of tuberculosis that affects the lymph nodes of the neck). An operation was performed on him, which left him with permanent scars on his face and body. While still a young boy, he began exhibiting tics, which affected him the rest of his life. His mother’s cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728, leaving the Johnsons enough money that they were able to send Johnson to college. A friend of Johnson’s, Andrew Corbet, made up the deficit. Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford on October 31, 1728 at the age of nineteen. He did not finish college due to a lack of funds, leaving after thirteen months with no degree. Just before the publication of his Dictionary in 1755, Oxford University awarded Johnson the degree of Master of Arts. Later, he was awarded two honorary doctorates, one in 1765 by Trinity College Dublin, and another in 1775 by Oxford University. Johnson’s father died in December 1731.\n\nOn July 9, 1735, Johnson married Elizabeth Porter, the widow of his friend Harry Porter. Johnson was 25 at the time and Elizabeth was 21 years older. Johnson told a friend of his, “It was a love marriage upon both sides.” Neither the Porter nor the Johnson families were pleased with the marriage, not only because of the disparity in age, but because Johnson was, at the time, penniless. Elizabeth’s son Jervis (she had three children from her first marriage) refused to see her ever again because of her marriage. Her daughter Lucy, however, accepted Johnson, and, years later, her son Joseph became reconciled to the marriage.\n\nIn 1735, Johnson open a school, which failed. In October 1737, he moved to London, and found employment writing for The Gentleman’s Magazine. In May 1738, he anonymously published his first major work—his poem London. On June 18, 1746, Johnson signed a contract to write a dictionary of the English language. He finished it in nine years. In his biography Samuel Johnson, W. Jackson Bate writes of Johnson’s Dictionary, “The finished work … easily ranks as one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship, and probably the greatest ever performed by one individual who labored under anything like the disadvantages in a comparable length of time.”3 The dictionary was published in April 1755. While working on the dictionary, Johnson also wrote essays, poems, and sermons. In 1749, Johnson wrote his poem The Vanity of Human Wishes. A periodical by Johnson, The Rambler, was published on Tuesdays and Saturdays from 1750 to 1752.\n\nElizabeth Johnson, due to poor health, returned from London to the country in 1752 while Johnson was working on his Dictionary. She died on March 17, 1752. Johnson was very upset by his wife’s death.\n\nJohnson began to write a weekly series called The Idler, in 1758. It ran from April 15, 1758 to April 5, 1760. Rasselas was published on April 19, 1759. Comments being made about his procrastination prompted Johnson to finish the annotated edition of Shakespeare’s plays that he had begun some time ago, and had been putting off working on. In July 1762, King George III granted Johnson an annual pension of £300 in recognition of his Dictionary, which enabled him to concentrate on this work. It was published in 1765. In 1773, Johnson visited Scotland. In 1775, he wrote A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland, an account of his travels there. In the 1770s, Johnson published a series of pamphlets on various government polices. His last major work, Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets, a work which he had begun in 1740, was published in six volumes in 1781.\n\nOn June 17, 1783, Johnson suffered a stroke, due to poor circulation. Later he had a surgery for his gout, and was confined to his room from December 14, 1783 to April 21, 1784. He began to improve, and, on May 5, 1784, he travelled to Oxford. On November 16, 1784, Johnson moved to London. He died there on December 13, 1784.\n\nMore information:\n\nSamuel Johnson on Wikipedia\n\nRasselas on Wikipedia\n\nThe text of Rasselas on Wikisource\n\nThe Rambler on Wikipedia\n\nThe Idler on Wikipedia\n\nJohnson’s Works on Project Gutenberg\n\nJane Austen and Dr. Johnson in Persuasions\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Much of the information about the writing of Rasselas, I found in the 19th chapter, pp. 336-337, of Samuel Johnson, by Walter Jackson Bate, Washington D.C.: Couterpoint, 1998.\n\n2 Jane Austen: A Life, by Claire Tomalin, New York: Alfred A.
