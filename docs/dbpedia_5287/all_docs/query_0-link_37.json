        "text": "Very True,\n\nI was able to prove my lineage to Charlemagne as my 36th GGF for membership in the Order of the Crown of Charlemagne in August 2019 through the Ponce de Leon Family using the first proven Spanish Royal Gateway Ancestor Juan Montes Vigil.\n\nI was the first to do so after the extensive vetting of Juan Montes Vigil as a Royal Gateway ancestor.\n\nThe Application was 21 pages of cited sources with a Proof Package of the cited Sources over 131 pages of period documentation linking each generation to the next from me to Charlemagne.\n\nI do not have the pre-1500 authority so, I am unable to place the pre-1500 lines on Wikitree.\n\nHowever it is on Genealogics .org so the lineage & Sources are available to all.\n\nhttps://genealogics.org/pedigree.php?personID=I00760108&tree=LEO&fbclid=IwAR1LqCZlcp4HuLoG2PjWTxDEp7SQlP8QcXW6OO40nRWHjFPVPcA8NrZ-nc4\n\nI am going to run my tree out here, if others in projects would let me!\n\nand as far a it being a gene, it is either a gene, or a family line, and a family line isn't going to be in every persons family tree!\n\nso how can we all be related to Charlemagne as people have said, if its not a gene? if its a line then that's pretty easy to see? MY LINKAGE is my tree.\n\nand a simple line to john of gaunt is not that hard to figure out, if he was\n\nJohn of Gaunt Beaufort 1st Duke of Lancaster\n\n1340–1399\n\nBirth 6 MARCH 1340 • St. Bavon's Abbey, Ghent, Belgium\n\nDeath 3 FEBRUARY 1399 • Leicester Castle, Leicestershire, England\n\n18th great-grandfather\n\nlol the DATES are all good, it matches other people in the tree at the same period, exactly what is so hard about determining if your tree says you are related? What are we trying to prove?\n\nIf you are asking if there are lineages to Charlemagne that do not go through the Magna Carta Barons, the answer would be: of course there are.\n\nI'm putting this out here to help those who may have already discovered their link to one of the following eight MC barons, by showing where the documentation is that will take them from their Magna Carta baron to Charlemagne. I'm sure there are many paths to Charlemagne that do not go through England at all, but what we have in the books I cite by Douglas Richardson, are paths with documented evidence.\n\nMichael, when I discovered Magna Carta barons in my family tree I made it a priority to document those connections. I was amazed to eventually discover that many of the Magna Carta Surety Barons are descendants of King William the Conqueror, and so also descended from Charlemagne. I would have thought the same as your comment if not for the years of considering those lineages - and also for the gifts of nine not-so-inexpensive books. I have not found connections to Charlemagne for all of the MC barons, and the following is not a complete list.\n\nMy birthday is in December, so that year I asked to have no other presents for my birthday and Christmas than the four volume set of Magna Carta Ancestry, by Douglas Richardson, published 2011.\n\nRichardson published Royal Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, in 2013. It begins with William the Conqueror (1066) - and includes the Magna Carta barons. The Five volume set was my birthday/Christmas gift a few years ago.\n\nIn the Introduction to Royal Ancestry, Richardson writes that\n\n\"The Appendix in Volume V sets forth descents for both King William the Conqueror and wife, Maud of Flanders, from the Emperor Charlemagne (died 814).\n\nHow many of the Magna Carta barons were descended from William the Conqueror, and therefore from Charlemagne?\n\nOne random peek (see page 557) into Volume One of Royal Ancestry shows that Walter FitzRobert of Little Dunmow, Essex, who is father of Robert FitzWalter, Magna Charta Baron, is descended from Alice of Normandy, wife of Lambert, Count of Lens.\n\nRichardson includes Alice (aka Adeliza) of Normandy as a full sister of King William the Conqueror, who is a descendant of Charlemagne. Following is an incomplete list of Magna Carta barons with documented lineage to Charlemagne.\n\nHugh Bigod and Roger Bigod are also descendants of Charlemagne through Alice of Normandy, Royal Ancestry Vol 1, page 362.\n\nRichard de Clare (died 1217), married Amice of Gloucester - she is a descendant of King William the Conqueror. Their son Gilbert de Clare (died 1230) is therefore a descendant of Charlemagne. Royal Ancestry Vol 1, page 216.\n\nSaher de Quincy is a descendant of Alice of Normandy, Royal Ancestry Vol !V, page 436.\n\nIf you are a descendant of MC Surety Baron Geoffrey de Say (died 1230), then you are a descendant of Charlemagne through Geoffrey's wife Hawise de Clare, whose mother, Amice of Gloucester is a descendant of Charlemagne. Royal Ancestry Vol IV, page 562.\n\nMC baron William D'Aubengy (died 1236) is descended from Charlemagne through Alice of Normandy, sister of William the Conqueror. Royal Ancestry Vol II, page 392-393.\n\nSir William de Huntingfield (died about 1221), Magna Carta Surety Baron, is a descendant of Charlemagne through Alice of Normandy. Royal Ancestry Vol III page 373-374.\n\nMr. Marlyn Lewis, creator Our Royal, Titled, Noble, and Commoner Ancestors and Cousins, has a convenient list of the Magna Carta Surety Barons, linked to their profiles with footnotes to Royal Ancestry and Magna Carta Ancestry. by Richardson.\n\nI can skip the barons. William the Conqueror is my 25th great grandfather. This is the trail from my 3rd great grandfather, Landman Asbury. Have to do it in chunks because wikitree only does 25 generations.\n\n1.

I went to my tree on Ancestry where I have been mt and au DNA tested. I have typed the results of my lineage from Charlemagne, and it is an eye opener for me! It also explains why I have three trees for Charlemagne, and the two others show him as a great uncle or aunt, etc. to me. I am pasting a copy of this document below; however haven't checked facts, so may need correcting if needed.
