        "text": "13th governor of Arkansas\n\nThomas James Churchill (March 10, 1824 – May 14, 1905) was an American soldier and politician who served as the 13th governor of Arkansas from 1881 to 1883. Before that, he was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded infantry in the Western and Trans-Mississippi theaters of the American Civil War.\n\nElected as part of the Redeemers coalition that restored former Confederates to office after Radical Republicans were overthrown across the South, Churchill's gubernatorial tenure was largely derailed by a financial scandal stemming from his tenure as treasurer.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nThomas James Churchill was born near Louisville, Kentucky.[a] He graduated from St. Mary's College in Bardstown in 1844, then studied law at Transylvania University in Lexington. He served during the Mexican–American War, rising to the rank of first lieutenant in the 1st Kentucky Cavalry Regiment. The Mexican Army captured Churchill, who remained a prisoner of war until near the war's end. In 1848, Churchill moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, married the daughter of United States Senator Ambrose H. Sevier, and became a planter. Appointed by President James Buchanan, he was a postmaster from September 1857 to March 1861.[1]\n\nHis nephew would use part of the family estate at Spring Grove, Kentucky, to construct Churchill Downs.[2]\n\nAmerican Civil War\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the start of the American Civil War, Churchill joined the Confederate States Army cavalry as a colonel of the 1st Arkansas Mounted Rifles. His first combat took place at the Battle of Wilson's Creek near Springfield, Missouri. On March 4, 1862, he was promoted to brigadier-general and fought at the Siege of Corinth and soon thereafter took part in the Confederate Heartland Offensive. Churchill played an important role in the Battle of Richmond, commanding a division of men from Texas and Arkansas. Leading his division along a ravine that became known as \"Churchill's Draw\", he delivered a successful and surprising flanking attack. On February 17, 1864, Churchill was cited as one of three officers to receive special recognition in a Thanks of Confederate States Congress resolution for his actions at Richmond.[3]\n\nDuring the latter part of 1862, Churchill was transferred back to Arkansas and placed in charge of the fortifications at Arkansas Post. In January 1863, the Post was attacked and seized in the Battle of Arkansas Post by an overwhelming United States Army force under U.S. Maj. Gen. John Alexander McClernand. After his exchange, Churchill served for a brief time in the Army of Tennessee before once again being sent west of the Mississippi, where he continued his service in the Trans-Mississippi Department, commanding a division during the Red River Campaign. He played a significant role in the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry and was promoted to major-general on March 17, 1865.[3]\n\nLater life\n\n[edit]\n\nChurchill was elected Treasurer of Arkansas in 1873. He was subsequently re-elected in 1875, 1877, and 1879. During the Brooks–Baxter War of 1874, Churchill supported Elisha Baxter and helped enroll volunteers in Baxter's militia. Elected governor of Arkansas in 1880, Churchill served until 1883.[4] While governor, he was plagued by allegations of discrepancies in the treasurer's account from when he served as state treasurer. A special committee found a shortage of $294,876 ($9,310,000 in today's dollars) in state funds during Churchill's tenure as treasurer.[5]\n\nA lawsuit was brought against him, and he was ordered to repay the missing funds.[6] The scandal drew widespread opprobrium, even from the partisan press, and tarnished the image of the Redeemers in Arkansas, who ostensibly were elected to clean up the scandal-ridden Radical Republican state government that had been installed during Reconstruction.[7]\n\nChurchill died in Little Rock and was buried in historic Mount Holly Cemetery with military honors.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Confederate States Army generals\n\nList of governors of Arkansas\n\nThe Family (Arkansas politics)\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
