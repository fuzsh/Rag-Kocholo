This was on the same day as the 2023 local elections in England.\n\nThe council was under no overall control prior to the election, with Labour being the largest party and Labour's Andy Abrahams serving as mayor.[2] At the 2023 elections, Abrahams was re-elected as mayor and Labour won a majority of the seats on the council.[3]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nMansfield is one of the seven non-metropolitan districts within the area administered by Nottinghamshire County Council. Labour controlled Mansfield from its creation in 1973 until 2003.[4] In that election, the Mansfield Independent Forum won a majority of seats, and controlled the council until 2011, when Labour regained control. They held the council until 2019, when the council fell into no overall control. In that election, Labour won 15 seats with 34.3% of the vote, the Mansfield Independents won 13 with 34.6%, independents won 6 with 7.5%, and the Conservatives won 2 with 21.3%. The Labour candidate also won the mayoral election, taking 50.01% once second preferences had been allocated.\n\nNew ward boundaries were drawn up for this election, although the number of seats on the council remained 36 (excluding the mayor's seat). The wards of Abbott, Broomhill, Bull Farm and Pleasley Hill, Holly, Kingsway, Ladybrook, Maun Valley, Newgate, Newlands, Peafields, Portland, Ransom Wood, Sandhurst, Woodhouse, and Woodlands have been abolished, and the wards of Bancroft, Central, Holly Forest Town, Kingsway Forest Town, Maun Valley Forest Town, Mill Lane, Newlands Forest Town, Pleasley, Rock Hill, Rufford, Southwell, Thompsons, Vale, Wainwright, and West Bank have been created.[5]\n\nPrevious council composition\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter 2019 election Before 2023 election Party Seats Party Seats Labour 15 Labour 14 Mansfield Independent 13 Mansfield Independent 13 Independent 6 Independent 7 Conservative 2 Conservative 2\n\nChanges\n\n[edit]\n\nAmanda Fisher leaves Labour to sit as an independent\n\nMay 2019: Andy Abrahams (Labour) does not take seat due to election as Mayor of Mansfield; by-election held June 2019\n\nJune 2019: Dave Saunders (Mansfield Independent Forum) wins by-election[6]\n\nMarch 2021: Lee Anderson (Conservative) resigns; by-election held May 2021[7]\n\nMay 2021: Robert Elliman (Conservative) wins by-election[8]\n\nJune 2022: Vaughan Hopewell (Mansfield Independent Forum) dies; by-election held September 2022[9]\n\nSeptember 2022: Paul Henshaw (Labour) wins by-election[10]\n\nResults\n\n[edit]\n\n[11]\n\n2023 Mansfield District Council Party Candidates Seats Gains Losses Net gain/loss Seats % Votes % Votes +/− Labour 36 25 11 0 11 69.4% 43.0 9,587 +8.7 Conservative 35 5 6 1 3 13.9% 22.4 5,404 +1.4 Mansfield Independent 34 4 0 14 9 11.1% 24.8 5,534 -9.8 Independent 6 2 0 4 5 5.6% 6.8 1,522 -0.7 Green 4 0 0 0 0.0 0.5 149 New TUSC 10 0 0 0 0.0 0.5 114 New Reform UK 1 0 0 0 0.0 0.1 28 New\n\nResults by ward\n\n[edit]\n\nAn asterisk denotes an incumbent councillor.\n\nBancroft\n\n[edit]\n\nBancroft[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 477 Majority 191 40.0 Labour win (new seat)\n\nBerry Hill\n\n[edit]\n\nBerry Hill[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 902 Majority 226 25.1 Conservative gain from Mansfield Independent Swing\n\nBrick Kiln\n\n[edit]\n\nBrick Kiln[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 486 Majority 214 44.0 Labour hold Swing\n\nCarr Bank\n\n[edit]\n\nCarr Bank[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout Labour gain from Mansfield Independent Swing\n\nCentral\n\n[edit]\n\nCentral[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nEakring\n\n[edit]\n\nEakring[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nGrange Farm\n\n[edit]\n\nGrange Farm[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nHolly Forest Town\n\n[edit]\n\nHolly Forest Town[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nHornby\n\n[edit]\n\nHornby[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nKings Walk\n\n[edit]\n\nKings Walk[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout Conservative gain from Mansfield Independent Swing\n\nKingsway Forest Town\n\n[edit]\n\nKingsway Forest Town[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nLindhurst\n\n[edit]\n\nLindhurst[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nLing Forest\n\n[edit]\n\nLing Forest[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nManor\n\n[edit]\n\nManor[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 718 29.1 Majority 156 21.7 +20 Labour hold Swing\n\nMarket Warsop\n\n[edit]\n\nLeamington[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout Labour gain from Independent Swing\n\nMaun Valley Forest Town\n\n[edit]\n\nMaun Valley Forest Town[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nMeden\n\n[edit]\n\nSkegby[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nMill Lane\n\n[edit]\n\nMill Lane[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nNetherfield\n\n[edit]\n\nNetherfield[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout Labour gain from Independent Swing\n\nNewlands Forest Town\n\n[edit]\n\nNewlands Forest Town[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nOak Tree\n\n[edit]\n\nOak Tree[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nOakham\n\n[edit]\n\nOakham[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout Labour gain from Conservative Swing\n\nPark Hall\n\n[edit]\n\nPark Hall[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nPenniment\n\n[edit]\n\nPenniment[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout Labour gain from Mansfield Independent Swing\n\nPleasley\n\n[edit]\n\nPleasley[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nRacecourse\n\n[edit]\n\nRacecourse[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nRock Hill\n\n[edit]\n\nRock Hill[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nRufford\n\n[edit]\n\nRufford[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nSherwood\n\n[edit]\n\nSherwood[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout Labour gain from Mansfield Independent Swing\n\nSouthwell\n\n[edit]\n\nSouthwell[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nThompsons\n\n[edit]\n\nThompsons[12] Party Candidate Votes % Conservative gain from Mansfield Independent Swing Turnout\n\nVale\n\n[edit]\n\nVale[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nWainwright\n\n[edit]\n\nWainwright[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nWarsop Carrs\n\n[edit]\n\nWarsop Carrs[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nWest Bank\n\n[edit]\n\nWest Bank[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout\n\nYeoman Hill\n\n[edit]\n\nYeoman Hill[12] Party Candidate Votes % Turnout"
