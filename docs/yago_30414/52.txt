Mutemwiya was an Egyptian Queen, and minor wife of during the 18th Dynasty of Thutmose IV, and the mother of the Pharaoh Amenhotep III. Her name translates to "Mut in the divine bark". As a minor wife, she would not have had a major presence in the court. Due to her status, there is not much known about her background, and most works about her are from after her son was in power.

During her son's reign, she gained more power as the mother of the Pharaoh. She is shown in the "divine birth" scenes of her son in the Luxor temple. It is believed that she survived well into her son's reign. She is thought to have died between Year 30 and Year 34 of the reign of her son.

Mummification[]

Her tomb and her mummy have never been discovered, however a statue of a sacred boat that was dedicated to her is on display in the British Museum.
