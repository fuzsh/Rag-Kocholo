        "text": "George:\n\nOkay, now Yuya or M17-M17-G43-M17-G1-A1. Y (M17-M17 means Comes) G43-M17-G1 appears to be a shortened form of G43 - M17 - G1 - P1 which means 'the divine barque'. A1 is a determinative meaning 'a man'. So, Yuya means 'the divine barque comes or approaches'. According to Wiki: It also discusses the possibility that Yuya was the brother of queen Mutemwiya, who was the mother of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and may have had Mitannian royal origins.[1...Mutemwiya (also written as Mutemwia, Mutemuya or Mutemweya) was a minor wife of the Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Thutmose IV, and the mother of Pharaoh Amenhotep III. Mutemwiya's name means \"Mut in the divine barque\".[1] While unconfirmed, it has been suggested that she acted as regent during the minority of her son Amenhotep III.\" Ya think that somebody's Mama gave him a name that indicated he would be the next pharaoh????\n\nOkay, so Yuya was the uncle of Amenhotep III. He was named after his mother.\n\nHolly"
