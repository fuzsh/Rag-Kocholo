        "text": "The biblical story of Jacob-Israel’s son Joseph coming into Egypt as a slave but ending up becoming the second most powerful ruler in Egypt next to pharaoh is one of the most intriguing biblical stories. However, neither biblical historian nor Egyptologist has been able to locate the time period and pharaoh who elevated Joseph to such high status. Putting Joseph in the place of the Egyptian figure Yuya during the reigns of Thutmose IV and Amenhotep III now brings to light much of the enigmatic chronology, the reason for the sudden rise in monotheism during the Amarna Era, the origin of the enslavement of the Hebrew and Israelite peoples and finally their liberation and Exodus out of Egypt some 210 after Joseph’s entrance into Egypt and some 240 years before Solomon’s Temple building. Living as an Egyptian and being totally immersed in its culture, the Egyptians did not call Joseph by his Hebrew name but gave him Egyptian names. One of the primary names that he was known by in Egypt was “YUYA”."
