Records of only one very minor military expedition exist. This was too Upper Nubia which is a region along the Nile River located in what is today central Sudan.\n\nAmenhotep III's queen (Great Royal Wife) was Tiye. They had two sons together. There first son would die before Amenhotep III's death leaving the second son, Amenhotep IV, to succeeded Amenhotep III as ruler of Egypt.

Later his mummy was moved, during the ancient Egyptian Third Intermediate Period, to a location known as KV35.\n\nHis mortuary temple, built on the banks of the Nile River, was one of the largest temples the world has ever seen. However it was built to close to the Nile River and was destroyed by flooding within two hundred years of its construction. Two gigantic twin statues depicting Amenhotep III, towering 59 feet (18 meters) high, called the Colossi of Memnon are the only portions of the temple still standing.\n\nAncient Egypt Pharaohs Facts"
