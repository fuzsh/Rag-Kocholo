Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAmenhotep III was a powerful pharaoh of ancient Egypt’s New Kingdom who brought peace, prosperity, and magnificent architecture. Egypt flourished under his rule, becoming a cultural and artistic hub.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information about Amenhotep III, or you can download our 31-page Amenhotep III worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nAmenhotep III, or Amenhotep the Magnificent, born around 1401 BCE, was the son of Thutmose IV and Mutemwiya.\n\nThutmose IV became Pharaoh unexpectedly after his older brother’s early death.\n\nAmenhotep III became Pharaoh at a young age after his father passed away.\n\nLike many Egyptian princes, Amenhotep III’s childhood was a period of intense education and preparation for his future role as Pharaoh.\n\nHe grew up during the prosperous New Kingdom era, known for its advancements in art and architecture.\n\nAs the son of Thutmose IV and Mutemwiya, Amenhotep III was groomed for kingship from an early age.\n\nHis father was not the original heir to the throne but assumed power following the premature death of his elder brother.\n\nTheir family history may have deeply affected the young prince, making him well aware of life’s fragility and the unpredictability of power.\n\nAmenhotep III was trained in traditional pharaonic skills like riding, archery, and military tactics.\n\nHe learned from the kingdom’s best scribes, priests, and military officers.\n\nHis education also focused on administrative tasks, such as managing agricultural resources and delegating state responsibilities.\n\nHe learned the art of diplomacy from a young age to maintain peace and prosperity within his kingdom.\n\nThe unexpected death of his elder brother, Crown Prince Thutmose, who was initially the heir to the throne, helped Amenhotep III understand his future role.\n\nHe also witnessed the influential roles of his mother, Mutemwiya, and his wife, Queen Tiye, which gave him ideas and knowledge of the power women could have in the royal family and Egyptian politics.\n\nAmenhotep III’s life was defined by strategic marriages that strengthened his position and formed alliances.\n\nQueen Tiye, the Great Royal Wife to Amenhotep III, was the daughter of Yuya, a high-ranking military officer, and Thuya, an Egyptian noblewoman.\n\nShe played an important role as an advisor to the Pharaoh.\n\nAmenhotep III and Queen Tiye had two sons, Crown Prince Thutmose and Amenhotep IV, also known as Akhenaten.\n\nThey also had daughters, Sitamun, Iset, Hennuttaneb, Nebetah, and Beketaten.\n\nWhen Crown Prince Thutmose, the elder brother of Amenhotep IV, died early, it also led to Akhenaten’s unexpected rise to power.\n\nAside from Queen Tiye, Amenhotep III had several other wives, most foreign princesses.\n\nThis was a common practice among Egypt’s pharaohs as it helped forge political alliances with other countries.\n\nGilukhepa was one of these wives, a princess from the kingdom of Mitanni in modern-day Syria.\n\nTadukhepa, another Mitanni princess, became Amenhotep III’s wife late in his reign.\n\nAmenhotep III’s other wives included a daughter of the king of Babylon, a sister of the king of Hatti, and a daughter of the king of Arzawa.\n\nThese marriages further demonstrated the broad extent of Egypt’s diplomatic relations under Amenhotep III’s rule.\n\nAmenhotep III also married his daughters, Sitamun and Iset.\n\nThis practice aimed to strengthen the royal bloodline and showcased the intricate familial and political ties within the royal family.\n\nREIGN\n\nAmenhotep III ascended to the throne around 1388 BCE following his father’s death.\n\nAlthough there was some debate among historians, they believed he was only around 12 years old when he assumed power.\n\nOne of Amenhotep III’s significant accomplishments was constructing an artificial lake in his wife’s hometown.\n\nThe creation of this artificial lake in Djakaru highlighted Amenhotep III’s commitment to showcasing Egypt’s prosperity and cultural elegance and his affection for Queen Tiye.\n\nIt also provided a water source for irrigation and fishing, thus contributing to the region’s prosperity.\n\nAmenhotep III’s rule was marked by a shift towards a more peaceful and diplomatic approach than his predecessors.\n\nHis leadership prioritized peace, diplomacy, and cultural growth rather than military conquest.\n\nThis shift was reflected in his extensive diplomatic correspondence with rulers of other great nations of the time, which were preserved in the Amarna Letters.\n\nThe Amarna Letters, a collection of diplomatic correspondence found at el-Amarna, provide a glimpse into Amenhotep III’s diplomatic prowess.\n\nThe letters reveal extensive communications with rulers of other great nations of the time, including those of Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Syria, Canaan, and Cyprus.\n\nThey showed Egypt’s engagement in international diplomacy, diplomatic marriages, and gift-giving, which were the cornerstones of Amenhotep III’s international relations policy.\n\nThese alliances brought peace and economic prosperity, with wealth flowing into Egypt through trade and diplomatic gifts.\n\nThrough gift-giving, Amenhotep III received exotic gifts from foreign leaders, such as ebony, ivory, gold, lapis lazuli, horses, and chariots from Mitanni, an ally of Egypt.\n\nIn return, Amenhotep III sent gold obtained from Egypt’s mines in Nubia, demonstrating Egypt’s wealth.\n\nUnder Amenhotep III’s leadership, Egypt experienced a cultural renaissance.\n\nArt, architecture, and literature flourished under his patronage.\n\nHe commissioned many grand construction projects.\n\nThis period of peace and prosperity allowed Amenhotep III to focus on domestic matters.\n\nHe initiated administrative reforms that improved the efficiency of the government and oversaw the development of the nation’s infrastructure.\n\nHe also promoted religious harmony within the kingdom, balancing the influence of the priests of Amun with the worship of other gods.\n\nThe peaceful relations became strained during the reign of his son, Akhenaten, as he neglected foreign policy, leading to a loss of Egypt’s influence and the decline of its international power.\n\nNevertheless, Amenhotep III’s diplomatic legacy echoes in Egypt’s history, making his reign the pinnacle of diplomacy in the country.\n\nSED FESTIVALS\n\nAmenhotep III held one of the grandest Sed Festivals in Ancient Egyptian history.\n\nThe Sed Festival, also known as Heb Sed or the Feast of the Tail, was a royal jubilee to renew the Pharaoh’s strength and vigor.\n\nThe festivals included building festival halls and temples and creating intricate art and sculpture, like the statues at Amenhotep III’s mortuary temple in Thebes.\n\nAmenhotep III’s Sed Festivals were religious and political ceremonies and massive public works projects.\n\nThese festivals allowed Amenhotep III to publicly display Egypt’s wealth and power.\n\nTraditionally, the festival was celebrated after 30 years on the throne and then every three or four years.\n\nAmenhotep, son of Hapu, a trusted advisor to the Pharaoh, also planned and organized the grand festivals.\n\nHis architectural skills and governance proficiency ensured successful execution.\n\nAmenhotep was involved in designing and constructing festival venues, including a vast open-air temple at Malkata.\n\nHe also had a spiritual and ritual role in Sed Festivals.\n\nThe festival was a spectacular occasion that involved elaborate rituals, feasting, and a procession of the Pharaoh around the temple grounds.\n\nIt showcased the Pharaoh’s vitality and divine nature, reinforcing his right to rule.\n\nIn Amenhotep III’s case, evidence suggests that he held not one but three Sed Festivals in Regnal Years 30,34 and 37, more than any other pharaoh.\n\nThis is shown by the numerous commemorative scarabs, statues, and reliefs that depict the king participating in the Sed Festival rites.\n\nThe artworks show the festival’s rituals, including Amenhotep III participating in a ceremonial race, making offerings to the gods, and wearing the unique Sed Festival robe.\n\nSTRUCTURES AND MONUMENTS\n\nAmenhotep III’s reign was marked by a surge in architectural activity and artistic innovation, leaving a lasting legacy of monuments and artifacts.\n\nThe Colossi of Memnon\n\nThese are two massive stone statues of Amenhotep III, originally positioned to guard the entrance to his mortuary temple in Thebes, serving as a sacred space for his spirit in the afterlife.\n\nThese statues represent the Pharaoh and embody divine symbolism, immortalizing Amenhotep III and his god-king ideology.\n\nMalkata Palace\n\nThe Malkata Palace was the royal residence of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye, situated near Thebes.\n\nIt consisted of temples, gardens, and administrative buildings.\n\nAs the primary dwelling place for the Pharaoh and his queen, it served various functions and showcased Amenhotep III’s wealth and power.\n\nSoleb Temple\n\nThe Soleb Temple, located in present-day Sudan, was built by Amenhotep III as a symbol of his divine authority and religious devotion.\n\nThe temple’s design reflected the ruler’s divine status and the god-king ideology of Ancient Egypt.\n\nTemple of Amun in Karnak\n\nAmenhotep III added structures to the Temple of Amun in Karnak, including a colonnade with large pillars and massive statues.\n\nDedicated to the deity Amun, the temple demonstrated Amenhotep III’s devotion and reinforced his divine status.\n\nLuxor Temple\n\nAmenhotep III initiated the construction of this significant temple, which was later completed by Tutankhamun and Horemheb.\n\nThe Luxor Temple, one of Amenhotep III’s most notable architectural feats, was primarily dedicated to the Theban triad of gods: Amun, Mut, and Khonsu.\n\nThe temple was not only a place of worship but also the setting for key events like the annual Opet Festival, where the statues of the Theban triad were paraded from the Karnak Temple to the Luxor Temple to reenact the Pharaoh’s divine birth.\n\nKom el-Hettan Temple\n\nThe Kom el-Hettan Temple, also known as the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III, was a remarkable architectural masterpiece commissioned by Amenhotep III.\n\nIt served as a place of worship and a dwelling for the Pharaoh’s spirit after his death.\n\nMemphis Serapeum\n\nAmenhotep III built a temple dedicated to the Apis Bull in Memphis.\n\nThis temple showcased Amenhotep III’s reverence for the Apis Bull, an important deity in ancient Egyptian religion.\n\nThe temple served as a sacred space for rituals and reinforced cultural and religious practices.\n\nThough it is mostly destroyed now, it symbolizes Amenhotep III’s commitment to Egypt’s religious traditions.\n\nOpen-air Temple at Malkata\n\nThe open-air temple at Malkata was specifically built for the Sed Festivals.\n\nThe temple had religious and political significance, reaffirming the Pharaoh’s divine power and rule.\n\nIt also symbolized stability, continuity, and the strength of Ancient Egypt.\n\nKawa Temple\n\nThe Kawa Temple, built by Amenhotep III in Nubia, was dedicated to the god Amun.\n\nThe temple represented Amenhotep III’s divine kingship beyond Egypt’s borders, his protection of religious traditions, and strengthened the ties between Egypt and Nubia.\n\nMaru-Aten Sun Temple\n\nThe Maru-Aten Sun Temple, located in Amarna, was an important structure dedicated to the sun god Aten.\n\nBuilt by Amenhotep III, it served as a place of worship and symbolized his religious beliefs.\n\nHowever, it was later dismantled by his son and successor, Akhenaten, marking a significant change in ancient Egypt’s religious landscape.\n\nAmenhotep III’s legacy also includes several commemorative scarabs, large inscribed beetles made of glazed steatite, which were circulated to announce significant events of his reign.\n\nThese scarabs provide valuable insights into his life, documenting everything from his marriages and building projects to lion hunts and cattle counts.\n\nDEATH\n\nAmenhotep III’s death marked the end of a prosperous era in Egypt.\n\nThe cause of his death remains a mystery, but it is believed that he had health problems in his later years.\n\nHe was buried in the Valley of the Kings in a magnificent tomb (KV22), reflecting his status and achievements.\n\nThe tomb is quite significant as it’s one of the most extensive royal tombs in the valley.\n\nIt stretches over 120 meters into the limestone bedrock, with a complex series of corridors and chambers reflecting his reign’s grandeur.\n\nHis death and burial followed traditional Egyptian customs despite religious changes, showcasing the enduring respect for ancient rituals.\n\nThe discovery of Amenhotep III’s mummy has added a significant chapter to our understanding of this notable Pharaoh.\n\nThe mummy was found in the Valley of the Kings by Victor Loret in 1898, inside KV35, a tomb built initially for Amenhotep II.\n\nThis relocation from his original tomb (KV22) is thought to have been done by priests, possibly to prevent tomb robbery.\n\nThe mummy, identified by a clay seal with Amenhotep III’s throne name, was found in a side chamber alongside other royal mummies.\n\nAmenhotep III’s mummy is well-preserved, providing important physical insights into his life.\n\nSUCCESSION\n\nAmenhotep III’s succession was a significant event that marked the continuation of the 18th Dynasty rule over Egypt.\n\nHis son, Amenhotep IV, succeeded him, who is better known by his later taken name, Akhenaten.\n\nAmenhotep III’s health began to deteriorate in the latter years of his reign, evidenced by the numerous statues and sculptures depicting him as an aging man.\n\nDespite his declining health, his power was not immediately succeeded by his son, Amenhotep IV.\n\nInstead, a co-regency was established, allowing the young prince to share the responsibilities of governance with his ailing father.\n\nThe period of co-regency, a rarity in ancient Egyptian history, is seen by historians as a preparation phase for Amenhotep IV.\n\nAlthough the precise length of the co-regency is a matter of debate, it is believed that it lasted for several years, providing a smooth transition of power.\n\nUpon Amenhotep III’s death, Amenhotep IV ascended to the throne and initially continued his father’s reign’s religious and artistic traditions.\n\nHowever, a few years into his rule, he introduced revolutionary changes that profoundly affected Egyptian society.\n\nAmenhotep III Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about Amenhotep III across 31 in-depth pages.
