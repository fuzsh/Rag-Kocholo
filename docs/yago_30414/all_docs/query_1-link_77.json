        "text": "Krokhotep – Amenhotep III or Imhotep\n\nhttps://wizard101.fandom.com/wiki/Krokhotep\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenhotep_III\n\nhttps://mummy.fandom.com/wiki/Imhotep\n\nYears before Malistaire sunk the Death School, Krokhotep was once an ally of the Order of the Fang, a group of Kroks and Manders who wanted the end of the Tuts. Krokopatra hypnotized him in to becoming one of her minions. Like the Manders in the Great Shpinx, his skin turned dark blue since he became a servant to the sphinx.\n\nThere are two possibilities of inspiration for Krokhotep. One is a Pharaoh, there other is a fictional Egyptian Priest who was raised from the dead as the dreaded Mummy.\n\nAmenhotep III, also known as Amenhotep the Magnificent or Amenhotep the Great, was the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty. He ruled Egypt from June 1386 to 1349 BC, or from June 1388 BC to December 1351 BC/1350 BC, after his father Thutmose IV died. Amenhotep was Thutmose’s son by a minor wife, Mutemwiya. His reign was a period of unprecedented prosperity and splendor, when Egypt reached the peak of its artistic and international power.\n\nImhotep was an ancient Egyptian priest, the high-priest of Osiris, and the adviser to Seti I. For his crimes of murdering the Pharaoh and using dark magic from the book of the dead, Imhotep was executed with mummification, becoming the only known person to be cursed with the Hom-Dai, the evilest of all ancient curses. He was played by Boris Karloff in the 1932 film and by Arnold Vosloo in the 1999 remake.\n\nThis is the twenty-eighth article chronicling the #W101PopCulture references starting in Wizard City and the sixth for Krokotopia. The current list of all the (known) Krokotopia references can be found here. These articles were originally put together for a Facebook group I belong to. Although I am well versed in Pop Culture references but I do not claim to have caught them all. Let me know your favorites in the comments and if I’ve missed one you caught, let me know so I can add it to the list.\n\nText for this article is excerpted from the linked wiki pages\n\nKrokhotep image is from Wizard101, and is (c) KingsIsle Entertainment.\n\nStatue of Amenhotep at the Biritish Museum is a photograph by A. Parrot it is borrowed from Wikipedia and is in the Public Domain.\n\nThe Mummy photos are (c) Universal Pictures"
