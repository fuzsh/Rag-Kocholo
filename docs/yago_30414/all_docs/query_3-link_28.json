        "text": "Mutemwiya in English dictionary\n\nMutemwiya\n\nSample sentences with \"Mutemwiya\"\n\nDeclension Stem\n\nA secondary wife of Tuthmosis IV by the name of Mutemwiya was the mother to the heir of the throne.\n\nAmenhotep III was Thutmose's son by a minor wife, Mutemwiya.\n\nTwo shorter figures are carved into the front throne alongside his legs: these are his wife Tiye and mother Mutemwiya.\n\nMutemwiya's name means \"Mut in the divine bark\".\n\nThe date of Mutemwiya's death is unknown, but she is believed to have survived long into her son's reign.\n\nHe argues that since Mutemwiya was present during the early years of her son's reign, she might have engineered the marriage between Tiye and the young king to connect her family with royalty.\n\nMutemwiya is only shown on the monuments of her son Amenhotep III.\n\nIn this myth, Amenhotep III is conceived by Amun which has gone to Mutemwiya in form of Thutmosis IV.\n\nMutemwiya is not attested during the reign of her husband Thutmose IV.\n\nA pregnant queen Mutemwiya as later shown being led to the birthing room by Isis and Khnum.\n\nIn a key scene Mutemwiya is shown seated on a bed receiving the god Amun who had taken the form of her husband Thutmosis IV.\n\nMutemwiya is shown in the Luxor temple, in scenes depicting the divine birth of her son Amenhotep III.\n\nMany years later Pharaoh Amenhotep III copied these scenes almost exactly to show how Amun visited his mother queen Mutemwiya and conceived the royal prince.\n\nMutemwiya (also written as Mutemwia, Mutemuya or Mutemweya) was a minor wife of Thutmose IV, a pharaoh of Egypt, in the Eighteenth Dynasty and the mother of Pharaoh Amenhotep III.\n\nAuthors"
