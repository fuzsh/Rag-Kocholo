His prenomen or royal name, Menkheperure, means \"Established in forms is Re.\"\n\nDating the beginning of the reign of Thutmose IV is difficult to do with certainty because he is several generations removed from the astronomical dates which are usually used to calculate Egyptian chronologies, and the debate over the proper interpretation of these observances has not been settled. Thutmose's grandfather Thutmose III almost certainly acceded the throne in either 1504 or 1479, based upon two lunar observances during his reign.[2] After ruling for nearly 54 years,[3] Amenhotep II, Thutmose IV's father, took the throne and ruled for at least 26 years,[4] but has been assigned up to 35 years in some chronological reconstructions.[5] The currently preferred reconstruction, after analyzing all this evidence, usually comes to an accession date around 1401 BC[6] or 1400 BC[7] for the beginning of Thutmose IV's reign.\n\nThe length of his reign is not as clear as one would wish. He is usually given about nine or ten years of reign. Manetho credits him a reign of 9 years and 8 months.[8] However, Manetho's other figures for the 18th dynasty are frequently assigned to the wrong kings or simply incorrect, so monumental evidence is also used to determine his reign length.[9] Of all of Thutmose IV's dated monuments, three date to his first regnal year, one to his fourth, possibly one to his fifth, one to his sixth, two to his seventh, and one to his eighth.[10] Two possible other dated objects, one dated to a Year 19 and another year 20, have been suggested as belonging to him, but neither have been accepted as dating to his reign.[10] The reading of the king in these dates are today accepted as referring to the prenomen of Thutmose III--Menkheperre—and not Menkhepe[ru]re Thutmose IV himself. Due to the absence of higher dates for Thutmose IV after his Year 8 Konosso stela,[11] Manetho's figures here are usually accepted.[8] There were once chronological reconstructions which gave him a reign as long as 34–35 years.[8][12] Today, however, most scholars ascribe give him a 10 year reign from 1401 to 1391 BC, within a small margin of error.\n\nThutmose IV was born to Amenhotep II and Tiaa but was not actually the crown prince and Amenhotep II's chosen successor to the throne.
