        "text": "The tomb of Ay ...\n\nthe first thing which has been noted in that tomb [TA25] is a title carried by Ay: \"father of the God\" [there is who suggests to say guardian, but father is what you can see in the hieroglyphs].\n\nSo, if our supposition that Ay was, in some way, Nefertiti's father is correct, actually this title would mean that he was \"father\" [father-in-law] of Amenhotep IV / Akhenaten.\n\nAnd among other title he had a military one: Chief of the Entire Cavalry of the King.\n\nThis is interesting because it means that he wasn't totally disengaged from the I armed forces, at least he commanded the cavalry of the Royal Guard [not a great unit, anyway ...].\n\nThe East-thickness presents a classical scene where the Royal Family is adoring the Aten, but this time there is a further \"actress\": Mutbenret, Nefertiti's sister, is present with two dwarfs and servants.\n\nAn other detail which deserves attention, being Ay's tomb, is that only Nefertiti shows the cartouches of the Aten on her body [I cannot see them on Akhenaten's body].\n\nThe first thought which comes to mind is that she is more sacred than the husband ... but the drawing is badly damaged.\n\nWhen you put things the way you have, it makes things seem fairly obvious. (I realise just because something seems obvious doesn't mean it is fact, it I will go with it for the moment, as I have no better theories to refute 'the obvious' just now).\n\nIf Ay was 'father of the God' it would seem to me that he was either:\n\n1. Father of Akhenaten, or\n\n2. Father-in-Law of Akhenaten, or\n\n3. As an honour, allowed to style himself as Father of the God.\n\nIf his wife, Tey, nursed Nefertiti as a baby, then Ay had some connection to Nefertiti. It seems clear she was some kind of relative, either by blood or marriage.\n\nThe fact Nefertiti became Great Royal Spouse and Ay became Father of the God does suggest 'Father in Law'... To me, as I indicated, this saysAy is by far the best candidate we have to be father of Nefertiti.\n\nAy being chief of the Royal Cavalry is instructive. He was also a palace official, close to the engine room, if not running, the engine of administration. His direct role, or just his opportunity for influence at the heart of government, tells me Horemheb would not in the least have had it all his own way when it came to the army. To be honest, I do not think it at all unlikely Ay was a superior to Horemheb when it came to the army.\n\nNefertiti's sister and her dwarves... I will address this when I quote your other post on this...\n\nIf Nefertiti has the Aten on her, could this mean she was identified more strongly with the Aten than even Akhenaten. Possibly more sacred than her husband, as you say.\n\nHow Ay presents himself [in certain sense, being a tomb ... https://archive.org/stream/rocktombsofelama18davi#page/n109/mode/2up].\n\nThis inscription is remarkable. First of all Ay presents the Aten and the Royal Couple ,then he talks about how he was appreciated. I starts saying \"I was a favorite of the King daily, about everything. My Rewards every year were greater than the ones of the previous year ...\" And as we have see also Tey, his wife, received rewards as well.\n\n** a note about the east thickness drawing **\n\nI have forgotten to add that one of the dwarfs of Mutbenret is presented as the vizier of the Queen and she is a woman: Erneheh. The other is the vizier of his mother, Para.\n\nT\n\nThen, it's in the scene where the Aten embraces Akhenaten that Ay and Tey get rewards together and the entire Royal Family is rewarding them.\n\nAnd once again, in a totally symmetrical depiction, the cartouches of Nefertiti are always in the same sense. No inversion to follow the cartouches of Akhenaten. This has to mean something ... [https://archive.org/stream/rocktombsofelama18davi#page/n123/mode/2up]\n\nI need to mull over this post a bit more. Fascinating, but I am not sure what to make of it yet, or what questions to put yet...\n\nAy keeps on showing his attitude towards the Royal Couple: he&#8217;s deeply traditional.\n\nOn the inner jambs we can see that he even shows the Horo and the Nebty name of the Monarch.\n\nAnd on the architrave we see again Nefertiti in a particular form &#8230; it sounds Nefertiti Atennefernefer !!! This is quite something. I have to analyze that architrave.\n\n[https://archive.org/stream/rocktombsofelama18davi#page/n125/mode/2up]\n\nP.S. on the architrave Ay [we have to keep in mind that the owner of the tomb had a say in its preparation] shows again the Nebty name and the Horo name of Akhenaten, but the Horo name is not in a facade. And, as usual, Nefertiti lives forever in the eternity [but not Akhenaten &#8230; I have to ponder this].\n\nP.S. 2: on the inner jambs we see Nefertiti Neferneferuaten inverted ... so there was a reason not to invert that name in some contexts. Which reason?\n\nWouldn&#8217;t Aten-Nefer-Nefer just be the way names should run, with the God first? You mention Ay being &#8216;traditional&#8217;. Could this just be an example of that?\n\nThe mention of Nefertiti living in eternity. Could this be the kind of thing a father might say of his daughter - one who, especially, who has done extremely well in life?\n\nAs to inversions. Could there be ways to write things in certain ways in certain contexts? As you imply, I know. Perhaps when talking of horos and nebty names, there was a particular etiquette demanded? Possibly the same as mentioning &#8216;Aten-Nefer-Nefer&#8217; as a tradition (or etiquette).\n\nPlease explain what you mean by: \"Was obvious to make this public?\"\n\nI am wondering if other folk, other than Pharaohs, had more than one wife. If so, would there be a hierarchy of wives, with Tey at the top of the hierarchy of Ay's wives.\n\nTey being shown as nurse of Nefertiti would surely be something to advertise a long time after being nursed as a child, and then only 'after' she became Great Royal Wife.\n\nMaybe the simplest explanation may be that Nefertiti was a member of Ay or Tey's immediate family.\n\nAy is from Akhmin, we know that. Thuya and Yuya were from Akhmin. Nakhtmin too. The official roles of all three were reasonably similar. Just the fact they became officials and were from Akhmin seems telling to me. Also their connection with the Royals seems undoubted.\n\nI remember you mentioning something about a Thutmose IV possibly being an ancestor of Nefertiti. Also I seem to remember reading somewhere or other of there being another possibility for a member of the Akhmin clan (?) being a wife of Thutmose IV. Amenophis's mother. Must look.\n\nAnyway, I can't help thinking Tiye is a fairly obvious candidate to be a relative of Nefertiti. Ay the same. And if Tiye is daughter of Thuya and Yuya, then it stands to reason that Ay is related to them as well. I know we already know all this, but I am just raking over the coals to help focus my thinking....\n\nEdit: also I seem to remember some idea of family generations of Royal officials descending alongside the generations of the Royals they served... so the official of Thutmose IV might be the grand father of an official of Akhenaten.\n\nLet's see ... Thutmose IV got married with Nefertari, an other woman who we don't know so well as for origin, then he took her sister as Great Royal Spouse [Iaret] and he had a third minor wife: Mutemwiya [again a reference to Mut] ther grandmother of Akhenaten [she was the mother of Amenhotep III]. She lived enough to collect the titles of Royal Mother and Royal Spouse. But also about here we don't know from where she came.\n\nWhen you put things the way you have, it makes things seem fairly obvious. (I realise just because something seems obvious doesn't mean it is fact, it I will go with it for the moment, as I have no better theories to refute 'the obvious' just now).\n\nIf Ay was 'father of the God' it would seem to me that he was either:\n\n1. Father of Akhenaten, or\n\n2. Father-in-Law of Akhenaten, or\n\n3. As an honour, allowed to style himself as Father of the God.\n\nIf his wife, Tey, nursed Nefertiti as a baby, then Ay had some connection to Nefertiti.

I will address this when I quote your other post on this...\n\nIf Nefertiti has the Aten on her, could this mean she was identified more strongly with the Aten than even Akhenaten. Possibly more sacred than her husband, as you say.\n\nThe impression is that Ay, with his clan, was able to reach a position of great importance, thanks to his political skills, family relations and the capability to appease the Monarchs. The command of the Royal Cavalry could have been a reward as well. It was important [that unit of Cavalry defended the King and actually it was the vizier to organize the protection of the sovereign when he left the palace, so Ay, was in close contact with the highest officers of the court]. In any case we have to underline that it's probable that Ay knew a certain military career.\n\nThe phonetic transliteration gives the impression of names with a similar origin ... obviously being Thuja Tiye's mother they shared the same origin. The father Yuya was from Akhmin as well.\n\nTiye and Tey in hieroglyphs are really similar, sure they are names of the same group. If we want to follow this path ... it's like to see two persons called \"Renzo\" and \"Lorenzo\" ... they are Italians.\n\nAnd of course Ay is from Akhmin and I am pretty sure I have seen his name put as &#8216;Aya&#8217;. There may have been lots of names like this in Akhmin, but how many of that name, not related to each other, were congregating on the Royal palace? All these folk from Akhmin were surely related; or at least surely from the same tribal group, which might amount pretty much to the same thing.\n\nTiye and Ay and Tey were likely related, I think. And Nefertiti, being nursed by Tey, surely was a relative too. Still would like to know what Nefertiti&#8217;s original name was. Kiya?\n\nMind, still would like to know who Nefertiti&#8217;s sister was... and I do need to get back to her and those dwarves... still don&#8217;t know where to go with that, nor think of good questions to ask....\n\nAnd of course Ay is from Akhmin and I am pretty sure I have seen his name put as 'Aya'.

This would mean that Nefertiti had a kind of habit to live a double life ... honestly it would be really odd, even in the Amarna period. This requires to check the evidences that Kiya was alive during the first years of Akhenaten's reign.\n\nThe problem with Kiya is that there would be clues that she disappeared after that Nefertiti appeared.

This requires to check the evidences that Kiya was alive during the first years of Akhenaten's reign.\n\nI have had trouble to put at rest in my mind that Kiya was so prominent when Nefertiti and Tiye and Meritaten were in such prominence themselves. But a thought just occurred to me: could Kiya be another sister of Nefertiti?\n\nAs to any double life, I don&#8217;t think so. Just a woman with two names. The one she was given at birth and the one she adopted on becoming Great Royal Spouse. She may not have so much lost a nomen but gained another with the former not falling out of use - in the record - until reasonably late in the piece. Meritaten, btw, if born earlier earlier than some think, and before Akhenaten&#8217;s accession, could be in a similar boat...\n\nNo, Let&#8217;s keep it firmly at the front of our minds for a moment!\n\nNefertiti means something like &#8216;the beautiful one has come&#8217; I seem to recall.\n\nWhat would &#8216;Titji&#8217; (or Tititi or Titi) mean on its own? And what would &#8217;Tiye&#8217; and &#8216;Thuja&#8217; mean as well while we are at it?\n\nTiye can mean something, it looks phonetic [this is why I tend to imagine to a distortion made by scribe of an existing name], but it's composed by the hieroglyph for \"future\", the one for \"I\" [or \"me\", \"my\"] and the one indicating duality or something to dangerous to be written [they used that sign to hide the dangerous one].\n\nSo it could be \"My dual future\" or \"I, something dangerous in the future\" or \"My dangerous future\".\n\nThuya could mean something like \"I how yours\" or \"Me how you\".\n\nComing back to this."
