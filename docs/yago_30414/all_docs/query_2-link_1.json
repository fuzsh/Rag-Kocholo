Her name translates to \"Mut in the divine bark\". As a minor wife, she would not have had a major presence in the court. Due to her status, there is not much known about her background, and most works about her are from after her son was in power.\n\nDuring her son's reign, she gained more power as the mother of the Pharaoh. She is shown in the \"divine birth\" scenes of her son in the Luxor temple. It is believed that she survived well into her son's reign. She is thought to have died between Year 30 and Year 34 of the reign of her son.\n\nMummification[]\n\nHer tomb and her mummy have never been discovered, however a statue of a sacred boat that was dedicated to her is on display in the British Museum.\n\nAdditional[]\n\nTitles: God’s Wife (hmt-ntr), Great King’s Wife (hmt-niswt-wrt), Lady of The Two Lands (nbt-t3wy), Great King’s Wife, his beloved (hmt-niswt-wrt meryt.f), Hereditary Princess (iryt-p`t), Great of Praises (wrt-hzwt), Sweet of Love (bnrt-mrwt), Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt (hnwt-Shm’w-mhw), God’s Mother (mwt-ntr).\n\n[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nhttps://worldhistory.us/ancient-history/ancient-egypt/mutemwiya-and-the-divine-birth-of-amenhotep-iii.php\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/AidanDodsonTheCompleteRoyalFamiliesOfAncientEgypt"
