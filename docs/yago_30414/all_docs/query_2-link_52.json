        "text": "The Lord AND .... maybe? Or maybe the death of the .... Pharaoh on Meryre II's wall dies and the big three Ay, Horemheb and Maya decide it's time. Neferneferuaten Smenkhkare had gone half way, time go all in? I wonder about Mayati, Mistress of the House. As I have postulated before now, perhaps her prominence in the Amarna Letters is due to her being a regent of sorts to a very young Tut? Acting as a queen mother might/during his childhood. Ankhsenpaaten subsequently becomes his wife when he is old enough. I'm still ready to at least consider alongside Zivie that Maia is Meritaten, foster mother of a Tut. Nurse as in minder/mentor/regent? O elf the letter from Tyre (I think it is) is more about persuading Mayati than it is pharaoh himself. Courtesy addresses the letter to pharaoh, but Mayati is the target of complaint. Mayati as Meritaten would not seem to have such prominence if she was but GRW. And, indeed, she is no time addressed as GRW, just as mistress if the House. Could that be a synonym of sorts for Chief of the Harem? Tiye, early in, seems to have held almost the same position while Akhenaten was still quite young, even though he already had a GRW of his own.\n\nNB I'm in agreement with those who think Akhenaten was as Hong as 12 or 13 when he ascended the throne. Meritaten born about Year 1-2. Nefertiti perhaps a little older than him. Tiye acting as GRW in the first 2-3 years before Nefertiti becomes his GRW.\n\nMerytaten [or Meritaten, choose your preferred spelling] has played a pivotal role in the period of the succession to Akhenaten.\n\nWe miss the interlude. Merytaten passed from being Royal Daughter to be Great Royal Wife of Neferneferuaten and then of Smenkhkare.\n\nBut .. what happened in the meanwhile?\n\nMerytaten [or Meritaten, choose your preferred spelling] has played a pivotal role in the period of the succession to Akhenaten.\n\nWe miss the interlude. Merytaten passed from being Royal Daughter to be Great Royal Wife of Neferneferuaten and then of Smenkhkare.\n\nBut .. what happened in the meanwhile?\n\nI intuit that between the death of Neferneferuaten Smenkhkare and Ay we have the reign of the boy king, Tut. I am confident there is no shock in that statement! Though some might put it to a democratic vote and say those who think Neferneferuaten and Smenkhkare have the numbers! Me, I vote with the minority, as you know.\n\nWhen 'Ankhkheperure' dies - by accident, illness or murder - Tut becomes ruler as a child. Meritaten by now is possibly 20 years old, allowing that Akhenaten ruled - in name at least if not actively toward the end - around 21 years, as Battiscombe Gunn believed. As I have recorded already, this because he saw two upside down v's before being pressured into changing his 20 years into 10 because. Presumably, he lost that democratic vote!\n\nMeritaten had served functionally as GRW within the reigns of Akhenaten and 'Ankhkheperure'. She becomes senior female of the royals, and Tut's main protector. Ay, Horemheb and Maya support her as a regent type figure. She is 'Mistress of the House'. The royal house. When Tut is old enough, Ankhsenpaaten becomes his wife. Ankhsenpaaten is a few years older than Tut. . Meritaten - maybe 4 years or more older than Ankhsenpaaten, - is more mother than potential marriage partner. Or she dies herself sometime into Tut's first years. For me, the sequence of events need not be so mysterious.\n\nNB I have had a knock in my confidence regards Nebkheper-en-Re, son of Meryre, being NebkheperuRe (Tut). According to my investigations of a few weeks ago, Nebkheper-en-Re and Nebkheper-u-Re would seem not to be the same name. We have a singular and a plural: that's 'kheper' and 'kheper-u'. Though the similarity of throne names, and the problem of who Nebkheper-u-Re was, leaves the question open for me. Who was he? Where does he fit?\n\nIn a doc on YouTube by Curtis Woodhouse regards Nefertiti, an argument is made for the KV21 mummies being Nefertiti and Ankhsenpaaten. I have seen the theory before and it does make some sense. If Nefertiti died as Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten/Smenkhkare, she might well have been buried in the VoK. Whether in KV62 or not. Wherever she ended up, it might be more than plausible that Ankhesenamun, after the death of Tut, died herself, and where better to place her than with her mother?\n\nI've gone lukewarm on KV35YL being Nefertiti - again! My reasoning remains the same. No mention of her as kings daughter or sister anywhere in the record. And the idea of three first cousin marriages resulting in her birth seems quite a lot of first cousin marriages, just to make it possible, perhaps? I also have a trouble buying the idea Nefertiti, even if closely related to Tiye, ending up with her. With her own daughter/s, yes. With her mother in law? Not so sure.\n\nBut KV21A and Tut may be parents of the babies in KV62. And KV55 and KV35 (Akhenaten! and Beketaten?) are parents of Tut. So KV21B (Nefertiti?) would be step mother of Tut.\n\nThen why does KV35YL get murdered? I'm in two minds still as to if her facial injury is pre or post-mortem. It seems to me to be the majority opinion nowadays she was murdered or injured somehow while alive, only to die from said injury. What do I know? Maybe that's right. (Not like I haven't guessed wrong before! ) So, I'll run with it...\n\nIf MV35YL is sister of Akhenaten, and mother of his son, Tut, then might she have been done away with? Quietly. Then mummified. Or KV35YL had a serious accident involving a horse or a chariot... I'm thinking she's Beketaten in this scenario btw. I usually come back to her sooner or later. Why would her mummy be maliciously damaged after death? But as to possible foul play, as a rival to Nefertiti, I can think of just one suspect.\n\nAs you probably know by now ( ) Nefertiti, for mine, after the death of Akhenaten becomes sole ruler after adopting the name, Smenkhkare. She rules for long enough as Smenkhkare to have a vineyard changed to her name, and a couple of scarabs made with Smenkhkare djeserkhperure on them. And a scene started in Meryre II's tomb with Meritaten depicted as a GRW... nothing else confirmed, I'm afraid.\n\nAre the pieces continuing to fall into place?\n\nNB I d wonder, however, if KV21B might actually be Mutemwiya. And KV21A not mother of those babies after all, though related.\n\nThe draft of Smenkhkare and Mery[t]aten in the tomb of Meryre [II] looks like the result of a Royal order: stop! We move!\n\nAnd the scene can suggest that: Smenkhkare was moving and as a last act in Akhetaten he [or she] rewarded the treasurer.\n\nYes, I do appreciate the argument. It's just that among the many theories concerning the end of Amarna is the one that Amarna continued to exist many years after the death of Akhenaten. Proof of this, in part, was suggested to have been evidence of extensions to Aten temples by Horemheb, and Seti I.\n\nA distinction has been made concerning the broken talitat used as fill in many religious works in Thebes (Karnak), that on close inspection the designs now evident from the talitat suggest they came from palaces, not temples. The thinking now was explained as the perceived damnation memoria was targeted more against the palaces than temples, meaning the mutilation against temples was limited to the removal of names & reliefs.\n\nA sudden cessation is what I see, though the cause is still open.\n\nAs far as a date goes, some tombs carry inscriptions showing the Aten name in the early form (Panehesy, Ahmes, Pentu, etc.) but others the late form (Meryre, Meryre II, Huya, Mahu, etc.). It's just unfortunate historians cannot agree whether this change occurred in yr 8, or yr 10-12?\n\nThe reference to yr 12 in some tombs may not be the current year but a scene reflecting on past events. Though the tomb of Meryre II does show late period Aten names. A yr 12 date is scene in another tomb(s?). I wonder if those also carry late period Aten names too?\n\nYes, I do appreciate the argument.

I wonder if those also carry late period Aten names too?\n\nRegards the city itself, I have seen no arguments against it still operating. It is the issue of religion and the afterlife that seems to be behind the cessation of work in the tombs. The religious life seems to have returned to Thebes as a main centre of the royal cults. I think the city itself began to die because the old centres of Memphis and Thebes enticed those who had long lived there, probably for many generations, to return. Especially those who were direct beneficiaries of royal circles. Also, the use of Akhetaten as more or less a quarry for ready made building material probably kept many workers and their families there for a quite long period. So, while the tombs of the royals and highest nobles were abandoned quite abruptly, life among the lower nobility and lowest classes, maybe some among the highest nobility, went on for quite awhile.\n\nYes, I do appreciate the argument.

I wonder if those also carry late period Aten names too?\n\nAkhetaten kept on existing for some years after the death of Akhenaten. The point is that probably it had lost its importance [and its status of a kind of Holy Land] and the nobles were no more interested to have a tomb there. Was this a progressive process connected with the decline of the figure of Neferkheperure? Or the already mentioned solar eclipse persuaded them that Akhenaten's way wasn't the right one?\n\nI intuit that between the death of Neferneferuaten Smenkhkare and Ay we have the reign of the boy king, Tut. I am confident there is no shock in that statement! Though some might put it to a democratic vote and say those who think Neferneferuaten and Smenkhkare have the numbers!

Though the similarity of throne names, and the problem of who Nebkheper-u-Re was, leaves the question open for me. Who was he? Where does he fit?\n\nWe can start from a point: Tut was too young to have imposed himself to the Palace [like Ay and Horemheb did later].\n\nThis means that he had to be a natural heir [suitably young to be controlled by Maya, Ay and Horemheb].\n\nThe speculations about the identity of his mother and his father should consider this aspect: at least the mother had to be Royal.\n\nThe option are:\n\n* A Great Royal Wife \"in the office\", so Nefertiti.\n\n* A Great Royal Wife no more \"in the office\", so a woman like Sitamun or an other sister of Akhenaten who got married with Nebmaatre Amenhotep.\n\n* The daughter of a Monarch carrying the title of \"Hereditary Princess\".\n\n* The granddaughter of a Monarch carrying the title of \"Hereditary Princess\".\n\nObviously if the father was Akhenaten, the status of the mother wasn't so important for a politically chosen very young Sovereign.\n\nWe can start from a point: Tut was too young to have imposed himself to the Palace [like Ay and Horemheb did later].\n\nThis means that he had to be a natural heir [suitably young to be controlled by Maya, Ay and Horemheb].\n\nThe speculations about the identity of his mother and his father should consider this aspect: at least the mother had to be Royal.\n\nThe option are:\n\n* A Great Royal Wife \"in the office\", so Nefertiti.\n\n* A Great Royal Wife no more \"in the office\", so a woman like Sitamun or an other sister of Akhenaten who got married with Nebmaatre Amenhotep.\n\n* The daughter of a Monarch carrying the title of \"Hereditary Princess\".\n\n* The granddaughter of a Monarch carrying the title of \"Hereditary Princess\".\n\nObviously if the father was Akhenaten, the status of the mother wasn't so important for a politically chosen very young Sovereign.\n\nThe mother seems to be KV35YL as most likely, Tut's father being Akhenaten (KV55). Tut would then be the son of a full princess, daughter of Amenophis III and Tiye, though she was not GRW*. Tut's ascendancy to the throne would not have seemed in any doubt. But Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten for mine was Coregent and then sole ruler, during which time, perhaps immediately, she became Smenkhkare. Was Tut coruler, as in the case of Hatshetsup and Thutmose III? Was he to become sole ruler at a time of Nefertiti's choosing, or on her death? With Ankhkheperure dead, then Mayati's role as mistress of the House, important enough to be mentioned in the Amarna Letters, where Nefertiti had not been, seems worthy of note. Tiye was still important in the early years of Akhenaten. As I said, Meritaten was senior royal female. Her mention on the Letters tells us she was a player at the top. I suggest, also influenced and advised by Ay, Maya and Horemheb. [Incidentally, Ankhsenpaaten isn't mentioned in the Letters either. So why is Meritaten mentioned in her role as Mistress the House? I suspect because she had some major role in Tut's early reign. Following in the footsteps of many 'senior' females in the dynasty]?\n\n*As has been often speculated, not just by me, Beketaten was at Akhetaten, was important somehow, and, in my view, was not born 'Beketaten'. One of Akhenaten's known sisters, but under a different name, would seem to be a logical candidate. I know we discussed other family relationships for Beketaten, but I still think that her being the daughter of Amenophis III and Tiye seems the best bet.\n\nI would folks to read: 'Shalmaiati, Maiati' Eric Aitchison and Donald Keith Mills [Academia].\n\nIt considers a few things, including debunking a translations by Vellicovski, but what I would draw your attention to is the subject matter on Mayati-Meritaten. I find it really instructive. The essay mentions Meritaten as a daughter and as a queen, but I think we might see her just as readily as I described her above, as a GRW kind of figure, like Tiye was very early on in Akhenaten's reign. To see her as queen might seem odd as wife of Akhenaten (or even a male Smenkhkare). No wives are put in front except Tiye, as mentioned, when she still seems yo have had some authority or influence over Akhenaten. Meritaten would not seem to have had the same authority or influence over Akhenaten (or Smenkhkare), but perhaps she would have over a young Tut. Mayati us referred to as daughter. But she is also in different letters referred to as Mistress of the House, not wife. This new reminds me of a title of Nefertiti's, 'Mistress of the Two Lands', (not in a foreign letter btw). which seems to be a way of saying queen and wife to me. But does Mistress of the House in a foreigners letter conjure up the same idea? Why not just say 'wife'? Is Mistress of the House a regent figure? Like other senior women of the dynasty before her? I can't cut and paste the most relevant sections, but the whole thing anyway is worth a read IMO.\n\nIt's difficult to say when the solar eclipse happened with reference to the regnal year of Akhenaten.\n\nWe know it happened on May 14th 1337 (1338 according to how we consider the calendar).\n\nWhen did Akhenaten begin to reign?\n\nLet's be a bit naive and let's consider Wiki ...\n\n1353 BCE? The eclipse happened in year 16 or 17. A bit late.\n\n1351 BCE? The eclipse happened in year 14 or 15. Still a bit late.\n\nBut many be not so late: it can be a year 13 as well. And this could make sense.\n\nThe tomb of Meryra is odd. The representations can be from a late period as well.\n\nI will be back to the work about that tomb.\n\nAs has been raised by you guys, the Durbar could be looked back to. Potentially, from any time before the tomb work was abandoned. Does the eclipse trigger Nefertiti's gestures regards the Amunists while Akhenaten retires to pray?\n\nCan I mention my last post posted a moment ago, #1372. I think it might be worth some of your time to read the essay I mention in it.\n\nEdit: A particular point of interest to me is the idea of the male and female in the essay. In EA155 Mayati is sometimes referred to with a male honorific, so to speak, because she was too important to be addressed in all contexts as a mere woman (like Hatshetsup in a mentioned example). That might mean more important than just a queen, thinking about all Wickerman and my discussions of 'ruler' not gender, if that makes sense.\n\n... I would also wonder what year of reign does the solar eclipse occur? If we are referring to the apparent solar event in Huya's tomb, is it before the Durbar or afterward?\n\nGiven that we have no obvious indicators.\n\nAnother question might help us decide what is the more likely.\n\n1 - Would we accept the creation of Amarna was in response to where an eclipse occurred, or\n\n2 - Would we prefer that the creation of Amarna was because 'they' knew an eclipse was imminent?\n\nWhile both are possible, an eclipse of 1338 BC must have occurred in the reign of Amenhotep III. Which then suggests a considerable shift in chronology of 20+ years.\n\nThe 2nd choice requires us to accept the Egyptians could predict eclipses. Amenhotep III built temples to Aten in the south, one at Soleb, and in 1351 BC, within his reign, there was a total solar eclipse in the Sudan, visible at Soleb. Which might suggest the Egyptians knew about eclipses and where they might be expected. This in turn then adds weight to option 2.\n\nBoth Amenhotep III & Akhenaten were promoting the Aten before Amarna was built, as they both knew about the 1351 BC eclipse, then they might have calculated the next occurrence would be further north, and Akhenaten took the initiative to build city in anticipation of the event.\n\nIf Akhenaten decides to change the name of Aten, which we know he did, then the eclipse event is possibly a good reason to do this. Something like the Aten being born again?\n\nA majority of scholars think this change took place between his year 8 and yr 12. The Durbar then, carrying the date of yr 12, just might be this huge celebration involving foreign dignitaries, of the return of the Sun following the eclipse?\n\nIf we translate the meanings of the old Aten names, and the new Aten names, might there be a clue by way of a reference to returning 'light'?\n\nOld Name - The Living Re-Horakhty, who rejoices in the horizon in his name Shu/Sunshine who/which is in the Aten.\n\nNew Name - The Living Re, ruler of the horizon, who rejoices in the horizon in his name of Re/Light which comes in the Aten.\n\nThere is nothing obvious that jumps out, but it is also true to say that any translations that have been applied were not considered as a reactance to a total solar eclipse, and we know meanings of many hieroglyphic words are not fixed.\n\nHowever, we might ask, why emphasize that the Aten is the \"ruler of the horizon\" - in comparison with what?\n\nThe Moon?\n\nWas there a 'battle' between the Sun & the Moon, and the Aten won?\n\nRegardless, it would take time to plan this international celebration. Invitations would need to be sent out, and replies received. It may take months to a year to arrange such a large celebration.\n\nPerhaps a date for this eclipse of 1338 BC falls between yr 8, and yr 12?\n\nGiven that we have no obvious indicators.\n\nAnother question might help us decide what is the more likely.\n\n1 - Would we accept the creation of Amarna was in response to where an eclipse occurred, or\n\n2 - Would we prefer that the creation of Amarna was because 'they' knew an eclipse was imminent?\n\nWhile both are possible, an eclipse of 1338 BC must have occurred in the reign of Amenhotep III. Which then suggests a considerable shift in chronology of 20+ years.\n\nI wonder if the eclipse was the very 'bad' thing. Or, as I thought to ask myself yesterday, was Amenophis's III death that 'bad' thing? Or, even, did Amenophis III's death coincide with the Eclipse? There is a view among some that Akhenaten saw his father as become the Aten. I think Amenophis called himself the Dazzling Disc. Also, he has a building by the same name. Predictions of an eclipse? Is Amenophis IV's first hebsed the first after Amenophis III (his father) becomes one with the Aten (his father)?\n\nThe 2nd choice requires us to accept the Egyptians could predict eclipses. Amenhotep III built temples to Aten in the south, one at Soleb, and in 1351 BC, within his reign, there was a total solar eclipse in the Sudan, visible at Soleb. Which might suggest the Egyptians knew about eclipses and where they might be expected. This in turn then adds weight to option 2.\n\nBoth Amenhotep III & Akhenaten were promoting the Aten before Amarna was built, as they both knew about the 1351 BC eclipse, then they might have calculated the next occurrence would be further north, and Akhenaten took the initiative to build city in anticipation of the event.\n\nIf eclipses could be predicted, then perhaps the death of Amenophis III could yet be that 'bad' thing, his father's death coinciding with the eclipse?\n\nIf Akhenaten decides to change the name of Aten, which we know he did, then the eclipse event is possibly a good reason to do this. Something like the Aten being born again?\n\nA majority of scholars think this change took place between his year 8 and yr 12. The Durbar then, carrying the date of yr 12, just might be this huge celebration involving foreign dignitaries, of the return of the Sun following the eclipse?\n\nIf we translate the meanings of the old Aten names, and the new Aten names, might there be a clue by way of a reference to returning 'light'?\n\nMaybe the Huya scene looks back to the beginning of the new cult? The decision to promote the Aten even further, a major step on from the beliefs of Thutmose III and Amenophis III?\n\nOld Name - The Living Re-Horakhty, who rejoices in the horizon in his name Shu/Sunshine who/which is in the Aten.\n\nNew Name - The Living Re, ruler of the horizon, who rejoices in the horizon in his name of Re/Light which comes in the Aten.\n\nThere is nothing obvious that jumps out, but it is also true to say that any translations that have been applied were not considered as a reactance to a total solar eclipse, and we know meanings of many hieroglyphic words are not fixed.\n\nHowever, we might ask, why emphasize that the Aten is the \"ruler of the horizon\" - in comparison with what?\n\nThe Moon?\n\nWas there a 'battle' between the Sun & the Moon, and the Aten won?\n\nRegardless, it would take time to plan this international celebration. Invitations would need to be sent out, and replies received. It may take months to a year to arrange such a large celebration.\n\nPerhaps a date for this eclipse of 1338 BC falls between yr 8, and yr 12?\n\nPerhaps the 'battle' was between Amun (the Hidden One) and Aten (the one who is seen)?\n\nEdit: I find it hard to think that the Huya scene addresses anything but a major event. I can't help thinking the ancient Egyptians weren't aware of eclipses, whether or not they could predict them. So is it fair to imagine some other major event/incident occurring at the time of the eclipse that Huya seems to record?\n\nI have decided to plunge deep into Huya's tomb by reading Davies' account and viewing his drawings.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed is sometimes I have often noticed, many scholars of his generation could write with such elegance and lucidity, which for me are the telling marks of intelligence and rationality, including noting his acute observatory powers. The second thing I notice - or come across - is Davies assertion about Tiye's 'visit' to Akhenaten. Here we are in the area of speculation, and I instantly disagree with Davies, lol!\n\nI have for as long as I can remember thought Tiye moved to Akhetaten very early on. As soon as accommodation suitable for a Queen Mother to live in according to her status and royal needs. Huya's tomb itself tells me he got to work early and accompanied his mistress as soon as humanly possible along with her entire household. When Akhenaten leads her into that temple - Davies suggests her sunshade temple as part of a larger temple, who am I to disagree? - he is leading his mother into the sunshade she will pray in and possibly lead rituals in, as a resident of the city. Little Beketaten, for mine, arrived with her, very early on. How old little Beketaten is, I have no idea. But the absence of her (older?) sisters is interesting. Why didn't they arrive with the move, whether in Tiye's household or with Akhenaten's harem?\n\nAnyway, I've only just begun. I'm most curious about that eclipse! But I want to examine the tomb in its fullest context. Reading Davies is like going to the horses mouth.\n\nConsider reading: ROCK TOMBS OF EL AMARNA,. PART III. Davies. Page 15-16.\n\nI think we see that Beketaten is most likely the daughter of Amenophis III and Tiye. Just as Nefertiti is often recorded as mother of Akhenaten's daughters, here we see Tiye recorded as mother of Beketaten, daughter of Amenophis.\n\nDavies takes an interesting stance on the Coregency. For him, in a sense, what we see in Thebes is Tiye for a time effectively acting in a Coregency with her son, representing her dead husband. She certainly seems to me to have been a regent of sorts at Thebes. And then early on - when Akhetaten is sufficiently built to habituate a Queen Mother - Tiye moves to Amarna with her household. Akhenaten has his own household well and truly by then, and his own GRW. There are by then two: Tiye and Nefertiti.\n\nIt's interesting how Huya records his service under both Nebmaatre and Neferkheperure. We see a transition having occurred, but Akhenaten has not ordered the eradication of the past. And Beketaten renains an important princess in the eyes, at least, of Tiye and Huya. Beketaten's other sisters surely did not come to Akhetaten. Why? Already dead?\n\nHuya's tomb is really interesting. He remembered both the Royal couples in several occasions.\n\nFor example, the inscription in the shrine [The rock tombs of El Amarna .. : Davies, Norman de Garis, 1865-1941 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive] shows the cartouches of Neferkheperure Akhenaten, of Nefertiti and of Nebmaatre and Tiye. You have posted the depiction of the two couples where Tiye and Beketaten seem to say good bye to Nebmaatre Amenhotep. We cannot exclude Huya saw that scene, when Amenhotep remained at Malkata to divinize himself ..."
