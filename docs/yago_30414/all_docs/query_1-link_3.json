        "text": "The Pharaoh Thutmose IV, who ruled during ancient Egypt famous 18th Dynasty, is probably most famous for his “Dream Stele, that can still today be found between the paws of the great Sphinx at Giza. Dreams were important in ancient Egypt and were considered to be divine predictions of the future. In Thutmose IV’s “Dream Stele”, he tells us that, while out on a hunting trip, he fell asleep in the shadow of the Sphinx (or apparently, the shadow of the Sphinx’s head, for the monument was apparently buried in sand at the time). In the young prince’s sleep, Re-Harakhte, the sun god embodied in the Sphinx, came to him in a dream and promised that if he would clear away the sand that engulfed the monument, Thutmose would become king of Egypt.\n\nIn part, the stele reads:\n\n“Now the statue of the very great Khepri (the Great Sphix) restin in this place, great of fame, sacred of respect, the shade of Ra resting on him. Memphis and every city on its two sides came to him, their arms in adoration to his face, bearing great offerings for his ka. One of these days it happened that price Thutmose came travelling at the time of midday. He rested in the shadow of the great god. (Sleep and) dream (took possession of me) at the moment the sun was at zenith. Then he found the majesty of this noble god speaking from his own mouth like a father speaks to his son, and saying, ‘Look at me, observe me, my son Thutmose. I am your father, Horemakhet-Khepri-Ra-Atum. I shall give to you the kingship (upon the land before the living)…(Behold, my condition is like one in illness), all (my limbs being ruined). The sand of the desert, upon which I used to be, (now) confronts me; and it is in order to cause that you do what is in my heart that I have waited.”\n\nObviously, the prince carried out these instructions, and thus became the eighth ruler of the ancient Egypt’s 18th Dynasty.\n\nThutmose IV’s name means, “Born of the God Thoth”. His throne name was Men-kheperu-re, meaning “Everlasting are the Manifestations of Re”. We can also find references to him under the names of Thuthmose IV, Thutmosis IV, and Djehutymes IV. He ruled Egypt between 1419 and 1386 BC. He was apparently the son of Amenhotep II by his wife, Tiaa, but Egyptologists speculate whether, because of the wording of the “Dream Stele”, his claim on the Egyptian throne was legitimate. In fact, other evidence supports this contention. His father, Amenhotep II, never recognized Thutmose as a co-regent, or announced any intent for Thutmose to succeed him.\n\nWe know that Thutmose IV was probably married to Mutemwiya, who produced his heir to the throne, Amenhotep III, though he never acknowledged her as either a major or minor queen. It is possible, though now doubted by some, that she was the daughter of he Mitannian king, Artatama, who sent his daughter to the Egyptian court as part of a diplomatic exchange. Other of his wives included Merytra, who we believe later changed her name to Tiaa (same as his mother’s name) and a non-royal wife, Nefertiry. He probably also married one of his sisters named Iaret.\n\nLength of Reign\n\nDating the beginning of the reign of Thutmose IV is difficult to do with certainty because he is several generations removed from the astronomical dates which are usually used to calculate Egyptian chronologies, and the debate over the proper interpretation of these observances has not been settled. Thutmose’s grandfather Thutmose III almost certainly acceded the throne in either 1504 or 1479, based upon two lunar observances during his reign. After ruling for nearly 54 years, Amenhotep II, Thutmose IV’s father, took the throne and ruled for at least 26 years, but has been assigned up to 35 years in some chronological reconstructions. The currently preferred reconstruction, after analyzing all this evidence, usually comes to an accession date around 1401 BC or 1400 BC for the beginning of Thutmose IV’s reign.\n\nThe length of his reign is not as clear as one would wish. He is usually given about nine or ten years of reign. Manetho credits him a reign of 9 Years and 8 Months. However, Manetho’s other figures for the 18th Dynasty are frequently assigned to the wrong kings or simply incorrect, so monumental evidence is also used to determine his reign length. Of all of Thutmose IV’s dated monuments, three date to his first regnal year, one to his fourth, possibly one to his fifth, one to his sixth, two to his seventh, and one to his eighth. Two possible other dated objects, one dated to a Year 19 and another year 20, have been suggested as belong to him, but neither have been accepted as dating to his reign. The reading of the king in these dates are today accepted as referring to the prenomen of Thutmose III, Menkheperre and not Menkhepe[ru]re Thutmose IV himself. Due to the absence of higher dates for Thutmose IV after his Year 8 Konosso stela, Manetho’s figures here are usually accepted. There were once chronological reconstructions which gave him a reign as long as 34-35 years. Today, however, most scholars ascribe give him a 10 year reign from 1401 to 1391 BC, within a small margin of error.\n\nThutmose IV is not the best documented of Egyptian pharaohs. We actually know very little about him in comparison to others of this dynasty. Little military action appears to have occurred during his reign, although our knowledge may be marred by the lack of texts. We do know that there was a Nubian campaign in Year 8 of his rule, and that apparently there were also campaigns in Syria. However, even though the king is referred to twice as the “conqueror of Syria”, these may have actually been little more then policing actions, rather than full scale battles.\n\nLittle is also known of his building work. Thutmose IV did finish a giant obelisk that was originally quarried at Aswan under Thutmose III, his grandfather. At 32 meters (105 feet) it was the tallest Egyptian obelisk that we know of, and was uniquely intended to stand as a single obelisk at the Temple of Karnak. Most of the obelisks were usually erected in pairs. However, Thutmose III originally intended for there to be a pair of these Obelisks. Its counterpart developed a fault during the quarry process, and remains today joined to the bed-rock at Aswan. Today, the finished obelisk stands outside St. John Leteran in Rome, rather then in Egypt.\n\nHe also began work work at most of Egypt’s major temple sites and four sites in Nubia, but almost all of this was simply adding to existing monuments. Most of his work was adding to the temples of his father and grandfather, and perhaps suggesting new sites and monuments to his son.\n\nWe know of his minor building projects in the following locations:\n\nThe Delta at Alexandria — Seriakus — Heliopolis (possibly) — Giza — Abusir — Saqqara — Memphis — Crocodilopos in the Fayoum — Hermopolis — Amarna — Abydos (a chapel) — Dendera — Medamud — Karnak — Luxor — The West Bank at Luxor (his tomb and mortuary temple) — Armant — Tod — Elkab — Edfu — Elephantine — Konosso\n\nIn Nubia at the following locations:\n\nFaras — Buhen — Amada (where he decorated the peristyle court) — Tabo — Gebel Barkal (a foundation deposit)\n\nHe also provided some decorations in the Hathor temple at the Serabit el-Khadim turquoise mines in the Sinai."
