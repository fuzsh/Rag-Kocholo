        "text": "It is thought that upon the death of Amenhotep II a brief power struggle took place amongst his surviving sons (the eldest and heir to the throne had already predeceased his father). The main piece of evidence looked upon for this belief is the 'Sphinx Dream Stela', in this Tuthmosis IV relates how he fell asleep between the paws of the Great Sphinx and dreamed. In his dream the sphinx promised the young prince the crown of Egypt if he would clear the sand from around the sphinx that the desert winds has blown across. If the young Tuthmosis was the heir to the throne he would not of needed the help of the sphinx to secure it, the stela does suggest that there was competition amongst the princes (another son of Amenhotep II, Prince Webensenu, had stelae dedicated by him defaced, his canopic jars and shabtis were found in KV35 which would suggest that he was of some importance. However, it is not possible to be certain if the defacement of Webensenu's stelaes were part of a power struggle let alone if Tuthmosis IV was the culprit).\n\nBuilding program\n\nAlthough he enjoyed only a brief reign of 9 years (** - the dates abov relate to 'Chronicle of the Pharaohs' by P. Clayton - but it should be noted that the length of reign given here is the more accepted length - see 'Oxford History of Ancient Egypt' by I Shaw), Tuthmosis IV wasted no time in setting about major building projects. Surviving monuments from his reign have been found throughout Egypt:\n\nForeign relations\n\nFollowing the successes of his father and grandfather, Tuthmosis IV inheritated a wealthy and peaceful country. The Mitanni who had plagued Egypt years previously were now at peace - this peace was emphasised by the marriage of Tuthmosis IV to Artatama, the daughter of the Mitanni n ruler.\n\nOnly very brief campaigns were undertaken by Egypt in this period; a city in Syria (thought to have been possibly Qatna or Sidon), and possible action against some towns in southern Palestine.\n\nOfficials of Tuthmosis IV\n\nAmenemope - Vizier - TT29\n\nSennefer - Mayor of Thebes (brother to Amenemope, TT29) - TT96\n\nQenamun - Steward of the Royal Palace at Memphis - TT98\n\nKaemheryibsen - 3rd Prophet of Amun (brother to Qenamun) - TT98\n\nMeri and Amenemhat - Chief Priests of Amun - TT97\n\nMenkheperraseneb - Chief of the Granaries - TT79\n\nUserhat - Royal Scribe and Tutor - TT56\n\nKha - TT8\n\nNebamun - Standard Bearer - TT90\n\nThe Tomb and mummy of Tuthmosis IV\n\nTuthmosis IV was buried in the Valley of the Kings - KV43 - which was discovered by Howard Carter in 1903. The tomb had been robbed in antiquity, two graffiti in the tomb give the dates of restoration (by the official Maya and his assistant Djehutymose) during the reign of Horemheb. The King's body had been moved to KV35 for safety by High Priests of the 21st Dynasty, the tomb did still contain a large amount of funerary furniture, ushabtis, provisions of food and a chariot."
