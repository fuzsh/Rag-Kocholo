        "text": "Amenhotep III, king of Egypt (1386-1349 BC), of the 18th Dynasty, builder of extensive architectural works, including portions of the temple of Luxor and the so-called Colossi of Memnon. His reign was one of peace and prosperity, when Egyptian power was at its height. Amenhotep's diplomatic correspondence is preserved in the Amarna Letters, a collection of some 400 clay tablets found in Tall al 'Amarinah in 1887. Akhenaton, Egypt's great religious reformer, was his son.\n\n\"Amenhotep III,\" Microsoft(R) Encarta(R) 98 Encyclopedia. (c) 1993-1997 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n\n-------\n\nThe ninth king of the 18th dynasty was the son of Thutmose IV and Queen Mutemwiya. He married Tiy, daughter of Yuya, who was a chancellor of the north and was a priest of Hermonthis and Amon. Egypt was enjoying a peaceful time during Amenhotepâs reign, thus allowing him to concentrate on more artistic renewals. He married daughters of foreign kings, including a Mitanni princess and one from Babylon. This solidified his international standings. During his reign he enlarged many temples. He built Malkata on the western shore of Thebes, south of Medinet Habu. This complex was a miniature city with offices, houses, chambers, chapels and apartments. Close to Malkata he built a lake for his queen. Next to the lake he built a palace for his harem and a palace for Queen Tiy. He built the famous Colossi of Memnon and is accredited with building the Temple of Luxor. Amenhotep spent years improving Karnak, by adding temples and a row of sphinxes that linked it to the temple of Amon at Luxor. Amenhotep died in his mid fifties. His heir was the infamous Akhenaten."
