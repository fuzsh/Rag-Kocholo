        "text": "I would say no, but Kiya is a fascinating figure in all of this. I am certain she was a woman, because she had 2 daughters depicted with her and Akhenaten. We don't know their names except that one apparently ended in \"-aten\". Depictions of Kiya have the Aten name in its earlier form, so she must have been out of the picture before year 9 - definitely out of the picture by year 12. Not impossible that one of her daughters was Baketaten, as this princess was a king's daughter but not named as a daughter of Nefertiti or Tiye. At Amarna the princesses normally have their mother named.\n\nAs for Kiya's background we have no clue at all. I can buy that she was Tadukhipa who was married to Amenhotep IV after her intended husband Amenhotep III died.\n\nThere is a male depicted in the works at Amarna that does not appear to be Akhenaten or Tutankhamun - some of the images you have posted point to that. The thing is, whoever he is he seems to be part of the royal family due to the resemblance to Tiye and Tutankhamun in particular. We know from KV40 that Amenhotep III had a big family and we are learning more about that all the time. It is plausible that there was a younger brother of Akhenaten - or a son born to him early in the reign - that could be Smenkhkare. Not impossible that if this was the case Smenkhkare could be the son of Kiya and Akhenaten. Certainly a son of his would be ranked above a brother in the succession, and explain why Tut did not come to the throne first, even if a baby. Smenkhkare being a son of Kiya would account for the resemblance you propose as well as him looking like Akhenaten, Tiye and Tutankhamun, who would be his younger half brother (most likely).\n\nThere is the possibility that YL is Kiya which however is considered a weak theory because she is not listed anywhere as a royal daughter. But if one assumes that Sitamun, i.e. the only daughter of Amenhotep III and Tiye, which is still documented in the Amarna period, changed her name and titles and assumed the identity of Kiya, then things look quite different. But why should she have changed her name and title? Theoretically, because an heir to the throne was desired, which neither Nefertiti (6 daughters with Akhenaten) nor Tiye (possibly 1 incestuous daughter with Akhenaten) was able to provide, and which was now expected from Sitamun, if she gave up her title as a daughter of Amenhotep III and was willing to pass as Great Beloved of Akhenaten, which means a nominal deterioration of her status, but gives her the chance to become the mother of the next king. She could not be called the Great Royal Wife of Akhenaten, since this title had already been given to Nefertiti. Concerning the name, a change would have been necessary anyway, because Akhenaten as the suppressor of the cult of Amun could not accept the name part \"Amun\". So theoretically, she could have renamed herself to \"Sitaton\" to appear as the new Great Beloved of Akhenaten (as vice versa Tut renamed herself from \"Tutankhaten\" to \"Tutankhamun\" to accommodate the angry priests of Amun). But instead, according to the theory, she was renamed to \"Kiya\", which is pronounced 'kiye' and means \"little monkey\", thus being a pet name. Of course, one can object that a nickname is not a worthy name for a future royal mother, so this is the weakest point in this theory. On the other hand, Cyril Aldred has already pointed out that \"Kiya\" phonetically reminds us of the names of the Yuya family (Yuya, Thuya, Tiye, Ay, Tey and - if actually Yuya's sister - the mother of Amenhotep III, Mutemwiya), so the name \"Kiya\" would be in the tradition of the maternal line of the royal house."
