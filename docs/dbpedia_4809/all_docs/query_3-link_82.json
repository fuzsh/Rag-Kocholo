        "text": "Web hosting as we know it emerged in the mid-1990s during the race to commercialize access to the Internet. This access was mostly limited to research and used mainly by academics, educational institutions, and the military. That all changed after the National Science Foundation decided to lift restrictions on the commercial use of its network in 1991. More importantly, the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW) that same year gave the public at large access to the Internet.\n\nHosting your own website was still difficult and expensive, however, since you needed to have your own server and computer to do so. By 1995, hosts such as GeoCities, Angelfire, and Tripod were offering web users free hosting which enabled people outside a small niche to have their own websites. The web hosting industry has grown exponentially in the last decade, adapting to surging demands for the service from independent creators and the e-commerce sector.\n\nWhy Host a Website?\n\nAn online presence is considered essential nowadays, but for some, just having your name online is not enough. For professionals and businesses, for example, a well-designed website has become a sign of trustworthiness and credibility. This much is evident in the 2016 Why Before the Buy study by Thrive Analytics. The study showed that 30% of consumers would not consider a business without a website, and 26% would not consider a business that offers a “poor website experience,” either.\n\nMore than a simple matter of status or reputation, then, having a website is something that directly translates to higher revenue. Businesses, in particular, stand to massively benefit from having one, given that an average 64.5% of consumers use websites to find or engage with businesses, according to the LSA’s most recent Digital Consumer Study. This is no surprise given how much time Americans are spending online—almost an entire day per week, in fact, according to the 2018 Digital Future Report.\n\nSo, businesses large and small can benefit from hosting a website. But why should someone like a freelancer invest in one? Or how about your average Joe or Jane? What’s the point in doing so?\n\nWhile not everyone will directly benefit from one, there are reasons why you should at least consider a personal website. Laurence Bradford lists three in a 2014 Forbes article, those being:\n\nYou’ll have greater control over your online image. Having a website allows you to craft an experience that shows personality, highlights your strengths, and displays your work or skills. The information that those seeking to hire you or work with you find will be in your hands.\n\nYou never know when you’ll need one. By starting your website now, you’ll be giving it—and your brand—a chance to grow. This is especially important for future freelancers and creatives. If you’re ever in a position in the future where you need a site, you’ll be ahead of the curve.\n\nIt gives you credibility. Like we mentioned, having a website in our day and age is considered a mark of trustworthiness. Additionally, employers are more likely to gravitate towards job-seekers with a website when looking at the competition.\n\nIn short, everyone could find some use for having a website, whether it’s increased revenue, professional development, or simply self-expression. Not everyone will benefit from the same type of hosting, however, which is why it helps to understand how hosting works and who each type is best for.\n\nTypes of Web Hosting\n\nShared Hosting: The most common form of web hosting, shared hosting, has been the standard in the industry since the beginning. It’s inexpensive, and it provides nearly all the basic features one could want in web hosting. When a customer “buys” shared hosting, they are allotted space in a single physical server which is populated by many other websites. This makes it somewhat unreliable, as one website suffering from a sudden burst of visitors or a malware attack could affect another—shared hosting is often maligned because of this. This type of hosting is offered by most web hosts and ranges in price from less than a dollar to upwards of $15.\n\nVPS Hosting: For many, Virtual Private Server, or VPS, hosting is the natural upgrade to shared hosting. In this type of hosting, a single physical server is still technically “shared.” However, individual “pockets”, or virtual servers, are created for each website hosted on the larger server. This grants greater privileges to users, who can tamper and play around with their server’s framework to a greater degree. It also mostly prevents one website affecting another due to large or sudden increases in bandwidth usage.\n\nCloud Hosting: What “cloud” hosting means really depends on who you ask about it. It generally refers to websites or accounts hosted on a cluster of servers. Being hosted this way is supposed to increase reliability, since if one of the servers is knocked out, a copy of your website is still present in all others. However, due to the recent popularization of cloud computing technology, the word cloud has become something of a buzzword. For example, some hosts may offer cloud hosting, but may only be using a single physical server running on the CloudLinux operating system. CloudLinux is able to provide better overall performance than regular Windows or Linux systems by compartmentalizing accounts on a single server, very much like a VPS server. However, as corporate WebHostingTalk member HostXNow_Chris says, “running CloudLinux on a single server is not cloud hosting… CloudLinux with use of CageFS/LVE manager isolates accounts from one another for security and performance reasons only.” Regardless of what is actually being described as “cloud” hosting, plans under this label generally advertise higher uptime, speeds, and freedom to adjust required resources. Overall, redundancy and scalability are the two major benefits of this type of hosting. Because of the size cloud networks can function at, cloud hosting has a wide range of price points, from prices as low as that of shared hosting, to those as high as of dedicated hosting.\n\nDedicated Hosting: Dedicated hosting is often the answer for large-scale operations and those seeking the highest level of reliability. This type of hosting grants clients the entire space of a physical framework to their accounts. Like VPS hosting, this means some level of technical expertise is required—even more so for dedicated. Hosting of this kind is some of the most expensive, but for those who can afford it—and who actually need the computing power—it can provide the peace of mind that shared, VPS, or even cloud hosting may not be able to.\n\nReseller Hosting: Reseller hosting is peculiar. Technically, it is designed for clients to repackage and sell the service they are paying for to other consumers in need of hosting, and many clients do use it this way. However, clients are also able to “resell” the hosting to themselves, essentially having multiple unique servers they can use. This grants an enormous amount of freedom at costs rivaling cloud and VPS hosting of a similar size.\n\nCollocated Hosting: Collocated hosting is usually reserved for operations that need the absolute highest level of hosting. Collocation refers to the equipment being located on the actual premises of the client who is paying for the service. They are responsible for keeping the hardware safe and operational. Otherwise, collocated hosting functions essentially the same way as dedicated hosting does.\n\nWebsite Builders vs. Web Hosting\n\nWhile looking for ways to set up your website, you might have seen the terms sitebuilder or website builder thrown around. Website builders generally function as another type of shared hosting, albeit one that is focused on ease of use and access above all. Builders provide users with a drag-and-drop interface where they can easily modify and customize their website with themes and other add-ons. This makes it ideal for those who have never hosted a website beforehand.\n\nMany traditional web hosts offer website builders. The builder itself might be proprietary or it might be an established brand such as Weebly. Sometimes the website builder is included with the host’s plans; sometimes it’s offered as its own type of plan and at a different price point. There are also companies that focus exclusively on providing consumers with a website builder.\n\nIt helps to think of a sitebuilder as a building that has just been built. You can paint it however you want and choose the furniture you’ll be filling it with, but you can’t change the structure’s fundamental framework. This lack of flexibility is the main disadvantage of using a builder: when a client needs to switch to another builder or to a traditional web host, this is often hard due to the way it is coded. This doesn’t mean website builders are a bad idea, however—not at all. Many people can benefit by opting for one of these, just as people focusing solely on ecommerce may be at a greater advantage by avoiding traditional web hosting for a strictly ecommerce alternative.\n\nChoosing an Operating System: Windows or Linux?\n\nContrary to what you might have heard, the choice between Windows and Linux has nothing to do with the terminal you’ll be using to access your website(s). Instead, it has to do with the type of software you’ll be running and how much you will be paying. The choice comes down to a single question: Do you need Windows-based software or technology and are you willing to pay more than for Linux?\n\nNinety-nine percent of the time, the answer to that question will be no. Linux hosting is the industry standard for a reason, as it fulfills the needs of the majority of web-hosting clients. The Linux family of operating systems is also free and open-source software (FOSS), which means people are encouraged to experiment and improve on the base software. This makes it easier for developers to work with the system rather than with Windows, which is proprietary or closed-source.\n\nWhat this means is that unless you need Windows-specific technology, you should probably opt for hosting on Linux or CloudLinux OS. However, on the off-chance that you actually do need Windows hosting, you’ll find that not every host is able to provide it. This is because the product serves a niche base of consumers, and is therefore more expensive.\n\nWhat to Watch out for When Looking for a Web Host\n\nAlways Read the Service-Level Agreement\n\nWhen a client and their service provider agree to certain standards in a service’s quality, that is known as a service-level agreement. SLAs are documents that detail the nature of a service and the responsibilities of all the parties involved. In the case of web hosting, an SLA establishes the specific plan a client chooses, what the host and client are responsible for, and what the client is entitled to in case of a breach in the host’s uptime guarantee, for example.\n\nA good SLA should include the type of service being provided, both the client and the provider’s duties, the process for resolving any disputes between the parties, what constitutes termination, and the provider’s refund policy, if it has one, among other things. For web hosts, consumers should look for the following keywords in their SLAs:\n\n· Uptime guarantee\n\n· Refund/Money-back guarantee policy\n\n· Frequency of automated backups\n\n· Cost of requesting backups, if any\n\n· Support hours for live support (if applicable)\n\n· Response time for support tickets\n\nNever sign up with a web host before reading their terms of service. If they do not have a service-level agreement available, contact the host and ask for a sample. Under no circumstance should anyone be engaging with businesses that are unable to provide the most standard legal agreement in the XaaS (X as a Service) industry.\n\n”Unlimited” and “Unmetered” Bandwidth\n\nServers are limited; there is no way around this. Even the largest, most robust ones have a limit to how much storage they can hold and how much bandwidth they can process. That is why “unlimited” or “unmetered” hosting is a myth.\n\nMany web hosts claim that their hosting is “unlimited” or that they won’t meter your bandwidth. While that isn’t necessarily deceptive, it’s important to understand what it means. Generally speaking, “unlimited” means that the host will place constraints on your site if it surpasses the “normal” operation of a website, a standard that’s entirely determined by each company. On one hand, unlimited hosting can be seen as an honest effort to provide every customer with room for growth and a cushion for sites that may experience a dramatic surge of visitors in a short span of time. On the other, it can also be employed as a simple marketing gimmick, a way to quickly catch a consumer’s attention. Regardless of how you look at it, it’s important to understand that no hosting—especially no shared hosting—is truly limitless.\n\nIf you are considering a web host that uses this terminology to describe their hosting, look for their terms of service. If they don’t disclose what the limitations of their “unlimited” hosting is on the features page, you’ll find it there. Read carefully.\n\nAll the Bells & Whistles...and why you don’t need them\n\nAn essential step to finding the best web hosting for you is recognizing what your needs are. Even if it’s just a few more dollars per month, paying for a substantially higher amount of storage and bandwidth than what you’re actually using is a waste of money. Unless you are absolutely sure that your website will grow exponentially in the near future, less is more.\n\nBefore looking at individual web hosts, ask yourself two questions:\n\nWhat kind of content do I want on my website? What kind of website are you building? Is it a portfolio with high-resolution pictures, paintings, or other artistic content? Is it a blog with long-format, investigative content or an outlet for fan fiction and short stories?\n\nHow popular will my website be? Are you a brick-and-mortar business with a large number of customers? An up and coming tech firm with an established base of users? Or are you a small startup, an as-of-yet unknown artist or writer who lacks a large following? Maybe you already have a website and have a modest online audience. The more visitors you have, the heavier the load will be on your web host’s servers. Additionally, some web hosts limit visits per month in their plans, forcing you to upgrade if you happen to go past that number.\n\nBy having a clear idea of what you are looking for in your mind, you will avoid paying more than you need to. More importantly, you’ll be more comfortable warding off upselling, which is sadly a very common tactic in the web hosting market. This is in part due to the technical complexity of the subject, which most consumers are not equipped to deal with."
