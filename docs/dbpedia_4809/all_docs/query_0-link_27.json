Migrations\n\nPros & Cons\n\nFAQs\n\nOur Verdict on Bluehost vs SiteGround\n\nIntroducing SiteGround\n\nFounded in 2004 in Bulgaria, SiteGround has quickly made a solid dent in the web hosting arena. It currently hosts over 2 million domains and operates with over 500 full-time staff.\n\nIt’s no surprise why WordPress.org recommends SiteGround as one of the best hosting services in today’s market.\n\nAdd to this mix SiteGround’s steadfast dedication to delivering technology crafted with care and support that clients rave about.\n\nIntroducing Bluehost\n\nBluehost is a platform I’ve employed on several of my clients’ websites. I can attest that this hosting service is a close match for SiteGround based on multiple factors.\n\nFounded in 2003 in Utah, Bluehost also powers over 2 million websites. With 750+ employees on its roster, the company has seen slightly higher levels of growth compared with SiteGround.\n\nIn 2010, they were acquired by EIG which also owns a solid portfolio of hosting companies including Hostgator and iPage.\n\nSiteGround vs Bluehost: Web Hosting Plans\n\nThe section below includes a comparison of SiteGround and Bluehost web hosting plans:\n\nSitegroundBluehost Cheap shared hosting Managed WordPress hosting Managed Woocommerce hosting Cloud Hosting VPS Dedicated Hosting\n\nInstead of traditional VPS and dedicated servers, SiteGround offers managed cloud web hosting. The latter relies on multiple servers around the world, which is an important factor that influences site speed and performance.\n\nWith the shared hosting plans, when you look at face value, there’s not much that appears to be different between Bluehost and SiteGround.\n\n1. Shared Hosting\n\nIf you sign up for a 36-month plan with Bluehost, you can maximize your money’s worth.\n\nSo we need to look beyond the promotional pricing to get a better sense of the total costs.\n\nPromotional Pricing\n\nPlanSiteGround PlansBluehost Plans Lowest Tier$5.99/month$2.95/month Middle Tier$8.99/month$5.45/month Highest Tier$14.99/month$13.95/month\n\nSiteGround’s promotional pricing is available for the first year whereas Bluehost’s is available for up to 3 years if you buy 36 months upfront.\n\nEach host requires you to pay for at least 12 months upfront.\n\nRenewal Pricing\n\nPlanSiteGround PlansBluehost Plans Lowest Tier$19.99/month$8.99/month Middle Tier$29.99/month$11.99 - $16.99/month Highest Tier$49.99/month$26.99/month\n\nBluehost is a clear winner on shared hosting if the price is a concern for you. It comes in at around half the price for both the promotional and renewal pricing rates.\n\nWinner: Bluehost\n\n2. Managed WordPress Hosting\n\nBoth Bluehost and SiteGround are recommended as top web hosts by WordPress. Both offers shared and managed WordPress hosting solutions, including e-commerce sites using Woocommerce.\n\nBoth also have straightforward WordPress installation options. SiteGround is renowned for its 1-click install method. Bluehost, on the other hand, uses a cPanel dashboard making it easy to install WordPress through there.\n\nSo if it’s down to a price-based decision for you, let’s see how they compare.\n\nPromotional Pricing Compared\n\nPlanSiteGround Wordpress PlansBluehost Wordpress Plans Lowest TierFrom $5.99/monthFrom $2.95/month Middle TierFrom $5.99/monthFrom $9.95/month Highest TierFrom $5.99/monthFrom $12.95/month\n\nRenewal Pricing Compared\n\nPlanSiteGround Wordpress PlansBluehost Wordpress Plans Lowest TierFrom $19.99/monthFrom $8.99/month Middle TierFrom $19.99/monthFrom $19.95/month Highest TierFrom $19.99/monthFrom $24.95/month\n\nSurprisingly, SiteGround comes out on top with regard to their pricing and service offerings for WordPress users.\n\nThe only instance where Bluehost works out cheaper is if you’re after shared hosting where you take on the responsibility of managing your sites. For all the managed solutions, SiteGround is more ideal.\n\nWinner: SiteGround\n\n3. Bluehost’s Dedicated & VPS Hosting vs SiteGround’s Cloud Hosting\n\nUsing Google’s Cloud Platform, SiteGround can leverage robust cloud technologies to ensure better uptime rates and more security features. Or so they say.\n\nIn a way, cloud web hosting is like a virtual private server, but not all VPS options are cloud-hosted. It can go both ways but often doesn’t.\n\nMake sure you read the fine print to know what type of server situation you’re getting into with your web host.\n\nPromotional Pricing\n\nPlanSiteGround: Cloud HostingBluehost: Dedicated HostingBluehost: VPS Hosting Lowest Tier$100/month$79.99/month$19.99/month Middle Tier$200-$300/month$99.99/month$29.99/month Highest Tier$400/month$119.99/month$59.99/month\n\nRenewal Pricing\n\nPlanSiteGround: Cloud HostingBluehost: Dedicated HostingBluehost: VPS Hosting Lowest Tier$100/month$119.99/month$29.99/month Middle Tier$200-$300/month$159.99/month$59.99/month Highest Tier$400/month$209.99/month$119.99/month\n\nUnlike SiteGround, Bluehost offers promotional pricing on their VPS and dedicated servers.\n\nDespite coming in slightly more expensive, SiteGround offers more storage and memory. They also use the Google Cloud platform to offer trusted, scalable solutions to their customers.\n\nYour site could be left behind if you are locked into a 36-month term with Bluehost just to secure lower rates. Or worse, it could suffer from performance issues that won’t meet the suggested guidelines for the best search engine optimization (SEO) practices of the future.\n\nWinner: SiteGround\n\nWe believe that state-of-the-art features and storage space offer more value when shopping for a more robust hosting solution.\n\nFeatures\n\nNow, let’s go beyond price and look at the hosting features offered by each company.\n\nWhere possible, we share the data from tests we’ve run to quantitatively prove which is the better option between SiteGround vs Bluehost.\n\n1. Ease of Use\n\nBluehost offers classic cPanel based solutions. For people just starting, it can seem a little daunting to navigate a cPanel dashboard. You can also feel overwhelmed with all the upsell offers that show up.\n\nSiteGround offers a custom dashboard with a range of intuitive 1-click features. There’s less of a learning curve even when it comes to installing SSL certificates and doing other technical tasks.\n\nWe’ve found that SiteGround is a better platform for beginners since the web hosting company has a more simplified system.\n\nBoth are fairly intuitive. If forced to pick a winner, we’re leaning toward SiteGround based on the range of 1-click install options they have.\n\nPlus, SiteGround’s dashboard isn’t loaded with a bunch of promos and offers you don’t need.\n\nWinner: SiteGround\n\n2. Speed\n\nWith website speed being among the most critical factors for user experience, it’s no surprise Google has also made it an official ranking factor.\n\nSo we put SiteGround vs Bluehost to the test to see who puts their money where their mouth is. Interestingly, Bluehost doesn’t mention loading speed as a benefit of using their service – at least not as prominently as SiteGround does.\n\nNot gonna lie; this triggered a potential red flag warning during our research process.\n\nSo we decided to run speed tests on each of the hosting company websites. Here are our findings.\n\nGT Metrix\n\nSiteGround\n\nBluehost\n\nGT Metrix PerformanceGT Metrix TTFBGT Metrix PerformanceGT Metrix TTFB Vancouver93%108ms67%559ms London72%936ms39%439ms Sydney72%269ms34%872ms\n\nPingdom\n\nSiteGround\n\nBluehost\n\nPingdom PerformancePingdom Load TimePingdom PerformancePingdom Load Time San Francisco96508ms713.41s Frankfurt96726ms712.94s Tokyo96792ms713.15s London951.79s711.5s Washington DC86720ms711.63s Sydney961.21s713.14s\n\nHands down, this one goes to SiteGround. If you’re interested to see how SiteGround compares to other hosts, check out our post on the fastest web host.\n\nWinner: SiteGround\n\n3. Uptime\n\nAny decent hosting service should pay attention to their servers’ health and ensure high uptime levels. In saying that, no host can guarantee 100% uptime.\n\nBoth SiteGround and Bluehost guarantee 99.98% uptime – which equates to around 1 hour and 45 minutes of downtime per year.\n\nIf your site is down, that leads to lower visibility and poor user experience. So we referenced a few different sources recording the actual uptime levels of both SiteGround and Bluehost.\n\nLet’s find out if they live up to their guarantees.\n\nSiteGround Uptime\n\nSince June 2019, SiteGround has experienced a total of 30 downtime events. These resulted in 175 minutes of downtime, and only 4 events took longer than 3 minutes to resolve.\n\nMost events are resolved in about 1 minute or less.\n\nWe also discovered that so far in 2021, there have only been 41 minutes of total downtime – averaging 99.99% uptime.\n\nIn 2020, we worked it out to be 99.98%, and SiteGround has upheld its guarantee in both years.\n\nBluehost Uptime\n\nUnlike SiteGround, Bluehost had fewer outages overall. However, when looking at historical data, there’s a slight decline in uptime.\n\nSince June 2019, Bluehost has only experienced 12 recorded outages. 4 of these in recent months!\n\nHere’s the data in a head-to-head format.\n\n2018 Uptime2019 Uptime2020 Uptime2021 Uptime Siteground99.98%99.98%99.9%99.99% Bluehost99.99%99.98%99.96%99.98%\n\nWe’re handing it to SiteGround only because it’s clear they are continuously working to improve their uptime when we look at historical trends.\n\nHistorically, SiteGround has experienced more outage events than Bluehost, but it seems they’ve turned things around this year.\n\nWinner: SiteGround\n\n4. Customer Support\n\nCustomer service is what makes a web host more reliable.\n\nTo compare the level of customer support between these two hosting providers, we turned to Trustpilot. You can access Bluehost’s page here[1] and SiteGround’s here[2].\n\nBluehost Support\n\nBluehost’s rating on Trustpilot\n\nSiteGround’s Support\n\nSiteGround’s rating on Trustpilot\n\nSiteGround’s support is excellent as reflected by customer feedback. The web hosting provider has more than adequate staff to address clients’ needs and concerns.\n\nWinner: SiteGround\n\n5. CDN\n\nTo help deliver your content to audiences worldwide, hosting companies rely on content delivery networks (CDN). CDN providers help make content distribution more efficient and can also help cut down loading times significantly.\n\nBetween SiteGround and Bluehost, both offer a free CDN service.\n\nAs far as the best free CDN service available, Cloudflare is firmly in the lead. Offering incredibly fast content delivery for both static and dynamic content, Cloudflare can help businesses reach global audiences without sacrificing the loading speed of their websites.\n\nIt is advisable to employ a website that uses a CDN to protect content and improve security of your site.\n\nBluehost uses the SiteLock CDN service, but it’s also possible for customers to access Cloudflare for free through the cPanel dashboard. Compared to Cloudflare, SiteLock leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nSiteGround uses Cloudflare CDN and can distribute your content to over 23 data centers around the world.\n\nIt’s a tie since both hosts offer the same feature for free. Although Bluehost doesn’t use Cloudflare CDN out of the box, it is still easily accessible and available for free to their customers.\n\nWinner: Draw\n\n6. Servers & Locations\n\nFor anyone targeting audiences in a specific location, it’s worth looking at where your website’s servers are located.\n\nThe locations of Bluehosts’s data centers are unclear on their website. So we reached out to support and confirmed they are only available in Utah, US.\n\nIf your audience is primarily based in the US, there’s no issue for you. Paired with a CDN, you can still easily distribute your content all over the world.\n\nIf your audience is not primarily based in the US, SiteGround offers more flexibility due to the 6 locations of their data centers around the world.\n\nThey currently have servers located in:\n\nSiteGround has also chosen its current server locations after a long process of careful investigation. They are very deliberate in choosing the data centers they work with.\n\nIn addition to this, SiteGround’s team continuously monitors, upgrade and secure all their servers in-house. Their in-house team of server engineers and system administrators is responsible for the solutions offered to their customers.\n\nWinner: SiteGround due to the larger range of options for server locations and their unrelenting focus on quality.\n\n7. Storage\n\nFor anyone with a media-heavy website, such as an e-commerce site, storage will be a big factor for you to consider. Every WordPress site with large images or videos on it needs a place to store these files.\n\nWhen comparing the shared plans between SiteGround and Bluehost, Bluehost comes out on top with a few options, including unlimited SSD storage.\n\nBut (and this is a HUGE but) “unlimited” is not quite what you think it means. Every SSD drive has a limit to how much data it can physically hold. When sharing your plan with other sites, your portion gets even smaller.\n\nSo even though Bluehost advertises unlimited storage, it’s never really going to be the reality for anyone. In saying that, SiteGround caps the storage space on its plans, with the largest plan offering up to 40GB.\n\nWinner: Bluehost since there is no hard limit on the storage and they can host unlimited sites.\n\n8. Security\n\nWe delved deep into our research on this topic, and here’s what we found:\n\nBluehostSiteGround Free SSL CertificateYes (Let’s Encrypt)Yes (Let’s Encrypt, pre-installed) Hotlink ProtectionYesYes Spam ProtectionYes (Akismet)Yes Auto BackupsYes (Daily)Yes (Daily) Web Application FirewallYesYes DDoS ProtectionYesYes Brute Force ProtectionYesYes Bot BlockingYesYes Malware ProtectionYes (Daily Automated)Yes 24/7 Server MonitoringNoYes WP Security PluginNoYes (Free)\n\nWinner: SiteGround\n\nThey take security very seriously and have their team crafting custom solutions around the clock to ensure their customers are well looked after.\n\nGoing beyond the free SSL certificate, they ensure that every site has an SSL installed. WordPress sites also have the advantage of using a custom security plugin for additional perks.\n\n9. Backups\n\nIf anything ever goes wrong on your website, the first thing you’re going to need is a backup. Automatic WordPress core updates are notorious for causing issues on many websites, for instance.\n\nBoth SiteGround and Bluehost mention free daily backups on their website, so let’s look into the details.\n\nBluehost’s Backup Policy\n\nBluehost makes it very clear that they take no responsibility for failed backups. They do offer free backups for customers, but they’re “not guaranteed in any way.”[1]\n\nAlso, Bluehost doesn’t offer redundant or mirrored backups.\n\nSiteGround’s Backup Policy\n\nSiteGround offers free daily backups and geographically distributed redundant backups too.\n\nThis means that if servers in a particular area go down, your website won’t go down with it. In case of disaster, their systems are primed to restore large amounts of data and jumpstart your website using servers in different locations.\n\nWinner: Siteground due to their proactiveness to ensure website data is safeguarded and easily restored if something happens to their servers.\n\n10. Domains\n\nWhen it comes to domains, Bluehost offers a free domain name with many of its hosting packages. SiteGround doesn’t include a free domain name with any of its packages.\n\nBoth companies offer hosting for unlimited websites on their second-tier plans and above.
