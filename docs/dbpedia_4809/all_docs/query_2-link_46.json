        "text": "The winter capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra, Nagpur, is the third-largest city in the country. Nagpur is currently the 13th most populous city in India, and an Oxford Economics analysis predicts that between 2019 and 2035, it will see an average growth rate of 8.41%, making it the fifth fastest-expanding metropolis in the entire globe. It has been suggested as one of Maharashtra’s Smart Cities, and it ranks in the top ten cities in India for the execution of Smart City Projects.\n\nNagpur as a Tech City\n\nNagpur placed first in Maharashtra state and second overall in India in the most recent rankings of 100 developing smart cities provided by the Union Ministry of Urban Development. Nagpur, often known as the “Orange Metropolis,” is today recognised as the state of Maharashtra’s greenest, safest, and most technologically advanced city.\n\nAccording to the article by The Hindu dated 6th August 2021, The Maharashtra government will introduce a policy with special incentives for the information technology sector for setting up projects in Nagpur, Amaravati, Latur, and Satara, among others, in an effort to improve infrastructure in tier 2 and tier 3 cities and lessen the rush of job-hunters in Pune and Mumbai.\n\nMinister of State for Information Technology and Home Satej Patil said that: Mumbai and Pune have been at the forefront of the nation’s and not just the State’s IT industry. However, they are oversaturated as a result of widespread inter-State and inter-city migration and meeting the employment needs of tens of thousands of people in Maharashtra and India. By providing incentives to industries there, they now wish to extend this progress to tier 2 and tier 3 cities like Nagpur, Satara, Amaravati, Latur, Nanded, and others. Through a distinct IT policy, industries will receive assistance with a range of amenities including energy and others and they have released a request for proposal (RFP) model to support the industry with simplified procurement process.\n\nWeb Hosting companies in Nagpur\n\nThere are numerous such businesses in Nagpur that provide web hosting. Let’s look at a few of the well-known web hosting providers of Nagpur.\n\neWebGuru\n\nOne of the greatest and most affordable web hosting service providers since 2003 is eWebGuru. eWebGuru began as an online service provider in 2003, and today it offers customers affordable access to enterprise-level web solutions.\n\nOne of the most popular goods on the eWebGuru market is web hosting. On a variety of different operating systems, they offer a range of web hosting services, such as WordPress hosting, Java, Linux, Windows, and business email. Reseller, VPS, and shared hosting are the three forms of Windows hosting that are offered. Under cloud VPS hosting, Linux and Windows VPS hosting are also available.\n\nSiteGround\n\nThe outstanding team of people, who devote their enthusiasm, experience, and time to looking after the websites of the customers, is what set SiteGround apart from other hosting companies. They are driven to provide a superior level of service because they enjoy what we do.\n\nIn 2004 in Sofia, Bulgaria, a web hosting business called SiteGround was established. It offers hosting for around 2,000,000 domains globally as of January 2020. It offers domain registration, shared hosting, cloud hosting, business solutions, and email hosting. About 500 employees were employed by the company in 2019. Sofia, Plovdiv, Stara Zagora, and Madrid are where it has offices.\n\nThe company’s website states that as of May 2020, it had 6 data centers spread across 6 nations: the US, the Netherlands, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Singapore. On its servers, SiteGround runs CentOS, Apache, Nginx, MySQL, PHP, WHM, and its custom control panel called Site Tools. Solid-state drives are used by SiteGround to store data.\n\nWordPress, Joomla, Magento, Drupal, PrestaShop, and WooCommerce websites can be hosted by SiteGround. It also has a connector for Weebly. Before experiencing significant price rises in 2021 and 2022, PCMag.com gave SiteGround a 3.5/5 rating in a review published on September 18, 2020.\n\nGoDaddy\n\nThe largest services platform for business owners worldwide is called GoDaddy. Their main moto is to equip their global community of 20+ million customers — and business owners everywhere — with everything they need to succeed online.\n\nWith its headquarters in Tempe, Arizona, and its incorporation in Delaware, GoDaddy Inc. is an American publicly traded Internet domain registrar and web hosting business.\n\nGoDaddy had more than 21 million clients and 6,600 employees as of December 2021. The business is well-known for its TV and newspaper advertising. It has been involved in a number of issues including censorship and questionable commercial activities.\n\nGoDaddy also offers the services of Website Builder along with offering services of Web Hosting.\n\nThe first logo for GoDaddy showed a man with unkempt hair and sunglasses in a cartoon manner. GoDaddy released a new logo in January 2020 that consists of a heart-shaped graphic that spells out “GO” and straightforward sans-serif lettering.\n\nGoDaddy was about the same size as rivals Dotster and eNom in 2001, not long after Network Solutions was no longer the sole location to register a domain.\n\nIn April 2005, GoDaddy surpassed all other Internet registrars to earn ICANN accreditation.\n\nIn terms of market share as of 2018, GoDaddy has more than 62 million registered domains, making it the largest web host in the world.\n\nGoDaddy announced a multi-year shift to move the vast bulk of its infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in March 2018.\n\nVultr\n\nVultr, a 2014 startup, aims to empower developers and companies by making infrastructure deployment simple with its cutting-edge cloud platform.\n\nOffering a standardised, highly dependable, high-performance cloud computing environment in each of the cities we serve is a top goal for Vultr. It has never been simpler to establish a cloud server environment in 28 cities worldwide!\n\nServices offered by them are:\n\nWebsite Hosting\n\nSaaS\n\nGame Servers\n\nVideo Streaming\n\nVPN\n\nFinal Wrap Up\n\nWhat do you think, then?
