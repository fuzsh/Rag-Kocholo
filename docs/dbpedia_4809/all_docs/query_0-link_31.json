        "text": "I've been a customer of both SiteGround and A2 Hosting for 5+ years.\n\nI love SiteGround for it's easy to use dashboard, features, amazing support, and generous pricing.\n\nI don't love SiteGround for it's file and iNode limitations.\n\nI love A2 Hosting for it's focus on speed, very competitive pricing, and wide range of hosting service options – across shared, VPS, dedicated and more.\n\nI don't love that A2 Hosting's dashboard could use some work, and the backend feels a bit disjointed. Their customer service is good, but lacks the speed and expertise I've found with SiteGround.\n\nNevertheless, both A2 Hosting and SiteGround are great hosts to compare to each other.\n\nThey both have great support, high uptime, and screaming good prices for the quality.\n\nIn fact, both of them are considered one of the fastest web hosts according to our research.\n\nThe best thing about these two hosting brands is that they are charting their own path, and not part of a web hosting globo-corp that doesn't really care about their customers.\n\nSo you're making a great choice sizing up SiteGround vs A2 Hosting, let's dig into what makes them different.\n\nSo cutting to the chase: both have a similar amount of experience in the industry, offer 99.99% uptime with a 30-to-45-day money back guarantee, and plenty of customizable options to accommodate all abilities and price ranges.\n\nSo they've both got the basics covered there. But where there's a huge differentiation between them: speed and customer service.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for the fastest web host, go with A2 Hosting; if you're looking for the best overall host for features and customer service, go with SiteGround.\n\nUpdate for 2024\n\nThis year, as in the past few years, SiteGround and A2 Hosting both remain top contenders for the best value WordPress hosts. They strike the perfect balance of affordability, features, and speed. For those managing around 5-20 websites, these two hosts are the sweet spot of value.\n\nCompared to the premium WP Engine and Kinsta, both of these hosts offer a lot of the same features but allow for many sites hosted at a lower price. In-fact, SiteGround and A2 Hosting are both about only 10-30% of the cost of WP Engine and Kinsta.\n\nIf you want great value, managed hosting, with good customer support, we still strongly recommend both SiteGround and A2 Hosting in 2024.\n\nA2 Hosting: Highlights, Pros and Cons\n\nSince starting in 2003, A2 Hosting has emphasized their speed above all else, up to 20x faster than rivals. The Michigan-based company offers unlimited disk space and unlimited bandwidth.\n\nA2 Hosting Pricing\n\nA2 Hosting offers quite a few clear pricing options. The lowest price points in each option start at reasonable monthly entry prices:\n\nShared Hosting: $12.99 is the full (renewal) price – but a coupon code brings it down to $2.99 for 12 months\n\nManaged VPS Hosting: starts at $76.99/mo for the full (renewal) price – but promotion brings it to $35.99/mo to start for 12 months\n\nManaged Dedicated Hosting: $249.99 is the full (renewal) price – promotion brings it to $159.99/mo for 12 months\n\nNote that pricing is subject to change at any time.

Whether you enter a server ticket, chat online, or call their helpline, they’ve received high marks for their service. To enhance your service, A2 Hosting allows you to choose the server closest to you.\n\nThere have been some complaints with slow responses, depending on the time of day. Personally I've had great experiences with their support.\n\nThere was one huge issue they had during the great A2 Hosting outage recently. But they've recovered since.\n\nSpeed\n\nA2 Hosting touts a SwiftServer high-performance platform that allows them to offer Turbo packages. These servers load your pages up to 20 times faster, with fewer customers on each server and more resources allocated to individual accounts. All of their hosting accounts include solid state drives, which can perform thousands of input/output functions each minute.\n\nValue\n\nFor the amount of service and support, A2 Hosting offers tremendous value. Included SSD, cPanel access for all shared hosting customers, and many other options are available to fit any need.\n\nFeatures\n\nA2 Hosting offers CPanel-powered functions, support for everyone from beginners to advanced developers and consultants. They provide automatic server-based backup, anti-virus protection, and a variety of software and development options for different industries.\n\nThey optimize for speed and security, and a lot of features come baked in. This makes their hosting beginner-friendly, which is super helpful.\n\nOne downside is that their features can be a bit overwhelming, because their UI isn't perfect. But it gets the job done.\n\nDowntime/Uptime:\n\nThe have privately-owned servers, with data centers in Michigan, Amsterdam and Singapore. A2 Hosting guarantees 99.9% uptime. The also offer upload and download speed tests from each data center.\n\nThey did have a huge data center outage recently, but things have been smooth sailing since.\n\nSiteGround Hosting: Highlights, Pros and Cons\n\nStarted by former lawyers and IT professionals in Bulgaria in 2003, SiteGround offers tons of web hosting options, unlimited bandwidth, and award-winning service, speed, and support.\n\nWe personally love SiteGround. Overall they are affordable, super friendly, and feature-rich with everything we need.\n\nSiteGround Pricing\n\nSiteGround’s plans are on the pricier side when it comes to budget hosting, but many reviewers appreciate all of the extras that come with a little higher price. They have several levels for each of their four hosting options.\n\nShared Hosting: Regularly priced at $9.95, coupon codes drop that down to $3.95\n\nCloud Hosting: Starts at $60 monthly\n\nReseller Hosting: A credit plan, which equals one year of hosting, is as low as $42 each credit when you purchase 11 or more credits.\n\nDedicated Hosting: Their U.S. dedicated server plans start at $229 per month\n\nCustomer Support\n\nThey are available at every second for instant chat, instant phone responses, and tickets that they say average about 10 minutes for the first response.\n\nSiteGround is shocking in how fast they are to respond. It's truly unbelievable.\n\nYou get support tickets filled out faster than you can say “server” and an attention to detail that goes above and beyond.\n\nThey help out with issues they don't need to, and they go as far as fixing WordPress issues for you. Wow.\n\nSpeed\n\nSiteGround offers solid state drives on all hosting plans, and offers enhanced performance with NGINX, HTTP/2, PHP7 and free CDN.\n\nThey have a SiteGround SuperCacher plugin with multiple levels of caching and speed. You can choose what level of implementation you want to get this baby purring as fast as possible.\n\nValue\n\nWhile the prices may be slightly higher than other hosts, SiteGround’s plethora of options for developers and users of all abilities provides a high level of value.\n\nOverall, the value from SiteGround is unbelievable. It goes head-to-head with Bluehost and takes it down easily!\n\nFeatures\n\nThe offer hosting for a variety of different apps and services, provide Joomla, WordPress, and Magento themes, as well as tutorials for each. They include free daily backups.\n\nDowntime/Uptime: SiteGround offers a real-time status that lets you test your Web site’s real-time status.

These were the results:\n\nWe've got SiteGround on the left with a total grade of 94%, and A2 Hosting on the right with a total score of 97%.\n\nNote that this is with caching plugins provided by each host turned on. For SiteGround we used their SG SuperCacher with nearly ever level of caching turned on, and with A2 Hosting we went with their Turbo plan, up to 20x faster.\n\nOn a practical level, these are great results and it really shows that both of these are stellar. The speeds are so close that I wouldn't necessarily just choose one over the other purely based on the miniscule difference in speed.\n\nSiteGround vs A2 Hosting: What’s Best for You?\n\nBoth A2 Hosting and SiteGround offer unique features that can accommodate businesses of all sizes.
