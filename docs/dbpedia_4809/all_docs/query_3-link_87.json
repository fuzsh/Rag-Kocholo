        "text": "Learning how to start a travel blog doesn’t have to be difficult.\n\nAs the saying in the business world goes, the way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time.\n\nThe same goes when starting a travel blog.\n\nIn this post, we’ll discuss every step it takes to make this goal a reality.\n\nLadies and gentlemen — here’s how to start a travel blog.\n\nWhy Become a Travel Blogger?\n\nBefore you take on any task, it’s always important to know why you want to do it.\n\nWhen it comes to travel blogging, different people have different reasons.\n\nSome start a travel blog website because they’re retired and wish to make the most out of their golden years. Others have a serious case of wanderlust — compelling them to develop plans that’ll make travel a sustainable lifestyle for them.\n\nAt the end of the day, all that matters is that you really want to travel.\n\nIf, however, you’re only in it for the money, then travel blogging definitely isn’t for you.\n\nUnlike other niches like marketing, food, and fashion, travel blogging requires commitment. How else will you provide readers with quality, travel-related content if you hate the outdoors?\n\nPut simply, you must be genuinely in love with travel in order to grow and prosper in this sphere.\n\nBenefits of being a travel blogger\n\nOther than being a passionate traveler, here are a few more reasons why you should become a travel blogger:\n\nImmerse yourself in different cultures — Traveling to other countries is the way to truly appreciate what the world has to offer. It’s totally incomparable to just reading about foreign cultures in a book, online post, or another person’s Instagram account.\n\nPromoting a cause — A lot of travel bloggers promote volunteerism and responsible tourism. Some of them also travel to raise awareness on issues that affect their destinations.\n\nMeet new people — There’s nothing like traveling abroad to diversify your personal and professional networks. The bigger your network, the more life-enriching opportunities you’ll find — be it with other people or international brands.\n\nGenerate income — When I said don’t do it for the money, I’m not saying there aren’t big bucks to be made. In fact, I’ll show you some of the ways to make money travel blogging in this post.\n\nBuild your own brand — Regardless of niche, blogging is a surefire way to build your authority. This will open the doors to bigger things, like writing books, becoming a brand ambassador, and being an inspiration.\n\nFeeling motivated yet?\n\nDon’t get too excited — you still have mountains of work ahead of you.\n\nHow to Create a Travel Blog: Building Your Site\n\nCreating your travel blog encompasses several steps. This includes coming up with a blog name, registering your domain, and building your first web page.\n\nStep 1: Think of an awesome travel blog name\n\nBefore you worry about learning how to start writing a travel blog, you must first give it a suitable name.\n\nThis process can be broken down into three steps:\n\nRead How to Discover Travel Blog Name Ideas for a detailed guide.\n\nHere’s a simplified breakdown of the steps you need to take:\n\nBrainstorming possible names with keywords\n\nA great way to discover potential keywords that align with your travel blog’s brand is to write a mission statement.\n\nSimply write up to two sentences that describe your blog’s content, your readers, and how they will benefit. When done, you can wrap it up by writing a short introduction of yourself.\n\nThere are no strict rules for this. To give you an idea, take a look at this simple statement from The Blonde Abroad:\n\nDisregarding the blog’s name, you can see that The Blonde Abroad’s mission statement contains a fistful of keywords. Not only did the site mention who the blog is for, it also clearly defines what its content is about.\n\nThere are several more ways to obtain additional keywords for the purpose of blog name selection:\n\nLooking for catchy synonyms on Google\n\nChecking Google Autocomplete suggestions\n\nUsing a tool like SEMrush to find keyword variations\n\nUsing AnswerThePublic to find questions people are asking\n\nFor even more keywords, look at the infographic below.\n\nOnce you have a decent pool of keywords to work with, try combining them to find something that clicks.\n\nLet’s say you’re interested in the name “Solo Nomad Travels.”\n\nThe next step is to check if it’s available as a domain name.\n\nChecking the name’s availability as a domain name\n\nDomain registration and hosting services like NameCheap and GoDaddy can help you with this. Just use the domain feature baked into these sites to validate their availability.\n\nAs a bonus, they’ll also provide you with potential domain alternatives.\n\nIf the domain you want is available, consider registering it immediately.\n\nDomain registration is, after all, incredibly cheap. As you can see in the screenshot above, NameCheap lets you own the domain name for as little as $8.88 per year.\n\nHere are a few reminders before you buy a travel blog domain name:\n\nIf possible, go for the “.com” TLD or domain extension\n\nKeep your domain name short at three words or approximately 12 characters tops\n\nPick a brandable domain name over keyword-stuffed one\n\nHosting your travel blog domain\n\nOnce you’ve finalized your domain name and registered it accordingly, it’s time to get it hosted.\n\nThis should be a fairly straightforward process. All you need to do is look for a reliable hosting service provider and follow the steps they’ll show you.\n\nWhile budget companies like NameCheap are great for domain registrations, people are having issues with their hosting service.\n\nThat’s why budget domain registration services are best paired with a different web host.\n\nThe question is, how exactly can you point your domain to your web hosting account?\n\nDon’t worry — it’s not that hard.\n\nLet me walk you through the steps.\n\nStep 2: Pointing your domain name to a different host\n\nFirst things first, you need to create an account on a reputable hosting service provider.\n\nIf we’re talking about reliability, affordability, and ease of use, one of my top recommendations would be SiteGround.\n\nGo ahead and check out their site to see their selection of affordable web hosting solutions.\n\nLet me lay down the reasons why SiteGround is a great hosting service provider.\n\nGreat customer support — Your web hosting’s performance is one of the things you have no control over as a blogger. That’s why it’s important to pick a host with great customer support and communicates well, like SiteGround.\n\nEasy website migration — In case you’re moving your domain from or to SiteGround, rest assured that the migration process will be easy-peasy.\n\nReliable uptime — In web hosting, “uptime” refers to the time when your domain and web assets are online. SiteGround is proven and tested to have an average uptime of 99.99 percent.\n\nSG Optimizer Plugin — The SG Optimizer Plugin is specifically designed to help WordPress users achieve maximum performance. It utilizes a variety of optimization techniques like caching, image optimization, frontend optimization, and more.\n\nSeriously — don’t take my word for it.\n\nI dare you to search the web for SiteGround reviews. Chances are, you’ll get a barrage of reviews with four to five stars.\n\nWith all that said, I used SiteGround’s interface to show you how to use different domain registrars and hosting services.\n\nUpdating your domain’s name servers using SiteGround’s values\n\nTo point your registered domain to a SiteGround hosting account, an easy way is to change your domain’s name servers.\n\nPut simply, name servers are part of a Domain Name System or DNS. A DNS functions like a database that contains a list of devices with attached IP addresses.\n\nJust a fair warning before you begin.\n\nWhile it only takes minutes to point your domain to your host, it may take days before your changes apply. This is called “DNS propagation.”\n\nTo find the correct values for your SiteGround hosting account, head to your cPanel, and look under “Account Information.”\n\nYour account’s name server details should be presented there.\n\nCopy these values or keep this tab open for now. The next step is to plug in your name server values to your domain registrar.\n\nFor the sake of this guide, let’s say you registered your domain on GoDaddy.\n\nYou can change your domain’s name servers by first heading to the “Domain Manager.”\n\nJust click ‘Manage Domains’ in the “Quick Links” panel of your account.\n\nGoDaddy should take you to your “My Domains” page, which is basically a list of all your registered domains.\n\nLook for the domain that you want to point to SiteGround and click the “Ellipsis” button next to it. From there, click on ‘Manage DNS.’\n\nThis should bring up the “Domain Management” page, which has a comprehensive list of your DNS details.\n\nWhat you need to do is scroll down and look for the “Nameservers” panel.\n\nClick the ‘Change’ button right next to “Use default nameservers.”\n\nAt first, GoDaddy will remind you of the risks and disadvantages of connecting your domain to a different site. Read it as you wish, then click ‘Enter my own nameservers (advanced)’ to proceed.\n\nOn the next page, simply enter the name server details from your SiteGround hosting account. Click ‘Save’ to finish the job.\n\nRemember that, if you don’t use GoDaddy, then the steps above aren’t applicable to you.\n\nEach domain registrar has different interfaces and navigation systems. If you’re having a hard time looking for your domain’s name server settings, contact your registrar’s customer support.\n\nFurthermore, it may take 24 to 48 hours for the domain propagation period to complete. While you wait, contact your registrar and web host to verify if you properly set up your domain.\n\nOn your SiteGround account’s homepage, look for the panel “Transfer Your Domains” and click the link below.\n\nStep 3: Installing WordPress\n\nNow that your domain is hosted and ready, the next step is to install WordPress. It’s a Content Management System or CMS that essentially provides you with a visual interface for website creation.\n\nHere’s the cool part: most web hosting services have adopted WordPress into their ecosystem.\n\nThis is mostly due to WordPress’s popularity for bloggers, businesses, and professionals alike.\n\nFor instance, SiteGround has an easy WordPress “autoinstaller” that can set up your site in seconds. This tool can be accessed from the control panel under the “Autoinstallers” section.\n\nTake note that the same tool can be launched by clicking ‘WordPress Installer’ under “WordPress Tools.”\n\nFrom WordPress Installer’s main page, click ‘Install’ to initialize the software setup application.\n\nBe sure to install an updated version of WordPress by selecting the most recent version. To do this, click the drop-down menu next to “Choose the version you want to install.”\n\nThe highest number should denote the latest WordPress update.\n\nUnder the “Choose Installation URL,” select the domain you want to build your travel blog on. I also recommend using an “https” protocol, which stands for “Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.”\n\nThis protocol utilizes a Transport Layer Security or TLS to encrypt communications conducted through your website.\n\nThe rest of the WordPress setup settings are fairly self-explanatory.\n\nFor example, under the “Admin Account” section, you can create your primary admin account. You just need to input details such as your administrator username, password, and email address.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that hosts like SiteGround offer additional installation options. For instance, you may choose to install the Loginizer plugin, which limits invalid login attempts.\n\nThis is a great countermeasure to brute force attacks.\n\nThese add-ons vary from host to host. Just remember that these plugins are completely optional — you won’t miss out a lot by choosing not to install them.\n\nOnce you’re happy with your WordPress installation settings, click ‘Install’ at the bottom of the page.\n\nCongratulations — your WordPress travel blog should now be up and running!\n\nYou’re now ready to build your travel blog website.\n\nBest WordPress Themes for Travel Blogs\n\nInstalling WordPress is just one of the steps in learning how to start a travel blog website.\n\nYou should also learn how to choose a great theme, which plugins to use, how to publish content, and more.\n\nThe first item on that list is pretty easy to do.\n\nStep 1: Logging in to your WordPress admin account\n\nAfter installation, log in to your WordPress dashboard by accessing the installation URL. By default, this is simply your domain plus “wp-admin” attached to the end.\n\nLet’s pretend for a second that you actually bought the domain “SoloNomadTravels.com.”\n\nAfter registering and hosting your domain, log in to WordPress by typing in the following address:\n\nYou can log in to your WordPress account using the admin credentials you created earlier.\n\nViewing the theme library\n\nWordPress has a built-in theme library with truckloads of free themes to choose from.\n\nTo view your options, click ‘Themes’ under the ‘Appearance’ sub-menu.\n\nWordPress comes with pre-installed themes that you can activate in a jiffy. You do, however, need to carefully consider which theme to use on your travel blog.\n\nTo add new themes, click ‘Add New.’ This will pull up WordPress’s theme library where you can find and install professional-looking in a snap.\n\nType in the keyword “travel” or anything related to your blog’s vision to get suitable ideas.\n\nIf you’re not in the mood to do your own digging, read 10 Best WordPress Themes for Travel Blogs here.\n\nStep 2: Creating a child theme\n\nFound the perfect travel blog theme?\n\nYou probably feel as ready as ever to start making customizations.\n\nHere’s a word of advice: don’t.\n\nAlthough WordPress allows you to directly edit themes right away, it’s advised that you create a “child theme” first.\n\nChild themes work by inheriting the appearance and basic functions of a theme — also referred to as “parent theme.” They’re created to allow WordPress website owners to make heavy customizations on any theme installed.\n\nYou can definitely customize a theme to your liking without creating a child theme. However, you’ll most likely lose all your customizations once you install a theme update.\n\nIn other words, child themes separate your customizations from the essential functionalities of the parent theme.\n\nTo create a child theme, you need to access your web host’s WordPress theme directory.\n\nFinding your WordPress website’s theme directory\n\nEvery web host should have a built-in file manager you can use for this. In GoDaddy’s case, it’s simply called the “cPanel File Manager.”\n\nOn the File Manager interface, click on the ‘public_html’ link. You can also find this in the directory tree on the left.\n\nThis should open up your website’s designated directory.\n\nNext, click on ‘wp-content’ and open the ‘themes’ folder. You should see a list of folders — each named after one of your currently-installed themes.\n\nSuppose you want to create a child theme for the “Twenty Nineteen” theme.\n\nYou’ll need to create a folder for that.\n\nYou can add a new folder to the current directory by clicking ‘+ Folder’ on the File Manager’s main toolbar. As for the name, it’s best to use the same name with “-child” added to the end.\n\nIn relation to the example above, you can call your child theme’s folder “twentynineteen-child.”\n\nCreating your child theme’s style sheet\n\nAfter creating your child theme’s folder, open it and create a new text file called “style.css.”\n\nOn GoDaddy’s file manager, you can add files to your website’s directory by clicking ‘+ File’ on the main toolbar.\n\nOnce the file is created, edit it using the ‘Edit’ button on the toolbar or on the right-click menu.\n\nSince you just created this file, it should be empty once you’ve loaded up the editor.\n\nCopy and paste the code below to continue.\n\n/* Theme Name: Twenty Nineteen Child Template: twentynineteen Theme URI: https://wordpress.org/themes/twentynineteen/ Author: the WordPress team Author URI: https://wordpress.org/ Description: Our 2019 default theme is designed to show off the power of the block editor. Requires at least: WordPress 4.9.6 Version: 1.4 License: GNU General Public License v2 or later License URI: LICENSE Text Domain: twentynineteen-child Tags: one-column, flexible-header, accessibility-ready, custom-colors, custom-menu, custom-logo, editor-style, featured-images, footer-widgets, rtl-language-support, sticky-post, threaded-comments, translation-ready */\n\nCurious how I came up with the code?\n\nTo be perfectly clear, only two lines of that code are actually necessary for your child theme to work. I’m talking about the “Theme Name” and “Template” lines.\n\nYou just need to modify the “Theme Name” and “Template” lines to match your theme’s name.\n\nIf you’re bothered by it, you can simply copy information from the parent theme’s style sheet. You can find the appropriate file in the parent theme’s directory.\n\nSome of the information you can copy into your child theme’s style sheet are:\n\nAuthor\n\nTheme URI\n\nAuthor URI\n\nDescription\n\nVersion\n\nLicense\n\nText Domain\n\nTags\n\nDon’t worry about the rest of the code. WordPress should already know how the theme looks just with the theme’s name and template.\n\nThe file should now function as the child theme’s style sheet, which tells WordPress what the theme should look like.\n\nCreating ‘functions.php’\n\nAlready saved your child theme’s “style.css” file?\n\nNice — that’s one out of two.\n\nThere’s one more file you need to create in your child theme’s library. This time, call it “functions.php.”\n\nWondering what code to copy and paste into this new file?\n\nHere you go:\n\n<?php add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'enqueue_parent_styles' ); function enqueue_parent_styles() { wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri().'/style.css' ); } ?>\n\nSave the file to finish this step. Your child theme should now be ready and waiting for you in your WordPress theme library.\n\nJust head back to ‘Themes’ under the ‘Appearance’ sub-menu. You should find it right next to the parent theme.\n\nWith your child theme highlighted, click ‘Activate’ to make sure it works. If it doesn’t, review the steps above and check if you used the right codes.\n\nBest WordPress Plugins for Travel Blogs\n\nA theme creates a skeleton for your WordPress website.\n\nIt becomes the foundation wherein building blocks, like your content and various site elements, can be piled up.\n\nSince content creation takes substantially more preparations, let’s focus first on WordPress plugins.\n\nHow to install WordPress plugins\n\nInstalling plugins on your WordPress website is as easy as installing themes.\n\nFrom your WordPress dashboard, expand the ‘Plugins’ sub-menu and click ‘Add New.’\n\nTo look for plugins that may prove useful to travel blogs, enter a related keyword on the search field.\n\nA keyword like “travel” can give you a few ideas.\n\nThe must-have plugins for WordPress travel blogs\n\nHere is a quick roundup of the top travel blog plugins I’d recommend.\n\nTip: you can learn more about these plugins by visiting this post.\n\nDivi — A page builder that will give you full control over your website’s appearance. Its features include a drag-and-drop builder, ready-to-use layouts, advanced animations, and pre-built website elements.\n\nBloom — Bloom lets you create eye-catching opt-in forms that can appear as pop-ups, fly-ins, widgets, and content gates. The best part is, both Bloom and Divi come for free with an Elegant Themes membership.\n\nGenesis Author Pro — If you use a Genesis child theme, Genesis Author Pro is an aesthetic and easy way to showcase your books. You can include details like the book’s price, editions, publishing date, ISBN, and so on.\n\nGeo Mashup — Some travel bloggers allow their audience to browse their content using a visual, interactive map. Geo Mashup lets you pin clickable markers on maps from services like Google Maps, which take readers to specific posts.\n\nTravelers’ Map — Travelers’ Map is a lightweight alternative to Geo Mashup. Its main advantage is more flexibility, allowing you to change the appearance of your map using OpenStreetMap tiles.\n\nPhoto Gallery by 10Web — Photo Gallery by 10Web lets you create beautiful image galleries for your travel photos with ease. It features several transition effects, different layouts, gallery grouping, Instagram integration, and eCommerce support.\n\nSocial Snap — This is my go-to plugin for leveraging the power of social media. It lets you add sharing buttons anywhere, build a floating sidebar, integrate over 30 social networks, and more.\n\nSmash Balloon Social Photo Feed — You can showcase your Instagram photos on your travel blog using Smash Balloon Social Photo Feed. It pulls posts from your Instagram account in real-time, allowing readers to view your posts as you upload them.\n\nSmush — While photos are essential to any travel blog, they can have a negative impact on your site’s performance. The Smush plugin prevents this by compressing the file size of your images with the option to preserve quality.\n\nWP Rocket — WP Rocket is another plugin designed to help maximize your website’s performance. Its main features include GZIP compression, browser caching, sitemap preloading, and lazy loading.\n\nThe Events Calendar — Planning to host events with your travel blog audience? The Events Calendar can help you using an interactive calendar — complete with a custom widget and Google Maps integration.\n\nLinkWhisper — It’s recommended to build a solid internal link structure to improve your SEO and boost the discoverability of older posts. LinkWhisper can help you do this by looking for internal linking opportunities, such as unlinked related posts and “orphaned” content.\n\nBuilding Your Travel Blog’s Content Strategy\n\nAlright — you’re done with all the necessary preparations.\n\nYou have your unique domain ready and WordPress ecosystem going.\n\nWhat comes next is perhaps the most important part of being a travel blogger — creating a content strategy.\n\nKeyword research for travel blogs\n\nWhen creating content for a travel blog, keyword research is the first order of business.\n\nKeyword research makes sure you create posts that people actually want to read. More importantly, it can help you determine which content ideas can give you traffic.\n\nYou’ll understand why as you learn more about keyword research.\n\nUsing the Keyword Magic Tool\n\nLet me get one thing straight.\n\nIt’s nigh impossible to conduct data-driven keyword research without a capable tool.\n\nSure, you can technically acquire potential keyword ideas with just Google. You just need to enter any relevant term and look at the Autocomplete suggestions.\n\nLet’s give it a go with the search term “destinations in Asia.”\n\nSo, do people actually search for those keywords on Google?\n\nYou bet you can.\n\nCan you effectively leverage those keywords to bring traffic to your travel blog?\n\nOnly a keyword research tool can answer that.\n\nAs far as this goes, my personal tool of choice for keyword research is SEMrush’s Keyword Magic Tool.\n\nIt can be accessed from the ‘Keyword Analytics’ section of the SEMrush dashboard.\n\nKeyword Magic Tool works by identifying keyword ideas while pulling up valuable keyword metrics. This includes each keyword’s monthly search volume, average Cost-Per-Click, and keyword difficulty rating.\n\nHere are the suggestions you’ll obtain using “destinations in Asia” as your seed keyword:\n\nPretty interesting, right?\n\nWhen picking a keyword for your content strategy, remember to look at the following metrics to gauge their viability:\n\nVolume — This metric measures the average monthly number of users who search for this keyword. Personally, I prefer to target keywords with a volume of at least 100.\n\nKD — Short for Keyword Difficulty, the KD metric gives you an idea of how competitive a keyword is. A KD of 60 to 80 means medium difficulty, which is good for new bloggers.\n\nCPC — The metric CPC or cost-per-click reflects the average amount advertisers are willing to bid for a keyword. It can help you determine the monetization potential of any given keyword.\n\nKeywords with higher CPC are often more competitive since brands typically care more about monetization. However, long-tail keywords can provide new bloggers with more traffic and better chances at ranking.\n\nLong-tail keywords are phrases that contain at least three terms.\n\nThe longer they are, the less competitive they get.\n\nLong-tail keywords also pertain to a more specific topic and target a narrower audience. That makes them perfect to be used as content ideas for your travel blog.\n\nFor example, the keyword “honeymoon destinations in Asia” is as clear-cut as you can get.\n\nIf I’m calling the shots, I’ll write a simple listicle that highlights the pros and cons of each destination. While I’m at it, I will also share some tips for travelers who wish to visit those locations.\n\nNot finding keywords with decent traffic and reasonable keyword difficulty ratings?\n\nHere’s a tip: don’t think too much about their average monthly traffic.\n\nIt’s okay if the keywords you find only have 100 or so monthly searches.\n\nRemember, the goal is to target multiple related keywords in one post. If you target five low-competition keywords with 100 monthly searches each, then your content’s traffic potential is 500.\n\nFor more information on long-tail keywords, check out this guide.\n\nGetting more content ideas with AnswerThePublic\n\nIn my own content strategy, I use a mix of keyword research tools — each with specific purposes.\n\nThe Keyword Magic Tool, for example, is my favorite for acquiring valuable keyword metrics. But content idea generation, I usually get more promising results with AnswerThePublic.\n\nHere’s how it works.\n\nJust like any other keyword research tool, you enter any seed keyword into the search bar.\n\nLet’s try “honeymoon destinations” to see what the tool can do.\n\nUpon clicking ‘Search,’ AnswerThePublic will compile a list of questions that people ask around that keyword.\n\nThe tool does this by rendering a visualization with branches for question words, like what, how, and which.\n\nAs you can see, these questions can be refined into interesting travel blog post ideas.\n\nSome examples are:\n\nWhich honeymoon destinations are best in India\n\nWhat are great honeymoon destinations\n\nWhich honeymoon destinations are the cheapest\n\nOther than questions, AnswerThePublic also provides phrases based on prepositions and comparisons.\n\nJust below the first visualization, you’ll find additional ones sprinkled with more ideas.\n\nYou can switch to the “Data” mode for a more organized view of these ideas. Simply click on the ‘Data’ tab on top of the results.\n\nBased on the results above, here are more ideas you can turn into travel blog post topics:\n\nHoneymoon destinations you can drive to\n\nHoneymoon destinations to visit in May\n\nHoneymoon destinations near Bangalore\n\nHoneymoon destinations with a baby\n\nHoneymoon destinations with private pool\n\nRest assured that these ideas came from Google searches.\n\nUsers are looking for them, meaning you can write about them in your blog to capture people’s attention.\n\nYou do, however, need to run these keywords on a tool like Keyword Magic Tool. Doing so will provide you with additional data that can help you make informed decisions for your content strategy.\n\nTake a look at metrics like average monthly volume and keyword difficulty. That’s the way to maximize the value you can get from your content creation efforts.\n\nWhen you find keywords, collect them into a spreadsheet along with important metrics. You’ll need them later once you start writing your content.\n\nLooking at your competitors for keywords\n\nLet’s face it: keyword research can be time-consuming.\n\nSometimes, it’s tough to find keywords with good traffic and a suitable keyword difficulty range. You also need to think of what type of content to use when utilizing keywords in your blog.\n\nFor all those reasons, I always recommend doing competitor keyword research.\n\nTrust me — if there’s someone who cracked the code to the keyword research puzzle, it’s your top competitor.\n\nYou should have an idea of who they are before you even decided to start your travel blog. If not, take a gander of this list of the top 52 travel bloggers on the web.\n\nYou can also quickly identify your competitors with — surprise, surprise — Google.\n\nJust enter any of the keywords you’ve collected earlier plus the keyword “travel blog.” Google’s first page should now contain your top competitors.\n\nWhen you find a potential competitor, fire up SEMrush or anything similar and run a domain analysis.\n\nYou simply have to paste their domain address and click ‘Search.’ The tool should do the rest.\n\nLet’s pretend for a minute that While I’m Young is your top competitor.\n\nAfter entering their domain address into SEMrush, the tool will generate a data-packed domain overview report.\n\nIt should look something like this:\n\nTo take a peek at your competitor’s keywords, scroll down to the “Organic Research” section.\n\nTheir top keywords, along with their keyword rankings, should be presented to you on a silver platter.\n\nClicking ‘View details’ will give you a deeper look at your competitors’ keywords.\n\nUnder the ‘Positions’ tab, you’ll see the full list of your competitor’s keywords and their metrics.\n\nThere you go — a fresh batch of potential keywords for your content strategy.\n\nThe good news is, you’re free to repeat the same strategy over and over again for every competitor you find.\n\nThat translates to heaps and heaps of proven target keywords that can bring quality traffic to your travel blog.\n\nLong story short, you’re reaping the benefits of the keyword research that your competitors did.\n\nHow crafty is that?\n\nApparently, there are more ways to take advantage of the research your competitors have done.\n\nOther things to look for in your competitor’s website\n\nApart from keywords, you can also harvest more ideas for your content strategy from your competitor’s blog.\n\nBy this, I mean looking at certain aspects of their content and adopting them into your content strategy:\n\nContent types — What kind of visual content does your top competitor use? If you want to outperform them, be prepared to utilize the same content types — be it videos, infographics, or slideshows.\n\nInternal links — Give your competitor’s content a thorough read and you should find a couple of internal links to their own posts. This will help you unearth even more topic ideas you can cover in your travel blog.\n\nContent length — There’s more than enough evidence that proves the positive effects of high word counts on SEO. Just remember that adding fluff is not the way to bolster your blog content’s average length.\n\nLink sources — Using SEMrush or anything similar, you can also find other sites that link to your competitor’s posts. This is important if you want to employ link building strategies like the Skyscraper Technique.\n\nEssential pages — How did your competitor create their “about,” “work with me,” and “contact” pages? Are there any other useful pages and resources you can replicate in your blog?\n\nI’m pretty sure there are more things in your competitor’s site you can use as inspiration for your travel blog. It all depends on what you find appealing and your specific objectives at this very moment.\n\nFor example, what colors pop in your competitor’s blog? Do you like their blog post layouts, font choices, and navigation?\n\nI’m not encouraging you to blatantly copy every single facet of your competitor’s blogging strategy.\n\nAll I’m saying is, beginners sometimes need to see how things are done in order to hatch original ideas themselves.\n\nHow to use keywords in your content\n\nNow that you have a list of keywords in hand and some content ideas, let’s piece them together.\n\nThe first rule is to make sure your target keywords appear in the right places.\n\nHere are the specific content elements where you should put your target keywords at least once:\n\nPage or post title — Your blog post’s title is one of the elements that absolutely need your target keyword. It’s also the first thing your readers will see upon discovering your blog, so pay close attention when creating it.\n\nMain headline — After users click on your post’s title, the next thing they’ll look at is the post’s main headline. Seeing a matching, keyword-optimized headline reassures them that they found the content they wanted.\n\nSubheadings — Keywords in subheadings are also shown to improve keyword rankings. Not only that, they’ll also make your content more skimmable and readable to readers.\n\nMain body — The main body text is where every primary and secondary keywords should appear. Several authoritative SEO brands like Yoast recommend putting them right in the introduction.\n\nImages — To optimize images for SEO, give them keyword-optimized filenames, alt text tags, and surrounding text. This will help make your website more discoverable to people who use image search.\n\nLink anchor texts — It doesn’t matter if you’re optimizing an internal link or a backlink from an external source. Using a keyword-optimized anchor text will help search engines understand what your post is about.\n\nPermalink — The permalink is the URL that readers can use to access your content. You can edit this straight from WordPress’s post editor to contain your focus keyword.\n\nMeta description — While the meta description doesn’t directly affect keyword rankings, it can increase organic click-throughs to your content. I currently use the Rank Math plugin to optimize meta descriptions here in Master Blogging.\n\nI know — it can be tiresome to consciously think about these content components when writing blog posts. But I assure you that it becomes second nature when you’re working on your third or fourth post.\n\nIt’s all about being consistent with these keyword optimization practices.\n\nOnce you nail keyword placements, keep in mind that there are other on-page SEO strategies to remember. You can read the full guide on on-page SEO techniques right here.\n\nHow to create killer travel blog content\n\nJust a heads up in case you’re still looking for good content ideas for your travel blog.\n\nI compiled a grand total of 138 post title ideas for your brand-new travel blog.\n\nFeel free to use that list to fuel your travel blog content strategy. Just remember to tweak the titles a little so you won’t have the same posts as everyone else!\n\nNow — going back to your travel blog content creation.\n\nIt takes a lot more than just a good content idea to make the cut.\n\nLet me break down the essential content guidelines that I abide by myself.\n\nCreate user-oriented posts\n\nThe best articles are the ones that address the readers’ pain points.\n\nThink of the objectives that your audience will accomplish after they read your travel-related post. Combine these objectives with your target keywords to come up with valuable post ideas like:\n\nPacking tips for a specific type of trip\n\nThings to do when visiting a certain destination\n\nHow to stay safe when doing a specific outdoor activity\n\nUse a task management app\n\nIf you really know me, you should know that I’m a big fan of productivity tools.\n\nAn important piece of my everyday writing ritual is Trello — a task management application with a lot of uses.\n\nI use Trello to consolidate all my content plans and ideas.\n\nThere are separate lists for general reminders, topic ideas, ongoing tasks, completed tasks, and so on.\n\nHere’s a glimpse of how busy my blogging life really is:\n\nTrello also has a handful of useful tricks up its sleeve.\n\nWith checklists, I can track my target keywords for a specific post. I can also create deadlines to help me stay right on schedule.\n\nWant more tips on staying productive? Read 23 Productivity Tips for Bloggers.\n\nTake a lot of high-quality photos\n\nIn a travel blog, words can help describe the details of a story.\n\nPhotos, however, bring that story to life.\n\nIf you’re clueless on travel photography, I suggest taking up online classes. You may also bank on free YouTube tutorials on smartphone photography, which is a practical approach for beginners.\n\nJust search “how to take travel photos smartphone” and you’ll find a long list of free tutorials.\n\nTo show off your travel photos, you can insert them in your articles or use a gallery plugin. You can also refer to your competitors’ posts for ideas on how to incorporate photos in your blog.\n\nCreate custom blog banners\n\nTo become an authoritative figure in any niche, a rule of thumb is to never use generic stock photos.\n\nUse a tool like Canva to create custom blog banners to make your travel blog posts more eye-catching.\n\nCanva is a user-friendly, drag-and-drop image editing tool with a bunch of time-saving features. For one, it has pre-made blog banner templates you can customize with text, visual elements, and image filters.\n\nYou can also use Canva to customize the travel photos you’ll upload on social media, including Pinterest and Instagram. Just be sure to use the ideal format for the specific site by selecting the suggested design dimensions.\n\nUse automated proofreading tools\n\nAs a travel blogger, you don’t need flawless grammar and spelling to make great content.\n\nI say that for two reasons.\n\nFirst, a lot of travel bloggers use a conversational writing tone to give their content a unique flavor. This makes their travel stories more genuine, impactful, and entertaining to read.\n\nSecond, you can always rely on proofreading tools to iron out the basic grammar and spelling mistakes you’ll make.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of tools that do a good enough job through the years. But since I’m not one who’ll settle for “good enough,” I reviewed the absolute top 4 proofreading tools right here.\n\nMy top pick would be Grammarly, which is the one I still use to this day.\n\nWhat won me over to Grammarly is its speed, user interface, and customizable proofreading goals.\n\nIt lets you tailor the tool’s proofreading algorithms to suit your travel blogging style. It doesn’t matter if you wish to create humorous posts with colloquial language or strictly professional articles.\n\nAs for its actual reliability and accuracy, I think Grammarly is definitely capable of helping you create 100% polished posts.\n\nJust bear in mind that you’re not obliged to approve all of its correction suggestions, especially those unrelated to correctness. Use your own discretion when approving suggested changes in your post to retain your personal blogging voice.\n\nBuild a resources page\n\nWant to make it easier for readers to find your travel blog’s essential content?\n\nHere’s a four-word piece of advice: build a resources page.\n\nThink of it as the starting point of every new visitor who stumbles upon your page. Ask yourself, what are must-read articles that will familiarize guests with your brand?\n\nAfter listing these articles down, create a page with all the necessary links. Here’s an example from Nomadic Matt:\n\nWhat makes resource pages useful are the internal links that take readers to useful content.\n\nSpeaking of which, now might be a good time to plan your travel blog’s internal link structure.\n\nBuild a solid internal link structure for your travel blog\n\nLinks are internal if they point to content within the same site.\n\nCreating resource pages with links to your own content is an example of internal linking. In addition to helping readers find the information they need, internal links are also crucial to on-page SEO.\n\nBelow are some ground rules on how to effectively create internal links in your travel blog:\n\nAlways set internal links to open in a new tab\n\nDon’t put internal links to unrelated posts\n\nMake sure every post is accessible within three clicks — not just with internal links, but with menus as well\n\nDon’t put internal links on images\n\nAvoid using too many internal links, especially ones that are too close together\n\nTo create internal links in your travel blog, start by planning the categorization of your content.\n\nMost travel blogs create different categories for specific aspects of traveling. This includes travel equipment, destinations, packing, and budgeting.\n\nBuilding internal links between posts under the same category is a surefire strategy. However, see to it that they’re created contextually — meaning they should not distract readers from the current topic.\n\nLet me give you a real-life example right now.\n\nFor the nitty-gritty of internal linking, read this guide.\n\nPromoting Your Travel Blog Posts\n\nSuccessful travel bloggers who make thousands of dollars are expert marketers — make no mistake about it. You can’t just upload high-quality travel blog content and call it a day.\n\nTo learn how to become a travel blogger, you should also learn how to promote posts like one.\n\nAnd to do that, you need to be familiar with a professional travel blogger’s go-to content promotion channels.\n\nBuild an Instagram page\n\nFor some bloggers like Melissa Hie of Girl Eat World, Instagram is one of the cornerstones for success.\n\nInstagram is a fun and easy way to turn your travel experiences into shareable stories that people will love. You just need a modern smartphone, a destination, and the patience to diligently upload photos to your feed.\n\nInstagram is great for travel bloggers because it basically lets you tell travel stories through your photos.\n\nA strong caption for each image will definitely go a long way, though. So, think of something creative and use branded hashtags whenever you can.\n\nAnother advantage of using Instagram is that your followers also get to see your uploads in real time. This creates the feeling that you’re taking them along in your journey, especially if you regularly share Instagram “Stories.”\n\nInstagram tips for travel bloggers\n\nCreate a business account for features like analytics and ads\n\nFormulate a recognizable, travel-related hashtag for your brand\n\nPick a color palette or filter configuration to make your Instagram page look cohesive\n\nLink to your travel blog in your Instagram bio\n\nCreate a YouTube channel\n\nThe biggest travel blogs use video content to maximize the engagement of their audience.\n\nIt shouldn’t be hard to see why.\n\nWhen it comes to telling stories, nothing beats videos since your audience can both see and hear what’s happening.\n\nVideos also give you the opportunity to introduce how you act in public and who you are as a person. And if you share your videos through YouTube, you can leverage the platform’s potential for brand building, traffic, and monetization.\n\nCalifornia Through My Lens is an example of a travel blog that heavily relies on YouTube to build authority.\n\nYouTube tips for travel bloggers\n\nUpload everything on YouTube and embed videos in your blog\n\nLearn about YouTube SEO with tutorials from other travel blogs like The Endless Adventure\n\nEngage your viewers in the comments\n\nLeave your website and other contact information on your YouTube channel page\n\nAlways promote your YouTube videos on other channels as you upload them\n\nPromote more visuals through Pinterest\n\nPinterest is another image-sharing social network with tools tailored to the marketing needs of brands.\n\nWith a “Business” account, you can leverage features like real-time analytics, domain integration, and bulk pin creation.\n\nCheck out this Pinterest business page by The Blonde Abroad to see what your account can look like:\n\nPinterest tips for travel bloggers\n\nWhatever you do, don’t forget to use a Pinterest business account for your travel blog\n\nCustomize your photos with a tool like Canva to add CTAs, links, and other text overlays\n\nLink your travel blog to your Pinterest business account\n\nRead my Pinterest traffic guide for more tips.\n\nBuild your travel blog’s community on Facebook\n\nWhile the social networks above are great for sharing content, Facebook is perfect for community building.\n\nFacebook lets you join groups, jump into conversations, and react to other people’s posts with your brand front and center. It can also serve as the central hub for your content distribution efforts — be it through videos or blog posts.\n\nAs a Facebook page owner, you can also use advanced features like “Mentorship” to build a great community. I personally use this feature on the private Master Blogging community — check it out and consider joining!\n\nFor ideas and inspiration, take a look at the Facebook page of A Dangerous Business travel blog:\n\nFacebook tips for travel bloggers\n\nJoin Facebook groups to connect with a wider audience and potential influencers\n\nCreate and promote CTA buttons on your Facebook page\n\nSet up Frequently Asked Questions or FAQs to provide quick information\n\nCreate automated responses for people who contact you through Facebook Messenger\n\nDon’t ignore comments and direct messages — Facebook isn’t the place for that\n\nJoin travel-related subreddits\n\nReddit is a popular network that isn’t often discussed in blogging guides and tutorials.\n\nThe main reason is that Reddit users are typically tech-savvy and can easily tell if you’re being spammy.\n\nHowever, it’s still an excellent platform for raising brand awareness and forming valuable connections that can grow your travel blog. You just need to live by a few golden rules if you want positive recognition from the community.\n\nOne of these rules is to avoid mentioning your travel blog unless it naturally fits the conversation. It’s also important to join the right subreddits where your travel blog content can be appreciated.\n\nr/SoloTravel is an example of a travel-related subreddit you can join and share travel posts on.\n\nReddit tips for travel bloggers\n\nNever be overly promotional — Reddit users have a keen sense for spam\n\nOnly post travel-related content on travel-related subreddits\n\nPrioritize adding value to conversations even if you don’t have to mention your blog\n\nLet Reddit users naturally become interested in your blog by answering questions and providing insightful advice\n\nAnswer travel-related questions on Quora\n\nIf there’s one place you’ll find people who need your expertise, it’s a Q&A website like Quora.\n\nLoyal Master Blogging readers will know that I already wrote a post dedicated to Quora marketing. There, I unveiled a step-by-step strategy that will help you turn questions into high-quality blog traffic.\n\nThe plan here is simple: look for relevant questions, offer solutions, and mention your blog if necessary.\n\nQuora’s user interface should be simple enough for you to figure out how to look for questions to start with. Just enter a keyword and wait for suggestions to pop up.\n\nIf there are no suggestions right off the bat, select ‘Search: your keyword’ for a list of posted questions.\n\nQuora tips for travel bloggers\n\nBuild a detailed bio with links to your travel blog\n\nCreate a Quora topic using your travel blog name\n\nWhen answering questions, provide a lot of valuable paragraphs and slide in the link naturally\n\nTurn questions into content ideas\n\nDue to the number of marketers on Quora, consider using paid ads to cut through the content noise\n\nBuild an email list\n\nAs a professional blogger, you absolutely can’t forego email marketing.\n\nBuilding an email list is a great way to collect and nurture potential leads. Additionally, it’ll give you a steady source of quality traffic if you do lead segmentation and content promotions right.\n\nTo create an email list, you’ll need an email marketing platform.\n\nPopular platforms like ActiveCampaign allow you to automate emails, manage your lists, create subscription forms, and more. In simpler terms, they provide everything you need to have an email marketing campaign up and running.\n\nFor more information on ActiveCampaign along with possible alternatives, read 11 Best Email Marketing Services for Bloggers.\n\nEmail marketing tips for travel bloggers\n\nAutomate a welcome email with links to your travel blog’s top content\n\nIf you sell products, automate birthday emails that offer special discounts\n\nTo generate more subscribers, try offering an opt-in bribe like a free eBook, template, or Lightroom presets\n\nNever use your audience’s emails to send spam\n\nTry to use plain text emails more often since they’re proven to generate more click-throughs\n\nIf you’re sending newsletters, try to keep the word count low and include links to useful resources instead\n\nUse Google Analytics to integrate data into your decision-making process\n\nIf you purchased a SEMrush for keyword and content research, you already have a capable analytics tool for your blog.\n\nIf not, use Google Analytics to track important website data.\n\nGoogle Analytics is a free service that will equip you with tools to stay on top of your blog’s performance. It can track your traffic, bounce rate, top traffic sources, session duration, conversions, and more.\n\nThe platform can also give you a closer look at your blog audience.

If you’d like to try something else, refer to this list of 17 blog promotion tactics.\n\nHow to Make Money as a Travel Blogger\n\nA lot of aspiring travel bloggers are probably looking forward to this section.\n\nThat’s completely understandable.\n\nIf you truly enjoy travel, you’ll do whatever it takes to make it a sustainable lifestyle.\n\nThere are multiple ways to make it happen.\n\nMaking money with advertisements\n\nThe easiest way to make money off of a travel blog is to show ads.\n\nTrue, it may not be the most lucrative monetization strategy. Being irresponsible with ad placements can also hurt the user experience on your site.\n\nBut if you do things right, ads can provide you with enough funds to keep your blog running.\n\nThere are two ways to make money with ads on your travel blog:\n\nPartnering with an ad network\n\nAn easy way to start making money with ads is through an ad network like Google AdSense.\n\nThe main advantage of joining an ad network are the instant connections with potential advertisers. You just need to worry about creating an account and designating ad spaces on your blog.\n\nNetworks like AdSense will do most of the work from there — supplying ads that match your content.\n\nSelling advertising spaces directly\n\nYou can make more money with advertisements by selling ad spaces directly to other companies.\n\nThere are a few differences between this strategy and working with an advertising network.\n\nFor one, you control which brands get to advertise on your travel blog. You’re also in charge of the appearance and formats of your banner advertising spaces.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work. But with a plugin like Advanced Ads, you can set up these ad spaces with ease.\n\nHow can you promote your advertising spaces to brands?\n\nIt’s as simple as writing an “advertise with us” or “work with us” page and mentioning your offer.\n\nHere’s an example from Getting On Travel:\n\nPromoting affiliate products to your readers\n\nFull disclosure: affiliate marketing is my go-to monetization strategy for my own blog.\n\nIn a nutshell, affiliate marketing lets bloggers earn commissions by promoting another company’s products or services.\n\nI can probably write a complete listicle that discusses everything I love about affiliate marketing. But to keep this post short, I’ll just highlight the best benefits of being an affiliate marketer.\n\nWork with companies you love — Affiliate marketing is the best way to promote products that you’d personally vouch for. If you truly care about your readers, you’d help them acquire the tools to accomplish their goals.\n\nGenerate decent passive income — There are affiliate marketing programs for travel bloggers that offer up to 80 percent commissions. This income is passive, which means you can make money from your affiliate marketing content as long as it’s live.\n\nEarn based on your performance — There’s a science to running affiliate marketing campaigns. You’ll be handsomely rewarded if you can zero in on factors that affect conversions and click-throughs.\n\nGet free incentives — Apart from the commissions, being a profitable affiliate marketer in the travel niche has a few other perks. An example would be the free trips, cash bonuses, and other incentives for performing at a certain level.\n\nFree marketing materials — Most affiliate marketing programs provide their members with free marketing materials for promotional purposes. There’s no need to spend time and money creating those materials yourself.\n\nLow barrier to entry, high ceiling — Believe it or not, even the biggest affiliate marketing networks don’t charge their members a single cent. Other than that, you can join as many affiliate programs as you can manage to multiply your profits.\n\nConnect with established brands in the travel industry — Being affiliated with well-known companies is good for your personal brand. Not only that, but you can also connect with like-minded people who joined the same affiliate programs.\n\nPromote products without being too salesy — Affiliate marketing lets you hit the sweet spot between your content’s profitability and reader experience factor. Just write a product review, comparison post, or product listicle and your affiliate link should fit right in.\n\nTo get started in the affiliate marketing industry, look for programs that pique your interest in this list.\n\nSelling digital products\n\nIf you want to make a name in the travel industry, you won’t settle with just selling another company’s products.\n\nYou need to put your thinking cap on, develop an idea, and build something to plaster your name on.\n\nCreating digital products, be it an eBook or online course, is a great entry point for new bloggers.\n\neBooks, in particular, won’t cost a fortune to make. As for online courses, there are platforms like Teachable that will help you develop eLearning products from the ground up.\n\nSelling your travel photos\n\nBeing a travel blogger obliges you to, at least, make an effort to improve your photography skills.\n\nIt’s not something every travel blogger does. But if you can consistently take professional-quality photographs, you can make money by selling them on your website.\n\nJonathan Look Jr. of Life Part 2 does this by allowing users to purchase photos straight from their blog.\n\nTravel bloggers can also make a good sum of money by publishing sponsored posts on their blog.\n\nThis is a monetization opportunity that isn’t limited to the travel niche.\n\nThe premise is simple: you get paid for publishing content that puts another brand on a positive light. It doesn’t matter who creates the sponsored content to be published.\n\nSome travel bloggers refuse to publish sponsored posts because they think it makes their blog disingenuous. Others, however, are more open to the idea as long as they stick to a few rules:\n\nMention that a post is sponsored upfront\n\nWrite the sponsored post yourself so it stays on-brand\n\nBe honest and use real opinions — mention this to the brand sponsoring you\n\nGetting paid to travel through press trips\n\nPress trips allow travel bloggers to make money doing what they love.\n\nIn this arrangement, a company plans and pays for a trip to a specific location. In exchange, the travel blogger agrees to provide them with exposure, featured content, or both.\n\nYou can say that a press trip is somewhat similar to publishing a sponsored post. The main difference is, press trips actually require you to travel to the destination you’re writing about.\n\nSponsored posts may also cover products, services, and people — not just travel destinations.\n\nThere are two ways to get opportunities to do press trips with organizations.\n\nIf you’re already a big-shot travel blogger, watch out for proposals in your email inbox. Otherwise, your best hope is to pitch press trip proposals to organizations yourself.\n\nWhat you should remember is to put the growth of your travel blog first before cold pitches for press trips. Building an authoritative brand in the travel niche will make you more attractive to prospects, anyway.\n\nRunning social media promotion campaigns\n\nFor travel bloggers who manage to build a sizeable blog readership, establishing a social media presence should be relatively easy.\n\nThat puts you on the radar of organizations that need a hand in the tricky world of social media marketing.\n\nJust like sponsored posts and press trips, social media promotion campaigns can start with either you or a prospective brand. When a deal is struck it usually ends with you receiving payment for certain deliverables on social media.\n\nAs for the deliverables, it can be any form of social media content promotion over a specific period of time. It could be anything from a single Instagram post to a social media takeover.\n\nThe bigger your name is on social media, the more you can charge for social media collaborations.\n\nTaking on brand ambassadorships\n\nYou may offer both sponsored posts and managed social media campaigns as individual packages.\n\nBut what if your prospect wants to do a little bit of both?\n\nAs a brand ambassador, you can offer them regular promotions through your blog, social media, and other content distribution channels. In turn, you’ll make more money than you would if you accept sponsored post and social media campaign proposals separately.\n\nTo get the attention of brands, I advise putting together a blogging media kit. You can then mention your willingness to accept brand ambassadorships on your blog.\n\nThis is how Yulia of Miss Tourist does it:\n\nOrganizing tours and events\n\nIf travel planning is your passion, you can turn it into a money-making machine by organizing travel events.\n\nThis can be done with or without the collaboration of a local tour company.\n\nFor the DIY route, a feasible idea is to organize planned tours of your local area. That’s given you’re already settled in a region or country with well-known travel spots.\n\nThere are, of course, travel blogs that take this idea to a whole new level.\n\nThe Adventurists, for example, organize wacky outdoor activities on an international scale. For one, they host “The Mongol Rally” where participants traverse 10,000 miles of rough road in a car or bike.\n\nIt’s not exactly a monetization strategy you can plan and roll out over the weekend. But if you can grasp the logistics and execution of such events, it’ll put your travel blog on the map.\n\nOffering content writing services\n\nThere is a clear line between publishing sponsored posts and being a content contributor for hire.\n\nWith sponsored posts, you agree to publish content you may or may have written on your own blog. As a content writer for hire, you offer your skills to produce content for another website.\n\nYour travel blog has all you need to prove that your content writing skills are up to par. All that’s left to do is offer your content writing services in your “work with me” page.\n\nYou may also choose the type of brands you want to contribute content to. It can be an online magazine, another travel blog, a destination, and so on.\n\nNaturally, the way you present this service is entirely up to you. It can be mentioned in a bulleted list or highlighted with a simple visual, like what A Broken Backpack does.\n\nAttending public speaking engagements\n\nSpeaking at your first event is indeed one of the most memorable milestones in the blogging career path.\n\nI’ve been to a few speaking engagements myself. And from my experience, being on stage for the very first time changes you.\n\nIt reminds you that, as a blogger, you are given the privilege to inspire other doers.\n\nRemember, most if not all people who attend these events have big ideas themselves. A speaker encourages them to take action and bring about positive change to the world.\n\nSuch instances are where a successful blogger can truly find fulfillment.\n\nIf you’re interested in speaking gigs, I recommend signing up for a service like Agent.\n\nOf course, you should also mention that you’re willing to take on public speaking engagements on your blog.\n\nOffering consultancy services\n\nFinally, a handful of accomplished travel bloggers offer to share experienced-based, expert insights to companies for a price.\n\nBeing a consultant in the travel industry encompasses a range of project types. This includes product development for tour companies, staff training for destinations, marketing for online travel sites, and so on.\n\nUncornered Market is one of the few travel blogs that can offer consultancy services for a range of areas.\n\nConclusion\n\nCongratulations — you now know all about how to be a travel blogger and make money along the way.\n\nMy last piece of advice for you is to go and get started today.\n\nHead on to a website like Bluehost, host your blog, and claim your success. Your blogging career can’t go anywhere if you don’t take the first step!\n\nIf you have questions, try searching for them in my blog. I probably already wrote a full-length guide about them.\n\nGood luck — I’m rooting for you!\n\nYou Might Also Like:"
