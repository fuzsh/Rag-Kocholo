        "text": "The “Best” WordPress Hosting (2024): 46 Plans Compared In 1 Spreadsheet: Specs, Resources, CDNs, Complaints On TrustPilot\n\nUpdated on:\n\nBefore getting hosting reviews from Reddit/Facebook groups (both tend to be censored by moderators paid to favor certain companies), try this spreadsheet.\n\nIt took me several months of 2024 digging through each host’s website, TOS/AUP pages, and bugging support about specs/policies. I even sifted through 1-2 star TrustPilot reviews to see how many complaints were about performance, resource limits, downtime… other categories.\n\nBesides collecting specs, I’ve spent a lot of time reading feedback in Facebook groups and Reddit, and I often use links/screenshots to back up the data with feedback from real people. This is still biased since I’m choosing which sources to use, but you could argue they’re better recommendations since many Facebook groups are controlled by SiteGround, Reddit is in bed with Knownhost, and 5 star TrustPilot reviews are often solicited. And while I’m an affiliate for the “good” hosts in this review, I’ve gotten banned/threatened by several for speaking on their issues… you can choose if that means anything. Drop me a comment if you need any help at all.\n\nShared Hosting\n\nNot Recommended\n\nSiteGround – low CPU/resource limits with account suspensions are the 3rd highest complaint they’re often criticized for. The first two are price (including autorenewals billing you 15 days prior) and declined support since ~2021. They develop custom products used to replace cPanel, Cloudflare, and cache plugins. However, they usually have bugs, compatibility issues, and inferior performance. They’re also non-transferable if you leave… which you likely will after your 1 year renewal price jumps by ~5x. When mistakes are made, blame is put on partners, like Google/Amazon when their DNS blocked 2M sites from Google. Most of their customers came from GoDaddy, Bluehost, and worse hosting. But there’s not 1 mention of ‘LiteSpeed’ in SiteGround’s TrustPilot reviews, despite being a faster server. They only have glowing reviews from affiliate marketing and censorship; SiteGround’s brand ambassador Ivica is an admin for many Facebook groups and manipulates recommendations to favor SiteGround while posing as a “customer.” The value isn’t there, and if you’re using them, be sure you turn autorenewal OFF.\n\nHostinger – cheap because you get even less resources (~10x less I/O than most hosts), 1 GB email storage, and weekly backups stop at 30GB. Email also has low limits and often sent to spam, IPs blacklisted, and fake DMCA reports shut down websites. Based in Lithuania with one of the highest number of scam reports and fake reviews their CEO admitted to. Support is arguably the worst in the industry (their #1 complaint) with an AI assistant and staff I would not trust with your site.\n\nBluehost/HostGator – owned by Newfold Digital (formerly EIG) who infamously uses outdated technology, does little innovation, and can be described as cookie cutter hosting brands designed to profit investors for a publicly traded company.\n\nGoDaddy – low resources like Hostinger, but often less with 250,000 inodes, 500 KB/s I/O limit, and strict email limits. GoDaddy has a security breach nearly every 1-2 years with malware problems. They’re one of the only hosts charging for SSL with a catalog of unnecessary upsells. Panel is extremely limited, they blacklist plugins, and migrations suggest GoDaddy is significantly slower than LiteSpeed. Managed WordPress hosting has improved with NVMe SSDs, but it’s still GoDaddy.\n\nNameCheap EasyWP – poor plan reviews and the lowest amount of cores/RAM with additional limits, no email, and similar backup policies to Hostinger. There’s no object cache, OPcache, full page caching on their Supersonic CDN, and clients say the EasyWP cache plugin “sucks.” Fine for domain names, not shared hosting.\n\nGreenGeeks – quite a few scam reports about how hard it is to cancel your plan since you have to send them a chain of emails. Emails only get 250 MB of storage, backup retention is 2 days, and advertises “unlimited” resources, but they’re not.\n\nWPX – campaign of the “fastest WordPress hosting” was debunked when their own website said they target a 400ms TTFB. WPX’s CDN (called XDN) doesn’t support full page caching which means a slower TTFB, especially when visitors aren’t close to their server locations (US, UK, AU). Frequent downtimes and poor response to a global outage left “price” being the reason they don’t have a redundancy system. The CEO has also been criticized for being out of touch with the industry and rude.\n\nRecommended (With LiteSpeed)\n\nChemiCloud – faster specs (LiteSpeed, NVMe SSDs, Redis, MariaDB) and more resources (3 CPU cores + 3 GB RAM) which are scalable to 6/6 using their Turbo Boost add-on. Which means you’re not stuck with fixed resources for 1-3 years if traffic grows. Non-affiliates coming from SiteGround say they like ChemiCloud’s LiteSpeed/cPanel and that it’s “way cheaper” and “much better,” especially their support. This also includes 19 people on TrustPilot. Static sites (like this one) can get a ~100ms global TTFB with QUIC.cloud CDN’s full page caching. They have 9 locations for shared hosting and I suggest the WordPress Turbo plan for $4.95/mo. They do up to 10 free non-cPanel migrations (i.e. from Site Tools) and 200 cPanel.\n\nNameHero – similar to ChemiCloud between performance/resources. The main differences are NameHero costs more, only has 1 data center, but their I/O limit is higher with more IOPs/EPs/NProcs. However, backups policies are much stricter (only 1 backup which stops at 100,000 inodes or 20 GB disk space) and they have more complaints, specifically about billing/suspensions. Ryan (NameHero CEO) is a genuinely nice guy if you check out his tutorials found on their YouTube channel.\n\nMechanicWeb – AMD Ryzen servers with 5.7 GHz turbo frequencies are some of the fastest shared hosting can get, especially when combined with LiteSpeed. They were also a top performer in Kevin’s Ohashi’s 2022 hosting benchmarks. Based out of Bangladesh and while they only have 7 TrustPilot reviews, they’ve been around for a long time and are active in web hosting forums with staff who clearly know their stuff. They don’t use object cache with less cores/RAM/storage, but monthly pricing is affordable. Unpopular since they don’t do much marketing.\n\nNotes\n\nWhen autorenewal is on, most hosts will charge you before the renewal date. Check their TOS and add the billing date in your calendar to prevent a surprise. This is why “billing” is one of the most common complaints in TrustPilot reviews.\n\nLiteSpeed’s advantages go beyond a faster, resource-efficient server. LiteSpeed’s PHP also outperforms FPM/FCGI… PHP.net says “LSAPI is similar to FCGI, but is more efficient” and that it’s a “highly optimized API.” LiteSpeed Cache optimizes web vitals with more features than most cache plugins, and QUIC.cloud’s CDN is currently #1 on CDN Performance Tracker (just make sure to use QUIC’s paid plan).\n\nNVMe SSDs, Redis, and MariaDB > traditional hard drives, Memcached, and MySQL.\n\nCloud Hosting\n\nNot Recommended\n\nKinsta – resource limits and poor performance are the 2 main reasons not to use Kinsta. They charge $100/mo for open source software (Redis) with low limits on monthly visits, PHP workers, a 256 MB memory limit, and staging sites only get 1 CPU core. WooCommerce sites will be starved of resources and performance is worse without NVMe SSDs, a slower DNS (Amazon Route 53), and no Argo Smart Routing (since their Cloudflare integration isn’t Enterprise). They started moving from Google Cloud C2 to C3D (calling them boosted regions) but it doesn’t solve either resource/performance problems. A marketing company dressed as hosting.\n\nWP Engine – very similar to Kinsta with near identical resource limits, incomplete Cloudflare integration, and poor performance with slower SSDs on Google Cloud C2. Both were also injected with massive amounts of cash with a leadership team focused on growth over performance/tech… likely why they barely list any specs.\n\nSiteGround Cloud – their “faster CPUs” are the slowest of all cloud hosts in the spreadsheet. Their cloud hosting has similar problems as shared plans (no NVMe SSDs, Redis, strict CPU limits, and inferior cache plugin/CDN). Their cloud hosting TrustPilot reviews are poor and I also moved from SiteGround cloud to Cloudways.\n\nFlywheel – owned by WP Engine with similar limits and performance/reliability complaints. They have a higher percentage of downtime reports and use Fastly’s CDN, not Cloudflare. Marketed to agencies who want more hands-off hosting and cleaner control panel, but there’s a reason they only have a 2 star TrustPilot rating.\n\nElementor Cloud – few good things have been said about it. Poor specs and you should use hosting from a real hosting company, not page builder. Performance, support, and security are the 3 most common complaints. Just because they use big brands like Google Cloud + Cloudflare doesn’t mean they’re fast. Their hosting doesn’t include email, a domain registrar, and it has more limitations than normal.\n\nRecommended\n\nRocket.net – who I use (after Cloudways) with noticeably better performance, security, and support. You’re getting more resources (32 CPU cores + 128GB RAM), LiteSpeed PHP, and actually “managed” hosting with support that helps you with speed optimization tweaks, etc. Cloudflare Enterprise is free, they do unlimited free migrations, and security is better with Imunify360 + real-time malware scans. And unlike Kinsta/WPE/Flywheel, they don’t have stingy limits on CPU cores/RAM, staging resources, monthly visits, PHP workers, and PHP memory limit. Also the only host I know who advertises a 100ms global TTFB. While my site is also mostly static, they’re really meant for WooCommerce/resource-demanding sites between Cloudflare Enterprise’s ability to handle dynamic requests, Redis (Redis Pro on the Business plan and up) and NVMe SSDs with no PHP worker limits. CEO Ben Gabler is one of the smartest guys in the industry (see our interview). While they have less bandwidth, there are no hidden add-ons, low resource limits, and other “gotchas.” Here are people who migrated from other cloud hosts, and migration results from SiteGround, Kinsta, and Cloudways. 5/5 rating on TrustPilot and $1 the 1st month.\n\nGridPane – better Cloudways/RunCloud alternative if you’re running many sites, especially agencies. GridPane has a faster stack with OpenLiteSpeed, Vultr High Frequency for roughly 30% the price of Cloudways, and Patrick Gallagher’s team have much better support with a 4.7/5 star Facebook rating. Less popular due to less marketing, but very popular in unbiased Facebook groups. Like Cloudways, you’ll choose a cloud provider (i.e. Vultr, DigitalOcean, UpCloud, etc), provision a server, then deploy your site (see the getting started page). GridPane/Rocket.net both won top tier awards in Kevin Ohashi’s WP Hosting Benchmarks the last few years… Cloudways, SiteGround, Hostinger, and other overmarketed hosts did not.\n\nServebolt – arguably the fastest option with dedicated hardware and another top tier in Kevin’s Benchmarks (also who Rank Math uses). However, there are 4 main cons: Cloudflare Enterprise (accelerated domains) is $299/mo, PHP memory limit is just 256 MB, there are no refunds, and Rocket/GridPane’s support are arguably better. But for raw performance without bandwidth limits, it’s hard to beat them. The only reason I don’t mention them more is they’re mainly for Enterprise clients on a $400/mo budget (plans start at $99/mo + $299/mo for accelerated domains).\n\nCloudways – I’d mainly use them if Rocket.net is too expensive from bandwidth limits or if RunCloud/GridPane are too self-managed. Otherwise, those 3 options all outperform Cloudways who lacks support and charges ∼2x the actual price of the cloud server (scaling is expensive). They don’t use LiteSpeed’s servers or PHP, and you probably know about the unwanted changes after being acquired by DO.\n\nRapyd.cloud – only “managed” cloud host in the list using LiteSpeed servers with promising specs including AWS and Object Cache Pro. Main cons are staging sites are limited to 2 GB RAM, tier-based support means “application support” is only available for their performance plans, and the CDN is still in development. I’d wait before trusting my site with any new host, but add to your radar for dynamic sites.\n\nNotes\n\n“Managed” hosting – Patrick Gallagher explains what it actually means. While most of it boils down to support, some hosts can’t properly “manage” their own infrastructure and leave you with bugs, compatibility issues, and more work due to unwanted changes. SiteGround/Cloudways are on the lower tier of “managed” since they hardly tick any boxes. Rocket.net and Rapyd.cloud (if you have Rapyd’s support plans) are somewhere in the middle and both will help with performance optimizations. “Fully managed” costs quite a bit more, but that would be Pagely. Review Patrick’s definition and learn which features of managed hosting you want.\n\nNo email hosting on cloud hosting – I generally recommend Google Workspace. Keeping your email, domain(s), and web hosting separate is a good idea anyways.\n\nCloudflare integrations aren’t the same – Kinsta and WPE don’t advertise their CDNs as “Cloudflare Enterprise” since they don’t use Argo Smart Routing (which can improve TTFB by 33%), Tiered Cache, or load balancing. Similar to Cloudways when it didn’t have full page caching. Some also have caching issues or cost extra.\n\nPHP workers – if you’re on Kinsta/WPX or another host who limits them, read this.\n\nControl panels – launching your own cloud server on RunCloud (which supports OpenLiteSpeed) or another control panel can often yield better performance and cost savings compared to Cloudways. The major downside is control panels aren’t known for support (about 50% of RunCloud’s complaints) with less ‘hand holding.’\n\nVideo interviews – even if you’re not considering Rocket.net or GridPane, you can learn a lot by watching this interview with Ben Gabler or this one with Ben/Patrick.\n\nVPS Hosting\n\nNot Recommended\n\nHostinger – read their critical VPS reviews before buying. Common problems are resource limits + suspensions, blacklisted IPs, emails sent to spam, non-existent support, and OS with functions that simply don’t work. No free migrations either.\n\nChemiCloud – CPU processors on VPS plans have some of the slowest base & turbo frequencies (alongside GreenGeeks/InMotion). VPS renewals are also very expensive, and while these are really the only 2 cons of their VPS plans, price and performance are important… hence why I only recommend their shared hosting.\n\nInMotion/GreenGeeks – neither of their VPS plans use LiteSpeed, and both use slower CPU processors with 3.1 GHz turbo frequencies. However, InMotion uses NVMe SSDs + Redis with 2x more RAM for a much cheaper price. A few other cons are $199 migrations, Platform I’s bad reviews, and support/downtime complaints. I should mention that InMotion’s support (for me) was one of the most responsive.\n\nRecommended\n\nScala – some of the better VPS specs with 4 GHz turbo frequency CPUs and OpenLiteSpeed found under SPanel → Web Server Manager. SPanel saves you from having to buy 3 add-ons (LiteSpeed license, Softaculous, and Imunify360) since SPanel already has a 1-click installer and SShield security. It also uses less resources than cPanel. Some people are skeptical from their perfect reviews, but fake hosts usually don’t have this many specific reviews about their VPS (100 98% positive VPS reviews and 28 migrations from other hosts). I’ve seen some isolated complaints on minor downtimes/support and their docs could be improved, but nothing major. Do your research but they were completely fine when I tried them.\n\nNameHero – VPS reviews are mostly good, but add-ons are expensive ($20/mo LiteSpeed, $25/mo CloudLinux, even Softaculous is $1.50/mo). You also get less storage and they don’t disclose which CPUs they use for security reasons. If you’re happy with their shared plans and don’t mind add-on prices, it could be a good fit.\n\nMechanicWeb – similar thing as their shared hosting; great specs but unpopular from lack of marketing without a lot of reviews (but several in forums/Facebook).\n\nDreamhost – only non-LiteSpeed VPS host I would consider looking into. Most of their VPS reviews are positive but the 3 main cons are resources, downtimes, and their control panel. Resource complaints should be expected since they advertise “unlimited” when unlimited doesn’t exist. Also wish they used NVMe SSDs + Redis.\n\nNotes\n\nOpenLiteSpeed vs. LiteSpeed Enterprise – while OpenLiteSpeed has several advantages over Apache, LiteSpeed Enterprise has more. It uses a more powerful cache engine, advanced .htaccess caching, ESI support, SSL offloading, brute force attack protection, mod_security, it has better compatibility, and other advantages.\n\nSemi-Dedicated Hosting\n\nNot Recommended\n\nSiteGround – ~50% of GoGeek reviews are negative. While CPU limits are higher than GrowBig, GoGeek still has less storage, inodes, and inferior/outdated specs than plans in the $45/mo range (i.e. Scala, MechanicWeb, Rocket.net, RunCloud).\n\nA2 Hosting – semi-dedicated “Takeoff” plans don’t use LiteSpeed or NVMe SSDs, yet the 3 year price (including renewals) costs even more than SiteGround GoGeek.\n\nRecommended\n\nScala – Entry Cloud plan uses dedicated/isolated resources with OpenLiteSpeed, 50GB (scalable) NVMe storage, MariaDB 10.6 (instead of MySQL 5.7 on SiteGround), Redis, and no inode restrictions. Several advantages over GoGeek, but it costs less.\n\nMechanicWeb – faster specs (still using AMD Ryzen servers), more resources, and cheaper than GoGeek. Would use this or Entry Cloud when going semi-dedicated.\n\nKnownhost – main cons are low limits and costs more than Scala/MechanicWeb.\n\nReseller Hosting\n\nNot Recommended\n\nSiteGround – constant changes in their infrastructure and “surprises” without notice will likely make it time consuming dealing with changes as their reseller. This is the biggest reason their reseller plans have ~50% negative reviews. For example, you’re relying on SiteGround’s own billing system instead of WHMCS.\n\nA2 Hosting – considering the high percentage of complaints about performance, resources, downtimes, and support, you don’t want to deal with this as a reseller.\n\nGreenGeeks – resources + support are the 2 main complaints of reseller accounts.\n\nRecommended\n\nChemiCloud – only complaint I’ve seen are downtimes and blacklisted emails.\n\nNameHero – 63 reviews with most complaints about downtimes/suspensions.\n\nMechanicWeb – in the only review of their reseller plan, they said they “already notice a difference in site speed” which is exactly what MechanicWeb is known for.\n\nRocket.net – if you like their hosting (i.e. performance, support, and how hands-off it is), their reseller program costs more than most, but can save you quite a bit of time. It includes WHMCS, native WooCommerce integration, and is white label.\n\nNotes\n\nWHMCS vs. Blesta – WHMCS is the industry standard which is generally less complicated and has more features. There’s a post about this in the WordPress Hosting FB group (from 2018, but still applicable since WHMCS is still preferred).\n\nSummary\n\nLiteSpeed for shared hosting (Chemi, NameHero, Scala’s Entry Cloud plan).\n\nRocket.net for WooCommerce/resource-demanding sites if their bandwidth limits are in your budget. If not, look into Rapyd.cloud (newer cloud host with LiteSpeed, AWS, and Object Cache Pro) or Servebolt (the host Rank Math uses).\n\nRunCloud or GridPane for performant/cost-effective hosting on OpenLiteSpeed. Definitely more self-managed but worth it if you manage several high traffic sites.\n\nScala or MechanicWeb for VPS or semi-dedicated. Both support OpenLiteSpeed and Scala’s SPanel can save you from spending money on add-ons. They use CPUs with 4 GHz turbo frequencies and MechanicWeb uses AMD Ryzen servers (5.7 GHz).\n\nMeasuring Hosting Performance & TTFB\n\nSpeedVitals TTFB Test – measure TTFB in 40 global locations (shown as “average worldwide TTFB”) but the developers say to run a couple tests to ensure resources are cached and your CDN serves files from the closest data center. Basically, run 3 tests and check the average worldwide TTFB of the 3rd test. Hosting/CDNs are the 2 biggest factors.\n\nWordPress Hosting Benchmark – runs CPU, memory, database, object cache, and network tests to give you an overall score out of 10. Here’s a screenshot of a test I ran.\n\nWP Server Health Stats – doesn’t measure performance but shows stats about your server (software, CPU cores + CPU usage, RAM + RAM usage, database and PHP info, etc).\n\nWPPerformanceTester – what Kevin Ohashi uses for his WordPress hosting benchmarks.\n\nHow To Find (Kind Of) Unbiased Hosting Reviews\n\nKevin Ohashi – WP Hosting Benchmarks and Review Signal have some of the most unbiased reviews and performance tests I’ve seen. Instead of making money through affiliate commissions, Kevin charges hosts a flat fee to be included in his extensive tests.\n\nWP Speed Matters Facebook Group – probably the least biased group for hosting/speed recommendations. Run by Gijo from FlyingPress so still biased, but less than most groups. Members seem to know what they’re talking about, not just blindly say “+1 for ABC host.”\n\n1-2 Star TrustPilot Reviews – use the keyword filters from the “TrustPilot Complaints” section of the spreadsheet by copying the end of the URL after ?search= and adding it to any host’s TrustPilot profile. Or try searching 1-2 star reviews for feedback on their CDN, cache plugin, and migrations. For example, search “SiteGround” in Rocket.net’s reviews and there are several. Then search “Rocket.net” in SiteGround’s reviews and there are 0.\n\nGet Your Hosting From A Hosting Company\n\nNot Elementor Cloud, NameCheap, GoDaddy, Kinsta, and other companies who started as something else (page builder, domain registrar, marketing company) then went into hosting.\n\nHosting Is The #1 Speed Factor\n\nWordPress has always listed this as the #1 factor (although their hosting recommendations are paid garbage) and TTFB is also 40% of LCP in core web vitals. I see a lot of people complaining about web vitals not thinking hosting is the problem, then they switch and see instant results. CDNs are arguably just as important for reducing TTFB and is why you should use a performant CDN like Cloudflare Enterprise, QUIC.cloud, or BunnyCDN (not RocketCDN or SiteGround CDN).\n\nHow Important Is Choosing A Close Data Center?\n\nAre visitors in 1 location? Then it matters.\n\nAre visitors in multiple locations? Then the difference is negligible when you’re using a good CDN with full page caching (and ideally Argo Smart Routing for dynamic/WooCommerce sites).\n\nHope you learned something,\n\nTom\n\nYou Might Also Like:"
