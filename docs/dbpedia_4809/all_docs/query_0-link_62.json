        "text": "If you find yourself on the journey of managing a website, you know the endless to-do list can be intimidating. You also know how important it is to find a great web hosting service. After all, a web host is how you get your website up and running for the public to enjoy.\n\nFinding a web host presents a whole new set of challenges. You have to consider things like page speed and uptime guarantees, not to mention security and cost.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are even more factors to consider when it comes to choosing your web host. I’ve created this comprehensive comparison so that you can see for yourself how two of the most popular web hosts stack up.\n\nGoDaddy and SiteGround are very different companies with different strengths and weaknesses. If you’re struggling to choose between the two, read ahead to find out which company is actually better.\n\nTable Of Contents\n\nWhich One is More Reliable?\n\nWhich One is Easier to Use?\n\nWhich One is Faster?\n\nWhich One Has Cheaper Hosting Plans?\n\nWhich One Has Better Customer Service and Support?\n\nWhich Has Better Security?\n\nWhich one is the overall winner?\n\nWhat is SiteGround?\n\nSiteGround is a web hosting company that was started back in 2004 by a group of college friends. It’s grown into a well-regarded company, serving around 2 million domains worldwide. They have data centers in the US, Spain, Bulgaria, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs they’ve grown in popularity, they have remained dedicated to maintaining a high standard of service to their customers. SiteGround currently remains under private ownership.\n\nSiteGround has a comprehensive set of plans that encompass a solid set of features. They have in-house teams dedicated to customer support and security. SiteGround offers plans for shared web hosting, WordPress hosting, dedicated cloud hosting, and reseller hosting.\n\nSiteGround has much to offer for both small and large businesses. They have implemented several affordable plans with the ability to grow and manage several websites. SiteGround offers tons of unlimited features, excellent security, and good value.\n\nWhat is GoDaddy?\n\nGoDaddy is a company that provides web hosting, website builders, domains, marketing, and web security solutions. GoDaddy has been around for longer than most web hosting companies.\n\nWay back in 1997, Baltimore entrepreneur Bob Parsons came out of retirement to start GoDaddy. He originally wanted to call the company, “Big Daddy’” but the domain was already taken, and settled on “GoDaddy,” instead.\n\nGoDaddy has been around for over two decades and they have a lot to show for it. In 2018, they became the largest web host in the world. Today, they host over 72 million domains with 14 offices placed around the world. Compared to SiteGround, this number of domains is absolutely massive.\n\nGoDaddy’s philosophy is to empower entrepreneurs with the right tools to be successful. They offer several types of web hosting including, business hosting, reseller hosting, WordPress hosting, VPS, and dedicated hosting. They also have a website builder as well as affordable domains.\n\nBecause GoDaddy has so many hosting options, it’s a good option for small to large businesses. This option gives you the convenience of a web builder and web host from the same provider.\n\nWhat Type of Hosting Service Should You Choose?\n\nChoosing a web host is difficult enough, but do you know what type of hosting will suit your business the best? There are tons of options between GoDaddy and SiteGround, including shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated hosting, and more. So, let’s take a look at what these options really mean.\n\nShared Hosting: Shared hosting just means that you will be sharing your hosting service with other websites. This option is great for small businesses or websites that aren’t expected to get a huge amount of traffic. With shared hosting, each website is responsible for sticking to its allotted data. This is typically the most affordable option as well.\n\nVPS Hosting: This type of hosting is the next step up from shared hosting. VPS hosting, short for “virtual private server” is the best option for mid-sized businesses and websites that expect heavier traffic. This option will provide a singular hosting environment, meaning you’re the only business with access to these resources. You can usually host several websites with this hosting service.\n\nDedicated Hosting: This option is typically only necessary for complex websites with a ton of traffic. Dedicated hosting means that your website has access to a full server that is managed by the web host. With dedicated web hosting, you usually have access to top-notch security, user support, and an excellent feature set. Of course, this option is also the most expensive.\n\nWordPress Hosting: Both of these web hosts offer WordPress hosting, which is essentially shared hosting that’s been optimized specifically for WordPress websites. This option is usually affordable and perfect for simple WordPress sites.\n\nSiteGround vs GoDaddy:\n\nNow that you have a better idea of the types of web hosting you’ll need, let’s jump right into the comparisons.\n\nBoth SiteGround and GoDaddy offer extensive web hosting services, but each has different strengths and weaknesses. In order to judge which host is better, we will be looking at the following criteria:\n\nReliability\n\nEase-of-Use\n\nSpeed\n\nCost\n\nCustomer Support\n\nSecurity\n\nLet’s get into it. In a face-off between SiteGround and GoDaddy, which one is actually better?\n\n1. Which One is More Reliable?\n\nWhen it comes to reliability in a web host, there’s one major factor to consider: uptime. Uptime is the amount of time your website is kept up and running for your visitors. This is obviously a critically important feature for the success of your site.\n\nWhen you choose your web host, you’ll want to look for an uptime guarantee that ensures the host takes responsibility for any downtime.\n\nWhat causes downtime? Although most hosts are pretty good about keeping your site up for the majority of the time, there are factors that cause downtime for every host.\n\nThese factors include scheduled maintenance, security issues, and power outages. Other than these events, your site should be kept up and running around the clock.\n\nWhy is the uptime rate important for your business? Let’s say a web host offers a 99.0% uptime rate. That seems pretty great. Only 1% downtime guaranteed!\n\nWell, here’s the bad news: even 1% downtime is equal to 87 hours of downtime per year. Yeah, that’s a lot. Easy to see how this could have a big effect on the success of your business, right? This is why so many web hosts offer a close to 100% uptime guarantee.\n\nSiteGround vs GoDaddy\n\nThis is a crucial test, so which web host comes through with the best uptime rates? Let’s look at the uptime guarantees from both SiteGround and GoDaddy, break down the numbers, and see who has the best offer.\n\nRight off the bat, SiteGround is coming in with a 99.99% uptime guarantee based on a year of service. These are the numbers you want to see when choosing a host.\n\nThis equals just one hour of downtime per year. What happens if they don’t meet the guarantee?\n\nSiteGround offers users a month of free services for uptimes rates between 99.00%-99.90%. You’ll receive an additional month for every percentage below 99.00%.\n\nGoDaddy also offers a pretty good uptime guarantee of 99.90% uptime per month. Now, it may be nitpicky, but this uptime guarantee is not quite as high as SiteGround’s guarantee.\n\nIn fact, if you experienced this rate with SiteGround, you’d be due for a free month of service.\n\nNow, if GoDaddy fails to meet this guarantee, you will be eligible to receive a 5% credit of your monthly service fee. You can apply this credit to other GoDaddy services.\n\nThe question is, what does a 5% credit really look like?\n\nLet’s say you are using the basic hosting plan, which currently costs $5.49 per month. Now, 5% of your monthly service fee amounts to…$0.27.\n\nSiteground’s free month of service looks pretty good right about now.\n\nWho’s the winner?\n\nSiteGround\n\nBoth hosts have pretty stellar uptime guarantees but SiteGround upholds extremely high standards that you won’t find with GoDaddy.\n\nOn top of that, the fine print tells us that SiteGround is willing to compensate you with at least a month of free service should the uptime guarantee fail.\n\nGoDaddy on the other hand only offers a small percentage of your monthly fee as a credit for other GoDaddy products.\n\n2. Which One is Easier to Use?\n\nThe main factor that comes into play here is the dashboard. Most web hosts use what’s called a cPanel, which is fairly intuitive for most users.\n\nThe dashboard is where you can view and manage your website. Everything from billing to domain name will be managed from the dashboard. The other factor that we look at is how beginner-friendly each panel is.\n\nSiteGround vs GoDaddy\n\nWhich company has the better dashboard? GoDaddy offers a sleek cPanel to users. This is a popular choice and many users will be comfortable using this control panel. Users can easily install applications, view helpful reminders, and access management tools using the control panel.\n\nIf you’re interested in WordPress websites, the GoDaddy dashboard has a one-click installation for WordPress. It has also incorporated a Quick Start Wizard to walk new users through the WordPress dashboard.\n\nAs of 2019, SiteGround revamped its entire control panel. They actually dedicated an entire team of people to this project to ensure that the new dashboard would be top of the line. The dashboard includes advanced technology for a better user experience.\n\nThis dashboard also comes with a full set of custom tools as well. These tools were developed to address the specific needs of SiteGround customers such as WordPress auto-updates, staging, encryption, and more.\n\nOverall, the SiteGround ground team has clearly put a lot of time and effort into creating a custom dashboard that addresses the needs of its users.\n\nWhich host is more beginner-friendly?\n\nSiteGround redesigned its dashboard with user-friendliness at the forefront of the design. They recognize that these dashboards can be extremely confusing for a beginner. With this in mind, they created a control panel with simple, easy-to-use features.\n\nGoDaddy is user-friendly in that it uses the traditional cPanel, which is familiar to anyone who’s used a web host before. Additionally, it has a few features that help guide new users through the dashboard.\n\nWho’s the winner?\n\nWe’ve got a tie\n\nAt the end of the day, both web hosts offer great control panels with user-friendly attributes. Siteground has an entire suite of custom tools that were made with the intent to help users as much as possible. GoDaddy keeps it simple with cPanel and helps users learn how to use the control panel.\n\nThis one is an even draw.\n\n3. Which One is Faster?\n\nPage speed is without a doubt one of the most important factors to consider when choosing a web host. Slow load time can have a detrimental effect on acquiring leads and making conversions.\n\nLuckily, page speed can be measured very accurately. We put a lot of trust into our web host in this arena so let’s see who comes out on top.\n\nWhat is page speed? When we talk about the speed of a web host, we’re really talking about how long it takes to load your website. This is referred to as page speed and it plays a direct role in audience decisions.\n\nA website that takes any longer than three seconds to load is a no-go. While three seconds might seem super-fast, any longer than this usually causes customers to leave the site immediately.\n\nSiteGround vs GoDaddy\n\nFirst up is SiteGround. In a head-to-head test of load time conducted by Cloudwards, SiteGround proved to have consistently fast load times. In this test, they sent 50 virtual users to a SiteGround server over the course of 5-minutes to get measurable load times.\n\nThe results showed the average load time was around 0.24 seconds. Across the web, you can find results like this, with SiteGround blazing through with wickedly fast load times.\n\nIn addition to this, SiteGround has put its focus on creating WordPress hosting with extremely fast load times. They’ve done this by incorporating a feature that inhibits render-blocking Java Scripts that typically slow down WordPress sites.\n\nGoDaddy was put to the same test over at Cloudwards to see how fast the load times are. The results were surprising. The results showed consistent load times of 0.0 milliseconds. Sounds good right?\n\nUnfortunately, this happened because the page simply wasn’t loading at all for most users! The test showed a fair amount of HTTP errors suggesting the site couldn’t handle the traffic it was receiving.\n\nNow keep in mind, tests across the web show varying results for GoDaddy load times, but these results are hard to ignore.\n\nWho’s the winner?\n\nSiteGround\n\nIn a head-to-head battle of speed, SiteGround was the clear winner. The fact that GoDaddy couldn’t handle moderate traffic to a website is a clear indication that they have some issues to work out. SiteGround handled the traffic with ease and had consistently fast load times across the board.\n\n4. Which One Has Cheaper Hosting Plans?\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a host, pricing and value cannot be ignored. I’ll keep this simple and show you exactly how much each plan costs and which features that come with them. I’m going to look at the shared and dedicated hosting plans for the purpose of this test.\n\nSiteGround vs GoDaddy\n\nSiteGround Shared Hosting Plans\n\nSiteGround vs GoDaddy\n\nSiteGround Shared Hosting Plans\n\nStart-Up Plan $3.95/mo:\n\n1 Website\n\n10 GB Web Space\n\n~ 10,000 Visits Monthly\n\nUnmetered Traffic\n\nFree WP Installation\n\nWordPress Auto updates\n\nSSL\n\nDaily Backup\n\nFree CDN\n\nFree Email Accounts\n\nWP-CLI and SSH\n\nUnlimited Databases\n\n100% renewable energy match\n\nGrow Big Plan $5.95/mo\n\nUnlimited Free Website\n\n20 GB Web Space\n\n~ 25,000 Visits Monthly\n\nUnmetered Traffic\n\nFree WP Installation\n\nWordPress Auto-updates\n\nFree SSL\n\nDaily Backup\n\nFree CDN\n\nFree Email Accounts\n\nWP-CLI and SSH\n\nUnlimited Databases\n\n100% renewable energy match\n\nDynamic Caching\n\nOn-demand Backup Copies\n\nFree Professional Site Transfer\n\nStaging\n\nAdd Collaborators\n\nGo Geek Plan $11.95/mo\n\nUnlimited Websites\n\n30 GB Web Space\n\n~ 100,000 Visits Monthly\n\nUnmetered Traffic\n\nFree WP Installation\n\nWordPress Auto-updates\n\nFree SSL\n\nDaily Backup\n\nFree CDN\n\nFree Email Accounts\n\nWP-CLI and SSH\n\nUnlimited Databases\n\n100% renewable energy match\n\nDynamic Caching\n\nOn-demand Backup Copies\n\nFree Professional Site Transfer\n\nStaging + Git\n\nAdd Collaborators\n\nWhite-label Clients\n\nHighest Tier of Resources\n\nPriority Support\n\nSiteGround Cloud Hosting Plan (Dedicated)\n\nEntry Level Plan $80/mo\n\n2 CPU Cores\n\n4 GB Memory\n\n40 GB SSD Space\n\n5 TB Data Transfer\n\nBusiness Plan $120.00/mo.\n\n3 CPU Cores\n\n6 GB Memory\n\n60 GB SSD Space\n\n5 TB Data Transfer\n\nBusiness Plus Plan $160/mo\n\n4 CPU Cores\n\n8 GB Memory\n\n80 GB SSD Space\n\n5 TB Data Transfer\n\nGoDaddy Shared Hosting Plans:\n\nEconomy $5.95/mo\n\n1 website\n\n100 GB storage capacity\n\nStandard Performance\n\n10 databases\n\nUnmetered bandwidth\n\nFree Office 365 Email – 1st year\n\nFree domain – with annual plan\n\nDelux $7.99/mo\n\nUnlimited websites\n\nUnlimited storage capacity\n\nStandard Performance\n\n25 databases\n\nUnmetered bandwidth\n\nFree Office 365 Email – 1st year\n\nFree domain – with annual plan\n\nUltimate $12.99/mo\n\nUnlimited websites\n\nUnlimited storage capacity\n\n2x Processing Power\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nUnmetered bandwidth\n\nFree Office 365 Email – 1st year\n\nFree domain – with annual plan\n\nFree Premium DNS\n\nFree SSL Certificate – 1\n\nMaximum $19.99/mo\n\nUnlimited websites\n\nUnlimited storage capacity\n\n2x Processing Power & Speed\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nUnmetered bandwidth\n\nFree Office 365 Email – 1st year\n\nFree domain – with annual plan\n\nFree Premium DNS\n\nFree SSL Certificate for the full term of your hosting plan\n\nGoDaddy Dedicated Hosting\n\nEconomy $94.99\n\n4 CPU Cores @ 3.1 GHz\n\n4 GB memory\n\n1 TB storage (RAID-1)^\n\nUnmetered bandwidth\n\n3 dedicated IPs\n\nFree 1-year SSL certificate\n\nValue $109.99\n\n4 CPU Cores @ 3.1 GHz\n\n8 GB memory\n\n1.5 TB storage (RAID-1)^\n\nUnmetered bandwidth\n\n3 dedicated IPs\n\nFree 1-year SSL certificate\n\nDeluxe $134.99\n\n4 CPU Cores @ 3.1 GHz\n\n16 GB memory\n\n2 TB storage (RAID-1)^\n\nUnmetered bandwidth\n\n3 dedicated IPs\n\nFree 1-year SSL certificate\n\nUltimate $184.99\n\n4 CPU Cores @ 3.1 GHz\n\n32 GB memory\n\n2 TB storage (RAID-1)^\n\nUnmetered bandwidth\n\n3 dedicated IPs\n\nFree 1-year SSL certificate\n\nWho’s the winner?\n\nSiteGround\n\nBoth web hosts offer fairly similar features when it comes to shared and dedicated packages. I will point out that SiteGround offers free SSL encryption to all users. SiteGround has consistently lower prices across all packages. SiteGround easily wins this round.\n\n5. Which One Has Better Customer Service and Support?\n\nAs with any sort of software or technology, chances are you’re going to run into some problems along the way.\n\nFinding a host with great user support is something that many people fail to prioritize. The reality is, having a web host who provides quick, effective customer service will save you headaches down the road.\n\nIn order to put SiteGround and GoDaddy to the test, we will look at the type of user support offered and response time.\n\nGoDaddy vs SiteGround\n\nGoDaddy has a dedicated user support area that includes a phone number, 24/7 live chat, user guides, and tutorials. I went ahead and tested the 24/7 live chat support on the website to measure the response time.\n\nThe initial response time was incredibly fast — only 15 seconds. This first response, which appeared to be automated, gave me a few options to choose from. I then selected the “hosting” option.\n\nFrom here the chat instructed me that wait times would be around 21 minutes to speak with a specialist. They explained that this wait was due to the usual number of user inquiries.\n\nI decided to wait it out and I was actually contacted by someone after 1 min and 23 seconds. Not bad!\n\nSiteGround offers 24/7 support by phone, chat, or email ticket. They also have helpful guides and tutorials for users.\n\nI moved on to SiteGround to try the same test. Using the live chat feature on the website, I requested to speak with someone about web hosting. This directed me to a waiting room feature.\n\nI waited for a minute and twenty-three seconds before I was contacted by a member of the support team.\n\nStrangely enough, it took exactly the same amount of time to contact a support specialist from both websites.\n\nWho’s the winner?\n\nIt’s a tie\n\nWell, we have another tie. Both SiteGround and GoDaddy connected me to a support specialist in under a minute and a half. I liked the fact that GoDaddy gave me an estimated wait time.\n\nEven better that they came in well under that estimated time. SiteGround was also very fast, and they got points for keeping the customer service team in-house, without outsourcing.\n\n6. Which Has Better Security?\n\nEven though I put security last on this list, it may be the most important factor of all. As you grow your website, you’ll realize just how important it is to keep your site safe from the dangers of the world wide web.\n\nYour web hosting service plays a vital role in this security. What are they doing to protect your site from hackers, and keep your personal information safe?\n\nLet’s take a look at what GoDaddy and SiteGround do in this area.\n\nGoDaddy vs SiteGround\n\nSecurity is where SiteGround really shines. They’ve created an absolute powerhouse of a security system with their AI-based bot prevention program. This program was developed in 2017 and has the ability to block 500,000 to 2 million brute force attempts every hour. And that’s across all servers. This program is built to detect:\n\nFailed login attempts in the majority of popular web applications – WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, etc.\n\nNumber of simultaneous connections to different URLs\n\nDifferent request types and known DDoS vulnerabilities in applications\n\nDynamic list of bad user agents that’s constantly being updated\n\nIf that doesn’t put your mind at ease, I’m not sure what will. On top of that, they offer a feature called Domain ID protect that ensures your personal information is not publicly available.\n\nSiteGround offers free Let’s Encrypt SSL to all of its users. All shared hosting servers are protected by ModSecurity, an open-source firewall software.\n\nGoDaddy uses a website security system powered by Securi. This system scans to detect any issues with the website on a daily basis.\n\nNow, I was unable to find a detailed description of how the security system works such as the one Siteground provided.\n\nFor the most part, it appears many of the security features must be purchased as add ons for the basic plans. GoDaddy offers SSL certificates for an additional $79.99 per year.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that GoDaddy has come under fire for several security breaches. The most recent of which happened in October of 2019. This security issue occurred when an unauthorized individual gained access to 28,000 GoDaddy user accounts.\n\nWho’s the winner?\n\nSiteGround\n\nWith advanced technology, transparent security policies, and a solid security record, SiteGround takes this win.\n\nSiteGround provides consistent, public updates on their security measures. Each account is provided with strong protection and encryption starting at the most basic package.\n\nGoDaddy, on the other hand, provides minimal security in its basic package and charges updated security as add on packages. In addition, they suffer from concerning security breaches. Siteground is the clear winner\n\nWhich One is the Overall Winner?\n\nLet’s do a quick review:\n\nReliability Winner: SiteGround\n\nEase-of-Use Winner: Tie\n\nSpeed Winner: SiteGround\n\nCost Winner: SiteGround\n\nSupport Winner: Tie\n\nSecurity Winner: SiteGround\n\nSiteGround has come in as the clear winner, taking four out of the six categories. GoDaddy tied in two areas: ease-of-use and customer support.\n\nThe comparison between GoDaddy and SiteGround is an interesting one; GoDaddy is massively popular with 72 million domains, while SiteGround has a smaller, dedicated customer base.\n\nWhile both web hosting services provide extensive hosting options, SiteGround offers lower pricing for a better feature set.\n\nWhen it comes to security, even the cheapest plan gets excellent protection using SiteGround. In other important tests like site speed and an uptime guarantee, SiteGround shows it’s a dedication to providing cutting edge web hosting services.\n\nThese two companies are vastly different in their approach. SiteGround shows us where their priorities lie–and that’s with excellent service."
