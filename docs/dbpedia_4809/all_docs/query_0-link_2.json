        "text": "Before now, SiteGround used to have similar features as Bluehost, but SiteGround’s hosting infrastructure has dramatically changed as a result of recent developments.\n\nSiteGround outperforms Bluehost in terms of performance (speed and uptime), technical resources, pricing transparency, more advanced backup options, and customer service quality. However, as a result of all of this creativity, SiteGround had to raise its prices by 100%.\n\nWhen it comes to prices, Bluehost is better than SiteGround because they not only give a 50% discount, but they also have a free domain name for every account.\n\nYou may be curious why someone might prefer WP Engine, a managed WordPress host, over SiteGround, although it costs too much more. WP Engine specializes in WordPress hosting, so all of their hardware and software is optimized for the platform. This has a lot of benefits, the most important of which is faster page loading, which search engines include when rating websites.\n\nSiteGround, on the other hand, has a host of features that WP Engine does not, such as email. For most business owners, SiteGround is the better choice. However, for others, the additional expense of WP Engine is well worth it.\n\nOften people have the terms uptime and reaction time mixed up. The difference is quite simple. Uptime refers to the period the server is active, while the server response time is the time it takes for the server to send out a web page. SiteGround promises an excellent uptime of 99.99% for their users.\n\nThe server response time is a crucial factor to consider when choosing between two or more hosting options. For SiteGround, their response time is incredible. For instance, the response time for some locations like the United States is as low as 1ms.\n\nIf you’re looking for the cheapest web hosting option, SiteGround’s shared plan is the way to go. Several websites are stored on a single server with joint hosting, reducing the total expense. However, since the different sites share the server’s processing resources, the site’s success can be affected if another bunk-mate experiences a massive traffic spike due to a Reddit hit.\n\nLike a few other web hosts, SiteGround allows you to select which data center you want to host your website. You can pick a European data center if you are worried about data protection or preservation rules. Also, you should use an Asia-Pacific data center if several of the customers are located in Asia.\n\nEach SiteGround server package has a comparatively high monthly price, but you can save money by taking advantage of promotional offers and signing up for a year at a time. Here’s how their current price list look:\n\nStartup Package\n\nThe StartUp package, which starts at $14.99 per month, comes with one domain, 10Gb of storage, daily data backups, network traffic ideal for 10,000 monthly visitors, support for CloudFlare, one-year free Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate, and unlimited email.\n\nThis plan suits people who run only one website, either a personal blog or a business blog.\n\nGrowBig Package\n\nThis package has a starting fee of $24.99 per month and builds upon the base plan. The package includes every feature in the StartUp package plus unlimited databases, site staging, 20GB of storage, unlimited websites, and network traffic to accommodate an estimated 25,000 visits per month.\n\nThe GrowBig plan is suitable for more advanced bloggers like you and me, who require more server resources. You’re allowed to host multiple websites and blogs and have access to SiteGround’s Supercacher technology too.\n\nGoGeek Package\n\nThe plan starts at $39.99 per month. The plan is designed for larger websites, and It’s an improvement on the GrowBig package. GoGeek package includes network traffic that can accommodate approximately 100,000 visits per month, 40GB of storage, white labor support, Git repository, and priority support.\n\nThe server resources in this plan are four times more than the previous two. It also offers a staging feature. Your website would also be hosted on a cloud with only a few numbers of other websites. If you need Git/staging and free backup and restore, I recommend this package. It is suitable for e-Commerce websites.\n\nNote: For users signing up for new annual plans, SiteGround offers discounts of $6.99 a month, $9.99 a month, and $14.99 a month on their StartUp, GrowBig, and GoGeek packages, respectively. Furthermore, SiteGround claims that it can accommodate more visits than the stated quotas, but only on a one-time basis every month (for example, when your blog receives a Reddit hit).\n\nWe applaud SiteGround for being transparent about its limitations; most web hosts, including those who advertise “unlimited” visitors and/or info, have traffic limitations hidden in their terms of service.\n\nLike many other web hosting companies, SiteGround provides WordPress hosting. SiteGround manages your setup with integrated controlled WordPress hosting, which provides improved protection, page caching, regularly automated backups, staging, and automatic content management system upgrades for your website.\n\nIt also includes a one-click setup and a free account transfer. SiteGround no longer provides a free domain name, although it does provide significant registration reductions.\n\nIn terms of costs, the services are comparable to the company’s shared hosting plans, but they’re focused on WordPress only. So if you’ll use WordPress for your website, you can use one of these plans. They’re the same price as the shared plans and still use the same names.\n\nThese services aren’t very business-oriented, at least in comparison to shared hosting plans. For the most part, they can both function well for most small companies. However, if you plan to sell goods online, GoGeek is the way to go since it is PCI compatible.\n\nSiteGround’s WordPress hosting plans include:\n\nStaging environment available on GoGeek and GrowBig plans\n\nBlazing speed with SuperCacher on the GrowBig and GoGeek plans\n\nImproved security for WordPress-specific privacy breaches\n\nFree restores and automatic backups\n\nAutomatically controlled WordPress updates\n\nDedicated WordPress support\n\nSiteGround is positioned explicitly as a hosting provider for beginners, particularly small business newcomers. SiteGround’s services, from their functionality to their support tools, are tailored to small companies, sole proprietors, and independent contractors who don’t have a lot of design time or specialized web skills.\n\nAlso, if you don’t plan to have a constant stream of visitors on your website or don’t need unlimited storage space or unlimited monthly data backup, SiteGround’s restrictions in those areas won’t bug you.\n\nHere are a few other reasons why SiteGround is ideal for small businesses:\n\nScalability\n\nMost web hosting services can provide unique plans for newbie business owners, but you’ll need to add more features to your website as the business grows. SiteGround allows you to expand without having to switch hosting providers.\n\nIt takes time to switch hosts, and there are almost always issues. As a result, it’s best to stay with your new host wherever possible. SiteGround makes it easy.\n\nSince SiteGround offers several different hosting services, switching hosts should never be needed. Start with their extremely cheap StartUp hosting plan and scale up to their Super Power Cloud Hosting plan or several other dedicated servers to build your own Cloud with OpenStack.\n\nThey also have Enterprise Hosting, in which they can custom-build a server to meet your specific requirements and then control it for you.\n\nE-Commerce Hosting\n\nMany companies begin by simply wanting an online version of a business card, but they quickly expand. Perhaps your company has already arrived at that stage. There isn’t much of a distinction between selling items in the physical shop and selling them online.\n\nSelling online requires just one additional step: delivery. What’s excellent about SiteGround is that you can do this with their most affordable plans, including PrestaShop, Magento, OpenCart, and more.\n\nYou may also do drop delivery, so you offer items that you don’t keep in stock. Your online shop would likely expand quicker than your physical store.\n\nIf you’re already running a WordPress website, you can use WooCommerce to convert your current website into an e-commerce store. If your e-commerce hosting requirements are demanding, we recommend that you choose SiteGround’s GoGeek package.\n\nIt provides hosting services and functionality that can handle online stores with a high volume of traffic.\n\nFor users who already own a WordPress website, SiteGround is an excellent choice since they can move the site for free to their servers. Keep in mind that switching web hosts is an easy, fast, and one-time process. Even a website owner who isn’t acquainted with the process can do it.\n\nSiteGround also has a note-worthy additional starter kit for new WordPress websites. The best part is that you don’t require any technical skills or expertise to set up the website with this starter kit. This is useful for many new websites, but it is particularly appealing to bloggers.\n\nThe WordPress-SiteGround partnership is transparent and smooth, giving both new and seasoned WordPress consumers and clients no reason to be concerned.\n\nThe SiteGround support service is outstanding. They offer live chat, 24/7 phone support, and ticket-based support. Unlike some other hosting companies, there are noticeable delays (usually less than a minute) when you use their live chat.\n\nTheir customer support staff are also very knowledgeable and don’t need to search for an answer each time you send a new question.\n\nSiteGround has developed its advanced ticketing system, which has an intelligent algorithm for selecting appropriate technical support reps for particular tasks.\n\nAre you wondering which language they support? SiteGround’s customer support is only available in English. They have both an English language YouTube channel and a Spanish Language YouTube channel. Customers on the GoGeek package and higher enjoy “Advanced Priority Support,” which ensures the service request would be prioritized over all others and forwarded to the most qualified support team members.\n\nIf you’re searching for a free SiteGround trial, they do have it, but it’s not worth your time. If you just want to give it a shot, SiteGround offers a 30-day money-back guarantee if you are unhappy with them for some reason. Follow these steps to terminate your account:\n\nSubmit a service termination request on their service area\n\nYou must submit the request within 30 days of service activation\n\nThe option is only valid for fresh orders, not renewals\n\nThe domain name and domain privacy may be due upon cancellation since they’re not included in the cancellation\n\nIf the cancellation happens within 30 days of subscription, you are eligible for a refund. With their 30-day money-back guarantee all on their shared plans, you can try out their services for the said period. If you’re not satisfied with the service and decide to cancel your account, you’re eligible for a refund. However, you won’t get a refund on domain name registrations as the fees are non-refundable.\n\nThere’s hardly a day that goes by without news about cyber-security violations or attacks. Corporations, companies, and even government departments have also become victims of cybercrime. Anyone who operates or maintains a website should be concerned with security.\n\nIn this respect, SiteGround excels since it provides a variety of protection solutions. They have a tool called the SG Site Scanner that can tell you if the website is under threat. They also use two reputable anti-spam apps – SpamAssassin and SpamExperts. These tools prevent bots and people from spamming your website.\n\nOther security features on the platform are hotlink protection and IP address blocklists. They check all the links on your website’s homepage to ensure that they are secure.\n\nAll SiteGround’s servers support HTTP/2 technology, which is, without a doubt, the safest and most dependable solution available. You’ll still have access to their excellent Web Application Firewall (WAF). It guards against a wide range of possible security violations."
