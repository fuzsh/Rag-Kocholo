It's one of the most daunting tasks that a website owner can face. This is why GreenGeeks offers a FREE Website Transfer service for all customers who have an existing website with another hosting provider and want to switch to us.\n\nFull details on the website transfer process\n\nStep #1: Set up Your New Hosting Account\n\nGreenGeeks offers some of the best web hosting in the World. For as little as $2.95 per month you will have a fully featured web hosting account. Signing up is easy. Head on over to our Order Form and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nOnce you've signed up for your web hosting account, you're going to receive a welcome e-mail containing all the information for your new service. Keep this handy as you'll need it in the future.\n\nNote: Signing up with our service does not automatically transfer your website. So do not worry about your site going offline or not being available. This step is required to get started.\n\nStep #2: Getting ready to Transfer your website\n\nNow that your web hosting account with GreenGeeks has been activated, you're going to want to take advantage of our FREE website transfer service by submitting a migration request from the Account Manager. Once inside the account manager, click on Support and then Migration Request Form. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the website transfer request.\n\nOur Site Migration team will then receive the website transfer request and will begin working on transferring your website. At this point, the site migration team will handle everything related to transferring of your website.\n\nDuring this process, you will be asked to change the DNS on your domain name to our name servers. This process takes 24-48 hours for it to take effect. Generally, from start to finish the migration can take anywhere from as little as 1 hour to as much as 48 hours, depending on the size of the account and who you're moving from. Our site migration team will hold your hand during the entire website transfer process to ensure that your website is transferred correctly without any issues and/or an extended period of downtime.\n\nStep #3: Test and Confirm\n\nOnce our team has notified that your website transfer is completed, they'll ask you to double check your website to ensure that things are working. Provided that you changed the DNS and waited the 24-48 hours for the domain to resolve everything should be working correctly.\n\nStep #4: Cancel Old Hosting Account\n\nOur suggestion is to keep the old hosting account active for at least a week. This way if there were any issues during the website transfer process, we would be able to correct it easily. Once you're confident that your website is working correctly, you can proceed to cancel your web hosting account. Be mindful that you are not cancelling your domain registration service.\n\nStep #5: Transferring Your Domain Name (Optional)\n\nWe offer a free domain transfer, so why not right? Once your website is transferred, we can transfer your domain name from your existing registrar to us. To get started with this process, follow our Domain Transfer Instructions knowledgebase article."
