        "text": "What is the Best Cheap Web Hosting?\n\nOur best cheap web hosting comparisons include plans from $0.80 to $3.95 per month. These affordable plans provide high discounts and different term lengths. For example, you may get the $1.99 pricing but must sign up for three years – if you only want to pay for 12 months, the price goes up.\n\nAlso, renewal prices are usually higher than the discounted rate, so watch out for that.\n\nThe rankings on this page are strictly based on price. If you want to read more in-depth coverage, check out my full guide to the best cheap web hosting options to use this year.\n\nHere are my top picks for cheap web hosting:\n\nHostinger.\n\niPage.\n\nDreamhost.\n\nHostGator.\n\nBluehost.\n\n1. Hostinger Single Shared Hosting.\n\n$0.80/Month for 4 Years.\n\nHostinger comes in at #1 on this list as the cheapest web host because of its 90% discount and $0.80/month hosting for 48 months.\n\nMost of the time, cheap options offer lower site performance – that’s not the case here. They’re one of the fastest hosts, with page load times clocking in under 380 ms. With their $0.80 plan, you get one website, one email address, 1 MySQL database, 10GB of disk space, and tech support.\n\nTotal cost: $38.40 for 48 months\n\n2. The iPage Go Plan.\n\n$1.99/Month for 36 Months.\n\niPage has been running its cheap $1.99 introductory plans for years now. They do have higher renewal fees at $7.99 to $9.99/month, so keep that in mind if you sign up.\n\niPage doesn’t match the speed of other options, with page load times more than double those of Hostinger. Overall, they have a good feature set for a cheap host, with unlimited disk space, unlimited MySQL databases, and unmetered bandwidth.\n\nTotal cost: $71.64 for 36 months\n\n3. Dreamhost Shared Starter.\n\n$2.59/Month for 36 Months.\n\nDreamhost stands out from the other cheap choices because their renewal fees are the same as your intro offer. They also just upgraded this plan to include a free domain name, which used to cost $9.95/year.\n\nYou also get unlimited traffic and bandwidth, SSD storage, and WordPress pre-installed. Their site speed is also better than average, coming in under 750 ms.\n\nTotal cost: $93.24 for 36 months\n\n4. HostGator Cloud Hatchling Plan.\n\n$2.78/Month for 36 Months.\n\nThis plan has excellent performance for a cheaper host, with 99.98% operational time and load times under 450 ms. By purchasing their Hatchling Plan, you get one website, unmetered bandwidth and disk space, technical support, and a $100 Google/Bing Ads credit.\n\nThis plan renews at $6.95/month, which is a vast improvement over their previous renewal rates of $10.95 – $19.95/month.\n\nTo get these discounts, make sure to use promo code ADAMENFROY at checkout.\n\nTotal cost: $100.08 for 36 months\n\n5. Bluehost Basic Shared Hosting.\n\n$3.95/Month for 36 Months.\n\nThis plan is a good, all-around cheap web hosting option, with a good mix of features, security, and support.\n\nWith their Basic Plan, you get one domain, five parked domains, 25 subdomains, 50 GB SSD storage, and standard performance features. They also have some of the best speed at under 420 ms. This plan is currently 50% off and renews at its regular rate of $7.99/month.\n\nTotal cost: $142.20 for 36 months\n\nDisclaimer: This article contains affiliate links that I receive a small commission for at no cost to you.

You can read my full affiliate disclosure in my privacy policy.\n\nWhat is the Best Free Web Hosting?\n\nWhile some companies provide free hosting, I don’t recommend it as you lose out on performance. If you sign up for free website hosting and realize it’s a bad experience, you either need expensive add-ons or must migrate to a legitimate paid option.\n\nIt’s not worth the extra work.\n\nWhile these alternatives may not be the best fit when building your website, if you’re a developer, you can learn a lot by diving into these free tools.\n\nUltimately, I recommend avoiding these free providers and going with a high-quality option like Hostinger with their 90% discount.\n\nHere is an overview of the best free web hosting with the most popular platforms compared and reviewed.\n\n000webhost.\n\nInfinityFree.\n\nx10Hosting.com.\n\nAwardSpace.\n\nFreehostia.\n\nFreeHosting.com.\n\nGoogle Cloud Web Hosting.\n\n1. 000webhost.\n\n000webhost is a version of Hostinger free of charge, and they’ve been around since 2007. They don’t force any ads on their users like some other services, and they also offer paid plans. They provide up to two websites, 1,000 MB of storage, an impressive 10GB of bandwidth, and a free control panel.\n\nIn their dashboard, you can control things like redirects, phpMyAdmin, a web-based file manager, a free website builder, and password-protected directories.\n\nOne major downside of 000webhost is that there is a required one hour of downtime per day, so your site is up around 95.8% per day- if everything else runs perfectly.\n\n2. InfinityFree.\n\nInfinityFree is one of the most popular free tools out there and has a ton of excellent features. They have been around for over six years, boast over 200,000 users, a script installer, and an impressive 50,000 daily hits.\n\nYou can have as many domains as you want and gain access to 10 email accounts. Surprisingly, they include a free DNS service, SSL, and Cloudflare CDN too. However, the “unlimited bandwidth” that they promise comes with some rules and regulations that can affect the types of files you’re allowed to upload.\n\nIf these features aren’t strong enough for you, they have a cheap plan for $5.90/month, which reduces the page load time, a small complaint from InfinityFree users.\n\n3. x10Hosting.com.\n\nx10Hosting has been in the free hosting world for over ten years. They offer “unlimited” disk space and bandwidth. However, they also have a High Resource Usage Policy, which allows them to throttle or suspend sites that are taking up too many resources.\n\nHowever, they have excellent average server response times under 350 ms and strong speed metrics.\n\n4. AwardSpace.\n\nAwardSpace.com offers both free and premium web hosting to over 2.5 million users. With their open plan, you get 100% ad-free hosting, one-click CMS, and 24/7 tech support. However, the free plans only give you 1 GB of disk space and 5GB of bandwidth, forcing users to sign up for one of their premium plans.\n\nIn the end, the biggest drawback of AwardSpace is their inadequate load times of over 1.5 seconds.\n\n5. Freehostia.\n\nFreehostia offers users free plans that include 250MB of disk space, 6GB of monthly bandwidth, app installers, three email accounts, and MySQL and PHP compatibility. They also provide 24/7 support for their users and guarantee a 99.9% uptime – not bad for a free service.\n\nFreehostia features a load-balanced cluster platform, which provides stronger server speeds than many one-server hosting solutions. If you are looking for a more robust solution, they have virtual private servers from $14/month, semi-dedicated servers from $29.95/month and dedicated servers from $65/month.\n\nTheir free hosting plans have some pretty restrictive limitations. A paltry 250mb of storage space is not enough for most developers to add the images and text they need.\n\n6. FreeHosting.com.\n\nFreeHosting.com is one of the best free hosts out there because of their unmetered bandwidth. They give users 10GB of server space, one free email account, one MySQL database, and one domain (that you must already own). They offer free subdomains too.\n\nThey also have a simple drag and drop site builder with over 170 pre-designed templates. A powerful app installer also allows you to add-on over 350 applications.\n\nIf their free plans don’t cover everything you need, you can opt for their paid plan at $7.99/month. With the paid hosting option, you can add a multi-site, have multiple emails, and unlimited disk space.\n\nOne big downside to FreeHosting is their site speed – coming in at around two seconds on average. With site speed being a ranking factor on Google, I would look elsewhere for a free host.\n\n7. Google Cloud Web Hosting.\n\nGoogle offers free hosting for small businesses with a pay per use model, so you only start paying once your site is active. Their Google Cloud Platform is a private network that is available in over 200 countries.\n\nWith the cloud computing market set to hit $258 billion in 2019, Google is heavily investing in the future of its cloud hosting, spending $30 billion to date.\n\nOne user said, “I tried out the WordPress and Google combo, and the results were amazing. Our test site could handle over 70,000 requests per second without the users noticing a thing.”\n\nThis performance is impressive and one worth looking into, although they’re not technically free and are a pay-per-use model.\n\nShould I Avoid Free Website Hosting?\n\nI believe you shouldn’t use free options and go with a reputable paid host like Hostinger, especially when their services are only $0.80 per month.\n\nPlus, free web hosts typically start as free, severely restrict your settings, and then push you to upgrade to a paid plan. I would avoid the headache altogether and choose a cheap web host or premium one depending on your needs.\n\nWhile 000webhost is the best host on this list, you don’t want to skimp on your hosting by choosing a free or cheap plan. If you’re serious about your website, hosting is one of the essential choices you’ll make. It affects everything like site speed, uptime, security, and features. Don’t go cheap – make a small investment and secure your website’s future success.\n\nWhat is the Best Web Hosting for Small Business?\n\nWhen you run your own company, there are a few top priorities to consider when choosing the best hosting for your small business website. If you pick a less-than-reputable provider, your site might go down, get hacked, or you run into server issues. You don’t want to feel a real effect on your bottom line. And now that 90% of communication with customers is visual, your website and hosting need to be top-notch.\n\nThat’s why choosing the best option for your small business is crucial and should focus on three key areas: security, reliability, and price.\n\nHere are my picks for the best web hosting for small businesses.\n\n1. Bluehost Plus Plan.\n\nThis is the best overall plan for small businesses because it’s a perfect all-encompassing package that works best with WordPress and is secure, reliable, and reasonably priced.\n\nIf you’re starting, you can opt for their basic package.\n\nAs your company scales, you can choose their Plus plan. This package gives you unlimited domains, SPAM support, and an SSL certificate all for $11/month.\n\nIf you run a larger enterprise and need their top of the line offerings, you can choose their Cloud and VPS plans. With these plans, you can have more storage, unlimited bandwidth, and faster load times.\n\n2. HostGator Baby Plan.\n\nWith uptime guarantees of 99.9% and over 8 million domains, this plan is the runner-up for the best choice for small businesses. They are super reliable, have an easy control panel, and offer a money-back guarantee if they don’t meet their uptime benchmarks.\n\nTheir three paid plans (Hatchling, Baby, and Business) scale up as your needs grow. The Hatchling plan is $2.75/month and has pretty basic features — next, their Baby plan $3.95/month.\n\nIf you’re looking for the best hosting option, I recommend their highest-tier plan. This Business plan is $9.95/month and gives you free SSL certificates, a dedicated IP address, and free SEO tools.\n\n3. iPage for Business.\n\niPage is my #3 choice because of its website builder, Weebly access, and free ad credits for Google and Bing PPC ads.\n\nGrowing companies, including those in e-commerce, should avoid iPage. However, it’s a great option if you’re a local shop that wants to get up quickly.\n\nBetween the free domain and website, email address, and ad credits, you can’t go wrong at this price point. However, I have heard complaints about a lack of promptness from their customer service team. Although they have cheap plans, I recommend other options.\n\nWhat is Web Hosting?\n\nWeb hosting is a service that allows websites to serve resources on the internet with the ability to be accessible anywhere on the World Wide Web. These companies buy or lease servers in data centers connected to the Internet, and sell space on these servers. A web server in a data center can contain one or more websites.\n\nThe operating system settings are different if you have shared hosting, dedicated hosting, or VPS hosting.\n\nSource: cebuonlinesolutions.com\n\nWebsites are just a bunch of files – HTML files, CSS files, images, and photos, etc. All data live in a folder on a computer connected to the Internet. That computer is a “server” because it serves up files when people come to visit.\n\nWhen Internet users want to view a website, all they do is type in the web address into their browser. Their computer then connects to the server and webpages (files) are delivered through the browser.\n\nTo build a website, you need both a domain and a hosting account. If you don’t have a domain, you can purchase one as an add-on.\n\nYou can use separate domain registrars and web hosting companies. However, you’d have to point your domain to your web host by editing the DNS records. If you purchase the domain name and website hosting from the same company, you will not have to change your domain settings.\n\nBut for example, if you already have a website with GoDaddy and want to host with another provider, you’ll have to change your DNS records.\n\nHere are some other things to keep in mind when choosing a provider:\n\nKnow your hosting needs\n\nLook into server reliability and uptime guarantees\n\nInvestigate hosting upgrade options if scalability is important\n\nLook into signup prices vs. renewal prices, as they may be very different\n\nResearch the control panel for ease of use\n\nMake sure the hosting platform has essential features: a one-click installer, FTP and STFP Access, .htaccess files, disk space, and data transfer capacity\n\nResearch sites speed, page loads times, and if they integrate with a Content Delivery Network (CDN)\n\nWhat Are the Different Types of Web Hosting?\n\n1. Cloud Hosting.\n\nCloud hosting is a new type of hosting that uses a network of virtual servers that store your files in the cloud rather than on one server. This type of hosting is great for security and to mitigate DDoS attacks, as multiple servers and entry points are much harder to hack than a single server.\n\nSource: skysilk.com\n\nCloud hosting plans are pay-as-you-go – since they’re virtual when they’re not in use they aren’t taking up resources. Another benefit to this pay-as-you-go model is that you can easily upgrade your services over a specific time if you expect a boost in traffic.\n\nOne advantage of cloud hosting is that you can add more virtual server resources to your website as your traffic grows. This flexibility allows you to increase bandwidth as your online business scales incrementally.\n\nFor example, if you use shared hosting and your server goes down, your website is entirely out of luck. However, with cloud hosting across multiple servers, your site won’t go down if one server fails.\n\nCloud hosting can cost between $40 and $100 per month or higher.\n\n2. Shared Web Hosting.\n\nShared web hosting is when multiple websites live on one server. This form of hosting is one of the most popular and cheap options out there, as many sites can share server resources owned by the web host.\n\nOne downside to shared hosting is sharing resources. A website on the same server as you getting a ton of traffic and overloading the server can slow your site down. A server can’t have unlimited websites – there are safeguards in place against this, but still, it’s one of the slower options because of shared resources.\n\nThis type of hosting is great for new websites that don’t have a ton of content.\n\nSince this hosting is on a server with other websites, and you share limited resources, performance may suffer. However, you shouldn’t notice much of an improvement decline as a new site.\n\nShared hosting can cost anywhere from $2 to 30 per month.\n\n3. VPS Hosting.\n\nVPS hosting refers to virtual private servers.\n\nWhen leveraging VPS hosting, one server acts like a series of separate servers. With VPS, you get a dedicated segment of shared server resources, so your hosting isn’t impacted by other sites on your server. So you get your piece of server space, and there are fewer other websites sharing resources.\n\nSource: computehost.com\n\nVPS hosting is a little bit pricier than shared, but you get more resources and the option to scale your website as your traffic grows. In other words, you won’t be held back by slow speed if you’re generating more traffic and your online business is growing.\n\nThis hosting typically costs between $20 to 150 per month.\n\n4. WordPress Hosting.\n\nWordPress offers its hosting, and you can set up your website and domain on WordPress.com. However, this is a stripped-down version of WordPress, without the ability to add specific plugins, themes, or more in-depth settings that you need to create a great website.\n\nWordPress sites are typically faster than shared hosting because of their native integrations and expert support teams.\n\nSource: bitcatcha.com\n\nWordPress is also teaming up with other platforms like BigCommerce to bring deeper e-commerce functionality to its offerings. 39% of e-commerce merchants reported they recently lost money due to performance or stability problems. Combining the front end functionality of WordPress with the backend power of an e-commerce platform is an excellent option for scaling growth.\n\nWordPress hosting can cost anywhere from $5 to 100 per month.\n\n5. Dedicated Server Hosting.\n\nDedicated server hosting is the process of leasing an entire server and managing all of your web hosting yourself. If you have a significant website for a large organization, this higher cost option gives you the most control over your hosting.\n\nSource: milesweb.com\n\nWith complete control over your server, you can install highly complex programs, scripts, and applications that aren’t possible with shared hosting. One drawback is that if you don’t have the technical knowledge to manage and run your server, you may run into issues. You’ll either have to suffer website downtime or hire an expert to fix your problems for you.\n\nDedicated server hosting costs $120 per month or above.\n\n6. Reseller Web Hosting.\n\nReseller programs allow developers or digital agencies to resell white-labeled hosting on the plans that they own. For example, if you have ten clients, you can buy a high-tier hosting package, and then resell hosting to your customers at a monthly fixed cost.\n\nCompanies like Siteground and WP Engine offer reseller plans, which typically include a management panel, billing software, and automated reports.\n\nThe price for reseller hosting is around $20-75 depending on features and bandwidth.\n\n7. Colocation Web Hosting.\n\nWhen you colocate, you rent space from data centers. You need to provide your server hardware, and they provide security, cooling, power, and an Internet connection. In addition to paying for rack space, you also pay for your bandwidth usage each month.\n\nBecause of the technical knowledge needed, the possibility of website downtime if something goes wrong, and high costs, colocation web hosting is not recommended for beginners or small businesses.\n\n8. Ecommerce Hosting.\n\nIf you’re managing an online store, you can choose any number of e-commerce platforms like BigCommerce and Shopify.\n\nThese separate self-hosted platforms will host your entire site for you. Additionally, if you’re using WordPress, you could pay for an official hosting site like Hostinger and then add an e-commerce plugin like WooCommerce or BigCommerce for WordPress.\n\nEcommerce hosting is an option offered by hosts like WP Engine that gives your site the ability to sell online.\n\nHere’s what to look for when choosing an e-commerce host:\n\nShopping cart software\n\nPCI compliant servers\n\nSSL and security to handle transactions\n\nCustomer databases\n\nLow downtime, as you never want to lose out on revenue\n\nFast server response times\n\nCan You Start Hosting on AWS?\n\nAmazon is known for being one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, but were you aware that it offers one of the best web services in the world today? Well, Amazon Web Services is a secure cloud services platform that provides computing power and other functionalities to help businesses scale up. Out of all these services, we will be more interested in their hosting services and whether you can start hosting WordPress on AWS.\n\nYou can host your site on AWS as it is known for its top-notch reliability and uptime. Almost all of its data center locations have close to 100% uptime, and websites hosted there never go down. It is fast becoming a popular cloud hosting option for businesses owing to how giants such as Facebook host most of their business infrastructure on their cloud.\n\nIt is worth noting that setting up your site on AWS is not easy. You will have to learn complex codes to set up and manage the site. However, they also have a managed option which reduces the technical work you need to do. The security services provided by AWS are awe-inspiring, and your site will always be safe from attacks.\n\nAWS charges for their hosting service on a pay as you go basis. You will be billed based on your traffic and spikes will increase your bill.\n\nWhat is the Fastest Website Hosting?\n\nSpeed is an essential factor when picking your preferred hosting plan. You might find an averagely fast hosting service that handles your regular traffic well, but what happens if you hit a favorite day and your traffic spikes? Not all plans can handle that well. This way, it helps to look at some factors when picking the fastest hosting.\n\nYour audience is a vital determinant as they have a direct impact on the speed. Traffic spikes can make your site go down if the server capacity cannot handle the numbers. This way, always pick a hosting plan that can handle your traffic even at peak traffic levels.\n\nThe server location is another thing that affects speed. Often overlooked, a CDN makes sure that the server you select is close to the audience’s general location. Going for a cheaper option that is on the other side of the globe will affect your site’s speed.\n\nHere are my picks for the fastest hosting services, but always conduct an in-depth analysis before picking one that will be fast for your site and audience:\n\nSiteGround\n\nHostinger\n\nA2 Turbo\n\nInMotion Hosting\n\nKinsta\n\nLiquid Web\n\nBest Web Hosting [Infographic]\n\nFeel free to download and share this infographic if you’d like.
