        "text": "Two things are certain in this world: death and taxes. In the online world, it’s speed and uptime. If you don’t have both, your site will surely suffer. That’s why choosing the right web hosting service for your website is one of the most important decisions you’ll make for your business.\n\nDon’t make the mistake of saving a few bucks on a killer web hosting deal only to have your site come to a screeching halt. As a small business, we learned our lesson years ago, and since that time we’ve conducted over 10 years of intense research into the latest hits and misses of website hosting. Our best picks for a variety of web hosting types and services will give your site first-rate performance and a ton of must-have features.\n\n3 Must-Haves In A Web Host\n\nFrom our experience, a bigger name isn’t always better. At a minimum, a good website host can:\n\nLoad your websites quickly and reliably from any point on the globe.\n\nOffer a fixed resource allocation that will prevent your website from going down due to someone else’s mistakes.\n\nProvide you with informed and easy-to-reach customer service that resolves issues immediately after the occurrence, without the need for your prompting.\n\nHowever, some of the big names (and cheap services) overpromise on these three key factors and don’t deliver. So, it’s crucial to see what customers are saying about each service. That’s where we come in to help you. With every hosting service we review (and we’ve reviewed hundreds), we take customer feedback into major consideration. Not surprising, many amazing deals don’t end up being your best bet.\n\nShared vs Dedicated vs VPS vs Cloud Hosting (And More)\n\nNot only do you have to decide on a reliable provider, but you also have to consider what type of hosting is best for your site. Your options include shared, VPS, cloud, and dedicated hosting. What’s the difference? The major factor is the allocation of resources, which can significantly impact performance. Here’s a brief breakdown, but visit our hosting types comparison article for more details.\n\nShared hosting: The most budget-friendly option for low-traffic websites that don’t require a lot of resources. The server that houses your site is “shared” among many clients, so shared hosting can negatively impact speed and performance, particularly for larger sites.\n\nVPS Hosting: A good option for websites that have outgrown shared hosting. With VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting, you’re still sharing a server with others, but you get an allotted chunk or fixed subset of resources on that server.\n\nCloud Hosting: Ideal for rapidly growing websites that need scalability. Your site is hosted on a virtual partition of a server and draws its resources from a pooled network of virtual and physical servers.\n\nDedicated Hosting: Typically the most expensive option for large websites where you get your own dedicated server. It’s best suited for high-traffic sites and sites needing the highest level of security.\n\nWordPress hosting: WordPress hosting refers to hosting services specifically designed for the WordPress content management system (CMS). These services typically include features that are optimized for running WordPress. See my reviews of the best WordPress hosting providers to learn more.\n\nManaged hosting: The provider manages the more technical aspects of your site. This typically includes server configuration, security, monitoring, backups, software updates, and technical support. It’s ideal for non-technical users or those who simply don’t have the time to perform these tasks. Of course, managed hosting costs more.\n\nBest Web Hosting For Small Businesses\n\nThe hosting industry has more providers than you could imagine, so we can’t cover them all. There are many great hosting providers out there, but for each legitimate, trustworthy service, there are several bad ones.\n\nWe’ve curated this review to cover some of the companies we feel are the best in their respective categories, our honorable mentions, and some companies that we don’t feel merit a top ranking but still could be worth considering. If you don’t understand any of the terms in our reviews, see the terminology section on our main hosting page.\n\nBest Shared Hosting: Hostinger Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nShared hosting has its drawbacks no matter what service you consider, but we’ve chosen Hostinger as our best shared provider for their affordable pricing, feature-rich service, and amazing customer feedback. Despite its huge industry presence and budget-friendly prices, Hostinger is more reliable than similar cheap, big-name hosting companies.\n\nIt’s a top choice by many small businesses for their ease of use, uptime, performance, and tech support. They’re also one of the few hosting services officially recommended by wordpress.org (others include DreamHost and BlueHost).\n\nTheir entry-level plan is missing some features, but for only a dollar more per month you can upgrade to get a feature-rich service with enhanced security and performance. While Hostinger doesn’t utilize cPanel, its custom hPanel platform is extremely intuitive and quite similar to cPanel.\n\nHostinger offers many scalable higher-tier plans if your site outgrows shared hosting, including VPS and cloud hosting. However, Hostinger doesn’t offer dedicated hosting. They also have data servers in four continents, including North America, Europe, Asia, and South America.\n\nBest Dedicated Server Hosting: Hostwinds Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nHostwinds launched in 2010 and has become a major player in shared, VPS, and dedicated hosting. This hosting service is packed with features, although they don’t do a great job of publicizing them on their website (you have to do a lot of digging).\n\nGetting up and running with Hostwinds is a breeze, and they offer free site transfers. With their Softaculous Auto Installer, you can instantly set up and install hundreds of applications with just the click of a button. Customers give excellent reviews for Hostwinds’ uptime and quick, knowledgeable tech support.\n\nBest VPS Hosting: A2 Hosting Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nA2 Hosting has been around since 2003 but really stepped up their game to be a hosting leader in the last decade. Customers rave about their unique hosting features, server uptime, security measures, and helpful support. A2 Hosting has four data centers, with two in the U.S., one in Europe, and one in Asia. They clearly have made a commitment to speed, uptime, and security and offer free features you won’t find elsewhere.\n\nA2 Hosting is a fantastic choice for shared, dedicated, WordPress, and WooCommerce hosting. But I think they stand apart from the crowd for their managed and unmanaged VPS services. Pricing is very competitive, ranging from $2.99 to $54.99 per month.\n\nBest Cloud Hosting: Cloudways Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nSince Cloudways launched in 2011, this company has shaken up the way consumers can optimize managed cloud hosting for their WordPress, Magento, Laravel, or PHP sites. Through Cloudways, you choose from three top cloud hosting providers (Amazon Web Service, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean), and then Cloudways manages your hosting through an easy-to-use platform.\n\nCloudways is packed with a ton of features for high-end functionality, and it’s also highly scalable. You get CloudwaysCDN, 1-click server cloning, on-demand or scheduled backups, dedicated firewalls, multiple databases and PHP versions, and much more. Their pricing is surprisingly affordable, and their live chat tech support gets positive reviews.\n\nOur Personal Experience With Cloudways\n\nAlex to add (Alex – your bio on WRYW is going to CJ)\n\n– Alex Schenker, CEO/Co-Founder of We Rock Your Web\n\nBest For Beginners: SiteGround Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nSiteGround is one of the big names in the industry and hosts over 2.8 million domains worldwide. With an extremely easy setup, a user-friendly interface, and among the best tech support in the industry, SiteGround is a fantastic choice for beginners. They specialize in shared hosting but also offer managed scalable cloud hosting for growing sites. SiteGround They’re best known for their reliably fast speed, proven uptime, and excellent customer support.\n\nIf your site is moderate in size, SiteGround is one of the best choices out there, especially for managed WordPress hosting. However, if you need more, SiteGround lacks some of the more advanced features other services offer — most notably no unlimited disk space, no script library, and no Windows hosting. I’ve also found some complaints about the cost rising significantly after your introductory price.\n\nBest For WordPress Hosting: DreamHost Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nDreamHost has been in the business since 1997 and has really stepped up its game in web hosting over the last decade. While they’re a good choice for many different content platforms, they specialize — and excel — at WordPress hosting. In fact, they’re one of the few services officially recommended by wordpress.org (others include Hostinger and BlueHost). DreamHost offers shared, managed, VPS, and dedicated WordPress hosting solutions and a fantastic WP site builder included in all plans.\n\nNew web hosters recommend DreamHost for their affordable, simple service. One-click installers and expert tech support are selling points for site owners. However, with no CPanel access and limited script running capabilities, this is not a good choice for a web host-heavy user. Another potential downside is that they don’t offer phone support.\n\nBest Managed WordPress Hosting: Kinsta Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nKinsta has been specializing in WordPress hosting for over 10 years. Although they’re a smaller player in the managed WP hosting space, this doesn’t mean that they skimp on features. Kinsta offers highly optimized servers powered by the Google Cloud Platform. The company also does uptime checks every two minutes on all of its servers.\n\nAll plans give you free site migrations, a free CDN and SSL, site backups and cloning, caching, and much more. Kinsta is also developer-friendly with WP-CLI, SSH, and Git support. However, they have their own admin panel, so devotees of cPanel or Plesk may want to look elsewhere.\n\nOur Personal Experience With Kinsta\n\nAlex to add (Alex – your bio on WRYW is going to CJ)\n\n– Alex Schenker, CEO/Co-Founder of We Rock Your Web\n\nComparison Table\n\nWe also have a comparison table that compares pricing and other details side by side for our top winners and honorable mentions. All of the features apply to their shared hosting plans.\n\nAll of the services (except Cloudways) in our table include 1-click app installs, raw access logs, unlimited MySQL databases, automatic backups, malware detection, firewalls, DDoS protection, spam filters, .htaccess, SSH, and e-commerce capabilities.\n\n3 Honorable Mentions: Bluehost, InterServer & Rochen\n\nAlthough these three web hosting providers didn’t quite make the cut into our top winners, each is certainly worth considering for their superior services.\n\nBluehost Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nBluehost has been a big name in the industry for quite a while and come highly recommended by wordpress.org. It offers a variety of shared, dedicated, VPS, cloud, WordPress, and managed WP hosting plans. It’s a good choice for those looking for plenty of back-end features. However, you may find the customer support to be slow and not helpful — an ongoing problem with Bluehost.\n\nBluehost does not push clients by up-selling to “better” services, and they offer a good number of features for a decent price compared to many of their competitors. However, I’ve seen some recent feedback from long-time customers that the pricing has increased along with more complaints about downtime and site performance.\n\nInterServer Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nInterServer is a U.S.-based hosting company that’s still small and not well-known, but InterServer has many positive user reviews online and a robust set of features. They offer excellent free security features, 460+ scripts for 1-click installs, and a helpful and friendly support staff. If you’re a small business, nonprofit, or blogger, we recommend you consider InterServer.\n\nRochen Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nOne of Rochen’s biggest advantages over many other shared services is that it tightly controls the resources allocated to each website hosting account. It does this by not overselling, a common practice in the hosting industry where more bandwidth is allocated to each account than is, in fact, available on the server. However, Rochen doesn’t come cheap and may be cost-prohibitive for some small businesses.\n\nRochen has servers in both Dallas, Texas, and London, England, and you have the option of choosing your server location. It also offers dedicated servers and managed WordPress and Joomla hosting. Its dedicated hosting is a managed infrastructure that keeps your site running fast with minimal downtime. They back that up with exceptional customer service and optimized platforms based on your type of system.\n\nWhat About DigitalOcean, GoDaddy, HostGator & More?\n\nWith so many hosting services available, we also wanted to include reviews of some of the big names and other noteworthy options. You may just find a perfect match for your business’s needs.\n\nDigitalOcean | GoDaddy | HostGator | HostMonster | HostPapa | InMotion | IONOS | MDDHosting | Microsoft Azure | Network Solutions | Rackspace\n\nDigitalOcean Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nDigitalOcean offers a variety of cloud hosting solutions that support any kind of CMS. They make getting your site up and running a breeze with one-click apps for WordPress, Ghost, etc., and fantastic developer tools and databases. Pricing is affordable, and many users report excellent tech support. The main drawback with DigitalOcean is that it doesn’t have all the features that some services offer and its scalability is limited.\n\nGoDaddy Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nGoDaddy is one of the most recognized names when it comes to web hosting. However, while they make hosting easy for newcomers, they have been known to cause problems for some users. The most common complaint by users of GoDaddy’s web hosting service is that they lack flexibility and offer only basic functionality. Their pricing is also higher than many competitors. GoDaddy may be a good fit if you are new to web hosting, as it is a good introductory hosting company.\n\nHostGator Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nHostGator is a web hosting service that offers several one-click options as well as cPanel access, which makes web hosting an easy experience for newcomers. HostGator frequently comes recommended as one of the best web hosting options out there for individuals and companies alike, both in price and features offered. They offer shared, VPS, dedicated, WordPress, e-commerce, and reseller hosting.\n\nUnfortunately, I’ve seen a lot of customer feedback over the last six months that customer service and performance have gone way downhill. I’ve also seen numerous complaints that they significantly up your prices with little notice.\n\nHostMonster Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nHostMonster is owned by the hosting company BlueHost and in the past offered fewer features. But HostMonster does get credit for bumping up their features in the last few years. It offers shared, VPS, and dedicated hosting. Still, HostMonster is a relatively basic service and isn’t very user-friendly. If you are seeking more advanced features such as unlimited MySQL databases, then this is not the hosting solution for you.\n\nHostPapa Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nHostPapa is a Canada-based independent company that’s been around since 2006. They offer shared, VPS, and managed WordPress hosting, domains, website builders, office email solutions, and other services, so hosting is not their specialty. HostPapa’s pricing is middle of the road, but you get some good features and perks, like free domain registration, SSL, and Cloudflare CDN. You’ll have to upgrade for access to unlimited SSD storage, automated backups, MySQL databases, and other advanced features.\n\nInMotionHosting Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nInMotionHosting is a popular, big-name choice these days in the web hosting market. They offer comprehensive hosting solutions and an impressive array of features with competitive pricing. The issue that gives us major pause is some significant downtime reported and overcrowded servers for several years now. Also, long-time users say that tech support has become unhelpful.\n\nIONOS Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nIONOS offers affordable service with a moderate learning curve for those looking for a high-security web hosting solution. It offers shared, VPS, cloud, and dedicated hosting, with multiple plans for each that can suit small to large businesses. They also have some niche plans, including asp.net hosting, and a variety of ecommerce solutions.\n\nMDDHosting Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nMDDHosting is a lesser-known web hosting company that only offers managed shared cloud and VPS hosting, but they get stellar reviews for their speed, uptime, reliability, and customer service. They offer several pricing options, but they lack several features other services provide, including a script library, customized error pages, and 1-click app installs. If you’re a smaller-sized business, it’s definitely worth considering MDDHosting.\n\nMicrosoft Azure Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nIf you want a big-name web hosting solution, then Microsoft Azure is just what you are looking for. You can scale this platform to suit the smallest or the largest website. Unfortunately, navigating information on available hosting packages is so confusing that most potential customers have to call for customer service assistance to ensure that they get what they need from Microsoft Azure.\n\nNetwork Solutions Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nNetwork Solutions has been in business since 1979 and used to be one of the big names in the web hosting space. However, their popularity has really fallen over the years, likely because they’re one of the most expensive providers. They also only offer a moderate amount of functionality (although they have added a few extra features like unlimited MySQL databases, 1-click installers, and .htaccess configurability).\n\nRackspace Review\n\nVisit Website\n\nRackspace used to be a big player in both the shared and dedicated hosting space. Historically they were known for their exceptional customer service, (via their Rackers and their Fanatical support service), available via phone, ticket, or chat, 24/7/365. Unfortunately, having been previous customers of theirs, we’ve watched the quality of support and hosting reliability decline in recent years. And their customer support gets a lot of negative feedback from current and past users.\n\nRackspace managed hosting solutions are diverse, from cloud to dedicated. They also offer cloud file backup and dedicated email hosting (via Rackspace Email), all for reasonable prices (you can get mailboxes for as little as $1/ month).\n\nWhich Web Hosting Solution Is Right For You?\n\nIt’s important to find a service that offers functions that you need now as well as those you may need in the future. One of the most difficult parts of hosting a website is moving that website to another host if you don’t make the right choice the first time. This can occur for a number of reasons including growth, language/code changes, the addition of e-commerce or videos, etc.\n\nThere are some major factors you need to consider when choosing a web host. Check out the video below for some great tips.\n\nBest Domain Registrars\n\nAnother huge decision you need to make for your website is choosing a domain name registrar. Although several hosting companies also offer domain name registration services, we don’t recommend hosting with your domain registrar.\n\nWhy? Hosting and domain registration are extremely different entities, and most companies simply aren’t great at both. With that in mind, be sure to check out our reviews of the best domain registration companies to find an affordable and reliable place for your site to reside.\n\nDecided on a web host for your business?
