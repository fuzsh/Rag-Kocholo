        "text": "In this article, we will take a look at three popular WordPress hosts: InMotion, SiteGround, and Hostinger, and determine which is the best, based on performance, security, support, price and more.\n\nThis article was originally written a few years ago, but we have recently gone through and updated it for 2023, as many things have changed in the hosting industry.\n\nBefore we get started, here’s the table of contents in case you want to skip to a particular section of this (long) review.\n\nOther articles in this series:\n\nBluehost vs SiteGround vs HostGator: Best WordPress Host\n\nSiteGround vs Godaddy vs InMotion: Best WordPress Host\n\nWordPress vs Duda vs Wix vs Weebly: The Ultimate Test\n\nNow, without further ado, let’s get started.\n\n1. Why do you need a good WordPress host?\n\nAre you a website investor or blogger who is creating a new site? Or migrating a purchased site? If you’re still unsure about why you should have a good WordPress host? You may be considering AWS for your hosting solution at the moment. Or you may have stumbled upon a cheap web host that lets you install WordPress with no additional cost.\n\nBut when your site starts to gain some traffic, it becomes inevitable that you’ll have to deal with persistent updates, traffic spikes, caching, CDNs, and definitely, hacking!\n\nIf you site is inaccessible to users, you can be sure that you will be losing money. But even if your site is just slightly slower than your competitor’s speed, you can lose your visitors. Thus, setting up all the caching, proxies, and web server to make your WordPress site run fast and reliably is vital.\n\nWe learned this the hard way. Initially, we hosted our sites on an AWS instance, and we handled it ourselves. As software engineers, we were actually very positive that we could beat any hosting company using our own custom installation. But when we ran a benchmark, we were dumbfounded to find out that our sites, compared to our large AWS server, ran faster on our medium SiteGround account.\n\nAnd it gets worse: Did you know that even moderately popular sites can be targeted by hackers? WordPress and WordPress plugins are notorious when it comes to security issues that require constant patches. If you don’t you want to get hacked, you must patch vulnerabilities right away. And sitting around performing patches takes you away from your actual business.\n\nWith all of this complexity, you’ll save yourself a lot of heartache by finding a good profession WordPress host.\n\n2. The Competitors\n\nFor our ultimate test, we decided to look at the three most well known WordPress hosts: Hostinger, SiteGround, and InMotion. Here’s a quick background on each of them.\n\n2.1. Hostinger: An Introduction\n\nHostinger is made up for a few different hosting brands, including 000webhost and Hosting24. They were started in Lithuania in 2004. They have data centers in the US, UK, Netherlands, Asia, and South America.\n\nIn total, Hostinger has over 29 million users and operates in nearly 200 countries.\n\n2.2. SiteGround: An Introduction\n\nSiteGround has been in existence since 2004, albeit, a bit smaller than some of the other hosts listed. It only provides hosting, but the WordPress community recommends it.\n\nIt is based out of Bulgaria, and has data centers worldwide.\n\n2.3. InMotion: An Introduction\n\nInMotion is one of the smallest of the hosts we have tested, but just like SiteGround, it has won many awards for its WordPress hosting.\n\nInMotion Hosting is based in California and is fully focused on hosting. They provide a wide range of hosting options from dedicated servers to basic web space.\n\n3. Tests\n\nWe wanted to create the most comprehensive, grueling WordPress hosting test of them all. Our testing scheme focuses on a set of criteria that we think are vital to running a WordPress site. Some of these criteria includes: performance, support, and reliability.\n\nThe following tests show the comparison of each host’s advertised $5-$7.50/month plan (since Hostinger’s top plan is advertised at $3.45, we used that). In case where there are multiple plans that meet the above guideline, we picked the lowest non-promo cost. Take note however, that these plans are all based on long-term commitments, which we will also note.\n\n4. Ease of Setup and Administration\n\nEase of use and administration is the first thing we tested for each host. We performed this test by setting up and attempting to administer identical WordPress sites. We took notice of what didn’t work, or what was confusing/complicated for each host. Moreover, we also note the things that we think were useful.\n\nFor each host, below are our ratings:\n\n* Not included in the plan we chose.\n\n4.1. Hostinger: Ease of Setup and Administration\n\nWe were very impressed with the setup process with Hostinger. Everything was clear and guided, and there were no problems getting a working install of WordPress.\n\nOne thing that wasn’t immediately obvious was that we had to set up the SSL certificate separately. When we clicked SSL, it tried to sell us an additional service, even though it was included. We eventually found that we had to set it up from another page. After that, everything was simple. Setting up CloudFlare CDN was also simple.\n\nThere were, however, a few hiccups: We did notice some warning messages from the included LiteSpeed cache plugin, saying that the module needs to be enabled at the server level. Also, for some reason, permalinks were not enabled by default, which was a bit of an annoyance.\n\nNevertheless, we were very happy with our Hostinger setup process.\n\n4.2. SiteGround: Ease of Setup and Administration\n\nSiteGround’s setup starts with a basic wizard. You’ll have to choose a theme and configurations. Once done, it’ll setup and install the latest version of everything automatically.\n\nAs WordPress, including all plugins are already updated.\n\nSimilar to InMotion, SiteGround uses cPanel for advanced setup. This can be a little confusing for non-technical people, but it isn’t required for most functionality. Still, if you want to maximize optimization and CDN functions, you’ll need to use it.\n\nThe most impressive thing about SiteGround is its flexibility and durability. We didn’t have to worry about contacting support or searching for answers as there were never any strange errors or bugs. This made SiteGround easy to use.\n\nWith SiteGround, everything just stared working as soon as we turned it on — including CloudFlare integration, HTTPS, and memcache.\n\n4.3. InMotion: Ease of Setup and Administration\n\nWhen you first sign up, InMotion says that they will call to help you set up, but we didn’t receive a call. Still, it was fairly simple to set up and ready our account.\n\nThings went well until we completed setup and got to the account dashboard, where we got a bit lost. It was only after we carefully read the emails InMotion sent us that we realized that there was separate information on how to log into our WordPress.\n\nInMotion has a wizard for WordPress configuration. The wizard has a lot of features, but it’s not that simple to use, and we found it to be a bit glitchy.\n\nWordPress functioned well once we had our site up and operating. The dashboard for WordPress worked as intended, and although WordPress was not automatically upgraded to the most recent version when we first logged in, an upgrade occurred soon after.\n\nInMotion provides content delivery network (CDN) services free of charge through JetPack. It’s not obvious how to set it up, as it has to be done from outside WordPress, but everything is simple once we got it running.\n\nHostinger and SiteGround\n\n5. Performance\n\nGetting and keeping visitors on your site are only possible if your site performs well. Because of this, it’s crucial to compare WordPress hosts based on performance.\n\nTo understand how SiteGround, Hostinger, and InMotion perform — and compare them accordingly — we conducted a battery of tests with the use of identical sites. The tests were subject to the following rules:\n\nIdentical pages were created to test each host.\n\nWithout the use of new performance enhancements, all pre-configured ones were turned on.\n\nWith the exception of pre-configured performance enhancements, all WordPress plugins were turned off.\n\nNo purchased add on services were used.\n\nAfter building sites on each host, we ran benchmarking programs to test the sites from locations all over the world.\n\n5.1. Page Speed Results\n\nTo measure how fast your website loads, we used WebPageTest.org. We conducted several runs at scattered times throughout the day to avoid the effects of network congestion. We did this for different locations worldwide.\n\nPlease refer to the graph below:\n\nHostinger Page Speed Results\n\nSiteGround Page Speed Results\n\nInMotion Page Speed Results\n\n5.2. Load Test Results\n\nWe carried out load tests on all of the hosts, in addition to speed testing.\n\nWhile page speed tests provide you with an insight on how your website is doing in an ideal scenario, conducting a load test is also necessary. By doing so, you will know how your website is doing under load. Each host has been screened using LoadImpact, with a maximum of 50 concurrent users.\n\nLooking at the results of a load test, you ideally see a linear ramp with flat response time in requests. If the host cannot keep up with traffic, you will see a drastic decrease in the number of requests, or large spikes can appear in response time. If things get really bad, you may begin to see the host dropping connections.\n\nWe evaluated Hostinger, InMotion and SiteGround using 50 concurrent users, which simulates the traffic received by a moderate sized blog or website.\n\nInMotion Load Test Results\n\nFrom the graph below you can see that InMotion had the excellent results for the page load test. The response time and request rate maintained their pace and there were no load errors at all.\n\nInMotion was able to handle 300-325 requests per second compared to the 275-300 for SiteGround. Although there was a 200ms spike in the InMotion load test, most of the responses were under 50ms, which is better than SiteGround.\n\nSiteGround Load Test Results\n\nThe chart below shows how SiteGround performed on our load tests. You can see from the chart that the request rate traces the green user curve very well, without any major deviations. This denotes that SiteGround performed quite well, although it wasn’t as good as InMotion.\n\nWith close to 50 millisecond response times throughout the tests, SiteGround is a solid performer. If you compare the blue line for SiteGround to that of other hosting companies, it appears that SiteGround is more variable, but that’s due to the scale difference.\n\nHostinger Load Test Results\n\nHostinger didn’t perform anywhere near as well as its InMotion or SiteGround on our load tests.\n\nBoth InMotion and SiteGround handled the 50 user requests easily, with a linear ramp up and generally consistent response times under 100 ms. However, Hostinger had significant surges in response time, up to 1.5 seconds, with a significant number of requests taking over 1 second to fulfill.\n\nAs you can see from the purple line in the graph, Hostinger could not consistently handle the requests, and started falling behind as soon as we got up to 50 concurrent users.\n\nInMotion Try it Now →\n\n6. Reliability\n\n6.1. Hostinger Reliability\n\nPingdom and HostingFacts have an uptime monitor that goes back for months for many different hosts. They track both uptime and response time.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the average uptime from Pingdom over all of the months of tracking available.\n\nBelow is a chart of the uptime for Hostinger, SiteGround, and InMotion over the past year, using the same data source. Note that the while the average above covers all data, the charts below only cover a year.\n\nThe next chart details what Pingdom calls “response time,” which is essentially time-to-first-byte for a very basic page. While the test is interesting, the tests in the previous section are much better for page load time in a real world scenario.\n\nSiteGround Try it Now →\n\n7. Security\n\nFor a basic overview of security, we utilized HackerTarget and WPScan to perform vulnerability scans.\n\nThese tests are not comprehensive, but they can give us a good sense of whether if there is a serious defect with any of the hosting companies. All of the hosts surpassed the vulnerability test, with one or fewer warnings.\n\n7.1. Hostinger Security\n\nOur site on Hostinger passed our basic vulnerability scan. Like many other hosts, Hostinger offers Cloudflare integration, which provides DDoS and intrusion protections. It also does a great job keeping WordPress and plugins up to date, which is one of the most common reasons that people get hacked.\n\nHostinger also has not had any widespread hacking incidents; however, one of its subsidiary brands had a widely publicized incident that exposed 13 million customers’ private data.\n\nIn our scan, we found that some of the default settings in our WordPress installation were not ideal for security purposes. If a user doesn’t fix those properly on their site, a hacker could have an easy attack vector.\n\n7.2. SiteGround Security\n\nSiteGround has an intrusion tracking system, firewalls on all its computers, web-separated settings with Apache suEXEC and PHP handlers configuration.\n\nSpecifically for WordPress, SiteGround automatically updates and has a specialized firewall configuration to safeguard against recognized and unexpected problems.\n\nFurthermore, Siteground WordPress hosting is integrated with CloudFlare. So, you get the additional DDoS and protection for intrusion from CloudFlare. They also safeguard against SQL injection, spam, XS attacks and more.\n\nNevertheless, SiteGround is not perfect. In the past, it was found that one of its optimizers (SG Optimizer) shows signs of vulnerability, but it appears to be fixed now.\n\nLike other hosts, SiteGround passed our basic vulnerability scan.\n\nTie\n\n8. Support\n\nIn this section, we examine the level of support offered by Hostinger, SiteGround and InMotion. We contacted their customer support representatives, and we analyzed how long it takes for them to resolve an issue.\n\nThe graph below shows the details.\n\n8.1. Hostinger Support\n\nHostinger support was amazing. We contacted them with our problem, and were in conversation with an agent in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe agent knew just what to do, and didn’t need to put us on hold or tell us to wait while. And within 3 minutes from when we connected, he had completely resolved our problem.\n\n8.2. SiteGround Support\n\nTo test SiteGround, we played around with several cPanel environment settings and created a redirect loop on our site. This resulted in an error message saying there were too many redirects on our site.\n\nAfter contacting SiteGround, in less than a minute, we got connected to a live agent and were able to tell them the problem.\n\nThe agent knew exactly what the problem was and knew what to do to resolve it. We waited for about six minutes for the agent to navigate to the cPanel settings, and then resolve the issue. We then could return to the site without any issues.\n\nWhile a few minutes slower than Hostinger, we were very impressed by SiteGround’s support.\n\n8.3. InMotion Support\n\nWith InMotion, we didn’t have to mess with the settings because we actually encountered a problem of “too many redirects.” However, it was because we used the wrong URL.\n\nThe minor issue and was resolved right away by the InMotion technical support agent, who immediately knew what we were doing wrong.\n\nThe disappointing part was that it took almost 45 minutes to get connected to a live agent. For every other hosting company, we were able to talk to someone in less than ten minutes.\n\nEven though the agent resolved the problem within eight minutes after we started talking, the overall interaction took almost an hour.\n\nHostinger and SiteGround\n\n9. Cost, Terms, and Cancellation\n\nWhen you select any host, you need to be aware of the terms and cost. Even though the prices are similar, not all hosts offer similar features. Here, we compare each host.\n\n9.1. What’s included?\n\nBelow is a comparison of what’s included with plans from Hostinger, SiteGround, and InMotion.\n\n9.2 Pricing Terms Comparison\n\nWhile the all of the hosts offer similar subscriptions, the difference lies in the terms. With InMotion, for example, the minimum subscription is at least a year. In this section, we’ll discuss the different terms and conditions of each subscription.\n\n10. And The Winner Is…\n\nChoosing a winner for this shootout wasn’t easy. SiteGround won a few categories, InMotion won performance, and Hostinger tied SiteGround in multiple categories.\n\nInMotion couldn’t compete with the other two in terms of support, so we couldn’t call it the all around winner — even though if we were looking for a pure performance option, we would choose it.\n\nHostinger, meanwhile, lagged behind the rest in performance, and was not an individual winner in any category.\n\nSo in the end, we chose SiteGround as the winner…although all of these options would be great for your next WordPress site."
