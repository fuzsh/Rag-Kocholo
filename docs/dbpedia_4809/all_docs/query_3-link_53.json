        "text": "All the web hosting information founders and startups need in one handy guide.\n\nWhat Is Web Hosting And How Does It Work?\n\nCrafting a gorgeous, truly intuitive, and optimised website is no easy feat and usually isnât what people expect. Thatâs because the end product may resemble a work of art, but the truth is that itâs actually rendered from a load of files.\n\nYep, just boring old files.\n\nThose files that constitute your site canât just float around the internet until someone needs them though, which means that they need a place to live. âWeb hostingâ is basically the term used to describe the process by which the files that comprise your website are housed on a server. Whoever owns the server on which your files (website) are allocated space is actually your hosting provider.\n\nSounds simple, doesnât it? And thatâs good because this web hosting guide is here to simplify the hosting process.\n\nNow, letâs move on to why you should care about web hosting and how itâs performed.\n\nWhy Is Web Hosting So Important?\n\nThe internet is a vast place and itâs difficult to get noticed. This means that every business decision you make has to be optimised for success, and choosing your hosting provider is no exception.\n\nYour website is akin to your modern-day storefront. Itâs often the first touch point that your target audience will have with your brand, so you want to ensure that itâs a good experience. Your web host can make or break your website user experience (UX), so itâs a crucial decision and can be costly if you get it wrong.\n\nSo how do we ensure that you give your online presence every chance of success?\n\nThe 4 Main Forms Of Web Hosting\n\nAlthough web hosting is an enormous umbrella term, you can generally group the types of hosting into 4 broad categories:\n\nShared Hosting - If your website is sharing server space with other websites, then you have a âshared hosting provider,â my friend.\n\nDedicated - Youâve chosen to be a little more selfish. Your website now has its own âdedicatedâ server. This usually means better performance (and higher bills).\n\nVirtual Private Server (VPS) - The halfway house between shared and dedicated hosting. A VPS imitates the shared server experience even though youâre still sharing physical server space. Very technical and extremely boring, but suffice to say that you can quickly get bitten if you donât know the performance metrics to look out for.\n\nReseller - As simple as it sounds. An intermediary purchases server space from a hosting company before selling it for a profit. This oneâs definitely not a route we recommend to founders and small businesses.\n\nAs you can see from the categories above, the amount of server space youâre allocated matters. Itâll impact how your site performs and, therefore, that all-important consumer UX.\n\nThis web hosting guide is going to focus on âshared hostingâ. Itâs easy, economic, and will suit the needs of over 99% of small to midsize businesses.\n\nThe 5 Questions You Need To Ask Your Hosting Provider\n\nAppraising the main players in the web hosting industry is a little like walking into a car showroom to choose between two models of exactly the same car. To a casual observer, thereâs absolutely nothing to differentiate between the two and they think youâre mad for paying more for either. Open the door and pop the hood, though and weâre admitted to a world of difference in terms of horsepower and trim. This translates into a huge difference in the actual value that youâre getting.\n\nWeb hosting is no different. Ostensibly, you can judge the disparity between the introductory offers from companies like Bluehost and GoDaddy in pennies. However, once we scratch the surface, we begin to find a world of upsells and value traps. These upgradeable services are how the hosting providers differentiate themselves from their competition, and determining true value can be a nightmare.\n\nFortunately, you can use the following 5 questions to determine the true value of their offering:\n\nHow fast is my site load time?\n\nSales funnels are crucial to the success of any business, but especially to small or midsize ones. Many of them will rely on generating organic search engine traffic. That means that you want to ensure that your page is ranking as high as possible on the search engine results page (SERP).\n\nA fast site loading speed is crucial if you want to conquer the SERP and get more clicks. Google downranks slow load times, and research has proven that your bounce rate rockets from 9% to 38% if you keep consumers waiting for 2 seconds instead of 3!\n\nHow secure is my site?\n\nIf you have a website these days, then youâre almost certainly planning on taking online payments or holding personal customer data. If you have a website in the modern era, then youâre almost certainly doing at least one of them. The boom in e-commerce over the past 2 years has thrown cyber security to the forefront of everyoneâs mind.\n\nMalicious cyber actors are only getting better and Itâs honestly not worth logging on to discover youâve been hacked just to save a few pennies a month.\n\nWhatâs your customer support like?\n\nThe vast majority of people arenât technically competent enough to manage faults on their own servers. That means that youâll have to rely on customer service at some point.\n\nThe last thing you want is a disinterested customer support team looking after your site. You want someone who understands that this is your actual business. Someone who understands that It could even be your livelihood on the line.\n\nThat sense of urgency should necessitate a mindset shift from âtime to resolutionâ as opposed to âtime to acknowledgementâ. Many customer support metrics focus on the latter, which is useless. Acknowledging a fault is meaningless until youâve rectified it.\n\nHow easy is it to scale my business with this hosting provider?\n\nNobody starts a business without at least some hope that it will grow to be the next Amazon or Facebook. Astronomic growth is something all founders want and that means they should ensure that their hosting provider is able to service that growth without exponentially increasing their cost.\n\nThat leaves you with two scenarios. Youâre either going to have to factor in scaling from the outset and purchase more than you need or ensure that your web host can economically upgrade your plan.\n\nThe former leaves you paying for services that you donât need, the latter requires you to be somewhat more scrupulous when judging value offerings. I know which one Iâd pickâ¦\n\nHow much is hosting my content going to cost me?\n\nYouâre probably asking why Iâve put the almighty dollar last on this list. Well, as already mentioned, the main hosting providers all come in at nearly identical initial costs.\n\nThat means that you can only understand the true cost of what youâre purchasing once youâve decided which upsells to opt for (because, believe me, youâre going to need to purchase at least some of them).\n\nWhatâs Wrong With GoDaddy?\n\nWe canât really compare GoDaddy to their competition without first appraising the publicly traded American web hosting juggernaut. I mean, theyâre clearly doing something right, considering their customer base clocks in at over 20 million, and they celebrate their 25th anniversary this year.\n\nSo letâs take an objective view of both the good and bad aspects of GoDaddyâs introductory offer.\n\nWhat GoDaddy does well:\n\nThere has to be a reason GoDaddy has amassed its customer base. Perhaps the multitudes were attracted by one of the following?:\n\nExtremely low introductory cost of less than Â£4.\n\nImpressive site load times of 480ms on average.\n\nUnmetered bandwidth as standard.\n\nFree domain for the first year.\n\nWhat GoDaddy does poorly:\n\nAll of the above freebies require a 12-month contract signup period.\n\nNo security credentials in sight. Even a secure socket layer (SSL) certificate will cost you extra.\n\nAnecdotal evidence of wildly fluctuating wait times for their customer service.\n\nYou need to sign up for a 3-year term if you want to unlock their best features.\n\nAs you can see, GoDaddyâs ostensibly excellent value offering folds under a modicum of scrutiny. So are there better web hosting services out there? And if so, then where?\n\nThe Top 5 GoDaddy Alternatives\n\n1. Tiiny Host\n\nTiiny Host is rapidly forging a reputation as the most intuitive static web hosting provider on the market. Rock-solid security and a phenomenally intuitive UX make them a perfect fit for startups and marketing agencies.\n\nSpeed\n\nGoogle will almost certainly continue to heavily bias faster load times in their SERP rankings. Tiiny Hostâs positioning as a static content host affords them unbeatable speeds at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThis gives you an edge from both ends of the value chain when serving your customers and could prove the difference in competitive arenas such as ecommerce.\n\nSecurity\n\nYour server is probably going to be working harder than Elon Muskâs PA once your content library grows and your traffic picks up. Thatâs because dynamic content requires your server to render content afresh for each individual consumer. Remember those files we mentioned? The ones that constitute your website? Well, theyâre going to be flying around faster than characters in a Marvel movie, which gives cyber attackers plenty of opportunities to intercept the packets.\n\nTiiny Host has negated many of the traditional cyber vulnerability issues by focusing on security as a design consideration. Specialising in cached content means your server isnât constantly exposed to having to render file after file. This drastically reduces the number of times itâs exposed.\n\nSupport\n\nTiiny Host has decided to take a radically different route from their competitors when it comes to customer support in that they purposely donât offer a phone line or 24/7 support.\n\nThis may seem counterintuitive at first glance. After all, the aforementioned facets have been the pan-industry hallmark of customer service for decades. Nevertheless, Tiiny Host has opted to mitigate any issues in the 3 following ways:\n\nEvery ticket is dealt with by a human at the first instance. This negates the need to qualify through a bot masquerading as an artificially intelligent assistant.\n\nTiiny Host focuses on that all-important âtime to resolutionâ metric as opposed to the âtime to acknowledgementâ. This means that they consistently resolve issues faster than competitors, as opposed to just dispatching a holding email.\n\nTiiny Hostâs user interface has purposely been designed as the most intuitive one on the market. This means that they simply donât handle the same level of customer service complaints and queries as some competitors.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability has once again been dealt with at the design level by Tiiny Host. Their âdrag and dropâ UI is simplicity itself. This removes a significant barrier for both technical and non-technical startups and agencies to cheaply and rapidly test content and scale projects.\n\nThe inclusion of password protection at the toggle of a button means that you can secure your test environment with ease and only release when ready.\n\nCouple that simplicity with a simple bolt-on service for larger file sizes and more sites, and you have a service that scales as your startup or agency does.\n\nPrice\n\nTiiny Host have clearly designed their pricing model with growth minded startups at the forefront of their thinking. Their pricing perfectly aligns with their scalable bolt on packages and is modeled around file size and number of sites.\n\nThis equates to a hosting service you can scale both economically and simply.\n\n2. Siteground\n\nThe dynamic hosting stalwart boasts an impressive value offering and is arguably the best of the dynamic hosts.\n\nSpeed\n\nAlthough they lag behind Tiiny Host in terms of speed, Siteground nevertheless proved the fastest of any of the dynamic hostsâ basic plans. This is likely due to their âsupercacherâ feature, meaning that theyâre able to provide phenomenal load speeds without opting for the dedicated server.\n\nCouple that with their (reportedly valid) boast of over 99% uptime and youâre on to a winning formula.\n\nSecurity\n\nThe basic security package offered by Siteground is arguably the best of the dynamic web hosts, paltry though it is.\n\nThe IDS/IDP security forms a line of defence against malicious bots and Modsecurity is installed on all of their shared servers.\n\nAlthough they bolster their offering through a custom web application firewall and weekly updated security rules, youâll still want to purchase their upgraded security for peace of mind.\n\nAnd peace of mind doesnât come cheaplyâ¦\n\nSupport\n\nThe industry standard of 24/7 support through both phone and chat is on offer here.\n\nThatâs all well and good, but the service doesnât appear particularly nuanced.\n\nScalability\n\nSitegroundâs âsupercacherâ feature coupled with their unmetered traffic means that your service can grow with you. The addition of a content delivery network as standard is also a nice touch and bolsters their appeal to international customers.\n\nHowever, youâre probably going to want to opt for Increased memory and 30% faster PHP if you intend to meaningfully scale and thatâs a premium feature.\n\nPrice\n\nSitegroundâs introductory offer would be an impressively low Â£2.99 a month if it wasnât for the fact that their competitors have similar pricing structures and necessary upsells will undoubtedly increase the cost.\n\nNevertheless, their basic plan is arguably the best of a bad bunch.\n\nRelated article: 5 Best Siteground Alternatives For Web Hosting\n\n3. Hostgator\n\nHostgator have clocked an impressive 6 straight years as PCMagâs web host provider of choice despite the fact their basic âhatchlingâ plan leaves much to be desired.\n\nSpeed\n\nHostgator are able to closely mirror Siteground when it comes to rendering dynamic content. Sitegroundâs âsupercacherâ and free CDN give them the advantage in this area though and definitely present better value for money.\n\nSecurity\n\nLess impressive than their close competitor Siteground here but still beating GoDaddy. Hostgator offer an SSL as part of their basic plan alongside their free âspamassassinâ spam protection. Backups and malware protection are only notable by their absence though and including them will necessitate reaching for the credit cardâ¦\n\nSupport\n\nNo surprises here as Hostgator fall directly in line with the aforementioned industry standard. A decent knowledge centre bolsters their ticketing system and 24/7 phone and chat coverage though.\n\nScalability\n\nHostgator perform surprisingly poorly when it comes to scalability. They match GoDaddyâs unmetered bandwidth but fail to offer a CDN.\n\nPrice\n\nItâs honestly difficult to know where to start here. The simple fact of the matter is that Hostgatorâs introductory cost of Â£3 is completely overshadowed by the need to lock in for 3 years.\n\nThat wasnât a typo and you didnât read it wrong. Thatâs simply a criminal amount of time to demand anyone commit to a service and undermines any value that is otherwise delivered.\n\nRelated article: 5 Best Hostgator Alternatives For Web Hosting\n\n4. Bluehost\n\nIf there was a superpower in the world of web hosting then Bluehost would undoubtedly take the crown. Theyâre certainly the biggest, but size doesnât always equal valueâ¦\n\nSpeed\n\nBluehost are fast out of the gate here. How fast you might ask? Blisteringly so. In fact, theyâre the only provider whoâs basic offering is capable of beating Sitegroundâs âsupercacherâ and they scored near perfectly in site uptime.\n\nSecurity\n\nItâs a real shame to follow such an impressive performance with an shatteringly poor one but Bluehost somehow manage it. Their basic plan only extends as far as an SSL certificate. This brings them slightly ahead of GoDaddy in terms of value offering, but leaves them woefully lacking against stiffer competition from the likes of Siteground.\n\nSupport\n\nNo prizes for guessing Bluehostâs support package as itâs a near perfect mirror of GoDaddyâs.\n\nHowever, anecdotal evidence of a lacklustre approach to customer support seriously jeopardises that all important âtime to resolutionâ metric.\n\nScalability\n\nBluehost begin turning things around here by offering unmetered bandwidth before topping it up with an industry leading 5 free email accounts. That represents a significant saving once you factor in the cost of G suite.\n\nWeâre still lacking a CDN though and their content builder is an absolute nightmare when it comes to UX.\n\nPrice\n\nIf it wasnât for the unavoidable upsells then Bluehostâs staggeringly low introductory offer of Â£2.20 would be unbeatable. However, we begin to discover significant issues once we scratch the surface and interrogate the value offering.\n\nWoefully lacking security and lacklustre customer support leave you exposed at the worst of times.\n\nRelated article: 5 Best Bluehost Alternatives for Web Hosting\n\n5. Dreamhost\n\nAssumptions can be costly in the world of web hosting. For example, Dreamhostâs independent status should arguably result in a more personalised serviceâ¦\n\nSpeed\n\nServers located in North America and Western Europe result in excellent service for Western customers. However, their site load times donât compare with Sitegroundsâ and the lack of a CDN seriously undermines the service for international visitors to your site.\n\nSecurity\n\nDreamhost fare slightly better here. They easily beat GoDaddy by offering an SSL certificate and domain privacy as standard. Youâll still almost certainly want to opt for their âdreamshieldâ security package though, a significant cost increase.\n\nSupport\n\nDreamhostâs customer support is a tale of two halves. Their channels fall firmly in line with their competitors and they get brownie points for basing their call centres in the U.S.\n\nHowever, not only do they fail to offer an inbound support call service but also charge their customers for the privilege of a callback option!\n\nThe lack of an inbound phone based customer support function isnât unique for the industry. However, the move to charge your consumers for a callback function leaves a sour taste in the mouth and undermines trust in Dreamhost.\n\nScalability\n\nUnmetered bandwidth brings Dreamhost in line with GoDaddy but 50GB of storage raises them above the web hosting juggernaut. Both are suitable for running a fairly large site and allow startups and founders to scale.\n\nPrice\n\nDreamhostâs introductory offer is competitive in terms of price but theyâre let down by their attempt to charge their customer base for a basic service. Their cost also doubles not once, but twice once you add their âdreamshieldâ security package and at contract renewal respectively.\n\nRelated article: SiteGround vs. DreamHost\n\nWeb Hosting Wrapped Up\n\nThe fog of confusion surrounding the web hosting industry only serves the purposes of the major players. They use shockingly low introductory offers to cut through the noise before insidiously upselling their consumer base.\n\nThis web hosting guide arms you with the knowledge to thoroughly interrogate your web hosting provider. This means you not only get the best hosting provider based on price, but also one tailored to your current and future needs as you scale and grow."
