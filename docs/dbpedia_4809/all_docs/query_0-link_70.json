You wouldn’t build your house on a weak foundation, so why would you create a website using unreliable hosting providers?\n\nSelecting the wrong web hosting company can ruin your plans for setting up a website or starting a blog successfully.\n\nI have reviewed every service, and compared their features and pricing plans so that you don’t have to! Plus, our team has conducted in-depth credibility research to select the top 9 web hosts that you can count on.\n\nHow to choose the best web hosting provider (DIY)\n\nWeb hosting providers you select should be affordable and offer great site speed, support, and security. Also, you need a solution that allows you to rapidly scale your website to handle higher traffic as your audience grows.\n\nWith the help of trusted service, you can develop a virtual presence through a professional website for your company or online business. The best hosting service for you must have all of the features and tools (such as CMSes or website builders) that you need to build an amazing website.\n\nA checklist for evaluating service\n\nYou might think that all web hosting companies provide the same services, but that’s far from the truth. Choosing a proper website host requires a great deal of consideration and evaluation. Some of the most important features for web hosting comparison before selecting a company are:\n\n1. Check if it is trustworthy\n\nThe right firm must be reliable and trustworthy in its guarantees of customer care, follow-up service, quality, and performance. Although measuring trust can be a challenge, you can gather web hosting reviews from users, along with data analytics, and combine them to find reliable web hosting.\n\n2. Read the terms and conditions\n\nYou should not just skim through the terms and conditions but read them carefully. The terms of service usually include the refund policy which is important to know before signing up for a service.\n\n3. Price and payment options\n\nThe most important detail to consider is the price and payment options for a company’s hosting plans. Many web hosts offer basic features at a reasonable price while some will charge more for additional services beyond the basic levels.\n\nTherefore, it’s essential to view all of the pricing plans and determine if all of the features that you require are available in any plan you are considering. Moreover, you should also view all payment options for easy and secure payment transfers.\n\n4. Money-back guarantee\n\nA good web hosting company must offer strong refund policies paired with uptime guarantees to give site owners an option for a way out in case the plan does not meet their requirements. These policies are an important feature that differentiates brands and allows them to stand out from the crowd.\n\n5. Technical support\n\nThis is one of the most important factors to evaluate when choosing the best website hosting service. Whether it is a simple query about the website setup or fixing a website when it crashes, prompt customer support is extremely important. You can make a test call or start a live chat with the company you are considering, just to get an idea of the quality of their support if an issue arises.\n\n6. Reliability and uptime\n\nIf your website is inaccessible or slow, you will lose sales opportunities and productivity. You need a web host that promises a certain amount of uptime and reimburses when any unplanned outages occur. The uptime guarantee usually ranges from 100% to as low as 99%.\n\n7. Backup security\n\nSecurity breaches happen all of the time, no matter the type or size of the business. Make sure that your hosting company provides backup security to protect your customer’s private information. Providing customers with the security of safe transactions is an essential feature. Top hosting should provide firewalls, data monitoring, and other security tools to protect against any vulnerabilities.\n\n8. SSL (secure server)\n\nThis is particularly important as plenty of web hosting companies offer free SSL certificates now. Even if you are just starting to build a website, getting SSL protection in place will help you to encrypt the data that your site exchanges with users and visitors.\n\n9. Room to grow\n\nYou need a solution that is equipped to successfully manage a large influx of clients without compromising their online experience. Many companies experience growth quickly but they don’t have the resources to handle it. This can create problems like slow page loads, site downtime, and even impact search rankings.\n\nWhat types of web hosting exist out there?\n\nIf you are not sure about the kind of service that is right for you, here is an explanation of the different types:\n\nShared hosting – With this option, you share hosting space with other users on the server. This plan is for small and medium-sized businesses that require basic websites or blogs. It provides all of the fundamental features at a low cost. Usually, these plans start from $4 to $10 a month.\n\nVirtual private server (VPS) – This is an intermediate plan between a shared and a dedicated server. With VPS, the server is divided into virtual sections and each website resides within its assigned section. It is ideal for bigger websites and owners who require more control. Pricing plans start from $10+ a month.\n\nDedicated server – A dedicated hosting option offers the most control to website owners over their server space. The server is exclusively rented by you and it stores your website only. Pricing plans start from $100 per month and up.\n\nWordPress hosting – This solution is optimized to align with WordPress’s performance and security requirements. It usually includes one-click WordPress installations, which is the best option for people looking for web hosting for blogs. Similar to the shared type, plans start from $4 to $10 a month.\n\nCloud hosting – Cloud hosting is similar to VPS, but instead of one physical server, your website is hosted on a network using combined computing resources.\n\nManaged hosting – Managed service comes with an added level of technical support. The hosting provider will manage your operating systems, hardware, software setup and configuration, maintenance, and monitoring.\n\nReseller hosting – Reseller is a type of service that involves one company renting hard drive space and bandwidth to another company that will then rent it to other smaller businesses.\n\nFAQs before buying web hosting\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are countless web hosting services available online, but you need to carefully consider your requirements and the service’s features to choose the best web hosting for you.\n\nWhether you are searching for the cheapest hosting plan or the most robust services or something specific that suits your small business, I hope this guide helped you to find the best website hosting company for your needs."
