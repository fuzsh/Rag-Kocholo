With a reseller hosting plan, you get all the powerful tools you need to succeed in your reseller hosting business.\n\nYou can start as low as $81 per credit for a year and get special domain name deals.\n\nTo join the program, you just need to order 5 reseller credits. One credit is equivalent to 1-year hosting. When you purchase more credits in bulk, youâ€™ll get high discounts. Since reseller credits never expire, you can use them anytime to launch or renew hosting accounts for your clients.\n\nBest of all, with SiteGroundâ€™s reseller hosting, you get white-labeled cPanel and private DNS upgrades.\n\nStart by purchasing 5 reseller credits\n\n1 credit per activation\n\nReseller credit never expires\n\nSpecial domain name deals\n\n$6.69 / month\n\nGet started with SiteGround today!\n\nSiteGround comes with a unique set of features that help you create a blazing-fast website with ease. Letâ€™s take a look at some of the important features you need to look for when hosting a website.\n\nFree SSL\n\nWith every SiteGround hosting plan, you get a free SSL certificate. When you host your website on the SiteGround platform, a free standard SSL certificate is automatically enabled without any effort.\n\nSiteGround integrates with the Letâ€™s Encrypt project to provide SSL certificates to its users. An SSL certificate protects user data and helps meet search engine requirements to improve website rankings.\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nSiteGround offers a free CDN which enables the website to load from the nearest data point for a user. Cloudflareâ€™s CDN, clubbed with SiteGround hosting, ensures your website loads quickly and has the fastest response time.\n\nFree Email Service\n\nSiteGround lets you create a free email address with your domain name. Thereâ€™s no limit to adding email accounts to your hosting plan.\n\nThe email tools include a user-friendly webmail interface, email forwarding option, autoresponders, and more. They also support SMTP, POP3, and other email protocols to deliver your emails smoothly.\n\nSuper Caching\n\nBy default, SiteGround enables a caching system for all users on their servers. This means your site will load faster than usual from the memory of the server.\n\nIt comes with a SuperCacher service to further improve the website loading speed. This service is available specifically for their premium plans (GrowBig and GoGeek).\n\nFree Auto Daily Backups\n\nMany web hosting services donâ€™t back up your site on a daily basis. However, all SiteGround plans come with daily automatic backups, ensuring you donâ€™t have to remember to back up your site regularly.\n\nYou can also generate on-demand backups from SiteGroundâ€™s provided tools. This service is free on the premium plans and costs a minimal fee on the starter plan.\n\nWebsite Transfer Tool\n\nWhen moving a website from one host to another, you need to be careful of traffic, security, backups, and many other things. SiteGround offers a free WordPress plugin that works magically to move your WordPress website without affecting your content or configuration.\n\nSiteGround also provides a professional website migration and transfer service. This is a paid service where a team of experts will move your site while you sit back and relax.\n\nSSD Storage\n\nSiteGround uses solid-state drives (SSDs) instead of Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) for storage. Since SSDs donâ€™t have moving parts, theyâ€™ve been proven to improve site performance compared to websites that use HDD storage.\n\nAdvanced Security\n\nSecurity is the key concern when hosting a website with any provider. SiteGround provides free in-house SSH to restrict user account access for your hosting.\n\nIt gives an encrypted connection to your hosting account, so web developers and website admins can access the web server in a secure environment. These security features also help manage large files and databases securely.\n\nSiteGround Hosting Pros:\n\nLetâ€™s take a look at how SiteGround stacks up against the competition:\n\nChoose Your Data Center\n\nEven with a shared hosting plan, youâ€™ll be asked to choose your preferred data center. This way, you can ensure your site is hosted on servers closer to your audience geographically.\n\nAmazing Customer Support\n\nSiteGround is well-known for its superior customer service. Best of all, you donâ€™t have to wait more than a few seconds for the next available operator because they have additional support staff in all shifts, so thereâ€™s always someone to pick up the live chat. With the GoGeek plan, youâ€™ll get priority support.\n\nUnmetered Bandwidth\n\nThe bandwidth is unmetered meaning youâ€™re not charged based on the bandwidth. SiteGroundâ€™s StartUp plan, GrowBig plan, and GoGeek plan come with an unmetered data transfer that you can use as much as you like.\n\nMoney-Back Guarantee\n\nSiteGround offers a 30-day money-back guarantee on all their plans. This will allow you to test the service and tools with full options for up to a month and if you feel SiteGround isnâ€™t the host for your site, you can request a full refund.\n\nThe refund doesnâ€™t include the domain registration fees. The domain name will be your property anyway.\n\nSiteGround Hosting Cons:\n\nHere are some limitations of SiteGround Hostingâ€¦\n\nExpensive Plans\n\nCompared to other hosting providers like Bluehost, SiteGroundâ€™s pricing is a bit expensive. However, SiteGround offers several unique features than Bluehost for faster page rendering.\n\nNo Free Domain\n\nUnlike popular web hosting services, SiteGround doesnâ€™t offer free domain names with their plans. If youâ€™re starting your website, this will be an additional cost to your budget.\n\nSiteGround Uptime Guarantee and Speed Tests\n\nSiteGround ensures a 99.9% uptime guarantee. Best of all, if you ever experience more than 0.1% downtime on a yearly basis, you will be compensated.\n\nTo provide our users with real facts, we built a WordPress test site environment and perform several speed tests using the following tools:\n\nPingdom\n\nLoad Impact\n\nBitcatcha\n\nAccording to Pingdomâ€™s website speed test, our test site loads in less than a second for a server in Dallas, Texas. Thatâ€™s faster than 95% of all tested sites.\n\nApart from Pingdom, we also used a testing tool called Load Impact to figure out how SiteGround handles visitors during a traffic surge. Load Impact sent some virtual users (VUs) to our site and gradually built up to 100 visitors at a time.\n\nIn the chart, you can find a blue line (VUs active) which shows the number of virtual users sent to our SiteGround site and a green line (VU load time) which represents how much time it would take to load a web page for a user.\n\nSiteGround performed almost consistently except for a spike when there were 50 users on the site. It quickly recovered and page load time remained steadily low even with more users.\n\nItâ€™s worth noting that the site never went down during our speed test. Take a look at the report below.\n\nSiteGround Server Response Time\n\nThe content on your website has a huge influence on page loading time. For instance, if your site has too many images, it will take more time to load than a lightweight site. In fact, images account for most of the downloadable bytes in a typical site.\n\nTo get accurate results, instead of the analysis of page load time alone, we decided to test the actual server response time by entirely ignoring the content of our SiteGround site.\n\nTo track our SiteGround server response time, we used a tool known as Bitcatcha. Bitcatcha works differently from Pingdom.\n\nBitcatcha ignores the content of your page and records the page loading time from eight different global locations: New York, LA, London, Brazil, India, Singapore, Japan, and Australia. The speed for each location is measured three separate times, and then the results are averaged.\n\nFrom the result, itâ€™s evident that SiteGround is the perfect choice if your target audience is mostly located in the United States. In the United States, the server responded in just a fraction of a second. In all other locations, except Japan, the server responded within less than a second.\n\nIf your target audience is mostly located in Japan, itâ€™s in your best interest to move your site to their Asia-Pacific data center for the best results.\n\nHaving helped thousands of users choose a web hosting plan and start their website, we have answered just about every question you can think of.
