        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nWe are now introducing our own Private DNS service, which allows you to customize the default name servers on our platform for enhanced online privacy and completely white-label hosting. It takes full advantage of our centralized DNS service, which was built to ensure faster domain name resolving for a faster website loading, enhanced reliability, and easy DNS management, and which also formed the basis for our own Cloud-based Content Delivery Network to additionally improve site performance.\n\nIntroducing our Private DNS service\n\nThe DNS service translates the domain names (pages’ URLs) to the numerical IP addresses of the servers hosting the website content. Thus instead of visitors having to type a combination of numbers in the browser, they can use letters and words. Thanks to our centralized DNS service, all domains registered with SiteGround are now using the same default name servers: ns1.siteground.net and ns2.siteground.net. Our Private DNS service makes it possible to change those to your own custom name servers, based on your own domain names or your brand. It allows you to point all your websites’ domains to these unique name servers. For example:\n\nns1.mydomainname.com\n\nns2.mydomainname.com\n\nWhat are the benefits of our new Private DNS service?\n\nEnhanced online privacy\n\nUsing custom domain server names helps enhance your online privacy. The Private DNS service hides the default ns1.siteground.net and ns2.siteground.net name servers. This obfuscation of the information makes it harder for third parties to find out where exactly your domain is located, which hinders them from taking advantage of potential issues that may arise on the servers.\n\nCompletely white-label hosting\n\nThe Private DNS service is especially useful for white-label resellers. If you wish to offer hosting to your clients, but you don’t wish them to know that the service is provided by SiteGround and have them communicate with us directly, using the Private DNS is a great idea. That will help you conceal who’s the original host, which makes you the sole provider and increases your brand name visibility.\n\nHow to activate and manage the Private DNS service?\n\nYou can activate Private DNS for your domain from Client Area > Marketplace > Hosting Services > Additional Services. You get this service for free if you are on a GoGeek or Cloud hosting plan. The Private DNS is also available on a yearly subscription basis for all other customers who want to use this service. To be able to enable Private DNS for your domain name, it must be registered with SiteGround.\n\nTo manage and view your DNS information, you can do so from Client Area > Services > Domains > Manage (for the associated domain) > Extras.\n\nYour Comment Cancel\n\nError!\n\nI agree to the SiteGround Privacy Policy.
