Initially available only to trademark holders, they will be open for general registration by the end of September, offering businesses fresh opportunities for unique online identities. ‚ùó.com Price Increase Impact As we have covered recently, Verisign will raise .com domain prices by 7% starting in September.

One reason is that some large companies, like Ford, hold millions of these addresses but don‚Äôt use them. How did this happen? In my latest podcast episode, I talk with Vincentas Grinius from IPXO. He explains that when IPv4 was first introduced, no one expected the internet to become so big. As a result, these addresses were given away in huge amounts. Today, with IPv4 addresses in short supply, companies like IPXO are helping by connecting those who have extra addresses with those who need them, creating a trusted marketplace. üéß The full episode is available webhosting.today #WebhostingToday #Podcast #IPv4 #IPXO\n\nüëÄ Thank you all for the amazing support over the past two days‚Äîit‚Äôs been quite a ride!

Know Your Financials: Make sure you understand your numbers and that your potential buyer will understand it too. 2. Keep The Infrastructure Simple: A straightforward, easy-to-manage infrastructure is more appealing to buyers that seek an easy onboarding and unification. üí° Aim Higher: If you want to increase your company's value, consider positioning it as a SaaS solution, not just a hosting company. Solving bigger problems with a holistic approach can lead to a much better multiplier. Vincentas speaks from experience as he went through selling Heficed a few years ago.
