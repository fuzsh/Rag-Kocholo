        "text": "Please read the disclaimer below to understand how affiliate links work.\n\nWhat is an affiliate link?\n\nSome of the links on our site are affiliate links, which means that we earn a commission when you purchase products or services through them.\n\nWhen you click on these links, your visit is tagged with a special cookie to track the referral from our site.\n\nThese links can look like this:\n\nmprstudio.com/partner/siteground\n\nor this https://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=74100eb5b09a33cb639487c5cd60b7d6\n\nUnlike many other sites, I ONLY RECOMMEND products that are of utmost quality. SiteGround hosting is a great example – their hosting service is awesome and affordable, and they provide stellar customer/technical support. In fact, I use SiteGround to host this site and a few others.\n\nI believe in total transparency, and really want you to choose the best possible options for your website.\n\nMany sites recommend BlueHost because they receive generous affiliate commissions for referral sales they generate. BlueHost SUCKS, and you should never buy their hosting service. You will never be able to rely on their service, and you’ll waste tons of time waiting for their customer support to NOT ANSWER your questions.\n\nPlease know that when you purchase anything through affiliate links on MPR Studio, you can rest assured that you’re getting something which we stand behind wholeheartedly.\n\nOne site claims to be a “People First” company, and they recommend BlueHost. They are doing their readers a huge disservice by recommending such a crappy product.\n\nNote: BlueHost used to be a great host. Then, they were purchased by EIG, a publicly traded company which has a habit of buying great hosting companies and completely destroying them. DO NOT purchase hosting service from any of the hosts listed in this post.\n\nDoes it cost me more?\n\nNo. When you purchase anything through our referral links, it will cost you the exact same amount as if you were to purchase the product by going directly to the seller’s site.\n\nHelp us spread the word\n\nMy main goal with this site is to help as many people as possible get the most out of self-hosted WordPress. I spend a lot of time writing in-depth tutorials to show people step-by-step how to do all kinds of super helpful things using the WordPress CMS.\n\nHelp me continue to provide helpful content in the following ways:\n\nShare my posts with your friends and family on social media and via email.\n\nIf you’re going to buy a product we recommend, please purchase them through our affiliate links.\n\nTell people about our FREE WordPress Setup, which helps them get a basic site up and running in no time. Did I mention it comes with must-have plugins for optimal SEO, speed and security?\n\nIf you find MPR Studio helpful, we’d greatly appreciate it if you help support us so we can continue to create super-helpful, in-depth WordPress tutorials.\n\nThanks for your support!"
