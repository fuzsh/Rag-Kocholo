Your users will be able to login to Siteground with your IdP credentials. IT admins can easily manage user access activities and grant or revoke SSO access to Siteground application.\n\nWhen a user logs in to one application, with SSO they can login in all other applications automatically, regardless of the technology, platform or domain of the user.\n\nOpenID Connect (OIDC)\n\nOpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of Oauth 2.0 protocol, It allows applications to verify the identity of an end user based on the authentication performed by the authorisation server, as well as to obtain the basic information about the end user."
