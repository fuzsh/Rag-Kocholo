        "text": "VPS (Virtual Private Servers), which are best suited if you are starting up your business and want all the features of a server in comparatively low cost. I have used Go4hosting for around 4 years.\n\nIf you can manage your own web services, a VPS is the best way to go. If you can’t or don’t wish to, pick up shared hosting from any of dozens of companies. I’d personally recommend a non-EIG company (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_International_Group), as they own half of the bigger hosting companies and are, in my opinion, not worth working with.\n\nDepends on your system requirements, location, etc. However, if you’re somehow familiar with the hosting services, VPS is surely better solution then a shared hosting to host your application. Moreover, if you take VPS with some popular and easy-to-manage control panel e.g. cPanel, that would much improve your hosting experience.\n\nFrom the vast number of great hosting providers, as by my personal experience, I’d definitely recommend Hosting by Euro-Space as one of the best and reliable hosts, with exceptional 24x7 technical support and great performance servers. Affordable prices, uptime and money back is guaranteed.\n\n@arvind00557: why do you think it’s the best option for @pacifistceo? On what are you basing your assessment?\n\nTo all posters: it is not enough to simply say “I think X is best”. That is of no help to anyone. Please explain the reasons for your opinion.
