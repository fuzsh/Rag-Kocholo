        "text": "Let’s get down with a SiteGround review.\n\nIf you’re humming and hawing over finding the web hosting provider that’ll rock your socks off in 2024, you’ll be glad you stopped by.\n\nThat’s because SiteGround is like the fusion of a Clydesdale workhorse and a majestic unicorn — it’s a sturdy and reliable platform with style, grace, and creativity out the wazoo.\n\nIt’s highly rated by bloggers, business mavericks, and eCommerce gurus alike, and it’s the web host we’ve used and recommended to our students for years.\n\nYou’ll find out why in just a few minutes.\n\nSo stick around…\n\nYou might even find a sweet discount along the way.\n\nWhat is SiteGround?\n\nCompany Background & Overview\n\nSiteGround (affiliate link) hit the scene in 2004 after a group of Bulgarian schoolmates recognized the need for an easier, faster, and safer web hosting provider.\n\nSince then, SiteGround has exploded with over 600+ employees, 4 office locations, and now hosts over 2 million domains worldwide.\n\nSurprisingly, SiteGround is still privately owned, a rare quality in today’s corporate-cluttered web hosting market.\n\nAs far as services go, SiteGround runs the gamut, offering:\n\nShared hosting plans\n\nCloud hosting plans\n\nWordPress hosting plans\n\nWooCommerce hosting plans\n\nAnd tons of other services, widgets, and tools we’ll cover throughout this SiteGround hosting review.\n\nSiteGround’s Network\n\nSiteground uses modern, ultra-fast data centers in 6 countries around the world:\n\nThe United States\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nGermany\n\nSingapore\n\nAustralia\n\nUndeniably, SiteGround uses some impressive technology – the kind of stuff network administrators rave about at the annual IT barbecue.\n\nSo, let’s get down to the nitty-gritty about SiteGround’s Network and see why it’s so great:\n\nHigh Redundancy and Availability\n\nBlizzard? Thunderstorm? Thanos?\n\nSiteGround is ready for any threat.\n\nYou see, SiteGround uses redundancy routines, and multiple power feeds for all critical network components.\n\nIn other words, it’s tough to bring the network down because all essential systems have back-ups, and their back-ups have back-ups.\n\nThe net result?\n\n99.99% uptime.\n\nGuaranteed.\n\nFast Connectivity and Low Latency\n\nSite speed and reliability are the bones of any well-to-do web hosting service.\n\nSo, SiteGround teamed up with the big guns, Google, as its leading data center partner, recognizing the importance of a fast and stable network.\n\nAnd as a result, the SiteGround network is built with state-of-the-art technology, ensuring plentiful server resources and speedy connections for hosted websites.\n\nGreen-Friendly Hosting\n\nSiteGround is committed to green hosting and sustainability.\n\nAnd because they’ve partnered with Google, any energy consumed by data centers is offset with renewable energy as part of Google’s carbon neutrality mandate.\n\nBelieve it or not, data centers consume massive amounts of energy, resulting in approximately 1% of worldwide electricity use and generating tonnes of greenhouse emissions in the process.\n\nAnd any commitment by web companies to consider their environmental impacts and address them with plans, policies, and programs is a positive note in our books.\n\nCDN Network (With Over 200 Locations Worldwide)\n\nSiteGround uses the Cloudflare Content Delivery Network (CDN), which helps web pages load faster anywhere in the world.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nA CDN caches website content and distributes it to delivery nodes around the globe.\n\nThen, when users visit your website, they’re connected with the closest CDN, and your content is plunked in front of their eyeballs as fast as possible.\n\nAs of January 2022, Cloudflare has over 200 distribution nodes in 100+ countries around the world.\n\nSiteGround Performance: Uptime and Speed\n\nEvery Second Matters: A Primer in Page Speed\n\nWhen it comes to the internet, speed matters.\n\nThink about it:\n\nHow often has even a 1-second delay frustrated you?\n\nWell, you’re not alone because here’s what happens for every extra second a website takes to load:\n\n11% fewer page views\n\n16% decrease in customer satisfaction\n\n7% loss in conversations\n\nAnd the mobile realm is even more vicious:\n\nEvery 1-second delay in page load time on mobile devices impacts conversion rates up to 20%.\n\nReality check:\n\nIf your site loads like cold molasses flowing up a hill, people aren’t going to stick around, no matter how rich and pretty your content is.\n\nNow, when it comes to improving your page load speed, there are a lot of minor tweaks like:\n\nImage compression\n\nReducing redirects\n\nMinimizing bloated plug-in use\n\nImproving server response time\n\nTools, optimization plug-ins, and common sense help with most page load speed issues.\n\nHowever, when it comes to server response time, you’re at the mercy of your web hosting company.\n\nThe solution?\n\nFind a hosting provider with speedy servers.\n\n(Hint, hint..)\n\nSiteGround Server Response Time\n\nServer response time, also known as the Time To First Byte (TTFB), is the amount of time it takes a web browser to receive the first byte of information from a web server.\n\nAnd the faster the response time, the better.\n\nGoogle recommends a TTFB under 200 milliseconds, but the average falls anywhere between 100ms – 500ms.\n\nSo, how does SiteGround stack up when it comes to TTFB?\n\nWell, according to HostScore, the average aggregated response time for SiteGround servers is 174.60ms (based on tests HostScore runs on their sample sites every 4 hours).\n\nLet’s put this benchmark to the test:\n\nWe’ll use dollarGuild as our guinea pig because it uses the SiteGround shared hosting package.\n\nA sample test from Bitcatcha shows:\n\nAfter running several tests, the following results were realized:\n\nOn average, 8 out of 10 locations were clocked under 200ms\n\nAnd any server response time above 200ms did not exceed 265ms\n\nThe verdict?\n\nSiteGround server response time is fast and satisfies Google’s speed recommendations.\n\n99.99% Uptime Guaranteed\n\nSiteGround promises 99.99% uptime on all their hosted websites.\n\nAnd they put their money where their mouths are, promising free service if downtime passes certain limits.\n\nFrom the Service Level Agreement in the SiteGround Terms of Service:\n\nOptimization Tools\n\nSiteGround continually tinkers with optimization.\n\nAnd it’s a curiosity that pays off.\n\nHere are a few of the innovative tools that help keep SiteGround unique, competitive, and lightning-fast:\n\nSuperCacher\n\nSuperCacher is SiteGround’s custom-built caching service that enables static, dynamic, and memory-caching across all hosting plans.\n\nIn other words, with SuperCacher, your website content loads even faster.\n\nHow fast?\n\n50% – 500% faster, according to SiteGround tests.\n\nWhat’s more, SuperCaching also keeps your site running smoothly during massive traffic spikes (up to 100x your normal traffic flow).\n\nSG Optimizer\n\nSG Optimizer is SiteGround’s WordPress optimization plugin.\n\nThe plugin comes battle-ready with:\n\nSuperCacher controls\n\nEnvironmental, frontend, and media optimizations\n\nGzip compression controls\n\nAnd even a speed test tool\n\nNote that this plugin ONLY works on SiteGround hosted websites.\n\nPro tip: If you decide to go with a SiteGround hosting plan, SG Optimizer is a superior (and free) alternative to WP rocket.\n\nUltrafast PHP\n\nAvailable on GrowBig and GoGeek plans, Ultrafast PHP is SiteGround’s in-house, optimized PHP setup.\n\nNow, unless you’re running a website with heavy traffic, Ultrafast PHP won’t make a huge difference in page load times.\n\nHowever, according to internal SiteGround testing, higher-traffic websites experience some dramatic results:\n\n30% increase in website speed\n\n50% decrease in server response times\n\n20%-30% increase in server efficiency\n\n15% decrease in RAM use\n\nCustomer Support\n\nIn 2020, SiteGround had a customer satisfaction rate of 97.7% – and won 2 Stevie Awards for customer service in the process:\n\nAnd let’s face it, in 2020, everyone was home and a little more cranky than usual.\n\nSo, achieving that level of customer satisfaction is a testament to seasoned customer support.\n\nHere’s an inside look at SiteGround’s customer support, detailing what they do right, and also some areas where they could be better.\n\nA Knowledge Base Like the Library of Congress\n\nSiteGround provides an enormous selection of tips and guides in their Knowledge Resources and Tutorials sections.\n\nThese guides are built with the newbie in mind, giving step-by-step instructions with clear screenshots to guide you along.\n\nThere’s no guesswork with these guides.\n\nThey’re clear, detailed, and worth their weight in gold.\n\n24/7 Customer Support: A Great Service in Almost Every Way\n\nWhile knowledge bases are great, sometimes you need a good ol’ fashioned human being to help solve your issues.\n\nThankfully, SiteGround delivers around-the-clock customer support through a ticketing system, phone lines, and live chat.\n\nHowever…\n\nContacting their customer support team isn’t as easy as it once was.\n\nInstead of being a simple button, it’s hidden in a self-serve system.\n\nHere’s how to contact the SiteGround customer support team:\n\n1. In the Client Area dashboard, click on the question mark in the top-right corner and select View Help Center:\n\n2. In the SiteGround Help Center, click Contact Us:\n\n3. Select a category that best fits your problem (Note: there are more categories than what’s displayed here):\n\n4. Describe your issue in the text box:\n\n5. And after you submit your inquiry, you’ll be given a self-help guide, or the option to contact customer support:\n\nIt’s a shame SiteGround buries their award-winning customer support contact channels.\n\nThat said, this customer service rabbit hole isn’t a total deal-breaker.\n\nWeb-savvy people will probably enjoy the self-serve options, but for anyone looking to speak with a representative, they’ll likely find it frustrating the first time around.\n\nThe SiteGround Interface\n\nMost web hosting providers use cPanel, a control panel dashboard, to help manage your website.\n\nNot to rip on cPanel (it does the trick), but SiteGround has taken user-friendliness a step further and developed their own site management dashboards: Client Area and Site Tools.\n\nSiteGround’s Client Area\n\nThe Client Area has a simple layout and is infused with eye-pleasing visuals to bolster creativity.\n\nIt’s not like the bland, boring, and confusing clinical look of other web host dashboards.\n\nNo, this one’s got some character — and the video tutorials to help you navigate SiteGround are a nice onboarding feature:\n\nThe Client Area dashboard also includes a Success Tips and Suggestions feature, providing quick links to particular services you might want to perform with your website like:\n\nBacking up your site\n\nStaging\n\nAdding collaborators and white-label access\n\nTransferring a domain name\n\nThe up-to-date blog posts available on the dashboard are a homerun customer success feature too.\n\nAnd these blog posts aren’t filled with thin content either.\n\nThey deliver everything from helpful SEO guides to in-depth updates about the new and exciting goodies SiteGround has been cooking up.\n\nSiteGround’s Site Tools\n\nSite Tools is an easy-to-use, custom-developed control panel that replaces cPanel.\n\nFrom Site Tools, you can complete routine website tasks like:\n\nCreating emails\n\nAdding FTP accounts\n\nManaging MySQL databases\n\nAccessing and creating one-click backups\n\nCreating git repositories\n\nInstalling content management systems like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and Weebly\n\nAdding shopping carts for your online store\n\nLike the Client Area dashboard, Site Tools is intuitive and straightforward.\n\nEverything is accessed through a sidebar menu, so you don’t get lost searching for tools:\n\nAnd tool descriptions are displayed at the top of each page, so you know precisely what they’re for (and what not to fiddle with if you don’t know what you’re doing):\n\nYou can also pin tools on the dashboard home screen for easy access:\n\nEvery tool in the Site Tools control panel is pre-set to optimal settings, but you’re free to modify them to fit your needs better.\n\nSecurity: SiteGround Has Your Back(ups)\n\nSiteGround doesn’t skimp on security.\n\nIn fact, it’s one of their top priorities.\n\nSeriously:\n\nThe only difference between SiteGround’s secure facilities and the Batcave is a suave English butler and a fancy-rocket car.\n\nLet’s take a look at the various ways SiteGround keeps your website safe.\n\nMulti-Layered Security Protocols\n\nSiteGround keeps everything running tickety-boo with a battalion of security personnel for protecting and monitoring systems, as well as a collection of strategic digital security measures that’ll leave hackers shaking in their little booties.\n\nHere’s just a partial list of the protocols in place:\n\n24/7 security teams monitoring hack alerts\n\nVideo surveillance\n\nRestricted, limited server access for trusted personnel (they even use biometric scanners!)\n\nBulletproof lobbies\n\nPhishing-resistant security keys\n\nAdvanced intrusion detection/prevention systems to scan and block malware and viruses\n\nTwo-step verification login\n\nA custom AI that protects against brute force attacks\n\nModSecurity installation on all shared servers\n\nAuto-updates for WordPress and plugins\n\nTranslation:\n\nUnless Darkseid and The Elite defeat the Justice League and lay siege specifically to the SiteGround network, your website and data are safe and sound.\n\nFree Daily Backups (And On-Demand Backups for Premium Accounts)\n\nSiteGround has got your back, Jack, by offering free daily automatic backups on all hosting plans.\n\nAnd the best part?\n\nIt’s a one-click system.\n\nSiteGround keeps 30 days’ worth of copies on your site, allowing you to roll back and restore in the event of a catastrophic boo-boo or malicious attack.\n\nWhat’s more, with the GrowBig and GoGeek plans, SiteGround includes on-demand backups, which is like having an undo button, but for your entire website.\n\nPros & Cons of SiteGround Hosting\n\nLike every web hosting option on the market, SiteGround has its pros and cons.\n\nHere’s where we feel they stand out and where they fall a little short:\n\nPros\n\nGoogle Cloud for Super-Fast Servers\n\nSiteGround operates on Google Cloud and enjoys all the benefits of its state-of-the-art global network. Not only are their servers fast, but they’re also some of the best in the world.\n\nDaily and On-Demand Website Backups\n\nSiteGround automatically creates daily back-ups of your site so you can quickly restore functionality in the event of something catastrophic. GrowBig and GoGeek plans allow users to create on-demand backups.\n\n24/7 Customer Support: Part 1\n\nCustomer support is a big reason people gravitate to SiteGround. Whether through their knowledge base, ticketing system, or live chat, there’s always an experienced representative there to help.\n\nFree CDN With Every Account\n\nCloudflare CDN comes free with every SiteGround account. With Cloudflare CDN, any part of your website loads faster thanks to their distribution nodes spread across the world.\n\nFree SSL With Every Account\n\nSiteGround provides free Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates with every account. This free SSL certificate is automatically configured and renewed, leaving you with one less hassle to deal with.\n\nUnlimited Bandwidth for Shared Hosting\n\nWith unlimited bandwidth, you’re free to host and grow almost any type of site you want without the limitations of a monthly data transfer cap.\n\n99.99% Guaranteed Uptime\n\nSiteGround promises 99.99% uptime. And if it falls below 99.99%, you’re given a month of hosting for free and an additional 1 month of free hosting for every 1% below 99% uptime.\n\nCons\n\nPricey Month-to-Month Billing\n\nSiteGround pricing is comparable to other web hosting providers. However, if you opt for the month-to-month billing cycle, the prices take a significant jump – about 3 times as much.\n\nFixed Storage Space\n\nSiteGround offers super-fast SSD storage, but that space is limited based on your hosting plan:\n\nStartUp Plan: 10GB of space\n\nGrowBig Plan: 20GB of space\n\nGoGeek Plan: 40GB of space\n\n24/7 Customer Support: Part 2\n\nAlthough SiteGround delivers top-shelf customer support, reaching a representative isn’t as easy as it once was. Instead of a simple button, there are multiple pages you’ll need to click through before prompting live chat or ticketing options.\n\nWhich SiteGround Plan is Right For You?\n\nSiteGround has a web hosting option for just about everyone.\n\nHere’s the scoop on what they offer:\n\nShared and cloud hosting plans\n\nWooCommerce hosting plans\n\nAnd managed WordPress hosting plans\n\nSee a hosting solution that tickles your fancy?\n\nThen let’s break these down:\n\nSiteGround Shared Hosting: An Overview\n\nShared hosting plans mean that you’re sharing server resources with other websites.\n\nIn other words, you don’t have a dedicated server.\n\nAs a result, shared hosting plans are recommended for websites that don’t expect heavy traffic loads, like personal or smaller business websites and blogs.\n\nShared Hosting Plans: Your 3 Options\n\nSiteGround offers 3 types of shared hosting plans:\n\n1. A General Plan (AKA the Fast and Basic Web Hosting plan): a barebones host plan without any content management system or eCommerce platform installed\n\n2. A Managed WordPress Hosting Plan: a shared hosting plan with WordPress and the SG Optimizer plugin pre-installed\n\n3. A Managed WooCommerce Hosting Plan: a shared hosting plan with WordPress and WooCommerce pre-installed\n\nShared Hosting Plans: Pricing\n\nEach of SiteGround’s 3 shared hosting plans (listed above) has 3 pricing tiers:\n\nStartUp\n\nGrowBig\n\nGoGeek\n\nLet’s break them down:\n\n1. StartUp\n\nPricing: $14.99/month or $4.99/month when billed annually\n\nIdeal for low-traffic websites with 10,000 monthly visitors or less.\n\nStartUp includes:\n\n10 GB of space\n\nUnmetered bandwidth\n\nFree WordPress installation\n\nFree WordPress migrator\n\nAutomatic WordPress Updates\n\nLet’s Encrypt SSL\n\nCloudflare CDN\n\nFree email\n\nSiteGround’s SuperCacher tool\n\nUnlimited databases\n\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\n2. GrowBig\n\nPricing: $24.99/month or $7.99/month when billed annually.\n\nGrowBig is recommended for low-traffic websites with around 25,000 monthly visitors or less.\n\nGrowBig includes everything from the StartUp plan plus:\n\nOn-demand backups\n\nUltrafast PHP\n\nWordPress staging\n\nCollaborator login\n\n3. GoGeek\n\nPricing: $39.99/month or $14.99/month when billed annually.\n\nRecommended for websites with around 100,000 monthly visitors or less.\n\nGrowBig includes everything from the StartUp and GrowBig plans plus:\n\nWhite-label access\n\nMore server resources\n\nPriority customer support\n\nSiteGround Cloud Hosting: An Overview\n\nCloud hosting is recommended for websites that generate large amounts of traffic and need the extra firepower from dedicated servers on the cloud.\n\nBut, unless you have an existing high-traffic blog/online business or plan on scaling your website extremely quickly, it’s not likely you’ll need the cloud hosting plan.\n\nThat said, let’s review the options and pricing:\n\nShared Cloud Hosting Plans: Options and Pricing\n\n1. Jump Start\n\nPricing: $100.00/month\n\nIncludes:\n\n4 CPU cores\n\n8GB memory\n\n40GB SSD space\n\n5TB of data transfer\n\n2. Business\n\nPricing: $200.00/month\n\nIncludes:\n\n8 CPU cores\n\n12GB memory\n\n40GB SSD space\n\n5TB of data transfer\n\n3.

Configure Your Own\n\nPrice: $100.00 – $2090.00/month\n\nIncludes:\n\n4 – 33 CPU cores\n\n8GB – 130GB memory\n\n40GB – 1TB SSD space\n\n5 TB of data transfer\n\nThe Final Review on SiteGround Hosting\n\nSiteGround is fast, friendly, and constantly improving its services.\n\nReally, there are only 3 red marks against SiteGround:\n\nPricing: it’s not as cheap as other web hosts\n\nReaching a customer service rep: it’s a more complicated process than it was before\n\nLimited Storage: a cap on storage space is kind of a drag, especially since you’d have to upgrade your hosting plan if you want more space.\n\nDespite all that, SiteGround is still an over-delivering innovator in the web hosting industry.\n\nSure, it might not be as cheap as other web hosts.\n\nBut the extra goodies SiteGround delivers, like a free SSL, CDN, caching tool, and WordPress optimization plugin, are built into that monthly cost.\n\nWhat’s more, the state-of-the-art technology used in their network, and award-winning customer support, emphasize the commitment to speed, quality, and customer success SiteGround promises.\n\nNot too shabby, SiteGround.\n\nDiscounts and Deals for SiteGround Hosting\n\nI’m glad you made it this far!\n\nKeeping in the spirit of giving away freebies, we’ve got a special one for all Smart Blogger readers:\n\nA SiteGround coupon for up to 62% off for the Smart Blogger community (affiliate link).\n\nSiteGround Comparison\n\nIs SiteGround Good for a WordPress Website?\n\nYes!\n\nIn fact, SiteGround is WordPress recommended.\n\nDoes SiteGround Support WooCommerce?\n\nYup.\n\nNot only does SiteGround support WooCommerce, but it also has a hosting plan specifically for it.\n\nIs SiteGround Better than GoDaddy?\n\nA few years ago, they might have been comparable, but SiteGround leveled up in a big way.\n\nWith the adoption of the Google Cloud infrastructure and different performance-enhancing tweaks like ultra-fast PHP, SiteGround is a superior choice to GoDaddy.\n\nAlso, SiteGround’s Client Area and Site Tools dashboard are straightforward to navigate, unlike the confusing labyrinth that GoDaddy uses.\n\nIs SiteGround Better than Bluehost?\n\nBlueHost is owned by web hosting mega-giant, EIG, a company known for purchasing hosting companies and reducing the level of quality.\n\nHaving said that, Bluehost’s shared plans are cheaper and offer unlimited space.\n\nSiteGround has a better network (in terms of uptime and speed) and is a privately-owned company, meaning they have the flexibility to innovate as they see fit.\n\nIt ultimately comes down to superior quality (SiteGround) versus better pricing (Bluehost)\n\nIs SiteGround Better than HostGator?\n\nAlthough HostGator is cheaper, SiteGround is faster, more reliable, more secure, and has far better support.\n\nUnfortunately, HostGator is also owned by EIG.\n\nBeyond the SiteGround Review: Is It The Best Web Hosting for You?\n\nWhether you’re an experienced webmaster or a newbie ready to get their feet wet, you’ll find something to love about SiteGround.\n\nIt isn’t perfect (no web host is), but SiteGround fares far better than the competition.\n\nSo, if you’re looking for a web host with the right fusion of power, simplicity, and a pinch of creative magic, we suggest you take SiteGround for a spin."
