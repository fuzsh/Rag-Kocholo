        "text": "If you’re looking for a quick answer, I want to put this upfront:\n\nDo not buy hosting from HostGator, Bluehost or SiteGround.\n\nDo take time to learn about how hosting works so you can select what’s best for your business.\n\nDo buy Cloudways’ Vultr High Frequency VPS hosting if it’s appropriate for your business.\n\nDo buy your domain and email hosting directly from Google Domains and Google Workspaces.\n\nThese are not affiliate links, just concise recommendations for people who don’t want to scroll to find these key points.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s get on with the article.\n\nThe Problem with Web Hosting Reviews\n\nYou can spend hours consuming articles and videos about the best website hosts.\n\nSadly, these articles and videos are a complete waste of time. They’re exercises in affiliate marketing.\n\nAffiliate marketers check to see what hosts offer the best commission payouts (Bluehost and SiteGround). Then they create extremely long articles or in depth YouTube tutorials with lots of structured content. Google loves length, thoroughness, structure, backlinks, and consistent information. Therefore… the affiliate marketers’ lists rank.\n\nThey rank despite actively hurting small business owners who are setting up a site and trying to understand this space. Business owners end up with super slow web hosting that doesn’t meet their needs, or they end up overpaying for hosting services.\n\nIf you’d like to explore this point further, continue reading this section. If you accept what I’m saying already, then just skip to the next section where I talk about different types of website hosts.\n\nWhy you should not trust reviews on Google for “best WordPress hosts”\n\nWhen I google “best wordpress hosts” in the US, the top 3 search results are as follows:\n\nThemeisle: 2023’s Best WordPress Hosting Companies Compared (Manually Tested)\n\nWPBeginner: How to Choose the Best WordPress Hosting in 2023 (Compared)\n\nCNET: Best WordPress Hosting of 2023\n\nLet’s talk about these one by one, because they each have something to show you.\n\nTakeaways from Themeisle\n\nScroll down the page a bit and you’ll see a chart that shows the differences between hosts.\n\nThemisle’s affiliates look pretty good. You can see that SiteGround $2.99 pricing is much better than Flywheel’s $13 hosting. More uptime and more traffic. It’s a clear winner, right?\n\nSiteGround is not $2.99/month for very long. After your promotional period, prices will be $15/month.\n\nHosting companies know that you’ll likely stick with the same host for a very long time because it’s a pain to switch. So, they get you with a cheap promotional price, and then earn their money back and a lot more once their real price sets in.\n\nTakeaways from WPBeginner\n\nClick on the “reader disclosure”, the text in 8 point font next to the publication metadata that we’re all trained to scan past. Hover over it.\n\nNow you see it: “if you click on some of our links, then we may earn a commission”.\n\nI’d like to think that no one would sell junk to earn a commission, but a ton of BS in this industry has changed my view on this.\n\nWPBeginner proceeds to advertise Bluehost, SiteGround, DreamHost, Hostinger, and HostGator. Please visit any forum of actual web developers and they’ll tell you that these are awful hosts.\n\nTakeaways from CNET\n\nCNET’s article is pretty straightforward. After the author names, it starts right off with a list of the 5 hosts they’re selling. Next to each host name is an icon and a button that says “See at [host name]”.\n\nClick on the first button presented, “See at SiteGround”, and we immediately see an affiliate code (afcode) in the URL: https://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=5dc3624833ba7a9eb4a214533cc11090&subid=cn-5861f26280bc43f8b3d30023c4df9baa-dtp\n\nWeb hosting reviews manipulate data\n\nWhat you need to know is that hosting companies skew their results, their data tables, their reviews, and their recommendations to promote their affiliates.\n\nWhat Is Website Hosting?\n\nWebsite hosting is a service that allows people and organizations to make their websites accessible on the Internet. When a website is hosted, it is stored on a server connected to the internet.\n\nWhat’s a server?\n\nA server is a high-performance computer that stores your data, connects to the Internet, and allows people to access your website from any device connected to the Internet 24/7.\n\nA server has a fast processor and lots of memory so that it can handle requests from thousands of people every day on your website.\n\nServers include lots of hard drives to accommodate everything on your website (and their other customers’ sites). All these drives are stored on racks and cooled by fans running 24/7.\n\nWho runs cloud servers?\n\nTwo thirds of the world’s servers are managed by one of the big three tech companies offering cloud computing: Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.\n\nFor example, even if you buy web hosting from Bluehost or SiteGround, your servers are actually managed by Google.\n\nThis is one reason why there are not actually thousands of Internet hosts to sift through when you’re buying hosting any more than there are millions of apples to sift through when picking up an apple at the grocery store.\n\nWhat do I get when I buy web hosting?\n\nThe tech company hosting your website employs people whose job it is to make sure these servers never (or almost never) go down.\n\nTo keep your data safe, they write sophisticated code to thwart the 10 million cyber attacks hitting them every day. They constantly update their firewalls, antivirus software, patches, access control, and encryption\n\nTo protect against power outages, they use power generators, uninterruptible power supplies, backup batteries, and redundant power systems.\n\nTo protect against Internet interruptions, they use redundant internet connections, load balancing, caching, and disaster recovery systems.\n\nTo backup your data, they use multiple redundancies in different locations. This is why most people trust their most precious memories to iCloud (which is actually run on Google Cloud servers).\n\nTypes of Website Hosting Services\n\nThere are three major types of hosting services: shared hosting, VPS hosting, and dedicated hosting.\n\nShared hosting\n\nWith a shared host, your website is hosted on a server with hundreds of other websites relying on the same limited resources.\n\nShared hosting works for micro businesses with a few hundred visitors per month who use a website to supplement their business but who are not dependent on their website for anything critical to their mission.\n\nLet’s talk about a few issues with this shared hosting that are often misunderstood.\n\n99.9% uptime still can mean hours a year of outages\n\nIf you or one of the other sites have a spike in web traffic, your server may not be big enough to accommodate everyone. This will lead to a temporary server crash.\n\nAs you might expect, shared hosting is the cheapest form of web hosting. If you think your brand or sales would be hurt by outages, avoid shared hosting.\n\nMost shared hosts promote 99.9% uptime. There are 8,760 hours in a year. So 0.1% of downtime is about 9 hours of outages a year.\n\nIn addition, many shared hosting providers will do scheduled server maintenance , leaving your website down for hours at a time. This, conveniently,is rarely covered in their uptime guarantee.\n\n“Unmetered bandwidth” is not “unmonitored usage”\n\nMost shared hosting plans advertise “unmetered bandwidth”. Check out their Terms of Service and you’ll see language like HostGator’s, stating that you’re not allowed to “exceed 25% or more of system resources for longer than 90 seconds”.\n\nA shared host that advertises “unmetered bandwidth” lures businesses in by promising low prices with no limits on your website traffic. But they’ll still monitor resource usage. If your site consumes too many resources, they’ll kick you off the server or force you to upgrade your plan.\n\nShared hosting can result in lost customers and bad SEO\n\nThe main deficit that plagues businesses with shared hosting every day is just shitty, slow service.\n\nShared hosts rarely advertise their RAM, processor, or CPU performance. Instead, they cover up specs with vague terms. For example, instead of sharing a number, Bluehost lists its CPU Performance as “Standard”.\n\nA website that takes 10 seconds to load on a shared hosting site will lose about 2/3s of its potential website visitors. Your would-be visitors will click onto a link to your website, wait 3-5 seconds, and click away because modern users don’t typically wait more than 3 seconds for a page to load.\n\nWorse, your long term SEO rankings will suffer. Google does not rank sites well if they take more than 3 seconds for a page to load.\n\nYou’re not going to pay $3/month for long\n\nShared servers make their money with eye popping low prices. After their promotional period or introductory offer, your $3/month plan will start costing you $13/month.\n\nThis probably isn’t what you had in mind when you saw the YouTube video on the “best web hosts”.\n\nYou can get vastly superior performance for less money. And that brings us to the next type of web hosting service…\n\nVPS hosting\n\nVPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting is when a website is hosted on a virtual server that is isolated from other websites. Basically, your web hosts partitions a section of their server just for your website.\n\nYou can think of a shared server as a public park, and a VPS as your own private yard with a fence around it.\n\nWith a VPS server, if another website on the same server has a spike in traffic, you won’t be affected.\n\nIf you determine that you need more SSD storage or bandwidth, then you can upgrade your VPS plan.\n\nVPS hosting performs really well\n\nIn real world experience, pages on websites with a VPS load in one or two seconds.\n\nIf you have a webpage that takes longer to load, you probably have some terrible code or a few 5 mb uncompressed images. (HD images should only weigh 300kb.) In that case, you should run some diagnostics on GTmetrix and/or get in touch with a WordPress specialist to speed up your site.\n\nVPS hosts are generally transparent\n\nVSP hosts are rarely marred by the BS that shared hosts try to pull.\n\nThey typically give you a number for your bandwidth, something like 1 tb (terabyte), so you know exactly what website traffic volume your site can handle.\n\nThey don’t advertise misleading uptime promises.\n\nThey tell you exactly how much SSD storage you have available, usually something like 20 gb. It’s a number you won’t outgrow right away, forcing you into a higher priced plan.\n\nImportantly, they tell you all about the RAM and the processor of the server, and other technical information about any management services provided.\n\nTechnical details are important. It’s like telling you that your car will have 500 horsepower rather than writing “standard” and hiding the fact that it’s only 100 horsepower.\n\nCloudways is a good VPS option\n\nVisit any SEO forum, subreddit, or Facebook Group, and you’ll see SEO experts talking amongst themselves, constantly recommending Cloudways.\n\nCloudways is an example of a VPS host, even though they rarely use that language. Cloudways offers $10/month VPS hosting, which is vastly superior to any shared hosting plan.\n\nIf you’re in a hurry to get a host, I don’t think you’ll go wrong with this option.\n\nDedicated hosting\n\nDedicated hosting is when your website is hosted on its own physical server. The hosting company leases you the server, and you have complete control over how the server is used.\n\nWith a dedicated server, you’re responsible for configuring, maintaining and managing the server. The host you lease the server from should monitor, secure and back up the server regularly for you, and they should provide additional tools to help you optimize your website performance.\n\nThe cost of a dedicated server will depend on the specs of the server – the RAM, storage, and processing power – as well as the management support your host provides.\n\nWho should use dedicated hosting?\n\nOne reason to get a dedicated server is if you have specific requirements for your server configuration or management, and it’s easier to set up the configuration you want with a dedicated server than with a VPS.\n\nFor most small businesses who want a really fast site, a VPS is a great choice. If you notice that your site isn’t loading super fast, you could talk to your managed host to see what to do to improve it. They can likely help you improve it in a number of ways before you’ll ever need to upgrade to a dedicated server.\n\nMost likely a dedicated server will only make sense if you’re offering a SaaS or e-commerce service, or you’re a large company with very high traffic or resource demand. If this is the case, you might upgrade from a VPS to a dedicated server in order to better control your site’s performance. Plus, your company likely already has the technical expertise in house to manage your own server.\n\nManaged Hosting and Agency Hosting\n\nShared servers, virtual private servers, and dedicated servers are all (obviously) types of servers. Regardless of the type of server you choose, now you need to decide who is going to set it up and manage it.\n\nWill your company manage it with a technical person on your team? This is called “unmanaged hosting”.\n\nWill your company outsource management to a company like Cloudways? This is called “managed hosting”.\n\nWill your company pay your marketing agency to manage your site? (Somehow, no one seems to have named this, but let’s call it “agency hosting”.)\n\nTypes of managed hosting\n\nYou can buy managed hosting regardless of whether you choose to host on a shared server, VPS, or dedicated server.\n\nYou can buy managed hosted plans for sites built in WordPress, Laravel, Django, or Ruby on Rails.\n\nWhat does hosting management involve?\n\nThere’s some work involved in hosting a website.\n\nYou need to manage your server’s resources to prevent overloading the server.\n\nYou need to keep your website security and software up to date to prevent attacks on the software your site uses.\n\nYou need to back up your data regularly in case something goes wrong and you need to revert to a previous version.\n\nFor best performance, you’ll want to use the latest tools to optimize your website speed at least once a year.\n\nUnmanaged vs Managed vs Agency Hosting\n\nAdvantages of unmanaged hosting\n\nIn terms of server resources, unmanaged hosting can be 3 times cheaper than managed hosting.\n\nIf you have tens of thousands of visitors per month consuming large amounts of data on your website, then you would have a sizable monthly server cost with managed hosting. Your managed monthly server bill could be $1,000/month or even higher.\n\nIn this case, you can save a lot by managing your own server. In addition, you can squeeze the absolute best performance from your server since you’ll have full access to manage it on your own.\n\nAdvantages of managed hosting\n\nManaged hosting can virtually eliminate server management tasks for a low monthly fee.\n\nIf you’re a small business with 1,000 website visitors per month, the difference between paying $12/month for managed hosting and $3/month for unmanaged hosting is not going to justify the expense of hiring an IT person to manage your server.\n\nEven if you have 10,000 visitors per month, you can likely get a good $30/month managed hosting plan (depending on how many resources each visitor consumes on your site). That’s a solid deal.\n\nFor most small businesses, managed hosting is the way to go.\n\nAdvantages of agency hosting\n\nHaving your agency or web developer host your site is not that different from managed hosting. You should enjoy the same benefits of a seamless experience with good uptime and fast load speeds without having to do any work on web hosting each month.\n\nHowever, the cost usually is horrible, and you’re getting the same level of service as you would if you paid for your own managed hosting plan on a site like Cloudways.\n\nFrom networking with other agency owners, I can tell you that generally, all your agency will do is upgrade your plan (and charge you more) when they get an email from their managed hosting provider that says “you’ve reached 90% capacity on your plan”.\n\nSadly, a lot of businesses pay agencies $100/month for managed plans that they could own themselves for $12-30/month.\n\nSome agencies charge a sensible price for hosting (perhaps a 50% upcharge), but others take advantage of their client relationships to gauge on hosting – a service where they rarely add any value. In some cases, agencies have actually put into their contracts that you must host with them for a set period of time.\n\nIf you pay your web developer to host your site, I recommend that you set up an instance of your website on Cloudways and see what your monthly costs will be to run your site on a managed service that you pay for directly.\n\nWho Should Buy Managed Hosting?\n\nYou can get a really good idea about whether you want managed hosting or unmanaged hosting by comparing the cloud hosting prices for Cloudways (a popular managed web host) to the cloud hosting prices for Google Cloud (a popular unmanaged web host).\n\nIf you’re a small business with normal web traffic\n\nThe average small business has just 400 website visitors per month. Anyone with 5,000 visitors or less is almost certainly going to be best off with managed hosting.\n\nYou can buy the least expensive plan on Cloudways – the Digital Ocean standard plan at the lowest price tier, currently $10/month. Right now this plan comes with:\n\n1 gb of RAM\n\n1 core processor\n\n25 gb of storage\n\n1 tb of bandwidth\n\nNone of the big names referenced on popular “best web hosting” web pages is going to give you better value. Bluehost, HostGator, SiteGound and others don’t even list their specs like this.\n\nThere are other niche sites similar to Cloudways. Nestify, for example, offers a similar quality plan for $12/month powered by AWS. But, you won’t find these on the “best web hosts” lists created by affiliate marketers. Cloudways’s affiliate program and Nestify’s affiliate program both offer commissions, but they don’t pay out as much as Bluehost.\n\nIf you’re a small business with 10,000+ website visitors per month\n\nIf you’re getting 10,000 visitors per month, then you’re probably prioritizing SEO and paying for the best performance.\n\nIn this case, you might have graduated to a $50/month managed web hosting plan. At this point, you could consider switching to unmanaged hosting on a service like AWS or Google Cloud.\n\nDo you have someone on your team who has the ability to configure your cloud, the expertise to install CPanel or Plesk, the time to make regular updates, and the availability to respond to emergencies?\n\nIf so, you could buy unmanaged hosting and then have your technical team member manage hosting for you.\n\nBut, is it worth paying someone $500 or $1,000/year to manage your plan just so you can save $600/year?\n\nIt’s probably only worth your time if you have a great technical resource who is already a close part of your team. Otherwise, you’ll probably want to wait until you grow to 100,000 visitors per month.\n\nIf you’re a CTO\n\nDo you want to be on call 24/7 in case of a server issue?\n\nMost CTOs don’t want that responsibility. So they’d rather pay for managed hosting just to automate backups and security updates.\n\nIf you’re an agency\n\nMost agencies that offer hosting simply buy an agency managed hosting plan from a site like Cloudways. Then they resell hosting to their clients at a 50% to 200% markup.\n\nThis reduces your responsibility and frees you up to concentrate on meeting new clients and creating assets for your clients – likely, more valuable uses of your time.\n\nIf you’re a tech company\n\nTech companies are probably not reading this article. Tech companies will often choose unmanaged hosting so that they have full access to their server.\n\nOne of the downsides to managed hosting is that the hosting platform will lock off controls to prevent customers from making any mistakes. This protection is more of an annoyance than a benefit to people who want full access to optimize their own server.\n\nManaged Hosting Options\n\nSEO experts prioritize site speed, which has the power to significantly boost a website’s ranking. This is why I recommend deferring to SEO specialists’ expertise in choosing a website host.\n\nCloudways is by far the most popular managed host among SEO experts\n\nSEO Site Signals Lab is a popular SEO community with 70,000 members. It’s a great place to read comments and learn about professionals’ experience with various hosting platforms.\n\nTake a look at this poll from the group:\n\nWhat sets Cloudways apart is that it lets you choose your hosting provider among the industry’s best hosts:\n\nDigital Ocean\n\nVultr\n\nLinode\n\nAWS\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\nVultr High Performance is the best option on Cloudways\n\nAmong these choices, DigitalOcean Standard is the least expensive. It starts at just $10/month for 25 gb of SSD space.\n\nHowever, for just $3 more, you can upgrade to the option that SEO experts swear by: Vultr High Frequency. This option is available starting at just $13/month for 32 gb of space. It can easily double the website speed that you can achieve with DigitalOcean Standard.\n\nHogan Chua conducted some tests on each of the popular configurations on Cloudways and found that AWS and Vultr High Frequency loaded pages in less than a second that other options took 1.5 to 2.5 seconds to load. (This isn’t trivial. Site speed is a major ranking factor in Google search results.)\n\nWhile Vultr starts at $13/month, AWS starts at $36/month. So, your best bang for buck is definitely Vultr.\n\nIf you’re a normal small business, 25 or 32 gb are both more than your website will need until you publish 1,000 blog posts loaded with pictures.\n\nBoth options offer 1 terabyte of bandwidth. Very likely, you won’t need to upgrade from this until your business is quite successful.\n\nA2 Hosting has a growing reputation\n\nAfter Cloudways, the next most popular website hosting provider among SEO experts is A2 Hosting.\n\nYou can get every type of hosting with A2.\n\nAs of 2023, pricing for one year of hosting, without a longer commitment, and after the promotional period, starts as follows:\n\nShared hosting ($11/month)\n\nVPS hosting ($50/month)\n\nDedicated hosting ($250/month)\n\nSiteGround sucks\n\nSiteGround used to be the #1 name in the independent managed hosting space.\n\nThen in 2020 they increased their prices, reduced customer service, removed information about their pricing, and cut their services to significantly less than what their competitors offer and they originally advertised.\n\n(If you sense bitterness here, trust your instincts.)\n\nIf you see positive reviews about SiteGround, there’s a good chance these were published before 2020, or they’re from people using affiliate links.\n\nToday, SiteGround’s WordPress “startup” plan costs $15/month and gives you substantially less service than Cloudways.\n\nYou’ll get 10 gb of storage space instead of 25 gb. When your site grows past 10 gb, SiteGround will send you a warning letter that they’ll shut off your service in 3 days unless you upgrade your plan. Now you can start paying them $25/month.\n\nYou’re limited to roughly 10,000 monthly visitors. Have a good month, and you’ll also need to “upgrade”.\n\nEven when you move to SiteGround’s $25/month plan, you won’t get as much storage as Cloudways’ $10/month plan.\n\nWe don’t know what bandwidth SiteGround allows, because they don’t list it on their pricing page.\n\nBluehost and HostGator are only popular with newbies\n\nNewfold Digital, formerly Endurance International Group, owns both Bluehost and HostGator.\n\nMention Bluehost or HostGator on a web development or SEO forum, and everyone will laugh, trash EIG, and tell you not to use these hosts.\n\nOnce you use Bluehost or HostGator, and notice your site speed, and notice the poor customer service, and notice other issues… you’ll probably want to leave too.\n\nBluehost is bad\n\nIf you want to read screenshot after screenshot showing customers facing horrible customer service, you can.\n\nIf you want to read 6,000 words meticulously documenting everything wrong with Bluehost, you can.\n\nHostGator is the worst\n\nIf you want to destroy your SEO, publish your site on HostGator and double your page load times.\n\nDomain and Email Providers\n\nI recommend buying domains on Google Domains and setting up your business email with Google Workspaces.\n\nWith this approach, you can buy your domain directly on domains.google.com. Then you can point your MX records to Google Workspaces for your email and point your DNS records to Cloudways or whatever host you choose for your website.\n\nBuy domains from Google Domains\n\nA domain registrar provides a simple service. You’re buying domain management tools, privacy, and customer support. Ideally, you want an intuitive interface that makes it easy to set up what you need.\n\nI buy from Google Domains based on their pricing advantage, 24/7 chat and phone support, and easy integration with Google Workspaces. You can usually buy a domain for $12 and renew it yearly with privacy protection for $12/year.\n\nAll domain registrars have the same names available. If you need any help choosing a domain name, check out my article on best practices and common mistakes.\n\nFree WHOIS privacy protection\n\nGoogle Domains offers free WHOIS privacy, which will prevent a barrage of junk mail and email at no extra cost. This is a significant feature that many other hosts, like Bluehost and HostGator, do not offer for free.\n\nCheaper renewal cost\n\nGoogle Domains also has the industry’s leading renewal cost at just $12/year. Other big names like NameCheap and Domain.com charge $14/year, while DreamHost and GoDaddy charge $18/year and $20/year respectively.\n\nThe first year price on Google Domains is higher than other domain providers. But, if you plan to keep your domain for more than a year, you’ll be glad that you paid $12 to register your domain on Google rather than $3 to register on GoDaddy since now your annual renewal cost will be $8/year cheaper.\n\nSet up email with Google Workspaces\n\nThe biggest competitors to Google Workspaces are Zoho and Microsoft 365. All of them have similar features and pricing ($4-6/user/month).\n\nI don’t have opinions about which is better between Google, Zoho or Microsoft 365. So, if you’re looking for advice here, I suggest referring to Reddit or comments in your favorite business group or forum.\n\nMicrosoft 365 vs Google Workspace – The Ultimate Comparison\n\nAs someone who’s used Google (and not either of the other two platforms) I will share insights as to why I use and recommend Google.\n\nEasy to use\n\nGmail (Google email) and Google Workspaces (formerly G Suite) are both easy to use. This can boost productivity for your whole team. Google software has a surprising number of advanced features built in that many people don’t even realize, and all their software is extremely fast and intuitive. (One caveat here is that some team members may be more used to Microsoft 365. So, I suggest asking your team which suite they prefer.)\n\nContinuing development\n\nGoogle Workspaces accounts for 60% of the US office suite technology market. So they have more revenue to invest into making their services better for customers.\n\nCustomer support\n\nGoogle has 24/7 customer support that’s easy to access and fairly comprehensive in scope. You can chat with an agent anytime you have questions. Of course, the support team is offshore but they’re efficient in my experience.\n\nCompetitive pricing\n\nPricing for Google Workspaces offers top value in the industry. Then you can buy Google Workspaces for $6/user/month.\n\nWorkspace integration\n\nNowadays, work email is strongly tied to the documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and other assets we create at work.\n\nYour work email from Google comes with a free suite of office software including Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Drive, and Google Meet.\n\nWith everything tied together, you don’t need to waste any time logging into multiple services, syncing files, or attaching materials to emails.\n\nEasy to leave\n\nGoogle makes it easy to securely handle an employee exit and archive your company data should you ever wish to switch to another service.\n\nAvoid buying domains and workspaces from a reseller\n\nYou have more control over your services when you buy directly. Most of the time, Google ultimately provides these services; other businesses like Squarespace are simply resellers.\n\nYou gain a number of advantages by purchasing directly from Google.\n\nYou make it easier to get help from Google Support.\n\nYou protect yourself from future reseller price increases.\n\nYou retain the ability to easily switch your web hosting provider. If you need to switch hosts, there’s less work and fewer artificial barriers like waiting periods.\n\nYou also protect yourself from any possible security vulnerabilities that could be introduced by a reseller.\n\nA common scenario I’ve encountered is a small business who has bought a plan from Wix or Squarespace and opted to add Google Workspaces while they were checking out. At some point, their company’s needs outgrew these services and they want to switch. Unfortunately, the reseller has done all they can to make this a pain. You can avoid this pain by simply buying your domain from Google Domains and your Google Workspace from Google Workspaces.\n\nDon’t let an agency buy your domain\n\n2DogsDesign shares some valuable insights based on the author’s experience working with clients who have had their sites held hostage by rogue developers or marketing agencies. Based on her advice, I would suggest the following:\n\nCreate your own account with a domain registrar like Google Domains. Buy your own domain names. To keep your account secure, use AnyDesk to allow a developer to make updates remotely directly on your computer without ever sharing your registrar password.\n\nCreate your own hosting account in your name. Do the same for any SaaS platform like Webflow or Squarespace that provides hosting. Then give access to your developer on an as-needed basis.\n\nHire reputable developers. You can find established and reliable developers on TopTal. Clarity never hurts, so include a note in your web development contract that establishes your ownership of your domain and web hosting account.\n\nEnsure you have access to the domain registrar, hosting account, and any associated software before your website launches. Make sure you have all your passwords stored on your computer before you pay your final invoice to your developer.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs you can see, I recommend buying directly from Google Domains and Google Workspaces, then setting up hosting using Cloudways’ Vultr High Frequency VPS hosting. This is my article, so I wanted to make one clear recommendation for you.\n\nIf you’re curious to learn more about hosting, look for the top performers in your niche. Save those websites to a document. Then paste the URLs one by one into WebHostingSecretRevealed.net.\n\nThis neat little tool will tell you each website’s hosting provider, website host (via the nameservers), and the technology the website uses. Conveniently, you can see all this detail in one place.\n\nI checked the output for one of my clients’ websites and it was accurate.\n\nTry putting the best sites in your niche into the tool and see what comes up!\n\nKeep in mind, not all of the best companies in your industry necessarily have the best tech stack. (Tech isn’t always an organization’s strong suit.) Also, keep in mind that websites are often built with infrastructure that was good at the time they were developed, not necessarily the infrastructure a developer would choose today.\n\nStill, WebHostingSecretRevealed.net will help you explore what’s working for leaders in your industry.\n\nTake what you learn and discuss with others in developer forums or SEO forums like SEO Signals Lab to figure out the best tech stack for your firm.\n\nIf you’d like any personalized advice, feel free to schedule a time to talk on my calendar."
