        "text": "The demand for the services of hosting companies NOT owned by the Endurance International Group, EIG (now Newfold Digital) is rising.\n\nUsually, as a professional in the hosting business, I took interest in this rising trend and decided to investigate further — after all, this is my business; that is what I stay online day and night doing (so that you don’t have to do the nasty, dirty jobs yourself).\n\nThis is also what I’ll be doing here today.\n\nFor your sake, I have gone out of my way to research the reason why hosting options powered by the EIG are not much loved in the hosting world today.\n\nAs a wrap-up, I provide 5 smart non-Newfold Digital hosting options that you can, alternatively, host your site with.\n\nIf you’re in a hurry, here’s a smart summary of the best Non-EIG/Newfold Digital hosting companies today:\n\nA2 Web Hosting.\n\nSiteGround Hosting.\n\nDream Host.\n\nInMotion Hosting.\n\nLiquidWeb Hosting.\n\nPlease, kindly note that these links open to the respective hosting companies, directly.\n\nWhat Is Newfold Digital?\n\nNewfold Digital is a large hosting corporation, founded in 1997 with headquarters in Burlington, Massachusetts.\n\nFormerly known as BizLand and later as The Endurance International Group (EIG), the company has a simple — yet effective business model that has seen it buy other brands up, amass them together, and grown everything into the impressive giant it is today.\n\nThis business model involves the buying and acquisition of companies in the hosting, domain management, search, social media and email marketing niches.\n\nThe acquired brands, under this style, are absorbed into the holding of the parent company, EIG (now Newfold Digital).\n\nThis means that management changes — and usually, the IT infrastructure of such companies is moved to India — irrespective of where they were hitherto situated.\n\nHowever, the acquired companies and brands continue to operate under their earlier known names and identities.\n\nEssentially thus, what changes for a company when EIG acquires it is its management and the relocation of its IT infrastructure.\n\nEIG, on its own end, explains the rationale for this business move thus: “Our mission is as simple as it is aspirational: to bring together technology, people, products, and data to create solutions that help small businesses succeed”.\n\nWhy Do Many Webmasters Hate The Newfold Digital (Formerly EIG) Hosting Options With A Passion So Rare?\n\nThe quest for hosting companies or options not owned by Newfold Digital is huge — and growing by the day.\n\nThis growing distraught on the EIG brands has seen non-EIG hosting companies take pains to clear the air that they are still very independent and as a matter of fact, are privately owned (read: not Newfold Digital owned or controlled).\n\nHowever, it is important to address a very important issue at this point: why is the Newfold Digital brand hated this much by webmasters, bloggers, and hosting professionals?\n\nThe reason is simple; the answer is not far-fetched.\n\nThe ‘conglomerate’, over the years, has mastered the act of acquiring smaller brands and companies, merging them with the larger Newfold family and ruining them completely, in the process.\n\nIn defense of Newfold though, the ‘conglomerate’ does not go out of its way to ruin these hitherto awesome companies: rather, it is the manner in which the companies are run after Newfold’s acquisition that sees customers and the rest of the world (read: non-Newfold folks) complaining.\n\nNow, how are companies run when they become part of the EIG family?\n\nIt’s fairly simple — at least, on surface value: first, such a company’s IT infrastructure is moved to India where the conglomerate maintains an impressive presence.\n\nThe staff may be maintained — together with the management.\n\nHowever, the overall philosophy and direction of such a company significantly change: the focus is strictly on productivity and profit and generally not on offering the best possible service that can be got!\n\nIt is this shift in philosophy (when Newfold takes over a company) that makes webmasters, bloggers, and other professionals have a general dislike for Newfold Digital-controlled brands.\n\nIt is also this dislike that has made you, today, seek out the very best hosting companies that are not Newfold owned or controlled.\n\nWithout much ado thus, let’s get to business.\n\nTop 5 Best Hosting Companies NOT Owned By Newfold Digital (AKA EIG)\n\nCarefully outlined below are the top 5 best hosting companies that are not owned by the Endurance International Group.\n\nPlease, note that, to really ensure that you have the very best service from my end here, I have also indicated why I think each of the 5 options here is a smart and awesome one — from the plethora of options the world offers today.\n\nAre you ready?\n\n1. A2 Hosting\n\nFounded in 2001, A2 Hosting (initially called Iniquinet) has come a long way in the hosting world and for professionals who know about the company, it is no surprise that it came here right at number 1.\n\nA2 recently laid claim to being the world’s fastest hosting company when it held that its solid-state turbo servers were 20X faster than that of the competition — a claim that I independently verified when I ran a special A2 hosting review recently.\n\nThis claim was also verified when I compared A2 vs SiteGround Hosting recently, one of its closest competitors (as a matter of fact, the speed was what gave it the competitive edge).\n\nHowever, speed is not the only claim A2 has to offer neither is it its only claim to fame.\n\nThe company is one of the very few hosting companies today that offers free SSL certificates to its clients and ensures that support queries (no matter the channels where they are brought in) are handled with the dispatch they deserve.\n\nWhy Is A2 An Awesome Option?\n\nA2 has the fastest (solid-state) turbo servers in the industry. As a matter of fact, no rival or competitor equals the company when it comes to speed. Hosting with A2 thus means that you’ll certainly please both users and bots — eventually dominating the SERPs without additional effort.\n\nHosting with A2 means that you’ll have a free SSL certificate for every website on an account. This helps in security and ensures that your readers trust you better — a reality that results in awesome conversions at the end.\n\nFree and easy site transfer — if you’re moving from another hosting company. Unlike BlueHost (a Newfold brand), no one will charge you a whopping $149.99 just to move your site over to A2’s servers).\n\nAn impressive 99.9% uptime guarantee. If you want to make it online and have your site work for you even when you sleep, doesn’t it need to be online as much as it can be?\n\nFinally, A2 offers an impressive ‘anytime money-back guarantee’. This is super rare in the hosting industry and its presence here only means that the company is sure you’ll love its services and not cancel at the end.\n\nWant to take a shot at A2? Click here to sign up directly and see these awesome features for yourself, first-hand.\n\n2. SiteGround Hosting\n\nFor many years running now, SiteGround has been one of the top 5 best hosting companies the hosting world affords.\n\nThe company took the hosting world by surprise when it made every customer special by ensuring that, no matter what channel used to contact them, one always had the attention of a rep in just a matter of moments!\n\nThe reality of placing customers on a pedestal — and making them feel like the true kings and queens that they are is not all SiteGround has to offer though: its servers are secured against the latest threats — and run only the very latest software, including the latest PHP version.\n\nSiteGround, without more unnecessary talk, is a darling in the web hosting world and is one of the options officially recommended by WordPress directly.\n\nWhy Is SiteGround An Awesome Option?\n\nSiteGround has been officially recommended by WordPress; WordPress in turn powers over 30% of the entire internet today. Does this make sense?\n\nHosting with SiteGround means a free SSL certificate (powered by Let’s Encrypt) for every website on the hosting plan. This goes a long way to keep your communication to and from the site, private. It also goes far to ensure that you keep prying and snooping eyes at bay!\n\nSiteGround has a super awesome support system. Chats are responded to almost immediately, phone calls are answered on the spot and tickets are updated in the first 10 minutes. What could be better, support-wise?\n\nHosting with this company means enjoying the benefits of a company with a security-first mindset. SiteGround, in terms of ensuring the security of sites on its servers, is simply best in class. Here, threats are neutralized even before webmasters know of their existence…this security first mindset also means that website security professionals make it their duty to stand guard over your site so that you can actually sleep. Is this not simply cool?\n\nDaily backup snapshots of your website. If anything ever goes wrong, restoring your site to an earlier point in time (when things worked pretty well) takes less than 5 minutes!\n\nThere is simply no way that the very best hosting companies would be discussed online and SiteGround would not be mentioned. You should take a look directly and see how awesome the company is!\n\n3. Dream Host\n\nFounded in 1996, DreamHost is older than Newfold itself (remember Newfold Digital as we know it today was founded in 1997).\n\nAs a matter of fact, DreamHost is one of the very oldest hosting companies online today.\n\nOf course, all those years behind a company means experience and tons of it.\n\nIt means the company is simply not in the realm of ‘trial and error’ again as it is dead certain of anything before the execution process commences.\n\nWith all those years behind it, the company certainly knows what it is doing: for instance, it is one of the very few hosting companies online to guarantee 100% uptime hosting.\n\nHowever, the awesomeness does not end there: the company, with its years of experience, approaches hosting in a manner that you always benefit at the end by purposefully focusing on what truly matters.\n\nIn the words of the company directly: “We make sure your website is fast, secure & always up — so your visitors & search engines trust you. Guaranteed”.\n\nCan you beat that?\n\nWhy Is Dream Host An Awesome Option?\n\nDreamHost is one of the very few hosting companies recommended by WordPress. You see, the company is not simply old — it has a ton of experience in the process and pretty much knows what it is doing.\n\nThis company offers 100% hosting uptime guarantee! This is one of the very few companies in the entire industry that guarantees you that your site will always remain online. In comparison to others, this, certainly, is the real deal.\n\nThe prices here are dead cheap. For only $2.59 a month, you are a proud account owner and web admin 🙂\n\nThe company is pro-security — and goes out of its way to ensure that sites hosted on its servers are safe. A good example of their commitment to security is the adoption of Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates for all websites hosted on their servers. Isn’t this plain brilliant?\n\nWith age, all good things come. Check out the good things Dream Host’s age has ensured for you directly by clicking here.\n\n4. InMotion Hosting\n\nFounded in 2001 and privately held since then, InMotion Hosting is one the smartest alternatives to Newfold Digital hosting today.\n\nThis hosting company is genuinely pro-business and seeks out classes of persons who need help online and offers that help.\n\nFor example, students get a steep student hosting discount when they opt to go with InMotion. For small businesses, this hosting company creates quick business websites for them in just 2 business days for only $99.\n\nThe most awesome part of the appeal of InMotion is that its services are priced fairly — and in a manner, anyone who is serious with business can afford. Basic hosting here starts at only a little over $4 a month with dedicated servers starting at just a little over $100.\n\nDoes it get better anywhere?\n\nWhy Is InMotion Hosting An Awesome Option?\n\nThis hosting company maintains an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, a consumer protection agency that reviews the integrity and performance of businesses in the US and Canada.\n\nInMotion hosting is truly considerate of newbies and other categories of persons who may have challenges accessing its services. If this is you, there is no sweeter deal online.\n\nThis hosting company’s services are modestly priced.

Click here to experience the power InMotion Hosting affords its clients directly.\n\n5. Liquid Web Hosting\n\nThe very last option on our list here today is Liquid Web — one of the top 5 finest hosting companies the web offers today.\n\nThe company is in fifth place today not because of any performance lags but simply because, it isn’t privately held again — at least, not in the manner we all know of a founder holding onto his or her creation and pumping new ideas into such a company with all the velocity of their dreams 🙂\n\nLiquid Web was sometime in the past sold to a Chicago-based investment firm, Madison Dearborn Partners.\n\nHowever, this is not a cause for worry at all: Madison Dearborn isn’t Newfold and they certainly don’t have the sad reputation that trails Newfold wherever they go (and whatever name they choose to adopt or change to).\n\nWhat is even worth noting about Liquid Web is that the company has grown from strength to strength since its sale and it now boasts of ensuring an impressive 100% uptime guarantee for its teeming customer base.\n\nFor that alone, we sincerely believe that the company is in great hands — well better hands than the Newfold brands!\n\nIn the section immediately below, we’ll share why opting for the company is a cool and awesome idea.\n\nWhy Is Liquid Web An Awesome Option?\n\nLiquid Web promises 100% uptime guarantee and keeps to its promise. It is one of the very few web hosting companies in the world that dares promise this.\n\nSupport is a top priority for this company. You are guaranteed a 59-second response to your query; this is one of the very best in the hosting industry.\n\nFully managed WordPress hosting. With this reality, you don’t need to do anything technical as all the technical bits are handled by the hosting professionals directly.\n\nAwesome for agencies, resellers, freelancers and business owners. There is something for everyone at Liquid Web.\n\nYou should check out the power of Liquid Web directly — we’re sure you’ll be awed!\n\nWrapping Up On The Best Non-Newfold Digital Hosting Available Today\n\nThese options can be overwhelming and making a choice that will serve you out of very good offers can be a little tasking.\n\nThat said, let me help you decide:"
