        "text": "HostGator.com, LLC is a world leading provider of shared, reseller, and dedicated web hosting. Privately held and based in Houston, Texas, the company was founded in 2002 by current President and CEO Brent Oxley, who started the company from his dorm room at Florida Atlantic University. Since then, HostGator has grown from a small hosting company with just three servers into a world leading and industry recognized hosting provider with more than 5,000 servers under management. The over one million domains hosted by HostGator make up approximately 1% of the world’s Internet traffic. As a technology and product innovator, HostGator is able to provide its more than 150,000 customers with innovative products and services designed to complement their existing businesses. HostGator serves customers ranging from individual freelancers to Fortune 500 companies in more than 170 countries. Because of the nature of reseller hosting, HostGator customers are frequently web designers and or developers who have chosen to provide hosting services to their clients. Businesses of all sizes and shapes frequently make use of HostGator’s affordable, but still powerful shared, reseller, and dedicated hosting services. Customers range from complete novices to computer and technology experts. In 2008, HostGator was recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of the fastest growing private companies in America. According to Inc. Magazine, HostGator is the 21st fastest growing private company in America, the second fastest growing private company in the “business services” sector, and the fastest growing private company in Texas. In order to keep up with the company’s rapid growth, HostGator moved from its original office in Boca Raton, Florida into a new 20,000 square foot office building in Houston, Texas. Since moving to Houston in January 2007, the company has added more than 150 employees. The company is growing rapidly and expects to add roughly 200 employees within the next two years. In a June 2008 customer satisfaction survey, approximately 90% of HostGator customers reported being satisfied with HostGator and the services it provides. Industry-leading customer service and support is at the forefront of what HostGator does on a day-to-day basis. The company is constantly working to improve and refine that service and support and achieve its goal of becoming the world leader in the global web hosting market.\n\nCheck out the product website\n\nRating: 4 out of 5 stars\n\nI am with Hostgator for 3-4 years now and I have never had any major problem with them or the service so far. There was once a problem with their servers, but the online chat support, which is one click away always, kept me updated and it was all fixed within few minutes.\n\nOn many occasions, I have contacted customer support and they have never let me down. I never had to call them. I just go to online chat and any additional features or help I need, I was given promptly.\n\nThe price can be a little expensive, but for instance, the baby croc plan is very good if you have multiple domains, websites etc. Bandwidth is unlimited, storage is unlimited, emails are unlimited, databases are unlimited and domain parkings are unlimited. The price? around $100 a year!\n\nI would definitely recommend them.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nI switched to HostGator a few months ago and could not be happier! I left my old host after numerous problems and support concerns gone unanswered or not answered to my likeness.\n\nThe setup process was extremely easy and straightfoward. My site and domains were up and running in less than 10 minutes.\n\nI have emailed their tech support people on a couple of issues and they responded back very fast and their answers fixed my problems the first time.\n\nPricing on their plans is a plus as well. I’m a customer for life.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars"
