        "text": "One of the first and most important steps in creating a website is choosing a domain name. A domain is an online identifier that should match the brand as closely as possible. However, getting a really good domain is not an easy task. When buying a domain name, it disappears from the database of available ones. You can bargain for an already purchased domain by offering a higher price.\n\nLet’s say you managed to find a suitable domain name. However, you don’t have a website yet. Congratulations, you have become the owner of the parked domain. Such domain names are beneficial for both beginners and experienced webmasters. In this article, we will explain in more detail what a parked domain is, how to use it, and how to specify it in your hosting profile.\n\nWHAT IS A PARKED DOMAIN?\n\nA parked domain is a domain name that has already been registered but is not being used by hosting for a particular site or email. To put it simply, this is a purchased domain name that is not in use yet. It is “parked” (reserved) for future use.\n\nMost of the well-known domains link to a specific web page. For example, the hubspot.com domain links to the home page of the HubSpot site. A parked domain links to the “parked domain” page, “but this domain” page, or an advertisement page. Oftentimes, a parked domain doesn’t link to any page. In the latter case, when clicking on the link, a page with the error “this site is unavailable” will be displayed.\n\nA parked domain can also link to the same page as the main one. It is usually called the “alias” of the main domain name.\n\nWHY PARKED DOMAIN NAMES?\n\nIf you don’t use a domain, why do you need one then? In fact, webmasters use parked domains for several purposes, which we will discuss below.\n\n1. To keep your valuable domain name\n\nA good domain name that suits a particular site is a very valuable asset. Many webmasters trying to acquire a domain name for a website faced a problem when the best options were already taken. The only way to get a good domain name is to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars to buy it. That is why many entrepreneurs buy a domain at the early stages of an online project, long before the start of work on creating a website. Given the importance of the role played by a good domain, it should be parked and held until the site is built.\n\n2. To redirect users to the same site through an alternate domain\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a parked domain can be used as an alternative to the main one. That is, the parked domain has the same IP address as the main one, and it leads to the same site. Companies often acquire multiple parked domains with similar names. For example, for a site with the main domain product.com, you can register several similar parked domains:\n\ngetproduct.com\n\nproduct.org\n\nproduct.co\n\nThe domains listed above are set as aliases for the main product.com. The main goal is to ensure that a user who has incorrectly remembered the main domain will end up on the correct site. In addition, using multiple parked domains with similar names can improve the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.\n\nReserving aliases as alternate domain names is an effective way to prevent cybersquatting. In simple words, cybersquatting is the deliberate acquisition of various variations of the main domain name of a particular company for their subsequent sale to the same company. Since cybersquatters can use alternative domains as they see fit, this can ultimately undermine the credibility of a particular brand. Acquiring several similar domain names at once and connecting them to the site will prevent such problems from arising.\n\n3. For subsequent resale\n\nSince domains are in high demand, many individuals and companies make money by reselling them. However, the domains remain parked. If the ideal domain name for your business is already taken, most likely someone wants to make money by reselling it.\n\n4. To keep the domain until the moment when it expires\n\nIf you want to close a site for one reason or another, unlink the domain name from the site’s IP address and save it until expiration. This will prevent anyone from using it until the end of the tenure.\n\nHOW DO I PARK MY DOMAIN?\n\nWould you like to park your domain so that someone else won’t buy it or use it as an alias? The parking process is similar to a regular reservation. First, make sure that a specific domain is available for purchase. The easiest way to check is to enter the domain you are interested in in the URL field in the browser. If a domain does not link to a specific site, chances are it is available for reservation or has already been parked by someone.\n\nThe next step is to perform a “WHOIS” search. With the help of ICANN tools, you will find out if a domain is owned by anyone, who owns it, as well as a lot of other useful information. If the perfect domain for your business is already taken, check out the different top-level domains (eg .org, .net, .co, or .io). If the domain is still available for purchase, contact your domain registrar and buy a domain.\n\nAfter the purchase, the domain is considered to be parked. You can simply renew the domain owner and not use it, or you can link it to a live site (use it as a pseudonym).\n\nHow do I create an alias for a domain name?\n\nAn alias is an alias for the primary domain name that links to the same content (site) as the primary domain. For example, getproduct.com can serve as an alias for product.com. Regardless of which option the user enters into the address bar of the browser, he will be directed to the same web page. You can set aliases in the server control panel, for example, through cPanel (a popular control panel for hosting accounts on OS Linux). To create an alias via cPanel, follow these steps:\n\n1.Log into your cPanel account.\n\n2. In the main window, under the Domains tab, select the Aliases option.\n\n3. In the text box under the Create New Alias ​​tab, enter the domain alias and click the Add Domain button. As a result, a new parked domain will appear in the list of aliases. You can set up a redirect for each alias, remove any alias.\n\nAccording to the cPanel hints, for the added alias to work, the new domain must refer to your hosting nameservers. If you do not provide this, the site will not load when navigating to the alias domain.\n\nDOMAIN NAME PARKING SERVICE\n\nUse a domain parking service to cover your domain maintenance costs. This service is free and is offered by many domain name registrars. Plus, it allows you to monetize your domain. The registrar creates an ad page for your domain to link to. The owner and the registrar share the advertising revenue among themselves.\n\nWhile it is simple and convenient, parking services are not for everyone. This is because your domain will link to an ad page. Anyone who finds out about your company before you launch the site will see this page instead of the expected one. You have no right to decide how many advertisements and what content will be displayed on this page. Ultimately, your business’s reputation can suffer. While domain parking services help cover some of the costs, they should not be considered a long-term solution.\n\nCOMPARISON OF ADDON AND PARKED DOMAINS\n\nFinally, let’s take a look at how addon and parked domain names differ from each other. Both of these options are available to cPanel users. Despite the apparent similarities at first glance, addon and parked domain names are used for different purposes.\n\nA parked domain is any domain name that is not associated with any unique website or online service. It may not be associated with a specific page or serve as an alias for the main domain. An addon domain is used to navigate to a separate site that is not linked to other domains. By adding an addon domain to cPanel, you can manage the settings of several different sites through one control panel.\n\nIn simple words, parked domains are several variants of one domain for a specific site, while addon domains are different domains for different sites. Both the former and the latter are accessible through a single cPanel.\n\nDO YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL DOMAIN? PARK IT\n\nAs you can see, there is nothing difficult about the term “parked domain“, since, in fact, this is a registered domain name that has not yet been used. This does not mean that a parked domain is useless. First, you can reserve it until your site needs it. Secondly, with its help, you will “catch” additional traffic (users who have entered a similar domain name by mistake). If you have come up with a unique domain name, and it has not yet been reserved by anyone, do not miss the opportunity – park it. And you will make a decision regarding its further use later.\n\nIf you know only one name in the modern world of web hosting, SiteGround is probably the name. Someone loves the company, someone hates it – as in any popular online business, SiteGround has its share of happy and unhappy customers.\n\nBut most people will not say that SiteGround has done an excellent job developing their business over the past 5 years. These are the fastest growing hosting companies I have ever seen in a long time – their name was mentioned in every publication on social networks related to hosting, and in WHSR we get SiteGround service requests more often than all other brands.\n\nSo what’s so special about SiteGround? We are going to find out in this review.\n\nIf you’re looking for a SiteGround review that shows you behind the scenes, you’ve come to the right place.\n\nAbout SiteGround Company\n\nIt was founded in 2004 by a group of university friends.\n\nThe company claims that at the time of writing, it accepted more than 2,000,000 domains.\n\nServices: shared, managed WP, ​​managed WooCommerce, dedicated and cloud hosting\n\nOffices in five different countries: Bulgaria, Italy, Spain, the UK, and the USA.\n\nWhat’s in this SiteGround review\n\nPROS\n\nExcellent server performance – 100% uptime + excellent speed\n\nFree site migration for GrowBig and GoGeek users\n\nChoosing server locations on three continents\n\nOfficially recommended by WordPress.org and Drupal.org\n\nEasy setup Let’s Encrypt Standard & Wild Card SSL\n\nAdvanced Server Speed ​​Technologies\n\nSave 60% on SiteGround First Account\n\nGreat reviews from other SiteGround users\n\nAwesome customer support\n\nCons\n\nThe performance guarantee does not cover failures in the case of DDoS\n\nHosting cost after the first invoice\n\nPros: Why We Like SiteGround Hosting\n\n1. Extremely reliable and fast – 100% host uptime\n\nI cannot but stress how important it is that the hosting provider is always reliable and fast since any downtime or slowdown of your site can seriously affect the overall return on investment. That’s why SiteGround’s hosting performance impressed me, as they are capable of maintaining 100% uptime from year to year and loading relatively quickly.\n\nSiteGround Hosting Performance\n\nFYI, WHSR reviews are partly based on tracking performance on the sites we install on each host. In addition to a subsidiary site designed to track host performance (HostScore), we also conduct independent tests on our own sites for each host.\n\nHere are the speed statistics for my test site hosted on SiteGround in January and February 2020.\n\nSiteGround Speed ​​Test in Bitchatch\n\nRecent Website: Ground Uptime (2020)\n\nI always liked SiteGround because I had very few problems with them. In particular, server reliability, in my opinion, is one of SiteGround’s most powerful solutions.\n\nThe following image shows the SiteGround uptime we received in January and February 2020. Their server performance has always been impressive to me – I have data for 2014 showing that they continuously achieve 99.99% uptime.\n\nPrevious siteGround Uptime (2014 – 2019)\n\n2. Free site migration for GrowBig and GoGeek users\n\nWith each new GrowBig or GoGeek hosting account at SiteGround, you get one free professional website translation. The support service at SiteGround will help transfer your site to your SiteGround server. For StartUp users, the transfer service is paid (30 US dollars for each site transfer).\n\nHow to request a free site migration to SiteGround\n\nThe GIF image shows how to request a site transfer. Please note that I am using my personal account to demonstrate how this is done.\n\nSiteground migrator\n\nAlternatively, there is the possibility of self-migration for WordPress users – SiteGround Migrator. This is a special plug-in for automating the transfer (after you install and enter the necessary data) of a WordPress site into your SiteGround hosting account.\n\n3. Choosing server locations on three continents\n\nLike all things in our world, data transfer is limited by physical limitations.\n\nWhen your site is placed closer to your users, it will load faster for them (since data and user requests are moved a shorter distance).\n\nFaster site loading time corresponds to a better user experience. Better user experience is often equal to higher online customer conversions.\n\nTherefore, it is important to place your site near your users.\n\nSiteGround provides users with a choice of six server locations when registering:\n\nChicago and Iowa, USA\n\nLondon, Great Britain\n\nAmsterdam and Emshaven, Holland\n\nSingapore.\n\nThis allows users to host their site next to an audience.\n\nWe performed several latent tests for the UK and Malaysia / Singapore Sites in 2017/2018. Based on our testing results, SiteGround is best suited for sites targeting an audience living in these regions.\n\nUK time-out tests\n\nLatency Tests from Malaysia / Singapore\n\n4. Let’s Encrypt SSL support: easy SSL installation and upgrade\n\nSecurity is important to a website because it not only protects you from hackers and malware but also tells your users that their data is safe on your website.\n\nSiteGround offers Let’s Encrypt and Wild Card SSL for free when you sign up with their web hosting plans, and it is surprisingly easy to install on any of your domain names.\n\nTo verify and install Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates on SiteGround\n\nTo show you how to Let’s Encrypt SSL is installed on SiteGround, let me go to my personal account. Below you see the SiteGround Hosting user dashboard.\n\nLet’s Encrypt Wildcard SSL support\n\nStarting March 29, 2018, all SiteGround customers can receive a free SSL Let’s Encrypt Wildcard – which greatly simplifies the process of setting up subdomains.\n\nStandard Let’s Encrypt SSL Against WildCard SSL\n\nWhen using the standard FOC Let’s Encrypt SSL, users need to install a separate domain certificate for each subdomain.\n\nWith Wildcard, you can provide them with one certificate.\n\nPrivate SSL (Premium EV SSL) at SiteGround – Purchase and Installation\n\nSiteGround also offers Premium EV and Wildcard SSL certification through GlobalSign for users who need them. To buy your private SSL , just log in and go to “Add services” (see image).\n\nWildcard SSL lookup certificate costs $ 90 ++ for 12 months; EV SSL Certificate costs $ 499 ++.\n\n6. Advanced server speed technologies (SSD, HTTP / 2, NGINX and others)\n\nAll SiteGround shared hosting comes with:\n\nFull SSD Storage,\n\nHTTP / 2 servers\n\nEasy implementation of Cloudflare CDN, and\n\nDifferent levels of the caching mechanism using SiteGround SuperCacher\n\nThese features help users easily optimize the download speed of their site.\n\n7.

What for?\n\nI believe that customer support is one of the main reasons. It is always easy to get help from SiteGround – whether through chat, email, phone or their 4,500 knowledge base and tutorials.\n\nPricing: How much does SiteGround Hosting cost?\n\nSiteGround Shared Hosting Prices\n\nSiteGround Cloud (/ VPS) Hosting Prices\n\nSiteGround Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow good is SiteGround?\n\nSiteGround is one of the most recognizable names in web hosting, which boasts impressive server performance and reliability.

Moreover, today for this you don’t need to know at least the basics of programming, code or HTML markup, because there are ready-made management systems (CMS) that allow you to create websites of various subjects. There are several popular CMS, which are characterized by ease of administration and functionality. Among those are Joomla and WordPress. Therefore, in this article I want to talk to you on the topic: Which is better: Joomla or WordPress?\n\nNote: If you still have not decided on the choice of CMS and do not know where to start creating the site, then I advise you to register for our free 7-day training on creating a site from scratch!\n\nBoth the first and second systems became popular due to the following characteristics:\n\nsimplicity\n\nintuitive clarity of the administrative panel\n\nquite high functionality\n\nthe ability to create sites of various subjects.\n\nBut which of these systems to choose? And why? Read more about this below!\n\nWhat is a content management system or CMS?\n\nBefore considering what to choose Joomla or WordPress, first read the general background information. CMS in English means Content Manager System. Its main purpose is to manage the site and its content.\n\nNote! In fact, this is a kind of program that is installed on the hosting.\n\nThe basis of this engine is a database. That is, a special table in which fields and cells are provided for:\n\narticle titles\n\ndirectly to the article itself\n\npost pictures\n\ncomments, etc.\n\nThe CMS allows you to easily change the database structure as it is convenient for the user.\n\nThe main positive characteristic of such systems is that the site owner can easily, at any time, change the design of his resource. At the same time, there will be no problems with existing content – its changes do not apply.\n\nJoomla or WordPress: not an easy choice\n\nThose who are just thinking about creating their own site are wondering: “Which is better: Joomla or WordPress and why, how to make the right choice and avoid mistakes when choosing.”\n\nEach system has its own positive features and advantages. Therefore, to decide really is not so simple. But let’s order.\n\nWhat is Joomla and what is its uniqueness\n\nThis engine is the best option when creating:\n\nsmall social network\n\nnot too large with an average corporate site functionality\n\nentertainment project.\n\nNote! If your goal is to create a website that will publish a huge number of photos and video clips, Joomla is suitable for solving the problem almost perfectly.\n\nJoomla has a large number of widgets – a few thousand – that even a novice can easily install. With WordPress, unfortunately, is not so simple. Yes, there are also extensions, but in some situations you can’t do without PHP skills.\n\nThe next positive feature of Joomla is the ability to easily manage individual elements of the page.\n\nYes, and the menu of the administrative panel is convenient and clear. It provides a large number of different categories and sections, the option of adding new categories, editing existing ones is available. In WordPress, there are certain limitations in this area.\n\nSEO for Joomla\n\nSEO is an important stage of site development. As each owner wants to receive profit from the project, it is necessary to devote a sufficient amount of time to the promotion of the resource.\n\nHowever, Joomla is not as good at promoting as WordPress – the latter is ideally suited for creating websites that will ultimately take leading positions in search engine ranking.\n\nNote! The success of the site also depends on the dedication and efficiency of its owner – you have to work very hard on the content, select the right keywords to achieve the desired result.\n\nWhat can I say bad about Joomla\n\nDo not think that I specifically sought out some negative features or find fault. No, now it will be a question of quite objective shortcomings of the Joomla engine.\n\nDoubtful design of the template, which is not everyone likes. In particular, the creators have installed many elements, in fact, absolutely not necessary. Therefore, to make work more comfortable, you will need to clean them.\n\nAll work is done only manually, but to effectively do this, you must have knowledge of HTML. And not superficial, but rather deep. Since, if there is no such knowledge, it is very, very difficult to understand the accumulation of elements and sections. But even knowledge of HTML in this case will lead to the fact that you have to spend a lot of time.\n\nNote! In general, the templates of this engine are not too simple. They can hardly be called intuitive. It seems nothing special, but still!\n\nLow speed work. Sites created on the Joomla system are loaded for a relatively long time. For example, even sites that are not too full of content and installed on powerful servers can load up to 4 seconds. In modern conditions – it is VERY long! To achieve loading in a couple of seconds, you need to recycle at least 50% of the entire template. The low speed is due to the fact that a large number of different folders are created on the FTP server for Joomla, which leads to low indexing. If the user has a weak GPRS or EDGE channel, then downloading the site will most likely be unrealistic.\n\nNote! WordPress does not suffer from slow loading. Moreover, it does not require expensive hosting. Just its engine is made so that the pages of the site will be loaded in the browser pretty quickly.\n\nAttendance\n\nWith high attendance Joomla can not withstand the influx of users, which would entail a lot of problems.\n\nAlthough, if you create a regular home page, you are unlikely to encounter this drawback. After all, her attendance will not be so high. Although the future must still take into account this possible problem.\n\nSubtotal: Findings about Joomla\n\nAccording to the review of the Joomla engine, you should not think that I am already setting you up for a choice solely in favor of WordPress. No, I tried to objectively explain all the positive aspects of the system, but also point out its weaknesses, so that you can navigate in all the features of this CMS.\n\nWhat is WordPress and how does it attract\n\nAbout the WordPress platform heard all who:\n\nengaged in the creation of sites\n\nfamiliar with web design\n\nengaged in the promotion of sites\n\nor at least just wondered how web resources are created.\n\nThis CMS is constantly evolving, improving and in recent years is at the peak of popularity. She is the best option for:\n\nblogs\n\npersonal pages\n\nsites on several pages.\n\nHowever, this is not a complete list of sites that can be created on WordPress. For example, you can even find online cinemas on WordPress in the network, although in this case it is better to choose Joomla.\n\nNote! Today there are also commercial sites on CMS WordPress. Among them are many of those who occupy a leading position in the issuance of search engines.\n\nBut the best option is to use VorPress for non-commercial resources, and blogs, diaries, personal pages.\n\nAnd immediately about some of the negative points\n\nDo you know why I almost at the very beginning of the review of this platform decided to focus on the negative characteristics? Yes, because they are few!\n\nImmediately I would like to stay at a low level of protection. There are many reviews of site owners who say that WordPress was simply hacked. Therefore, I recommend that you carefully study all the security features of the portal, read about how to achieve its effective enhancement.\n\nAlso Check: How to register the best possible Domain name & Hosting?\n\nTo make major changes to the overall structure will have to work hard. Or even involve a third-party specialist who has certain knowledge, if you do not have any!\n\nThe main advantages of WordPress\n\nA large number of templates – they are easily edited. In fact, even schoolchildren can do this job. There is no need to go deep – everything is on the surface.\n\nThe official site presents a huge number of themes, templates. The engine itself is a “thing in itself”! It is laconic, functional and outwardly attractive. The system is ready to go!\n\nIt works fast. Download speed no more than 1.5 seconds. And even then, if the site is really quite heavy. On average, with a good Internet download speed is 0.7 seconds.\n\nNote! If you read the profile forums dedicated to this platform, you can get practical advice on how to increase the speed of the site.\n\nPerfect for SEO promotion. There are special extensions installed by one click, allowing to optimize the “promotion” of the site.\n\nAbove, I said that sites created specifically on the WordPress platform are often hacked. However, the system itself is automatically updated – the developers are constantly making changes to the security system. If you update the engine in time, you will be able to protect yourself from hacker attacks.\n\nSubtotal: Findings About WordPress\n\nThe information presented makes it possible to understand that, in general, the WordPress platform is superior to its competitor in several ways.\n\nIn particular, this CMS is simple and clear, it has an easy control panel, which has many functions. Even novices who have no skills in programming, layout and administration of sites will understand it without problems.\n\nTherefore, those who are looking for a suitable system for themselves should choose WordPress . Although the individual parameters, he is inferior to Joomla.\n\nJoomla or WordPress: what is better for a blogger and what is better for an entrepreneur?\n\nContinuing a few more comparisons. Of course, the above information is already enough to make a specific conclusion. But, if you are suddenly confused or still can not make a final decision, let’s consider which platform is ideal:\n\nfor blogs\n\nfor online business.\n\nAfter all, these areas are most in demand at the moment. If someone needs a website, then, more often than not, he creates it because of the desire to run his blog or do business online.\n\nBlog: Joomla or WordPress?\n\nSo, initially WordPress was developed specifically for blogs. What is already its advantage over Joomla, if we compare both systems in this section. Only later, the developers decided that it was possible to create a full-fledged CMS and added a whole range of functions and blocks.\n\nTherefore, Joomla loses. To it, the blog features have been added separately. So if you want to become a blogger, I recommend concentrating your attention on WordPress.\n\nMoreover, you can create your own website yourself, even if you do not have programming skills – you do not have to spend money to pay for the work of invited experts.\n\nOnline business: Joomla or WordPress?\n\nIf you decide to run a business online, for example, through landing pages, you have to spend a lot of time and effort on finding the perfect CMS.\n\nIf you are new to such matters, then choosing Joomla will spend a little more time, effort, and even nerves on creating pages and building a business than choosing WordPress.\n\nAlthough it is necessary to recognize the fact that, in general, Jumla is an ideal resource for creating landing pages, but working with it is a lot of knowledge, skills and abilities. Without them, success will be very difficult.\n\nTherefore, WordPress will also be the best choice for online entrepreneurs!\n\nWhat else would I like to say: multilingual and localization support\n\nAnother important point to talk about. So, the vast majority of sites are created not only in English, but also in other languages. Therefore, it is important to use a CMS that will support many languages. And also, which has support for many languages.\n\nThe WordPress platform is an ideal choice if you need to create a website in several languages. Simply install a special plugin that allows you to get what you want.\n\nPay the whole! At the moment, the platform supports 53 languages ​​and, I am sure, this is not the limit!\n\nAt the same time, plug-ins and templates are also created in several languages ​​at once, which simplifies the work of site owners. Developers are trying to make their CMS used by people in different regions of the planet.\n\nIn turn, Joomla also allows you to create multilingual resources, but for this you do not need to install special extensions. It is enough to select the language of interest in the control panel. However, the number of languages ​​available is not that big.\n\nWhich is better: Joomla or WordPress Final decision\n\nI spoke in detail about all the features of the two platforms for creating websites. Now you can understand for yourself by choosing Joomla or WordPress which one is better. Of course, I immediately recommend taking into account exactly which project you are going to do. If this is a blog, then the answer is obvious – it is given in the article. It will be WordPress!\n\nNow let’s go further. In general, today there is a clear tendency that more and more webmasters and just those who want to make a website for themselves, choose Vodpress. And they do it quite consciously for several reasons:\n\nsimple installation\n\nno complicated settings\n\nfree themes and templates\n\nmany free extensions that increase the functionality of sites.\n\nSpecial mention deserves the so-called “brotherhood” WordPress. At the forum of platform developers you can always find the answer to any question. If not the developers themselves, then the more experienced users who have thoroughly studied this system will give it. Although, of course, it is necessary to know English in order to correctly ask a question and understand what was answered to you.\n\nA constant update for WordPress deserves your attention – the developers are doing everything to make the platform more convenient, functional and secure. Developers pay enough attention to the correction of errors.\n\nIn fairness, we should admit that Joomla is also quite functional and convenient, but I personally, like my familiar webmasters, like WordPress.\n\nIf you still have not decided on the choice of CMS and do not know where to start creating the site, then I advise you to register for our free 7-day training on creating a site from scratch!\n\nBuying domain name is easy and you can easily have the chances of getting any domain name you desire in the market. However getting the right domain name is difficult. A domain name is the identity of your website, it is important that you choose the best out of all available options. A good domain name should be short, catchy and should justify the purpose of your website very well. A right domain name can be an asset to your business.\n\nAlthough there are so many new domain extensions to choose from, I still think that the .com is the best for business. A lot of people feel that .com domains are sold out and they are not at all available. However, there are plenty of .com names left to choose from. You just have to look for it.\n\nFinding the right domain name\n\nYou can look for the domain name at GoDaddy. There are online marketplaces where you can also buy or sell domain names. Once you finally decide a domain name, there are a few things you can keep in mind. Ask yourself – Is the chosen domain names unique? The domain name has to stand out if you really want to make your website a big empire.\n\nDoes the website completely describe the purpose of your business? It should not be unsettling. It should be your next new name. Also, make sure that your website is a short name because long names are difficult to remember and they take time to be a household name for people. For example, you call noodles Maggie, although it’s a name, a brand, It has its contemporaries in the market. But still, instant noodles is Maggie! Likewise, your domain name has to be like that. It has to become a household name for the brand or the service you are providing through the business.\n\nFind a host for your website\n\nFind a good home for your website by choosing a reliable hosting company. There are so many options for hosting that it is easy to get overwhelmed. Choosing the hosting company is important. You should see the aspect that, the hosting company you are choosing should be established. Especially if it’s a new company, you don’t want to be a part of a hosting company where you are its only customer . This is bad for business; it would not launch you well. What kind of reputation does the company have? Any company can have some negative reviews. That it in itself doesn’t rule out the hosting company, but if you see a lot of complaints, move on to the next.\n\nResearch well the hosting company. Also, contact its support group before signing up. Now, this is important. Check how long does the host take to respond, how does it treat you as a customer, how long did you have to wait on hold? Does the company even have phone support? This will determine .how the hosting is going to treat your future traffic. If it treats you well and passes through all of the above-specified checklists. You have chosen the right place for your domain name. Price considerations on hosting are also necessary. Don’t get into the trap of buying cheap web hosting which later turns out of an expensive deal due to a number of extra charges. Is the admin interface easy to use? Check out the admin area before you sign up to make sure it is intuitive.\n\nSpecialization of the web hosting\n\nIf you run a Word Press website, see if the host is optimized for the platform. Look for the entire package of the hosting. Like the number of websites in one account, the amount of storage and band with the hosting provides. Well, this is obviously something any domain name owner would do, I Specified it to keep every minute detail clear on the table.\n\nScalability of the web hosting\n\nOnce I signed up with one of the largest hosting companies and a few days later they told me that I needed to pay more now. Bait and switch happen in the hosting world. Needless to say that, I have moved my site. I don’t want to do business with companies like that.\n\nAnother aspect that is important is choosing the right website platform. My personal favourite is WordPress, but then your business need might be different so you choose the website platform accordingly. The platform on which you build your site will impact everything from content creation to SEO to reliability. Choosing the best platform for your business model is necessary. Around 23 per cent of the website world uses word press as its platform.\n\nSo this article was all about registering your domain name, web hosting and choosing the right platforms. When it comes to choosing platforms, make sure that you use a platform that has a lot of plug-ins that work in favour of your website. Plugins like word fence security, SEO, Woo-commerce etc. If you are a business owner and need help in deciding the domain name and hosting that suits your requirement for Varanasi do not hesitate to email us at FAQ@digitalgrowth.world"
