Need more help? Our Sales team is ready to assist you.\n\n757-416-6575\n\nWhat is Web Hosting?\n\nWebsite hosting service provides you with space on a web server to store your website’s data, such as web files, professional email, and databases. In simple terms, you are renting server space from a web hosting company to build your website or application on. The hosting provider owns and maintains the server, which is where your website’s files are stored.\n\nDepending on your chosen web hosting package, we also offer a range of features such as free SSL certificates, 99.99% uptime guarantee, a WebPro control panel for agencies and freelancers, and eCommerce hosting for online stores. Additional security is of the utmost importance when choosing a web hosting provider. That’s why we offer data backup solutions, dedicated IP addresses, malware detection, DDoS prevention, and web application firewalls.\n\nWhether you’re a small business owner or a large corporation, we have a web hosting solution that can meet your needs and exceed your expectations.\n\nWhat are the different types of web hosting products InMotion Hosting offers?\n\nAt InMotion Hosting, we take pride in offering a range of web hosting plans, including WordPress hosting, VPS hosting (virtual private servers), Dedicated Servers, and Shared Web Hosting. As industry leading web hosts, we own and operate our servers, which means that we have complete control over their maintenance and operation. However, all the data that you store on our servers belongs to you.\n\nWe also offer web hosting platforms purpose-built to support and serve your favorite web applications, frameworks, and content management systems. These web hosting solutions are optimized for the fastest possible performance for your website and tailored to meet the specific server configurations needed of your web apps for an easy and worry-free web hosting experience, such as: Drupal Hosting, Joomla Hosting, OpenCart Hosting, Magento Hosting, PrestaShop Hosting, PHP Hosting, and more.\n\nWhat is Shared Hosting?\n\nShared hosting is a type of web hosting service where multiple website domains are hosted on the same web hosting server, with each website allocated a specific portion of the server resources for their data and website. In other words, the server resources are shared among multiple websites, hence the name shared hosting.\n\nThis type of hosting is generally the most affordable option for those looking to host a website. With shared hosting, you don’t need to worry about managing the server or its resources, as the hosting provider takes care of that for you.\n\nInMotion Hosting is a shared hosting provider with plans that can scale all the way through dedicated hosting. We offer a range of shared hosting plans to fit your needs, from basic plans for personal websites to more advanced plans for businesses with higher traffic and resource needs. Our shared hosting plans come with a range of features, including unlimited disk space and bandwidth, free domain registration, and easy-to-use website builders, making it easy for anyone hosting a website to get up and running quickly and stress-free.\n\nHow do I switch web hosting providers?\n\nAt InMotion, we make it easy to switch website hosts. Web hosting migration and website migration from a different hosting provider is offered at no charge based on the web hosting plan you have selected. Once you buy web hosting there are several methods to transfer to websites.\n\nWe offer a free plugin if you would like to transfer your own WordPress website. If you need assistance, our support team is happy to help with cPanel to cPanel transfers. For a more complicated transfer, our Launch Assist website migration service program can transfer all of your files and databases to your new InMotion Hosting account. Some plans include Launch Assist or you can purchase it through our managed hosting department.\n\nYour data, website, and databases will have a seamless transition with zero downtime. If you are a web guru, you can also migrate your website to your new hosting plan without any assistance.\n\nHow does the web hosting money-back guarantee work if I have prepaid for a year or more?\n\nWe strive to provide the best hosting experience, whether you’re joining or leaving InMotion Hosting. That’s why we offer a full money-back guarantee on all web hosting plans, which is tailored to your specific hosting plan and renewal term — 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days.\n\nIf you have prepaid yearly, your refund will be prorated based on usage and eligibility. For plans that qualify for our 90-day money-back guarantee, prorated refunds can be requested between 31 and 90 days of your initial term; refunds are not available after the initial 90-day period. Please note, there are no refunds for addons or Remote KVMs.\n\nYou can find all the details about our guarantee in our terms of service.\n\nWhy should I choose InMotion Hosting as my web hosting provider?\n\nWhen seeking the perfect web hosting provider to entrust with your online presence, deciding where to buy hosting becomes pivotal. InMotion Hosting emerges as a standout option, offering a comprehensive range of hosting packages that cater to every aspect of your web site hosting service.
