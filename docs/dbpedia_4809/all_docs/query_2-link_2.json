        "text": "Struggling to choose between SiteGround vs Bluehost for hosting your sites? I was too. So I signed up for both and then tested them head-to-head to find out which is better.\n\nIn this post, I’ll share the findings of this hands-on comparison and shed some light on the performance of these hosts to help you make the right choice for your needs.\n\nSiteGround vs Bluehost (IN DETAIL)\n\nLet’s look at these hosts in a couple of main areas:\n\nFeatures\n\nPerformance\n\nUser experience\n\nSupport\n\nPricing\n\nFeatures ⚙️\n\nNow, let’s compare the features in SiteGround vs Bluehost in a little more detail.\n\nHere is the key to what the emojis mean:\n\n❌ – the host does not offer this feature on any plan.\n\n✅ – the host offers this feature on all of its plans.\n\n✅💰 – the host offers this feature, but only on the higher-tier plans (or it’s an add-on that costs extra).\n\nAs you can see, both SiteGround and Bluehost offer most of the important features that you need to host a WordPress site (or a different type of website).\n\nHowever, Bluehost does charge extra for some key features, such as automatic backups. Even with that, Bluehost will still often work out to be cheaper than SiteGround. You could also avoid some of these upcharges by using plugins instead, such as a WordPress backup plugin.\n\nPerformance 📈\n\nHow quickly your website loads is important for creating a great user experience and maximizing your marketing efforts, so any SiteGround vs Bluehost performance differences should play an important role in your decision.\n\nTo put them to the test, we set up our own websites on both hosts and then subjected them to regular performance tests and uptime monitoring.\n\nWe’ve been running these ongoing tests for years now, which gives us lots of insights into the performance of both hosts.\n\nHands-on speed testing results\n\nHere are the results of our hands-on performance testing for both SiteGround and Bluehost.\n\nIn general, both hosts did pretty well in our performance tests, with load times well under two seconds for most locations that we run our tests from.\n\nHands-on uptime test results\n\nTo check uptime, we set up an uptime monitor for both hosts and let it run indefinitely.\n\nHere’s our SiteGround vs Bluehost uptime data from the past few months:\n\nOverall, there’s no real difference when it comes to uptime, and both hosts performed quite well in our testing.\n\nUser experience 🧑‍💻\n\nIn general, both SiteGround and Bluehost offer a user-friendly experience for both non-technical and technical users.\n\nEven if you’ve never made a WordPress site, you should have no problem setting one up with either host.\n\nIn terms of dashboards, however, there’s one big difference right away:\n\nSiteGround uses its own custom dashboard tool called Site Tools.\n\nBluehost has also built some custom dashboard experiences, but Bluehost also gives you full access to cPanel.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with what cPanel is, it’s kind of the “standard” hosting dashboard experience that many hosts use. SiteGround used to offer cPanel, but SiteGround moved to its 100% custom Site Tools dashboard in 2020.\n\nWhich one is better? Well, it really depends on your personal preferences.\n\nIf you’re already familiar with cPanel and you’ve built some of its tools into your workflow, you might prefer Bluehost because you still get full cPanel access.\n\nHowever, SiteGround’s Site Tools dashboard is plenty capable and gives you access to a lot of the same functionality that you’d get with cPanel.\n\nTo let you make your own decision, let’s take a hands-on look at the SiteGround vs Bluehost user experience and dashboards, including what it’s like to make a WordPress site at each.\n\nSiteGround dashboard and user experience\n\nSiteGround’s custom hosting dashboard is called Site Tools.\n\nWhen you’re just getting started, you get a simple tool to install WordPress and set up your site – we cover it in detail in our guide on how to install WordPress on SiteGround.\n\nFrom there, you can manage your individual sites in a dashboard that looks like this:\n\nIn the sidebar, you’ll find a range of different tools to manage areas like performance, security, backups, and so on.\n\nFor example, here’s what it’s like to use the backup system.\n\nYou can also pin your favorite tools to the top so that you can quickly access them, which is a nice bit of customization. You can see this in the first screenshot.\n\nIn general, most regular users will not feel like they’re limited in comparison to cPanel. For example, if you don’t feel like connecting to your server via FTP, SiteGround offers its own file manager tool, just like cPanel File Manager.\n\nBluehost dashboard and user experience\n\nBluehost’s dashboard is a mix of a custom interface as well as full cPanel access.\n\nTo create a new WordPress site, Bluehost offers a simple installer tool – our guide on how to install WordPress on Bluehost covers it in more detail.\n\nYou can either make a basic WordPress install or use Bluehost’s WonderSuite features to help you build a complete website.\n\nOnce you’ve set up your site, you get a dedicated dashboard for each site that lets you manage key areas:\n\nOverview – see basic details and access key areas like cPanel File Manager.\n\nSecurity – manage free SSL certificates and SiteLock (SiteLock costs extra).\n\nBackups – you can manage backups if you pay for CodeGuard (some plans offer a free year of CodeGuard, but it costs money after that).\n\nPlugins – manage all of the plugins on your site, including activating and updating plugins.\n\nUsers – manage WordPress users, including resetting a user’s password.\n\nSpeed – manage performance features, such as the built-in page caching and Cloudflare integration.\n\nAdvanced – manage advanced details like databases, SSH keys, access logs, FTP access, phpMyAdmin, etc.\n\nSettings – manage key WordPress settings like automatic updates.\n\nIf you want to access more advanced tools, Bluehost still lets you access the full cPanel interface from the Advanced tab in your dashboard – just click the Manage button next to cPanel.\n\nHaving access to cPanel is a nice bonus for more experienced users who want to make use of more advanced tools. However, for non-technical users, you might never even need to interact with this area.\n\nSupport 🖱️\n\nBoth SiteGround and Bluehost offer 24/7 support via a variety of channels, so you’ll have no problem getting in touch with someone if you need some help.\n\nHere’s a quick table comparing some key details:\n\nPricing 💵\n\nIn general, Bluehost is a little bit cheaper than SiteGround. However, Bluehost no longer offers unlimited websites on its plans, while SiteGround still allows unlimited websites (though the plans still have storage limits).\n\nWhen it comes to Bluehost vs SiteGround pricing, there are a lot of variables to consider.\n\nFirst off, both SiteGround and Bluehost use a promotional pricing strategy to give you a discounted price on your first billing cycle (which is usually a year, if you pay for the full year upfront).\n\nHowever, once that first billing cycle ends and you need to renew your account, you’ll need to pay the “regular” price, which can often be more than double the promotional price.\n\nAs such, it’s important to consider both prices when making your decision. In general, Bluehost is cheaper than SiteGround when it comes to the regular price, even though the promotional prices are similar.\n\nFor example, with promotional pricing, the entry-level plan costs $2.99 per month at SiteGround and $1.99 per month at Bluehost.\n\nSame same, right?\n\nHowever, after the first year, that same plan would cost $17.99 per month at SiteGround, but only $11.99 per month at Bluehost.\n\nHere are some tables to compare pricing at SiteGround and Bluehost for different plan tiers – for more details, check out our full guides to SiteGround pricing and Bluehost pricing.\n\nFinal thoughts on Bluehost vs SiteGround 🏁\n\nIn the end, there’s no single winner when it comes to choosing between SiteGround vs Bluehost.\n\nRather than trying to recommend one host to every single person who reads this, I think it’s more useful to lay out the situations in which you might want to pick one of them over the other (or where a different host might be an even better option than both Bluehost and SiteGround).\n\nFAQs about SiteGround and Bluehost 💡\n\nLastly, let’s run over a few common questions that you might have about these two hosts:\n\nDo you still have any questions about choosing between SiteGround and Bluehost for your website(s)?
