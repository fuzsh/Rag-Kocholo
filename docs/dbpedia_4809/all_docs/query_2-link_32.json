Email hosting services also make it easy to set up and deploy individual email accounts for your employees. Whether it’s your personal email address, such as a Gmail account, or a work account, all email activity is hosted in some way, shape or form.\n\nWhich email hosting service is right for me?\n\nFinding the right email hosting solution for your business is a function of your needs. You have to consider factors like your industry, existing information technology (IT) environment, headcount, inbox and attachment size requirements, feature requirements and more.\n\nIf you need to support a lot of users, you probably want something with volume discounting. If you are in an industry that is disproportionately targeted by cybercriminals, then you should consider security-focused providers.\n\nEssential features\n\nWhile there’s no universal checklist of essential email hosting service features, there are some basic factors to consider.\n\nInbox size: Optimising storage is crucial for effectively managing your emails, while minimising IT costs. If your inbox size is too small, you may constantly run out of space, rendering your email useless. If you choose an inbox size that is much larger than what is required, then you’ll be paying for capacity that goes unused\n\nAttachment size: Take into account the size and frequency of file attachments in your emails. If your business frequently sends or receives large files, then you might need an email hosting service provider that supports oversized attachments (you will need to take this into consideration when determining which inbox size you require)\n\nSecurity tools: Protecting your emails and data is essential. At the very least, your email hosting service should offer end-to-end encryption, spam filtering, malware scanning and integration with multifactor authentication platforms. Depending on the industry you work in, you might require additional features to keep secure data and comply with regulations\n\nCalendar functionality: Email and calendar functionality can be vital to enabling collaborative working environments. When you are considering your next email hosting service provider, make sure its calendar functionalities meet your needs or integrate with your workforce management platform\n\nMobile apps: Nearly half of all emails are opened on a mobile device. Before you commit to an email hosting service, make sure its mobile app supports your must-have features, and works with the mobile platforms that your employees use to get the job done.\n\nSupport and ease of use\n\nChecking a hosting service offers essential features for your business is fairly clear cut, but finding a system that feels right to employees, and isn’t too complex for your IT team, can be tricky.\n\nIf the system is difficult for employees to adopt and master, or too difficult for your IT team to deploy and manage, then it will lead to inefficiencies that can cut into or completely wipe out any expected ROI.\n\nBefore you settle on a hosting platform, you’ll need to explore how it looks and feels in your environment. Read reviews from reputable technology experts and watch demos online to see the platform in action. You may also be able to take advantage of free trials so you can try before you buy.\n\nFree versus paid-for services\n\nOnce you’ve defined your needs and start exploring options, you might wonder if you can get by using a free email hosting service.\n\nIn some cases, you might be able to get by on the limited features, features, inbox storage and attachment size that comes with free email hosting services, and save some cash each year.\n\nIf your business is small, you can always upgrade to a paid plan as your needs and requirements change.\n\nHowever, skimping on email hosting will not always be the most cost-effective option in the long run. Email is a relatively inexpensive IT service, and paid packages unlock a bounty of productivity-enhancing features and useful integrations that could effectively pay for themselves.\n\nIf you’re already paying for web hosting, you may also be able to add email to your package for a small upcharge.\n\nRelying on free email hosting could also leave your business vulnerable to serious cybersecurity threats. After all, many cybersecurity events start when someone opens an email. Free email hosting services don’t typically come with the additional protections offered in paid packages that can prevent your business from becoming the next victim of a cyberattack.\n\nHow much does email hosting cost?\n\nThe cost of your email hosting service will depend on several factors, including the size of your business, the tier of the service you are purchasing, the term and payment frequency of your plan, upcharges for add-on features and increased storage capacity, and the hosting environment (multi-tenant versus dedicated hosting).\n\nTo give you an idea of how much an email hosting service typically costs, let’s use three hypothetical businesses as an example. Each business has different email hosting requirements and preferences, and we will compare how much it will cost them to use some of the most popular email hosting services in 2024.\n\nSmall businesses\n\nImagine a small massage parlor in a big city with 25 employees. Most employees don’t spend a lot of time using email, so the parlor doesn’t need a lot of bells and whistles — they just need an email hosting service that provides them with a secure and reliable communications channel.\n\nThe parlor settles on Zoho Mail Workplace plan. It comes with 30GB of mail storage and 5GB of inbox storage per user. At £2.40 per user, they only have to spend £60 a month to ensure everyone is connected.\n\nMedium businesses\n\nOur hypothetical medium-sized company uses its 100 employees to deliver marketing services in its local region. It needs a fast and reliable email hosting service that offers enough web space and bandwidth for its multiple websites, and that includes some advanced features such as caching, backups and priority support. It also needs some custom domain and branding options to enhance its professional image.\n\nThe medium-sized business subscribes to SiteGround’s GoGeek plan because they like the fixed amount for each website they host, and that each domain comes with support for unlimited email accounts.\n\nThe cost for this plan would be £6.99 per month for the first year and £34.99 per month afterward.\n\nLarger businesses\n\nOur theoretical large business is a financial services provider with 500 employees and multiple offices. They lean on Google Workspace for their email hosting needs because of its scalable architecture that offers as much storage as needed, advanced security features and compliance controls. It also fills their need for productivity and collaboration tools to enhance its workflow and communication.\n\nFor this large business, the Enterprise plan would be the best option, as it includes custom and secure business email, 1,000 participant video meetings with recording, attendance tracking, noise cancellation, in-domain live streaming, as much storage as needed, S/MIME encryption for emails, advanced security, management and compliance controls, and premium support.\n\nThe cost for this plan has custom pricing depending on the number of users and features required. For 500 users, assuming they need an average of 10GB of storage per user, the estimated cost would be around £24 per user per month with a yearly plan or £29 per user per month with a monthly plan. For 500 users, the total cost would be around £12,000 per month with a yearly plan or £14,500 per month with a monthly plan.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo choose the email hosting providers for this ranking, Forbes Advisor compared each company based on important factors that include features and pricing.\n\nWe ranked each company on these factors based on a five-star rating system, with the highest score being five out of five stars. Our criteria were similar to that we applied to our guide to the best web hosting services but with some changes to account for email-specific needs.\n\nPricing\n\nEmail hosting pricing models and total costs were evaluated based on per-user pricing and volume discounting. Those providers whose pricing was considered to be cheap or midrange fared the best. Pricing accounted for 30% of our weighted scoring.\n\nFeatures\n\nWe compared email hosting providers based on their functions and features, giving preference to providers with the most useful features and tools. Among these included whether a provider offered security tools and calendar functionality, made a mobile app available, offered inbox sizes of at least 20 GB and allowed for attachment sizes of at least 10 MB.
