        "text": "Improved PageSpeed Insights & Other Website Performance Test Results\n\nAs you can probably tell by now, website performance is critical to me. I care about it because a high-performing website and a quality design, layout, and SEO strategy can all contribute to more organic search traffic to my site.\n\nOrganic reach is my primary marketing strategy, followed by social media reach and direct referrals. I am so obsessed with measuring my site’s performance that I regularly use web speed test tools like PageSpeed Insights. If you’ve come across my ChemiCloud review via a search engine and got this far in reading it, I’m on the right track.\n\nOne of the most frustrating things about my website-building journey is never having near-perfect PageSpeed Insight test scores. No matter how often I changed the design and layout of my web pages, added or changed web speed plugins, or even changed hosting companies, I could never achieve good test scores.\n\nEven if I could achieve good scores for my site homepage desktop version, my mobile version scores would barely get past 50/100. This should be better because more website traffic comes from mobile devices than desktop computers or laptops. My blog posts’ test scores were just bad altogether. However, when I was considering finally giving up, I found ChemiCloud.\n\nChemiCloud’s Impact on my PageSpeed Insight Scores\n\nSince switching to ChemiCloud web hosting, my website has finally been able to perform well. I have the PageSpeed Insight test scores above to prove it.\n\nTo be clear, ChemiCloud ALONE did not improve my PageSpeed Insight scores to what you see above. It did for the desktop version of my homepage. However, the mobile version of my homepage only got up to around 70/100. The desktop version of my blog posts’ scores would be within 75/100 to 85/100, while their mobile versions would still only hover within 50/100 to 70/100.\n\nI had to play around with LiteSpeed Cache‘s many settings to achieve the near-perfect PageSpeed Insight scores above. LiteSpeed Cache is an all-in-one website-optimizing WordPress plugin similar to WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, SiteGround Optimizer, Perfmatters, and more. I also useQUIC.cloud CDN instead of the more popularCloudFlare CDN because it is more compatible with LiteSpeed Cache’s features.\n\nIn addition to testing LiteSpeed Cache’s settings, I also had to ensure my website was well-designed with Elementor. I use Elementor to design my entire website from scratch. I had to make sure my web page layouts were well-designed so they could load quickly. This required more trial and error than LiteSpeed Cache’s settings, including entire redesigns.\n\nWorking through LiteSpeed Cache and Elementor was not easy. It took time and a lot of trial and error. However, I finally found the proper setup to help achieve acceptable PageSpeed Insights scores for both the desktop and mobile versions of most of my web pages.\n\nEven better, LiteSpeed Cache is the ONLY optimizing plug I need. I would have had more than one optimizing plugin in the past, but still, I would not have achieved good scores. Not anymore!\n\nRead More: My LiteSpeed Cache Settings for my Elementor-built Website >>>\n\nSteady Increase in Organic Search Traffic\n\nAs expected, a high-performing and well-designed website with a good SEO strategy would help increase organic search traffic to your website. Looking at the nearby chart, you will see that this is now the case for my website.\n\nIf you look at the chart, my Google search impressions and clicks began increasing steadily since switching to ChemiCloud web hosting in June 2023. In fact, before the end of that June, I had reached an all-time high in clicks. Yes, there is a brief period of decline and leveling in search traffic. However, this is when I optimized my website’s design and tested LiteSpeed Cache settings. Once completed, my search traffic has steadily increased.\n\nSeeing this amount of search traffic to my website has always been a goal of mine. It is my ideal primary marketing strategy. However, it took four years and three hosting provider switches to reach this point finally. Also, with ChemiCloud, my website took about three months to see these traffic levels. It would have been earlier. However, finding the right design and optimizing settings took me longer than expected.\n\nAbout ChemiCloud\n\nNow that I’ve explained why I like ChemiCloud and the impact it has had on my website so far, I will pivot this ChemiCloud hosting review to talk about its:\n\nUpbringing and growth\n\nValues!\n\nFeatures behind their positive impact on my website.\n\nHosting plans and their costs.\n\nAdd-on features and services\n\nCustomer support and feedback\n\nCompetitors\n\nHistory Timeline\n\nChemiCloud is a reasonably new hosting company in the market. However, based on the quality of their hosting performance, you would think they’re veterans in the market. They were founded in 2016 with two main goals:\n\nCreate a reliable cloud hosting platform.\n\nOffer the best customer experience in the web hosting industry.\n\nIt did not take long for ChemiCloud to achieve these goals and reap the benefits of doing so quickly. In only one year, they gained well over 1,000 customers. The growth and feedback were so tremendous that they were awarded User’s Top Choice on HostAdvice in 2018, the number five spot.\n\nHostAdvice is a leading source for expert advice and customer reviews on web hosting and other tools necessary to build and grow a successful website. Today, ChemiCloud ranks number three on HostAdvice for Best Web Hosting.\n\nAlso, in 2018, ChemiCloud began upgrading its hosting infrastructure. The goal for the upgrades was to accommodate the influx of new customers while also maintaining and improving the high quality of service they were being rewarded for having. Their first upgrade was switching servers toLiteSpeed Web Server for top-speed performance.\n\nThe second upgrade came in 2019 when ChemiCloud added more data centers in the United Kingdom, Singapore, and India. By 2020, they increased the backend resources for their shared hosting plans. Finally, as of 2021, ChemiCloud’s team grew to 13 people.\n\nValues\n\nI must say, ChemiCloud is one of the few companies that I can attest to actually living up to their values, which are:\n\nBeing independent\n\nBeing an easy-to-use hosting provider\n\nTransparency\n\nGoing the extra mile\n\nRecognizing that their customers are its biggest asset.\n\nIndependently Owned Web Hosting Service\n\nUnlike many other more popular hosting providers, ChemiCloud is independent. In fact, they are one of the few successful privately-owned web hosting services on the market.\n\nHaving an independent hosting provider is now more critical than ever. In recent years, there has been a trend of large publicly traded companies acquiring smaller hosting companies. While this may seem reasonable, it can be detrimental to the quality of customer service.\n\nBetter Customer Service\n\nIn general, independently owned hosting companies like ChemiCloud are the best web hosting choices because they focus more on customer service and satisfaction. They are vested in keeping their customers happy because they rely on them for their business. This means they are more likely to provide personalized support and go above and beyond to solve any issues.\n\nMore Flexible and Adaptable\n\nAnother advantage of independent hosting companies like ChemiCloud is that they are often more flexible and adaptable than their larger counterparts. They can respond quickly to changes in market and customer needs without going through multiple layers of bureaucracy. This means that they are more likely to offer innovative solutions and stay ahead of the curve regarding technology.\n\nStrong Sense of Community with Customers\n\nFinally, independent hosting companies like ChemiCloud are likelier to have a strong sense of community and identity. They are often run by people passionate about web hosting and technology, so they are more invested in their customers’ success. This can lead to a more collaborative and supportive relationship between the hosting company and its customers, which is invaluable in the ever-changing landscape of the Internet.\n\nCons of Hosting Services Owned by Large Publicly-Traded Companies\n\nOn the other hand, hosting services that large publicly traded companies own may prioritize profit over customer satisfaction. These companies have shareholders to answer to, so their primary goal is often to maximize profits. This can lead to cost-cutting measures that negatively impact the quality of service provided to customers. For example, these companies may outsource customer support to countries with lower labor costs, resulting in language barriers and poor communication.\n\nAccording to WPShout, an example of a large publicly traded company that owns a lot of hosting services, in addition to other related services, is called Endurance International Group (EIG), now known as Newfound Digital. With a market cap of around $800 million, EIG owns some familiar names in the web hosting and managing market, such as:\n\nBlueHost\n\nHostGator\n\nConstant Contact (email marketing)\n\nGoDaddy\n\nEasy-to-Use Platform\n\nChemiCloud strives to make using its hosting service as easy as possible. Their platform is designed well enough to:\n\nBe accessible on mobile devices\n\nFind the settings and tools you need in a user-friendly manner.\n\nReduce learning curves for beginners.\n\nThis is necessary for beginner website builders, creators, and small business owners. We need the ability to access the backend of our websites on any device and clearly make whatever changes we need.\n\nWhether setting up email accounts, managing files, installing software, or monitoring website performance, ChemiCloud helps reduce the many learning curves of website management and makes it easier to accomplish our goals by providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate platform. This leads to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nTransparency\n\nChemiCloud prides itself on transparency with its services, pricing, and policies. Unlike many of its competitors, particularly those under large companies, as discussed earlier, ChemiCloud does not have any hidden fees within its hosting plans. They do not believe in offering “unlimited plans” that come with costly upgrades later.\n\nThe prices you will see later in this ChemiCloud review are what you will pay, nothing more. At the same time, their terms and policies are straightforward.\n\nGo the Extra Mile\n\nBased on my experience with ChemiCloud, they go the extra mile in almost everything they provide. They have been focused on delivering real value in their hosting service. That value is now evident in how well my website performs compared to before under different hosting services.\n\nChemiCloud also goes the extra mile to build a fast and knowledgeable customer support team. Later in my ChemiCloud review, I will discuss my experience with their customer service in more detail. For now, know that it is pretty good.\n\nCustomers are the Biggest Asset\n\nAs previously discussed, ChemiCloud is independently owned and operated. Therefore, its customers are their biggest asset. As a result, for ChemiCloud to be profitable, its main objective is to do right by its customers and ensure their experience is superb.\n\nYou would think that all hosting companies would have this mindset, regardless of whether or not it is independent. Unfortunately, this is not the case for all companies. However, it certainly is for ChemiCloud. That is why they stand out as one of the best web hosting services today. My experience with them as a customer has been excellent so far.\n\nFeatures\n\nChemiCloud web hosting is packed with plenty of advanced and useful features. All of them collectively help ChemiCloud be one of the best web hosting services to consider.\n\nTo be clear, my knowledge and expertise in web hosting technology are limited. Therefore, I am writing this section to identify ChemiCloud’s features and explain why they are great for beginner web developers, creators, and small business owners like myself.\n\nSome of ChemiCloud’s highlight features, which I will expand on in detail throughout this section, include:\n\nCloud Infrastructure\n\nLiteSpeed Web Server Integration\n\nDaily Backups\n\nAdvanced Firewall\n\nEasy Website Management\n\nFree emails\n\nStaging\n\nMobile Responsive\n\nAnd more!\n\nTechnology Used for Superb Website Performance\n\nChemiCloud uses a cloud-based infrastructure to provide superb performance to the websites it hosts. Cloud infrastructure in web hosting is becoming increasingly popular among businesses and website owners. Instead of relying on a single physical server to host a website, cloud infrastructure utilizes a network of virtual servers to offer scalable and flexible hosting solutions.\n\nHosting websites in the cloud ensures they are always protected against failure. This allows websites to handle traffic surges, maintain uptime, and provide faster load times. In addition, this method is cost-effective, reliable, and secure. In this section, I will share the technology ChemiCloud uses to make up its cloud infrastructure.\n\nLiteSpeed Web Server\n\nLiteSpeed Web Server is an advanced, high-performance software designed to deliver faster website performance and improved website security. Its compatibility with popular Apache features makes it an excellent alternative to Nginx, which other popular web hosting providers use. As a result, they can boost website performance without making any changes to the web application.\n\nLiteSpeed Web Server provides a range of benefits, including:\n\nFaster website speed: LiteSpeed Web Server is known for superior performance. It can serve static content up to five times quicker and dynamic range up to 40 times faster than Apache and Nginx. This results in faster page load times, which can improve user experience and increase website traffic.\n\nImproved scalability: LiteSpeed Web Server is capable of handling a large number of concurrent connections without reducing performance. This makes it ideal for websites that receive high traffic volumes.\n\nBetter security: LiteSpeed Web Server provides advanced security features, such as mod_security support and anti-DDoS protection. This can help protect websites from all kinds of potential attacks.\n\nEasy-to-use control panel: LiteSpeed Web Server includes an easy-to-use web-based control panel that allows website owners to manage their server settings and configurations without needing advanced technical skills.\n\nCost-effective: LiteSpeed Web Server is a cost-effective solution for website owners. It requires fewer resources than Apache or Nginx and can also be used on smaller servers.\n\nLiteSpeed Cache Plugin\n\nOne crucial aspect of the LiteSpeed Web Server, which all ChemiCloud-hosted websites benefit from, is automatic access to the LiteSpeed Cache Plugin. It is a FREE and included alternative to popular cache plugins for WordPress, such as:\n\nWP Rocket\n\nWP-Optimize\n\nW3 Total Cache\n\nSiteGround Optimizer\n\nAnd more\n\nLiteSpeed Cache is better than all of these plugins. If set up correctly, it can boost the performance of your website. In addition, it will be the ONLY plugin you will need to optimize your website. It optimizes everything, including images. No more feeling like you need more than one optimization plugin for your website.\n\nFinally, LiteSpeed Cache integrates very well with CloudFlare CDN. However, LiteSpeed also enables users to integrate with CloudFlare’s ONLY viable alternative, QUIC.cloud CDN. Most importantly, it is free and included with your ChemiCloud WordPress Hosting Plan.\n\nRead More: My LiteSpeed Cache Settings for my Elementor-built Websites Using Elementor >>>\n\nQUIC.cloud CDN\n\nAgain, QUIC.cloud CDN is the only genuinely viable alternative to the well-known CloudFlare CDN. LiteSpeed owns QUIC.cloud, which is part of its web server infrastructure. My ideal setup for ChemiCloud hosting customers is to utilize all LiteSpeed Web Server tech products for our websites to achieve maximum performance.\n\nBeing designed to work seamlessly with LiteSpeed web servers is one of QUIC.cloud CDN’s key benefits. This means it is highly optimized for LiteSpeed-powered websites and can deliver faster and more efficient performance than other CDN solutions, such as CloudFlare.\n\nQUIC.cloud CDN offers a range of features that improve website performance, including image optimization, dynamic content caching, and global content delivery through its network of servers.\n\nQUIC.cloud CDN & ChemiCloud Hosting Plans\n\nChemiCloud hosting plans’ integration with QUIC.cloud CDN also includes FREE access to their LiteSpeed Enterprise tier. This means we have access to hundreds of free credits for bandwidth by region and thousands for image optimization. Speaking of bandwidth by region, keep reading to learn more about ChemiCloud’s server locations.\n\nServer Locations\n\nChemiCloud has global data centers in eleven locations worldwide, which customers can choose from. This is so you can host your website precisely where you need it so your viewers can access it quickly. ChemiCloud’s server locations include:\n\nUnited States/Canada\n\nDallas, Texas\n\nSan Francisco, California\n\nNew York, New York\n\nToronto, Canada\n\nEurope\n\nLondon, United Kingdom\n\nFrankfurt, Germany\n\nBucharest, Romania\n\nSydney, Australia\n\nAsia\n\nSingapore\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nMumbai, India\n\nI recommend choosing a data center close to most of your website’s potential audience. For example, selecting the New York data center is best if you run a local business on the East Coast. However, if your audience is all of the U.S. or worldwide, but you are based in the U.S., choose Dallas because it is the most centrally located server.\n\nHTTP/3 Protocol\n\nHTTP/3 is the newest version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) being developed. It is designed to improve website loading speed and performance by addressing the limitations of its predecessor, HTTP/2. One of the critical features of HTTP/3 is its ability to reduce latency, which is the time it takes for a request to be sent from the client to the server and for the response to be sent back to the client.\n\nHTTP/3 uses a new transport protocol called QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) instead of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 use. This is where QUIC.cloud comes in. QUIC is designed to be faster and more reliable than TCP, especially in situations where there is packet loss or latency. This is because QUIC is built on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), a faster and more lightweight protocol than TCP.\n\nLiteSpeed Web Server infrastructure includes access to HTTP/3. The overall benefit of HTTP/3 protocol integration with LiteSpeed Web Servers is that it can significantly improve website performance, especially for mobile users. By reducing latency and packet loss, websites can load faster and provide a better user experience. I can attest to this for my website. As a result, my mobile traffic has increased more than my desktop traffic.\n\nAdditionally, HTTP/3 and QUIC can improve website security by encrypting all traffic by default, making it more difficult for hackers to intercept and steal sensitive information. Integrating HTTP/3 protocol with LiteSpeed Web Servers is a significant step in improving website performance and security.\n\nPHP 8+\n\nPHP is a widely used programming language that powers many websites on the Internet. In recent years, several updates have been made to PHP, including the latest version, PHP 8. With each release, PHP brings new features, better performance, and improved security.\n\nOne great thing about using ChemiCloud as your web hosting provider is that you can choose which PHP version you want to use. This is important because not all websites are built with the same requirements, and some may need an older version of PHP to function correctly.\n\nWhile PHP versions go back to 5.6, the current version is 8.2. The lowest PHP version ChemiCloud allows its customers to choose from is 8.0. PHP 8 and above bring significant improvements in terms of performance and security.\n\n100% NVME Storage\n\nOne of the benefits of ChemiCloud hosting plans is that they use 100% NVMe storage. NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) is a type of solid-state storage that is faster and more reliable than traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) and even older solid-state drives (SSDs).\n\nNVMe storage can access data much faster than traditional storage methods. This is because NVMe uses a more streamlined communication protocol between the storage device and the computer’s processor. This results in faster read and write speeds, directly translating to faster website loading times.\n\nFaster load times can improve visitors’ experience and increase engagement. This can also improve your website’s search engine rankings, as search engines like Google prioritize websites that load quickly.\n\nIn addition to faster load times, NVMe storage offers improved reliability and durability. Because it uses flash memory instead of spinning disks, fewer moving parts can break or wear out over time. This means website owners can expect their data to be safer and more secure with NVMe storage.\n\nAMD EPYC Performance\n\nAMD EPYC is a high-performance server processor that ChemiCloud uses to power its web hosting services. This processor offers up to 64 cores and 128 threads and is designed to handle heavy workloads easily.\n\nChemiCloud uses an AMD EPYC 7000 series CPU. It offers excellent single-core and multi-core performance. They are capable of handling heavy workloads with ease. Overall, it makes everything run better in the cloud.\n\nGIT Integration\n\nDepending on your needs, you may or may not need GIT integration. It can provide enhanced performance, security, and flexibility. Git is a popular version control system that allows developers to collaborate on projects and keep track of changes made to code. With Git integration, developers can quickly push and pull code changes from their local machines to their web servers. This makes it easy to manage code changes and deploy updates to your website.\n\nChemiCloud’s Git integration is easy to set up and use, and it works seamlessly with popular code management tools like GitHub and Bitbucket. Overall, if you are a developer looking for a reliable hosting provider with Git integration, ChemiCloud is worth considering.\n\nEasy Website Management\n\nChemiCloud is built with easy website management for beginners like us. Its Control Panel is designed to help us operate our website conveniently and clearly.\n\nMobile Responsive\n\nChemiCloud understands that we’re on our phones more than laptops or desktops. That is why they made sure they optimized their interface for mobile devices. So, whether you need to pay an invoice, make a purchase, contact customer support, or change some backend settings for your website, you can do it all on your phone.\n\nOne-click App Installer\n\nWith ChemiCloud, you can easily install plenty of web-based apps and services for your website. While WordPress and its many apps and plugins are popular for website building, ChemiCloud ensures users have other options. The amount of apps ChemiCloud offers is almost unheard of in the mainstream hosting market.\n\nBackup & Restore Data\n\nChemiCloud also understands how important it is for website builders to protect their work. While other web hosting providers will limit this feature or not provide it at all, ChemiCloud backs up your website daily. In addition, they will store the daily backups for up to 30 days. Users can restore any of those backups at any time.\n\nFree Emails\n\nWhen creating a website for your blog, personal brand, or small business, you want to ensure that your hosting provider provides free emails. Not all of them do, forcing you to pay for services like Google Workplace or Microsoft 365. Ideally, you want a business email matching your website’s domain. Not only does it make you look more professional, but it adds credibility from your visitor’s perspective. Therefore, it should be included in your hosting plan.\n\nThankfully, ChemiCloud allows users to create an unlimited number of email accounts. Users can even adjust how much memory is allocated to emails. The best part is that ChemiCloud ensures that email accounts are secure and always protected. At the same time, they ensure that emails are ALWAYS sent to the customer’s or recipient’s inbox instead of the spam folder. More details on how they do this are in the next section about security.\n\nAdvanced Security\n\nAs a website owner, you must ensure that your site is safe from any potential threats that can cause harm to your business. That is why ChemiCloud has various advanced security features to ensure your website’s safety and security. Overall, they take website security very seriously, and their security features are top-notch. These features are included with all hosting plans, so you don’t have to worry about paying extra for them. By choosing ChemiCloud as your web hosting provider, you can rest assured that your website is in safe hands.\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication\n\nTwo-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your website by adding an extra step in the login process into your hosting account. You would log into your account and receive a confirmation notification via an authentication app on your phone. From that app, you confirm that you are trying to log in. In the era of increased hacking via simply obtaining one’s login password, two-factor authentication for ANY account, not just ChemiCloud, is vital to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nAccount Isolation\n\nBoth of ChemiCloud’s shared hosting plans use CageFS. It is a virtual file system that completely isolates each user’s website and processes data in a CloudLinux dedicated virtual environment. This level of account isolation helps improve server performance, stability, and security. It also ensures that one user’s website does not hinder the performance of another on the same server, as alluded to earlier.\n\nAdvanced Firewall\n\nChemiCloud uses Imunify360 to provide its hosted websites with advanced firewall protection. They use a multi-layered approach to protect websites against malicious attacks, including brute force. They also use machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to detect and prevent threats before they can cause damage to your website. Finally, Imunify360 also includes a comprehensive firewall that blocks known and unknown attacks and a robust intrusion detection system that alerts you about suspicious activity on your website.\n\nSome of the benefits of using Imunify360 with your ChemiCloud web hosting plan include:\n\nAdvanced malware scanning and removal tools\n\nReal-time protection against known and unknown threats\n\nA robust firewall that blocks malicious traffic\n\nIntrusion detection system that alerts you to any suspicious activity on your website\n\nAutomatic updates to keep your website protected against the latest threats\n\nDDoS Protection\n\nChemiCloud offers DDoS protection for its customers. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can bring down a website by overwhelming traffic from multiple sources. ChemiCloud’s DDoS protection can help prevent these attacks from disrupting your website’s performance and availability. It detects, analyzes, and blocks attacks in real-time. It uses advanced filtering techniques to block malicious traffic and keep your website up and running smoothly. With ChemiCloud’s DDoS protection, you can have peace of mind knowing that your website is secure and protected from malicious attacks.\n\nMariaDB\n\nMariaDB is a popular open-source relational database management system that many web hosting providers, including ChemiCloud, use. It is a community-driven fork of MySQL and is designed to be a drop-in replacement for MySQL with more advanced features and improved performance. Its key benefits include improved performance, enhanced security, and better scalability.\n\nPremium DNS\n\nChemiCloud offers its customers Premium DNS, a more reliable and secure version of the basic DNS service that is included with other hosting providers. With Premium DNS, your website’s domain name system (DNS) records are hosted on multiple servers in various geographic locations, making it more resistant to DDoS attacks and other cyber attacks.\n\nAdditionally, the Premium DNS service ensures faster website loading times and better email deliverability by using a global network of DNS servers. ChemiCloud’s Premium DNS service is an excellent option for website owners who want to improve their online security and performance.\n\nEmail Protection and Deliverability\n\nAs mentioned earlier, ChemiCloud provides users with free, unlimited email accounts. They also ensure those email accounts are safe and secure, so sent emails always arrive in their recipients’ inboxes, not their spam folders.\n\nFREE Secure Email Connection\n\nUsers can send emails with free SSL encryption. This helps prevent third parties from hacking the contents of the email and keeps data safe and secure.\n\nHigh Email Delivery\n\nChemiCloud partners with MailChannels to ensure emails from your domain email are always delivered to the recipient’s inbox. MailChannels uses sophisticated algorithms and machine learning to identify spam-like trends and stop them in their tracks.\n\nAdvanced Spam Filtering\n\nWith ChemiCloud’s advanced spam filtering in the control panel, users can:\n\nAdjust the spam threshold score so…\n\n…spam can be automatically detected and deleted\n\nConfigure email allowlist and blocklist settings.\n\nStaging\n\nLike emails, staging is another feature all web hosting providers should provide their users for free. However, many either do not offer it at all or place restrictions on its quality or use. Thankfully, ChemiCloud offers users free staging sites.\n\nStaging creates a decoy of your website for those who may not know. The purpose of the decoy is to test potential changes to your website without your visitors seeing those changes. Staging ensures that your site’s as-is visitor experience remains uninterrupted while you try changes you may want to make.\n\nPlans & Pricing\n\nChemiCloud offers four types of hosting services for potential customers to choose from. However, if you are a beginner website builder, blogger, creator, or small business owner, check out the Shared Hosting and WordPress Hosting services, especiallyWordPress Hosting. The other two hosting services are more for larger businesses and advanced web developers.\n\nWhether you choose my recommended WordPress Hosting service or the Shared Hosting one, both have plenty of advanced features and capabilities. They include:\n\nEssentials\n\nCreate a Site Easily\n\nAdd Collaborators\n\nAdd-on Apps and Products\n\nUnlimited bandwidth\n\nFree Domain Registration or Transfer\n\nFree SSL Certificate\n\nPowered by LiteSpeed\n\nUnlimited subdomains\n\nImmediate Account Activation\n\n24/7 Support\n\nSoftaculous 1-Click Install\n\nMultiple Server Locations\n\n45 Days MoneyBack Guarantee\n\nSecurity\n\n99% uptime guarantee\n\nReliable Cloud Platform\n\nWeb Application Firewall\n\nRebootless Secure Kernel\n\nCloudLinux OS\n\nAccount Isolation\n\n24/7/365 Proactive Server Monitoring\n\n24/7 Network Monitoring\n\nWebsite Performance\n\nLiteSpeed Cache\n\nHTTP/3\n\nFree CloudFlare CDN\n\nMultiple Server Locations\n\nNVMe Storage\n\nLeverage Browser Caching\n\nGZIP Compression\n\nKeep-Alive\n\nCSS/JS/HTML Minification\n\nEmail Features\n\n50 MB email attachment size\n\nEmail forwarders\n\nEmail aliases\n\nWebmail\n\nIMAP/POP3/STMP\n\nMail Client Setup\n\nMailChannels\n\nCatch-all Email\n\nSPF & DKIM Support\n\nSpam Filters\n\nEmail Autoresponders\n\nDeveloper Features\n\nMultiple PHP versions\n\nPHP Selector\n\nSoftaculous 1-Click App Installer\n\nApplication Autoupdates\n\nMariaDB 10.5 MySQL Version\n\nUnlimited MySQL Databases\n\nRemote MySQL Access\n\nPostgreSQL 13 Version\n\nphpMyAdmin\n\nNodeJS Support\n\nPython Support\n\nBash Support\n\nPerl Support\n\nLaravel\n\nSymfony\n\nSSH and SFTP Access\n\nMod_rewrite for SEO URLs\n\nPreinstalled GIT\n\nCustom Cron Jobs\n\nWordPress Hosting (RECOMMENDED)\n\nI recommend the WordPress Hosting service, specifically the Turbo plan. Seven times out of ten, whatever website you build will most likely be built with WordPress. Other options typically include Wix, Squarespace, Hubspot, or Shopify. WordPress is usually the default website builder if you go to (or are trying to switch from) other hosting providers.\n\nTherefore, it is essential to have a hosting plan for your website built specifically for what you will most likely use to create it. At the same time, you want to ensure you can use everything available to you so that your website performs best for your visitors. This way, you can ensure your website will shine over your competition. ChemiCloud’s WordPress Hosting Turbo Plan is designed to help your website achieve maximum performance and commercial success.\n\nWhy Use WordPress?\n\nI will be honest: WordPress is less user-friendly than it claims to be. At first, beginners like me can face several learning curves. WordPress has many themes, plugins, and setup options that can become overwhelming without knowledge. However, they are not as bad as you may think. Based on experience, getting the hang of WordPress as you use it and progress with building your website is pretty easy.\n\nHowever, if you want to build a successful website, you have to be willing to master WordPress, which is now the go-to platform for website building. WordPress is:\n\nOpen-source, which means anyone can use it without paying for a license.\n\nVersatile, which means it can be used to create any website, from personal blogs to e-commerce stores and corporate websites.\n\nSEO-friendly, meaning sites built on the platform are more likely to rank well in search engine results pages.\n\nSecure: Updates and patches are constantly released to address any security vulnerabilities in the platform.\n\nALL WordPress Hosting Features\n\nChemiCloud took its standard Shared Hosting service (described in the next section) and tweaked it to optimize the server environment for WordPress. As a result, these websites can enjoy even faster page load times, a higher level of protection, and other WordPress-exclusive features.\n\nIn addition to all of the master features listed above, WordPress Hosting plans come with:\n\nOne-click WordPress installs\n\nWordPress staging\n\nLiteSpeed Cache pre-installed\n\n24/7 WordPress assistance from ChemiCloud’s customer service\n\nUnlimited PostgreSQL Databases\n\nWP-CLI (command-line interface for WordPress)\n\nWordPress Hosting Plans & Pricing\n\nChemiCloud’s WordPress Hosting service comes with three pricing plans. The higher the plan, the more features, capabilities, and storage you will get. The three pricing plans are:\n\nStarter\n\nPro\n\nTurbo (which I recommend)\n\nWordPress Starter Plan\n\nThe WordPress Starter plan is the most entry-level plan ChemiCloud provides for WordPress websites. It provides the minimum required hosting services to help users on a budget get their first project off the ground.\n\nStarter Pricing\n\nPricing structures below include a 70% off the special price, excluding the monthly rate.\n\nMonthly = $13.95\n\nAnnually = $4.19/month = $50.22 total for the first year; $13.95/month = $167.40 for future annual plan renewals.\n\nFirst 24 Months (3 years) = $3.59/month = $86.04 total; $11.95/month = $286.80 for future two-year plan renewals.\n\nFirst 36 Months (3 years) = $2.99/month = $107.46 total; $9.95/month = $358.20 for future three-year plan renewals.\n\nIncluded Features\n\nThe WordPress Hosting Starter plan is the most affordable and entry-level of all pricing tiers. In addition to the master list of features above, users with WordPress Starter will only get the following:\n\nONE WEBSITE\n\n20 GB of NVMe storage\n\nTEN days of backups\n\nONE CPU Core\n\nONE GB of RAM memory\n\n250,000 Inodes\n\nTWO GB limit of mailbox storage per email account\n\nExcluded Features\n\nHowever, with this tier, there are NO:\n\nUnlimited websites (starts at the PRO plan)\n\nAdd-on domains (begins at the PRO plan)\n\nImunify360 Proactive Defense (starts at the PRO plan)\n\nAdvanced Firewall Protection (starts at the PRO plan)\n\nWordPress Staging (starts at the PRO plan)\n\nMalware Detection (only for the recommended TURBO plan)\n\nMalware Removal (only for the recommended TURBO plan)\n\nAPC (only for the recommended TURBO plan)\n\nOPCache (only for the recommended TURBO plan)\n\nQUIC Protocol (only for the recommended TURBO plan)\n\nRedis object caching (only for the recommended TURBO plan)\n\nWordPress Pro Plan\n\nChemiCloud’s WordPress Hosting Pro plan is a step up from the Starter plan. It provides more useful features and improvements that can help make sure your website(s) perform well.\n\nPro Pricing\n\nPricing structures below include a 70% off special price, excluding the monthly rate.\n\nMonthly = $18.95\n\nAnnually = $5.69/month = $68.22 total; 18.95/month = $227.40 for future annual plan renewals.\n\nFirst 24 Months (2 years) = $5.09/month = $122.04 total; $16.95/month = $406.80 for future two-year plan renewals.\n\nFirst 36 Months (3 years) = $4.79/month = $172.26 total; $15.95/month = $574.20 for future three-year plan renewals.\n\nIncluded Features\n\nAs the mid-tier pricing plan, the WordPress Hosting Pro plan does feature more features and capabilities than the Starter tier. However, it still lacks the more advanced ones that truly make ChemiCloud’s WordPress Hosting great.

They are only available for the recommended WordPress TURBO. The PRO tier still DOES NOT include:\n\nMalware Detection\n\nMalware removal\n\nAPC\n\nOPCache\n\nRedis object caching\n\nQUIC Protocol\n\nWordPress Turbo Plan (RECOMMENDED)\n\nI recommend the WordPress Hosting Turbo plan to ensure your website performs the best. It is perfect for users prioritizing speed and performance for their websites. Not only does it beat the other plans’ capacity, but it provides ALL of ChemiCloud’s server resources and features.\n\nTurbo Pricing\n\nPricing structures below include a 70% off special price, excluding the monthly rate.\n\nMonthly = $22.95\n\nAnnually = $6.89/month = $82.62 total; $22.95/month = $275.40 for future annual plan renewals.\n\nFirst 24 Months (2 years) = $6.29/month = $150.84 total; $20.95/month = $502.80 for future two-year plan renewals.\n\nFirst 36 Months (3 years) = $5.99/month = $215.46 total; $19.95/month = $718.20 for future three-year plan renewals.\n\nI recommend you invest in the WordPress Hosting Turbo plan, even if it is just the annual payment option. You will receive ALL of ChemiCloud’s WordPress Hosting features and capabilities. This includes the more advanced ones to solidify a high chance of your website performing well for your potential visitors as soon as possible.\n\nWith WordPress TURBO, you will get:\n\n3x more CPU & RAM\n\n4x more traffic handled\n\nTurbo Cache, which includes OPCache, APC, and Redis\n\nFREE Malware Scanner & Removal\n\nIncluded + Exclusive Features\n\nA complete list of exclusive WordPress Turbo features and capabilities include:\n\n40 GB of NVMe storage\n\n30 days of free backups (daily)\n\nTHREE CPU cores\n\nTHREE GB of RAM Memory\n\n500,000 Inodes\n\nAPC\n\nOPCache\n\nRedis\n\nQUIC Protocol\n\nShared Hosting\n\nIf WordPress is too complicated and too much of a learning curve for you, I completely understand. Fortunately, ChemiCloud understands this too. That is why they also offer a standard Shared Hosting service.\n\nALL Shared Hosting Features\n\nChemiCloud’s Shared Hosting service’s main feature is easily building a website. If you do not want to use WordPress, that’s ok. The Shared Hosting service has a robust drag-and-drop interface to help you easily build a website.\n\nChemiCloud’s robust website builder for its Shared Hosting service includes:\n\nDrag & drop interface\n\nBuilt-in search engine optimization features\n\nMobile responsive\n\nSocial media tools\n\nMultiple language translations\n\nFree domain for life\n\nFree Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate\n\nIf you are entirely unsure about designing your website yourself, which is why you avoided WordPress in the first place, that is okay, too. The Shared Hosting service also comes with over 350 templates to choose from.\n\nSo far, ChemiCloud’s website builder only has templates for the following types of websites:\n\nPersonal\n\nTechnology\n\nTravel\n\nIn addition to the Drag and Drop website builder and its templates, the Shared Hosting service allows you to host websites built with other Softaculous apps besides WordPress, such as:\n\nJoomla\n\nMagneto\n\nDrupal 7\n\nAnd more\n\nShared Hosting Plans & Pricing\n\nJust like WordPress Hosting, the Shared Hosting service has the same three pricing plans:\n\nStarter\n\nPro\n\nTurbo (which I recommend)\n\nShared Starter Plan\n\nChemiCloud’s Shared Starter plan is the most cost-friendly option for beginner website creators and entrepreneurs. Despite being the lowest tier, it provides enough essential hosting services to ensure your first website performs well.\n\nShared Starter Pricing\n\nPricing structures below include a 70% off special price, excluding the monthly rate.\n\nMonthly = $13.95\n\nAnnually = $4.19/month = $50.22 total for the first year; $13.95/month = $167.40 for future annual plan renewals.\n\nFirst 24 Months (3 years) = $3.59/month = $86.04 total; $11.95/month = $286.80 for future two-year plan renewals.\n\nFirst 36 Months (3 years) = $2.99/month = $107.46 total; $9.95/month = $358.20 for future three-year plan renewals.\n\nIncluded Features\n\nThe Shared Starter plan is the most affordable and entry-level plan for ChemiCloud. In addition to the master list of features above, users with the Shared Starter plan will only get:\n\nONE WEBSITE\n\n20 GB of NVMe storage\n\nTen days of backups\n\nONE CPU Core\n\nONE GB of RAM memory\n\n250,000 Inodes\n\nTWO GB limit of mailbox storage per email account\n\nExcluded Features\n\nHowever, with this tier, there are NO:\n\nUnlimited domains (starts at the PRO tier)\n\nAddon domains (starts at the PRO tier)\n\nImunify360 Proactive Defense (starts at the PRO tier)\n\nAdvanced Firewall Protection (starts at the PRO tier)\n\nMalware Detection (only for the recommended TURBO tier)\n\nMalware Removal (only for the recommended TURBO tier)\n\nAPC/OPCache (only for the recommended TURBO tier)\n\nRedis (only for the recommended TURBO tier)\n\nShared Pro Plan\n\nIf you want a more comprehensive hosting service for your website(s), consider the Shared Pro Plan. A step up from the Starter plan, it allows you to build unlimited websites with double the storage capacity.\n\nShared Pro Pricing\n\nPricing structures below include a 70% off special price, excluding the monthly rate.\n\nMonthly = $18.95\n\nAnnually = $5.69/month = $68.22 total; 18.95/month = $227.40 for future annual plan renewals.\n\nFirst 24 Months (2 years) = $5.09/month = $122.04 total; $16.95/month = $406.80 for future two-year plan renewals.\n\nFirst 36 Months (3 years) = $4.79/month = $172.26 total; $15.95/month = $574.20 for future three-year plan renewals.\n\nIncluded Features\n\nAs the mid-tier pricing plan, the Shared Pro plan does have more features and capabilities than the Starter tier. Users on the Shared Pro plan get:\n\nUnlimited domains\n\nUnlimited Add-on domains\n\n30 GB of NVMe Storage\n\n20 days of backups\n\nOne-click backup restore\n\n2x more CPU & RAM\n\n350,000 inodes\n\nTWO CPU Cores\n\nTWO GB of RAM memory\n\nImunify360 Proactive Defense\n\nAdvanced Firewall Protection\n\nUnlimited mailbox storage per email account\n\nExcluded Features\n\nRemember that the Pro plan still lacks the most advanced features and capabilities that truly make ChemiCloud great. They are only available for the recommended TURBO plan. The PRO plan still DOES NOT include:\n\nMalware Detection\n\nMalware removal\n\nAPC/OPCache\n\nRedis\n\nShared Turbo Plan (RECOMMENDED)\n\nLike WordPress Hosting, I also recommend the Turbo plan for Shared Hosting. You will receive ALL of ChemiCloud’s features and capabilities to make your websites perform their best.\n\nTurbo Pricing\n\nPricing structures below include a 70% off special price, excluding the monthly rate.\n\nMonthly = $22.95\n\nAnnually = $6.89/month = $82.62 total; $22.95/month = $275.40 for future annual plan renewals.\n\nFirst 24 Months (2 years) = $6.29/month = $150.84 total; $20.95/month = $502.80 for future two-year plan renewals.\n\nFirst 36 Months (3 years) = $5.99/month = $215.46 total; $19.95/month = $718.20 for future three-year plan renewals.\n\nI recommend you invest in the Shared Turbo plan for the same reasons I recommend the WordPress Turbo plan. As stated earlier, even if it is just the annual plan, you will receive ALL of ChemiCloud’s features and capabilities, including the more advanced ones, to solidify a high chance of your website performing well for your potential visitors.\n\nWith the TURBO tier, you will get:\n\n3x more CPU & RAM\n\n4x more traffic handled\n\nTurbo Cache, which includes OPCache, APC, and Redis\n\nFREE Malware Scanner & Removal\n\nIncluded + Exclusive Features\n\nA full list of exclusive Shared Turbo plan features and capabilities include:\n\n40 GB of NVMe storage\n\n30 days of free backups (daily)\n\nTHREE CPU cores\n\nTHREE GB of RAM Memory\n\n500,000 Inodes\n\nAPC/OPCache\n\nRedis\n\nAdd-on Features & Services\n\nChemiCloud offers users additional add-on features and services to enhance their experience with their current hosting plan. Whether you need more storage or CPU resources, more email features, a different SSL certificate, or more, ChemiCloud has what you need. I advise only buying add-ons you absolutely need because the costs can add up.\n\nSSL Certificates\n\nHaving an SSL certificate for your website is important because it secures your site while adding trust and credibility for your visitors. They help establish an encrypted connection and allow data to transmit securely between a user’s browser and your website’s server. That is why ChemiCloud provides its users with a free SSL certificate for their website. However, that certificate has limited security features. This could cause users to want a more advanced certificate for their website.\n\nBenefits of having an SSL certificate for your website include:\n\nEncrypts communication to protect sensitive information your visitors may give you.\n\nSecures online transactions.\n\nPlace a padlock next to your domain in the browser to prove to visitors your website is legit and secure.\n\nAuthenticates your organization’s identity.\n\nIncreases your website’s search engine rankings.\n\nTypes of SSL Certificates Offered & their Pricing\n\nChemiCloud understands that not all SSL Certificates are the same. They also understand that the free certificate they provide is limited in scope. That is why they provide more advanced SSL certificates as an add-on purchase for your hosting account.\n\nStandard Domain Validation (DV) SSL\n\nThe Standard Domain Validation (DV) SSL Certificates are an immediate step up from the free SSL certificates ChemiCloud provides. An economical and quick way to implement SSL for your website, all it does is to verify that you own the domain, minus organizational level validation. It is ideal for:\n\npersonal websites\n\nBlogs\n\nWebsites that do not transmit private and confidential information.\n\nThere are two levels of Standard DV SSL Certificates:\n\nRapidSSL\n\nAnnually: $19.95\n\nEvery Two Years: $37.91\n\nEvery Three Years: $55.86\n\nGeoTrust QuickSSL Premium\n\nAnnually: $79.95\n\nEvery Two Years: $151.91\n\nEvery Three Years: $223.86\n\nOrganization Validation SSL\n\nOrganization Validation SSL (OV SSL) certificates provide instant identity confirmation for your business. It helps prove to your visitors that a legitimate company operates your website and is not a scam.\n\nWith this type of SSL certificate, you will get a GeoTrust True BusinessID that costs:\n\n$99.95 annually\n\n$189.91 every two years\n\n$279.86 every three years\n\nExtended Validation SSL\n\nExtended Validation SSL (EV SSL) Certificates are today’s highest class of SSL certificates. It provides more trust and credibility for your website than any other advanced SSL certificate. This level of security is recommended for large businesses and e-commerce websites.\n\nWith this type of SSL certificate, you will get a GeoTrust True Business ID with EV that costs:\n\n$178.95 annually\n\n$340.01 every two years\n\n$501.06 every three years\n\nWildcard SSL\n\nWildcard SSL certificates will be an excellent add-on if you plan to create subdomain websites. It allows you to secure unlimited subdomains on a single certificate. It also covers any additional subdomains you add in the future.\n\nWildcard SSL is available for DV and OV SSL Certificates. With a RapidSSL Wildcard, it will cost:\n\n$109.95 annually\n\n$208.91 every two years\n\n$307.86 every three years\n\nDisk Space Add-on\n\nOnly available for Turbo hosting plans, the Disk Space Add-On allows you to increase your storage space by 20 GB. In addition, you will also receive 200,000 additional inodes. As a result, you will have 60 GB of storage space and 700,000 available inodes before considering upgrading to the more advanced and expensive Cloud VPS Hosting services.\n\nThe Disk Space Add-on costs:\n\n$4.95 per month\n\n$53.40 ($4.45/month) every year\n\n$102 ($4.25/month) every two years\n\n$142.20 ($3.95/month) every three years\n\nTurbo+ Boost Add-on\n\nLike the Disk Space Add-on, the Turbo+ Boost Add-on is also available for users on the Turbo plans to increase resources. With the Turbo+ Boost Add-on, you will get double the CPU and memory for more speed, flexibility, and scalability for your websites. The Turbo plans come with 3 CPUs and 3 GB of memory. The Turbo+ Boost Add-on increases resources to 6 CPUs and 6 GB of memory.\n\nThe Turbo+ Boost Add-on costs:\n\n$6.95 per month\n\n$77.40 ($6.45/month) every year\n\n$150 ($6.25/month) every two years\n\n$214.20 ($5.95/month) every three years\n\nThis add-on is ideal if your website(s):\n\nExperience increased website traffic, which the turbo plan alone can no longer consistently support.\n\nImport or export a large amount of data.\n\nUses more complex web apps that require more resources.\n\nUses WordPress with themes or plugins that require more resources, such as Elementor, in addition to traffic increases.\n\nIs an e-commerce website that consumes more resources and gets more traffic.\n\nDedicated IP Address\n\nTypically, when you are on a shared hosting service, your website(s) tend to share IP addresses with other sites on the same server. However, if you run an e-commerce website, it may be ideal for your website to have its own IP address for extra security for your customers.\n\nThe most obvious solution is using ChemiCloud’s VPS hosting services. However, these are more advanced and expensive. That is why ChemiCloud provides users with a Dedicated IP Address add-on service. It will give you a single IP address that is yours and your website only.\n\nThe Dedicated IP Address add-on costs $4 per month per IP. ChemiCloud requires justification other than to improve SEO rankings (because it doesn’t help with this) to use this add-on.\n\nSiteLock™ Add-on\n\nIf securing your website from potential threats is really important to you, consider purchasing the SiteLock™ add-on. They are a global leader in website security. Their add-on for ChemiCloud includes daily malware scanning for vulnerabilities and a trust seal for customer confidence.\n\nSiteLock Plans & Pricing\n\nChemiCloud provides three SiteLock plans to choose from:\n\nFind\n\nFix\n\nDefend\n\nFind\n\nThe Find plan only scans your website for malware and vulnerabilities. It costs:\n\n$19.95 every year\n\n$39.90 every two years\n\n$59.85 every three years\n\nThe Find plan includes:\n\nDaily malware scanning\n\nSupport for up to 25 pages\n\nDaily blocklist monitoring\n\nA SiteLock Risk score\n\nOne-time website application scan\n\nOne-time SQL Injection Scan\n\nOne-time cross-site (XSS) scan\n\nA SiteLock™ trust seal\n\nFix\n\nThe Fix plan helps automatically find and remove malicious code from your website. It costs:\n\n$14.95 per month\n\n$99.95 every year\n\n$179.95 every two years\n\n$249.95 every three years\n\nThe Fix plan includes:\n\nDaily malware scanning\n\nSupport for up to 500 pages\n\nDaily blocklist monitoring\n\nA SiteLock risk score\n\nDaily website application scan\n\nDaily SQL injection scan\n\nDaily cross-site (XSS) scan\n\nA SiteLock™ trust seal\n\nDaily SMART Scans\n\nAutomatic Malware Removal\n\nTrueShield Protection\n\nWordPress Scan\n\nSpam Blacklist Monitoring\n\nDefend\n\nThe Defend Plan is the most robust SiteLock plan provided by ChemiCloud. With website acceleration, it helps find, fix, and prevent potential threats. This plan costs:\n\n$24.95 per month\n\n$275.40 every year\n\n$502.80 every two years\n\n$718.20 every three years\n\nThe Defend Plan includes:\n\nDaily malware scanning\n\nSupport for up to 500 pages\n\nDaily blocklist monitoring\n\nA SiteLock risk score\n\nDaily website application scan\n\nDaily SQL injection scan\n\nDaily cross-site (XSS) scan\n\nA SiteLock™ trust seal\n\nDaily SMART Scans\n\nAutomatic Malware Removal\n\nTrueShield Protection\n\nWordPress Scan\n\nSpam Blacklist Monitoring\n\nWeb Application Firewall\n\nGlobal CDN\n\nContent Acceleration\n\nSiteLock Emergency Response\n\nFinally, SiteLock provides customers an emergency response service if their website is hacked and compromised. For only $169.95 one time for seven days of protection, users receive:\n\nAn immediate response within 30 minutes\n\nComplete malware removal\n\nPriority treatment\n\n7-day aftercare\n\nReal-time updates\n\nIncoming Email Filtering Add-on\n\nChemiCloud already provides its customers robust email security for those who create an email account with their website’s domain. However, they can go a step further with the Incoming Email Filtering add-on service if they want. This service is ideal for users who receive a lot of spam messages in their domain email inboxes. When clicked, those spam messages can contain virus and malware threats.\n\nFor only $25.95, the Incoming Email Filtering add-on features:\n\nExtremely accurate filtering\n\nEasy configuration\n\nIncrease inbound email continuity and redundancy\n\nVarious reporting options\n\nFriendly interface to keep you in complete control over your email\n\nIncrease employee productivity\n\nQueued incoming emails just in case your server goes down.\n\nMarketGoo SEO Tools Add-on\n\nIf you are building your website with WordPress, there are plenty of SEO WordPress plugins to help your website appear in search engine results. I recommend choosing RankMath or Yoast SEO because they are great for blogs. RankMath, in particular, is excellent for setting up rich results and Schema.\n\nHowever, if you plan on using ChemiCloud’s Shared Hosting services because you do not want to use WordPress to build your website, ChemiCloud has its own SEO add-on tool called MarketGoo. It will help your website appear in search engines such as Google so you can increase your website’s traffic and grow your business.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\n\nMarketGoo SEO tool comes with two plans ChemiCloud Shared Hosting users can choose from: Lite and Pro.\n\nLite\n\nFor only $59.88 per year, the Lite Plan includes:\n\nEasy search engine submission\n\nConnect Google Analytics\n\nDownload SEO PDF reports\n\nScan up to 50 pages\n\nTrack up to two competitors\n\nTrack and optimize for up to five keywords\n\nWeekly updated reports and plans\n\nLimited custom SEO plan\n\nMonthly progress reports\n\nPro\n\nFor either $14.99 per month or $179.88 per year, the Pro plan includes\n\nEasy search engine submission\n\nConnect Google Analytics\n\nDownload SEO PDF reports\n\nScan up to 1,000 pages\n\nTrack up to four competitors\n\nTrack and optimize for up to 20 keywords\n\nDaily updated reports and plans\n\nA complete custom SEO plan with a step-by-step guide\n\nMonthly progress report\n\nCustomer Feedback & Support\n\nTwo aspects of ChemiCloud Hosting that solidified my decision to switch to them are:\n\nThe feedback from other current customers.\n\nThe quality of the customer support I received during the initial sign-up process.\n\nCustomer Feedback\n\nI discovered ChemiCloud by reading a review by Tom Dupuis on OnlineMediaMasters. Ironically, I came across his article while searching on Google for a better alternative to my hosting provider at the time. I was anxious to find a new alternative hosting company as soon as possible because I grew tired of what was my second provider not meeting my needs for this website. Since this would be my third hosting provider switch, I took time with my search. I was hoping this third switch would be my last.\n\nThankfully, finding Tom’s article on ChemiCloud did not take long at all. To this day, I believe it was a sign or blessing from God. Tom did a great job describing ChemiCloud, its features, and its upper hand over many of the popular competition, including the hosting provider I had at the time—more on this in the next section.\n\nWhile Tom did a great job in his review, the feedback in his comments ultimately led me to choose ChemiCloud. As a blogger myself, it’s always great when readers come back and leave comments on my blog posts that helped them in any way.\n\nTom’s comments section was filled with people who signed up for ChemiCloud after reading his review. They came back to thank him and share their positive experience so far. Even I came back to his blog post to leave a comment. Now look at me, writing my own ChemiCloud review.\n\nChemiCloud Trustpilot Reviews\n\nDespite being impressed by Tom’s ChemiCloud review and the feedback he was receiving, part of me wanted to gather more user feedback from other sources. Tom, unlike myself, is way more of a tech and website developer expert than me. As a result, I wanted to read more feedback from regular, non-expert users like myself to answer:\n\nHow good is ChemiCloud from the perspective of small business owners and beginner website builders?\n\nCan ChemiCloud be trusted?\n\nLucky for me, Trustpilot has over 500 positive reviews from ChemiCloud users. ChemiCloud has a 5-star rating on Trustpilot, which was an essential factor in my decision to switch. Trustpilot is my go-to source to obtain honest feedback from users of a product or service I am considering buying for myself. I am using Trustpilot more because many companies, including some mainstream web hosting services, allegedly buy positive reviews to hide the accurate feedback of their product or services.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nA common theme in both Trustpilot’s user feedback and Tom’s review user feedback is how outstanding ChemiCloud’s customer support is. Finding a hosting company, or any service in any industry, with consistently good customer service is hard to come by. Therefore, I was intrigued to keep seeing more and more ChemiCloud users share, among other things, how great their experience was with customer support.\n\nSince switching to ChemiCloud, I can attest to how great ChemiCloud’s customer support is overall. They really shined during the free website migration process. Honestly, it was the most stress-free website migration process I’ve ever experienced. ChemiCloud’s support took the time to ensure my website was completely transferred from my old hosting provider. The job was incomplete until EVERYTHING was set up correctly, so I would not need to do anything. They also kept me updated throughout the process.\n\nEven after the initial setup of my website and account, ChemiCloud support remains reliable for minor to mid-level needs. Unlike past web hosting providers, I feel comfortable asking them any questions I have.\n\nHow ChemiCloud’s Customer Support can be Even Better\n\nBefore publishing this ChemiCloud review, I had to revisit this section and tone up my critique of their customer support. I want to give you a more realistic understanding of what to expect from them.\n\nTo be clear, ChemiCloud does have some of the best customer support for a hosting company. Everything I wrote at the beginning is valid. However, as I said initially, they are best helpful for low to mid-level support inquiries. For anything advanced, the quality of support does vary.\n\nMy only real issue is that ChemiCloud needs more of a customer support team that is able and willing to tackle the more advanced problems that we beginners will likely reach out to them about. ChemiCloud provides many advanced features and markets its services to beginners like me. However, sometimes, I find myself being told to speak to a more experienced technician or developer to fix some of my issues. Even though my problems likely stem from a feature ChemiCloud provides.\n\nBuilding a website is complex and requires some advanced knowledge of the practice. I understand this! However, I wish ChemiCloud understood that if they provide many advanced features and markets to beginners, it is incumbent on them to have support staff who are experts at handling more advanced inquiries that independent beginners will likely ask for help with.\n\nEven if that means going into our website to identify the root cause and taking the time to fix it for us. Not everyone knows how to fix unexpected website issues or has the money to pay someone to fix them. I do not know; maybe I am used to my first hosting provider, BlueHost, fixing issues with my website without hesitation.\n\nChemiCloud vs the Competition\n\nBefore switching to ChemiCloud, I used other web hosting services to power my website. Unfortunately, none of them consistently met my needs. Now that I am experiencing the improvements in performance and organic search traffic I’ve been yearning for all these years, I feel like I’ve been wasting time with the other web hosts.\n\nI’m not saying that these other web hosting services are incredibly terrible. They did at least meet my minimum expectations. However, building any website is an investment to grow with you and its purpose, such as your business. Other hosting providers I’ve used before ChemiCloud have not been able to help my website meet all of my expectations, such as organic audience growth.\n\nUsing ChemiCloud has made me realize that I have yet to get a return on my investment. I am now playing catch-up with the progress I should have been making. Oh well, I guess. On the bright side, during my time before ChemiCloud, I’ve learned a lot of new things about myself, such as website building, tips and tricks, my goals for this website, and more. Like how some of these web hosting companies are buying and inflating positive reviews, you know, allegedly.\n\nChemiCloud vs Siteground\n\nSiteground is the website hosting company I used before ChemiCloud. Overall, SiteGround was all right—in fact, they were better than the hosting company I used before them. However, as alluded to earlier, SiteGround could not meet my website’s needs.\n\nHonestly, I did not want to switch away from SiteGround. I tried to make things work with them. I was weary of constantly feeling the need to change hosting services. However, I could not optimize my website with SiteGround as well as ChemiCloud has helped optimize it. At the same time, among other reasons, the random outages were getting out of hand.\n\nSimilarities\n\nNow, ChemiCloud and SiteGround are not 100% different from each other. However, the quality of website performance is. Both SiteGround and ChemiCloud:\n\nAre independently owned\n\nProvide free SSL certificates\n\nProvide free emails\n\nProvide free website staging\n\nKeep daily backups of users’ websites for up to 30 days.\n\nMultiple data centers around the world.\n\nDifferences\n\nSiteGround uses a custom Web Application Firewall for security, and I’m not even sure it was fully effective.\n\nSiteground uses SATA Web Space storage, while ChemiCloud uses NVMe SSD storage.\n\nSiteground uses Google Cloud infrastructure for performance, while ChemiCloud uses LiteSpeed Web Server, a true gold standard.\n\nSiteGound has 10 data centers, while ChemiCloud has 11.\n\nSiteGround has reported issues with their hosted websites crashing.\n\nSiteground prioritizes its custom PHP, which it claims to be faster.\n\nLackluster customer service. They outsource many issues to third parties, resulting in having to pay more to receive certain levels of help.\n\nSiteGround will suspend your account for excessive CPU use, which usually forces users to upgrade their plans.\n\nChemiCloud vs Bluehost\n\nBlueHost is credited with being the first web hosting company I used to launch this website. Overall, they were a decent company, and they exposed me to a lot about building and maintaining a website.\n\nHowever, as my website began to evolve and I understood more about the importance of quality website performance, my faith and trust in BlueHost started to decline. Among other issues, I could not achieve the quality web performance I’m experiencing now with ChemiCloud while using BlueHost, even after upgrading my plan multiple times.\n\nSimilarities\n\nBoth Bluehost and ChemiCloud:\n\nProvide free SSL certificates\n\nProvide daily website backups\n\nProvide malware scanning\n\nProvide free domains\n\nDifferences\n\nBlueHost is not independently owned.\n\nBluehost does not provide free domains or website migrations.\n\nBlueHost does not offer free emails. Must purchase through third parties such as Google Workspace and Microsoft 365.\n\nBlueHost uses SATA Web Space storage, while ChemiCloud uses NVMe SSD storage.\n\nBlueHost only has 6 data centers, while ChemiCloud has 11.\n\nBlueHost doesn’t provide a cache plugin. Users must search through an entire market of cache plugins to find the right one for them.\n\nBluehost customer service is not always the best, especially during [United States] late-night hours.\n\nChemiCloud with WooCommerce vs Shopify for E-commerce\n\nAt one point during my overall website-building journey, I tried to start an e-commerce store. If you cannot tell by the above title, I tried WooCommerce and Shopify in two separate attempts. I honestly would have had a much better chance at success with WooCommerce using ChemiCloud instead of SiteGround and Shopify.\n\nWooCommerce\n\nWooCommerce is a WordPress plugin that allows you to turn your WordPress website into an e-commerce store. It is a free, open-source platform with many flexibility and customization options. However, you must pay for web hosting, domain, and any additional plugins you may need.\n\nWith WooCommerce, you have complete control over your store’s design and functionality. Also, you can add a variety of extensions and plugins to add more features and capabilities. That said, you are building a store from scratch if you’re up for that challenge.\n\nShopify\n\nShopify is a standalone e-commerce platform that is designed specifically for online stores. It is a paid platform that provides convenience and ease of use. Shopify offers a range of built-in features, including payment processing, shipping management, and inventory tracking, which makes it an excellent option for businesses that want an all-in-one solution.\n\nShopify offers different pricing plans depending on your needs and budget. All pricing plans include hosting, domain registration, and many built-in features.\n\nAfter failing with WooCommerce, I went ahead with Shopify for its convenience. At one point, I even moved my entire website idea to Shopify and tried to merge it with the store I created. However, keep reading to learn why using Shopify was still insufficient for me.\n\nWhy WooCommerce and Not Shopify for E-Commerce\n\nListen, I understand that an open-source platform like WooCommerce, where you have to build and set up everything on your own, can be nerve-wracking. It seems easier to choose Shopify to have everything up and running immediately. I get it. However, remember what I said earlier: a website is an investment.\n\nWith WooCommerce, you can control the features and plugins you want running and hosting. This way, you can decide which hosting provider can best meet the needs of your online store. Also, you only pay for plugins you intend to use for your store. Remember, the key to success with any website, not just e-commerce, is how well that website can perform. Your website functions best with a robust hosting provider and limited active plugins.\n\nOn the other hand, you do not have that level of control with Shopify. You literally get what you pay for. Whatever you paid for and are not trying to use is still loading or running on the backend of your website, slowing down its performance. At the same time, you’re stuck at the mercy of Shopify’s servers, which are not always the best. Finally, additional costs for more features and specific apps tend to add up.\n\nWhy Choose ChemiCloud with WooCommerce for E-Commerce\n\nIn conclusion, as stated earlier, I would have had a much better chance at success with WooCommerce if ChemiCloud was my hosting provider. I say this because of how well this website performs now that I switched to ChemiCloud.\n\nOne major problem I had with my online store using other hosting providers was how overloaded and, therefore, slow the server would get every time I added a lot of products with their images. If I were to try this e-commerce store idea one more time with ChemiCloud, I would not experience the same issues as before.\n\nIf you are still concerned about building all aspects of your e-commerce store on your own, I’d say go for it. Go for it using ChemiCloud. ChemiCloud is the best hosting company for your e-commerce website built with WooCommerce.\n\nRemember, having a successful online store starts with quality web hosting. You would feel accomplished when everything is all set and done and the organic traffic, then the orders start coming in.\n\nChemiCloud’s Drag & Drop Website Builder vs Others\n\nWhen people think about building a website for their business, among the first services that come to mind include:\n\nWix\n\nWeekly\n\nSquarespace\n\nHubspot\n\nShopify\n\nThese options are popular because of their simplified, all-in-one approach. They understand that not everyone is a website-building expert. So, they created a service where the most users have to do is make their website look nice. They will handle the rest according to your ideal settings.\n\nBelieve me, this is not a bad idea. I have been exposed to all these listed services except Squarespace. However, my issue with them is the bad performance of their websites. There are two reasons I can think of for this:\n\nFeatures that users are not using for their websites are still loading in the backend\n\nThe server(s) these services are using are not great.\n\nWhy Choose ChemiCloud’s Drag & Drop Website Builder?\n\nI want to start by saying that ChemiCloud’s Drag & Drop Website Builder for its Shared Hosting Plan is no different from the example services above regarding basic function and purpose. They all provide an interface where you drag and drop the widgets you want on your design webpage. Also, all of them ensure that your web design is mobile-responsive. Finally, if you do not want to spend the time to design your website yourself, all of them provide pre-made templates that are also mobile-responsive.\n\nHowever, with ChemiCloud, you will get better backend performance for your website.\n\nOnly the settings, plugins, widgets, etc. you choose to use will load your website.\n\nYou will have access to more data centers so your website can grow in more places.\n\nChemiCloud uses advanced backend technology to ensure your website performs consistently well across all its servers.\n\nChemiCloud can be more expensive or affordable than these services, depending on your anticipated use. Either way, if you are considering taking the easy way out by building your website, ChemiCloud is an excellent investment. It is the best web hosting service to ensure your website performs just as well as the more advanced built websites.\n\nChemiCloud Review Final Thoughts\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read my official ChemiCloud review. I hope it convinced you to consider choosing ChemiCloud to host your website(s). Even if not the entire review, I hope you can find the specific information necessary to encourage your decision to choose ChemiCloud. I genuinely believe they are the best hosting you need to build and support your websites.\n\nAs mentioned throughout my review, I recommend you invest in the Turbo plan. Whether you get the Turbo plan via WordPress Hosting or Shared Hosting, it will provide you with everything you need to ensure your website performs its absolute best. That high-quality performance will translate to more visitors from search engines, engagement, and sales. From my experience, this is the only hosting provider that has helped me achieve the quality performance my website now consistently experiences with ChemiCloud.\n\nChemiCloud offers plenty of advanced features and services that beginner website builders, creators, and entrepreneurs can use to create lasting first impressions. All they have to do (and they are) is continue to grow their customer service team so that they have reps who are able and willing to take on those more advanced service requests from us beginners. Other than that, they outshine all of the more mainstream competitors."
