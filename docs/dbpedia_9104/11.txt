The town on the Turóc River surrounded by the Little and the Great Fatra is the center of the Turóc Basin, and it was the seat of Turóc County as well until 1920, when it was attached from Hungary to Czechoslovakia. It got its name from its church dedicated to St Martin, which was built by Master Dancs, the local landowner, in the early 14th century. In the late 19th century the industry of the town flourished and it became a center for the Slovak separatists in Hungary, who were mainly incited by Czech nationalists aspiring for Hungarian lands. However, their ideology achieved much greater success at the international level than at home. This was the reason why Czech and Slovak leaders did not support a referendum at the end of World War I, because they knew they would most likely lose it, and the coveted Czechoslovakia could never have come into being.
