        "text": "As a result of World War II and the advancement of communism deep into Central Europe, the chauvinism and intolerance of some Eastern Europeans and communists was directed cruelly against the mostly innocent and defenseless German ethnic groups in these areas. The unsuspecting Danube Swabians who could not flee in time or who did not give up their homes so readily often became the victims of the boundless hate for everything German at this time. Tito's reign of terror demanded tribute in the form of human life and 250,000 succumbed in his concentration camps. Many of the remaining Danube Swabians in Romania were deported to Russian work camps or to the Baragan Steppes of Romania where tens of thousands also perished. German settlers were forced to leave Hungary for Germany or Austria as a result of the Potsdam agreement. Most of the Danube Swabians consequently have disappeared from Eastern Europe; only in Romania approximately 20,000 still do remain.\n\nSome 12 million refugees fled to Germany and Austria after the war and in this number half a million Danube Swabians are included who were crammed into refugee camps there their fortunes appeared bleak. The liberal immigration laws of the United States and Canada gave renewed hope and the opportunity to start anew as their forefathers had done again and again. Several hundred thousands came to America while smaller numbers settled in France, Brazil, Australia, Argentina, and other countries of the world. The largest number, of course, remained in Austria and Germany where they are now living in fairly good circumstances. In many places of Canada and the United States population pockets of Danube Swabians are found which were begun by countryman who had arrived before the two world wars and who later helped immigrants settle in the same area of the New World. Although there are Danube Swabians in almost all the urban centers of the United States, the greatest concentration are found in the cities of New York, Rochester, Trenton, Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Akron, Philadelphia, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Los Angeles. The energy and honesty of the Danube Swabians made them a sought-after work force. They took advantage of the freedom provided in heir new homeland and many have gained prominence in business and public service areas. The Danube Swabians in their United States have proved receptive to social progress and justice without becoming supporters and fellow travelers of radical groups. Education is very important to these new Americans, and not only are many young Danube Swabians studying at various colleges but some are also teaching at these higher institutions. Many of the graduates are, for example, successful engineers, physicians, etc. As the Danube Swabians had maintained their language and traditions in Romania, they also strive to maintain their culture in this country, Their attempts have met with success largely because of the many pedagogical, social, and musical organizations which these immigrants have created in this country. These organizations continue to be very active and find supporters and participants in other German and American circles. Believing that unity of effort produces better results, the various Danube Swabian societies have formed a national organization which also works closely with a similar organization in Canada. They are grateful for the support they have received from the public at large but also from government agencies including prominent politicians. The representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany formerly also lent their valuable support and the Danube Swabians often welcome them as guests in their new homeland. A more detailed account of Danube Swabian history is given by Sue Clarkson. We also have a list of books about Donauschwaben history, experience, and genealogy for more information.\n\nOver the years, members of our Club have pursued information about Donauschwaben genealogy and their family roots. This initiative was begun by the late Peter Kiss, and is carried on today by Dennis J. Bauer, our Club Genealogist. Contact Dennis at donauschwaben5@gmail.com to order your copy of his 2008 published book -\n\n\"A Collection of Genealogical Information of Palankaer-Americans 1895-2008 \". A second volume is in the works for 2023.We also have offered courses in genealogy with an emphasis on Donauschwaben research. Representatives from the Club also give seminars on Donauschwaben history. We share some information below that may aid you in your ancestral quest. Many of our members have roots in Palanka, Batschka. Also, visit the Donauschwaben Villages Helping Hands at http://www.dvhh.org. Family History Centers provide access to most of the microfilms and microfiche in the Family History Library to help patrons identify their ancestors (www.familysearch.org). Everyone is welcome to come to the centers and use Family History Center resources. Family History Centers are branceh facilities of the Family History Library, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) in Salt Lake City. The LDS has many ancestral records from our Donauschwaben homeland. The center closest to the Trenton area is; Morrisville, Pennsylvania\n\n1204 Pine Grove Rd\n\nMorrisville, Bucks, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nPhone: 215-295-9628\n\nCall for Hours:\n\nMorrisvilleFHC@gmail.com infromation.\n\nAn Ortssippenbuch (OSB is roughly translated \"town family/kinship book\") is a village or town book dealing with the residents genealogy. The book may contain several volumes or editions/updates. They cost between 27-260 DM each, are written in German and are arranged alphabetically by family surnames, listing husband, wife and their children. The introduction discusses the history of the town and it's founders and settlers. The genealogical data generally includes each family member's birth date and place, marriage date and place and death date and place. The information in the book may trace a particular family back from the present to the late 1600s. In some cases, the ancestor's origin in Germany, Alsace or Lorraine is noted. The Familienbuch (family book) is very similar to the Ortssippenbuch. The author uses information from civil, church records and family histories supplied by fellow genealogists to compose the book. As in any secondary source there are occasional errors. Therefore, one should verify the information by checking the original records if possible. Most of the Roman Catholic Church records from 1826-1896 are available on microfilm from the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints (LDS), Family History Center and are listed by town name. Keep in mine many of the original German town names had been changed to Hungarian names and then to Serbian names. There are several references available that can be used to determine the various names used over time for a particular town. Vital records from 1897-1919 can be obtained from the Archdiocese of Kalocsa, Kalocsa-Kecskemet, Erseki Hatosag, Szentharomsag ter 1, Postfach 29 Kalocsa H-6301, Hungary. Unfortunately, there is not an Ortssippenbuch for each town in the Donauschwaben areas of Hungary, Yugoslavia and Romania. However, the list grows each year as individuals compose these works in order to preserve a town's family history and genealogy. Many of the Donauschwaben Ortssippenbuch are marketed by the author through the Arbeitskreis donauschwäbischer Familienforscher (AkdFF) [The Working Group of Danube-Swabian Genealogists]. Their library is located at, AkdFF-Bibliothek, Goldmühlestr. 30, D-71065 Sindelfingen, Germany. In some cases they are ordered directly from the author. The books may also be available in the United States at the larger public or specialized libraries, including the main LDS Family History Library in Salt Lake City, UT, (www.familysearch.org) and the New York Public Library. You can also find additional information and resources at the Donauschwaben Villages Helping Hands web site (www.dvhh.org). Many members of the DVHH will do free lookups in their personal OSB collections.\n\nPre-World War I Hungarian County List useful for your Research\n\nPre-World War I Hungarian County List As you are probably aware, many of the pre-World War I Hungarian counties are not in Hungary today.
