From 2007 to 2015, his Administration delivered results for Maryland families: creating jobs, expanding opportunity, and making Maryland a safer, healthier place.\n\nA former Governing Magazine Public Official of the Year, Governor OMalley was elected in 2006 and re-elected in 2010. His 2013 legislative successes were described in a Baltimore Sun editorial as without many parallels in recent Maryland history.\n\nWith a balanced approach of spending cuts, regulatory reform, and modern investment in education, innovation, and infrastructure, Governor OMalley and his Administration made better choices that delivered better results, including:\n\nFastest rate of job growth in the region.\n\n#1 ranking for best public schools in America for an unprecedented five years in a row (Education Week).\n\n#1 ranking for holding down the cost of college tuition (College Board).\n\n#1 ranking for innovation and entrepreneurship for two years running (U.S. Chamber of Commerce).\n\nUnder the Governors leadership, Maryland also ranks:\n\n#1 nationally in median income,\n\n#1 in Ph.D. scientists and researchers per capita,\n\n#1 in Research and Development, and\n\n#1 in businesses owned by women.\n\nThe Milken Institute ranks Maryland as one of the top two states in America for science and technology.\n\nMaryland is one of only a few states to earn an AAA Bond Rating, certified by all three major rating agencies.\n\nCalled arguably the best manager in government by Washington Monthly magazine, Governor OMalley cut State spending more than any previous governor in Marylands history, balancing these record cuts with targeted, modern investments in priorities like public education. He reduced the size of government to its smallest size since 1973 (on a per capita basis) and reformed how it is managed, so that it works more efficiently and accountably. His actions to save Marylands State pension system have made it sustainable over the long term. His fiscal stewardship nearly eliminated Marylands structural deficit. His efforts to streamline, consolidate and digitize processes like business licensing made Maryland a better place to do business.\n\nGovernor OMalleys StateStat initiative  modeled after the CitiStat initiative he created in the City of Baltimore  is widely cited as a model for government efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nTeaming with the men and women of Maryland law enforcement, the OMalley-Brown Administrations crime fighting initiatives drove down violent crime and homicide to the lowest levels in three decades. The Administrations homeland security strategies also turned around security at the Port of Baltimore.\n\nThe OMalley-Brown Administration expanded health care to more than 380,000 previously uninsured Marylanders. It reduced infant mortality to an historic low, and provided meals to thousands of hungry children as it moved forward toward its goal for eradicating childhood hunger.\n\nThe Governors policies made strides in restoring the health of the Chesapeake Bay and saving the Bays native blue crab and oyster populations.\n\nThe OMalley Administration secured millions of dollars in rate relief for Maryland energy consumers while jump-starting the creation of thousands of green energy sector jobs. Under Governor OMalleys leadership, Maryland led the charge for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the nations first cap-and-trade auction of greenhouse emissions.\n\nGovernor OMalley cut income taxes for 86% of Marylanders and reformed Marylands tax code to make it more progressive. In addition, he signed the nations first statewide living wage law, along with some of the nations most comprehensive reforms to protect homeowners from foreclosure.\n\nDeclaring that Marylanders are bound together by the common thread of human dignity, Governor OMalley signed legislation to protect individual civil marriage rights and religious freedom, along with legislation to protect voting rights. He signed  and successfully defended at the ballot box  the DREAM Act, which expands the opportunity of a college education to more Marylanders.\n\nPrior to serving as Governor, OMalley served as Mayor of the City of Baltimore, where he was recognized by Esquire magazine as the best young mayor in the country and by Time magazine as one of Americas Top 5 Big City Mayors. First elected in 1999, he was re-elected in 2003, receiving 87 percent of the vote. Between 1999 and 2009 his policies helped the people of Baltimore achieve the greatest crime reduction of Americas largest cities.\n\nGovernor OMalley received his bachelors degree from Catholic University and his law degree from the University of Maryland. In 1986, while in law school, he was named by then-Congresswoman Barbara Mikulski as state field director for her successful primary and general election campaigns for the U.S. Senate. From 1987 to 1988 he served as a legislative fellow for Senator Mikulski, where he focused on obtaining federal funding for projects in Maryland. In 1988, OMalley was appointed assistant states attorney for the City of Baltimore. He served on the Baltimore City Council from 1991 to 1999, during which time he chaired the Legislative Investigations Committee, and the Taxation and Finance Committee.\n\nGovernor OMalley served two terms as Chair of the Democratic Governors Association, and also served as the organizations Finance Chair. In addition, he served as Co-Chair for the Special Committee on Homeland Security and Public Safety of the National Governors Association. He was appointed to the nations first-ever Council of Governors by President Obama in 2010 and was named co-chair of the Council in 2013.\n\nMartin and his wife Katie, a Maryland District Court Judge, have two daughters, Grace and Tara, and two sons, William and Jack. They are members of St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church.\n\nMaryland Constitutional Offices & Agencies\n\nMaryland Departments\n\nMaryland Independent Agencies\n\nMaryland Executive Commissions, Committees, Task Forces, & Advisory Boards\n\nMaryland Universities & Colleges\n\nMaryland Counties\n\nMaryland Municipalities\n\nMaryland at a Glance\n\nMaryland Manual On-Line\n\nSearch the Manual\n\ne-mail: mdmanual@maryland.gov\n\n© Copyright August 19, 2024 Maryland State Archives"
