        "text": "Most of your income in Crusader Kings 3 comes from your domain – be it directly held by you or by your vassals. You can vastly increase the amount of money you receive by having a high skill in Stewardship as each level provides a 2% boost on your income.\n\nChoosing the Stewardship Lifestyle Focus opens up various additional modifiers and active ways to generate even more gold. The Wealth Focus straight up boosts your income by 10% and allows you to accumulate skill points to invest in the three Stewardship Lifestyle Focus trees. Those have a few useful bonuses for you in store.\n\nAvaricious allows you to demand gold payments from people you have hooks on, which is particularly great in combination with the Intrigue Lifestyle Focus Schemer – you only need to invest one point into that tree to gain the ability to fabricate hooks. You gain additional money from ransoms as well and are able to extort your subjects for money, though that won’t exactly make them love you. This tree contains great passive income modifiers from Heregeld, Golden Aplomb and Detailed Ledgers, too. Completing the tree gives you the Avaricious trait with a +15% modifier on your holding taxes and +2 Stewardship.\n\nArchitect isn’t that great for directly making money, but in case you’re planning on a big building programme in your domain during your lifetime, it can be worth grabbing to reduce building costs and build times and boost development.\n\nAdministrator has some money-making capabilities from Honored to Serve, increasing the tax contributions of powerful vassals on your council by 20%, but overall this is more of a stability tree than a monetary one.\n\nChoosing the Wealth Focus, going down the Avaricious tree, and – ideally – having a character with the Greedy trait will give you the most income modifiers. You can further maximize your income bonus on a ruler with Greedy and Golden Aplomb by increasing your stress, adding +10% per level.\n\nWar has always been a great source of income for rulers, and it can be one in Crusader Kings 3 as well – especially for those cultures with the ability to raid their neighbors without declaring war. Obviously, plundering counties generates some loot that adds to your income. The other source of gold from wars and raids is the ransom you can demand for letting noble prisoners go free.\n\nAs we’ve seen above, the Avaricious Lifestyle has some nice bonuses for this in store, allowing you to demand higher ransoms or letting people go in exchange for hooks, which you can then allow them to pay off. The same skill tree contains the War Profiteer ability, adding +10% to your monthly income when you’re at war.\n\nYou can boost your ability to raid with the Strategist tree’s Living Off the Land ability, which boosts your raid speed. The Overseer tree’s Prepared Conscription is another good one if you want to make money off warring, as it decreases your army maintenance costs by -15%.\n\nA new way of making money comes from the Tours & Tournaments expansion in the form of Taxation Tours. For this, you’ll need to choose the Grand Tour activity and then customize the purpose of the journey, choosing Taxation Tour. This will allow you to travel through your realm and visit your vassals, demanding tribute and taxes. If they refuse, you can gain hooks on them, which you can then transform into money through the Avaricious Lifestyle – or use it as a pretext to replace them in their position in favor of a vassal who is more willing to part with their money.\n\nThis is a very powerful new tool and is a cool way of actively making money in times of peace for income-focused characters."
