        "text": "Background\n\nChristopher COLUMBUS claimed Saint Martin for Spain in 1493, naming it after the feast day of St. Martin of Tours, but it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631 to exploit its salt deposits. The Spanish retook Saint Martin in 1633, but the Dutch continued to assert their claims. The Spanish finally relinquished the island to the French and Dutch, who divided it between themselves in 1648. The border frequently fluctuated over the next 200 years because of friction between the two countries, with the French eventually holding the greater portion of the island (about 61%).\n\nThe cultivation of sugarcane introduced African slavery to the island in the late 18th century; the practice was not abolished until 1848. The island became a free port in 1939, and the tourism industry was dramatically expanded during the 1970s and 1980s. In 2003, the populace of Saint Martin voted to secede from Guadeloupe, and in 2007, the northern portion of the island became a French overseas collectivity. In 2010, the southern Dutch portion of the island became the independent nation of Sint Maarten within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 2017, Hurricane Irma passed over the island of Saint Martin, causing extensive damage to roads, communications, electrical power, and housing; the UN estimated that 90% of the buildings were damaged or destroyed.\n\nGeography - note\n\nnote 1: the southern border is shared with Sint Maarten, a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands; together, these two entities make up the smallest landmass in the world shared by two self-governing states\n\nnote 2: Simpson Bay Lagoon (aka as Simson Bay Lagoon or The Great Pond) is one of the largest inland lagoons in the West Indies; the border between the French and Dutch halves of the island of Saint Martin runs across the center of the lagoon, which is shared by both of the island's entities√Ç\n\nExecutive branch\n\nchief of state: President Emmanuel MACRON (since 14 May 2017); represented by Prefect Vincent BERTON (since 28 March 2022)\n\nhead of government: President of Territorial Council Louis MUSSINGTON (since 3 April 2022)\n\ncabinet: Executive Council; note - there is also an advisory economic, social, and cultural council\n\nelections/appointments: French president directly elected by absolute majority popular vote in 2 rounds if needed for a 5-year term (eligible for a second term); prefect appointed by French president on the advice of French Ministry of Interior; president of Territorial Council elected by its members for a 5-year term; election last held on 3 April 2022 (next to be held in 2027)\n\nelection results:\n\n2022: Louis MUSSINGTON (RSM) elected president; Territorial Council vote - unanimous\n\n2017: Daniel Gibbs (UD) elected president; Territorial Council vote - 18 of 23 votes\n\nLegislative branch\n\ndescription: unicameral Territorial Council (23 seats; members directly elected by absolute majority vote in 2 rounds if needed to serve 5-year terms); Saint Martin elects 1 member to the French Senate and 1 member (shared with Saint Barthelemy) to the French National Assembly\n\nelections: Territorial Council - first round held on 20 March and second round held on 27 March 2022 (next to be held in March 2027)\n\nFrench Senate - last held on 27 September 2020 (next to be held not later than September 2023)\n\nFrench National Assembly - last held on 12 and 19 June 2022 (next to be held by June 2027)\n\nelection results: Territorial Council - percent of vote by party in first round - RSM 25.4%, UD 24.7%, HOPE 17.5%, Saint Martin with You 13.8%, Alternative 11.2%, Future Saint Martin 7.5%; percent of vote by party in second round - RSM and Alternative 49.1%; UD 33.3%; HOPE, Saint Martin with You, and Future Saint Martin 17.6%; seats by party - RSM and Alternative 16; UD 5, HOPE, Saint Martin with You, and Future Saint Martin 2; composition - men 13, women 10, percentage women 43.5%\n\nFrench Senate - 1 seat - UMP 1\n\nFrench National Assembly - 1 seat - UMP 1\n\nNational anthem\n\nname: \"O Sweet Saint Martin's Land\"\n\nlyrics/music: Gerard KEMPS\n\nnote: the song, written in 1958, is used as an unofficial anthem for the entire island (both French and Dutch sides); as a collectivity of France, in addition to the local anthem, \"La Marseillaise\" remains official on the French side (see France); as a constituent part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in addition to the local anthem, \"Het Wilhelmus\" remains official on the Dutch side (see Netherlands)"
