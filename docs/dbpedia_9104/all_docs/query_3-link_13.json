It took its name from the first ispán of the county established by King Stephen I of Hungary in 1000. Its castle repeatedly defended the country from the German armies arriving with the purpose of conquest. King Sigismund of Hungary fortified it against the Czech Hussite plunderers, whose attack it could finally repel. King Matthias of Hungary founded a Renaissance university in the town called Academia Istropolitana in 1467. But Pozsony gained its real significance after the Turks occupied the country's capital, Buda, in 1541. The new capital of Hungary became Pozsony. In the following centuries, 10 ruling kings and 1 queen of the Habsburg House were crowned in St. Martin’s Cathedral, and the country assemblies were also mostly held in the town. Many churches, aristocratic palaces and public buildings were built in the town worthy of its rank. The anti-Habsburg Hungarian insurgents occupied it more than once. The Hungarian baron and ispán of Pozsony County Pálffy Pál expanded the palace and added the four ornamental towers and Empress Maria Theresia turned it into Baroque style. The country assembly in 1836 made Hungarian the official language of Hungary instead of the Latin. The first horse-drawn railway of Hungary was also opened between Pozsony and Nagyszombat. In 1919 the Czechoslovak army invaded the predominantly Hungarian and German town, fired at the peacefully protesting crowd and tore down the Hungarian statues. The violent Slovakization of the town began afterwards.

The construction of the Gothic cathedral dedicated to St. Elisabeth of Hungary started in 1374. In 1412 the Pentapolitana, the alliance of the five most important free royal towns of northern Hungary, was created with the leadership of Kassa. During the reign of King Matthias of Hungary, Kassa was one of the largest European towns with its population of 10 thousand. During the 17th century Kassa was the center of the Hungarian uprisings against the Habsburg emperor and also the starting point of the campaigns of the Hungarian princes of Transylvania against Vienna within the Kingdom of Hungary. It was also the center of the Hungarian War of Independence between 1703 and 1711 led by Prince Rákóczi Ferenc II. The remains of the prince and his companions in exile, brought home from Rodosto (Turkey) in 1906, were placed in the crypt of the St. Elisabeth Cathedral. In 1918 the Czechoslovak army invaded the predominantly Hungarian town, tore down the memorial of the Hungarian War of Independence and fired at the peacefully protesting crowd. Afterwards Kassa was attached to the newly created Czechoslovakia. In 1945 the Czechoslovak president Benes announced his decrees on the persecution and the deprivation of properties of the Hungarian and German people from the balcony of the seat of the former Abaúj-Torna County, as a result of which there are hardly any Hungarians left in the town.\"},{\"id\":\"3\",\"name\":\"Komárom\",\"localname\":\"Komárno\",\"seolink\":\"komarom-komarno\",\"gps_lat\":\"47.7571410000\",\"gps_long\":\"18.1294410000\",\"population\":\"36\",\"picture\":\"download\",\"picture_ref\":\"\",\"description\":\"The ancient Hungarian town is divided not only by the Danube but also by a border, because its northern part, which includes its historic center, was attached from Hungary to the newly created Czechoslovakia in 1920.

One of the most modern and impregnable fortification systems of Europe was created here, which strongly resisted the Austrian siege during the Hungarian War of Independence between 1848 and 1849, even after its suppression by the Russian intervention forces. The amnesty obtained by giving up the fortress ensured safety for thousands of Hungarian patriots, including the playwright Madách Imre, who could later write The tragedy of man. The town was once the seat of Komárom-Esztergom County, and is widely known from the novel The Man with the Golden Touch written by the Hungarian writer Jókai Mór, which is a must read for students in Hungary.

The pagan rival of Stephen I, the first Christian king of Hungary, named Vazul was held captive and blinded in its castle. The Bavarian Gisela, the wife of Stephen I, established the predecessor of the present-day cathedral and dedicated it to St. Emmeram, the patron saint of Regensburg. The monastery on Mount Zobor was also founded at that time under the patronage of the Bavarian saint Hippolyte. Nyitra was the seat of the Duchy that was traditionally held by the ruling king's younger brother. Since the dukes often aspired to the throne, this institution was abolished by King Kálmán the Book-Lover, who also established the Bishopric of Nyitra in 1113 and constructed the first stone castle here. The monument erected in 1896 for the Millennium of Hungary was exploded by the Czechoslovak invaders in 1921, but its magnificent pedestal still stands on Mount Zobor next to the radio transmitter.

In the 19th century there were a grammar school and a college with faculties of low, theology and teacher training in the town. Several famous Hungarians learned there, including Kossuth Lajos and Márai Sándor. All this was ended by the Czechoslovak invaders in 1919, who closed the schools, which were then moved to present-day Hungary. The town was founded by King Béla II the Blind of Hungary, who named it after the strawberry growing in the area. It became the seat of Sáros County in 1647. Eperjes was a strong bastion of the anti-Habsburg uprising of Thököly Imre, and in retaliation the tribunal of General Caraffa tortured 300 people and brutally executed 24 wealthy burghers to put his hands on their fortune.

As one of the most important merchant towns of Szepes, in the 16th century it had a fierce rivalry with Lőcse for the staple right, the right to stop goods. The rivalry ended with the victory of Lőcse in 1544, when King Ferdinand I of Hungary sentenced Késmárk to \\\"eternal silence\\\". Its castle was acquired by the Thököly family in 1583, who made it their seat of power. The castle was confiscated from Thököly István in 1671 for participating in the Wesselényi-conspiracy against the Habsburg emperor Leopold I. The treasures were transported from the castle to Vienna on 16 carriages. Thököly Imre, leader of the anti-Habsburg insurgents and later Prince of Upper Hungary, who was also born here, took it back from the Emperor a couple of times. His earthly remains brought home in 1906 from Nicomedia (now Izmit, Turkey) were laid to rest in the mausoleum of the new Lutheran church of the town. The Saxons of Szepes proved their loyalty in 1918 during the Czechoslovak invasion, when they declared their will to remain part of Hungary.

The estate was purchased by the Stummer family in 1868, who established a modern sugar factory in the town. In December 1918, Czechoslovaks invaded the town, and they displaced the Hungarian and German inhabitants after 1945.

It dates back to the 15th century, when vlach shepherds were settled in the area. The St. Bartholomew Church was built in the first half of the 18th century with the support of Erdődy György. Empress Maria Theresia granted it town status in 1778. On 7 November, 1918 the Czechoslovak Legion broke into Hungary through the Jablunka Pass and invaded Csaca. The Hungarian counter-attack starting on November 12 drove the Czechs out of Hungary. Afterwards the naive Entente-friendly Károlyi Mihály came to power in Hungary with a revolution, who dismissed the military and forbade any resistance, which rendered the country defenseless. The Czechs were then able to occupy the northern part of Hungary without hindrance, which ultimately led to the creation of Czechoslovakia.\"}]}"
