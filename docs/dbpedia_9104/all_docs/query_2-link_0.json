        "text": "County in Florida, United States\n\nCounty in Florida\n\nMartin County is a county located in the southeastern part of the state of Florida, in the United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 158,431.[2] Its county seat is Stuart.[3] Martin County is in the Port St. Lucie, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMartin County was created in 1925 with the northern portion coming from St. Lucie County and southern portion coming from Palm Beach County. It was named for John W. Martin, Governor of Florida from 1925 to 1929.[4]\n\nWhen the county was created, the western contour followed the shore of Lake Okeechobee, as did the borders of Glades, Okeechobee, and Hendry counties. Palm Beach County had historically claimed all of the surface of the lake as part of its area, to its benefit for the distribution of state and federal highway funds. The state representative of Martin County, William Ralph Scott of Stuart, initiated a bill to divide the lake among its adjacent counties, creating a more equitable distribution of state funds for road creation and maintenance. All bordering counties confirmed the justice of this change and supported its ratification, with the exception of Palm Beach County. Representatives from Palm Beach County later presented Representative Scott with a jug of water, signifying \"all the water Bill Scott left Palm Beach County.\" The jug is in the possession of Stuart Heritage.[citation needed]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 753 square miles (1,950 km2), of which 543 square miles (1,410 km2) is land and (27.8%) is water.[6] It is the fifty-fourth largest county in Florida by land area, and fifty-third largest by total area.\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nSt. Lucie County – north\n\nPalm Beach County – south\n\nHendry County – southwest\n\nGlades County – southwest\n\nOkeechobee County – northwest\n\nNational protected area\n\n[edit]\n\nHobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge\n\nEnvironment\n\n[edit]\n\nMartin County Shore Protection Project\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Martin County Shore Protection Project includes nourishment of approximately 3.75 miles of beach extending from the St. Lucie County line south to the Stuart Public Beach Park in Martin County. Included in the project is restoration of the primary dune and a 35-foot-wide protective berm. The renourishment interval for this project is every 7 years.[7]\n\nThe last renourishment of the Martin County Shore Protection Project was completed in May 2013 and included a Flood Control and Coastal Emergency component due impacts incurred with the passage of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The next renourishment event is scheduled for 2019.[7]\n\nThe estimated total cost of this project is $69.9 million, $32.5 million of which is to be paid for by the U.S. Federal Government. In Fiscal Year 2015, no funding was appropriated to the project by the U.S. Congress. In the Fiscal Year 2016 U.S. President's Budget Request to the U.S. Congress, no funding dollars was requested for the project.[7]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 19305,111—19406,29523.2%19507,80724.0%196016,932116.9%197028,03565.6%198064,014128.3%1990100,90057.6%2000126,73125.6%2010146,31815.5%2020158,4318.3%2023 (est.)163,315[8]3.1%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nMartin County racial composition\n\n(Hispanics excluded from racial categories)\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic)[13][14] Race Pop 2010 Pop 2020 % 2010 % 2020 White (NH) 117,532 119,216 80.33% 75.25% Black or African American (NH) 7,493 7,277 5.12% 4.59% Native American or Alaska Native (NH) 248 218 0.17% 0.14% Asian (NH) 1,510 2,246 1.03% 1.42% Pacific Islander (NH) 52 42 0.04% 0.03% Some Other Race (NH) 139 525 0.09% 0.33% Mixed/Multi-Racial (NH) 1,463 4,720 1.0% 2.98% Hispanic or Latino 17,881 24,187 12.22% 15.27% Total 146,318 158,431\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 158,431 people, 65,014 households, and 40,328 families residing in the county.\n\n2000 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the census[15] of 2000, there were 126,731 people, 55,288 households, and 36,213 families residing in the county.
