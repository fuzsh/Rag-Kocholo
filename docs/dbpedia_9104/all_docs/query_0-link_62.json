        "text": "The countdown to Clairfield's 20th anniversary celebration continues… As we look back on our two decades, we reflect on one of the most exciting changes in our journey — our 2022 rebrand, the second in our history. This branding overhaul represented our continuous evolution and the importance of keeping our company image fresh and relevant after 20 years of history. Our new motto “Defined by Your Success” asks our clients (and ourselves) to consider what success means to them. We use our case studies to showcase our clients’ achievements and illustrate how we have assisted them as advisors. Every client is unique, and so is our approach. Our new brand identity symbolises a fresh outlook, renewed energy, and an innovative spirit that drives us forward. It demonstrates the depth and breadth of our expertise, large and impressive team and client roster, and presents Clairfield as a truly united global company. Here’s to another 20 years… #WeAre20 #Rebrand #ClairfieldCelebrates #mergersandacquisitions #DefinedByYourSuccess\n\nAs we approach our 20th anniversary, we thank our clients for their support and trust over the past two decades. Their successes allow us to continue our commitment to social and environmental responsibility, community involvement, ethical practices, and charity work. Many of our recent initiatives have involved sponsoring and assisting the relief efforts in Ukraine. Our offices have actively organised the transportation of medical supplies from Germany aiding hospitals that care for civilians and military personnel. Clairfield team members have supported refugees both financially and by offering safe housing. Partner in Germany Dr. Albert Schander is no stranger to conflict zones and humanitarian relief from his long career in the German military as colonel of the German paratroopers. He is also an active part of the Johanniter organization, serving as chair of the board of trustees of two hospitals and together with the International Assistance TF of Johanniter in Berlin he organized one of the first relief goods transports from Germany to Lwiw in 2022. Clairfield remains committed to supporting the ongoing humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. To donate to the ongoing relief efforts, visit https://lnkd.in/diZad5Hn.

Our Italian consumer team advised Naturalia Tantum in the sale of a majority stake to H.I.G. Capital in partnership with management of the company. This MBO transaction will further accelerate the growth of Naturalia Tantum in Italy and abroad. Based in Milan, Naturalia Tantum develops, manufactures and distributes natural organic personal care products. The company portfolio combines white label products and proprietary branded products, positioning the group as a one-stop shop for Italian and international retailers. Organic beauty is a thriving sector where Clairfield boasts extensive experience. Just a few months ago we closed the sale of a minority stake of MiiN Korean Cosmetics, a K-beauty and natural beauty pioneer in Europe, to Barlon Capital, in another private equity transaction. Congratulations to our clients and the deal team: Barbara Ronconi and Marco Pagano!

As we count down to our 20th anniversary celebration, we highlight key initiatives that have helped define our success. Keeping the lines of communication open between clients, advisors, and industry experts is essential. This week we feature our annual publication “The Clairfield Outlook,” which showcases successful transactions and insights from business leaders on their journeys and experiences. Over the years, the Outlook has developed and evolved, with its distribution growing more extensive and reaching further afield. Due to popular demand, we offer both printed and digital versions. The Clairfield Outlook continues to ignite thoughts and discussions, taking a forward and backward look at M&A. We invite you to explore our latest edition here: https://lnkd.in/eZZ9GFNF Here’s to the next 20 years! #ClairfieldOutlook #WeAre20\n\nClairfield’s Central and Eastern Europe team has demonstrated outstanding performance in H1, solidifying our position as leader in the region. Ranking second in both LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) and Mergermarket H1 league tables, our team has successfully closed 11 deals so far this year, ranging from the sale of one of the largest Czech grocery chains to numerous software houses and dental clinics. Piotr Kolodziejczyk, a partner in Poland, says that the market is driven by add-ons and smaller deals that are resistent to the slowdown seen for larger leveraged buyouts. He attributes Clairfield’s success to our focus on mid-sized deals and niche sectors, which are growing in CEE, unlike the more subdued large-cap sector. Our sell-side clients also benefit from our comprehensive regional coverage and our understanding of local norms and regulations in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, says Oliver Nemes, partner in Hungary. Healthcare, e-commerce platforms, service providers, IT and software consolidation, and digital transformation continue to be hot sectors in CEE and are areas where Clairfield has extensive expertise. “With the maturing of markets in CEE, we see increased consolidation within the region. Historically we would sell companies to Western players, but now inter-regional buyers are regularly outbidding international players based on synergies and active buy-and build programs,” says Berend Yntema, partner in Austria. Czech partner Marek Rehberger notes two major trends In the Czech Republic. “First of all, we are seeing gradual changes in company shareholding structures due to the aging of the founders who started their businesses in the 1990s following the Velvet Revolution. Secondly, changes in tax legislation effective from 2025, which impose income tax for exits over CZK 40 million (about EUR 1.6 million), are prompting a rush for exits.” Still, foreign buyers should be mindful of the different regulatory schemes, double-digit salary growth, and often higher multiples than in Western Europe due to better growth prospects. Our team is optimistic about the rest of the year despite the sluggish state of M&A in 2024 overall. “We believe that our niche focus strategy in sectors such as dental, medtech, and software will bring good results in H2 and 2025, even though the M&A market as a whole remains challenging compared to 2021-2022,” says Piotr. “Within our team we will continue to cooperate closely, monitor markets together, perform outreach to CEE-focused private equity funds, and build awareness of our regional coverage.” #HowDoYouDefineSuccess #CEE #Austria #Poland #Hungary #CzechRepublic #Dental #Software\n\nRetail M&A in today’s environment calls for special expertise, and the more so with multiple international parties including governmental bodies. Our crossborder team has experience in the intricacy of these transactions, which was demonstrated in the recent sale of INNO. Our team advised GALERIA Karstadt Kaufhof GmbH who, together with The Economic Stabilisation Fund of Germany (WSF), sold the famous Belgian department store chain. The buyer is INNOvative Retail BV, a newly established company jointly owned by Axcent of Scandinavia, the majority owner of Swedish department store chain Åhléns AB, and SKEL fjárfestingafélag, a listed Icelandic investment company. Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof (GKK) has been supported by Germany’s Economic Stabilisation Fund (Wirtschaftsstabilisierungsfonds, WSF) since its April 2020 post-Covid insolvency. The disposal of 100% of INNO’s shares was part of a structured M&A process. Founded over 125 years ago, INNO is an iconic Belgian department store chain with 16 locations across Belgium that offers a broad range of premium and mainstream brands. Under its new owners it will be able to expand further in Belgium and abroad. “As the retail sector continues to cope with high inflation, low consumer spending and cautious investor sentiment, the transaction took place in a very challenging environment,” says Martin Lemmer, deal lead and co-head of Clairfield consumer group. “With a concerted effort by Clairfield's offices in Frankfurt and Antwerp and together with a highly motivated management team at the target, we found the ideal future home for INNO. Axcent of Scandinavia and Icelandic SKEL bring new ownership with recognised, successful, and growing department store experience and financial stability.” Kudos to our international team: Martin Lemmer, Serge RAGOTZKY, Ekaterina Abrosimova, CFA, David Freudenthal, Wim Goossens, Alexander V., and Anke Dom.

It’s a fitting moment to celebrate those who juggle demanding careers alongside their sporting passions. Our 20th anniversary countdown continues with insights from Clairfielders balancing high-level sports and finance. At Clairfield, we are proud to have colleagues who excel both in the office and on the field. We asked some of our remarkable Clairfield athletes about their experiences in balancing the high stakes of M&A with the intense demands of sports training and competition. They highlight the profound impact that discipline, teamwork, strategic thinking, and resilience can have across all areas of life and the financial sector. The joy of watching the Olympics is sharing in the victories. However, experiencing both success and failure is common in sports and business. “Navigating a deal is like running an ultramarathon,” according to Mark Steinhardt (who’s experienced in both). “Long-distance running is all about problem solving – training, pacing, nutrition, changes in weather. It doesn’t matter how fit you are, something always comes up on race day that you need to overcome. Running an M&A deal is very similar – you need to train well, but also be prepared for unexpected twists and have a plan for how to deal with them.” Read more here: https://lnkd.in/d4cjPMF4 With: Mikolaj Rakowski, Mark Steinhardt, Helen Challis, Muge Tuna, Abhijeet Biswas, CFA, MBA, Tom McCarthy, Dr. Albert Schander, Stefano Ermacora, Konstantin Zygan, Laurits Liebeck, Dennis Gapta, Andrei Novikov, David Freudenthal.

These positions are a recognition of Filippo’s expertise in M&A with private equity – and acknowledgement of his ability to get the job done! Under his leadership, Filippo plans to engage more members in Commission initiatives and promote M&A activity with family-owned businesses. “Family-owned businesses are core to the Italian economy and a particular passion of mine. Private equity partners are a solution to their long-term growth,” says Filippo. We look forward to seeing Filippo’s impact on the M&A Commission! https://lnkd.in/dSfJbQaW\n\nCongratulations to our Mexican team for their latest deal in a hot sector – hot sauces! La Anita, a market leader in achiote – that essential ingredient that gives tacos their kick and characteristic red color – and other sauces, condiments and dressings, acquired Zaaschila, based in Nuevo León. This acquisition is a major milestone for La Anita, a family business located in the state of Yucatan in southern Mexico and founded by Ana Sosa de Méndez in 1913. Since its acquisition by its current owners in 1978, La Anita has grown into a national giant. With the acquisition of Zaaschila, the company gains a stronger footprint in the north of Mexico and opens new export channels to the US. “After an extensive search for the right target and a complex negotiation period, our client successfully acquired an attractive company that offers significant revenue synergies. It was a pleasure to work with La Anita's CEO and senior management team on this important transaction,” says Luis Coria de Abiega, partner in Mexico and leader of the deal team. “Investment in Mexico typically flows from the north to the south, making this deal – where a company based in southern Mexico acquires a company in the more industrialized north of Mexico - quite unique. We are proud to have facilitated a transaction that helps build a food production champion in Yucatan.” Felicidades to our client La Anita and the deal team Luis Coria de Abiega, Pablo Cervantes Belausteguigoitia, Javier Alvarez Trillas, Jorge Arturo Hernández Tirado for a successful outcome!
