Stuart

Stuart, the county seat, also known as the “Sailfish Capital of the World” because of the many sailfish found off the coast, is located along the banks of the St. Lucie River. Stuart is also located on the eastern point of the Okeechobee Waterway, which extends from the Atlantic Ocean in Stuart to the Gulf of Mexico in Ft. Myers, giving Stuart the nickname of “The Panama Canal of Florida.”
