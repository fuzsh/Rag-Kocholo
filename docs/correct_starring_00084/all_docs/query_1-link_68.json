        "text": "It’s official: Bill Murray will appear in Paul Feig’s female-led Ghostbusters reboot. Murray and his original ghostbusting co-star Dan Aykroyd will both show up in the film, although there are no details yet as to what they’ll be doing or who they will play. (There’s also no word about whether Ernie Hudson, the other surviving original Ghostbuster, will make a cameo of his own.)\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, Murray had been hesitant about starring in another Ghostbusters movie because Ghostbusters II was not as successful as the first one. But that was over two decades ago; we’re in the age of sequels now, and two of the four women Murray suggested for his own dream cast for the movie (his St. Vincent co-star Melissa McCarthy, and Kristen Wiig) are now starring. The movie, which hits theaters in July 2016, is shaping up to be one big Twinkie."
