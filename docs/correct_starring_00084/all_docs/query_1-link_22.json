        "text": "The One Show viewers have been left in shock after discovering Ghostbuster star Ernie Hudson's real age during his appearance on the programme last night. The Hollywood legend was a guest on the show to discuss his reprising role in the new Ghostbusters film, alongside his co-stars Finn Wolfhard and Mckenna Grace.\n\nDuring the interview, viewers flocked to social media to comment on the 78-year-old's youthful appearance, 40 years on from when he first starred as Winston Zeddemore in the original film. On the platform X, one viewer wrote: \"#theoneshow on BBC1 and wondering how on earth is@ernie_hudson 78 years old? Whats your secret Ernie?\"\n\nA second added: \"Ernie Hudson doesn’t look a day older than the day the original #ghostbusters was released 78!!! Jesus!!\" A third typed: \"Ernie Hudson is a legend, looks amazing for his age.\"\n\nAnother commented: \"So good to see @Ernie_Hudson on #TheOneShow and not aged a bit, forever Officer Albrecht to me, awesome movie, awesome performance Sir.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Ernie praised fans' efforts of keeping the Ghostbuster's legacy alive over the years. He said: \"Fans for 40 years they’ve kept it alive even when there was no Ghostbusters. People got tattoos. They just showed up and kept it going.\n\n\"We were all so excited to meet the new guys and carry on the franchise. That was the real blessing in working on this film,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking further with hosts Roman Kemp and Jermaine Jenas, Ernie said while the production team were \"protective of their assets\", he was allowed to keep his jumpsuit from the original movie and still has it today.\n\nAs well as appearing in the original film, Ernie starred in the follow-ups Ghostbusters II and Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\n\nHe was also back on screens in 2016 during the female remake where he played a cameo role.\n\nAdditionally away from Ghostbusters, he has starred in a number of shows and film including The Basketball Diaries and Desperate Housewives.\n\nEarlier this month, Ernie said he \"wasn't jumping up and down\" at the idea of returning to Ghostbusters but signed up after being given a \"fully engaged\" role.\n\nHe told Empire: \"My only hesitation was, 'I don’t want to be an afterthought'. Like: 'Oh, well, I guess we have to have Ernie'. I wanted [Winston] to be fully engaged in the story. Which he absolutely is in this movie.\"\n\nA synopsis for the new movie reads: \"In Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, the Spengler family returns to where it all started – the iconic New York City firehouse – to team up with the original Ghostbusters, who’ve developed a top-secret research lab to take busting ghosts to the next level.\n\n\"But when the discovery of an ancient artifact unleashes an army of ghosts that casts a death chill upon the city, Ghostbusters new and old must join forces to protect their home and save the world from a second Ice Age.\"\n\nThe One Show airs weekdays from 7pm on BBC One."
