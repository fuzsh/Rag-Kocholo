        "text": "As with any long-running movie series, the easiest way to watch the Ghostbusters movies in order is in their release order.\n\nYou could extend this list by including the two animated TV series The Real Ghostbusters (1986-1991) and Extreme Ghostbusters (1997).\n\nIf you want to do that, watch The Real Ghostbusters – retitled as Slimer! and the Real Ghostbusters from season 4 onwards – after the first movie and then Extreme Ghostbusters after the sequel.\n\nWatch now: Prime Video | iTunes | Microsoft Store\n\nThe first – and still the best – Ghostbusters introduced us to Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson).\n\nIt marked their first, but not their last battle, with Gozer who is trying to bring about the apocalypse. Only the Ghostbusters, together with secretary Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts), can stop it.\n\nWatch now: Prime Video | iTunes | Microsoft Store\n\nThe Ghostbusters might have saved the day in the previous movie, but at the start of Ghostbusters II, they're disbanded due to the sheer amount of destruction caused in New York City.\n\nHowever, when Venkman's son becomes the target of a powerful spirit, the band get back together to save the day... again.\n\nWatch now: Prime Video | iTunes | Microsoft Store\n\n27 years after the Ghostbusters last saved New York City, the team are back in Ghostbusters – but not as we saw them before.\n\nThe all-female reboot of the series introduced us to a new team – Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig), Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) and Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) – as they attempt to protect New York City from more than 1,000 spirits.\n\nWatch now: Prime Video | iTunes | Microsoft Store\n\nLegacy sequel Ghostbusters: Afterlife shifted the focus back to the first two movies by centring on Spengler's daughter Callie (Carrie Coon) and his two grandchildren Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace).\n\nWhen they inherit Spengler's farm, they discover his secret history and also unfortunately release one of Gozer's sentinels to pave the way for his return.\n\nWatch now: In cinemas\n\nThe Spenglers are back and teaming up with the OG Ghostbusters in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire which returns the series to where it started: the New York City firehouse.\n\nWhen a deadly chill hits the city, the old and new Ghostbusters must learn to work together to save the world from a second Ice Age.\n\nRather than having to jump around the movies, you only need to omit a movie in order to watch the Ghostbusters movies in chronological order.\n\nThe 2016 reboot Ghostbusters – also known as Ghostbusters: Answer the Call – has no real connection to the other movies. The original Ghostbusters cast, except for the late Harold Ramis, all have cameo roles, but as different characters.\n\nIt means that the 2016 movie exists in its own Ghostbusters timeline which, sadly, looks like it'll just contain the one movie.\n\nThis makes the chronological order of the Ghostbusters movies as follows:\n\n• Ghostbusters (1984)\n\n• Ghostbusters II (1989)\n\n• Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021)\n\n• Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (2024)\n\nAs with the release order, you can include the two animated shows if you wanted, but they don't really have any impact on the main movies.\n\nIf you wanted to do this, watch The Real Ghostbusters after the first movie and then Extreme Ghostbusters after the sequel."
