        "text": "He might be fighting a frozen empire … but his body set the internet ablaze.\n\nErnie Hudson, star of the “Ghostbusters” franchise, sent the internet into a meltdown over his toned, ripped body.\n\nThe buzz on social media started when Hudson, 78, appeared at a London screening of his film “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” in a tight-fitting black T-shirt and dark-wash jeans.\n\n“I see your Lenny Kravitz at 60, and raise you Mr. Ernie Hudson, 78,” one user on X (formerly Twitter) posted, referring to the sex symbol status of Kravitz.\n\n“Sweet baby Jesus, I’m lusting after someone’s Grandpappy,” a second user lusted.\n\n“And I got 78 ways to take care of him … as a caregiver of course. Respect to his wife,” a third person giggled.\n\nHudson told People that he was both flattered and shocked over the attention he received.\n\n“It’s nice to be noticed. It’s been a little bit of a surprise in the last couple of days,” he told the outlet on Saturday. “I’ve always been in what I consider fairly good shape, but normally, when I do those press conferences, I’m usually in a suit or a sport coat.”\n\nThe father of four and a two-time cancer survivor said that while he’s not a gym rat, he’s always strived to be healthy.\n\n“My career hasn’t been about focusing on my physicality,” he said. “The most important thing for me is just to try to maintain your health, just common-sense stuff.”\n\n“I see these guys who really pump up and they got these massive arms and six-packs and all that, that’s not what my career has been about.”\n\nThe “Miss Congeniality” actor revealed that his secret to looking so buff comes from working with a personal trainer and a pilates instructor. He also hits the gym three times a week.\n\n“When I see this guy, he will put me through some stuff that I feel like for the next couple of days I’m going to be sore. As painful as it is, I actually kind of enjoy it,” he said of his trainer.\n\nHudson credits his wife of 40 years, Linda Kingsberg, for helping him stay active by having a shared goal of walking 10,000 steps a day too.\n\n“I’ve always looked at physicality more from a spiritual perspective than a physical,” he added. “The spiritual thing dictates the physical more than the other way around. So when I’m in a good space, I’m aware of just how I’m living my life, the other things fall in place.”\n\nRecently, the “Oz” actor reprised his role of Winston Zeddemore in the 2024 movie alongside Paul Rudd, Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd.\n\nHe previously claimed he had been “sidelined” in the original 1984 movie.\n\n“I was the guy who was brought in, and so finding my place in the middle of that — and they were all welcoming and inclusive,” Hudson said during an appearance on “The Howard Stern Wrap-Up Show.”\n\n“The studio wasn’t, and the studio continued not to be. So it made it very, very difficult, because I was a part of it but then I very selectively was pushed aside,” he said, adding that he was “not on the poster” for the film’s 30th anniversary in 2014.\n\n“I went to the 30th-anniversary release of the movie and all the posters are three guys,” he said. “Now I know the fans see it differently, and I’m so thankful for the fans because the fans basically identified with Winston, especially young, I don’t want to say minority kids, but a lot of kids.”\n\nHudson claimed that viewers were supposed to meet Winston “in the very beginning of the movie,” instead of halfway through.\n\nHe felt the script changes “felt deliberate.”"
