        "text": "The news of an all-female Ghostbusters reboot has been met with decidedly mixed reactions in certain corners of the internet. But whether they're for or against Feig's proposed reboot, nobody has a good word to say about the original film's sequel, Ghostbusters II (1989), and this, frankly, will not stand. Though perceived as a failure, the sequel is a far, far better film than its reputation suggests.\n\nFive years on from the phenomenal success of the original, Ghostbusters II reassembles all the same creative elements - scripting by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, Ivan Reitman as director, the entire cast reprising their roles. The key players were famously reluctant, but the film had made a ridiculous amount of money and spawned the hugely successful spin-off cartoon The Real Ghostbusters, so the follow-up was inevitable.\n\nDespite a briefly record-breaking opening weekend of $29 million, Ghostbusters II went on to make a mere $112 million at the US box office, which doesn't sound bad until you compare it with the first film's domestic take of $242 million. It didn't help that Tim Burton's Batman came out the following week, vastly overshadowing Ghostbusters II both in terms of box office success and cultural impact.\n\nReitman himself places some of the blame with Batman. \"We probably waited a little bit too long for Ghostbusters II,\" he told Digital Spy last year. \"It was five years in the cycle so I think that affected it. We came out six days before Tim Burton's reinvention of Batman, which was kind of the flavour of that year. We somehow got compared with that movie even though we were a different kind of animal altogether. I would happily stack up this movie with Batman - if you watch them both together today I think we'll come out just fine.\"\n\nThe film also fared badly with critics, who claimed that it's basically just a beat-for-beat rehash of the first movie, and it's hard to argue with that. Aside from obvious similarities like a finale wherein giant figures stomp down the streets of New York, the film features identical plot elements (interfering bureaucrats, nerds being co-opted by evil forces) and even mirrors the structure of its predecessor, right down to the mid-way montage scored by the film's hit single.\n\nStill, you can't fault Aykroyd and Ramis for trying to slavishly recreate a successful formula, and it's not as if they're devoid of new ideas. The plot itself is original and imaginative: having disbanded after being sued for damages following the events of the first film, the Ghostbusters reunite when a River of Slime is discovered under New York City, slime that has been generated by the enormous amount of rage and negative energy in the city itself. At the same time, the painting-dwelling ghost of Vigo the Carpathian (Wilhelm von Homburg) sets its sights on Dana's (Sigourney Weaver) adorable baby Oscar as a path to world domination.\n\nArguably, that plot is an improvement on the first film and it's certainly better executed, with the two seemingly disparate elements dove-tailing seamlessly in the third act. The finale is also an inspired feel-good idea, with the discovery that the \"Mood Slime\" (as Bill Murray's Venkman dubs it) also reacts to the positive energy of New Yorkers rallying round and saving the day with a chorus of 'Auld Lang Syne'.\n\nIronically, while that ending plays perfectly to today's audiences (Sam Raimi's Spider-Man did something similar), Reitman saw the ending as being part of the problem: \"It was a time where - very much like the theme of Ghostbusters II - bad vibes were permeating society, particularly New York City where there was some underlying negativity floating through. I think that was, in general, the sense of things in that era. It made Batman feel very current, a very black and dark movie. Ours was all about optimism and felt a little out of its time.\"\n\nThe film was also accused of pandering to a younger audience, but with the exception of the aesthetic changes to Annie Potts's character (in line with Janine's more outlandish appearance in the cartoon) and the shoe-horning of greedy green ghost Slimer (it's telling that Slimer doesn't share any scenes with the main cast, only Rick Moranis), it's hard to see how that's really true, and it certainly didn't stop various risquÃ© lines getting through.\n\nAt any rate, within an admittedly familiar structure Ghostbusters II expertly delivers the same blend of humour, scares, thrills and special effects that made the first film such a hit. Often it delivers them all at once, as in the standout moment when a woman's fur coat comes to life, attacks her and then scampers off down the street.\n\nIn fact, the film is packed with laugh-out-loud moments, whether it's expertly timed slapstick (Ray gesticulating excitedly in a restaurant and covering patrons in slime), inspired visual gags (the dancing toaster) or brilliant throwaway one-liners, such as Egon's line about not having any toys when he was a child: \"I had part of a Slinky... but I straightened it.\"\n\nReitman significantly improves the scares-to-laughs ratio the second time out - the only really scary bit in the first film (until the climax) is the early library scene, but the sequel busts out several effective shock moments, including the jump-out-of-your-seat bit with the ghostly heads on sticks; the bit with Dana's bathtub coming alive (brilliantly, the film credits both a Bathtub Trainer and a Bathtub Wrangler); and the deeply creepy moment with a ghostly, demonic-looking Janosz (Peter MacNicol) stealing baby Oscar off a window ledge.\n\n\"The second one was disappointing, because the special-effects guys took over,\" Murray has said. \"I had something like two scenes, and they're the only funny ones in the movie.\" He's wrong - not only do the film's special effects stand up today (you can't quite say the same of the animated dog effects in the first film), but Venkman in particular gets a damn sight more character development here than he did in the first film (notably in the way he's matured since his break-up with Dana) and just as many one-liners, such as the look he gives to camera when a psychic suggests the world will end on February 14 (\"Valentine's Day? Bummer\").\n\nGhostbusters II is thoroughly enjoyable and completely stands up to its predecessor, expanding on the original film's great characters and delivering the same expert blend of comedy, scares, action and special effects. If you've never seen it before, then you're in for a treat and if you haven't seen it for a while, then it's definitely worth revisiting. So, come on, who ya gonna call?"
