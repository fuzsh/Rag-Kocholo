        "text": "“Ghostbusters” isn’t just a movie; it’s a cultural touchstone. Released in 1984, the original film ruled the hearts of audiences with its unique blend of humor, horror, and supernatural thrills. The story follows a team of parapsychologists who chase and catch New York City’s rogue ghosts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir adventures are filled with iconic characters, memorable visuals, and a healthy dose of comedic wit. Among the talented cast is Ernie Hudson who has starred in every Ghostbusters movie as Winston Zeddemore. Hudson recently spoke about Ghostbusters’ prolonged success and the reason behind it.\n\nErnie Hudson Credits The New York City For The Success of Ghostbusters\n\nErnie Hudson has portrayed Winston Zeddemore in all five Ghostbusters movies including the latest Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. Zeddemore is a cornerstone of the franchise and is a former military man with a level head and practical skills. He is a valuable asset to the team, often acting as the voice of reason amidst the team’s outlandish adventures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHudson recently sat down on Spectrum News’ Morning on 1 talk show. The actor talked about how crucial New York City is to the movie series. Hudson believes that New York is like nothing else and captures the essence of the fight against evil, something around which Ghostbusters revolves.\n\n“It is a New York film. I mean, it’s an amazing city—a city unlike anyplace else in the world. And I think ‘Ghostbusters’ sort of captures that. And if we’re going to have to fight the forces of evil, New York seems to be the place to be”\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire takes fans back to New York City – where it all started. This time, the old and the new heroes of the series will have to work together to stop a second Ice Age from happening. Hudson firmly credits the city as one reason behind Ghostbuster’s huge success.\n\nHe also thanked the fans for their love of the movie. Even four decades later, they turn to theatres to watch the latest movies, now with their kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s been over half my life—40 years. I mean, that’s pretty amazing. And I just so love the fans who are like family, I mean, they turn their cars into ectomobiles and put on the jumpsuits and 40 years later, they’re still doing it with the children.”\n\n“I think when you work with people you really like, and you really respect, work is always a lot of fun. The new cast—Paul Rudd, Carrie Coons—they are amazing. And it’s so wonderful to come and work with people who you know will be on point and you don’t have to worry about it,” Hudson said. “I just have to bring my best and show up and it’s just a great set and a great group of people to be with after all these years.” – Ernie Hudson on Morning on 1\n\nIt is evident that Hudson loves nothing more than putting on the jumpsuit to capture the ghosts of New York City.\n\nHow Many Ghostbusters Movies Are There?\n\nTo date, there have been a total of five Ghostbusters movies. It all began with Ghostbusters (1984) and continued with Ghostbusters II in 1989. Both the movies were directed by and produced by Ivan Reitman.\n\n27 years later, another Ghostbusters was released which acted as a reboot of the original franchise. The plan did not work quite well and in 2021, Ghostbusters: Afterlife was released. It was in continuity with the original series and was directed by Reitman’s son Ivan Reitman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fifth instalment in the franchise is Frozen Empire which will be released in theatres on March 22, 2024."
