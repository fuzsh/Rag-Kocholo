        "text": "Like his character Winston Zeddemore in the 1984 classic “Ghostbusters,” Ernie Hudson likes having a steady paycheck.\n\nThe Benton Harbor native, 74, considers himself a working actor, appearing in more than 100 movies and TV shows. He’s also known for 1994’s “The Crow” (set in Detroit) opposite the late Brandon Lee and 2000’s “Miss Congeniality” opposite Oscar winner Sandra Bullock.\n\nThis year, he’s appearing on three TV series: the police drama “L.A.’s Finest” (the second season is now streaming on Spectrum with FOX currently replaying the first season), the Netflix comedy “Grace and Frankie,” and BET’s “The Family Business” (which will resume before the end of 2020). In 2021, he’ll reprise his role as Winston in “Ghostbusters: Afterlife.”\n\n“I get offered a lot of things,” said Hudson, who now lives in Los Angeles. “What appeals to me is I want a role, a chance to explore a character while I can still do it and hit my mark. To me, I feel free now that I can actually work because I want to. I want to stand by the work. I’m looking for roles that are gonna be fun or I’d rather be home. I don’t want to make any choices about what I did this or that. That’s where I am now. If the role’s not interesting, I’d rather not do it.”\n\nA 1964 alumnus of Benton Harbor High School, Hudson received his undergraduate degree in theater from Wayne State University, where he’s also a Distinguished Alumni. From 1985 to 2005, he served as a volunteer police officer in the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department in California.\n\nOn “L.A.’s Finest,” Hudson plays Joseph Vaughn, a former cop and the estranged father of Det. Sydney “Syd” Burnett (Gabrielle Union, reprising her role from 2003’s “Bad Boys II”) and Det. Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence). Part of the “Bad Boys” franchise starring Lawrence and Will Smith, it was announced earlier this week that “L.A.’s Finest” was canceled.\n\n“The entire first season, we’re trying to reconnect – it’s painful and awkward and all that. He wants to very much be in his daughter’s life, but she’s very resistant to that. Over the course of two seasons, they’ve found that common ground and realize they both need each other,” explained Hudson. “He becomes that voice of reason every dad wants to be. She learns to trust. He spends a lot of time pulling her off the edge – or trying to, at any rate. She’s certainly her own person and he has to make peace with that&mldr; He becomes a real asset to her because he was in the department for many years, so he definitely knows what he’s talking about.”\n\nHudson praised Union and Jessica Alba, who plays Syd’s partner Det. Nancy McKenna.\n\n“Gabrielle’s an amazing actress. I don’t say that lightly because I’ve worked with a lot of people. She and Jessica have done some extraordinary work. It’s really fun for me to play with her, to have these scenes where we work through our stuff,” said Hudson. “Jessica takes this role to another level; it’s like she has another gear that I didn’t know was there. They’re doing some quality work and I hope it doesn’t go unnoticed. It’s one of the few shows over my 50-plus years of acting that I sit down to watch. It’s very hard for me to look at my work and myself, but when I see scenes that I did with Gabrielle and Jessica, I go, ‘Wow, they were really good.’”\n\n“I adore (Ernie),” said Alba. “His kindness, warmth, class, and professionalism is second to none. It’s also a little bit awkward because sometimes I geek out a bit when I look over and see his face and remember how many times I enjoyed his work growing up – in all the movies and, even more recently, on ‘Grace and Frankie!’”\n\nHudson also plays Jacob, the boyfriend of Frankie (Emmy winner/fellow Wayne State alum Lily Tomlin) on the critically-acclaimed “Grace and Frankie.” The show follows Grace (Oscar winner Jane Fonda) and Frankie, whose respective husbands Robert (Golden Globe winner Martin Sheen) and Sol (Golden Globe winner Sam Waterston) leave them – for each other. Robert and Sol become a couple, while the titular characters – who never liked each other – become friends.\n\n“I’ve always been a fan of Lily’s, but I’d never thought I’d be playing her boyfriend,” confessed Hudson. “I’ve been acting for 50-plus years but they’ve been stars for a long time, especially Jane – she’s like royalty. We shoot at Paramount and right down the street is the Henry Fonda Theater. I have great reverence for these people – Lily, Jane, Martin, Sam&mldr; They have this old-school approach&mldr; they come prepared, they’re ready to work, and they’re always looking to make it better&mldr; These are guys who are on-point and I’m so thankful I got a chance to work with them.”\n\n“Ernie is the perfect romantic foil for Frankie,” said Detroit native Tomlin. “When Ernie came on the show, women all over exclaimed over this pairing. He is such a charming, sexy man and I always look forward to the scenes we’re playing. And what a voice and that pair of eyes. He’s just a fabulously beautiful actor and man.”\n\nHudson also dons the hat of producer of “The Family Business,” which was shut down in the middle of the second season due to the coronavirus pandemic. Filming recently resumed but under strict protocols from actors union SAG-AFTRA. This includes taking people’s temperatures daily, testing them three times/week for the coronavirus, spraying people’s clothes with sanitizer, and having medical personnel on set. The crew is always wearing masks and so are the actors if they’re not on-camera.\n\n“Normally, we film episode to episode in chronological order but because of the pandemic, we don’t have everybody all the time,” explained Hudson. “Only so many people are allowed on set&mldr; so we’re shooting all the episodes at the same time. I’ve never worked that way before. It seems to be working well. I’m sure it’ll be an editing nightmare for somebody, but we’re getting it done. It was a different way of working, but it went well.”\n\nIn \"The Family Business,\" Hudson plays L.C. Duncan, CEO of Duncan Motors. An affluent and powerful businessman, L.C. has dealings in both the legitimate business world and the underworld. He decides to retire and enjoy his golden years with his wife and grandkids, passing the mantel of leadership on to his children, all of whom have their own agendas.\n\n“The show’s about relationships,” said Hudson. “I notice a lot of (Blacks and other minorities) feel they’re outside of the system and don’t feel that they can win by playing by the rules per se. They feel they have to work outside of the system. L.C. and his wife are very ambitious, very driven, but the entire family works together; they’re all involved in this enterprise.”\n\nHad L.C. been merciless, Hudson wouldn’t have taken the part.\n\n“One of the things missing in so-called Black shows about the Black experience is sometimes they leave out the humanity,” he said. “Some of these things are so vicious, there’s no humanity. I go, ‘My God, I don’t get the humanity of these people.’ L.C.’s humanity is still there. He can be ruthless but he has a sense of honor&mldr; He’s a fair guy who loves his family.”\n\nHudson said he's grateful to return to the role of Winston in \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife,\" the fourth film in the “Ghostbusters” franchise and direct sequel to 1989’s “Ghostbusters II.” It’s directed by Jason Reitman, son of Ivan Reitman, who directed the first two movies (the 2016 “Ghostbusters” reboot with an all-female cast, directed by Michigan native Paul Feig, occurred in a “parallel universe,” according to Hudson).\n\n“Honestly, it sounds silly, but it was a spiritual thing,\" Hudson said. \"I was grateful to go back and see Dan Akroyd, Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, and meet this amazing new cast of young people. It’s spiritual in the sense that they’ve been talking about it for so many years, it reached a point where I honestly never thought it would happen.\n\n\"Then I got a call from Jason that it was happening&mldr; it had such a huge impact on my life. The fans for 35 years have been so loyal. I always wanted to do another because I felt the fans wanted to continue that&mldr; The fans themselves kept it going with a genuine love for the movies. I am touched by that. I wanted to be a part of it.”"
