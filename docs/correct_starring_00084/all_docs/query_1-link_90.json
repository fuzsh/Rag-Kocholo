        "text": "Who ya gonna call? “Ghostbusters” star Ernie Hudson appeared at Syracuse City Hall on Friday to officially kick off the 2019 Salt City Comic Con weekend.\n\nThe 73-year-old actor appeared in costume as his movie character, Winston Zeddemore, alongside Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh to officially declare City Hall free of ghosts. He held up a ghost trap and a jar of green slime to a cheering crowd of “Ghostbusters” fans, many of whom wore their own ghost-busting costumes with proton packs.\n\n“Everyone can relax,” Hudson said as Zeddemore. “We caught the ghost, plus we neutralized Slimer.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview with syracuse.com, Hudson also reflected on the movie’s legacy, discussed the upcoming 2020 sequel, and whether he’s afraid of no ghosts.\n\n“I’m just very honored that fans love the movie, and support the movie, and they participate in the movie with their cars and jumpsuits and backpacks. They share it with their children, and their parents,\" Hudson said. \"It’s truly an honor for me.”\n\nThe 1984 movie starred Hudson as Winston, an everyday man who becomes a ghost hunter alongside a crew with scientific and parapsychology backgrounds, including Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis). Together, they catch ghosts terrorizing New York City, helping possessed people like Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and Louis Tully (Rick Moranis).\n\nThe constantly-quoted comedy classic inspired a 1989 sequel, “Ghostbusters II,” and a female-led reboot in 2016 simply called “Ghostbusters.” What makes the story continue to resonate with audiences today?\n\n“I think the movie’s about friendship,” Hudson explained. “It’s about regular people making a difference dealing with fears that we all have. Fears about what’s beyond the five senses, who’s in the closet when the lights go out, and they bravely deal with it.”\n\nAnd does Hudson believe in ghosts?\n\n“I think it’s very primal. I think there’s something that we know that’s beyond what we’re seeing. What it is, I don’t know. I think it’s primal and that’s part of who we are. The movie’s one of the few that actually dealt with [the topic] in a way that’s fun,\" Hudson said.\n\nA new sequel is in the works that will be a direct followup to the 1989 movie. Jason Reitman, the son of the original 1984 film’s director Ivan Reitman, is helming the new movie tentatively titled “Ghostbusters 2020,\" set for a July 10, 2020, release date.\n\nOnly three cast members are reportedly confirmed for “Ghostbusters 2020″: Paul Rudd (“Ant-Man”), Finn Wolfhard (“Stranger Things”) and McKenna Grace (“Gifted”). However, Hudson is rumored to be reprising his role as Zeddemore alongside original cast members, including Murray, Aykroyd, Weaver and Annie Potts; Ramis died in 2014.\n\nIf Hudson knows more, he won’t say.\n\n“I know they’re doing [Ghostbusters 2020],\" he told syracuse.com. \"I know Jason Reitman is going to direct it. He’s an amazing filmmaker. I’d love to be a part of it. I don’t have a deal yet, and I hope it works out. But no matter what, I know Jason’s going to make a great movie.”\n\n2020 will also be the 25th anniversary of another one of Hudson’s biggest roles in “Congo,” the 1995 movie based on the book by “Jurassic Park” author Michael Crichton. The actor played a guide for a dangerous expedition to find a crew that went missing in Africa while searching for diamonds, alongside a cast that included Laura Linney, Dylan Walsh, Tim Curry, Joe Don Baker and Bruce Campbell.\n\nHudson said the guide, Monroe Kelly, was one of his favorite characters to play.\n\n“I loved making ‘Congo.’ I think it was a good movie, and the message (about man vs. nature) is there, but it’s also a lot of fun,\" Hudson said with a smile. \"Kind of a popcorn movie. And I love the character. I’m glad that after 25 years it’s still [enjoyable].”\n\nHudson will remain in Syracuse for Day 1 of the 2019 Salt City Comic Con, which runs this Saturday, July 6, and Sunday, July 7, at the new Exposition Center at the New York State Fairgrounds. He’ll be appearing at the pop culture, fan and comics convention on Saturday to sign autographs and pose for photos alongside the Ecto-1A vehicle from the movies.\n\nSalt City Comic Con opens at 10 a.m. both days with cosplay (such as the Hulkbuster, Batman and “The Wizard of Oz”); trivia contests; and nearly 100 vendors and exhibitors offering comics, toys, artwork and collectibles.\n\nCelebrity guests include:\n\nErnie Hudson (Saturday only), known for roles in “Ghostbusters,” “Congo,” “Oz” and more than 200 other movies and TV shows. Hudson will be available for photo ops with the Ecto-1a vehicle.\n\nLita, WWE Women’s Champion and Hall of Fame member (Saturday only)\n\nButch Patrick, best known for playing Eddie Munster on “The Munsters”\n\nMark Wald, comic writer of “Daredevil,” “The Flash,” “Archie,” “Ant-Man & the Wasp” and others\n\nComics creators Tom Peyer and Frank Cammuso of Syracuse’s AHOY Comics\n\nPro wrestlers Sabu, The Super Genie and The Rock 'N' Roll Express\n\nDwight “Doc” Gooden, New York Mets Hall of Fame pitcher\n\nAdmission is $20 for adults and $10 for children on Saturday; $15 for adults and $10 for children on Sunday; and $30 for a weekend pass for adults and $20 for a weekend pass for children. Kids 4 and under are free.\n\nA limited number of VIP Weekend passes, which includes a limited edition The Amazing Spider-Man #24 Salt City Comic Con variant comic, are available for $100. The special comic will only be sold at the Salt City Comic Con and the first-ever comic con day at the New York State Fair on Aug. 28."
