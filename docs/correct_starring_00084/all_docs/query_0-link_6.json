        "text": "American actor (born 1945)\n\nFor the politician, see Ernie Hudson (politician).\n\nEarnest Lee Hudson (born December 17, 1945) is an American actor. He is known for his role as Winston Zeddemore in the Ghostbusters franchise. Hudson has also acted in the films Leviathan (1989), The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992), The Crow (1994), Airheads (1994), The Basketball Diaries (1995), Congo (1995), Miss Congeniality (2000), and The Ron Clark Story (2006).\n\nOn television, his most prominent role was Warden Leo Glynn on HBO's Oz (1997–2003). Hudson has also appeared in the television shows St. Elsewhere (1984), The Last Precinct (1986), 10-8: Officers on Duty (2003–2004), Desperate Housewives (2006–2007), The Secret Life of the American Teenager (2008–2013), Law & Order (2009–2010), the voice of Agent Bill Fowler in Transformers: Prime (2010–2013), Franklin & Bash (2012–2014), Grace and Frankie (2015–2020), and L.A.'s Finest (2019–2020). From 2022 to 2024, Hudson appeared as Herbert \"Magic\" Williams on the NBC drama Quantum Leap.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHudson was born in Benton Harbor, Michigan. He never knew his father. His mother, Maggie Donald,[2] died of tuberculosis when he was two months old. He was subsequently raised by his maternal grandmother, Arrana Donald.\n\nHudson joined the U.S. Marine Corps immediately after high school but was discharged after only three months on medical grounds due to asthma.[3] Having moved to Detroit, he became the resident playwright at Concept East, the oldest black theater company in the United States. He enrolled at Wayne State University to further develop his writing and acting skills, graduating in 1973. He established the Actors' Ensemble Theatre where he and other talented young black writers directed and appeared in their own works. He began a doctoral program at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities before leaving to appear in a stage production of The Great White Hope.[4] Later, he studied toward a Master of Fine Arts in acting at Yale School of Drama, but left after a year to appear in Leadbelly.[5]\n\nIn an interview with Belief.net, Hudson stated that he is a practicing Christian, but does not believe that \"one church is the right one\".[citation needed]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of Hudson's early film roles is in Penitentiary II (1982) starring Leon Isaac Kennedy. He had various guest roles on television series such as The Dukes of Hazzard and The A-Team. He was on the television series Fantasy Island in a first-season episode as a voodoo man named Jamu. Hudson gained fame playing Winston Zeddemore in the 1984 feature film Ghostbusters and its 1989 sequel, Ghostbusters II. He auditioned to reprise the role for the animated series, The Real Ghostbusters, but it was given to Arsenio Hall.[6] He had a major supporting role as the mentally challenged handyman Solomon in The Hand that Rocks the Cradle (1992).\n\nHudson was cast as Warden Leo Glynn on HBO's series Oz, and his son Ernie Hudson Jr. co-starred with him as Muslim inmate Hamid Khan. Hudson also appears as the character Munro in Congo (1995) and as Police Sergeant Albrecht in The Crow (1994). He switched gears when he played a preacher opening the eyes of a small town's prejudice in the 1950s in A Stranger in the Kingdom. He played Harry McDonald, the FBI superior of Sandra Bullock's character in the feature film Miss Congeniality (2000). He is in the Stargate SG-1 episode \"Ethon\" as Pernaux. He appeared as Reggie in the 1995 film The Basketball Diaries. In 2006, he appeared in the television film The Ron Clark Story as Principal Turner. In 2008, he began a recurring role as Dr. Fields on The Secret Life of the American Teenager. He had a recurring role on the final season of Law & Order as Lt. Anita Van Buren's boyfriend and then fiancé.\n\nIn 2011, he played Stuart Owens in Torchwood: Miracle Day.[7]\n\nBeginning in 2015, Hudson was cast in a recurring role as Jacob, an organic farmer who is the romantic interest for Frankie Bergstein (Lily Tomlin) in the series Grace and Frankie.[8]\n\nHudson appeared in the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot, playing Bill Jenkins, the uncle of Leslie Jones's lead character Pattie Tolan.[9]\n\nIn 2019, Hudson began starring in L.A.'s Finest, playing the estranged father of Gabrielle Union's character. Hudson called it \"a very different show\", citing the duality of having to protect people as a member of law enforcement while having unresolved relationships that need to be reconciled.[10] Spectrum canceled the series after two seasons the following year.[11]\n\nIn August 2019, he confirmed his involvement in Ghostbusters: Afterlife directed by Jason Reitman, joining original cast members Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Annie Potts.[12][13] Hudson described himself as being welled by emotions after he put on his jumpsuit and proton pack, as he had previously \"accepted that [a film] was never going to happen\".[14]\n\nHudson appeared in the 2022 drama film Prisoner's Daughter, alongside Kate Beckinsale and Brian Cox.[15]\n\nOn March 8, 2022, Hudson was announced as the co-lead in NBC's Quantum Leap reboot.[16]\n\nIn January 2023, Hudson guest voiced a character, Grini Millegi, a Dowutin gangster who was an associate of Cid and oversees Riot Racing on the planet Safa Toma, on Star Wars: The Bad Batch.[17]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHudson married his first wife, Jeannie Moore, in 1963, when she was sixteen and he was eighteen.[18] They had two sons, Ernie Hudson Jr. and Rahaman Hudson. When Hudson and Jeannie divorced in 1976, their sons moved to live with Hudson in California.[19][20] In 1985, Hudson married former flight attendant Linda Kingsberg, and they had two sons, Andrew and Ross.[18]\n\nOn June 8, 2024, a portion of South Fair Avenue (M-139) near Hudson's childhood home in Benton Harbor was given the honorary name \"Ernie Hudson Way\".[21][22]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1976 Leadbelly Archie 1976 The Human Tornado Bo 1979 The Main Event Killer 1980 Joni Earl 1980 The Octagon Quinine 1980 The Jazz Singer Heckler 1981 Underground Aces African General 1982 Penitentiary II 'Half Dead' 1983 Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone Washington 1983 Going Berserk Muhammed Jerome Willy 1983 Two of a Kind Detective Skaggs 1984 Ghostbusters Winston Zeddemore 1984 National Lampoon's Joy of Sex Mr. Porter 1987 Weeds Bagdad 1988 The Wrong Guys Dawson 1989 Leviathan Justin Jones 1989 Collision Course 'Shortcut' 1989 Trapper County War Jefferson Carter 1989 Ghostbusters II Winston Zeddemore 1992 The Hand That Rocks the Cradle Solomon 1993 The Pitch Vet Short film 1994 Sugar Hill Lolly Jonas 1994 The Crow Sergeant Daryl Albrecht 1994 No Escape Hawkins 1994 The Cowboy Way Officer Sam 'Mad Dog' Shaw 1994 Airheads Sergeant O'Malley 1994 Speechless Dan Ventura 1995 The Basketball Diaries Reggie 1995 Congo Captain Monroe Kelly 1996 The Substitute Principal Claude Rolle 1996 For Which He Stands DEA Agent Baxter 1996 Just Your Luck Willie Direct-to-video 1997 Levitation 'Downbeat' 1997 Fakin' da Funk Joe Lee 1997 Mr. Magoo CIA Agent Gus Anders 1997 A Stranger in the Kingdom Reverend Walter Andrews 1998 Butter Curtis '8 Ball' Harris 1998 Best of the Best 4: Without Warning Detective Gresko Direct-to-video 1998 Hijack Senator Douglas Wilson 1998 October 22 Arthur 1999 Interceptor Major McKenzie 1999 Stealth Fighter President Westwood 1999 Paper Bullets Detective Ron Mills 1999 Lillie Larry Miller 2000 Everything's Jake Jake 2000 Red Letters Detective Glen Teal 2000 The Watcher FBI Special Agent Mike Ibby 2000 Miss Congeniality FBI Assistant Director Harry McDonald 2003 Anne B.
