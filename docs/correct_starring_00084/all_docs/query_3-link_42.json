        "text": "The next generation of Ghostbusters are back in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire as the series moves back to its spiritual home of New York City.\n\n2021’s Afterlife was a hugely successful ghostbusting reboot and introduced the iconic 80s franchise to a new generation. The film featured a talented new cast, including Handmaid’s Tale star Mckenna Grace and Finn Wolfhard of Stranger Things fame. Much to the delight of fans, it also reunited the original Ghostbusters stars, including Bill Murray.\n\nGrossing $200m (£160m) at the global box office it told the story of a single mother and her two kids who moved to a seemingly mundane town in Oklahoma, where strange things started to occur.\n\nRead more: Ghostbusters movies ranked from worst to best\n\nNot long after they arrive begin to discover their family connection to the original Ghostbusters and must continue their ghost-trapping legacy.\n\nSince the first Ghostbusters film in 1984 — starring Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd — the franchise has exploded into a worldwide phenomenon, grossing millions of dollars and spawning a huge range of toys, comic books, video games and merchandise.\n\nFrozen Empire sees the new proton pack gang teaming up with the classic team to once again battle the supernatural and protect the public from spooks, spectres and marshmallow ghouls.\n\nAs it arrives on streaming, here’s everything you need to know about the Ghostbusters sequel.\n\nWhere can I stream Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire?\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire is now available to buy and rent on Prime Video, Apple TV, Sky Store and other streaming services now.\n\nThe sequel was released in UK cinemas and Imax in 22 March. It was originally slated for release at Christmas 2023, but was delayed amid Hollywood strikes.\n\nWhat are the reviews like?\n\nListen... do you smell something? It’s Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire reviews — they’ve finally landed online and given us our first reactions to director Gil Kenan’s follow-up to sentimental franchise restarter Ghostbusters: Afterlife. The verdict so far? About as lukewarm as a half-toasted marshmallow.\n\nThe Independent said that “Frozen Empire is a notable improvement on Afterlife,” calling it “funny, silly and a little scary.” Their review concluded by saying “we’re finally on the way to a Ghostbusters film that actually feels like a Ghostbusters film.”\n\nThe Guardian wasn’t so kind, with their review suggesting that it may be time to keep the franchise in the ghost trap for good. “There are one or two laughs here and an attempt at a queer romance,” it said, “but no real signs of life.” Variety had more fun, labelling it “a livelier movie than Afterlife” and praising Kumail Nanjiani’s comedic performance.\n\nRead more reviews below.\n\nThe Independent: Funny, silly, and a little scary, the franchise finally returns to fun (3-min read)\n\nThe Guardian: Time to consign franchise to the spirit realm (3-min read)\n\nVariety: A Bigger, Rowdier and (Slightly) Funnier Fan-Service Grab Bag Than ‘Ghostbusters: Afterlife’ (6-min read)\n\nTotal Film: Doesn't touch the original movies but likeable enough (2-min read)\n\nWhat happens in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire?\n\nThe official synopsis explains: “In Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, the Spengler family returns to where it all started – the iconic New York City firehouse – to team up with the original Ghostbusters, who’ve developed a top-secret research lab to take busting ghosts to the next level.\n\n“But when the discovery of an ancient artifact unleashes an evil force, Ghostbusters new and old must join forces to protect their home and save the world from a second Ice Age.”\n\nWith a new frozen foe threatening to unleash an arm of ghosts, the Ghostbusters look to have their work cut out for them in their latest outing.\n\nIs there a trailer for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire?\n\nAs Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire creeps towards cinemas, the film’s final trailer made its way online, warning viewers that all hell was about to break loose across New York — and the world.\n\nBefore this hit, we were treated to a full-length trailer for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire in January, with the teaser giving us a better look at the film’s ice-cold villain and the deadly threat they pose.\n\nAs if this wasn’t good enough, an international trailer also made its way online featuring a trap-load of new footage. Watch it below:\n\nMeanwhile, the debut trailer for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire was shared in November 2023, providing our first real look at the movie’s chilly plotline.\n\nWatch it below.\n\nWho is in the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire cast?\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and William Atherton, who all appeared in the earlier Ghostbusters films.\n\nSpeaking to CBS This Morning about the reunion, Murray said: “I’m thinking it’s fun that we’ve made something that’s lasted this long.\n\n“That’s really kind of the best part of it, of seeing it as a movie, as a worker. But the most fun is seeing these people. That’s when we get together, and we remember the pain of before, and the fun of before, and the pain and the fun of the future.”\n\nOther cast members include Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Kumail Nanjiani, Patton Oswalt, Celeste O’Connor, Logan Kim and British stand-up comedian James Acaster.\n\nWho directed Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire?\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire was directed by Gil Kenan, who co-wrote the script with Ghostbusters: Afterlife director Jason Reitman. Reitman is the son of the late Ivan Reitman, who directed the original two Ghostbusters films.\n\n“A few years ago, my father handed me the keys to Ecto-1,” said Reitman, “and together we made Ghostbusters: Afterlife. Words will never express how grateful I am to have made a film with my father by my side.\n\nRead more: The cartoon that kept the Ghostbusters flame alight\n\n“It’s now time to hand those keys to my creative partner and fellow Ghostbuster Gil Kenan, a brilliant director who will keep the Spengler spirit alive. I can only hope to provide him the same producorial care and support that my father showed me.”\n\n“It’s an absolute honour to pick up the proton pack and step behind the camera for the next chapter of the Spengler family saga,” said Kenan. “I just wish I could go back to 1984 and tell the kid in the sixth row of the Mann Valley West that one day he was going to get to direct a Ghostbusters film.”"
