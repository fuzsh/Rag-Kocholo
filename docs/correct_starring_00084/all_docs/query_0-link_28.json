        "text": "Spirits (Like You) Are Unleashed as Ghostbusters Goes Asymmetrical in New Video Game\n\nThis week, Lakewood, Colorado-based Illfonic officially revealed a trailer, gameplay, and all of the details for their upcoming asymmetrical 4v1 multiplayer game Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed coming later this year in 2022 to PC, PlayStation and Xbox platforms (and it’s cross-platform for extra multiplayer goodness).\n\nThe official reveal comes shortly after comments were made by Illfonic’s team that they had been working on developing a game, but not much was known at that point. However, we now know the game will revolve around “light” story elements that take place after Ghostbusters: Afterlife and featuring Ray and Winston (voiced by Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson, respectively).\n\nBut the real meat and potatoes of the game will be the multiplayer which allows a team of four playable and customizable Ghostbusters to hunt a playable ghost character as they terrorize and frighten the general public. That’s right, not only can you create your own Ghostbuster character and build their career from the ground up, but you can also cross over to the other side and play from an ectoplasmic point of view.\n\nI’m definitely looking forward to hopping online with Ghostbusters friends and getting a few rounds in as soon as the game goes live. While this doesn’t sound as intensive of a game like the Ghostbusters: The Video Game and its remastered counterpart were, this sounds like a great bridge to keep the story from Afterlife flowing and for all of us to reconnect and zap and trap a few ghosts. And adding in Ernie Hudson and Dan Aykroyd’s voice performances (plus, as we’ve learned, several other familiar voices including our friend Greg Miller), is icing on the cake. Can’t wait to hear and see more about the game in the time leading up to its release later this year!\n\nHere’s the announcement trailer, five minutes of pre-alpha gameplay, and the full press release from Illfonic:\n\nGhostbusters: Spirits Unleashed from IllFonic Calls New Recruits to Slime or Be Slimed\n\nLAKEWOOD, Colorado—March 22, 2022—Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the 4v1 hunt or haunt supernaturally-charged video game from the asymmetrical multiplayer experts at IllFonic, rolls out the Ecto-1 in Q4 2022 on PC for Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4 and 5, XboxSeries X|S and Xbox One.\n\nPut on a Proton Pack, grab a Ghost Trap, and monitor the trusty PKE Meter as a Ghostbusterina team of four brave souls pursuing ghastly ghosts terrorizing public locations. Work together to find the Ghost, blast them with streams from the Particle Thrower to tether the slimy foe in place, and shut the trap at the perfect moment! Keep citizens calm and corral the Ghost before the environment gets too haunted.\n\nPlay as a Ghost, scaring unsuspecting citizens at various locations. You ain’t afraid of no Ghostbuster, thanks to the ability to fly and teleport between rifts. Possess objects lying around each room to sneak by roaming Ghostbusters and frighten passersby. If that doesn’t work, sliming and summoning ghoulish minions will. Haunt each map to completion as one of multiple Ghosts with different abilities.\n\nPrepare for each match in the iconic Firehouse by customizing your Ghostbuster or Ghost, upgrading equipment and abilities, and getting some target practice in using the Particle Thrower as well as its different modifications. Talk with Winston Zeddemore, voiced by Ernie Hudson, and get missions before going out into the field. Meet some new and old friends like Dan Aykroyd’s Ray Stantz, ready to hand down some busting wisdom at Ray’s Occult Books.\n\nWho you gonna call when you wanna bust some ghosts? Thanks to cross-platform multiplayer, anyone on PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and/or Xbox Series X|S or One can come together to cross the streams or spew slime. AI companions can help fill games, or enable solo Ghostbusters or a solo Ghost to play offline.\n\n“Ghostbusters is one of the most beloved IPs in the world, so we are pulling out all the stops to make something special and accessible to this diverse fanbase,” said Charles Brungardt, CEO, IllFonic. “If you’re someone who loves the movies or asymmetrical multiplayer games, this was made for you.\n\n”Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed will launch on Epic Games Store for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One. For more information, please visit lllFonic’s official website and follow IllFonic on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. of the details of their new asymmetrical 4v1 multiplayer video game Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed. The game is hitting PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X/S and One\n\nGet Ready for GHOSTBUSTERS DAY on June 8th!\n\nThis is it, this is definitely it!\n\nIn celebration of the anniversary of the original Ghostbusters' release in 1984 as well as to help promote the upcoming film in July, there's a huge day planned around this coming June 8th and it's going to be a doozy.\n\nIn addition to the live Fathom Events screenings where you can see the original film back up on the big screen and get a special sneak peek of the new film, the original cast of Ghostbusters: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts will join the new cast Kate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kristen Wiig on the Jimmy Kimmell Live show together for the first time.\n\nHere's the full press release from the good folks at Sony with all of the day's events mapped out, it's going to be a good one!\n\nGHOSTBUSTERS DAY: JUNE 8, 2016\n\nIn celebration of GHOSTBUSTERS:\n\nThe Original Cast Reunites and Joins the New Cast on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” as\n\nMoviegoers Celebrate the Franchise with Screenings of the Original Film, a Sneak Peek at the New Film, Fun Events, a Contest, and More\n\nElle King’s “Good Girls” Available at Digital Music Providers Today\n\nCULVER CITY, Calif., June 3, 2016 – In anticipation of the release of Ghostbusters, which brings the legendary franchise back to theaters with a new team fighting the paranormal on July 15, Sony Pictures and moviegoers across the country will celebrate the classic franchise with Ghostbusters Day on Wednesday, June 8 – the anniversary of the release date of the original 1984 film.\n\nOn Ghostbusters Day, the cast of the original classic Ghostbusters – including Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Annie Potts – will reunite and join the new Ghostbusters – Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones – as they honor the franchise that evening with an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” “Jimmy Kimmel Live” airs weeknights at 11:35pm Eastern and Pacific / 10:35pm Central on ABC.\n\nFans will also be able to join in the celebration by seeing a sneak peek of the new film as part of the Fathom Events presentation of the original classic in more than 800 cinemas nationwide on June 8, with encore showings on Sunday, June 12.
