        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n22 Mar 2024, 11:22\n\nCredit: Virgin Radio / Sony Pictures\n\nErnie Hudson is back for another Ghostbusters movie, and he has spoken to Chris Evans about getting the old team back together again.\n\nThe actor reprises his role as Dr Winston Zeddemore in new film, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, which is in cinemas today (22nd March). In it, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Annie Potts and William Atherton reprise their characters from the earlier films.\n\nThe new film is a follow-up to 2021’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife, in which Murray, Ackroyd and Ernie also appeared. Joining the Chris Evans Breakfast Show with webuyanycar, Ernie said: “It had been a period of time between the Ghostbusters and the last movie we did. The last movie, we got a call, and we hadn't been together for a long time. And when I got on the set with Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd in the jumpsuits, it was almost emotional, because it had been so long. But this movie that's coming out now, Frozen Empire, I was really impressed with the new cast.”\n\nPaul Rudd, Carrie Coon and Finn Wolfhard reprise their roles from Afterlife, and unlike the previous movie, Frozen Empire is in a setting very familiar to the Ghostbusters story. “New York is… the Ghostbuster epicentre, so we're back!” Ernie explained. “The last movie sort of reacquainted us with Ghostbusters, but this movie is really Ghostbusters in action, and it's a really exciting movie.”\n\nRegarding what happened in Afterlife, and how the story moves on to Frozen Empire, Erine said: “Egon Spengler, who Harold Ramis played, it's his family. The daughter didn't know her father very well. And so they discover the Ghostbusters and what he did in that last movie. Now, my loyalty to him and the other Ghostbusters who gave me a job when I most needed it, I found this family and I brought them to New York, because I expect they will take over the franchise and move things into the future, which they're quite capable until this new threat, and it's going to take everybody.”\n\nIn the narrative, the discovery of an ancient artefact unleashes an army of ghosts that casts a chill so severe that Ghostbusters new and old must join forces to save the world from a second Ice Age. “It's a Ghostbuster movie, and I think it does deliver,” Ernie told Chris. “But, also, this is 40 years later. We're not playing to the same audience that we played to. The world has changed in so many ways. So you have to embrace the change.”\n\nWith Ghostbusters II coming out in 1989, it was quite the gap until the series was rebooted with Afterlife in 2021. “I had kind of given up,” Ernie admitted. “I knew the fans wanted it. I know the fans have been really supportive. But I kind of thought, ‘well, maybe it won't happen and that's okay.’ But the fans did not waver, they stayed committed.”\n\nHe continued: “Sometimes… it’s something the studio wants, because they want to make money, and so they get a title and they'll throw it out there. But this is something the fans have demanded. And you want to be a part of that and you want to make a movie that you don't disappoint them. It's very important to me. And I think everybody in the movie, we really want it to be something that the fans would embrace. And I think it does that.”\n\nRead about how Ernie secured the role of Dr Winston Zeddemore in the first place here.\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire is in cinemas now."
