Hudson is strongly identified with his starring role as Warden Leo Glynn on the critically acclaimed HBO series “Oz.” For his portrayal of the fair-minded warden, Hudson won the International Press Academy Golden Satellite Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Drama Series. Hudson just wrapped the highly prestigious original TNT film “The Ron Clark Story” starring opposite Matthew Perry. During this same year, Hudson starred in a wide variety of films including the award-winning HBO film “Lackawanna Blues,” “Miss Hotchiss’ Charm School,” and “Miss Congeniality 2” reprising his role as FBI Asst. Director Harry McDonald. Hudson also starred in the ABC series “10-8” as Senior Deputy John Henry Barnes. Hudson is especially proud of his portrayal of simple-minded handyman Solomon in the box-office smash \"The Hand that Rocks the Cradle.” On the opposite side of the spectrum, Hudson remains a beloved icon as Winston Zeddemore, one of the original Ghostbusters. Born in Benton Harbor, Michigan, a career as a performer seemed like an unlikely path for young Ernie Hudson, who was already married with a young son when he enrolled at Wayne State University as a Speech and English major. Hudson's early ambition was to be a writer, and for a time served as the resident playwright at Detroit's Concept East, the oldest black theater company in the country. Later, he founded Actors Ensemble Theater, where he and other black performers staged and appeared in their own original works. After attending Wayne State, Hudson accepted a full writing/acting scholarship to the prestigious Master of Fine Arts Program at Yale University. This led to a number of regional theater roles and critical acclaim, and his feature film debut in \"Leadbelly.\"\n\nHudson earned roles in feature films like \"The Main Event\" with Barbra Streisand, \"The Jazz Singer\" with Neil Diamond, and television projects like Abby Mann's acclaimed mini-series \"King\" and the highly-rated \"Roots II.\" In 1983, Hudson was anointed as original Ghostbuster Winston Zeddemore and his star was born. Hudson subsequently starred in films such as \"Weeds\" with Nick Nolte, \"Leviathan,\" \"Sugar Hill,\" \"The Cowboy Way,\" \"Speechless,\" \"The Basketball Diaries\" opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, \"Congo,\" and \"The Crow\" opposite the late Brandon Lee.\n\nWhen he's not working, Hudson likes to spend time relaxing at home with his wife and family and remains committed to developing all facets of his creativity, including his writing."
