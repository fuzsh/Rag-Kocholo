        "text": "This week on the show, Troy and Chris dive into Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (and popcorn buckets… again). It’s a spoiler-filled discussion, so make sure to save this one until you’re absolutely ready. Some of the stand out moments, a couple nitpicks, and what the film sets up for the future are all in the cards. Stay tuned for some of your voicemail reactions too!\n\nThis week on the good old Crossrip podcast, we’re remembering the long time collaborator of Ivan Reitman, Dan Goldberg who passed away last week. Troy and Chris talk about his impact on the films we know and love and his connections to Ghostbusters. Then, we’re talking about the WGA and SAG strikes and how they may play into Ernie Hudson’s comments about the Ghostbusters: Afterlife sequel codenamed Firehouse possibly being delayed. Then, in the closing moments of the show, the great Secret Studio North sale has begun. How can you get your hands on some of Chris’ goods (wait, that didn’t sound right) and just how much did his can of Heinz Real Ghostbusters spaghetti sell for? Tune in to find out!\n\nThis week on the show, we’re catching up on all that we weren’t able to chat about the last couple weeks with the 300th episode celebration! On the Afterlife front, Jason Reitman confirms November in theaters date, Ernie Hudson has seen the movie, Annie Potts calls the experience of making the movie “trippy,” and the onslaught of Mini-Puft merch has begun including blind bags, Christmas ornaments, and walkie talkies! The Buffalo Ghostbusters are raising funds for Hook and Ladder No. 8 to get them a new not-so-subtle sign. Randy Edelman’s fantastic Ghostbusters II score is coming in June (now confirmed) and we have the track listings for the vinyl release. All that and a whole lot more on the show!\n\nJoin the gents for a new segment of the show \"Unsolicited Dic Peeks\": a commentary and in-depth dive on Real Ghostbusters episodes and get the latest in Ghostbusters news in this week's Interdimensional Crossrip! First up in the news, Ghostbusters Afterlife's release has moved to November, we remember Larry King, and some comments on Ernie Hudson's \"no comments.\" Then in the second half of the show, join us for a full commentary on a classic Real Ghostbusters episode, \"Knock, Knock.\" How is it a quintessential Ghostbusters story? How does it act as a pilot for the animated show (yet aired in the second season)? All that and more explored in our discussion. Cue up the episode on your home entertainment platform of choice and follow along with us!\n\nThis week on the show, we're talking all about merch! From LEGO's new super-detailed Ecto-1 kit now available for purchase with an accessory that hints at things to come in Ghostbusters Afterlife to Hasbro re-offering the Ectotron Transformer ALSO with an Afterlife spin, there's much to talk about! There's also a paper insert within the new Reebok Ghoststomper sneakers that may give a few hints toward Afterlife, if only we could all decode the message. All that plus Ernie Hudson's Vinz Clortho theory, Dan Aykroyd's Bottle Service video, Ray Parker Jr. on the Professor of Rock and why Ghostbusters II was trending on Twitter last week!\n\nWith our thanks to Hasbro, on this week's Crossrip Troy and Chris are chatting about the Plasma Series Neutrona Wand, and while they do, they're also talking about the latest Ghostbusters news! Including Carrie Coon and Ernie Hudson's comments on Ghostbusters Afterlife, confectionary items hitting in the UK, and a secret Starbucks Frappacino menu item that you've gotta try!\n\nThis is also one of our first ventures into simulcasting an episode here and there on YouTube! Check out our YouTube channel or watch the contents of the show embedded below!\n\nThis week on the show, we sit down with artist Joseph Game aka CHOGRIN - plus we talk Sony’s Drive-In Experience and Jason Reitman’s introduction, Richard Edlund’s engineering achievement award, and Bill Murray’s latest with Sofia Coppola. First up in the news, Jason Reitman introduced the original Ghostbusters at a special drive-in experience on the Sony Pictures lot and talked about how excited he is for Ghostbusters Afterlife to premiere on the big screen. Boss Films founder and Visual Effects legend Richard Edlund is receiving an honorary membership to the SMPTE organization that honors achievements in film technology. Oh and Bill Murray has a new movie with Sofia Coppola coming to Apple TV+ called “On the Rocks” and the boys talk about the trailer. Then in the second half of the show, the amazing artist CHOGRIN talks his first 3G show: Gremlins, Goonies and Ghostbusters, Crazy4Cult and Gallery 1988 shows, and a wild ride he spent in an Ecto with Ernie Hudson, his life and encounters with the paranormal in Ecuador, and his exclusive plans for a new show in 2021!\n\nThe winners of the Crossrip 5th Anniversary mystery boxes and a dip into the Proton Charging archives for a radio interview that aired in 1999 are in store for you this week! First up, Chris has the three winners of our mystery box giveaways in honor of our five years “on the air.” Did you win? Tune in to find out! Then, from the Proton Charging archives, Chris is dusting off a cassette tape of a radio interview that aired in Los Angeles way back in 1999. Around the time of the original film’s first DVD release, radio host Wayne Resnick was joined by Ernie Hudson, William Atherton and Slovitzia Jovan - and a man who had no idea he’d be spending (literally) hours and hours on the air for his own show, Mr. Chris Stewart even makes an appearance. Hop in the time machine and come with us!\n\n“Reunited Apart” brought the original Ghostbusters cast and director together and it sure lived up to the expectations. On this week’s show, Troy and Chris discuss their favorite moments, some of the behind the scenes reveals that they weren’t aware of (including a little expansion on Bill Murray’s comments of seeing part of the film during Thanksgiving dinner at Ivan Reitman’s house). All that, plus some of your thoughts via social media on the event!\n\nThis week on the show: Bill, Dan, Ernie, Annie and Sigourney are back and it’s official! Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair had the exclusive scoop last week that the “OGBs” are returning for Jason Reitman’s Ghostbusters Afterlife, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and Sigourney Weaver are all in! And the article included a great story about how Bill made the journalist wear a proton pack for an extended period of time. You better believe Troy and Chris are going to pour over every detail of the article: what can be gleaned about the tone on set? Why do we think it was not accompanied by a photo? And what do the boys think this means for the strategy of the film moving forward? All that plus the winner of our inflatable Ecto contest, a Ghostbusters-themed lightsaber, and another ridiculous bootleg available online! Join us!\n\nThis week on the show: the latest in Ghostbusters Afterlife news and Ghostbusters Year One Issue 1 discussion! First up, remembering Gunnar Ferdinandsen, the legendary special effects artist whom you might not recognize by name but certainly will by his work. Then some film updates including a quick update on the Vanity Fair confirmation that Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and Sigourney Weaver will all be in the film and a fun on-set story (more on that next week). Then in the second half of the show, Troy and Chris discuss their thoughts on IDW’s latest entry in the comics lexicon: Year One and a backstory with Winston Zeddemore we’ve never seen before!\n\nNor rain, sleet, snow, colds, ear infections, termites, long work hours, can stop the - - well, they did. We missed last week’s episode and what resulted this week is a mishmash of what should have aired last week and something new. Chris was kind enough to put together a little something on his own to give you the latest news including NYCC’s reveals, thoughts on Ghostbusters The Video Game Remastered and more. Then, in the second half of the show, Chris has some Halloween viewing suggestions starring a few familiar faces.\n\nThis week on the show, Ghostbusters II archival unearthed, Ghostbusters (2020) casting, technical talk and a Japanese cover of Hot Night, are you not entertained? First up, a recently revealed/unearthed UK entertainment program called Film Eighty Nine had a great Ghostbusters II segment which gets Troy and Chris talking about the past before they talk about the future. Then, in our Ghostbusters (2020) chat: Celeste O’Connor and Logan Kim have been cast as the last two of the group of four kids to star in the next film. What are their roles? We’re not speculating anymore, remember? But what we can talk about? The film is being shot on the Arri Alexa LF cameras. What does that mean? And just how many keys to the city does Ernie Hudson have (and why isn’t the answer all of them)? Then in the second half of the show, your voicemails and a special treat from our friend Naoki in Japan, a cover of “Hot Night” that came out in 1984!\n\nThis week on the show, wrapping up Fan Fest (sorta) with Troy and Chris’ thoughts on the event and their experiences as well as your voicemails about the weekend. First up, Troy and Chris do their best to recap the day(s) with some of the highs and lows, and some of the hopeful lessons learned by the Wizard World folks if they ever attempt another similar event. Then, in the second half of the show, listeners called in large numbers to talk about the convention and we have the first part of your voicemails. Next week, we’ll play those we weren’t able to get to, not to worry!\n\nThis week on the show, talking about a few Aykroyd Adjacent films, the recently hired Ghostbusters (2020) film crew, and more! First up, Troy just saw a movie that had somehow slipped past his radar in the 80’s and stars one of our favorite Ghostbusters actors. Next up, the latest rumor round-up on Ghostbusters (2020) including on-going casting chat. Then, an in-depth discussion on the film crew we do know has boarded the project including the new Director of Photography, Art Director, and Visual Effects Supervisor. Finally, some merch news including Funko cereal pre-orders - wait… pre-ordering cereal? We really are in the future.\n\nHide your wallets, it’s International Toy Fair time! This week on the show, the latest Ghostbusters (2020) news, and the late-breaking announcements we were able to talk about from Toy Fair in time for recording! First up, some discussion about an unconfirmed “exclusive” scoop about Ghostbusters (2020)’s production start date. Is there merit to it? Is there room for doubt? In fact, are we taking too many things at face value at the moment? The boys have an in-depth conversation (that’s awfully similar to one had three years ago at this point in the production timeline). The Ghostbusters social media account caused quite a stir, Troy and Chris will tell you why. And then some talk about the show-stopping reveal that’s more than meets the eye - an Ecto-1/Transformer has become reality.\n\nThis week on the show, continued discussion on the newly announced live-action Ghostbusters film and a chat about IDW’s latest comic release with the Sanctum of Slime characters! First up, the rumor mill has already started running full steam, Troy and Chris discuss (or don’t discuss) those which have merit and clarify the “confirmed” casting news that was quickly “unconfirmed.” Ghostbusters World has a tie-in with 7-Eleven in the Great White North, could it be a test for something larger on the horizon? And, in the second half of the show, more of your voicemails and a discussion on the one-shot comic released in celebration of IDW’s 20th anniversary.\n\nThis week on the show, remembering a fallen fellow fan, what’s the status of Ecto Force and a drool-worthy mancave. First up, now that a few logo explorations for Ecto Force have appeared online, what does that mean for the current status of Ecto Force? Then, Ernie Hudson talks about Stan Lee’s influence on his life, Ecto-Con 2020 is hitting Scotland, and while you’re there you should hit up a GB Fans user’s mancave for a round of Ghostbusters The Video Game. All that plus, your voicemails, Instagram messages and Michael Tanaka calls in to talk Crossing Over’s conclusion (*note: Michael Tanaka has not called in).\n\nThis week on the show, some wild speculation about Kevin Smith's secret project and Ghostbusters Crossing Over #6 discussion! First up, if you've listened to Kevin Smith's Fatman on Batman podcast recently, you may have caught onto some hints that Troy has read WAY too much into, then some news about Spirit Halloween stock, Ghostbusters social media really picking it up, an Ecto Cooler documentary in the works, Gravitas picks up a Bill Murray documentary, Paul Feig talks about his experience on the 2016 film and where sequels would have gone, Ghostbusters Live news, and an IGT giveaway. Then, in the second half of the show, analysis and thoughts on IDW's most recent installment of Ghostbusters Crossing Over!\n\nThis week on the show, discussing the Halifax commercial that bends space and time to insert a pitchman into the 1984 film and presenting the entirety of the Wizard World Chicago panel! First up in the news: Ghostbusters Dimension is leaving Madam Tussauds in New York City, Chris and Troy talk about the Halifax commercial which alters the 1984 film to sell contact-less credit cards, merch news including new offerings in card gaming and backpacking, and an update on Rick Moranis' first convention appearance in San Antonio. Then, in the second half of the show, our friends the Circle City Ghostbusters have been kind enough to share audio from Ivan Reitman and Ernie Hudson's panel at Wizard World Chicago. In the panel, they discuss the past, present and future of Ghostbusters and answer several questions from those in the audience."
