        "text": "Who you gonna call?! \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife\" arrives in theaters on Nov. 19, 2021. In honor of the supernatural comedy's big debut, Wonderwall.com is taking a look back at the stars of the original \"Ghostbusters\" — which opened in theaters in 1984 and spawned a 1989 sequel, a 2016 all-female reboot, two animated series, countless video games and more — to see how they've changed over the years.\n\nKeep reading to catch up with Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and the rest of the team…\n\nRELATED: The best movies about ghosts\n\nBill Murray brought Peter Venkman to life in \"Ghostbusters.\" The parapsychologist and cynical New Yorker is often regarded as one of the iconic comedian's greatest roles. Venkman even earned a spot on Empire Magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.\n\nRELATED: Bill's top 20 movies ranked\n\nBill Murray was already a legend in the comedy world by the time \"Ghostbusters\" debuted. He stuck around for the 1989 sequel, \"Ghostbusters II,\" and continued his streak of hit flicks with films like \"What About Bob?\" in 1991 and \"Groundhog Day\" in 1993. His success in film transitioned into the 21st century with hits like \"Lost in Translation\" in 2003, which earned him a Golden Globe for best actor and an Oscar nomination. Films like 2012's \"Moonrise Kingdom\" and 2014's \"Grand Budapest Hotel\" solidified his status as both a mainstream and indie darling. He also gave audiences a treat when he popped up in the \"Ghostbusters\" reboot in 2016. He's been married twice — first to Margaret Kelley from 1981 to 1996. He got together with costumer designer Jennifer Butler while he was still married and they soon tied the knot but divorced in 2008. Bill has two children with Margaret (sons Homer and Luke) and four children with Jennifer (sons Caleb, Jackson, Cooper and Lincoln). Bill returns to the role of Peter Venkman in \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\"\n\nRELATED: Bill's life and career in pictures\n\nSigourney Weaver starred as cellist Dana Barrett, who happens to come across a TV advertisement for the Ghostbusters just as she's dealing with paranormal activity in her apartment building.\n\nSigourney Weaver was already a household name when she starred in \"Ghostbusters\" thanks to her work in \"Alien.\" After \"Ghostbusters,\" she starred in two of her most memorable movies to date: 1988's \"Gorillas in the Mist\" and \"Working Girl.\" (She won Golden Globe Awards and scored Oscar nominations for both.) She went on to star in several more installments in the \"Alien\" franchise and also appeared in another major sci-fi film: \"Avatar.\" (She's set to appear in the long-awaited sequels.) Sigourney has been married to stage director Jim Simpson since 1984. They share daughter Charlotte, who was born in 1990. She returns to the role of Dana Barrett in \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\"\n\nDan Aykroyd starred as Ray Stantz — an expert in paranormal history and metallurgy who's considered \"the heart\" of the team — in \"Ghostbusters.\" He also co-wrote the script with co-star Harold Ramis!\n\nDan Aykroyd went on to star in a wide range of films — from \"Coneheads,\" which he wrote, and \"Tommy Boy\" to \"My Girl\" and \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" for which he earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. In recent years, he's starred in dramas like \"Behind The Candelabra\" and \"Get on Up,\" though he also had a cameo in the 2016 \"Ghostbusters\" reboot. He's been married to actress Donna Dixon since 1983. They share three daughters: Danielle, Stella and Belle. He returns to the role of Ray Stantz in \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\"\n\nHarold Ramis, who co-wrote \"Ghostbusters\" with Dan Aykroyd, starred as Egon Spengler, the brains of the operation who takes a liking to the group's secretary, Janine.\n\nAfter \"Ghostbusters,\" Harold Ramis wrote and directed \"Groundhog Day,\" \"Analyze This,\" \"Bedazzled\" and \"Year One.\" (He made his final on-screen appearance in the 2009 comedy, in which Michael Cera and Jack Black starred.) He also acted in films like \"As Good As It Gets,\" \"The Last Kiss\" and \"Knocked Up.\" In 2014, Harold passed away of complications from autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis. He was 69. He'd been married twice over the years — first to artist Anne Plotkin (with whom he shared daughter Violet) and then to Erica Mann (with whom he shared sons Julian and Daniel). He also fathered a child — daughter Mollie, who was born in 1985 while he was still married to Anne — with \"Clueless\" director Amy Heckerling, who was also married to someone else at the time.\n\nErnie Hudson's Winston Zeddemore becomes the fourth member of the Ghostbusters after he sees a help-wanted ad posted by the team. Unlike the rest of the group, however, he's not particularly versed in the paranormal. Instead, he sees the gig as a steady paycheck.\n\nAfter \"Ghostbusters,\" Ernie Hudson starred in \"The Hand that Rocks the Cradle,\" \"The Crow,\" \"The Basketball Diaries,\" \"Congo,\" \"Miss Congeniality\" and more hit films. He also had memorable stints on \"Desperate Housewives,\" \"Law & Order,\" \"The Secret Life of the American Teenager\" and \"Modern Family.\" Most notably, though, he starred on \"Oz\" from 1997 to 2003. In recent years, Ernie has appeared on \"Grace and Frankie,\" \"L.A.'s Finest\" and \"The Family Business.\" He also made a cameo in the 2016 \"Ghostbusters\" reboot, is set to star on the upcoming third season of \"City on a Hill\" and returns to the role of Winston Zeddemore in \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\" Ernie's been married twice — first to Jeannie Moore (with whom he shares sons Ernie Hudson Jr. and Rahaman Hudson) and then to Linda Kingsberg, whom he wed in 1985. They share sons Andrew and Ross.\n\nRick Moranis portrayed Dana's neighbor Louis Tully, a nerdy accountant who's ultimately possessed by a demon.\n\nRick Moranis went on to star in \"Little Shop of Horrors,\" \"Spaceballs,\" \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,\" \"Parenthood,\" \"The Flintstones\" and \"Little Giants.\" Tragically, his wife, costume designer Ann Belsky, whom he married in 1986, passed away in 1991, leaving behind their two children, Rachel and Mitchell. Rick put his career on hold to focus on raising his kids. He's really only appeared on camera once since 1997's \"Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves!\" — on a 2018 episode of \"The Goldbergs.\"\n\nAnnie Potts portrayed Janine, the Ghostbusters' trusty secretary who keeps tabs on their clients and catches the eye of Egon Spengler.\n\nAnnie Potts went on to star on \"Designing Women,\" \"Love & War,\" for which she earned an Emmy nomination, \"Any Day Now,\" \"Joan of Arcadia,\" \"GCB\" and more hit TV shows. She also starred in \"Pretty in Pink,\" voiced Bo Peep in the \"Toy Story\" franchise, made a cameo in the 2016 \"Ghostbusters\" reboot and had stints on \"Chicago Med\" and \"The Fosters.\" Since 2017, she's starred as Meemaw on \"Young Sheldon.\" Annie has been married to her fourth husband, James Hayman, since 1990. They share sons James and Harry. She has an older son, Clay, from her third marriage. She returns to the role of Janine in \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\""
