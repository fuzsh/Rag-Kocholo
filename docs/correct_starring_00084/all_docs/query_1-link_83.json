        "text": "Wearing a backpack and jumpsuit, Ernie Hudson blasted his way into pop-culture consciousness as one of the original Ghostbusters in the 1984 hit comedy.\n\nWorking alongside a team of three nerd geniuses battling metaphysical marauders, he was the street-smart everyman.\n\nNow Hudson, 70, is revisiting the film’s fan base in the all-female “Ghostbusters” reboot, which reunites him with other key cast members for surprise cameos.\n\n“I’ve always been very proud to be part of the franchise,” he says in an interview, even though much of the attention often has focused on his better-known co-stars. Still, Hudson attracted a contingent of Midwestern fans that none of the others could equal.\n\nLong before zapping supernatural spooks with his proton gun, Hudson had a high-profile connection with Minneapolis-St. Paul theatergoers, one so strong that Minnesota has been his home base for the past 40 years.\n\nHudson grew up in a housing project in Benton Harbor, Michigan. He did acting in high school and wrote plays for his church. After establishing an actors ensemble in college to support black playwrights and performers, he won a full scholarship to the prestigious master of fine arts program at Yale University while Meryl Streep was there.\n\nWhen his first marriage ended in his late 20s and his two young sons came to live with him, Hudson enrolled in a University of Minnesota postgraduate program. He dropped out after a few semesters to star in a Minneapolis production of “The Great White Hope,” the play by Howard Sackler.\n\nHudson considers his months of extended performances playing Jack Johnson, America’s first black heavyweight boxing champion, to be the foundation of his career — “a good role in an amazing piece of work,” he says.\n\nHaving acted for a decade with little to show for it, Hudson poured everything he had into the role, including endless workouts in a boxing gym. He won standing ovations and critical raves. “It was really successful, probably the best thing I’ve ever done,” he says.\n\nHe filled seats in the audience, but he was working, largely unpaid, in community theater. As a young single father, he was so financially strapped that he couldn’t afford Christmas gifts for his boys and faced eviction by his landlord.\n\nHe walked out of his hit play at one point, triggering canceled performances and a heated public discussion. The mayor got involved. In a civic meeting at the time, Hudson said, “With all the theater in Minneapolis, there’s no place for a black actor to make a living.”\n\nThe discussion sparked the creation and funding of Penumbra Theatre, a forum for voices of color in the Twin Cities theater community.\n\nClaude Purdy, a young black actor, director and filmmaker brought in from Los Angeles to direct “The Great White Hope,” stayed on to become Penumbra’s resident director. In turn, he encouraged promising new writer August Wilson to move to the area, as well, supporting Wison as he grew to national stature.\n\nHudson, who divides his time between homes in suburban Minneapolis and Los Angeles, wasn’t embittered by the experience. “I still consider Minneapolis my home,” says the busy performer, even though I can’t spend much time there.”\n\nHe met his second wife, Linda Kingsberg, in 1976 after a theater performance, made his film debut in “Leadbelly” shortly afterward, then moved ahead to numerous TV appearances.\n\nToday, Hudson has more than 200 film and TV credits on his résumé, including roles in “Oz,” “Law & Order” and “Desperate Housewives.” Currently, he’s a recurring cast member on ABC’s “Modern Family,” plays Lily Tomlin’s boyfriend in the Netflix series “Grace & Frankie” and will appear in Showtime’s revival of “Twin Peaks.”\n\nHe’s also filming the upcoming Epix network original series “Graves,” a political satire in which Nick Nolte plays a disgraced former president trying to right his administration’s wrongs.\n\n“I’m working and shooting projects in places all over the country,” Hudson says, “every place except Minneapolis.”\n\nOne of his highest-profile Twin Cities gigs came in 2003, when Hudson appeared in Wilson’s “King Hedley II” at Penumbra. “For a guy out of Michigan who didn’t know anybody, I do feel very, very blessed,” he says.\n\nHudson considers “Ghostbusters” and “Ghostbusters II” (1989) to have been great opportunities but says they didn’t pay off as he had expected. His role in the first was cut considerably from the version in the original script, and he wasn’t pictured on the first film’s poster alongside Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. He attained more visibility in the sequel, but that movie marked the end of what might have been a longer series.\n\n“Things have not happened the way I thought they’d happen after ‘Ghostbusters,’ ” he says. “I’m glad I didn’t lose faith but stayed in and managed to keep getting work. I’ve been very fortunate.”\n\nWhile he called last month’s reboot of the comedy “a bad idea” when it was first announced, he was so impressed by the script offered by director/co-writer Paul Feig that he joined the cast last September — “to support the film,” as he puts it. He says, “When they asked me to come and join them, it was great. I’d have been very disappointed, had I not been (asked).”\n\nHudson says he’s proud of the way audiences have embraced the franchise, pointing out there are chapters of Ghostbusters fan clubs around the globe. Hudson sometimes appears at their conventions.\n\n“I so admire them,” he says. “There’s so much negative stuff going on in our society. If I see anything at some of the conventions, it’s fans who are latching onto a movie and find a way to come together as a community. A lot of the Ghostbusters chapters do charity work. So I’m excited about that, and I’m excited about how they’ve been able to take this and turn it into something positive.\n\n“We need as much of that as we can get, because there are so many things that are so divisive now — so much stuff that just tears us apart. But there are Asian Ghostbuster chapters and black and white, and they’re all having fun together.”"
