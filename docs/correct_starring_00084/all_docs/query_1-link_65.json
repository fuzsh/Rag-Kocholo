        "text": "The One Show viewers were in shock after discovering the real age of an A-list actor who has turned back time.\n\nHollywood legend Ernie Hudson appeared on tonight’s BBC show to discuss his role in the new Ghostbusters film, alongside his co-stars Stranger Things’ Finn Wolfhard and Mckenna Grace.\n\nHowever, fans became distracted during the interview with presenters Roman Kemp and Jermaine Jenas after learning that Ernie, who looks like he has barely aged, is nearly 80, having turned 78 in December.\n\nTheir disbelief was further compounded when they realised Ernie appeared in the original Ghostbusters film, playing the part of Winston Zeddemore, which was released 40 years ago.\n\nAbsolutely floored, Dli O’Doir demanded on X: ‘Watching #theoneshow on BBC1 and wondering how on earth is@ernie_hudson 78 years old? Whats your secret Ernie?’\n\nAgreeing, Craig Hughes fawned: ‘Ernie Hudson is a legend, looks amazing for his age.’\n\nRuss added: ‘Ernie Hudson doesn’t look a day older than the day the original #ghostbusters was released 78!!! Jesus!!’\n\nAs well as the first Ghostbusters, Ernie starred in the follow-ups Ghostbusters II and Ghostbusters: Afterlife, as well as the 2016 female remake of the original, playing the cameo role of Patty Tolan’s uncle.\n\nSpeaking about Ghostbusters’ enduring legacy on The One Show, Ernie said: ‘Fans for 40 years they’ve kept it alive even when there was no Ghostbusters. People got tattoos. They just showed up and kept it going.’\n\nHowever, Ernie previously recalled his experience making the original Ghostbusters as ‘very, very difficult’ and claimed that the studio ‘selectively pushed him aside’.\n\n‘I was the guy who was brought in, and so finding my place in the middle of that — and they were all welcoming and inclusive. The studio wasn’t, and the studio continued not to be.’\n\n‘So it made it very, very difficult because I was a part of it but then very selectively I was pushed aside,’ he claimed while speaking on SiriusXM’s The Howard Stern Wrap Up Show in 2022.\n\nThe Miss Congeniality and Grace & Frankie actor also pointed out that he was ‘not on the poster’ for the film.\n\nBut he acknowledged that he was ‘so thankful’ for Ghostbusters fans for ‘seeing it differently’ as he recalled that ‘the fans basically identified with Winston, especially young – I don’t want to say minority kids – but a lot of kids’.\n\nLooking back on their first outing together, however, Hudson was full of praise for late director Ivan Reitman and his castmates, who were all already established stars.\n\nIn the latest Ghostbusters, Ernie also stars alongside the likes of Off Menu host and comedian James Acaster and Paul Rudd.\n\nAccording to the synopsis: ‘In Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, the Spengler family returns to where it all started – the iconic New York City firehouse – to team up with the original Ghostbusters, who’ve developed a top-secret research lab to take busting ghosts to the next level.\n\n‘But when the discovery of an ancient artifact unleashes an army of ghosts that casts a death chill upon the city, Ghostbusters new and old must join forces to protect their home and save the world from a second Ice Age.’\n\nSince starting his showbusiness career in the 70s, Ernis has starred in a huge number of TV shows and films, from The Basketball Diaries to Desperate Housewives.\n\nMetro.co.uk has previously contacted Sony Pictures Entertainment for comment, on behalf of original studio Columbia-Delphi Productions.\n\nThe One Show airs weekdays from 7pm on BBC One and iPlayer.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : The One Show thrown into chaos as Dame Prue Leith drops explicit comment\n\nMORE : The Graham Norton Show star demanded a second dressing room… for their phone"
