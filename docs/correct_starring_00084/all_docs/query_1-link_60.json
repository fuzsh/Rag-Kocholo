        "text": "GHOSTBUSTERS got a huge surprise this week as Ernie Hudson made a public appearance.\n\nLooking impossibly young, Ernie, now 78 years old, was spotted out in London on Thursday.\n\nHe was only 38 when he starred in the first Ghostbusters movie.\n\nHe appeared alongside Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis in what would become a major franchise and an inter-generational hit.\n\nBefore his Ghost-Busting career was over, Ernie appeared in Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters II (1989), Ghostbusters (2016), Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021), and the Ghostbusters video game (2009).\n\nHe also appears in the 2024 Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire where he's been supporting the franchise and his younger counterparts.\n\nOn Thursday, the actor attended the UK Gala Screening of the new movie at The Ham Yard Hotel in London, England.\n\nPhotos were snapped of the star walking into the event, and he looked like the spitting image of the 38-year-old in the first film.\n\nThis man hasn't aged a day except for the salt-and-pepper hairstyle he's been rocking.\n\nHe also proved that his style has remained on point as he wore a pair of tight jeans and a chic black turtleneck.\n\nErnie completed his outfit with a well-worn brown leather jacket with dark brown lapels and matching leather shoes.\n\nWHERE HAS THE TIME GONE\n\nFans on Reddit have seen recent photos of Ernie, and they've all been shaken to the core by his ageless appearance.\n\nOne said: \"You would never think he's 78 years old.\"\n\n\"Ernie is looking great, he has a great sense of style,\" added another.\n\nA third wrote: \"Shocked me to find out heâ€™s older than Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd.\"\n\nOthers said: \"He looks fantastic!\" and \"Legend.\"\n\nFROZEN IN TIME\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire comes out on March 22, 2024.\n\nIt was written by Gil Kenan and Jason Reitman, and Gil directed the movie.\n\nThe comedy is the sequel movie to Ghostbusters: Afterlife, and it marks the fifth film in the franchise.\n\nFans will see many familiar faces starring in the flick such as Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things, and Mckenna Grace.\n\nBill, Dan, and Ernie also reprise their roles from Afterlife.\n\nIn the film, the original and new Ghostbusters head back to the iconic New York City firehouse to battle some ghosts.\n\nAccording to Sony Pictures, they're fighting an evil force that was unleashed from an ancient artifact.\n\nIf they win, they'll protect their home while saving the world from a second Ice Age."
