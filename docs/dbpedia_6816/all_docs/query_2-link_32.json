By 1982, he was making a six-figure salary as head of institutional equity sales for an Ontario brokerage, which transferred him to Calgary.\n\nEventually, he decided to strike out on his own, forming Bresea Resources. In 1989, Bre-X hit the capital markets and began trading on the Alberta Stock Exchange at 30 cents per share.\n\nThe junior exploration company scoured for gold in Quebec and took part in a diamond rush in the Northwest Territories, but the effort amounted to little. Now in his late 40s, Walsh was bankrupt and saddled with $60,000 in credit card debt.\n\nBut he was no quitter.\n\nLooking for anything that could help his companies’ fortunes, Walsh contacted in 1993 an acquaintance he’d met 10 years earlier in Australia.\n\nThat man was John Felderhof.\n\nFelderhof was a boy when his family moved to Canada from the Netherlands in the early 1950s. Athletic, bright and fearless, he gravitated toward geology in university. His taste for adventure eventually drew him to Africa, Australia and Asia.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn his late 20s, Felderhof struck pay dirt when he co-discovered the massive Ok Tedi copper-gold deposit in Papua New Guinea. For a geologist so young, it was a coup. Stock options in a junior mining company also made him a paper millionaire during the 1980s. His future looked bright.\n\nBut in 1987, stock markets crashed and his paper fortune dwindled. Good work dried up. What he still possessed, however, was his reputation, his intuition and zero fear of the jungle.\n\nAll he needed was a break — and along came Walsh.\n\n“I want to put some romance into both companies (Bre-X and Bresea) ASAP,” Walsh wrote Felderhof in 1993. “We have a great speculative stock market going in Canada now.”\n\nFelderhof, who’d spent years working in Indonesia’s jungles, had some prospects, including a property on the island of Borneo.\n\nThe site, now infamous in Bre-X lore, became known as Busang.\n\nGiven its geology and location relative to two other gold deposits on the resource-rich island, Felderhof believed in its potential. Soon, Walsh did as well.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nThe real-life story that inspired the movie\n\nHow director Stephen Gaghan turned a scandal into a fable\n\nAs the Calgarian set about raising capital at home, Felderhof assembled a team that included a number of Filipino geologists. They were led by exploration manager Michael de Guzman.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDe Guzman was born in Manila on Valentine’s Day, 1956. His father was a geologist and he followed in his footsteps. By 1977, a large mining company hired him out of school and, within a decade, promoted him to head up its geology department.\n\nDe Guzman was viewed as a good employee and generous manager. A devout Catholic, his life revolved around work and family.\n\n(It only emerged many years later that de Guzman was juggling four wives and families when he died, none of which knew about the others.)\n\nIn the late 1980s, when rising gold prices lured many Filipino geologists to Indonesia, de Guzman also headed for the swampy forests of what was dubbed the Pacific Rim of Fire.\n\nIn 1992, de Guzman and his longtime colleague, Felderhof, were prospecting for an Australian firm in the remote area of Busang. After de Guzman reported back that he’d found a few flecks of gold during a brief investigation of the area, it was felt the area showed promise.\n\nWhen Walsh contacted Felderhof looking for something to lift Bre-X’s fortunes, this was the place they decided to stake their hopes.\n\nYet, in the early days of the venture, nothing was assured. And when costly exploration efforts turned up little to get excited about, there were fears the Canadians might pull out.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDe Guzman, who was leading Bre-X’s efforts at the site as the company’s exploration manager, begged Felderhof for more time. Before long, Busang’s results began improving.\n\n“We almost closed the property,” de Guzman told Fortune Magazine in 1997, not long before everything collapsed in scandal.\n\n“In December 1993, John said ‘Close the property,’ and then we made the hit.”\n\nFrom that point, it’s believed drilled core samples pulled from the ground were salted with shavings from jewelry and panned gold.\n\nThe world, however, was none the wiser.\n\nEventually, Busang was billed as the biggest gold deposit on Earth. Bre-X’s value on the Toronto Stock Exchange ballooned to $6 billion. Walsh, Felderhof and de Guzman were on top of the world.\n\nIndeed, they were the rock stars of the mining world. Their Calgary headquarters attracted the world’s financial press. Everyone wanted a piece of their success — and some were willing to sink their life savings into it to do so.\n\nFormer business journalist Stephen Ewart, who covered the rise and fall of Bre-X for the Calgary Herald, recalls the near-euphoria on the streets of Calgary as the tiny local company shot to stardom and investors clamoured to get a piece of the action.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“This was before social media, and yet it was the topic of all conversations. You wouldn’t believe how much it captivated the attention of the city and the country and even the world, at that point,” he says. “There just looked to be so much money to be made.”\n\nBut the good times were short-lived.\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1996, the company was staggered by a series of stock-jolting pitfalls.\n\nIt ranged from questions over its ownership of Busang to a forced partnership with the Indonesian government’s hand-picked suitor, U.S. mining giant Freeport-McMoRan, and a confidante of then-president Suharto.\n\nBut the worst was yet to come.\n\nFreeport’s independent drilling tests in early 1997 failed to match Bre-X’s grand results. The finding came as company executives gathered in Toronto to see Felderhof named Canada’s Prospector of the Year.\n\nDe Guzman, who was in Toronto and courting an exotic dancer at the time, was summoned back to Indonesia to explain the discrepancy between the Bre-X and Freeport results.\n\nHe didn’t survive the trip.\n\nOn March 18, 1997, de Guzman arrived in Balikpapan, a seaport city on the island of Borneo, where the helicopter used by Bre-X was to take him the next day to the mining camp.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThat night, he went to a local karaoke restaurant and crooned a handful hits, including My Way. He appeared to be in a good mood.\n\nEarly the next morning he asked a colleague to fetch him some new clothes. His old ones were soaked, he explained, because he fell asleep in the tub after consuming a bottle of cough syrup.\n\n“It was my impression that he was trying to commit suicide that night,” a Bre-X metallurgist later told investigators in a statement.\n\nHours later, de Guzman boarded the Alouette III helicopter bound for Busang. Freeport officials were eagerly awaiting his arrival. Twenty minutes into the flight, the pilot heard a pop and a bang.\n\nThe door to the chopper was open and de Guzman was gone.\n\nIn the helicopter, police found a shopping bag with two handwritten notes. In one of them, de Guzman indicated he killed himself to escape the suffering of hepatitis B.\n\n“God bless you all. No more stomach pains!! No more back pains!!” it said.\n\nIt took authorities five days to find de Guzman’s remains. By the time they did, heat, bugs and animals had left little to help identify the corpse. A lump on the left shoulder was key to making the ID.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut the state of the body led skeptics — and some family members — to speculate it wasn’t de Guzman at all.\n\nSoon, conspiracy theories flourished: Was he murdered? Did he escape with a vast fortune? Is he still alive?\n\nYears later, the stories persist, including occasional “sightings” of de Guzman.\n\n“I personally believe de Guzman is alive and well and living somewhere in the Philippines,” says Joseph Groia, the Toronto-based lawyer who successfully defended Felderhof against charges of insider trading years later.\n\n“I believe (de Guzman) had a plan to find a dead body, buy it, dump it out of a helicopter in a place where it was going to be severely mutilated, and then move on with his life,” Groia says.\n\nIndonesian police, however, ruled de Guzman’s death a suicide.\n\nBut even before authorities found the corpse, Bre-X was fatally wounded.\n\nOn March 21, an Indonesian newspaper suggested the Busang gold find may not be the giant it was claimed. Bre-X denied the report, but the company’s shares fell.\n\nSoon, the overseas turmoil flooded Bre-X’s Calgary headquarters. On March 26, Strathcona Minerals, an independent consultant, found gold estimates may have been overstated. Bre-X partner Freeport-McMoRan then revealed the results of its initial tests. The next day, investors fled the stock.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBre-X’s ignoble end came a couple of months later when Strathcona’s probe produced a damning report that declared there was no gold at Busang. It found “the magnitude of the tampering with core samples that we believe occurred . . . is without precedent in the history of the world anywhere.”\n\nInvestors, who were still hoping for a shred of hope, were shattered.\n\n“At first it was disbelief that this could happen,” former journalist Ewart recalls.\n\n“At some point you could begin to see that there could potentially be a swindle there, but I think it took a while. I think people couldn’t get their heads around the fact that something could get this big without some checks and balances kicking in.”\n\nWalsh said he was devastated by the findings. A $2.5-million private investigation he commissioned with Bre-X funds ultimately exonerated him of involvement in the fraud.\n\nThe report by Forensic Investigative Associates Inc. instead pointed an accusing finger at de Guzman and several of his Filipino colleagues who worked at the alleged gold deposit in Indonesia.\n\nWalsh spent his final months steadfastly proclaiming his innocence.\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I am wiser and obviously more cynical — 4 1/2 years of hard work and the pot at the end of the rainbow is a bucket of slop,” Walsh said in 1997.\n\nHe died of an aneurysm the next year at his home in the Bahamas; his will stated that his only possessions were $7,500 US in household goods and a truck.\n\nRCMP spent months sifting through the ashes of the scheme, but in 1999 announced that they couldn’t gather enough evidence to lay any criminal charges in the history-making fraud.\n\nFelderhof, who maintained his innocence and belief that there was gold at Busang, fought a seven-year legal battle against the Ontario Securities Commission.\n\nThough the OSC never accused him of tampering with the gold, it argued that “red flags” warning the massive find was a hoax should have been obvious to the senior geologist.\n\nThe commission claimed Felderhof allowed false or misleading news releases to be issued to the investing public.\n\nIt also alleged he sold $84-million worth of stock while having information not disclosed to the investing public.\n\nBut while a judge found in his 2007 decision that “tampering at Bre-X was unprecedented,” it was also ruled that there were no red flags that should have been apparent to Felderhof.\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that Felderhof has proven that he took all reasonable care,” the judge concluded.\n\nThe ruling did not remove the stain from Felderhof, however. The man who lived to prospect never returned to the work he loved, not even as a consultant.\n\n“John’s been unable to get a job in the industry,” says Groia, his lawyer. “I’ve tried a few times to connect him with people who might have had a need for someone with his skills. The reality is, John is never going to be employed again in the business.”\n\nToday, the 77-year-old lives quietly and modestly in the Philippines, Groia adds.\n\n“He is by no means a wealthy man. I think it’s fair to say he leads a hardscrabble existence.”\n\nGroia — who maintains that de Guzman was the mastermind behind the salting scam — says Felderhof was scapegoated by securities officials, who needed to prosecute someone to satisfy the public’s desire for retribution in the case.\n\n“It was very clear to me that they went after John because they had to go after somebody,” Groia says. “Regulators sometimes don’t approach the problem from a principled standpoint, they approach it from an expedience standpoint. Who is the person who is the easiest target?”\n\nAdvertisement 12\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFelderhof has rarely spoken about Bre-X in recent years.\n\nIn an interview with the Northern Miner in 2012, Felderhof said he finally figured out how the salting was done, but wouldn’t point any fingers at a potential culprit. He reiterated for the reporter his long-standing belief that de Guzman had nothing to do with it, contrary to his lawyer’s assertions.\n\n“I know what it’s like to be accused,” he told the publication. “It’s easy to accuse and destroy a person’s life, but I have no proof, so I won’t accuse them.”\n\nTwenty years later, there is little left to remind Calgarians of the scandal beyond the new movie.\n\nThe red-brick building in Hillhurst — once the proud headquarters of the $6-billion company — has long been stripped of any Bre-X vestiges, including its prominent gold sign.\n\nToday, the company largely exists as a cautionary tale for business students, investors, the mining industry and police that sometimes the pot at the end of the rainbow really is nothing more than a bucket of slop.\n\n“I wouldn’t expect this to happen easily again in Canada — but it always can,” says Matthias Kipping, professor of policy and Richard E. Waugh chair in business history at York University’s Schulich School of Business.\n\nAdvertisement 13\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPart of the problem, Kipping says, is that humans easily fall prey to “eternally positive thinking” — even if an investment seems too good to be true, the desire to believe in it overrides rational thinking. He adds that most people also have short memories.\n\n“The thing with these scandals is they happen, there’s a big reaction and, after two or three years, people move on,” Kipping says. “And that’s part of the problem and why these things keep happening. No one’s learning their lesson.”\n\nTo read more, go to Bre-X: The real story and scandal that inspired the movie Gold.\n\nChronology of a scam\n\ntseskus@postemedia.com\n\nastephenson@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
