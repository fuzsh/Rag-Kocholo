        "text": "Interesting thought. I suppose Bond is being played by Anders. This isn't known to the audience or Bond for a good chunk of the picture. M is the one who suggests that Bond settle the score and face Scaramanga.\n\nGibson is morally a bit suspect. He is wanting to go back to the UK. Why he can't just go and needs to meet with Hip. Why meet with Hip? A low level agent. But I never understood why Gibson would want to \"defect\" or thought this was a complicated matter.\n\nScaramanga idolizes Bond and considers him to be a peer. This, in spite of the fact that we have never seen Bond perform an assignation on film. He attempts to kill the guy coming out of Elke Sommers mouth but Bey takes over. No matter Scaramanga feels Bond is his equal. Bond is repulsed by Scaramanga and agrees to his challenge. It takes on a personal edge. I think Bond doesn't like the comparison as it might hit a little too close to home.\n\nDo I consider Bond to the villain of the piece? No, he has different motivation for completing the mission but he's not the villain of the movie.\n\nGibson is morally a bit suspect. He is wanting to go back to the UK. Why he can't just go and needs to meet with Hip. Why meet with Hip? A low level agent. But I never understood why Gibson would want to \"defect\" or thought this was a complicated matter.\n\nYes I do wonder why he doesn't just go home. Presumably he must've left in slightly dodgy circumstances and presumably is thought of as working for the Red Chinese despite Fat being in Thailand. It's weirdly vague.\n\nDo I consider Bond to the villain of the piece? No, he has different motivation for completing the mission but he's not the villain of the movie.\n\nYes probably not the bad guy as such, but he is the antagonist in a way I'm not sure he is in many other Bond films. And I think his, and MI6's, motivations aren't as heroic as usual. Unusually the 'big plan' isn't the villain's plan but the British plan: obtain the Solex.\n\nI do wonder why they didn't just have Bond and Scaramanga racing to get hold of the Solex from a third party or something, or that Gibson had stolen the Solex from the British in the first place. In the version of the film we have it's hard not to conclude that it does, more or less, rightfully belong to Scaramanga.\n\nClearly Fat bankrolled the operation. Or at least we are lead to believe that. Scaramanga does tell Bond that him and the Chinese have \"an arrangement\" and it would appear that Gibson did work on the island for him so maybe that gave him the impression that he was working for communists.\n\nOn a James Bond and Friends podcast they talked about TMWTGG and LTK being a bit similar which at first glance seems preposterous. However Bond is clearly intent on one thing and it doesn't really concern his government. We see a side to Moore's Bond that we don't see again till LTK. This Bond roughs up woman. He goes on the aggressive to get the villain. LTK Bond clearly is the aggressor, in fact Sanchez provides hospitality to Bond and even involves him in his operation.\n\nIt is an interesting angle you have presented @mtm\n\ni think the point we are all missing here though - or it hasn't been mentioned, is Scaramanga and Sanchez are despicable human beings.. they have charming sophistication about them that is undeniable - but remember what their plans were beyond just who they are as people...\n\nyes, MI6's plans in TMWTGG could be veiwed in the grey area of morality.. but remember the time and place.. Scaramanga's plan was to sell the Solex tech and the Laser Gun to the highest bidder, which i believe was the real point of the Solex to begin with - sure it had it's energy saving facade, but we all saw what else that technology was capable of.. and at the time, possibly letting that tech fall into the hands of Communist China or Soviet Russia in a bidding war was something Mi6 was not going to let happen..\n\nScaramanga, the man himself, is a cold blooded killer... Bond is a killer too - he even addresses it, but he also says \"the men he kills are themselves killers.\".. while murder on any level is a sin, to Bond there is a moral difference he sees because he doesn't murder innocent people, or people in cold blood.. even Bond's coldest kills you could argue are just (within context).. plus when doing so, its under orders of his government to do so - he isn't freelance..\n\nin terms of Sanchez.. remember, he is dealing in not only narcotics, but black market arms dealing, and even threatened to commit acts of terrorism against innocent civilians by threatening to shoot down an airliner.. and also, he is a murderer... remember too, he killed an innocent woman, and nearly killed Felix to just to get back at him for getting him arrested.. it's one thing to go after Felix, but to go after his wife - and basically ordered to have her raped and then murdered.. that's pretty evil.\n\nbut the duality of these specific villains tho is what i think makes them 2 of the better villains in the entire franchise.. their motives are clear, and they believe what they are doing is morally right.. but they have a lot of charisma that makes it sort of easy to want to look past just how bad they are..\n\ni think the point we are all missing here though - or it hasn't been mentioned, is Scaramanga and Sanchez are despicable human beings.. they have charming sophistication about them that is undeniable - but remember what their plans were beyond just who they are as people...\n\nyes, MI6's plans in TMWTGG could be veiwed in the grey area of morality.. but remember the time and place..

He’s a paid assassin, sure, but once he’s gone his clients will just find another assassin: Bond hasn’t ended the assassination market by killing him.\n\nAs for selling the Solex to the highest bidder... well that’s rather how business works, and although Scaramanga went to extremes to ensure the Solex remained his, it was essentially rightfully his. If the British want it there’s nothing to say he won’t let them buy it from him. But their first resort is to take it by force, they don’t even try. Would M have ordered Bond to kill Gibson once they’d found him in Hong Kong I wonder?\n\nAnd what do they do with it? We never hear of a solar revolution, so did they let the oil companies pay them off perhaps...?\n\nAre MI6 ever shown as morally dubious in any other Bond film? I’m trying to think."
