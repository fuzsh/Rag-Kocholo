        "text": "01 of 30\n\n1917 (2019)\n\nThis Oscar-winning war film presents its story with bracing realism. In 1917, Lance Corporal William \"Will\" Schofield (George MacKay) is a British soldier embarking on a perilous journey through the trenches and battlefields of World War I. Will is paired with Lance Corporal Thomas \"Tom\" Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and tasked with personally delivering a message to a colonel to call off an offensive attack that would put British soldiers in harm's way.\n\nDirector Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins skillfully give the film the illusion of being shot seamlessly — as if in only one continuous take — which, EW's critic observes, \"effectively drops the viewer into the center of the story and compels them to stay there, fully immersed in every muddy step, hunger pang, and rifle click.\" —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch 1917: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Sam Mendes\n\nCast: George MacKay, Dean-Charles Chapman, Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Richard Madden, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch\n\n02 of 30\n\nAmerican Psycho (2000)\n\nChristian Bale elevated his career to a new level with his committed portrayal of Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. The film centers on Patrick, an investment banker immersed in the empty consumerism of the corporate world, whose jealousy and lust for power leads him to murder. As EW's critic writes, \"Mary Harron's American Psycho is a merry-prankster nightmare — a cheerfully irreverent drawing-room slasher movie.\" While the film was ultimately a box office disappointment, time has been kind to American Psycho; its depiction of a social-climbing yuppie with anxiety over how other people perceive him makes him eerily relatable — just hopefully without the whole serial killer part. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch American Psycho: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Mary Harron\n\nCast: Christian Bale, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage, Chloë Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis, Matt Ross, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe\n\n03 of 30\n\nBack to the Future (1985)\n\nA high schooler travels into the past via DeLorean, meets his parents when they were his age, and nearly causes a rift that prevents his existence — a tale as old as time! Robert Zemeckis' beloved sci-fi comedy may have an inherently fantastical premise, but what's helped it endure decades later is its foundation of authentic humanity, thanks in large part to Michael J. Fox's endearing performance. His Marty McFly is plucky in the face of unusual circumstances, and his partnership with his friend and mentor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) makes them one of the all-time great cinematic duos. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Back to the Future: Netflix\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nCast: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover\n\n04 of 30\n\nCall Me by Your Name (2017)\n\nThis sensual tale of yearning set in 1983 Italy is one of director Luca Guadagnino's finest works. Timothée Chalamet stars as Elio, a 17-year-old who falls in love with his father's handsome new graduate student, Oliver (Armie Hammer). Basking in the hot summer days, Elio and Oliver explore the countryside and form a passionate bond that will affect both of their lives forever. The film made a star out of Chalamet, who earned an Oscar nomination for his sensitive, complex performance as a teen coming of age and realizing what he desires for himself. As EW's critic writes of the film, \"It’s real life, heartbreaking and sublime.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Call Me by Your Name: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Luca Guadagnino\n\nCast: Timothée Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Amira Casar, Victoire Du Bois\n\n05 of 30\n\nThe Edge of Seventeen (2016)\n\nThe Edge of Seventeen embraces the wonderfully awkward growing pains of being a teenage girl. Hailee Steinfeld stars as Nadine, a disaffected 17-year-old who is left mortified upon learning her older brother Darian (Blake Jenner) is now dating her best friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson). Nadine soon offers an ultimatum to Krista: her or Darian. After Krista fails to make this binary choice, Nadine coldly ends their friendship, which sends herself down a darker path than before. \"Seventeen gets that being young can feel like The Hunger Games without the prizes,\" EW's critic writes, \"at least there’s always hope — and graduation — on the other side.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Edge of Seventeen: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Kelly Fremon Craig\n\nCast: Hailee Steinfeld, Woody Harrelson, Kyra Sedgwick, Haley Lu Richardson, Blake Jenner\n\n06 of 30\n\nEmily the Criminal (2022)\n\nAubrey Plaza gives one of her finest turns to date in this grounded thriller. She plays the titular down-on-her-luck felon who resorts to theft to make her way out from under a mountain of debt. \"She may be a wanton criminal, but she's also a woman very much for these times,\" EW's critic writes. \"Not the anti-heroine we knew we needed, maybe, but one that we deserve.\" It's a visceral, often unbearably anxious film that showcases Plaza's steeliest, most nuanced performance in a career full of them. —Declan Gallagher\n\nWhere to watch Emily the Criminal: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: John Patton Ford\n\nCast: Aubrey Plaza, Gina Gershon, Megalyn Echikunwoke, Theo Rossi, Bernardo Badillo\n\n07 of 30\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once (2022)\n\nFew films in recent memory have lived up to their title as well as Everything Everywhere All at Once. Combining science fiction, action, broad comedy, and heart-tugging drama, the film manages to cohere into an absurdist masterpiece about finding value in the life you have, without giving in to regret.\n\nAction superstar Michelle Yeoh stars as Evelyn Wang, a Chinese immigrant living in America with her loving husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) and daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu), with whom she has a strained relationship. One day, while being audited by the IRS, she accepts an offer to escape her life to help prevent a powerful force from destroying the multiverse, setting in motion a dangerous — yet deeply personal — journey. Everything Everywhere All at Once resonated with both critics and audiences, winning seven Oscars including Best Picture and Best Actress for Yeoh. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Everything Everywhere All at Once: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert\n\nCast: Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis, James Hong\n\n08 of 30\n\nGodzilla Minus One (2023)\n\nFilms in the long-running Godzilla franchise aren't exactly known for their human characters compared to the titular giant reptilian monster, but this universally acclaimed installment is a rare exception. The film focuses on former kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a man with PTSD after failing to prevent Godzilla from destroying an island community during World War II. Haunted by the incident, Shikishima looks for redemption when the imposing monster returns to terrorize Japan.\n\nEW's critic ranks Godzilla Minus One — which won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects — as the fourth-best film in the franchise, writing, \"This sweeping blend of character-driven drama, maritime adventure, and kaiju mayhem is popcorn entertainment at its best.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Godzilla Minus One: Netflix\n\nDirector: Takashi Yamazaki\n\nCast: Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Yuki Yamada, Munetaka Aoki, Hidetaka Yoshioka, Sakura Ando, Kuranosuke Sasaki\n\n09 of 30\n\nIt Follows (2014)\n\nDavid Robert Mitchell's chilling, low-fi horror opus has inspired a variety of successors, including 2022's Smile and 2023's exceptional Talk to Me. None of those films have replicated dread and unease in quite the same way as Mitchell's original, though. Maika Monroe stars as Jay, a teen who, after engaging in a one-night stand, is given an STD (\"sexually transmitted demon\") that she can only pass on by sleeping with someone else. If that's not bad enough, the curse also takes the form of shuffling, stalking entities that may or may not be real. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch It Follows: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: David Robert Mitchell\n\nCast: Maika Monroe, Keir Gilchrist, Jake Weary, Lili Sepe, Olivia Luccardi\n\n10 of 30\n\nThe Killer (2023)\n\nDavid Fincher's latest thriller is a white-knuckle, pared-down genre exercise that calls back to '70s exploitation films but also owes quite a bit to Anton Corbijn's The American (2010). Michael Fassbender stars as the nameless assassin who, after a hit goes wrong and his family is targeted, chases after a shadow enforcer (Tilda Swinton) for revenge. EW's critic observes, \"With a reptilian coldness, Fassbender infuses the 'Killer' with an eerie stillness that underscores the character's lack of empathy and warmth.\" —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Killer: Netflix\n\nEW grade: C+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nCast: Michael Fassbender, Tilda Swinton, Arliss Howard, Charles Parnell, Sala Baker\n\n11 of 30\n\nLa La Land (2016)\n\nFew modern musicals have shined so brightly as Damien Chazelle's vibrant comedy-drama about an actress and a jazz musician who fall in love against the backdrop of Los Angeles. Played with exuberance by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, the pair attempt to achieve their dreams while maintaining their relationship, even if this balancing act proves difficult. Packed with musical sequences both dazzling and wistful, La La Land's strength lies in its embracing of old-school entertainment without being necessarily old-fashioned. Stone won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance, while the film famously almost won Best Picture. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch La La Land: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Damien Chazelle\n\nCast: Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling, John Legend, J.K. Simmons, Rosemarie DeWitt, Finn Wittrock\n\n12 of 30\n\nMarcel the Shell With Shoes On (2022)\n\nMarcel the Shell With Shoes On adapts the beloved video series of the same name from the early-2010s. The live-action/stop-motion animated hybrid film centers on the titular Marcel (Jenny Slate), a talking seashell who cares for his nana, Connie (Isabella Rossellini). A documentary filmmaker follows Marcel's activities and posts them online, making him a viral sensation and prompting him to make efforts to reunite with the rest of his family. The tender-hearted film blends humor with genuine pathos as it explores themes of family ties and the value of simple kindness. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Marcel the Shell With Shoes On: Netflix\n\nDirector: Dean Fleischer Camp\n\nCast: Jenny Slate, Isabella Rossellini, Rosa Salazar, Thomas Mann, Dean Fleischer Camp, Lesley Stahl, Jesse Cilio\n\n13 of 30\n\nMolly's Game (2017)\n\nOscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin made his directorial debut with this engrossing biographical drama about entrepreneur Molly Bloom and her tumultuous experience in the world of high-stakes poker. Jessica Chastain plays the title role, following her journey from aspiring Olympian to bottle service waitress to running an underground poker empire. Her success is soon threatened when multiple mafias get involved in her games leading to an FBI investigation and her indictment.\n\nThe film soars on the strength of Chastain's charismatic performance, a perfect match for Sorkin's signature clever dialogue. As EW's critic writes, Molly's Game is \"a cool, crackling, confident film that appeals to your intelligence instead of insulting it.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Molly's Game: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Aaron Sorkin\n\nCast: Jessica Chastain, Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera, Jeremy Strong, Chris O'Dowd, Bill Camp\n\n14 of 30\n\nMr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)\n\nWith the new TV remake with Donald Glover and Maya Erskine now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, there's no better time to revisit the 2005 film of the same name. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as John and Jane Smith, a couple whose marriage is on shaky ground. They also happen to both be skilled assassins, though neither is aware of each other's occupation. This all changes when they're both assigned to kill the same target, which complicates everything to the point that they're soon tasked with killing each other. Hijinks ensue, and the film is propelled by the undeniable chemistry between Pitt and Jolie, who EW's critic writes have a \"chemical zing.\" Thus, Brangelina was born. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Mr. & Mrs. Smith: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Doug Liman\n\nCast: Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Adam Brody, Kerry Washington\n\n15 of 30\n\nNo Hard Feelings (2023)\n\nThis raunchy comedy represented both a strong comeback for Jennifer Lawrence after a few low-key years and a return to form for the genre, which has seen lean times as of late. It stars Lawrence as a down-on-her-luck thirtysomething who, in order to repair her car, must deflower a nerdy young man (Andrew Barth Feldman) before he goes off to college. No Hard Feelings isn't a perfect movie, but it is often laugh-out-loud funny and subversive in all the right ways without ever insisting upon itself. EW's critic calls the film \"a welcome addition to a dwindling genre — and a reminder that Lawrence is one [of] Hollywood's best (and funniest) leads.\" —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch No Hard Feelings: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gene Stupnitsky\n\nCast: Jennifer Lawrence, Andrew Barth Feldman, Matthew Broderick, Laura Benanti, Natalie Morales\n\n16 of 30\n\nNyad (2023)\n\nAnnette Bening gives an astonishing, Oscar-nominated performance as real-life marathon swimmer Diana Nyad, who at 64 trained to become the first person to swim to Cuba. Equally riveting as Nyad's trainer is Jodie Foster (also Oscar-nominated), reminding viewers that in terms of steely confidence, someone rarely does it better than her. \"The two women also share an effortless chemistry that breathes vitality into their onscreen bond and wholeheartedly sells their decades-long connection,\" EW's critic writes. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Nyad: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi\n\nCast: Annette Bening, Jodie Foster, Rhys Ifans, Luke Cosgrove, Karly Rothenberg\n\n17 of 30\n\nPhantom Thread (2017)\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson's 1950s-set costume drama is a transfixing exploration of power dynamics within a relationship, and how love can be sickening — literally. Daniel Day-Lewis, in his self-proclaimed final film role, stars as Reynolds Woodcock, a renowned fashion designer who enters a tumultuous romance with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress whom he soon makes his muse. But Alma is much cleverer than she appears, while Reynolds is more difficult to live with than she had hoped, leading to dysfunction. Adorned with dry humor and sumptuous visuals, Phantom Thread is a masterwork from one of modern cinema's best craftsmen. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Phantom Thread: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nCast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Vicky Krieps, Lesley Manville\n\n18 of 30\n\nThe Power of the Dog (2021)\n\nJane Campion's adaptation of the Thomas Savage novel is a spellbinding Western drama about power and control. Set in 1920s Montana, the film centers on Phil Burbank (Benedict Cumberbatch) a cruel rancher who psychologically torments his brother (Jesse Plemons), sister-in-law (Kirsten Dunst), and her soft-spoken son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) on the ranch they share. After Peter discovers a buried secret about Phil, he methodically plots his revenge on his uncle. Campion deservedly won an Oscar for Best Director for the film; as EW's critic praises, \"being submerged in her ineffable world feels not just like two hours in the dark, but high art.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Power of the Dog: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jane Campion\n\nCast: Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons, Kirsten Dunst, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Thomasin McKenzie, Genevieve Lemon, Keith Carradine, Frances Conroy\n\n19 of 30\n\nRRR (2022)\n\nThis Indian action epic rightfully broke out as an international success in 2022. Set during the British Raj in the 1920s, the film centers on Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) and his plan to reunite a kidnapped girl with her mother; meanwhile, a determined officer, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan), is hot on his trail. Their lives intersect when they rescue a boy in a train accident and they form a bond, ironically unaware of each other's identities. Packed with rousing sequences (particularly the performance of the Oscar-winning song \"Naatu Naatu\"), RRR is an entertaining thrill ride that puts Hollywood blockbusters to shame. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch RRR: Netflix\n\nDirector: S.S.

After two years of inhabiting his web-slinging persona, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) faces difficulties in his personal life while also trying to protect his beloved Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and the city of New York from a new villain, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), whose body is fused with four mechanical tentacles operated with artificial intelligence.\n\nWhat separates Spider-Man 2 from other superhero films is its investment in the personal struggles of its characters, not only exploring Peter's identity but giving us a morally complex villain in Dr. Octavius and a moving emotional throughline with Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), and, thus, providing genuine stakes to one visually stunning action sequence after another. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Spider-Man 2: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Sam Raimi\n\nCast: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, Donna Murphy\n\n21 of 30\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023)\n\nThis sugar-rush sequel took all of the best things about Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and magnified them. It continues the tale of Miles Morales as he struggles with his newfound powers to find his place in a multi-verse of Spider-Men. If only all family-oriented animated films were this invigorating, or indeed, risk-taking. As EW's critic writes, \"Across the Spider-Verse mines greater emotional depth by exploring the familial relationships of Gwen and Miles from the perspectives of both parents and children.\" —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, Justin K.

After struggling novelist Frank (Jeff Daniels) and his more successful wife, Joan (Laura Linney), reveal their separation to their kids (Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline), everything becomes a battle as the brothers choose sides and the parents try to find a way forward. Writer-director Noah Baumbach excavates his own childhood to tell a story of family strife in all its (sometimes hilarious) messiness. EW's critic calls the film a \"caustically funny, awfully sad, pitilessly autobiographical coming-of-age story.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Squid and the Whale: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Noah Baumbach\n\nCast: Jeff Daniels, Laura Linney, Jesse Eisenberg, Owen Kline, William Baldwin, Anna Paquin\n\n23 of 30\n\nTangerine (2015)\n\nThere is much to praise with this independent film from writer-director Sean Baker: it was shot entirely by iPhones and has great style; it casts two transgender actresses as leads, each giving strong performances. But it's also a good old-fashioned screwball comedy, following a day in the lives of transgender sex worker friends Sin-Dee (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) and Alexandra (Mya Taylor), After Alexandra informs Sin-Dee that the latter's boyfriend has been cheating on her, the pair go on a journey through the streets of Hollywood to confront him. EW's critic raves, \"Tangerine is touching for its non-condescending stance toward working girls and the spirit of the sidewalk.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Tangerine: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Sean Baker\n\nCast: Kitana Kiki Rodriguez, Mya Taylor, Karren Karagulian, Mickey O'Hagan, Alla Tumanian, James Ransone\n\n24 of 30\n\nThe Teachers' Lounge (2023)\n\nAfter this tense Oscar-nominated German film gets going, it refuses to let up. Carla Nowak (Leonie Benesch) is the bright-eyed new teacher at a school where her fellow educators are trying to uncover the culprit behind multiple thefts from the teachers' lounge. She soon finds herself embroiled in the case when she spots a colleague stealing money, only for that colleague to deflect onto her. The Teachers' Lounge moves with the energy of a thriller, with viewers' anxiety rising the further Carla grapples with mounting pressure. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Teachers' Lounge: Netflix\n\nDirector: Ilker Çatak\n\nCast: Leonie Benesch, Michael Klammer, Rafael Stachowiak, Anne-Kathrin Gummich, Eva Löbau\n\n25 of 30\n\nTick, Tick...Boom! (2021)\n\nJonathan Larson was a celebrated composer and playwright most famous for penning the Broadway musical Rent. He also wrote a semi-autobiographical musical based on his life called Tick, Tick...Boom!, which Lin-Manuel Miranda adapted to this well-received musical drama. Andrew Garfield, in an Oscar-nominated turn, stars as Larson, following his struggle to mount a musical while dealing with a tumultuous personal life. \"Tick, Tick… Boom! is a totem for the thrills and trials of making art, with all the sacrifices and empathy it requires,\" EW's critic writes. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch tick, tick...BOOM!: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Lin-Manuel Miranda\n\nCast: Andrew Garfield, Alexandra Shipp, Robin de Jesús, Joshua Henry, Judith Light, Vanessa Hudgens\n\n26 of 30\n\nTriple Frontier (2019)\n\nJ.C. Chandor's masculine action riff, about a group of special ops planning a heist in South America, is a stark contrast to his earlier, more patient efforts in 2011's Margin Call, 2013's All Is Lost, or 2014's A Most Violent Year (his masterpiece). While not as thematically strong as those films, Triple Frontier offers a dose of adrenaline that, much like The Strangers, harkens back to a forgotten era of mid-'70s B pictures. \"There may be no honor among thieves,\" EW's critic writes, \"but Triple Frontier certainly makes watching them pretty entertaining.\" —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch Triple Frontier: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: J.C.

To elaborate any further would give away some of the film's best-kept twists, of which there are many. Suffice it to say, The Wailing is one of the most over-the-top, gratuitous, and devilishly fun horror pictures of the last decade. As EW's critic praised, \"The Wailing never bores as Na slathers his tale with generous supplies of atmosphere and awfulness.\" —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Wailing: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Na Hong-jin\n\nCast: Hwang Jung-Min, Kwak Do-won, Kim Hwan-hee, Kim Do-yoon\n\n28 of 30\n\nThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More (2024)\n\nThis whimsical anthology film finds auteur director Wes Anderson bringing the stories of Roald Dahl to life. Originally released as four short films in 2023, Netflix has now assembled them all into one collection. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, which won the Oscar for Best Live Action Short, centers on the titular character's years-long training process to be able to see without his eyes — all so he can cheat at gambling.\n\nOther shorts are The Swan (about the struggles of a bullied boy), The Rat Catcher (about, well, an exterminator of rats), and Poison (about a man who finds a snake in his bed). Anderson's flair for carefully crafted aesthetics is a throughline, as is his love of the art of storytelling. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More: Netflix\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nCast: Ralph Fiennes, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dev Patel, Ben Kingsley, Richard Ayoade, Rupert Friend\n\n29 of 30\n\nWorld War Z (2016)\n\nThis pulse-pounding action thriller about a zombie apocalypse may diverge from Max Brooks' best-selling book of the same name, but its virtues are plenty. Brad Pitt stars as Gerry Lane, a former investigator for the United Nations who searches the globe for a cure to the deadly outbreak. Of course, with the outbreak spreading at an accelerated pace, it's a race against the clock as Gerry navigates perilous environments on his quest. \"World War Z turns the prospect of the end of our world into something tumultuous and horrifying and, at the same time, exciting,\" writes EW's critic. \"It’s scary good fun.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch World War Z: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Mark Forster\n\nCast: Brad Pitt, Mireille Enos, Daniella Kertesz, Matthew Fox, Elyes Gabel\n\n30 of 30\n\nThe Wrong Missy (2020)\n\nOn paper, The Wrong Missy is nothing new: David Spade goes on a bad date with Lauren Lapkus, whose name is Missy, and then means to invite a cute girl (Molly Sims), hilariously also named Missy, with him on a company retreat to Hawaii. (No points for guessing which Missy ends up on the trip.) The film coasts by on a general likability, but if not for Lapkus' performance, the story would be lost at sea. She glues the entire enterprise together with a mixture of well-played raunch and genuine pathos, selling the moment and keeping the plot bouncing along to the next joke. —D.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Wrong Missy: Netflix\n\nDirector: Tyler Spindel\n\nCast: Lauren Lapkus, David Spade, Molly Sims, Jackie Sandler, Rob Schneider"
