        "text": "Film Independent’s Fiscal Sponsorship program opens the door to nonprofit funding for independent filmmakers and media artists. Donate today and help bring Earl’s Gotta Die to life.\n\nLogline\n\nAfter having her bright and spunky spirit beaten down one too many times by her abusive husband, Earl, Frankie accidentally kills him. Her best friend Ava Mae helms the escape, and in their police chased mad dash to ditch the body, Earl transforms into a loveable zombie. Breaking up really IS hard to do… But one way or another, EARL’S GOTTA DIE.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThis short film is a proof of concept for a feature by the same name.\n\nFRANKIE (30s, once full of moxie, now browbeaten into anxiety) drives her husband’s prized Mercury through Tennessee backroads with her ride-or-die AVA-MAE (30s, Smug as hell) at her side. Frankie is wracked with guilt, but Ava-Mae insists he deserved it. The “he” is actually tied up in the trunk, moaning, banging, making a real fuss. The women careen down the dark highway, and the law shows up. Lights, sirens, and Earl’s racket fill Frankie’s head. She can barely steer the car; this was a terrible idea. Ava-Mae reminds her of all the ways Earl did her wrong, including making her get rid of her cat, Chompers. Frankie pulls them into the woods, landing them literally… in the thick of it. A gun tumbles out of the glove box as they crash and pop a tire.\n\nThe officer finds them and conducts a “pat down,” groping Frankie. Ava-Mae quietly slips her the gun and Frankie turns it on the officer. He pulls his gun in kind and notices the noises coming from the trunk. It’s none other than a zombified Earl. The officer tries to shoot Earl, and when a stray bullet damages the precious car, Earl’s eyes glow red. He feasts on the problematic officer. Convenient!\n\nAva-Mae changes the spare, and Frankie watches Earl eat; he offers her some. Very sweet! Just then, in superhuman or super zombie strength, he picks up the car and swaps in the new tire. Helpful! Frankie is torn; maybe she could live with this flesh-eating but copacetic version of her husband. Ava-Mae presses the gun into Frankie’s hand, reminding her what’s at stake. Frankie raises the gun and points it at Earl. Cut to black. A gunshot sounds.\n\nMeet the Filmmakers\n\nHeather Shapiro – Writer/Director\n\nDirector’s Note: I am tired of seeing two-dimensional bad guys who bully a simpering, helpless lady. There have been stories of abusive men, but these stories fail to consider the gradations of emotional abuse and trauma survivors must confront. The abuser invades their victim’s mind and contorts their thoughts, making them doubt reality. That would bring any person to their knees. I was just such a person, and I’d never seen an authentic example of my experience on film. Earl’s Gotta Die is my remedy.\n\nHeather Shapiro is a swiss-army-knife creative who makes dark comedies about big issues told in small snatches of time. She wrote, directed, and starred in the semi-scripted series El Kimberley Proyect (Funny or Die) filmed in Montevideo, Uruguay. In 2017, she moved to Chicago and completed the Second City Film program with her short Sitting Shiva (Fargo Film Festival). She now works as a story producer for docu-series like De La Calle (MTV, Tribeca 2023). In 2023, her feature script Earl’s Gotta Die was selected for the second round of the Sundance Development Lab.\n\nHeather graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in interdisciplinary studies. She trained at Second City and The Groundlings. heathershapiro.com\n\nAmanda Hinkley – Writer/Co-Executive Producer\n\nAmanda Hinkley loves toeing the lines between absurdist situational comedy, psychological deep dives, and fart jokes.
