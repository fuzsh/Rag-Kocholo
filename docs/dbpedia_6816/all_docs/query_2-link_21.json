        "text": "Could it be Kingsman: The Golden Circle?\n\nAudiences believed Hart was a goner at the end of Kingsman: The Secret Service, but a flashback sequence in The Golden Circle reveals that two members of the U.S.-run Statesman agency swarmed onto the crime to investigate after Hart was left for dead. The American spies, played by Channing Tatum and Halle Berry, go into first-aid mode by wrapping a plastic-like shrink-wrap around Hart’s injured head.\n\nWhen it’s activated, the shrink-wrap rapidly inflates with a swirl of orange and blue gel, which then fills in the hole in his skull. This “bio-foam” is what keeps [the victim] alive until nanites (nano-scale robots) rush in to repair the damage. It may seem like another ridiculous made-up tool in the super-spy toolkit, but its premise is something actual scientists have already considered.\n\nIt contains a scene very much like the one you suggest (twice, actually). I came upon it by doing a Google search for film gel cures gunshot wound.\n\nThis sounds sort of like Kingsmen: the golden circle, in it there's a gel like substance which gets wrapped around a characters head in order to save them from a headshot."
