We aim to:\n\nBe clear about what we know, how we know it, and what we don't know\n\nEmbrace baseline description as a tool to improve the discoverability of all our materials\n\nDemonstrate an understanding that description is a continuous and necessarily iterative endeavor\n\nRead more about our past and current approaches to description in Toward Ethical and Inclusive Descriptive Practices in UCLA Library Special Collections.\n\nThe UCLA Library Special Collections holds a large amount of primary source materials pertaining to music. This guide is intended as a starting place to point researchers to these materials and also serves as a basic orientation on using Library Special Collections holdings.\n\nIncluded here are materials related to all forms of musical stage performances including, but not limited to musical fantasies, revues, comedies, plays, satires, melodramas, sketches, vaudeville productions, burlesque, etc.\n\nFind materials on musicals in the Online Archive of California.\n\nHere you will find information about specific sound recording collections. These collections consist of sound recordings only. Be aware that many other collections (not listed below) contain sound recordings in addition to other types of music materials."
