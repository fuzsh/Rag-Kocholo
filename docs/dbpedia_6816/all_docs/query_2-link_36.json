        "text": "Premiering a few months after Spider-Man: No Way Home and a few months before Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, an A24 film made for roughly the catering budget of those films somehow ate their lunch on the subject of the multiverse. A Chinese-American immigrant family — Michelle Yeoh as the mother, Ke Huy Quan as the father, Stephanie Hsu as the daughter — is falling apart for what seem like mundane reasons. But thanks to the imagination of writer-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, we find out their dysfunctional dynamic is really because a series of parallel realities are falling apart, all thanks to the schism between an alternate Yeoh and an alternate Hsu. As characters leap from universe to universe (including one where humanity evolved to have… hot dog fingers?), and borrow skills from their counterparts, the Daniels never lose sight of the frayed emotions that are still tying the three main characters together, which in turn kept the metaphysical machinations feeling clear and easy to follow. —AS\n\nLong before he’d make one of the best Star Wars movie in a generation — haters are welcome to exit the building at this time — Rian Johnson gave us this Mob-movie-meets-Mobius-strip tale of hit men known as Loopers, who take out on crooks, schnooks and stool pigeons sent back in time. One such professional killer, Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levittt), finds himself in a sticky situation: The latest victim due for a permanent dirt nap happens to be… an older version of Joe (Bruce Willis) from the future. After the latter escapes before the former can “close the loop,” the two Joes are set up for a date with destiny on a rural farm in Kansas, occupied by a single mom (Emily Blunt) and her very special son. Time travel is only the tip of the sci-fi iceberg here; Johnson also gives us powerful telekinetic psychics, a vision of 2044 that mixes old-school blunderbusses with bleeding-edge tech, and a genius riff on the notion of the past never being done with us, even if we think we’re done with the past. An instant classic, no matter what timeline you happen to be living in. —DF\n\nIt’s a new morning in America, and new-in-town transient Roddy Piper smells a rat when he sees the LAPD hassling the community organizers of a homeless encampment. Once he slips on a pair of specialized sunglasses, however, he’s able to see what’s really going on — and brother, it ain’t pretty. John Carpenter’s merciless satire of ’80s consumerism and don’t-worry-be-happy infotainment suggests that behind every bit of media is a subliminal message: Be passive. Marry and reproduce. Buy things. Watch TV. Buy more things. It may be best known for its primo tough-guy dialogue (“I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass…and I’m all out of bubblegum”), its six-minute fistfight scene between Piper and Keith David, and inspiring Shepard Fairey’s “Obey” street art. But the film’s ability to lock in to how the powers that be (even if said powers are aliens) use endless distraction to keep the public docile is what makes it feel so unsettling. “It’s not science-fiction,” Carpenter has said when asked about They Live. “It’s a documentary.” —DF\n\nYes, the 1985 blockbuster is a comedy first and foremost, with a premise — What if you traveled back in time, and your mom wanted to have sex with you? — that’s still hard to believe ever got made. And without the charisma and comic timing of Michael J. Fox as confused teen Marty McFly, the aggressive oddness of Christopher Lloyd’s Doc Brown, the unapologetic lust of Lea Thompson’s Lorraine, and the… whatever it is that Crispin Glover is doing as George, none of it would work. Yet Bob Gale and director Robert Zemeckis’ script is Swiss watch tight in its plotting and how it deals with the complications of having a DeLorean that can go backwards and forwards in time whenever it hits 88 mph. It imprinted itself so deeply on the public consciousness that other movies about time travel, like Avengers: Endgame, feature characters whose primary knowledge of the subject comes from Doc Brown. —AS\n\nTake Shakespeare’s The Tempest, reset its tale on the distant planet of Altair-4, cast the future star of The Naked Gun as a he-man hero, then add in a near-lethal dose of Freudian neurosis and one of the most famous robots in film history. Voila! You have Fred M. Wilcox’s incredibly inspirational science fiction adventure, one of the few “prestige” studio-released genre films of the 1950s. The high-falutin’ psychological aspects and high-budget production design — a rarity for S.F. films of that era, which were usually aimed at the 14-and-under crowd — did give this story of an interstellar crew looking for a lost colony of explorers a certain respectability among those who’d never usually be caught dead watching films with rockets, ‘bots and a beast drawn by an out-on-loan Disney’s special-effects animation department. Yet it’s still very much the sort of science fiction movie that thrilled fans of outer space derring-do, especially once young Leslie Nielsen begins making eyes at Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon’s Dr. Morbius sicks the Id Monster on folks and Robbie the Robot starts dropping computer science. Not to mention that the movie’s soundtrack is also an all-time banger. —DF\n\nJames Cameron’s sequel to Ridley Scott’s game-changing sci-fi/horror hybrid juices it up for the muscleman ‘80s, injecting tough-talking space Marines, heavy firepower, and Bill Paxton dispensing surfer-inflected catchphrases into an action-packed rescue mission to the corporate space colony where it all began. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is, of course, reluctantly along for the ride, though definitely not out of her depth, here or ever — as she proves early on, she can operate heavy machinery and hunt “bugs” with the best of them. The movie not only turns Ripley a more nuanced version of someone who can handle herself under pressure (and gives Weaver a showcase to do some of her best work to boot), it also flips the script on the decade’s he-man action-hero ideal, making her the ultimate mama bear to scrappy survivor Newt (Carrie Henn). And it set the bar for future franchises by proving that not all sequels were destined to be merely rinse-repeat retreads of the original. —KR\n\nDavid Bowie’s feature film debut arrived at an apt moment for the singer to play someone untethered from life on Earth but in danger of falling victim to gravity’s pull. Made in an era when Bowie was living on a diet that consisted heavily of cocaine, milk, and mystical arcana, this Nicolas Roeg film casts him as Thomas Jerome Newton, a fragile visitor from a drought-stricken planet seeking to make a fortune on Earth as a means of saving his home planet and the family he left behind. The source material, a novel by Walter Tevis, used its premise to explore how genius gets subsumed by addiction and other earthly pleasures. Roeg’s adaptation keeps those themes while adding hallucinatory layers that turn ’70s America into a fantasia in which the past and the future keep collapsing into the present, as seen through the eyes of a creature who mistakenly believes he’s only a visitor — and not a prisoner. —KP\n\nStop us if you’ve heard this one before: A kid stuck in a podunk town with nothing much to do gets a chance to go on a whirlwind adventure and rescue a beautiful princess in distress. Also, he is quite possibly the person who a group of spiritual warriors once prophesied would be the “new hope” for universe in a fight against a tyrannical evil empire. Also also, there are Wookiees. Don’t get us started on the kid’s dad.\n\nIt goes without saying that George Lucas’s movie — which would turn out to be not just the inaugural chapter of a multi-episode narrative, but a Rosetta stone for an I.P. universe that’s still very much in-progress — has made an impact on pop culture. Yet the way his amalgamation of Flash Gordon serials, WWII dogfight epics, Westerns, Akira Kurosawa samurai movies and Greek tragedy changed how several generations have consumed science fiction in particular can’t be overstated; from the moment that ginormous Imperial Starcruiser whizzed across the screen, in hot pursuit of a rebel vessel, Star Wars tapped into our collective imagination and sold us on the power of sci-fi as mass entertainment. The names Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Darth Vader and R2-D2 are as familiar to folks as JFK, Bob Dylan, Donald Trump and Siri — maybe even moreso. Every science fiction film that’s come out after it has arguably either been a reaction to it or an attempt to recapture the film’s awe-inspiring magic. Either way, it’s forever given us a taste for drama, romance, derring-do and morality set in a galaxy far, far away. —DF\n\nThere are multiple reasons why director Fritz Lang’s allegorical science-fiction romance has been an enduring influence on genre cinema. But let’s start with the maximalist set design, which inspired the looks of Star Wars, Batman, Brazil and many, many more. Lang was an ace visual storyteller, who in the silent era proved repeatedly that motion pictures could combine the complexity of a novel with the flash of a magic show. Here, he brought together towering scenery, state-of-the-art visual effects and hundreds of extras for a sophisticated story about the potentially revolutionary relationship between a privileged young man and a working-class activist, each in their own way being ground down by a stratified technocratic society.\n\nCo-written with Thea von Harbou — Lang’s wife, who also wrote the book on which its based — the film dwells on both the literal and metaphorical mechanisms of the modern age. It pulls from different cultures and trends of the 1920s, from the imposing scale of New York’s art deco skyscrapers to the socialist fervor then sweeping through Europe. And it seems eerily prescient with its take on how industrialization may one day make it hard to distinguish people from robots. Artists still draw from this film’s conception of a world destined to be dominated by titanic machinery and shiny pleasure palaces — and where human warmth survives even in the long, cold shadows of tall buildings. —NM\n\nYou can praise Alfonso Cuarón’s dystopian nightmare for so many reasons, from its astounding technical accomplishments (see: the much deservedly celebrated one-take shot by Emmanuel Lubezki from inside a moving car) from the performances by Clive Owen and, specifically, Clare-Hope Ashitey as the potential savior of humanity. But mostly Children of Men should be celebrated as one of the best pieces of speculative fiction of the 21st Century, and one that’s only grown in stature as the years have gone by. Yes, at times it’s a relentingly grim film that revolves around a future characterized by nonstop terrorism, totalitarian rule and mass infertility, where it seems like any glimmer of optimism is a fool’s game. But it also allows that spell of darkness to break in tiny ways, especially in the moving finale — there’s a glimpse of a future for the human race after all. So much sci-fi can imply the absence of empathy. Children of Men is nothing if not a violent, aching plea for compassion. —EZ\n\nCall it a Man Who Fell to Earth for millennials. Jonathan Glazer’s cryptic tale of an extraterrestrial femme fatale (Scarlett Johansson, in what is still a career-best performance) who lures unsuspecting dudes to their death — and then accidentally discovers she has more in common with this species than she thought is — in the truest sense of the word, awesome. Lots of movies have tried to channel that old Seventies sci-fi feeling, and Glazer’s visually sumptuous, genuinely unnerving movie is one of the few that feels as if it actually came from that fertile era of space oddities. But this isn’t the equivalent of, say, one of those 21st century bands that go to great pains to sound like a classic rock group. There’s a sense of exploration in its elliptical storytelling that feels light years ahead of most modern aliens-among-us tales, as well as a handful of images (all those lads slowly sinking into the tarpit muck of her feeding room, the climactic scene that justifies the film’s title) that we still haven’t been able to shake. Like so much of the cerebral S.F. that makes up its list, Under the Skin doesn’t just put a stylish, intellectual spin on the idea of visitors from another solar system. It’s a film that forces you to re-examine your own ideas of what it is to be human. —DF\n\nAfter the crew of the spaceship Nostromo is unexpectedly stirred from stasis before their journey’s scheduled end, they barely wake up before the complaining starts. Like Dark Star (another film with a Dan O’Bannon script credit) before it, Alien offers a vision of interstellar travel that’s more workaday grind than cosmic wonder — until, that is, the crew takes on an unexpected passenger in the form of a parasitic creature. It starts by nesting inside one member before bursting out of his chest; then it slowly, methodically begins picking off the others. Space, it turns out, is not a place removed from Darwinian struggle. The contrast between Alien’s metallic, man-made (if grungy) setting and a xenomorph with a biological imperative to kill is just one element that’s made this Ridley Scott film sear itself into the nightmares of all who see it. (H.R. Giger’s creature design — a disturbing assemblage of bones, goo, and sexual imagery — is another.) Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley begins the film as just one of several characters threatened by the ship’s interloper, by the end of the film, she’d secure her place on any shortlist of sci-fi’s greatest heroes. Life is for the survivors. Even the xenomorphs understand that. —KP\n\nSome aspects of the future according to Ridley Scott’s radical take on a Philip K. Dick short story — about a man named Deckard (Harrison Ford) who hunts down rogue “replicants” in the year 2019 — have not come to pass: Four decades later, Los Angeles has yet to go 100-percent vertical, and artificial intelligence hasn’t come to the point where it wants to kill us (yet). But its vision of a stratified world where tech moguls reach godlike levels of power gets more prescient all the time, and despite the fact that the film was considered D.O.A. upon release, you can see it’s influence on every tech noir film featuring decrepit Art Deco architecture, decadent fashion, and rain hissing on radiant neon that followed. The movie’s reputation from cult film to modern classic has evolved greatly over the years (it’s no longer hard to find someone who can recite Rutger Hauer’s “Tears in the rain” monologue verbatim), with Scott cycling through various versions before landing on a director-approved Final Cut in 2007. Now, in its definitive form, Blade Runner ends on a haunting but strangely hopeful note, finding the human in a post-human world. —KR\n\nIn Steven Spielberg’s first great sci-fi film, music is the universal language, literally. It just takes all kinds of close encounters for Earthlings and extraterrestrials to figure out the five-note musical sequence that humans and E.T.s alike can groove to. But it’s watching everyone’s struggle to figure out how to express themselves with compassion (still the most Spielbergian of themes) which makes the movie great cinema and great fun. Like Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an excitable Indiana electrician investigating power outages. He witnesses a UFO and becomes obsessed with them, as does Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), a Muncie mom whose toddler son is abducted. The United Nations and a group of scientists begin investigating the incidents and stumble on a musical sequence, or “doorbell” as Spielberg has called it, to communicate with the aliens.\n\nThe director, who had been obsessed with space himself since a young age, said he interviewed “airline pilots, air traffic controllers, and housewives,” steering clear of “loonies,” while writing the script, which also drew upon his 1964 film, Firelight, and 1970 short story “Experiences.” He took the idea for the title from astronomer Dr. J. Allen Hynek’s book, The UFO Experience, which defined the first kind of close encounters as feeling the presence of a UFO, the second as seeing a UFO, and the third as interacting with one. The filmmaker ultimately described the film as a “political movie with a science fiction background,” but that’s deceptive since it’s so overwhelmingly joyous. Close Encounters is about harmony — on a human, universal, and musical level, thanks to composer John Williams’ stellar score.\n\nSpielberg told Rolling Stone in 1978 that he originally wanted to end the movie with Jiminy Cricket singing “When You Wish Upon a Star,” but later thought better of it. “I made this movie because of the Disney song,” he said. “That came first, that and the idea of a UFO movie.” After he came to his senses, the film became 1977’s second highest grossing sci-fi movie (after Star Wars) and it garnered eight Oscar noms, including one for Williams’ score; it won one for cinematography. All Spielberg needed was D–E–C–C’–G. —KG\n\n“There’s no telepathy, no ghosts, no flying saucers,” says the Writer, one of three haunted men venturing into “The Zone,” a mysterious realm where the laws of reality bend. No special effects, he might have added. And no action either. At a moment when Hollywood was chasing glimmers of the galaxy far, far away, the Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky (Solaris) went looking for something deeper. Loosely based on the novel Roadside Picnic, his totemic 1979 allegory is basically an anti-space opera: a terrestrial dirge of heady conversation and meditative quiet, filmed across verdant rural stretches and decaying urban corners of Eastern Europe, real places granted the wonder of an alien landscape. While the genre turned towards zippy fun, Tarkovsky chased a heavy, unfashionable science fiction of ideas.\n\nThere’s really no other movie like Stalker, sci-fi or otherwise — though the film’s influence has crept like a fungus, expressed in the stoned rhythm of patient slow-cinema experiments and the plots of spiritually indebted descendants like Annihilation. For all the depth of Tarkovsky’s philosophical inquiry, the emotional thrust of the narrative is simple and direct: that search for meaning and fulfillment in the senseless sprawl of life — a voyage of desire visualized, like Dorothy’s step out of gray, muted Kansas, as a breathtaking tilt from stark sepia tones to a rich celluloid splendor. It envelops you with its mysteries, a Zone whose entrance is always open. —AAD\n\nIt begins at the Dawn of Man and ends with the rebirth of humanity, with Homo sapiens having finally been granted one last evolutionary level-up. In between those two poles of the human experience — one in our prehistoric past, the other light years into our future (hope springs eternal) — Stanley Kubrick give us what still feels like the benchmark for science fiction cinema that engages you in mind, body, and soul. It’s not just that his adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke’s short story “The Sentinel” has become part of our collective consciousness, enough that Barbie could kick off with an extended riff on one of its most famous scenes and everyone got the joke. Or that 2001 contains what may be the single best example of film editing as a communicative art form unto itself. Or that the closest the film has to an antagonist, the self-aware HAL 9000 supercomputer who discovers that machines are no more immune from neurosis and malice than its flesh-and-blood programmers are, is the character we end up feeling the most sympathy towards. “Daissss-yyyy… daisssss-yyyyy…”.\n\nRather, it’s that Kubrick takes his incredible formalistic rigor, his filmmaking chops, and the conventions of a genre, and then applies them to posing a number of existential questions that always have, and probably always will cause us to look heavenward. Why are we here? What purpose do we serve? Who or what is God? Is there intelligent life beyond Earth? Can I, too, turn a bone into a satellite simply by throwing it into the air? The fact the director would force viewers to patiently consider these philosophical concepts while having the audacity to soundtrack docking spaceships with classical waltzes and slyly joking about space being the final corporate marketing frontier is not surprising. That Kubrick was able to do all of this in a popular art form, striking a chord with audiences hungry for heady material, and have it still feel cutting-edge and resonant decades later, is nothing short of divine. It advanced sci-fi movies the same way that the alien beacon advanced our species.\n\nThe wisecrack was always that 2001: A Space Odyssey was exactly like the big, black monolith that connected its eon-spanning chapters: gorgeous, meticulously constructed, inhuman in its perfection and inscrutable in terms of concrete meaning. Conventional wisdom is that it’s actually closer to the Star Child — something that takes the entirety of the universe in and stares at it in awe, reflecting back how far we have come and how far we still have to go. —DF"
