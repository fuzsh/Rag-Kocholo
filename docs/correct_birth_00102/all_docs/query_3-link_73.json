        "text": "Harper was a Conservative candidate. He became the 22nd prime minister of Canada last February 2006 and brought an end to the 13-year liberal government. He is a staunch proponent of social conservativism, smaller government, and laissez-faire capitalism. The Harper administration had a neoconservative mindset that focuses on the enlargement of the military, reduction of taxes and securing of Arctic waters for energy resources. He is credited to steer the Canadian economy through the financial crisis last 2008.\n\nDuring Canada's combat mission in Afghanistan, Stephen took a more hard-line approach to crime and significantly increased the funds for the prison system.\n\nEarnings & Financial Data\n\nDate\n\nCategory\n\nDescription\n\nAmount\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BvsdOwpqusmGS9sLjIraCcoZGjfK61zaKqrZ2iZMC1sc%2BhnKdlmJa%2FsbHRZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D"
