He left Parliament in 1997 to become Vice President (and later President) of the National Citizens Coalition, a prominent Canadian advocacy organization. In 2002, he became Leader of the Opposition after winning the leadership of the Canadian Alliance and a subsequent by-election in Calgary Southwest.\n\nIn 2003, Mr. Harper co-founded the Conservative Party of Canada and went on to contest and win the new partys leadership.\n\nAs Conservative leader, Mr. Harper ran in the 2004 federal election and increased the Conservatives standing in the House of Commons by 25 seats, including an important breakthrough in Ontario. On January 23, 2006, Mr. Harper led the Conservative Party to power by winning 124 seats in Canadas 39th federal election.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Mr. Harper is committed to building a Canada that remains strong, united, independent and free. He is committed to enacting accountability measures for government, lowering taxes for working families, reforming the criminal justice system, helping parents cope with the costs of child care and negotiating a patient wait times guarantee with the provinces.\n\nStephen Harper was born on April 30, 1959, in Toronto, Ontario. He moved to Alberta in 1978 to work in the petroleum industry and went on to obtain both a bachelors and a masters degree in economics from the University of Calgary.\n\nMr. Harper and his wife, Laureen (Teskey) Harper, have two children, Benjamin and Rachel, and maintain a permanent home in Calgary.\n\nReturn to regular web page:\n\nhttp://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/default.asp?Language=E&Page=primeminister&doc=bio_e.htm"
