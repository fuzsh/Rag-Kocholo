        "text": "Canadian Federal Election of 2008\n\nOn October 14, 2008, Canadians voted to return Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party to power, though again without a parliamentary majority. The Conservatives captured 143 seats (a gain of 19) while tallying more than 37 percent of the popular vote. The Liberal Party, led by Stéphane Dion, trailed by as much 17 percent in some polls at the beginning of the election, and, though it closed that gap slightly during the campaign, it fell to a total of 76 seats (27 fewer than in the 2006 election) and garnered its lowest percentage of the popular vote (just over 26 percent) in the history of the party. Harper had pinned much of his hope of attaining a majority on the prospect of gains in Quebec, but the sovereignist Bloc Québécois, under the leadership of Gilles Duceppe, held steady there, winning 50 seats, just one fewer than it had captured in the 2006 election, and registering 10 percent of the national popular vote. The socialist New Democratic Party, led by Jack Layton, added 8 seats to its 2006 total to reach 37 seats. The environmentalist Green Party failed to win representation, even though Dion had agreed not to run a candidate against its party leader, Elizabeth May, who still finished second to the incumbent Conservative in her riding in Nova Scotia. The turnout nationwide, just over 59 percent of eligible voters, was the lowest in Canadian history, falling just short of the 60 percent turnout recorded in the 2004 federal election.\n\nThe 2008 election, the third in four years for Canada, called by Harper on September 7, came just as the country was beginning to feel the effects of a crisis shaking the U.S. economy. Central issues included taxation and the environment; the role of the Canadian military in Afghanistan, funding for the arts, and sociocultural wedge issues were also in play. Harper, who had come to power in 2006 after 13 years of rule by the Liberal Party, made no secret of his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol. He staunchly opposed as economically damaging the carbon tax on greenhouse gas emissions that was the linchpin of the Green Shift platform proposed by the Liberal Party.\n\nParties and Leaders\n\nConservative Party of Canada\n\n2008 Percentage of Votes: 37.6 (+1.3)\n\n2008 Number of Seats (of 308): 143 (+19)\n\nLeader: Stephen Harper\n\nBorn: April 30, 1959, Toronto, Ont.\n\nEducation: University of Calgary (B.A., 1985; M.A., 1991)\n\nSpouse: Laureen Harper\n\nChildren: 2 (Ben and Rachel)\n\nPolitical Experience: Prime minister, 2006–present; leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, 2004–present; leader of the Canadian Alliance, 2002–03; House of Commons, 1993–97 (Calgary West, Alta.) and 2002–present (Calgary Southwest, Alta.)\n\nLiberal Party of Canada\n\n2008 Percentage of Votes: 26.2 (−4.0)\n\n2008 Number of Seats (of 308): 76 (−27)\n\nLeader: Stéphane Dion\n\nBorn: Sept. 28, 1955, Quebec city, Que.\n\nEducation: Laval University (B.A., 1977; M.A., 1979); Institute of Political Studies, Paris (Ph.D., 1986)\n\nSpouse: Janine Krieber\n\nChildren: 1 (Jeanne)\n\nPolitical Experience: Leader of the Liberal Party, 2007–present; minister of the environment, 2004–06; minister of intergovernmental affairs, 1996–2003; House of Commons, 1996–present (Saint-Laurent–Cartierville, Que.)\n\nNew Democratic Party\n\n2008 Percentage of Votes: 18.2 (+0.7)\n\n2008 Number of Seats (of 308): 37 (+8)\n\nLeader: Jack Layton\n\nBorn: July 18, 1950, Hudson, Que.\n\nEducation: McGill University (B.A., 1970); York University (M.A., 1972; Ph.D., 1983)\n\nSpouse: Olivia Chow\n\nChildren: None\n\nPolitical Experience: Leader of the New Democratic Party, 2003–present; House of Commons, 2004–present (Toronto-Danforth, Ont.); Toronto city councillor, 1982–2003\n\nBloc Québécois\n\n2008 Percentage of Votes: 10.0 (−0.5)\n\n2008 Number of Seats (of 308): 50 (−1)\n\nLeader: Gilles Duceppe\n\nBorn: July 22, 1947, Montreal, Que.\n\nEducation: University of Montreal\n\nSpouse: Yolande Brunelle\n\nChildren: 2 (Alexis and Amélie)\n\nPolitical Experience: Leader of the Bloc Québécois, 1997–present; House of Commons, 1990–present (Laurier–Sainte-Marie, Que.)\n\nGreen Party of Canada\n\n2008 Percentage of Votes: 6.8 (+0.2)\n\n2008 Number of Seats (of 308): 0 (no change)\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Farr, professor emeritus of history, Carleton University, originally appeared in the Britannica Book of the Year (2007).\n\nIn 2006 Canada gained a new Conservative government and a new prime minister, Stephen Harper, who had come to power gradually through two elections—in June 2004 and January 2006. In late 2003 Harper had successfully led the merger of two groups, his own Alliance Party and the historic Progressive Conservative Party, to form the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC), which chose him as party leader. In the 2004 general election, the new party did well enough to reduce the ruling Liberal Party to a minority government under a new prime minister, Paul Martin; then in 2006 the Conservatives replaced the Liberals at the head of another minority government.\n\nIn the 2006 campaign the CPC stressed traditional conservative principles: sound management of the country’s finances, the need to eliminate deficits, accountability in government operations, reduction in taxation, and legislation to protect marriage and the family. It promised a national child-care program and favoured larger spending on the military, increased foreign aid, and the protection of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty. The Liberals put forward similar policies, some of which they had already begun to implement since the 2004 election. In the minds of many Canadians, however, their program was overshadowed by a political scandal in Quebec that displayed gross irregularities in the party’s spending of public funds. A judicial inquiry in the later months of 2005 confirmed the malpractice, which extended to political figures, public servants, and the executives of advertising companies. Campaigning revealed a countrywide impression that the Liberals, in office since 1993, had been in power too long. Their prospects were especially doubtful in Quebec, where the political scandal turned voters away.\n\nThe results of the January 23 election showed that the Liberals and Conservatives had changed places in Parliament. After a former Liberal cabinet minister announced that he was switching parties to take a post in the new government, the CPC finished with 125 of the 308 seats in the Commons, a gain of 26, while the Liberals were reduced to 102 seats, a loss of 33. The socialist New Democratic Party won 10 additional seats for a total of 29. The most significant changes occurred in Quebec, where the separatist Bloc Québécois won 51 of the 75 seats; the Liberals suffered a severe reversal, dropping from 21 seats to 13; and the CPC, which was without a Quebec seat before the election, won 10 ridings, a result that no one had predicted. Although the Conservative support was basically in the four Western provinces, the party also improved its standing in Ontario to 40 seats from a previous 24. A distinctive result of the vote was the fact that the Conservatives elected no MPs from Canada’s three largest cities: Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\n\nMartin immediately tendered his resignation as prime minister. The new Conservative government was sworn into office on February 6. Harper’s cabinet of 26 members included 9 ministers who hailed from the four Western provinces, 9 from Ontario, and 5 from Quebec. The principal posts of foreign minister and finance minister were given to Peter MacKay (of Nova Scotia) and James Flaherty (Ontario), respectively.\n\nDay by Day\n\n2006\n\nJanuary 23, 2006\n\nIn parliamentary elections in Canada, the Conservative Party wins narrowly; the following day Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper is asked to form a government.\n\nFebruary 6, 2006\n\nStephen Harper takes office as prime minister of Canada.\n\nFebruary 7, 2006\n\nPremier Gordon Campbell of British Columbia announces the creation of the 6.4-million-hectare (16-million-acre) Great Bear Rain Forest preserve in the Canadian province; the preserve will include a protected area and an area to be logged under a management plan.\n\nMarch 2, 2006\n\nCanada’s Supreme Court rules against a school board that forbade the wearing of the kirpan, or ceremonial dagger, by Sikh schoolboys; Sikhism requires men to wear the kirpan at all times.\n\nApril 7, 2006\n\nThe Canadian government agency Statistics Canada reports that the country’s unemployment rate fell to 6.3 percent, its lowest level in 32 years, and that its employment rate reached a record 62.9 percent.\n\nApril 21, 2006\n\nIn a land dispute with the Canadian government, Mohawks from the Six Nations block traffic on a highway and block a railway in western Ontario.\n\nApril 27, 2006\n\nThe United States and Canada reach an agreement on Canadian softwood lumber imported into the United States that eliminates all quotas and tariffs but allows Canada to collect export taxes from producers under certain market conditions; the agreement ends a dispute that lasted more than 20 years.\n\nMay 10, 2006\n\nTurkey, which has already recalled its ambassador from Canada, declines to participate in a NATO military exercise in Canada; the moves are a response to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s referring to the World War I killing of Armenians as a genocide.\n\nMay 29, 2006\n\nAn unexpected strike by public transit workers in Toronto leaves some 800,000 commuters scrambling to find another way to work and other destinations.\n\nJune 3, 2006\n\nPolice in Canada report that they have arrested 17 people whom they believe were plotting to use powerful fertilizer bombs against targets in southern Ontario.\n\nOctober 24, 2006\n\nJustice Douglas Rutherford of the Ontario Superior Court rules that the definition of terrorism in Canada’s antiterrorism laws passed after the September 11 terror attacks of 2001 is impermissible.\n\nNovember 27, 2006\n\nCanada’s legislature passes a motion introduced by Prime Minister Stephen Harper that recognizes French-speaking people of Quebec as a nation within Canada; the motion makes no changes to laws or to the constitution.\n\nDecember 6, 2006\n\nGiuliano Zaccardelli resigns as commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a situation where—because of false information from the RCMP, which has been accused of other wrongdoing as well—Maher Arer, an innocent man, was arrested in the United States and deported to Syria, where he was jailed and tortured.\n\n2007\n\nFebruary 23, 2007\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada strikes down a law permitting the indefinite detention of foreign-born terrorism suspects; the ruling is suspended for a year so that Parliament may draft a law consistent with the ruling.\n\nApril 8, 2007\n\nSix NATO soldiers, all of them Canadian, are killed by a roadside bomb near Kandahār, Afghanistan.\n\nApril 26, 2007\n\nCanada announces a plan by which industries are required to reduce their rate of production of greenhouse gases by 18 percent over the next three years, a rate well short of the goals of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change but one that industries say they will be hard put to meet.\n\nMay 8, 2007\n\nAndré Boisclair resigns as leader of the separatist Parti Québécois in the Canadian province of Quebec after the party’s disappointing third-place showing in provincial elections in March.\n\nJuly 9, 2007\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announces that the country will buy patrol ships to assert the country’s claim to the Northwest Passage; many believe that continued global warming could make possible its being turned into a major shipping channel.\n\nAugust 10, 2007\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announces that the country will build two new military bases in Nunavut, one in Nanisivik and one in Resolute Bay, in order to protect its claims to the Northwest Passage.\n\nAugust 20, 2007\n\nU.S. Pres.
