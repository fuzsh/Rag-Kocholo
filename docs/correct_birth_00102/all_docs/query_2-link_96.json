        "text": "What is more Canadian than throwing a leg over a snowmobile and tearing it up the trails? (If you say, “hockey,” then you’ve come to the wrong website.) In February 2015, Canada’s Prime Minister, the Honourable Stephen Harper, did just that while he was visiting Quebec City for the annual Carnival de Quebec.\n\nMr. Harper was accompanied by fellow members of parliament: Denis Lebel, Steven Blaney and Jacques Gourde. Serge Ritcher and other executive members of Quebec’s provincial association of snowmobile clubs, the FCMQ, hosted the snowmobile ride and reportedly made the day a success.\n\nHere’s the video of Mr. Harper snowmobiling:\n\nTouted as the largest winter carnival in the world, the Carnival de Quebec is a two-week-long event that attracts close to 600,000 attendees. It was started in 1853 and since then, it has grown to include everything from snow sculpting and parades to horse-drawn sleigh rides and ice canoe races.\n\nA key figure at the carnival is Bonhomme Carnaval, a living replica of a snowman. He was also there to greet Mr. Harper on his snowmobile ride."
