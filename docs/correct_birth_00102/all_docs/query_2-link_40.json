He served as the 22nd prime minister of Canada from 2006 to 2015.\n\nMr. Harper met with Elder Randall K. Bennett of the North America Central Area Presidency and Elder Mathias Held of the North America Northeast Area Presidency, both of whom have ecclesiastical responsibility for part of Canada. \n\nThe group toured Temple Square and were treated to a  demonstration of the organ in the Conference Center by Richard Elliott, who accompanies the world-famous Tabernacle Choir. \nThe former prime minister learned more about the Church’s humanitarian efforts worldwide and in Canada. He also visited the FamilySearch Library, where he was able to view some records of his ancestors and received a copy of his family tree.\n\n“It was an honor to visit with Former Prime Minister Harper,” Elder Bennett said. “As native Canadians, my wife and I sensed that he always cared about his citizens. I appreciated our discussion about our shared interests, including the importance of family and our humanitarian efforts in his country and around the world.”\n\n“We enjoyed meeting with Mr. Harper and telling him more about our faith and the Latter-day Saints in Canada,” Elder Held said. “The Church has a long history in Canada and we are grateful to be able to contribute to that wonderful country.”\n\nThis was Mr. Harper’s first visit to Salt Lake City and he said he was impressed with the Church’s efforts and the warm welcome he received. \n\n“It was a pleasure to spend time with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints leadership during my visit to Salt Lake City, and to visit Temple Square and the incredible Conference Centre,” he said. “In particular I was struck by the breadth and depth of the Church’s humanitarian work globally. These efforts are making a tremendous difference in the lives of millions of people.”\".",
