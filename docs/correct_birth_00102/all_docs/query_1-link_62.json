        "text": "With Stephen Harper now Canada’s prime minister, this book is rather\n\nfrightening. Canadians have a leader who opposed official bilingualism,\n\ndismissed Canadian culture as an eccentricity of a Southern Ontario\n\nelite, criticized Canada’s social programs as disincentives to finding\n\nreal jobs, and would render Canada ungovernable. The Triple-E Senate\n\nwould, like its U.S. counterpart, be dominated by the wealthy and their\n\nsupporters—the only people who could afford most province-wide\n\nraces—and would kill legislation from the House of Commons. Harper\n\ncomplained about the transfer of revenue from Alberta to the rest of\n\nCanada, but failed to mention that other Canadians assisted Albertans\n\nduring the Depression and paid inflated prices for Alberta oil from the\n\nDiefenbaker era until 1973.\n\nWilliam Johnson’s admiration for Harper is rather surprising given\n\nthat Johnson has been a strong advocate for Anglo rights in Quebec.\n\nHarper wanted to “Let Quebec be Quebec. Let the West be the West”:\n\nin other words, let Quebec be exclusively French-speaking, the West\n\nexclusively English-speaking. He also criticized Sir John A. Macdonald\n\nand Pierre Trudeau for attempts to make Canada economically\n\nself-sufficient. The Prime Minister lacks any sense of Canadian\n\nidentity.\n\nHarper broke with Mulroney because Mulroney failed to avoid deficits\n\nand was too friendly with such Quebec nationalists as Lucien Bouchard\n\nand René Lévesque. “The Reform Party doesn’t support separatists,\n\nunlike Tories,” he said. Will his opposition to deficits survive the\n\ncut to the GST and the transfer of revenue to the provinces? Will his\n\nopposition to separatists survive his need for Bloc support in the House\n\nof Commons? On daycare, he has been consistent: “There is no place for\n\nbureaucrats in the raising of our children,” he says. What are his\n\nthoughts on public education?\n\nHarper wanted to send Canadian soldiers to Iraq. He opposes the Kyoto\n\nProtocol. His party favoured a referendum on capital punishment. Yet the\n\ncover boasts that Harper “was ... usually on ... the correct side of\n\nthe big issues.” What does this say about Johnson?"
