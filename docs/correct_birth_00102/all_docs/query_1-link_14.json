His family is deeply rooted in today's New Brunswick, his oldest ancestors are from Yorkshire, England. He was the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nEarly Life\n\nStephen Harper grew up in the Toronto neighbourhood of Leaside.[1] In his schooltime he was a member of the Young Liberal club.[2] After graduating he started to study at Toronto's Trinity College, but dropped out after a short time. He moved to Alberta and worked as a mail clerk for Imperial Oil. After three years he started to study Economics in Calgary. In 1991, he earned a Masters degree in Economics. [2]\n\nPrivate life\n\nStephen Harper married his wife in 1993, they are parents of two children.[2]\n\nHe is a huge ice hockey fan, especially of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Calgary Flames. He wrote a book about the history of ice hockey, focusing on ice hockey in Ontario.[1]\n\nPolitical Life\n\nHis political involvement started as a member of the Young Liberal Club. When he disagreed with a decision of Pierre Trudeau's government, he changed allegiance and became a Conservative. In the 1990s, there were several Conservative Parties, and this division, according to Harper, made it possible that the Liberals could maintain in Government.[1]\n\nIn 1993, he won a seat in the House of Commons. In 1997, he decided not to run again for a seat but worked for a conservative think tank. In 2002, he was elected leader of the Canadian Alliance,[1] which was at that time one of two big Conservative parties. A few years later, the Canadian Alliance merged with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, forming the Conservative Party, of which Stephen Harper became the first elected leader.[3] After the 2004 Federal Election, Harper was the opposition leader in the Parliament. Following the Adscam-scandal, the Conservatives attempted to bring down Paul Martin's government, but failed. However, in November 2005, a motion of no confidence was passed by the House of Commons, forcing a new Federal Election in January 2006.[4]\n\nPrime Minister\n\nAlthough the Conservatives didn't win the majority of votes in the 2006 Federal Election, they were able to form a minority government. That way Harper became Prime Minister.[1] He was the first Westerner in over 25 years to lead a government.[2] He got the mandate to form the government three times, in 2006, 2008 and 2011, even though the Conservatives only once, in 2011, got the majority of seats.[2] After nine years in the government, there was a growing sentiment for change during the election campaign, which eventually Justin Trudeau converted into a victory at the 2015 Federal Election.[2] After 2015, he kept a low profile as a Member of Parliament, resigning in August 2016.[2]\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Wikipedia:Stephen Harper\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 Mcintosh, Andrew; The Canadian Encyclopedia; Stephen Harper, 2 January 2020\n\n↑ Wikipedia:Conservative Party of Canada\n\n↑ Wikipedia:2006 Canadian federal election\n\nWikidata: Item Q206\n\nOnly the Trusted List can access the following:\n\nStephen's formal name\n\nfull middle name (J.)\n\nexact birthdate\n\nbirth location\n\nimages (2)\n\nprivate children's names (2)\n\nspouse's name and marriage information\n\nFor access to Stephen Harper's full information you must be on the Trusted List.
