He was also critical of the federal response to Quebec separatism.\n\nIn 2002, Harper was elected leader of the Canadian Alliance and returned to Parliament as the MP for the Calgary Southwest.\n\nHe opposed special status for the province in the Canadian Constitution, endorsed greater provincial autonomy on Medicare, argued for “parental rights” to use corporal punishment against their children, and supported raising the age of sexual consent.\n\nWhile some of his political opinions were heavily criticized, Harper continued with his endeavor and condemned the Canadian government’s unwillingness to participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nDuring the Conservative Party leadership in 2004, Harper was elected the first leader along with 99 seats in the House of Commons.\n\nHis party opposed same-sex marriage and vehemently declared the liberal government’s incompetence, hence introducing a motion of no confidence by winning 171-133.\n\nAs a result, Parliament was dissolved, and a general election was scheduled for January 23, 2006.\n\nTHE PRIME MINISTER\n\nIn January 2006, the Conservatives won more than 36% of the national vote and took 124 seats in the House of Commons.\n\nStephen Harper became the 22nd prime minister of Canada, leading a minority government.\n\nHe then committed his services based on four pillars: accountability, security, environmental protection, and strong economic management.\n\nUnder his administration, the following were proposed:\n\nThe Clean Air Act – setting guidelines meeting emissions goals as an alternative for dealing with climate change.\n\nCanada’s sovereignty over Arctic waters – access to potential petroleum resources in the Arctic seabed.\n\nWithdrawal of Canadian troops in Afghanistan.\n\nFormal apology for the treatment of indigenous peoples in residential schools by forcing the children to assimilate into Canadian society.\n\nPushing the recognition of the Québécois as a nation.\n\nReduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to 5% from seven and lowered Canada’s corporate and small-business tax rate during his tenure.\n\nSucceeded in raising the age of sexual consent in 2008 to 16 from 14.\n\nHe was also among the most vocal opponents of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggressions in Ukraine.\n\nHarper launched the Muskoka Initiative at the G8 summit in 2010. It committed member nations to spend billions to help reduce the number of mothers and children who die in developing countries each year.\n\nHe also supported Israel in its campaign against terrorism and disputes.\n\nHarper froze MP and senator salaries between 2010-2012, including his prime ministerial salary in the wake of deficit spending.\n\nHarper’s government pushed Parliament to strengthen antiterrorism legislation with the passage of Bill C-51 – authorizing the sharing of private information between 17 government organizations and including the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) for preventive actions.\n\nIn the 2015 election, despite Harper’s efforts to campaign listing his achievements, the liberals garnered 39.5% of the vote and formed a 184-seat majority government with Trudeau as prime minister.\n\nStephen Harper Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the Stephen Harper across 23 in-depth pages.
