        "text": "Former Canada prime minister Stephen Harper visited the world headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on May 23, 2024. Harper was in Salt Lake City, Utah, to speak at the Crossroads of the World international trade conference and took the opportunity to learn more about the Church. He served as the 22nd prime minister of Canada from 2006 to 2015.\n\nHarper met with Elder Randall K. Bennett of the North America Central Area presidency and Elder Mathias Held of the North America Northeast Area presidency, who have ecclesiastical responsibility for part of Canada.\n\nThe group toured Temple Square and was treated to an organ demonstration in the Conference Center by Richard Elliott, who accompanies the world-famous Tabernacle Choir.\n\nHarper learned more about the Church’s humanitarian efforts worldwide and in Canada. He also visited the FamilySearch Library, where he viewed some records of his ancestors and received a copy of his family tree.\n\n“It was an honour to visit with former prime minister Harper,” Elder Bennett said. “As native Canadians, my wife and I sensed that he always cared about his citizens. I appreciated our discussion about our shared interests, including the importance of family and our humanitarian efforts in his country and around the world.”\n\n“We enjoyed meeting with Mr. Harper and telling him more about our faith and the Latter-day Saints in Canada,” Elder Held said. “The Church has a long history in Canada, and we are grateful to be able to contribute to that wonderful country.”\n\nThis was Harper’s first visit to Salt Lake City. He was impressed with the Church’s efforts and the warm welcome he received. “It was a pleasure to spend time with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' leadership during my visit to Salt Lake City and to visit Temple Square and the incredible Conference Center,” he said. “In particular, I was struck by the breadth and depth of the Church’s humanitarian work globally. These efforts are making a tremendous difference in the lives of millions of people.”"
