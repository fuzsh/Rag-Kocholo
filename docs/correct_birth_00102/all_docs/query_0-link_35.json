But according to Globe writer John Ibbitson, the election results are moot... at least when it comes Stephen Harper's legacy.\n\n\"Harper would never forget the Liberal tactics. And he learned a lesson: the best way to protect yourself against a low blow is to land your own first.\"- John Ibbitson on the 2000 Liberal campaign, from Stephen Harper biography\n\nToday we hear about a new biography that details how Mr. Harper has re-shaped Canada in irreversible ways during his near decade in power -- from the size of the federal government's footprint at home to its imprint on the world stage.\n\nJohn Ibbitson is writer-at-large for The Globe and Mail and author of a new biography about the Conservative Leader titled simply, \"Stephen Harper.\" He joined us from Ottawa.\n\n\"It remains an unalterable fact that the face of the Harper government is Stephen Harper's face. That face is stern and cold. It is also intelligent and perceptive. Yes, it can be cruel, but I do not believe that Stephen Harper is at his core, a cruel man. Just a very tough one.- John Ibbitson, from Stephen Harper biography\n\nDo you think Stephen Harper has changed Canada in irreversible ways? And if so... do you like the changes you see?\n\nTweet us @TheCurrentCBC. Find us on Facebook. Or email us from our website.\n\nThis segment was produced by The Current's Idella Sturino."
