        "text": "Is Stephen Harper a racist?\n\nYou could make a compelling argument.\n\nHarassing minorities. Dropping lines about “old stock Canadians”. Suggesting families fleeing war zones could be free loaders.\n\nEven the directors of Conservative riding associations are ripping up their party memberships and accusing Harper of making Canada “less welcoming” and “borderline xenophobic.”\n\nIt looks ugly.\n\nBut is this Harper’s long repressed beliefs bubbling to the surface or is it the art of misdirection?\n\nIn September, word leaked that Harper hired Australian-born political consultant Lynton Crosby to help his struggling campaign, someone the Canadian Press credits as the “master” of racist code words.\n\nHere is how Boris Johnson, mayor of the City of London, describes Crosby’s so-called “dead cat strategy,” a way of getting yourself out of a “losing” situation by doing something so off-the-wall bazonkers, it forces everyone to talk about that instead:\n\n“Let us suppose you are losing an argument. The facts are overwhelmingly against you, and the more people focus on the reality the worse it is for you and your case. Your best bet in these circumstances is to perform a manoeuvre that a great campaigner describes as “throwing a dead cat on the table, mate”.\n\nThat is because there is one thing that is absolutely certain about throwing a dead cat on the dining room table – and I don’t mean that people will be outraged, alarmed, disgusted. That is true, but irrelevant. The key point, says my Australian friend, is that everyone will shout “Jeez, mate, there’s a dead cat on the table!”; in other words they will be talking about the dead cat, the thing you want them to talk about, and they will not be talking about the issue that has been causing you so much grief.”"
