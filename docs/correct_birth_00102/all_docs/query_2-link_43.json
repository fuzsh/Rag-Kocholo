        "text": "\"We should have been there shoulder to shoulder with our allies. Our concern is the instability of our government as an ally. We are playing again with national and global security matters.\" - Canadian Press Newswire, April 11, 2003\n\n\"On the justification for the war, it wasn't related to finding any particular weapon of mass destruction. In our judgment, it was much more fundamental. It was the removing of a regime that was hostile, that clearly had the intention of constructing weapons systems. I think, frankly, that everybody knew the post-war situation was probably going to be more difficult than the war itself. Canada remains alienated from its allies, shut out of the reconstruction process to some degree, unable to influence events. There is no upside to the position Canada took.\" - Macleans, August, 25, 2003\n\n\" This party will not take its position based on public opinion polls. We will not take a stand based on focus groups. We will not take a stand based on phone-in shows or householder surveys or any other vagaries of public opinion In my judgment Canada will eventually join with the allied coalition if war on Iraq comes to pass. The government will join, notwithstanding its failure to prepare, its neglect in co-operating with its allies, or its inability to contribute. In the end it will join out of the necessity created by a pattern of uncertainty and indecision. It will not join as a leader but unnoticed at the back of the parade.\" - Hansard, January 29, 2003\n\n\"When it comes to issues of this country's vital security and national defence, you don't put that to the United Nations, which, quite frankly, is a coalition of everybodythe good, bad and ugly,\" (Stephen Harper, Toronto Star, February 28, 2004)\n\n\"I believe that all taxes are bad.\" - CTV.ca news, December 1, 2005, \"Tory tax cut promise dominates campaign\"\n\n\"I will strive to make this not the highest-spending country in the world, but instead the lowest taxing one.\" (Stephen Harper, Conservative Leadership Convention, March 19, 2004)\n\n\"Kyoto is essentially a socialist scheme to suck money out of wealth-producing nations.\" - The Star, January 30, 2007\n\nLets forget about this unworkable treaty . Kyotos never going to be passed. (Stephen Harper, Toronto Star, June 10, 2004)\n\nMy partys position on the Kyoto Protocol is clear and has been for a long time. We will oppose ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and its targets. We will work with the provinces and others to discourage the implementation of those targets. And we will rescind the targets when we have the opportunity to do so. (Stephen Harper, Ottawa Citizen, November 22, 2002)\n\nNo, what I am supportive of is, frankly, not ratifying the Kyoto agreement and not implementing it. (Stephen Harper, CTV News, September 6, 2002)\n\nKyoto [is] the worst international agreement this country has ever signed and I don't think they have the guts to implement it because it would have severe impacts on the economy and on the ordinary people from coast-to-coast. (Stephen Harper, CTV News, September 4, 2002)\n\nWhen Harper was asked in a news conference how he can reconcile using the courtson the one handto oppose a bill passed by Parliament [Gag Law  3rd party election spending]; and then making the case that the courts have had too much say on the same-sex issue, he said: Well quite easily, because the right of free speech and right of religion are in the constitution. Sexual orientation is not. (Stephen Harper, CBC Newsworld, September 4, 2003)\n\nThe Liberals may blather about protecting cultural minorities, but the fact is that undermining the traditional definition of marriage is an assault on multiculturalism and the practices in those communities. (Stephen Harper, Hansard, February 18, 2005)\n\nLiberals may talk about minorities. But undermining the traditional definition of marriage is an assault on the beliefs of all cultural and religious communities who have come to this country.'' (Stephen Harper, Canadian Press, April 9, 2005)\n\nI'm telling you, what I'm telling you is I don't see [the notwithstanding clause] as an issue here. The issue is simple. Which definition of marriage does Parliament want to enact, and I don't think that's, I don't think it's a complicated legal question, I think it's a simple act of political judgment and will. (Stephen Harper, CTV Question Period, December 26, 2004)\n\nI do not support the special legal recognition of same-sex relationships, the compulsory provision of marital benefits to same sex couples, or a number of other possible implications of such legislation. (Stephen Harper, Letter to the Editor, Calgary Herald, December 14, 1994)\n\nHarper has said he opposes a new deal for municipalities: That the federal government should have its own \"New Deal\" with municipalities is not a view I would subscribe to. (Stephen Harper, Report Newsmagazine, June 24, 2003)\n\nIf Ottawa begins transferring cash directly to municipalities dont be surprised to see \"national standards\" and other mandates imposed on cities in pretty short order. (Stephen Harper, Address to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, June 2, 2003)\n\n[W]hat we clearly need is experimentation - with market reforms and private delivery options within the public system. And it is only logical that, in a federal state where the provinces operate the public health care systems and regulate private services, that experimentation should occur at the provincial level. (Stephen Harper, Speech in Charlottetown, June 27, 2001)\n\n\"One of the things that we suggested specifically was that the Alberta Government take on the Canada Health Act.\" (Stephen Harper, CBC Newsworld, December 4, 2001)\n\nMonopolies in the public sector are just as objectionable as monopolies in the private sector. It should not matter who delivers health care, whether it is private, for profit, not for profit or public institutions, as long as Canadians have access to it regardless of their financial means. (Stephen Harper, Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne, Oct. 1, 2002)\n\nHarper also believes that our health care will continue to deteriorate unless Ottawa overhauls the Canada Health Act to allow the provinces to experiment with market reforms and private health care delivery options. He is prepared to take tough positions including experimenting with private delivery in the public system. (Stephen Harper, Leadership Campaign Policy Statement, www.harperforleader.com, February 2002)\n\nSo why is the federal government going to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to run an inquiry into the health care system? The answer is likely so that it can insist upon finding a \"national solution\" - precisely the opposite of what the system needs. Given such a challenge, what we clearly need is experimentation - with market reforms and private delivery options within the public system. And it is only logical that, in a federal state where the provinces operate the public health care systems and regulate private services, that experimentation should occur at the provincial level. (Speech in Charlottetown, June 27, 2001)\n\nWe do not think this government or any government should be in charge of raising our children. We see what happens over there when government is in charge of raising children. (Stephen Harper, Hansard, October 6, 2004)\n\n[T]he solution that we need to this problem is not a high spending solution, it's a low-tax solution I believe it involves giving money directly to parents to make child care choices and not creating expensive bureaucracies that are subjected to inter-government wrangling.'' (Stephen Harper, Canadian Press, February 11, 2005)\n\nThese proposals included cries for billions of new money for social assistance in the name of child poverty and for more business subsidies in the name of cultural identity. In both cases I was sought out as a rare public figure to oppose such projects. (Stephen Harper, The Bulldog, National Citizens Coalition, February 1997)\n\n[T]his country cannot enhance its cherished place in this world by losing its special position on this continent. We cannot let our military sovereignty in NORAD wither away. We cannot watch our economic security in NAFTA weaken. So I tell you that on our common interests with the United States, including on missile defence, our Conservative government will take Canada back to the table. (Stephen Harper, 2005 Conservative Convention Speech Speaking Notes, March 18, 2005)\n\n we must take seriously our own and continental security, rather than just push the entire burden on to the United States. We need to engage actively in the continental missile defence program to ensure Canada has a voice in its own air security. (Stephen Harper, National Post, May 23, 2003)\n\nAfter all, enforced national bilingualism in this country isnt mere policy. It has attained the status of a religion. Its a dogma which one is supposed to accept without question. [M]ake no mistake. Canada is not a bilingual country. In fact it is less bilingual today than it has ever been...As a religion, bilingualism is the god that failed. It has led to no fairness, produced no unity, and cost Canadian taxpayers untold millions. (Stephen Harper, Calgary Sun, May 6, 2001)\n\n\"Human rights commissions, as they are evolving, are an attack on our fundamental freedoms and the basic existence of a democratic society It is in fact totalitarianism. I find this is very scary stuff.\" (Stephen Harper, BC Report, January 11, 1999)\n\n\"Universality has been severely reduced: it is virtually dead as a concept in most areas of public policy These achievements are due in part to the Reform Party  (Stephen Harper, Speech to the Colin Brown Memorial Dinner, National Citizens Coalition, 1994)\n\n\"It's actually not a label I love I am more comfortable with a more populist tradition of conservatism. Toryism has the historical context of hierarchy and elitism and is a different kind of political philosophy. It's not my favourite term, but we're probably stuck with it.\" (Stephen Harper, Hamilton Spectator, January 24, 2004)\n\nBut I'm very libertarian in the sense that I believe in small government and, as a general rule, I don't believe in imposing values upon people. (Stephen Harper, National Post, March 6, 2004)\n\nEconomic conservatism, Harper says during an interview in his Calgary office, is libertarian in nature, emphasizing markets and choice. Libertarian conservatives work to dismantle the remaining elements of the interventionist state and move towards a market society for the 21st century. (Stephen Harper, Toronto Star, April 6, 1997)\n\n\"Youve got to remember that west of Winnipeg the ridings the Liberals hold are dominated by people who are either recent Asian immigrants or recent migrants from eastern Canada: people who live in ghettoes and who are not integrated into western Canadian society.\" (Stephen Harper, The Report newsmagazine, January 22, 2001)\n\n\"I think people should elect a cat person. If you elect a dog person, you elect someone who wants to be loved. If you elect a cat person, you elect someone who wants to serve.\" (Stephen Harper, Interview with Kevin Newman, Global National April 5th, 2006)\n\nUpdate May 2011"
