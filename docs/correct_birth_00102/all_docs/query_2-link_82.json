        "text": "The prime minister has a significant amount of power within the Canadian government. Some of the sources of the prime minister’s powers are the number of seats in the House of Commons he and his party has, his ability to give push/give priority to certain government agendas, and his ability to appoint different governmental positions. For a politician to hold the office of PM his party must hold the majority of the seats in the house; this means that by convention his party must be in solidarity with his decisions, which gives the PM’s the loyal support of his party. Another power of the PM is the ability to put forward government agendas that they believe should be prioritized. The PM also has the ability to appoint people who they believe\n\n“The choice, however, is as clear now for nations as it was once for the individual: peace or extinction. ” 1 and Lester B. Pearson was definitely a man of peace. To those who don’t know who Lester B. Pearson is, he’s the fourteenth Prime Minister of Canada, that served from April 22. 1963 - April 20. 1968 2. During his time as Prime Minister, he’s accomplished many things, and that’s why I believe that Lester B. Pearson is the greatest Canadian.\n\nMany great people and many great things shape history to what it is today. An example would be Adolf Hitler. Hitler was a great man but that does not mean what he did was essentially a great thing. Hitler helped in shaping the world’s history by causing World War 2. He was trying to shape the future as well because he wanted Germans to be the superior race. However there are good people who did good things to shape history. One specific person that comes to mind is Lester Bowles Pearson. He did not shape the world’s history but he did shape Canada’s history; he made Canada to what it is today, he introduced Universal Medicare to all Canadians, and he created the United Nations peacekeeping force.\n\nPierre Trudeau was the 15th prime minister of Canada. During his time as prime minister he changed a lot of Canadians lives for the better. He also, made history that will never be forgotten by past, present and future Canadians. Pierre Trudeau kept Canada united, avoiding Quebec to separate from Canada. Trudeau passed many the “Official Language Act” in 1969 making English and French Canada’s official languages. This act made government workers to offer services in both English and French. Trudeau passed many bills and acts, which adequately helped Canada to develop more as a nation. He abolished the death penalty in 1976 which didn’t make people die for the crimes they did or did not commit. He strengthened gun control laws so deaths by gun\n\nThis article talks about Liberal leader Justin Trudeau and his vow to bring Canadians together as one and to make Canada an open, confident and hopeful country. At a rally in Brampton, Ontario, he criticizes Stephen Harper’s “small and fearful” vision of Canada and promises to change that. Trudeau uses a direct quote of Franklin Roosevelt (“We have nothing to fear but fear itself”) to compare Harper’s plan for Canada saying that he has nothing to offer us but fear. Trudeau states that it’s a prime minister’s job to build Canadians up and together, not to tear us apart. Nearly 5 000 supporters attended the rally and it ironically took place in Brampton because it is one of Canada’s most ethnically diverse cities. Half of the population are immigrants\n\nPierre Elliot Trudeau was arguably one of the most vivacious and charismatic Prime Ministers Canada has ever seen. He wore capes, dated celebrities and always wore a red rose boutonniere. He looked like a superhero, and often acted like one too. Some of the landmark occurrences in Canadian history all happened during the Trudeau era, such as patriating the constitution, creating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the 1980 Quebec Referendum. However, it is Trudeau’s 1969 “white paper” and the Calder legal challenge which many consider to be one of his most influential contributions to Canadian history.\n\nJustin Trudeau is the 23rd Prime Minster of Canada and is the Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Son of the late prime minister Pierre Trudeau, Justin followed in his fathers footsteps. Graduating with a bachelor’s degree from the McGill University and a degree in education from the University of British Columbia. Trudeau worked as a teacher for many years, before making his political debut. In 2006, he chaired the Liberal Party’s task force for youth renewal. Trudeau was later appointed MP of Papineau in 2008, and is still current representing that riding. When running for office, Trudeau stated he would increase tax on those who were wealthy and tax cuts for the middle class, he also stated that he would address Canada’s climate change\n\nOpposing the belief that a dominating leader is running Canada, Barker brings up several key realities of the Canadian government. He gives examples of several “… instances of other ministers taking action that reveal the limits prime-ministerial power,” (Barker 178). Barker conveys the fact that Canada is not bound by a dictatorial government, “…it seems that the prime minister cannot really control his individual ministers. At times, they will pursue agendas that are inconsistent with the prime minister’s actions,” (Barker 181). Both inside and outside government are a part of Canada and they can remind the prime minister that “…politics is a game of survival for all players,” (Barker 188). Barker refutes the misinterpretation of the Canadian government by acknowledging that a prime-ministerial government existing in Canada is an overstatement.\n\nGeoffrey Canada was born on January 13, 1952 in New York, NY (Biography.com). He grew up in a poor, violent neighborhood to a single mother. His mother highly valued education and instilled those values in Geoffrey at a very young age and since he highly valued education he went on to receive a bachelor’s degree and then went to Harvard and received a Master’s Degree from the Graduate School of Education (hcz.org). Having become a college graduate he decided to put his degree to use and he eventually became the President of Harlem Children’s Zone, abbreviated as HCZ. He was the president of HCZ for nearly a quarter of a century and received many accolades and widespread\n\nFrom 1896 to 1911 Sir Wilfrid Laurier served as the Canadian prime minister. This was a period when Canada shifted from being agricultural to being proto-industrial. It was also a period of tremendous social and political tension in Canada. Laurier’s ability to compromise between the French and the English Canadians demands is what made him very successful and defined his time as leader. These compromises are seen through the settlement of the Manitoba School Question in 1896, Canada’s participation in the Boer War in 1899, and the Naval Service Act in 1910.\n\nSome people think that Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, who is the Prime Minister’s wife, needs extra help from the government. The reason is, she is having a busy time supporting her husband Trudeau, who is the Prime Minister of Canada. Also, she has three children and lots of job to do. It makes harder and harder for Sophie go through. However, even though, she is having a hard time, it is believed that she does not need an extra help, since Sophie already has enough help, and taking requests as the Prime Minister’s wife is not an official job; also, Trudeau has enough money to help his wife.\n\nFirst past the post is a voting system that is rife with controversy, particularly within the United Kingdom. The current Prime Minister of Great Britain, David Cameron, has expressed positively about the election method of first past the post, stating that it is more than just a system; it helps us to show democracy within the UK. The above quote was given during the AV referendum of 2011, which was a vote held throughout the country to determine whether the United Kingdom’s voting system of first past the post should be replaced with the AV – the alternative vote. (Aceproject.org 2015) This took place as part of the Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement written in 2010, but it was made clear that the majority of the public still believed in first past the post, as it was chosen as the favoured method by 67.9%. (BBC News 2015) However, there are many countries in which first past the post is not the chosen electoral system. In Germany, the parliament is elected using proportional representation. Every German voter gets two votes, the first of which enabling the voter to choose their candidate of choice from their local region – each candidate that is successful is then given a seat in parliament – and the second vote is to choose a party. (Spiegel 2013) Every representative that is chosen by the district from the first vote is immediately given a seat in parliament, and then the remaining 598 seats are divided between the parties based on the percentage of the"
