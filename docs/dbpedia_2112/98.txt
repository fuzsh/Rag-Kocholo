What happens when a bunch of Kyles come to Kyle’s party?

You make history.

At least, that’s the goal this Saturday.

At 1 p.m. May 18, the city of Kyle will hold its annual “Gathering of the Kyles” in an attempt to break the mark set by Guinness World Records for the largest same-name gathering.

What is the 'Gathering of the Kyles'?

It started as a joke, but this is no laughing matter. In the city’s fifth year trying to break the world's record for the largest same-name gathering, Kyle is hoping for 2,326 Kyles to show up. Last year, the city fell short by 836 Kyles, totaling 1,490.

The festival is held at Lake Kyle Park.

According to KUT, the current title belongs to Kupres, Bosnia-Herzegovina, where 2,325 people named Ivan gathered on July 30, 2017.

What are the rules for participating in the Gathering of the Kyles?

To qualify to be a part of the Guinness World Records attempt, all participants must have the name ‘Kyle’ — spelled that way. Iterations of ‘Kyle,’ such as Kyler, Kiel, or Kylee, are not accepted. Middle and last names will not be accepted.

The event is free. You don’t have to be named Kyle to show up unless you’re trying to help break the Guinness World Record. All Kyles must check in and register by 12:30 p.m. to be included in the official count.
