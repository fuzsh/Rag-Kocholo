The name Jehovah is in the oldest manuscripts and scrolls of the Bible oer 7000 times. In fact, it appears more than any other name in The Bible.

However, sadly, most modern translations have take out the name, and replaced it with the titles LORD and GOD. They capitalized the word "LORD" and "GOD" wherever the original text used the name Jehovah. Some translations have left the name in a few places. It appears 4 times in the old King James Bible, but the new King James edition has completely removed the name. The American Standard Version has it throughout the old testiment. There are other translations that have the name in a few select places. The New World Translation uses the devine name of Jehovah throughout wherever it originally appeared.
