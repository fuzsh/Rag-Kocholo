        "text": "Attorney\n\nA Little About Me\n\nWhile my first name is William, I have always gone by my middle name Kyle, but you might have heard me referred to as “the Bitcoin kid”. I was born and raised in Clarksville, graduated from Rossview High School in 2012, then enrolled at Austin Peay State University shortly thereafter. Early on in my undergraduate career, I developed an interest in political science, and also had my sights set on law school. I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in Political Science in 2016, then set a goal of applying for law school. After undergrad, I spent a year studying for and sitting for the Law School Admissions Test. In July of 2018, I packed my bags and told my friends and family goodbye for the first time in my life when I headed to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to start my three-year legal journey.\n\nPeople often asked what made me want to uproot my life and move 700 miles away to attend Oklahoma City University School of Law. My short reply is I followed a scholarship. My long answer is I may have been looking for a place to isolate myself to focus on the task before me. Before law school, I developed a functional understanding and extreme passion for the fledgling concepts of cryptocurrency, blockchain technologies, and other digital assets. During school I really began to hone in on the “crypto” space as a whole. I am sure I pleasantly annoyed my professors to no end with questions about ideas and concepts they cared very little about.\n\nI really enjoyed my years in Oklahoma. I made a few lifelong friends and a lifetime of memories. However, I figured out fairly quickly that Oklahoma was on the wrong side of the Mississippi to be considered home for me. I knew that I lacked any real desire to practice or stay there after graduation. The age-old saying rang true for me that home is where the heart is, and despite all my efforts, my heart remained in middle Tennessee.\n\nJourney to the Law\n\nUpon graduation, I returned to Clarksville and was brought on board with Crow Estate Planning & Probate in August of 2021. After I “conquered” my bar exam and was admitted to the Montgomery County Bar, I became the Counsel for Digital Assets within the firm. I have spent much of my time within the firm honing my probate and estate planning skills. Within these practice areas, I have had the pleasure of carving out a specific skill set revolving around digital assets. These assets are extremely nuanced and require a keen eye for detail when digital assets are being probated through an estate or being incorporated into an estate plan such as a will or a trust. Individuals who own digital assets may not fully comprehend the potential uphill battle their loved ones may face in retrieving their digital assets when they pass away.\n\nOn the flip side of that, oftentimes when a person passes away owning a digital asset, their loved ones are not well-equipped to articulate the scope of these assets or even explain the basic concepts of these assets and their surrounding technologies. My knowledge and personal endeavors within this asset class have equipped me to assist executors, administrators, and trustees with locating and moving these assets into the appropriate individual’s name or individuals’ names. Further, by virtue of being so entrenched in the digital asset space in my personal life, I’m uniquely situated to offer guidance to digital asset owners looking to navigate the arduous process of creating an estate plan around these assets.\n\nDuring my tenure with the firm, I have been honored and humbled to meet and serve the citizens of Clarksville and surrounding areas. I love running into familiar faces who come through the firm’s doors. Whether it is a previous educator of mine, a former neighbor, an individual who served alongside my father in the 160th, or a complete stranger to me, I consider it a distinct pleasure to get to know a little more about everyone who comes through our door. I look forward to serving you and your family with any estate planning or digital asset needs you may have."
