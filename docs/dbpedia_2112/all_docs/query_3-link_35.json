        "meta_description": "In today's episode of Backpacker Radio presented by The Trek, we are joined by the very highly requested Kyle O'Grady, known in the world of YouTube as Kyle Hates Hiking. Kyle is an experienced backpacker, having hiked the Long Trail, Appalachian Trail, Northville Placid Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, and Ouachita Trail, amongst many others. In addition to learning about his many trail tales, we dive deep into his passion for video creation especially on the subjects of true crime and trail mysteries. From humble beginnings as a Writer for AppalachianTrials.com to having more than 300,000 subscribers on YouTube, this is an entertaining detailing of Kyle's rise in the world of backpacking media. We wrap the show with some details about the impending sale of Backpacker Radio's famous hair wall, what we would do with an elephant, and the triple crown of social media hiking stereotypes.
