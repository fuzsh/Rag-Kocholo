        "text": "What happens when a bunch of Kyles come to Kyle’s party?\n\nYou make history.\n\nAt least, that’s the goal this Saturday.\n\nAt 1 p.m. May 18, the city of Kyle will hold its annual “Gathering of the Kyles” in an attempt to break the mark set by Guinness World Records for the largest same-name gathering.\n\nWhat is the 'Gathering of the Kyles'?\n\nIt started as a joke, but this is no laughing matter. In the city’s fifth year trying to break the world's record for the largest same-name gathering, Kyle is hoping for 2,326 Kyles to show up. Last year, the city fell short by 836 Kyles, totaling 1,490.\n\nThe festival is held at Lake Kyle Park.\n\nAccording to KUT, the current title belongs to Kupres, Bosnia-Herzegovina, where 2,325 people named Ivan gathered on July 30, 2017.\n\nWhat are the rules for participating in the Gathering of the Kyles?\n\nTo qualify to be a part of the Guinness World Records attempt, all participants must have the name ‘Kyle’ — spelled that way. Iterations of ‘Kyle,’ such as Kyler, Kiel, or Kylee, are not accepted. Middle and last names will not be accepted.\n\nThe event is free. You don’t have to be named Kyle to show up unless you’re trying to help break the Guinness World Record. All Kyles must check in and register by 12:30 p.m. to be included in the official count.\n\nWhen is the Kyle Fair A Tex-Travaganza and Gathering of the Kyles?\n\nThe official Kyle Fair A Tex-Travaganza is Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 12:45 p.m.\n\nPreregistration check-in and on-site registration is available 4-8 p.m. Friday and 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe attempt to break the Guinness World Record is 1 p.m. Saturday.\n\n'Make every Kyle count': Social media reacts to Gathering of the Kyles"
