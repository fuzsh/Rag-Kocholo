Mackye Gruber and produced by ABC Studios. The central character is a teenage boy (Matt Dallas) who awakens naked in a forest outside Seattle, Washington, with amnesia and no belly button. He is taken in by a family and given the name Kyle. The series follows Kyle as he tries to solve the puzzles of who he is and why he has no memory before that day. Although set in present-day Seattle, the series was filmed in the Vancouver, British Columbia area.\n\nThe show premiered June 26, 2006, on the ABC Family cable channel. Episodes were also broadcast on the ABC network for the first season, but only for part of the second season, after which it was only seen on ABC Family.\n\nAfter the 10-episode debut season on ABC Family during summer 2006, news reported a total of 23 new episodes were ordered for the second season, which started on June 11, 2007, with rebroadcasts on ABC beginning on June 15, 2007.[1] The second season's 13th episode, \"Leap of Faith\", aired on Monday, September 3, 2007; the remaining 10 began airing on January 12, 2008.\n\nThe German version was aired December 8, 2007.[2] The show started its second season in the UK on Monday, September 3, 2007, and on April 5, the first season was broadcast in France on M6. On October 5, 2007, TV Guide reported that ABC family had renewed Kyle XY for a third season of 10 episodes, which began airing on January 12, 2009.\n\nOn January 31, 2009, ABC Family announced that Kyle XY would not be returning for a fourth season.[3][4] The season finale of the show aired on Monday, March 16, 2009, at 9/8c on ABC Family, leaving several unresolved dramatic cliffhangers. Following the last episode, writer Julie Plec revealed what had been planned for further seasons.[5] She also noted that the season three DVD would contain a \"mini wrap-up\" feature for the series.[6] The \"wrap-up\" is called \"Kyle XY: Future Revealed\", with the writers and actors explaining their plans for future episodes and what would have ultimately happened in the series ending.\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nMain\n\n[edit]\n\nMatt Dallas as Kyle Trager\n\nMarguerite MacIntyre as Nicole Trager\n\nBruce Thomas as Stephen Trager\n\nApril Matson as Lori Trager\n\nJean-Luc Bilodeau as Josh Trager\n\nChris Olivero as Declan McDonough\n\nKirsten Prout as Amanda Bloom\n\nJaimie Alexander as Jessi Hollander (seasons 2–3)\n\nRecurring\n\n[edit]\n\nChelan Simmons as Hillary\n\nNicholas Lea as Tom Foss\n\nTeryl Rothery as Carol Bloom\n\nCory Monteith as Charlie Tanner (seasons 1–2)\n\nJ.

The show lost its reign when the series premiere of The Secret Life of the American Teenager brought in 2.8 million viewers. According to the same press release, Kyle XY received a household rating of 2.1 and reached 2.6 million viewers.[14] The repeat showing of the first episode on sister broadcast network ABC had more than 5.2 million viewers.[15] Several news sources said low ratings is one of the reasons for the series' cancellation.[3][4]\n\nThe third-season premiere (in a new time slot, with high-viewership lead-in The Secret Life of the American Teenager) was 1.5 million total viewers, down 33 percent from the Season 2 opener,[4][16] and most ABC Family shows significantly outperformed the show.[4] The second episode slid to 1.426 million viewers.[17]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Nominee(s) Result Ref. 2006 Teen Choice Awards Choice Summer Series Kyle XY Nominated 2007 Teen Choice Awards Choice TV Show: Drama Kyle XY Nominated Choice TV: Breakout Matt Dallas Nominated TCA Awards Outstanding Achievement in Children's Programming Kyle XY Won [18][19] Artios Award Best Children's TV Programming Robert J.
