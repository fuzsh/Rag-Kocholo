        "text": "Professional Experience and Activities\n\nAfter completing his PhD in 2013, Dr. Leach accepted a Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship at the TRIUMF facility in Vancouver, Canada, performing novel in-trap decay spectroscopy studies on highly charged radioactive ions with the TITAN collaboration. Dr. Leach is an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics at the Colorado School of Mines, Head of the Electroweak Interactions (EI) Group, and Spokesperson for the BeEST Experiment. In addition to work locally at Mines, the EI group’s research is performed at TRIUMF (Canada’s National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics) in Vancouver, Canada, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University.\n\nDr. Leach is a referee for numerous international research journals, and reviews funding applications for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and National Science Foundation (NSF). He has served as an ex-officio member on the Advisory Committee on TRIUMF (ACOT) which reports to the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), and recently a member of the TRIUMF 5 year plan (2020-2025) steering committee. Dr. Leach was also elected Chair of the TRIUMF Users’ Group Executive Committee (TUEC) in 2015, and has served as Chair-Elect (2016), Chair (2017), and Past-Chair (2018). The research program of Dr. Leach has been recognized with several awards, including the 2020 U.S. Department of Energy Early Career Research Award and being named a 2019 FRIB Visiting Scholar. From 2016 – 2021 he was the Head of Graduate Admissions in the Department of Physics and in 2021 was a member of the Research Advisory Board at the Colorado School of Mines."
