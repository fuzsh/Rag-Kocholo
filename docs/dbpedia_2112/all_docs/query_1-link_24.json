We need tall Kyle’s, short Kyle’s, young Kyle’s and old Kyle’s to get close to the record set five years ago\" City of Kyle Special Events Manager Claudia Rocha said in a statement. \"We’re very excited about the upcoming, inaugural Kyle Fair and have high hopes that this event will bring out the Kyles needed to grab a spot in the record books.\"\n\nThis is Kyle's fourth try to break the record.\n\nRight now the Guinness World Record belongs to Kupreski Kosci in Bosnia and Herzegovina who saw 2,325 people named Ivan get together on July 30, 2017.\n\nFlorida school district has hilarious response to students who wanted to skip school for Taylor Swift concert\n\nAll Kyles who show up will be given a free Kyle Fair T-shirt and an opportunity to take a group photo.\n\nThe fair also has three nights of free, live music, margarita and rib-making contests, and crafts and food vendors."
