He brings a wealth of knowledge both on and off the field. Kyle understands what it takes to be great, and I know that he will connect well with our players here at Dartmouth.\"\n\nDeremer arrives at Dartmouth following a stint as the director of operations for the Nebraska-Omaha men's soccer team. He oversaw travel, meals, equipment and student-athlete support for the Mavericks during the 2021 season.\n\nA former collegiate soccer player, Deremer began his career at St. Mary's College before transferring to Creighton for his final three years of eligibility. He helped lead the Bluejays to Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) Championships in 2008 and 2010 as a key component of Creighton's nationally ranked defense.\n\nIndividually, Deremer earned second-team All-MVC Conference honors following his junior season in 2009 and first-team honors after his senior year. He also was named a CoSIDA Academic All-District honoree in 2010.\n\nAfter his decorated career as a student-athlete, Deremer worked for Creighton's men's soccer program as a graduate assistant. He assisted with travel, operations and training for the Bluejays during the team's Final Four run in 2012.\n\nHe also served as a coach for Omaha United Soccer Club, where he served as an academy director. Deremer coached youth and high school teams in the Omaha area.\n\n\"I want to thank Coach Oshoniyi and the Athletic Department for the opportunity to be part of the Dartmouth men's soccer program,\" Deremer said. \"I look forward to joining the staff and working with this fantastic group of student-athletes. With the new season approaching quickly, I'm excited to get on campus and begin contributing to the team's success both on and off the field.\"\n\nDeremer graduated from Creighton in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in history and business administration. He then received a master's in business administration in 2013 from Creighton."
