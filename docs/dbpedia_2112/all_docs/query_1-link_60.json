        "text": "Kyle Richards and her estranged husband, Mauricio Umansky, have quite literally started going their separate ways amid their separation.\n\nThe “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star shared during an appearance on the “B---- Bible” podcast May 14 that Umansky has moved out of their family home.\n\nShe confirmed to host Jackie Schimmel that Umansky moved to West Hollywood.\n\n“That was weird,” she explained.\n\n“I always knew when that day came it would feel strange, very real,” she added.\n\nRichards pointed out that as a mom of four with multiple dogs also under her roof, she's used to having “a busy household.”\n\nShe said the day Umansky moved out of their family home was “just strange” because everything was “so quiet.” Umansky moved while Richards was out of town, which she said was “the smart thing to do” because she thought it would be too hard to be there to witness it.\n\nRichards also added that daughter Alexia Umansky recently moved out.\n\nShe told Schimmel she is “very proud” of how she and Umansky continue to get along and hang out together with their other family members.\n\nAs for what the next chapter looks like for Richards, she says she doesn't know.\n\n“I’ve never been on my own,” she said, adding she became a mom at 19.\n\nShe also seems on the fence about returning to “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” — a show she has been on since its first season in 2010.\n\n“That is the big question right now,” she explained. “The decision has to be made very, very soon, like, any minute.”\n\nShe added a last-minute decision to return or not is “not uncommon” and that the toll last season took on her is a factor.\n\n“I just don’t know if I can do this,” she said. “There are conversations being had.”\n\nOutside of the show, when it comes to her dating life at the moment, Richards said she needs “to take a beat” and acknowledged both she and Umansky are free to “do whatever” they want amid their separation.\n\n“If someone flirts with me at a red light, I will hit the gas and go through the red light,” Richards said.\n\n“I'm very uncomfortable,” she added, saying she also doesn't enjoy going to social events.\n\n“I probably just need a minute,” she said.\n\nRead on to learn more about Richards and Umansky’s relationship.\n\nKyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky meet at a nightclub\n\nIn a 2021 interview with The Knot, Richards revealed she met Umansky at a nightclub called Bar One when they were in their 20s.\n\n\"It’s so funny to me because now our kids go there and we’ll say ‘well, that’s actually where we met 27 years ago.’ Twenty-seven-plus (years ago)! (Mauricio) thought I was Demi Moore’s sister — and I had actually been told that (before) — so he worked up the courage to come over and say hello, thinking that I was her sister,\" she said.\n\nKyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky start dating\n\nOnce they started dating, Umansky said he was really taken with Richards' parenting skills.\n\nAt the time, Richards was already a mom to her oldest daughter, Farrah Brittany Aldjufrie, whom she welcomed in 1988 with her then-husband, Guraish Aldjufrie. The two were married from 1988 to 1992.\n\n\"She has an amazing soul. She’s an amazing person. And quite honestly, the fact that she already had a daughter, it made dating a lot more important,\" Umansky told The Knot. \"I had to take it much more seriously because I was responsible for a woman with a daughter. I also got insight into the way that she was as a mom and how good of a mom she was. And that gave me insight into the future and what it would look like.\"\n\nKyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky get engaged\n\nWhile recalling their engagement to The Knot, Umansky said he planned a \"pretty, romantic evening\" for them once he decided he wanted Richards to be his wife.\n\n\"The proposal, oh my God, I took Kyle out to (Santa Monica restaurant) Shutters... on a date, and I gave her a bouquet of flowers,\" he said. \"And it was a very pretty, romantic evening and inside the flowers I had a rosebud case...\"\n\nUmansky noted that the ring box was shaped like a rosebud, and once Richards didn't notice he hid the ring box inside the flowers, he told her to smell the bouquet.\n\n\"Here’s the truth. I saw something that looked like a box, but I didn’t want to be wrong and embarrass myself,\" Richards said.\n\nUmansky added, \"And then when she saw the box and she opened it and saw the ring, I got down on one knee and I asked her to marry me.\"\n\nKyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky get married\n\nIn January 1996, Richards and Umansky got married in a Jewish wedding at a Bel-Air Country Club, they told The Knot.\n\nRichards noted that they had a January wedding because she was pregnant with their first kid and her second child at the time, and she wanted to make sure her dress would fit.\n\n\"It was just amazing bringing my family together and his family and all of our friends. And it’s so funny, I’ll never forget the day of our wedding, everyone had to wear kippahs on their head, and my family was like, ‘Wait, what’s happening?’ I looked over and my brother-in-law, who’s not Jewish, was in the mirror putting it on and I was like, ‘Okay, this is a first for our family,'\" Richards recalled.\n\nKyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky welcome their first child together\n\nIn 1996, Richards gave birth to her first child with Umansky, daughter Alexia.\n\nAfter she graduated from Emerson College in 2018, Alexia went on to work for her father's real estate company, \"The Agency,\" and is now a cast member in Netflix's \"Buying Beverly Hills.\"\n\nKyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky welcome their second child together\n\nIn 2000, the couple welcomed their daughter Sophia.\n\nIn 2022, Sophia graduated from George Washington University and received a sweet shoutout from her mom.\n\n\"So incredibly proud of you @sophiakylieee 😭❤️🙏👩🏻‍🎓 I love you so much & am so proud of you every day. But today my heart was bursting with pride 🙏,\" Richards wrote on Instagram.\n\nKyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky welcome their third child together\n\nIn 2008, Umansky and Richards welcomed their youngest child, daughter Portia, together.\n\nIn 2017, Portia went to school dressed as her favorite superhero, which was her mom.\n\n\"Today Portia was supposed to dress as her favorite Superhero at school. She chose to go as me,\" Richards said on Instagram when she shared a pic of her daughter emulating her style. \"Be still my beating heart !💓 #humblebrag She said she had to wear gray sweatpants and a comfy shirt 🙋🏻‍♀️ When we got to school her principal said “Let me guess, you’re your Mom” #daymade 🎉🎉🎉.\"\n\nKyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky shoot down divorce rumors\n\nIn early 2023, rumors started to surface that Richards and Umansky were divorcing after 27 years of marriage.\n\nIn light of the reports, the couple issued a joint statement on Instagram, saying that “any claims regarding us divorcing are untrue.”\n\n“However, yes, we have had a rough year. The most challenging one of our marriage,” they wrote. \"But we both love and respect each other tremendously. There has been no wrongdoing on anyone's part.\"\n\nMauricio Umansky confirms he and Kyle Richards and are separated\n\nIn October 2023, Umansky told People that he and Richards are “separated” but are “not throwing in the towel” just yet.\n\n“We’ve been married for 27 years, we’re having a bit of a rough patch,” he said.\n\n“Sometimes life throws you different things” and “you’ve gotta work through it,\" Umansky added.\n\nKyle Richards says fans will see the 'good and bad' moments from her life on Season 13 of 'RHOBH'\n\nRichards took to Instagram ahead of the Season 13 premiere of “RHOBH\" to tell her fans that they will see both \"good and bad\" moments from her life.\n\n\"Each season always brings surprise twists and turns. This season more than ever,\" she said. \"I am normally one to isolate when I am struggling, so navigating through this time in my life while cameras were rolling was challenging to say the least. I am grateful that are plenty of fun times too.\"\n\n\"Ultimately that has been what has kept me coming back year after year. That and my relationships with the people that make RHOBH. Cast and crew. So, now it’s time to sit back and watch ( and for me to relive these moments. Good and bad.),\" Richards continued. \"As always, thank you for watching. And thank you for coming along on this wild ride we call life #RHOBH.\"\n\nKyle Richards says she was 'taken aback' by pictures of Mauricio Umansky holding hands with his 'Dancing With the Stars' pro dancer partner\n\nDuring an Oct. 25 appearance on \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,\" Richards spoke about some recent photos that were taken of Umansky and his Season 32 \"Dancing With the Stars” pro dancer partner, Emma Slater.\n\nIn the pics, it appears the two are holding hands.\n\nWhen asked about the pictures, Richards said she was \"taken aback\" by the snapshots.\n\n\"Upset?\" Andy Cohen asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Richards replied. \"That was very hard to see. That hurt my feelings.\"\n\nWhen Cohen asked Richards if she thinks something is going on between Umanksy and Slater, she said she was unsure, even though the pictures seemed fishy.\n\n“Well, the thing is this, I don't know if anything has happened yet, but obviously there is something there,\" Richards said. \"Listen, I love him very much, and we are amicable, but that really did hurt me.”\n\nTODAY.com has reached out to Umansky and Slater for comment.\n\nIn light of the photos, Richards said she decided to delete an Instagram post she shared that supported Umansky's stint on the show. Even though she felt bothered by the pictures of him and Slater, she didn't let it affect her voting capabilities.\n\n\"I also voted for them,\" she said. \"I have proof that I did too. I even sent the proof to the family chat. I did my votes, and I sent the screenshot to the family chat.”\n\nKyle Richards reveals she was the 'driving force' behind her and Mauricio Umansky's separation\n\nDuring her Oct. 25 appearance on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,\" Richards revealed that she was “the driving force” behind her split with Umansky.\n\n“It originated from me,” she said.\n\nRichards said when the news of her and Umansky's split first came out, it was \"really, really devastating\" for their family.\n\n\"My kids were just crying and wouldn't leave the house,\" Richards said. \"It was really, really difficult. Now they're much better, and they're really strong. They're just so together and so smart and they've been my best, best, best friends. I could not be more proud of them. They're amazing human beings. Thank God I have them.\"\n\nShe also shared that she and Umansky are still living in the same house but are sleeping in separate rooms.\n\nMauricio Umansky responds to dating rumors about him and Emma Slater\n\nAmid Season 32 of \"Dancing With the Stars,\" photos emerged of Umansky and Slater holding hands, stoking rumors that the two are in a relationship after his separation from Richards.\n\nOn Oct. 26, Umansky and Slater posed a selfie video during a rehearsal to set the record straight.\n\nThe dancing duo denied a romance in the video posted to Umansky’s Instagram story. They explained that they’ve become “really good friends” while competing together on “DWTS.”\n\nAfter high-fiving each other for making it through the latest round of competition, Umansky changed gears.\n\n“We do want to address this story, this whole thing that’s going out and about whether or not Emma and I are dating, whether or not we went out on a date,” he said. “For full clarity, we are not dating.”\n\nHe explained that the two have become friends as they’ve “been dancing together now for six weeks, four hours a day every single day.”\n\nSlater then chimed in, saying of their rehearsals, “Guys, it’s intense. Like you really form a very, very special bond, and I think we have similar personalities.”\n\nSlater added that she and Umansky have forged a “super supportive relationship.”\n\n“We’re definitely there for each other,” she explained, adding, “And it’s beautiful. That’s a great thing.”\n\n“It is,” agreed Umansky, who then explained what happened before they were photographed hand in hand. They stepped out to a restaurant to get sushi “in our rehearsal clothes,” he said.\n\n“Rehearsal clothes,” Slater repeated for emphasis, waving her hand over her athletic attire.\n\nUmansky said as the pair left the restaurant, they were “recapping” their week. The two “grabbed” one another’s hands as they continued “recapping and summarizing” while walking to their cars.\n\nThe paparazzi snapped photos of them and turned the gesture into a “blown-out moment,” he said.\n\n“That’s it. Hope that clarifies it,” he said before assuring fans he and Slater will “keep on dancing” and “having fun.”\n\nTODAY.com was directed to Umansky’s Instagram story after reaching out to his representative for comment. TODAY.com did not hear back from reps for Slater.\n\nKyle Richards gets emotional talking about her marriage at BravoCon\n\nAt BravoCon, Richards got a little emotional when she started talking about her separation from Umansky.\n\n“We love each other very much, and we are family no matter what happens and we have a really strong family unit,” she said while tearing up.\n\n“We’re just trying to figure it out. We know we love each other,\" she said.\n\n“This is not my fairytale clearly,” Richards added. “I do appreciate all of your support.”\n\nKyle Richards clarifies relationship status with Mauricio Umansky\n\nWhile at BravoCon in Las Vegas, Richards filmed a special episode of \"Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen\" that aired Nov. 6.\n\nDuring her appearance, Richards said she wanted to clear up something she said earlier on the red carpet about her and Umansky's marriage that went viral.\n\n“I misspoke on the (red) carpet today,” she said. “Two times I had to correct someone when they said ‘divorce.’ I said ‘separated.’ And then I went and said it, and then it went everywhere. So, that was my bad.”\n\nRichards explained that she still views her marriage with Umansky as a \"success\" even though they're separated at the moment.\n\n“We’re still a love story. I love him very much,\" she said.\n\nKyle Richards shares an update on the living situation with Mauricio Umansky\n\nDuring a Feb. 21 appearance on TODAY with Hoda & Jenna, Richards said that there was trouble brewing in their marriage for quite some time, but she didn’t really give more thought to the relationship struggles until one of her friends died.\n\n“I think there were certain things that were there that we had kind of been putting on the back burner for a long time,” she said. “You know, you’re pregnant and you’re breastfeeding. And then it was working and juggling the kids and you kind of forget about it and then it resurfaces again. And I think I just kind of came to a, I would say a breaking point, honestly, and I’ve gone through a lot. I lost my best friend, and I think that really does change you and makes you look at things differently.”\n\nRichards said learning her friend had died by suicide led her to reassess aspects of her life, including her marriage. She began thinking about what she was “willing to accept and not accept” in her relationship.\n\nAlthough it was “hard” to decide to split, Richards said she knew it had to be done.\n\nNow, four months after Umansky confirmed their split in an October 2023 interview with People, Richards said they don’t have any ill will toward each other.\n\n“So, the current status is we live under the same roof ... in different rooms,” she explained.\n\nThe “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star noted that Umanksy will “come and go” as he pleases since they have “other homes.” However, if he decides to stay for dinner, Richards said it’s never a combative situation.\n\n“It’s friendly,” she explained.\n\nAs for how they handled their new relationship status on Season 13 of “RHOBH,” Richards said it was “hard” because when filming began, the pair didn’t let their daughters know that they had already separated.\n\n“He wasn’t really ready to share that,” she said of Umansky.\n\n“Is there a chance that you guys can make it through this?” Jenna Bush Hager asked.\n\n“I really don’t know what my future holds right now, to be honest, which is the weirdest part of all of this,” Richards said with a laugh. “I’ve always had so much stability my entire life.”\n\nKyle Richards confirms she and Umansky are 'allowed to' date other people\n\nDespite still living under the same roof, Richards told fans in an Amazon livestream on Feb. 29 that she and Umansky were \"allowed to\" date other people.\n\nWhen a fan asked if she was dating anyone new, Richards deflected, saying she wasn't sure how to answer the question.\n\n\"We're allowed to,\" she said of her and her estranged husband. \"We’re allowed to do what we want.\"\n\nKyle Richards explains why her and Mauricio Umansky’s separation wasn’t really on ‘RHOBH’\n\nIn that same Amazon livestream on Feb. 29, she said that they were living under the same roof for now, but it’s not “sustainable,\" before explaining why their separation wasn't seen on \"RHOBH.\"\n\nShe explained she hadn’t been allowed to appear on the first season of Umansky’s Netflix show, “Buying Beverly Hills,” due to her deal with Bravo’s “RHOBH.”\n\nFor the second season, Richards said, the two networks struck a deal and she was allowed to appear on her husband’s show.\n\nShe told fans that she and Umansky weren’t ready to share with the world their marital problems when she was filming the 13th season of “RHOBH.” But then, as things disintegrated, the Netflix cameras were rolling.\n\n“For anyone who is confused, that (decision to split) happened after we were done filming (‘RHOBH’) and the story came out,” she explained. “Then the Netflix cameras happened to be with us in Aspen so they ended up filming us talking about it.”\n\n“Obviously, Bravo’s been following my life for 13 years. It’s not like (Netflix) can film that scene and then I don’t share that with the viewers of ‘The Housewives,’” she added. “So we ended up shooting that scene — both for ‘Buying Beverly Hills’ and ‘The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’” — after we were all wrapped and the story ended up coming out.”\n\nRichards went on to confirm that she and Umansky are discussing living separately, but for now are just “easing into things.”\n\n“We’re fortunate that we don’t fight and we get along,” she said. “It oddly works. But ... at some point, you have to be like ‘OK, it’s the new normal but I don’t think it’s sustainable.’”\n\nKyle Richards removes 'Umansky' from her name on Instagram\n\nRichards recently removed “Umansky” from her name on Instagram.
