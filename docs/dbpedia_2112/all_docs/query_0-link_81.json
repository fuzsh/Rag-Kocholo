        "text": "COLLEGE STATION, Texas (KBTX) -The professional soccer world will turn its eyes to Aggieland this Saturday as Mexico faces off against Brazil in a first-of-its-kind event at Kyle Field. Kyle Field will be rocking, but it won’t be the 12th Man taking the field. Athletes from Mexico and Brazil will square off for a friendly soccer match that’s expected to reach and possibly break attendance records.\n\nThe June 8 event at Texas A&M is set to begin at 7:30 p.m. and will be the first international soccer match at Kyle Field. With just over 65,000 tickets sold so far, tourism experts expect demand to grow as the big match approaches.\n\n“We are around 65,000 tickets sold at this point. We had 100,000+ tickets available originally. We are still getting ticket buyers every day and there is typically a good walk-up day-of the match for tickets,” said Kindra Fry, Texas A&M Assistant Athletics Director for Special Events.\n\nFor those attending the game, there are a few important things to know, starting with parking. Parking on campus will range from $25 to $40 according to information released by Texas A&M Transportation Officials. In addition to the many on-campus garages, there will be street parking available in neighborhoods around Kyle Field that will also be $25. For those preferring to park away from the festivities, The city of Bryan is offering a free shuttle service from downtown. Parking will also be available at the Roy Kelly Garage in downtown Bryan.\n\nOfficials say the shuttle will operate similarly to Aggie Game Days in the fall. During football season the shuttle runs between Regent Street in Bryan and the Memorial Student Center on campus. Service runs 3 hours pre-game to 1 hour post-game. Service is provided throughout the game.\n\nAll vehicles parking on the Texas A&M campus must display a valid TAMU permit or park in a paid visitor area. For more information about parking on campus and a complete list of university parking rules and regulations, please visit or call (979) 862-PARK (7275). Fry says there are no shuttles aside from the Downtown Bryan Shuttle, but there is still parking available.\n\nCustomary to any game day there will be street closures near Kyle Field. See the maps below. They are scheduled to close at 2:00 PM on Saturday.\n\n“People can come, they can park their cars, grab a bite to eat before the game or after the game, and then have that convenience of being able to just hop on a shuttle and it’ll take you right to Kyle Field. And that way you don’t have to worry about parking several times,” said Lina Adams, Destination Bryan’s PR & communications coordinator.\n\nOnce at Kyle Field, be aware of the clear bag policy in place. Bags will be checked upon entry, and officials recommend leaving weapons, outside food and drinks, horns, and even soccer balls at home. Additionally, everyone will go through open gate metal detectors before scanning their tickets.\n\nDetails are limited, but Texas A&M Athletics officials say a Futbol Fiesta will take place in Aggie Park from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. on match day. Fry says the fiesta is the only sponsored event for the public.\n\nFor those who can’t attend, tourism experts say the many restaurants and businesses around town will be ready to welcome visitors.\n\n“It is gonna be, I think, a great atmosphere for people to come out and enjoy and experience something they really probably never have experienced, especially here at Kyle Field. And I think that it’s gonna be, it’s gonna be a whole bunch of fun and, and really something different for our community,” added Jeremiah Cook, Visit College Station tourism manager.\n\nProhibited Items:\n\nOutside food or beverages unless specifically authorized by the venue\n\nWeapons including knives, pepper spray, stun guns, concealed weapons, and firearms\n\nFireworks of any kind including flares, smoke bombs, incendiary devices, and pyrotechnics\n\nIllegal drugs or harmful chemicals\n\nAny missile or object that can be used as a projectile\n\nAerosol cans or pressurized containers\n\nProfessional camera equipment, including tripods, monopods, battery packs, large commercial video cameras\n\nNoisemakers including whistles and horns\n\nLaser pointers\n\nRemote-controlled aircraft or unmanned aircraft systems (drones)\n\nHover-boards\n\nSelfie sticks\n\nSigns, banners, or flags larger than 3′ x 5′\n\nInflated soccer balls\n\nBeach balls or other inflatable items\n\nAnimals (excluding certified service animals with proper documentation)\n\nConfetti\n\nAny other items deemed inappropriate and/or dangerous by the Venue Security Representative\n\nFor more information on prohibited items, parking maps, and ticket purchases, visit the sites below:\n\nProhibited Items\n\nTexas Duel 2024 - Texas A&M Athletics - 12thMan.com\n\nKyle Field Parking Map\n\nhttps://transport.tamu.edu/WebFS/Transport/Maps/Events/SummerSoccer.pdf\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nTexas Duel: Mexico v.
