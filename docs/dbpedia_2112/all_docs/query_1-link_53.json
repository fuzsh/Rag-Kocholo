He understands the culture we have set and will be able to walk in from day one and command respect from our group of men and continue the upward trajectory we expect our offense to take.”\n\nGoundrey served as the Western Scout for Panther City during the 2021-22 campaign after playing 11 years in the National Lacrosse League. He most recently served as the Head Coach for the Delta Islanders of the British Columbia Junior A Lacrosse League. A left-handed forward from Richmond, British Columbia, Goundrey won two NLL Championships with the Calgary Roughnecks in 2004 and 2009 and for his career, totaled 312 points on 97 goals and 215 assists. Goundrey and Panther City Head Coach Tracey Kelusky were teammates on both championship runs with Calgary and the two have a long history of being teammates with one another, as they also both played Junior A lacrosse together in Peterborough, Ontario."
