        "text": "LISTEN\n\nKYLE – Sunday night, the Medicine Root District executive board voted unanimously 4-0 to change the name of the community of Kyle to Little Wound.\n\n“After some discussion, we really wanted to honor Chief Little Wound by renaming the community after him, not a non-Indian Senator from South Dakota,” said James Toby Big Boy, Medicine Root district chair, “Marcel and the Bull Bear family came to the district and made a request to change the name of the community.”\n\nJames Henderson Kyle was originally from Ohio where he attended the University of Illinois and graduated from Oberlin College then instead of entering the bar, he attended Western Theological Seminary, graduating in 1882. After three years as pastor of Congregational Services in Utah, he moved to South Dakota where he served as pastor in Ipswich and Aberdeen before becoming pastor and financial secretary of Yankton College. In 1890, Kyle was elected to the State Senate then in 1891, he was elected to the US Senate, serving until his death in 1901. He served as the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor during the 53rd, 55th and 56th Congress.\n\nLittle Wound was born in 1835, he became an Oglala Lakota Chief and after the passing of his brother Bull Bear, he became leader of the Kuinyan branch of the Kiyuksa band. He was a leader who was known for really caring for his people. He passed away in the winter of 1899. Currently Little Wound has the school named after him, a community of Medicine Root district and the housing area located near St. Barnabas Church south of Kyle.\n\n“This is an idea that is long overdue, it’s been talked about forever so I’m glad they’re taking action on it,” said Chancy Wilson who is finishing up his third term as a tribal council representative from Medicine Root district, “they are going to bring a resolution to the council for support at the end of the month.”\n\n“This decision is something I really applaud, it’s the right thing to do,” said Kevin Killer, past SD state legislator who led the movement to change the name of Shannon County to Oglala Lakota County, “there’s not enough time to put together a referendum vote by the general election but they should take the issue to the county commission.”\n\nThe Oglala Lakota County commission meets the second Wednesday of the month in Hot Springs at the Fall River Courthouse, added Big Boy, we’ll be on the agenda and we’re working with the SD Secretary of State’s office as well.\n\n“This is not a new idea, it’s been brought up a number of times in the past, even some Little Wound high school students brought it up but either no one understood the process of how to get it done or there just wasn’t anyone to follow through on the idea,” said Marcel Bull Bear, a Lakota elder who teaches Lakota history and culture classes for Oglala Lakota College, “we need to honor our past chiefs and leaders, it is so important for our youth to have positive Lakota role models.”"
