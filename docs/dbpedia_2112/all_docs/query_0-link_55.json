        "text": "Kyle Larry Dahl, 36, of Ettrick, WI, died unexpectedly on May 15, 2024.\n\nHe was born in La Crosse, WI, to Doris and Larry Dahl of Ettrick, and married his best friend, Brittany Woestman, in 2016. They have two beautiful children, Bradley and Madison, and a beloved hound dog and farming companion, Freddie.\n\nWhen he wasn’t farming or helping other farmers around the community, Kyle enjoyed fishing, welding, hunting, watching the Bucks and Brewers, and most importantly, spending time with his family and friends. Kyle epitomized what it meant to be a devoted member of a close-knit community. Having grown up in Ettrick, he either knew or knew of almost everyone in the G-E-T area. If Kyle didn’t already know you, he was going to get to know you. He connected with people naturally and genuinely, wanting to learn everything about them. Kyle had the gift of making people feel seen and heard—that what they had to say was important. While he enjoyed occasional travel and seeing other parts of the country, he was happiest at home giving his kids rides in the tractor and introducing them to all the magical aspects of growing up on a farm.\n\nBesides his wife and children, Kyle is survived by his parents Larry and Doris Dahl, sister Cassie (Nat) Forster, niece Morgan and nephew Chase, grandmothers Phyllis Dahl and Marie Wilber, mother and father in-law Jeanne and Doug Woestman, and brother-in-law Blake (Kayla) Woestman. He is also survived by numerous aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends who loved him dearly.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his grandfathers, Laurell Dahl and Raud Wilber.\n\nA celebration of life will take place from 1 to 4 p.m. Saturday, May 25 at the Ettrick Rod and Gun Club."
