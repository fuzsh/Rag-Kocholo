        "text": "The Kyle Drive Park project is now in the Master Plan phase. There will be many more touchpoints with the community throughout the coming year, and we hope to hear from you! We of course agree that everyone who will be impacted by this project has a right to participate, and we welcome all to stay involved throughout the planning process.\n\nFunding has been allocated for community engagement, Master Plan development, design, and construction at Kyle Drive Park through the 2022 Parks Bond Referendum. Raleigh Parks is excited to work with the community to create a Master Plan that reflects the unique needs and desires of local residents.\n\nThe Parks, Recreation and Greenway Advisory Board approved the Kyle Drive Park Situation Assessment on October 19, 2023. A Situation Assessment is an analysis of the local context around a project, to help staff determine the best way to effectively engage the community in a collaborative process. The Situation Assessment also identifies the Community Advisory Group (CAG), which is a membership-specific committee that provides oversight of the project planning process and ensures that decisions include a broad representation of the community and stakeholders impacted by the project.\n\nKyle Drive Park Situation Assessment\n\nParks, Recreation and Greenway Advisory Board Presentation - Oct. 19, 2023\n\nPark Master Plan was adopted by City Council in August 2024."
