        "text": "When is the next Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America?\n\nOur next Ride will be the 29th Anniversary Charity Ride, which will take place May 3 - 9, 2025 starting in Traverse City, MI and ending in Hot Springs, VA. We will announce the remaining overnight stops on social media in October/November 2025.\n\n​\n\nWhat is the route for the next Kyle Petty Charity Ride?\n\nOur 2025 Ride will start in Traverse City, MI and end in Hot Springs, VA. We will announce the remaining overnight stops on social media in October/November 2025.\n\n​\n\nHow do I sign up to join the Kyle Petty Charity Ride?\n\nThere is an application process for joining the Ride. Applications are sent out in early January of each year to apply for the Ride in the Spring. We accept applications on a first come, first serve basis. If you are interested in receiving an application to join the Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America, please send an email to info@kylepettycharityride.com. Please include your full name, mailing address and phone number. We will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n​\n\nWhat are the qualifications to join the Kyle Petty Charity Ride?\n\nAll first-time participants are required to participate in a “Safety First” program instructed by Charity Ride Motor Marshals at Ride Headquarters the day before the Ride begins. The “Safety First” program offers valuable information on safety procedures and maneuvers. Participants are required to have a valid motorcycle endorsement on their driver’s license.\n\n​\n\nDo you allow any type of motorcycle on the Charity Ride?\n\nYes, we allow any type of motorcycle; however, a five (5) gallon tank is required. Your bike must be able to go at least 165 miles on a tank. We do not allow Slingshots.\n\n​\n\nWhere can I meet the riders along the Route?\n\nPlease visit our route tab for a detailed listing of our stops. Local communities are highly encouraged to come out and support the riders, experience the sights and sounds of 125 motorcycles, receive autographs and photos with Ride celebrities, purchase Ride memorabilia and donate to the Ride’s “Small Change. Big Impact.” program.\n\n​\n\nHow can I donate to the Charity Ride at local stops?\n\nWe thrive off the support of our local communities. We accept cash, change or checks at all of our local stops.\n\nI live along the route, can I join the Ride for a day?\n\nDue to the safety of our participants, we cannot allow unregistered riders to join in for portions of the Ride. We do encourage interested motorists to follow along behind the last Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America support vehicle. Thank you for respecting our riders and keeping everyone safe. Prior to the Ride, you may apply to participate as a “leg rider.\" In order to do so, you must be registered with the Ride and sign all release forms prior to joining the group. However, we only accept leg riders if positions are still available after sending applications for the full Ride. In the past, we have filled the Ride with core riders and have not been able to accept leg riders.\n\nCan I donate to the Kyle Petty Charity Ride online?\n\nYes, you can donate to the Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America online by visiting the donate tab. You can also call 704-714-4545 or send a check to Kyle Petty Charity Ride, Inc. at 10720 Sikes Place, Suite 145 Charlotte, NC 28277.\n\nWhere do my donations go?\n\nDonations made to the Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America benefit the Ride’s primary beneficiary, Victory Junction.\n\nVictory Junction is a year-round camp that exists to enrich the lives of children, ages six to 16, with chronic medical illnesses. The activities and environment provide life-changing camping experiences that are exciting, fun and empowering.\n\nIt costs more than $2,500 for one child to attend Victory Junction for a week, but no child or family incurs this cost, thanks to the generosity of corporations, organizations and individuals.\n\nFor additional questions or inquiries, please call our office at 704-714-4545 or send us an email at info@kylepettycharityride.com.\n\n​\n\n​"
