        "text": "The city of Kyle in Texas attempted to break the existing world record for the largest gathering of people with the same name but fell short of 706 Kyles.\n\nPeople of different age groups sharing the name 'Kyle' had congregated at a park in the suburbs of Austin.\n\nAccording to an AP News report, \"It is not the first time the Kyles have come gunning for the Ivans. Last year, the official count at what has become known as the Gathering of the Kyles clocked in at 1,490 in the fast-growing Texas city that is about 37 miles south of Austin, the state’s capital.\"\n\nThe report added that 'Kyle' is not among the chart-topper popular names in the US as per the Social Security Administration. The administration’s recent data put the name 'Kyle' at 416th position in 2023, while Ivan ranked at 153rd position, the report said.\n\n\"Last year, we were blown away by the amount of Kyles who showed up in honour of their namesake. Nearly 1,500 Kyles answered the call, but we need even more Kyles to break the record in 2024,\" metro.co.uk reported quoting Claudia Rocha, events manager at the Kyle Fair.\n\n\"Kyles, you're our only hope to bring the Guinness World Record for the largest same-name gathering, first-name-only, to American soil and firmly in the hands of Kyles worldwide,\" she said."
