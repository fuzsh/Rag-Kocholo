Iâm a proud 5th generation farmer raising beef cattle and broiler chickens alongside my wife and four boys in Sidney, a rural community of 180 people, located in southwest Sharp County.Â\n\nIn addition to the farm, I am the General Manager of Spring River Paramedic Ambulance Service, I have served on the Sharp County Quorum Court for over 10 years, and I have been a volunteer fireman since 1987.Â\n\nThe challenges facing our country, state, and small communities are unlike anything I have ever seen. As a dedicated public servant, I am compelled to ensure that rural conservative values are well represented in Little Rock.\n\nAfter a great deal of prayer, my family and I are proud to announce that I will be running as a Republican for the newly formed Arkansas House District 28 which includes portions of Sharp, Independence, Lawrence, and Stone Counties.Â\n\nThis is an exciting opportunity for rural Arkansas to have equal representation at the state level. With over a decade of experience advocating for quality jobs, vocational education, and public health and safety, I am well-equipped and ready to go to work for the betterment of this district.\n\nAs your next state representative, I commit to being a strong voice for our rural conservative values.Â\n\nI look forward to meeting many of you in the coming months and speaking about the issues that matter to Arkansans like you and me. My personal cell phone number and contact information are published below and I welcome your input.Â\n\nI humbly ask for your prayers and your support, thank you and God bless.Â\n\nBart Schulz\n\n(870) 613-1940\n\nImage submitted\n\nHave a news tip or event to promote?
