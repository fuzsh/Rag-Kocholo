        "text": "LISTEN\n\nKYLE – Last fall, the Medicine Root District executive board voted to change the name of the town Kyle to Little Wound on the request of community members, led by Marcell Bull Bear, Lakota elder historian and Oglala Lakota College instructor.\n\nSo far it is a name change at the community level. That executive board decision on September 20th needs to continue on to the state level for the name change to be official on national maps and permanent community identification.\n\nTaylor Little Whiteman, Medicine Root chairman, said this is something that still needs to be worked on and he plans to continue the effort in which steps is needed next for the name change.\n\nAccording to Rory Mennenger, Secretary of State’s Office, Elections & Federal Project Coordinator, the statutes that apply for the changing the name of a city appears to re- quire an election.\n\nThe statues 21-37-6 that apply is the change of name of municipality or platted portion—Proceedings is whenever it may be desirable to change the name of any municipality or platted or mapped portion thereof, any person interested in proposing such change may proceed as provided by §§ 21-37-7 to 21-37-9, inclusive.\n\nThe statue 21-37-7 is for a petition for change of name of municipality or platted portion. A petition for change of name under § 21-37-6 shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court for the county in which the municipality is situated setting forth the cause why such change of name is desirable, and the name asked to be substituted.\n\n(When petitioning the court for the name change, cause must be set forth why Kyle should be changed to Little Wound.)\n\nIn statue 21-37-8 is the requirement of a hearing and publication of that hearing. Publication of notice of hearing on change of name of municipality of platted portion. Notice of the hearing on change of name under § 21-37-6, stating the time and place of hearing, object of hearing, and proposed name shall be given by publishing the same once each week for at least two successive weeks in some legal newspaper published in the municipality involved or if none is published therein, then in any legal newspaper of the county, in which the municipality is situated.\n\nLastly, statue 21-37- 9 requires an election. Hearing and order on change of name of municipality or platted portion. Proof of voters’ desire required – Duplication of names avoided. At the time and place specified in the notice and upon proof in open court to the satisfaction of the judge thereof that notice of the hearing has been given as provided in § 21-37-8 and that two-thirds of the legal voters of such municipality desire such change of name, and that there is no other municipality in the state of the name asked for, or in the case of proposed change of name of a platted or mapped portion of a municipality, that there is no other platted or mapped portion of the same name as proposed in said municipality, unless the portion is being added to a portion with the name to which change is sought, the court or judge may order and direct such change of name and direct the clerk to enter such order.\n\nThe US Census data shows the community of Kyle, also known as Medicine Root or Pejuta Haka, of having 1,093 residents. The largest institutions in the community is Little Wound School, Indian Health Service and Oglala Lakota College that bear the name Kyle in their addresses.\n\nRecords show there has not been any town name change in South Dakota for years. In 2015, the residents of Oglala Lakota County successfully changed the name of their county from Shannon County to Oglala Lakota County through legislation and an election. This name change was led by Kevin Killer, OST president, when he was in state legislation. That process took time and research petitioning the court, getting on the state ballot for voting to the people.\n\nOn November 4, 2014, voters in the county voted by a margin of 2,161 to 526 to rename Shannon County to Oglala Lakota County. On May 1, 2015 was proclaimed by the governor as the official day for renaming the county\n\n(Next week – History: The Life of Little Wound)\n\nWho is Little Wound:\n\nChief Little Wound was born August 30, 1830 and died July 8, 1901. He was the son of Bull Bear and his brothers were Spotted Eagle, Thunder Bull, Bull Bear and Little Chief. He and his wife Tells Lies had eight children including an adopted son. He was known for his leadership skills and had a large tiospaye. Little Wound was one of the Oglala chiefs who believed education was one of the answers for a better future for their people. Little Wound was known for his protective stance for the land and the people. In his younger days, he was gifted leader during the Indian wars, fighting to protect his people’s rights, land and survival. After the Indian wars, Chief Little Wound settled with his followers in the Medicine Root community area, he still continued to look after the best interests of his people with the government in regards to land, education and treaty rights. As an elder, he traveled with the expo shows across the nation, taking many photos that are seen today in history books, online and in museums, along with stories of his life and successes. After his death in 1901, his son George Little Wound continued to push for education closer to home and in 1932, George and others were successfully in getting Little Wound School built.\n\nWho was James Kyle:\n\nThis is who the town of Kyle was named for, James Henderson Kyle who was born February 24, 1854 and died July 1, 1901. He was an American politician. One of the most successful members of the Populist Party, he served for 10 years as a member of the United States Senate from South Dakota from 1891 until his death. Kyle, South Dakota was named after him. He was from Cedarville, Ohio and gained much education and supported himself by farming and teaching. In 1885 he moved to South Dakota because it was better for his wife’s health. In 1890 he entered politics at the urging of many people after he made a passionate political address. This was shortly after South Dakota became a state. He was first elected to the state senate but shortly after that he was elected to the United States Senate. He refused to join a political party and was one of few people to enter the Senate as an independent, but he was supported by the state Democratic party at this time. During his first term in the Senate he joined the emerging Populist Party and when that party was disintegrating, Kyle switched to the Republican Party. Kyle served on many committees in the Senate and was one of the main sponsors of a bill to create the holiday Labor Day. Kyle spoke in favor of women’s suffrage and prohibition, and took a swing at big corporations, banks and railroads. He was often strong in his belief of Indian affairs, patents, territories, pensions, irrigation and reclamation of barren lands, giving back to the Indian for what was taken and forests. He died of an illness at the age of 47 in Aberdeen, SD where he had lived from the late 1880s until 1891. He was an active politician and was given notoriety by naming a town for him. It is also said, he was a friend of the Turning Hawks, who had a store in Kyle during that time era."
