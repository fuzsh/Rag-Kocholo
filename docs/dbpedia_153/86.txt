WUPA[]

1995–2001[]

WVEU became the charter UPN flagship station upon the network's launch (debut) on January 16, 1995. The station then adopted the name UPN 69. In the summer of that year after the station's owners, Ellis Communications sold WVEU to Viacom's Paramount Stations Group in exchange for KSLA in Shreveport, Louisiana & the station changed its callsign to WUPA for UPN Atlanta.

2001–2002[]

2002–2006[]

In 2002, UPN unveiled a new logo and WUPA introduced this new identity which eschewed the channel number in favor of UPN Atlanta.

2006–2008[]

In 2006, UPN and The WB were merged to form The CW. WUPA joined The CW despite the presence of a Tribune-owned WB affiliate, WATL. Tribune had agreed to sign their WB affiliates to The CW, except in Philadelphia, Atlanta and Seattle where Viacom/CBS had strong UPN O&Os.

2008–2023[]

2008–2014[]

The channel number returned to the station's identity in 2008, after a six-year absence, and the word "Atlanta" was removed.

2014–2023[]

In 2014, the word "Atlanta" was re-added to the logo.

2023–present[]

Exercising an option in its 2022 sale of controlling interest in The CW to Nexstar Media Group, CBS News and Stations announced on May 5, 2023 that WUPA and all of their affiliated CW stations would drop the network and move to independent status on September 1. In preparation for the move, WUPA unveiled this "Atlanta 69" logo on its social media accounts in August 2023; the logo is similar in "city + channel" form to fellow ex-CW siblings WKBD-TV/Detroit, WTOG/Tampa-St. Petersburg, KMAX-TV/Sacramento, KSTW/Seattle-Tacoma and WPSG/Philadelphia.
