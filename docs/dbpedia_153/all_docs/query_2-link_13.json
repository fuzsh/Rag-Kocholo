I do not see a sub channel launching just for CW with Atlanta being a top 10 market. The outcome here will be interesting.\n\nIt's not as big a deal as the musical chairs when WATL lost Fox to WAGA, and CBS moved to then-WGNX (now WANF 46), or when NBC and ABC swapped between WSB and WXIA. But it is interesting because of the management meetings, probably going on. The prospects for The CW to get better under Nexstar are nearly nil-- managers are wondering \"Do we really want to hook up with THEM?\"\n\nOn the other hand. maybe it's what those indies are looking for: Nexstar's Plan for The CW Includes Targeting Older Viewers, Adding Low-Cost Unscripted Programming\n\nWhatever happens, somebody's branding department or contractor is gonna have a lot of work.\n\nIt will be interesting what CBS does in Atlanta, Tampa and Seattle though given that they cannot just market themselves as \"CBS Your City Here+\" given that these stations losing their CW affiliation don't connect to the main CBS affiliate like in San Francisco, Sacramento, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia do.\n\nGray Renews CBS Affiliations Covering 54 Markets - TV News Check\n\nThe agreement comprises seven markets acquired from Meredith Corp. and 47 legacy markets. All these will continue to be available locally to subscribers on Paramount+ and widely distributed across all traditional and virtual MVPD platforms.\n\nHere's this one Gray Television renews the CBS affiliation for WANF Atlanta. That eliminates the chances that WUPA gets the CBS affiliation even though the station is owned by Paramount.\n\nGray Renews CBS Affiliations Covering 54 Markets - TV News Check\n\nThe agreement comprises seven markets acquired from Meredith Corp. and 47 legacy markets.

So it doesn’t really eliminate anything.\n\nGray Renews CBS Affiliations Covering 54 Markets - TV News Check\n\nThe agreement comprises seven markets acquired from Meredith Corp. and 47 legacy markets. All these will continue to be available locally to subscribers on Paramount+ and widely distributed across all traditional and virtual MVPD platforms.\n\nHere's this one Gray Television renews the CBS affiliation for WANF Atlanta. That eliminates the chances that WUPA gets the CBS affiliation even though the station is owned by Paramount.\n\nWPCH?\n\nIIRC wasn't the affiliate shuffle (no counting 2/11) set off be the company that owned Channel 5 going Bankrupt and Fox picking up the former Storer (I am not sure of the spelling) stations that eventually became Fox I&O's?\n\nYes and WVEU became WUPA. Also CBS went to the former WGNX/WGCL now known as WANF.\n\nWell if TV passport can be trusted, then when WUPA drops the CW on 9/1/23 then I see that the 10pm news moves to 8pm and Family Guy re runs at 9 and more Family Feud at 10pm. CBS does an 8pm in Boston but also does a 10pm on its independent. Then again Boston has a CBS O&O affiliate also. Right now 5,36,17 and 69 all air a 10pm news so a move to 8pm would only have them competing with 36 at 8pm.. Will probably have to wait 2 more weeks to see how Atlanta's 69 will program its day for the fall season. Still no idea how nexstar will get CW in Atlanta.\n\nSchedules are also out for the 1st week of September WPCH and WATL. No CW programming, obviously or there would have been an announcement by now. It looks like, For whatever reason, Neither wanted to upset the apple cart of their current programming and take on Nexstar's revamping of The CW. There is a predction on another forum of CW going to WPCH 17.4 Which is currently listed as just a standard definition rebroadcast of 17.1."
