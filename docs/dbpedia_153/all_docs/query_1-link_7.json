        "text": "WUPA is an independent station in the Atlanta, Georgia market, broadcasting on digital channel 36 and displayed on tuners as virtual 69. Its subcarriers are 69.2 which is Start TV, 69.3 which is the diginet TBD, 69.4 which is MeTV (a retransmission of WGTA/channel 32) and 69.5 which is Fave TV, a CBS-owned variety diginet.\n\nWUPA signed on in 1981 as WVEU-TV, an independent station, although its programming consisted early on of business news in dayparts and subscription TV evenings and weekends. The station started running music videos later and then offered more mainstream fare by the mid 80s, showing syndicated fare, cartoons and network programming passed up by Atlanta's affiliates.\n\n1990 logo as independent WVEU.\n\nChannel 69 began airing programming from Home Shopping Network and was the target of a purchase from HSN but the deal fell through. In 1994, then-CBS affiliate WAGA announced it would switch to the FOX network, leaving CBS to round up a new affiliate. When Atlanta's other independents expressed no urge to join the network, they bought channel 69 out of sheer desperation and sized it up to be a CBS affiliate. However, CBS reneged the purchase after seeing the station's threadbare facilities (located on the access road of Interstate 85 in the northeast section of the metropolitan area). CBS would eventually land on WGNX/channel 46 (now WANF), and by year's end, Paramount Stations Group would buy channel 69 and make it their Atlanta affiliate of the new UPN network in January 1995. Its call changed to WUPA.\n\nCBS would actually take ownership of the station again as Paramount's parent corporation, Viacom, would divest itself of CBS, which would assume ownership of stations PSG had owned. In 2006, UPN and The WB network announced it would shut down by fall and merge to become The CW network. WUPA would be its Atlanta home. CBS has re-merged with Viacom, and the new company became Paramount Global (even though CBS has a majority stake).\n\nWUPA began digital transmissions on channel 43 in 2000. In 2003, they moved their virtual to 43 briefly until they moved it back to 69 in 2008.\n\nWUPA's programming had been controlled from WGNT, the CW affiliate in Norfolk, Virginia. WGNT was sold to Local TV, owner of Norfolk CBS affiliate WTKR, so WUPA will handle its own programming controls. During exhibition football, WUPA had been carrying an NFL telecast from CBS in the event that an Atlanta Falcons game on WGCL airs at the same time. In August 2014, WUPA became the exclusive broadcast home for Atlanta Falcons exhibition football games. CBS assisted in the production of the telecasts. Starting with the 2020 season, the Falcons preseason games will move to WAGA/channel 5 with the games they air simulcast with NFL Network. From 2010 to 2018, WUPA was the flagship for the game show Family Feud as the show taped in Atlanta at the Civic Center. The show returned to Hollywood as its taping locale in 2018.\n\nAs a result of the spectrum auction, WUPA moved their physical digital transmissions to channel 36 on September 6, 2019. They retain 69 as their display channel. On February 17, 2020, WUPA launched a 10 PM newscast which originates from CBS flagship WCBS. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CBS shut down its New York news headquarters (including WCBS' news department), so in the interim, WUPA's news originated from Boston CBS affiliate WBZ. In August 2020, the origination was moved to KTVT, the CBS O&O in the Dallas-Ft. Worth TX market. In July 2022, CBS announced the launch of NOW, locally produced newscasts for their owned stations not affiliated with them. WUPA is among them.\n\nWUPA is one of eight CW stations owned by Paramount Global (CBS News and Stations) that reverted to independent status in September 2023. This is a result of CBS and Warner Bros. selling a majority stake in the CW to Nexstar. The CW has moved to WPCH/channel 17. WUPA rebranded as \"Atlanta 69.\"\n\nContents\n\n1 Current Prime-Time Schedule\n\n2 Previous Prime-Time/Late Night Schedules\n\n2.1 2005-2006\n\n2.2 2004-2005\n\n2.3 2003-2004\n\n2.4 2002-2003\n\n2.5 2001-2002\n\n2.6 2000-2001\n\n2.7 1999-2000\n\n2.8 1998-1999\n\n2.9 1997-1998\n\n2.10 1996-1997\n\n3 External Links\n\nCurrent Prime-Time Schedule\n\nLegend new encore premiere finale movie or special live local\n\nDay 7:00 7:30 8:00 8:30 9:00 9:30 10:00 10:30 11:00 Monday Family Feud Family Feud Atlanta Now News at 8 48 Hours Family Feud Family Feud The Neighborhood Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Family Feud Family Feud SEAL Team The Equalizer Two and a Half Men Two and a Half Men Women of Wrestling Sunday The Equalizer The Neighborhood The Neighborhood American Housewife American Housewife\n\nPrevious Prime-Time/Late Night Schedules\n\n2005-2006\n\nDay 3:00 PM 3:30 PM 4:00 PM 4:30 PM 5:00 PM 5:30 PM 6:00 PM 6:30 PM 7:00 PM 7:30 PM 8:00 PM 8:30 PM 9:00 PM 9:30 PM 10:00 PM 10:30 PM 11:00 PM 11:30 PM midnight 12:30 PM Monday Fear Factor The Steve Harvey Show The Parkers Girlfriends The Parkers Judge Mathis The Bernie Mac Show The Bernie Mac Show One on One All of Us Girlfriends Half & Half The Jamie Foxx Show Living Single Girlfriends Paid Program Paid Program Paid Program Tuesday Fear Factor The Steve Harvey Show The Parkers Girlfriends The Parkers Judge Mathis The Bernie Mac Show The Bernie Mac Show America's Next Top Model Sex, Love & Secrets The Jamie Foxx Show Living Single Girlfriends Paid Program Paid Program Paid Program Wednesday Fear Factor The Steve Harvey Show The Parkers Girlfriends The Parkers Judge Mathis The Bernie Mac Show The Bernie Mac Show America's Next Top Model Veronica Mars The Jamie Foxx Show Living Single Girlfriends Paid Program Paid Program Paid Program Thursday Fear Factor The Steve Harvey Show The Parkers Girlfriends The Parkers Judge Mathis The Bernie Mac Show The Bernie Mac Show Everybody Hates Chris Eve Cuts Love, Inc.
