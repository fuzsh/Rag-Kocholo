        "text": "In case you didn't get the memo, Atlanta is my new home now after many, many years in Fairbanks. In other words, I'm back to watching real TV once again in a Top 10 market (Fairbanks is #203).\n\nA long time ago, we had a thread discussing some forgotten network, syndicated, and yes cable shows, especially game shows. And we know that based on listings, Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy was on WAGA and WXIA respectively before Wheel went to WXIA and now sister station WATL. WAGA also carried \"$1 Million Chance of a Lifetime\" (which briefly out-rated Wheel), while 11 Alive had \"$100,000 Pyramid\". And WSB hasn't carried any more syndicated game shows since dropping Family Feud in favor of Entertainment Tonight and scheduling it at 7:30, where it has remained ever since. As for WANX (later WGNX and now WGCL)? The 1980 Let's Make A Deal and Face The Music got some airtime there.\n\nBut what about some of the other lesser-known game shows, like those brought up on that aforementioned thread? Here are some of them and my guesses on where they ended up (bpatrick may back me up on this):\n\nEvery Second Counts: Since it failed to get any clearance at all in New York City, I wouldn't be surprised if WATL got it\n\nWipeout (with Peter Tomarken, not the Big Balls): If it aired in NYC at 2:00 am, maybe WVEU (now WUPA) had it at a more feasible time in early fringe\n\nAnything For Money: I think WXIA, but I'm not sure (KTVA was the only Alaskan station that had this)\n\nCard Guppies (aka Card Sharks 2001): Probably WUPA\n\nCatch Phrase: WGCL, perhaps?\n\nThe Challengers: WXIA\n\n1990 revivals of Tic Tac Dough/Joker's Wild: Probably WUPA\n\nBzzz!: Either WUPA or WATL\n\nClick (hosted by Ryan Seacrest pre-American Idol and everything else): WUPA\n\n$100,000 Name That Tune (Jim Lange): Since they previously had Face the Music, WGCL\n\nMake Me Laugh (1979): Unknown\n\nPitfall: Unknown\n\nMaybe some more blanks can be filled out.\n\nNeither \"Pitfall\" nor \"Make Me Laugh\" (if you're talking about the '70s version) aired in Atlanta; I do remember watching \"Make Me Laugh\" on KXAS Dallas/Ft. Worth.\n\nThe '70s version of \"Masquerade Party\" with Richard Dawson as host was on WXIA. \"Dealer's Choice\" was on WXIA in the summer and fall of 1974, then moved to Ch. 17, where it was paired with \"The Diamond Head Game\" in primetime (8-9 PM) starting in January 1975.\n\nWAGA had \"The $128,000 Question\" during its first season (1976-77) but didn't renew it for the 1977-78 season. Ch. 5 also had the Bob Hilton version of \"Truth Or Consequences\" in the 1977-78 season (Ch. 2 had it when Bob Barker was host), but I don't remember who carried Larry Anderson's version in 1987. \"Win, Lose Or Draw\" also aired on Ch. 5.\n\nCh. 2 had the dating show \"That's Amore,\" which it aired around 1 or 2 AM.\n\nWell, the only thing I have to say is...IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THIS BOARD BACK!!!!\n\nSeveral blanks have been filled since the original post (I asked this same question on Facebook):\n\nThe Challengers, Catch Phrase, Liars Club, The Price Is Right (Tom Kennedy), So You Think You've Got Troubles?!, Card Sharks (Bill Rafferty)--WSB\n\nThe Price Is Right (Doug Davidson), Quiz Kids Challenge, Merv Griffin's Crosswords, Wipeout--WXIA\n\nTrump Card, The Joker's Wild (1990), Click, Strike It Rich, Pictionary (1997)--WAGA\n\nCross-Wits (1986)--WATL; the original version might have been on WSB\n\nSplit Second (1986)--WUPA\n\nCard Guppies (Card Sharks 2001), To Tell The Truth (John O'Hurley)--WGCL; they originally had the current incarnation of Family Feud before moving to its current home on WUPA\n\nBut still, we've got these:\n\nAnything For Money\n\nTic Tac Dough (1990)\n\nHeadline Chasers\n\nTruth or Consequences (1987)\n\nEvery Second Counts (that is, if it ever aired in Atlanta at all)\n\n$100K Name That Tune (Jim Lange)\n\nAs for Double Dare, Finders Keepers, and Remote Control (the latter aired weekly)? They might have been on WATL.\n\nWhat about Couch Potatoes? Since it was also a Group W game show like Every Second Counts (and its library also property of CBS), it probably belonged to either WAGA or WSB. Even though they were years away from becoming a Fox O&O, Studs was on WAGA, not WATL like all other Fox stations.\n\nAnd remember that American Gladiators copycat Knights & Warriors (which lasted one season in 1992)? I'm guessing that WUPA carried it.\n\nBy the way...Atlanta was probably one of the many markets that also said \"NO!\" to Guilty or Innocent, Pictionary (1989), and/or Yahtzee for obvious reasons. Headline Chasers, Tic Tac Dough '90, Love Connection '98 (on somebody other than WSB, which had the original version), $50,000 Pyramid, and The New $100,000 Name That Tune are still unknown.\n\n\"Don Adams' Screen Test\" was on WAGA. I don't know if anyone has mentioned it but \"It's Your Bet\" (hosted successively by Hal March, Tom Kennedy, Dick Gautier, and Lyle Waggoner) was also on WAGA; it was on at 1 PM until the summer of '73, when CBS moved \"Secret Storm\" back to 4 PM; Ch. 5 elected to air it on delay at 1, and moved \"It's Your Bet\" to 3:30, meaning \"Match Game\" wasn't picked up in Atlanta until the fall.\n\n\"He Said! She Said!\", the show that evolved into \"Tattletales,\" aired on Ch. 11 in the 1969-70 season."
