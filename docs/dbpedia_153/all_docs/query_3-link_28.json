But, you’re unlikely to get all your local channels (like The CW) on a live TV streaming service, and you’ll need a solid internet connection (at least 25Mbps) to stream without buffering.\n\nHere are our top live TV streaming services that carry The CW channels, either live or on-demand:\n\nYouTube TV—$72.99/mo.\n\nHulu + Live TV—$76.99–$89.99/mo.\n\nFubo—$32.99–$99.99/mo.\n\nDIRECTV STREAM—$69.99–$149.99/mo.\n\nData as of post date.

The site and app also feature several past shows from The CW and other networks.\n\nWhat’s on The CW?\n\nUntil recently, The CW’s programming consisted almost entirely of DC Comics superhero series and young adult dramas. These days the network is diversifying its lineup with more grown-up fare, reality shows, and even sports in the form of the LIV Golf League.\n\nDramas\n\nAll American\n\nAll American: Homecoming\n\nCoroner\n\nGotham Knights\n\nProfessionals\n\nSuperman & Lois\n\nWalker\n\nSports\n\nACC college sports\n\nInside the NFL\n\nLIV Golf League\n\nLocal sportscasts (broadcast only)\n\nReality, variety, and game shows\n\n100 Days to Indy\n\nCriss Angel’s Magic with the Stars\n\nGreat American Joke Off\n\nKiller Camp\n\nMasters of Illusion\n\nMysteries Decoded\n\nPenn & Teller: Fool Us\n\nTotally Weird and Funny\n\nWould I Lie to You?\n\nWhat’s The CW?\n\nThe CW launched in 2006 as a co-consolidation of The WB (owned by Warner Bros.) and UPN (owned CBS/Paramount) networks—that’s where the “C” and “W” come from. In 2022, Nextar Media Group purchased a controlling interest in The CW, with Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global retaining smaller ownership stakes.\n\nWhat channel is The CW on FAQ\n\nIs The CW a free channel?\n\nYes, the CW is available to watch for free with an antenna via local broadcast affiliates or streaming through CWTV.com and The CW app.\n\nIs The CW a local channel?\n\nThe CW has around 200 affiliate broadcast stations in the U.S., so The CW channel is likely available in your area.\n\nAre local stations dropping The CW?\n\nIn September 2023, eight CW affiliate stations dropped The CW programming and went independent: KBCW (San Francisco), KMAX (Sacramento), KSTW (Seattle), WKBD (Detroit), WPCW (Pittsburgh), WPSG (Philadelphia), WTOG (Tampa-St. Petersburg), and WUPA (Atlanta)."
