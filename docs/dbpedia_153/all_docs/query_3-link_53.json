ATSC 3.0 does deliver on better reception.\n\nFor ATSC 1.0 the digital \"cliff\" for reception is around 15 dB S/N ratio. I vaguely recall that for ATSC 3.0, the stations can make tradeoff decisions between signal receivability versus the bit rate used, so there might be situations where the digital S/N \"cliff\" is significantly lower than 15 dB. For the WPCH lighthouse in Atlanta, I wonder if anyone knows what settings are currently being used, and are they different for each of the HD channels being carried? I am assuming you'd need something like TSReader (if it's even available for 3.0) to see the raw bit rate/resolution settings.\n\nAeolos747\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Jan 28, 2022\n\n·\n\n3 Posts\n\nIs there any hope for getting WGTV (GPB) reliably in the city?

Nothing big though.\n\nSounds like I am doing as good as can be.\n\nYou could always try a separate antenna for VHF if you have room for it in your attic. There are not a lot of VHF antenna choices on the market. You could try the Stellar Labs 30-2475 if it will fit in your attic. It is about 5 ft long, has 8 elements and would receive a stronger signal than your 1 element antenna. If you decide to try it, buy from somewhere that you can return it if it doesn't work out for you. You would also need a VHF/UHF antenna combiner (diplexer) to combine the feedlines from it and your other antenna. Antennas Direct makes one, model EU385CF-1S and also Clipsal, model 3105 DPOUV.\n\nI am in Acworth and I have to use a large VHF antenna (10 ft long, 10 elements) outside on a 30 mast to pick up WGTV.\n\ntustinfarm\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Mar 9, 2004\n\n·\n\n450 Posts\n\nEast Atlanta, on top of a rise in terrain that I thought would help.\n\nFor antennas, I’ve had the Clearstream 2Max then 4Max now recently trying a powered Wineguard PureTV 70.\n\nI have a completely different take in your problem. For RF channel 7 which WGTV actually uses (virtual channel 8), if there are any strong FM signals in the lower part of the FM band (88-90 MHz), these can overload a TV signal amplifier or tuner, creating 2X distortion products that fall smack dab into WGTV's frequency band (174-180 MHz). I had this problem when I first started tinkering with OTA TV. There were a couple of FM transmitters within a couple miles of my location, which caused severe problems with stations like WGTV and WXIA, due to overloading. I could actually see the pulsing signal spikes when observing the raw RF spectrum. So the ideal tool for troubleshooting these intermittent problems would be a spectrum analyzer, but lacking that my suggestion would be to try inserting an FM trap filter right after the antenna, and before any amplification. Based on your rabbitears report it would be hard to recommend any kind of signal amplification, unless it's needed to distribute the TV signals to multiple outlets. For FM filters, one challenge is to make sure you use one which cuts the FM signals in that key 88-90 MHz part of the band. Some models don't do much in that zone, in order to protect RF channel 6, which is right below the FM band.\n\nrichart\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Apr 16, 2010\n\n·\n\n455 Posts\n\nI have a completely different take in your problem.
