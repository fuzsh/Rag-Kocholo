WTEN's satellite station WCDC would leave the air November 19, 2017 (two weeks earlier than the scheduled shutdown date of December 1), not only because the station's spectrum was sold through the FCC's spectrum incentive auction, but also due to damage to the station's transmission line in a storm.
