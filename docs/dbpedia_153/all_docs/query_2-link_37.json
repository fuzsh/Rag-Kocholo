Formerly Peach State Public Radio. Poor signal in the Atlanta area. Signal was once supplemented with a 10-watt translator at FM 100.7.\n\nGeorgia Peach State Public Radio is largely ignored in metro Atlanta where non-commercial NPR/PRI affiliate WABE-FM dominates. The primary audience is outside the metro-Atlanta area. Peach State tried unsucessfully in the mid/latter '80s to acquire licenses of some student-run, non-commercial stations at state supported schools.\n\nBoth Peach State and Georgia Public TV are divisions of state-run Georgia Public Broadcasting. GPTV broadcasts to the Atlanta area from its Athens station, WGTV Channel 8. Programming for the tv and radio networks originates from state-of-the-art digital studios in Atlanta. The facilities were almost nixed by state legislators after GPTV broadcast the PBS series \"Tales of the City\" in the early/mid '90s. In the aftermath of that broadcast, the then executive director was forced to retire and a new director was appointed before the legislators would approve funding for the new $30 million studios. The studios are part of the new GCATT complex on 14th Street in urban Atlanta. When GPB moved to the GCATT complex in 1997, then Executive Director Werner Rodgers said of the facility, \"It is the most technically advanced public television and radio facility in the nation and the first fully digital production center - public or commercial - in Georgia.\"\n\nIn the late '90s, GPB was heavily in debt because of unbridled spending on office furnishings and high-tech equipment. One if its snafoos involved a $801,740 contract awarded without competitive bidding to a private firm to develop and run a satellite delivered class to 106 students. In late spring 1999, Governor Barnes fired GPB Executive Director Werner Rogers and the board of directors of the Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission, the policy-making board that oversees GPB. He appointed Kim King, a former Georgia Tech football player, as new head of the GPTC. Before the firings, the Augusta Chronicle wrote, \"The (just completed state) audit makes clear that GPB's soaring deficits have much more to do with slipshod and possibly corrupt management than it does with state funding shortages and ungenerous GPTV viewers.\"\n\nIn summer of '99, Peach State discontinued \"Adventures in Good Music\" with Carl Haas and the NPR program \"World of Opera\" as a cost cutting moves. A program featuring the music and folklore of \"singing cowboys\" replaced the opera.\n\n88.5 - WRAS - Atlanta\n\nLicensed to the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia.\n\n89.3 - WRFG - Diversified - Atlanta\n\nPacifica Radio affiliate. Rock, blues, Afropop, bluegrass, folk, and acoustic. Recent power increase to 100 kW, but the station barely reaches the I-285 perimeter. A community station spawned by the \"age of aquarius\" in the late '60s.\n\n90.1 - WABE - NPR, PRI, Classical Music - Atlanta\n\nLicensed to Atlanta Board of Education. Transmitter located on Stone Mountain.\n\n91.5 - WWEV - Religious - Cumming\n\n91.9 - WCLK - Jazz and Soul Music - Atlanta\n\nClark Atlanta University.\n\n92.1 - WJGA - Adult Contemporary Music - Jackson\n\nSignal is simulcast on AM 1410. Poor Atlanta signal.\n\n92.3 - WMOQ - Country Gold Music\n\n92.9 - WZGC - Dave-FM - Atlanta\n\nIn August 2004, Classic Rock Z93 became Dave-FM. The news media knew about the format change before program director Frank Jaxon found out. He was fired along with all the on-air staff.\n\nInfinity Broadcasting, New York. Lost Falcons to WGST in winter 1998. Replaced the Greaseman's syndicated morning show in early 1997 with local DJ Skinny Bobby Harper. Harper left the station in early 1999. After a stint as a talk host on WSB-AM, he moved to WSB-FM, and then to WZGC, which was once classical WGKA-FM. After Harper left WZGC, he worked for MARTA and Hartsfield International Airport.\n\nIt is rumored that Infinity's purchase of WZGC was held up by former U.S. Senator Jesse Helms of N.C. who wanted (and got) Infinity's agreement that if they bought the station, they would not put Howard Stern on it. That is one reason the Greaseman came to WGZC.\n\nWZGC was Atlanta's first oldies station. It aired Drake-Chenault's Solid Gold format using state-of-the-art automation in the early '70s.\n\nDale O'Brien was the PM drive dj in '80. Had Casey Kasem's \"American Top 40\" on Sundays. Format was standard top 40. When 99.7 (Warm 100) changed to Power 99 and top 40, WZGC started moving towards a more urban format, sort of a cross between V-103 and top 40. Format change was never official, but was evident by the playlist. Converted to classic rock in '88, forcing 96 Rock to ultimately return to a more traditional AOR format.\n\nThe Greaseman arrived as the am drive dj in 1993. This was a big boost to ratings at first, but listenership fell off quickly as the jokes were recycled. In '98 - '99, continued beleaguerment in the ratings caused Z-93 to expand its classic rock playlist to include '80s AOR and some new wave.\n\n93.3 - WVFJ - Religious - Manchester\n\nPoor Atlanta signal. Calls were once WFDR after former president Roosevelt who spent time in nearby Warm Springs. Was in the past targeted more to the Columbus market. A number of proposals to move the station to a taller tower closer to Atlanta have been made, but none have materialized. Station downgraded from C to C-1 to facilitate such a move. Without the downgrade, the required mileage separation to 92.9 MHz would have prevented the move. They are either now broadcasting from a taller facility, or are about to do so (something like 27 kW at 1600, which is about the equivalent of 100 kW at 983, a maxed out C-1).\n\n94.1 - WSTR - Top 40 Rock Music - Smyrna\n\nJefferson Pilot Communications, Greensboro, NC. AM side is WQXI-AM. Was WKXI in the late '60s to the early '70s where the format was upbeat instrumental music with frequent business news and stock market updates. Changed calls to WQXI-FM (94-Q) in the early '70s when it became a short-lived automated pop rock station soon converting to a \"live\" top 40 format. Has been WSTR (Star-94) since about 1990.\n\nIn 1980, 94-Q \"The Music FM\" moved from a lighter AOR to a \"hard,\" more top-40, AC. Format would become progressively more AC (including Jazz Flavors) over the decade. Australian dj Craig Ashwood hosted evenings and became a long time 94-Q fixture, lasting into the early '90s. In 1990, WQXI-FM 94-Q became WSTR Star 94. In '93-'94, the change of Power99 to alternative 99X caused Star 94 to assume a straight top 40 format. In '93-'97, got into a battle with B98.5 over hosting the conflicting '70s-'80s retro shows on weekend evenings (Star 94's \"Friday Night '80s\" and \"Saturday Night Fever\" up against B98.5's \"Friday/Saturday Night Dance Party.\" Truce declared when Star 94 got Friday nights and B98.5 Saturday nights. In '98, Star 94 did an April Fool's Day show set in 1978, using old commercials, old sponsors, interviews with Olivia Newton-John, and old news reports.\n\nWent from local WDJK-FM (see AM 1550) to WKXI-FM with Bob Carr & Jeff Winter.\n\n94.9 - WUBL - Country Music - Atlanta\n\nClear Channel Communications, Covington, KY. In early December 2006, the Christmas music stopped, the call letters were changed from WLTM to WUBL, and the format was changed to something called \"The Bull.\" In late 2002, began promoting itself as \"Light FM.\" For over 30 years, the station's calls were WPCH (\"Peach\"). The \"Light FM\" format appears to be an automated Clear Channel format that uses \"voice tracking.\" That is, the on-air chatter has been pre-recorded for later broadcast. Reports state that the talent used for the voice tracking is located in New York and Los Angeles. Formerly owned by Jacor. Light rock, Delila, Dr. James Dobson's \"Focus on the Family,\" and contemporary religious music on Sunday mornings. Sister station of WGST. Before about 1970, was religious WAVQ-FM when it simulcasted WAVO-AM. Until early '80s, broadcast Schulke easy \"All Music all the Time\" format which could be heard in the background almost anywhere one went in Atlanta. WSB-FM abandoned an easy listening format in the early '80s for a light rock format because it could not compete with \"Peach.\" WPCH later followed suit. When it entered the loudness wars with agressive audio processing, ads appeared in the Atlanta newspapers showing a female worker wearing a hard hat on a tower with the caption, \"We're working on our signal.\"\n\nSimulcasted Braves games with Jacor sister WGST 1992-1994. The contract with the Braves was terminated not long after the stations set the Atlanta/Fulton County Stadium on fire, almost causing it to burn to the ground.\n\nWoody Sudbrink bought the low power WAVQ-FM from Bob Jones University. General manager John Lauer increased the power to 100 kW, moved the antenna to a candelabra tv tower, and easy listening Peach became an instant powerhouse. Schulke-programmed, beautiful music format (\"all music, all the time\") created Atlanta's first FM success story. Station operated out of an old house behind Toco Hills Shopping Center until Meredith purchased WPCH as sister station to WGST.\n\n95.5 - WBTS - Top 40 Music - Athens\n\nCox Radio, Inc., Atlanta. Top 40 with an urban flair. Formerly country WNGC. In 1999, deep pockets Cox bought the station for $78 million with the intention of making it the best Atlanta rimshot feasible, within the limitations of keeping a city-grade signal over Athens and maintaining required mileage separations from 94.9 MHz and 96.1 MHz. This out-of-market signal will come in from the NE, and have its strongest signal in that part of the metro.\n\n96.1 - WKLS - Album Rock Music - Atlanta\n\nClear Channel Communications, Covington, KY. Formerly owned by Jacor. In November 2006, Clear Channel ended the 32 year album rock format on WKLS. The format was replaced with \"The Buzz\" from FM 105.3. The format is now called \"Project 9-6-1.\" In early 1996, Jacor purchased the former WKLS owner CitiCasters for $70 million. The \"K\" in the WKLS calls is for Don Kennedy, Atlanta's \"Officer Don\" on WSB-TV's Popeye Club from '50s kiddy television and host of the syndicated \"Big Band Jump\" radio program. Kennedy was one of the original owners of WKLS. The others were James Lathom and Arthur Swan. Thus the letters KLS.\n\nIn '80-'81, \"Electric Lunch\" classic-rock show weekday, noon to 1:00 pm. Rest of playlist consisted mainly of late '70s to early '80s arena rock. In '82 - '84, 96 Rock, under pressure from MTV and a growing Album 88, started to dabble in what would now be called \"alternative\" with a new-wave/heavy metal playlist. \"Wake-Up Crew\" introduced Atlanta to shock radio (albeit tame by today's standards), including \"Helium Monday\" (with djs on helium, who occasionally passed out on the air), \"Up Yours Friday\" (where callers could could give bosses, ex-spouses, et. al., a hearty \"Up Yours\" on the air), Mr. B and the B-Team, and Poetry Corner (recited rock lyrics with commentary). Dr. Ruth Westheimer radio sex advice show was short-lived due to complaints. \"Two-For-Tuesday\" started, which survived into the '90s.\n\nIn '85-'87, classic-rock, Big Chill, and boomer culture backlash led 96 Rock to dump new wave/metal for classic rock (\"Pure Rock & Roll\"). Morning shenanigans curtailed until the late '80s arrival of Christopher Rude and the rejuvenation of the \"Wake-Up Crew.\" \"Psychedelic Psupper,\" then \"Psunday,\" then \"Psaturday\" shows. Kaedy Kylie joined for PM drive and Willard for evenings (lately at Z-93). Demise and sale of WKLS-AM. Start of 5:00 \"Whistle,\" which lasted until around '96-'97.\n\nIn '87-'88, the conversion of Z-93 to classic rock forced 96 Rock to return to mainstream AOR. Morning shows started getting risque again. In '93-'94, the success of 99X caused 96 Rock to weight its playlist heavily towards alternative. \"Rock and roll from A to Y,\" because nothing good starts with \"Z.\" In '97-'98, the ill-fated Billy Bob am drive show replaced Christopher Rude, who was fired and rehired six months later for pm drive amid falling ratings and replacing Katie Kylie. In '98-'99, successful \"Regular Guys\" am drive show. Bizarre mix of political commentary with extreme humor that makes the Greaseman or Howard Stern look like Jerry Falwell. Refers to 99X as \"99 Excrement.\"\n\nIn the late '60s, the format was easy listening music with a big band flair. Don Kennedy hosted the popular \"Saturday Night Dance Party.\" There was a constant hiss in the background. Consecutive time and temperature announcements were made periodically by a female voice which had been recorded on tape. The temperature machine and the time machine ran at slightly different speeds so that the pitch of her voice changed abruptly between the two announcements. The time and temperature were given between every tune in the a.m. and during periods when the temperature was dropping rapidly on cold winter nights.\n\nIn the early '70s, the original station owners sold out, the automation system was abandoned, and the format changed to upbeat LP album music. In 1974, it changed to album oriented rock. Introduced Atlanta to risque shock radio in the early '80s.\n\nSkinny Bobby Harper worked here also. 96 Rock had to hire someone to sign the log and take the transmitter readings because Harper was a Canadian citizen and FCC rules prohibited non-citizens from signing logs and running remote controls.\n\n96.7 - WBZY - Light Rock Music - Peachtree City\n\nIn December 2006, Clear Channel moved its \"light rock\" format from WLTM 94.9 to 96.7. At the same time, the 94.9 format was changed to conntry music. Was adult contemporary WMKJ. Poor Atlanta signal. Formerly WCOH-FM. While still licensed to Newnan in the '80s, became WBUS (slogan \"come ride the bus\") targeting young urban audience. However, one couldn't get the signal on the bus and it ran out of gas. Current station general manager is the rotund former wrestling guru Joe Pedicino who hosted many nights of continuous wrestling on WATL-TV 36 and WUPA-TV 69 from the mid '80s to the early '90s.\n\n97.1 - WFOX - The River - Gainesville\n\nCox Radio, Inc., Atlanta. The suits who run Cox Radio have flipped 97.1 from Hip Hop to something they call \"the river.\" The change occurred in winter '05-'06. Their new motto is, \"You can bank on the River.\" In late summer '99, purchased by Cox from Chancellor who purchased it from Shamrock in 1995. Good rimshot signal in Atlanta. Converted from oldies to urban in the spring of 2003. After the format change, it's ratings fell by over 50% between Spring 2002 and Winter 2003. When WMXV adopted the format dropped by WFOX, their ratings in the Winter 2003 Arbitron book were 37.5% higher than WFOX, an all-time high for former classic-rock WMXV.\n\nWFOX was a good top-40 (including Casey Kasem) station from the '70s into the early '80s (\"North Georgia's First Rock\"). The tower was moved from Gainesville to Buford to get a joint Gainesville/Atlanta license and big Atlanta ad dollars, i.e. Tom Shane and D. Geller commercials. The tower move was coordinated with format change, first to adult contemporary and then to the present oldies.\n\nIn '80, WFOX carried Casey Kasem's American Top 40 2-6 p.m. on Sundays. Playlist was top 40, but was broader than that on Z-93. Poor Atlanta signal. In '84-'85, the transmitter was moved to Buford with a format change to AC (\"soft hits of 60s, 70s, and 80s\"). This lasted 2-3 years before a change to oldies.\n\n97.5 - WEGF - Religious - Fayetteville\n\nWas Hip-Hop/Rap WHTA, owned by Radio One, Inc., Lanham, MD. Upstart rimshot station had an ambition to dethrone urban WVEE. Was formerly oldies WQUL. Was WKEU-FM, then WQUL Griffin on 97.7 until purchased by Radio One. It is run by Mary Catherine Sneed (formerly of Summitt, V103, and WSB-FM, and was formerly married to 96 Rock former program director Alan Sneed, both formerly of WSM-FM Nashville).\n\n98.5 - WSB - Lite Rock Music - Atlanta\n\nCox Radio Inc., Atlanta. Sister station of WSB-AM. Competes with WPCH with rock for the dentist's office. Was almost an urban power (see AM 1380). When classical WGKA-FM converted to rock WZGC around 1970, WSB-FM interrupted its automation system to broadcast one hour of classical music each night as a trial balloon for that format. At that time, the main format was a combination of easy listening and popular music. In the early '70s, the format was converted to what was billed as \"Love Songs.\" It then changed to automated lush easy listening music. The advertisements on local TV for the station featured a man relaxing in a smoking jacket in a plush chair by the fireplace reading a book listening to the beautiful music of WSB-FM while smoking a pipe. Since about 1980, the format has been adult contemporary rock. The station manager was quoted as saying the easy format was abandoned when he attended a party where the host was playing WSB-FM in the background but referred to it as \"Peach,\" i.e. WPCH-FM.\n\nIn '85, Warm 100 listeners reported to Arbitron that they listened to \"Warm 99.\" Because WSB-FM was going by \"99FM\" at the time, this resulted in both WRMM and WSB-FM each getting half credit, instead of full credit for WRMM. WRMM changed to \"Warm 99.7.\" WSB-FM responded by changing to \"B98.5.\" At that time, the Atlanta AC market had 6 different stations.\n\n99.7 - WNNX - New Rock Music - Atlanta\n\nSusquehanna Radio Corp, York, PA. Calls were WLTA (easy, LTA = ATL backwards) when the station was locally owned by Eathel Holley who sold it to Susquehanna Broadcasting in 1974, then WARM (light rock), then WAPW (top 40). Converted to alternative rock WNNX (Ninety Nine X) around 1990. The top-40 format was then picked up by WSTR. After selling WLTA, Holley purchased WGKA-AM which he operated as an automated classical station until he sold it in 1997.\n\nIn '83-'85, had a rapid succession of calls: WLTA 100, Warm (WRMM) 100, Warm (WARM) 99.7 with the same AC format for each. In '85, converted to Power 99 with a format reminiscent of the original 94Q, i.e. a cross of AOR and top 40. In '87, the conversion of Z93 to classic rock resulted in Power 99 converting to straight top 40. In '93, converted to 99X. In '94-'95, had a short-lived Friday pm drive \"Swinging Velveeta Lounge\" show of novelty songs and old new wave.\n\nIn '67, the studio and transmitter were on Gordon Street in southwest Alanta. It was a modest little studio with an antenna on a Rohn tower about 150 feet high, not tall enough to have red lights or be painted orange and white. The signal didn't go very far in the days when an independent FM station in Atlanta didn't have a chance. After ABC introduced its now defunct variety of radio news networks that were programmed for different formats, WLTA became affiliated with the ABC FM network in 1968. The network was tailored for classical and easy listening formats.\n\nIn the late '60s, the format was easy listening. The automation system was programmed to play one advertisement and one vocal each quarter hour. On the half hour, Seth Thomas clock chimes were aired. In the early '70s, the transmitter was moved to the channel 17 tower on West Peachtree Street with the studios in a building near the tower. When the station was sold to Susquehanna in 1974, the format was changed to instrumental pop. The theme from \"Gone with the Wind\" was the station theme. By 1980, it had evolved into mainly vocals by artists such as John Denver and Barry Manilow. In the '80s, it became top 40 and changed to alternative rock around 1990.\n\nProbably holds the record for the most calls, most format changes, and the fewest owners of any current Atlanta station. It is still owned by Susquehanna since 1974 after successive format changes from beautiful music WLTA, to adult contemporary WRMM and WARM, to pop WAPW, and now alternative rock WNNX. The station ID was changed from \"Warm 100\" to \"Warm 99.7\" after the advent of digital car radios and penalties in Arbitron ratings. At the same time, WSB-FM changed their id from \"99FM\" to \"B98.5.\"\n\nSkinny Bobby Harper, Gary McDowell ('60s KHJ in LA), and Joel Goddard Neely are just some of the folks who worked at WLTA and WRMM. Steve McCoy, bounced from am drive at WAPW, landed at am drive at WSTR. Harper ended up working for MARTA and is now deceased.\n\n100.1 - WNSY - '50s and '60s Oldies Rock Music - Canton\n\n100.5 - WWWQ - Top 40 Music\n\n100.7 - WGHR - Diversified - Marietta\n\nSouthern Polytechnic State University. Apparently now off the air, WGHR now broadcasts only on the internet. Was 10 watt translator for WJSP, Georgia Peach State Public Radio. With only 10 watts of power, the transmitter had scant coverage.\n\n101.5 - WKHX - Country Music - Marietta\n\nABC Radio, Inc., New York. Formerly owned by CapCities until it was acquired by ABC/Disney. Formerly \"Georgia's Country Giant\" WBIE-FM (FM country when FM country wasn't cool) which was locally owned and operated by James M. Wilder who programmed an automated country standards format until his death around 1980 when the station was sold to CapCities. Before he died, Wilder was probably the oldest active broadcaster in Georgia. AM side was once WBIE-AM 1080.\n\n101.9 - WAZX - Hispanic - Cleveland\n\nPoor Atlanta signal.\n\n102.3 - WLKQ - Hispanic Music - Buford\n\nUntil spring of 2004, this family owned station programmed '50s through '60s Oldies Rock Music. The station was sold to a conglomerate and the format was changed to Hispanic music. Before the sale, the station was known as \"Lake 102.\"\n\n\"Lake 102.\" Poor \"rimshot\" signal in Atlanta. Licensed in 1972. Changed from a '50s - '60s oldies format to a '50s - '90s variety format on 01/03/00. Returned to the '50s - '60s oldies format on 01/15/00. The station is locally owned and apparently listens to its listeners.\n\n102.5 - WAMJ - R&B Oldies Music\n\nWas rock music WGHR, operating from So. Inst. of Tech. Calls said to have stood for \"Green Hornet Radio.\" Very limited coverage with only 16 watts. Has been given notice that a new station licensed to Mableton will soon occupy its frequency. WHTA will operate at 102.5 as does WTHA (see 107.5). Has construction permit to move to 100.3 at 16 watts.\n\n102.7 - WCKS - Adult Contemporary Rock Music - Atlanta\n\n102.9 - WMJE - Top 40 Music - Gainesville\n\n103.3 - WVEE - Urban Top 40 Music - Atlanta\n\nInfinity Broadcasting, New York. Was WAGA-FM prior to sale to Plough around 1960. To comply with the FCC's anti-simulcast rules of the '60s, transmitter and frequency were loaned to Ga. State Univ. where students programmed noncommercial top 40 music from 2 PM to midnight, Monday through Friday. The balance of the time, it simulcasted country WPLO-AM. In 1968, became Atlanta's first commercial underground rock station with an automated format that was locally produced and announced by Ed Shane, who is now a broadcast consultant. Rock format was changed in 1974 to country before station was sold by Plough and it became WVEE. Now owned by Infinity which purchased former owner Granum in March 1996.\n\nVic Aderhold (formerly of 1340 WAKE and later WPDQ Jacksonville) ran WPLO-FM during a transition period in the '70s.\n\n103.7 - WPUP - Rock Music - Royston\n\nPoor Atlanta signal.\n\n104.1 - WALR - Adult R&B Music - LaGrange\n\nDickey Broadcasting. Was Smooth Jazz WJZF, when it was owned by Cox Radio, Inc., Atlanta. Broadcasted from studios of WSB-AM/FM. Sales were handled by Dickey Broadcasting's Kiss 104.7 under an arrangement called the \"Atlanta Urban Radio Alliance.\" Good rimshot signal in Atlanta. Began as WLAG-FM, companion to WLAG-AM 1240 in LaGrange. As WJYF-FM in the early '80s, simulcasted big-band signal of former WJYI-AM 1080. In an effort to make the music sound more current, the bass was boosted so much that the music sounded as if it originated from the bottom of a barrel. Became Urban Kiss 104.1 in the mid '80s with the calls WEKS when the station was bought by a man named Xapis who moved the transmitter as close as possible to Atlanta. Then country WYAI Y-104.1 around '89 or '90 when it simulcast signal of WYAY-FM 106.7.\n\nThe former simulcast of 104.1 and 106.7 was a strange association between two stations. At one time, no two FM stations could be owned by the same owner if their interferrence free contours overlapped (1 mV/m or 60 dBu). Then the FCC changed its rules to allow two stations to be owned (or LMA-ed) by the same owner as long as their city grade coutours did not overlap (3.16 mV/m or 70 dBu). Because 104.1 was rimshotting Atlanta from the southwest (LaGrange), its city grade signal encompassed only the south/southwest part of the urbanized area. With 106.7 rimshotting from the northeast (Gainesville), its city grade signal encompassed the north/northeast part of the area. The two city grade contours fell a few miles short of overlapping. In other words, neither station city graded downtown Atlanta.\n\nSo, although no one else could own two FMs in the market at that time, it was permissible to own or LMA these two, but just barely. Other Atlanta stations put city grade signals all over the metro area, but these two did not, or not quite. 104.1 was strong on the southside and 106.7 was strong on the northside. So they simulcasted programming on the two, calling it Y-104 and Y-106. During commercial breaks, they split off and fed separate commercials to the two frequencies, enabling local advertisers to focus on their own areas. The presumption by locals was that the two frequencies had ganged up against WKHX in an effort to win the country battle. Now, 104.1 is owned by Cox and 106.7 is owned by Cap Cities/Disney which also owns WKHX.\n\n104.7 - WFSH - Religious Rock and Roll - Athens\n\nEdward Atsinger. Promotes itself as \"The Fish,\" more appropriately called \"The Holy Mackrel.\" Edward Atsinger also owns WNIV, WLTA, and WGKA. Edward Atsinger, of the political steering committee known as the Council on National Policy, is said to have bankrolled Republican Party campaigns in California in the '90s, including over $528,000 in '98.\n\nFormerly WALR, owned by Midwestern Broadcasting Co. until Cox bought the frequency and sold it to Edward Atsinger in late summer 2000. Acceptable rimshot signal in Atlanta. Acquired in the mid '80s by Charles Smithgall, III, then owner of WCNN-AM, and his partner Kim King, color announcer for Ga. Tech football. Studios were moved from Athens to Atlanta and transmitter was moved as close as legally possible with a light rock format to compete with WPCH and WSB-FM. The calls WALR stood for \"Atlanta Light Rock.\" Smithgall and King succeeded in obtaining the contract for WCNN to be flagship station for Ga. Tech sports, a contract which had been held for years by WGST. Although WCNN is 50 kW non-directional daytime, it is lower power and directional at night with poor coverage north of Atlanta. FM 104.7 was used to simulcast the night games of Ga. Tech sports in the area not covered by WCNN. Smithgall and King lost the stations in the early '90s (their company Ring Radio is now defunct) and they were acquired by Midwestern. WCNN's frequency was leased to Cox and the format of WALR was changed to urban. At the same time, WALR stopped broadcasting Ga. Tech sports at night, a situation which was certainly unpleasant to the Ga. Tech Athletic Association.\n\nFormerly WAGQ Athens when it was owned by McClure Broadcasting who owns the frequency of former WGST-FM Canton. The tower fell during construction, delaying the move into Atlanta market.\n\n105.3 - WWVA - Foreign Language Music - Bowden, GA\n\nClear Channel Communications, Covington, KY. In November 2006, Clear Channel replaced \"The Buzz\" format with foreign language music. \"The Buzz\" format was transferred to WKLS, ending the 32 year album rock format on that station. In September 2004, Atlanta's only fm talk station, \"Real Radio WMAX 105.3,\" flipped to \"WWVA Viva 105.3,\" with a top 40 Foreign Language format. Simulcasted on WVWA in Helen, GA. The former talk format lasted for less than 9 months.\n\nIn early 2004, 105.3 flipped from \"voice-tracked\" '80s Pop Music to talk \"Real Radio 105.3.\"\n\n105.5 - WYAI - Country Music - Carrolton\n\n105.7 - WMXV - Oldies Rock Music - Canton\n\nClear Channel Communications, Covington, KY. Formerly WCHK-FM. In early September 2000, converted to classic rock music format after the simulcast format of WGST-AM proved to be a waste of bandwidth. Converted to oldies rock in the spring of 2003 after Cox converted WFOX-FM from oldies to urban.\n\nGood rimshot signal in north Atlanta. Frequency was leased to simulcast AM 640 when it consistently overmodulated by about 20% with audible clipping on speech. Frequency is owned by McCLure Broadcasating. Formerly at 105.5 (3 kW) as WCHK-FM.\n\n106.1 - WSTE - Country Music - Toccoa\n\nWas adult contemporary WLET. Now country \"South 106.\" Owned by Southern Broadcasting which also owns sister station WTSH \"South 107\" (not simulcast). Poor Atlanta signal.\n\n106.7 - WYAY - Country Music - Gainesville\n\nABC Radio, Inc., New York. Formerly owned by CapCities which was acquired by ABC/Disney. Acceptable rimshot signal in Atlanta. Once was WDUN-FM. Locally owned as WWID-FM prior to sale to New City. Occupies tower with WFOX-FM.\n\nEarly '70s format was easy listening WDUN-FM. Became top-40 WWID \"Wide 107,\" then oldies, and finally country in the late '80s. At that time, the station suggested that their oldies listners tune in to WQXI-AM to hear their tunes. But shortly after that, Quixie in Dixie was gone with the wind.\n\nAlong with WFOX, WWID was another Gainesville top-40 station. However, the format was more like Atlanta's 94Q, whereas WFOX was more like the pure top 40 of Atlanta's Z93. WWID moved its tower to Buford along with WFOX for the same fiscal reasons at the same time. The move resulted in a brief change to an adult contemporary format (Lite 106) before changing to country Y106. Had Casey Kasem's American Top 40 in the early '80s.\n\n107.1 - WTSH - Country Music - Rockmart\n\nPoor Atlanta signal.\n\n107.5 - WHTA - Smooth Jazz Music - Alpharetta\n\nRadio One, Inc., Lanham, MD. In early summer 2001, format flipped to Smooth Jazz. Had been a low power translator, located on Tower Place, rebroadcasting WMBW-FM Chattanooga until late '97 when it became WTHA Alpharetta. LMA'ed by WHTA-FM. As of the summer of '99, the format, described as inter-racial Jammin' Oldies, failed to make the splash in the Atlanta market that the owners had anticipated. New consultants were hired to retool the mix of music and programming and the format became \"Magic 107.5 R&B Oldies.\""
