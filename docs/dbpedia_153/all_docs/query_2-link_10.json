Their CW stations (ours being WUPA) have not yet opted to pick up the programming. Keep in mind that WUPA dropped the Fox Box back in the day.\n\nI've tried to contact WATL's (former WB) owner, Gannett Broadcasting, about it.

WPSG's own schedule still shows them as showing infomercials though.\n\nDid they give any reason for not airing it?\n\nEven with them showing infomercials now in that time slot, you'd think that they could get more advertising money with airing programs people would actually watch.\n\nUpdate: Here's an article from yesterday (mirrored on WPSG's own website) about WPSG that mentions the Kids WB. While it doesn't say whether or not the Kids WB will air on WPSG specifically, it heavily implies that it will by saying it will air on the CW. If it won't air on WPSG, then this is one of the most misleading articles I've ever read.\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Sep 14, 2006\n\nlivingfruitvirus\n\nNo!
