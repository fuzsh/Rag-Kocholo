        "text": "By MixDex Article may include affiliate links\n\nCBS Television Stations announced today that it has hired 28 additional news professionals to support an increase in community-focused newsgathering as it debuts evening newscasts for select stations in 10 markets this week.\n\nThe new hires who are exclusively focused on producing these newscasts include multiskilled community journalists, anchors, weathercasters, producers, directors, editors, managers, a graphic designer and a multiplatform content coordinator.\n\nThe announcement was made by Tom Canedo, CBS stations president, and Andrea Parquet-Taylor, vice president, CW and independent stations news director.\n\nAs announced earlier this year, the CBS Local News Innovation Lab is supporting the production of hybrid, local-to-national newscasts for stations in New York (WLNY), Philadelphia (WPSG), Dallas-Fort Worth (KTXA), San Francisco (KBCW), Atlanta (WUPA), Boston (WSBK), Seattle (KSTW), Tampa (WTOG), Detroit (WKBD) and Miami (WBFS).\n\nWith the launch of “Seattle Now News at 10 on CW11,” this marks the first time that CBS Stations is producing newscasts for all 17 of its markets.\n\nThe one-hour newscasts are airing seven nights a week at 10 p.m. local time (except for WLNY, KTXA and WBFS newscasts that are airing at 9 p.m. local time).\n\nPreviously, several stations aired newscasts on a Monday-Friday basis. These programs include both hyper-local content that is produced by multiskilled journalists on the ground in each market, as well as content produced by team members at the CBS Local News Innovation Lab.\n\nOriginating from the lab’s home at KTVT and KTXA in Dallas-Fort Worth, the weekday editions of these newscasts are being anchored by Tom Hanson, who is joined by meteorologist Collin Myers.\n\nWeekend newscasts will be anchored by Trason Bragg, who will be joined by meteorologist Brittany Rainey.\n\nThe addition of the Seattle and weekend newscasts follows CBS Stations’ recently announced plans to launch a seven-hour morning news franchise on KCAL in Los Angeles, the hyper-local streaming and broadcast service CBS News Detroit and 9 a.m. newscasts on most company-owned CBS-affiliated stations this fall.\n\nThese commitments will increase the number of hours of local news produced by CBS Stations from 30,000 in 2021 to nearly 47,000 hours by the end of this year.\n\nThe New York, Philadelphia, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Francisco, Boston and Miami newscasts are also available on CBS News and Stations’ local streaming channels in their respective markets.\n\n“This is an exciting time for our group as we marshal our team at the CBS Local News Innovation Lab and newly hired colleagues across the country to create this ambitious model for producing newscasts that deliver a mix of hyper-local and national stories,” Canedo said in a statement. “Congratulations to Andrea, our team members at the lab and everyone in our local markets who is helping us bring our vision to life.”\n\n“It is an honor to be part of creating something that’s so unique and designed to provide the kind of local-to-national and even global storytelling that defines CBS News and Stations,” Parquet-Taylor said in the same statement. “We are pleased to have assembled an outstanding team of seasoned professionals, including my talented co-pilot (assistant news director) Josh Barlow, to serve as the backbone of this exciting venture.”\n\nHanson joined the CBS Local News Innovation Lab team after having served as a New York-based freelance anchor and reporter for CBS News since 2018. During his time with CBS News, he covered a wide variety of stories, including a rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes; the Hanukkah stabbing in Monsey, N.Y.; a deadly South Dakota plane crash; an Ohio manhunt for four escaped prison inmates; the nation’s opioid epidemic; scientific endeavors to document ocean health; and the El Chapo, Epstein and Weinstein trials.\n\nPreviously, Hanson worked at Channel One News, the American youth media organization serving millions of students across the United States. Before that, he was an associate producer at CNN in Atlanta and a news assistant in the CNN Washington, D.C., bureau.\n\nMyers moved to Dallas-Fort Worth from Houston, where he most recently served as a meteorologist at KRIV and, before that, KTRK. He previously worked for KEYE, the CBS Television Network affiliate in Austin, Texas, and WIBW, the CBS affiliate in Topeka, Kan.\n\nBragg joined the CBS Local News Innovation Lab after having been an anchor and reporter for WGCL, the CBS affiliate in Atlanta. Prior to that, he was a general assignment, consumer and sports reporter for KRGV in Rio Grande Valley, Texas. While there, he reported on the active local U.S.-Mexico border area, including stories about the separation of families, cartel violence, drug busts and human smuggling.\n\nRainey has been with KTVT as a weekday morning meteorologist since September 2021. She previously worked for stations in Tampa, Fla., Indianapolis, Ind., Tulsa, Okla., Huntington, W. Va., and Lincoln, Neb."
