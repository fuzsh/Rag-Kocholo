        "text": "Background\n\nRecurring building collapses in the nation’s Federal Capital Territory (FCT) capital city, Abuja, has continued to elicit mixed reactions from different quarters.\n\nWhile some speaking on the phenomenon, said that Abuja, like many growing cities is not immune to societal deficiencies occasioned by human errors others blamed it on Nigerians, including government officials’ penchant for corrupt tendencies and short cut to achieving a given task or mandate.\n\nArguing that incidences of building collapses in FCT were becoming too many, and that it underpinned laxity of regulations, given course for urgent action to be taken become its further degenerate, causing more harms and losses of both lives and property as well as huge investment.\n\nCOREN’s worries\n\nNew Telegraph learnt that most of the building collapses in FCT were either caused by faulty structural designs or compromised building code and regulations.\n\nRecently, the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN), expressed worries over the incessant building collapses, not just only in FCT but across the country.\n\nThe President of COREN, Prof Sadiq Abubakar, at a press conference in Abuja recently, said: “In Abuja, about 30 buildings have collapsed from 1993 until date, resulting in the deaths of more than 64 persons and injury to many others.”\n\nThe most recent building incidents in the nation’s capital include a two-storey residential building, which collapsed in the Kubwa area.\n\nNo casualties were recorded, as all the victims were rescued. Another one was the four-storey building, the Westbrook Hotel in the Garki area, where three persons were rescued.\n\nInsights\n\nSome experts in the built industry said that not until some crucial factors were addressed, building collapses in Abuja may not stop. A retired civil engineer, who pleaded anonymity, disclosed that he worked in the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) for 25 years, gave some insights into the challenges.\n\nThe civil engineer, who is presently a consultant to one of the foreign construction companies in FCT, said that many of the mass housing developers in FCT use poor construction materials.\n\nHe noted that there is no way substandard building materials, such as low-strength concrete and sub-standard steel, can be used to cut costs, without the consequences of building collapse. According to him, the Department of Development Control in the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) is a cartel, where people lobby to work, just to enrich themselves.\n\nHe stated that most of the infractions in development plans, and even the distortion of the Abuja Master Plan, were because this department has failed to be diligent in its official duties. According to him: “Because the officials of the Department of Development Control are not on top of their game, inadequate design and planning are often not given the rightful place.\n\n“While in service I have had the opportunity to see building plans approved without considering structural integrity, load capacity, and soil stability. ‘‘The officials who work in this department go to the site, compromise their oversight functions because of personal gratification.\n\n‘‘That is why you find unauthorised structural modifications; changes made to buildings without proper approvals and engineering oversight, almost everywhere.”\n\nHe further disclosed: “Inadequate supervision and quality control, as a result of lack of proper oversight during construction leading to shoddy workmanship.” New Telegraph’s findings also showed that there are other factors that were largely responsible for the incessant building collapses in the FCT.\n\nFactors\n\nThey include: unskilled and unlicensed builders hired to construct buildings, thereby compromising their safety. Officials indulging in bribery, negligence, and lack of enforcement of building regulations.\n\nWhile accusations of bribery and corruption against the staff members of the Department of Development Control have remained a regular feature in the building collapse trajectory, they have always struggled to wrangle out of the rope.\n\nThe Director, Department of Development Control, Muktar Galadima has always said: “After due diligence investigation, both the developers and staff who are found culpable will be prosecuted in accordance with extant laws.”\n\nHe has also remained fervent in disclosing: “That developers contravened several building codes and also violated the building approval given to them.”\n\nLack of inter-agencies cooperation\n\nSometimes building collapses were opportunities that revealed the deficiencies in inter-agencies collaboration. Many occasions the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has accused the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) of breaches in respect of areas allocated to it for mass housing.\n\nIn the recent past, the former FCT Minister, Mallam Muhammad Bello even ordered the arrest of FHA officers directly involved in the construction of a collapsed building in Gwarimpa. Results of a preliminary investigation was said to have shown that they compromised standards.\n\nThe then Coordinator of Abuja Metropolitan Management Council, (AMMC), Umar Shuaibu, disclosed that: “The entire Gwarinpa Estate, occupying the Gwarinpa II, Wupa and Bunkoro Districts of the Phase III of the City development, was allocated to the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) by the FCT Administration, to provide essentially houses and attendant services to the citizens.\n\n“They are to develop, control and monitor, to ensure strict compliance with the Abuja Master Plan, using the land use plan as provided by the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) as a guide. ‘‘However, this incident is suggesting that there are flagrant violations in the development guidelines of the Wupa and Bunkoro Districts as developed and controlled by the FHA.\n\n“Our preliminary findings suggest that there were breaches in the location, the building plan approval, the control and the monitoring of the development by the FHA, with glaring criminal tendencies by the developer, and or his representative during the construction activities.\n\n‘‘Also revealed was the glaring incapacity of the FHA to handle development control in Abuja and shoulder the responsibility of sensitive operations of this nature in cases of emergencies.\n\n“The Gwarinpa Estate is only a fraction of what constitutes the entire Federal Capital City adequately managed by the FCT Administration; however, many of these unfortunate incidents were witnessed there in the past. Hence, the FCTA’s resolve to revisit that mandate ceded, in granting development permit and control to the FHA in the Gwarinpa Estate.”"
