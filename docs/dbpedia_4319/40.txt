Elections

2018

Main article: 2018 United States House of Representatives elections in New Mexico § District 2

In 2018, Herrell was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives, and was defeated in a close race by political newcomer and Democratic attorney Xochitl Torres Small. The results were close on election night, with Herrell in the lead at the end of the night and some New Mexico media organizations projecting that she would win. The next day, more ballots were counted, narrowing Herrell's lead, and media organizations rescinded their initial projections. Absentee ballots made Torres Small the winner by 51% to 49%. Without offering evidence, Herrell alleged possible election fraud before conceding the race.

A 2018 Associated Press review of Herrell's campaign finance disclosure records found that she had failed to disclose that her real estate company earned $440,000 in contracts with two state agencies over five years. Herrell said she had submitted all required paperwork and that the allegations against her represented "an attack on my moral character" orchestrated by one of her opponents in the Republican congressional primary.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Herrell attended events that did not comply with public health measures to hinder the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and face masks. Explaining why she did not wear a face mask while in a public gathering, Herrell said, "I was at an event, yes; no one in the audience was wearing a mask, so I didn't feel as though I needed to wear one in that particular setting."
