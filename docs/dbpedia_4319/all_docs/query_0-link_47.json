Lt. Luse was born November 15, 1944 or 1946. I thought this was very sad and thought I would search for surviving relatives. My amateur investigation indicates that he was the son of William M Luse and Virgina Minner, born in Texas on 15 Nov. 1944 or 46 Married Sherry Janine Marshall in Jefferson County Texas in March of 1968 and divorced in Apr. of 1969 He married Debra Kay Davis in Surrey North Carolina on 24 Oct 1975 and Divorced 12 Oct 1978. Debra Kay Davis gave birth to Wayne Shawn Davis in Guilford, NC on May 11 1974 who may or may not be Terry Luse' son. My thought is that there may be someone out there who may have wanted to be at the bedside when Lt. Luse died last month in SC had they been aware of his passing.
