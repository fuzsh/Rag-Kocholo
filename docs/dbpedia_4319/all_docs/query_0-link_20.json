        "text": "With a heavy heart. I regretfully inform all those who knew and had fellowship with Kimberly Ann Richardson (Kim aka Mama Kim), that after four long years battling lung cancer, she succumbed to this terrible disease. Not in fear or sadness, but in the glory of her faith in Jesus and God in heaven.\n\nKim was born in the territory of Hawaii on August 18, 1959 and passed February 11, 2021 in Alamogordo New Mexico, but where she was from was not as important as how much she cared for each community she touched.\n\nAttempting to sum up her life and the people she touched is impossible. Our mother gave all to those she met. She made sure others were never wanting, even if she herself had little to give. Her laugh would spread to all around her, and you always knew that you could count on her.\n\nThe only sadness now is among those she left behind: her eldest son Charles and his wife Sam, her daughter Windy, her youngest son Daniel; her big little bother Cherokee, her brother Ray, sisters Kathy, Chris and Missy; niece whom she considered to be her daughter, Kristy, great niece Kalista, great great niece Kambri; good friend Lyn Buchanan and ex husband Gene Franks. She also leaves behind an army of nieces and nephews (and a few greats) whom she loved dearly. Countless others mourn her leaving this world.\n\nShe is preceded in glory by her mother Sandra Vaughn, her father Richard Smith, her stepfather Leonard Vaughn, her husband Ronald Richardson, her sister Roberta York, and longtime best friend Linda Buchanan.\n\nThe legacy she leaves behind is in her kindness, and one of her greatest wishes was for those to know to never take the time with your loved ones for granted. Be kind, and give to those in need.\n\nThe Richardson family has entrusted their loved one to the care of Alamogordo Funeral."
