Vaughn, Alamogordo, introduced House Bill No. 232 (HB 232) in the House of Representatives. HB 232 proposed that the song \"New Mexico,â by Calvin Boles and R.D. Blankenship be named as New Mexicoâs official cowboy song. If it was adopted it would have become the fifth song to reach official status in the state, behind the original state song, \"O, Fair New Mexico,\" (1917), the Spanish language song (1971), the state ballad (1989), and the state bilingual song (1995).\n\nIt would seem that a Bolesâ song was a natural for officialdom.\n\nCalvin Boles, who died in 2004, had co-authored the proposed song and was something of a local legend in the area.\n\nAn Alamogordo resident, he founded the Yucca Record Company there in 1958. Yucca Record Company released 237 singles including a couple of records by an El Paso fellow named Bobby Fuller of later \"I Fought the Lawâ fame!\n\nCalvinâs Band, The Rocket City Playboys, was busy too. It recorded eight albums. Calvinâs wife Betty played base guitar in the band.\n\nBetty Boles contacted her State Representative, Gloria Vaughn, about memorializing the work of her deceased husband and HB 232 was born.\n\nHB 232 was approved in the House, but not without some dissent. Three representatives nixed the proposal. Representative Candy Spence Ezzell, Roswell, was concerned that the specific song should be adopted without wider input.\n\n\"I am a cowgirl, and I have not been surveyed on this, and I think there are a lot of other cowboys throughout the state who might want some input into this.â\n\nThe bill moved on to the State Senate and there it died. At the end of the 2006 legislative session, New Mexico was still left without an official state cowboy song.\n\nRepresentative Vaughn was back in 2007 however. Again, she offered \"New Mexicoâ as the official state cowboy song in House Bill No. 81 (HB 81). But this year Rep. Vaughn could not even persuade the House to vote on her bill.\n\nAt this point Rep. Vaughn stepped back and, evidently, rethought her approach. On the day after the House Energy and Natural Resources Committee signed off on HB 81 \"Without Recommendation,â Rep Vaughn introduced House Memorial No. 70 (HM 70) calling for a competition to determine an official cowboy song for New Mexico.\n\nHM 70 set the stage for adoption of \"Under New Mexico Skies\" in 2009.\n\nA MEMORIAL\n\nREQUESTING THE NEW MEXICO MUSIC COMMISSION TO CREATE A\n\nCOMPETITION FOR COMPOSERS OF A STATE COWBOY SONG.\n\nWHEREAS, a member of the house of representatives in the year 2007 offered the state an opportunity to adopt an official state cowboy song; and\n\nWHEREAS, the state has a state song, a state ballad and a state bilingual song; and\n\nWHEREAS, a good deal of the controversy surrounding adoption of an official state cowboy song arose because of competition among composers who wanted to be known as the composer of the state cowboy song; and\n\nWHEREAS, the members may be able to agree on declaring an official state cowboy song so long as the process for selecting such a song is less arbitrary than by a vote of a majority of the members of the legislature, whose tastes and musical abilities may vary; and\n\nWHEREAS, the governor has created a state music commission;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO that the New Mexico music commission conduct a competition for a New Mexico cowboy song; and\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the competition be open to any person born in New Mexico or who has lived in New Mexico consecutively for the past twenty years; and\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the competition accept entries for at least six months prior to selection and that the winner of the competition be announced at least a month before the start of a legislative session; and\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a jury selected by the New Mexico music commission select the New Mexico cowboy song from among the entries, based on a majority vote; and\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that entrants in the competition agree to release to the state any rights to the song composed for the competition; and\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the New Mexico music commission present the New Mexico cowboy song to a future legislative session for consideration as the official state cowboy song;\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this memorial be transmitted to the New Mexico music commission, the governor and each country-western radio station in the state.\n\nThe New Mexico Music Commission accepted the charge requested of them by HM 70 and, on November 15, 2007, Representative Vaughn kicked off the competition at the Western Music Association's International Music Festival in Albuquerque.\n\nA competition deadline was set as November 14, 2008 and it was requested that all entrants submit cds or tapes, with proof of copyright, to the New Mexico Music Commission by that date.\n\nAccording to Polly Summar at the Albuquerque Journal, specific criteria had to be met that included\n\nTraditionality â Does the song fit within the genre of cowboy song?\n\nQuality â Is the song good enough to represent New Mexico in perpetuity?\n\nRelevance to New Mexico â Does the song adequately extol the beauty and benefits of our fair state?\n\nOriginality â Does the song have a unique and original melody and lyrics?\n\nBy the end of November, 2008, a song had been chosen.\n\nThe song was chosen by a small group of intrepid members of the New Mexico Music Commission who gathered at the Bataan Memorial Building in Santa Fe Wednesday morning, armed with chocolate and cookies. They listened to recordings from 26 entrants in the contest.\n\nPolly Summar, The Albuquerque Journal, November 20, 2007\n\n\"New Mexico,\" by Calvin Boles and R.D. Blankenship, had fallen by the wayside and Representative Vaughn brought the song selected by the New Mexico Music Commission before the legislature.\n\nIntroduced on January 28, 2009, House Bill No. 389 (HB 389) proposed that \"Under New Mexico Skies,\" by Syd Masters be named New Mexico's official state cowboy song.\n\nWith the backing of the New Mexico Music Commission, HB389 sailed through the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Bill Richardson on March 25, 2009.\n\nNew Mexico Law\n\nThe following information was excerpted from the The New Mexico Statutes, Chapter 12, Article 3, Section 12-3-19.\n\nCHAPTER 12 Miscellaneous Public Affairs Matters\n\nARTICLE 3 State Seal, Song and Symbols\n\nSECTION 12-3-19\n\n12-3-19. State cowboy song.\n\nThe words and music of \"Under New Mexico Skies\", written by Syd Masters, are declared to be the official state cowboy song. The words of the state cowboy song are as follows:\n\n\"(first verse)\n\nWhere the PiÃ±on Mesa rolls\n\nAnd the campfire cures your woes\n\nWatchin' the sly roadrunner flee\n\nOn the tail of an autumn breeze\n\nI'm leanin' against a juniper bole\n\nAs the creek water takes a stroll\n\n(chorus)\n\nThat's where you'll find me\n\nWhere the big back country lies\n\nThere the cowboy's free to ride\n\nOut under New Mexico skies\n\n(second verse)\n\nWhere the lean jack hops along\n\nAnd the coyote sings his song\n\nUp high the rocky spires shade\n\nThe sunny desert days\n\nI'm leanin' against adobe walls of old\n\nTheir stories to be told\n\n(chorus)\n\nThat's where you'll find me\n\nWhere the big back country lies\n\nThere the cowboy's free to ride\n\nOut under New Mexico skies\n\n(third verse)\n\nJust me and a covey of gamblin' quail\n\nLopin' down the Turquoise Trail\n\n(chorus)\n\nThat's where you'll find me\n\nWhere the big back country lies\n\nThere the cowboy's free to ride\n\nOut under New Mexico skies.\""
