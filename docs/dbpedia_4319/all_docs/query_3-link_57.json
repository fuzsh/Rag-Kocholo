        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nA new class of aspiring stars and mama drama are competing for your TV screen.\n\nDance Moms: A New Era premieres today on Hulu, and the latest spinoff turns the spotlight on Virginia-based dance instructor Gloria “Miss Glo” Hampton and her company, Studio Bleu. Hampton previously appeared with her daughter, Kaeli, in seasons three and four of the original Dance Moms series, and replaces embattled previous coach Abby Lee Miller, who served a year in prison after being indicted for bankruptcy fraud in 2015 and was diagnosed with cancer in 2018.\n\nAt a Glance: How to Watch Dance Moms: A New Era Online\n\nThe new reality series follows Lifetime’s two-hour special that caught up with the original stars of Dance Moms, including JoJo Siwa, Chloe Lukasiak, Brooke and Paige Hyland, Kendall Vertes and Kalani Hilliker.\n\nBelow, keep reading to find out how to stream Dance Moms: A New Era for free and where to catch up on past Dance Moms seasons and specials.\n\nHow to Watch Dance Moms: A New Era Online for Free\n\nDance Moms: A New Era is available to stream exclusively on Hulu starting on Aug. 7. All 10 episodes of season one drop simultaneously on the streamer. All eight seasons of Lifetime’s original Dance Mom series helmed by Abby Lee Miller can also be streamed on-demand on Hulu.\n\nNew subscribers can watch the entire first season of Dance Moms: A New Era for free with a 30-day trial of Hulu’s ad-supported base plan, which is $7.99 per month and includes access to award-winning and Emmy-nominated original series such as The Bear, Shōgun, The Handmaid’s Tale, Only Murders in the Building and more. Hulu’s ad-free package costs $17.99 per month and does not include a free trial, but does allow subscribers to download content to watch later offline.\n\nCord cutters who want to expand their streaming library can get the Disney Bundle Duo, which starts at $9.99 monthly for Hulu and Disney+ with ads. There’s also the Disney Bundle Trio, which comes with Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ with ads for $14.99 per month; while one of the best deals on Hulu right now is the Hulu + Live TV that includes live cable streaming, Disney+ and ESPN+ starting at $76.99 per month.\n\nDon’t care for live TV or sports? Another great streaming deal for movie and TV lovers is the new Disney+, Hulu and Max bundle that saves you 34 percent off compared to subscribing separately. The plan is $16.99 per month with ads or $29.99 monthly without ads; learn more here."
