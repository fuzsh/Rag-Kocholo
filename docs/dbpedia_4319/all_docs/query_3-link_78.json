        "text": "My story starts when I was 31 years old. I was having problems with my bowels and had to go to the bathroom everytime I ate.\n\nI went to my doctor and he ran test after test and could not find anything. He finally ordered a laparoscopy be done and they found my cancer.\n\nI had a total hysterectomy and 6 months of treatment with carboplatin and I was diagnosed as cancer free.\n\nI did some follow up after that, being 31 years old I did not think anything about having had cancer. I went on with my life and then gave up going to the dr. I did not see any reason to anymore, I was cancer free.\n\nWhen I turned 40 I started having my yearly Well Woman and mammograms done and everything was fine, including the one I had in January 2012.\n\nMay 29 of 2012: I woke up wheezing and had problems breathing and could not get in to see my family dr. as she was on maternity leave and all other drs. were full for the day. I decided to go to the walk in clinic. Something told me not to wait for an opening another day.\n\nI went in thinking bronchitis maybe, but more than likely an asthma attack because the pollen had been high lately and I had been doing a lot of walking.\n\nWhen the doctor came he he asked some questions and said he wanted to do a chest xray just to rule out a lung clot, since I had had cancer before. He was looking at the results on the lighted screen when I came out from getting dressed and before he could shut the light off, I saw a large round spot on the right side and believe me it was noticeable.\n\nHe said there was not a clot but he did want me to go to the ER and have a CT done just to make sure he had not missed something and to also have a breathing treatment. He told me I was not to go out shopping or even go home for that matter he wanted me to go straight to the ER.\n\nWhen I got to the ER they did a CT and they have me my breathing treatment and an injection for pain. Which by the way did help me feel better. The dr. came in and said that there might have been a little bit of lymph node enlargement and wanted me to get in and see my family dr within the next couple of weeks.\n\nI have never had a dr. tell me anything except at your convenience for seeing a dr. I knew something was up again, but what still not sure but have some idea.\n\nMay 31, 20012: I was able to make an appt with a family dr. for the next day and while in there had another asthma attack and had to have another breathing treatment. She then ordered a PET scan, this is where the warning bells really went off. I was lucky they had an opening the very next day.\n\nJune 6, 20012 Back to get results from family dr. Oh, forgot to tell you that I know what is going on before I even go in, I know that part of this is my asthma but with all the other tests that were done, my mind has been in overdrive just wondering what kind it was going to be.\n\nDr. give me the results that there are 4 different spots that are malignant on the scan and wants to send me to the oncologist who says he will see me during his lumch break that day.\n\nDecided to go the next day so the dr. would not have to give up his lunch.\n\nJune 7, 2012: Saw oncologist today. I have 4 spots, lung, right pelvis, base of spinal column and chest wall. My dr. does not think this is correct as I have no symptoms, do not look sick and it has been 17 years since I first had cancer, he is even wondering if it was ovarian back then, but of course it has been so long ago they hospital is having problems locating my files. Dr. decided to do a biopsy on the pelvis mass to make sure first and he will do a CA-125 at my husbands insistence.\n\nJune 11, 2012: I am at the hospital to have a CT guided biopsy done on my right pelvic mass. The radiologist comes in and says okay lets get you ready for the lung biopsy, so we have to stop there and get everything right. It turns out he will not do the pelvic mass because it is right next to an artery and he does not want to take the chance of puncturing it. The test is not the most fun, but the nurse, tech and dr. were great. The radiologist had a hard time getting any kind of sample but did get a little bit that was sent off, but came back inconclusive.\n\nOncologist office called and scheduled me to see a thoracic surgeon to have surgical biopsy done.\n\nJune 14, 2012: Saw thoraci surgeon today and after he spoke to radiologist that did lung biopsy he decided to do his biopsy on the chest wall.\n\nJune 18, 2012: Had surgery on chest wall today and they removed part of tumor. The lab in the hospital says that it is cancer and thoracic surgeon tells me this when he visits after surgery. Appt is made to see oncologist on 6/20/12 to get results.\n\nJune 20, 2012: No lab results to get yet. Dr. cancelled appt and made if for 06/28/2012.\n\nJune 28, 2012: Dr. says that yes I have cancer it is considered Stage IV Ovarian. Oh, and my CA-125 is 89, normal is 35 and under. He went over all the life expectanty stuff that my husband was asking and then we got down to treatment. He said we could do nothing and see what happens or we could start treatment. I said I already knew what I was going to do and my husband said he thought we should discuss it first, like there is anything to discusss. I know he wanted to be in on the decision making, but my mind was already made up and it was my decision to make. That may seem mean, but I did not want to wait another minute. Now we need the por-a-cath. I did not go with one the first time, but I will never go without one ever again. They make is so much easier. So back to the thoracic surgeon we go, oh but we have a problem, my thoracic surgeon is going to be out of town on Monday so he can't do my surgery, oh well we have someone new to do it. So off I go to see the surgeon to get info I need. While walking down the room to see the new dr, I see my surgeon and tell him I am mad at him because he is going to be out of town on Monday and can't do my surgery like he promised me but he said he could do it tomorrow Friday. Happy! Happy! You know how it is when you find a dr. you like even if you have only seen him 1 time before.\n\nJune 29, 2012: It has been one month today that I went to the walk-in clinic. My port-a-cath is being inserted today. Will not have to have a general anesthetic, but will be put out for a while.\n\nJuly 3, 2012: Went to see my oncologist today for blood work and to find out about my first chemo treatment. Blood work is fine and treatment is scheduled for July 5, 2012. I will get treatments every 3 weeks and after the 3rd one he will rescan and see if there is any change and if not will try new medicine.\n\nJuly 5, 2012: I am here and guess what, my orders are not signed. My husband is about to blow a gasket and I am one of those who says he will sign them, when he gets here. So the nurse takes us back to at least let us know what is going to happen and give us info on medication that I will be taking. The carboplatin I have had before, 17 years ago, but the taxol is new and it can cause an allergic reaction within the 1st 15 minutes of getting it if a person were to have one, so they have to watch me for the 1st 15 minutes once they give it to me. My oncologist finally shows up about 1/2 and hour late but my orders get signed and he is apologizing profusely. The doctor had told me I would lose tufts of hair, but the nurse told me I would lose all of it. We will see who is right. These infusion nurses are great. A 6 hour day turned into an 8 hour day with the delays, but it is done. I can now go home and see how I feel.\n\nFor the next couple of weeks I will be getting labs done once a week and then will have my next treatment. So far no real hair loss but my scalp itches like crazy. I did not get in to get my haircut before hand so there are strands of hair that just kind of fall out and it drives me nuts, so I sit and run my fingers thru it and even more comes out, but not enough to make a difference.\n\nJuly 26, 2012: 2nd treatment and guess what, as of today my hair is coming out in clumps, excatly 3 weeks after my 1st treatment. I will be bald within a couple of days, I guess the nurse was right. My brothers and sisters have asked that we move to Fargo be closer to them, so that if we need any help they will be there for us. Our son has been helping but he has to work and he can't always be there, so we decided we would and this way I could go to Roger Maris Cancer Center in Fargo. I am so excited. I very seldom get to see them. We have moved to Fargo and I can see new oncologist Dr. Preston Steen on Friday, August 17, 2012. This is the day after I should have had my 3rd treatment, but what can you do.\n\nAugust 17, 2012 Meeting Dr. Steen for 1st time today, with husband, sister and nephew. All we do today and is talk about his philosophy of treatment and what he thinks. He says he will do a total of 6 treatments and then rescan to see if any changes and then decide if they will change meds. He agreed with my 1st oncologist that I did not look sick and do not have any symptons. So we schedule my next treatment for next week.\n\nAugust 23, 2012: 1st treatment at Roger Maris and get what. Orders aren't signed, but does not take long for them to get signed and off we go. I thought the infusion nurses were nice in Bismarck, they hold nothing on these nurses. These ladies are great. When I left after treatment they actually hugged me. I love it. I have to have a xgeva and nulasta injection after my treatments and they sure don't make me feel good. Have to be honest in lots of pain from the meds, but expected that. Day 9-day 15 are usually the worst. The start date is usually day 10 like clockwork but can fluctuate.\n\nNovember 9. 2012: I had my 6th treatment on Oct. 25, 2012 and now it is time for another scan. Will get the results on the 15th when I am scheduled for another treatment.\n\nNovember 9, 2012: I got a call from the nurse practitioner. The tumor in my chest wall is gone. They do not know if they removed the entire thing during my biopsy surgery or if the chemo killed it, but there is some fluid around my lungs and a some lymph node change otherwise all else is the same.\n\nNovember 15, 2012: Saw dr. and he reiterated the same thing and said we would continue with the last 2 treatments as I can only have 8 of this combination. He is going to reduce it as my hands and feet are very numb.\n\nNovember 21, 2012: I had my 8th treatment the other day and am now here for my rescan. I will get the results after Christmas on Dec. 28, 2012\n\nDecember 28, 2012: Dr. is very pleased. Rescan is showing that the fluid from around my lung is gone and the lymph node and all other tumors have shrunk. We will continue treatment in 30 days as he wants my body to recuperate and see if some of the neuropathy disappears. Oh, by the way my CA-125 is down to 19, which is its all time low during treatment. The dr. did a CA-125 every 3 weeks and during that time it went up a little bit 2 times but went down little by little every other time. So I see my dr. on Jan 24 and at that time we will start the new treatment. I believe we will be doing some type of pill.\n\nAll in all I am very happy with the results but I also know that they can change at anytime and I will have to continue to be monitored for the rest of my life, however long that my be. I am planning on at least another 17 years.\n\nMy mother was diagnoised with level 3C ovarian cancer in December of 2006. I was out of town and was just utterly blown away at the news. I sat there amid shock and disbelief as my father tried to explain to me what the doctors plan of action was.\n\nMy mother had not been to a doctor since I was born twenty-four years before this. She had not had a pap-smear in ages or even a physical. Overall her health was always great. Never one to just sit and do nothing, even at 63 she was probably in most aspects, in better shape than myself.\n\nSo this news was completely out of left field. My mother had been having adominal pain for sometime, along with the fact that it was difficult for her to sleep and eat. For sometime she threw these symptoms to the back of her mind and would tell us she would get better, that it was just a virus. After her stomach had swollen to the size of a woman who could have easily been eight months pregnant she went to a local family doctor. The doctor ordered a ct scan and sent her home to wait. Although he had done bloodwork, he had made no mention of cancer or abnormalities. On returning for the ct results she was told she had a mass about the size of a grapefruit on her left ovary. I'll mention now that he was still not noting any abnormalities in her blood nor did he mention the fact that she had a lot of fluid in her abdomen. They made her an appoinment with an ob and a general surgeon to remove the mass. At this time they were still telling her the mass could be benign. When my mother finally got an appointment with the ob it was around January, at this time she was told she did have ovarian cancer and that they planned to do a complete hysterectomy and they would be removing the fluid that had collected in her abdomen. I'll mention now that my mother was told that she had advance cancer that had spread beyond the ovaries. Why she or how it came to be that she never shared that with us I still don't understand. But at any rate we were never told. My four brothers, father and myself were still under the impression that it was still contained to the one ovary and that during surgery it would be removed and all would be downhill from there.\n\nShe was scheduled for surgery the morning of Febuary 7, 2007. The surgery was supposed to only last four hours. We were all there awaiting to hear from her doctors in four hours that all was well and she was on the road to recovery. As the nurse called out our last name my father and I headed for the discussion area to speak with her ob. We sat in that room in dead silence for what seemed like forever before he walked in. I knew immediately things weren't as we had hoped. His face told the story of a man who was about to give us the worse news ever. He said that he hated to inform us that the cancer was literally everywhere. That if we could imagine someone turning over a box of oatmeal inside of her then we might get a clearer picture of what he had seen.\n\nThe cancer was a level 3c and that they had given her a colostophy bag cause of two small tumors on her colon that they were trying to avoid anything irritating. At this point I was spouting out every question that came to mind and Dr. Dean was very considerate and tried his best to answer every question to the best and fullest of his ability. They were going to give her a mediport under her rib cage that would shoot the chemo directly onto the tumors.\n\nSo back to the waiting room we went to tell our family members who were anxiously awaiting our news. Their reaction was much the same as ours; we were all devastated. As we sat there wondering why this had happened and what we were going to tell her thousands of things ran through our minds. We had come to the conclusion that we would avoid telling her the full details in hopes that if we only highlighted the positive she would keep in high spirits and fight this battle harder. Little did we know that she already knew and had chosen to deal with it on her own in hopes of not worrying us. I know that my mother had hidden the details from me cause I was pregnant and already having a hard time with premature labor and the babies' heart rate. I was due to deliver on March 3, but the plan had to be changed cause he was tachycardiac, I would be delivering February 22. I was so worried that she would not be there for this birth. As selfish and childish that I know that is, she had been there for every major event in my life and I would so miss her not being by my side to welcome this blessing. I knew her health was more important and her just being there to see him grow up was more important though so I pushed all that to the side and focused all my attention on her.\n\nThree more hours passed as we awaited news from the general surgeons who would be preforming the colostophy surgery and the internal flushing of the fluid. Our names were called again and this time I chose to wait where I was at and allow my older brother to take my place. They returned after about fourty minutes with huge smiles. I already felt the wait of that bear easing off my back. They reported that Dr. Mckimmie and Dr. Brock had removed all the fluid and most of the cancer that was left. They had high hopes for her prognosis and I was thrilled to hear them say that.\n\nIt was a while longer before they allowed us to go in and see her in her room. When we walked in I remember just wanting to crawl into the bed next to her and hold her like she had done so many times for me when I was sick. That wasn't even possible had I actually tried. My mother was hooked to a morphine pump, there was a tube down her throat to suction all the vile out and so many needles and bags of this and that; only the doctors would be able to tell you what it all was. It was at this point that I was just baffled and grieve stricken. I wanted to help but didn't know what in the world I could for her.\n\nBy the next morning she was sitting up talking with us the best she could. She sat in a chair next to her bed and I gave her a bath. The next morning she was asking when she could walk and when she could eat. She is a fighter and was determined to go home. My mother spent less than a week in the hospital. At home she was doing great. I volunteered to take care of her in anyway she needed. Along with each and every family member we have. My sister-in-laws cooked and cleaned for her. We all bought things that we thought would make her more comfortable. I suppose the hardest part was taking care of the bag. She was unable to change it by herself at first and I tell you with a honest heart it didn't bother me to do it one bit. It was the least I could do. I wasn't great at it at first but we got the hang of it, with the help of an angel named Charlene who had taken care of her father who had colon cancer when he had his.\n\nOn Febuary 21st my mother was scheduled to see Dr.Dillmon, her oncologist, to discuss her chemo options and starting date. I was in the hospital in labor with my son, my husband left and met her, my father, and brothers at the oncologist office. Soon after that the babies heart rate dropped and I was rushed to an emergency c-section. My son was born healthy and in the presence of my wonderful mother who had made it after all. I have two other children but I tell you now that his birth was a precious moment for more reasons than one. My mother calls him her heart, I often time see her just staring at him and I know what she is thinking cause so many times I thought the same thing. We three share that bond and nothing that has or may happen will ever take that from us. Soon my mother started chemo and the treaments were literally trying to kill her. The mediport done just what they said it would do it sent the chemo straight to her tumors were it collected in her stomach and made her deathly ill for weeks. She was hospitalized for days after her second round and at this point she was ready to call it off and give up. Her oncologist decided to go another route and infuse her intravenously. This plan of action worked out well for her. The ca 125 level had come down from the 1200 range to around 140.\n\nAfter all the rounds were done, her ca 125 level was down to 45. She had the bag taken off and the mediport taken out. While having the bag taken off and getting her colon put back together they discoverd that the cancer wasn't completly gone as they had hoped there was some residual and more chemo would be needed. Right now she has four rounds of chemo in again, she will be finshed in the spring. Today she found out her tumor count is down from 73 to 64, she had a ct scan and still some residual is there but other than that she is in perfect shape and on the road to remission. Its been a long hard battle but not nearly as bad as some people must suffer. We continue to pray that all will be done and over with this one day. As my mother would tell you herself all of this wasn't for nothing; we have met some very sick people along this journey and have been afforded the opportunity to pray for them that not only God heal them if He so chooses, but that He will enter their hearts and lives. That's my mother and so many members of my family's greatest joy, to share with others about Jesus and what he can and has done. I will be praying for all of you and your families. God is still into miracles and he can and will do one for us. I hope to write to you on here one day that my mother is cancer free, but if that day never comes I still know this; God has His loving arms around her and no matter the outcome He was there all the time.\n\nUPDATE 2009\n\nThis is an update to a previously posted story of my mother’s battle with OVCA. Since my last post my mother has taken a little turn for the worse. After responding so well to the treatments and her numbers going down, the doctor she was seeing at the time decided she would let her rest for awhile.\n\nDuring the break her numbers rose again and they chose to use Topotecan to knock the cancer out. Topotecan was not the answer, it made her deathly sick. After two rounds her numbers where steadily rising. My mother continued to have signs and symptoms of a bowel blockage. We would take her to the emergency room where they would tell her the x-ray showed a small bowel obstruction. They would admit her then the regular doctors would come and to say the bowel obstruction was open. This went on for months. Finally in November of 2008, her surgical team and oncologist tell her that her treatments were no longer working and that she had only a short while to live. We didn't take that very well, we were not ready for that. She went home hospice came out and went through all the details of this and that. Anyways, she was still in the fighting frame of mind. Daily she was praying for the answer to her problem.\n\nAs she was watching television she had seen a commercial for the Cancer Treatment Centers of America. We called and had all of her records sent to them. December she was set to fly out to see them. My mother and father are both sixty four years old had never been on a plane in their entire lives. I flew with them to Illinois. We saw an ovarian cancer specialist who was an ovarian cancer survivor herself. The hospital was so different from anything we had hoped for. It’s so far advanced in all technologies and treatments. It’s a whole mind, body, and soul treatment. I am so grateful, she decided to go. The doctor informed her that she did in fact have advanced cancer but that they were going to have to put a nephrostomy tube into her kidneys to drain them so that later they could but in a stint. This was performed along with the implantation of a port. She was put on tpn for nutritional supplementation. Things were looking up and she was actually doing a lot better by the time we had returned home. She only got the chance to receive the stint and removal of the tube and one more round of chemo before they found her in our hometown that she had a staph infection from improper cleaning of the port before administration of meds in the local ER. She was put in to the hospital and treated for the infection and blood clots that had formed around her heart as a result from the infection. She would have to wait for six weeks or more before she could do chemo again. Before the infection was completely gone she started throwing up all the time and it was fecal matter. She was admitted into the local hospital again and received a peg tube for decompression. Shortly after the peg was placed she was released to take chemo again. She had one round of carbo and we will return April 23 for more treatments. I hope all of this turns out well. I have full confidence that if anyone can make it she can. My mother is the fighter I hope to one day be. She never gives up and never backs down. Doctors here locally have told her to give up but she continues to strive on and prove them all wrong. It’s not all uphill and it’s not always easy to watch but she's surviving.\n\nI would recommend the cancer treatment centers to anyone. At the very least, research and find a cancer specialist in your area who you can trust. It’s a sad world that we live in that doctors will take your money and allow you to die while they do so. Some things doctors can't fix other things they can. I have left a lot of what we have been through with her oncologist out of the story. It’s been bad, no one should have to go through what she did with a doctor but I feel that telling that right now is inappropriate because God is seeing to her needs anyway. That’s a blessing that I thank Him for continually. However, the cancer treatment centers are a very good place to be if you have cancer. We have learned so much from them in just short amount of time and I am overly thrilled with their kindness and determination to cure cancer for everyone. One last plea, let’s get the word out there about ovarian cancer. There are woman who suffer this diagnoses somewhere every day. We need to push trials and clinical and research for detection and doctors have got to take the symptoms that woman have more seriously. It could ultimately save someone’s life. I am glad that all the breast cancer research has gone so well and that so much is being done to advance detection and treatment but we need to be able to say the same for OVCA. Remember we are the fingers that bind together to form that fist that will begin to beat cancer. Donate, advocate, and most importantly share what you know with woman in your life. Information is knowledge and knowledge is power. OVCA may whisper but we can still hear it...fight!\n\nUPDATE 2010\n\nUpdate since last time. My mother has been battling cancer since 2007. Since the last post she has tried several diffrent types of chemo at the CTCA. They now know that she is resistant to all but two types of chemo. As well she has had to undergo surgery to have catheters placed in both her lungs to drain fluid, the cancer has spread to there causing pleural effusions. Currently she is undergoing treatments of Avastin which to my understanding is a clinical trial for ovarian cancer but was intended for lung cancer. I truly hope this will be her cure. We can only put this into gods hands and wait for his will to be done.Sometimes I find myself wondering why anyone must suffer as much as she has, but in the end we have had longer with her than some people are afforded. I can only pray that each and everyone of you who have been touched by this or any type of cancer will find the cure. One day I hope that cancer is as treatable as your common cold. With all the research and trials maybe we are well on our way to that being a reality. My prayers and well wishes are with you all. Hang in there!\n\nPART I\n\nMy mom, Barbara, was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer stage 4 on February 22nd, 2005 and told she had maybe a couple months left. What can we do? Nothing really but I still want you to see an Oncologist. Off we went to the local cancer center....had more tests done and told maybe with some success that she might have a year or two. She started with chemo cheerfully. I was so surprised...I thought she would give up...fade away. But she told me that all her life she worried about getting cancer and now she had it so there was nothing more to worry about. She told me that as a child she visited a relative who was dying of some terrible disease-cancer. What she saw was a middle aged woman screaming from pain. She buried her grandmothers, father and husband and best friend who all had one form of cancer. Now she knew how she would die and would deal with this one day at a time. No more fear. She was going to enjoy what was left of life. She continued with chemo, her CA numbers dropped and then started going back up in September. They took her off chemo in November and got her ready for debulking surgery. On December 13th of 2005 she had the surgery. She was home in two days and back on her feet feeling the best she had in years in January. She said, \"If I didn't know better I would say I did not have cancer--I feel really good.\" In the past year, we lost a friend to ovarian cancer. We decided to plan a big family cruise in July. She slept alot on the cruise and had a reduced appetite; but would get up sit on the balcony and read each day, enjoyed the food, being waited on hand and foot and the company (good friends and her kids and grandchildren)-she had a great time...Over the next few months...we saw her little by little start to look more tired. The chemo was not working....they would do a few rounds, and the CA 125 Marker would go down then back up....she gave her notice for her part time job as our church choir director and went through the summer. She had an infection and had to be hospitalized in November for a week. In December, another friend, much younger died of cancer. In February of 2007 we did another cruise-she did okay but slept 75% of the time. But it was okay....now her legs are swelling, they are feeling things inside her abdomen, she had been short of breath and more tired. They did a pet scan last week and there is a big tumor which is impacting her colon and several in her chest where they do not expect to see re-occurrence of ovarian cancer. So in two days she is going for another biopsy. Is it ovarian cancer or is a re-occurrence of another cancer she had back in 2000-Melanoma stage I? We are praying that the doctors and treatment will give her more time-more quality time. Her attitude is so positive and happy. She is not letting this cancer define her....It is something she lives with and some days she hates it, but she is finding something wonderful every single day. I tell her that she is giving me a gift by being so upbeat, positive and by setting an example of hope and acceptance. She is embarassed by that. But she is my hero. And I LOVE her. Now we need everyone's prayers. My mom's life is in God's hands. Please keep her in your prayers.\n\nPART II\n\nWe were fortunate that my mom's biopsy came back as ovarian cancer and not melanoma as we feared. But the ovarian cancer was in a strange place; It was not where they expected to see it.\n\nShe continued to have difficulty breathing, tried another chemo which worked for a short time and to get more and more tired. Little by little she stopped doing things like her laundry, driving or cleaning up and then she ate less and less. Then we spent time at the hospital for a clot she had in her leg.\n\nWe started taking her to the hospital to have her abdomen drained of fluid every couple weeks. It gave her relief for a day or two before it started growing again and the legs swelled. The swelling got worse, she stopped being able to wear shoes or want to go anywhere.\n\nI think she really stopped eating in July. She ate a good plate full of food on July 1st at a picnic. She felt good that day, laughed and enjoyed the day. She seemed herself that day and continued to feel okay for a couple weeks. She even cooked for my brother's picnic on July 21st. But shortly after that she stopped eating and got very weak. Oh, she nibbled here and there and I would slice ham into small quarter size bits and wrap them individually. She would eat one or two and a handful of grape tomatoes. That was a daily amount of food she would eat. She also kept up on drinking energy drinks to help her stay alert.\n\nWe went to the doctor's in early August of 2007 and they told us that they did not have any more chemo treatments she could try. The cancer had become estrogen resistant and her body was not tolerating the treatments anymore. They told us it was time for Hospice to get involved. I remember her looking up from the wheelchair I brought to the nurse’s eyes and asking if she would be around for Christmas. They said probably not and she looked at me with tears in her eyes. It was the last time I saw her cry about her illness and dying.\n\nOnce she took in the news and met her hospice nurse she really perked up her attitude and became positive and happy again....as she had during her treatment. We planned big dinners every weekend, had a huge picnic over Labor Day weekend and had company in all the time. She loved the attention.\n\nOne day she said to me, \"my biggest regret in life is that I did not visit friends when they were sick as often as I should have. I was always busy with work or the family.\" She gazed at the flowers someone gave her and said, \"these are such an expression of love....I should have been more sensitive to other people's sufferings.\" I never thought she was not sensitive to others; we did visit sick friends and family.\n\nShe said goodbye to everyone and visitors left feeling uplifted and hopeful about everything when they visited her. She joked about and was incredibly candid about her impending death and openly shared her feelings with us all. I asked her if she was mad about leaving us while she was still so healthy and vital and she said, \"No, this is what is meant to be...it is my journey to take.\" She was so full of life even right before her death.\n\nOne day I was taking her slippers off and helping her into bed and I looked up and she grabbed my face with her hands and with tears in her eyes said, \"Thank you...Thank you for what you are doing for me. I can not tell you how much I appreciate this and love you for this.\" Those were not tears of regret but tears of love and I took that moment as a gift from her.\n\nIn the last couple weeks of her life she started to react to the pain patch. She was grabbing things with her fingers, almost like she was sewing. She even thought that was funny....she did not know why she was doing it. Then she saw people (like my nephew) sitting in the room...She began to talk to herself.\n\nIt got bad one night and she fought me when I tried to wash her up and get her situated in the hospital bed. I called the Hospice and asked them to find a bed in the Hospice Hospital for her and that I was near the point where I could not take care of her properly. My sister-in-law over to help and we got her settled and comfortable. She managed to tell me she knew she was not making sense and was confused. What I did not know is that she had asked the Hospice nurse that day to be moved to the Hospice Hospital as soon as a bed was available.\n\nThe following morning the Hospice nurse arrived and told us they had a bed for her. I felt relief but also felt bad. My mom would be leaving her home for the last time. A week before I had told her that I dreaded that moment when she would leave for the last time. She told me that death and life are a series of steps or notches. And told me that when she left the house for the last time not to think of it anymore than that....a notch or a natural step in life. When the ambulance drivers were taking her out that last day she actually grabbed my hand and opened her eyes and in her stupor said, \"It is only another notch.\" She was referring to the conversation we had a week ago...Imagine her-comforting me at such moment. Once she was at the Hospice they took her off the patch and put her on morphine instead her mind cleared. She stopped talking that much and every once in a while could speak or answer questions. She told me that her loved ones where there and trying to take her. She was afraid to go with them. She did not want to leave us. I went down a list of deceased relatives and friends and most of them where in the room. She had told me that her father was in the room and when she tried to talk to her he told her he was there to keep an eye on her and take her to heaven when it was time. In the mean time she was not to talk to him but to us. Our priest came down and we prayed with her at her bed. She tried to cross herself and seemed to relax. He comforted her and told her to go with them if they wanted her to go. After this it was difficult to understand what she was saying. We sat there, kept each other company and held her hand. It was a wonderful relief to have the staff to care for her and us. The night before she died everyone left one by one to get home, get the kids to bed and get some sleep. I couldn't leave, I wanted to share every last minute with her even if she was out of it. I sat there in the dark holding her hand and one of the patients in the room called me over. She said, \"What would your mother tell you right now?\" I said, \"she would tell me to go home, get some sleep and come back in the morning.\" She told me to listen to my mother. I was exhausted. This patient told me she would watch over her for me. What an angel. I reluctantly left and was back in the morning. It was so sunny outside. This Hospice is on the Long Island Sound. I looked out at the water in her room and saw boats going by, waves hitting the shore and sea gulls flying about. It was a beautiful day to die. My mom was awake and alert. I described what it looked like today. I smiled at her and told her that I loved her. She just stared at me. The nurse came in to clean her up...I went next door to the lounge and almost immediately she came flying in telling me to hurry up...that she was going now. I flew back into her room. Her eyes were closed but she clutched my hand when I held it. Her color got very dark reddish-grey and then the color left her face at the same moment she let go of my hand. I know this sounds corny but I looked up at the beautiful sky and in my minds eye saw her-young, beautiful, happy and pain-free in the sky outside her window. When I looked back down at her face she was just a shell. The beautiful part that was my mother was released. There was no sadness in seeing her like that. She was out of pain. And I was privileged to be there for all of it....from the day she was diagnosed to the day she went to heaven. Like so many people, I wish I hadn't needed to work and could have been with her the entire two years but she laughed and said, \"You must think highly of yourself to think I would want to be with you that much!\" It has been almost five months now and I have to tell you that I learned more about how to live from her death than anything else. You see, my mother did not let cancer rob her of her life. She said that she lived with cancer-not in spite of it. She took her treatments and followed the nurse's and doctor's advise. She called cancer her blessing and really enjoyed what time she had left. She didn't let her illness spoil any moment that was left-cancer did not win and that has truly been a gift to us. My mom was a retired therapeutic recreation director in a nursing home. She said that she learned about life and how to die from some of the residents there. One in particular taught her a poem about death:\n\nThe Beyond\n\nIt seemeth such a little way to me\n\nAcross to that strange country – the Beyond;\n\nAnd yet, not strange, for it has grown to be\n\nThe home of those whom I am so fond,\n\nThey make it seem familiar and most dear,\n\nAs journeying friends bring distant regions near.\n\nSo close it lies, that when my sight is clear\n\nI think I almost see the gleaming strand.\n\nI know I feel those who have gone from here\n\nCome near enough sometimes, to touch my hand.\n\nI often think, but for our veiled eyes,\n\nWe should find heaven right round about us lies.\n\nI cannot make it seem a day to dread,\n\nWhen from this dear earth I shall journey out\n\nTo that still dear country of the dead,\n\nAnd join the lost ones, so long dreamed about.\n\nI love this world, yet shall I love to go\n\nAnd meet the friends who wait for me, I know.\n\nI never stand above a bier and see\n\nThe seal of death set on some well-loved face\n\nBut that I think ‘One more to welcome me,\n\nWhen I shall cross the intervening space\n\nBetween this land and that one “over there”;\n\nOne more to make the strange Beyond seem fair.’ And so for me there is no sting to death, And so the grave has lost its victory. It is but crossing – with a bated breath, And white, set face – a little strip of sea, To find the loved ones waiting on the shore, More beautiful, more precious than before. Ella Wheeler Wilcox My mother asked if we could incorporate that poem into the funeral somehow. I had the last stanza embroidered into the inside of her casket and made home made thank you cards with that poem printed just inside. It says what she believed about death and wanted to share that with everyone. My wonderful mother and best friend: Barbara 1934-2007\n\nIt is a true statement that trials come to make you strong and God will not give you more than you can handle. My mother Vanessa (also known as Renee', Nessa, or Sister) is a social worker for an Institution for the mentally challenged for over 20 years. She loves her profession, because she loves working with and helping others. Many of the residents family members have treated my mom as if she was their own loved one. My mom also loves her church family. Being an Elder in the ministry, my mom ministers with comedy/simplicity. After being saved since 1975, she accepted her call into the ministry in January 1993 as an Evangelist. Working in the ministry was her greatest joy, witnessing to others about the goodness of Jesus, Love of God, and the gift of salvation.\n\nHer desire was to see her family and friends accept Christ and live a life pleasing to him. My mom is a mother of two girls and 7 grandchildren. She is a graduate of VSU with a Masters in Sociology. She has spent the last 20 plus years of her life working in the ministry.\n\nIn April of 2005 after 5 months of being terribly ill she was diagnosed with OVCA Stage 3C.\n\nAt the time of her diagnosis, I had NEVER heard of Ovarian Cancer. The five months prior to her diagnosis, she had experienced severe abdominal pain, constipation, body aches, bloating, and very little appetite. She was misdiagnosed several times with IBS. After being treated for IBS, she found no relief in the medications and went for a second opinion. While awaiting the appointment for the second opinion she was seen in the Emergency Room three times in one weekend. She was referred to Johnston Willis Hospital where test results showed OVCA.Her CA-125 was well over 6,000. We were devastated. All all-points prayer ALERT was sent out throughout our community. I do not think I have ever heard of sooo many people praying for one person. God is good. A date for surgery was set, and my mom put her hands in God hands. Debulking surgery was done 4 days later and there were two large tumors removed. Following the surgery she had to wear a colostomy because of the damage caused to her colon\n\nby the tumor. A second surgery was done for a total hysterectomy. Chemo began three weeks later with her first round of carbo/taxotol. The cancer count began to drop from the hundreds to double digit numbers. We praised God!!!\n\nThroughout the first six months of this ordeal, people everywhere had rallied around my family to pray for the healing of my mother. Cards poured in from everywhere with believers/non believers praying and trusting God for a miracle. The Dr.'s had informed my family that my mom was a very sick woman and if we were any later getting her diagnosed she would'nt have made it. My mom began to quote..\"See Tee I am still here.\"\n\nOver the next couple of months my mom had several changes to take place in her health. Chemo made her sick and unable to work most of the time. In her spare time she would minister to those she came in contact with, and use her personal testimony as a foundation to display the \"Love, Grace, Mercy, and the Goodness of God\". She also used every opportunity to share awareness of Ovarian Cancer. Her lapel usually was accented with a teal colored ribbon.\n\nIn the beginning of 2006, my mom's body began to resist the chemo, her chemo was changed to Cisplatin/Gemzar. We were told that it is the strongest Chemo they had for her. After her first round of cisplatin, she was up and running, driving her new car, visiting the sick, attending 5 am prayer service, and using her time to minister to others, and enjoy the company of friends, fellowship with co-workers and attend Bible Study with me at my church. In March 2006 she was awarded Covenant Sister of the year at her church and given a crown. She had the opportunity to minister at A Women's Conference in March. Her body afflicted with a fever of 101, she ministered anyway. Delivering a powerful message from the book of Esther.\n\nAfter receiving numerous reports that that her body was not responding to the chemo, we still continued to TRUST GOD that he would heal her and deliver her from this infirmity. Chemo was changed to cisplatin/Gemzar and there was still no change.The Ca-125 count continued to rise. A prayer group in Richmond VA began to fast band pray weekly for my mother's healing. Members of my church & (no doubt) my mom's church began to stand firm on the word of God that Elder Marshall would be healed. In mid-April the tumor then produced a bowel obstruction in April 2005, which resulted in a peg-tube for drainage.\n\nBecause of the peg tube, my mother was only to have clear liquids for her diet. I remember telling her..One more challenge, one more miracle..She called me her cheerleader.\n\nThree weeks after this she began having complications with the peg tube. She began to vomit several times a day. My mom lost so much weight, and most of her strength, but not her faith and trust in Christ Jesus. The more medical challenges she faced, the stronger her confession became that \"God will do what he said he will do\". As of today's date, my mom has been hospitilized for 23 days. She is now on oxygen, has a drainage bag for for the ascities, and is taking morphine to ease the pain. Family, friends, co-workers, and other believers embrace her with the Love she has displayed and generously given to them over the years. Her hospital room has been used a place of ministry, where you can feel the presence of God, even in this challenging time. Many come to pray and support her, and she in turn prays for and encourages her visitors. Her dream to begin a Cancer Awareness & Christian Support group has already began within the room in the Womens Health Unit of JWMC.(Hope) Helping Others Patiently Endure) Her window is filled with cards of prayers, scriptures, and love, while another window is filled with beatiful flowers. The gyn-Onc Dr has told us that he has done all that he is able to do. At this point my family is making arrangements for my mom to have Hospice. Although we do not know what tomorrow holds, we know who holds tomorrow. Many lives are being touched right now by the ministry of One of Gods Messengers, Elder Vanessa R. Marshall. Even in the face of hardship you will hear her hum or sing \"Oh how I loved Jesus..Oh How I love Jesus..Oh How I loved Jesus because he first Loved Me.\" I cannot say I will not miss my mom, I know I will. We have come a long way in the past 6 years. God has restored a broken relationship and made it into a beautiful centerpiece of the Works of the Masters Hands. We do not look back at what we could have had, but what we are able to enjoy whenever God calls her home. All I can say is that God doesn't make any mistakes. Within are many unanswered questions, maybe to be answered, and maybe not... In this entire ordeal with OVCA I have seen God's mighty hand move in so many ways. I pray for all those who have lost a loved one with this horrible disease. What makes it so horrible is because it is silent, the symptoms whisper...you can be easily misdiagnosed, and when you find out the dignosis, seldom times, it is already spread. My prayers are with you all. We cannot thank God enough for ALL those who have prayed, supported, encouraged, and embraced my family in this last year. I know God has a special reward for you all. Especially the women of the OVCA Message Board who check-in to be a shoulder to cry on, and to share information that you may not recieve from the doctors. May God bless all the survivors of OVCA, Caretakers, family members, and Onc-Gyn doctors who (those who do)do ALL they can for their patients. We believe that if God doesn't reveal the manifestation of my mother's healing on this side, that we will witness her healing in Glory! She is running the race, fighting a good fight, and she is enduring in grace and with patience. I know she will hear the Master say Vanessa...Well done my good & FAITHFUL servant..Well Done. Please keep us in your prayers.\n\nThe Brown, Marshall, and Johnson Families\n\nUPDATE:\n\nOn June 12, 2006 at 10:10 p.m., the Lord in his infinite wisdom called home one of his own messengers, Elder Vanessa R. Marshall. After a fourteen-month battle with Ovarian Cancer stage 3c, she ran the race, she fought a good fight, and now a crown of rightousness is stored for her. God knew what was best. The Lord used her hospital room as a place of ministry as she ministered to all those who entered her room. Lives were changed by the grace, compassion, and love displayed by Elder Marshall. Even while she was too weak to speak, when she did have the strength she hum or sang \"Oh how I love Jesus\". She made an effort to minister with the power of God, and the presence of the Holy Spirit. I do not know what tomorrow holds, but I do know who holds tomorrow. Elder Marshall leaves a rich legacy for her children and grandchildren. She has left precious memories for those who knew her. The Lord used the people of God to provide round the clock care for Elder Marshall. She was given back all that she had given to others. Special blessings upon those who sacrificed their time to sow in the life of this great woman of God, my mother aka V-butterfly.\n\nDonations may be made in lieu of HOPE:\n\nHelping Others Patiently Endure, a Christian Cancer Support Group 49 Walnut Blvd. Petersburg,Va 23803\n\nI was 10 years old when I first started menstruating. At the time, my mother was dying of brain cancer. I can remember being so upset that something was happening to me, also, and was afraid to tell my father. He found some of my bloody underwear, which I was hiding from him, and had a female friend of the family tell me the facts of life because my mom was too sick.\n\nI didn’t have an easy time of young womanhood. My periods were painful and heavy. I would spend the first day of every cycle lying in bed with a heating pad on my stomach and making frequent trips to the bathroom to throw up. I missed a lot of school during my teen years. People would tell me that it was all in my mind, and if I would just get up and stay active, the pain would go away. I was taken to an osteopathic doctor for my first internal examination, and he put me on birth control pills to take care of the cramps. I was 13.\n\nI met my future husband when I was 16 and he was 21. We were married in 1972 when I was 19. After four years, I had my first pregnancy. I miscarried at three months. After a few months of letting my body get back to normal, I was able to conceive again. Except for occasional nausea, I had an uneventful pregnancy. Six months into my pregnancy, I noticed some spotting and after telling the nurse at work, I was told to drive to my Gyn’s office. He diagnosed an incompetent cervix and said he would have to perform a Shirodkar that day. I couldn’t locate my husband, so I drove myself to the hospital. I can remember crying and praying on the way that God would let me have this baby. Thankfully, God heard my prayers and three months later, in 1976, I had a healthy, beautiful baby boy. I was able to conceive again, had another Shirodkar in my third month of pregnancy, and in l978, delivered another healthy, beautiful baby boy!\n\nAfter my two successful pregnancies, the periods would still be painful and heavy. I faithfully made my yearly visits to the Gyn. One day I got a call from the office that my pap smear showed pre-cancer cells. The report had been sitting on the doctor’s desk for a week before they called to inform me of the results. I was upset about that, and decided to change to another Ob/Gyn practice. Eventually, after years of complaining of heavy bleeding and cramps, I had a laparoscopy and was diagnosed with endometriosis, and I also had a fibroid. The Gyn told me I had high levels of estrogen. I was given injections of a powerful drug called Lupron, which puts the body in a menopausal state. I had these injections every month, for six months. Everything seemed to be under control for a while, but the heavy bleeding and cramps came back, and I started complaining of spotting between periods. I was having regular endometrial biopsies and was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia. The Gyn prescribed medroxyprogesterone, 10 mg., to control my irregular bleeding.\n\nI started keeping notes of my irregular bleeding and presented them to my Gyn during a routine office visit. I can remember asking her if I should have a hysterectomy, since I seemed to be plagued with this diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia. I was in my late forties now, and I surely wasn’t going to have any more children. She told me that it wouldn’t be a good idea, that it was major surgery and she didn’t think it was necessary.\n\nAround 1998, I wasn’t feeling well in other areas of my body. I started experiencing indigestion and gas and I was popping Tums and over-the-counter gas medications like crazy. I also started noticing an odor in my nose and this led me to an ear, nose and throat doctor. The odor scared me because I remembered that my mom smelled an odor when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. After ordering a CT scan of my sinuses that showed everything to be normal, he suggested I see a gastroenterologist. He thought the odor might be coming from my stomach. In the meantime, he prescribed Zantac for my acid reflux. When the prescription for the Zantac ran out, I was still experiencing indigestion and gas. I started eliminating certain foods from my diet to see if it would help. I found Romaine lettuce to be more tolerable than Iceberg lettuce and always use that when there is a choice. I was making homemade soups, using recipes from health food cookbooks, drinking lots of water and exercising, but nothing seemed to help. When I turned 50, I finally got up the nerve to go to the gastroenterologist. In March 2003, I had a colonoscopy and an endoscopy. I had one polyp that was removed on the spot and declared negative for cancer. The endoscopy was normal. The gastroenterologist prescribed Zantac and said, “See you in five years.”\n\nI had my yearly Gyn appointment in early April 2003. I mentioned to her that I had a lot of pain in my left side and was having gastrointestinal problems. She ordered a sonogram during which they inject a saline solution in the vagina. They found a cyst on my left ovary, which concerned them because it was large. The doctor said they would do another sonogram in three months to see if it was still there. The same month, my Gyn also performed a D&C because I was still experiencing unusual bleeding between periods. I was diagnosed with endometrial polyps and a thick endometrial lining (hyperplasia). It was back to taking the medroxyprogesterone. They kept an eye on my left ovarian cyst with sonograms and it finally disappeared, but I developed three more cysts in my right ovary. That was in June 2004. They told me these were small and it was not a concern. They would keep an eye on them.\n\nIt was a beautiful fall weekend in October 2004. After a four-hour drive, we finally arrived in the “Happy Valley” for a Penn State football game and tailgating party. I was so excited. It was going to be fun! Unfortunately, I was getting my period–or so I thought–because it was hard to tell these days since my periods were so irregular. When we arrived at the motel, I just wanted to have a cup of hot tea because I was having some cramping and felt bloated. My husband managed to get me a cup of tea from the office manager. I sat in the chair drinking my tea while my husband got ready for bed. It was a long night. I can remember curling up in the fetal position, not feeling well and having a lot of pain. I was taking ibuprofen every 4 hours. I managed to have fun the next day at the tailgating party, thanks to the ibuprofen. The football game was exciting, although the icy cold bleachers seemed to send a chill right up my buttocks into my back. I continued to take the medication for the pain and got through the weekend without a complaint. When it was time to go back to work on Monday, I knew I had to do something because I was still in pain. It was getting hard to walk! I called my primary care physician’s office and made an appointment with the nurse practitioner for that afternoon. I give her the credit for saving my life. When I explained my pain to her, she felt my right side and told me she thought it was my ovary. She ordered an ultrasound at the hospital, had a nurse draw blood for a CA125 blood test and told me to call my Gyn’s office and make an appointment with whoever could see me ASAP. (Prior to this, no doctor had ever ordered a CA125 blood test. When I had asked about it some time before, my Gyn had replied. “It’s not routinely given because it’s prone to false positives.”) When I got home that Monday night, there was a message on my answering machine from the nurse practitioner. She wanted me to call her at the office. She’d be there until 7:00 pm. I immediately picked up the phone and called her. She told me the ultrasound showed a mass and asked me if I had been able to get an appointment with the Gyn. I said I had one for that Wednesday with someone other than my regular Gyn. The Gyn examined me that Wednesday and ordered a CT scan. When the results came in, he called me and told me I had endometrial hyperplasia suspicious for adenocarcinoma. It could be endometrial cancer. My CA125 was also elevated to 98. I was advised to have a total hysterectomy. He said the cancer was probably contained in my uterus, but staging would be done during the surgery. They suggested I see a gynocologist/oncologist and gave me the name of someone well respected in the area.\n\nI saw the gynocologist/oncologist. in mid November 2004 and he agreed with the diagnosis. He also found a polyp on the inside of my cervix, that was hanging out through the cervix It later tested positive for cancer. On December 14, 2004, I had an “exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, tumor debulking, hysterectomy, resection of multiple peritoneal disease, bilateral ureterolysis, resection of bowel nodules times two, one with enterotomy and repair, radical omentectomy, appendectomy, and retroperitoneal extensive lymph node dissection.” I was 51 years old. At the conclusion of the surgery, there was “No gross residual disease left behind.” They told my husband that they found cancer in my uterus and both ovaries, but the pathology report would be more specific. I tried not to think about what they might have found for the next couple of weeks. After all, Christmas was right around the corner!\n\nIn early January 2005, I was given the good news--if you can call a cancer diagnosis “good news.” I had stage 1C endometrioid-type ovarian cancer in both ovaries, FIGO grade 1 tumors, and stage 1C endometrioid-type endometrial cancer, FIGO grade 1 tumor. I had extensive endometriosis. So, later that month, the gynocologist/oncologist put a port-a-cath in my chest, and I received six monthly rounds of chemotherapy (Taxol/Carboplatin). I was thankful that we caught it early. My gynocologist/oncologist. told me my 5 year survival statistics are 95-98%. I just had a checkup in October 2005 and everything looks good. He said I have a small pocket of fluid on my left side, which is normal and he isn’t concerned about it. My CA125 is now down to 8.3. I’m very thankful that my chemotherapy is over and things are looking up. The chemotherapy did not keep me from working. I was able to hang onto my job, thanks to the kind people who did my job for me when I wasn’t feeling well. My hair is growing back now, and I love having eyelashes and eyebrows again! You learn to be thankful for the smallest things. I intend to be here to see my sons get married some day, and to look forward to many more years with my husband. I’m happy to be alive!\n\nMy suggestions:\n\nKnow these early warning signs of Ovarian Cancer:\n\nIndigestion\n\nGas\n\nBloating\n\nNausea (I didn’t have this)\n\nSometimes Pain (I was very lucky to have this)\n\nConstipation or Diarrhea (I had occasional constipation)\n\nI also recommend an ultrasound procedure where you drink 32 oz. of water an hour and a half before your appointment. The technician told me they get a clearer picture that way. Many doctors are in disagreement with this, but the ultrasounds I was having at my Gyn’s office did not require drinking the water. The hospital’s ultrasound did require drinking water and that is the one that revealed the mass.\n\nFinally, don’t take “No” for an answer if you feel that there is something wrong. You know your own body better than anyone else. Listen to it!\n\nLovingly submitted by\n\nBarbara\n\n\"A YEAR OF HELL\"\n\nBy Shelby, Judy's daughter\n\nWe knew there was something wrong in July of 2002, when my mother who was way beyond menopause, had her period and her abdomen was swollen to look like she was three months pregnant. She went to the doctor and all of our worst fears came true; it was cancer and it was in her ovaries. The news came as a shocking blow, like we had just been run over by a speeding truck. This only happens to other people, but no, it was happening to us and this is where my mother's \"year of hell\" began.\n\nAbout two weeks after getting the news, she had an appointment to get rid of everything that made her a woman. What we didn't know was that the tumour had already grown large enough to attach itself to her bowel. The cancer had already spread to other parts of her body. The operation went as planned, or so we thought. After the operation, we went to see her and she was in very good spirits. She didn't even complain of pain but that was my mother; anyway you never could tell if she hurt or not.\n\nA little while later she was able to go home. I will never forget the tone in her voice when she went home, she was like a little girl in a candy store, so excited to be there. Then the chemo started. It was six months of once a month treatments. The chemo treatments were two and a half hours south of where they lived. So, once a month my father would drive her down there. My father. Now there is a man of every woman's dream. He is the type of man who would bend over backwards for you and not ask questions. My mother was so lucky to have him.\n\nMy mother was receiving the strongest chemo you could get because she had the fast action cancer. I remember during those six months she was tired and sick from the chemo. Some days she would just feel tired and other days she could barely get up in the morning but the doctors said if she didn't have the chemo she would not be with us today.\n\nAfter the six months of chemo, she had a two-month break and then the radiation began that was across the country. It took a five-hour plane ride to get there. I was writing her e-mail letters all the time. She seemed very happy in her e-mails. My mother had two months of radiation and when she came home, she was a brand new woman. She had a new outlook on life. She and I bonded the way I have always wanted to bond with her. It was the best time of my life. Then three months later she started getting sick again. We were told it was a side-effect of the radiation. I remember being on the phone with her telling her to get to a doctor but she would just come back with, \"I just got back from there a week ago.\" My mother was very stubborn.\n\nThen there was a phone call I will never forget. I was talking to her and she didn't sound like her; her words were very slow and she was slurring. When I got off the phone, I said to my sister, \"Mom does not sound right.\" That night she went back into the hospital; after many tests we found out why she sounded the way she did. Her calcium had shot up through the roof. The doctors said they had never seen anyone alive with that high calcium before.\n\nThe day she went into the hospital, I was going out of town for three weeks to see a friend, so I gave my sister the phone number and told her to keep me posted. After about two weeks of me being at my friends, my mother was moved to the same town I was in, to get more tests. I called her almost every day to tell her how I was doing and to see how she was. Then one cloudy day my sister called me and told me that my mom had three days to live. I broke down in tears on the phone. My friend was sitting beside me. She held my hand not knowing what was said to me. After a while, my sister and father came to get my son and I. Then off we went to the hospital to go see my mother.\n\nWhen we got there, I didn't know what to expect. We walked into her room and the woman lying in the bed was not my mother. It was some other woman who was very pale and thin. I didn't want to believe that the woman who was lying there was my mother. I sat beside her. My sister sat beside me and my father sat on the bed. She looked at us and said, \"I have no I idea on what's going on. They said if this chemo doesn't take then there is nothing more that they can do.\" Thankfully that chemo worked. But the chemo was killing her blood so she didn't want it after that.\n\nTwo weeks later, she was transferred back to the hospital close to her home. After a few days stay, she was allowed to go home. It was nice seeing her outside of a hospital and it was especially nice seeing her in her own element. She was home for at about a week. Then one day, the following week, my mother got up to go to the bathroom, fell down and she could not get back up. My father came in to help her up and put her back in bed. Then my mother said to him that she could not move and that she thought it would be best to go to the hospital.\n\nI called my father that day and I knew something was wrong the minute he answered the phone. He had a panic tone to his voice and I knew it was mom. I asked him what was going on. He said that mom couldn't get out of bed and that he was going to call 911 to get her to the hospital and that's what he did.\n\nMy sister, who was out with her husband, had left their cell phone on the charger. I didn't know the phone was at home. I was calling her for two hours. By the time they did get home I was in a panic wondering where they were. My friend had come over that night to watch movies, but instead ended up looking after my son. She didn't mind, given the situation, so we went to the hospital and found our mother in the emergency room.\n\nWhen we arrived we all sat around her bed. I was sitting on the left side of my mother. My sister and her husband were sitting on her right side; my father was sitting at her feet. We waited for the doctor.\n\nThe time goes by so slowly. I watch nurse after nurse walk by wondering if one of them will come to my mother's bedside. All I can do is sit there while the smell of the hospital makes me feel ill. It feels like years of waiting for someone, anyone to come see my mother. I have never had a stronger feeling of helplessness in my life. I watch a woman with black hair who was wearing black pants and a white and black striped shirt walk by. I don't know why I chose to \"study\" her as she walked by. I guess it was to pass the time while waiting for a doctor. Then I see him. The doctor; as he walks right on by to another bed. Why does he not realize that my mother is the one who needs him? I am finding it very hard to sit still. I want to stand and to sit. I am not sure what to do with myself so I sit next to her holding her hand, hoping that someone will be there soon. As I look into her eyes, I do not see my mother, the woman who raised my sister and I. I am not sure what I see. When I look up, I see more nurses walk by with their shoes squeaky on the emergency room floor. Then I look at my father and I take notice of the look of despair in his eyes. The woman lying on the bed, my mother, his wife, was so thin. Then I look into her eyes and I feel a sense of calmness, even when my sister and I are crying ... my mother is so calm and in her eyes I see the look of \"hope\" comforting me letting me know that everything will be fine . then he walked in ... the doctor.\n\nI have never felt such an overwhelming feeling of \"relief.\" He says to her that he will do blood work and keep her in over night. As my sister, her husband, and I depart, we all give her a kiss and tell her that we will see her tomorrow.\n\nThe next day we are driving to the \"Doctor's house\" (that's what I told my son the hospital was), to see my mother and I feel the tears coming. I try to choke them back but I am unsuccessful. Walking into the hospital through the long hallway to the elevator, it seemed the hallway got longer and longer with every step I took. Finally, we reach the elevator and we stand there and wait. When the door finally opens, we walk inside, not a word spoken since we left the car. We get out of the elevator, go to the nurse's station, and ask if it was okay to go see her. \"She is in room 203\" one said.\n\nAs we leave the station to walk to her room, I feel the tears coming on again. She had a private room. I walked up to her bed and there she was. My mother started crying. She looked at me and said \"You be a good girl.\" I could no longer hold back my tears. I looked at her through my watery eyes and I said, \"Don't you say your goodbyes, don't do that\". I took her hand and rubbed her index finger. My sister was behind my father who was sitting in a chair beside my mother. We tried to talk about happy times but I knew that we were all thinking about the outcome of this terrible situation. Just like in the emergency room, I have never felt so helpless. I could not do anything. I could just sit there and watch my mother drift away from me.\n\nAfter a week, she started getting day passes and my father took her for nice drives and then home where she loved to be. Because at her home, there was a creek with a wooden bridge that my father had made out of a fallen tree. It was so beautiful and peaceful. My mother loved to sit beside the creek on the bench and just listen to the water running over the rocks; that was her \"happy place\". A place where she could forget what was going on in her life and just relax.\n\nIt wasn't long before she had to go back to the hospital because her health was slipping away from her. She would be in the hospital on her IV for a couple of days and then would be given another pass. On Friday, August 15, she got a three-day pass to go home. That night, my sister slept with her in the bed and my father slept on the couch. Every hour during the night, my sister was up taking her to the bathroom. In the morning, she started hallucinating and my sister said that my mother could no longer stay home, so they called the ambulance and took her back to the hospital.\n\nThat Saturday night my sister took me to see her. My mother had slipped into a partial coma. I walked into the room. I saw my mother lying on the bed motionless with her eyes open. I had a book in my hand ... it hit the floor; then I saw my mother's chest move, so I slowly bent down to get my book. I walked over to her bed, sat beside her, and started crying. I held her hand and said a \"special\" prayer for her.\n\nAfter about thirty minutes or so, my mother's best friend came in and she gave me a big hug. We just held each other for a while. I told her that my mother had spent the previous night at home and that my sister had been up a lot with my mom during the night. My mother's best friend then told me, that that night she had had a very restless sleep and that she kept waking up about every 45 minutes. So, I told her that it was probably my mother telling her to come see her and that is what she did.\n\nWe both sat there for a while and then she said we should go for a walk to move our legs so we went down to the cafeteria. I had a muffin and a soda and she had chips. We just sat there talking about my mother and we both knew that any day it was going to happen.\n\nWe both decided that it was time to go back to her room so we went upstairs to see her again. We sat beside my mother talking about the past and the happy times we both shared with her. I didn't know if my mother knew that I was there or not, so her best friend asked her to let me know. My mother opened her blue eyes wide and looked directly at me. I was very relieved, because I then knew for sure, that she knew that I was there. I took her hand in mine and asked her to squeeze it and she did. Then her best friend said that she was going to leave to give me some time alone with my mother. She waited for me at the nurse's station. When she left, I took my mother's hand again, kissed it, and told her that I loved her. She made some noises like she was trying to communicate with me. After a few minutes, I had to leave; I stood up, kissed her forehead, and told her that I would see her later. I never said \"Good-bye\" whenever I went to see her. I left her room, met her best friend at the nurse's station and then we left the hospital.\n\nThe next day I was watching TV and my sister came downstairs and told me Mom was gone. The news didn't hit me as hard as I thought it would. We all knew it was going to happen. We just didn't know when and that was the hard part for me ... not knowing when. I felt relieved knowing that my mom's long hard year of hell was finally over. My sister called and asked if I wanted to see her because she was still in her room. I said that I wanted to, not knowing if I could or not.\n\nAs my sister was driving me there, I got butterflies in my tummy and I started feeling ill. My sister parked and told me she would catch up, so I walked into the hospital down the long hallway telling myself that I could do this and that everything was going to be okay. When I got to the second floor, my mother's best friend and her husband were there. She gave me a huge hug and I told her that my mom had \"come to see her\" on Friday night. She told me that my father was in her room with a pastor, so I walked in, gave my father a huge hug, and started to cry on his shoulder. The pastor said he was going to leave us alone and he left and shut the door.\n\nWhen I let go of my father, I looked at my mother. She looked so peaceful . like she was asleep ... although she was not going to wake up. I sat beside her and got up enough courage to rub her arm. My father went to the other side of the bed, kissed her forehead, and told her that he loved her. I also went to the other side of the bed and rubbed her hair, which I never thought I would do; but for me, seeing her lying there helped me to deal with this terrible thing. I bent down and kissed her forehead, and said to her, that I knew where ever she was; she was at a better place. I told her that I loved her and then I left the room.\n\nMy mother, Judy Lidgate passed away on August 17, 2003 at the age of 56. I know wherever she is; she is finally at peace.\n\nIn September 2001 surgery I was diagnosed with stage IIIa clear cell ovarian cancer. A year later The Kansas City Star published my story. I own the copyright, and you have my permission to post my story.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nKansas City Star - Monday, September 2, 2002\n\nEVERYTHING CHANGED\n\nA year ago the phone rang: 'How about surgery tomorrow?'\n\nFor September, Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, writer Donna Trussell decided to tell her story. After an oncologist removed a mass the size of a small grapefruit, she had a 30 percent chance of surviving five years.\n\nBy Donna Trussell\n\nSpecial to the Star\n\nAt first I wanted to say: No, that can't be. I'm not a cancer person. Cancer is for other people, like getting a tattoo or eating squid. Fine for them but not my style.\n\nAnd this wasn't just any cancer.\n\nI first noticed vague symptoms two months before, but I attributed them to the advancing of menopause. After all, I was 47 years old.\n\nI'd get severe bloating for a day -- I wanted to stick an ice pick in my stomach to let the gas out -- and then it would subside. I'd get constipated.\n\nAnd I'd get tired. I bought some herbal teas and talked to my doctor about taking estrogen.\n\nMy final symptom was a low-grade fever, but that came along later, just before I doubled over with abdominal pain on a sunny August afternoon.\n\nMy doctor's nurse ordered me to the emergency room. I argued. Bad things happen in emergency rooms. But she convinced me to go and may have saved my life.\n\nThe first doctor I saw thought I might have diverticulitis. He mentioned the possibility of an emergency colostomy.\n\n\"No! That's not the way I do things. I do research. I get second opinions.\"\n\n\"You may not have a choice,\" he said grimly.\n\nWithin hours, I was given a blood test for CA-125, a protein associated with ovarian cancer. An ultrasound and a CT scan revealed a mass the size of a small grapefruit. My white cell count was high, and the doctors began pumping me full of antibiotics.\n\nTwo days later, on my birthday, I was still in the hospital when I first heard the words \"ovarian cancer.\" Suddenly I wanted to go back to the colostomy scenario. Now it didn't sound so bad.\n\nAfter I left the hospital, I was to be watched. If the mass got smaller, we'd know it wasn't cancer.\n\nBut the mass didn't shrink. My CA-125 was still elevated. My ovaries and the mass had to go. An oncologist would do the surgery.\n\nI wanted nothing to do with an oncologist. An oncologist might drum up cancer cells just to increase business, right?\n\nThe oncologist in question was Verda Hunter. Her name had been in the news. She had turned pharmacist Robert Courtney in to the FBI for diluting chemotherapy drugs.\n\nBut I didn't want to see a Verda who specialized in gynecologic oncology. What kind of woman would go into a field where you watch people die? A woman named Verda, that's who.\n\nI pictured a comedian in a leopard-skin, pillbox hat and cat-eye glasses with rhinestones. *Verda.* Well, let this Verda try to railroad me into unnecessary surgery.\n\nOn Verda's door was the word \"oncology.\" I winced.\n\nThere was a form to fill out. I asked for a pen, and the receptionist pointed to a cup full of silk flowers.\n\n\"Pull one out,\" she said. The flowers were pens. \"We haven't lost a single pen since we got those,\" she offered.\n\nVerda. Fake-flower pens. I didn't like Cancer World, and I wanted to go home.\n\nVerda didn't wear glasses or a leopard-skin hat. She was quite beautiful. And she didn't crack jokes. What really sold me on Verda, though, was that she didn't want to do surgery.\n\n\"Your ovaries feel normal size for a woman your age,\" she said. \"You're a small woman, and if there were a mass, I would feel it. Let's do another CA-125. I'll bet it's gone down.\"\n\nDr. Hunter was my kind of gal. Overjoyed, I left a message for my family doctor: *no mass!* It was all one big mistake.\n\nA few days later, though, Dr. Hunter's nurse called to schedule surgery. Dr. Hunter had seen the CT scan and changed her mind.\n\n\"But my symptoms are gone,\" I said. But, but, but...\n\n\"Let me read you the radiologist report,\" the nurse said. It was brutal. Radiologists don't mince words. My fantasy of a benign mass evaporated.\n\nThe surgery was scheduled in three weeks, at the end of September. But I had one more chance of reprieve: another ultrasound. Optimism faded when the technician skipped part of the exam because the mass was so large.\n\n\"If they can't see this, they're blind,\" she said.\n\nThe next day -- Sept. 11, 2001 -- I was watching the twin towers fall on TV when the phone rang.\n\nIt was Dr. Hunter's nurse. \"How about surgery tomorrow?\" I knew better than to argue.\n\nIt was all beginning to seem like a nightmare -- an exhausted, unshaven, melancholy Peter Jennings; ghoulish footage, repeated endlessly, of a jet liner crashing into the tower; and the immediate prospect of the most ominous surgery of my life.\n\nIf ever I felt like the world was ending, that was the day.\n\nJust before entering the operating room I told the anesthesiologist about a news report I'd seen: A woman woke up during surgery unable to move or speak.\n\n\"Make sure you give me enough so that I don't wake up,\" I said.\n\n\"You bet,\" he replied in his best Wilford Brimley.\n\n\"But don't give me so much that I don't wake up at all. I want to wake up.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"That's the idea,\" he said, patting my hand.\n\nOh, they were kind. All of them. My last sight before going to sleep was a masked face standing over me, and I thought I saw compassion in the man's brown eyes.\n\nThe next thing I knew I heard a voice saying, \"This is Dr. Hunter. It's mostly good.\"\n\nShe was glowing with happiness, in fact, when she talked to my husband. She thought the tumor looked precancerous. I might be able to get away with an abbreviated course of chemotherapy or even no chemo at all. We'd have to wait on the pathology report to know for sure.\n\nIt was a decidedly more subdued Dr. Hunter who came to my bedside two days later. A biopsy revealed microscopic cancer cells beyond the tumor and ovaries.\n\nI was Stage III. Advanced.\n\n\"What are my chances?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" she said, \"but I don't want you focusing on that. The five-year survival rate for Stage III is 30 percent.\"\n\nWith the recent advances in oncology, one would expect to hear 70 or 80 percent. But for me, the odds were that I would die within five years.\n\n\"People think of a skull and crossbones when they think of cancer, but I want you to think of this disease as manageable,\" Dr. Hunter said. \"If diabetics didn't get their insulin, they'd be dead in a week.\"\n\nShe may as well have been talking to the moon.\n\nIt was only later, when I connected with other ovarian cancer survivors whose doctors had all but pronounced them goners, that I discovered how fortunate I was. I had found a warrior doctor.\n\nIn the months that followed I also discovered the answer to my question: What kind of people go into a field where they watch people die? Not misanthropes, as I once suspected. Rather, people with courage.\n\nIn Dr. Hunter's office are makeshift signs that say, \"Never give up on anyone. Miracles happen every day.\" A year ago such piety would have made me squirm, but everything takes on a new meaning once you have cancer. Dr. Hunter and her staff were not going to hand me over to the coroner without a fight.\n\nFor me chemotherapy was not the ogre of popular mythology, thanks to the drugs for side effects. During my six months of treatment I felt queasy for only a few days, and anemia was always short-lived. But I did lose my hair, including my eyebrows and eyelashes.\n\nA friend wanted to take me wig shopping, but I told her that a local charity gives away wigs.\n\n\"But if they're free, you know they'll all be Midge wigs,\" she said.\n\nMidge wigs?\n\n\"Midge, the neighbor in `The Dick Van Dyke Show.' \"\n\nOh yes, the brunette with the short, tight curls. I found out my friend was right. I resolved to wear hats. Once my eyebrows and eyelashes were gone, whom was I kidding? Some women pencil in eyebrows, but I preferred the barefaced cancer patient look to that of the 1930s movie star.\n\nI learned to forgive well-meaning friends who offered words of dubious comfort. One said my cancer was an opportunity to \"grow spiritually.\" I left unsaid the suggestion that came immediately to mind -- that she could have a similar opportunity by jumping off a balcony.\n\nAn oncology nurse told me she could \"get hit by a bus tomorrow.\" I later discovered that the bus comment is the No. 1 annoying response to a cancer diagnosis. One ovarian cancer patient said that the bus scenario isn't even a good comparison. It's too random.\n\nA more useful analogy would be: You wake up in a strange place and you're told you *were* in a car crash. It was a 10-car pileup. Two or three of you will survive, but we don't know who, and those survivors will undergo debilitating treatments for the rest of their lives.\n\nMy last chemo treatment was in February. My CA-125 was normal, but only a CT scan could confirm my remission. My oncologist met with me to deliver the results: clear.\n\n\"Your chance of recurrence is 50 percent,\" she said.\n\nI was entering a new era, one that unsettled me even more than my original diagnosis: waiting for recurrence. I told Dr. Hunter I was scared.\n\n\"But everything has gone exactly as we'd hoped. You did everything you were supposed to do.\"\n\n\"Well, it's not like I had a choice.\"\n\nShe looked away and then said quietly, \"I know a little something about not having choices.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked.\n\n\"It wasn't cancer. But let's just say there was a certain pharmacist.\"\n\nThe chemotherapy patients would loudly gripe about Robert Courtney all day long, but I had never heard Dr. Hunter or any of her staff mention his name or refer to him -- or the effects of diluted cancer drugs -- in any way.\n\n\"Every morning,\" Dr. Hunter said, \"I have to get up and look at myself in the mirror. Every morning I want you to get up and look in the mirror and say, `Today I'm healthy.' \"\n\nSometimes you can see an enemy most clearly in the eyes of the soldiers. This doctor, who had dedicated her life to saving women, who had a reputation as one of the most caring and skilled oncologists around, would never be the same. The sadness is etched in her face.\n\nAs for me, cancer turned my life upside-down. Everything changed -- my sex life, my work, my dreams and hopes for the future, my sense of myself and my place in the world. Friends and family did all they could, but the loneliness of my diagnosis was unrelieved until I discovered an online support group of 1,200 ovarian cancer patients -- www.acor.org.\n\nThere I found solace among others who were living the same limbo existence. Most of these women signed their posts with date of diagnosis and organs removed. Here's one woman's list: spleen, appendix, all female parts, omentum, part of the intestine and colon, many lymph nodes.\n\n\"BUT,\" she wrote, \"HE LEFT MY HEART!\"\n\nTo comfort a woman whose sister was dying, I wrote about Anne Morrow Lindbergh's search for peace after her infant son was kidnapped and murdered. She tried every false path there is to recovery. Only one helped, the story of the mustard seed:\n\nA woman who's lost a baby asks if there is a cure for her grief. \"Yes,\" a holy man replies. \"You must find a house that has never known sorrow, take a mustard seed from that house, and then you will be cured.\"\n\nThe woman spent the rest of her life looking but could not find a house that had never known sorrow. To suffer is to be human.\n\nI resolved to stop comparing myself to people who live into their 80s and 90s. Instead I thought of the men, women and children on the Titanic who died an icy death far from home and of the doomed airline passengers on Sept. 11.\n\nI, in contrast, expect to be in a warm bed surrounded by nurses and loved ones. And who knows? I just might survive, if for no other reason than to make trouble.\n\nTwenty years ago ovarian cancer patients often died within one year of diagnosis. Now women are living two or three years, sometimes longer. Now we've formed groups, and we're trying to change our terrible statistics.\n\nWe may not be able to save ourselves, but perhaps we can save our daughters and granddaughters.\n\nDonna Trussell is a poet, fiction writer and former editor and film critic. She lives in Prairie Village. Her husband, Robert Trussell, is the Star's theater critic.\n\nDonna Trussell reports that she bought the prettiest hats she could find, forgetting that hair automatically goes with any outfit but hats do not. The hat she wore most was a plain black beret.\n\nLiving Day to Day With Love and Faith\n\nPam's and Nina's stories, written by journalist Sherry Anderson, are reprinted with permission from the Southwest Orlando Bulletin.\n\nOn a quiet street in Southwest Orlando live two women whose lives have followed similar paths in more ways than they ever expected. They each have two daughters, and over the years, they have had their fair share of homework, trips to malls, and carpooling to friends' houses and after-school activities. They also have had their own work and volunteer commitments. The similarities in their lives are noticeable, but what most people do not realize is that these women share a bond that goes beyond any neighborhood, school group, or car pool. They know and understand what it is like to face life-threatening illnesses and meet them head-on with unwavering strength and determination.\n\nPam's Story\n\nPam Fogle is well-known to many families in the Southwest community. Wherever her daughters, Jennifer and Heather, went to school, Pam also was there. She served as ADDitions coordinator at Dr. Phillips Elementary School; president of the PTA at Bay Meadows Elementary School for the first two years the school was open; treasurer and president of the PTSA at Southwest Middle School; and vice president and president of the PTSA at Dr. Phillips High School. Today, students still remember her as \"Mrs. Wishy-Washy\" the storyteller, as the queen of England at BMES's World Bazaar, or as a familiar face at ballgames and school events.\n\n\"Children are my life,\" Pam once said, and her volunteer efforts have been recognized with several awards, including Orange County Council PTA Volunteer of the Year and a regional award for the Kraft/Walt Disney World Volunteer of the Year. In her honor, Bay Meadows PTA annually presents the Pam Fogle Volunteer Award to one parental volunteer and one fifth-grade student who show service to the community through volunteerism.\n\nIn the fall of 1994, Pam and her family were looking forward to a relaxing trip to the Florida Keys before another busy school year got under way. Heather was 13 and in the eighth grade at SWMS, and Jennifer was a 16-year-old junior at DPHS.\n\n\"We were on our vacation in the Keys when I had a severe ulcer attack,\" Pam said. \"I had been on medication for ulcers in my stomach and esophagus for several years, but I had been eating all the wrong things - like fried foods and margaritas. Usually within 10 to 12 hours, the pain would subside. This time it lasted for three days, and I finally told my husband, Bill, that I needed to go to the emergency room.\"\n\nAt Fisherman's Hospital in Marathon, Fla., Pam was given medication and told that if it was an ulcer attack, she would feel better within a few minutes. The pain continued, and doctors ordered a series of X-rays and a sonogram. The tests indicated that Pam had gallstones, and the doctor wanted her to have emergency gallbladder surgery. But Pam wanted her family members to enjoy their vacation, and she wanted to consult with her own doctor in Orlando before having surgery. She was given some medication to ease her symptoms and agreed to see a surgeon the next day, just in case her symptoms worsened and emergency surgery was needed.\n\n\"He was the one who told me that they also had seen a small mass in the pelvic area, and he felt like I needed to see my gynecologist,\" Pam said. \"I went right to the phone and made an appointment with my primary-care physician to see me when we got back home.\"\n\nPam's primary-care physician agreed with the surgeon in Marathon that Pam should have her gallbladder removed and consult with a gynecologist, even though she had been unable to detect anything out of the ordinary during Pam's pelvic exam.\n\n\"When I saw the gynecologist, he said the same thing,\" Pam said. \"He said there might have been something wrong with the X-ray film. I thought, Well, that's what it was. After all, I had had two pelvic exams.\"\n\nPam did not know it at the time, but Bill was not reassured and asked the surgeon performing the gallbladder surgery to look at her other organs while he had the laparoscope inserted.\n\n\"The surgeon noticed a large mass about the size of a saucer on my right ovary,\" Pam said. \"He contacted my gynecologist, who asked for a Ca125 blood test immediately. I went home to wait.\"\n\nPam waited for five long days before hearing the news that her blood count from the Ca125 test was almost 400. A normal range is 0 to 30. Pam was referred to Dr. Neil Finkler of the Walt Disney Memorial Cancer Center at Florida Hospital and was told that she would have to wait another week to see the doctor.\n\n\"My mother said, 'No way are we going to wait,'\" Pam said. \"So she got on the phone, and I got in to see him in two days. My mother was very strong through all of this.\"\n\nBefore Pam saw Dr. Finkler, a friend gave her some valuable advice.\n\n\"She said, 'Pam, when you go, you make sure you feel comfortable in this place, because you are probably going to spend the rest of your life going there for checkups. You need to be comfortable with everything, not just the doctor.'\n\n\"At the time, Dr. Finkler was in a little office across the street from the hospital, and it was packed,\" Pam continued. \"I walked in, and it felt like I had an immediate bonding with everyone in the waiting room. [The staff was] so sweet and so loving, and the doctor came in and was like a knight in shining armor. I knew I was in the right place.\"\n\nDr. Finkler's exam detected a large mass on Pam's left ovary.\n\n\"I knew the surgeon said that he saw something on the right ovary, so I knew I was in big trouble,\" Pam said. \"At times, I felt like I was watching a bad movie. The actors were great, but the story line wasn't.\"\n\nIt had been only six days since Pam's gallbladder surgery, and her body still needed to heal. She would have to wait two weeks before having a complete hysterectomy and almost another week to get the pathologist's report, which confirmed that she had Stage III ovarian cancer.\n\n\"Dr. Finkler did not feel that I needed chemotherapy right then,\" Pam said. \"He felt very positive [that all the cancer had been removed]. I remember I asked him if I was his wife, would he recommend chemotherapy at this time, and he said definitely not, because he did not like the idea of putting toxins in the body if we didn't have to.\"\n\nPam saw Dr. Finkler every month and regularly had Ca125 blood tests. Her count stayed around 17 to 23 for approximately six months, and then it began to slowly rise. By October 1995, one year after her hysterectomy, her count was up to 78, and laparoscopic surgery revealed the same cancer cells in her stomach. Chemotherapy could no longer be avoided. In January 1996, Pam began a series of six chemotherapy treatments, one every three weeks.\n\n\"I really didn't get that sick,\" she said. \"I thought I was prepared to lose my hair, but I absolutely lost it. I can't describe the feeling. I thought I was ready, but I wasn't. Heather had the hardest time with me losing my hair. She hated it. She didn't even want to look at me at first if I didn't have on a wig, hat or turban. She was only 14, and Mom was not supposed to get sick.\"\n\nPam finished her last treatment right before Jennifer's high-school graduation.\n\n\"It probably helped me a lot that I kept myself busy with her activities and getting her ready to go to school,\" Pam said. \"The house was constantly busy with the girls' friends. There were times I wish I had stayed in bed, but I didn't want to disrupt their lives.\"\n\nSometimes in the early morning hours when the girls were still asleep and the house was quiet, Pam would lie awake, and fear and doubt would creep into her thoughts.\n\n\"I would think, What are my children going to do? and How can I ever miss all of this?\" Pam said. \"I wanted to see my girls graduate from high school and college and get married and have my grandchildren. Then I'd kick myself, or if I was still down later, then maybe a friend would do it for me, and I would get over it. I never really dwelled on the thought that I wouldn't get well. I truly felt like I would.\"\n\nPam said she attributes her positive attitude to her faith.\n\n\"I turned it all over [to God],\" she said. \"From the day I found out I had cancer, I put myself in a constant state of prayer and thanksgiving. I believe that this is the only way I could have survived physically and emotionally. I think that had a lot to do with my attitude - and the fact that my family and friends always seemed to be there whenever I might be hitting a low point. I couldn't have asked for them to be any stronger.\"\n\nPam said she even received cards and letters from friends of friends.\n\n\"It really lifts you up to think someone has thought about you,\" she said.\n\nNow when she hears about someone who has cancer, she always tries to write the person a note of encouragement.\n\nPam has continued to depend on the love and support of her family, including her parents, Art and Martha Beach of Winter Garden, who have been by her side for every procedure and treatment.\n\nLast year, Pam's Ca125 count began to rise again, and a computerized-tomography, or CT, scan revealed a small spot on the outside of her left lung. A needle biopsy determined that it was the same cell as the ovarian cancer. In April 2000, Pam began another round of six chemotherapy treatments. Her daughter, Heather, now a college student at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, came home last summer to care for her mother.\n\n\"I felt like I'd lost my best friend when she went back to school,\" Pam said.\n\nJennifer, who is in a management-training program with Macaroni Grill, is living at home again and keeping an eye on Mom.\n\nPam is in remission and is going every three months for her blood tests.\n\n\"I'll go through chemotherapy as many times as I have to, if that's what it takes,\" she said. \"You do what you have to do. You pick yourself up and dust yourself off.\"\n\nRecently, Pam had a positron-emission tomography, or PET, scan, which is similar to a CT scan. Glucose is injected into the body, and if there is any cancer present, it will show up like a hot spot. Pam feels that insurance companies are hesitant to authorize its use because it is an expensive test. Its real value to her came in the form of peace of mind.\n\nShe tries not to think about what might have happened if she had not had the gallbladder attack that prompted the X-rays. She always kept up with her annual visits to the gynecologist, and she never had any discriminating pain. In her early 40s, she was under the typical age for the onset of ovarian cancer.\n\n\"Ovarian cancer is so hard to diagnose because the symptoms are what every woman goes through at one time or another,\" Pam said.\n\nThroughout her ups and downs with cancer, Pam has remained an active mother and volunteer. Four years ago, she also became a school employee as an office clerk at Bay Meadows.\n\n\"The Bay Meadows family has been so good to me,\" Pam said. \"The teachers and the staff were there for me every day. They helped look after my family with food after each treatment. The children and their parents have been so supportive. I was concerned with how the children would react to seeing me with a hat on. They still came in and hugged me as if everything was the way it should be.\n\n\"God said that he will help those who help themselves, so I made it my challenge to try and keep a positive outlook. I guess that old saying 'When life gives you lemons, make lemonade' is true. Faith has been a constant with me. I have learned a lot from this whole experience. Life is so very precious. We should embrace every moment and learn to be more tolerant and understanding of people. We really shouldn't sweat the small stuff. I value life, "
