        "text": "Opportunity Zones are a powerful way to encourage revitalization in economically distressed communities. Redevelopment of current or former Superfund sites may qualify for Opportunity Zone tax benefits. Learn more below or view EPAâs fact sheet for more information:\n\nSuperfund Redevelopment Using Opportunity Zone Tax Incentives (PDF)(2Â pp, 1.8 MB, About PDF)\n\nOn this page:\n\nWhat are Opportunity Zones?\n\nCan Superfund Sites Qualify for Opportunity Zone Benefits?\n\nWhat are the Tax Benefits?\n\nCan Communities Promote Opportunity Zones and the Reuse of Superfund Sites?\n\nEPA Regional Opportunity Zone Contacts\n\nWhat are Opportunity Zones?\n\nOpportunity Zones attract long-term private investors and stimulate economic growth. They were created by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and established in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the five U.S. territories. Opportunity Zones can help revitalize contaminated and formerly contaminated properties, including Superfund sites. They attract private investment and strengthen the financial viability of redevelopment projects.\n\nView a map of Opportunity Zones and learn more about Opportunity Zones in your state or territory:\n\nMap of Opportunity ZonesExit\n\nTop of Page\n\nCan Superfund Sites Qualify for Opportunity Zone Benefits?\n\nRedevelopment of current or former Superfund sites may qualify for Opportunity Zone tax benefits. Superfund site property located within an Opportunity Zone qualifies for tax benefits when the qualifying investment commences an âoriginal useâ on the property or âsubstantially improvesâ the property (doubles the basis in the property) in a specified timeframe.\n\nTop of Page\n\nWhat are the Tax Benefits?\n\nU.S. taxpayers are eligible to receive tax benefits on realized capital gains reinvested in Opportunity Zones through Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs). These benefits include:\n\nTemporary Deferral of Capital Gains Taxes: Investors are not taxed on the capital gains invested in a QOF until they exit the fund or December 31, 2026, whichever comes first.\n\nStep Up in Basis: Investments held for a minimum of five years will be taxed at the reduced rates of 90% for investments held for at least five years (10% basis increase) and 85% for investments held for at least seven years (15% basis increase).\n\nTax-Free Gains After Year 10: If an investor holds a reinvestment for 10 years, capital gains achieved by the QOF investment during that period will not be taxed. This is a permanent exclusion from taxable income.\n\nTop of Page\n\nCan Communities Promote Opportunity Zones and the Reuse of Superfund Sites?\n\nMany communities are using Opportunity Zones to attract investors and developers. EPA and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have tools and resources to help local leaders achieve equitable outcomes at development projects in Opportunity Zones.
