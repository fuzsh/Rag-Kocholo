        "text": "Already 1,200 people have signed a petition NOT to submit White Sands to the UNESCO World Heritage program. Consequently, the Otero County Commission unanimously declared themselves against the proposal. The date? Thursday, August 16, 2007.\n\nOtero County commissioners have sent a resolution to the National Parks Service and to their congressional delegation expressing their official desires that White Sands be removed from the list of those sites being considered as World Heritage Sites. The date? Friday, August 24, 2007.\n\nThe Otero County Commission passed an ordinance declaring that such proposals, if the county has not been consulted first, are unlawful. The date? October 18, 2007.\n\nOctober 31, 2007 - The Department of the Interior, National Park Service, gives you the full month of November 2007 to submit public comments.\n\nYou can Send comments to: Jonathan Putnam, Office of International Affairs, NPS, 1201 Eye Street, NW., (0050), Washington, DC 20005; or via email at jonathan_putnam@nps.gov ; or via phone at 202/3541809; or via fax at 202/3711446. Also, you may send comments to Leonard Stowe, NPS\n\nInformation Collection Clearance Officer, 1849 C St., NW., (2605), Washington, DC 20240; or by e-mail at leonard_stowe@nps.gov. All comments will become a matter of public record.\n\nHere is the excerpt from the Federal Register October 31, 2007 regarding the public comments.\n\nAnd here is the October 2007 National Park Service News Release regarding the comments and with more information on the issue.\n\nREADERS' COMMENTS\n\nThe objections to World Heritage listing are about the same as a 4-year old's fear of the monster in his bedroom closet. There isn't one. The point about the water really cracks me up. Two thirds of the planet is covered with water and it is LESS salty than the water in the Tularosa Basin. Who would want it???\n\nPosted by Jim Eckles\n\nPosted on Tuesday, September 11, 2007\n\nMr. Jim Eckles characterizes those who favor the WHS designation. The resort to name-calling and putting down those with whom he disagrees. This fight in Otero County is about input and democracy. The NPS has violated two Otero County laws by forwarding the nomination and refusing to reconsider. The NPS is acting outside legal providence and pushing it's own will \"We the people\".\n\nSurely, the County does not have the final say in this process but if it were up to the proponents and the NPS the County would have zero say. Also, it is curious that the NPS included letters of support from the County, the City and a Congressman who did not support the designation or did not have the authority to give support. The NPS quickly recalled the original application and made changes and admitted \"errors\" in the process yet will not give the legally passed laws of Otero County due consideration. In my view it is government supremacists who are pushing this agenda against the right Otero County has to give fair, honest, input at the beginning of the process, not at the end, like the NPS insists.\n\nSo, let the name-calling begin: Proponents will call those who want input \"paranoid, uneducated, fear-mongers, and all manner of ugly names. Yet they will never address this one issue: democracy. What is the will of the people and do they have a right to express it though elected officials and does the federal government have the duty to listen or does it ram its own desires down the throat of those it deems paranoid or uneducated?\n\nPosted by John Turney\n\nPosted on Monday, November 12, 2007\n\nHAVE A SAY\n\nIf you wish to comment on this matter you are welcome to do so.\n\nWe will post your full comments minus the curse words (if applicable).\n\nWrite to mail[at]white-sands-new-mexico.info"
