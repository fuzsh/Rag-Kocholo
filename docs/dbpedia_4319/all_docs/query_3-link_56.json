        "text": "Wallace (Wally) Knutson, 86, passed away at the Benedictine Living Community Crookston on Sunday, August 4, 2024, with his niece and caregiver, Linda Morgan, by his side.\n\nWally was born in Warroad, MN on April 13, 1938, the oldest son of William and Hannah (Erlanson) Knutson. Together with his brothers, Conrad and Walter, they were raised on a farmstead 30 miles south of Baudette. He was baptized in the Lutheran Faith and attended grade school 1 mile from his homestead before graduating from Baudette High School in 1957. While growing up Wally spent his time hunting and trapping all kinds of wildlife with his brothers. He was an avid reader throughout his entire life. Wally was a resident of the Pioneer Nursing Home in Erskine, MN until its closing in May of 2023 when he became a resident of Benedictine Living Community Crookston, formerly known as Villa St. Vincent. During his time in both nursing homes, he loved to play games, especially bingo, and attend church services. He enjoyed family reunions held at Linda and husband, Craig’s, lake home on Maple Lake, near Mentor, MN. He was known for having a sweet tooth and a love for pop. Wally’s hugs, sense of humor, and love for Christian music are just a few things that will be missed.\n\nWally will be lovingly remembered by his nieces and nephews: Linda (Craig) Morgan of Crookston, MN, Laurie (Curt) Bitter of Baudette, MN, Steven (Joy) Knutson of Baudette, MN and Bill (Brenda) Knutson of Glenwood Springs, CO; 9 great-nieces and nephews, Laura (Connor) Thoreson, Lindsay (Yves) Leemann, Connor (Katie) Morgan, Courtney (Nick) Baade, Isaac (Emily) Bitter, Brandon (Lacey) Knutson, Sherina Knutson, Warren Knutson (Kayla), and Brooke Knutson(Travis); 17 great-great nieces and nephews: Alissa, Blake, and Quinn Thoreson, Remy and Emma Leemann, Bella, Gracie, Lenoire, Nixon, Albany, and Gloria Baade, Winston and Charlotte Bitter, Parker and Presley Hoffman, and Anora and Aliza Knutson; and Lyndon Anderson of Baudette, MN.\n\nWally is preceded in death by his parents, William and Hannah Knutson; brothers, Conrad Knutson and Walter Knutson; and sister-in-law, Margaret (Knutson) Anderson.\n\nThe family would like to thank the nursing staff at the Villa (MCU) and Red River Valley Hospice. Wally will be very sadly missed by all who were fortunate to have known him.\n\nWally’s life will be celebrated with a private family service to be held in the Elm Park Cemetery, Baudette, MN, where he will be laid to rest next to his brothers.\n\nThe Stenshoel-Houske Funeral Home, Crookston, and Helgeson Funeral Home, Baudette, are assisting the family with service arrangements."
