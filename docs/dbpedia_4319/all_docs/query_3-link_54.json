        "text": "At age 87, she was the oldest person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award. Christopher Plummer later surpassed her when he was nominated at age 88 for Alles Geld der Welt (2017). To date, Judd Hirsch was also the same age as Stuart (87) when he got nominated for Die Fabelmans (2022).\n\nWhile Stuart was appearing in the Pasadena Playhouse, not only was a Paramount casting director there, but also an agent from Universal who was there to see her leading man was also. She received contract offers from both studios but was advised to sign from Universal because it was not a major studio at the time and that would offer her more opportunities.\n\nFollowing her husband's death, she engaged in a 13-year friendship with printer Ward Ritchie, born in 1904. They first met in 1930 when he was best friends with first husband, sculptor Blair Gordon Newell. The two reacquainted in March 1983 and he taught her fine printing. They remained close until his death in 1996.\n\nTurned down Shirley auf Welle 303 (1938) because she felt that the material was not to her dramatic acting abilities; however, Darryl F. Zanuck forced her to do the picture, and explained that she would be seen by millions, due to Shirley Temple's popularity. Stuart agreed in a 1998 interview that Zanuck was correct."
