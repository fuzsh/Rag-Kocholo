He married (2) ELIZABETH WILLIAMS9,10 20 Dec 1688 in Radnor Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania11. She died Unknown.\n\nNotes for REES PREES:\n\nFrom Ruth Priest Dixon's marvelous book Mijamin Priest and his Family from William Penn's Colony to East Texas 1684 to 1884 we learn Rees and Ann Prees left Radnorshire, Wales in 1684 for William Penn's colony in the new world just two years after it was established by William Penn. They departed from sailing from Doleyshere* (Dolesororen), Merionethshire, England on the Vine of Liverpool captained by William Presson. The trip took over two months. They were with a large group of Quakers and landed in Philadelphia on the 17th day of the 7th month of 1684 according to the Quaker calender or September 17, 1684. Their name is listed as Prees in the manifest.\n\nAnn died within a few years after they arrived at Penn's colony and Rees married Elizabeth Williams at the Hartford Monthly Meeting. Apparently this is where the changing of the name from Prees or Priest to Price first occurred. According to Ruth Priest Dixon's research it is clear that it was Rees Prees that married Elizabeth Williams, however, his name is listed as Price. A change that some of the family carries on in future generations.\n\nThe family lived in or near Philadelphia and they had a least five children. William, David, Thomas, Joseph, and Elizabeth were name in that order in Rees' will. However, he named his eldest son Richard who came with him from Wales as his administrator. He died in 1969.\n\nMore About REES PREES:\n\nOccupation: Carpenter12\n\nChildren of REES PREES and ANN UNKNOWN are:\n\ni. MARY2 PREES13,14, d. Unknown.\n\nii. SARAH PREES15,16, d. Unknown.\n\niii.

Source Ruth Dixon Priest.\n\n******************\n\nHe was granted Chester County Warrant No. 62 for 150 acres on Dec. 5, 1719. The warrant describes the land as \"A certain parcel of land near that place first seated by Allen Robinet without license some years also and now is in the tenure of the said David.\" David's land was on Mill Creek, a tributary of Conestoga Creek. David lived just south of Hendricks' huge land grant near Postlethwait's tavern.\" Priest was fairly consistently used as David's surname.\n\nIn 1722 he was the forty-ninth person to be granted permission to settle west of the Susquehanna River.\n\nThere was controversy over who owned the land west of the Susquehanna River: William Penn or Lord Baltimore. There were many border episodes. The one David Priest was involved in was the Cresap Affair which occurred in 1736.\"Captain Thomas Cresap was engaged by Maryland to enlist and pay men to remove the German settlers from land Lord Baltimore claimed. The settlers ere terrorized and men we killed, their doors were chopped down and their houses destroyed....The Provincial Judges of Pennsylvania authorized the Sheriff of Lancaster to apprehend Cresap on a charge of murder, and to take him by any means.\" In 1736 the sheriff of Lancaster County with 22 men, including David Priest surrounded Cresap's house and demanded he surrender. He refused. Subsequently the Pennsylvania groups set his house on fire. \"In the confusion , one of Cresap's servants was shot dead. David Priest was accused by Maryland of the killing though some said the servant was killed accidentally by Cresap's men. David was never brought to trial. Source Ruth Priest Dixon.\n\nRuth Priest Dixon's book goes on that David had 400 acres surveyed west of the Susquehanna River on the Yellow Breeches Creek on July 2, 1737. \"Earlier an Indian village existed on the land David now owned.\" In 1739 he bought a large tract of land down the Susquehanna along Marsh Run.\"he was the original owner of a part of the wooded ridge along the river below Marsh Run which was shown on maps in colonial time as Priest's Mountain.\" Source Ruth Priest Dixon.\n\nSource: Ruth Priest Dixon.\n\n******************\n\nDavid Prees (Preece)\n\n4 August 1747 Emanuel Carpenter, Samuel Smith, James Gillespie and Samuel Anderson Esquires, Justices.\n\nVID PREES DECEASED: UPON the petition of Susanna Prees and William Prees administrators of all and singular the goods and chattels, dights and credits which are of David Prees late of Lancaster County deceased, setting forth that the personal estate of the deceased was not sufficient to pay his just debts and that he died seized of four hundred acres of land Pennsborough Township in the said County and therefore prayed an order of this court to allow them to make sale of such part of the said land as should be sufficient with the personal estate to pay all the debts and bring up the children of the deceased and having exhibited an inventory of the personal estate of the deceased amounting to 131,,6,,0, and an account of debts owing by the deceased at the time of his death amounting to 177,,3,,8-1/2 whereupon it appeared that the sum of 45,,17,,8-1/2 remained over and above the amount of the personal estate.

The land on which David settled was approximately 9 miles south-southwest of the present-day courthouse in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. David appeared on the first Conestoga Township tax list in 1718; but, by some reports, he had arrived in 1716. David's father, Rees, and brother, Thomas, followed him to the Conestoga Valley in 1721, jointly settling 1,000 acres located 1.2 miles northwest of David's land. Something occasioned both brothers to sever their ties to the Conestoga valley in the same year, 1737; perhaps it was the death of Rees Preecs. David moved in 1737 to land in Pennsborough Township, near the point where Yellow Breeches Creek flows into the Susquehanna River (south of present-day Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and on the west back of the Susquehanna River).

Scalf\n\n(Floyd County Times, Prestonsburg, Kentucky, Feb., 1966)\n\nWilliam Martin Preece, young Pike County Kentuckian, and his wife, Elizabeth Gideon, left their native land in 1838 and moved westward with the tide of empire and settled in Texas. For a century and a quarter their ties with their land of origin were broken. The Texas Preeces were busy fighting Comanche's and their Confederate neighbors, for they were loyal to the Union when it was fashionable and safer to hurrah for Jeff Davis. One of them became a famous Texas Ranger.\n\nThe Preeces created estates in Texas, educated themselves and their posterity. One of them, of today, Harold Preece, became a famous writer; THE DALTON GANG, the incredible story of four notorious outlaws, became a best-seller and Texans forgot the historic Yankee sentiments of his people and took him to their hearts.\n\nThe tangled skein of the Preece or Priest family history began to (sic) interwine with regional and state history back in 1775 when William Priest headed a group of eight or ten men to build a fort in Powell's Valley in Southwest Virginia. There, ensconced in Priest's Fort and bulwarked by occupants of nearby Martin, and Mump's Forts they fought the Indians for a year but were forced to leave. In a few months they returned and stayed through the Revolution and the trying post- war troubles. Migrating over the Cumberlands, they settled in southern Floyd county, on John's Creek, and in the present Martin County. It was from a section of Martin county, then Pike, that William Martin Priest left for Texas\n\n\"William Priest, father of William Martin, [note: Richard Lincoln was William's father, William was William Martin's grandfather] after his Indian fighting days were over, moved out of the fort and became a prominent Russell county (Virginia) settler. Having need to preserve family and legal papers, he began to store them in an old trunk. There were land patents, one of them signed in 1783 by a governor of Virginia. There were copies of deeds and family letters, and when he died in 1803 a member of the family put a copy of his will in it. Soon, a son migrated over the Cumberland's and took with him the old trunk. It fell into the hands of Polly Preece, who married the Floyd county pioneer, Tandy Stratton in 1811. Tandy died in 1828 and the trunk, each generation storing valuable papers in it, went to Tandy's son, John Jackson Stratton. He died at the turn of the century and the old trunk, gathering papers through the years, finally reached the home of a Stratton descendant in southern Floyd county. He-died and his widow decided in the early 1930's to clean it out. She took the old papers out into the back yard, built a fire under them. Her step-son, returning from work, attempted to put out the fire but succeeded in retrieving only a few scorched documents. Most of the family's history for 150 years had perished.\n\nMeanwhile, down in Texas, the Preeces retained little more than a tradition of their Kentucky mountain origin. Harold Preece, the writer, did make an abortive attempt to learn of his people here and, having been given the name of Emmons Preece, late Martin county court clerk, exchanged a few letters with him. Emmons Preece died soon afterward and the writer, failing-to find another correspondent, dropped the matter. Between the Texas Preeces and their relatives in Kentucky a genealogical void prevailed, deepened by a century and a quarter and two thousand miles.\n\nOne day last summer the writer of this article spent a lazy, sunny day on the lawn reading Harold Preeces THE DALTON GANG. It is one of the greatest of true Westerns and the impact of the story survived. A few weeks later, while glancing over a (sic) newsstand in Prestonsburg, REAL WEST magazine stood out in blue, red and gold. Featured was an article, \"My Grandfather, Dick Preece,\" by the author of the Dalton story. I bought the magazine, took it home, settled in a chair to read. Paging idly through the magazine, I came to the Preece story and after one brief glance at the picture of Dick Preece at the beginning of the story, almost stood upright in surprise.\n\nThe old gentleman, whose picture was taken when his Comanche fighting days and lawman career were ended, wore white mustache, burnsides and whiskers. I remembered a Dick Preece, Betsy Layne, miner, back in the 1930's, who wore such a hirsute adornment. The two men were as much alike as if they had been identical twins. That night I wrote Harold Preece a letter in care of his New York publisher. Back came a reply. Yes, he said, Dick Preece was an Eastern Kentuckian, close relative of the Preeces in this area. Dick Preece, Harold wrote, was born in Kentucky, and had gone to Texas at the age of six with his father. Beyond that the author knew very little. He requested I write his sister, Louise Preece, in Dallas. The family was very much interested in their history and would like to reconstruct it.\n\nLouise Preece is a tireless worker, combining imagination with intelligence, both necessary for success in research. Forest Preece, of Inez, Martin County, joined and the three of us organized an intense effort to reconstruct Preece history. Scores of letters were written, many important libraries were combed, church records were viewed, interviews with oldsters were held.\n\nSlowly the Preece history took form, Harold Preece had already done research on his grandfather before he wrote the REAL WEST story. Louise Preece to the story of William Martin Preece and Elizabeth Gideon Priest was unable to find the parents of either. Were they Kentuckians, Virginians or North Carolinians? The job devoted upon me to find at least the father of William, the Texas immigrant.\n\nI thumbed through countless books, manuscripts and old court records. Scores of letters brought little or no information. Finally, I had a bit of luck when in looking through Robert M. Addington's HISTORY OF SCOTT COUNTY, VIRGINIA, I found a three page quotation from a manuscript written by Capt. John Redd, Powell's Valley, Virginia pioneer Captain Redd had noted that William Preece had founded a fort in the valley in 1773. Could this be the father of William Martin Preece, who had gone to Texas? His life span would be about right for him to be his father. How to prove it seemed hopeless, for the Russell county, Virginia, records had been partially destroyed in the Civil War. For weeks there was stalemate. Forest Preece continued his interviews and search of church records. Louise Preece continued her search in Texas and (sic) (sic) marshalled many of her friends to assist her in Kansas, Tennessee, Virginia and North Carolina.\n\nStalemate on the problem remained until one day while pouring over' a history of the Stratton family I had written a bell rang. In consulting some old records in the archives of a Stratton descendant at Stanville, he had particularly wanted me to see the records he had rescued from the fire when his stepmother burned the papers in the old Preece trunk. Little interested in the Priest or Preece families the spelling is a matter of preference in different locales. I made a few hasty excerpts from an old will copy, deeds and land patents. I filed them away and forgot about them.\n\nForgot about them until I began to thumb through the Stratton family history when the association of Stratton's and Preeces caused me to remember. I went to my files, took out the brief excerpts. One of the papers Stratton had rescued was a copy of the will of William Priest, the original lost in the Civil War, made in 1803 in Russell county, Virginia. In it the old pioneer and Indian fighter had named Richard Preece, his son as executor. Other heirs were named and their portions of the estate defined by the testator. The long hunt was ended. William Priest, of Powell's Valley, was the father of. William Martin Preece, Texas immigrant.\n\nPerhaps no other genealogical and historical problem ever had so many little events to-bear so fruitfully on its successful solving. There had been the reading of THE DALTON GANG and a sudden interest in the writings of Harold Preece. There was the magazine story in REAL WEST that had prompted communication with the famous writer. There was old Dick Preece, the white haired miner at Betsy Layne who resembled his Texas cousin, Dick Preece, Comanche Indian and outlaw foe. There was the rescue of the family papers by a Preece descendant, one of them a copy of his ancestor's will, the original of which was lost in the holocaust of war. Finally, there had been a sudden remembrance of the old will by association of the families of Stratton and Preece while glancing through a Stratton family manuscript.\n\nThese little events or incidents had been pivotal in reconstructing a family history.\n\nSince the appearance of this article in The Floyd County Times, further research in Thwaite's Dunmore's War shows that not only William Priest, but Samuel and David Priest, were on the Muster Roll of Capt. Daniel Smith's Company, Fort Elk Garden, in August, 1774. William Priest was one of the scouts of the Upper Clinch Valley during the. summer and fall of 1774, and was also stationed at the Maiden Spring and Crab Orchard Forts. Samuel and David Priest \"found bread.\" This discovery documents Preece family tradition that they came with a kinsman, Daniel Boone, but that, Boone left. them to construct a fort while he went on and founded Boonesborough.. With the Priest's in the Powell Valley were men whose name correspond with allied family surnames: Andrew Hatfield, Christy Martin, Phillip Martin, William, John, and Hugh Moor, Sam and John Savage, Samuel Vance, Arthur Blackburn, Dangerfield and John Harmon, and most of all the names of Shannon's.\n\nThese Shannon names are especially significant because of their inter-marriage with the Stratton's and, Preece's or Priest's) and because all three group came from Amherst County, Virginia into Kentucky and Tennessee. The Powell Valley muster roll of Capt. Daniel Smith also included the names of Samuel, Thomas and John Shannon. It was Samuel who drove in cattle to feed the hungry men of Fort Blackmore, although he pled for more protection, and it was undoubtedly about Samuel when Maj. Arthur Campbell wrote to Col. William Preston under date of October 16, 1774, Royal Oaks, \"I am obliged to continue Shannon out here sometimes as he is a forward careful hand, and I am of late much put to it to get provisions carried out to Blackmore.\"\n\nInteresting biographical data is given on the Shannon's by Henry Scalf, who is a descendant of Solomon Stratton. This Stratton was with the Illinois Expedition with Gen. George Rogers Clark. (Later on a younger brother, William Clark, was to have with him a Pvt. George Shannon on the famed Lewis and Clark Expedition). Mr. Scalf, well known writer on Kentucky history, and publisher of a genealogical magazine, THE EAST KENTUCKIAN (on the Dallas Public Library shelves) states that the Shannon's of this area came from Balcony Falls, Amherst County, Virginia, in 1796. This line was descended from the marriage of William Laine, a Revolutionary soldier, to Nancy Shannon in Amherst County. James Shannon Layne founded the family in Lawrence County and the surrounding area of Kentucky. He further cites from an old manuscript, of which the author is unknown, that the Bible records of James Shannon Layne showed that William Layne Shannon of Tazewell County, Virginia, was born October 13, 1772, and that apparently a Methodist minister by the name of Billy Shannon from Tazewell County was of this same family of Laynes. Billy Shannon died at the home of his son, Thomas. (Amherst County marriage records reveal that in 1780 marriage occurred between a Thomas Laine, Jr., and Mary Stratton, who was the daughter of Henry Stratton. - L.P.) The manuscript further showed that William Shannon had a brother by the name of Layne Shannon. This brother died in Wyoming County, West Virginia.\n\n\"These Shannon's.,\" Mr. Scalf related, \"had intermarried with the Stratton's in Amherst, and they continued to intermarry after they came to Kentucky. There are plenty of Stratton's here today with 'Shannon' as a middle name. They have been important people in the development of the region....I think William Laine's (Layne) father was also a William Laine.\"\n\nThis Shannon line, with branches in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri was perpetuated in Texas when William Martin Preece (Priest) and Elizabeth Gideon (Giddens) Preece came to Red River County, Texas after leaving Pike County, Kentucky in 1838. They had a land grant in Hopkins County, but moved on through Lamar and Hopkins Counties, and-then into Travis County about 1845. Theirs was a sad mission in the latter county. They wanted to search for the grave of their son, Reuben R., who went with the Red River Volunteers from Clarksville (The Northern Standard, June 3, 1846) \"to help fight Santa Anna.\" When the Preeces reached Travis County they settled in the hills near Austin. Like their ancestory, they did not want civilization to encroach too much on them. Today the site of their last homestead includes part of Hickmantown (named Hickman kin) in the Highland Lakes area. (As a little girl I could climb one of the chinaberry trees in my grandmother's yard and see the capitol dome-L.P.) The Preeces left behind in the Red River area other kin, including another Tandy Stratton, grandson of the Tandy who married Mary Preece, and Elizabeth Gideon Preece's brother, Absolem, who secured a land grant in 1832. There was also Reuben Gideon (only the name was later known as Giddens), of Floyd County, Kentucky, who came in 1839. A Methodist Episcopal minister, he performed the marriage ceremony of William Martin Preece and his daughter, Elizabeth in Pike County, Kentucky, in 1825. His wife is believed to have been Nancy Stratton, since marriage records of Wilkes County, North Carolina for 1797, a trail of migration for these related individuals, show such a marriage, and a Reuben Gideon is shown on the 1810 and 1820 Census records along with Stratton's, etc.\n\nIn time to be listed on the 1860 Census of Travis County, Texas, came Elizabeth Watkins Shannon, also of Stratton descent, who was born in Washington County, Arkansas. Lately widowed, her husband, David Wilburn Shannon, had died in Neosho, Newton County, Missouri, where he had taken his family. He is shown on the 1850 Census of Newton County, Missouri to have been born in Tennessee, where Elizabeth Gideon is also said to have been born. The Shannon's children were born in Arkansas and Missouri and then again in Arkansas as they returned there. The 1830 Census of Washington County, Arkansas lists the names of Granville, Hugh, and Joseph Shannon. The Watkins' came from Wales into Kentucky, and thence into Arkansas. Elizabeth Shannon is buried in the hill section near Austin, in the Preece cemetery while William and Elizabeth Preece are buried in Post Oak Bend Cemetery \"up the river.\"\n\nThe Shannon's first settled at Gilleland's Creek, once a fort. Then followed the usual family pattern, established among the early pioneers when the population was smaller and distance was great. Three sons of William Martin Preece married three daughters of Elizabeth Watkins Shannon: Richard Lincoln Preece (my grandfather- L.P.) was married to Mary Catherine Shannon; Wayne Pulaski Preece, whose son, Wayne, is now the patriarch of the-Preece family in Austin, married Margaret Shannon; Zachary Taylor Preece was married to Francis (or Fanny) Shannon. Their many descendants today live in Austin and some remain in what is left of the hill country.\n\nThe sons of Martin and Elizabeth Preece fought no less bravely in our country's hectic but victorious existence than the sons of Alexander Boone Preece and Louvenia Stratton, back in Kentucky. Louvenia, who was married to Alexander Boone Preece, in 1823, was descended from Solomon Stratton, the Revolutionary soldier who left Amherst County, Virginia, and came to the Big Sandy Valley in 1796. With him were other Stratton's and allied lines. He founded Prestonsburg, in Floyd County, and the Stratton Settlement at Mare Creek, Narrows. Both Forrest Preece and Mrs. Winnie May Preece Allen are descendants of this couple. Mrs. Allen now lives in Arlington, Virginia, and handles the research in the Library of Congress. Forrest Preece has a son busy in the London libraries.\n\nThe early historical background of this entire clan is merely the background of bitter struggle, of victory, and of the ever-onward push of civilization by those early pioneers who helped to build a nation. The complex pattern of migrations and formations are like jigsaw puzzles--they join, break apart, and join again-but always there is the marvelous continuity that makes the final superb picture. Research leads not into one trail, but many, until there is an emergence of lines other than one's own to be recognized by the intrepid genealogist. History lives, it blossoms and even fades, but it regenerates itself through tradition, historical records, perhaps in some tattered book on a shelf or some forgotten tombstone, as in the Preece Cemetery on Bull Creek near Austin. The shafts of sunlight penetrate the cedarbrake where lie the graves of Union soldiers, their widows, and some of their descendants.\n\nMore About WILLIAM PRIEST:\n\nAlt Birth Location: Chester County, Pennsylvania61\n\nMove 1: 1766, Moved from Pennsylvania to Virginia61\n\nNotes for MARY GRIFFITH:\n\nThis is the Grantors index to Russell County, Virginia, Deed Book #3, 1798-1806.\n\nPreece, Mary (mother of Richard) Hoke, George (elder) 21 Jun 1803 p. 389\n\nPreece, Mary (mother of Richard) Hoke, George (younger) 21 Jun 1803 p. 389\n\nPreece, Mary (widow) Crumwell, Charles 26 Sep 1803 p.434\n\n[Were they selling off all their property to move to Floyd County, Kentucky?]\n\nMore About MARY GRIFFITH:\n\nImmigration: 03 Jun 1747, To Lebanon County, Pennsylvania61\n\nMarriage Notes for WILLIAM PRIEST and MARY GRIFFITH:\n\nMarried in the Hill Evangelical Lutheran Church in North Annville Township by the Rev.

Source:Farley Wolford\n\n*******************\n\nELK GARDEN FORT\n\nThis fort was located just south of State Route 19, on land now owned by the Stuart Land and Cattle Company, and in the general vicinity of the Elk Garden Methodist Church. Just who owned the land on which the old fort stood has not been ascertained, but those owning land in the immediate vicinity of the fort was Captain John Dunkin, Captain John Kinkead, Richard Price and Solomon Litton. That it was a stockaded fort is beyond question, but as to its size and shape nothing is known.\n\nNo record has been found of an actual Indian assault directly upon the Elk Garden Fort though it is very possible there was such, as many people were killed and captured in the Elk Garden section from 1774 to the end of Indian depredations which ceased with the slaying of the half-breed Chief Benge in 1794. The fort was manned throughout this period by militia.\n\nAndrew Lyman who filed his pension application in Bath County, Kentucky. in 1834, says:\n\n\"In 1776, I entered the service under Captain John Kinkead and marched immediately to the station called Elk Garden, and as the object of our service was to keep down the Indians, we were put to repairing and fixing up the station.\" The statement of Lyman shows that although the fort was only two years old, it was in need of repair, which shows that green logs embedded in earth as a stockade soon rot and no doubt, the stockades had to be repaired and rotten logs replaced frequently, as well as repair to the cabins and buildings inside the stockades.\n\nAT THE ELK GARDEN FORT - 13 AUGUST TO 18 NOVEMBER, 1774 1.

After the Peace of Paris of 1763, the British had undisputed claim to the area west of the Appalachian Mountains. The people of Virginia did not like the British presence in their state. Also, the British did not want the Virginians to settle on any land west of the Appalachians, but the Virginians did not agree. Many white people were continuing to settle on lands west of the Appalachian Mountains and the Indians were harassing them.\n\nLord Dunmore went to Pittsburgh in the spring of 1774 hoping to make peace with the Indians. Soon, it became clear that peace would not happen. He began recruiting men and soon had a force of about 1,000 soldiers. After a couple of weeks of drill, Dunmore led the troops to the mouth of the Little Kanawha River.\n\nWhile camped at the Little Kanawha River, Dunmore was to meet with his officers who already had about 1,000 men camped about six miles away from Dunmore. The Battle of Point Pleasant prevented them from meeting.\n\nThe Shawnee leader, Cornstalk, had a loosely organized group of approximately 500 Indians waiting to attack Dunmore's officers. In the early morning hours, the Indians crossed the Ohio River and attacked. The Battle of Point Pleasant lasted into the afternoon and was very intense. However, by the end of the day, the Indians were retreating to the north bank of the Ohio River in defeat.\n\nAfter the Battle of Point Pleasant, Dunmore marched his men north to the Shawnee villages. At this point, he was able to negotiate for peace. As a result of Dunmore's War, the Indians agreed to give up all of their white prisoners, restore all captured horses and other property, and not to hunt south of the Ohio River. Also, they were to allow boats on the Ohio River and not harass them. This opened up present day West Virginia and Kentucky for settlement.\n\n********************\n\nOn the 25th of December, 1774, Martin set out again for Powell's Valley (This is in Lee County which is in the Southwest Corner of the State of Virginia by the Cumberland Gap) with 16 or 18 men. They went back to the same place, just east of Rose Hill. They built several strong cabins with stockades for good defense. They fenced part of the Indian Old Field with rails and brush and planted a good crop of corn. There was abundance of all sorts of game for meat supplies. This location was north of the present highway No. 58, above a big spring which flows out near a large sycamore tree and passes immediately under the highway.\n\nDuring the next summer, the Indians made some trouble for the people at Martin's Settlement. William Priest with about ten men went up the Valley a few miles and built another fort, cleared some land and prepared to make a crop. William Mumps also took a few men and built another fort still further up the Valley at Sinking Springs (Natural Bridge) west of the present site of Jonesville. They deadened timber, cleared land, and prepared for a crop. This was about 20 miles from Martin's settlement. Source: GATEWAY TO THE WEST By J. M. Moseley\n\n*******************\n\nIn January 1775 General Joseph Martin built Martin's Station on the Wilderness road to Kentucky. William and his son William were among the original settlers and they claimed land about 60 miles west of David's land in the Clinch Valley\n\nSometime before 1776 William Priest built a Fort. Priest's Fort is another fort found only in the memoirs of John Redd, and of it he says:\n\n\"That it was located some 5 or 6 miles above Martin's Station and was on no water course. It was built about the same time as Mump's Fort, and William Priest, its builder, was perhaps a Henry County, Virginia, man in the valley through Martin's influence. Five or six miles from Martin's Station would locate this fort between the towns of Rose Hill and Jonesville, in Lee County. This fort was evacuated at the same time as Mump's and Martin's, and the men from both fled to Fort Blackmore, in June, 1776, when alarmed by the outbreak of the Cherokee War.\" All evidence points to the fact that it was, as Redd says, never reoccupied after the initial evacuation, as no other mention of it has been gleaned from any source.\n\nand\n\nAT THE ELK GARDEN FORT - 13 AUGUST TO 18 NOVEMBER, 1774 1.

Hamilton\n\n*********************\n\nFrom Ruth Priest Dixon we learn that William Priest built a Fort soon after Joseph Martin finished his. He built his for five or six miles up the Powell from Martin's Fort on the land he had settled. Then William Mumps built a fort at Sinking Springs about 14 miles further up the valley. These were the only three forts in the Powell Valley during 1775 and 1776. After the spring of 1776 these Forts were never occupied again.

Hamilton\n\nFrom an unpublished manuscript, Indian Atrocities Along the Clinch, Powell and Holston Rivers, pages 60-62.\n\nBurton Litton, brother of Solomon Litton, was a son of John Litton, and this family were early settlers of the Elk Garden section of present Russell County, Virginia. At the time of his death, Burton Litton had a brother, James Litton, and wife, Elizabeth. (1) Burton Litton was a member of Captain Daniel Smith's militia company in 1774, while that part of Russell County was then Fincastle County\n\nOf William Priest little is known, except that he lived on Priest Mountain, at Elk Garden. He served in the militia company of Captain Daniel Smith, at the Elk Garden Fort from the 13th of August to 18th of November, 1774 (2), along with a Thomas and David Priest, who were probably brothers, or maybe sons. During this term of service, sometime between August and October of 1774, he was paid for 7 days as an Indian Scout. (3) The only court record I find relating to him was in the court of Fincastle County On November 2, 1773, where he, along with others was appointed to view a road from the Maiden Springs settlement into the Great Road, the latter perhaps, being the Fincastle main road leading from the east to the western country.\n\nThe details of this killing are best told in the words of Isaac Crabtree in his pension statement filed in Overton County, TN, September 27, 1832. Isaac was born in Baltimore County, MD in 1757. (4) Crabtree says:\n\n\"...In the next year, 1778, he again turned out a volunteer ranger, he thinks about the last of May, and went to the Elk Garden Fort and joined Captain John Kinkead (Kincaid) and ranged about that fort. He states that Colonel (then Captain, later Colonel) Daniel Smith came to the fort and took him and several other men, making ten, and went down Clinch, and as they came to Glade Hollow Fort, [Fort Christian, better known as Glade Hollow Fort lies between Dickensonville and Lebanon on Cedar Creek.] they met about the same number of Indians. He, and Burton Litton and William Priest were some distance in front of the others when they met the Indians. The Indians were laying in ambush in two sink holes (5), and on each side of the Trace (6) and when they arose and placed themselves in a fighting attitude and fired on him. When the firing commenced Colonel Smith, and the balance of the men with him, wheeled and ran. He, and his company kept their ground waiting for them to come up, until the Indians, or some of them, were within 30 or 40 yards of affiant and the balls flying around him like hailstones from a thunder storm. He began to think it was time to take care of himself, seeing by this time the whole of his company had taken flight and left him. He retreated a short distance and was closely pursued by the enemy, an and he wheeled to see how close they were to him and saw one within thirty yards. He immediately raised his gun and taking aim at his breast, he fired, and the Indian fell back and uttered some coarse, loud noise. He then overtook some of his company and tried to rally them, but without effect. They continued their retreat and two of them were killed while they were running before him. He then began to mend his gait and soon overtook the foremost men and went by Col. Smith, but was unable to rally. Thence the two men killed were the two who went in advance of himself, Burton Litton and William Priest.\n\nBurton Litton, was a brother of Solomon Litton, who along with Captain John Dunkin, was captured by the Indians in 1780 at Riddles' Station and carried to Canada, where they were held until the end of the Revolutionary War.\n\nAt a court held for Washington County, Virginia, on August 17, 1779, is entered this order:\n\n\"On motion of Elizabeth Litton and James Laughlin (7), administration is granted them on the estate of Burton Litton, deceased, who made oaths thereto with John Kinkead and Samuel VanHook as securities.\" Appraisers of the estate were, Thomas and Richard Price, James Scott and John Lewis.\n\n(1) Washington County, Virginia Order Book 1, page 69 & Survey Entry Book 1, page 75.\n\n(2) Draper Mss 6 XX 106\n\n(3) Draper Mss 5 XX 2\n\n(4) Crabtree statement also in Draper Mss 3 DD 40\n\n(5) There are huge sink holes around the upper end of Glade Hollow.\n\n(6) This suggests that Glade Hollow Fort lay on the Kentucky Trace.\n\n(7) James Laughlin was a brother-in-law of Burton Litton, having married his sister, Elizabeth Laughlin.\n\nNote, 16 Aug 2002: New Information has been located about these deaths in the form of the Revolutionary Pension statement of Edward Dorton. Edward Dorton links these deaths to that of his brother, not named, as well as a forth man, Michael Auxier. Below is the statement of Edward Dorton:\n\nRevolutionary War pension record from National Archives\n\nEdward Dorton\n\nState of Kentucky\n\nFloyd County\n\nOn the 12th day of December 1833, personally appears before the distinguished Justice of the Peace for the county aforesaid now sitting, Edward Dorton a resident of Kentucky in the county of Floyd, aged eighty two years: who being first duly sworn according to the law doth on his oath make the following declaration in order to obtain the benefit of the act of Congress passed June 7, 1832; that he entered in the service of the United States under the following named officers and served as herein stated; that in the spring of 1776 the Indians became troublesome in the western part of Virginia so much so that it prevented a band of immigrants from proceeding to Kentucky. Said applicant was then residing in Washington County, Virginia and on the waters of Powell's River in Powell's Valley. Col. William Campbell the Col. of the county ordered that a volunteer company should be raised to suppress the Indians: which company this applicant states he enlisted in as a volunteer for \"six months\" in the month of March 1776, the day of the month not recollected.\n\nUnder Capt. Bickley and Lieutenant Cowan, Ensign Robinson the company immediately commenced their march down Powell's Valley to \"Cumberland Gap\" and there we were fired upon by the Indians. The firing was continued warily by both sides for some"
