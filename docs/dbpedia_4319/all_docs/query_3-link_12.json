        "text": "Coming from a family of 13 children, 7 sisters and 5 brothers, with me stuck somewhere in the middle, I had many role models. There are poets, boxers, wrestlers cosmetologists, and real estate agents among us. Yet, writing is in all of our blood. I remember the very first poem I wrote at the age of nine. I've always loved to write. I am never without a pad and pen. I capture thoughts as I drive, sit quietly and even in my sleep. It's in my blood. \"Lessons Learned on My Way Home\" is my first published work. I am the very proud parent of one adult daughter, Daria Nicole. I am a community volunteer, motivational speaker/minister, member of Toastmasters International, and a member of First Free Will Baptist Church of Indianapolis. I attended Indiana University where I majored in Psychology. My educational goals include obtaining a masters degree in Theology. Learning never ends! Don't YOU Forget to Get Your Lessons! OJT for my first book was obtained: In the Wilderness, The Valley, and in the Presence of God."
