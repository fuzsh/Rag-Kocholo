        "text": "HOUSE DEMOCRATS NEWS\n\nAmid an ongoing pandemic that has been particularly hard on the hospitality industry, liquor license holders in New Mexico will get a break from fees in 2021 under new legislation unanimously passed by the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee Wednesday.\n\nSponsored by Senator Elizabeth “Liz” Stefanics (D-Cerrillos), Senator Jacob Candelaria (D-Albuquerque), Senator Brenda McKenna (D-Corrales) and Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo), Senate Bill 2 amends the Liquor Control Act to require the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Regulation and Licensing Department to waive fees for all liquor licenses issued and renewed for the 2021 calendar year. The bill contains an emergency clause and would become effective immediately upon signature by the Governor.\n\n“We know the bars and restaurants that hold these licenses are having a hard time,” said Rep. McQueen. “With SB 2, we aim to provide relief and support for them. We have all seen how difficult this year has been for these small businesses that are so valued by our local communities. Waiving this expense will help folks open and rehire faster as our economy restarts.”\n\nSenate Bill 2 passed the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee with a unanimous 8-0 vote, and will be heard next on the House floor.\n\nMembers of the public can track legislation on the New Mexico Legislature website, access committee meetings and House floor sessions via the Webcasts tab, or participate by Zoom to provide public comment on committee hearings. During the 2021 Legislative Session, the House of Representatives is focused on passing critical legislation while protecting the health and safety of the public, the staff, and the legislators."
