        "text": "Convention of States endorser and former U.S. representative from New Mexico Yvette Herrell will be the special guest on the next edition of \"COS at Home\".\n\n“COS at Home” is hosted by Convention of States Action regional director and political liaison Jonathan Viaud. This month’s edition airs on June 5, at 8:00 p.m. ET and can be live-streamed here.\n\nJonathan and Yvette will discuss her background, her career in politics and inside look at the D.C. swamp, and her decision to endorse the movement to call an Article V convention, which she broadly outlined in the following clip:\n\nAs always, this edition of \"COS at Home\" will feature timely updates about Convention of States Action's progress from across the country, produced by the talented Garrett “Producer G” Humbertson.\n\nBe sure to help make \"COS at Home\" interactive by participating in the Minutemen Mailbag segment. Questions that may be read and answered on the program can be sent to the Minutemen Mailbag via this link.\n\nYvette, a realtor and entrepreneur, was elected to the Congress in 2020. During her term in the U.S. House of Representatives, she was a member of the Freedom Caucus, opposed expanding federal regulation (particularly of small businesses), and was a vocal advocate for border security, evidenced by her 2021 call for the deployment of the National Guard along the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\n\"I’ve known Yvette Harrell for many years,\" said Convention of States Action co-founder and president Mark Meckler. \"You won’t meet a more steadfast conservative warrior. She’s NOT a politician even though she’s been in Congress…and that’s the highest compliment.\"\n\nYvette was defeated for re-election to the U.S. House in 2022 by less than one percent of the vote.\n\nPrior to her representation of New Mexico's 2nd district in Congress, Yvette served in the New Mexico House of Representatives from 2011 to 2019. She won office after winning the 2010 Republican Party primary election against incumbent Republican state representative Gloria Vaughn before winning the general election with 63 percent of the vote."
