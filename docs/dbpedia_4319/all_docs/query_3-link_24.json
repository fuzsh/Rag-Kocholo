        "text": "Thomas L. Vaughn, 79, of Monmouth, IL. died at 10:50 P.M. Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at OSF Holy Family Medical Center, Monmouth.\n\nTom was born on October 17, 1935 in Monmouth; he is the son of Kenneth Earland and Nina Geneva (Bolon) Vaughn. Tom was raised and educated in Monmouth and graduated from Monmouth High School in 1953. He attended Reedley College, Reedley, CA for a time.\n\nHe married Diana Dutton in Missouri in 1969. She preceded him in death on April 27, 2010.\n\nTom was a truck driver for Gambles and Vaughn's Transfer. He also was a service technician for Culligan in California from 1961-1964, and retired from Culligan in Monmouth in 1997. Tom was of Presbyterian faith and was a member of Faith United Presbyterian Church in Monmouth, where he served as a Deacon. He was an avid sports fan and enjoyed wood working.\n\nTom had a lot of names throughout his life. To some he was the \"Quarterback\", to some he was the \"Culligan Man\", and to his truck driver buddies he was \"Snuffy Smith\", all these names were used on a regular basis by his many lifelong friends. To his family he was husband, father, big brother, Uncle Tom, and cousin. It is said that a man can be judged by the quantity and quality of his friends. If this is true, Tom must have been a very special person.\n\nHis family would like to thank all of his friends for staying in touch with Tom throughout his battle with cancer. We all loved Tom and will miss him, but we will always remember what a great friend he was.\n\nSurviving Tom are two brothers; David (Gloria) Vaughn of Laton, CA, and Chuck (Doris) Vaughn of Stronghurst, IL. Also surviving is special cousin Pat Elmone of Pensacola Beach, FL., and several nieces, nephews, and cousins.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, wife, and two daughters; Leigh Anne Vaughn, Jennifer Vaughn, and his many special dogs.\n\nGraveside Services will be at 11:00 a.m., Monday, December 15, 2014 at Warren County Memorial Park in Monmouth. Memorials can be made to the Western Illinois Animal Rescue. McGuire & Davies Funeral Home and Crematory, Monmouth is handling the arrangements.
