        "text": "Vincent Jose Marquez, 19, was born November 9, 2001 in Farmington, New Mexico to Matthew and Aaryn Marquez. He departed his temporary home to live in his eternal home on Saturday, July 3rd 2021, where he rests peacefully in the arms of the LORD.\n\nVince is survived by his \"bef fen\" brothers: Cody Montano (Christine) of Casa Grande, Arizona, Von, Joel, and Gabriel Marquez of Bloomfield, New Mexico. Also surviving are his maternal great-grandfather Carroll Vaughn (Linda) of Bloomfield, his paternal grandmother Gloria Marquez of Bloomfield, his maternal grandparents Alan and Sheri Vaughn of Loving, his uncles and aunts Ross Marquez, Peter Marquez (Tonya), Leo Marquez (Monica), Liz Armenta, Chris Marquez, Patsy Marquez, Franco Marquez (Janelle), Daniel Vaughn (Danielle), Nate Vaughn (Misty) and numerous cousins.\n\nVince was preceded in death by his paternal grandfather Pete (Jose) Marquez; his aunt Louise Marquez and his uncle Robert (Bobby) Marquez.\n\nHe was loved and admired by those who knew him for many things: his winning smile, his athletic ability, his fiery spirit, and his words of encouragement. But most of all he was loved for his tender and generous heart.\n\nVince graduated from Bloomfield High School in 2020 where he excelled in sports. He was an outstanding football player and received a scholarship from Arizona Christian University.\n\nFuneral services will be held Saturday, July 10, 2021 at 10:00am at First Baptist Church, 200 W Sycamore in Bloomfield, New Mexico. Interment will be at New Rosa Cemetery in Arboles, Colorado immediately following the services.\n\nFriends and family are invited to visit over a meal at the home of Matthew and Aaryn Marquez 200 Ruth Lane in Bloomfield after the interment.\n\nBecause of the way Vince loved children, in lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the children's charity of your choice."
