We will never forget the sacrifices made by the men and women in uniform and especially those who gave the most.\n\nSemper FI\n\nName: Jim Smyth\n\nLocation: New York\n\nComments: As a former US Marine I want to offer my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Bobby Warms.\n\nName: Michael Cosyns\n\nLocation: Deux-Acren/BELGIUM\n\nComments: Please accept my heartfelt condolences to the death of your son and husband Robert. I am convinced that he died in a battle between barbary and civilization, and that the sacrifices made by Bobby and his brothers-in-arms are making this battleground a place where one day Freedom and Justice will reign.\n\nWhen that day comes and the region of the Middle East is no longer bringing forth evil men intent upon wreaking terrible havoc in your streets and cities, people will realize that many live because Bobby and his comrades died.\n\nI will pray for Bobby and for all of you. May his child grow up in a better world. I have saved Bobby's photograph and will never forget his name and image as long as I live. Thank you for Bobby.\n\nHe died as a Warrior and a Proud Member of the Marines. Although I never served myself in the military, I think it is fitting that my farewell reflects this. To you, Bobby:\n\nSEMPER FIDELIS.\n\nName: Vaughn Pakkala\n\nComments: I just saw the video of a fallen marine, Cpl Bobby Warns. It was beautiful. Bobby, I sure was a wonderful Man and Marine. Although I didn't know him, he is a fallen comrade of mine. I'm a retired Marine since 1989 and serves with many of these fine men and women. I can't express the gratitude I feel in a note, but the video says it all. If only people new the freedoms they have with the sacrifices of these fine Marines.

As a member of the United States Navy, there are rivalries all of the time between the Navy and Marine Corps but when all is said and done, we are all brothers to each other. I currently have friends that are with the 2/24 right now in Iraq as the \"field docs\" of the battalion. I think and pray for them every day that God will keep his hand over them. And now I pray that God will keep and continue to keep his loving arms around all of you. Know that God loves you and, even though we have never met, my family and I love you as well. If there is anything that you need, please feel free to contact me. Again God bless and keep you as our prayer.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael E.

Rodriguez\n\nLocation: Youngstown, Ohio\n\nComments: Dear Warns family,\n\nMy sincerest condolences to you all. As brother of USMC Gunnery Sergeant Pedro L. Rodriguez of H&S Co., 2/24 Marines, I can't express how deeply sorry I am for your loss. I myself worry day and night, and pray to God incessantly for my brother and all of our boys and girls serving across the globe. The video which I just finished viewing brought tears to my eyes, and pulled strongly at my heart. One thing I can say is that although, I didn't know Bobby, in the 5 minutes it took to view this video, he became as my own brother, and as flesh of my flesh and blood of my blood. I cried for him as I would have any member of my immediate family. Quite frankly, I'm a hard man, hardened by street life, and time served, but nothing softens the heart of a man more than knowing that there is someone out there, in another part of the world, on guard day and night, protecting, fighting, and sacrificing everything he holds dear, to ensure our freedom, and the freedom of those oppressed by tyranny, and terrorism. Bobby is not only a hero to you, but to me and my family as well. I thank God for him, and for my brother who's still in Iraq, and for all of our brave men and women around the world. Thank you very much for the honor and privilege of knowing an excellent young man, and a great Marine. God bless you all.\n\nRespectfully, Carlos A.

Otte\n\nLocation: Coldwater, Ohio\n\nComments: Thank you for creating a man who stood up to the evils of the world. It is men like him that make me want to be a Marine. May the higher powers of the world watch over him.\n\nName: HerbThompson\n\nLocation: Kalamazoo, MI\n\nComments: To the family and friends: Our hearts are with you in this hour. A buddy of mine, a Marine, sent this link. Cpl Warns gave more than mere men can see. If someone looks at me they's say \"Oh, he's African-American\". It's people like Cpl Warns that make me proud to be just plain American. It doesn't yet sell in the media that someone like me is alomst 50 years old, has been happily married for 22 years, has fathered 2 children in wedlock, owns a small business, pays taxes, isn't on welfare, likes Classical, Jazz and Country music. The media says 'Iraq is not worth it.' That cheapens the sacrifice of our brave men and women in the armed forces and that is totally unacceptable. Don't ever let anyone tell you that Cpl Warns died in vain. He will never be forgotten. He's a Marine-- they don't come any better.\n\nName: Cpt. H. R. Cleveland\n\nLocation: Indio, California\n\nComments: Simple and plainly defined, a leader is a Marine who has followers. He deserves to have followers. He has earned recognition. Authority alone is no longer enough to command respect.\n\nA leader has faith in people. He believes in them, trusts them and drews out the best in them. He has found that they rise to high expectations.\n\nIt is coming into a full realization that the master voiced the secret of victorious being, when He declared that the Kingdom of God is not far off, but that it is within you now!\n\nCaptian U.S. Army Aircore WWII (retired)\n\nName: Brandon Havens\n\nLocation: Kane'ohe Bay Hawaii\n\nComments: I'm sorry to hear about your loss. I can tell just from the pictures that he must have been a great person. I wish I could have had the chance to cross paths with him to find out first hand. Even more I wish he could have seen his babygirl. You are all in my thoughts and prayers.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLCpl Brandon W Havens\n\nSemper Fidelis\n\nName: Chief Warrant Officer Ken Austin\n\nLocation: MCB Hawaii\n\nComments: My thoughts and prayers are with you all.

Austin\n\nName: MARYLOU HARPER\n\nLocation: TRAER IOWA\n\nComments: I KNOW THE SIMPLE WORDS I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS IS ENOOUGH TO FILL THE HUGE HOLE IN YOUR HEART YOU FEEL NOW. BUT I PRAY THAT IT CAN BRING SOME PEACE TO YOU AND TO YOUR LITTLE GIRL ONE DAY. MY HUSBAND SERVED 21 YEARS IN USMC. WE RECENTLY MOVED FROM CHERRY POINT BASE AREA IN HAVELOCK NC. WE BOUGHT A HOBBY FARM IN OCTOBER, A LIFE LONG DREAM COME TRUE FOR US. AND WITH ALOT OF HARD WORK AND FEW COATS OF PAINT. THIS OLD FARM WILL BE A FARM AGAIN. I SEND MY DEEPEST PRAYERS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS . AND TO YOUR LITTLE GIRL ....GODBLESS.\n\nName: Mike Smith (Sgt.-ret)\n\nLocation: Tampa, Florida\n\nComments: To the family and friends of Cpl.Bobby Warns,\n\nI have just finished watching the fine tribute to a fellow Marine and to your dear friend or relative. I just wanted to write a short note to tell you all that I will be lifting you up in my prayers tonight and for time to come. I often receive emails from friends who are serving in Iraq at this time and with each casualty reported I also feel the piercing pain that you feel when you think of Bobby. You see, I served in Desert Storm back in the early 90's and during combat operations I also experienced loss. And to this day I still wear my dog-tags that I wore during that war to remember those who died while valiently serving this blessed country. I will now add another name and face to my prayers and thoughts as I clench my dog-tags throughout the day as I say a prayer. A prayer for the families left behind to have God given strength to go forward and use the memory of a loved one to motivate them to be better in this world and to take their loved ones place in the fight for FREEDOM whether it is on a battlefield or here in the states as a proud citizen. My prayer is also for those who are still there fighting even now as I sit in my home, that God would give them courage, marksmanship, strength, wisdom, alertness, and motivation to finish a well worthy cause of bringing FREEDOM to a country and ensuring FREEDOM will never be taken away from America. God Bless You for your sacrifice and may God bless our Marines!\n\nSemper Fi,\n\nMike Smith\n\nName: William Browne\n\nLocation: Culver City, California\n\nComments: I am very sorry for your lose.

I did not know your son/husband/father. My job did not take me out to the line companies like it did so many others however, some of my snipers may have known or worked alongside him. The fact that I did not know Cpl Warns does not erase the fact that his death was painful. Like all Marines, we were brothers, we just didn't get to play together. This tribute to him and the emotional and incredible video in his honor only tells me that he was loved beyond the bounds of this earth. Much the way that I love all of my children as well, I'm sure. I have no doubt that he is looking down upon this battalion because all of our fallen heroes are and they continue to fight with us. And as he looks down on us I also have no doubt that his eyes are filled with tears. Because perhaps he now realizes how much he was loved not only by his family but by his brother Marines. I know he continues to live among you, please know that he continues to live with us also. He always will.\n\nGod bless you and I hope every day is better than the one before. His sacrifice was not in vain.\n\nRespectfully and Always Faithful.\n\nGunnery Sergeant Jeff Chang\n\nPlt Sgt, STA 2/24\n\nName: Mike and Tammy Herstad\n\nLocation: Kirkland, IL\n\nComments: Our deepest sympathies are extended to your family.

We pray daily for the families that have lost loved ones and your family is included in those prayers. Words cannot express how much we appreciate the sacrifice you have made. We also want you to know that what he gave his life for is not a wasted effort. What the men and women of our military are doing over there will have an impact on the whole world in the future years. May our Lord bless you and be the comfort that only He can be.

We are deeply grateful for U.S. Marines and the wonderful work they are doing in bringing freedom around the world.\n\nSo often we can be at a loss for words to express our heart-felt thanks, this is because we are awed by those who gave so much so quietly.\n\nGod Bless you,\n\nRalph & Mary Oberlin\n\nName: C V Warren\n\nLocation: Mansfield,OH.\n\nComments: Dear Folks,\n\nI'm a Vietnam Vet,the war that I served in has so many negatives attached to it that many feel my service was in vein,someone greater than me will ultimately decide that.I just want you to know that in the case of your loved one,the great and high value of his service is unquestionable,he made the ultimate sacrifice for a cause that is as noble as the American Revolution and WW II. History will someday praise Iraqi Freedom as an action that saved the world from a new form of fascism and in doing so raised the level of peace for the entire world.From the bottom of my heart I thank your son and you for his contribution.\n\nGod Bless,C.V.

Thirty-three years ago, my grandfather was murdered in Thailand just six months before he was to retire from a lifelong career in the Air Force. He fought in WWII, the Korean and the Vietnam wars. He requested to be removed from his desk job at the Pentagon during the Vietnam war so he could fly the B-52s over Khe San where my uncle (his son) was under seige. I was so proud of Grandpa when I learned of this just a year ago from my uncle. I was only 10 years old when he died and this gave some insight into the kind of person he was.\n\nMy uncle, Skip Funk, left a message on this website that I came across as I was reading some of them. I am so proud of him also. Skip has recently told us a lot of events from his combat days. It has made me really appreciate all that people like Bobby sacrifice for people like me - people they don't even know. It makes me wonder why some soldiers, like my uncle, survive combat and others, like Bobby, don't. I know God's plan is much bigger and we don't always understand it. But I am grateful for your son, your husband, and your daddy. My life is blessed and safer because of his sacrifice.\n\nLove and Thanks in Christ,\n\nLori Fort\n\nName: CWO-2 SHAWN FRANKLIN\n\nLocation: CAMP PENDLETON CA\n\nComments: To the family/friends of my fallen comrade.

He sets no limitations on the power of thought; he recognizes that big thinking precedes big achivement. He creates metal pictures of his goals, then works to make those pictures become realities. He knows that everything starts with an idea and that the creative power of thought is the greater power in the universe. He sees with the \"signle eye\" of intense concentration, seeking facts just as powerful searchlight penetrates the darkness. He keeps an open mind as a factory and gives it the raw material, the fact and the data, from which ideas are factioned. He thinks both objestively and subjectively; he gathers mental power both from the world without and without and the mind within. He uses the magic power of his subconscious mind, commanding it to come up with ideas while he sleeps; he knows that thought, like a tree grows night and day. He studies the laws of cause and effect and strives to work in harmony with them. He approuches problems both intuitively and logically; he uses the light of his imagination to create and his critical mind to judge; he tests inspiration with logic. He avoids the one-track mind and sends his mind forth in all directions to expland the range of his mental horizons. He strives to develop a mature mind without losing the simplicity of childhood. He creates ideas with humility knowing that behind the idea that he calls his own are the thought and efforts of many men. He realizes that he is at the creative best when he is in tune with the Infinite; when he is open and receptive to the higher powerof mind and spirit. He exercises his God-given power to choose his own direction and influence his own destiny and he tries to deside wisely and well *******\n\nName: JENNIE GIGLIO\n\nLocation: PEMBROKE PINES, FLORIDA\n\nComments: WORDS ARE SO DIFFICULT TO COME BY AT A TIME OF SUCH A GREAT LOSS IN YOUR FAMILY.

However, as a Marine Corps Drill Instructor I trained hundreds of fine young men who continue to defend, and have defended this country. Some solace can be found in the fact that your son was an honerable man. A man who did the right thing for the right reasons. As years pass I may not remember the name, but I will remember the tribute and the passing of a brother in arms, which has moved me to tears.

He's made from the same fabric, cut from the same bolt of cloth, woven from the same ball of yarn. Yes, then, I knew him, as did hundreds of thousands of other Marines and we too feel the pain and share your grief everyday as we read the newspaper and listen to the news about our brothers in arms.\n\nWe're a funny breed ... ferociously loyal to one another ... I trade tens of emails a day w/ past and present Marines ... and at the forefront of all our thoughts -- I hope we don't lose another Marine today ... or tomorrow ... or the day after.\n\nHis service was not in vain and I hope that you'll take some comfort in knowing this; first, he wasn't alone ... Marines are never alone and wherever two or more Marines gather, there is family; and, second, he will never be forgotten ... We go to extraordinary lengths to hand down our traditions from generation to generation of Marines ... of which, first and foremost, is always honoring those who have gone before, particularly those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.\n\nMy sincere condolences,\n\nJon Katz\n\nLtCol, USMC (Ret)\n\nName: BigMo Morrell\n\nLocation: Indianapolis, IN\n\nComments: An absolutely magnificient tribute to this marine hero.

They pay the price every day; some with their loneliness for family and loved ones, some with their injuries, and some (like Bobby Warns) making what we simply call \"the ultimate sacrifice.\"\n\nThey all deserve our praise, our thanks and our complete support.\n\nTo Bobby's family: My heart breaks for your loss. Yes, he was a Marine. But he was also a son, a friend to many, a lover and father to a child who will never see him. By sharing Bobby's loss with us in this manner, you have put a human face on this tragedy that is being repeated far too many times. It's the face of love, freedom, hope and the future. We should never have to bury any of that. But as life teaches us, sometimes there is no choice.\n\nWhen I lost a friend in a similar manner, I wrote a poem to put things into perspective. I'd like to share it with you in your time of loss. Thank you. God bless Bobby, his family and friends... and God Bless America.\n\nTo A Fallen Friend\n\nThe suddenness of your leaving\n\nthe grief, the loss, the pain\n\nThe shock is dissipating\n\nbut the sadness will remain.\n\nEach one of us uniquely\n\naffects the world in part\n\nsome do it with their actions\n\nand others with their heart.\n\nYou used both, my fallen friend\n\nand answered to the call\n\nyou showed us by example\n\nyou touched us one and all.\n\nIn thinking back about your life\n\nthis saying came to mind:\n\n\"A person's worth is measured by their\n\nwillingness to be kind.\"\n\nYour kindness is the view I'll have\n\nas time heals the loss I feel\n\nYour body is no longer here\n\nbut your presence still is real.\n\nFor in the end, your legacy\n\nwill stand the test of time.\n\nI'm proud to say in front of God,\n\n\"You were a friend of mine.\"\n\nGerry Ashley\n\nName: Mark Romano\n\nLocation: Fort Gibson, Oklahoma\n\nComments: To Bobby's Wife, Daughter, Mom and Dad:\n\nPlease accept my deepest regrets.\n\nWhat you have shown to the world is not only a tribute to Bobby, but to all Marines and others who currently serve and to those who have served in the past and to those who have given their lives to secure the freedoms Americans take so much for granted. Rest assured, Bobby knew what he enlisted for when he joined up. That is what makes him so special. I have never met Bobby, but I know who he is. You see, their is a kindred spirit (a brotherhood) between Marines that cannot be explained. Their is a pride in claiming the title of Marine that exceeds all other accomplishments the world has to offer. I mourn for Bobby as I myself am someone's Son, someone's Brother, someone's Husband, someone's Daddy, someone's friend.\n\nI showed the video to my wife Annette and three daughters Katie (10), Claire (8) and Madeline (2).\n\nI tell them never to forget what men like Bobby have done for this country in this war and wars from the past.\n\nIn your time of grief you can be as equally proud of Bobby.

Every soldier name and picture was on each dog tag, including Bobby Warns. I also dedicated some art work to honor every Fallen Hero that lost there life in Iraq. I am trying to get this art work to become a national Monument in Washington DC. I want to honor Bobbie and all the other men and women who lost there life over the war on terrorism.I hope this National Monument will do just that.Please go to my web site and look at my art work and the Christmas Tree.

I want you to know that your sons name was included on one of our Christmas letters so that we might keep your family in prayer over the holidays. We also lit a luminary for each fallen soldier on Christmas Eve. The light from the candle illuminated a golden seal with the name and hometown of every fallen soldier. We remember what Bobby Warns gave, and we remember the price his family is paying in sorrow. The cost for love, for country, for freedom, for hope is so high.

And I sent him a email today also. For My Grandmother died this Nov 30th and she and my grnadfather were both so very close to me. I cried for you, and your family. And his wifeand unborn daughter.\n\nYour son, your husband, did not die in vain. And we all shall be reunited again. All I can do is pray for the both of you and his wife and baby girl. And write to y ou. I have never been one to write to others. For my mouth is better with words then my fingers. May God continue to bless and keep you all. And may God help Ron through this mourning process also.\n\nUntil we meet my sincere graditude to your son and husband for his service to our country.\n\nSincerly,\n\nStephen David Moerschel R.N.\n\nName: Barry G.

Our family is a military family, I and my brothers and cousins all served in the USMC, presently we have five of our sons serving (in the US Army, sorry), and all have served at one time or another in Iraq. We have two nephews attending the USMA at West Point and another nephew being swarn into the Navy this coming Friday. All of us and our sons choose to serve (with or without our blessings), yet they do have our admiration and pride. Many years from now when all of us have been reunited with Cpl. Warns the only thing that will matter is WHO WERE WE, and how did we serve while on earth. Many will be ashamed to answer that question, or fumble for a reasonable response, but with all of the Cpl. Warns in the world, that question need not be asked! We will know who they were by where they are standing in heaven. Right next to God as one of the PROUD, THE CHOOSEN, THE FEW!!!!!!!!!! Until we all meet again in heaven I will now pray for all of you, and TO Cpl. Warns!\n\nWith Love, Gratitude, and Pride\n\nThe Manning Family\n\nSEMPER FI\n\nName: Cousin Kristen\n\nLocation: Crown Point, IN\n\nComments: Bobby,\n\nOne of my best memories of you is from years ago ('80 something I think) when we came to visit your new house. It snowed like crazy on the way up there and even after we got there. The next day you and I were the only two in the house that wanted to play in the snow so we went outside. We must have had fourty layers of clothes on and images of Randy from \"The Christmas Story\" come to mind. We threw snowballs, I think we made a snowman, snow angels, white washing took place too if I'm remembering correctly. It was so much fun. We came in soaking wet from the melting snow and tracked water all over your mom's clean floor. This year, loosing you was almost too much to deal with. When it started to snow the day before Thanksgiving I cried. Part of me wanted to think it was just a coincidence but now I know it was you're way of saying \"Hi, I'm still here\". So, I guess I just wanted to say Thank you and visit as often as you can.\n\nLove always,\n\nKristen\n\nName: Betty Higginbottom\n\nLocation: England\n\nComments: Bobby must have been a very special person for you to have created this site.

Warns, whom I didn't have the honor of knowing.\n\nI believe that one day, in large measure due to the enormous effort and sacrifice of people like Bobby, even in Iraq, in Afghanistan and eventually in other places where life has long been treated as though it's of so little significance, many more human beings, and many more as yet unborn, will be as universally cherished as he obviously is -- a person and a life of truly infinite significance and purpose.\n\nName: Lori Bakewell\n\nLocation: Warrenton, Virginia\n\nComments: Thank you. Thank you for raising a fine young man, who grew up to serve his country with honor and pride. His legacy lives on, in your hearts and in mine. May his memory forever bring a smile to turn back the sadness that fills you. He walks with God now. Someday you'll hold your boy...your Marine...close in your arms again. Until then, my heart...a mother's heart...aches with you. Blessed be.\n\nName: Terri Childress\n\nLocation: Ocala, Florida\n\nComments: That was a beautiful tribute. I am so sorry for your loss. I am praying for your family. Thank you so much for sharing this with us. I am so thankful for the sacrifice your son gave. It was great, and will never be forgotten. He is truly a great hero. My son leaves for Afganistan at the end of April, he has a little girl 1 1/2 years old. I pray we never have to go through what you all have gone through. I pray God will give you strength, and that his little girl will truly know what a great man and hero Bobby was.\n\nGod Bless you all.\n\nName: Jerry & Lori Voigt\n\nLocation: LAKE VILLAGE, INDIANA\n\nComments: Thank you for the sacrafice your son and your family has done for our country.

I am sure that he was doing the thing that he wanted to do-defending our country. Please be assured that we all appreciate his bravery and mourn his loss. Although I don't know him personally, I'm sure that he was a credit to his country, community and family, and he will be sorely missed.\n\nGOD BLESS!\n\nName: Pat Troup\n\nLocation: San Antonio, Texas\n\nComments: As a mother and a wife, I can imagine no grief greater than losing a child. I thank you and my family thanks you for raising such a fine young man, for becoming Marines alongside your son(I know you went through boot camp and all, right along with him!), and for sharing him with our country so that ultimately WE OF THE USA still have our freedoms. I believe his sacrifice and yours are for more than the people of Iraq...but as I said, so that my children can go to school without fear of terrorists, so that I don't have to hide to pray,so I can disagree with those in government without fear of death, so that what goes on in Iraq does not go on in San Antonio, Texas. Your son may or may not have joined the Marines with the plan of being a hero, but when he headed overseas to defend our freedoms, he became a hero.\n\nI pray that your memories become only more vivid, you see your son in your dreams often, and the pain softens. We know the void is never gone.\n\nMost sincerely and gratefully,\n\nPat Troup\n\n(mother of 5, including a sailor, who\n\nwere able to pray today thanks to\n\nyour son)\n\nName: Major John Matthews (USAR)\n\nLocation: Florida\n\nComments: My hearfelt condolences and prayers to your family and friends.
