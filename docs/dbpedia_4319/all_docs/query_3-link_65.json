        "text": "JoAnn Gloria Holton, 93 of Columbia Falls, passed away on June 14, 2024. She was born on Nov. 8, 1930, in Fort Worth, Texas, to Eppie and Bertha Garcia. She was the oldest of four children. The family eventually moved to Sacramento, California, where she went to school and met her husband, Ron Holton. Together they had three children Steve, Debby and Gary. In 1974 Ron, JoAnn and Gary packed up and moved to Columbia Falls where Ron and JoAnn would eventually divorce. JoAnn had always worked in the food industry, mostly in hospitals. At one point JoAnn decided to move back to Sacramento to live close to her siblings. She retired from Kaiser Permanente in Sacramento. She then moved back to Columbia Falls.\n\nJoAnn was an amazing cook. She would always cook up extra food & call her grandkids to come get it. If you stopped by to visit her, she would always try to give you food. You could always count on her to cook up something good to eat.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her father, Eppie; mother, Bertha; and brother, Gil.\n\nShe is survived by her sister, Janelle (Jerry) of Citrus Heights, California; sister, Christine of North Highlands, California; son, Steve (Debbie) of Ledger; daughter, Debby (Richard) of Westwood, California; son, Gary of Maine; six grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.\n\nThe family will hold a private celebration of life at a later date."
