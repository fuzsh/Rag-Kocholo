        "text": "David Fisher’s practical, forward-thinking counsel helps employers ensure their legal concerns don’t distract from their larger business goals. He advises agencies and companies of all sizes through every phase of the employment life cycle, focusing on state-by-state compliance, restrictive covenants, transactional due diligence, leave and accommodation policies, and compensation and benefits packages.\n\nWhether he’s providing proactive advice on day-to-day employment and employee concerns or responding to a claim, David outlines actionable steps employers can use to resolve the matter quickly. With his counsel and negotiation skills, clients often preempt the threat of litigation and reputational damage altogether. When litigation is necessary, David is involved in all aspects of a dispute, taking a lead role at trial to position clients for positive results.\n\nClients rely on David’s knowledge of legal requirements in jurisdictions throughout the United States when expanding their footprint, whether through acquisition or due a shift to remote work. He helps clients negotiate competitive compensation and benefits packages that align with organizational goals. David’s advice supports legally compliant responses to employee requests, concerns or complaints involving family and medical leave, disability, and remote work accommodations.\n\nDavid has gained particularly deep knowledge of restrictive covenant laws and practices across the United States. He draws on that experience to help employers spot weaknesses in their contracts. When called on to enforce or defend against an enforcement action, his ability to see around corners and anticipate an adversary’s next move helps clients gain the upper hand."
