        "text": "David Alexander FISHER (1838 - 1862) and Sarah Ann KELLER (1838 - 1923)\n\nmy gg-grandparents\n\nDavid Alexander FISHER was born about 1838 in Martin County, IN, the son of Jacob FISHER and Juliana Asia BOYD.\n\nSarah Ann KELLER was born on 26 Feb 1838 in Lincoln Twp, Lincoln County, NC, the daughter of Andrew Joseph KELLER and Phebe, last name unknown. The birth date and place appear in a declaration made by Sarah on 1 Jul 1919. [WCF] The names of Sarah's parents are Joseph and Phebe KELLER, from Sarah's deposition of 7 Nov 1921. [WCF] Another document from the Bureau of Pensions says \"Phebe and Andrew J. Keller, Jane 30, 1866, Jnt-aff., present soon after birth of Phebe A Fisher daut of David A Fisher and Sarah A Fisher on Dec 18, 1861.\"\n\nSo I conclude that Sarah's parents, Andrew Joseph KELLER and Phebe KELLER, were in Martin County, IN, where their granddaughter Phebe A. FISHER was born, soon after 18 Dec 1861. They (or at least Phebe) must also have been in Lincoln County, NC on 26 Feb 1838, when Sarah was born.\n\nSee the pages for Jacob FISHER and Andrew Joseph KELLER for more information about their families.\n\nDavid FISHER and Sarah Ann KELLER were married on 29 Jan 1857 in Martin County, Indiana. She was almost 19, and he was about the same age.\n\nDavid FISHER died in the Civil War, either 3 Oct 1862 or 18 Dec 1862, in Danville, KY. Sarah married 3 more times, and lived to age 85. Toward the end of her life, she was involved in a legal battle over David's pension. The extensive documentation of this case is a valuable resource, and it has caused me to rewrite this page. Thanks to Scott HUDDLESTON for sharing this with me. [WCF]\n\nThis David and Sarah's 1-year-old son was also born in Indiana, so they had recently moved to Missouri. This census says that David is illiterate. Incidentally, the family listed next in the census is the family of Salathiel HARRIS, a descendant of William Medcalf IV, and grandson of Joseph HARRIS and Elizabeth CRIBBS. Small world!\n\nMy cousin, who sent me the photo, said that family recollection says that the KELLERs were Pennsylvania Dutch. Sarah and her parents were born in North Carolina, and they seem to have been in Indiana since about 1848, although I have not been able to find them in census records.\n\nCivil War Records\n\nThe documents related to Sarah's pension claim [WCF] give overwhelming evidence that the David FISHER who was the father of Phebe Alice FISHER was a Private in Company K, 80th Volunteer Regiment, Indiana. Some of the records for this David FISHER are conflicting, on some details.\n\nDavid FISHER's biography [JBBC, p. 317] says that he \"served in Company F, 134th Indiana Infantry for 100 days in 1864 as a private and later in Company J, 147th Indiana Infantry as a private and as a corporal.\" However I think this is incorrect. Many David FISHERs were involved in the American Civil War, and it seems that some also had wives named Sarah A. FISHER.\n\nSources seem to agree that David FISHER enlisted on 13 Aug 1862, at Kecksville, which is a small village in Perry Township, Martin County, Indiana. (Kecksville was called Keck's Church when it was founded in 1849, and became Kecksville in 1852, and changed again in 1890 to its present name, Burns City. It was often referred to as Keck's Church, even after 1852.) David entered service on 3 Sep 1862, in Indianapolis, for a three-year term with the 80th Regiment.\n\nPhefy is undoubtedly Pheby, or Phebe Alice FISHER. Richland County is in southeastern Illinois. Joseph and Susan A FISHER are married, but not within the past year, as there is a column for that statistic, which is not marked.\n\nIn late 1880 or early 1881, the MITCHELL/FISHER family moved again, this time some 350 miles southwest, to northern Arkansas. They seem to have settled, eventually with their own families, in Marion and adjacent counties. On 26 Nov 1886, Lillie MITCHELL married Samuel J. REED in Baxter County, AR, and after that, all records for this family were in Arkansas, except for the birth of Mary, daughter of Joseph FISHER, born in Oct 1888, somewhere in Missouri.\n\nThe move would have involved the following family members, with their approximate ages around 1881:\n\nThomas MITCHELL (61-66) and Sarah Anne (KELLER) (FISHER) MITCHELL (43), Joseph W. FISHER (22) and his wife Susanna (BERLIN) FISHER (21), Phebe Alice FISHER (20), Lillie MITCHELL (12), Carrie MITCHELL (10)\n\nIt would seem that Joseph W. FISHER and his family might have stayed behind, since the 1900 Census says that their daughter Nella M. FISHER was born in Nov 1884, in IL. However, in his deposition, Joseph says \"Then we all moved to Manila, Ark., called then Daugherty’s Gin, also Big Lake Island. I lived there until my said step father died.\"\n\nDeath of Thomas MITCHELL - 1881\n\nThomas MITCHELL died in 1879, in \"Darotg Gin, Arkansas,\" according to a declaration made by Sarah on 1 Jul 1919. [WCF] However, in another declaration made on 20 Nov 1916 [WCF] Sarah says he died in Nov 1878, in \"Missippia [Mississippi] Co, Arkansas.\" These dates must both be wrong, because Thomas appeared in the 1880 US Census (above), taken 15 Jun 1880, in Claremont, Richland, IL.\n\nIn a deposition taken on 7 Apr 1920, L. E. BOLLINGER, an acquaintance, stated that “… Thomas Mitchell died in Fall 1881 and in Spring 1882 the Mitchell family moved away from Manila which was then known as Big Lake …” [WCF]\n\nManila is a small village in Mississippi County, AR, about 50 miles north of Memphis, TN.\n\nA deposition given by Joseph W. FISHER, son of Sarah and David FISHER, on 7 Nov 1921, says: \"Then we all moved to Manila, Ark., called then Daugherty’s Gin, also Big Lake Island. I lived there until my said step father died. I saw the corpse of the said Thomas Mitchell and saw it buried. He died in the fall of the year and I think the year was 1881. He died just before the big overflow of the Mississippi River which began in Jan 1882. Mitchell was buried in the edge of the town which is now Manila, Ark.\" [WCF]\n\nDaugherty's Gin must be the Darotg Gin referred to by Sarah. I have not seen other references to this name for Manila, AR. A nearby feature known as Big Lake Island was formed by the New Madrid earthquake of 1812.\n\nMy conclusion is that Thomas MITCHELL died in the fall of 1881, in Manila, Mississippi County, AR.\n\nSarah after Thomas\n\nAfter the death of her second husband, Thomas MITCHELL, Sarah and her children moved several times, in Arkansas, Missouri and Michigan. Sarah married her 3rd and 4th husband, and stayed with each only a few months. These two marriages turned out to be very costly, because they caused her pension claim to be investigated and ultimately rejected.\n\nAround 1882, Sarah and some of her children moved from Manila to Baxter County, AR. They lived first in Gassville, and later in Mountain Home, where Sarah ran a photo gallery. [WCF] I have not found any advertisements or photos taken by Sarah during this period. Gassville and Mountain Home are both in the present township of Whiteville, Baxter County, AR.\n\nSarah's first grandchild, Nella/Nellie M. FISHER, daughter of Joseph W. FISHER (see below), was born in Nov 1884, according to the 1900 US Census. The birth was probably in Baxter County, AR. (As mentioned elsewhere, the census also says she was born in IL, but that must be a mistake. This the only source I have for Nella's birthdate, so it may also be a mistake.)\n\nSarah's daughter Mary Lillian \"Lillie\" MITCHELL married Samuel REED on 28 Nov 1886, in Gassville. Lillie gave birth to Sarah's 2nd grandchild, Grace REED, on 10 Dec 1887, in Marion County. Sarah had 12 more grandchildren from 1888 to 1906, most in Marion or Baxter County.\n\nSarah (KELLER)(FISHER)MITCHELL married on 19 Nov 1889, in Baxter County, AR, to James WESTMORELAND of Powell (now Pyatt), Marion County, AR. James was 43 and Sarah was 50, according to the marriage bond. [WCF] (Sarah was actually 51.) They lived together until 1 Feb 1890, less than 3 months.\n\nJames WESTMORELAND was a Civil War veteran, on the Union side, having served as a Private in Company I, 12th Regiment, Missouri Cavalry. He was born 9 Sep 1845, and died 29 Mar 1920. His gravestone is in the Carrollton Cemetery, Carrollton, Carroll County, AR.\n\nJames filed for divorce on 10 Aug 1891, on the grounds of desertion. From his deposition: \"I had rented a farm from R. E. Hurst and Walter Talbert on Buffalo Fork, Marion County and had moved part of my plunder and hers to White River part of the way to ware(?) house and returned after her and she refused to go with me and said she had heard me say I was going to Indian Territory and she would never move there and take her children and that had as well separate now as anytime. I stated I had not started yet and did not know if I would ever go, but if I got ahead right I was sure to go and she still refuses to go and live with me.\" The divorce was granted on 2 Sep 1891. [WCF]\n\nSarah's stepson, James WESTMORELAND Jr, was involved in coal mining, and killed another man in Marion County. This happened after Sarah and James Sr had separated, but before the divorce.\n\nJames WESTMORELAND was granted 80 acres of land in Carroll County, on 11 Oct 1909, under the Homestead Act.\n\nIn her deposition supporting her mother's pension claim, Carrie B. (MITCHELL) HOGAN states that \"Mother did not live at Manila long after father died. She with her three children, Alice Fisher, my full sister Lillie and I moved to Baxter County, Ark, and lived at Gassville, Mountain Home, said county and Yellville, Marion County, Ark., at Gassville the longest.\" [WCF] She does not mention the marriage to James WESTMORELAND.\n\nA deposition by Henry C. BROWNING, a \"real estate man,\" states that \"I remember the claimant Sarah A. Mitchell, and knew her many years ago, and the first time I remember seeing her, she was living in Mountain Home, and was running a picture gallery. That must have been along about 1895, and she lived there some time, but how long, I don’t remember. She was known as Mrs. Mitchell all the time I knew her, but I never knew of her husband, and don’t know what became of him.... Later Mrs Mitchell moved to Marion County and homesteaded a tract of land … near what is now Cotter.\" [WCF] The date of 1895 must be wrong, because Sarah was homesteading the land in Marion County from 1890 to 1897. So Sarah also ran a photo gallery in Mountain Home, at some point. It is also noted that Sarah was still known as Mrs. MITCHELL, not WESTMORELAND.\n\nThe timeline given above is helpful, but needs some adjustment, based on the headings and postmarks on documents in [WCF]. In particular, Sarah and her children were in Mountain Home in the mid 1880s, not 1895.\n\nSarah opened a photo gallery.\n\nSarah (FISHER)(MITCHELL)(WESTMORELAND)HALFORD applied for David FISHER's pension after A. M. HALFORD's death, and spent the next 10 years trying to prove her claim. According to law, she was not eligible for the pension if she was married. The collection [WCF] contains extensive documentation of this process, and also provide a treasure for genealogists. Thanks to Scott HUDDLESTON for this.\n\nA form from the Committee on Pensions, US Senate, dated 16 Jul 1912, and another dated 7 Jun 1913, bear witness to Sarah's renewed efforts to obtain David FISHER's pension.\n\nOn 8 Sep 1916, an Act of Congress increased the pension for widows over 70, from $12 to $20 per month. It also provided that widows of Civil War veterans who were dropped because of remarriage were restored to the rolls.\n\nSarah lost little time in applying under these new terms. On 20 Nov 1916 she made a sworn declaration to a notary public, stating the facts about her husband, David A. FISHER. She said her address was Blue Lick, MO, and she was born on 26 Feb 1838 in North Carolina. She gave the dates and places of her marriages to David FISHER and Thomas MITCHELL. She stated that Thomas MITCHELL died in Nov 1878 in \"Missippia\" County, AR. We know from other sources (above) that he died in 1881. One of the witnesses was her daughter, Carrie HOGAN, of Blue Lick, MO. The form was stamped by the Pension Office on 26 Mar 1917.\n\nNotably, Sarah neglected to mention her 2 other marriages. She may have thought that these were irrelevant. As it turned out, they caused no end of trouble.\n\nI don't know why Sarah and her daughter Carrie went to Blue Lick, MO. I have not found Carrie or Joseph in the 1920 US Census. However, there is one tantalizing clue. The 1876 Atlas of Saline County [SM] does not show Blue Lick, as it didn't exist yet. However, it would be in Sections 21 and 22 of Township 49 North, Range 21 W, 5th P.M. This map shows about 1243 acres - almost 2 square miles, including most of the future site of Blue Lick - owned by Jacob FISHER Est. That would seem to indicate that the owner, Jacob FISHER, had died shortly before 1876. This Jacob FISHER could not be the father of David, husband of Sarah, because we know enough about that Jacob to be sure that he lived in Martin County, IN, and didn't have any large estate in MO. Of course, FISHER is a common name, and it could easily be a coincidence. But there must be some connection between Sarah and Blue Lick. It could be that Jacob FISHER of Saline County, MO, who died around 1875, was the grandfather or grand uncle of David A. FISHER.\n\nLetter from Bureau of Pensions, 20 Mar 1918\n\nCivil War Division, WLP\n\nWid. Cert. 3,075,\n\nSarah A. Mitchell,\n\nformerly widow of\n\nDavid A. Fisher,\n\nK, 80 Ind.

D. 1, Box 81.\n\nMadam:\n\nIn reply to a letter addressed by you to the Honorable William Gibbs McAdoo, Secretary of the Treasury, and which has been referred to this Bureau, you are advised that your above entitled claim for pension requires a certified copy of the public record, or the testimony of the attending physician, or that of two witnesses who were present showing the date of death of your late husband, Thomas Mitchell; and also your affidavit showing the name of the organization in which he served during the Civil War, or, if service was rendered by him in the navy, the name of the vessel on which service was rendered should be shown, and if a claim for pension has ever been filed on account of such service, the number thereof should be furnished.\n\nSaid claim also requires the testimony of credible persons, having knowledge of the facts, showing whether you have been married since the soldier’s death other than to said Mitchell, and, if so, how such marriage terminated.\n\nSaid claim further requires the testimony of credible persons having knowledge of the facts showing whether you and your late husband, Mitchell, were ever divorced, and whether you lived together as husband and wife from the date of your marriage to the date of his death.\n\nThe evidence herein indicated was called for in a communication addressed to you by this Bureau under date of July 2, 1917, to which no reply has been received, and until said evidence shall have been furnished, your said complaint cannot be further considered.\n\nNo affidavit is considered satisfactory that fails to state the age and post office address of the witness and how he knows the facts stated.\n\nDo not fail to inscribe upon each piece of evidence filed the soldier’s name, his service, and the number of this claim.\n\nVery Respectfully,\n\nE. C. TIEMAN\n\nActing Commissioner.\n\n214 Bostwick Ave, Grand Rapids, MI is no longer in a residential area. It's a few blocks east of the Grand River, and less than a mile north of downtown, across the street from the Grand Rapids Community College, established in 1914. The site of 214 appears to be occupied by the Gerald R. Ford Fieldhouse, first used in 1976.\n\nThe new declaration was notarized on 1 Jul 1919, and the witnesses were A. C. HUNTLEY, at 937 Sherman St, and Edward L. WAGNER, at 629 Innes Dr. This declaration contains mostly the same information as the previous declaration, except that Sarah gives her birthplace more precisely, as Lincoln Township, Lincoln County, NC. She also says she married Thomas MITCHELL at Overhill, Martin County, IN. This can only be Dover Hill. Once again, Sarah neglected to mention her two other marriages.\n\nThe home of Adelbert and Phebe (FISHER) HUNTLEY in 1919, at 937 Sherman St is 1.5 miles southeast of 214 Bostwick Ave. There is an old house at 937, but it doesn't look 100 years old.\n\nIt is curious that Rep. MAPES had requested that the Bureau send Sarah an explanation of the information that was needed, since it had done so in the letter of 20 Mar 1918. It may be that Sarah never received this letter, or that Rep. MAPES never saw it. At any rate, the Commissioner responded by sending Sarah another letter, dated 25 Jul 1919, explaining this.\n\nThe 1920 US Census, taken 9 Jan 1920, has Sarah in Grand Rapids, Kent, MI, living with her daughter Phebe Alice (FISHER) HUNTLEY and family. Their street address was 937 Sherman. Lillie and her family were still at White River Township, Marion County, AR. I have not found Joseph or Carrie in the 1920 Census.\n\nInternal documents at the Board of Pensions indicate that Sarah's application was rejected on 26 Apr 1920, but the rejection was cancelled after an Act of Congress on 1 May 1920 changed the rules, saying that \"more than one marriage is no bar to pension.\"\n\nA letter to Sarah from the Commissioner, dated 12 May 1920, requests information about Sarah's marriage after the death of Thomas MITCHELL, and proof of the death or divorce of the husband. I don't know when she admitted to this, but it was not in her declaration of 1 Jul 1919.\n\n30 Jul 1921 Affidavit of Sarah Mitchell\n\nState of Missouri)\n\nCounty of Butler) SS:\n\nW. C. No. 3075\n\nSarah A. Mitchell\n\nDavid A. Fisher\n\nK 70 Ind. Inf.\n\nSarah A. Mitchell, being first duly sworn, on her oath says, that after the death of her husband, Thomas Mitchell, she married Marion Halford at Booneville, Arkansas, and only lived with said Marion Halford about three months, because they could not get along together. That said Marion Halford lived at Booneville, Arkansas, until his death, which affiant heard occurred about four years ago. That affiant never applied for a divorce, and that said Marion Halford never applied for any divorce so far as affiant knows, and that she was never served with any papers in any suit. That said Marion Halford never served in the Army or Navy of the United States.\n\nAffiant says that she lived with Thomas Mitchell until his death, and that there was never any trouble between them. That she was never married to any other persons except said Thomas Mitchell and said Marion Halford, since the death of her first husband, David A. Fisher. That she has never lived with any other men except these and as herein sworn to. Affiant says that after separating from Marion Halford, about twelve years ago, after living with him only about three months, she moved from Boonville, Arkansas, to Van Buren, Arkansas, where she lived over one year. From there, affiant moved to Blue Lick, Missouri, where she lived about three years. From Blue Lick, Missouri, affiant moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where she lived one year, and from thence to Arbyrd, Missouri, where she lived about six months, and from Arbyrd, affiant moved to Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Affiant says that she lived with her daughter, Mrs. Carrie Hogan, about three years, on a farm near Booneville, Arkansas, after she separated from Marion Halford, before moving to Van Buren, Arkansas.\n\nAffiant says that no member of her family served in the Word War, beginning April 6th, 1917.\n\nAffiant says that her present address is Poplar Bluff, Missouri, Route 2, Box 137.\n\n(signature of Sarah A.

Halford No. 3075\n\nOn this 7 day of November, 19 21, at Poplar Bluff county of Butler , state of Missouri before me, C. W. Walker, a Special Examiner of the Bureau of Pensions, personally appeared Carrie B. Hogan , who, being by me first duly sworn to answer truly all interrogatories propounded to her during this special examination of aforesaid claim for pension, deposes and says:\n\nI am 50 years of age; occupation housekeeper, I am a widow; residence and post-office address Poplar Bluff, Mo. RR2.\n\nSarah A. Halford, this claimant for pension, is my mother.\n\nAccording to what I have heard and been taught my said mother has been married three times. Her first husband was David Fisher, her second, Thomas Mitchell, who was my father. When I can first remember my parents and myself were living together in Richland County, Ill. My parents and myself moved from Richland County, Ill. To Manila, Ark. My father died at Manila, Ark. about forty years ago. I was about ten years of age when he died. I saw his corpse and attended his funeral. Mother did not live at Manila long after father died. She with her three children, Alice Fisher, my full sister Lillie and I moved to Baxter County and lived at Gassville, Mountain Home, said County and Yellville, Marion County, Ark., at Gassville the longest. My said sister, who is now the wife of Sam Reed, lives near Flippin, Ark. My half sister, Alice, wife of A. C. Huntley, lives at 806 Emerald Avenue, Grand Rapids, Mich. Mother, my husband and myself all moved to Booneville, Logan County, Ark. Mother has been with me ever since the death of my father. I was with her until I established a home and then she moved with me. She was with me at Van Buren, Ark. About a year and at Blue Lick, Mo. About three years and Grand Rapids, Mich. About a year and down in this country about a year.\n\nAt Booneville, Ark. My mother was married to one Marion A. Halford. This was about thirteen years ago. She lived with him only a few months and they separated, did not agree. Mr. Halford remained at Booneville until his death, which occurred about four years ago. Mr. Halford had children there, one son and two daughters, whose names I do not remember. My brother-in-law, A. C. Huntley, wrote to Booneville, Ark. to ascertain whether Halford was living. Learning that he had died, I wrote to Charles X. Williams at Booneville, who knows mother and me, to secure evidence showing the death of Halford, and he did so.\n\nMy said father and mother lived together continuously, without separation or divorce, from the date of their marriage to his death. After the death of my father my mother was not married but the one time, this marriage being to Halford. I am positive of this.\n\nI was on Ed Mary’s farm, near Blue Lick, Mo.\n\nI know positively that my mother did not get a divorce from Halford and I don’t think he got one from her.\n\nI have no financial interest in this claim.\n\nI have heard the deposition read.

Lane, a Special Examiner of the Bureau of Pensions, personally appeared Carrie B. Hogan , who, being by me first duly sworn to answer truly all interrogatories propounded to her during this special examination of aforesaid claim for pension, deposes and says:\n\nI am the daughter of the claimant, Sarah A. Halford, and am speaking for her in this deposition.\n\nMother has always been called and known as Sarah Ann Mitchell since she separated from Marion Halford.\n\nNo member of mother’s immediate family served the United States in the World War. No member of my family was in said war and mother was with me all the time. I know that mother never applied for or received compensation through the War Risk Insurance Bureau at Washington, D. C. on account of the service of any one in the Army, Navy or Marine Corps, or in the Army or Navy Nurse Corps of the United States during the World War.\n\nThe said Marion Halford served in the Confederate Army, I understand, but not in the Federal Army.\n\nMother has no attorney in her pension claim except that some man in Poplar Bluff has been doing her writing. This man said the matter had been turned over the government officials. He has not demanded any particular sum for his service but said we could pay him if we got the pension. We have not paid a thing to any one for services in this claim. We have promised nothing to any one except as above indicated.\n\nI have no witnesses away from here I wish examined and I have no more testimony to introduce before you.\n\nI have no complaint to make as to the conduct, manner or fairness of the examination of mother’s claim for pension.\n\nI have heard the foregoing deposition read and it is correct.\n\n(signature of Carrie Hogan)\n\nDeponent.\n\nSubscribed and sworn before me on this 8 day of November 1921, and I certify that the contents were fully made known to the deponent before signing.\n\n(signature of C.

Halford No. 3075\n\nOn this 7 day of November, 19 21, at Poplar Bluff county of Butler , state of Missouri before me, C. M. Lane, a Special Examiner of the Bureau of Pensions, personally appeared Joseph W. Fisher , who, being by me first duly sworn to answer truly all interrogatories propounded to her during this special examination of aforesaid claim for pension, deposes and says:\n\nI am 63 years of age, am a laborer and Minister of the Gospel, Poplar Bluff, Mo., Rt. 2.\n\nSarah Ann Halford, this claimant for pension, is my mother. According to what I have known and what I have heard, my mother has been married three times only. Her first husband, so I have been taught, was David A. Fisher who was my father. I do not remember him. He was a member of Co. K 80 Ind. Inf. And died while he was serving in said organization.\n\nMother’s second husband was Thomas Mitchell. Said Mitchell was not a soldier; he was ruptured and was not physically able to serve as a soldier. I cannot remember Mitchell’s coming to see mother but recall our moving from some point in Indiana to Martin Co., Ind. I was with mother and the said Thomas Mitchell on this trip and lived with them until I was married which was when I lacked a month of being 21 years old.\n\nFrom the time I was married until Mitchell died I lived most of the time close to mother and my said step-father. Logotee was our P. O. in Martin Co., Ind. When I was about 12 years old all of us moved to Richland Co., Ill., P.O. Sumner, Lawrence Co., Ill. John Beard; Wallace Beard, Harry Beard, sons of John; Ike Mowry and his son George; John McVeely and his sons whose christian names I do not remember and Pat McVeeley and his sons whose given names do not come to me, were our neighbors there in Ill. My step father had a farm there about three miles west of Sumner.\n\nThen we all moved to Manila, Ark., called then Daugherty’s Gin, also Big Lake Island. I lived there until my said step father died.\n\nI saw the corpse of the said Thomas Mitchell and saw it buried. He died in the fall of the year and I think the year was 1881. He died just before the big overflow of the Mississippi River which began in Jan 1882. Mitchell was buried in the edge of the town which is now Manila, Ark.\n\nMother and the said Thomas Mitchell lived together continuously as husband and wife from my earliest recollection until he died. They had no domestic trouble and got along well together. They were never divorced from each other. I went down in that country and secured the affidavits of L. E. Bollinger and John U. Needham, showing the death of Mitchell. I did not know these men in Mitchell’s life time. I lived about 12 miles from my step father when we were all down there. The man who was post master when I was down there after the testimony referred to, told me that he had seen my step father, Mitchell.\n\nI know mother was married one time after the death of the said Mitchell from hearsay. I cannot remember the name exactly but his name was Alford or Halford or something like that. That was at Booneville, Ark. I was at mother’s there once but she and this man had separated. I understood that he was there in the community somewhere. I do not think mother divorceed this man Alford or Halford; am satisfied that she did not. I never heard that this man Alford or Halford secured or applied for a divorce from mother. I never saw this man.\n\nI have no financial interest in this claim.\n\nI have heard the foregoing deposition read and it is correct.\n\n(signature of J. W. Fisher)\n\nDeponent.\n\nSubscribed and sworn before me on this 7 day of November 1921, and I certify that the contents were fully made known to the deponent before signing.\n\n(signature of C. M.

K 80 Ind. Inf.\n\nAddress:\n\nPoplar Bluff, Butler Co., Mo., Rt. 2.\n\nSt. Louis, Mo., Nov 23, 1921.\n\nThe Commissioner of Pensions:\n\nSir:\n\nAll papers in the above-entitled claim for pension are returned with report.\n\nCase was returned to the field to determine whether the claimant lived with her second husband, Thomas Mitchell, continuously without divorce or separation from the time she was married to him until he died; to secure record evidence of claimant’s marriage to Marion Halford, the date of his death and whether the claimant contracted any marriage after soldier’s death other than with Mitchell and Halford.\n\nPapers came to me for the initial investigation. Proper notice was given the claimant and her rights and privileges were fully explained to her. She waived the right to further notice. Of course she knows little about this, she could not understand it but her daughter and son were fully advised of the rights and both said notice of further examination is waived.\n\nClaimant is sick in bed, is very feeble and cannot keep her mind on one subject more than a second. She is not demented and says things in a sensible way but she goes from one subject to another. She could not be made to comprehend why I was at her home but she knows she has a pension claim on foot. She was right up in arms when we said she could not sign her name and sat up in bed and made a determined effort to sign but failed. She seems to have quite a bit of vitality yet but her son and daughter are very poor and the old lady does not have the proper food, medicine and nursing. The all live in the same house and have plenty of room. I do not think claimant will need a guardian.\n\nIt will be observed that the claimant gave the company and regiment in which her husband served. She did that but I mentioned several letters and she at once picked out “K” but one second later she could not have told that. I gave several numbers including 80 and she without hesitation said “80” but a second later I asked her what the number was and she could not give it.\n\nThe daughter, Mrs. Hogan, told me that up to a year ago her mother was in fairly good condition for a woman of that age and that her mother herself wrote the letters (BJ 3 & 4) and that her mother did not intend to convey the idea that the man Halford disappeared or went away from the community but that he went about the neighborhood and paid little attention to the claimant, that Halford was older than her mother and that the two should not have married.\n\nThey said that Halford had a little property. He may have divorced the claimant.\n\nTheir neighbors in Butler Co., Mo. Speak well of claimant and her daughter and son. They have not been in said county very long however.\n\nIn view of the testimony of the claimant’s son and daughter and the fact that Halford may have divorced claimant, I did not go to Manila, Mississippi Co., Ark. To see L. K. Bowman (bj 7) and John U. Needham (bj 8). Perhaps further testimony regarding Thomas Mitchell will not be considered necessary. The son of claimant said that Mitchell did not live very long after he moved from Ark. From Ill.\n\nFurther examination is recommended as follows:\n\nCopy of record at Boonesville, Logan Co., Ark. Should be secured showing the marriage of claimant to Marion Halford which marriage took place about 13 years ago. It would be well to search the divorce records at Booneville, Ark. To ascertain whether Halford divorced the claimant. If no divorce record should be found there a search might be made of the records at Paris, Logan Co., Ark., the other county seat of said county. Fact and date of death of Halford can be established there at Booneville. Mrs. Hogan states that Halford had a son there and two daughters whose names she does not remember and that Halford was an old resident of that section. She names Charles X. Williams (banker of Booneville) as a man who knew her and her mother. No doubt he can give any data needed. B. G. and Charley Griffey (bj 9) seem to know of Halford’s death.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(signature of C. M. Lane)\n\nSpecial Examiner.\n\nP. S.\n\nIt may be necessary to have more evidence showing whether the claimant married after Fisher’s death and before she was married to Halford. If so, the testimony of her daughter Lillie Reed, and latter’s husband, Sam Reed, and the persons named by Carrie Hogan in Questionnaire (P. , this report) as having known claimant at Gassville, Mountain Home, Yellville and Booneville, Ark. And claimant’s daughter, Alice Huntley and latter’s husband, A. C. Huntley (he was a Civil War soldier), 806 Emerald Ave., Grand Rapids, Kent Co., Mich. can be obtained.\n\n28 Jan 1922 Report of Special Examiner\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\nBUREAU OF PENSIONS\n\nWASHINGTON, D.

M. Halford in Logan County, Ark., September 27, 1908, and that they only lived together a short time, when they separated.\n\nHalford died near Booneville, Arkansas June 30, 1915.\n\nTestimony shows that the claimant and Halford were not divorced, and that she was not married to any one other than the three men, Fisher, Mitchell and Halford.\n\nOn account of having been transferred from the territory, I did not personally interview witnesses in Marion and Baxter Counties, and did not personally examine the public records of marriages and divorces in those Counties.\n\nI received replies from the Clerk of the Marion County Court, but that from the Baxter County Clerk has not been received, although I have written him two circular letters. He has had abundance of time to reply, and I am not holding the case longer.\n\nTestimony of Mr and Mrs Henry C. Browning, now of Webb City, indicate that the claimant was not married in Baxter County, Arkansas, but was known as Mrs Mitchell all the time she was there.\n\nI sent a circular letter to claimant’s daughter Mrs. Lillie Reed of Flippin, Arkansas, and she answers that her mother was only married three times.\n\nAll deponents are of splendid reputation.\n\nI will recommend that the claim be referred to the Chief of the Review Division for his Consideration.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(signature of Chas A Hughes)\n\nSpecial Examiner.\n\nAddenda.\n\nJust as I was wrapping up this claim to send to the Bureau, I received the letter from H.

Mitchell was married to James Westmoreland, November 19, 1889, and evidently that is the claimant, and if so, it shows that she has been married four times, and nothing shown as to what became of Westmoreland.\n\nI’m leaving my report just as formerly written, just to show how easily we can be mistaken in a hasty “diagnisis” (sic) of a case.\n\nIts (sic) on me–I admit it.\n\nInasmuch as I have been transferred from the territory embracing Baxter County, Arkansas, I will not be able to complete the case in that State.\n\nIn view of the above information, I will recommend that the claim be further examined as follows: -\n\nLegal widowhood: -\n\nObtain certified copy of marriage of Sarah A. Mitchell to James Westmoreland, November 19, 1889.\n\nInterview, claimant’s daughter, Lillie Reed and her husband, Samuel J. Reed, Flippin, Marion County Arkansas. (See letter of Lillie Reed in this report)\n\nClaimant’s daughter, Mrs. Alice Huntley, and husband, A. C. Huntley, 806 Emerald Avenue, Grand Rapids, Kent Co. Mich.\n\nWhen the papers are ar Mountain Home, Ark., see A. A. Wolf, mentioned in letter of Carrie B. Hogan, report No. 1, exhibit B, page 11. J. A. Carter is dead, but Mr. Wolf may be able to refer to others.\n\nExamination in Baxter County, Ark. may be sufficient to complete the claim, although the claimant may have to be interviewed.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(signature of Chas A Hughes)\n\nSpecial Examiner.\n\n31 Mar 1922 Report of the Special Examiner\n\nJOPLIN, MISSOURI, March 31, 1922.\n\nTHE COMMISSIONER OF PENSIONS:\n\nSUBJECT: 3075 Sarah A. Halford as widow of David A. Fisher, Co. K 80th Indiana Infantry; all papers herewith.\n\nREFERENCE: To ascertain whether claimant and Thomas Mitchell cohabited without divorce; whether she was divorced from Halford, and whether she contracted any marriage after death of soldier except to Mitchell and Halford.\n\nTo this district to obtain record evidence of the marriage of Sarah A. Mitchell to James Westmoreland and to ascertain how and when that marriage terminated.\n\nEVIDENCE: In this report will be found a copy of the public record of the marriage of James Westmoreland to one Sarah A. Mitchell, certified to by the custodian of the records.\n\nThere is also to be found in this report a properly certified copy of the decree of divorce between the parties named in the marriage records.\n\nIt is also shown that the wife was at fault and that the husband was granted the decree.\n\nIDENTITY. Before it could be ascertained that there was a divorce in this case, your special examiner made diligent inquiry at Mountain Home and some inquiry at Gassville. The persons personally interviewed were, Mr. Eaton, long time County Clerk, A. A. Wolf, old time merchant, Mrs. Pattillo, old time postmaster, Zeph Horton, old attorney and resident of Mountain Home, and J. W. Barnett, old time resident of Gassville.\n\nNone of these people could at first recall James Westmoreland but they recalled claimant because she was conspicuous on account of running a photo gallery and on account of being a large fleshy woman. Each witness knew by general understanding that Mrs. Mitchell had married a man named Westmoreland and that he was a very tall man. Further than that they seemed to recall very little about the affair. It was their understanding that Mrs. Mitchell separated from Westmoreland but they could not recall just where they resided, whether in Gassville, Mountain Home or in Marion County, near Gassville. Mrs. Mitchell was said to have one time owned a farm in Marion County.\n\nZeph Horton, attorney, recalled defending a young man named Jim Westmoreland in a murder case. That this Jim killed a man over a mine and that he, Horton, now owned half of that mine which he obtained as counsel fee. Horton said this Jim Westmoreland was a son of the Westmoreland that married old lady Mitchell. Horton, nor any other person had the least idea as to what became of the James Westmoreland in question after he and Mrs. Mitchell parted.\n\nNo witness seemed to have any personal knowledge of the marriage anymore than just like everyone in a small community hears that certain persons have married. None seems to be able even to testify to cohabitation.\n\nTherefore it was not thought necessary to take any testimony as there can be no doubt whatever as to the identity of claimant as the S. A. Mitchell and S. A. Westmoreland named in the records of marriage and divorce.\n\nZeph Horton recalled defending young Jim Westmoreland in the murder trial, but said he did not recall anything about whether the elder James was divorced from Mrs. Mitchell. It appears that this Horton was the attorney in the divorce proceedings. As there was no trial and no contest, undoubtedly Horton did not recall the incident. He was interviewed before the record was obtained from the adjoining county.\n\nREMARKS: Carrie Hogan (Deps. B & C report 1) undoubtedly knows of her mother marrying James Westmoreland, altho inquiry did not disclose for a certainty whether Mrs. Hogan was on the ground at the time. She is described as a red headed girl, decidedly ignorant and illiterate when she married Hogan. Mrs. Lillie Reed, the other daughter, was half grown at the time and she evidently knows of the marriage in question. It is to be benoted that Westmoreland later married a Reid girl.\n\nA determined effort was made to interview Mrs. Reed and her husband, Sam J. Reed, but the White River is at flood stage and could not be ferried. The roads from other directions have been axle deep to autos for a week. No teams or horses available and I was unable to get a car to attempt to drive from Yellville to the home of the Reeds.\n\nSCOPE OF EXAMINATION not extended for reasons above stated and because it seems that the case is ready for final action.\n\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,\n\nT. Quinn Jones (signature)\n\nSPECIAL EXAMINER.\n\nLetters were sent by the Commissioner to Sarah and to Rep. HAYS, both dated 18 Apr 1922, stating that the pension claim was denied, although Sarah was divorced from James WESTMORELAND, because the divorce was \"not without fault on her part.\" Ironically, James WESTMORELAND had died on 29 Mar 1920, in Carroll County, AR, but neither Sarah nor the Special Examiners were aware of it.\n\nSarah's gravestone is in Woodlawn Cemetery, Poplar Bluff, in southeast MO. It has birth date 26 Feb 1835 (not 1838), and death 2 Nov 1923, age 88. The stone doesn't have a first name that is visible in the image, but the poster on Findagrave has it as Sarah. Her son-in-law, Adelbert Calvin HUNTLEY, died on 9 Mar 1923, and his gravestone is also in Woodlawn Cemetery. Also, Adelbert and Phebe had their 5th child in Poplar Bluff, in 1924.

She had 2 children with her 1st husband, David FISHER, and 2 more with her 2nd husband, Thomas MITCHELL.\n\n1. Joseph W. FISHER was born in Jan 1859 in Indiana, the son of Sarah Anne KELLER and David FISHER. Joseph married Susanna BERLIN on 11 Nov 1879 in Richland County, IL. Susanna BERLIN was about 2 years younger than Joseph. She was a daughter of Andrew BERLIN and Hanna LAUSTER.\n\nIn 1910 Joseph and Susanna appear in Jackson County, Arkansas. They had been married 30 years, and Susanna had 5 children, all still living. So far we know the names of 4. They have a rented house. I don't know what it means that Joseph is a Doctor in the Faith industry.\n\nAlso living with them is a black couple, George and Fannie WASHINGTON. I think they are in the same household, because the WASHINGTONs don't have a family number, and the family after them is 66. George is the owner of the house, so apparently the FISHERs are renting from the WASHINGTONs. George and Fannie had been married 35 years. Fannie had 2 children, but none were still living in 1910.\n\nI have not had much luck tracing this family after 1910, except that Joseph was living in Poplar Bluff, Butler, MO on 7 Nov 1921 when he made his deposition in the case of his mother's pension application. At age 62, he was a \"laborer and Minister of the Gospel.\" [WCF]\n\nThere was a Nellie M. FISHER who married Frank D. MILLER on 23 Dec 1905. However, the marriage took place in Jackson County, MO (the county that includes Kansas City), not Jackson County, AR. If the 1900 US Census is correct, Nella/Nellie was born in Nov 1884, so she would have been 21 years old on 23 Dec 1905, but the Nellie who married Frank MILLER was 19. The 1910, 1920 and 1930 US Census for Kansas City all say that Nellie's father was born in KY, but we know that Joseph FISHER was born in IN. Also, the 1930 US Census for Kansas City has Clara E. FISHER, age 76, as Nellie's mother. So it's the wrong Nellie M. FISHER.\n\nJoseph and Susanna had another child, older than the 4 daughters who appeared in the 1900 Census (above). David Ulysses FISHER was born on 10 Aug 1880 in Sumner, Richland, IL, and died 17 Nov 1961. He is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery, in Harriet, Searcy County, AR, along with his wife, Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" McKinney, born 9 Apr 1913 and died 1 Jun 1952. David and Lizzie were married on 7 Jan 1935 in Van Buren County, AR. He was 54, she was 21, and they were both residents of Cozahome, Searcy County, AR.\n\nBy 1940 Frank and his family had moved to Niles, on the outskirts of Chicago's north side. They rented a home for $30/month at 8233 Niles Center Road. In 1935 the HOGANs resided in Cook County, as did Delbert LIGON, but Callie and Valdean LIGON had resided in Doniphan, Ripley, MO. All the adults worked at a greenhouse, with Frank as Proprietor. Frank and Delbert were Florists, and Ethel and Valdean were Helpers.\n\nArthur Thomas HOGAN's WWII draft card says his employer was \"Hogan And Son Greenhouses.\" It sounds like a strange name for three brothers. Arthur was 5' 11'' dark complexion, blue eyes, black hair. The SSDI records Arthur T. HOGAN's death in San Diego, CA on 19 Feb 1995.\n\n1635 Warren Ave in on the Near West Side, near the present site of Malcolm X College, and 2620 Seminary Ave is 4 miles north, in Lincoln Park, near DePaul University.\n\n1 John L. \"Dow\" HOGAN b: 1854 in Mountain Home, Baxter, AR, d: 1911? in Mountain Home, Baxter, AR\n\n+ Dorothy A. \"Dolly\" WRIGHT b: 1855, m: 19 Oct 1873 in Independence, AR, d: 1904\n\n......2 Joseph Clyde HOGAN b: 19 Sep 1879 in Hardy Sharp, AR\n\n......2 A.
