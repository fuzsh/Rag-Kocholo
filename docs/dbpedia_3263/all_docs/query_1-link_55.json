        "text": "Niecy Morgan\n\nBUYER BEWARE! This lawyer is unprofessional and I would never recommend him to represent anyone, even for a speeding ticket! He will railroad you, and has an attitude beyond my recognition. He doesnâ€™t communicate with his clients and has refused under oath in the State Court in Sacramento, California to file motions on behalf of his clients. He used to be a federal public defender. He even got google to remove my previous negative review. He will contact google to delete reviews. Please go elsewhere for adequate counsel. My brothers cellmate also got rid of him as a lawyer- Jaymar Ross. Coincidence? I think not. Please Run Fast and save your money on someone good and who cares about why they got into law in the first place.\n\nPeter Goodman\n\nI highly recommend Dave. He was professional, honest, and is an excellent attorney. Normally if your fortunate enough to find somebody of his caliber they are either to expensive or to busy. Dave always found time for me. I called him after 8 years to get a copy of my case file needed for a new job. He answered the phone and emailed me a copy (for free) within 5 minutes!"
