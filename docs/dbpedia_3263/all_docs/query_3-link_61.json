        "text": "A Proletariat of One: Libertarianism and the Psychosis of Authority\n\nIssue: 9:2 (the thirty fourth issue)\n\nLibertarianism has a problem, perhaps an insurmountable one, and its problem\n\nlies squarely in the domain from which it is sourced: the intellectual and\n\npolitical elite of the West. As such, it rests on an ontological viewpoint far\n\noutside the purview and experience of quotidian man. Furthermore, it rests on\n\nan epistemology of the person as sovereign, Natural Law, which requires a\n\nconcomitant education or understanding of the Classics, or at least selfawareness\n\nand the ability to think logically. Many non-intellectuals are either\n\nuninterested or incapable of following the Libertarian arguments of personal\n\nsovereignty and instead submit. This unconscious submission to the authority\n\nof a government, father figure, or other self-appointed “authority” relieves the\n\nindividual of the psychological pain of breaking out of the herd. C. G. Jung\n\n(1875-1961) was adamant that to be an individual is a radical act: “To develop\n\none’s own personality is indeed an unpopular undertaking, a deviation that is\n\nhighly uncongenial to the herd, an eccentricity smelling of the cenobite, as it\n\nseems to the outsider [11, Para. 298]. Further, Alexander Hamilton (1755 or\n\n1747-1804) noted that the elite are more than happy to have the masses submit\n\nto their authority without question as it advances their control: “a fondness for\n\npower is implanted in most men, and it is natural to abuse it when acquired”\n\n[9]. The rest of this article explores this psychosis of authority and how\n\nLibertarianism suffers in popularity as a result."
