        "text": "Associate Professor,\n\nSchool for the Future of Innovation in Society\n\nOther ASU affiliations\n\nSenior Global Futures Scientist, Global Futures Scientists and Scholars\n\nLong Bio\n\nErik Fisher is an associate professor in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society and the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes. He is editor-in-chief of the Journal of Responsible Innovation published by Taylor & Francis and directs the international laboratory engagement program on Socio-Technical Integration Research (STIR) as well as the Center for Responsible Innovation.\n\nProfessor Fisher's work has appeared in science policy and science studies journals such as Research Policy; Science and Public Policy; Science, Technology & Human Values; and Nature.\n\nFisher has been a visiting professor at Delft Technical University (2019), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (2018), the Norwegian University of Technology in Norway (2018, 2016), and the University of Twente in the Netherlands (2015).\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D. in Environmental Studies, University of Colorado-Boulder 2006\n\nGraduate Certificate in Science and Technology Policy, University of Colorado-Boulder 2005\n\nM.A.in Classics: Greek Philology, University of Colorado-Boulder 1995\n\nB.A. in Philosophy and Mathematics, St. John's College in Annapolis, MD. 1992\n\nCV\n\nResearch Website URL\n\nResearch Interests\n\nFisher studies the politics and policy of science and technology, including the multi-level governance of emerging technologies from the lab to the legislature. Building upon historical and conceptual understandings of changing relationships between science and society, he studies public policy demands for and practitioner responses to interdisciplinary collaborations between science and the humanities for the sake of enhanced societal responsiveness.\n\nFisher directs the STIR Cities project (NSF #1535120), which explores how interdisciplinary collaboration between scientific experts and “embedded humanists” can support responsible innovation within laboratories and various organizations working on energy innovations across university, industrial, governmental and non-governmental sectors. The project examines the effects of socio-technical collaborations with technical experts working on “smart” energy technologies in both Phoenix, Arizona and Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe project builds on Fisher’s Socio-Technical Integration Research (STIR) project (NSF #0849101), which demonstrated that incorporating societal and ethical reflection into laboratory research on nanotechnology, synthetic biology, biotechnology and neurotechnology can have synergistic effects and support learning, deliberation and practical adjustments to the research. The STIR project studied the effects of semi-structured dialogue and real-time reflection on decision-making in 30 laboratories across a dozen nations. The STIR approach has since been taken up in over three-dozen laboratories across North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia.\n\nFisher also developed the conceptual framework of Midstream Modulation to help understand how technical decision-making may be productively broadened to take into account public values and concerns. His ideas and techniques have played a central role in forming the scholarly frameworks of Anticipatory Governance and of Responsible Innovation.\n\nResearch Group\n\nSTIR Cities\n\nSTIR\n\nPublications\n\nRefereed Publications\n\nVural Özdemir, K.
