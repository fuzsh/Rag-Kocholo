If you would like to know more about the difference between therapy and analysis, please reach out.

And in 2020 I was awarded Distinguished Psychoanalytic Educator by the International Federation of Psychoanalytic Educators (IFPE).\n\nIf you are curious, creative & motivated to look inward & reflect on your personal experience, keep reading! Perhaps you struggle with disturbances in your self-esteem, feel overly self-critical, perfectionistic &/or have difficulties sustaining long-term intimate relationships. Maybe it’s hard telling the story of your life experience & you might struggle with dependency issues that bring about guilt & shame as well as unsatisfying relationships. You find you aren’t as successful professionally & financially as you imagined your potential to be. You might wonder if there is something in the way & you want to understand why...\n\nI invite you to tell your stories in a safe and comfortable ambiance without judgement or agenda. My style promotes curiosity about what might impede or inhibit your aspirations for success and emotional fulfillment. Through creative collaboration we will uncover and discover new ways of relating to signifiant individuals in your life that will help you feel more alive.\n\nReaching out and asking for help can be a difficult endeavor. Realizing this, I want to make our consultation as conversational and comfortable as possible. Those I work with find that I am flexible, relaxed, accepting and easy to talk to. If you think we might be a good fit, please reach out so we may set up some time for a complimentary phone consult.\n\nBack to profile"
