        "text": "Federal Crimes\n\nFederal criminal practice is a complicated area of law that requires years of experience to develop. More than half of the firmâs practice involves representing clients in federal court. The Sacramento office is within walking distance of the federal courthouse. Many clients are charged with serious white collar, drug trafficking, federal firearm, and tax offenses. David Fischer is a Placer County criminal attorney who represents clients in federal court, and has an office in Sacramento. David Fischer is admitted to practice in the Eastern District of California, the Northern District of California, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nAssault, Assault With Deadly Weapons, Great Bodily Injury, Gang Enhancements, and Other Violent Offenses\n\nExperience with representing clients accused of violent offenses, and knowledge of the laws concerning self defense are crucial in these cases. David Fischer is a criminal lawyer who has been defending clients accused of violent offenses since 2003.\n\nDUI, DUI With Injury, Vehicular Manslaughter, and Other Motor Vehicle Offenses\n\nDriving under the influence and other motor vehicle offenses are serious. Clients charged with these crimes are facing potential jail sentences, fines, driver license suspensions, and other collateral consequences such as professional licensing issues, and civil litigation if there is an auto accident. My office has years of experience investigating and navigating clients through the complex issues these cases present. We also represent clients in DMV administrative hearings and with driver licensing issues.\n\nDomestic Violence\n\nA person can be charged with domestic violence for simply willfully and unlawfully touching his or her spouse/cohabitant/fiancÃ©/ex-boyfriend or girlfriend/someone who has or had been in a dating relationship/other parent of the personâs child, in a harmful or offensive manner. An actual injury is not required for some domestic violence crimes. A conviction for such an offense, even as a misdemeanor, can result in a lifetime ban on owning or possessing firearms and ammunition, jail, 52 weeks of batterers treatment, community service, fines, probation, and restitution. Convictions for domestic violence can have other consequences concerning child custody and professional licensing. My office has years of experience defending clients accused of domestic violence offenses.\n\nDrug Crimes in Federal and State Court\n\nViolations of the Controlled Substances Act in federal court involving trafficking of drugs such as methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, marijuana, MDMA, and other prescription pills are serious. Some offenses trigger mandatory minimum federal prison sentences and other harsh consequences. It is crucial to be knowledgeable about laws concerning informants, Fourth Amendment search and seizure rules, and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Experience in sentencing mitigation is often important in these cases.\n\nSimilar drug trafficking offenses in state court are also serious and many of the same Fourth Amendment and informant issues come into play for those offenses.\n\nOur offense has experience in handling all aspects of drug offenses.\n\nFirearm Offenses\n\nUnlawfully possessing firearms can pose serious consequences in both state and federal court. In state court, felony unlawful possession of a firearm is an offense that can trigger a state prison sentence. If charged in federal court, that often means someone has either a serious prior criminal history or is allegedly involved in trafficking of prohibited firearms. Experience with firearms, and being knowledgeable in search and seizure laws, the laws of possession, and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in federal cases, are crucial in these situations.\n\nHomicides\n\nMy office has experience representing clients charged with vehicular manslaughter and murder. As is true in many cases, it is crucial to conduct a complete investigation and gather all available information to formulate a strategy for handling the unique issues these serious cases present.\n\nSex Offenses\n\nConsequences of sex offenses can include jail or prison sentences, fines, probation or parole, registration as a sex offender, payment of restitution, and other penalties. As with other cases, a complete investigation and gathering of information is crucial in formulating defenses to sex offense allegations. For example, common federal crimes involve unlawful possession, manufacture, or distribution of images depicting children. Potential penalties in federal court are enormous. It is crucial to have experienced counsel hire experts knowledgeable in computers and the computer systems law enforcement uses to gather information to identify potential defendants in order to develop defenses in these matters.\n\nCall Today"
