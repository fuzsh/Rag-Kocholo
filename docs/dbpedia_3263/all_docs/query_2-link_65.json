        "text": "David Fisher (fl. c. 2000) is an Israeli-born Italian architect in Florence. He graduated from the University of Florence and also was a lecturer of architecture and structural engineering at the same university. He has designed buildings and proposed schemes for the restoration of ancient monuments. He has dealt with prefabrication and construction technologies. He has invented the concept of the “rotating tower”.\n\nFisher launched Fiteco Ltd. in New York during the mid-eighties while also becoming involved in the development and building of hotels. He researched technologies such as the \"Smart Bathroom by Leonardo da Vinci,\" which is a pre-assembled bathroom system for luxury homes and hotels. Fisher is the founder and chairman of Dynamic Architecture Group. Between 1995 and 1998, Fisher was Honorary Consul of Italy in Israel.\n\nDavid Fisher is the designer of the proposed rotating Dynamic Tower, billed as the world's first building in motion. It was designed with the firm Dynamic Architecture Group. The intention was to build an 80-story skyscraper in Dubai,with revolving floors, some of which could have moved on command, providing residents with an ever-changing shape along with a changing view of the Persian Gulf. In addition to Dubai, rotating towers were thought for London, Paris, New York, Moscow and Bogotá. None of these towers was ever built."
