        "text": "My Professional Background\n\nWith a shared vision of providing our clients with comprehensive and personally tailored advice to help them achieve their financial goals and objectives, I joined with David Hanson in 2007, combining our financial services practices to form the Hanson-Fisher Wealth Management Group.\n\nWe now have a total of six talented financial management professionals who are dedicated to providing comprehensive financial advice and white glove service our clients expect and deserve.\n\nPrior to joining Benjamin F. Edwards & Co. in 2010 and helping open the firm’s seventh branch – and the company’s first in greater Chicagoland – I worked as a financial advisor for 12 years with A.G. Edwards (now Wells Fargo Advisors). Prior to my career in financial consulting, I worked for nearly 10 years in corporate finance and marketing for a Fortune 500 company.I am committed to helping clients develop financial strategies that help them build, protect and distribute their wealth, while also managing the impact of taxes.\n\nI work hard to gain a clear understanding of my clients’ financial situation and immediate and long-term goals. I work with them to formulate an investment approach that can incorporate private money management, equity and fixed income investments, mutual funds, managed futures, and annuities. My mission is to help them achieve their financial goals, whether they are sending children to college, planning for retirement, or passing wealth on to their heirs.\n\nI frequently conduct classes on investment issues, including equity investment and dividend strategies, retirement and estate planning topics, and presentations to business owners on retirement benefits, liquidity matters, and executive compensation.\n\nI enjoy running, woodworking, am a licensed pilot and enjoy auto sports. My wife, Ruth, and I have three children and enjoy family camping trips and motorcycling.\n\nEducation and Credentials"
