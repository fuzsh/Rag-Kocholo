Previously, he's held roles at Johns-Manville, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Danzas Corp. and others, DTI officials said in a press release.\n\n\"We sought a leader with a strong business acumen, industry insight and collaborative spirit, and someone who can further the DTI mission of developing the future leaders of transportation, logistics and supply chain,\" said Michael McGuire, dean of Denver's University College, where DTI is housed. \"We're confident that David will help build on the program's strengths and industry partnerships to deliver an exceptional student experience.\"\n\nDTI offers an executive master's degree in transportation management, as well as a graduate program in supply chain management.\n\nThe DTI represents the bond between industry and higher education, Fisher said.\n\n\"For more than 20 years, DTI has manifested leadership that ensures the growth, efficiency and effectiveness of logistics and its critical role in global stability,\" said Fisher. \"Having an opportunity to build on the legacy of DTI is the privilege of a lifetime.\""
