        "text": "David Fisher, executive director at Morgan Stanley, moved to Alpharetta with his family more than four years ago. Fisher, the lead for Morgan Stanley’s new office in Alpharetta, represents the company’s wealth management technology group and the global banking and operations technology group.\n\n“Morgan Stanley is a technology-driven firm, and Alpharetta was built from the ground up to support a high-tech, high-traffic technology presence,” said Fisher. “E-Trade from Morgan Stanley has been in Alpharetta for many years, and so as the company continues to establish its presence here, this city is built to grow with us. And, we’re here to invest in its ongoing growth.”\n\nMorgan Stanley originally became involved with Tech Alpharetta because a core value of the company is giving back to local communities through charities, sponsorships and local philanthropic efforts. The company hosts a STEAM mentoring program in partnership with Tech Alpharetta and the Innovation Academy in Alpharetta. The program fosters relationships with local, female technology leaders and female students at the Innovation Academy. Fisher shared that Morgan Stanley also sponsored a Hack-a-thon that will promote the growth of the STEAM mentoring program as it seeks to expand into universities across the state to reach women at the college level.\n\nFisher believes that Alpharetta’s high quality of life, schools and diverse communities will continue to attract talent from around the country. “Tech Alpharetta was an obvious partner for us as we look to build our presence here and invest in the community,” added Fisher."
