But somewhere along the line we forget to dream and end up settling. Join Up Dots features amazing people who refuse to give up and chose to go after their dreams. This is your blueprint for greatness. So here’s your host live from the back of his garden in the UK. David Ralph.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nYes, hello there, everybody and welcome to Join Up Dots. Yes, it’s it’s another skipping episode. If you listen back to Episode 263. We had a lady call Michelle Joanie, and she has created a movement in New York City where she gets crowds of people to literally skip hand in hand around the streets like he would as a small child. Now, today’s guest is also a Skipper, but he does it in a very man the way and it’s a show that is all about perseverance, talent, struggle. ultimate success. He’s a man who has got to the top and he’s chosen career, and he’s now a world Guinness Book world record holder to back in 1998 he broke the world record for the most revolutions turned with a jump rope while pushing off and landing only on his backside in one minute yet he did 56 rump jumps almost one of the second he has since jumped his way into books, TV shows, countless live shows and now a series of energetic music albums and he’s own instructional books by teaching kids and adults everywhere to get in shape while having fun. And the road warriors he calls himself shows aspiring rump joke little about Say that again. aspiring a jump ropers how they can become a rope stuntman and record holders themselves and amaze friends and family with incredible speed and agility. But this isn’t one of those conversations that is all about having fun and enjoying yourself but is instead is about hustle drive and commitment to the task. This is a show about Man driven to be the best that he can possibly be. So where did his love of ropes and fitness come from? And how did you realise that you can actually make a living at this? Well, let’s find out as we bring on to the show to start joining up dots with the one and only Mr. David Fisher. AKA the Rope Warrior. How are you sir?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nFine, thanks. How are you David?\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nI’m very well and you know every time I practice that I find shows aspiring jump rope is that’s hard to say. I knew that I was going to trick myself up on that is is is it difficult for yourself when you’re in sort of motivational speak mode? Can you say the words shows aspiring rump I can’t even say now jump rope. Are you fluent at that now\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nshows aspiring jumpers.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nYou had that was that you had to bow Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, it’s not easy. It just shows that this show isn’t about perfection is about bringing the motivational stories. So Mr. Fisher or the rope warrior as you Cold you’ve got an interesting life, haven’t you? Because, you know in the introduction I said, you make a living at this and quite obviously you do make a living at this but it’s one of those stories that when I read it, I thought, well how the hell does he make a living at this? Was it a struggle to get going?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nWell, I started jumping rope to train for volleyball, I was a double a volleyball player. And like I said, started I wanted to jump higher. I wanted to improve my endurance, and started jumping rope and just fell in love with the sport because there’s so many different fun, creative things that you can do with it. And just started practising all the time and then started volunteering with the American Heart Association. They have a programme called Jump Rope for Heart. And I was out doing performances at schools and somebody told me about a thing called showcase which is where people who do school assemblies common preview their shows and then people from the school Come and take a look at everybody and talk to them at their boots. And after I went to one of these showcases, everything just kind of exploded, and I wound up doing tonnes of school assemblies, which has been the staple of my business for the last 23 years. And I’m really happy that I stumbled into this little niche. Because performing for children is just a wonderful thing. And there’s just so much energy you get from from an audience of, you know, elementary school kids, I mean, I perform for adults to or perform at colleges and performance corporations. But, you know, I really love performing in elementary schools, you know, you I’m a rock star there at times, and I do some really interactive things with the kids, I bring them up on stage. I’m able able to make some of them heroes in front of the whole school, and it’s just really rewarding and I’m feeling very blessed having found something I love to do and find a way to make a nice living doing it as well.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nBut it is fascinating when you say it’s a small niche or a niche, as we say, in the United Kingdom. I’ve got so confused because I speak to so many Americans now, I’m not sure if it’s niche or niche, but\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nI wasn’t sure either. Yeah. And I said it. I was like, wonder if that was right.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nYeah, I’m always confused by that one. But it’s true nowadays, with the global connection that we have, via the internet, that people can make a good living on things that are, you know, a small niche, a tiny little area, but you can, you can create income. And it really sort of sets the theme of the whole show, really not this show, but all of them where, I suppose 20 years, 30 years ago, you would be opening a business, you’d be doing brick and mortar, you’ll be doing that kind of stuff with the expenses of rent and and god knows what employee costs and all that kind of stuff. But now you can literally find the smallest little dots Within the internet and create income, did you find that passionate in the inner sort of wider sense, but so many people can find the life they want doing these things? Which, on the outside, you kind of go, Well, how are they doing it?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nWell, in my new book that just came out with all these different rope jumping things at the very beginning of the book. You know, for me, I think my wife, who, you know, she goes to work every day and maybe she’s really good at what she does, but there’s aspects of her job that she doesn’t enjoy as much but I, you know, I thank her for doing what she does that allows me you know, and she gets the insurance from from what she does. It’s allowed me to do, you know, a job that I love to do and also, you know, in, in our country in your country, you know, we have the freedom to do what we want and I in the beginning of the book, I thank all our men and women in our armed services for fighting for our freedoms. And, you know, I feel blessed living in a country that that we can we have the freedom to do what we want to do.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nAnd but but that doesn’t excite you though, but people nowadays have got that opportunity that they they never have because he tells me, I literally want to run down the street saying, you don’t have to do the crappy job anymore. You can find something that you love doing and work on it. And you can do it for almost nothing. So but ultimately any rewards you get a profit.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nTrue. Yeah. I mean, if you find something that you love to do, you know, the saying is, you know, you never work a day in your life. And it’s definitely it’s, it’s an exciting thing. And I’ve, obviously was very passionate about rope jumping, but my new thing is I’ve been writing songs as well and that’s kind of my new passion. And I’m really excited about that. And quite often when I talk to people I try to explain like, you know, how I unlock the doors, some of these different things that I found and hope to sometimes inspire them to find what they’re passionate about and pursue that.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nWhich is, I suppose one of those things that people can’t quite grasp at the very beginning when they’re working on something. It’s, it’s just that one thing, but as you proceed through and you start getting notice when opportunities come to you, and more often than not, they’re not the thing that you originally thought about. But you start thinking, acquire that see that I imagine with yourself looking at that you’re on TV shows you do live shows, music album, when you started skipping, you can’t possibly a thought that you were going to be doing all that kind of stuff.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nDefinitely not. You know, some things just kind of fell into place. And when I guess when I find things that I’m really passionate about and really enjoy doing. I like to work on the A lot and get better and better and try and surround myself with people that know more about certain aspects of things that I’m doing and learn a little bit from a lot of different people and try and bring it all together and and find my own path.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nSo how do you know that you can do this David when away from the skipping let’s think about all the other opportunities that come through? Because that’s one of the things that stops so many people in their tracks. If I said to them, go out and write a book, I want a book, I’m not a writer, I’ll go out and do Oh, no, I can’t do this. And we we sell limit. So how do you actually break down those barriers? First of all, when somebody comes along to you and says to you, for example, okay, we want you to make a music album or we want you to write a book. What stops you doing what so many people do and no, no, I’m happy with my skipping. I’ll just stay here. Thanks very much. Wow.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nI don’t know that I’ve ever been been faced with a situation that somebody told me they wanted me to do something specific other than I like to say that my family was very lovingly discouraging in the beginning. And my mother, I remember specifics, talk with my mother who came and said, David, I just don’t think you’re very focused. And I replied that, you know, I’m, I think I am focused. I’m just not focused in the direction you’d like me to be focused in. And\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nwhat did she want for you? What was the focus? She,\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nyou know, I have\n\nto tell this story to\n\nmy father was speaking with someone and she asked him, she saw me and she said, Oh, this, this must be your son that’s in accounting. And my dad said, No, she said, Oh, this must be your son. That’s the law school. My dad said no, he said, This is my summits in trouble.\n\nSo I,\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nI forgot what I was gonna say because I want to tell that story to talk talking about the family not being encouraging at the beginning and not having the opportunities where somebody come to you, you basically made your own opportunities.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nOh, the reason I told that story, I definitely think my family wanted me to find a more traditional type of job. And, you know, with all the security that goes along with that, and like I said, My brother is a teacher and accounting professor. And then I have another brother that went to law school and I chose to jump rope for living.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nBut your brothers and I’m going to be sort of devil’s advocate, and I’m saying this to Mrs. Fisher, if her name is Mrs. Fisher, that your son David is out there creating his own income, which is the less risky route nowadays, isn’t it? Oh, your brothers in employment by could literally go in any day and I go, Oh, the businesses in trouble, you’re out. Did you see that more and more nowadays about the risky route is actually being an employee? Or is the risky route being an entrepreneur?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nWow, that’s an interesting question.\n\nYou know, certainly an honour with our economy here in the United States, the last five or so years has been more difficult. You know, for 17 years, I picked up the phone I filled up my calendar was kind of a no brainer. And for the last few years I’m I’m working much harder\n\nto generate the business than I used to have to work.\n\nAnd those who have had a steady salary job haven’t been as affected by the recession as I’ve been. But during some of my downtime where I in years past I would have been performing all the time I try and make the best use of my time as I could and, and because I wasn’t performing as much as it freed me up to, I wrote another book, and I recorded two CDs and you know, so\n\nI’m thankful that, you know, for that opportunity.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nAnd but but do you think that people nowadays for the kids coming through and this this is once again one of the big questions but I’m just throwing at you, but they’re coming through the education system, they’re coming out the upper end, and it’s get a job, get a job, get your resume, you got to get a job, get a job, do you think that we should be saying to them now, hang on, slow down. Think about what you actually love doing. And before you come out the education system, start playing around on the internet playing around on computers because kids are far more savvy on back kind of area than we used to be. And see if you can get a side hustle going before you come out. Because when you’ve got an option of building something You do love alongside actually going and building a career for yourself. Because I think most of us go into careers just because it’s a career. And then we get to a certain point, maybe in our late 20s and 30s, where we think something I can do this for the rest of my life, what am I doing, and you’re kind of almost trapped. Did you think we should be getting the kids early before they come out to say, there’s a side hustle here and you’ve got opportunities that we never had?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nYeah, I agree with that. I mean, I I remember from my entrepreneurship class in college, that the opportunity cost of doing something when you’re younger is much less. Because you you know, if you’re going to do something like to be an entrepreneur, because you’re not supporting a family and you’re you wouldn’t necessarily be leaving this job that you have, in order to pursue this venture that you were looking at So yeah, I mean I think it’s great for people to look around and maybe find their passion when they’re younger for sure. Because like I said before, if you you know, you find something you’re really interested in it’s it doesn’t even seem like work and you know, whatever it is that you’re doing is you know can be exciting and and\n\nand you know, it’s a\n\nleads for a very blessed life I feel. Sometimes though if you do have a normal job you can, you know, accumulate some wealth that you may not have had you chosen another path and maybe will lead something down the road. I know there’s a saying I guess in either billiards or golf that sometimes you that you should make the shot that will make the make the next shot easier. So depending on, you know what it is that you might be passionate about, you can still kind of pursue something on the side, even if you have your own job and then figure out a way, eventually to put it all together and to do the venture that you really wanted to do to join those dots.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nSo, so if we took you back to the the, the young David, the sort of the teenager, David, before you come out of school, what what was your path? What were you aiming to do? Was was it going to be skipping? Or was it something else?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nOh, no, the young teenager Dave, don’t clue. I was good in math. So, you know, my parents, from a young age were like, oh, you’re going to be an accountant, you know, that kind of a thing. And then when I got to college, I, I could I think I knew all the things that I didn’t want to be, but couldn’t really figure it out yet. I always said the only suit that I want to wear to work as a warm up suit. And so, I, you know, my dream job because I was playing volleyball was what’s going to be like playing on the pro beach volleyball tour that was that was the best job I could think of doing. And you know, I worked really hard at volleyball I was a double a volleyball player played against some of the guys who played in the Olympics. And that led me to rope jumping, so I’m happy for that as well.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nSo could you not have got to be the volleyball player?\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nCould I not have\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nDid you not have that extra X Factor but would have taken you into sort of the Olympic standard or was it just not in your heart of hearts when you got to that, that top area where you’ve really got to push on and really sort of sacrifice everything was your heart in it to become the volleyball player.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nI think my heart was in it. I’m not quite as tall as I Like to event and you know, my, my arm span isn’t, you know, it would be better if I had longer arms for volleyball. But I certainly you know I gave it a really good shot and you know I don’t know that I gave up volleyball because I couldn’t have made it I gave up volleyball because I found rope jumping, that I had to stop playing volleyball because I know now this was my my job was jumping rope and performing and if I got hurt playing volleyball, I didn’t want to jeopardise my rope. Jumping career\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nis a fascinating point, but so many people have in their lives when they’re working towards something and I’ve gotten a passion for something and all the way through. That’s what it is. That’s what it is. That’s what I’m going to be and when something comes along, that changes your focus and you suddenly think Hang on a second. This is what I want to do. But there’s a kind of face saving element where other people go, No, no, I’ve told everyone i’m going to be this I’m going to carry on here anyway. Did you feel that at that time when you started to do this, all of the jumping, I can imagine, you know, when you think of skipping, you think of little girls and you think of boxes. So you think of little girls and the world’s toughest men and there’s, there’s not a great sort of era in between. I don’t personally know any people that would skip other than those people. Was it something that you kind of kept secret? Or was it something you go to your mom and dad, this is what I’m gonna do and I went, David, David, what are you doing? You know, you’ve been so focused on volleyball. Why are you suddenly changing now? Was there any of that going on?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nUm, no, I don’t know if it my parents would tell me to go to go play volleyball. I mean, they. They were more interested in and having me find a normal career path.\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nBut\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nI don’t know. What was the exact question and you know, it’s very early here in the morning to talk and then lose my train of thought,\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nwell, when that that that moment come that you you found the jumps, you found that the skipping and but your path had been on something else for, you know, months and months or years and years and years. A lot of people will look at that as a wasted effort. No, no, I can’t I can’t get off of this road now because this is what I’ve been working towards. But you seem to go now Hang on. This is the direction I should be going. And he was quite happy to move that way. Was that a kind of problem that you had at that time? Did you think to yourself? No, no, I’ve wasted all these years on volleyball or did you just go No, I found something that I didn’t know was going to be there. This is my Park.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nWell, I didn’t have to make the choice. Right away to Give up volleyball. I mean, I was playing volleyball all the time, and I was jumping rope. And, you know, didn’t really have to give up volleyball till, you know, I saw that rope jumping was going to be a career for me. And then I just, you know, just didn’t want to get hurt and didn’t want to push my luck. So I did both of them for a while I didn’t. It wasn’t like I found jumping rope, and then immediately gave up volleyball. So there was a there was a transition period where I did both things for a while.\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nUntil when I was working on top of it.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nAnd when did you start thinking this is a business. This isn’t just me having fun with a rope and trying skills and stuff but I could actually create income on this was that early days or much later on?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nThat was fairly early. That was I mentioned it before I went to this thing called showcase, which is where it’s a trade show for people who do school assemblies and after it Did my short little performance there was a giant line at my booth, you know, for people that wanted to hire me to come to their schools and, you know, once I started doing that, and then you know, by word of mouth, other schools got interested in and I never looked back from there.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nBut what what made you go to showcase because that that wouldn’t be in my mind if I was thinking while I’m doing skipping, okay, set myself up to go around schools, that that almost seems like a charitable occupation more than actually building income. What made you go to that showcase?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nWell, yeah, you were right. Because in the very beginning, when I was rope jumping, I kept thinking, someone’s gonna see me, they’re gonna put me in a commercial on TV, I’m going to be famous and all my problems are going to be solved. And then, you know, but I kept working at my craft. Somebody mentioned this showcase thing, and, you know, I went to that and then stumbled into the school assembly market and I’m you know, like I said before the really thrilled to be doing that as the staple of my business because I enjoy that. You know, and I’ve done it lots of halftime shows, I do corporate events, but I really enjoy performing for children. There’s just an energy you get from an audience full of kids that you don’t, you know, get from a from a corporate, you know, like a corporate show. So, for instance, when I go and do, you know, a dinner in a corporation and I’m, I’m the performer and I’m out there, and I’m looking around and people are eating or you know, I don’t even feel like sometimes they’re paying attention. And I get done with the show and someone will come up and say, you know, I have no idea that they even enjoyed it and someone you know, people come up with like, that was the most amazing thing we’ve ever saw. That was fantastic show, I had no idea. And when you go and perform, you know, in an elementary school and you’ve got third through sixth grade sitting there, and there’s, I’m doing these glow ropes, which are light sticks that are inside the jump rope and the kids are screaming so loud that can’t even hear the music, you know, you know that the show’s going really well. So, as an entertainer, you know, there’s just there’s not nothing better than an audience full of of children.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nAre you naturally a show up? Are you somebody that as always liked getting up in front of people and doing these kind of things?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nNow you’re into something? Yeah, I think.\n\nI think in the beginning, when I was playing volleyball, you know, I would just do different training things in the gym. And I think in the beginning, it came because I found a very difficult time finding women that I was at attracted to and so\n\nI would do things\n\nI thought were kind of, you know, not showing off a little bit, but, you know, hoping that maybe somebody would see me and I could strike up a conversation because in addition to that, I was also pretty shy. And so yeah, you know, I would do things volleyball training things that were kind of show off, like being in front of everybody doing that kind of stuff. And then when I found rope jumping, I would, I would, you know, is that my university and I’d find my little spot, you know, in this big atrium and put on my music and just perform and people would walk by and you know, and watch me for a while and and I enjoyed that. And then at times, I feel more comfortable in a spotlight in front of a large room filled with people than I do. You know, talking one on one with somebody I met at a party.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nWell, you were saying these before recording, but he was saying, listeners, just imagine it’s a conversation between the two of us over a pint. And David was quite open and said, I actually find that harder vein being in front of 13 million people. Is it because when it’s the bigger crowds they all blow into one and it’s not the kind of the intensity the eyeballs because I heard George Michael say once that he would prefer singing in front of 100,000 people van to people looking at him. He\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nagree with that. Yeah, that that’s how I feel about it as well. Also, when I’m performing, you know, I have part of the show is kind of scripted, and so I know what I’m going to say there. And then another part is improv where I have the audience give me any trick that they can think of. were two people using one room. And I work it out with the people that are up on stage with me. And you know, I’ve just done that enough that I’m just so comfortable taking it in whatever direction it winds up going it just as I’m sure you are with these radio broadcasts, comfortable in listening to, you know, the interaction you’re having with someone and then and then taking in a certain direction. For me doing a one on one conversation isn’t in my wheelhouse as it as it might be in yours.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nSo So how do you structure your shows when you’re on a TV show, for example, and they give you maybe 30 seconds or two minutes to do your thing? Is that easier to do it or is it harder when you’ve got a bite sized chunk, but you’ve got to almost do the the highlights the show highlights in that in that area?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nRight. I mean, I guess it depends on how long of a segment I’m going to get certainly You know, the thing that I’m known for most is jumping rope while I’m seated on the ground. Officially, they’re called rump jumps, I call them to push ups instead of push ups. And so I always do that. And then, you know, sometimes it’ll depend on whether there’s going to be music, or whether I’m going to need to speak right after I do the performance. You know, sometimes they want to hook me up with the microphone and have me jump around while I’m wearing that. And sometimes, that’s difficult. Or if I do the most exhaustive thing and right before I have to talk again, you know, that’s just something in consideration, I guess, when I’m doing a TV thing.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nBut let’s play the words of Jim Carrey at this point, because he said some fantastic words a couple of years ago, but really emphasises most of the conversations we have at this point. This is Jim Carrey.\n\nJim Carrey\n\nMy father could have been a great comedian, but he didn’t believe that that was possible for him. And so he made a conservative choice. Instead he got a Safe job as an accountant. And when I was 12 years old, he was let go from that safe job. And our family had to do whatever we could to survive. I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which was that you can fail at what you don’t want. So you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nThere’s a lot of truth in that statement to your life, isn’t it with with the Father talking about being an accountant and all those safe routes and not quite having the belief of doing something that you love? Did I resonate with you those words?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nOh, definitely. Yeah.\n\nYeah, for sure. I\n\nthere’s no guarantees in life and so you know, if you can find something you love that that would definitely be my advice to someone. And like I said before, it’s it’s easier to pursue your passions when you’re younger and your opportunity cost are just great.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nSo So do you have children and commitments and you mentioned your wife, but do you have others or responsibilities?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nYes, we have two boys, Felix and Max and one is nine and one is six.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nAnd what do you think about skipping dead? They must look at you as a rock star as you you said those words when you first went into the school, that you feel like a rock star and they must see you that way. My dad goes out and he does this and he’s on TV and he he’s a Guinness Book of Records holder by inspired but what you’re doing are you leaving your legacy into your your kids?\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nWell, I you know,\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nI think that they’re inspired. I think that they\n\nare oldest Felix, he likes to teach and so you know, he’s seen me lecturing for front of large groups, and so he likes to do that. Well, he likes to help people learn different things. And I’m trying not to force anything on them. You know, they’ve been performing with me since they were young. So I bring them, you know, because they were coming to the shows with me. And so I would put them in the shows and they still enjoy doing that. But I haven’t, you know, I don’t like when we get home. I don’t say, you know, now you need to practice your jump rope because, you know, you know, someday you might want to do what daddy does, because I haven’t forced anything on them. I feel that they’ll, they’ll join up their own dots and figure out what they want to do when they’re older. But if they certainly show an interest in it and want to, you know, get better and better. I’m happy to work with them as much as they would like to.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nBecause what you’re doing David, you’re you’re not teaching them skipping. You’re teaching them how to hustle, won’t you and perseverance and getting out there and making things happen, which I certainly don’t remember having when I was growing up, my father was a car mechanic. And he used to just work outside in the garbage and cars used to come to him and he used to mend them. And I don’t remember ever seeing him hustling to go out and get business and, and create in such a way as you are. But the message that you’re giving your kids there, they’re soaking it up on by you, but actually, Dad looks like he’s having a blooming good time here. And he’s enjoying himself and when I get older, I don’t want to be an accountant. Not that accountancy is not great. And I love accountants because I do all the kind of things that I don’t want to do. So brilliant. There’s loads of accountants all over the place, but they must look at you and go, he’s having a good time. I want a bit of this when I get older.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nYeah, I would hope so. I mean, I I hope that I’m setting a good example and And other aspects of life as well. But yeah, I mean, I, they come around with me and they see me not only perform but also we went to the Children’s Museum and you know, stumble across somebody that was there do it from a corporation and you know, so they’ve often seen me go up and introduce myself to someone and you know, hand them a flyer whatever it is so that they’ve seen me hustling and that part of it as well. And yeah, I mean, I think that there’s lots of good they learn things from me and I learned things from them as well.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nAnd how do you how do you do that go up to somebody you you mentioned that you were shy and you’re not comfortable with that one on one interaction. That’s difficult, isn’t it to go up to somebody Introduce yourself that’s that’s like speed dating at his worst\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nYes, but you know, sometimes you just have to push yourself out of your comfort zone. And you know, when you’re passionate about what you what you want to do, and you know, you’re always looking for ways to do that, more or better. You know, you’re sometimes have to do some of the things that that you’re not comfortable doing.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nAnd do you look back over a period of time and actually go? Yeah, okay. It’s, it’s, it’s all right now, I still don’t really like doing it. But it wasn’t as big a deal as it was in my head when I started, which is one of the sort of the, the game stoppers, isn’t it when people are thinking of doing something, they perceive what they have to do, and because obviously, it’s out of their comfort zone because I’ve never done it before. It’s terrible. I know I can’t do that. I couldn’t reach out to a complete stranger. I couldn’t make that phone call. I couldn’t do all that. But once you do it and you’ve done it five or 10 times, it’s not too bad. Is it? Really?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nNo, not at all. I mean, you know,\n\nlike I said, when I was in college,\n\nyou know, I was thinking about all the things that I don’t want to do. And, you know, I was like, Oh, I don’t want to be out, like being a salesman hustling all the time. And I’m a salesman all the time. Now, you know, you have to be when you have your own business. So if you find something you’re passionate about and find something that you enjoy talking about and selling, then it makes things a lot easier.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nSo Wendy, this is the million dollar question really. And we always talk about finding your passion. But when did the thing that you just liked doing the skipping, become your passion because we’re, passions don’t come easily. But things liking things come quite easily and I’m a great believer that the people looking for something fun to do in their life that they can build an income on. Don’t look for the big passion because it’s really hard to find, just find something that you like, and then become very good at it until it becomes your passion. Can you remember a moment when you actually thought this is this is worth persevering? This is something that I’m really going to become an expert at. It’s more than what I thought at the beginning.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nWell, at the beginning, I started taking a jump rope class at this health club that I was at. And, you know, it was just mostly for training, like I said, and working at it and working at it. And then so I had kind of that perspective that the, you know, the person teaching the class does rope jumping in a certain way. And you know, you learn from that person. And then I started thinking about maybe that there’s some other ways to do things with the jump rope, and you know, this was before YouTube or anything like that. And so I started hanging out with the real Nick geminus who that’s the event, the Olympics with the ribbon and the ball in the clubs and hoop and that kind of unlocked a whole new arena of tricks and things that you could do with this rope. So release moves things that looked like cowboy leiria type of roping tosses. And so I was hanging out with the rhythmic jennison and they also have a strong base in ballet. And so I was learning tricks from them and then\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nalso started\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nfound my love for dance, which I’d never had before. And because I was looking for anything and everything that I could now incorporate with the jump rope, so when I first started, you know, it was only just the the traditional jump rope type of things. But then I started to think about look at it from a different angle and think about other disciplines that I could bring into what I was doing and incorporate so rhythmic gymnastics is part of what I do. Dance is part of what I do then and also martial arts are different things I’ve seen with different techniques and weapons and I started bringing that in. And so my programme is called rope mastics which is a combination of rope jumping dance, martial arts, rhythmic gymnastics, and, you know, other crazy stuff that I’ve come along, come up with\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nalong the way. So so you wanted to become an expert. So there was that moment when you suddenly thought now Hang on, I’m gonna, I’m going to be aware, I’m going to look around I’m going to find out what other people are doing. Because I’ve now got the passion to become as good as I possibly can at bat. Would that be true?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nAbsolutely. You know, when there’s some saying about when you think you know, everything you really don’t know very much and when you read realise how little you know, then you know a lot. So I’m always looking to learn new things, whether it be in rope jumping, or you know any other aspect of my life.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nThat’s it. That’s a great thing to say, isn’t it when you realise that you don’t know a lot, you know too much, because that that really starts you digging, doesn’t it? And I say this a lot on the shows. But this show kind of was tailored for the people in cubicles of people that were commuting back and forth doing jobs about I don’t like which I was for many, many years. So the kind of ideal avatar for this show was me really when I started it, and I used to say to people, the only way that you can find out what you want to do against having that list of only knowing what you don’t want to do because you’ve tried it and you don’t like doing it is by becoming aware, start looking around and finding out the things that people are doing and listening to podcast and going on to radio shows and seminars and really just becoming a better sponge for extra information because when you realise that you don’t know anything yet, that is the key point. That’s the key point when it starts moving in your direction because you start digging, digging, digging, just like up.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nRight. And in the very beginning of the process, you can learn a lot very quickly because there’s a lot out there and, you know, it’s exciting to get better and better at something very quickly. And so that’s kind of and I’ve seen that now with my songwriting. In the beginning, I didn’t know what I was doing. But I have friends that are, you know, very talented singer songwriters, and I speak with them and, and, you know, it’s something that I’m now very passionate about and getting better all the time.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nWhich I mean, that’s fascinating. So, you say about when you start something, it’s quite easy to become quite good at it. Actually, when you get to a point where you’re quote unquote, playing with the big guys who have been around for years and years, and that is when practice perseverance struggle really starts coming in, which is, which is one of the killers for so many dreams, people get that very quick momentum and think that they’re doing really well for themselves. And when they hit that level, but it’s not moving on, but actually what they’re doing is they’re getting better, they’re getting better, but they’re playing in the bigger arena.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nRight? That’s part of it. And you know, just like, I train and work out all the time, and so, you, you know, you plateau after a while you start something and and you’re improving, improving, improving and then, you know, you get to that point where you’re not improving as quickly anymore. And so you start to plateau. And and that’s where, you know, if you really if you found something that you’re really passionate about that that’s what pushes you to To keep going, even if you have plateaued, you can still, you know, still work at something and get better at it.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nDid you always know that you were going to be the road warrior? When when did that name come to you? Was there a point when you were just David Fisher, and then suddenly equal now and you’re and I’m pretty good at this, I need, I need a rockstar name.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nI came up with that name because I was writing. I was thinking that not only if I could get discovered to be in a commercial, that would be a great thing. I was gonna write a movie script. And someone was gonna I was gonna send that off, and they’re going to make a movie, and I’m going to star in some movie. So I started writing a science fiction superhero thing. And I had seen the movie The Road Warrior years ago, and I’ll mention Yeah, that’s right. And so I’m all about wordplay. And so I you know, I changed it from the road warrior to the rope warrior and found that science fiction superhero type of name, and I thought that also would be a great thing to go when I go to the schools to have something that will kind of get everybody’s attention right away.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nWhen 8000 doesn’t mean he can see you when you go, I can see you when you get anywhere and I go, right in the next 10 minutes, we’ve got the rope warrior. That’s a lot better than saying we’ve got David Fisher and these ropes, isn’t it?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nI think so. Although I’ve been Miss introduced several times as the\n\nrope lawyer.\n\nThe Road Runner once I think, I don’t know just different things that you know, sometimes they butchered the pronunciation or didn’t understand what I was saying sometimes. The rope lawyer sounds\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nlike some kind of suicide pact, but that’s not. That’s not a good thing to be led onto the stage. So just before we play the words of Steve Jobs, I’ve been looking at a picture of you for the last 15 minutes when you’re doing your rump jumps. And for anybody who doesn’t know what that is, is literally you’re not using your hands to push yourself off, you’re just sort of bouncing and the sweat is coming off you, I can see your stomach muscles almost tearing apart, because you’ve got to keep your legs up. You got to keep your backup your stomach up whilst skipping with these roads that go underneath you every second and you basically bounce you bounce on your backside. Now, I’m partial to a bit of backside bouncing, but I can’t imagine doing that at all that that that is a killer, isn’t it?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nThat’s abdominal muscles and hip flexors get you up off the ground, not a picture. You’re looking at the ropes kind of going sideways. And that’s not Technically the way I did the they had me do a world record it was with a going over my head and then it’s hard to explain. Probably doesn’t make for good radio. But yeah, it’s it’s much more of a strength thing somebody had mentioned they had seen somebody doing something with a martial arts weapon where they swing it underneath them and jumping. And they said, maybe you should try that. And so I did. And then once I did it the way they explained it, I tried to do it. I’ve tried to find different variations on it. And then came up with the with the way that I set the world record for\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nbecause I used to hold a world record Hold on.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nTo my knowledge, no one’s no one’s beating it. Yeah. So\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nare you pretty safe? Aren’t you on that one? Really?\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nYeah, I’m gonna have\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\ndreams of you know, wait a few more years and then like trying it again.\n\nSee if I can beat it again. But\n\nthat might be quite an endeavour. I’m, I’m 51 now. And it’s not going to be as easy it was, you know, when I was in my 30. So\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nWow, I don’t know, if you watch rocky six, he got up again and did the stuff you could do. Yeah, you could do that. So did you feel encouraged to do our world records as well because I was actually just before I started recording this morning I was watching a Guinness world record attempt. And when I was a kid, a lot of them were like amazing stuff. I used to get the book and I used to look through it. And it used to be, you know, the first man to space and first man to do this and always kind of incredible stuff. With the greatest respect, I’m seeing more and more records. Now. I think that’s just rubbish. And there was a man this morning who was doing the World Record sliming. So basically pulling a bucket of slime over somebody and he had to do something like 59 in a minute. And he just had this line of people walking in front of him and he was getting these buckets and pulling them over his head. So all he was doing was picking up a bucket and dropping it on these people and he became a Guinness Book of Records holder. And about two days ago, I saw a gentleman do the world record of putting consecutive jumpers on in a minute, which is like 11 so you put one on and then you put another one over your head number one, they’re kind of rubbish on like a rubbish Guinness Book of Records, but you’re yours one I just look at and I know I couldn’t even start it. That’s a good one, isn’t it?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nI like the one that I have. Yeah, certainly there’s a lot of them where people are just doing kind of freakish things that you know, I would certainly not interested in trying to break but yeah, sometimes if I was looking at something and saw what the world record was for something. If I didn’t think it would jeopardise, you know, my rope jumping career, I would think about breaking another record, I did try to break the World Endurance record before I set the actual you know, the rump jump record that I have. And I went 17 and a half hours and I got dehydrated and had to stop what you skip\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nthe 17 and a half hours.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nWell, with those insurance records for every hour that you go, you get a five minute break and you can accumulate the brakes and when I had stopped I had about 25 minutes where the break stored up. But it wasn’t enough and I didn’t realise how dehydrated I was and and I was about halfway to the record and I just thought better of it at that point. And I was part of this charity event that I was doing and I really didn’t feel like pushing myself to the point where They’d have to call the ambulance and cart me out of there. If I was, you know, much closer to the record, I’d have probably gone for it. But I was about halfway there at 17 and a half hour. So I\n\nI made a decision to stop at that point.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nAnd what people disappointed around you were like going, No, keep going, keep going, you’ve done so well.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nIt was the middle of the night and there weren’t, you know, where there was a whole bunch of other things going on as well because it was a this big charity thing that was going on throughout the night. And so I was part of it. I made it through my last TV interview, before I stopped. And, you know, when you’re dehydrated, it’s it’s really hard to to get it back. So I think it was a good decision. I’m not second guessing myself on that one.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nI think the only thing that you did wrong on that, David and I’ll be honest with you, it always have a pile of 12 jumpers by the side. So if you give up On that you can go what I’m going to do to jump around and you’d be a world record. And everyone would be, well, this one, this is the part of the show that I’m going to play the whole theme. And it’s the words of Steve Jobs. And he said these words back in 2005. And there’s so much resonance to your journey, because I can just see how it’s led to this point. Not that this is the pinnacle of your career by any stretch of the imagination. But you have connected your dots, you’ve done things in a certain way. This is Steve Jobs.\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nOf course, it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college, but it was very, very clear looking backwards. 10 years later. Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever, because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart Even Wouldn’t lead you off the well worn path? And that will make all the difference.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nWell, you certainly went off the well worn path and you’ve got competence in your heart but it was the right thing to do. So do those words mean anything to you?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nOh, definitely.\n\nYeah, I mean, if I think back and\n\nthink about how all my you know, dots joined up if you know if I was to go back in time to talk to my younger self. Yeah, certainly just keep keep the persistence up. When you find something that you love to do. One thing I’d probably tell myself is not overanalyze everything.\n\nBecause sometimes I do that.\n\nAnd I think I feel ultimately I made you know, some very good decisions and the decisions along the way, you know, that they were the right decision at the time. Sometimes I made a right decision that didn’t turn out, right. And that’s okay too.\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nAnd so\n\nDavid Ralph\n\ndid you. Do you have a big day in your life that you look back on? And you go, yeah, that that’s actually when it all started coming together for me.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nI would say when I started doing the volunteer work with the Heart Association, so I had no idea that that I could make a living doing that yet. But I was passionate about rope jumping. And I wanted to share what I had learned with other people. And I think that was a huge dot along the way, and also, once I started on that path, to find to seek out those other people that may help me look at things from a different angle, the rhythmic gymnast that I hung out with the martial arts people\n\nI started\n\nI had a dance choreographer come and take a look at what I was doing to see if there was some advice that they would have for me. And another thing I would tell my younger self is to dance more. I think when I was in college and I would watch people dancing, I would say to myself, you know, it just looks so phoney to me, I don’t get it. And I started jumping rope. And then I wanted to get better at rope jumping and so I started taking dance classes and just you know, found that it’s just such a wonderful thing to do and and a way to express yourself. And so that’d be something that I would definitely you know, to dance earlier in life. Probably tell myself to shave my head earlier to I was holding on to the The last scraps of what was left of my hair for a while and and, you know, just to kind of let it go earlier, let the kids while I was doing shows at schools and the children were sending me fan mail as they do from time to time. And when the pictures that they were sending started to look like Larry from The Three Stooges. That was the point when I said, you know, it’s time to shave with what’s left of my hair.\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nAnd\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nbe brave and authentic to yourself. That’s what you’re saying.\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nExactly. And\n\nask, you know, what’s the worst that could happen? You try something and fail and and you learn from that and you keep going and you persevere.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nAbsolutely. But normally, I send you back in time to have a one on one with your younger self. But we’re not going to do that today because I think you’ve given us enough glimpses into what you would say if you did go back in time, so I’m going to leave you with the very last question and is do you think everyone out there all the listeners, all the people on the buses on the trains on the cubicles? Do you think that they can have a kick ass life, David?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nAbsolutely. And it’s never too late. You know, no matter what age you are certainly maybe easier to try some entrepreneur entrepreneurial venture when you’re younger. But, you know, it’s never too late. People ask me all the time. What are you going to do if you can’t jump rope anymore? What do you do if you’re going to get hurt? And so, you know, I think about those things and think about, you know, what I would like to do so, children’s singer songwriter seems like a great gig to me. So I’m working on that and, you know, pursuing other passions without giving up you know, My rope jumping career at the moment. Just thinking ahead and that there’s your it’s never too late to try something new and to find another passion.\n\nDavid Ralph\n\nAbsolutely. And that’s a perfect segue funnily enough to tomorrow’s episode. And we’ve got a gentleman whose tagline is it’s never too late. Doesn’t matter what age you are, you can make it go away if you’ve got the passion for it. Well, David, how can our audience connect with you, sir?\n\nDavid Fisher, The Rope Warrior\n\nOh, great. They could check out my website, which is rope warrior.com. I would say though, if they’re in a different country and they wanted to purchase one of my books, the best way to do that on Amazon, the new book is called cool jump rope tricks you can do but there’s lots of fun stuff on my website. They can listen to my music. I’ve just got a new review that came in that said described me as a master wordsmith and player words and with the songs have a wonderfully wicked sense of humour. So they can listen to some of the music on there. They can ask questions, they can learn tricks. Or if they want to just email me directly it’s rope warrior at. net. And I do have a Twitter account. I haven’t done that too often, but it’s David Fisher at rope warrior I believe.
