        "text": "1.\n\nRoad Scholar 03:49\n\nStanding at the Balkan border Is that Friday night with Trevor Eve? No, it's just where I am right now Trying to keep the faith, trying to believe Here there mister, hey there sister Can you spare this rambler a little ride? I ain't got no change for you Just a story and a little smile Chorus: And I ain't talkin' 'bout Cecil Cos I'm not much of an empire man I get my education By going from nation to each nation Hitch my way from town to town Without much of a route or plan Cos I'm a road scholar I'm a road scholar Four of us in the back of a van With a crazy-driving Kosovan man We wind our way through the lonesome valley Like he thinks he's in the Dakar rally But we make it safe and sound And then we breathe a sigh as we reach the end Bid farewell to the man who helped us As we disappear around the bend (Chorus) And a shout out to the American man Who sowed the seeds for this whole song With tales from the Pamir Highway Where he never had to wait too long (Chorus x2)\n\n2.\n\nPeople Say 03:00\n\nPeople say to make your house a home Plant your roots in the earth And stay 'til you're old People say to make your house a home But I don't see things this way Not even when these people say I want to travel the world And that can be my home People say to get a nine-to-five Get something for yourself That's the goal People say to get a nine-to-five But I don't see things this way Not even when these people say I want to play in the streets And see the smiles on the faces People say success is weighed in gold And the strivers will work Every hour they're told People say success is weighed in gold But I don't see things this way Not even when these people say A wise man once said Success is doing what you love People say you have to settle down Take yourself off the shelf And stop shopping around People say you have to settle down But I don't see things this way Not even when these people say I'm not looking for love But if I find it then that's OK I'm not looking for love But if I find it then that's OK\n\n3.\n\nThis world is beautiful Towering mountains, endless trees Flying high above this wilderness And I think of all the things That make me happy to be here today Is it all the more incredible If it happened by chance? Chorus: I do believe it's true Yes I do believe it's true I do believe that it's true And in the name of progress We bring it to its knees Are we happier today than ever before? Or is it best not to ask where this will lead us? Is it all the more incredible That we take all this for granted? (Chorus) In a world where everything has its price We forget about everything we value Happiness set aside for a life That's rich in wealth But poor in all its meaning Is it all the more incredible That we all play this game (Chorus) Is it god or is it fame? Can I find someone else to blame? Like a dog chasing cars That he will never claim And it's all the more incredible But I can't give the answers (Chorus x2)\n\n4.\n\nWell I've been going from town to town For a year and a month, give or take a week or two And I want to see the world But my mind keeps telling me to come back to you Chorus: It doesn't matter where I go My thoughts go back to the girl from the mountain town It doesn't matter where I go My thoughts go back to the girl from the mountain town I remember when we first made love On the hillside watching the sun rise over the town We talked of travelling the world With our voices and music taking us around (Chorus) We busked around old London town And on the streets of Swedish winter snow Then I left for cities new But there's no one here who I feel like you I know (Chorus) I know that she won't wait for me Like a bird she'll fly away any day you see We are cut from the very same cloth But the reasons we fit are the reasons we're not to be (Chorus x2)\n\n5.\n\nEven when I'm alone in paradise I'd still rather be with you In a dark and dingy flat in London Just singing all our tunes I thought that this would never happen That I'd steer clear of all of that But I guess you never know when you'll fall in love It can be at the drop of a hat Come join me on the road We'll watch the sun go down over the sea Come join me on the road There'll be no others Just you and me You say scenarios of leaving Keep on rushing through your head But I hope that when you leave it'll be with me And not for words I haven't said We'll drive out to the end of the world Sleep together in a bombed out car But as long as I'm with you, it doesn't matter If we don't get that far Come join me on the road We'll watch the sun go down over the sea Come join me on the road There'll be no others Just you and me Come join me on the road We'll lie together under the stars Come join me on the road We'll get drunk in all the crazy bars Somebody said to me don't turn your back on something That you might regret Sometimes in life you get a feeling That a chance is the only one you'll get I know I've asked a lot of you I've not given too much in return But I hope that every day I live That you can help me learn Come join me on the road We'll watch the sun go down over the sea Come join me on the road There'll be no others Just you and me Come join me on the road We'll lie together under the stars Come join me on the road We'll get drunk in all the crazy bars Come join me on the road Come join me on the road Come join me on the road Come join me on the road\n\n6.\n\nLiving the Dream 03:22\n\nI would have called time on my rambling ways Called time on my roving days For you I'd give up this nomadic life And settle me down, find a place But the last thing I thought that I'd find you to say Is what I have heard to be true I'd give you the earth and all of my love But I cannot give you the moon Chorus: So I'll go once again on my travels To a place that I've never been Not to find me a wife or to find myself But to feel like I'm living the dream Your beauty remains and your charm hasn't gone Your smile it still lights up the room But our future was based on a fantasy dream That both of us fell for too soon When we're out on the road without home or abode Everything seemed to be fine But it's a far cry from the romance of living so free To the humdrum of day-to-day grind (Chorus) So I wish you the best, all the luck I can give And I know you'll make waves in this world And know that I'll always remember you well You're always the mountain town girl And know that I'll always remember you well You're always the mountain town girl\n\n7.\n\nThe Lofoten Islands 03:58\n\nWell I took a train from the west overnight Going past the woodlands The mist rising up from the lake Like ghostly figures in the night The sun never goes down in these parts It hangs in the air And the glassy marble water Floats slowly by On my way to the Lofoten Islands Caught the boat from Bodo Up to the mountains and the islands It was there that I met young Saga Out on the deck I stayed with her way past my stop And we headed for Vaeroy To sit by the bonfire Under the midnight sun We spent the night together And said that it was meant to be We were drunk on the magic and beauty of the night As the sea crashed o'er the rocks Of the Lofoten Islands Saga and I parted ways She would stay and I would leave And though we'd never see each other again We knew that it was perfect I packed my bags and headed for the north Camped out by a peaceful lake Where the only noise was the birds up in the sky Hitched up to Haukland Bay Along winding roads by the coast While the snow-capped peaks remind you It's an arctic summer On the Lofoten Islands On the Lofoten Islands On the Lofoten Islands\n\n8.\n\nRose of Turaida 04:04\n\nThe troops they came to raze the town in the year 1601 Among the dead a fellow found a lonely little one He took her in and brought her up as if she were one of his own All in the town her beauty it would mark her out alone Chorus: This is the ballad of poor Maija She was the Rose of Turaida This is the ballad of poor Maija She was the Rose of Turaida Victor was a gardener, he worked all in the grounds At night they'd meet in secret, away from the city sounds He promised her that they would wed but little did he know That another man named Adam had his eyes on pretty Rose (Chorus) Adam asked the question and young Maija did refuse She told him of the gardener to whom this man would lose So Adam penned a letter in the gardener's own hand And lured her from her safety to a hollow in the land (Chorus) When Maija found that she was tricked she promised her own mind She would rather die than break her vow, she would leave her love behind A silk red scarf she placed upon and to Adam she did say If you cut me now this scarf will mean I'll live another day (Chorus) Adam was a foolish man and believed in Maija's tale He struck her dead and fled the cave for he knew he did face jail Victor found the body and was blamed for the maiden's death At the trial they said that it was he who heard her final breath (Chorus) But a friend of Adam testified and brought his oath to bear So our villain was convicted and the noose was his to wear The gardener lived a quiet life as he pined for his only Rose And envied Adam deep in the ground for he didn't share these woes (Chorus x2)\n\n9.\n\nThe Bauhaus 03:26\n\nChorus: I'll sit outside the Bauhaus drinking ale all through the night Telling stories that no one understands With my rocks in my pocket And my wise and foolish words I'll tell your fortune if you just give me your hand With my rocks in my pocket And my wise and foolish words I'll tell your fortune if you just give me your hand You think that I know you And I've looked into your soul But the truth is that I'll say the same tomorrow To another young disciple Of this mystical and mythical Invention of a prophet whom you follow To another young disciple Of this mystical and mythical Invention of a prophet whom you follow (Chorus) I see the same scenes every night Boy meets girl and girl meets boy Boy passes out because he'e been here seven hours I'm not part of this charade Too old to play these parlour games If you need me I'll be claiming mystic powers I'm not part of this charade Too old to play these parlour games If you need me I'll be claiming mystic powers (Chorus x2)\n\n10.\n\nDance in the Rain 02:44"
