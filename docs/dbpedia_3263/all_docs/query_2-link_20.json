        "text": "David Fisher has been successfully leading business transformation programs in both the public and private sectors for more than 20 years. Currently he leads the Guidehouse Risk Consulting Practice, with a particular focus on assisting Federal agencies to design, implement, and fully operationalize Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) programs. As the former Chief Risk Officer at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) who stood up the organization’s first ERM program, David recognizes that ERM solutions require cultural adaptation around the mindsets and behaviors that are essential to enabling enterprise-wide risk transparency, along with the mechanisms that must be established to enable efficient and effective identification and management of the organization’s highest priority portfolio of risks.\n\nDavid spent nearly ten years as a senior executive in the Federal government, leading transformation efforts across at the Department of Defense (DoD), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and the IRS. At DoD, he served as the first permanent Director of the newly established Business Transformation Agency (BTA), leading the effort to enhance business operations across the vast DoD enterprise. At GAO, he served as the Chief Administrative Officer / Chief Financial Officer, where he was responsible for all internal operations."
