        "text": "For decades, David has dreamt of owning and operating a guest lodge, a far cry from his career spanning 20 years as an employee benefits insurance specialist based in Fort Worth, Texas. So in 2019, the Fishers, along with their children Jack and Ella, began a cross-country search for David’s dream that ultimately brought them to Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and Sky Valley Chateau.\n\nWhat began as a family-owned, vacation-rental home, Sky Valley Chateau has since become a premiere destination for hosting large groups of friends and families year-round in Steamboat Springs. Seated at the base of Rabbit Ears Pass and high above the Yampa Valley, this three-story mountain lodge is made of heavy timber and moss rock and features 10 bedrooms and baths, a half-bathroom, a great room, a wet bar, a 16-person hot tub, and two levels of 2,400-square-foot turf overlooking a spacious backyard.\n\nSince their arrival at Sky Valley Chateau, the Fishers — along with their lovable Boxer Seve, and their Sheepadoodle Palmer — have begun adding new pages to their family story and invite you to add a few pages to your own.\n\nTypically, David and Erica are available to greet you and give a quick tour of the property, though the house is equipped with two keyless entry pads should you prefer to let yourself in. While they’ll give you all the privacy you desire from your mountain retreat, they are always just a phone call away should there be anything you need. They ensure the lodge is professionally cleaned between stays: that all linens are cleaned and pressed and that shampoos, soaps, paper products, towels, and linens are restocked, providing you with all the comforts of a luxury hotel. Please note that housekeeping services are not available during your stay."
