        "text": "Introduction\n\nIt may sound absurd to state that the study of religion, when taken distinctively from the philosophy of religion and theology, is not really concerned with the religious truth expressed by the religion studied. The study of religion is not aimed at “deciding whether there is a God or not, or whether key religious figures are really prophets, avatars or messiahs” (Chryssides and Geaves 2007: p.211). The duty of the phenomenologist of religion is to listen to practitioners who make such claims but methodologically sit on the fence adopting agnostic neutrality position.\n\nThe issue of methodological approach in the study of religion has remained an enigma to many scholars of science of religion (religionswissenshaft) for many centuries. This led to the formulation of many methods such as historical, philosophical, psychological, sociological, and phenomenological and the rest in the bid to solving this problem. This paper therefore looks at one of these methods known as phenomenological approach to the study of religion to ascertain the origin and development of the method and its application.\n\nPhenomenological study of religion deals with a personal participation of a scholar in the religion he seeks to study in order to understand the essence (meaning) and manifestations of the religious phenomena of the particular religion. This he does through the grouping of the phenomena, the suspension of value judgment, which was previously held about that religion, and the taking of a neutral stance in order to understand what he is studying.\n\nVarious study approaches have been recommended by scholars on the scientific study of religion (religionswissenschaft). Some of these approaches include the sociological, the phenomenological, the philosophical, the psychological, the historical and others. The issue of methodological approach in the study of religion has remained a thorny issue since no two methods are the same and no two scholars can approach the study from exactly the same viewpoint even when they are using the same method.\n\nSmart (1973) in his The Science of Religion and the Sociology of Knowledge: Some Methodological Questions, has advocated a method he calls the “polymethodic approach” (p.9). He argues that this method is necessary because different disciplines are integrated.\n\nMacquarrie (1997) on the other hand, has attributed various theories and methods of studying religion to the multiplicity of authors and definitions of religion. In his words “almost as many definitions and theories of religion exist as there are authors on subject” (p.1) He therefore presents three approaches which he says are generally taken by scholars in the study of religion namely “the historical, the phenomenological, and the behavioral or social-scientific”(p.1).\n\nThis work takes a cursory look at the phenomenological approach to the study of religion, which some scholars believe is arguably the most influential approach to the study of religion in the twentieth century but has come under a cloud of heavy criticism in the twenty first century. It examines the historical development of phenomenological method from its earliest exponents and considers the main distinctive features of this method and finally concludes with a critique of the method.\n\nThe Origin and Development of Phenomenology and Phenomenology of Religion as a Field of Study.\n\nThe phenomenology of religion as a method of research in religious studies has its roots in the “phenomenological movement.” (Young 2002: p. 17). Young (2002) further explains that the latter began in nineteenth-century Germany and Austria and extended through the first half of the twentieth century with the “philosophical thought of Franz Brentano, Carl Stumpf, Edmund Husserl, Alexander Pfänder, Adolf Reinach, Moritz Geiger, Max Scheler, Martin Heidegger, and Nicolai Hartmann. It also spread to France, inspiring Gabriel Marcel, Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Paul Ricoeu” (p.18).\n\nIn this work on the phenomenological approach to the study of religion, we will first trace the origin and development of the term “Phenomenology”, before narrating the origin of phenomenology of religion\n\nThe term “phenomenology” was first coined by the Swiss-German mathematician and philosopher Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1764 from two Greek words whose combined meaning was “the setting forth or articulation of what shows itself”. He used this term in his reference to “illusory nature of human experience in an attempt to develop a theory of knowledge that distinguished truth from error (Moreau, 2001: p. 248). This view of Lambert was written in the Part 4 of his Neues Organon published in 1764 wherein he calls it the “doctrine of appearances” (Lehmann, 1975: p.1226).\n\nImmanuel Kant, who was a contemporary of Lambert, also used the term twice wherein he laid the foundation for its development “when he distinguished things as they appear to us (which he called phenomena) from things as they really are (which he called noumena)” (Moreau, 2001: p. 249). Kant proposed that it is not possible to have a true and genuine knowledge of the transcendent (noumena) as a science but in the immanent (or phenomena) it is possible since this is a description of the structures of human experience. He therefore proposed phenomenology as an appropriate field of philosophical and scientific inquiry.\n\n1900s witnessed a series of publication and studies on phenomenology during which time a German group showed their insight into phenomenology. One of such great thinkers was the Austrian-born Philosopher Edmund Husserl, who “sought to give philosophical foundations to a generally intuitive non-empirical approach of phenomenological methodology” (Moreau, 2001: 250).\n\nOne major factor that led Husserl into the formulation of his view on phenomenology was the reigning idea at that time that “science alone is the ultimate court of appeal” (Ekeke, 2006: p. 55). This means that scientific method has seen itself as the only method of achieving the truth and falsity of any issue. He was therefore reacting against the scientific methodology, which demands that life experiences be thrown to the mud for objective empiricism. Husserl counters this view by saying that life experiences should be recognized, rather than being hindrance, could be used as a means through which reality could be explored.\n\nLehmann (1975) in describing Edmund Husserl’s phenomenology explains that it deals mainly with “the correlation between knowledge and knowledge of objects” as its basic theme.\n\nHusserl explains that phenomenology analyses the idea of “intentionality” and ‘material content’ systematically as various modifications of intentionality such as love, hatred etc, and also examines the various modes of presence of the object as intended in each act (Lehmann, 1975: p. 1226). Husserl as early as 1894 rejected “the modern reductive interpretation of intuition of reception of sensory data, and firmly asserts that our intuitive consciousness reaches out beyond sensory affections and grasps the intended object itself” (Qtd in Cobb-Stevens, 1991: p. 10).\n\nWriting in his work “Psychological Studies in the Elements of Logic”, Husserl (1977) explains “…an intuition is a ‘setting before’ in an authentic sense, where the object is actually put before us in such a manner that the object is itself the topic of philosophical activity” (p.304). Husserl’s influence in this area was phenomenal as the term now refers not only to a descriptive methodology but also to the movement of phenomenological philosophy.\n\nDue to Husserl’s influence, phenomenology came to refer to a method which is more complex and claims rather more for itself than did Chantepie’s mere cataloguing of facts. Husserl argued that the foundation of knowledge is consciousness. He recognized how easy it is for prior beliefs and interpretations to unconsciously influence one’s thinking.\n\nHusserl’s phenomenological method therefore sought to shelve all these presuppositions and interpretations. He introduced the word “eidetic vision” to the field of phenomenology in order to describe the ability to observe without prior beliefs and interpretations influencing understanding and perceptions (Wikipedia, the free Encyclopedia, 2007a:1).\n\nHusserl’s other contribution to the field of phenomenology is the idea of the “epoche” which has to do with setting aside metaphysical questions and observing phenomena in and of themselves. In this conceptual contribution Husserl sought to place philosophy on a descriptive and scientific basis.\n\nHe introduced fundamental principles of phenomenological study, which Van der Leeuw used extensively in the phenomenology of religion. These are epoche- the suspension of value judgments, and the adoption of a neutral stance.\n\nAnother principle, which Husserl introduced, is the principle of “eidetic” vision. The word eidetic is from a Greek eidos which means “that which is seen”, thus form, shape, essence. Smart (1979) explains that eidetic vision is the capacity to grasp the essence of religious phenomena by means of empathy and intuition.\n\nThis empathy, he further explains, is “a kind of warm distances”. To him the focus is on “seeing what the believer sees-trying to enter the thought-world of … [religion], but not necessarily with any endorsement (or criticism)” (Smart, 1979: 8). From the above description, it can be seen that Husserl played a vital role in the development of phenomenology. It was his principles that later scholars of phenomenology of religion like Gerardus Van der Leeuw developed.\n\nOther philosophers who applied this method to their study include, Martin Heidegger, Jean Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Karl Jasper, Marvin Faber and Paul Ricoeur. It should be noted here that they were not all uniform in their thinking.\n\nAnother Scholar who played active role in the development of phenomenology as a methodology in research is Alfred Schutz. Born at the close of the 19th century (1899) when phenomenology as a research method was gathering momentum, he grew up and was taught by eminent scholars in the University of Vienna Austria. When he came in contact with Edmund Husserl’s work on phenomenology, Okon (1998) explains that it became the “solid foundation for interpretive sociology”.\n\nBased on Husserl’s work, Schutz gave his study a phenomenological grounding (p.147). Alfred Schutz used phenomenological method in solving sociological issues. He saw social actions as “…action, which is oriented toward the past, present, or future behaviour of another person or persons” (qtd in Okon, 1998: 149).\n\nIn his quest for meaning Schutz created the term “the stream of consciousness” saying that “here and here only, the deepest stratum of experience that is accessible to reflection is to be found the ultimate source of the phenomena of meaning (Sinn) and understanding (Verstehen)” (qtd in Okon 149).\n\nHaving briefly given the origin and development of the term phenomenology, we proceed to look at the origin of the phrase “phenomenology of religion”.\n\nEIDETIC VISION\n\nPhenomenologists of religion, much like Husserl, feature the need to develop a ‘feeling for’ the religious people under scrutiny.\n\nThe word eidetic stems from the Greek ‘eidos’ which means “that which is seen”. That is the shape, form or essence. The word eidos was adopted by Husserl from its platonic designation to mean “universal essences”. These essences describe the nature or ‘whatness’ of something or in other words the features of something that makes it recognizable. According to Ninian Smart, in an attempt to grasp the essence of religious phenomena, one must be empathetic and intuitive. According to him, the prime focus is on seeing what the believer sees, trying to enter into the religious realms but not necessarily with endorsement.\n\nThere is also the eidetic intuition which according to Van Del Leeuw means interpolating the phenomena into the life of the student. With this, the student must get familiar and understand the religion from personal experiences. It implies that, as a scholar, it is necessary to have first-hand information from personal experiences other than being a scholar who sits in the library to compile notes. Thus, the student or researcher must be part of the religious activities I.e., “entering into the\n\nreligion” and this is the empathetic interpolation. Entering into the religion means the student take part in all religious activities with proper and focused observation (participant observation). Taking part in the religious activities does not mean ‘conversion’ into the religion and that is where there is ‘empathic neutrality’ steps in.\n\nIn other words, going into the religion involves understanding the feelings of the practitioners but not to share the feelings or get converted to the religion. Putting eidetic vision into use means having upper hand on firsthand information since dependency on secondary sources can be detrimental and might be exaggerated or subjective. It is also important to note that eidetic vision and the principle of epoche go hand in hand and therefore, as one put to use the eidetic vision, epoche should be available and at work.\n\nPhenomenology of Religion\n\nThe word phenomenology was coined out from the word phenomenon which is defined as “a fact or event considered very unusual, curious or astonishing by those who witness it.\n\nReligion:- A particular system of faith and worship\n\nThe phenomenology of religion concerns the experimental aspect of religion, describing religious phenomena in terms consistent with the orientation of worshippers. It views religion as made up of different components, and studies these components across religious traditions in order to gain some understanding of them. A careful study of the origin of the word “Phenomenology” reveals that its first proponents were not people in the field of religion. They did not actually use the method in studying any particular religion; they were scholars who were mostly in the field of philosophy. We shall therefore trace the origin of the phrase in religious terminology.\n\nThe phenomenology of religion according to Wikipedia, the free Encyclopedia (2007b) “concerns the experimental aspect of religion, describing religious phenomena in terms consistent with the orientation of the worshippers” (p.1). Phenomenological approach to the study of religion views religion as being made up of different components and these components are carefully studied in various religious traditions in order to gain understanding of them. This approach owes its origin and conceptual development, to a large extent to the following scholars namely: Pierre Daniel Chantepie de la Saussaye, William Brede Kristensen and Gerardus Van der Leeuw. These are the leading theorists in Phenomenology of religion but we will consider two of them.\n\n Pierre Daniel Chantepie de la Saussaye\n\nIn his work Lehrbuch der Religionsgeschichte translated as Handbook of the History of Religion, Chantepie de la Saussaye coined the phrase “phenomenology of the religion” in 1887. Here marks the origin of the phrase in religious terminology. Van der Leeuw (1956) explains that Chantepie de La Saussaye gave the “outline of the phenomenology” in his work.\n\nThe work deals with two major areas namely essence and manifestation of religious phenomena. James (1995) explains that de la Saussaye’s phenomenology of religion is neither the history of religion nor the philosophy of religion (p.45). He further explains that the task Chantepie set to achieve in his phenomenology of religion is to prepare historical data through which philosophical analysis could be done. This could be done through “a collection, a grouping, an arrangement, and a classifying of the principal groups of religious conceptions” (p.43).\n\nOne can deduce from the above that de la Saussaye’s phenomenology of religion concerns the grouping of various religious phenomena from various traditions in order to discover the essence of religion, which is the meaning the religious practitioners deduce from their religion and the manifestations the worshippers experience. De la Saussaye’s phenomenology has been declared by many as the founder of this discipline and approach to the study of religion called phenomenology of religion.\n\n Gerardus Van Der Leeuw\n\nAs phenomenological approach to the study of religion develops, Gerardus Van der Leeuw was another person who gave it a wider meaning in his Phanomenologie der Religion published in 1933. He follows Kristensen in many respects. Van der Leeuw (1956) sees understanding as a subjective aspect of phenomena, which is inherently intertwined with the objectivity of that which is manifest.\n\nExplaining his view in the second edition of his book published in 1956, Van der Leeuw correlates subjective experience, expression, and understanding with three objective levels of appearing-relative concealment, relative transparency and gradually becoming concealed or manifest-wherein the understanding of what is becoming revealed is the primordial level of appearing from which the experienced concealment and expressed transparency of appearing are derived (p.769).\n\nWriting about Van der Leeuw, Waardenburg (1978) explains that his phenomenology of religion is based on three fundamental divisions namely: God-Man-Relation between God and man. In his words “the relation between God and Man, which was a central issue in the whole of Van der Leeuw’s, thinking, is inevitably the basis of his phenomenological work” (p.222).\n\nHis phenomenology of religion centers on or is aimed “primarily … with understanding’, and this understanding of religion was for him part of a general attitude of understanding towards reality” (Waardenburg, 1978: p. 224). To Van der Leeuw, rather than explanation, understanding should be the aim and purpose of the study of religion.\n\nThe business of phenomenology of religion is mainly to interpret the various ways in which the sacred appears to human beings in the world, the ways in which humans understand and care for that which is revealed to them, for that which is ultimately wholly other mystery.\n\nIt can be deduced from its first proponents that the aim of phenomenology of religion is to understand the meaning or essence of religion and interpreting the various manifestations of the sacred as revealed to man.\n\nApplication of Phenomenological Method to the Study of Religion\n\nHaving examined the three first proponents of phenomenology of religion and what phenomenology of religion seeks to achieve, we go further to look at how this method can be applied in the academic study of religion.\n\nWe shall concentrate here on Gerardus Van der Leeuw (1963) and his view on phenomenology of religion in his Religion in essence and manifestation: A study in phenomenology of religion. He presents six (6) important stages through which a scholar who uses phenomenological approach to the study of religion should follow in applying the method.\n\nFirstly, he argues that the student of religion needs to classify the religious phenomena into distinct categories such as sacrifice, sacrament, sacred space, sacred time, sacred word, festivals and myths. In this way the scholar will be able to understand the value of each of these phenomena to religious experience.\n\nSecondly, scholars then need to interpolate the phenomena into their own lives. This means that they have to understand the religion from personal experience. Van der Leeuw (1963) by this, demands that every scholar of religion should not be an armchair scholar who does not participate in the religion he sets to study. He therefore explains that the life examined by the scholar of religious studies needs to acquire its place in the life of the student himself who should understand it out of his own inner self.\n\nThirdly, Van der Leeuw borrowing from Husserl’s fundamental principles of phenomenology, which are epoche- the suspension of value judgments, the adoption of a neutral stance and eidetic vision, explains that these principles are necessary for any scholar in phenomenology of religion who wants or wishes to produce data that will be acceptable.\n\nFourthly, scholars need to clarify any structural relationships and make sense of the information so gathered. This will enable them move towards a holistic understanding of how the various aspects of a religion relate and function together.\n\nIn the fifth stage, Van der Leeuw (1963) explains that this procedure naturally leads to a storage at which all these activities undertaken together and simultaneously constitute genuine understanding: the chaotic and obstinate ‘reality’ thus becomes a manifestation, a revelation.\n\nSixthly the phenomenologist should not operate in isolation but his research must agree with researches of other disciplines, such as archaeology, History, philosophy and others. This method according to Van der Leeuw will help the phenomenologist to maintain a scholarly objectivity. Facts must be what phenomenology should feed on so that it will not degenerate into fantasy. When these six stages are carefully followed, the phenomenological scholar will be very close to understand the meaning or essence of any religious phenomenon studied and will also be in a better position to relate his learning to others.\n\nDistinctive Features of Phenomenology of Religion\n\nWaardenburg (1978) sees phenomenology of religion as a movement of thought and as a movement of research. In his words,\n\nAs a movement of thought, phenomenology tries to come to an understanding of man within a philosophical anthropology. As a movement of research, phenomenology tries to classify specific sets of phenomena including religious phenomenon in such a way that it does justice to their expressed meanings… A meaning is an explicit or implicit connection, which is made between different phenomena, thus assembling them into meaningful, structures (p.91–92).\n\nHaving this view as expressed by Waardenburg in mind we shall proceed to present the various distinctive features of phenomenological approach to the study of religion.\n\nMoreau (2001) has expressed various ideas which we will like to adopt in this paper on phenomenology of religion.\n\n· The first is that phenomenology of religion is descriptively oriented. This means that evaluative judgments are not their concern but they seek “accurate and appropriate descriptions and interpretations of religious phenomena” (Moreau 2001). These include rituals, symbols, prayers, ceremonies, theology (written or oral), sacred persons, art, creeds and other religious exercises, whether corporate or private.\n\n· Another feature of phenomenology of religion is that it does not have as a goal to explain the phenomena it describes. The phenomenologist condemns the idea of trying to discover universal laws, which can be used to predict future behavior. Their desire is not to find an explanation for a problem but to achieve an adequate understanding of the very problems.\n\n· The third feature of phenomenological study of religion is comparative in a limited sense. Since phenomenology emphasizes the importance of data, it becomes relevant that the more data incorporated into the work the more potential significance the study will be (Moreau 2001). Though meaning may best be found in data by using comparative methods, yet the phenomenologist does not seek to list or describe similar practice across adverse religious traditions for the purpose of rating them from best to worst.\n\n· Fourthly, the phenomenologist of religion avoids reductionism. Reductionism is a method whereby scholars try to reduce and even trivialize religious phenomena to purely sociological, psychological, anthropological, economic, or environmental terms. Such reductions according to Moreau (2001) “ignore the complexity of the human experience, impose social values on transcendental issues, and ignore the unique intentionality of the religious participant. Phenomenologists do not seek a bird’s eye view but …a worm’s eye view” (p. 225).\n\n· The fifth distinctive feature of phenomenology of religion is that it suspends questions of truth for the sake of developing insights into the essence of religious experience. The phenomenologist of religion is a participant observer whose aim is to develop a genuine empathic understanding of the experiences of the worshippers and so gain first hand information. They do not “follow the metaphor of the detached, scientific observer. A more appropriate metaphor is that of an actor, who requires an intimate empathic knowledge of the part being portrayed, for a successful production” (Moreau 2001: p. 256).\n\n· Another distinctive feature is the development of insight into the essential structures and meanings of religious experience. This is regarded as the ultimate goal of phenomenology of religion. It opposes the acceptance of unobservable matters and grand systems erected in speculative thinking. This means that it goes beyond the sphere of philosophy to reality and actuality.\n\nIt opposes naturalism popularly called objectivism and positivism, which is the worldview growing from modern natural science and technology that has been spreading from Northern Europe since the age of learning referred to as Renaissance. Phenomenologist justify cognition, evaluation, and action, which is awareness of a matter itself as disclosed in the most clear, distinct, and adequate way for something of its kind. They also tend to believe that not only objects in the natural and cultural worlds, but also ideal objects, such as numbers and even conscious life itself can be made evident and thus known.\n\n· Finally, phenomenologist recognize the role of descriptions in universal, apriori, or “eidetic” that is revelation terms as prior to explanation by means of causes, purposes, or grounds.\n\nThe above features distinctly show that phenomenology of religion is a discipline which can help students of religious studies understand the particular religion he/she seeks to study.\n\nA Critique of Phenomenology of Religion\n\nIt must be noted that irrespective of how influential and reasonable this method of study is, there are several areas in which it faces difficult questions as it tries to understand the essence of religious experience and manifestations.\n\nThe first area that deserves questioning is in its descriptive role. Phenomenology of religion’s claims that it is purely descriptive can be seen as almost impossible in the light of human conditions and constrains. Every person including phenomenologist, has what might sometimes be termed hidden agendas driving data, method of analysis, and presentation of findings.\n\nPhenomenologists have been seen in many literatures as crossing the boundary from description to evaluation. From all indications crossing such boundaries is a necessary means of showing what it means to be culturally and historically a part of human being with religious identity. So when phenomenology claims to be purely descriptive methodology is totally unacceptable.\n\nA careful look at religion reveals that it is “an inter-subjective phenomenon” (Chryssides and Geaves 2007: 231). Once one becomes a participant-observer, that one immediately becomes part of the phenomenon studied. It therefore becomes impossible for any scholar of religion to be “detached observers who ‘sit out’ on the performance in the interest of amassing data in some objective, detached way. Indeed, for many students, even being part of the phenomenon, assuming the dual role of researchers and practitioners, is a common scenario” (Chryssides and Geaves 2007: p. 231).\n\nAnother area that phenomenology of religion has come under attack is in the area of trying to look at “religious events as though they were a set of slides rather than a living video rooted in an historical context” (Moreau 2001). Phenomenology tends to be treating phenomena in isolation of history as if history is not necessary in determining how relevant a particular phenomenon is for religious practitioners. Most times phenomenology lacks the ability to contextualize various religious phenomena so studied.\n\nFurthermore, phenomenologist sees vision or revelation as necessary in its intuition. This is problematic in that one cannot be able to determine which eidetic-revelation or vision is regarded as true and acceptable. They also use the terms ‘objectivity’ and ‘intuition’, which is contradictory. When one uses intuitive insights in drawing a data and yet wants to be objective throws the whole process into shamble because if one is to verify an intuitive data, on what grounds will it be based.\n\nAnother most dangerous issue in phenomenology of religion is that it leads to many conversions to the religion the scholar is studying because of his empathy and trying to have the experience of the religion studied. To Christians, for example this full participation in religious practices such as some rituals may be very difficult and so may limit empathy and phenomenological study. This is because a Christian who studies other religion using phenomenological method may find it difficult to immerse him in some rituals of such religion to avoid being defiled.\n\nPhenomenology of religion does not accept positivist’s reductions of religion. This has in most cases reduced religion, “if not to ‘non-religion’ then, at least either to a purely religious experience or to a purely religious idea” (Waardenburg, 1978: p. 128).\n\nIrrespective of these criticisms about this methodological approach to the study of religion it still remains one of the most influential today in the field of academic study of religion.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we have submitted that phenomenology of religion as the approach to the study of religion which considers the essence, that is, the meaning and the manifestations of religious phenomena. It looks at the religious practitioner and the meaning he/she derives from his experience in that religion.\n\nWe have also given a brief historical origin of this approach to the study of religion, which started with the work of Pierre Daniel Chantepie de la Saussaye. This work has also shown the view of Gerardus van der Leeuw in phenomenology of religion. We have examined the way in which phenomenological approach can be applied in the study of religion, which among others include the classification of religious phenomena from various religious traditions.\n\nThe various distinctive features of this method have also been examined. In conclusion, we can say that phenomenological approach is necessary in the study of religions because of its attempt to understand religion in terms of essence and manifestations. Generally speaking, it can be proven that the interpretation of religious data is closely connected with the concept of religion peculiar to the individual scholar.\n\nThis means that the responsibility of the phenomenologist is to analyze and investigate into the concept of religion wherever it occurs. We can therefore agree with Waardenburg (1978) that:\n\nIndeed, phenomenology of religion may testify to a predilection for metaphysical questions and religion as essential reality. It is essentially directed, however, to the human context, the human substance of reality. Behind the intentions, it is with his fellow-beings, both past and present that the student seeks to communicate"
