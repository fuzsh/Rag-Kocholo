        "text": "Introduction\n\nPhenomenology and education both hold a variety of interpretations as well as cultural, political, and practical research perspectives. Thus, paradigmatic distinctions regarding ontological, epistemological, and methodical relevance must be made in order to orient this presentation. First, there is a distinction between phenomenology as a philosophical endeavor performed by philosophers or philosophers of education, and phenomenology as a methodological endeavor performed by professional educators within education, an orientation included in what is called phenomenology of practice. This article orients toward the latter. Second, there is a distinction between education understood as an applied field of study supported by the epistemologies of foundational disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and philosophy and education as a discipline with its own conceptions and theories, based on educational approaches to educational questions. This paper reflects the second understanding, the Continental as opposed to the Anglo-American orientation. Educational research includes formal teaching and schooling and informal teaching, which happens in homes, social institutions, and society. Therefore, educational research requires an anthropological ontoepistemological interest in the meaning of educational events, which orients more toward methodology than method. Methodology requires a reflective attitude that gives rise to methods and that gives research its direction. Educational research aims at maintaining or adding meaning to educational thinking and practice. Therefore, a central goal of the educational researcher is to understand the meaning held within a particular educational situation. Here, the phenomenological orientation toward the lived concrete, situated experience comes into play. A basic concern is how to keep the unspoken, or tacit, qualities of educational situations open to further questioning. This is different from other methods, in which the aim is to solve problems and provide definite answers. The phenomenological approach to educational research presented in this article includes an understanding of research exactly as a reflexive understanding beyond the research activity as such in order to maintain the phenomenological lived quality of the particular educational situation and to acknowledge a personal and cultural remembrance of what it means to be a child and young person. The relation between phenomenology and education requires a responsible remembering of the character of educational situations and an awareness of the logic of educational practices as being self-sustaining and therefore only partly researchable. This understanding of educational research is seen in a variety of phenomenological publications, mainly in the European traditions and approaches. This article will synthesize papers that reflect a multitude of global perspectives but that are united by a Continental understanding of education and phenomenology.\n\nAddressing the Double Focus\n\nEven though epistemological interdisciplinarity can make important contributions to educational research, psychology, philosophy, and other foundational disciplines often do not capture the educational dimensions of educational research, as emphasized in Langeveld 1969. The question as to how educational researchers construct the educational object can, according to Biesta 2011, be understood by looking at whether educational researchers allow the foundational disciplines to feed education theory or whether they start from a particular value-laden interest in the freedom and authority of the child and, as Mollenhauer 1983 addresses, personal morality, relationality, and asymmetry in child–adult relationships. Van Manen and Adams 2010 explains that research is a phenomenological and educational endeavor not separate from life but rather a way of regarding life. Educational theorizing as subjective reflection is aiming at ontoepistemological insight into pedagogical practice and, as Van Manen 1982 stresses, is considered the educational alternative to generalizable epistemological findings. In contemporary educational research this view is argued by politically oriented educationalists, as in Biesta 2011, as well as by hermeneutic phenomenologists, as in Saevi 2011. Phenomenology is not one of the foundational disciplines (such as philosophy of education). Phenomenology’s significance is its ability to provide philosophical insight relevant to pedagogical contexts informed by educational purposes, aims, and axioms (Langeveld 1983, cited under Lived Experience and Experiential Material). Phenomenology is not applied to education as a philosophical understanding but is subject to educational interests, purposes, and moral considerations, from which it cannot be separated. Phenomenological educational publication requires an entwined entity of phenomenology and education. Phenomenology and education are fundamentally connected, and an ontoepistemological understanding of both is required. This quality is recognizable in the publications in this section. Consequently, as Mollenhauer 1983 and Saevi 2011 show, methodology rather than method is at core of this type of research. Phenomenology, as human science, reflects a European sensibility in its orientation toward the personal, cultural, and professional, and as Lippitz 1993 and Van Manen and Adams 2010 suggest, despite the plurality of movements and methodologies, many phenomenological approaches are fundamentally interconnected. Education is understood as a common cultural human effort based on relational asymmetry between adult and child and embedded in cultural, historical, and political ontoepistemological matters that make upbringing and education paradoxical and aporetic, as discussed in Mollenhauer 1983 and Lippitz 1993. The approach to and language used to describe education vary, yet a basic insufficiency is characteristic of approaches to education that focus solely on qualification and socialization. Lippitz 1993 suggests that phenomenology intertwined in culture and education presupposes the interpretation of education as Bildung, the possibility of personal and cultural resistance to and transgression of educational purposes and aims. Education as moral purpose, aim, and content and the asymmetric relationship between adult and child as are the focus of Saevi 2011 as well as the inevitable interpretation of life and practice and the personal responsibility of the adult (Langeveld 1983, cited under Lived Experience and Experiential Material) as substantive of phenomenology in education. Van Manen 1982 demonstrates how theorizing in phenomenological educational research is entwined by necessity in structural experiential reflection and therefore differs from research in which abstract construction of theoretical concepts is an aim in itself.

Discussing educational implications of the two, the paper forms a basis for discerning crucial differences between the traditions for beginning and experienced researchers.

The article provides a contrast to a positivist theorizing. Phenomenological pedagogy is put forth as a reflective theorizing on the grounds that offer the possibility for our pedagogical concerns with children rather than as a method demonstrating new epistemology.
