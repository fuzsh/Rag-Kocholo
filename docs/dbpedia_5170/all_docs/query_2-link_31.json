        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis chapter provides an insight into the origins and traditions of phenomenology as both philosophy and methodology. Emphasis is placed in the earlier parts of the chapter on the delineation between Husserl and Heidegger, the forefathers of the discipline, whose work into epistemology and ontology have fundamentally shaped contemporary qualitative research. Understanding the key concepts of epoché and the implications of the ‘self' within phenomenological research are explicated so that the reader can consider the practicalities of whether it is possible to suspend presupposition and epistemic bias, or whether the ‘self' is something that has simply to be acknowledged as having a fundamental relevance to what and how interpretation is undertaken and how this has a consequent and tangible impact on research findings. The latter part of the chapter gives an insight into interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) as one contemporary approach to the integration of phenomenological research methods.\n\nKey Terms in this Chapter\n\nHermeneutic Circle: The process of understanding a text in relation to the individual parts of it, in relation to its contextual positioning amidst its whole being.\n\nEssence: The essence is the basic nature of a thing and the qualities that define it.\n\nHeidegger: Martin Heidegger was a phenomenologist whose “existentialist” philosophy shaped philosophical thinking which rejected the concept of dualism between mind and body. His work shaped the language of how human consciousness, experience and the mind are understood and articulated.\n\nHermeneutic (s): The methodological and theoretical study of the process of interpretation.\n\nConsciousness: Is an individual’s awareness or perception of something, as a sentient being.\n\nEpistemology: Is the branch of philosophy which deals with ‘ways of knowing’, concerned with the ascertainment of knowledge, its nature, origin and scope and the epistemic justification of it.\n\nNoema: Is an integral part of Husserlian philosophy, indicating the objective aspect of or the content within an intentional experience.\n\nExistentialist Phenomenology: Is the branch of philosophical inquiry which explores the problem of human existence via exploration of the lived experience of individuals and the thoughts, feelings and actions that underpin their existence. The concept of authenticity is central to the process.\n\nEpoché: In Hellenistic philosophy, epoché is the technical term which refers to the suspension of judgment which facilitates the process of setting aside assumptions and beliefs.\n\nHusserl: Edmund Husserl was the German philosopher, who established the earliest work in the discipline of Phenomenology, he is seen as the founding father of systematic logic based on the interrogation of intentionality.\n\nOntology: The branch of metaphysics which considers the concept of existence and the nature of being."
