        "text": "Stumpf’s doctrine of the categories is of great importance for our understanding of his philosophy. This theme had been widely discussed among German thinkers after Kant; Brentano himself had repeatedly dealt with it since his early works. However, Stumpf considerably diverges from Brentano on this crucial philosophical topic. Although a systematic discussion can be found only in Stumpf’s posthumous Erkenntnislehre, his core ideas on the categories can be traced to his early work on space of 1873. In fact, Stumpf claims that the peculiar relationship between extension and color is analogous to the relationship that holds between substance and accidents. Thus, like any other category, substance empirically stems from perception. Sensory experience, for Stumpf, is made up of perceptual wholes, whose attributes are typically bound to each other, rather than separately given in bundles, as Hume and other associationists used to assume. Thus, the achievements of Stumpf’s (and others’) holist psychology effectively contributes a solution to this classic metaphysical problem.\n\nI discuss the three Brentanian theses of intentionality, self-consciousness, and the unity of consciousness. Regarding the first two, I argue that there is a shift in the meaning of consciousness when one passes from the first to the second, and I conclude that the best reading of self-consciousness will be an intransitive one, contrasting with the strong transitive sense of the first thesis. Based on that, I examine whether there is non-conscious psychical acts or states. Disagreeing with Brentano, I present an empirical argument for the establishment of non-conscious psychical acts or states. Based on that, I construe the Brentanian the¬sis of the secondary object, presented by an intentio obliqua, as a process of time-constitution of the ac¬tuality of psychical, conscious life. Finally, I address the issue of the unity of simultaneity of consciousness, presenting it in this new framework. Throughout the paper, especially in the first and last sections, I con¬trast the Aristotelian psyche-soma distinction with the modern mind-body dualism, trying to account for Brentano’s rather complex stance vis-a-vis the one and the other.\n\nAbstract: This essay deals with the relationship between philosophy and ex- perimental sciences in Carl Stumpf’s epistemology. A student of both Brentano and Lotze, Stumpf also gained scientific training with the physicist Wilhelm Weber in Göttingen. His double skill set in the fields of philosophy and ex- perimental sciences made his position within the German thought of his time very unusual. Stumpf’s works range from philosophy and phenomenology to experimental investigations into the field of psychology (especially acoustic and musical phenomena, child psychology, animal psychology, psychology of genius). Moreover, he wrote about mathematics, physical acoustics, phonetics and ethnomusicology. Consistent with his personal inclination towards the ascertainment of factual truths by means of experiments, Stumpf claimed his epistemological writings that philosophy should work hand-in-hand with scientific practice.\n\nPerhaps no philosopher of mind has been subjected to more widely divergent interpretations than Spinoza. He has been described as, among other things, a substance dualist, 1 a materialist, 2 an idealist, 3 and a property dualist. 4 Why so many conflicting interpretations? A partial answer is that Spinoza's philosophy of mind is both difficult and, at crucial junctures, unclear. But this is not the complete answer. Another part of the explanation is that Spinoza's philosophy of mind is strikingly original and thus resists assimilation to the traditional categories of materialism, idealism, and dualism. And yet despite this originality, Spinoza's philosophy of mind purposely retains certain attractive features of each of them in ways that make it easily mistaken for any one of them. Spinoza's thinking about the metaphysics of mind and body must be understood against the background of a philosophical revolution started by Descartes, who arguably introduces into philosophy the mind-body problem as we know it today. Descartes claims that the world divides neatly into two realms: the mental and the physical. These two realms are radically distinct and have nothing in common. By insisting on this radical distinction, Descartes thus purifies the physical realm of colors, sounds, smells and other qualities, which he considers covert mentalistic features—projections of the mind— and thereby paves the way for, or so he hopes, a purely mechanistic physics. By the same token, Descartes also develops a new conception of mind as an essentially thinking thing whose nature can be understood completely independently of the body to which it is connected. But once the world is split into two completely different realms, how can they be brought back together again? How can the body convey sensations to the mind and how can the"
