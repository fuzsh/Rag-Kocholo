But phenomenology probably made its strongest contribution in the field of psychopathology (see also mental disorder), in which the German existentialist Karl Jaspers stressed the importance of phenomenological exploration of a patient’s subjective experience. Jaspers was followed by the Swiss psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger and several others. The phenomenological strand was also very pronounced in American existential psychiatry and affected sociology, history, and the study of religion. More recently, phenomenology has influenced research in some areas of cognitive science.\n\nWalter Biemel"
