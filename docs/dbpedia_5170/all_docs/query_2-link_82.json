        "text": "This article addresses a basic question: what elements in Husserl’s phenomenology can account for the variety of post-Husserlian phenomenologies? The answer, I suggest, is that Husserl’s idea of reality, particularly his notion of givenness vis-à-vis self-givenness, facilitated the work of his followers by offering them at once a firm ground and a point of departure for their inquiries. However, adopting Husserl’s phenomenology as their starting point did not prevent his followers from developing their own independent phenomenological theory. Moreover, despite the elusive particulars that shape one’s individual experience of the world, so it transpires, Husserl’s thinking which was different and beyond their own observations and actual experiences, namely, transcendent, appears to have been a genuine guide along their path to achieve meaning. This interpretation thus gives precedence to a metaphysical point of departure, that is, to Husserl’s idea of reality as ‘givenness’, in launching phenomenological investigation—over any specific aspect of his work—as that which continues to sustain phenomenological discourse. (This article appears in a special issue \"Husserl and other Phenomenologists\" which i edited for The European Legacy: Towards New Paradigms, 21, 5-6, 2016)\n\nThis volume brings together essays by leading phenomenologists and Husserl scholars in which they engage with the legacy of Edmund Husserl’s philosophy. It is a broad anthology addressing many major topics in phenomenology and philosophy in general, including articles on phenomenological method; investigations in anthropology, ethics, and theology; highly specialized research into typically Husserlian topics such as perception, image consciousness, reality, and ideality; as well as investigations into the complex relation between pure phenomenology, phenomenological psychology, and cognitive science.

Held\"\n\nIn this paper I discuss some significant aspects of Husserl's phenomenology which could not be adequately known without studying the manuscripts, unpublished during his lifetime and then published gradually since 1950 by Husserl Archives in Leuven founded by Father van Breda in 1939. The aspects I discuss here are listed under 6 subjects: Husserl's phenomenological analyses of the constituting corporeal subjectivity, Husserl's phenomenological analysis of the conditions of possibility of representifications, concept of I-consciousness, conception of transcendental subjectivity as intersubjectivity, the development of Husserl's conception of phenomenological philosophy, and Husserl's metaphysics. This paper is drawn from, and an extension of, a lecture given at the Catholic University of Louvain in the occasion of 80th anniversary of the foundation of the Husserl Archives.\n\nThis text examines the many transformations in Husserl’s phenomenology that his discoveries of the nature of appearing lead to. It offers a comprehensive look at the Logical Investigations’ delimitation of the phenomenological field, and continues with Husserl’s account of our consciousness of time. This volume examines Husserl’s turn to transcendental idealism and the problems this raises for our recognition of other subjects. It details Husserl’s account of embodiment and examines his theory of the instincts. Drawing from his published and unpublished manuscripts, it outlines his treatment of our mortality and the teleological character of our existence. The result is a genetic account of our selfhood, one that unifies Husserl’s different claims about who and what we are.\n\nHusserl's lifelong interest and vocation was to found an unshakeable basis for sciences and philosophy in general. This motive can be traced back to his Philosophy of Arithmetic and pursued up until his last posthumous book, namely The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. His tireless endeavour culminated in a transcendental phenomenology which he thought it would be the ultimate foundation for the apodictic establishment of sciences and philosophy. Moreover, he thought that it would bring about the promise of the philosophy as a rigorous science which can play the role of a first philosophy with respect to objective sciences. But with the advent of transcendental phenomenology, one of the most stubborn and vital problems becomes the relation of this transcendental phenomenology with the previous so-called psychological phenomenology, which still works within the natural attitude. Husserl himself was aware of the difficulties of a sufficient elucidation of the way one can access the transcendental realm without falling back to the natural attitude. Consequently, he tried many ways of preparing fruitful introductions to transcendental phenomenology. My attempt in this paper is to shed light on his evolutionary attempt to present transcendental reduction in the different stages of his work and finally arrive at an obscurity which does not finally find its proper solution in Husserl's phenomenology. As I assume, this obscurity remains not only within the edifice of Husserl's phenomenology, but continues to influence the further reception of his phenomenology which was vacillating between Husserlian conception of phenomenology and Heideggerian conception."
