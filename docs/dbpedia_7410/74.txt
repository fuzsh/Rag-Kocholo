BeOS is an operating system for personal computers which began development by Be Inc. in 1991. It was first written to run on BeBox hardware and, unlike some other operating systems of the time, BeOS was written from scratch and took therefore advantage of modern hardware. Optimized for digital media work, its GUI was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean, uncluttered design.

History

Description

BeOS made full use of multiprocessor systems by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth, pervasive multithreading, preemptive multitasking and a custom 64-bit journaled file system known as BFS. The API was written in C++ for ease of programming. It has POSIX compatibility and access to a command line interface through the bash shell, although internally it is not a Unix-derived operating system.
