        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe impact of the big five operating systems (OSes) - BSD, Linux, Windows, OS X, and Solaris - on modern computing cannot be overstated. Well over 90% of the world's servers and supercomputers run one of these OSes. Additionally, the big five are at the core of almost all programming and development efforts, which include security, network monitors, availability, routers, and so much more. That the big five OSes are free to use, distribute, modify, and extend, and are built by a disparate, yet tightly bonded group of organizations and individuals, is quite remarkable. As a result, many of the OSes' strengths are derived from their diversity - the different groups working on different code-bases through different processes yield different implementations. Today, proprietary large-scale OSes such as z/OS, OpenVMS, Solaris, and Windows have very few parts left that are not open-source to some extent. Other important proprietary OSes, such as OS X, are based on open-source projects. Unix, the grandfather of all modern OSes, was born as an opinionated but fundamentally open-source operating system. AT&T made source code available and allowed the copyrighted code to be shared by research institutions for a modest fee. In 1974, Unix was rewritten in C - later named Classic Unix - turning it into a widely portable system. From there, versions of Unix were made widely available for universities and were used throughout the world. However, AT&T never released the source code of more advanced versions, while another branch of Unix was then released as the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) for \"free\". Significant progress was made by enhancing the newly free version, which caused it to gain popularity. Over the last fifty years, the Unix execution model has made Unix-like OSes the norm rather than the exception, giving Unix-like OSes an incredible share of the OS marketplace. It is arguable that the operating environment for personal computers is dominated by a sub-type of Unix known as Linux. For effectively the last 40 years, the operating environment for supercomputers and the majority of servers has been Unix-like.\n\n2. Evolution of Operating Systems\n\nEvolutions of Operating Systems The 1950s and 60s witnessed the rise of early operating systems, with the most popular species being the early mainframe operating systems such as Drum Monitor System (DMS), Michigan Terminal System (MTS), Multiprogramming Batch System (MBS), and Master Control Program (MCP). Initially, each OS project was designed and implemented for a particular use case with its own architecture. DMS, in the early 1950s, was Intel's first operating system for the 4-bit 4004 microcontroller. The emergence of UNIX, a TCP/IP stack that joined Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), followed by others such as SunOS (Solaris), HP-UX, AIX, and others from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), led to Linux. The rise of Mac OS and the last, but great, member of this period was Microsoft MS-DOS. The 1980s to 2000s period witnessed several innovations coming from all commercial entities in the fierce competition for the personal computer market. At the start of time-sharing, rudimentary Time Sharing Operating System (TSOS) joined to support basic functionalities for multiple users, such as user mode protection, I/O multiplex, file system, and rudimentary networking. Then, the 1970s started with the success story of UNIX as MSD, the first PS3 operating system, and then Hypervisor. The architectural need for the child operating systems was to be much simpler, offer virtual resources, and be more suited for Portuguese from 5 to 14 years old. During the 1990s, several other versions of parallel and others with mechanisms to manage specific distributed file systems, e.g. Google File System or Hadoop, were designed to support SQL access using HIVE. This era also saw research projects, such as the Networked Windows for Supercomputers (NWS), which allowed Windows NT to delegate remote computations over clusters.\n\n2.1. Historical Overview\n\nMany products and strange partnerships have been created in attempting to achieve dominance in the operating systems markets since 1945. Besides the usual difficulties of investment, standards, and market control policies, every computer manufacturer has decided to rewrite or augment their existing operating system. Despite accelerating processor and disk capacities within the last two decades, many system changes have taken place that affect the role of the operating system and may have altered the nature of processors, processes, data stores, and data transfer. While the importance of these categories has generally evolved, the role of the operating system has generally been amplified. Operating systems have been rapidly evolving since 1945's Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. Distinguishable as five usually licensed systems in 1995. The most recent system was introduced in August 1995, with the next most recent introduced in May 1995. The others became available in late 1992, February 1986, and August 1981. Four other systems, which provided simpler solutions to fewer problems for fewer people, prevail in limited industries or nations. Each dominant system offers a unique list of features, application software, and strength. Not only are opinions divided on the worth of each system, but also the availability, breed, and buyer beware notes differ. New computers tend to carry the newest operating system, but used computers can be mostly upgraded if the existing hardware is suitable.\n\n2.2. Key Milestones\n\nSymbian's key milestone was the sale of its 1 billionth smartphone in early 2011. The Linux operating system began to be used by individual users in the early 1990s when Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel. The Free Software Foundation then led the completion of the operating system. Linux has now been mostly adopted among server applications and supercomputer sites, and is widely used on many other systems, including those where high security requirements exist. There are about three hundred distributions that use Linux, including the Ubuntu Linux distro, released in 2004. Microsoft's next system after MS-DOS, i.e., Windows, was released in the second half of 1985. Then many versions were created, beginning with Windows 1.0 in 1985, and culminating in Windows 10, which was released at the end of July 2015. As the number of users of the graphical user interface exploded, the Windows operating system was widely adopted. However, macOS is a Unix-based operating system. GNU that appears in the system's name stands for \"GNU's Not Unix\". iOS, which was first released in 2007, was developed for Apple Inc. products. It is the second most popular OS in the mobile device domain and has made Apple Inc. become the world's most valuable company. The WinTel platform has made Microsoft's operating system a sensitively powerful operating system. Furthermore, this application has become a monopoly, with various means being used to keep other operating systems from reaching users. The most critical factor in this strategy is the \"END-n\" philosophy or \"Embrace, Extend, Extinguish\" strategy, which has been tried to be pursued exclusively by Microsoft. Its main principle is the belief that Microsoft can force its rivals into what it knows and control what happens. Because horizontal integration has been weakened in the stock market, its operations have reached the end-user market by creating its associated power. In particular, all computer games have been led to become part of the WinTel platform.\n\n3. The Big Five Operating Systems\n\nModern information and communication technologies form the basis of modern computing. Some technologies, such as the operating system, are essential because they form the layer between the application software and the hardware components of the computer. This article analyzes the impact of the Big Five operating systems on the different areas of computing, beginning with the personal area. In the medium area, mainframes and servers can run multiple operating systems with the help of special software known as a hypervisor. The operating systems made by Apple, the IBM z/OS, and Linux combined can be run on mainframes. In the mini area, where minicomputers and specialized servers are located, the diversity of operating systems is important. The advent of the microcomputer led to the development of the personal area, where the operating system consumer version guarantees security, data transmission speed, and multiple applications running simultaneously, but has negative aspects, such as the decrease in performance when the quantity of applications running increases and the infection facilitated by the use of antivirus and firewall. The quantity of malware created to attack Windows-based platforms has been ever-increasing. That is to blame for the fact that Windows has a broad market share in personal computers and laptops, producing the effect of \"economies of scale.\" Linux is ideally resistant to malware. Like other Unix systems, it is not directly infected by Windows malware. Linux is known for running on countless devices. The analysis made about the two operating systems utilized by current smartphones shows that a mobile phone can run two operating systems made by Apple or Google. Other vendors, such as Blackberry and Samsung, which used to run with a proprietary operating system, adopted the Android source code for their models.\n\n3.1. Windows\n\nThe first and most widely used operating system (OS) for venues today is Windows. Out of the millions of computing devices in public use, undoubtedly the majority contains a Windows-based operating system (OS). The name itself belongs to the most powerful company in the OS business: Microsoft develops and maintains it. Windows is the primary OS monopolized in the business world, used on desktops, at the client side, and on server backends. An OS's power can be partially delegated with the power of applications that are compatible with every OS release that Microsoft, as a company, has made. It is almost a company within a company, providing work to other developers or groups of developers. There is also a belief that it has hindered further development and increased maintenance costs for some smaller companies. Until 1995, Windows was a Graphical User Interface (GUI) located on top of an MSDOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System). However, just like its predecessors, after much evolution, Microsoft saw the necessity to provide a relatively large number of graphics on basic CPUs, thus providing part of the middleware that used to be handled in a higher-level processor to simplify tasks like drawing windows and processing mouse and keyboard inputs. Windows has faced significant competition in the last few years. Other contenders include systems such as Macintosh from Apple Computers, IBM's OS/2, NeXT's NeXTSTEP, BeOS from Be Inc., Linux (a Unix clone), and Sun's Solaris OS. Due to the prolific development of notebooks and the continuous rise of wireless devices, however, and its extended use outside specialized computer applications, Windows will likely continue to be a relevant OS. Its standing as the primary OS for the education environment and the knowledge worker venue, much based on the power of companies such as Oracle, SAP, or Computer Associates, will likely confirm its vitality in this scenario.\n\n3.2. macOS\n\nApple computers were originally designed to work with the Lisa and macOS operating systems. Developments made in the Lisa environment were quickly adopted and enhanced in the development of macOS. In 2000, Apple introduced the X operating system that was based partially on BSD, and today's macOS is an extension of the X operating system. The X operating system was developed to provide Apple a feature-rich operating system that incorporated the ability to work with a wide range of peripherals. The X operating system is a Unix-based system and that means it will run over any device if an appropriate device driver is provided. There is an entire separate technical support website that provides instructions, guidance, and downloads of device drivers that are compatible with Apple devices. Using the Intel-based hardware, Apple has also developed a product they call Boot Camp. With Boot Camp, a user can install Microsoft Windows on their computer and run any Microsoft Windows-related applications. There is an intellectual property conflict looming as Apple expands into the operating system market that IBM and Microsoft have so effectively defended. The Apple operating system is a virus-resistant, network-friendly operating system that is very easy to use. The Apple computer and operating system are enterprise-friendly, featured, and versatile. The resistance to Apple computers being used in a corporate environment tends to be, in my opinion, the result of an ingrained cultural resistance. The culture is that of a mainframe era when everything was green and black text. The information era has blossomed with the Windows interface. To abandon a metaphor, an easy-to-use application (or software) interface that Windows has opened a new era in computing. It is an era in which information and knowledge are really available to key decision-makers in real time.\n\n3.3. Linux\n\nLinux was initiated by Linus Torvalds, then a postgraduate student at the University of Helsinki, for his personal computer running the Minix operating system. Since then, it has been extensively rewritten and distributed under a variety of different licenses by the so-called Free Software Foundation and others. Like both of the other modern open-source systems, Linux has become the subject of both professional commercial activities and highly focused free efforts to use it to exploit the characteristics of powerful computer architectures. Torvalds felt that Minix was insufficiently powerful for the computer that he used daily to improve his understanding of the working of the Intel 80386. He adapted the GNU C Compiler, the Xlib, and extended Minix to include a small kernel that he initially named Freax. They are still elements of Linux while using a machine borrowed from the University and its significant network services to resolve queries. However, the services remained slow. It is the free availability of Minix, also using the user license, which facilitated its diffusion. After the dent of error corrections, around September 1991, it was \"officially\" released, though others are known to have contributed to work on various other ancillary system programs such as a shell and support tools, a file system, a disk driver, a debugger, and a printer driver. Soon there were a few more free copies of Linux to be made expressly for fall. They may receive a disk by posting floppies to a Prestel account controlled by Torvalds until he swapped it for a huge store of vegetables, to which were added numerous corrections and improvements, mainly associated with basic operating system interfaces and data recovery.\n\n3.4. iOS\n\nAnother dominant mobile operating system is Apple's iOS, which is used exclusively for Apple's mobile hardware. Both the operating system and devices use a closed architecture. Although some Unix-based parts of the operating system are open source, the operating system relies heavily on closed-source, proprietary software. The fact that both the device and the operating system are closed-source software is both the major strength and the major weakness of the brand, and many users and companies are both intrigued by the brand's offerings, yet apprehensive about the level of control Apple exerts over their products. Access to the official app store is either allowed or disallowed by Apple, which moderates the software and other content available for users to access. This walled garden approach benefits the security of the device and the financial interests of the brand itself; malware is almost unknown, and Apple has been profitable for each quarter since October 2003. Whether it benefits the consumer is not yet known, and is the subject of interesting market research, because even when Apple controls both the app store and software updating, financial interests do not always align with the user need for security updates from third parties, or the user need to install software that is not available from official sources. Nevertheless, the platform is seen as a valuable one, and device sales have been growing even during difficult financial times.\n\n3.5. Android\n\nAndroid is based on the Linux kernel, but it only uses a subset of the code of the Linux kernel. Approximately 6.5% from 2.6 million lines that the Linux kernel holds are present on the Android devices. However, this lack of integration is not a big deal, as essential functionality of higher levels that Android uses, like video, graphics, audio, and Bluetooth, among others, is exactly the kernel of the Linux. The Android operating system leverages all of the reusability and flexibility of Linux, which is one of its major benefits. The Linux kernel is suitable for use in the embedded system, as it is currently used in a wide variety of embedded systems. Some of the features that make the kernel stand out include voltage and frequency scaling for power saving, and suspend and resume operations. These features are extremely important on a handheld device, where saving the maximum amount of battery possible is of the utmost importance, as neither of the two competing operating systems for mobile applications, Windows Phone and OS X, use the Linux kernel. Android is supplied with a P8 kernel (API Level 8) and developers are urged to develop applications that are compatible with that version. At the time we performed our tests, 12% of the devices accessed the Market with an older or newer API Level. The development for the most recent OS version is encouraged by the offer of CTS - Compatibility Test Suite - a test battery that helps developers ensure the application compatibility between the available devices.\n\n4. Technological Advancements and Innovations\n\nMobile computing has evolved beyond simply enabling the use of mobile personal computers or other hardware. Location, user profiles, and network interfaces all become equally important parameters. Types of services are being developed that exploit the capabilities of mobile systems, enabling continuous spatial access to wired Internet services and offering services that are only possible or particularly valuable in a mobile environment. Services are increasingly designed for mobile users and are accessible via wire-based, satellite-based or other networks. New service models may evolve, for example, where the revenue model is based on subscriber location, device type, session duration, session content, session destination, and so on. These additional parameters provide more business opportunities for service providers and free users from traditional subscription fee models in some cases because many users' usage revenue is substituted based on different available combinations of the above parameters. The orchestration of different technologies, different user interfaces, subscribers, and data types are the heart of the new inventions of the hybrid mobile system.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nWe have, in this paper, presented a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the big five operating systems on modern computing. The five operating systems analyzed were Windows NT, UNIX, Mac OS X, OS/2, and BeOS. The comparison was made on both the high and low ends of computing. While security was, and simply put, still is a major problem in Windows, all the five operating systems are making efforts at being accepted in the fields of high-end computing. It has been clearly established that Windows NT is the major server in use today. All the systems, except BeOS, are now accepted in network environments. UNIX, readily available under different flavors from different providers, is strong in both server and network computing. Mac OS X is making an attempt to be accepted within the network domain, and we concluded that WEP is the only feature that it lacks in the list of security features. On the low end, all the viewed five operating systems are making concerted efforts at making a name for themselves. They have been refined for ease of use and system management and have compatible high-end versions. OS/2 and BeOS are very strong on the low end. However, Be, Inc. is not marketing BeOS as a multi-user operating system. Companies and professional associations that require computing technology have consistently expressed a strong interest in leveraging modern computing technology through networked and microcomputer (personal computer) systems. The trend towards using systems that are smaller, less expensive, and easier to use and maintain is continuing. With operating systems such as OS/2, Windows NT, UNIX, Mac OS X, and BeOS, there is no reason why an organization should not patronize networked and microcomputer systems."
