Here are the basic things to keep in mind with a MCKL font license:\n\nWhen you license fonts from our website, you have the option of three different usages: Desktop, Webfont, and App Licensing.\n\nFor desktop licenses, we calculate usage based on the number of users. Individual users may have the fonts installed on multiple computers.\n\nFor webfont licenses, we calculate usage based on the number of monthly visitors to a website. We do not count page views or any other metric for webfonts.\n\nFor app licenses, we calculate usage based on the number of monthly users of the app.\n\nIf you have additional questions, you can visit our FAQ section or email us at info@mckltype.com.\n\nEffective as of July 20, 2021\n\nThese General Terms and Conditions (“General Terms”) constitute a legally binding agreement between you (the “Licensee”) and MCKL, Inc.

These General Terms, together with the terms and conditions of the applicable License Agreement, govern the license and use of the typeface font computer software program(s), together with any related documentation, updates, and permitted copies thereof, selected by Licensee and specified therein (the “Font Software”).\n\nLICENSEE’S ACCEPTANCE AND USE OF THE FONT SOFTWARE CONSTITUTES ITS AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THE GENERAL TERMS AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENT.\n\nLicense Restrictions.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARISE OUT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE OR LICENSOR WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nIndemnification. Licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensor and its parent, subsidiary, and affiliate companies and licensors and each of their respective officers, directors, members, managers, employees, contractors, licensors, agents, successors, and assigns from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, settlements, costs, penalties, or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) (collectively, “Losses”) arising out of or in connection with any claim brought by a third party based on any breach, or allegation, which if true, would constitute a breach, by Licensee of (i) its representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations hereunder, (ii) applicable local, state, federal, or international law or regulation, or (iii) any party’s rights, including, but not limited to, any intellectual property rights. The indemnified parties shall promptly notify Licensee in writing of any such indemnified claim (provided, however, any delay in such notice shall not relieve Licensee of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such delay prejudices the defense of such claim) and give Licensee the opportunity to defend or settle such claim at Licensee’s sole cost and expense; provided, however, Licensee shall not settle any such claim without the applicable indemnified parties’ prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned; provided, further, the indemnified parties reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any such claim.

In the event of a breach by Licensee of the terms of the License, including, without limitation, the restrictions under the License, Licensor will suffer irreparable harm in for which monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy, and, as such, if Licensee breaches or threatens to breach any of the obligations set forth therein, Licensor will have the right, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief or specific performance or both, from a court of competent jurisdiction, in addition to all other remedies available to Licensor at law, in equity, or pursuant to this Agreement.

This Agreement may be amended only with the written consent of the parties and the observance of any provision of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in any particular instance, retroactively or prospectively) only with the written consent of the waiving party. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.\n\nThe Desktop License (defined below) under this Agreement is solely for use on a desktop or laptop computer.
