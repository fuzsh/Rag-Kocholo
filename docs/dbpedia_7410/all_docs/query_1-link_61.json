CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n\nPlease Read This Provision Carefully.Â It Affects Your Legal Rights.\n\nThis Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver provision (the âProvisionâ) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (e.g., claim or controversy, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort â including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence â or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between You and Us.Â Effectively, then, âdisputeâ is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to You (such as Our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever You also assert claims against Us in the same proceeding.\n\nThis Provision provides that all disputes between You and Us shall be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of These Terms constitutes a waiver of Your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.Â Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.Â To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.Â The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneyâs fees).Â You may, however, opt-out of this Provision which means You would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).Â EVERYONE AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.\n\nâ\n\nPre-Arbitration Claim Resolution\n\nFor all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, You must first give Us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute which is first done by sending an email to Us at legal@drseuss.com the following information: (1) Your name, (2) Your address, (3) A written description of Your Claim, and (4) A description of the specific relief You seek. If We do not resolve the Dispute within 60 days after receiving Your notification, then You may pursue Your Dispute in arbitration.Â You may pursue Your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.\n\nâ\n\nExclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out\n\nNotwithstanding the above, You or We may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) The dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS (the âOpt-Out Deadlineâ).Â You may opt-out of this Provision by emailing Us at legal@drseuss.com the following information: (1) Your name; (2) Your address; (3) A clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes with Us through arbitration. Either way, We will not take any decision You make personally.Â In fact, We promise that Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on Your relationship with Us.Â But, We do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline so keep in mind that any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must pursue Your dispute in arbitration or small claims court.\n\nâ\n\nArbitration Procedures\n\nIf this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either You or We may initiate arbitration proceedings.Â The American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.Â The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration only, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration or a consolidated or representative action or arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.\n\nFor arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAAâs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAAâs Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.Â In either instance, the AAAâs Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.Â The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.Â For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.Â The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.Â This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.Â Under no circumstances will class action or representative procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.\n\nBecause this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ) governs the arbitrability of all disputes.Â However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.\n\nArbitration Award â The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.Â The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party or if required by applicable law. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA or other applicable law, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.\n\nLocation of Arbitration â You or We may initiate arbitration in either California or the federal judicial district that includes Your billing address.\n\nPayment of Arbitration Fees and Costs â So long as You place a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, We will pay all arbitration filing fees and AAA or JAMS hearing fees and any arbitrator's hearing fees, costs and expenses upon Your written request to the arbitrator given at or before the first evidentiary hearing in the arbitration.Â But, You will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that You incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited to attorneysâ fees or expert witnesses.Â In addition to any fees and costs recoverable under applicable law, if You provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Us as provided in the section above titled âPre-Arbitration Claim Resolutionâ and the arbitrator concludes that You are the prevailing party in the arbitration, You will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneyâs fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.\n\nâ\n\nClass Action Waiver\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action, representative action, or private attorney general action) unless both You and We specifically agree to do so in writing following initiation of the arbitration.Â If You choose to pursue Your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to You.Â Neither You, nor any other user of this Website can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.\n\nâ\n\nNo Judge or Jury in Arbitration\n\nArbitration does not involve a judge or jury.Â You understand and agree that by entering into these Terms You and We are each giving up the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.Â In the absence of this Provision, You and We might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).Â Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.Â Other rights that You would have if You went to court (e.g., the rights to both appeal and certain types of discovery) may be more limited or may also be waived.\n\nâ\n\nSeverability\n\nIf any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect.Â If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.\n\nContinuation\n\nThis Provision shall survive the termination of Your account with Us or Our affiliates and Your discontinued use of this Website.Â Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, We agree that if We make any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), You may reject any such change and require Us to adhere to the present language in this Provision if a dispute between Us arises.\n\nâ\n\nLANGUAGE.\n\nThe Parties hereto have expressly required that these Terms and all documents and notices relating thereto be drafted in the English language.\n\nâ\n\nGENERAL.\n\nWe think direct communication resolves most issues â if We feel that You are not complying with these Terms, We will tell You.Â We may even provide You with recommended necessary corrective action(s) because We value this relationship.\n\nHowever, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by Us, may require immediate termination of Your access to this Website without prior notice to You.Â The Federal Arbitration Act, California state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms.Â Foreign laws do not apply.Â Except for disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or this Website will be heard in the courts located in San Diego County, California.Â If any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then such term(s) shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified.Â By choosing not to enforce any of these Terms, We are not waiving Our rights.Â These Terms are the entire agreement between You and Us and, therefore, supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between Everyone about this Website.Â The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by You, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.\n\nâ\n\nCONTACT US.\n\nIf You have any questions about these Terms or otherwise need to contact Us for any reason, You can reach Us at 9645 Scranton Rd.
