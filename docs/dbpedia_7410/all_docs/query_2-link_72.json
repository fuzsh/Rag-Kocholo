        "text": "Out of curiosity, what d'yall think of this? This idea pops into my head every once in a while.\n\nDo you think there would be much of a market for a proprietary DAW, one that would provide a similar environment to common Windows- or Mac-based programs like Pro Tools, Sonar, Cubase, DP etc, but not run on Windows or Macintosh?\n\nThe foundation for this idea is something like RADAR (do people still use RADAR?). Caveat: I don't know many specifics about RADAR. But since people seem to have so many problems that often grow out of non-audio related aspects of their recording system, it seems like a proprietary system that doesn't exclude anything DAW-related might be attractive.\n\n- Imagine this: the computer base could be any commonly-used, commonly-built, commonly-modified system based on an Intel x86 structure or whatever.\n\n- Starting with that, construct an operating system and DAW (I don't even know if proprietary workstation systems would have separate OS/application programming) that is entirely DAW-focused, no access to internet, email, office software, games etc.\n\n- Full audio and MIDI recording, editing & mixing capabilities of which capacity is limited only by hardware (like most (all?) host-based DAW's), and full graphic representation.\n\n- Full VST/third-party plugin integration.\n\n- Full compatibility with common hardware integration standards (I'm a Mac user where it's Core Audio; for Windows it's ASIO?)\n\n- Blah blah blah\n\nBasically it would be just like any program any of us use, but without the hassle of working in operating systems that don't have DAW use as a priority, and programming that really optimized system resources to maximize DAW features.\n\nWhat an old idea! This was just the way that DAWs started when they only offered two tracks and cost $30,000 and expanded (and the price dropped) as the definition (or requirements) for a DAW grew.\n\nPeople still use RADAR, though usually after the tracking phase, the project is transferred to Pro Tools or Nuendo for processing and mixing. People like it for the sound of the converters, the speed of recording new tracks, the ease of editing while you're working, and the fact that there's no computer to maintain. But the demand for more capability at lower cost has stifled the development of new, advanced hardware DAWs. I guess the last one was the TASCAM X-48, which didn't last very long.\n\nMy primary multitrack recorder is still a Mackie HDR24/96. It's limited to 24 tracks, but I've rarely gone beyond about a dozen. I like the editor better than any DAW that I've used, and it doesn't crash, it hasn't been updated since about 2003, and it sounds pretty good (and can sound as good as any 44.1/48 kHz A/D and D/A converters that I would like to use). While it doesn't support software plug-ins, I can open a track with a computer program, apply software processing, and then put it back on the recorder so it can be mixed from there. And I can hand someone a disk of files that can be easily (though not automagically) imported into a computer-based DAW.\n\nToday's dedicated DAWs tend to be writing and composing tools that are easy to use for basic tasks like tracking and rough mixing, and are compact and inexpensive. With something like a Zoom R-16 (and now the R-24), a mic, and a pair of headphones, you can record a multitrack project anywhere, mix it well enough to know how the project is going, and in many cases, finish the project right on the same $400 battery powered unit.\n\nWho needs all those plug-ins anyway?\n\nThe advantage of a common OS to DAW is simple, it's a common ground for 3rd party developers.\n\nBut this leads to every system being the same, or at least having the same capabilities. Wouldn't that be boring? People bought API consoles because they liked the mic preamps, Neve consoles because they liked the EQ (same for different series SSL consoles), they bought MCI consoles because they liked the price. They bought Ampex recorders because they liked the low end. They bought Studer because they liked the high end. They bought Otari because what they recorded on the Otari sounded better when mixed in a studio that had an Ampex.\n\nIf what you want is the ability to use any plug-in with any DAW, we're pretty close to that today. You don't need to know PC or Mac programming to design a VST plug-in (OK, you have to know enough to build an installer, but that's probably just a bolt-on) because there's a VST programming standard that's common to a whole lot of programs regardless of the platform. You could run VST plug-ins (sort of) on the TASCAM X-48 recorder and Mackie x-Bus console, but you still have to go outboard to get a real API mic preamp or Neve EQ.\n\nIn comparison to the millions of general computing used by home and business, the professional audio business is very very small in comparison.\n\nHaving specialized computing systems dates back to the early 80s when computer manufacturers were all jockeying for the lead role. Many of the earley PC's had specialized software written for the unique hardware and would do the specialized jobs over others. This was all a continuance of all the specialized calculators previously being made and carried on into the computing market.\n\nI worked on many of them for Monroe back then. Monroe was an old calculator company that had gotten into computers and were the originators of DOS. Once the hardware battel was won by companies with deep pockets like IBM and Apple, companies like mine closed whole building of R&D, program writers and hardware manufacturing. To recoup some cost, they sold DOS to Bill Gates. (Bill Gates didnt write DOD but it sure came in handy for designing windows)\n\nOnce the hardware became standard, and a stable OS was available, Then interchangable software exploded. You didnt have to have a factory to make it and anyone with an education could learn to write code for a PC or Apple.\n\nI dont see a specialized DAW as gaining and major traction in the market. you will have a few companies that survive in specialized daws, but thats about it.\n\nReason. Even with the cost of say 30K for a specialized daw, its not profitable, and the product isnt going to be highly competitive. Not when you can buy the top end computers made for a few grand and even top software with support for maybe a few grand above that.\n\nAnything specialized is going to be obsolite before it even makes it off the drawing board. This is because the markets for hardware are going to be PC or apple based and designed for that software. The growth/improvement of hardware will trump the DAW software before its written unless its something the company has already and are playing continual catchup rewriting the software to keep up with hardware improvements.\n\nSmaller companies just dont have the R&D budget a Microsoft has nor the clout with Hardware manufacturers to develop specialized hardware at reasonable costs. They Can get hardware specifically for their daws and or write the software themselves, but thats where the cost comes in. If they use existing hardware and write the software to run it, then like I said, the hardwares obsolite by the time they're done writing the software unless its a continual update process for them and they have the ability to pass on those updates to customers in a non disruptive, non distructive manor.\n\nLike I said, The idea may seem appealing, but theres so many factors that make it impractable in both coat and support it doesnt look to me like its going to gain any more traction than it currently has.\n\nThe best those companies do is in Hard Disk/and even memory recorders. I think that market might still have some life in it if the manufacturers figure out they need to add a video card and mouse port for easy editing. A good basic editing program that will accept plugins wouldnt hurt either.\n\nIf you get into adding a flip up screen then your cost will go up. A 15$ card for video and mouse wouldnt be that bad. Otherwise you're basically talking a laptop.\n\nThere may be 300~400 million computers in the US alone. How many do you think are DAWs and weather a spesialized DAW at affordable prices might be a profitable venture.\n\nThe major software manufacturers do make specialized OS but its mostly for major corporations that can afford to buy thousands of licences and have a taylored version written for them. Maybe a major Movie/Recording company can afford to have programs that are taylored for their use.\n\nFor your smaller private studios who cut corners to eek out as much profit they can, i just dont see spending that kind of money a wise choice when you have options that work well even with all the issues that can come up. It has and will continue to improve though.\n\nYou got to keep in perspective though. Recording audio dates back a long time but digital recording, especially on a consumer level is very, very new. The improvements made in digital the past 10~20 years are just plain staggaring. Compare something even like Cakewalk 8 to Sonar 8 and the differences are there. Analog improvements took many many decades to improve in comparison because its was all hardware and manufacturing vs code.\n\nThe problems and challanges recording mixing and mastering digital today is nothing in comparison to what you deal with recording analog even today. Many of those analog designs never changed and were juat as big a pain in the butt since the day they were invented \"but\" they got the job done.\n\nWell, my point is that there is a market for it and more specialization in OS offerings in other fields as well. That's something that should have developed long ago, but it hasn't. Marketing says you can do everything with one PC and OS. The truth is you can't, but marketing always wins.\n\nAnother approach would be the OS is bare bones by default and we add what we need rather than have to remove what was installed by default. Like I said the way we've become accustomed to is sloppy and not well thought out at all. Of course I'm of the mind that the first thing one should do when setting up a PC for DAW use is to buy a different PC for that purpose. IMO most people are doing it wrong and half the problems people have are because of doing it this wrong way. Great for Microsoft, but bad for users... whether the users know it or not.\n\nI can see what great things have come along, but I can also see how they could have been and could be much better.\n\nWell, my point is that there is a market for it and more specialization in OS offerings in other fields as well.

Great for Microsoft, but bad for users... whether the users know it or not.\n\nI can see what great things have come along, but I can also see how they could have been and could be much better.\n\nI dont see anyone dissagreeing with that. The first thing I do is strip the OS and the hardware to basics. All non essencial services get shut off, Unneed board get pulled. I basically have nothing but my Interface and recording software running so I have maximum resources available to record. All non essential software gets removed too.\n\nI use IE to intall essential updates, then I dump everything I can. fancy buttons and screens all go. I get a Boot up time is maybe 30 seconds and shutdown is 15 seconds. All I use my studio unit for is recording. Its not connected to a network where most of the problems come from. I have virtually no crashes, and can record 24 tracks just fine.\n\nI have no reason myself to pay mega bucks for something I already have. A dedicated computer for recording. It would be nice to buy a computer, load a few disks, then have it boot to a daw station. But pushing a few extra buttons to launch the program, really isnt going to kill me. Besides If I do need to update something I can enable the Network card and get on the net if I had to. Or just download onto my internet machine and transfer the update with a memory stick.\n\nI used to see that a lot, but not so much any more. I always wondered how much you needed to know in order to strip the OS (Windows, I assume) down to the basics, but obviously more than I know. And then the Linux advocates come along talking about how the source code is available so the proverbial \"anyone\" can take out whatever he doesn't need.\n\nWhy don't you write an article about stripping down Windows with specifics - what to remove and how to remove it?\n\nThere's stuff out there... some are more complete than others. I have a 6-page list I've compiled over the years that I check off when installing XP. It's a PITA, but well worth the results. My DAW runs like a top on much less hardware than most people I know have. It's all about optimizing what you have.\n\nUnfortunately the prevailing thought is sort of a brawn over brain mentality. People just upgrade hardware to compensate for the bloated OS and programs rather than deal with the true cause of the bloating.\n\nThis is where I always wanted to see some initiative from Microsoft, but I know it ain't gonna happen. It's like many other things in life... we suffer for the ineptitude of the \"average user.\" MS tries to make the OS idiot proof, but in so doing the rest of us have to wrestle with the thing to get it anywhere close to optimized for recording purposes.\n\nI'm a big Linux fan too (since 1996) and the downside of Linux was always too much damn work. But setting up Windows... the right way is as much if not more work these days. Most people are happy with it as is, but that's because they don't know any better and it is a lot of work to tweak even when they do know better."
