        "text": "Introduction to Haiku Operating System\n\nHaiku OS is an open-source and free-to-use project that started in 2001. Self-hosted in 2008, which shows compatibility with the BeOS system. In 2009, the first alpha version was launched, followed by its release in November 2012. The Beta version was released in September 2018, followed by Beta 2 in June 2020 and Beta 3 in July 2021. The Latest version, Beta 4, was released in December 2022.\n\nThe project began with the goal of delivering an open-source, user-intuitive desktop that doesn’t require administration even for handling complex applications. The OS landscape combines efficiency with elegance.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nFree and open-source OS for personal computing.\n\nExtension of BeOS, making it binary-compatible to it.\n\nWe prioritize efficiency and responsiveness.\n\nIts modular nature allows the only necessary part to be loaded whenever required, reducing boot time and improving system performance.\n\nAllows preemptive multitasking, ensuring the system will remain stable while running multiple processes.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction to Haiku Operating System\n\nInstallation of Haiku\n\nOrigins and Evolution\n\nArchitecture and Design\n\nWhat is Haiku OS\n\nHaiku’s Contribution to Open Source\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Haiku Operating System\n\nComparisons with Other Operating Systems\n\nInstallation of Haiku\n\nThe installation process is straightforward. But make sure you have the prerequisite done before starting the installation. Haiku cannot currently resize existing partitions. To install Haiku, you need an empty partition or create one using third-party tools like GParted LiveCD. A standard 32-bit Haiku installation requires about 1.3 GiB of space, and allocating at least 3 GiB for potential 3rd-party applications is recommended.\n\nIf your disk has multiple partitions, a boot loader like GRUB is necessary to boot into Haiku, while the Haiku Boot Manager is an alternative option in some cases.\n\nTo install Haiku, an open-source operating system inspired by BeOS, follow these steps:\n\n1. Download Haiku OS\n\nVisit the official Haiku OS website (https://www.haiku-os.org/) and download the installation image suitable for your computer architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).\n\n2. Create a Bootable USB Drive\n\nUse Etcher or Rufus to write the Haiku OS image onto a USB flash drive. We use the Rufus for the bootable USB Drive. Then Click on the Start button.\n\n3. The haiku OS is loading and starting.\n\n4. Select your language and click the Install Haiku button to proceed to the next step.\n\n5. A notice appears before the Haiku Installer launches. Click Continue to proceed to the Installer.\n\n6. If you encounter this alert, it simply means the system did not locate any Be File System (BFS) partitions. Click on the OK Button.\n\n7. You use the DriveSetup partitioning application when there isn’t a BFS partition available or if you want to use a different formatted partition. To launch DriveSetup, select the Setup partitions Button.\n\n8. Haiku’s partition manager, DriveSetup, displays the identified disks and partitions. The only components in this example are the 32 GiB empty hard drive and the booting USB stick containing the 1.37 GiB Haiku partition from which we will install.\n\n9. To begin, choose the target hard drive. In the top view, your drive or partition will have a blue border to highlight it. Next, select the Disk menu and Select >> Initialize >> Intel Partition Map.\n\n10. Click Continue if you’re sure you’ve chosen the correct hard drive.\n\n11. Then, Click on the Write changes.\n\n12. Your hard drive has successfully initialized, and you will soon see an alert.\n\nClick on OK.\n\n13. Choose Partition and empty space on the initialized drive to create the target partition. Then Click on the Create Button.\n\n14. Select Partition to create the target partition and leave empty space on the initialized drive. Then Click on the Create Button.\n\n15. It’s format time now. Choose the recently formed partition, select Format from the Partition menu, and click the Be File System button.\n\n16. Then, a popup appears, and click on the continue button.\n\n17. After a window opens, you can choose the Blocksize and Name. It’s okay to stick with the default values. Since many Haiku features depend on those quick attribute queries, the checkmark Enable query support should remain enabled.\n\n>Select Format Button.\n\n18. After one final confirmation prompt, click “Write changes,” the formatting is complete in just a few seconds.\n\n19. To dismiss the alert that lets you know that the formatting was successful, click the OK Button.\n\nNow, observe the addition of the new file system name and type to the list.\n\nThe partition setup is now complete.\n\nClick the close widget in the window tab’s upper left corner to end DriveSetup.\n\n20. Now that the Installer window has returned, an updated list of target partitions should be visible under Onto. Click on Begin to launch the installation after selecting your recently formatted partition as the installation target.\n\n21. The installation process collects information Before initiating the data copying process. After a few seconds, it begins copying packages, and a progress bar displaying the number of files appears.\n\n22. Then Click the Restart Button. After your installation has been successful, you can explore the Operating System.\n\nOrigins and Evolution\n\nIn 2001, OpenBeOS began, aiming to create an open-source alternative compatible with BeOS. It transitioned into the Haiku project, focusing on helping the BeOS user community.\n\nEarly Developments\n\nIn 2002, the community created a temporary update for BeOS 5.0.3 as part of the OpenBeOS project. Haiku, Inc., a non-profit, was established in 2003 in New York to provide funds for development.\n\nName Change and Logo Design\n\nIn 2004, the project was renamed Haiku due to trademark concerns. Stuart McCoy designed the first Haiku logo, and in 2007, A public vote was used to choose the Haiku icon.\n\nContributions and Prototypes\n\nStephan Assmus, an artist and developer, played a vital key role in the Haiku Usability & Design Team. He co-created WonderBrush, enhanced it, and developed the HVIF icon vector format used by Haiku.\n\nMilestones\n\nThe release of Haiku R1/Alpha 1 took place in September 2009.\n\nAfter years of development, R1/Beta 1 launched on September 19, 2018.\n\nR1/Beta 2 followed on June 9, 2020, and the most recent version, R1/Beta 3, on July 26, 2021.\n\nVersion Release date OS name Architecture Haiku R1/Alpha1 2009-09-14[39] hrev33109 IA-32 Haiku R1/Alpha2 2010-05-10[40] hrev36769 N/A Haiku R1/Alpha3 40714 hrev42211 N/A Haiku R1/Alpha4 2012-11-11[41] hrev44702 IA-32, X86-64 Haiku R1/Beta1 43371 hrev52295 N/A Haiku R1/Beta2 2020-06-09[42] hrev54154 N/A Haiku R1/Beta3 2021-07-26[43] hrev55182 N/A Haiku R1/Beta4 2022-12-23[44] hrev56578 IA-32, X86-64, RISC-V\n\nNightly Builds\n\nNightly builds, available in 64-bit and 32-bit versions, are continuously developed and accessible between official releases on the Haiku Nightly website.\n\nArchitecture and Design\n\nHaiku is created on top of C++, offering an object-oriented API. Leveraging the modular design inherited from BeOS, Haiku’s development took place in specialized teams, initially working in relative isolation on various components. These teams, referred to as “kits” in Haiku, include:\n\nApp/Interface: Focuses on developing the Interface, App, and Support kits.\n\nBFS: Concentrates on crafting the Be File System, resulting in the OpenBFS.\n\nGame: Works on the Game Kit and its associated APIs.\n\nInput Server: Manages input devices like keyboards and mice, ensuring seamless communication with other system components.\n\nKernel: Engaged in developing the kernel, the central component of the operating system.\n\nMedia: Concentrates on the audio server and related APIs.\n\nMIDI: Implements the MIDI protocol.\n\nNetwork: Writes drivers for network devices and associated networking APIs.\n\nOpenGL: Develops OpenGL support.\n\nPreferences: Recreates the preferences suite.\n\nPrinting: Focuses on print servers and printer drivers.\n\nScreen Saver: Implements screen saver functionality.\n\nStorage: Works on the storage kit and drivers for required file systems.\n\nTranslation: Recreates reading, writing, and file format conversion modules.\n\nWhile some kits have achieved feature completeness, others are at different stages of development. The Haiku kernel, a modular hybrid kernel, is a NewOS fork written initially by former Be Inc. engineer Travis Geiselbrecht. Currently undergoing intensive development, the kernel has implemented various features, including a virtual file system (VFS) layer and basic symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support.\n\nSoftware Features\n\nHaiku OS offers several features that contribute to its functionality, performance, and user experience.
