OS family: BeOS Source model: Closed source Latest stable release: BeOS R5.0.3 / March, 2000 Supported platforms: AT&T Hobbit, x86, PowerPC Kernel type: Modular hybrid kernel Default user interface: Graphical user interface License: proprietary Working state: Stopped\n\nBeOS is an operating system for personal computers which began development by Be Inc. in 1991. It was first written to run on BeBox hardware and, unlike some other operating systems of the time, BeOS was written from scratch and took therefore advantage of modern hardware. Optimized for digital media work, its GUI was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean, uncluttered design.\n\nHistory\n\nDescription\n\nBeOS made full use of multiprocessor systems by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth, pervasive multithreading, preemptive multitasking and a custom 64-bit journaled file system known as BFS. The API was written in C++ for ease of programming. It has POSIX compatibility and access to a command line interface through the bash shell, although internally it is not a Unix-derived operating system.\n\nVersions\n\nRelease Date Architecture DR1 - DR5 (Developer Release) October 1995 AT&T Hobbit DR6 January 1996 PowerPC DR7 April 1996 DR8 September 1996 Advanced Access Preview Release May 1997 PR1 (Preview Release) June 1997 PR2 October 1997 R3 March 1998 PowerPC\n\nIntel x86 R3.1 June 1998 R3.2 July 1998 R4 November 1998 R4.5 \"Genki\" June 1999 R5 PE/Pro \"Maui\" March 2000 R5.1 \"Dano\" November 2001 Intel x86\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\n\nHaiku"
