You and Coffee Bros. each expressly waive any right to trial by jury and the right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. Neither you nor Coffee Bros. shall be permitted or entitled to join or consolidate claims by or against others, or arbitrate or otherwise participate in any claims as a class member, class representative, or in any other representative capacity.\n\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and will take place in the county or parish in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including (but not limited to) issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate and the arbitrability of any dispute between you and Coffee Bros.. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by law. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone, and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, with or without oral hearings. Coffee Bros. agrees that, upon request, it will pay a consumer’s filing fee for the arbitration.\n\nFor the benefit of the parties, all aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including (but not limited to) the transcripts of the hearing, the transcript of any deposition, and all documents produced or used during the arbitration proceeding, will be strictly confidential.\n\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate. If a court decides that any provision of this paragraph is invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be severed and the other parts of this paragraph (and the remainder of these terms) will continue to apply, but in no case shall either you or Coffee Bros. be permitted to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThese Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Coffee Bros. relating to your access to and use of the Sites and your order, receipt and use of Products. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of Coffee Bros.. No waiver of any provision of these Terms will constitute a waiver of such provision in any prior, concurrent or subsequent circumstance, and Coffee Bros.’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.\n\nSMS Text Message Promotion:\n\nIn addition, you agree to our Messaging Terms (https://terms.pscr.pt/legal/shop/coffeebrosnyc/terms_of_service) and Messaging Privacy Policy (https://terms.pscr.pt/legal/shop/coffeebrosnyc/privacy_policy)."
