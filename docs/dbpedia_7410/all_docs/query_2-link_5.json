It was on my old 440BX/P3 450 system that runs BeOS all day, every day, with a small 2 gig Win98 partition. <P>Whereas everything instantly worked with BeOS when I booted it the first time (ethernet/sound/SCSI Plex CD writer) none of this worked with QNX. <P>I would have liked to have seen a comparison of Voyager, or even some details about Voyager. Also, is QNX multi-threaded like BeOS? <P>Anyway, unfortunately, I was unable to test Voyager. I wanted to see how it compared to Net+ on BeOS (I'm sure it is better) but the darned thing kept asking me for a dial up connection even though I'm on a lan with a DHCP server. <P>It seemed snappy, fast, stable and pretty (worked well with the Voodoo 3),but I couldn't get online, so I booted back into Win98, uninstalled, and then went back to BeOS, the original. Plus it is too much LIKE linux. At least Be is friendly in its directory structure. All that /dev /usr /bin stuff in QNX and Linux just confuses me. It's somewhat better hidden in BeOS. <P>BeOS- putting the soul back in x86 (if it's not dead yet!?!

It was horrible. But IIRC, QNX RTP wont run off a NTFS drive, so I just gave up all together.<P>However, after this article, I reinstalled BeOS, downloaded an older NVIDIA driver and behold! I was in! Then I fiddled for 30 minutes getting PPPoE to work (a hassle with 2 NICs), but here I am in Net Positive, posting away.<P>Nice article.

The downloadable Realtime Platform OS from QSSL is still in beta, the final release is not for another year. And I'd note, the GUI appearance is very customizable, the bar is not fixed to the bottom or fixed anywhere for that matter. I run with it running along the top and without the quick-links along the side, much like how my old AmigaOS looked. So please, bear with QSSL during their beta-testing period, things like this article are good feedback for them, and tells them what people would like out of RtP.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#8\n\nHmmm... this is the first I've heard of any roadmap for QNX, Downix.

I tried the free version out several months ago and thought it was prety neat. Then my brother came into town and used my g/f's puter (which at the time was running Win2K) while he was here and screwed IE up big time (He loaded all kinds of poop on there that caused ads to pop up at random times and got rid of the search side bar). I hacked around the registry for a while and found I just couldn't get rid of the crap he put on there. I've been getting frustrated with M$ and all it's crap - I've been an avid Slackware linux user for about 3 years now. I thought about loading linux on her computer and decided not to - She would have too hard a time doing things for herself. So I bought a copy of BeOS 5 Pro with Productivty (thier Office-like Suite), sat her down and told her to install it (I figured if she could install it she would be happy with it). I had already fdisked the harddrive, so I showed her how to boot from a CD and she was on her way. She answered 1 or 2 questions during the install and next thing you knew BeOS was up and running. (She loved it). I walked her thought setting up the network and printer and then we headed over to bebits and she picked out some software. <BR>I really like BeOS and hope it continues altough I am concerned about it's future. TuCows has just dropped support of BeOS, stating that the company is shifting focus and BeOS may be going the way of the dodo. Plus the BeOS User Newsletter is about a month late. If anybody out there knows anything about this please let me know. <BR>On a side note, are there any other \"alternative\" OSes out there for x86 machines besides QNX, BeOS, Linux or OS/2?<P>Thanks,<BR>CP\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#10\n\nThanks for the feedback so far.<P>Sonoma76: I didn't compare the quality of the browsers as I was reviewing the quality of the OS, not any apps that came with it. Since you asked, I don't mind answering, though. Voyager is certainly a more capable browser than Net+. It's very snappy, and is up to the HTML 3.2 specs. It also does most JavaScript 1.1 (it has three unimplemented methods). Also built in is Flash and RealPlayer. To get those options for Be, you have to buy a third-party product and BeOS Pro, respectively. QNX is also a multithreaded OS.<P>Nimdok: I'm pretty sure there's going to be a Matrox OpenGL driver. It was only that higher priority had been given to others and it was really flaky. I expect that whenever they release the new stack, a Matrox driver will come with it. They've had good driver support in the past, and I expect they will in the future.<P>Downix: Hmm...I'd thought that this was a final release. Patch A brought it to ver. 6. If you could give a link to some info about this, that'd be appreciated.<P>CP: There's another thread going on here about other alt. OSes for x86: Advise people!

The good is that you have real copy-paste capabilities, left-click directory navigation (VERY useful), a powerful search tool (thanks to BFS) and an easily configurable menu. And anti-aliased fonts are, in my opinion, indispensable for modern desktop OS.<P>Well done, BeOS View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_smile.gif\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#14\n\nIt's worth noting that there is a driver availible on BeBits that supports any HP DeskJet printer.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#15\n\nDid they do anything with the BeOS fonts since version 4.5? I bought BeOS 4.5 in late 1999 and I thought the text fonts were nasty. They had too much blurring and didn't look clean and sharp like in Windows or easy on the eyes like the 6x13 font I use in Windows and Linux.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#16\n\nOne thing the article didn't touch on was SMP support.<P>How is SMP support under QNX? BeOS is well known for having great SMP capabilites (wasn't the original motto something about people needing more than one cpu, back when Be was still in the hardware business).<P>I did a quick check of QNX's website, and there was a mention of how to recompile the kernel for SMP support. Has anyone tried this, and how well does it work?\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#17\n\nVictim12: The font system hasn't been changed. Your complaint probably lies with the system-wide anti-aliasing done. Windows does it too, but it's probably not as apparent with the default font used. The font BeOS uses is smaller with more curves, which makes the anti-aliasing more visible.<P>nrichard: You're right about the Be's SMP motto and support. However, my PC only has a single proc, so I couldn't see how it worked first-hand with either OS.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#18\n\nWhy do people like them?

That's good GUI design.<P>But if you don't like them, hold down the Cntrl-Shift-Alt key on the left-hand side of your keyboard and click on the BeOS logo on the taskbar.

To enable it, hold down Ctrl-Alt-Shift and click on the Be menu. You'll see a new entry labeled Window Decors, which lets you pick a new style.<P>The other thing you can try is an app called EasyMove. It's an input_server add-on that lets you alt-click anywhere on a window to move it.<P>The easy way to move around windows without mucking with anything is to just move them by dragging the border. Be, like MacOS, doesn't let you resize the window on any part of it.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#21\n\nQNX is a real time OS. That's why it's in power plants and perhaps in the next visual simulator product where I work.

With the reliability of QNX, I'd certainly trust it to run a nuclear power plant or let it choose vectors space missions (as it has). However, the experience of using it as a human isn't particularly pleasureable. Be's refined UI and snappy feel easily make it a winner. If someone really wanted to, they could write a replacement for Photon. However, Photon is what they gave us, and thus what I had to rate.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#24\n\nBeOS is a fantastic OS but its days are limited.

The UI is actually based alot off of the MacOS. The reason why its so great is because like the mac its intuitive to the beginner user unlike linux and i don't know about Qnx's complicated installs and crap like that. IF this sounds like it belongs on the battle front sorry about it.

I'd like to challenge that...<BR>Be has definitly done a severe 'Focus shift' to BeIA, but they are making huge inroads there to the point were it's inevitable that alteast several of th e plethera of IA devices will be successful Between HARP and support from moguls like Sony BeIA has a definite future. <P>I can smell the flame coming... \"That's BeIA, but they've dropped BeOS!\"<P>And now for my rebuttle of the BeOS has no future statme n ts. BeOS has a future because BeIA has a future. Why? In the release statement from Be describing their focus shift, it states that the desktop of (BeOS) will continue to be developed because BeOS is the development environment for writing programs t ha t run on BeIA. Thus since BeIA has a future, BeOS has a future. People will always want more software and features for their IA's, and somebody has to develop that software and the only environment to do that is BeOS.<P>After it's shift Be has also sta ted that as technologies are developed for BeIA they will eventually be added to BeOS. Case in point, Opera, BeIA has Opera 4 while BeOS still only has Opera 3.6 but eventually it will be recompiled for BeOS.<P>Cheers to a brite and long future for BeOS!â„¢ View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_cool.gif Ë‡\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#28\n\nFrom an end user standpoint, BeOS would definitely offer a better experience. It's designed to be user friendly, and succeeds quite well.<P>QNX, otoh, was never designed to run on desktops. It's intended for embedded systems where interfaces don't matter much. It does very well at what it's supposed to do, serve as a reliable, stable rtos.<P>I don't get why QNX is trying to become an alternative desktop operating system. It has virtually no applications that could be of any use to an end user, and most people have no reason to use a RTOS. Why bother with QNX on the desktop when it has nothing to offer that other *nixes don't? I have QNX and find it quite nice, but it doesn't belong on desktops.<P>Both operating systems do very well at what they're targetted towards, but BeOS and QNX have completely different target audiences.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#29\n\nEmacs is available for BeOS.

You can get instructions to set them up here.<P>Both of the OSes are pretty relevant to each other. Until recently, they were marketing themselves towards totally different sectors, and now they're both attacking the mainstay of the other's revenue (although one could argue that Be wasn't making much as a desktop OS company; also, QNX isn't making much from their desktop version, it's really more of a promotional tool).<P>[This message was edited by Iconoplast on March 06, 2001 at 17:40.]\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#32\n\nDo some research first, man.

I do have to agree that BeOS is nicer to use. <BR> I started with computers a couple of years ago and was very discusted with the way Windows worked. After looking at Be, Linux, FreeBSD, and QNX, I've decided to concentrate my efforts on BeOS. Simply put, I like the design of things. I've worked with mechanical devices and steel fabrication for 20 years. It's given me an eye for logical design and \"what works and what doesn't!\". I've devoted a lot of effort to learning computer hardware and software in the last 2 years. I am currently concentrating my efforts on learning to develop for BeOS because it's the best example I've seen yet of how I feel an operating system should serve it's user. Should it ever become outdated or be surpassed, I will move my efforts to whatever I feel is the next best OS available.<BR> I will add that I feel that should the best way to crack the M$ unfair grip on the market and computer users minds and wallets is for proponents of different OSs and interface preferences to co-operate and show the rest of the world the restrictions Microsoft (ie-Mr. Gates, who has set policy) has tried place on them for it's own financial benefit, is to work with each other to ensure as much inter-operability as possible between operating systems. You should be able to choose the way you want your system to work, it should not be dictated to you by someones greed.<BR> I pay for BeOS (Pro Edition), and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, because I feel it is my best choice.

The sad fact, however, is that Be no longer considers BeOS a revenue source (go back and read the focus switch announcements again if you're not sure about that), and is acting accordingly. Look how many developers, large and small, have dropped projects because of Be's lack of concern for the desktop. The sad fact is that BeOS is just gliding along with the only momentum supplied by its connection to BeIA. Even BeIA features may or may not be reworked into BeOS if they are developed in coordination with a hardware partner.<P>So from my view, while Be hasn't explicitly killed BeOS, it has turned down the IV to a very slow drip. In contrast, QSSL is expanding its focus from embedded systems to desktop platforms. RTP's similarities to Linux are intentional; things like full Posix compliance ease the transition of developers and applications. Like Be, QSSL wants self-hosted development environment for embedded systems, IAs, etc. The difference is one of direction. Be moved away from the desktop to devote *full* attention to BeIA. Recall that the promised enhancements to BeOS, like BONE, were underway well *before* the focus switch, not something begun since then. QSSL expanded (not moved -- focus enlargement, not switch) from embedded systems *toward* the desktop.<P>Having said that, QSSL isn't necessarily \"pushing\" the desktop market. That opportunity is basically for third-party developers. But here again the contrast to Be is striking. Sure, the occassional Be engineer contributes to BeOS forums, but top QSSL staff are actually active members of the Phoenix Platform Consortium, which is the group working to help make RTP (among other alt OSs) a place on the desktop. And QSSL is very responsive. They *want* feedback and input. This is the exact opposite of the situation with Be, and this alone is very telling regarding the future of these two operating systems.<P>BeOS is great technology. I've run it and enjoyed it since the DR releases; but Be basically let it go, turning promotion and sales over to a few small outside companies and advocacy over to the remaining fans. This isn't the way to build a market presence. It's amazing how hard Be users hold on despite the Be snub -- another testimony to the technology itself.<P>But RTP has the potential to be everything BeOS is; remember it's at an early beta stage. The hooks are there for what's needed, but the solutions still have to be implemented in many cases. So people making comparisons should be aware of the current status of both BeOS and QNX RTP.<P>-- gary_c\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#38\n\nI think overall it was a very nice introductory article, so thank you, but I thought I'd mention a few other things. I'm a longtime BeOS user, and I tried out QNX's RTP for a little while; it's a nice system, but not as advanced. These certainly aren't the only important omissions, but a few of the more apparent ones:<BR><BR>1. BeOS has far superior filetyping to any other OS out there. It uses MIME typing instead of file extensions (although you can use those, too, if you like). This isn't just a theoretically cool feature; it's very useful. You can easily say \"all picture files should open in this particular image viewer except JPGs, which should open in this application. Oh, and this particular image should open in the photo editor\" and other things of that nature. Furthermore, if you right-click on a file, you'll get an \"Open With...\" submenu. This is extremely useful if you want, say, HTML files to open in your browser in general when double-clicked on, but right now you wish to edit the HTML file in your HTML editor. Of course, the \"Open With...\" menu is dynamically generated live, so no configuration is needed. Be's filetyping system is truly beautiful; QNX doesn't offer anything like it.<BR><BR>2. BFS provides very nice attribute abilities. For example, I have \"Artist\", \"Title\", \"Playing Time\", etc. attributes for all my MP3s, which can then easily be sorted and queried in the system's file manager (Tracker). E-mail messages have \"From\", \"Subject\", \"Date\", etc. attributes and can likewise be sorted and searched upon. Furthermore, it is very easy for users to add their own attributes; \"Comments\", \"To Do\", or anything else you can think of. I want to play all songs made in 1989? Easy. I want to find all e-mail messages sent by my brother? Again, easy. QNX offers nothing comparable, nor does any other system.<BR><BR>3. Regarding hardware support, I think I'd have to disagree with the article's conclusion. When I tried RTP (please correct me if this has changed since), it didn't support my USB mouse. Be, however, does and natively supports mouse wheels (for most mice; most USB mouse wheels don't work yet). Furthermore, the BeOS supports a variety of gamepads, joysticks, cameras, and TV cards built-in, and when you factor in third-party drivers, add in scanners, even more gamepads, more video/sound cards, printers, etc; even DVD video is now available (albeit still rough). It's also worth mentioning that the BeOS currently supports hardware-accelerated OpenGL for Voodoo cards; it's just not nearly as fast or complete as the new OpenGL stack will hopefully be. Figuring all this in, I don't see how QNX's support could possibly be seen as better.<BR><BR>Regardless of these oversights, thank you for an excellent introductory article! I would love to see a 10-page or so article detailing many other things (font system, multi-lingual support, media capabilities, etc. etc.) if you ever have the time.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)\n\nMar 6, 2001\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#39\n\nSony is aiming playstation 2 basically as a computer. They want it to Be (pardon the pun) the hub for multimedia over broadband. Be needs to port Be OS to the emotion engine and Sony needs to use it. Sony should include it with the hard drive they're going going to ship this summer. The head of Sony has gone on record for his strong dislike of Microsoft. He said that if Microsoft was going to get into the game box business with xbox then sony will get into the os business. This is going to be a war. Be would be a great fit for Sony.\n\nUpvote\n\n0 (0 / 0)"
