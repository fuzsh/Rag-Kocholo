When you leave our Websites, our terms and policies no longer govern. You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third-Party Website, and should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party.\n\nGraves Bros and you agree that these Terms of Use affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.\n\nIn the event of a dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or in connection with your access to, and/or use of our Websites, Graves Bros or you must give the other notice of the dispute, claim, or controversy which notice will include a brief written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, claim, or controversy and the relief requested. You must send any such notice to Graves Bros by email to info@GravesBros.com AND by U.S. Mail to:\n\nAttn: Marketing\n\nGraves Bros Home Improvement\n\n755 Winton Rd. North\n\nRochester, NY 14609\n\nTo the extent that Graves Bros has your contact information, it will send any such notice to you by U.S. Mail, or otherwise to your email address. Graves Bros and you will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days from the date that any notice of dispute, claim, or controversy is sent. Graves Bros and you shall use reasonable, good faith, efforts to settle any dispute, claim, or controversy through consultation and good faith negotiations. After 30 days, Graves Bros or you may resort to the other alternatives described below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice and 30 day negotiation period required by this paragraph shall not apply, however, to disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of our websites.\n\nExcept as otherwise specifically set forth below, any dispute, claim, or controversy of any kind between Graves Bros and you arising under these Terms of Use or in connection with your access to, and/or use of our Websites, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through our Websites, if unresolved through informal discussions within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice, shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in the State of New York. Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of our Websites shall not be subject to arbitration.\n\nFor residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of New York and Graves Bros and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in the State of New York to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n\nThe arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Use, and administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and fee information are available at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\n\nGraves Bros shall bear the cost of any arbitration filing fees and arbitration fees for claims of up to $75,000, unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, but not limited to attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless Graves Bros is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. For claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Graves Bros and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. Graves Bros and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation, motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney’s fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Graves Bros and you agree not to seek any attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim or defense was frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose. Graves Bros and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Graves Bros and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. Graves Bros and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\n\nIf your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less, and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.\n\nYou may choose to pursue your claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over Graves Bros and you otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where your claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.\n\nIf any clause within these arbitration provisions is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from these arbitration provisions, and the remainder of the arbitration provisions will be given full force and effect. In the event some or all of these arbitration provisions are determined to be unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim, dispute or controversy is brought that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of these arbitration provisions, Graves Bros and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.\n\nThe terms of these arbitration provisions will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent or affiliated company of Graves Bros to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of our Websites, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or products on or through our Websites. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.\n\nPlease review our Privacy Policy for an explanation of our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used."
