        "text": "1. Haiku Operating System\n\n2. Haiku is a free open source operating system compatible with BeOS . Its development began in 2001, and the operating system became self-hosting in 2008, [2] with the first official alpha version released in September 2009 and the second Alpha release in May 2010.\n\n3. History of haiku Haiku began as the OpenBeOS project in 2001, the year that Be, Inc. was bought by Palm, Inc. and BeOS development was discontinued; the focus of the project was to support the BeOS user community by creating an open-source backward-compatible replacement for BeOS. The first project by OpenBeOS was a 2002 community-created &quot;stop-gap&quot; update for BeOS 5.0.3. In 2003, a non-profit organization\n\n4. (Haiku Inc.) was registered in Rochester, New York to financially support development, and in 2004, after a notification of infringement upon Palm's trademark on the BeOS name was sent to OpenBeOS, the project was renamed as Haiku . Development, however, would only reach its first milestone in September 2009 with the release of Haiku Alpha 1. This very first release was followed by Alpha 2 R1 released in May 2010 which contains more than 300 bug-fixes/improvements.\n\n5. Development of haiku Haiku is developed in C++ and provides an object-oriented API. The modular design of BeOS allowed individual components of Haiku to initially be developed in teams in relative isolation, in many cases developing them as replacements for the BeOS components prior to the completion of other parts of the operating system. The original teams developing these components, including both servers and APIs (collectively known in Haiku as &quot;kits&quot;), included: App/Interface – develops the Interface , App and Support kits. BFS – develops the Be File System , which is mostly complete with the resulting OpenBFS Game – develops the Game Kit and its APIs. Input Server – the server that handles input devices, such as keyboards and mice and how they communicate with other parts of the system.\n\n6. Kernel – develops the kernel , the core of the operating system. Media – develops the audio server and related APIs. MIDI – implements the MIDI protocol. Network – writes drivers for network devices and APIs relating to networking. OpenGL – develops OpenGL support. Preferences – recreates the preferences suite.\n\n7. Printing – works on the print servers and drivers for printers. Screen Saver – implements screen saver functionality. Storage – develops the storage kit and drivers for required filesystems. Translation – recreates the reading/writing/conversion modules for the different file formats. A few kits have been deemed feature complete and the rest are in various stages of development. The Haiku kernel is a modular hybrid kernel and a fork of NewOS [3] , a modular kernel written by former Be Inc. engineer Travis Geiselbrecht. Like the rest of the system it is currently still under heavy development. Many features have been implemented, including a virtual file system (VFS) layer and rudimentary symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support.\n\n10. Compatibility with BeOS Haiku aims to be compatible with BeOS at both the source and binary level, allowing software written and compiled for BeOS to compile and run without modification on Haiku. This would provide Haiku users with an instant library of applications to choose from (even programs whose developers were no longer in business or had no interest in updating them), in addition to allowing development of other applications to resume from where they had been terminated following the demise of Be, Inc. This dedication to compatibility also has its drawbacks though, requiring Haiku to use version 2.95 of the compiler GCC , which is 9 years old. [4] Switching to using the newer GCC version 4 breaks compatibility with BeOS software, therefore Haiku supports being built as a hybrid GCC4/GCC2 environment. [5] This allows the use of both GCC version 2 and version 4 binaries at the same time.\n\n11. Note this compatibility is only valid for x86 systems. The PPC version of BeOS R5 will not be supported. As a consequence, the ARM, 68k and PowerPC ports of Haiku use only the gcc4 compiler. Despite these attempts, compatibility with a number of system add-ons which use private APIs will not be implemented. These include additional filesystem drivers and media codec add-ons, although the only affected add-ons for BeOS R5 not easily re-implemented are Indeo 5 media decoders for which no specification exists. Printing – works on the print servers and drivers for printers. Screen Saver – implements screen saver functionality. Storage – develops the storage kit and drivers for required filesystems. Translation – recreates the reading/writing/conversion modules for the different file formats. A few kits have been deemed feature complete and the rest are in various stages of development.

Low-level device drivers, namely for storage devices and SCSI adapters will not be compatible. USB drivers for both the second (BeOS 5) and third (BeOS Dano) generation USB stacks will work, however. On some other points, Haiku is already more advanced than BeOS. For example the interface kit allows using a layout system to automatically place widgets in windows, while on BeOS the developer had to specify the exact position of each widget by hand. This allows for GUIs that will render correctly with any font size, and also makes localization of applications much easier, as a longer string in a translated language will make the widget grow, instead of being partly invisible if the widget size was fixed."
