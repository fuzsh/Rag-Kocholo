In addition, Dutch Bros® offers an online subscription service (the \"Subscription\") for certain Goods, including single serve DB cups and coffee beans (the \"Subscription Products\"). By submitting a completed order form for a Subscription for the Subscription Products, you offer to purchase the Subscription you select and submit to Dutch Bros® through the online order form. Dutch Bros® may accept your order by sending you an electronic order confirmation that your order has been accepted. Dutch Bros® may reject your order in its sole discretion.\n\nFor all charges for any Goods sold on the Services, Dutch Bros® will bill your credit card or alternative payment method offered by Dutch Bros® or our designated service providers. You understand that we may hold and store your payment information to facilitate payment and future charges. You agree to provide valid and updated payment information and you represent to us that you are the authorized user of the card or payment account. Dutch Bros® may add or remove available payment methods at any time in its sole discretion. In the event legal action is necessary to collect on balances due, you agree to reimburse Dutch Bros® for all expenses incurred to recover sums due, including attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses. You are responsible for purchase of, and payment of charges for, all Internet access and cellular data services needed for use of these Services and any and all fees charged to you by your financial institution related to the charges.

Dutch Bros® may suspend or terminate your account, in addition to other rights and remedies, if fees are past due. You shall provide Dutch Bros® with written notice of any disputed charges within ten (10) business days of the date of the charge. Notice of the dispute must provide in reasonable detail a statement of the basis for disputing the charge.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION DETAILS\n\nThe Subscription is for the delivery of Dutch Bros® Subscription Products at scheduled intervals and quantities of your choosing. We currently offer delivery intervals of every 15, 30, 45, and 60 days. The quantity of Subscription Products in each delivery will be based on the initial quantity you select on the order form.\n\nAll Subscriptions will automatically renew for the same period and quantity as your initial Subscription, unless you cancel or modify your Subscription as set forth in these Terms. You may cancel your Subscription at any time prior to the estimated shipment date for the next renewal period in order to avoid automatic Subscription renewal and the next billing cycle. If you do not cancel your Subscription as set forth in these Terms, we will bill the applicable Subscription fee for the renewal Subscription, plus any applicable taxes and fees.\n\nIt is very important to understand that you will not receive a notice from Dutch Bros® that your Subscription is going to automatically renew, and if you wish to avoid charges for a renewal Subscription, you must cancel your Subscription as set forth in these Terms. You can cancel or modify your Subscription by e-mailing Dutch Bros® at [email protected] or logging into your shop.dutchbros.com account and following the cancellation/modification instructions.\n\nPRODUCTS AND SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDetails of the Goods available for purchase are set out on the Services. All prices are displayed and charged in US dollars. All applicable sales and other taxes are in addition to the sale price. Discounts and sales prices may not be applied to previous orders. We reserve the right to shorten the duration of any special order or sales promotion. All features, content, specifications, products and prices of Goods described or depicted on these Services are subject to change at any time without notice.\n\nDutch Bros® attempts to describe its Goods as accurately as possible. However, Dutch Bros® does not warrant that descriptions of the Goods are accurate, complete, current, or error-free. All features, content, specifications, Goods, and prices described on the Services are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and provided for convenience purposes only. Packaging may vary from that shown. We make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our Goods, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your device will accurately display such colors.\n\nThe inclusion of any Goods on the Services at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these Goods be available at any time, and we reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any Goods and/or refuse service to any customer. Occasionally, the manufacture or distribution of certain Goods may be delayed for a number of reasons. In such an event, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the delay and keep you informed of the revised delivery schedule. By placing an order, you represent that the Goods ordered will be used only in a lawful manner and in accordance with these terms.\n\nDELIVERY\n\nWhen an order is placed, it will be shipped to an address designated by you as long as that shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on the Services. A delivery fee may apply to Goods delivered to you by Dutch Bros® and by placing an order, you agree to pay such fee. All purchases from the Services are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for items purchased from the Services pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments. If delivery is available, Dutch Bros® will estimate the time of delivery; however, Dutch Bros® does not guarantee any particular delivery date and disclaims any liability for delays.\n\nRETURNS\n\nYou may return Goods purchased from the Services in the event that the Goods are defective, or for any reason, with 45 days of the date of your order.

The Program is accessible through the Dutch Bros™ mobile application (“Dutch Bros™ App”). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use or access the Program or Dutch Bros™ App.\n\nBy participating in the Program you have the opportunity to collect points and Dutch Rewards™ benefits and other offers (“Rewards”) that may be redeemed at participating Dutch Bros Coffee® shops. Dutch Bros® is not responsible for any temporary inability to access or redeem points or Rewards. Points and Rewards have no cash value, cannot be redeemed for cash or any other form of credit, and have no value until presented for redemption in accordance with these Terms. You have no ownership interest in accrued points or Rewards, and accrued points and Rewards do not constitute your property. Points, Rewards, and Program accounts may not be purchased, sold, transferred, bequeathed, inherited, or assigned, except as permitted through any feature of the Dutch Bros™ App; any unauthorized transfers shall be deemed a violation of these Terms. You may have only one (1) Program account that is personal to you. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have more than one account we may suspend or terminate any of your accounts, and you will immediately forfeit all points and Rewards. You may not use another’s account without permission. Use of the word “earn” in these Terms, in the Dutch Bros™ App, or in our promotional materials in relation to the Program, points, or Rewards shall mean “collect” and shall not mean that points or Rewards have any value until they are presented for redemption in accordance with these Terms. Taxing authorities may determine that points or Rewards received through participation may be subject to tax liability. In that case, any tax liability, including disclosure obligations, connected with the receipt and/or use of the points or Rewards is your responsibility.\n\nHow to Sign Up. Download the Dutch Bros™ App on your mobile phone or tablet from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Create a Program account within the Dutch Bros™ App by following the prompts and providing the following information:\n\n1. First and last name;\n\n2. Email address;\n\n3. Phone number;\n\n4. Birthdate; and\n\n5. Password.\n\nHow to Collect and Redeem Rewards. Points may be redeemed for Rewards within the Dutch Bros™ App. To collect points you must (1) make a Qualifying Purchase (defined below), (2) at a participating Dutch Bros Coffee® shop, and (3) scan your Program account QR code (available in the Dutch Bros™ App) when paying through the Dutch Bros™ App, with a Dutch Bros® gift card, or with another payment method. ®\"Qualifying Purchases\" are all products purchased at a participating Dutch Bros Coffee® shop, excluding Rewards redemptions, purchase or reload of a Dutch Bros® gift card, donations, sales tax, and tips. Only the customer making the Qualifying Purchase through the Dutch Bros™ App with their Program account may collect points. Points will not be collected for past purchases, purchases made while not an authorized participant of the Program, or for purchases that do not comply with these Terms or other terms and conditions provided in connection with the Program.\n\nYou may collect three (3) points for every one dollar ($1) (USD) spent on Qualifying Purchases at participating Dutch Bros Coffee® shops. You may view your accumulated points balance and Rewards by signing into your Program account in the Dutch Bros™ App. When you redeem points for Rewards, the number of points used to redeem the Reward will be subtracted from your points balance, regardless of whether the Rewards have been redeemed. Rewards will be removed from your Program account when redeemed at a participating Dutch Bros Coffee® shop.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty (250) points are required to redeem a Free Medium Drink Reward. Three hundred and twenty-five (325) points are required to redeem a Free “any size” Drink Reward (up to 32 oz.). Each respective Reward may be redeemed at a participating Dutch Bros Coffee® shop, is only valid for one (1) redemption, and is subject to the expiration terms provided below.\n\nFrom time to time, we may, in our sole discretion, run special promotions where you have the opportunity to collect additional points and/or Rewards for select Qualifying Purchases made through the Dutch Bros™ App. These promotions must be activated prior to participation (as outlined below.) We reserve the right to exclude products from special promotion eligibility and modify the points or Rewards you collect for special promotions.\n\nActivation of additional points and/or Rewards related to special promotions:\n\nEligibility: If you qualify for any special promotions, these will be displayed on your Dutch Bros™ App homepage, specifically under the points dial section.\n\nActivation Process: To participate in the special promotion, the \"Activate\" button located alongside the special promotion on your Dutch Bros™ App homepage. Activation must occur before you engage in any activities related to the special promotion.\n\nCompletion: Upon successful completion of the special promotion's requirements, the associated additional points and/or Rewards will be credited to your Dutch Rewards™ account. Please note that failure to activate the promotion prior to participation will result in forfeiture of the associated additional points and/or Rewards.\n\nHow to Share Rewards. Eligible Rewards may be shared through the Dutch Bros™ App with other Dutch Rewards™ Program users. To share Rewards, select “Tap for Details” under the eligible Reward that you would like to Share and select “Share Reward”. Next, select an individual from your list of contacts or manually enter an email or phone number associated, if the information matches with another user’s Program account, then the Reward may be shared. Select “Send Reward” to share the Reward with the selected contract. After sharing the Reward, it will disappear from your Program account and the recipient will be notified of the received “Dutch From a Pal” Reward at the email associated with their account. Shared Rewards cannot be reshared. Shared Rewards retain any expiration date or redemption limitations that may apply, except that the earliest Shared Rewards will expire is approximately 11:59 PM Pacific Time on the fourteenth (14th) day following the date on which the Shared Rewards were shared. Only Rewards redeemed with points may be shared. Rewards for new enrollment, birthdays, and other special or promotional Rewards may not be shared.\n\nSpecial Rewards. When you enroll in the Program as a new user, you will receive one (1) Free Medium Drink Reward. If this new enrollment Reward is not redeemed at a participating Dutch Bros Coffee® shop, then this Reward will automatically expire at approximately 11:59 PM Pacific Time on the one hundred and eightieth (180th) day following the day the Reward was collected. Additionally, by participating in the Program, you will receive one (1) Free “any size” Drink Reward (up to 32 oz.) on your birthday. If this birthday Reward is not redeemed at a participating Dutch Bros Coffee® shop, then this birthday Reward will automatically expire at approximately 11:59 PM Pacific Time on the thirtieth (30th) day following the day the birthday Reward was collected. Upon expiration, birthday Rewards will be automatically removed from your Program account. If you create a Program account on your birthday then you will receive the birthday Reward approximately the day after your account registration.\n\nInactivity and Expiration. Points that you collect are automatically added to your account within approximately twenty-four (24) hours of your Qualifying Purchase and, if not redeemed for Rewards, will automatically expire at approximately 11:59 PM Pacific Time on the one hundred and eightieth (180th) day following the date on which the points were collected. Rewards that you collect by redeeming points, if not redeemed at participating Dutch Bros Coffee® shop or as otherwise permitted, will automatically expire at approximately 11:59 PM Pacific Time on the one hundred and eightieth (180th) day following the date on which the Rewards were collected. Upon expiration, points and Rewards will be automatically removed from your Program account. For example: (1) points that you collected on July 4, 2023, will expire on December 31, 2023 at 11:59 PM Pacific Time; and (2) Rewards that you collected by redeeming points on December 30, 2023 will expire on June 27, 2024 at 11:59 PM Pacific Time, regardless of when the redeemed points were collected. Unless otherwise stipulated in a special Program promotion or offer, in which case the terms of that special promotion or offer will control, points or Rewards that you collect by participating in special promotions or offers are subject to the terms set forth in this section regarding inactivity and expiration.\n\nONLINE ORDERING – ORDER AHEAD\n\nDutch Bros® may make available to you the ability to order online via the Dutch Bros™ App and/or website from our participating Dutch Bros® locations. Minimum order amounts may apply. Any applicable delivery fees, taxes and other amounts due in connection with your order will be identified when you place your order. There may be limits on the dollar values and number of orders that may be placed online. You are responsible for payment of your order by means of a payment option made available online at the time of ordering. We use third party providers and may accept various third party services to process payments. The Dutch Bros® location identified when you place your order is responsible for fulfilling your order and for any questions or other communications regarding your order. Discounts, coupons and other offers may not be able to be combined with online ordering. Every participating location may not have all menu items online. You may be able to customize your online order. You may be able to, and in some circumstances you may be required to, use your Dutch Rewards™ account (or sign up for Dutch Rewards™) in connection with certain online ordering, in which case the Dutch Rewards™ Program terms will also apply.\n\nFraudulent Activity. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any Program account, remove points, remove or reduce your balance, and block or ban any user if we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that the Program account was created, or that any of the points or monetary balance of the Program account were obtained, produced, or acquired, through any fraudulent or illegal activity, whether yours or any third party, including but not limited to any activity that violates these Terms or any applicable local, state, or federal law or regulation. Suspended or terminated accounts may be reactivated by us if we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that the circumstances merit reactivation based on criteria that we choose. Points or monetary balances removed by us due to suspected fraudulent or illegal activity, or via Dutch Bros® gift card purchased through a third-party, will not be reimbursed by us even if the account owner was not aware of the fraudulent or illegal activity. We have no liability to you for any third-party fraud or unlawful activity associated with your Dutch Rewards™ or Program account.\n\nTermination. We reserve the right to terminate your Program account and/or participation in the Program, revoke points and Rewards without notice if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated these Terms (including our Privacy Policy); misused the Program; engaged in physical, verbal, or written abuse or harassment of Dutch Bros® personnel; been refused service at any of our locations; or that your use of the Dutch Bros™ App or your Program account is unauthorized, deceptive, fraudulent, or otherwise unlawful. We further reserve the right to terminate your Program account if for any reason we decide to discontinue or cancel the Dutch Rewards™ Program.\n\nTEXT MESSAGING\n\nDutch Bros® is offering a Short Code Messaging Program (the “Program”), which you agree to use and participate in subject to this section’s terms.

(“TCPA”), or its implementing regulations or any similar term as defined under a state-law equivalent to the TCPA.\n\nMessage and data rates may apply.

It affects your rights.\n\nPlease read this Provision carefully. It provides that, except as specified in this Provision, all Disputes (as defined below) between you and Dutch Bros® shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution and replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).\n\nFor purposes of this Provision, “Dutch Bros®” means Dutch Mafia, LLC. and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Dutch Bros® regarding, arising out of or relating to any aspect of your relationship with Dutch Bros®, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable cause of action or claim for relief, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Dutch Bros’ licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.\n\nYOU AND DUTCH BROS® EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.\n\nPre-Arbitration Claim Resolution\n\nYou agree that whenever you have a Dispute with Dutch Bros® you will first send a written notice to Dutch Bros® (“Demand”). You agree that the requirements of this Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution section will apply even to disagreements that may have arisen before you accepted these Terms. You must send the Demand to the following address (the “Notice Address”): Dutch Bros Coffee®, Attn: Legal Department, 110 SW 4th St., Grants Pass, OR 97526. The Demand must seek to resolve only your individual Dispute and must be personally signed by you (and not your counsel). Within twenty (20) business days of receipt of a Demand, the recipient may request an individualized video or telephone conference which both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). You agree that you will not take any legal action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until after the period to request a conference expires or, if a conference is requested, 20 business days after the individualized conference. Compliance with this informal dispute resolution procedure section is mandatory and a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. This procedure is essential to providing each of us a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. Any applicable limitations periods and filing fee deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in the process set forth above. A court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration if these requirements have not been met.\n\nExclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out\n\nNotwithstanding the above, you or Dutch Bros® may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to Dutch Bros Coffee®, Attn: Legal Department, 110 SW 4th St., Grants Pass, OR 97526. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Dutch Bros® through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Dutch Bros®. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.\n\nArbitration Procedures\n\nIf this Provision applies and if the disagreement stated in the Demand is not resolved to your satisfaction within ten (10) business days after the conference described above (or within ten (10) business days after the time when such a conference may be requested if no conference has been requested), and you intend on taking legal action, you agree that you will file a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (the “Arbitrator”). The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator with the AAA under its rules, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules available at www.adr.org or 1-800-778-7879. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.\n\nBecause the Platform and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.\n\nArbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party or if required by applicable law. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA or other applicable law, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.\n\nLocation of Arbitration – You or Dutch Bros® may initiate arbitration in either Josephine County, Oregon or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address. However, if Dutch Bros® initiates the arbitration in Josephine County, you shall have the right to have the arbitration transferred to the AAA office within the judicial district that includes your billing address.\n\nPayment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – Dutch Bros® will pay all arbitration filing fees and hearing fees and any arbitrator's hearing fees, costs and expenses upon your written request to the arbitrator given at or before the first evidentiary hearing in the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Dutch Bros® as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.\n\nClass Action Waiver\n\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND DUTCH BROS® SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION, ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION UNLESS THE MASS ARBITRATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH BELOW ARE TRIGGERED. NEITHER YOU NOR DUTCH BROS® MAY ACT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, NOR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of the Platform can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.\n\nNo Judge or Jury in Arbitration\n\nArbitration does not involve a judge or jury. You understand and agree that by entering into these Terms you and Dutch Bros® are each giving up the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and Dutch Bros® might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.\n\nMass Arbitration\n\nIf, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Demands or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against Dutch Bros®, and such circumstances meet the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (“Mass Filing”) set forth in National Arbitration & Mediation’s (“NAM”) Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (“NAM’s Mass Filing Rules,” available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and Dutch Bros® agree that AAA shall not serve as Arbitrator and that instead NAM shall administer any Mass Filing claims and the NAM Mass Filing Rules in effect at the time such claim is filed shall apply as modified below. You agree that throughout this process, the parties' counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. You acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of your dispute might be delayed.\n\nStage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Dutch Bros® shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Dutch Bros® will pay the mediator’s fee.\n\nStage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Dutch Bros® shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Dutch Bros® will pay the mediator’s fee.\n\nStage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Dutch Bros® shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge.\n\nIf your Claim is not resolved as part of the staged process identified above, either:\n\nOption One: You and we may separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with these Terms of Use. You may opt out of arbitration by sending us your individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out by certified mail addressed to the Notice Address. Such an opt-out notice must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to opt out of arbitration within 30 days after the conclusion of Stage 3 or the elective mediation associated with Stage 3. We may opt your claim out of arbitration by sending an individual, personally signed notice of our intention to opt out to your counsel within 14 days after the expiration of your 30-day opt out period. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.\n\nOR\n\nOption Two: If neither you nor we elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 200, then 200 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 200, then all of those claims will be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims will not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor will any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 200 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator, as such term is used in the NAM Rules) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim will proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with these Terms of Use. You and we agree that each party values the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wishes to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between the parties. You and we acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases. If any part of this Mass Arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the NAM rules, then the balance of this Mass Arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein unless the lack of such provision would lead this Mass Arbitration provision to fail of its essential purpose.\n\nSeverability\n\nIf any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court.\n\nContinuation\n\nThis Provision shall survive the termination of your service with Dutch Bros® or its affiliates. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Dutch Bros® makes any change to this Provision (other than a change to Dutch Bros.’ notice address), you may reject any such change and require Dutch Bros® to adhere to the present language in this Provision as of the day you entered into these Terms if a dispute between us arises.\n\nDISCLAIMERS\n\nYOUR USE OF THESE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
