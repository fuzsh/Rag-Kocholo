        "text": "The FSF are ideological in their definition of “free software” so according to them, very few distros will meet their requirements. Nevertheless, openSUSE and others are “free software” and comply with the terms of the GPL (v2/v3) though they also offer “freeware” (not to be confused with “free software”) which may be proprietary, like Adobe Reader and Flash\n\nThere is no “false” GNU/Linux distro around. Every distro that uses the GNU bits (coreutils/gcc/findutils/etc) as a base is a GNU Linux distro. The FSF are just too ideological in such cases\n\nReal free software is a software that completely complies with a free software license, be it GPL, BSD or MIT, Apache, etc. 99% of openSUSE does so with the GPL, only the few bits it offers doesn’t so I don’t see a good reason not to call it a free software distro\n\nPrecisely. Well said, although with strong opinions being held on this matter, this probably should have gone into the “Soapbox” section.\n\nTo the original poster: I say it doesn’t matter. True GNU™ types can’t seem to accept that F/OSS did NOT take off and grow in popularity because of their extremely restrictive license. (GNU and the GPL have been around for decades.) F/OSS has become popular as new licenses, which permit the authors to make money while still providing the source code, have become predominant.\n\nJust look at the most popular F/OSS software: Mozilla and OpenOffice, for example – neither of which is GPL.\n\nGNU’s vision is for a future where all software is completely free, completely redistributable and totally unencumbered. While that’s a lofty goal, it’s just not practical in a real world where people need to eat and pay bills. Richard Stallman correctly argues that people can charge for software under the GPL, but ignores simple economic realities: after it has been sold that one time, it can be redistributed infinitely with no further income to the original author.\n\nSure, it annoys me that hardware manufacturers want to keep their inner workings secret. It irritates me that I have to use “binary blob” drivers to make my video work at max performance, for example. But as Linus Torvalds himself as pointed out, that’s their choice. End users will vote on whether that’s the right decision.\n\nTrue GNU™ types would love for all of us just to stop using anything that’s not 100% GPL-licensed. I use what works. Adobe provides a good example: in my job, I have a lot of technical data in PDF form. None of the available free PDF readers (and I’ve tried them all) is anywhere near as good as Acrobat Reader. Frankly, I’m very glad that they offer that as a free download, and that they’ve published enough of the spec for PDF files that people can roll their own, if they like. But if I choose to use the clearly superior Acrobat Reader, I am not the least bit interested in the whinings and finger-pointing from the Bearded Priests of the Revolution at the GNU Foundation, who feel like I’ve somehow betrayed “the movement.”\n\nCan you tell this is something I feel strongly about?\n\nI have to emphasize on one point here.\n\nEven if they are not used by a lot of people and even if they might look “funny” for some people, such distributions serve an important purpose by showing where there is still a lack of completely free alternatives.\n\nYes, I am using a non-free wireless card (Intel 5300AGN, driver “iwlagn” = 100% free, firmware = binary only), yes I am using a non-free driver for my graphics card (nvidia Geforce 9600MT), but I am also aware of the fact, that closed source components very often cause trouble as they are developed outside the extremely fast moving stuff in mainline, consequently having (in most cases) longer “response times” until a problem gets fixed.\n\nAt least for the graphics card driver, I surely will switch to a free alternative (nouveau) the moment it gets usable (even if it still might lack some of the features or be a little slower than the prorietary one), I did this before (fglrx vs. radeon) and it served me well (especially regarding stability issues).\n\nA switch to a “completely free” alternative of the iwlagn-driver is very unlikely, the driver itself is free and already in the mainline kernel, intel is very actively involved into linux development, still there is this binary only firmware which could be faulty or insecure and only intel is able to fix problems there and not only I would be glad if they could open up in that direction, too.\n\nOn Wed, 2009-09-23 at 10:26 +0000, BrownieCat wrote:\n\n> Is openSUSE free software as defined by the Free Software Foundation?

So you can get openSUSE with just\n\nOSS software… then it’s your choice if you want to add the non-OSS\n\nparts to it.\n\nFSF is weird. Sometimes not very consistent. About the only way to be\n\ntruly consistent with FSF is to make sure ALL of your distro is purely\n\nunder some kind of GPL… and now, FSF probably will only accept GPLv3\n\n(which means NO Linux can be accepted).\n\nSo… if I can speak for FSF (which I cannot), I’d say unless everything\n\nis GPLv3, then it’s not truly free according to the FSF.\n\nI also find this statement quite a bit odd:\n\ngNewSense is considered by the Free Software Foundation to be a true GNU/Linux distribution.\n\nHow do they (FSF) define a “true” distribution of GNU/Linux?\n\nAnd why do they speak for one part (Linux) which in contrast to maybe GNU is not part of their project?\n\nIt might be a “true” (unchanged) GNU distribution, but certainly is not a “true” Linux distribution as it does not fully distribute Linux but actually removes parts of the “Linux distribution”, parts which are considered to be “non-free” to GNU standards (which in most/all cases will certainly be correct) but are still part of “Linux”.\n\nIf this “true” is only present in Wikipedia, then it’s maybe just a little too much “artistic freedom” for an article in an encyclopedia.\n\n//Edit:\n\nhttp://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html\n\nOK, WP screwed that one up.\n\nRather than imposing on the users, openSUSE allows users to make their own choices by clearly labelling what software is OSS and what is not. The fact that much of the openSUSE ecosystem does not conform to the FSF guidelines is a result of user choice and not of decisions made by SUSE or openSUSE as such.\n\nSUSE has always been free in the sense that it used to be issued free after a period of selling a distribution commercially; openSUSE was deliverately set up as a community distribution - so the question of buying SUSE or openSUSE has never really risen unless you want support - in which case you are buying support, not SUSE or openSUSE."
