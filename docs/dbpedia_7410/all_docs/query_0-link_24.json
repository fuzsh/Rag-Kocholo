        "text": "https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html\n\nAfter reviewing the Free Software Foundation’s website in search of potential new distros, I came across this little statement near the bottom of a page as to why the Foundation does not endorse Haiku as truly free software. “Haiku includes some software that you’re not allowed to modify. It also includes nonfree firmware blobs”.\n\nI am wondering if the Haiku team plans on making Haiku 100% Libre/GNU in the future, or at least keep the amount of proprietary code to a minimum?. As corporations creep ever closer into Linux space, I believe we shouldn’t forget how important truly free and open software is for security and privacy purposes.\n\nRight now, the only closed-source components in the default install is liblayout (previously all of WonderBrush was closed-source and proprietary, but it was open sourced last week, so, we’re now down to just one thing.) You can of course uninstall these (or use a nightly build where they are not installed by default) and then you will be running no closed-source code.\n\nI’m not sure what this refers to. I guess the Be Book? That’s “documentation” not “software”, though…\n\nOtherwise, aside from WiFi firmware blobs which all major (except whatever “FSF-approved” distros there are) Linux distros ship by default, and FreeBSD/OpenBSD require only one command to set up, we don’t have any closed source code, not even graphics drivers.\n\nThe FSF is fine with the MIT license:\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.fr.html#Expat\n\nThey would prefer Apache 2.0 which has additional guarantees about patents, but still.\n\nAs for Open Source vs Free Software, remember that people who created the FSF and the OSI agree on the concepts and will tell you it’s the exact same thing. But for some reason people will tell they are part of one but not the other.\n\nHow can you be “against open source”? Companies understood that the model can work, and they are trying to join. They may make errors (so does individuals, sometimes). Just as when some individual starts contributing to a project, you have to guide them and help them do better.\n\nI hope we can build a world where open source takes off and companies manage to make a living out of it. Yes, they will try to apply their old schemes. Yes, what anyone does is never enough. But, there’s progress, at least.\n\nNow if you ask me, I’ll tell you that I’m part of Open Source, not Free Software. Because I’m not fighting for anything. This is not a war. I’m just trying to bring better workflows, more collaboration, and eventually better software. I’ll collaborate with everyone who wants to join, company or not. I’m not here to fight with anyone who disagrees, I’ll just try to prove them wrong and hope they change their mind.\n\nTo me, there’s a very real quandary here – enough it can cause debate within the open source community.\n\nOn one side, if you remove everything even smacking of non-free tenets inside, including useful, but closed, firmware/modules for networking and GPU cards and the like, you end up with a possibly unusable system, (unless you find hardware from a dedicated vendor that totally complies to this standard like the 100% free software does.)\n\nOn the other side of accepting non-free stuff for the sake of convenience, yes, there is a gradient of compromise. And with that, the growing threat of non-free Titans thoroughly abusing the freedoms of Free Software and taking advantage of it under a guise of ‘open source’ at free developers’ expense. This is more than quite unfair; it is perhaps even exploitation. And it pushes the world closer to a New World Order akin to all the dystopian titles of lore.\n\nBut I personally think Haiku needs to continue to offer wireless firmware(s), and Linux distributions need to offer a welcoming experience as well, so long as the user knows of it. And I think install-wifi-firmwares or the ‘Restricted Drivers’ wizards on at least one popular distro of Gnu/Linux makes this distinction clear to the user. True, we lose some pure freedom this way, but if we don’t, we lose usability… and users, which I think is much more important.\n\nSo, I guess in adding my own little opinion to this, I see the FSF position as being more iconic and more to ‘set an example’ than I do as practical. It borders on an extreme viewpoint… but I can see why. They want to ensure the world does not forget why there is Free Software. And with the likes of MS in the OSI and Linux Foundation now, there needs to be a balance of voices out there.\n\nAs for myself, I don’t know where I stand, really, other than to have hardware and software Coexistence. I think that’s the best way forward. I have used and use Apple products (though with SIP, then SB on T2, then even more hardware lockdown than before, that may change soon!), and also use Haiku and Gnu/Linux all at the same time. All three systems I truly believe have their advantages, and there is much we can learn from each.\n\nIn the end, I don’t know. But I do know Haiku has done what it can to be and is Free Software, even if the FSF doesn’t think so. (Personally, I think if the FSF really cares about having full control over the idea of Free Software, they should go ahead and finish the Hurd and have their own finished, ‘true’ OS as their flagship product instead of trying to exist on Linux – and build a GnuTop, GnuBook, or something on a non-x86 architecture, rather than silliness like Gluglug, etc.) Overall, really, there’s my full opinion or ‘two cents’ on it."
