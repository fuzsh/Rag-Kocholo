        "text": "ACC—Advanced Cellular Coexistence Advanced Cellular Coexistence (ACC) maximizes the performance of access points by minimizing interference from 3G/4G/LTE networks, distributed antenna systems and commercial small cell/femtocell equipment. AP—access point In a wireless local area network (WLAN), an access point is a station that transmits and receives data (sometimes referred to as a transceiver). An access point connects users to other users within the network and also can serve as the point of interconnection between the WLAN and a fixed wire network. ARM—Adaptive Radio Management™ Aruba Adaptive Radio Management (ARM) technology employs infrastructure-based controls to optimize Wi-Fi client behavior and automatically ensures that Aruba access points (APs) stay clear of interference, resulting in a more reliable, higher performance wireless LAN infrastructure. ASIC—Application Specific Integrated Chip An ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) is a microchip designed for a special application, such as a particular kind of transmission protocol or a hand-held computer. You might contrast it with general integrated circuits, such as the microprocessor and the random access memory chips in your PC. BIOS—basic input/output system BIOS (basic input/output system) is the program a personal computer's microprocessor uses to get the computer system started after you turn it on. It also manages data flow between the computer's operating system and attached devices such as the hard disk, video adapter, keyboard, mouse and printer. BLE—Built-in Bluetooth Low-Energy Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless technology developed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) for short-range communication. In contrast with previous Bluetooth flavors, BLE has been designed as a low-power solution for control and monitoring applications. BLE is the distinctive feature of the Bluetooth 4.0 specification. BURA—backup, recovery, and archive (information life cycle management and data protection) Backup, recovery, and archive (BURA) solutions combine the functionality and management of storage area networks (SANs), data protection and archiving software, and scaling tools to integrate tape and disk storage subsystems in the same SAN environment. BYOD—bring your own device BYOD (bring your own device) is the increasing trend toward employee-owned devices within a business. Smartphones are the most common example but employees also take their own tablets, laptops and USB drives into the workplace. CIFS—common internet file system The Common Internet File System (CIFS) is a legacy file-sharing protocol that is used to access files located on remote systems. CIO—Chief information officer Chief information officer (CIO) is an executive job title commonly given to the person at an enterprise in charge of information technology (IT) strategy and the computer systems required to support an enterprise's objectives and goals. CLOS/VoQ—virtual output queue A Clos network is a type of non-blocking, multistage switching architecture that reduces the number of ports required in an interconnected fabric. (VOQ) is the technique used in input-queued switches where rather than keeping all traffic in a single queue, separate queues are maintained for each possible output location."
