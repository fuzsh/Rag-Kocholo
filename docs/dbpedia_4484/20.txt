Song Title: Alhamdulillah

Artis/Band: Too Phat

Album: Too Phat 360

Lyrics:

Chorus

Ult li albi bissaraha (I’m opening up my heart with honesty)

Hayya nab’idil karaha (LetÃ¢â¬â¢s avoid the hated and hatred)

Syakkireena a’ kulli ni’ma (Let’s remain thankful with what we have)

Ba’ ideena anil fattana (Let’s avoid all lies and sins)

Verse 1

I feel the heat

From these 4 candles burning

As I’m staring out the window

In solitude I look at life

From different angles

Thoughts strangled

My mind is suffocatin’

In this truth quest

A greed law

That we abide by is ruthless

Enough will never satisfy

Until we toothless

Filthy millionaires

Are gamblin’ until they muflis

A sad fact of life

But mankind approved this

I gotta call Him

Sajadah is where the booth is

I’ll make it clear that

I ain’t even tryin’ to preach ya

By sharing thoughts I hope

To find a little peace here

I thank Allah for blessing me

To be creative

So here’s a diss for me

For bein’ unappreciative

Wanted a perfect life

Yeah smile then die old

Fame, money, women

Phat cribos and white gold

Drive my own Beemer

Before I hit two six

A straight pink bitin’ toothpicks

Who walk around town wit’ two chicks

And doin’ new hits to woo tricks….

Now that’s wrong

Pleasure from partyin’

And bullshit don’t last long

A lotta yuppies sneakin’

Cars out when dad’s gone

Crackin’ bottles in clubs

Frontin’ designer fashion

But I ain’t about

To trade happiness for a Jag

So stop smilin’ with your ragtop down

Cause for a fact

I don’t care about your money

Or how slick your car

‘Cause no matter how rich and big you are

It’s still Allahuakbar…

Chorus

Ult li albi bissaraha (I’m opening up my heart with honesty)

Hayya nab’idil karaha (LetÃ¢â¬â¢s avoid the hated and hatred)

Syakkireena a’ kulli ni’ma (Let’s remain thankful with what we have)

Ba’ ideena anil fattana (Let’s avoid all lies and sins)

Verse 2

I know that all this

Ain’t the right thing

Partying, chasing moneys

And material things

Flying high

Think nobody gonna

Clip my wings

I’m lying to myself

Knowing that

I’ve been neglecting

Responsibilities

As a healthy Muslim

Riches and loot

Ain’t nothing

We frontin’

Diamonds and scrilla

But forget to say

Alhamdulillah

Made my album a killer

Plan B

Now 2-3 droppin’

And I wish to

Ask for forgiveness

Your guidance

Protection and strength

For humbleness and faith

To make me a better man

Success in foreign lands

Never dreamt of that

I remember being 18

When we started Too Phat

Now let’s go back

Three years before that

Sometimes I forget

Me and my parents

Took a trip with granddad

I remember ’95

While performing Umrah

Made my wish in Mecca

Right in front the Kaabah

Dear God

You made it possible

When facing obstacles

Please let me do good

Before I pass on

In the hospital

And keep reciting

The Testimony of Faith

And find the right way

Out of this life’s maze

Chorus

Ult li albi bissaraha (I’m opening up my heart with honesty)

Hayya nab’idil karaha (LetÃ¢â¬â¢s avoid the hated and hatred)

Syakkireena a’ kulli ni’ma (Let’s remain thankful with what we have)

Ba’ ideena anil fattana (Let’s avoid all lies and sins)

Verse 3

Ay yoÃ¢â¬Â¦

Two candles go out

That’s when

I feel the wind blow

I haven’t met Fatim

For two years

Been livin’ like I’m single

Evaluatin’ all the friendships

Relationship

The reason it’s the tenth year

Is ’cause she’s a patient chick

And as far as friends are concerned

Many I’ve had it all

From those who cried for my pain

To those who plotted my fall

I learned to differentiate

Fakes from the great

Mates from the snakes

Apes wanna beef

Hate’s all it takes

For me to blow

A diss song for you

Not even worthy

As an album filler

So now it’s smiles

And Alhamdulillah

Yeah, love me

Or hate me

This who I am

Look at the past at times

I wish that I was born again

So I can rectify mistakes

And my wrong doings

Attempts on minimizing my sins

Before my story ends

I ain’t no Eddie Murphy

Tryin’ to sound as a holy man

But if I tried to be a better person

Now I prolly can

(Wait…)

Who am I to advise you

I ain’t been the best

Of God’s slaves

Just a poet writin’

What my thought says

A little house

A little car

A little sweet girl

Thank you Lord

I’ll try to slow it down

On the cheap thrills

This song will prolly stir

A little controversy

At least I ain’t be rappin’

Bout the stuff

As tho’ I’m born in Jersey

Stage name is Malique

And lost name is Cairel

Mama told me

Stop complaining too much,

So I will…

Chorus

Ult li albi bissaraha (I’m opening up my heart with honesty)

Hayya nab’idil karaha (LetÃ¢â¬â¢s avoid the hated and hatred)

Syakkireena a’ kulli ni’ma (Let’s remain thankful with what we have)

Ba’ ideena anil fattana (Let’s avoid all lies and sins)

Song Title: Clap To This

Artis/Band: Too Phat

Album: Too Phat 360

Lyrics:

( chorus – lil marissa)

Hey everybody stomp your feet and move your body

Just feel the beat inside you when you clap along

( Malique )

Allow me to complain now, a lotta thangs done changed now

Livin’ the fast lane, I’m touri’ in planes now

And all the spots at cities that we go, we glow

Snaps and autographs after each show

We blowin’ them heads until they brain seen

We off the hook this year but yo we came clean

My main dream ain’t a dream to make it mainstream

To steady gain cream and make ya dame scream

Aight then, then maybe i should quit writin’

Too many starin’ eyeballs have got a kid frightened

But why in the world, should i even pay attention

To lil’ suckers who ain’t even worth a mention?

So imma keep my head up, imma stand strong

And stay creative in providing my fans songs

You dance on, while i rap to this

Lets celebrate the platinum plaque and clap to this, cmon!

( repeat chorus )

( Joe )

Ever since i was a kid just wanted to sing

Pursued my dreams and i kept doing my thang

Is we rap stars now? Yo i don’t know

Am i having a ball now? You best believe so

Always wanted to be able to kick it at live shows

Rip mics in studios and meet some hot oooo… oh oh oh oh

Now we got platinum plaque, we got gold award and hits back to back

Never thought that rap could put us on the map

People rush and get our CDs off the rack

This ‘ish be off the hoop now imma telling you done

All a playa’ like me wanna do is have some fun

And make you bounce to this and make you clap to this

Wave you hands hard till you snap your wrist

Now what this really is?

Now what we all about?

Too Phat Baby make you scream and shout, cmon!

( repeat chorus )

( Malique )

I understand, that fame has a price now

It’s goin’ too high it’s gotta get sliced down

Alotta people say i’m no longer nice now

Ain’t nuttin’ changed though i’m still eatin’ rice, clown

( Joe )

Yeah man, now you know what i feel yo

People front and brown nose just to get near ya

And people think since we got a string of hits

We’ve gone soft i ain’t slowed down one bit

( Malique )

Flip this script in split secs, punk ass it’s hard now

Down wit’ spittin’ ish that’ll rip me off the charts now

A schizo kid who switch fast like a skinkansen

Bustin’ on you punk ass marks for talking nonsense

Rush in your crib fast style is so hardcore

Snatch your ma’s bra then uppercut your paw’s jaw

i sit you down to get familiar with this style

And once i see smiles i gotta bust you’ wit a pisstyle…

( Joe )

Alotta cats wanna spit but can’t even recite poems

They lost star trekkin’ back in time thru twilight zone

Want a piece of me i pull your hair back like combs

Be hitting your chest plates and shattering your dome

Your words ain’t wise and trying too hard to be an intellect

Your side ain’t sick your faq punks are hypochondriacs

Claimin’ underground MCs’,you be dumb found MCs

And flee when you zunk wit my steez

( repeat chorus )

Song Title: Just A Friend

Artis/Band: Too Phat

Album: Too Phat 360

Lyrics:

Verse 1 ( Malique )

have you ever met a gurl that you thought was perfect

you waited for her years ’cause you know she worth it

here’s a lil’ story bout this gurl i knew

since wayback in pre-school sometime in ’82

she had ’em two pony tails and a front tooth missin’

wit’ freckles on her cheeks cause the moms caucasian

up on a tree house is where we chilled together

with carvings on the trunk saying friends forever

she the type who laugh when the normally cried

and when they busy playing house we playin’ bonnie and clyde

in grade school everybody knew we partners in crime

we usta bully kids in playgrounds like all the time

we always seen holdin’ hands to the principal’s office

the naughtiest in town and could no other kid stop us

in highskool she switched her desk next to mine

so we could cheat while doing pop quizes all the time

14th of February ’93

little Jenny said she had a big suprise for me

gave me the very kiss and plus a ring and a card

and said I love you, so I gave her the rest of my heart

a coupla weeks later called her house at 10

the mama said I thought you suppose to be with Jen

I quickly rushed to the crib, she just got out of a van

I’m like yo who was that? oh he’s just a friend…..

Chorus 2X

you, you got what I need

but you say he’s just a friend,

but you say he’s just a friend

Verse2 ( Malique )

so I took Jenny’s word for it at this time

I thought just having a friend it couldnt be no crime

’cause even I have friends and babys that for sho

just like Watson, Hailee, Baby Tash and Joe

so we never talked about that late snack with van man

we rather talk about the future we have planned and

what to name our kids, al-Tarique or Shaymar?

Ayesha, or Tisha for a gurl and maybe even bring our

kids to that little tree house that we chilled at

but then in ’94 I couldnt help it but feel sad

Jenny had to leave me to go get a little knowledge

100 miles away in this place they call college

first coupla months it was cool but then it changed yo

she never called and really acted like a strange ho

one day I called it was picked up by a man

I called again, she picked it up and said hey that’s just a friend

Bridge ( VE )

You know, I know what you been up to

I know you know what you been up to

this guy in her study group’s the one who picked up the call

helpin’ her in chemistry wit cyclohexanol

I got curious and asked her who else in ya team?

she said Ali, Hassan, Noreen and Kareem

the next week I thought of givin’ her a little suprise

but when in front of Jenny’s dorm I cound’t believe my eyes

I say the same ugly van I saw in ’93

I found her room but guess what a brother had to see?

a fella half naked with my gurl on the couch

and baby Jenny moaning, uggg uggh aggh and ouch

so please listen to the message that I sing

don’t ever talk to a gurl who says she just has a friend

Chorus

Verse 3 ( Joe Flizzow )

a lil’ casanova pimp, man I had my flings

hoodrats to goodie hoodies I was lil’ playa king

I’ll tell ya when, my final year in ’96

this hunny new in skool joined my class she really sick

she made her pinafore look like a dress from Rodeo,

and clean white shoes lookin’ Ferra than Gamo’s,

and white blouse seemed whiter than everybody else’s

just like them ads on tv man this hunny was the nicest

I had to step up my game and I told her my name

she said her name was Wanda I found out

that we lived on the same street she moved in 5 blocks down

and after 3 dates and 6 banana splits I had it locked down

we was tight but had this lil’s problem though

‘cos Wanda always acted funny when wit’ Mary Joe

but when I caught’em kissin it wasnt funny no more

baby smiled and just said she’s just a friend yo…….

Chorus
