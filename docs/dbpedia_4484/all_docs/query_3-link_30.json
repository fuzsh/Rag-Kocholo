        "text": "Will I ever get to meet the gurl of my dreams? Black, white, brown, red maybe light green?-Malique\n\ncHAd^dXs pure playaz' network nutty me home\n\nHistory of Making The Group by Online Website and edited by cHAd EmcEe^dX\n\n(2001) The duo who make up Too Phat, Malique, 23 and Joe Flizzow, 21. These two fun-loving guys have created a whole new standard in the production of Malaysian music specifically hip-hop music. One listen to \"Whutthadilly?\" and all its little surprises, you'd know that this production exudes class all the way. The album mixes hip-hop and smooth R&B so brilliantly that it would appeal to both rap music and pop music lovers alike. Highlights of this clever mix of styles are \" Jezzebelle\" featuring Innuendo and \"My,My,My\", the re-make of the Johnny Gill classic and featuring Haze and Sam of Innuendo.\n\nMalique and Joe met through the Internet in early 1998. They found out they had similar interest in making hip-hop music and soon began challenging each other's ability to rap and rhyme on the Net itself. eventually the two got together and produced a demo which landed them performing gigs in underground hip-hop scene. One year and hundreds of performances later, they amassed an incredible following. Such is the demand for Too Phat that an un-mastered studio mix of the track \"Lil Fingaz\" , became the Hitz.Fm's Most Wanted Hit at the end of November 1999. That was followed by the first official single \" Too Phat Baby\" which was released at the end of December 1999. \"Too Phat Baby\" made such an impact on radio that it was Hitz.Fm's Showdown Champion throughout the Millennium weekend and then some.\n\nToo Phat is more lyrical than typical. \" we are more into the lyrics than the hard side of hip-hop,\" says Malique. This is proven in many of the album tracks. The lyrics are clever, witty and laced with sarcasm. Not very typical indeed for a hip-hop act. The highlights of these lyrical mastery can be found in \"I Like You Know\" and Bla, Bla\" amongst many others.\n\nIt hasn't been all smooth sailing in producing \"Whutthadilly?\". When Too Phat started recording the album in early 1999, they were not signed to any recording label. The enterprising and hard-working duo did everything themselves from pre-production to the design of the album cover. \"It was very tough time for us,\" says Joe, who is studying Multimedia, Advertising and Broadcasting at LimKokWing Institute of Creative Technology. \"We invested a lot of money in the album. We even slept in the studios at one point!\"\n\nThe story of how Too Phat got signed to Positive Tone is a classic record industry tale. One of Too Phat's producers, Illegal, just happened to be play one of the tracks to Ahmad Izham, Managing Director of Positive Tone, who was working with Playtime Studios. And as the story went, Izham immediately jumped up and down excitedly saying \"I've never heard hip-hop like this: and demanded to see Too Phat right away. A meeting was quickly set up between the Too Phat and Izham and Paul Moss, Positive Tone's A&R Director and a deal was quickly concluded. Too Phat officially became a Positive Tone recording artist in the last few months of 1999.\n\nThe resulting album showcases 15 tracks that are very remarkable and would definitely lift Too Phat above the rest of the hip-hop pack. Also included in the album are cleverly used samples of the \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" TV theme song and Sharifah Aini and Broery Marantika's \"Seiring Sejalan\". Produced by a dream team of the nation's best R&B and hip-hop producers including Illegal and G-Soul, \"Whutthadilly?\" is a definite must listen. \"Each song has a story about it,\" says Malique. \"It is a very lyrical album. We're quite happy with the results.\" The album was recorded at Playtime Studios and Haze World Studios and mastered at Mastering One. Too Phat released \"Whutthadilly?\" to massive response on the 30th of December 1999.\n\nPositive Tone has planned an extensive promotional campaign for the group which will see them appearing in many press publications, radio and TV interviews. Internet promotions are also being planned. Too Phat will also be holding several live promotions around Malaysia in the next coming months. The second single \"Jezzebelle\" will be released simultaneously with the music video in February 2000.\n\nPlan B by Online Website and edited by cHAd EmcEe^dX\n\nOne listen to Too Phat's new album \"Plan B\" and you can't help thinking that this is yet another milestone for the local music industry. Plan B is yet another work of art from the dangerous boys of hip-hop and this is evident from the rapping, the production and even the album artwork itself.\n\nMalique and Joe Flizzow of Too Phat have built a massive and extremely loyal core following through their debut album \"Whutthadilly?\" (Positive Tone) that churned out three # 1 hits in \"Jezzebelle\" and \"Lil' Fingaz\" and \"Too Phat Baby\". \"Whutthadilly?\" was successful in bringing Too Phat's hip-hop style to the masses of Malaysia and what was once an underground phenomenon has become the latest craze in Malaysia.\n\n\"We feel that we have improved on our sound and our music on Plan B,\" says Malique. \"This album is a better effort from Too Phat. Not only do we have better production but this time each and every track has a message to it.\"\n\nPlan B is, in many ways, a perfect product for its time. The album began production in the middle of 2000 and was completed in February 2001. The album was produced by a variety of hip-hop producers including Illegal, G-Soul, Haze, Damien and Too Phat themselves. Produced entirely at Playtime Studios, the album features many surprise guest artists including Sharifah Aini, Camelia, vocal group VE, DJ T-Bone, and underground hip-hoppers The Teh Tarik Crew.\n\nPlan B differs from Too Phat's debut offering \"Whutthadilly?\" as this second album draws a lot from local influences in the production. Plan B features hip-hop tracks based on Asli loops, Sharifah Aini samples and even local humour. This reflects a certain maturity in Too Phat's music, as they evolve into a more unique sound which is unmistakably Too Phat.\n\nThe first single \"Anak Ayam (Freak To The Beat)\" is a great example of the new ground in Too Phat's music. \"Anak Ayam\" is strictly based on an old Asli loop which is then \"hip-hoperised\" and then given a unique Too Phat flavour.\n\nAnother potential single is \"Boogie Down\", a catchy club-flavoured track that uses a Sharifah Aini sample as its music bed. \"Just A Friend\", the Biz Markie re-make, is another potential hit. Vocal group VE guests wonderfully on vocals on this wonderful track. \"What You Want\" features Camelia on vocals and is a great combination of R&B and hip-hop. Rabbit is also featured on guitars on \"What You Want\". Another highlight is \"You\", where superstar Sharifah Aini breaks all boundaries with her powerful soulful singing on top of bouncy hip-hop rhythms.\n\nOther highlights include the very hooky \"It's On You\" featuring underground hip-hop stars The Teh Tarik Crew. \"Illion\" features a catchy hip-hop chorus, a song about making millions of money(!). There is also a great spoof of \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" called \"Who Wants To Be An Illionaire?\". Other interludes include MC interludes, B-Boys interlude, DJ interludes and even Graffiti interludes."
