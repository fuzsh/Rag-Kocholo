        "text": "GM – LIF – Today’s American Champion was an American jazz pianist, organist, composer, violinist, singer, and comedic entertainer. His innovations in the Harlem stride style laid the groundwork for modern jazz piano. His best-known compositions, \"Ain't Misbehavin'\" and \"Honeysuckle Rose\", were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1984 and 1999.\n\nWaller copyrighted over 400 songs, many of them co-written with his closest collaborator, Andy Razaf. Razaf described his partner as \"the soul of melody... a man who made the piano sing... both big in body and in mind... known for his generosity... a bubbling bundle of joy\". It's possible he composed many more popular songs and sold them to other performers when times were tough.\n\nWaller started playing the piano at the age of six, and became a professional organist aged 15. By the age of 18 he was a recording artist. Waller's first recordings, \"Muscle Shoals Blues\" and \"Birmingham Blues\", were made in October 1922 for Okeh Records. That year, he also made his first player piano roll, \"Got to Cool My Doggies Now\".\n\nWaller's first published composition, \"Squeeze Me\", was published in 1924. He became one of the most popular performers of his era, touring internationally and achieving critical and commercial success in the United States and Europe. He died from pneumonia, aged 39. One descendant is professional football player Darren Waller, who is Fats' great-grandson. ENJOY!\n\nRemember – “Grab your pig's feet, bread, and gin, there's plenty in the kitchen. I wonder what the poor people are eating tonight.” - Fats Waller\n\nToday in our History – December 31, 1925 – Fat’s Waller play's New Year eve party at the hotel he will be kidnapped in 1926.\n\nThomas Wright \"Fats\" Waller (May 21, 1904 – December 15, 1943) - Waller was the seventh child of 11 (five of whom survived childhood) born to Adeline Locket Waller, a musician, and Reverend Edward Martin Waller, a trucker and pastor in New York City. He started playing the piano when he was six and graduated to playing the organ at his father's church four years later. His mother instructed him in his youth, and he attended other music lessons, paying for them by working in a grocery store.\n\nWaller attended DeWitt Clinton High School for one semester but left school at 15 to work as an organist at the Lincoln Theater in Harlem, where he earned $32 a week. Within 12 months he had composed his first rag. He was the prize pupil and later the friend and colleague of the stride pianist James P. Johnson. His mother died on November 10, 1920, from a stroke due to diabetes.\n\nWaller became one of the most popular performers of his era, finding critical and commercial success in the United States and Europe. He was also a prolific songwriter, and many songs he wrote or co-wrote are still popular, such as \"Honeysuckle Rose\", \"Ain't Misbehavin'\" and \"Squeeze Me\". Fellow pianist and composer Oscar Levant dubbed Waller \"the black Horowitz\". Waller is believed to have composed many novelty tunes in the 1920s and 1930s and sold them for small sums, attributed to another composer and lyricist.\n\nWaller was kidnapped in Chicago leaving a performance in 1926. Four men bundled him into a car and took him to the Hawthorne Inn, owned by Al Capone. Waller was ordered inside the building and found a party in full swing. Gun to his back, he was pushed towards a piano, and told to play. A terrified Waller realized he was the \"surprise guest\" at Al Capone's birthday party, and took comfort that the gangsters did not intend to kill him. It is rumored that Waller stayed at the Hawthorne Inn for three days and left very drunk, extremely tired, and had earned thousands of dollars in cash from Capone and other party-goers as tips.\n\nStandards attributed to Waller, sometimes controversially, include \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\". The song was made famous by Adelaide Hall in the Broadway show Blackbirds of 1928. Biographer Barry Singer conjectured that this jazz classic was written by Waller and lyricist Andy Razaf and provided a description of the sale given by Waller to the New York Post in 1929—he sold the song for $500 to a white songwriter, ultimately for use in a financially successful show (consistent with Jimmy McHugh's contributions to Harry Delmar's Revels, 1927, and then to Blackbirds of 1928).\n\nHe further supports the conjecture, noting that early handwritten manuscripts in the Dana Library Institute of Jazz Studies of \"Spreadin' Rhythm Around\" (Jimmy McHugh ©1935) are in Waller's hand. Jazz historian Paul S. Machlin comments that the Singer conjecture has \"considerable [historical] justification\".\n\nWaller's son Maurice wrote in his 1977 biography of his father that Waller had once complained of hearing the song, and came from upstairs to admonish him never to play it in his hearing because he had had to sell it when he needed money.\n\nMaurice Waller's biography similarly notes his father's objections to hearing \"On the Sunny Side of the Street\" playing on the radio. Waller recorded \"I Can't Give You…\" in 1938, playing the tune but making fun of the lyrics; the recording was with Adelaide Hall who had introduced the song to the world at Les Ambassadeurs Club in New York in 1928.\n\nThe anonymous sleeve notes on the 1960 RCA Victor album Handful of Keys state that Waller copyrighted over 400 songs, many of them co-written with his closest collaborator, Andy Razaf. Razaf described his partner as \"the soul of melody... a man who made the piano sing... both big in body and in mind... known for his generosity... a bubbling bundle of joy\".\n\nGene Sedric, a clarinetist who played with Waller on some of his 1930s recordings, is quoted in these sleeve notes recalling Waller's recording technique with considerable admiration: \"Fats was the most relaxed man I ever saw in a studio, and so he made everybody else relaxed. After a balance had been taken, we'd just need one take to make a side, unless it was a kind of difficult number.\"\n\nWaller played with many performers, from Nathaniel Shilkret (on Victor 21298-A) and Gene Austin to Erskine Tate, Fletcher Henderson, McKinney's Cotton Pickers and Adelaide Hall, but his greatest success came with his own five- or six-piece combo, \"Fats Waller and his Rhythm\".\n\nWaller married Edith Hatch in 1920, with whom he had his first son, Thomas Waller Jr. in 1921. In 1923 Hatch divorced Waller. Waller then married Anita Rutherford in 1926. Together, they had a son, Maurice Thomas Waller, born on September 10, 1927. In 1928 Waller and Rutherford had their second son, Ronald Waller.\n\nIn 1938, Waller was one of the first African Americans to purchase a home in the Addisleigh Park section of St. Albans, Queens, a New York City community with racially restrictive covenants. After his purchase, and litigation in the New York State courts, many prosperous African Americans followed, including many jazz artists, such as Count Basie, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, and Milt Hinton.\n\nWaller contracted pneumonia and died on December 15, 1943, while traveling aboard the famous cross-country train the Super Chief near Kansas City, Missouri. His final recording session was with an interracial group in Detroit, Michigan, that included white trumpeter Don Hirleman.\n\nWaller was returning to New York City from Los Angeles, after the smash success of Stormy Weather, and after a successful engagement at the Zanzibar Room, in Santa Monica, California, during which he had fallen ill.\n\nMore than 4,200 people were estimated to have attended his funeral at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, which prompted Adam Clayton Powell Jr., who delivered the eulogy, to say that Fats Waller \"always played to a packed house.\"\n\nAfterward, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered over Harlem from an airplane piloted by an unidentified African American World War I aviator.
