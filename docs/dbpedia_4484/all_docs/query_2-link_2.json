        "text": "Reserved Tables and GA Standing\n\nPhat Phunktion has built a loyal following of listeners throughout the United States and around the world. A nine-piece tour de force that combines the polish of pop with the smoothness of 60’s soul and the raw groove of 70’s funk, Phat Phunktion formed in halls of the music school at the University of Wisconsin. They have performed at clubs and music festivals all across the United States and Japan. Their dynamic stage show and incredible musicianship have initiated thousands of faithful “Phatheads,” who are now spreading the word. They have amassed over 15 million streams on Spotify with over 35k monthly listeners.\n\nMama Digdown's career has taken them to clubs, concert halls, and festivals worldwide. Conceived closer to the headwaters than to the Mississippi Delta, Mama Digdown’s was born amidst the fertile decade of the New Orleans brass band revival of the early 1980s to the early 1990s - a decade that also produced the Rebirth Brass Band, Soul Rebels and the Hot 8 Brass Band. Respected around the world as one of the best purveyors of second line brass music, the band celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. The band has released nine albums and has penned several songs that have found their way into the New Orleans brass band cannon.\n\nCabaret Table Seating available for this event."
