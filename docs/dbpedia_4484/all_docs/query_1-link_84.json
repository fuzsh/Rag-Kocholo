        "text": "Yes, most babies who have perfectly plump cheeks or kissable chunky thighs are perfectly healthy. The way babies gain and carry weight depends on many factors, and considering those helps to determine whether their pudge is simply adorable or a cause for concern.\n\nNewborns grow very quickly, especially in their first year. At birth, the average weight for a male baby is born full-term is 7 pounds 6 ounces. The average birth weight for female babies is 7 pounds 2 ounces. But lots of healthy babies are born lighter or heavier than this average weight.\n\nDepending on their length, even babies born at the same weight may look either round and soft with lots of rolls or long and lean with less cushioning. Whether your little one has what we think of as “baby fat” isn’t always just about how much they weigh.\n\nBabies are meant to gain quickly\n\nBabies can double their weight in less than 6 months, and triple it by age 1. All babies need a high-fat diet to support this rapid growth and development. This is why your little one always seems to be hungry!\n\nBabies store some of that fat under their skin because their developing bodies and brain need quick hits of energy all the time. Your baby might have some body rolls or big, soft cheeks. Don’t worry — this kind of “fat” is normal and healthy for your baby.\n\nEvery baby grows at their own rate. Keep in mind that a baby may not gain weight or grow every week. Their overall growth rate is what’s important.\n\nHere’s an average estimate of how much your baby will grow in their first year:\n\nHow much weight your baby gains is an important sign of their health. Your pediatrician will also look at baby’s height (or length) and head size to find out how your baby is growing and developing.\n\nBaby weight can vary dramatically. Some babies grow faster than others and then slow down. Other babies may gain weight slowly, but steadily and catch up.\n\nThere is a range for height and weight\n\nYour roly-poly baby is most likely completely healthy. A healthy baby weight also depends on your baby’s length. As long as your baby is within the healthy weight range for their length, they are at a healthy weight no matter how adorably “chunky” they look.\n\nIf your little one is at the top that range, they might be a bigger baby, but still at a healthy weight. Your pediatrician will check your baby’s length and weight on an infant growth chart. Each baby is given a percentile.\n\nFor example, if your 6-month-old baby boy is in the 98th percentile for weight at their length, this means that they are heavier than 98 percent of babies of the same sex, age, and length. As long as your baby is gaining weight and growing in their first year, they are healthy.\n\nIf you think your little one might be getting a bit too heavy in your arms, don’t worry. Once your baby masters crawling and later, walking around, they will lose some of that cuddly “baby fat.” As your baby grows into an active toddler their weight should balance even further."
