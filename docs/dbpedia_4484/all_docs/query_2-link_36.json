        "text": "Sleep induced headaches\n\nThose who love to sleep often complain of a headache whenever they do not reach their preferred amount of sleep for the night, whereas those less inclined to sleep tend to respond by saying that too much sleep is a major cause of headaches. Actually, there are numerous factors at play with regard to sleep induced headaches, as follows:\n\nSnoring throughout the night often leads to people waking up with a tight and dizzy type of headache because the body has not taken on sufficient amounts of oxygen during the night. This is due to an upper airway blockage trapping carbon dioxide or leading to higher-than-normal levels of the gas, in turn causing blood vessels to expand, resulting in a morning headache.\n\nNot getting enough rest or not getting enough sleep each night can also cause headaches. This is especially the case in those groups who already suffer from chronic health disorders, such as migraines, as their chances of recurrent headaches is already higher than in others.\n\nToo much sleep – meaning over 9 hours per night – can affect some types of hormone, leading to a reduction in blood flow to the brain and, subsequently, a headache.\n\nDrinking caffeine or alcohol before bed time can lead to headaches or nausea upon waking up because these substances cause blood vessels to expand or contract, and stimulate the central nervous system.\n\nAn accumulation of stress may result in muscle tension affecting various areas, including the head, shoulders and neck, with this tension having the potential to affect sleep quality and cause headaches.\n\nDangers associated with sleep irregularities\n\nSleeping either too much or too little will have a negative effect on your body. Chronic sleep issues can increase the risk of developing various health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, heart attack, heart failure, arrhythmia, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, depression and extreme lethargy. All of these conditions have the potential to result in much more serious consequences thereafter.\n\nToo much sleep\n\nLethargy and a lack of motivation that could lead to an unfulfilling daily life.\n\nA decrease in the efficiency of the musculoskeletal system.\n\nObesity as a result of a reduction in the body’s metabolic rates, leading to an increase in fat stores and the possibility of numerous health conditions thereafter.\n\nHormonal changes that could result in depression.\n\nToo little sleep\n\nDecreased brain functioning efficiency leading to difficulties with concentration.\n\nA reduction in sexual desire.\n\nWorn out and wrinkled skin, especially with regard to bags under the eyes.\n\nTips on avoiding morning headaches\n\nGo to sleep at roughly the same time each night and aim for around 7-9 hours of good quality sleep.\n\nAvoid napping for long periods during the day, particularly when those naps extend from the daytime to the twilight hours.\n\nEat an evening meal which is easily digestible – being sure not to skip meals altogether — as this can reduce the risk of indigestion occurring while you sleep.\n\nExercise regularly, reduce stress and keep a positive mindset as these will all help to ensure a good night’s sleep.\n\nIrregular sleeping patterns can have more serious health consequences than you may have ever imagined. Equally, getting the correct amount of sleep each night has a range of health benefits. Aside from preventing illness, sufficient amounts of good quality sleep can help you achieve a fit and healthy body meaning weight that is much more easily controlled, a strong and revitalized mind, and a fully functioning hormonal system. Good quality sleep can even have a positive effect on how we look, giving us a cleaner and clearer complexion."
