        "text": "Date of death Victim Organization Institution\n\nand location Cause of death Notes November 3, 1900 Class hazing Porter Military Academy\n\nCharleston, South Carolina Internal injuries 12-year-old Brown was forced to drop blindfolded into a swimming pool. He dropped approximately 12 ft (3.7 m) into the pool, which contained almost no water. He died from internal injuries.[18][19] November 16, 1900 Class hazing Massachusetts Institute of Technology Neck trauma Moore died following the annual \"Cane rush\"—a tradition in which freshmen were given a special cane that the sophomores would attempt to steal during a scrap. After the pistol sounded to begin the rush, Moore grabbed hold of the cane, eventually finding himself at the bottom of the pile. He was asked a number of times if he was all right, which he answered in the affirmative. When the event ended, Moore was unresponsive and could not be resuscitated. It was determined that he died of fractures to the upper vertebrae of the neck.[20][21][22] December 3, 1900 Class hazing United States Military Academy\n\nWest Point, New York Tuberculosis Booz began at West Point in June 1898 in good physical health. Four months later, he resigned due to health problems. He died in December 1900 of tuberculosis. During his long struggle with the illness, he blamed the illness on hazing he received at West Point in 1898, claiming he had hot sauce poured down his throat on three occasions as well as a number of other grueling hazing practices, such as brutal beatings and having hot wax poured on him in the night. His family claimed that scarring from the hot sauce made him more susceptible to the infection, causing his death. Among other things, Booz had claimed that his devotion to Christianity made him a target and that he was tormented for reading his Bible.[23][24]\n\nThe practice of hazing at West Point entered the national spotlight following his death. Congressional hearings investigated his death and the pattern of systemic hazing of freshmen and serious efforts were made to reform the system and end hazing at West Point.[25][26][27]\n\nSeptember 15, 1903 Secret society \"L. of S.S.B\" Bluffton High School, Bluffton, Indiana Sepsis Fifteen-year-old McBride died five months after he was hazed roughly during the initiation into a high school secret society. Three other boys were hazed roughly at the same time, leading another of the boys' fathers to press charges for assault and battery against the boys. The other boys survived, but McBride developed sepsis and died following a high fever and delirium. Attempts were made to save his life by removing the necrotic bone of his leg, but it was unsuccessful. Ten students were tried for assault and battery but were acquitted, citing the lack of proof that the death was related to the hazing instead of an unrelated illness.[18][28][29][30] November 8, 1903 Phi Psi Chi (Local dental fraternity) University of Maryland, Baltimore Shortly after being initiated into Phi Psi Chi, German-born Loew was found deceased in his dorm room while his South African roommate was found unconscious.[31] Upon awakening, Loew's roommate described the hazing. A week prior, Loew was undressed, blindfolded, and taken into a room where he was laid on a block of ice. He was then carried upstairs to a balcony and thrown over the railing, a drop of 24 feet. Underneath the railing were students holding a sheet. When he fell onto the sheet, he was tossed up and down until he was unconscious. After reviving, he was beaten severely. He was given whiskey and quinine that evening. The following Saturday, he submitted to an unknown form of hazing and his roommate underwent the same hazing ritual that Loew underwent the weekend prior.[32] 1903 Childhood hazing Barton, Vermont Three young boys, aged 11, 10, and 7, read about hazing practices in college and decided to try it themselves. They built a fire in a pasture behind the schoolhouse and led nine-year-old Ralph Canning to the spot. They heated a number of stones until they were red hot. The boys forced Canning to both sit and stand on the hot stones and held him there despite his screams. The boys then either walked or jumped on him (depending on the source). He was finally allowed to leave and he crawled home, where he died two weeks later.[18][33] September 1904 Class hazing Purdue University\n\nWest Lafayette, Indiana Pneumonia Miller and other freshmen were taken to a bridge over the Wabash River. When he refused to cheer for the sophomores, he was stripped, painted black from head to toe (black and gold are Purdue's official colors), and thrown into the river. He was forced to swim until he was exhausted in the very cold water. He died of pneumonia four days later.[18][34] April 1904 Class hazing Rawson School\n\nFindlay, Ohio Head trauma Ten-year-old Fillwock was fatally injured during a hazing event by older boys at the school. He was being physically hazed by several boys who were several years older than him when he broke away from the crowd. He ran toward his home but fell, striking the back of his head on a stake. Several other boys piled on top of him. When he was picked up, his spine was injured, his skull fractured, and several ribs were broken. He died several days later.[35][36] October 28, 1905 Delta Kappa Epsilon Kenyon College\n\nGambier, Ohio Hit by train Pierson was killed while being initiated into a fraternity. He was sent to a railroad track as part of a hazing ceremony, and killed by an unscheduled train.[37] February 10, 1906 Class hazing A school in Lima, Ohio Pneumonia Thirteen-year-old Taylor was buried in a snowdrift after rough hazing by classmates. He died a few days later of pneumonia.[18][38] January 3, 1906 Class hazing Hilliard High School\n\nColumbus, Ohio On November 9, 1905, Leat was thrown into a rail, then to the ground where he was beaten severely. He died the following January from the injuries.[39] September 27, 1908 Emil S. Gran Class hazing Worcester Polytechnic Institute\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts Spinal trauma On September 22, 1908, Gran fractured his spine in the Sophomore-Freshmen cane rush and died several days later from his injuries.[40] March 1909 Class hazing White School\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana Stintson was strung up by the ankles to a tree near the school and left for an extended period of time. He died several hours after being taken down.[41] Date of death Victim Organization University Cause of Death Notes October 6, 2000 Pi Kappa Phi California State University, Chico Choking as a result of alcohol intoxication After consuming beer and blackberry brandy as part of his initiation ritual, Heideman became intoxicated and was moved to a back room while the rest of the chapter watched strippers who had been hired for the event. When his fraternity brothers checked on him at 1 am the next morning, they found him unresponsive; he had aspirated his vomit and asphyxiated as a result of severe alcohol intoxication.[127] January 29, 2001 Omega Psi Phi Tennessee State University Asthma attack after intense exercise Green had an asthma attack and died while jogging and doing calisthenics as part of his fraternity pledging. He had a temperature of 39.8 °C (103.7 °F) when he died.[95] November 4, 2001 Kappa Sigma University of Miami Drowning, while intoxicated with alcohol After a night of drinking, Meredith was told to swim across Lake Osceola but struggled due to his intoxication. He drowned 34 feet from shore. Meredith's parents sued the fraternity and were awarded $12,600,000, the largest verdict ever awarded in a fraternity hazing death. In 2005, Florida passed the Chad Meredith Act, which allows prosecutors to seek felony charges for hazing.[95] February 12, 2002 (date found) Zeta Beta Tau Alfred University Apparent suicide after brutal hazing Two Alfred University fraternity members, Bradley Calkins and Thomas Lam, pleaded guilty to assault and hazing charges, respectively, following the suicide of Klein. The men admitted to assaulting Klein on February 9 to prevent him from speaking out against the fraternity's hazing practices. \"We were all afraid that if he left, he would get our fraternity in trouble because he was drinking and telling others about hazing practices in our fraternity,\" one of the men said. Calkins admitted he hit Klein in the head with a boot after binding his hands and feet with duct tape in a hotel room during a regional fraternity meeting. Lam admitted to encouraging the practice and not taking any steps to halt it. While he was still tied up, he was placed in the bathtub with the shower turned on and not released until he promised he would not leave the hotel room. Klein was found deceased three days later in a creek behind the fraternity house of an apparent suicide by drug overdose. He was found with cuts and bruises on his body from the assault. A month after Klein's death, Alfred University voted to eliminate the Greek system from their campus.[128] February 14, 2002 Phi Sigma Kappa University of Maryland, College Park Alcohol intoxication Reardon died of alcohol poisoning following a hazing ritual. He was comatose for one week before life support was removed.[129] The chapter is still active on UM's campus, but they have overhauled the way they bring members into the fraternity. The recruitment brochure for the 2012 year says it has \"no pledging and no hazing. None. Never. Ever. Pledging and hazing has no place in a brotherhood.\"[130] September 9, 2002 and Kenitha Saafir Alpha Kappa Alpha California State University, Los Angeles Drowning According to a lawsuit filed by the family, on the night they died, they spent several hours at the beach doing calisthenics before being ordered to walk backward into the ocean. Kenitha, who couldn't swim, was hit by a wave and knocked over. Kristin attempted to rescue Kenitha. Both girls drowned. A lawsuit filed by the girls' families alleged that the women had been blindfolded, had their arms tied, and were wearing clothes and shoes when they entered the water.[131] October 10, 2002 Pi Kappa Alpha University of Nevada, Reno Drowning Santos drowned in Manzanita Lake as part of a fraternity ritual. It is unclear if the death was a result of hazing or a prank, but the fraternity was banned from UNR following the incident.[132][133] March 12, 2003 Psi Epsilon Chi State University of New York at Plattsburgh Water intoxication Jennings was pledging Psi Epsilon Chi when he was forced to drink numerous pitchers of water through a funnel. His brain swelled and he died as a result of water intoxication. The fraternity had lost its recognition by the campus five years prior.[134] October 20, 2003 Sigma Kappa Omega Plymouth State University Traffic collision Nester was killed in a car accident in which she and 10 other pledges were blindfolded and packed into an SUV, which lost control and flipped. A lawyer for Nester's family said: \"The understanding is that this was to be a punishment trip because some of the pledges hadn't done some of things required of them. The intent was, apparently, either to scare them or drop them someplace, forcing them to find their way home.\" New Hampshire police said that the driver may have been driving erratically, rocking the Jeep back and forth and jamming the brakes. The sorority was an unrecognized local sorority composed of members who had either left or been kicked out of Alpha Sigma Alpha.[135] September 17, 2004 Chi Psi University of Colorado at Boulder Alcohol intoxication Bailey died of alcohol intoxication following a fraternity initiation ritual that involved heavy drinking.[136] The Gordie Foundation was set up in his memory, \"to provide today's young people with the skills to navigate the dangers of alcohol, binge drinking, peer pressure and hazing\". November 18, 2004 Steven David Judd Delta Chi New Mexico State University Alcohol intoxication As part of Delta Chi fraternity's 21st birthday hazing ritual, Steven consumed at least 15 shots of hard liquor in a 2-hour period at a local bar. Police reports state that Steven had on at least two separate occasions asked the bartenders not to serve him any more alcohol and was also served a drink in order to cause him to vomit which was unsuccessful. After returning to his fraternity house he fell down several times hitting his head and was put to bed where he was found unconscious the following morning. He ultimately was taken off life support just 24 hours after turning 21. At the time of his death, Steven was a junior Crimson Scholar at New Mexico State University majoring in Computer Science. The university refused to accept any responsibility or make significant changes in their campus policies. Repeated attempt to get the New Mexico legislature to pass a \"Cinderella Law\" which would have postponed the legal age, for drinking purposes, 12 hours was consistently met with opposition from the liquor lobby and failed each and every time in committee. A memorial scholarship, funded by his parents and friends, has been awarded each year for the student that \"has made the greatest contribution toward alcohol prevention and the reduction of high-risk drinking at NMSU.\" November 25, 2003 Occupational hazing Republic Energy Drilling Company Polytrauma A drilling rig employee received an 18-year prison sentence in the hazing death of 23-year-old Shawn Davis, a new employee of Republic Energy Drilling Company. Veteran employees were attempting to initiate Davis by hoisting him upwards via a cable used to pick up a pipe and place it on the rig floor. Davis resisted, but the employees succeeded in putting the belt on Davis and hooking him to the cat line. Another employee noted that the kelly, the device located on the rig floor that is used to drill into the ground and spins at seventy rotations per minute, was turning and, based on his experience, he knew that any slack in the cat line could get caught on the kelly as it turned. Unbeknownst to other employees, this is what happened shortly before he was hooked to the cat line. They hastily attempted to unhook the cat line as it pulled Davis out of the door of the top doghouse. Davis was dragged, face first, out of the building. Davis hit the bottom half of the doghouse door, taking it off the hinges. He was then dragged to the kelly bushing where he was spun around approximately ten to twenty times as his body hit several different pieces of equipment and surfaces. They immediately shut down the equipment and called 911, but he died of blunt force trauma.[137] March 8, 2004 Southside Masonic Lodge, Patchogue, New York Freemasons Shot to death James was killed during an initiation ceremony into an unsanctioned \"Fellowcrafts Club\" attached to a local lodge when another member mistakenly fired a gun loaded with real bullets instead of blanks. Police say that the members—all Masons—sat James in a chair and placed cans on a small platform around his head. The alleged shooter, Albert Eid, was standing approximately 20 feet away holding a gun. A second man was supposed to knock the cans off when the gun was fired to make the inductee think they had been struck by bullets to create fear and anxiety. Eid had two guns—one with blanks and one with real bullets—and apparently pulled the wrong one out of his pocket and fired, hitting James.[138] February 2, 2005 Chi Tau (local) California State University, Chico Water intoxication Carrington was forced to drink large amounts of water and do calisthenics in a basement flooded with raw sewage with fans blowing on him. He died from water intoxication. The ritual dated back 20 years at the fraternity. As a result, California passed Matt's Law, which allows for felony prosecution of some hazing rituals, which had historically been misdemeanors.[95][139] August 28, 2005 Lambda Phi Epsilon University of California, Irvine As a result of intense exercise Luong died after being tackled in a ritual football game that pitted the 10-member pledge group against approximately 40 active members and alumni. The game lasted for more than 3 hours and was played without the use of pads. Prior to the football game, the pledges were forced to complete vigorous calisthenics such as close-fisted pushups on gravel; jumping in the air while standing, landing on their chests without using their hands to break their fall; and drinking two gallons of water in one sitting.[140] December 10, 2005 Lambda Phi Epsilon University of Texas at Austin Alcohol intoxication\n\n(BAC 0.41)\n\nPhoummarath was given at least four bottles of liquor to drink on the evening of his death.

Fraternity members failed to seek medical attention for at least 12 hours after he fell unconscious.[95] January 8, 2006 Phi Gamma Delta California State University Fresno Alcohol intoxication\n\n(BAC 0.34)\n\nIt was found out that Daniels and his fraternity hosted a large party with up to 70 people on January 7. They discovered Danny was a pledge and fraternity brothers forced him to drink large amounts of alcohol for initiation. Once he became sick, FIJI members carried him to a secluded room at the fraternity and left him. Daniels died in the early morning of January 8, 2006 from acute alcohol intoxication and later tests showed that Daniels had a blood-alcohol level of 0.34, more than four times the legal limit. The university suspended the chapter for 5 years and as of 2019, they are still inactive.[141][142][143] November 17, 2006 Sigma Alpha Epsilon University of Texas at Austin Polytrauma due to falling after alcohol intoxication Investigators say Cross fell from a fifth-floor balcony as a result of being highly intoxicated after a hazing ritual. Cross' family claims that he was beaten with paddles, forced to consume large amounts of alcohol, and deprived of sleep.[144] March 30, 2007 Phi Kappa Tau Rider University Alcohol intoxication DeVercelly died from alcohol poisoning as a result of a fraternity hazing ritual. During \"Big Little Night\" at Phi Kappa Tau, pledges were presented with their 'family' drink and were required to drink the entire bottle before leaving the basement of the fraternity house.

A lawsuit by Wade's family alleges that Wade was deprived of fluids while undergoing the intense exercise session that included running bleachers, holding his legs six inches off the ground, doing pushups and jumping jacks, and living on a strict bread-and-water diet.[149] Date of death Victim Organization University Cause of Death Notes October 15, 2010 Tau Kappa Epsilon Radford University Alcohol intoxication He had a BAC of 0.48. According to his mother, Mason died of alcohol poisoning after taking part in the fraternity's \"family drink\" ritual, where pledges are given a large amount of alcohol and told to finish an allotted portion.

Gather and Carter had undergone a number of grueling hazing activities that week, including the \"Delta TV,\" in which the pledges were forced to get into and hold a push-up position, do \"wall sits\" and maintain that stance for a long period of time, and do the \"Delta Chair\": standing on one leg and holding heavy bricks over their heads. The pledges also wore \"Delta Lipstick\": hot sauce rubbed on their lips, and ate a \"Delta Apple,\" a large raw onion; they were also asked to eat large amounts of cottage cheese, and drink buttermilk. The driver of the vehicle, a fellow pledge who survived, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor death by motor vehicle. According to the lawsuit filed by the family, she was suffering from \"excessive and overwhelming fatigue, exhaustion and sleep deprivation and fell asleep behind the wheel\" because of the pledging exercises.\n\nThe night and morning hours prior to the accident, the pledges had been practicing the \"probate death march,\" an aspect of the initiation ceremony.

Freshman pledges kidnap older members, blindfold them, and bind their wrists and ankles with zip ties and duct tape. The fraternity brothers are asked trivia questions about Sigma Alpha Epsilon and drink if they get an answer wrong.[153] November 2, 2012 Pi Kappa Alpha Northern Illinois University Alcohol intoxication Bogenberger died of a cardiac arrhythmia triggered by alcohol poisoning. \"The event that night involved the pledges rotating between several rooms in the fraternity house, being asked a series of questions, and then being provided cups of vodka and other liquor to drink,\" police said in a statement. \"This resulted in the pledges drinking a large quantity of alcohol in about a two-hour time period.\" Pledges were told to drink regardless of whether they answered questions correctly.[154] In 2015, 22 former Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity members were convicted of various charges related to the death. None of the men were sentenced to jail time, mostly receiving fines and community service. Richard Schmack, DeKalb County State's Attorney, said it was the largest hazing prosecution in U.S. history.[155] November 19, 2011 Florida A&M Marching Band Florida A&M University Collapse, blunt force trauma Champion was a drum major in the university's marching band, the Marching 100.[156] He collapsed after undergoing a ritual referred to as \"Crossing Bus C\", in which band members must walk from the front of the bus to the back while other band members kick, punch, and hit him with straps, drum sticks, and other objects.

The leader, Dante Martin, was convicted of manslaughter and hazing charges and sentenced to six years in prison.\n\nFebruary 17, 2012 Delta Gamma Iota Vincennes University Alcohol intoxication Torrance died of alcohol poisoning after a bid night ceremony.[158] September 3, 2012 Theta Chi California State University, Fresno Alcohol intoxication Dhanens died of alcohol poisoning (BAC 0.36) after a hazing event in which 15 pledges were placed in a room where they were told they had to drink eight bottles of hard liquor in order to leave.[159][160] His blood alcohol level was 0.36.[161] The fraternity president pleaded no contest to a single misdemeanor charge of hazing and was sentenced to three years' probation and community service; two other fraternity members pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of hazing and providing alcohol to a minor causing death and were sentenced to 90 days and 30 days in jail, respectively.[161] March 26, 2012 Delta Sigma Phi High Point University Oxymorphone overdose after brutal hazing 22-year-old Robert Eugene Tipton Jr. was pledging Delta Sigma Phi when he was found unresponsive in an off-campus apartment on March 26, 2012. He was pronounced dead at the hospital later that day. The state medical examiner ruled that an oxymorphone overdose was the cause of death and no criminal charges were filed. The family filed a lawsuit against the fraternity, the university, and members of the fraternity alleging that Tipton was \"violently\" assaulted and battered during a fraternity \"counseling session,\" and suffered blunt force trauma to the head, which led to his death. The suit also alleges that a fraternity member deleted text messages from Tipton's phone after his death to cover up the hazing. The suit contends the school was aware of \"outrageous conduct\" by the fraternity and misrepresented \"information about the frequency or incidence of hazing, violence, injuries, substance abuse, and/or other dangerous and/or illegal activities at HPU or within Delta Sigma Phi.\"[162] April 20, 2013 Marvell Edmondson and Jauwan Holmes Men of Honor (local, unsanctioned fraternity) Virginia State University Drowning Edmondson and Holmes drowned during an initiation rite for the underground fraternity known as Men of Honor. Seven students locked arms and attempted to cross the Appomattox River together. Fraternity members told police they completed the same rite several months earlier without issue and the water was shallow enough to make it across without swimming. On April 20, however, the river had swelled considerably due to a recent storm and was moving more swiftly. The students quickly became submerged and were swept downstream. The other five men were rescued by members of the fraternity. Four fraternity members pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and hazing charges.[163] April 24, 2013 Lambda Phi Epsilon San Francisco State University Alcohol poisoning During a \"crossover\" party where new members were initiated into the fraternity, Tran died of alcohol poisoning. He wasn't discovered until the next day. A member of the fraternity attempted to perform CPR, but Tran was pronounced dead at 1 PM on April 24. Lambda Phi Epsilon was expelled from the university following Tran's death.[164] December 8, 2013 Pi Delta Psi Baruch College Head injury Deng died following a hazing ritual called \"glass ceiling\" while on a retreat in the Poconos.

He died two days later.[165] July 1, 2014 Pi Kappa Phi California State University, Northridge Heat stroke while hiking Villa died following an 18-mile group hike with other pledges near Big Tujunga Canyon Road in Angeles National Forest. According to an attorney who represented Villa's parents, the group ran out of water at some point during the hike and Villa left the group in search of more water. He was later found unresponsive lying face down in a culvert. Other pledges told authorities that they didn't realize Villa \"was any worse off than the other hikers,\" according to court documents.[166] He died from heatstroke.[167][168][169] His family is suing CSUN and the fraternity.[needs update][170] Prosecutors declined to charge the fraternity president, stating that a group hike on a hot day with inadequate water supply did not fit the traditional definition of hazing. They argued that hazing deaths are usually the result of excessive alcohol consumption, drugs or physical injury inflicted by fraternity members, and Villa's death was not due to those causes.[166] September 22, 2014 Sigma Phi Epsilon Clemson University Head injuries after fall Sigma Phi Epsilon pledge Tucker Hipps was participating in a group run with his fraternity around 5:30am when he fell from a bridge into shallow waters of Lake Hartwell. He died of head injuries from the fall. The fraternity members reported that he got separated from the group and didn't return from the run. He was reported missing and his body was found later on that day. The police investigating his death released a statement that they were unable to find any link between hazing and his death, but it was widely speculated, particularly on social media, that the death resulted from hazing. Because of the widespread rumors, the president's Interfraternity Council at Clemson voted to suspend pledge activities. Hipps' family filed a lawsuit against Clemson University, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and three fraternity brothers.
