Asian collaborations with pop acts from Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Australia, Sweden, Canada and United States have allowed for an all access pass in Asia. Regional appearances and performances are reflective in their album sales with over half a million records sold to date.
