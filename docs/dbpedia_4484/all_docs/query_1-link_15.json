        "text": "Joe Flizzow\n\nThe diverse character of the duo, the self claimed JFK has gone from that kid to the king since they first started back in 98.\n\nThe advertising graduate who pursued into the music industry after completing studies has nothing to regret with his decision which has made him a successful musician, a record label owner and the musical substance from the duo has made him a local cultural mogul alongside his partner in rhyme, Malique. The rapper who grew up listening to west coast veterans like Snoop Dogg and Dr.Dre picked up the microphone at a very early age. By doing openings for his cousins R and B outfit Soulstreet, Joe learned the tricks and trades of handling the microphone and faced stage fright before he even completed high school. Starting journalism at a very young age, Joe built his writing skills and gift of gab to convey his messages forward. Poetry to journalism then rhymes, Joe knew his path that he was walking and was very clear of his dreams. He just wanted to grow up and be famous.\n\nNow, the famous rap superstar who used to be the local neighborhood wonder-boy has achieved his dreams. Starting his career at underground gigs, Joe faced his fair share of obstacles to be where he is today. Since they emerged, Too Phat has faced heat from all corners but it is the survival of the fittest when comes to the music industry and Joe Flizz has pretty much faced a whole hand full. Malique left for holidays to rest his mind and relax but his partner stayed hungry like he just first started. Handling a concert all by himself with the support of his friends, Joe made it seem like the duo bout to split but nope. He started eyeing out talents and constructed his own music empire by starting his own record label, Kartel Records. He collected his own team to work on his projects and around the same time, Malique came back and it looked like they moved into the studio because days and nights were spent there.\n\nTheir masterpiece was given birth. Rebirth into Reality would broadcast Joe Flizzow as the Head of the Kartel. The elevated and more matured Too Phat has more to offer the fans and critics this time around. Loads of questions and answers but the summary?\n\nAfter 3 successful albums, two platinum releases and one compilation given birth by Too Phat themselves, the rest better be kept as history in secretive form cause no one can really understand what it is about Too Phat that has brought them this far...\n\nLet the world witness and figure...Kartello Hello.\n\nMalique\n\nThe quiet poet on real life who never failed to show the world what he painted with words since he first started recording. Que Chill is back blasting on your stereo.\n\nFitting on right topics and gelling well with his partner, Malique remained the favorite among the kids because of his lively appearance on stage and catchy lyrics on tracks.. Coming to K.L with ambition of becoming a lawyer, Malique surprisingly began his musical start after finishing his lower university studies. Having the hip-hop soul in him since he first listened to LL Cool J back in the 80s, he suddenly found himself battling Joe Flizzow online and discovered his power of battling and flexing skills against opponents.\n\nMaliques rhyming love bloomed when he drowned himself behind the headphones of his yellow discman to kill stress. The action that worked against him helped when he first started writing rhymes. Joe and him became friends, gathered a following through Too Phat and stand as what they are today. Gone through the good and bad winds in his 6 years of being one part of the most successful English selling group in Malaysia, Malique has become so used to rumors and silent conservations- critics.\n\nHis love for the culture pushed him to make moves. Many would agree but he did use his power to influence and brought forward one of the elements to a strong hold. Malique even picked up b-boying after recruiting break dancers for Too Phatâ€™s live shows. Few thousand of lucky fans would have seen him flare or head spin in all kinda places like airports runaways or live shows. Those were the good old days of Malique. Now, the culture of break dancing has spread well enough to all parts of the country. Yes, the were people before him who broadcasted break dancing but Malique together with Joe played a very big part to make it stay forever. There will break dancers 50 years from now, best believe.\n\nRight after he came back from holidays, Malique got into the studio and just started recording until they came down to 30 songs. Malique had so much to say on this album such as dealing with personal agendas and stating the relevant truth to crush kill the gossips. Malique, who always went his own way when came to handling the biz also like to carry and defend this truth, the late Notorious B.I.G is the illest.\n\nWelcome to his gift and curse. His rebirth and reality."
