        "text": "The occurrence of calving difficulty varies between seasons and properties, but under Victorian conditions up to 30% of heifers may require assistance at calving.\n\nOther costs associated with calving difficulty are:\n\nveterinary fees\n\ncost of labour to supervise and assist heifers during calving\n\nreduced herd fertility (due to the longer time required by assisted heifers to conceive again)\n\nincreased calf morbidity and reduced colostrum consumption.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to completely eliminate calving difficulty, a number of steps can be taken to reduce occurrence to a minimum.\n\nCauses of calving difficulty\n\nThe two most important known causes of calving difficulty in heifers are:\n\nexcessive calf size at birth\n\ninadequate size of the birth canal.\n\nLarge, heavy calves are more difficult to expel than calves of average weight for the breed, and therefore are prone to more difficulty at birth and a greater rate of stillbirths. Male calves need to be assisted at birth much more frequently than females as they are generally heavier.\n\nCalves that are heavy at birth require a larger birth canal or pelvic area for normal delivery than lighter calves.\n\nIn an experiment with 1000 Hereford heifers calving at two years of age, it was found that an extra 200 square centimetres of pelvic area was needed to accommodate each additional 4.5kg of calf if it weighed between 28kg and 36kg. Calves weighing less than 23kg caused almost no calving difficulty, while calves weighing more than 36 kg caused an extremely high incidence of difficulty.\n\nA number of other causes of calving difficulty that account for a relatively small proportion of difficult calvings include:\n\nabnormal calf presentation\n\nobstruction of the birth canal by fat deposits\n\nconstriction of the birth canal at the vulva, vagina or cervix\n\nweak labour or poor muscle tone in heifers that are either very thin or too fat.\n\nAge at first calving\n\nIt is often said that calving difficulty results from joining heifers when they are too young. In cases where heifers are accidentally mated at very light weights or young ages, high levels of calving difficulty attributable to a small, immature birth canal do occur. However, do not be deterred from joining well grown British breed heifers (minimum joining weight 275kg, condition score 3), to calve at two years of age.\n\nCalving difficulty is essentially a problem of first-calvers, irrespective of whether they calve at two or three years of age. Although three-year-olds are heavier and have larger pelvic openings than two-year-olds, they have proportionately heavier calves.\n\nHeifers calving for the first time at two and three years of age normally have a similar incidence of calving trouble. More difficulty can be experienced by heifers calving first at three years because they tend to become too fat.\n\nControlling calving difficulty\n\nCalving difficulty can be kept to a minimum by applying the following management principles.\n\nSire breed\n\nBulls of any larger cattle breeds, including Brahmans and European beef breeds, throw heavy calves and may cause high levels of calving difficulty. They should not be mated with heifers of smaller breeds.\n\nThere are also important differences between the British beef breeds. Hereford bulls normally cause more calving difficulty than either Shorthorn or Angus bulls. Some beef producers have adopted the practice of mating Hereford heifers with Angus bulls in an attempt to avoid calving difficulty. In some cases this approach has been marginally successful but in others the Angus bulls have caused slightly more difficulty than the Herefords.\n\nThe only bull breed which can be relied on to substantially reduce the level of calving difficulty in heifers is the Jersey. However, the value of a beef-Jersey cross must be questioned in view of the difficulty likely to be encountered in marketing the progeny.\n\nDifferences between sires of the same breed\n\nWithin pure breeds of cattle there are large differences between sires in their ability to throw light calves and cause a minimum of calving difficulty. In large artificial insemination programs, the level of calving difficulty and stillbirths has been reduced by more than 30% by careful selection of sires. No simple method of identifying 'easy calving' bulls on visually determined characteristics has yet been found.\n\nThere appears to be little or no relationship between the conformation, degree of muscling or body measurements of a bull and the amount of calving difficulty he causes. The commonly held view that bulls with large heads or protruding shoulders cause higher than normal levels of calving difficulty has not been substantiated by research on the subject.\n\nBREEDPLAN estimated breeding values\n\nApart from progeny testing, the only useful aids to selecting 'easy calving' or 'low birth weight' bulls are BREEDPLAN 'Estimated Breeding Values' (EBVs) or the bull's own birth weight. As birth weight is a moderately heritable characteristic, bulls that had below average birth weight themselves will sire lighter calves than bulls that had above average birth weights. Where BREEDPLAN EBVs are available, bulls with negative or low EBVs for birth weight should be selected to mate with heifers.\n\nUsing litter mate bulls\n\nA disproportion between sire and dam in frame size and birth weight can lead to increased calving difficulties. To avoid this problem, in some large Australian herds, heifers are joined with 'litter mate' bulls, that is, bulls from the same calf drop as the heifers.\n\nThis practice ensures that the bulls used are 'genetically compatible' with heifers for birth weight and frame size. Ideally litter mate bulls selected should be of below or average birth weight. The use of litter mate bulls will lead to a level of in-breeding. Therefore, their progeny should not be used for future breeding.\n\nHeifer breed for calving\n\nBreed differences in the incidence of calving difficulty among heifers follow a similar pattern to breed differences among bulls.\n\nExercise during pregnancy\n\nExercise is believed to play some part in the avoidance of calving difficulty, although this has not been tested in experiments.\n\nHeifers that have had to walk up and down hills, for example, should have better muscle tone and greater calving endurance than unfit heifers.\n\nSome producers deliberately feed out hay on hill tops, well away from watering points, to ensure that heifers get plenty of exercise during pregnancy.\n\nDisturbance during calving\n\nExperiments conducted in Victoria have shown that calving problems can be induced by excessive disturbance during the calving period.\n\nWhen heifers are disturbed at the time of calving, muscles along the birth canal fail to relax and the birth process may be interrupted by constriction at the vulva and vagina. A compromise must therefore be reached between the need to observe heifers frequently during calving and the need to avoid disturbing them.\n\nSelection against calving difficulty\n\nThe question of applying genetic selection procedures to the problem of avoiding calving difficulty often arises. These approaches are possible, but unfortunately none are likely to be successful.\n\nCulling heifers that have a difficult calving\n\nThe daughters of a heifer that had difficulty at calving are no more prone to difficulty themselves than the daughters of a heifer that calved normally. In other words, the heritability of calving difficulty is low.\n\nHeifers that experience difficulty the first time are not likely to have difficulty later. It may be sound economics to cull heifers that produce a dead calf, but no genetic improvement can be expected by culling heifers that had a difficult calving.\n\nSelection against heavy calf birth weights\n\nThe main problem with this approach is that her productivity would be reduced. Calf birth weight is closely related to weaning weight, yearling weight and growth rate.\n\nSelection for low birth weights would therefore result in lower weaning and yearling weights.\n\nSelection against small pelvic size\n\nPelvic size is closely related to heifer skeletal size which in turn is related to calf birth weight. By selecting for large pelvic size, calf birth weight would be increased and consequently no improvement in calving difficulty could be expected.\n\nUsing calving induction\n\nWhen heifers are mated too early or mismated to a bull which is likely to throw calves too large for the heifer to deliver, calving induction may be necessary.\n\nAbortion can be induced by injecting the heifers with the hormone prostaglandin, in the first third of pregnancy, after a minimum of five days after the last observed mating. Prostaglandin can only be obtained with a prescription and must be administered under veterinary supervision.\n\nNutrition's impact on dystocia\n\nHeifer nutrition has a key impact on the incidence of dystocia.\n\nThe growth rate of heifers is closely aligned with pelvic diameter. This means if heifers are grown at a consistent rate from weaning to calving the pelvic diameter at calving will be optimised.\n\nThe desirable rate of growth depends on the age/weight at weaning, breed, and genetics of the heifer, however ~0.7kg/day can be used as a guide. It is known that most of the foetal growth occurs in the final trimester.\n\nSome people have limited heifer feed intake in an attempt to reduce birth weight. However, restrictive feeding in the final trimester actually increases dystocia by reducing pelvic diameter and increasing the occurrence of weak calvers.\n\nAs a result, it is important to maintain a steady constant growth rate in heifers, so they are well grown without being over fat. If heifers do become over fat in late gestation heifers must still be fed to meet their maintenance, growth and pregnancy energy requirements."
