Those who I hurt their hearts Took advantage of And even lied to Hug you one last time For forgiveness Yeah I would like to If I die tonight Would you feel the loss? Tomorrow would you dial My number by accident Then suddenly... pause? If I die tonight I wonder who would get To keep my caps and shoes Jerseys, even my little Stuffed crocodile Coco too Get my cell phone Message everyone from A to Z Tell 'em this ain't Malique He passed away last night And pray he rest in peace If I die tonight Would you think of my room When you see blue Wanted to clean it up this morning But then I never knew If I die tonight What would happen to Tim How long would it take Before she kissed another man?... God damn... At fast food joints Would she still order The same combo meal for two? Things I wish I knew... Chorus (2X) If I die tonight You know it'll be alright Just smile for me Reminisce the fond memories Verse 3 A cute lil' thing To many eyes To me you were simply A beautiful thing I tell no lies We went from Mere invisible friends To pals real tight Rendezvous up on the net To chitty chat all night I used to pick you up Until you got your own ride A slammin' two door whip A grey 36-72 Lookin' all slick Remember when I asked why this You said because it's real fast So you can rush To see your boy after class The last time We met was '01 September You left feelin' upset over... something I can't remember... I never apologized Till January 10th 2003 When I heard you passed away When I was deep in my sleep Your loss taught me Not to take my friends for granted Misunderstandings Gotta slam it quick Death you never plan it You're sorely missed down here Wawyn Rest in peace This too shall pass But our true friendship will never cease... Love... Chorus (till end) If I die tonight You know it'll be alright Just smile for me Reminisce the fond memories *Dedicated to the loving memory of Zehan Azureen 1982-2003*\n\nWatch: New Singing Lesson Videos Can Make Anyone A Great Singer"
