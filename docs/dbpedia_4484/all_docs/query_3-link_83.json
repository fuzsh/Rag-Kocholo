        "text": "By 張麟發 Tommy Lan Phat Truong, director, My Name is 張麟發 Tommy Lan Phat Truong\n\nI was born at Toronto East General Hospital, now known as Michael Garron Hospital, in 1988. I was born into privilege compared to my parents, who were both born in Vietnam and lived through the Vietnam War.\n\nWhile I had air conditioning and trained medical professionals at my service from the moment I arrived in this world, my mother and father grew up with ammunition raining down from the sky, the threat of their homes collapsing under bombing attacks, and the fear that their family and friends would not survive.\n\nThe stories I know from my parents' childhood are about how they would play with empty bullet shells and faulty land mines that hadn't exploded, and run to the mountains for safety when they would hear planes in the distance. My parents spent their teenage years running from war and seeking refuge.\n\nIn July 1979, my parents were sponsored and immigrated to Canada.\n\nI was born in Canada, but people always ask me where I'm from\n\nAlthough I was born in Canada, assimilating into Western culture from a long and convoluted diasporic cultural heritage wasn't easy. It was confusing. As a child, I was never sure which group of kids I should be playing with — or even which ones I identified with.\n\nThroughout my life, I've encountered racism and microaggressions, from my kindergarten teacher telling my parents I should have a \"proper\" English name to my classmates laughing when new teachers would say \"fat\" as they read Lan Phat Truong off the attendance sheet.\n\nThese experiences, coupled with the cultural turmoil of being Canadian, Vietnamese and Chinese, drove me to create the animated documentary My Name is 張麟發 Tommy Lan Phat Truong in an effort to explain where my name comes from, what it means and to help answer the question, \"Where are you really from?\"\n\nThe 10-minute film is a literal retelling of my life that I wrote, directed, animated and produced on my own. It examines the evolution, etymology and script of my name as a way of defining my mixed sense of cultural identity.\n\nBut as much as I wanted to explore these things for myself, I also wanted to create something that would resonate with other people who've had similar experiences.\n\nThrough the process of making this film, I was able to look at my identity over the years, while also exploring how we're shaped by both the names we are given and the names we choose for ourselves.\n\nMy parents were among hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese 'boat people'\n\nI started this project by intensively researching the history of my family. I looked through immigration papers, and asked my parents about their childhoods and what they felt when they immigrated to a new country in their early 20s.\n\nMy parents are from an ethnic minority group in Vietnam of Chinese descent called the Hoa or 華. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Hoa were severely persecuted by the new Communist government; many had their property and businesses confiscated.\n\nIn 1978, large numbers of Hoa people began to leave or were expelled from Vietnam. Hundreds of thousands boarded boats and scattered to Hong Kong and countries across Southeast Asia. Many of these refugees — dubbed \"boat people\" in the media — would not survive the journey, facing typhoons, pirate attacks, starvation, illness and more on overcrowded, makeshift vessels.\n\nAnd among these hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese boat people were my parents and their families.\n\nThe process of turning my life into a film\n\nWhen it came time to start animating the film, I decided to use a traditional animation style that requires painting every frame. Although this is a very slow and repetitive process, I took it as an opportunity to rediscover and explore traditional Chinese landscape ink paintings and calligraphy.\n\nPreproduction on this film started in 2020 … and then COVID-19 hit. All my plans went out the window; flexibility and adaptability became my most important skills. I had to build a professional-quality studio at home, and that's where I created all the animations for the film.\n\nTo top it all off, my daughter was born in the middle of all this.\n\nIt was surreal to go through the process of trying to figure out a name for my daughter while looking into the meaning and significance of my own name.\n\nAs a kid, I did not like that I had a hard-to-pronounce name. When someone assumed I was foreign, I would instantly correct them and say, \"I am Canadian — I was born here,\" almost as if I was embarrassed to be anything else.\n\nNow, I am happy to represent all my cultures by embracing my many names."
