Grow in power and strength to take on larger creatures and bigger challenges.

Carnivores can team up in a pack to hunt larger dinosaurs, and herbivores must defend themselves and their food sources by gathering in herds. Whether you are a fishing Spinosaurus or a charging Eotriceratops, make the most of your abilities to survive!\n\nSubmerge fully underwater and hunt for AI fish and avoid being chomped by prehistoric crocodiles. Lurk just under the surface and lunge out of the water to surprise unsuspecting prey. Traverse the complex redwood river system and explore the depths of the swampy lakes.
