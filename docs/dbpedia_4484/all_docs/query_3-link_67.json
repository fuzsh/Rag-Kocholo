(Nasdaq: PHAT), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel treatments for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2024, and provided recent business updates.\n\n“Our impressive progress through the second full quarter of launch highlights the strong and growing demand for VOQUEZNA, an innovative treatment now approved across the entire GERD market,” said Terrie Curran, President and CEO of Phathom. “Following our recent FDA approval and the expanded label for VOQUEZNA last month, we immediately began promotional efforts to ensure millions of Non-Erosive GERD sufferers, and their physicians, are informed about this powerful new treatment option. We are very excited by the growth across all key metrics and the positive feedback from those who have experienced the benefits of VOQUEZNA. Additionally, with commercial coverage secured for over 116 million estimated lives, we are in a strong position to expand our patient base and ensure broad access to our first-in-class therapy. We remain dedicated to building VOQUEZNA into a potential blockbuster and are committed to our mission to change the treatment landscape for acid-related disorders.\"\n\nRecent Business Highlights and Second Quarter 2024 Results:\n\nVOQUEZNA Launch Progress:\n\nThe commercial launch of VOQUEZNA continued to accelerate with total product demand and filled prescriptions growing throughout the second quarter 2024. As of July 26, 2024, total estimated prescription demand for VOQUEZNA tablets, VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK®, and VOQUEZNA DUAL PAK® now exceeds 122,000 prescriptions written, compared to 43,000 at the company’s last quarterly report, a 184% increase. Total prescription demand represents the cumulative number of prescriptions that have been written, regardless of whether the prescription has been filled or dispensed. Over 60,000 prescriptions for VOQUEZNA products have been filled, launch to date, through both retail pharmacies and patient support at BlinkRx, an increase of more than 240% compared to 17,500 filled prescriptions as of the company’s last quarterly report. The sequential growth of filled prescriptions for the second quarter 2024 alone surpassed 265% with over 35,000 prescriptions for VOQUEZNA products filled, compared to approximately 9,500 filled prescriptions in the first quarter 2024.\n\nThe prescriber base for VOQUEZNA is also rapidly expanding with prescribers growing over 115% since the company’s last quarterly report. As of July 19, 2024, total filled prescriptions were generated by more than 8,200 cumulative prescribers.\n\nPhathom continues to make significant progress securing and expanding commercial coverage for VOQUEZNA. Over 116 million commercially covered lives in the U.S. now have access to VOQUEZNA tablets, comprising an estimated 77% of total U.S. commercial lives. On July 30, 2024, Phathom announced that CVS Caremark, the largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) in the U.S., added VOQUEZNA tablets to its national formularies for its more than 26 million commercially insured members. In addition, UnitedHealthcare, one of the largest commercial health plans in the U.S., added VOQUEZNA tablets to its national Prescription Drug List (PDL) for its more than 12 million Employer and Individual (Commercial) members.\n\nRecent Business and Regulatory Highlights:\n\nOn July 18, 2024, Phathom announced the FDA approval of VOQUEZNA 10 mg tablets for the relief of heartburn associated with Non-Erosive GERD in adults. This marked the third FDA approval for VOQUEZNA, which is also approved to treat all severities of Erosive GERD and related heartburn, and in combination with antibiotics for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. The approval was supported by the positive results from the PHALCON-NERD-301 study, where VOQUEZNA met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a significant and rapid reduction of heartburn with daily treatment. VOQUEZNA represents the first major innovation in GERD treatment in over 30 years and the only FDA-approved treatment of its kind available in the U.S.\n\nPhathom plans to initiate a separate Phase 3 Non-Erosive GERD program later this year to investigate As Needed dosing of VOQUEZNA for active heartburn episodes, a unique and differentiated dosing regimen for which PPIs are not approved in the U.S.\n\nPhathom plans to initiate a Phase 2 study to investigate VOQUEZNA as a potential treatment for Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) in adults and adolescents by the end of the year.\n\nSecond Quarter Financial Results:\n\nRevenue: Net revenues for the second quarter 2024 were $7.3 million related to sales of VOQUEZNA, VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK, and VOQUEZNA DUAL PAK. There were no revenues for the second quarter 2023 due to the launch of VOQUEZNA taking place in the fourth quarter 2023.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses: R&D expenses for the second quarter 2024 were $7.4 million, a decrease of $5.4 million compared to $12.8 million for second quarter 2023. The decrease was a result of lower chemistry manufacturing and controls activity, decreased personnel costs, and lower clinical trial expenses due to the wrap-up of activities related to the Phase 3 PHALCON-NERD-301 daily dosing study.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses: SG&A expenses for the second quarter 2024 were $75.9 million, an increase of $57.0 million compared to $18.9 million for second quarter 2023. The increase was a result of higher personnel costs and increased activity related to the ongoing buildout of commercial infrastructure and marketing activity in support of the launch of VOQUEZNA products.\n\nNet loss: Net loss for the second quarter 2024 was $91.4 million, compared to $41.0 million for the second quarter 2023. Second quarter 2024 net loss included a non-cash charge related to stock-based compensation of $6.1 million compared to $7.3 million for second quarter 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the second quarter 2024 was $73.3 million compared to $27.8 million for the same period in 2023. These non-GAAP adjusted net losses, more fully described below under \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" exclude non-cash stock-based compensation charges, non-cash interest expense related to the accounting for our revenue interest financing liability, which are in excess of the actual interest owed, and interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount on our term loan. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the tables below.\n\nCash and cash equivalents: As of June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $276.2 million. Up to an additional $125.0 million is also available under the Company’s term loan with Hercules.\n\nCash runway: Based on its current cash resources and operating plan, including expected product revenues, and the funds potentially available under its existing term loan, the Company believes it will have sufficient capital to fund operations through the end of 2026.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nPhathom will host a conference call and webcast to discuss its second quarter financial results and business highlights today, August 8, 2024, at 8:30 am ET. A live webcast will be available on the investors page of Phathom’s website under Events & Presentations. A replay of the webcast will be available following the completion of the event and will be archived for up to 90 days.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release includes financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), and also certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, Phathom has provided non-GAAP adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share, adjusted to exclude the items below. Non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, Phathom believes the presentation of non-GAAP adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share, when viewed in conjunction with GAAP results, provides investors with a more meaningful understanding of ongoing operating performance. These measures exclude (i) non-cash stock-based compensation, which is substantially dependent on changes in the market price of common shares, (ii) interest expense related to the accounting for our revenue interest financing liability, which are in excess of the actual interest owed, and (iii) interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount on our term loan.\n\nPhathom believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding Phathom's results of operations. When GAAP financial measures are viewed in conjunction with these non-GAAP financial measures, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of Phathom's ongoing operating performance and are better able to compare Phathom's performance between periods. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among those indicators Phathom uses as a basis for evaluating performance, and planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between these non-GAAP measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided later in this press release.\n\nAbout Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nPhathom Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel treatments for gastrointestinal diseases.
