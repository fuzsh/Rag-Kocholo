A Malaysian hip-hop duo, Too Phat were made up of members Joe Flizzow (born Johan Ishak on October 16, 1979, in Kuala Lumpur) and Malique Ibrahim (born Johore Bahru on August 21, 1977). The two came together in the late '90s, and by 1999 were releasing their first singles. The work coalesced into a full-length album, Plan B. Plan B went on to be a major hit in their home nation, and led to a strong and successful career. After recording and releasing their 2005 platter, Rebirth into Reality, Too Phat put out a handful of compilation work, and Flizzow began a new label, Kartel Records. It was on Kartel that Flizzow began a solo career, with the 2008 album The President. Rumored to be out of the music game at one point, it turned out that Malique Ibrahim was also working on a collection of his own, tentatively titled OK.
