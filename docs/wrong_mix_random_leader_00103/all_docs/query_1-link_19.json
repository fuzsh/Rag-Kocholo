        "text": "For the American basketball player, see Billy Preston (basketball).\n\nWilliam Everett Preston (September 2, 1946 â€“ June 6, 2006) was an American keyboardist, singer and songwriter whose work encompassed R&B, rock, soul, funk, and gospel. Preston was a top session keyboardist in the 1960s, during which he backed artists such as Little Richard, Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, the Everly Brothers, Reverend James Cleveland, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. He gained attention as a solo artist with hit singles such as \"That's the Way God Planned It\", the Grammy-winning \"Outa-Space\", \"Will It Go Round in Circles\", \"Space Race\", \"Nothing from Nothing\", and \"With You I'm Born Again\". Additionally, Preston co-wrote \"You Are So Beautiful\", which became a #5 hit for Joe Cocker.\n\nPreston is the only non-Beatle musician to be given a credit on a Beatles recording at the band's request; the group's 1969 single \"Get Back\" was credited as \"The Beatles with Billy Preston\". He continued to record and perform with George Harrison after the Beatles' breakup, along with other artists such as Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones on many of the group's albums and tours during the 1970s. On May 12, 2021, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced that Preston would be inducted with the Musical Excellence Award.\n\nLife and career\n\nEarly life\n\nPreston was born September 2, 1946, in Houston and moved to Los Angeles as a child with his mother Robbie Lee Williams. Noted as a child prodigy, Preston was entirely self-taught and never had a music lesson. By the age of ten, he was playing organ onstage backing several gospel singers such as Mahalia Jackson. At 11, Preston appeared on an episode of Nat King Cole's NBC TV show singing the Fats Domino hit \"Blueberry Hill\" with Cole. He appeared in St. Louis Blues, the 1958 W. C. Handy biopic starring Cole; Preston played with Handy at a younger age.\n\nIn 1962, Preston joined Little Richard's band as an organist, and it was while performing in Hamburg that he met the Beatles. In 1963, he played the organ on Sam Cooke's Night Beat album and released his own debut album, 16 Yr. Old Soul, for Cooke's SAR label. In 1965, he released the album The Most Exciting Organ Ever and performed on the rock and roll show Shindig! In May or June of 1965, he had a session with Little Richard and Jimi Hendrix in New York City, yielding the soul classic dirge \"I Don't Know What You've Got\". In 1967, he joined Ray Charles' band. Following this exposure, several musicians began asking Preston to contribute to their sessions.\n\nThe Beatles\n\nPreston is among those sometimes known as the \"Fifth Beatle\". After befriending the group in 1962, Preston joined the Get Back sessions in January 1969. At one point John Lennon proposed the idea of having Preston join the band; Paul McCartney countered it was difficult enough reaching agreements with four. Preston played organ and electric piano for the Beatles during several of the Get Back sessions; some of these sessions appeared in the film Let It Be and on its companion album. Footage of their collaboration appeared in the 2021 documentary The Beatles: Get Back directed by Peter Jackson. Preston accompanied the band on electric piano for its rooftop concert, the group's final public appearance. In April 1969, their single \"Get Back\" was credited to \"The Beatles with Billy Preston\", the only time an artist was credited as a co-performer with The Beatles after the band started recording as independent artists. The credit was bestowed by the Beatles to reflect the extent of Preston's presence on the track; his electric piano is prominent throughout and he plays an extended solo. Preston also worked, in a more limited role, on the 1969 Abbey Road album, contributing organ to the tracks \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" and \"Something\".\n\nIn 1978, he appeared as Sgt. Pepper in Robert Stigwood's film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which was based on the Beatles' album of the same name, and sang and danced to \"Get Back\" as the penultimate song.\n\nPost-Beatles solo career\n\nSigned to the Beatles' Apple label, in 1969, Preston released the album That's the Way God Planned It, produced by George Harrison, the title song from which was a hit single in Britain. His association with Harrison continued after the Beatles' breakup in 1970; Preston was the first artist to record Harrison's subsequent international hit \"My Sweet Lord\", on his 1970 album Encouraging Words, which Harrison co-produced with him. He appeared on several of Harrison's 1970s solo albums, starting with All Things Must Pass; made a notable contribution to the Concert for Bangladesh, the Harrison-organized 1971 charity benefit; performed with the ex-Beatle on his 1974 tour of North America; and played at the 2002 Concert for George tribute, held at Royal Albert Hall. Preston worked on solo releases by Lennon and Ringo Starr.\n\nIn 1971, Preston left Apple and signed with Herb Alpert's A&M Records. The previous year, he contributed to another hit single when Stephen Stills asked to use Preston's phrase \"if you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with\", a song on Stills's self-titled debut solo album.\n\nFollowing the release of I Wrote a Simple Song on A&M, Preston's solo career peaked at this time, beginning with 1972's \"Outa-Space\", an instrumental track that further popularized the sound of the clavinet in funk music. The song reached number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped Billboard's R&B chart, before going on to win the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. \"Outa-Space\" sold over 1 million copies in America, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in June 1972. Later that year, Preston contributed the title song to the hit blaxploitation film Slaughter starring Jim Brown.\n\nOver the next two years, Preston followed up with the US chart-topping singles \"Will It Go Round in Circles\" (which displaced Harrison's \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" at the top on July 7, 1973) and \"Nothing from Nothing\", and the number 4 hit \"Space Race\". Each of the three singles sold in excess of 1 million copies. American Bandstand host and executive producer Dick Clark enjoyed \"Space Race\" so much that he used the instrumental for the mid-show break for virtually the remainder of its run.\n\nFrom 1970, Preston played keyboards (including piano, organ, clavinet and various synthesizers) for the Rolling Stones, sometimes alongside pianists Nicky Hopkins and Ian Stewart, on their albums Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main St., Goats Head Soup, It's Only Rock 'n Roll and Black and Blue. As the band's primary touring keyboardist from 1973 to 1977, he performed as a support act with his own band (including Mick Taylor on guitar) on their 1973 European tour. A Munich performance from this tour was documented on Preston's album Live European Tour 1973. In 1974, along with Bruce Fisher, one of his regular songwriting collaborators in the 1970s, he composed one of Joe Cocker's biggest hits, \"You Are So Beautiful\". On October 11, 1975, he was the first musical guest on Saturday Night Live's series premiere episode. Preston's 1973 song \"Do You Love Me\" was the basis for the Rolling Stones' track \"Melody\", released on Black and Blue in 1976. Although two of his songs were included in the band's 1975 and 1976 (plus the El Mocambo) live sets, the Stones and Preston parted company in 1977, mainly due to a disagreement over money. He continued to play on solo records by Stones members like Mick Jagger's Wandering Spirit, and made appearances on the band's Tattoo You and Bridges to Babylon.\n\nAfter seven years with A&M, he signed with Motown. In 1979, he duetted with Syreeta Wright on the ballad \"With You I'm Born Again\", which reached number 4 on the charts in the US. He left Motown in 1984 and focused on session work, contributing to works by artists such as Luther Vandross (his organ solos were included on Vandross's 1985 hit \"Til My Baby Comes Home\"), Whitney Houston and Patti LaBelle, among others. He served as musical director for Nightlife, a late-night talk show hosted by David Brenner that lasted one season from 1986 to 1987.\n\nPreston toured with Eric Clapton, recorded with Gary Walker, one of the vocalists in his Los Angeles-based band, and worked with a wide range of other artists. He toured with Ringo Starr, appearing on his 1990 live album. He was invited to become a member of The Band in 1991, after the death of piano player Stan Szelest.\n\nLater work\n\nIn 1997, Billy Preston recorded the album You and I, in Italy, with Italian band Novecento. The album was produced by Vaughn De Spenza and Novecento members Lino and Pino Nicolosi. In 1998, Preston played organ during the choir numbers on the UPN comedy show Good News. The same year he sang and played synthesizer in the film Blues Brothers 2000, as part of the Louisiana Gator Boys supergroup.\n\nOn November 29, 2001, while touring and fighting his own health problems, Preston received the news that George Harrison had died, after a long illness. Preston, among many of Harrison's longtime friends, performed in the 2002 Concert for George at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Preston's performance of \"My Sweet Lord\" received critical acclaim. Additionally, he sang \"Isn't It a Pity\", provided backing vocals on most of the other songs, and played the Hammond organ for the show.\n\nIn 2002, Preston appeared on the Johnny Cash album American IV: The Man Comes Around, playing piano on \"Personal Jesus\" and \"Tear-Stained Letter\".\n\nIn 2004, Preston toured with the Funk Brothers and Steve Winwood in Europe, and then with Clapton in Europe and North America. After the Clapton tours, he went to France, where he was featured in one episode of the Legends Rock TV show. His performance included a duet with Sam Moore on \"You Are So Beautiful\"; this was Preston's last filmed concert.\n\nIn 2004, Preston performed as a jazz organist on Ray Charles's Genius Loves Company, an album of duets, on the song \"Here We Go Again\" with Charles and Norah Jones.\n\nIn March 2005, he appeared on the American Idol fourth-season finale. Playing piano, he performed \"With You I'm Born Again\" with Vonzell Solomon (who finished the contest in third place). The same year, he recorded \"Go Where No One's Gone Before\", the main title song for the anime series L/R: Licensed by Royalty.\n\nPreston played clavinet on the song \"Warlocks\" for the Red Hot Chili Peppers album Stadium Arcadium (2006). Although very ill by this point, he jumped out of his bed after hearing a tape of the song given to him by the band, recorded his part, and went back to bed. Preston's final recorded contributions were the gospel-tinged organ on the Neil Diamond album 12 Songs (2005), and his keyboard work on The Road to Escondido (2006) by Eric Clapton and J. J. Cale.\n\nIn late 2005, Preston made his last public performance, in Los Angeles, to publicize the re-release of the 1972 documentary film The Concert for Bangladesh. He played a set of three Harrison songsâ€”\"Give Me Love\", \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"Isn't It a Pity\"â€”with Dhani Harrison and Starr joining on guitar and drums, respectively, for the last song.\n\nPersonal life\n\nReligion\n\nPreston was brought up in the African-American gospel tradition; he was a committed Christian throughout his life and openly expressed his faith in works such as his 1970s hit \"That's the Way God Planned It\". His personal beliefs were sometimes at odds with the attitudes and musical expressions of the secular world of rock & roll in which he often worked, but he was apparently willing to put his religious views aside when working on tracks like John Lennon's openly atheistic song \"God\". Preston was deeply attached to his mother, for whom he wrote the song that became his best-known composition, \"You Are So Beautiful\".\n\nDeath\n\nPreston had suffered kidney disease in his later years, brought on by his hypertension. He received a kidney transplant in 2002, but his health continued to deteriorate. Preston died on June 6, 2006, in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nPreston's funeral was held June 21, 2006. At the funeral, which lasted almost three hours, Joe Cocker sang, Little Richard reminisced, and a brass band played a stirring version of \"Amazing Grace\". Other musical performers included The Temptations' lead vocalist Ali Woodson and singer Merry Clayton. A gospel choir, clad in bright red, sang throughout. The mourners also heard letters written by Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, and others who had toured and recorded with Preston. He was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.\n\nLegacy\n\nMiles Davis' 1974 album Get Up with It features a track called \"Billy Preston\" in his honor.\n\nRingo Starr, speaking during the rehearsals for the Concert for George in 2002, called Preston one of the greatest Hammond organ players of all time. In another interview Starr said, \"Billy never put his hands in the wrong place. Never.\"\n\nIn his introduction to the 2010 BBC Radio program Billy Preston: That's the Way God Planned It, former Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman said of Preston: \"Every keyboard player I know loves Billy Preston. You can spot his playing a mile off, whether it's the Hammond organ, the Fender Rhodes or the piano. He had such a spiritual touch to his technique; it made him completely unique.\"\n\nIn 2021, White Horse Pictures and Homegrown Pictures announced that they were making a documentary on Preston, to be directed by Paris Barclay.\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nPreston was nominated for nine Grammy Awards and won two. He won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for \"Outa-Space\" at the 15th Annual Grammy Awards in 1973. He also won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year for his participation in the album The Concert For Bangla Desh at the same ceremony. He was inducted into the Class of 2021 of the Rock and Roll Hall Fame with the Musical Excellence Award.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nYear Album Title Record Label Notes 1963 16 Yr.
