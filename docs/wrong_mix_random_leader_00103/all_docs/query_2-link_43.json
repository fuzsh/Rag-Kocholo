Billy Preston was a spectacular musician and keyboardist. He had a plethora of skills and all the soul to go with it, and many other big name artists noticed this. Preston was a top session keyboardist in the 1960s, playing with artists such as Ray Charles, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Little Richard, among many others. Preston also has an accolade that only he owns. He is the only non-Beatle musician to be given a credit on a Beatles recording. The 1969 single “Get Back” was credited as “The Beatles with Billy Preston,” and it was the only time that has ever happened. \n\nPreston started off at the age of 10 playing keyboards for gospel legend Mahalia Jackson. Later he joined Ray Charles’ touring band before recording with The Beatles on several of their tracks including “Get Back” and “Let It Be” (The Beatles considered him to be the fifth Beatle). He also played on a number of Sly & The Family Stone recordings and went on to have a successful solo career with five Top 10 US hits.\n\nPreston started writing this one night in the dressing room of an Atlanta nightclub where he was performing. He wanted to write a song based on the saying, “Nothing from nothing leaves nothing. The saloon piano gave it character,” Preston explained, “and I had a feeling it would be a hit because it was a sing-a-long kind of thing.” Enjoy\".",
