        "text": "It's discrete, unlike many A&M Q8's. I was \"working\" with this one the other day, and had the track \"Will it Go Round in Circles\" up on the PC, and it's totally discrete. There is even a harmonica that \"goes around in circles\" around the listening area.\n\nQuite frankly, I had forgotten about this one and wrote it off as being a \"crappy A&M Q8\". I was totally surprised.\n\nAt least mine was discrete! (USA - Blue Q8). I'll post a scan in a bit.\n\nFinally scored a Still Sealed copy of this Q8 and recieved it yesterday. After a couple of hours of repacking and rewinding it (why are sealed tapes always in the worst condition?) I gave the tape a play and while I can't say the mix is all that great, it is at least discrete.\n\nIt seems to be a one-sided mix as anything of importance happens on the right side. Drums are in right rear - always. Piano is slopped over to Front Right.\n\nLeft Rear has what sounds like a really nice vocal echo going on, and has the bass along with it, but it seems to be mixed quite low. I find myself having to turn down the other three to be able to hear left rear. At first listening, I almost thought it was a dead channel.\n\nFront Left seems to have a muffled lead vocal, while front right is quite clear. I don't know if this is just my copy, but it seems to be that in all songs, Front Left is muffled. Some slight bleed of the piano from Front Right.\n\nOn the song \"Will it go 'round in Circles\", it kinda cements my feeling that Left Rear is turned down too much in the mix because as the melodica spins around the room, it almost disappears when hitting left rear.\n\nAll in all, I give it a 5. Discrete, but not well thought out. Either poorly mixed at the console or limited by the source multi's.\n\nSuprised there's actually a poll for this one...\n\nDecided to pull the trigger after reading it's one of those rare discrete A&M titles (thanks fredblue for mentioning it!). First A&M Q8 I've added to my collection. Yes, it's one of those drums in RR, bass in RL mixes, but it seems like there is some slight reverb/blending of channels so it's not a total 4-corner isolation job like Tower of Power or ELO.\n\nI also found the left rear is out of balance- easily fixed in Audacity. I find with a lot of the tapes I record there are some subtle channel imbalances...I assume this is an azimuth-related issue? I'm too afraid to mess with the tape head settings, so I just tweak the files on the PC until I'm happy with the balance.\n\nSound quality is pretty good and the big hit \"Will It Go Round In Circles\" is a lot of fun in quad with the spinning harmonica. My favorites from A&M are still Quincy Jones' Body Heat and the Carpenter's Now & Then, but this one is definitely worth seeking out as well.\n\nI'd give it a 7."
