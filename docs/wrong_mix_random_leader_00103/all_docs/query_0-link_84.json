        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The late Billy Preston enjoyed a prodigious career as a performer, with nearly two dozen albums and hits such as “Outta Space,” “Will It Go Round in Circles” and “Nothing From Nothing.”\n\nBut on Saturday, Oct. 30, the singer, keyboardist and bandleader will receive a Musical Excellence Award from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to recognize his prolific work as a sideman and session hand -- for a music who’s-who list that includes Little Richard, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and many more. And it comes at a time one of Preston’s most celebrated collaborations is back in the spotlight.\n\nDuring January of 1969, shortly after playing with Ray Charles at London’s Royal Festival Hall, Preston was invited by George Harrison to take part in recording sessions with the Beatles that became part of the “Let It Be” album and film as well as the “Abbey Road” album. Preston’s contributions have been highlighted recently via new special edition releases of the album and the “Get Back” coffee table book, and he’ll certainly be featured even more in Peter Jackson’s “The Beatles: Get Back,” a three-episode, six-hour docuseries running Nov. 25-27 on Disney+.\n\n“It meant a lot to him,” says Joyce Moore, Preston’s former manager and now CEO of the Preston Music Group, Inc. “He absolutely treasured that time and treasured his relationship with the four guys, collectively and independently. They’ve been extremely respectful and extremely conscientious towards him in putting the ‘Let It Be’ projects together. Billy’s gotten his propers and is getting his proper, absolutely.”\n\nPreston -- who passed away June 6, 2006, at the age of 59 from a litany of health issues -- first met the Beatles in 1962, when he was a 16-year-old prodigy in Little Richard’s touring band at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany, and the British quartet opened. Because promoters fed Richard’s group but not the Beatles, Preston, according to Moore, would order extra food and pass it along to the group, which created a strong bond between them. The Beatles even asked Preston to join them on stage to jam, but Little Richard would not allow it.\n\nFast forward to 1969 and Preston was ushered into a somewhat troubled and unfocused Beatles project. Sessions earlier in the month at Twickingham Film Studios had not gone well, and the group switched to the basement studio in its Apple Corps headquarters to recoup its mojo.\n\nHarrison, who left the band briefly at Twickingham, was returning to the fold and suggested adding Preston to the mix when sessions resumed Jan. 22.\n\n“We’d always got on very well with him,” Paul McCartney remembers in “The Beatles Anthology. “He showed up in London and we said, ‘Oh, Bill! Great -- let’s have play on a few things.’ So he sat in on the sessions, because he was an old mate really.”\n\nGiles Martin, who mixed the audio for the new “Let It Be” reissues as well as the Jackson documentary, says Preston’s presence was crucial to the project.\n\n“He was an enormous influence on this whole thing,” Martin, son of the late Beatles producer George Martin, says. “Billy Preston made them behave. He brought this musicianship; He was younger than they were, and he was a remarkable musician and that made them play. It reminded them they weren’t just the Beatles hanging out; They had to actually play songs. Immediately they seem more focused with him in the room.”\n\nPreston, for his part, noticed some of the tension that was creeping into the band by then. “I think they had lost a bit of the joy of making music,” he once said. “There wasn’t’ much bickering in the studio...but when we’d break for lunch they’d start to talk about business. I was surprised to learn they’d gotten ripped off so many times. I learned a lot from them about that kind of thing.”\n\nPreston is credited with playing piano on five “Let It Be” songs and organ on two, including the title track. He also backed the band during its famed Jan. 30 rooftop concert that closes the “Let It Be” film, and when “Get Back” and “Don’t Let Me Down” were released as singles, they were credited to “the Beatles with Billy Preston,” the only time the group gave such a credit. He also recorded on two tracks (“Something,” “I Want You (She’s So Heavy)”) on “Abbey Road,” which was recorded after but released prior to “Let It Be.”\n\nThe idea of adding Preston to the band was broached but McCartney reportedly nixed it, telling his mates that, “It’s bad enough with four Beatles.”\n\nPreston was, however, rewarded with an Apple Records contract and released two albums with the label -- “That’s the Way God Planned It” in 1969 and “Encouraging Words” the following year, the latter of which featured the first recordings of Harrison’s “My Sweet Lord” and “All Things Must Pass” and is being re-released on vinyl Oct. 29 to coincide with the Rock Hall honor.\n\nPreston went on to play on solo albums by Harrison, John Lennon, Ringo Starr and played at Harrison’s “The Concert for Bangladesh.” He also made an appearance in the ill-conceived “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” film as the magical golden weather vane and was part of Ringo Starr’s inaugural All-Starr Band in 1989.\n\nThe Beatles chapter is significant but also just part of an epic career. Born in Houston, Preston was never took music lessons but was playing organ for gospel singers by the time he was 10. Preston appeared on Nat King Cole’s TV show when he was just 11 and joined Cole in “St. Louis Blues,” playing a young W.C. Handy. The stint with Little Richard led to jobs with Cooke and Charles, while Preston’s debut album, “16 Yr. Old Soul,” came out in 1963.\n\nPreston began working with the Rolling Stones on 1971′s “Sticky Fingers” album and was a featured performer on its 1975 Tour of the Americas. He co-wrote “You Are So Beautiful,” which Joe Cocker turned into a hit during 1974, and also stacked up credits with Sly and the Family Stone, Barbra Streisand, Peter Frampton, Elton John, Luther Vandross, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Neil Diamond, good friend Sam Moore (of Sam & Dave) and many others.\n\nAll of that certainly makes Preston a worthy Musical Excellence Award winner. But estate manager Moore hopes that his entry into the Rock Hall will be viewed as an honor for his full career -- much like Starr’s own induction became back in 2015.\n\n“(A sideman) is not all of who he was,” Moore says. “But I’m thrilled he’s getting in. It’s certainly well-deserved, and it was something Billy had hoped for and wanted when he was alive. It was something that was heavy on his heart all those years, but it wasn’t to be while he was alive.\n\n“So this is bittersweet. It’s long overdue and warranted and worthy. I’m just sad that he’s not here, because I know how much he would have enjoyed it -- not from an egotistical view, just for the acceptance and honor and recognition of which he knew God gave him, which was his genius.”"
