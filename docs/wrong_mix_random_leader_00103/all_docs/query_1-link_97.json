He is raised in Los Angeles, California. Aside from being a sought-after session musician for acts like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, the affable performer with the gap-toothed grin becomes a star in his own right with a number of funky hits throughout the ‘70s.\n\nHappy Birthday Billy Preston!!!\n\nA child prodigy, the self-taught keyboardist hones his talents in church, where he backs some of the biggest names in gospel like Mahalia Jackson and James Cleveland at just 10 years old. By the time he’s 16, he releases his debut album, 16 Yr. Old Soul, through Sam Cooke’s SAR label, tours with Little Richard, and meets the Beatles. In the meantime, he joins Ray Charles’ band and becomes a sought-after session musician.\n\n#TheBeatles #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr #Legends #Singer #Songwriter #Artist #Composer #Music #Rock #ClassicRock #RockNRoll #RockStar #RockLegend #RockBand #RockMusic #Pop #PopStar #PopLegend #PopMusic #MusicLegend #Lennon #McCartney #Harrison #BillyPreston #60s #Classic #rockhistation\n\n(What is your favorite Billy Preston song?)\n\n(tag the friends you want to listen with and comment below!)\n\nvia: @ucoofficial @rockhistation\".",
