        "text": "After making his mark on the latterday Beatles, Preston was given a relatively free hand when he signed to A&M as a solo artist in 1971, opening his account with the label by releasing a gospel album. The following year’s Music Is My Life deftly blended soul and rock, with Will It Go Round In Circles? landing him at the top of the US singles chart.\n\nRather than consolidating earlier successes, this 1973 album found Preston stretching his canvas across a myriad of styles, dipping his toe in the waters of big band jazz on How Long Has This Train Been Gone? and instrumental funk on Space Race. There’s even a smidgen of folk – albeit spruced up with dance rhythms – in the form of a cover of Bob Dylan’s It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding).\n\nUltimately, though, there’s perhaps too much experimentation – too many shifts in moods; the closing Minuet For Me sounding like little more than a desire to click the box marked “classical” alongside all the other genres. An interesting enough exercise, but not as satisfying as Preston’s previous releases."
