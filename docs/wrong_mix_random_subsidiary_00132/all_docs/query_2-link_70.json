        "text": "Katie’s family used Kennelwood Pet Resorts to board their pets for many years before she began her career here in 2012, as a second shift boarding attendant. Katie became a Boarding Lead in 2017 and is now the Pet Activities Manager at our Page & Lindbergh Pet Resort. Katie has always had a love and passion for all animals. She graduated from Murray State University with a Bachelor of Science in Zoology. As part of her curriculum, she was able to partake in many pre-vet/vet tech classes, gaining valuable knowledge and skills she applies everyday at work. “The best part of my job is getting to know all the pets and learning their unique personalities and quirks. It’s so rewarding when they get just as excited to see me as I am to see them. I enjoy getting to know our pet parents, too. It feels like we’re one big family.” Katie can’t wait to meet you and your pet!\n\n[email protected]"
