All she knows is that her mother is white, she’s never met her father, and she looks nothing like the rest of her family. She can’t even talk about it because everyone says it shouldn’t matter!\n\nWell, it matters to Lucie and-with her new friend Nav, who knows exactly who he is-she’s determined to find some answers.\n\nWhat do you do when your entire existence is a question with no answer?\n\nYou do a DNA test.\n\nBOOK TASTERS\n\nBOOK BLOGGERS- SPOTLIGHT\n\nGOOD NIGHT TO READ MINI REVIEW\n\nAmanda Addison explores a myriad of themes in her debut YA novel and raises many thought provoking questions. The result is a melange of ideas twisting and turning like the strands of DNA.\n\nStructured in the form of a diary, the book spans 18 year old Lucie’s journey of self discovery, the butterfly effect of her genetic investigations and how her newly acquired knowledge informs her creativity and artistry. Encouraged by the scientific and analytical Nav, who she has met by chance, she unearths family secrets.\n\nAlthough Lucie and Nav’s views and inquisitive minds initially dominate the narrative, readers will be surprised by converging voices, conflicting opinions and flashbacks to the 1990s. Who has been lying to Lucie?\n\nAddison’s writing philosophises about ancestry and heritage. She captures the frustration felt by mixed race British citizens when they are judged by strangers for the colour of their skin.\n\nLooking For Lucie has a lot to recommend it. Addison has created multi faceted characters who are growing into their identities. Lucie’s half sister Maisie has a life choice to make and the adults also have lessons to learn. Addison shines a spotlight on the nature vs nurture debate while looking at the influences of art and culture, the patterns of language and mathematics, socio-politics and the science of DNA.\n\nThis is a read that is a hybrid of intellectual conversations, scientific facts and cultural musings. While the content is informative and intelligent, it overshadows the mystery at the heart of the story at times. Verging on the didactic at points it detracts from the suspense. Nevertheless, overall it does deliver an important message of diversity and inclusion. As Addison observes,\n\nWhat is significant is that we are all global citizens revolving around diasporic identities. Lucie’s art lecturer Roisin is both Irish and Gujarati. The book teaches young readers empathy and understanding with its overall message that we should be proud of who we are and celebrate our global ancestry.\n\nGOOD NIGHT TO READ REVIEW RATING- 3.75 CHOCOLATE LIBRARIES\n\nFIVE FACTS ABOUT AMANDA ADDISON\n\nAmanda’s picture book ‘Boundless Sky’, illustrated by Manuela Adriani, is an empathetic read about two migrations and was nominated for the CILIP Kate Greenaway Medal for illustration in 2021.\n\nShe is interested in themes of art and science, home and belonging.\n\nA graduate of Chelsea school of Art, her writing and artwork are inspired by travel, textiles, and the natural world.\n\nAmanda’s body of work includes flash fiction, short stories, picture books and novels.\n\nAmanda lives in Norfolk and enjoys wild swimming in the North Sea\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nTitle: Looking For Lucie\n\nAuthor: Amanda Addison\n\nPublisher: Neem Tree Press\n\nPublication date: April 2024\n\nISBN: 9781911107682\n\nLength: 264pp\n\nGenre: Contemporary Fiction, Concepts\n\nThemes: Art, Culture, Family, Genealogy, Genetics, Identity\n\nAge group: YA\n\nBEYOND THE BOOK\n\nAsk Yourself\n\nHAVE YOU VISITED YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY TO USE THEIR SEARCH TOOLS TO INVESTIGATE YOUR ANCESTRY?\n\nWhere do you come from?\n\nHave you ever explored your family genealogy?\n\nDo you know your extensive family tree?\n\nHave you ever looked at your ancestry in a pie chart?\n\nHow many countries make up your heritage?\n\nHave any of their cultural influences affected your life?\n\nWhat exact ethnic percentages are you made up of?\n\nREAD MORE AT\n\nhttps://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/featuredarticles/2023\n\nhttps://www.history.ac.uk/library/collections/genealogy\n\nEASTERN AND WESTERN ART UNDER THE LENS\n\nLucie’s art is inspired by her heritage.

Thirty-five people accused of witchcraft. Seven condemned to death. Six strangled and burned at the stake. All accused by eleven-year-old Christian Shaw.\n\nBargarran House, 1722. Christian Shaw returns home, spending every waking hour perfecting the thread bleaching process that will revive her family’s fortune. If only she can make it white enough, perhaps her past sins will be purified too.\n\nBut dark forces are at work. As the twenty-fifth anniversary of the witch burnings approaches, ravens circle Bargarran House, their wild cries stirring memories and triggering visions.\n\nAs Christian’s mind begins to unravel, her states of delusion threaten the safety of all those who cross her path.\n\nHer fate hangs by a thread.\n\nBOOK TASTERS\n\nBOOK BLOGGERS- SPOTLIGHT\n\nGOOD NIGHT TO READ MINI REVIEW\n\nVictoria Williamson infuses her latest novella with symbolism worthy of Shakespeare\n\nas her deluded protagonist Christian unleashes an obsessive need to achieve purity by bleaching her thread “white as the first snows of winter.”\n\nHaunted by the guilt of past sins and the clamouring cries of raucous ravens, she recalls her bouts of sleepwalking and memory lapses when she was a child only to awake in the dawn with bloody witness on her body.\n\nDelineated by chapter headings pertaining to the components of weaving, the narrative is effectively broken into two historical periods- 1697 and 1722. The past is represented by a raven [symbolising the child Christian in the first person] and a needle and thread [representing the adult Christian in the third person].\n\nThe story explores a myriad of themes including the curiosity, fear and shame associated with the natural acts of periods and childbirth in a child’s mind in the 17th century [reflective in some ways of period shaming today],\n\nScarlet rags and raven women…in the dark”\n\nguilt, hallucinations, hysteria, madness, scapegoating, the class structure and the trials of poverty.\n\nWilliamson’s writing is visceral with evocative imagery and disturbing scenes of horror, madness and trauma. She captures the fragmented psychology of Christian, the tragedy of the slaughter of the innocent and the danger of false accusations feeding religious piety, prejudice, superstition and hatred to the point of no return.\n\nThis book shines a spotlight on the injustice of the Bargarran Witch Craft trials and creates many questions about what motivated an 11 year old child to accuse and lie and why the adults encouraged her to do so.\n\nA spine tingling, startling read with a Faustian vibe, a gothic heart and a Shakespearean voice that is not for the faint hearted. It will chill and thrill in equal measure.\n\nGOOD NIGHT TO READ REVIEW RATING- 4 CHOCOLATE LIBRARIES\n\nFIVE FACTS ABOUT VICTORIA WILLIAMSON\n\nVictoria volunteered on digs with Archaeology Scotland.\n\nHer novel Hag Storm explored the life of Robert Burns in 18th Century Scotland.\n\nVictoria volunteered with The Book Bus charity in Zambia\n\nShe visits festivals, schools and library events to talk to children and educators about the important issues she raises in her books.\n\nVictoria’s launch of Red Runs the Witch’s Thread was supported by the staff and volunteers of the Paisley Book Festival.\n\nEXPLORING THE HISTORY OF SCOTLAND\n\nRed Runs the Witch Thread is inspired by the terrible Witch trials which took place in Paisley, Scotland in 1697 when the 11 year old daughter of the Laird, afflicted by hysteria and lies, condemned innocents to a grisly death.\n\nWilliamson creates a chilling supernatural tale imagining the psychological state of Christian Shaw in 1722, 25 years after the crime. While attempting to reinvent herself as a businesswoman in control of thread manufacturing, she is haunted by wicked visions of the past, struggling to hold on to her sanity.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nTitle: Red Runs the Witch’s Thread\n\nAuthor: Victoria Williamson\n\nPublisher: Silver Thistle Press\n\nPublication date: April 11th 2024\n\nLength: Novella\n\nGenre: Gothic, Historical, Supernatural\n\nAge group: YA/Adult\n\nBEYOND THE BOOK\n\nTHE SCOTTISH PLAY\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s play Macbeth, also known as “Scottish Play” has themes which recur in Red Runs the Witch’s Thread.

It reminds me of Good Night To Read’s motto, ‘Because Books Make the World Better.’\n\nA Swift’s plight is captured in a DPS of cascading rhyme as two children resolve to bring it back to health. The panoramic illustrations engage the eye while the facial expressions of Aria and Yusuf reflect an array of emotions. Closeups, vignettes and clever use of space convey different perspectives across the rooftops and minarets of a middle eastern city highlighting the dangers of air pollution and importance of regeneration.\n\nIt’s a tale of friendship and illustrates how a simple act of kindness can make a difference. Young readers will see how they can change their environment for the better by conserving nature and protecting birdlife.\n\nWhile the dual language aspect of the book is positive, one quibble is that the Arabic text is miniaturised and mostly in white which blends into the pale backdrops chosen for many of the pages. This makes it more difficult to see. A bolder and darker typeface would be more effective.\n\nRATING- 3.5 CHOCOLATE LIBRARIES\n\nFIVE FACTS ABOUT FIONA BARKER\n\nFiona works as an audiologist\n\nFiona enjoys writing picture books that celebrate nature, the animal world and friendship\n\nShe appreciates alliteration but is not a slave to rhyme.\n\nWhen reading, Fiona “looks for a marriage of words and artwork and loves anything that is fun to read aloud.”\n\nShe has also collaborated with Howard Gray on Setsuko and the Song of the Sea which stresses the importance of marine conservation, and Danny & the Dream Dog which is “a heart warming story about finding friendship in unexpected places.”\n\nFIVE FACTS ABOUT HOWARD GRAY\n\nGrowing up Howard was always fascinated by animals and nature.\n\nHoward is an academic and an artist.

Each story is complemented by a black and white illustration, drawing out the visually evocative nature of the writing and offering readers a unique artistic delight.\n\nTHE STORIES\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn these 8 illustrated short stories, Caravaggio, Monet, Van Gogh, Géricault and others navigate the boundary between art and experience through masterfully written prose that reflects each artist’s style.\n\nThe collection culminates with “The Vanitas”, where Sandro Signorelli’s philosophy that a lifetime of faith and toil shall receive its just reward is challenged by the emergence of a new artist. Across town, Michelangelo Merisi is making seismic waves. The city of Rome cannot help but be captivated by this explosive eruption of talent, swagger, seduction, and violence, while Sandro’s life is plunged into crisis by a rival who does not even know his name.\n\nBOOK TASTERS\n\nWhat do you see?

Kendall’s magnum opus is a challenging love letter to the history of art, its betrayals, its passions, its disillusionments, its obsessions and its creative processes.\n\nThe Vanitas also celebrates forgotten voices and literary constructs. The piece of art that has inspired each story precedes it and encourages the reader to visualise and dream their own impressions.

This erudite biography doesn’t just explore her life. Lambton shines a spotlight on Callas’ craft critically evaluating the opera star’s singing with consummate care and precision down to the minutest detail and vocal technique behind each aria and dramatic role.\n\nThe book is divided into a prologue followed by 23 chapters, with headings taken from Maria’s musings. It sets the scene for the reader as it forensically examines her mythos, her psychology, her troubled upbringing, her discovery of her vocation, her insecurities, her perfectionism, her secret fears, the men she was unfortunate to become involved with, her struggles with her voice and how she inspired wonder and vitriol in equal measure. Above all it is a monumental testament to her art.\n\nIt’s vivid prose is informed by detailed primary and secondary sources including incendiary letters, vignettes, never before published missives and interviews discovered in library archives and digitised collections.\n\nLambton’s imagery illuminates Callas’ complex musicality so that the reader can visualise the performances and reflect on the beauty of her sounds when she was at the height of her fame. It crystallises each recording and opera performed by Callas, capturing the atmosphere, the highs and lows of being an acclaimed soprano and the dichotomy between victorious evenings of encores and fraught, tension filled nights when notes went awry.\n\nCallas’ health was a rollercoaster exacerbated by personal problems and marital strife but above all what she wanted more than anything was to be true to the composer and the spirit of the piece. To contemporary critics listening to Callas was\n\nShe was\n\nBut in spite of the magical aura she cast on opera goers, she was immensely fragile, mercurial, self critical and prone to self sabotage.\n\nLambton’s work depicts a nuanced portrait of Callas, taking into account her habit of contradicting herself, trusting the wrong people and sacrificing herself for her art, just like her opera heroines.\n\nThis biography will appeal to opera fans and musical aficionados. It’s useful to read it along with a glossary of opera terms as it is abundant with them. It should be savoured over many nights like a languorous dream not hurriedly gobbled. Lambton’s use of alliteration, mellifluous language and evocative scenes adds to its sensory impact, just like Callas’ voice and dramatic presence elevates her performances.\n\nGOOD NIGHT TO READ REVIEW RATING- 4.5 CHOCOLATE LIBRARIES\n\nQ & A Extravaganza\n\nSophia kindly consented to answer all of my questions.\n\nWhat inspired you to become a music journalist?\n\nLyrical expression is the closest to my own – which is another way of saying music gets to me more deeply than all other arts. I have a very particular writing process that treats creation like the stage: many more weeks are spent researching, preparing and planning than typing the text. In those long intervals I need to exercise my art in shorter bouts. At fourteen I already knew I wanted to report on at least one art. Music makes the most sense. I love it more than any other medium.\n\nWhen did your fascination with Maria Callas start?\n\nI listened to her through my teens and fell in love first with her voice (at fourteen-ish) and later with her as a person (seventeen). My first novel (an appalling work) was inspired by a giant misconception of her. I only got to know her after eighteen months (or so) of research.\n\nWhat is your favourite Maria Callas recording and why?\n\nOh, the cruelty of this question! Well, I’ll narrow down to three:\n\n1) Puccini’s Manon Lescaut (studio recording, 1957): Callas incarnates both the ravenous, spoilt girl Manon Lescaut and the languishing older seductress. The evolution – both in the music and her voice – exhibits shifts in characterisation that remain unparalleled throughout the Callas repertoire.\n\n2) Puccini’s Madama Butterfly (studio recording, 1955): The “little girl” voice here is achingly fragile, and Callas curves the syllables to imitate a geisha’s accent. There is such a dreamy danger in her voice: when she believes Lieutenant Pinkerton has come back to her – before she discovers he has married Kate – she marvels, “White… white… the American Star-Spangled flag” (“Bianca, Bianca… il vessillo americano delle stelle”) in a near-inexistent voice. It’s a squeak and yet retains its musicality. No other soprano could effectuate this. It is almost anatomically impossible.\n\n3) “Air des lettres” (“Werther… werther… qui m’aurait dit la place”) from Massenet’s Werther, live in concert at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on June 5th 1963.\n\nThis is a mezzo aria. Callas dissolves into her dusky register in tremulous surrender to the fate of Charlotte, whose beloved one Werther will kill himself. She slenderises certain phrases – like “je vous écris de ma petite chambre” (”I’m writing to you from my bedroom”) to exude fragility whilst salvaging the ebbing body of her voice: an instrument by this point semi-tarnished. The French critic Marcel Schneider wrote of this performance, “Nothing is more moving than this struggle of one of the greatest singers of all time against Nature, which seems to want to rob her of the voice it has given her.” But she conquered that night.\n\nWhy do you think Maria married Meneghini?\n\nShe said it herself in a letter to Eddie Bagarozy, shortly after she and Meneghini met: “God has given me this angelic person.” There are two reasons for this marriage that must be explained to a (much savvier) modern audience. The first is that Maria Callas did not really have a concept of a “hot guy”. She was not a very sexual woman and, having been deprived of paternal love from the age of thirteen – when her mother had taken her and sister Jackie to Athens – she was looking for a guardian. I also believe some people, regardless of their libido level, have taste when it comes to faces, and some don’t. When most people see Meneghini – including Callas’ cousin Ninon Dimitriadou-Kambouri – it is impossible to understand how a twenty-three-year-old woman would be drawn to this owl-faced, much older signor. We have to imagine she’s seeing someone else.\n\nThe other reason that must be explained is her naïveté. It didn’t occur to her that Meneghini, as a shrewd businessman, might be looking for an investment in her as a singer, even though he volunteered himself as her manager suspiciously early on in their relationship. When I consider it, I can’t envisage Joan Sutherland, Renata Tebaldi or most other sopranos agreeing to such an arrangement. Callas was just so uneducated. She wasn’t much of a reader, and certainly hadn’t been in her youth. Her teen years had been lived through World War II Athens: a frightful atrocity. Her formal schooling had ended in New York, when she’d been just thirteen.\n\nToday we learn of social norms at school, in books, tv, podcasts, articles, movies etc. She had news on the radio and no good parenting. And she wasn’t street-smart, contrary to what she might have thought.\n\nWhy do you think Maria eschewed performing modern opera?\n\nThis is where I empathise with her: I likewise am averse to modern opera. As a critic it’s my job to analyse performance, so I shut off those personal preferences when I have to. I can see the quality of an interpretation irrespective of my feelings for its music. Callas didn’t take to atonality and dissonance, and neither do I. So she couldn’t possibly consider singing Alban Berg’s Lulu or Samuel Barber’s Vanessa, both of which were suggested to her.\n\nWhat was the most fascinating fact that you discovered about Maria Callas during your research process?\n\nOnstage: She liked to bring her own costumes for performances when she felt the theatre’s were subpar. This ties in with a control freak-nature that would vet the stage designs before production could begin, and do her own make-up, and argue with directors like Luchino Visconti about when to take off a bonnet in character. Her contribution extended far beyond the part of the soprano soloist.\n\nOffstage: This is bizarre, but I haven’t mentioned it elsewhere in press about this book, so I’ll go ahead: Callas would study music in her bathroom, which was her haven. She had a bookcase there where she kept opera scores, as well as a sofa, a telephone and flowers. The faucets were cherry-coloured dolphins and the bath itself was pink and white marble.\n\nWhat’s your favourite opera performed by Maria Callas & why?\n\nI have two: La traviata and Madama Butterfly, but Manon Lescaut is close. My other favourite operas were never performed by Callas.\n\nBoth Traviata and Madama Butterfly preface their heroines’ state early on; drawing in their listeners with ominous foreshadowing. They juxtapose the jubilance of love with its lethality. They also allowed Callas to manipulate her voice to dangerous degrees – she talked about playing the consumption victim that is Traviata’s Violetta with a voice “on a little thread. It can break from one minute to another.”\n\nButterfly’s über-vulnerable heroine, Cio-Cio-san, leads Callas’ extremely malleable timbre into risky territory. There is a trill-like sound created from vibrato across many top notes that don’t have trills; it’s simply an exuberant effect made to portray the naïve youngling.\n\nBoth roles enabled Callas to display a psychological erosion in strong women left irreparably damaged.\n\nDo you have a favourite photograph of Maria Callas?\n\nThis is a very good question, because I actually dislike most of them. I really dislike the Angus McBean portraits (though I had his Vivien Leigh on my wall as a teenager). I really dislike the Cecil Beaton ones. Callas was very photogenic but a terrible model for the most part. Opera singers are used to making huge expressions (like expansive clownish eyes) for colossal auditoriums: I don’t think most of them respond well to photographers’ directions. My favourite photo is the one on my cover – Callas in a promotional shot as Anna Bolena (Anne Boleyn) in advance of her opening in the opera at La Scala in April 1957. It took me ages to select a photograph. I even considered capturing a still from a video at one point.\n\nA. Which library archive did you find most insightful in your research?\n\nThe Victoria & Albert Museum had the collection of her manager from 1953 to 1977, Sander Gorlinsky: it was indispensable. I lived around ninety minutes away then, and for three days straight I went over their exchanges, taking photographs of almost everything. I then spent most of 2014’s summer transcribing all their letters and a great deal of the batch’s documents. When – in conjunction with other letters, telegrams, documents and interviews – you get to piece together a nearly day-to-day chronology, it feels like a worthful achievement.\n\nThough I had always had faith in Callas’ continuing devotion to opera in the early sixties, unfortunately it is still falsely reported that she left that world for luxury aboard a yacht with boyfriend Aristotle Onassis. This is wrong. The quotations from these letters – together with those from others, documents and interviews from this period – absolutely prove this is a myth.\n\nB. Critics have waxed lyrical about her. Do you have a favourite quote that describes the nature of her remarkable voice?\n\nI’m so happy you asked because I’m going to use this opportunity to reproduce a quote I felt I had to cut down in the book. It’s more about Callas’ technique than her voice, and it’s not from a critic, so I’ll give a separate one for that.\n\nHere is EMI Records producer Walter Legge on Callas’ vocality:\n\nIn 1954 the Chicago Tribune’s Claudia Cassidy gorgeously described Callas’ then new figure together with her instrument:\n\nAn unnamed critic for Kunst und Kultur, reviewing her Lucia di Lammermoor in Vienna, referred beautifully to the “glimmering limbs of her flawless range.”\n\nIt was remarkable the way Maria coped with her myopia during performances. Do you think that was why she insisted on such long rehearsal periods or did she have other reasons?\n\nI actually don’t think that was why she insisted on long rehearsals. She was a compulsive perfectionist, and that cost her her blood pressure – which tanked to sometimes lethal lows, and it cost her her nerves, and it could lead to bad performances. When Maria was up at 3.30am rehearsing La sonnambula, was this a good thing? I don’t know. She needed to feel she had done her best. That is the foremost reason any control freak perfectionist stretches their work hours.”\n\nFIVE FACTS ABOUT SOPHIA\n\nSophia is a novelist. The fourth volume of her saga The Crooked Little Pieces comes out on 2 September, and she is currently working on the third part of her second literary series.\n\nShe is a devoted figure skating competition follower, and has adored many skaters and teams over the years. These include Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, Ashley Wagner, Anna Shcherbakova, Javier Fernández, Jason Brown, and her current diehard favourites Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier.\n\nSophia is a multi linguist. She has a command of French, Russian, German, Latin and Ancient Greek which enabled her to study “a global panoply of primary and secondary sources” as part of her extensive research journey. She also taught herself “just about passable Italian” to research, conduct interviews and translate documents in preparation for The Callas Imprint.\n\nShe is half English and half Russian Jewish and has recently discovered Inuit blood in her family too.\n\nSophia is interested in neurological studies, in particular the work of Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky, author of the recently released Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nTitle: The Callas Imprint: A Centennial Biography\n\nAuthor: Sophia Lambton\n\nPublisher: Crepuscular Press\n\nISBN: 9781739286323 [Hbk]\n\nISBN: 9781739286347 [Pbk]\n\nISBN: 9781739286392 [E-Book]\n\nPublication date: 2 December 2023\n\nLength: 704 pp [Including comprehensive bibliography, footnotes and index]\n\nDISCOVER MORE\n\nLambton’s cultural Substack provides copious reviews of operas, concerts and recitals juxtaposed with vivid explorations of tv and film and literary snippets.\n\nhttp://www.sophialambton.substack.com\n\nsophia@thecrepuscularpress.com\n\nCALLAS IMPRINT\n\nhttp://www.thecrepuscularpress.com/the-callas-imprint\n\nEXPLORE A GLOSSARY OF OPERA TERMS HERE\n\nhttps://www.glyndebourne.com/opera-archive/introduction-to-opera/glossary\n\nhttps://www.glyndebourne.com/opera-archive/explore-our-operas/explore-don-pasquale/don-pasquale-a-guide-to-bel-canto\n\nEco Thriller Blog Tour- War of the Wind by Victoria Williamson\n\n20% of the author royalties for this novel will be donated to the British Deaf Association.\n\nCHARACTER ACROSTICS\n\nMortified\n\nAngry\n\nX auditory\n\nBullied\n\nEager\n\nAddicted\n\nNervous\n\nInnovative\n\nExasperated\n\nDecoder\n\nAstute\n\nVehicular\n\nIntelligent\n\nDependent\n\nEdgy\n\nResourceful\n\nIndignant\n\nNurturing\n\nConcerned\n\nAwkward\n\nLaughing\n\nUnsettled\n\nManipulated\n\nAmoral\n\nSinister\n\nHeartless\n\nWicked\n\nOmnipresent\n\nObserver\n\nDangerous\n\nBOOK BITE\n\nAn electrifying, fast paced eco thriller celebrating diversity and inclusivity.\n\nBOOK HAIKU\n\nMax feels angry and\n\nfrustrated as evil creeps\n\nnear to his island.\n\nSoon he will discover he must never judge a book by its cover.\n\nWhirring off the shore\n\nthoughts go askew as malaise\n\nswallows and consumes.\n\nNefarious plots\n\nput an island’s people at\n\nrisk as tensions mount.\n\nCan Max and his friends prevail\n\nas they hunt the villain’s trail?\n\nBLURB\n\nSCRAGNESS ISLAND\n\nOn a remote Scottish island, fourteen-year-old Max’s life alters irrevocably after an accident.

Like Feast of Ashes it has environmental and dystopian elements which are integral to the plot. Add an atmospheric, isolated location, Manchurian Candidate vibes, scientific skulduggery, and intelligent teens seeking to foil corrupt government agents Alex Rider style and you get the idea.\n\nTold through a first person narrative, Williamson skilfully builds tension as an island community is disrupted by strange happenings. Suddenly, a class of children with additional support needs is caught up in the centre of a nefarious plot.\n\nThe book’s structure consists of five phases interlaced with flashback sequences as life on the island starts to get steadily worse, building up to a dramatic denouement which makes the heart race.\n\nWar of the Wind encompasses the universal themes of abuse, bullying, cruelty, friendship, jealousy, denial, frustration, misconceptions and prejudice. It is also not teen adventure centric. Max’s father has a secret which is affecting his son and causing an internal struggle. Extra stress and pressure caused by the seismic changes in the adult characters’ lives are also magnified by what’s happening on the island.\n\nWhile the story does make a grand effort to have complex, diverse and engaging characters, where it stumbles is Max’s continuous repetition of derogatory terms to describe his assisted learning classmates. Beanie and David are targets until he comprehends the damage of labels and slurs.\n\nMax also continually makes excuses for bad behaviour until he is educated by the fiery Erin. While it is part of his personal journey towards adapting and understanding, it starts to jar after a while and detracts from the thriller element and empathetic nature of the story.\n\nThis book will appeal to a Middle Grade audience who enjoy high stakes danger, scientific theory and techno spy thrillers.\n\nIt includes a map at the start and a British sign language guide to educate and focus the reader. A useful glossary of Scottish words and phrases is also available at the back.\n\nGOOD NIGHT TO READ REVIEW RATING- 3.5 CHOCOLATE LIBRARIES\n\nFIVE FACTS ABOUT VICTORIA WILLIAMSON\n\nVictoria has worked closely with children with additional support needs.\n\nShe is a patron of Reading with Char Char Literacy to promote early years phonics teaching in Malawi\n\nThe original idea for War of the Wind came from Victoria’s mother\n\nVictoria is passionate about creating inclusive worlds in her literature “where all children can see themselves reflected”\n\nShe grew up in Kirkintilloch, North Glasgow and is inspired by wild, adventurous landscapes.\n\nVICTORIA IN HER OWN WORDS\n\nON HER INSPIRATION\n\nON THE IMPORTANCE OF REPRESENTATION\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nTitle: War of the Wind\n\nAuthor: Victoria Williamson\n\nPublisher: Neem Tree Press\n\nISBN: 9781911107507\n\nPublication date: September 2022\n\nLength: 256 pp\n\nGenre: Eco Thriller\n\nThemes: Additional Support Needs, Ecosystems, Manipulation, The Media, Mobile Phones, Psychology, Renewable Energy, Trauma, Wind Farms\n\nAge group: 11+\n\nACCOLADES\n\nNominated for The Yoto Carnegies Medal for Writing 2024\n\nWinner of the YA-ldi Glasgow Secondary School Libraries’ Book Award 2023\n\nShortlisted for the Leeds Book Awards 2023\n\nLonglisted for the RED Book Awards 2023\n\nLonglisted for the South Coast Schools ABA Book Awards 2023\n\nBookTrust Book of the Month for February 2022\n\nA Financial Times Best YA Books of the Year 2022\n\nThe Scottish Book Trust Book of the Month for November 2022\n\nDISCOVER MORE\n\nBlog Tour: Spotlight: Clytemnestra’s Bind by Susan C.

Which book character would you choose to protect you from harm?\n\nDefinitely seriously fearless outlaw & bad ass Scarlett McCain from the Outlaws Scarlett & Browne by Jonathan Stroud. Check out the opening line:\n\nQuestion 2: You go on vacation and your hotel is located right next to a cemetery. Which book character do you really hope is not hiding in the shadows?\n\nScritch scratch. Scritch scratch. What is the secret behind the locked door? Laura Purcell’s chilling Silent Companions are a fright to behold. Equally Long Lankin. And I do not want Tall Jake to take me away either!\n\nQuestion 3: It’s a particularly cold night and you decide to stay inside. Which three book characters would you like to spend a trivia quiz and board game night with?\n\n1.Sherlock Holmes is an elementary first choice. He took on the Hound of the Baskervilles. 2. I’d also like Elizabeth Bennet because she’s witty and sharp as a tack [I choose the Zombie version for this tag] and 3. Katniss Everdeen because she’s quick with her arrows and would protect us from unwanted visitors.\n\nQuestion 4: Time for a big adventure! The scary book you pick transports you into its world. Where do you end up?\n\nFrankenstein, such a powerful Gothic read, created by a young woman with demons of her own. So many atmospheric and chilling scenes. A poignant portrait of abandonment and a powerful psychological study that still resonates today.\n\nQuestion 5: No Halloween without Trick or Treat-ing! Which book character do you think has the sweetest tooth?\n\nHas to be greedy Bruno Jenkins who doesn’t even let terrifying witches stop him from getting his paws on a bar of chocolate. Never mind the consequences!\n\nQuestion 6: The fairies are angry and want a sacrifice from your bookshelf. Which scary book has to go and why?\n\nDifficult question. I love Gothic literature but I hated The Monk by Matthew Lewis when I read it for my Gothic Literature course so it’s an easy sacrifice. I’m also not keen about the representation of women in Dracula.\n\nQuestion 7: You decide you feel more autumnal rather than halloween-y today. Which book setting would you choose for a more cosy and less scary vibe?\n\nIt has to be October October by Katya Balen. Such a beautifully lyrical and empathetic book. Also love W.B Yeats’ poem The Wild Swans at Coole.\n\nQuestion 8: The witch is cooking up a spell in her cauldron and you have to add one magic ingredient. Which item from a book are you adding to the mixture?\n\nThe magical Emerald Atlas for a transportation spell.\n\nQuestion 9: You get to decide which bookish place to visit for Halloween. Which book setting is the scariest – and gets crossed off the list?\n\nThe town from the Stepford Wives where women have been programmed to behave perfectly. So creepy. Equally the Republic of Gilead in The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood. Shudder.\n\nQuestion 10: The big day is finally here: it’s Halloween! Which book character do you dress up as, and what would be part of your outfit?\n\nHas to be the Morrigan Crow Goddess of Celtic mythology.\n\nIf you’re a fan of chilly thrills and have some book recommendations to send tingles up the spine check out this tag.

Drawing on her experiences of time spent working on literacy projects in Africa she creates a compelling black female lead who is psychologically complex. Told through a first person narrative, she begins her novel [clever word play in the title] with a jaw dropping opening line.\n\nThe plot is constructed in two parts, reflecting Adina’s memories in The Beginning of the End and creating a countdown urgency in Part Two where the reader is made aware of the increasing high stakes for the characters as more dark secrets are revealed. It’s a quest, a fight for survival and a study of the damaging nature of repression.\n\nWilliamson’s world building is intricate and believable as the action moves from a carefully constructed Eco Bubble community to desolate wastelands populated with horrific sights. She includes an artist’s impression and diagrammatic map of Eden 5 at the start to focus the reader.\n\nThe actual geography of Eden 5 later emerges as the story explores the thorny topic of “science manipulating genes in crops and animals”, the destructive nature of corporate greed and the divisiveness of brain washing. This topical and hotly debated issue is projected in a nightmarish futuristic speculative scenario. The novel also encompasses the universal themes of abuse, bullying, cruelty, friendship, growing pains, jealousy, magnetic attraction, denial, guilt, recklessness, moral lessons and self sacrifice. It has searing, cinematic imagery that startles and evokes emotional reactions. There are moments of shock and surprise.\n\nWhile it is carefully crafted, where the novel falters is Williamson’s reliance on the “if I knew then what was going to happen”, “if only I’d listened” trope which has the effect of distracting and irritating the reader because it removes suspense, which is a key element of dystopian fiction, from her storyline. Otienno could also have more depth as a character rather than just being atavistic eye candy. He is simply a physical being who acts on impulse.\n\nThis book will attract fans of dystopian despair, zombie style horror and speculative eco fiction as it paints an appalling portrait of the devastation caused by monopolistic corporations who prioritise profit over people and manipulate nature for their own ends. The scary fact is that it’s not so far from reality as you might think. It also has Orwellian shades of thought control in the beliefs of the inhabitants of Eden 5, perpetuated by Director Eshe and typified by Adina’s attitude when her closest friend Dejen tries to open her eyes to the truth.\n\nGOOD NIGHT TO READ REVIEW RATING- 3.5 CHOCOLATE LIBRARIES\n\nFIVE FACTS ABOUT VICTORIA WILLIAMSON\n\nVictoria worked as a Reading Tutor with the Book Bus charity in Zambia\n\nShe is a patron of Reading with Char Char Literacy to promote early years phonics teaching in Malawi\n\nShe worked as a teacher trainer with VSO in Africa\n\nShe is passionate about creating inclusive worlds in her literature “where all children can see themselves reflected”\n\nVictoria grew up in Kirkintilloch, North Glasgow, and is widely travelled\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nTitle: Feast of Ashes\n\nAuthor: Victoria Williamson\n\nCover Design: Anna Morrison\n\nPublisher: Neem Tree Press\n\nPublication date: October 2023\n\nLength: 323 pp\n\nGenre: Dystopia\n\nThemes: Corporate Greed, Environmental Sustainability, Genetic Mutation, Fragility of Ecosystems\n\nAge group: YA\n\nVictoria will be speaking about her Dystopian YA debut at YALC in November.\n\nBEYOND THE BOOK\n\nEagle eyes will also detect the clever use of anagrams in Feast of Ashes.\n\nThe thorny debate regarding the genetic manipulation of crops referred to as “Frankenfoods” rages on.

A fragile peace. A dangerous mission.\n\nScotland, 158 AD, is a divided country.\n\nOn one side of the Antonine Wall, thirteen-year-old Felix is trying to become a good Roman soldier like his father. On the other, twelve-year old Jinny is vowing revenge on the ‘metal men’ who have invaded her Damnonii tribe’s homeland. At the Damnonii’s sacred circle of standing stones, events spiral out of control.\n\nCan Jinny and Felix reconcile their differences before it’s too late?\n\nBOOK TASTERS\n\nHer next words were lost in a long, piercing shriek.”\n\nI missed him so much sometimes it hurt to breathe”\n\nI backed away slowly, holding my breath so hard my lungs burned.”\n\nLow and soft on the wind it came, a tune of war and loss and sadness that sent shivers down my spine with its haunting notes.”\n\nExtracts from Whistlers in the Dark\n\nBOOK BLOGGERS- SPOTLIGHT\n\nGOOD NIGHT TO READ MINI REVIEW\n\nVictoria delivers an atmospheric novel inspired by her love of Scottish myths and archaeological research around the area of Dunbartonshire in Scotland where she grew up. Set in the dual locations of a tribal village and a Roman fort on the defensive Antonine Wall [built in 142 CE] it is a departure from her usual socially realistic novels.\n\nThe story explores a myriad of themes including bullying, friendship, growing pains, cultural crafts, traditions and beliefs, the power of myths, tribal responsibilities and gender roles, loyalty, the price of vengeance, jealousy, the cost of reckless behaviour and moral lessons.\n\nWhere its strength lies is in its character portrayal. Williamson deftly handles a dual perspective voicing the reactions of Jinny [Scottish dialect] and Felix to traumatic events. Her characters are believable and multi faceted.\n\nThe narrative juxtaposes the awkwardness and difficulties of adolescence with the internal battles of the protagonists. Jinny must reflect on her tempestuous nature causing chaos while Felix evaluates his identity as a mixed race child of a conquering empire. Another key character must adapt to a catastrophic change in circumstance.\n\nThere are a few historical anachronisms in the use of language and literary references. Strangely, Whistlers in the Dark is set in the Iron Age in Roman Britain but Felix recalls to Bram the oral Norwegian folk tale Billy Goats Gruff which was first recorded by scholars Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Engebretsen Moe in 1841 [19th Century]. *\n\nThe plot is also infused with an eerie supernatural vibe which it takes a while to acclimatise to because it distracts from the dynamic drama of the opposing sides. Jinny’s obsession with the legend of the Standing Stones brings it into psychological territory. It evokes the spooky folklore of Samhain moving the story from historical fiction to magical realism. Could it be all in the mind? Perhaps it deliberately leaves it to the reader’s imagination.\n\nThis book will appeal to young people wishing to know more about the history of Scotland during the Roman occupation. It shines a spotlight on the Antonine Wall, which isn’t as well known as Hadrian’s Wall. Interesting details include a description of the perilous Lilia Pits installed as a defensive measure by Roman garrisons. Fans of Asterix will recognise the stand off between Romans and native tribes.\n\nHigh stakes, perilous situations and conflicted loyalties ratchet up the tension. The writing is on the whole deliciously descriptive and skilful. It will attract readers who appreciate compelling characters and enjoy excitement and adventure.\n\nGOOD NIGHT TO READ REVIEW RATING- 3.5 CHOCOLATE LIBRARIES\n\nFIVE FACTS ABOUT VICTORIA WILLIAMSON\n\nVictoria volunteered on digs with Archaeology Scotland.\n\nShe writes for Educational company TWINKL.\n\nVictoria volunteered with The Book Bus charity in Zambia\n\nShe visits festivals, schools and library events to talk to children and educators about the important issues she raises in her books.\n\nVictoria grew up in Kirkintilloch, North Glasgow, the region where this book is set.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nTitle: Whistlers in the Dark\n\nAuthor: Victoria Williamson\n\nPublisher: Scotland Street Press\n\nPublication date: September 21st 2023\n\nLength: 200 pp\n\nGenre: Historical Fantasy- Iron Age\n\nAge group: Middle Grade\n\nBEYOND THE BOOK\n\nARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH\n\nHISTORY OF SCOTLAND\n\nhttps://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainStrathclyde.htm\n\n[See section on Strathclyde & Damnonii tribe.]\n\nhttps://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/antonine-wall-rough-castle/history/\n\n[See section on Defensive Measures.]\n\nFOLK LORE\n\nhttps://www.scotsman.com/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/strange-tales-from-6-sacred-stone-sites-of-scotland-859489\n\nhttps://www.wildernessscotland.com/blog/scotlands-stonehenge-standing-stones-callanish/\n\nBilly Goats Gruff\n\nhttps://apps.lib.umich.edu/online-exhibits/exhibits/show/animaltales/goats#:~:text=The%20tale%20of%20The%20Three,Asbj%C3%B8rnsen%20and%20J%C3%B8rgen%20Engebretsen%20Moe.%5D\n\nDISCOVER MORE\n\nVictoria’s previous novels include The Fox Girl and the White Gazelle, The Boy with the Butterfly Mind, Hag Storm, and War of the Wind.\n\nShe has demonstrated versatility and addressed important issues with her writing.

Her language is gloriously atmospheric and dramatic. Silvery mists swirl around the reader wrapping them up in sinister secrets and perilous quests. They follow the inquisitive, lively and mischievous Nancy into a mesmerising world of illusion with charismatic characters as she delves into the terrible truths of her past.\n\nWith visual clues in the Chapter Headings, and evocative personification of the Sky, this book surprises. It is a psychological study of the theatricality of fear and the symbolism of associated colours. Kecojevic highlights the importance of confronting your worst fears and exploring new horizons. She balances the light of the nurturing environment where Nancy grows up with the dark of dread.\n\nUnder Scare Ground’s pageantry there are significant messages about self esteem, celebrating difference and special talents, being courageous and valuing the bonds of friendship. It touches on the damaging effects of bullying and loneliness. Readers are also made aware of how it’s important not to let the darkness in.\n\nAn entertaining Middle Grade debut with a flavour of Victorian life, lots of discussion points and an ending that begs for a sequel. Kecojevik’s construction of the forbidden fair where malevolent forces reign is creative and imaginative. Scare Ground is the perfect Autumnal treat as the cold nights draw in and Walpurgisnacht beckons.\n\nCatch a Deadly Waltzer or climb into a Raven carriage if you dare.\n\nGOOD NIGHT TO READ REVIEW RATING- 4 CHOCOLATE LIBRARIES\n\nQUOTE SPOT\n\nMy passion for books took me in the direction of school libraries.

It is a gift which was evident in ‘The Fox Girl and the White Gazelle’ where two girls from very different backgrounds bonded over a shared secret and started to heal each other. It’s writing like this that teaches young people to be kind, compassionate and empathetic, to learn from their mistakes and to listen to each other.\n\nA quote often attributed to Narnia author C.S Lewis, is that “we read to know that we are not alone” and Victoria’s dual viewpoints in Norah’s Ark let children facing the poverty trap, the climate crisis and other issues know that they are not alone. Norah and Adam’s passion for caring for living creatures leads them to a greater understanding of each other, moving away from the misconceptions of their first meeting and healing themselves in the process.\n\nThis is a special book not to be missed. It will appeal to young people who are concerned about the planet, animal welfare and the cost of living crisis. It is a book to be recommended and shared.\n\nIt is also an adventure story where there are heart in the mouth moments of peril and one in which the characters, including the adults, learn of the danger of secrets and lies and that no matter how hard the struggle, help is available from those who care.\n\nGOOD NIGHT TO READ REVIEW RATING- 4 CHOCOLATE LIBRARIES\n\nFIVE FACTS ABOUT VICTORIA WILLIAMSON\n\nVictoria specialises in writing inclusive novels that reflect real situations being faced in the current climate\n\nShe is a primary school teacher from Scotland who has worked in Cameroon, Malawi and China.\n\nVictoria volunteered with The Book Bus charity in Zambia\n\nShe visits festivals, schools and library events to talk to children and educators about the important issues she raises in her books.\n\nVictoria grew up in Kirkintilloch, North Glasgow\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nTitle: Norah’s Ark\n\nAuthor: Victoria Williamson\n\nPublisher: Neem Tree Press\n\nPublication date: August 29th 2023\n\nLength: 304 pp\n\nGenre: Contemporary Reality/Talking Points/Eco Fiction\n\nAge group: Middle Grade\n\nDISCOVER MORE\n\nBEYOND THE BOOK\n\nVictoria’s previous novels include The Fox Girl and the White Gazelle, The Boy with the Butterfly Mind, Hag Storm, and War of the Wind.
