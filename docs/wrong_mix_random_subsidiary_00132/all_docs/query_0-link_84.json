Hudson advanced towards \"A\" Company and had just reached a fence near the road which ran into the main Zonnebeke-Becelaere road, when the former fell shot through the heart by a sniper's bullet; Capt. Hudson was also shot through the wrist. With the help of Lance-Corporal Jones, the Adjutant carried their gallant Commander to a shell-hole, for the enemy's rifle-fire was still heavy.

Nash, of the A.S.C., to conceal himself at Sandhurst on August 10th.\n\nPte. William Kelly, 5th Lancers, said he lived three doors away from defendant's house. For some weeks he had seen a man named Albert Edgar Nash, who was in the A.S.C., continually in and out of the defendant's house. On the evening of August 10th he saw Nash being taken away from the house by the Sergeant.\n\nWilliam Cox, a servant at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, said that on the evening of August 10th he observed a man he knew was not her husbandstanding outside the defendant's door. He had no coat or waistcoat on.\n\nDEFENDANT'S DENIALS\n\nP.S. Salter, stationed at Sandhurst, said that Nash was gazetted on July 20th as a deserter from the A.S.C. since July 4th. On August 7th he called at the house and of the defendant and told her that he believed she had a soldier there by the name of Nash. She replied, \"No I have not. He went back last night about 8.45, and has gone back to his regiment.\" He asked her if he had been there for some time, and the defendant replied, \"About a couple of weeks,\" adding, \"I knew he was an absentee, and I have been persuading him to go back.\" He told Mrs. Bedbrook, that if Nash came to her house again she was to acquaint the police immediately. On August 10th, about 6 p.m., he again visited the defendant's house. At the door he spoke to a little girl, who ran to the bottom of the stairs and called for Mrs. Bedbrook, who said that Nash was not on the premises. Witness said he did not believe a word she said, adding, \"I'm going to search your house.\" Mrs. Bedbrook asked if he had a search warrant. He replied in the negative and walked into the house. Mrs. Bedbrook proceeded to the bottom of the stairs. He followed her, whereupon she called \"Mr. Nash, I want you.\" Nash then came out of the back bedroom in his shirt-sleeves, and he told him to come downstairs, which he did. He then asked Nash, in the presence of Mrs. Bedbrook, where he had been since the previous Friday, and he replied, \"All over the place.\" Mrs. Bedbrook then said she did not tell him that Nash was in the house, and said that he had only came there that day at 12.30. Witness then arrested Nash.\n\nPC. Collier corrobrated.\n\n\"KINDLY CONSIDERATION\"\n\nMrs. Bedbrook told the magistrates that Nash had lodged at her house for almost a year. He was a baker in the A.S.C., sometimes working in the day and sometimes at night. He came to her house whenever he desired and came as a lodger. As far as she knew he went backwards and forwards to Aldershot; he never stayed a whle 24 hours in the house. She did not know he was a deserter, and it was not until the Thursday that she was aware that he was an absentee, and she told him to go back. She did not see him anymore until the Tuesday, when she told him that the police had been for him, that she would not allow him to sleep there, and informed him that he would have to go back to Aldershot, which he promised to do. \"I denied his presence in order to give the boy a fair chance to get back on his own when the police came.\" added Mrs. Bedbrooke.\n\nThe Chairman (Mr. G. A . Watson) said the defendant had been guilty of a very serious offence. She ought to have immediately informed the police that Nash was at her home, with the result that she would not have been charged that day. She had no doubt shown him kindly consideration. A fine of £1 would be imposed.\"\n\nCharles' wife Mabel was again arrested this time in August 1918 charged with Bigamy.\n\nThe Reading Mercury reported on the 17th of August 1918;\n\n\"A CHARGE OF BIGAMY\n\nMabel A. Bedbrook was charged with going through a form of marriage on July 29th 1916, at Farnham, Surrey, with Private Alfred E. Nash, of A.S.C. , attached Royal Berks Regiment, stationed at Dublin, her lawful husband being then alive. Nash was charged with aiding and abetting.\n\nSergeant Bedbrook , Berks Territorials, serving at Yeomanry House, Reading, said that on February 25th, 1907, he married Mabel Annie Trowbridge (the female defendant) at Sandhurst Church. He lived with her until the outbreak of war at Yorktown, and then, on his enlistment, his wife moved to Sandhurst. Witness became acquainted with Nash when he found him in his home in 1915, when he (witness) was home on leave. Nash knew that he and Mabel Bedbrook were man and wife. At Easter, 1916, witness ordered Nash out of his house on account of something that was told him.\n\nPrivate George Harrison deposed to being present at the Registry Office at Farnham, when the defendants went through the usual form of marriage.\n\nP.S. Salter, stated that when the female defendant was arrested she said that she was in trouble, and that Nash married her in order that she might get the separation allowance. She drew it for a time for herself , and afterwards for her newly born baby as well. Nash has since paid it all back.\n\nSupt. Goddard said that the separation allowance from her first husband had previously been stopped. P.S. Salter, continuing his evidence said the female defendant had been convicted of harbouring Nash when an absentee.\n\nThe female defendant said that her life with her husband had been very unhappy as he seldom came home to her after work, but stayed at his mother's house. When her husband heard she had given birth to a child on March 8th, 1916, of which Nash was the father, he turned her out of the house. Afterwards when she was expecting another child by Nash they decided to go through a form of marriage so that she might get the separation allowance.\n\nThe male defendant said he did not know that Bedbrook was alive, where he was or anything about him. Both defendants were committed for trial, the woman being granted bail in two sureties of £20, in order that she might look after her children.\"\n\nOn the 18th of Ocotber 1918, at Wokingham Magistrates Court, Wokingham, Berkshie, Mabel Bedbrook was found guilty of Bigamy and was sentenced to 4 months imprisonment with Hard Labour. Alfred Nash was convivted of aiding and abetting Mable and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment with Hard Labour.\n\nCharles was discharged fro m the Army, unknown date.\n\nLiving at 12 Park Street, Camberley, Surrey, in the 1939 Register.

Frederick's father William was working as Conservator of Forests at Indore, India.\n\nBaptised at Secunderabad, Madras, India, on the 14th of November 1894.\n\nVisitor at Wood End, Lymington, Hampshire, in the 1901 census.\n\nEducated at Cheltenham College, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, admitted in 1908.\n\nBoarder at Newick House, Upper Bath Road, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in the 1911 census. Frederick now aged 16, is a Student at Cheltenham College.\n\nEducated as a Gentleman Cadet at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Berkshire. Admitted in Summer 1913.\n\nCommissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant, 2nd Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment, on the 14th of August 1914. Reported in the London Gazette on the 14th of August 1914, Issue 28870, Page 6401.\n\nPosted to the B.E.F. in France, disembarking on the 9th of September 1914.\n\nBy October 1914 the 2nd Btn. Worcestershire Regiment was near to Ypres, where the British Army, had made a stand against the German invasion. The Battle of Ypres, hinged on the village of Gheluvelt, the last point in the British line, from which the enemy’s line could be dominated.\n\nBy midday on the 31st of October, the Queens, the Royal Scots Fusiliers, the Welsh, and the Kings Royal Rifles had been overwhelmed, while on the right the South Wales Borderers had pulled back. The village of Gheluvelt was in German hands, and a serious gap had been created in the British lines.\n\nAt 1.00 p.m. the 2nd Battalion Worcestershire Regiment received orders to attack and retake Gheluvelt. Led by a guide from the Grenadier Guards, the men began to move at 1.45 p.m., whilst all around, the wounded and stragglers were making their way back to the rear and Artillery batteries could be seen limbering up, having received orders to pull back in preparation, of a general retreat.\n\nThe Worcestershire Regiment was the only British unit moving forward, and had to cross the Polderhoek ridge that was under heavy German fire. Major E. B. Hankey, the Battalion C.O., decided to cross this dangerous area as one large charge. As the men came into German view on the ridge, all enemy fire was directed at them, with over 100 being killed or wounded. The rest of the men pushed on, with the speed of the advance increasing as the men charged down the slope on the other side of the ridge, towards the chateau at Gheluvert.\n\nThe Germans were not prepared to face the charge, for they made no great attempt to stand their ground and face the counter-attack. They gave way at once before the onslaught of the Worcestershire battalion and crowded back out of the grounds of the chateau into the hedgerows beyond. 'C' Company led by Captain E. L. Bowring, followed closely by 2nd Lieutenant F. C. F. Biscoe, charged across the lawn, and here they met members of the South Wales Borderer's, that had made a gallant stand. All day they had held their ground at the Chateau and they were still stubbornly fighting although almost surrounded by the enemy. Their resistance had delayed and diverted the German advance, and the success of the Worcestershire's counter-attack was largely due to the brave and heroic defense by the South Wales Borderers.\n\nThe meeting of the two battalions was unexpected. The Worcestershire's had not known that any of the South Wales Borderers were still holding out. Major Hankey went over to their commander and found him to be Colonel H. E. Burleigh Leach, an old friend. With him was their second-in-command Major A. J. Reddie, brother of Major J. M. Reddie of the Worcestershire. \"My God, fancy meeting you here,\" said Major Hankey, and Colonel Burleigh Leach replied quietly \"Thank God you have come.\"\n\nAlthough remnants of the Germans still held some positions around the village, the gap in the British lines had been plugged and the retreat of the British Army from Ypres and the Menin Road had been averted.\n\nAppointed as Temporary Lieutenant, November 1914.\n\nMentioned In Despatches, published in the London Gazette on the 17th of February 1915, page 1663.\n\nPromoted to Lieutenant, on the 15th of March 1915, published in the London Gazette 12th of May 1915, Issue 29160, page 4627.\n\nWounded In Action on the 17th of May 1915, during the Battle of Festubert.\n\nThe 2nd Battalion Worcestershire Regiment's machine gun section, led by Lieutenant F. C. F. Biscoe, were sent to aid the Inniskilling Fusiliers and the 2nd Oxford and Bucks L.I., in a captured German trench. The machine-gun detachment became involved in desperate fighting, and Lieutenant Biscoe was hit.\n\nDied of Wounds on the 19th of May 1915, aged 20, at Bethune Hospital, Bethune, France.\n\nBuried at Bethune Town Cemetery, Pas de Calais, France.\n\nGrave Reference: II.

In the meantime several attempts had been made to obtain information as to what the attacking line was doing. At 5.50 pm a message came from \"C\" Coy. QUEENS that WARWICKS line was half way to enemy's trenches; reinforcements of WELSH FUSILIERS were then sent for to carry on the attack. A report came in at 6.12 pm that one Coy. WARWICKS had got to enemy's trenches but had to retire. As neither the WELSH FUSILIERS or the 3 platoons from B Coy. had arrived at 6.38 all Coy Comdrs were warned to be prepared for a counter attack & it was not until 6.50 pm that the first reliable information of the whereabouts of the WARWICKS was obtained:- Sgt. SPILLER (Queens) had just returned from the 1st line of the WARWICKS & stated their casualties were very heavy that they had got close to the first lot of wire & that they were scattered in groups all over the place & that there was no line behind them. In the meantime It was ascertained that out 1 1/2 Coys were also close to the enemy's position & had suffered heavily. At this time one Coy of WELSH FUSILIERS had arrived & I decided that it would be madness to push the attack further & informed Hdqrs. At 7.52 pm I withdrew the remainder of attacking party, sent out parties to collect wounded. Owing to the arrival in the trenches of 2 more Coys. WELSH FUSILIERS as well as wounded & also Queens and Warwicks returning, the trenches were very congested & great difficulty was experienced in reorganising the firing line & evacuating wounded. This was accomplished by about 2 am. Search parties were out all night collecting wounded. The fire was terrific 4 machine guns to our front & one enfilading attack to a certain extent. The fire dropped a bit towards midnight & altogether about 5 am. 22 Officers and 958 men.\n\n19th (December)\n\nAt daybreak Germans were seen beckoning to our men to come out & collect wounded & bury dead. Several of our officers including the M.O. & 30 men went out. About 50 Germans & 10 German Officers also came out & there was a local armistice. A sniper on our right killed one officer of S. Staffords & one of our men but there was no firing from or front. The Germans buried a lot of our dead & we collected wounded, some of whom were taken into the German trenches & others into ours. As our dead & wounded were mostly near the German wire the enemy took possession of their rifles etc. Our officers conversed with the German officers & unfortunately two of our officers 2/Lt. Rought & 2/Lt. WALMISLEY were enticed into the German trenches & taken prisoners, so also were 7 stretcher bearers. These officers and men were not missed until after Armistice. The Armisitice was brought to a sudden close owing to one of our guns shelling the enemy's trenches.\n\nOur losses were:-\n\nQueens \"C\" Captain Fearon.

Kildare, has received official intimation of the death in action of his only son, Maurice, born in 1882 and holder of a commission in the Royal Field Artillery. Lieutenant Cane was brother of Mrs. Isaac Bell, and frequently hunted with the Kilkenny Hounds, of which pack of foxhounds his brother-in-law, Mr. Bell, is M.F.H. He went out to France in November, 1915, and excepting for two periods at home on sick leave--the latter one only a few weeks ago--he had been on active service ever since. He was killed a little more than a week after his return from Ireland. Educated at Eton, Lieutenant Cane distinguished himself in athletics and games, especially at football, for he was a member of the \"Field\" for two years, being keeper with the Hon. George Lyttelton in his second season. He was also a member of the Oppidan Wall eleven, and keeper of the Association football. After running second in both the junior quarter and mile he occupied a similar position in the corresponding school events, and after a short spell at Oxford he went to the School of Mines at Cambrone (sic), where, while qualifying as a mining engineer, he played in the Rugby fifteen. Later he went to British Columbia, and while there played a good deal of cricket, his best performance being 100 not out in an inter-provincial match. In Ireland he was an invaluable member of the County Kildare eleven, and played many good games for the Na Shuler, a touring team of the standard I Zingari. Lieutenant Cane leaves a widow and a young son to mourn him.\n\nAnother writer in the \"Irish Field\" from which the above is re-printed, refers to this gallant officer's death as follows:--\n\nMuch sympathy will be expressed with Colonel Claude Cane, the oldest member of the Kennel Club living in Ireland, when it is heard that he has lost his only son in the war. Reference is made elsewhere to the doings of Second-Lieutenant Cane on the running track, and the cricket and football fields: he was no mean performer in any branch of athletics, but if there was one performance of his which gave the young sportman's father more pleasing reflections than another it was the killing of a stag on Ardlair Forest at the age of thirteen. The boy was also a clever angler at that age , and it cannot be wondered at that he made a mark on the playing fields of Eton. That the open-air life led in British Columbia had sharpened rathen than dulled the sporting spirit that was part of his nature was proved by his enlistment in the Canadian Naval Volunteers when the war broke out, and he saw considerable service as an A.B., and afterwards as a Leading seaman. In June 1915, when the Pacific was clear of Germans, he took his discharge, returned to his pleasant home in Ireland, and got a commission in his father's old regiment, the Royal Field Artillery. The story of his subsequent career can be summarised in very few words: he worked hard as a soldier; was wounded so seriously that twice he was invalided home and it is only a few weeks since he returned to duty for the last time.\"\n\nBuried at New Irish Farm Cemetery, Belgium.\n\nGrave Reference: III. H. 5.\n\nAt the Armistice, New Irish Farm Cemetery contained only 73 burials. There are now 4,715 Commonwealth burials here.\n\nProbate Records show that Maurice was a shareholder in the Great Western Railway.

Miles had received a gunshot wound to the face and shoulder.\n\nThe Battle of Talana Hill, also known as the Battle of Glencoe, was the first major clash of the Second Boer War. A frontal attack by British infantry supported by artillery drove the Boers from a hilltop position, but the British suffered heavy casualties in the process, including their commanding general Sir William Penn Symons. It was on the slopes of Talana Hill that the British army troops officially wore khaki uniforms for the first time in battle.\n\nAdmitted into the civilian Swedish House Mission hospital at Dundee. Natal, South Africa. Miles' condition was described as \"borders on dangerous\".\n\nThe Swedish House Mansion Hospital was originally intended for the wounded of the Town Guard, and was under Dr. Galbraith; after the battle, however, it became so full with wounded soldiers and Boers that it was put under an Army doctor.\n\nBritish troops retreated to Ladysmith and the Boer forces occupied the town, renaming it Meyersdorp.\n\nCaptured as a Prisoner of War by the Boers, when they occupied the town of Dundee, Natal, South Africa, on the 22nd ofOctober 1899.\n\nPromoted to Lieutenant on the 1st of December 1899.\n\nEvacuated by Boer Ambulance Train to Pretoria, South Africa, embarking on the 31st of December 1899 and disembarking on the 1st of January 1900.\n\nAdmitted into Burke's Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa, on the 1st of January 1900. This hospital, was run entirely by Mr. Burke, an Englishman and a resident of Pretoria.

The River Lys was crossed at Erquinghem, thew troops accompanied by a crowd of refugees. At 8.30 a.m. \"C\" Company under Captain Carberry, reinforced Captain Bull, and by 9.30 a.m. the whole battalion was acting as advanced guard, with the Royal Dublin Fusiliers in support, the whole under command of the Officer Commanding Royal Irish Fusiliers.\n\nThe welcome given to the troops was extraordinary; the poorest inhabitants literally overwhelmed the soldiers with bread, fruit, flowers, chocolates, etc., and would take no denial. But street fighting began soon after entering the town, which made progress slow. However, about noon Lieutenant Penrose, with his platoon of \"C\" Company, rushed the Farm Phillipeaux at La Ruage. Captain Carberry, coming up in support was mortally wounded- a most gallant officer, and great loss to Regiment. He had been severely wounded in the South African campaign. When Captain Carberry fell, Captain Elkin took over command of \"C\" Company and continued the attack on the farm, which he set on fire. This farm was held by a few Saxons, who refused to surrender, and from after events was known in the Regiment as Sydney Street, so called after a desperate fight which took place in London about this time.\"\n\nBuried at Houplines Communal Cemetery Extension, France.\n\nGrave Reference: I.

Name given as Frank aged 2.\n\nLiving at Obelisk Street, Camberley, Surrey, in the 1891 census. Name given as Frank.\n\nFrancis moved to No.2 Gordon Place, Gravesend, Kent, where he was living on enlisting.\n\nFrancis enlisted at Aldershot, Hampshire in 1894 at the age of 14 via an application made by his elder brother Walter to his Commanding Officer whilst Walter was stationed in India.\n\nNorthumberland Regiment\n\nService No: 4169\n\nRank: Boy\n\nPosted to the 2nd Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers then stationed in Singapore, 1895.\n\nPosted to England, disembarking on the 7th of January 1897.\n\nPromoted to Private\n\nPosted to South Africa (2nd Boer War), 1899.\n\nMedal entitlement records show Francis joined the 1st Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers before mobilization.\n\nThe 1st Battalion sailed in the beginning of October 1899, and being early on the scene, was employed on garrison duty in Cape Colony till Lord Methuen commenced his advance from Orange River. Before that there had been little fighting on the borders of the colony, but in a reconnaissance from Orange River on 10th November 1899 the battalion lost Colonel Keith-Falconer killed and two other officers wounded.\n\nIn consequence of some of the brigades originally intended for Lord Methuen's command having been diverted to Natal for the relief of Ladysmith, a brigade, afterwards known as the 9th, was formed of troops which were available, the component parts being the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers, 2nd Northampton Regiment, 2nd Yorkshire Light Infantry, and part of the 1st Loyal North Lancashire.\n\nThe 9th Brigade formed the left of the infantry in the advance into action. Lord Methuen's orders were that they should advance on Table Mountain, and \"having secured it, swing round left, then advance east to west\"; but on account of one of the Guards battalions having taken a slightly different direction in the darkness from that originally intended, the first instructions, under which the 9th were to have \"the lion's share of the work\", were modified. The brigade moved into action with the Northumberland's on the left, the Northampton's on their right, the Yorkshire Light Infantry and two companies Munster Fusiliers being in rear. The two regiments in the front rank performed their task — a difficult one — in the most satisfactory way, dislodging the enemy from Table Mountain and other defensive positions in the best style. The casualties of the Fusiliers were 2 officers and 12 men killed, 4 officers and 36 men wounded.\n\nDuring the next three months the 9th Brigade had little fighting, as until Lord Roberts was ready to advance from Modder River to Bloemfontein Lord Methuen remained quiescent in his camp. When the advance commenced that general and the 9th Brigade moved up to Kimberley and Warrenton. Sir Archibald Hunter's division then came round from Natal to the Kimberley district, and Lord Methuen was able to move farther east.\n\nThe Battle of Poplar Grove was an incident on the 7th of March 1900.It followed on from the Relief of Kimberley as the British moved to take the Boer capital of Bloemfontein. The Boers were demoralised following the surrender of Piet Cronjé at the Battle of Paardeberg. General Sir John French's cavalry attacked the Boer force from the rear while mounted infantry and horse artillery attacked from the right flank. The Boers abandoned their positions in panic before the cavalry.\n\nFrench's plan was to make a wide sweep around the six thousand Boers' left flank, without making contact, and then attack them from the rear. The infantry and the artillery would then attack them from the right. French, the cavalry division, some mounted infantry units and the horse artillery with 42 guns, carried out their order. But the Boers \"did not behave like well-bred pheasants\". Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote of it: \"The plan of action was based, however, upon one supposition which proved to be fallacious. It was that after having prepared so elaborate a position the enemy would stop at least a little time to defend it.\"\n\nFrancis was Invalided back to England, unknown date. This is shown on his Boer War Medal entitlement record.\n\nAwarded the Queen's South Africa Medal with Clasps: Driefontein and Cape Colony.\n\nThe Driefontein Clasp was awarded to those with Army Headquarters, and Lieutenant General John French's column, which advanced from Poplar Grove in the Orange Free State.\n\nAfter recuperating in England Francis was posted to the 4th Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers, unknown date.\n\nAppointed Lance Corporal, unknown date.\n\nLiving at York Infantry Barracks, Fulford Road, York, Yorkshire, in the 1901 census.

Norman and S.S. Italian Prince at Southampton, Hampshire on the 13th of August 1914, and disembarking at Le Havre on the 14th at about 5 a.m. Francis served with \"Z\" Company.\n\nThe 1st Battalion had moved into position on the Mon-Conde Canal by the 23rd of August 1914, which is the day the British and German army had their first contact at about 11 a.m. The 1st battalion thereafter saw action in all the major engagements of 1914 - Marne, Aisne, La Bassee, Armentieres and Ypres. Francis brother John also served with the 1st Battalion. (See John Casey below)\n\nFrancis was reported to be Missing In Action, October 1914. This was reported in the Newcastle Journal on the 31st of October 1914.\n\nAppointed Acting Corporal on the 24th of October 1914.\n\nAppointed Acting Sergeant on the 21st of November 1914.\n\nAppointed Company Sergeant Major (Warrant Officer Class II) on the 21st of November 1914.\n\nKilled In Action on the 16th of June 1915, aged 33.\n\nFrancis was killed during First Battle of Bellewaarde, also known as The Battle of Hooge which took place on the 16th June 1915. The 1st Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers war diary recorded the following:\n\n\"Our artillery started the bombardment at 2:50 Hrs. and with two pauses, continued till 4:15 Hrs. the time laid down for the attack to commence.\n\nThe enemy soon replied at first with shrapnel, later with heavy shell. His fire was mostly directed at RAILWAY WOOD, and a certain proportion of gas shells were fired.\n\nOwing to the proximity of the enemy’s trenches and the necessity for low bursts to cut the barbed wire entanglements, our own artillery caused us a certain number of casualties before the attack commenced.\n\nAt 4.15 a.m. the attack was launched, the front line of the trenches was quickly taken also the alternative trenches behind. In front of the trenches a certain amount of resistance was offered, in others the enemy surrendered almost at once. The battalion suffered rather heavily, many prisoners were taken.\n\nThe battalion started for the 2nd line of the enemy’s trenches after a very short interval and letter Z, Co. which was in support came forward to the front line. Z, Co. suffered severely from the very heavy shell fire brought to bear on them by the German artillery, both light and heavy.\n\nLetter W – Y Co. bore to the left and started bombing down the enemy’s trenches. Here there was severe fighting. The tide of battle ebbed and flowed, finally the enemy received reinforcements of men and bombs and that combined with strongly placed machine guns, forced us to abandon the idea of a further advance in that particular direction for the time being. (viz to Y7 and Y8, vide map appendix).\n\nIn the meanwhile portions of Z and X Cos. With some of the Liverpool and Scottish advanced and made good a line just W (west) of BELLEWARDE FARM. Here being exposed to sniping from both flanks and machine gun fire from the left flank they halted near old and shallow FRENCH trench and dug themselves in. This trench was only very lightly held owing to the paucity of men.\n\nCasualties though not heavy were frequent. Captain Sloper and a party bombed down a communication trench and rushed the enemy’s third line of trenches. They remained here about an hour. The adjoining troops returned and a good many casualties occurred. So both flanks being in the air a retirement was made to the new trench dug behind BELLEWARDE FARM. Only thin metal entrenching tools were available to dig this trench and the ground was hard and there had not been time to finish digging the trench properly.\n\nDuring this time the enemy heavily “Crumped” RAILWAY WOOD and BELLEWARDE.\n\nThere was a lull as regards direct fire on the advanced trenches for two or three hours, but casualties from fire from the left flank were frequent and RAILWAY WOOD and its vicinity were continually “Crumped”.\n\nIn the meantime on the left positions Cos. W and Y had consolidated the positions a little N (north) of Y.ll.\n\nEarly in the afternoon the enemy marched E (east) of BELLEWARDE FARM in their trenches and opened a heavy rifle and machine gun fire on our advanced position from close range. Attempts were made to block the assault up a CT (communication Trench) towards Y.ll. With bombs, but all our bombers were killed.\n\nFinally the troops on our right having retired some time previously and so leaving us outflanked on both sides, the front line was withdrawn under heavy fire of rifles, machine guns and artillery, light and heavy, to the first line of GERMAN trenches captured in the morning, where the battalion was relieved after dark by the Royal Scots of 8th Infantry Brigade. A number of gas shells were fired during this retirement.\n\nAll four of the battalion’ s machine guns were knocked out quite early in the day.\"\n\nDiary of the Great War by Pte Albert Williams 9122 also recorded;\n\n\"1st Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers\n\n15/6/1915\n\n....then on the night of the 15/June we left camp for Hooge, and were told we had 3 lines of trenches to take out at all costs. What a strafing our Artillery gave them, for hours they were at it, then off went the old ninth Brigade, the Seventh Royals, the Tenth Lincolns, Twenty First Scots Fusiliers and the Liverpool Scottish, we were issued with a new thing for cutting barbed wire, fixes on bayonets. The trenches were all taken, but what a strafing and sights.\n\nWe lost Capt. Bagshaw and Capt. Roddan and Sgt. Ashmore - all killed in the charge.\n\nSgt Major Casey, Pte McCabe in trench, and the following during the morning, Major Yatman wounded in face, Capt. Herbert wounded in foot, Leut. D Smith wounded, Leut. J. Lawson wounded right arm. Captain Sloper got one of his machine guns across to the Germans trench, but they put it out of action and when they counter attacked he strafed them with his revolvers, when found he had six wounds in him.\n\nLeut. Scrotton led the bombers, and was wounded but carried on, got the Military Cross, and Le/Cpl. Joynsen got the D.C.M.\n\nSgt. Lloyd wounded by shell\n\nCpl Smith wounded by shell\n\nPte Denton killed by shell\n\nPte Fairbanks wounded, end of nose\n\nPte Reid wounded by shell\n\nPte Hendrick wounded by bullet\n\nLe/Cpl Hall wounded by shell\n\nLe/Cpl Marsden wounded by shell\n\nLe/Cpl Pilkington wounded by shell.\n\nCpl Thompson, Cpl Hackett, Pte Jordan, Pte Scott, Pte Lockhart (twice ) and Cpl Hammond all buried alive but got out.\n\nSgt Hood carried a Pte of the Liverpool Scottish back to support trench and a Hun, and whilst helping me to dig out Cpl Hammond he got hit in the leg. I thought I was in for a good time as I had three German helmets and a bottle of wine and was going to have a good drink when the dirty devils buried me. I was dug out and lost everything, even my speech, what a row that shell made, good job it dropped in the traverse and buried me, a few more inches further and there would have been no Pte Williams to bury.

Kildonan Castle on the 4th of November 1899.\n\nWounded In Action on the 10th of December 1899, during the Battle of Stormberg.\n\nThe Battle of Stormberg was was the first British defeat of Black Week, in which three successive British forces were defeated by Boer irregulars in the Second Boer War. Stormberg, Magersfontein and Colenso were the British defeats that made up “Black Week”, a term coined by Fleet Street.\n\nThe 3rd Division commanded by Major General William Forbes Gatacre heard of the loss of Stormberg on the 8th of December 1899 at Graaff Reinet. He was determined to make an immediate counterattack to recover the area. A force of 3,000 was to be taken by train to Molteno, the nearest railway station to Stormberg still in British hands, and march by night to attack a hill known as the Kissieberg, which dominated the Boers' position. The force consisted of the 2nd Battalion, the Northumberland Fusiliers (960 men), the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Irish Rifles, (840 men), the 74th and 77th batteries of the Royal Field Artillery and 250 mounted infantry detached from various infantry battalions.\n\nThere was no time for reconnaissance, and preparations were rushed. Early the next day, the British troops hastily boarded the trains, but then sat for hours under a hot sun while locomotives were found. They were already tired when they reached Molteno, to set off on a night march with fixed bayonets after a hasty meal and very little rest. Gatacre's locally engaged guides were soon lost, and the force wandered about the veldt all night.\n\nAs dawn broke, the British at last came in sight of the Kissieberg. A small Boer picket with one 75mm Krupp gun under Sergeant Hendrik Muller of the Free State Artillery Corps, opened fire. Although Gatacre's force had merely to march around the hill to force the Boers to retreat, about half the infantry rushed forward without orders to storm it. They found that the hill was a typical kopje, ringed by a vertical rock face and it seems clear that the infantry climbing the Kissieberg in several places found they could make no further progress up the mountain due to the sheer stone ridges. The commanding officer of 2nd Northumberland Fusiliers gave orders that his battalion should withdraw off the hillside. Five companies of the Fusiliers received this order and began to climb down, but three of the battalion’s companies, of which Captain Wilmott was the senior officer, remained with the Royal Irish Rifles further up the mountain.\n\nThe gun batteries seeing the Fusiliers coming down into the valley assumed that there was a general retreat and that it was necessary to bring their fire down from the mountain crest. The directing gunner officers were considerably hampered by the dawn sun breaking over the top of the mountain, shining into their eyes and throwing the mountain side into darkness. The British artillery rounds began to fall among the Royal Irish Rifles and Fusiliers still near the top of the mountain. Lieutenant Colonel Eager, the commanding officer of 2nd Royal Irish Rifles, discussed the situation with Captain Wilmott who urged that the troops were nearly at the crest and that the attack should continue. Eager assembled his senior officers near the top of the mountainside to confer over what action to take when a British shrapnel shell burst over this conference wounding all the officers, Lieutenant-Colonel Eager, Major H. J. Seton, the second-in-command, Major Welman and Captain Bell, with Eager later dying of his wounds.\n\nIt would seem that at some points on the mountain there was very little preventing the British infantry from reaching the top of the Kissieberg and taking the Boer positions. A Boer official reported later that Boers were already leaving their positions due to the threat of being overrun, but with the main body of the attack withdrawing, it was clear to Gatacre that they were in no fit state to renew the attack and that a return to Molteno was necessary. The British troops began to march in to Molteno at 11am and the whole force was back by 12.30pm. The inhabitants of Molteno turned out to assist the returning exhausted soldiers, providing them with water and food.\n\nRolls were called and it was then realised that many troops could not have received the order to withdraw and been left on the mountainside in the confusion of the descent or collapsed in exhaustion on the route back. Of the force of 2,600 men, 13 officers and 548 men were missing, some killed but the majority Boer prisoners.\n\nWalter was severely wounded but soon recovered and continued serving in South Africa.\n\nPromoted to Corporal on augmentation on the 1st of March 1900.\n\nAppointed Unpaid Lance Sergeant on the 9th of October 1901.\n\nAppointed Paid Lance Sergeant on the 1st of August 1902.\n\nPassed Classes of Instruction for Sergeant (Date unknown)\n\nPromoted to Sergeant on the 16th of September 1902.\n\nPosted to England, disembarking on the 11th of February 1903.\n\nThe 2nd Battalion were based at Milton Barracks, Gravesend, Kent.\n\nAwarded the Queen's South Africa Medal with Clasps; Cape Colony, Orange Free State and Transvaal.\n\nAwarded the King's South Africa Medal with Clasps: South Africa 1901 and 1902.\n\nWalter married Mary Clancy on the 17th of March 1903.

John McVeigh of Berwick was killed on Monday, 5th of July. I have been requested to inform you by the men of his company, and the senior of the Battalion. I am always on the look-out when we down from the trenches for facilities in which our people may benefit. We cannot get a priest when we are on trench duty, and consequently they look to me to read some prayers at poor M'Veigh burial, which I hope is not wrong. I do so because a Church of England man will have a committal prayer read by an officer when buried if circumstances permit, and it prevents Church of England men thinking we Roman Catholics are hard-hearted. Corpl. M'Veigh was shot through the head, and was being conveyed to the dressing station when he died. C.S.M. Heslop immediately informed me, and asked what should be done about his burial. So I had a proper soldier's graveyard located, a grave dug, and with a few from his company and a few Catholics present, I read prayers from my Prayer Book. I also secured a piece of well-seasoned pitch pine and made a nice plain cross, with the inscription;\n\nR.I.P.\n\nIn Memory of\n\nNo.1327, Corporal J. McVeigh\n\n7th Northd. Fusiliers\n\nKilled In action on 5th of July 1915\n\nIn addition we covered the mound neatly with fresh cut turf and put on some beautiful wreaths. I am informing you, Father, of these matters by request, to enable you to console his family. He is buried at St. Quentin, half a mile south of Dulverghem, and about three miles west of Neuve-Englise, Flanders. He was at communion, the last opportunity we had, and that was on 10th of June. His effects will be forwarded through the proper channels in due course. The details of how he was hit is a common thing out here. He was looking over his trench to ascertain that things were quiet and a sniper picked him off. He had recently been promoted Corporal: was a good, reliable and dutiful lad, and very keen to do his bit, and was one of most popular and best N.C.O's in his company. His loss was consequently much regretted by all. Personally I would like to express my own deep-felt sympathy to his family, so if you will favour me by conveying the same, I will be grateful. Hoping you are well , I beg to remain, your obedient servant,\n\nWalter Casey\n\n7th Northd.
