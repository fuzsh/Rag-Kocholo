        "text": "March 19, 2014\n\nThis book ended too soon, I wanted more! I wanted to know what happened to the children after they grew up. This was a book I didn't want to put down!\n\nMarch 28, 2016\n\nI can't believe that each story is better than the last but it is true. This one is an astonishing tale. Part of me says \"no way\" and yet, why not? It might be a huge stretch of the truth but the suspense factor makes it a compelling read and the ending is satisfying. That is a five star read for me.\n\nI listened to this book narrated by Carrington MacDuffie.\n\nApril 5, 2010\n\nThe four McNair children have spent most of their childhood moving around (father’s job). Ironically, just as they settle in rural Oregon, their father dies and soon after that, their mother does as well. Educated from the cradle to distrust the social services system, the children (eldest almost 16) decide to bury their mother and go it on their own. With the help of a young and sympathetic lawyer (who doesn’t know their secret) we follow them through the next eight years of their lives. Excellent in parts.\n\nAugust 15, 2023\n\nThis book is beyond amazing. Where has this author been all my life, and why have I never read any of her books before? I want to talk about all the thoughts I had while reading it, but that would mean spoilers, and I hate spoilers.\n\nIt was described to me as a \"kids on their own\" story, which is something practically everyone likes, so naturally I wanted to read it. But there is so much more to this book. The elaborate plans these kids carried out, the ideas they discussed, their talents and brilliance and resourcefulness are all fascinating.\n\nIt was amazing; not only a wonderful story, but thought-provoking and surprising in a way I didn't expect. A previous reader had left a note in this used copy: \"Not a happy book, but an absorbing one.\". I agree, but would add that it is also not a scary book or a depressing book, but one that leaves you with hope, as well as some questions to ponder.\n\nMay 10, 2017\n\nWith their parents dead and gone, their father killed on his job and their mother dead from what was believed to be a broken heart, the McNair children, Kevin, age 18, Amy age 17, Liz, age 14, and Brian, age 9, all underage when their mother died, raised themselves honoring the promise they made to their mother to never have a funeral or a repast after her death. When their mother died, the Children buried her in the backyard.\n\nKevin and Amy now old enough to go off to college and with thoughts of living away from the family’s home, realize their predicament. They hold a family meeting to decide just how to do that without being arrested for not contacting law enforcement about their mother’s death.\n\nThe four siblings overcame adversity with commonsense and sticking together. What was unfortunate was that they had no one to confide in. What helped them was their dad teaching them how to see the world from a philosophical viewpoint.\n\nThe Good Children was one of my favorite Kate Wilhelm books. The characters development was among the best I’ve read. The story was believable and creditable. The flow of the story was exceptional and there wasn’t a lull in any point of the book and though The Good Children was a work of fiction, somehow it felt like the work of personal experience.\n\nThe Good Children had the best ending I’ve ever read in a work of fiction and Carrington MacDuffie did an extraordinary job in interpreting the personalities and moods of the characters. The Good Children is a book that you will not want to put down!\n\nNovember 10, 2014\n\nThis book was so good. I enjoyed it so much ... I didn't expect to. I listened to it on audio and at first the voice sounded so creepy but I eventually got used to it. I enjoyed this book immensely. I didn't fall in love with it, which is why it's only a 4 star but I do recommend it to others.\n\nMarch 8, 2012\n\nThis is my first Kate Wilhelm and one of her older ones, but several heart pumping times in this story. Maybe a little far fetched but that's what a \"suspense novel\" is all about, right?\n\nNovember 25, 2023\n\nTook about 3 days to read (listen) this book, I didn’t log it in to Goodreads till I had already finished it - I really enjoyed this book - loved how the one sister loved her little brother and would stop at nothing to make sure he was ok even though he drove her crazy - i didn’t want the book to end.\n\nRead\n\nOctober 28, 2009\n\nreasonably well for a few years, but then the children are getting older. Kevin and Amy both have ambitious college plans. They would like to sell the house and settle the two younger children, Liz and Brian, somewhere so they can go on with their lives. But Liz and Brian remain in the house. Then some terrifying things take place bringing them closer to the truth about their mother’s death. But will the truth set them free, or bind them together forever? Very good book. Carrington MacDuffie is the consummate professional narrator and does this book proud.\n\nMarch 4, 2014\n\nI loved this book! I listened to the audio book while driving, and literally would sit int he car when I got home to finish the chapters. The book really hooked you in - was written in a style that was believable for the age of the writer, kept your interest. It was believable because the story centered around siblings taking care of each other, and the deep dark secrets that siblings can keep with each other. Great read.\n\nAugust 3, 2017\n\nComplete waste of time reading this book. At the outset, it is barely interesting enough to keep me reading, and then about the last third of the book, it feels like you're reading a different book ... total derail. Unfortunately, by that point, there is no point in tossing the book away. Plotlines are too far-fetched; actions taken are unbelievable; and most unforgiving, the psychiatric treatment as presented feels more like something from the 1800s rather than modern times. Serious regrets here about reading this. And oh yeah, I experienced no sense of suspense and tension.\n\nMay 21, 2019\n\nWhat a great read! A family that has moved place to place finally settles down and buys a house. Then an accident kills Dad. Mom is bereft. Then Mom is found face down under an apple tree when she was trying to pick the apples at the top. Four kids alone. Mom was raised in foster care and has filled their heads with stories. So they bury her in the back and commence to pretend that she is still there. How long can that continue? Can they ever truly bury her? Are they ever able to sell the property? And what about the youngest son - Brian insists Mother never left.\n\nJuly 24, 2019\n\nExcellent novel. The suspense is slowly built, through Liz's narrative. As the children all come to age, one after one, we get to see how one decision impacts every single aspect of their lives--some of them are way more impacted than others.\n\nThrough it all I really liked to witness bond straighten under pressure instead of weaken. Even if by the end some secrets remained just for part of them.\n\nLiz and Brian's closeness was beautiful to follow.\n\nJune 2, 2017\n\nThis is a very quick, easy read. It begins well - Wilhelm is very good at creating a setting that is subtly disorientating and ominous from the start. But about half-way through it felt as if she lost interest in her characters and story. It rather plodded on to a pretty conventional ending that I found unrealistic and dissatisfying.\n\nJuly 22, 2018\n\nThe book it’s self was good. The characters were incredibly enthralling. It was a little more slow moving then I would like, but that also added a lot of detail. Not yet sure if I would read another book from this author.\n\nNovember 1, 2019\n\nWow. Kate Wilhelm is a born storyteller.\n\nI am so not fond of ghost stories, which are usually dumb and dreadful, full of characters you'd just as soon see the ghosts devour.\n\nBut this is a story about real people with real problems ... and ghosts. Most excellent.\n\nNovember 13, 2020\n\nOne of her better novels. When a father dies and leaves his wife and kids well off, she makes them promise to not let them go into the system. So when she dies, they hide her body, and pretend she's still alive. But it seems to be tougher on one of the kids.\n\nFebruary 4, 2024\n\nDa habe ich das Buch doch glatt an einem Tag \"weggeatmet\".\n\nEine wirklich bewegende Geschichte über eine einzigartige Familie, die einen von der ersten Seite an in ihren Bann zieht. Für mein Gefühl gab es keine unnötigen Längen, was die Lektüre sehr angenehm machte.\n\nJuly 3, 2024\n\n🎧 Audio\n\n2.5/3 ⭐️\n\nI felt like this book has loose ends not tied up. I also felt like it was kind of all over the place is some chapters and then super boring in others. Just not my normal vibe but also not a horrible book.\n\nMay 4, 2017\n\nI give this book 3.5 stars. The story line was interesting, the characters were well drawn, and it kept me engaged.\n\nJune 16, 2017\n\nI listened to the audio production of this because I couldn't find it in print in the library. Thoroughly enjoyed it, totally gripping. Highly recommend it.\n\nMay 22, 2018\n\nI couldn’t put this down. Wilhelm’s prose is lucid and clear, and laden with just enough foreshadowing to let you know that disaster is around the bend.\n\nHighly enjoyable and quite recommended.\n\nDecember 26, 2018\n\nI kept thinking “this is not my kinda book”, but I kept reading. Really nice job of pacing. Ending works, but leaves a lot unresolved. Reader was very good (audio version).\n\nApril 5, 2019\n\nThis wasn't as suspenseful as I was expecting, but the style was refreshingly different.\n\nJuly 23, 2019\n\nI listened to the audio version of this book. Very good! Kept me interested the entire time!\n\nSeptember 13, 2019\n\nThe author had me reading early in the morning and late at night. I could not put this book down. I love Liz.\n\nDecember 12, 2019\n\ncould not finish, the narrator was awful."
