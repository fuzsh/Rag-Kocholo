        "text": "Kate Wilhelm died on 8 March 2018, aged 89. She was much valued not only for her substantial and varied output of fiction – including the Hugo-winning Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang (1976) – but also for encouraging and mentoring many younger writers through the Milford (with her late husband Damon Knight) and Clarion workshops. Further accolades include three Nebulas for shorter fiction, the SF Hall of Fame in 2003, and SFWA’s 2009 Solstice Award, a career honour which in 2016 was renamed the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award. Another sad farewell."
