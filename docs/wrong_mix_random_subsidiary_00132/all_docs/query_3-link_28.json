(AP)  Award-winning science fiction writer Kate Wilhelm has died at 89.\n\nHer son Richard Wilhelm said in a Facebook post that his mother died March 8 in Eugene, Oregon, following a brief illness.\n\nKate Wilhelm wrote more than 60 works in science fiction, fantasy and mystery, including the Hugo Award-winning novel “Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang.”\n\nRichard Wilhelm told The Register-Guard newspaper of Eugene that his mother started writing science fiction when the field was dominated by men. Rather than spaceships and gadgets, he says his mother was focused on characters, and why they were in particular situations.\n\nWilhelm was also known for writer workshops she established with her late husband Damon Knight.\n\nWilhelm and Knight are both members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame."
