She says Wilhelm was acclaimed for her science fiction work.\n\n“She won a Nebula Award which is quite prestigious. She also won a Hugo Award. These are all for science fiction or fantasy. In later years she wrote mystery novels set in Eugene. She had a character who was an attorney, Barbara Holloway. And those were also very popular.\"\n\nWilhelm wrote more than 60 works in science fiction, fantasy and mystery. When she started writing science fiction, the field was dominated by men.\n\nWilhelm was also known for writer workshops she established with her late husband Damon Knight.\n\nWilhelm and Knight are both members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame."
