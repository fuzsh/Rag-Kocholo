        "text": "Kenneth “Ken” Wilhelm, 62, formerly of Barnegat, passed away on Thursday, February 16th, 2017, surrounded by his loving family after a courageous fight against Parkinson’s.\n\nA dedicated father, son, and brother, Ken was predeceased by his parents Carl and Delores Wilhelm of Bradenton, FL, survived by son Daniel Wilhelm of Medford, NJ, daughter Kate Wilhelm of Warminster, PA, sister Brooke Brannigan and her husband Michael of Niskayuna, NY, and his extended family.\n\nBorn on January 5th, 1955 in Alexandria, VA, Ken was then raised in Pearl River, NY, graduating from Pearl River High School in 1973, where he was known to many as a gentle free spirit. He was an eclecticist, collector of all things collectible, and as a Francophile he had always pictured himself reading outside of a café in Paris. Ken had a passion for music and the arts that he carried with him always. He could also always be found outside whether it was exploring as a child, hiking the Appalachian Trail as a young man, or neighbors finding him involved in one of his many gardening projects. Ken developed a love for the game of soccer later in life where he was a past President of the Barnegat Soccer Club and beloved coach to many throughout the years. Ken retired as a postal carrier with the United States Postal Service in Lakewood, NJ after a dedicated 39 years and, in 2012, moved from Barnegat, NJ to Bradenton, FL where he could walk freely of shoes on the beaches of Florida.\n\nTo know Ken was to know his dry sense of humor and sarcasm. He could play like a child, give advice like a friend, and protect like a bodyguard. He will always be remembered as a devoted father and caring brother. The family wishes to thank the many individuals who cared for Ken during his long illness for their compassionate, loving, and supportive care. Also, to the extended family and friends who have supported the family we thank you.\n\nThose wishing may send a contribution in Ken’s memory to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research at: Donation Processing The Michael J. Fox Foundation P.O. Box 5014 Hagerstown, MD 21741-5014; or through the website www.michaeljfox.org using the donation link and making a tribute gift in Ken’s name. If doing so, please use the e-mail address TributeToKen@gmail.com as a recipient e-mail.\n\nPrivate services to be held at a later date."
