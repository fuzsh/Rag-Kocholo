Won’t you join us?\n\nSecret Satan, 2019 translation edition\n\n“We are both monarch and victim in a gothic simulation illuminated by sombre flashes of sardonic rhetoric.” Which is nice.\n\nThe Son of Lîlame\n\nThe latest Rixdorf Editions title is out, but you can’t buy it. Ever. But you can get it for free!\n\nDress-down Friday: Else Lasker-Schüler\n\nFive stages in the sartorial self-actualisation of writer Else Lasker-Schüler as she moves through Germany, Switzerland and Palestine.\n\nStrange Flowers guide to Berlin: part 4\n\nElse was shocked when management barred her entry one day, on the grounds that she didn’t consume enough. “Is a poet who consumes a lot even a poet?” she fumed. And so as the First World War approached, Café des Westens fell out of favour with the avant-garde.\n\nStrange Flowers guide to Berlin: part 3\n\nThe retro-revellers at Bohème Sauvage are responding to a particular idea of Weimar Berlin, a fragile, frantic golden age of sexual license and social mobility, lewd and doomed. The undying allure of the Weimar Berlin evoked by Isherwood’s books ensures that the reality of the city in that era can never be divorced from its fictional echoes."
