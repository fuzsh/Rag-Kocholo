The two lived together in Oregon until his death in 2002.\n\nKnight founded the Milford Writer’s Workshop in 1956, and Wilhelm helped him run it for many years. When Robin Scott Wilson founded the Clarion Workshop in 1968, he explicitly modeled it on Milford. Wilhelm and Knight were instrumental in Clarion’s creation, and were early and frequent instructors. Wilhelm’s writing guide/memoir Storyteller: Writing Lessons and More from 27 Years of the Clarion Writers’ Workshop (2005) won a Hugo Award.\n\nWilhelm was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2003; in 2009 she won a Solstice Award for her impact on speculative fiction. In 2016, the Solstice Award was renamed the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award in her honor.\n\nHer son Richard Wilhelm posted the following on Facebook:\n\nWe are saddened to announce the passing of Kate Wilhelm, on March 8, 2018, in Eugene, Oregon, following a brief illness. Her warmth, humor, and immense talent will be deeply missed. Her life as a loving mother, prolific author, friend, and generous mentor will be cherished by many. We’re proud to continue her legacy, publishing her backlist and recent work through infinityboxpress.com."
