        "text": "American science fiction writer, editor and critic (1922–2002)\n\nDamon Francis Knight (September 19, 1922 – April 15, 2002) was an American science fiction author, editor, and critic. He is the author of \"To Serve Man\", a 1950 short story adapted for The Twilight Zone.[2] He was married to fellow writer Kate Wilhelm.\n\nKnight was born in Baker City, Oregon, in 1922, and grew up in Hood River, Oregon. He entered science-fiction fandom at the age of eleven and published two issues of a fanzine titled Snide.[3]\n\nKnight's first professional sale was a cartoon drawing to a science-fiction magazine, Amazing Stories.[4] His first story, \"The Itching Hour\", appeared in the Summer 1940 number of Futuria Fantasia, edited and published by Ray Bradbury.[1] \"Resilience\" followed in the February 1941 number of Stirring Science Stories, edited by Donald A. Wollheim.[1] An editorial error made the latter story's ending incomprehensible;[5] it was reprinted in a 1978 magazine in four pages with a two-page introduction by Knight.[1]\n\nAt the time of his first story sale he was living in New York and was a member of the Futurians.[6] One of his short stories describes paranormal disruption of a science fiction fan group and contains cameo appearances of various Futurians and others under thinly-disguised names; for instance, non-Futurian SF writer H. Beam Piper is identified as \"H. Dreyne Fifer\".\n\nKnight's forte was the short story; he is widely acknowledged as having been a master of the genre.[7] To the general public he is best known as the author of \"To Serve Man\", a 1950 short story adapted for The Twilight Zone.[2] It won a 50-year Retro-Hugo in 2001 as the best short story of 1950.[8] Knight was also a science fiction critic, a career which began when he wrote in 1945 that A. E. van Vogt \"is not a giant as often maintained. He's only a pygmy who has learned to operate an overgrown typewriter.\"[3] He ceased reviewing when Fantasy & Science Fiction refused to publish his review of Judith Merril's novel The Tomorrow People.[9][10] These reviews were later collected in In Search of Wonder.[6]\n\nAlgis Budrys wrote that Knight and \"William Atheling Jr.\" (James Blish) had \"transformed the reviewer's trade in the field\",[11] in Knight's case \"without the guidance of his own prior example\".[9] The term \"idiot plot\", a story that only functions because almost everyone in it is an idiot, became well known through Knight's frequent use of it in his reviews, though he believed the term was probably invented by Blish.[12] Knight's only non-Retro-Hugo Award was for \"Best Reviewer\" in 1956.[8]\n\nKnight was the founder of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA),[13] cofounder of the National Fantasy Fan Federation,[14] cofounder of the Milford Writer's Workshop,[15] and cofounder of the Clarion Writers Workshop.[16] The SFWA officers and past presidents named Knight its 13th Grand Master in 1994 (presented 1995). After his death, the associated award was renamed the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award in his honor.[8][6][17] The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2003.[18]\n\nUntil his death, Knight lived in Eugene, Oregon, with his second wife, author Kate Wilhelm.[19] His papers are held in the University of Oregon Special Collections and University Archive.[20]\n\nMain article: Damon Knight bibliography\n\nHell's Pavement (1955)\n\nA for Anything (1961) (original version titled The People Maker, 1959)\n\nMasters of Evolution (1959)\n\nThe Sun Saboteurs (1961)\n\nBeyond the Barrier (1964)\n\nMind Switch (1965)\n\nDouble Meaning (1965)\n\nThe Earth Quarter (1970)\n\nWorld without Children (1970)\n\nThe World and Thorinn (1980)\n\nThe Man in the Tree (1984)\n\nCV (1985)\n\nThe Observers (1988)\n\nA Reasonable World (1991)\n\nGod's Nose (1991)\n\nWhy Do Birds (1992)\n\nHumpty Dumpty: An Oval (1996)\n\n\"The Third Little Green Man\" (1948)\n\n\"PS's Feature Flash\" (1948)\n\n\"Not with a Bang\" (1949)\n\n\"The Star Beast\" (1949)\n\n\"To Serve Man\" (1950)\n\n\"Ask Me Anything\" (1951)\n\n\"Don't Live in the Past\" (1951)\n\n\"Cabin Boy\" (1951)\n\n\"Catch that Martian\" (1952)\n\n\"The Analogues\" (1952)\n\n\"Beachcomber\" (1952)\n\n\"Ticket to Anywhere\" (1952)\n\n\"Anachron\" (1953)\n\n\"Babel II\" (1953)\n\n\"Four in One\" (1953)\n\n\"Special Delivery\" (1953)\n\n\"Natural State\" (1954)\n\n\"Rule Golden\" (1954)\n\n\"The Country of the Kind\" (1955)\n\n\"Dulcie and Decorum\" (1955)\n\n\"You're Another\" (1955)\n\n\"This Way to the Regress\" (1956)\n\n\"Extempore\" (1956)\n\n\"The Last Word\" (1956)\n\n\"Stranger Station\" (1956)\n\n\"Dio\" (1957)\n\n\"The Dying Man\" (1957)\n\n\"An Eye for a What?\" (1957)\n\n\"The Enemy\" (1958)\n\n\"Be My Guest\" (1958)\n\n\"Eripmav\" (1958)\n\n\"Idiot Stick\" (1958)\n\n\"Thing of Beauty\" (1958)\n\n\"To Be Continued\" (1959)\n\n\"The Handler\" (1960)\n\n\"Time Enough\" (1960)\n\n\"Auto-Da-Fe\" (1961)\n\nA Century of Science Fiction (1962) (editor)\n\n\"The Visitor at the Zoo\" (1963)\n\n\"The Big Pat Boom\" (1963)\n\n\"An Ancient Madness\" (1964)\n\nGod's Nose (1964)\n\nMaid to Measure (1964)\n\n\"Shall the Dust Praise Thee?\" (1967)\n\n\"Masks'\" (1968)\n\n\"The Star Below\" (1968)\n\nI See You (1976)\n\nForever (1981)\n\nO (1983)\n\nPoint of View (1985) (illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg)\n\nStrangers on Paradise (1986)\n\nNot a Creature (1993)\n\nFortyday (1994)\n\nLife Edit (1996)\n\n\"Double Meaning\"\n\n\"In the Beginning\"\n\nIn Search of Wonder (1956) (collected reviews and critical pieces)\n\nCreating Short Fiction (1981) (advice on writing short stories)\n\nTurning Points (editor/contributor: critical anthology)\n\nOrbit (editor)\n\nThe Futurians (1977, memoir/history)\n\nFar Out (1961) (contains \"To Serve Man\")\n\nIn Deep (1963) (contains \"The Country of the Kind\")\n\nOff Center (1965) (contains \"Be My Guest\")\n\nTurning On (1966)\n\nAldiss, Brian W.; Harrison, Harry (1976).
