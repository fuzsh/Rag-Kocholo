        "text": "Kate Wilhelm is most widely known for her Hugo- and Locus-winning, Nebula-nominated, fix-up novel masterpiece Where Late The Sweet Birds Sang (1976). However, this linked series of novellas (her favorite form) was already the product of a long and fruitful career starting with somewhat standard pulp in the late 1950s. By the late 1960s and early 1970s her SF took on psychologically heavy and often devastatingly effective themes with great success: for example, in 1972 she was nominated for an astounding four Nebulas (winning none of them).\n\nMost of her critical success focused on shorter forms which might be the reason why other than Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang (1976) little of her work has remained firmly entrenched in the SF canon. Which is a crying shame as she is easily one of the most regularly brilliant writers I have encountered.\n\nThus I have rounded up my normal suspects from across the vintage SF blog sphere for my second guest post series! The first covered the work of Michael Bishop. As always, I have no idea whether they like her work or not but the purpose is to expose my readers to the range of her amazing visions. I will place links to their twitter accounts (if they have them) and websites. Please check out their other reviews as well!\n\nI will post the first review tomorrow. Depending on what I receive I’ll continue to post them periodically over the next month or so.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n~\n\nList of Guest Posts\n\nThe Infinity Box (1975) via Heloise over at Heloise Merlin’s Weblog\n\nThe Killer Thing (1967) via 2theD over at Potpourri of SF Literature\n\nMargaret and I (1971) via Max Cairnduff over at Pechorin’s Journal\n\nWhere Late the Sweet Birds Sang (1976) via Admiral Ironbombs over at Battered, Tattered, Yellowed, & Creased\n\nWelcome, Chaos (1983) via Megan over at From Couch to Moon\n\nYear of the Cloud (1970) via Mike White over at The Finch and the Pea\n\nList of my previously posted reviews\n\nCollection: The Mile-Long Spaceship (1963)\n\nCollection: The Downstairs Room and Other Speculative Fiction (1968)\n\nNovel: Margaret and I (1971)\n\nNovel: Juniper Time (1979)\n\n~~\n\nFor reference, here is a complete list of her Hugo + Nebula nominations and wins (Because there were numerous changes to the award process over the years I have no included her stories/novels that were considered below the cutoff or preliminary nominations).\n\nNebula Award (14 nominations and 3 wins)\n\nBest Novel nomination for The Clone (1965) with Theodore L.
