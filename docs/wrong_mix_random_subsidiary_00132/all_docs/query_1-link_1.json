        "text": "Women writers flourished during the Golden Age of science fiction. In “What Can a Heroine Do? Or Why Women Can’t Write” (1972), Joanna Russ, herself a writer of SF, argues that mainstream fiction before the 1970s limited female authors to stories about romance and marriage, or about tragic madwomen, while SF freed women writers because as a genre it is dedicated to “myths of human intelligence and human adaptability … exploring a new world conceptually … assessing the consequences of technological or other changes.” Indeed, women writers of the Golden Age explored utopian future worlds and technologies, imagined alternative modes of reproduction, and critiqued the value of weapons technology.\n\nEach scholar defines the Golden Age differently. I use the term to refer to the decades when short stories were the primary venue for SF, from the 1920s advent of the genre of “scientifiction” through a good part of the 1950s, when paperback novels began to outnumber short stories in the magazines. This time period is often termed the era of pulp fiction, since during the 1920s and 1930s most SF magazines were printed on paper made from wood pulp. I stretch the term “Golden Age” to include the “digest” magazines that became popular in the 1940s and 1950s and were half the size of the folio-size pulp magazines. I briefly discuss the conventions of SF and the portrayal of women in men’s Golden Age SF, but I focus here on women in women’s fiction, emphasizing the writers’ use of SF conventions, their devising of narrative strategies to resist the conventional masculine point of view, and their construction (and deconstruction) of gender.\n\nNone of the women of this period might be said to be canonical SF writers in the way that Isaac Asimov or Robert Heinlein were viewed. Some well-known women SF writers – Anne McCaffrey, Judith Merril, and Kate Wilhelm, for example – got their start in the magazines, but are best known for their later paperback novels and collections. While there were many women writers in the magazines, there was still widespread gender bias: a woman did not win the novella and short story Hugos (the Science Fiction Achievement Award voted on by fans and established in 1953) until Anne McCaffrey in 1968 and Ursula K. Le Guin in 1974, and no woman won the novella, novelette, or short story Nebula SF Awards (voted on by members of the Science Fiction Writers of America and established in 1965) until Anne McCaffrey in 1968, Vonda McIntyre in 1974, and Kate Wilhelm in 1969. Of the writers discussed later in this essay, who began their publishing in the SF magazines, the following have won major SF awards:\n\nLeigh Brackett won a Jules Verne Award, was a Guest of Honor at the World SF Convention, and was one of two credited writers for the film The Empire Strikes Back, which won a Hugo\n\nMarion Zimmer Bradley was given the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement\n\nClare Winger Harris’s first story was published because she won third place in a contest sponsored by Hugo Gernsback\n\nLilith Lorraine, who pioneered the genre of SF poetry, won an Arizona State Poetry Prize and the Old South Award from the Poetry Society of Texas\n\nKatherine MacLean won a Nebula Award, was a Guest of Honor for WisCon, was named Author Emeritus by the Science Fiction Writers of America, and has received a Cordwainer Smith Rediscovery Award\n\nAnne McCaffrey, the first woman to win a Hugo and the first to win a Nebula, also won a Gandalf Award, an American Library Association Award for teen novels, a Robert A. Heinlein Award for her work in SF, was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America, and was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame\n\nJudith Merril was named Author Emeritus by the Science Fiction Writers of America, was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame, and her autobiography posthumously won a Hugo\n\nC. L. Moore was awarded a Forry Award, a Count Dracula Society Award for Literature, a World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement, a Gandalf Lifetime Achievement Award, was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame, and received a Cordwainer Smith Rediscovery Award\n\nKate Wilhelm has won three Nebula Awards, two Hugo Awards, and a Locus Award, has been a Worldcon Guest of Honor, and has been inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.\n\nConclusion\n\nMen who write about women in the Golden Age often resist the stereotypes to imagine a future that includes progress toward equality between the sexes. Nevertheless, the basic template depends on a male scientist as point of view, an adventure story centered on science that usually excludes women, and coded elements that signal future but stand in for patriarchal American values (the rocket ship for exploration and virility, the alien Other, the robot for technological progress). SF by women in the Golden Age also depends on this basic template, but more often than not resists or reverses its constituents. Women writers mock the phallic rocket through hyperbole, sympathize with the alien Other, and reverse the gender of the robot to make it stand for art rather than science. These female writers resist the masculine narrative voice by converting or multiplying the narrator, and eventually by giving women the point of view. Rather than outright reversing gender roles, women writers reimagine the meanings of feminine qualities, making wives and mothers and grandmothers the ones who save their loved ones or even the world. And women writers co-opt the science our culture attributes to men, making women scientists who invent new ways of reproduction and who nurture instead of destroy life."
