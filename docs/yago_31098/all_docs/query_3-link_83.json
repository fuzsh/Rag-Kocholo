        "text": "On June 3, 2018, in a hospital in Macon, Georgia, we lost our husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, and friend to many.\n\nJoseph Michael Miller was born February 26, 1946, in Kansas City, Missouri, to Joe Jack and Alma Miller and lived all his life in Parkville, Missouri. On July 16, 1968, Joe married his high school/college sweetheart, Sue Brush, and to this union they had two sons, Cory (Kristyn) and Justin (Shae) who blessed them with grandchildren Addisyn, Finley, Ellee, Jax, Marlee Jo, and one grandson due to be born in August. Also surviving is his brother Jack and wife Marney. His brother Jim (Liz) predeceased him this past year. He is also survived by many nieces and nephews who were proud to call him “Uncle”.\n\nJoe graduated from Park Hill High School, Class of 1964. He obtained his Bachelor in Business Administration from Central Missouri State University (now UCM) where he was an active member of Tau Kappa Epsilon. Following graduation and marriage, Joe was drafted into the Army and did his basic training at Ft. Leonard Wood and was then sent to Viet Nam. Returning from his military obligation in December 1970, he and Sue bought Parkville Sod from his father and began what was to be a very successful lawn care and landscaping business well known throughout Platte County. They renamed it Millers Nursery and Lawn Care and as part of that business also opened Abigails, a floral and gift shop next to the nursery. In between all these endeavors, Joe, the landscaper and Tom, the lawyer, opened The Odd Couple (thus the name), a restaurant in Parkville.\n\nJoe was a lifelong member of Parkville VFW, a proud member of Kansas City International Rotary where he was named Rotarian of the Year in 1993-1994. He was also an active participant in all of his high school class reunions. In addition, he and Sue were well known for their famous Super Bowl parties held every year in their home, as well as numerous Fourth of July celebrations. Upon retirement, he and Sue bought a home in Ft. Myers, FL, where they spent their winters and it was on their way home from Florida when he became ill and was hospitalized.\n\nOne of the things Joe was most proud of beside his family were the many young men who worked for him through the years and learned the value of hard work. Joe led by example and worked beside them many times, encouraging them to do better. He was demanding, but fair; hard worker, but had time for fun; loved and was loved. Our lives are a little better for having known Joseph Michael Miller and somewhere God is smiling at the care Joe gave to this part of His world. In the book of Job it says to speak to the earth and it will teach you. Joe spoke and listened.\n\nA memorial service honoring Joe’s life will be held 10:00 a.m. Tuesday, June 19, 2018, at the Parkville Presbyterian Church. No formal visitation will be held. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to First Baptist Church, P, O. Box 1330, 409 W. Highway 60, Mountain View, Missouri 65548. Note on the check: Celebrate Recovery in Memory of Joe Miller. Memories of Joe and condolences to the family may be shared at meyersfuneralchapel.com"
