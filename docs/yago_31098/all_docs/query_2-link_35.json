Some evenings and weekends.\n\nAbout HoMA, the Honolulu Museum of Art: Opened in 1927, the Honolulu Museum of Art is a home for art and education created for the benefit of the entire community. Originally established as the Honolulu Academy of Arts, founder Anna Rice Cooke envisioned a museum that would bring people together through the power of art and “the deep intuitions that are common to all.” The museum was conceived of as a place of meaningful exchange and dialogue, celebrating the diverse artistic and cultural traditions of Hawai‘i’s multi-ethnic population. From this founding intention grew the museum of today, with a world-class encyclopedic collection of more than 55,000 works of art, representing a stunning breadth of places and eras, from all corners of the globe and from the ancient past to the present day. Over the decades, the museum has become known for its strong tradition of art classes and community engagement, both inside the walls of the museum and beyond. In 2011 the Honolulu Academy of Arts merged with the dynamic and vibrant Contemporary Museum, reinvigorating the museum’s contemporary holdings and ushering in an opportunity for renewed commitment to the art of our time. The Honolulu Museum of Art was born.\n\nWith a dynamic global art collection and a dedication to innovative exhibitions and engagement with contemporary artists, HoMA strives to create a broad range of meaningful art experiences that are inclusive and accessible. Over the past century, the museum’s permanent collection has grown from 500 works to more than 55,000 pieces spanning 5,000 years. The Museum has one of the largest single collections of Asian and Pan-Pacific art in the United States, including an unrivaled collection by artists of Hawaiʻi. The collection also contains significant holdings in European and American paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts; 19th- and 20th-century art; an extensive collection of works on paper, textiles, decorative arts; and traditional works from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. Other highlights include the Samuel H. Kress Collection of Italian Renaissance paintings and the James A. Michener Collection of Japanese ukiyo-e prints. Contemporary Art from around the world has an established and growing presence in the Museum’s permanent collection.\n\nEducation has been an integral part of HoMA since its founding, and the Learning & Engagement department supports the Museum vision by advancing knowledge and fostering a thirst for creative thought, agency, and artistic excellence. Programs, which range from classes and lectures to tours and workshops, are designed to inspire and spark wonder in people of all ages and skill levels. Through Learning & Engagement initiatives, HoMA strives to instill a love and appreciation for art in children at an early age, promote a culture of lifelong learning, and foster artistic excellence and support a healthy arts ecosystem in Hawaiʻi.\n\nAs HoMA approaches its centennial in 2027, it is poised to embark on a new chapter guided by a renewed vision and Strategic Plan that focuses on HoMA’s core purpose: to be a home for art and education that exists for the benefit of the entire community, presented in a setting that prioritizes beauty, harmony, and promotes learning, self-awareness and connection. With acknowledgment of HoMA’s history and purpose at the forefront, the Strategic Plan charts a course for HoMA’s next chapter in a rapidly changing world. It will transform HoMA into a relevant and sustainable 21st century museum where people of all ages and from all walks of life will be invited in and reinforce HoMA’s ability to bring the art of the world to Hawaiʻi and the art of Hawaiʻi to the world.\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\nBachelor's degree in accounting, a strong knowledge of General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and internal controls.\n\nProficient in Microsoft Office products, including Excel.\n\nThree years of relevant experience.\n\nMust have the ability to communicate effectively with a diverse group of people, possess strong attention to detail, and have strong analytical skills.\n\nAbility to handle data with confidentiality.\n\nAbility to meet deadlines, manage multiple phases of projects, and effectively communicate status updates and suggested solutions to any obstacles to meeting deadlines or project milestones.\n\nExperience with Blackbaud Financial Edge or other similar general ledger accounting system, or other relevant experience in public accounting.\n\n1 year of supervisory experience or experience reviewing accounting/audit work papers, entries, or reconciliations prepared by junior staff or public accounting clients.\n\n1 year of experience preparing financial statements and meeting structured reporting deadlines.\n\nExcellent writing skills and the ability to effectively create or update procedure manuals and internal control documents.\n\nAbility to research and document tax, regulatory or GAAP guidance.\n\nThe traits of honesty, integrity, enthusiasm, and perspective; a very strong work ethic, supported by commitment and follow-through.\n\nHighly intelligent self-starter who is committed to the Museum’s mission.\n\nDesired Qualifications:\n\nExperience with not-for-profit or retail accounting.\n\nMaster’s degree in accounting.\n\nUnderstanding of Honolulu Museum of Art’s established identity and dedication to advancing it.\n\nProven ability to lead and build the capabilities of a driven, bright, diverse team, as well as develop a top-notch work and volunteer force.\n\nInterest in assessing and utilizing technology for improved efficiencies and processes.\n\nCore Competencies:\n\nAdaptability\n\nBusiness Acumen\n\nChange Management\n\nEffective Communicator\n\nCost Consciousness\n\nInitiative and Judgment\n\nPlanning and Organizing\n\nProfessionalism\n\nProblem Solver\n\nTechnology savvy\n\nEssential Duties:\n\nPrepares various general ledger entries for transactions, accruals, and corrections.\n\nReconciles and analyzes various balance sheet accounts, including fixed assets, investments, and bank accounts.\n\nOversees the reconciliation of revenue accounts from various point of sale departments within the museum.\n\nAssists with tax worksheets on a monthly/quarterly/annual basis.\n\nPrepares and updates audit schedules.\n\nPrepares various reporting, including financial statement drafts and financial footnotes.\n\nPrepares monthly and quarterly Board financial reporting packages.
