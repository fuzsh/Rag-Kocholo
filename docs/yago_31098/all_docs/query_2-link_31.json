        "text": "HONOLULU, HAWAIâIâTwo years in the making, the Honolulu Museum of Art has published Collection Highlights, the first collections catalog to be printed since 1990. With the combining of the Honolulu Academy of Arts and The Contemporary Museum collections and new acquisitions in that time, Collection Highlights reveals a world-class collection that has grown in breadth over the last 26 years.\n\nIn 2014, the museumâs curators were mandated with selecting the best works from their areas of the collection. Photocopies were made of an image of each work and taped to the walls of the museumâs conference room. Over a series of meetings, the curators pared down their more than 200 picks to 133 works that represent the essence of the collection.\n\nFrom a 4,500-year-old marble sculpture from the Cyclades to Tony Ourslerâs 21st-century sculpture that includes video projection, the bookâs pages provide a global journey through time.\n\nThe book is dedicated to the late Sam Cooke, who served on the museumâs board of trustees for 46 years and also happened to be a great grandson of museum founder Anna Rice Cooke. And its publication was generously underwritten by Richard Cox, son of the museumâs first director, Catharine Cox, an art and drama teacher who helped Anna Rice Cooke catalog her collection, which would go on to become the core of the museumâs art holdings.\n\nCollection Highlights is available at the Honolulu Museum of Art Shop for $29.95.\n\nHoMA SELECT AT SPALDING HOUSE\n\nTo celebrate the publication of Collection Highlights, Spalding House director Aaron Padilla used the book as the basis for the next exhibition at Spalding House. HoMA SELECT comprises 22 of the Honolulu Museum of Artâs best worksâall included in the catalogâthat the museum has transported up the hill to Spalding House in Makiki Heights. Visitors will be able to see some of the museumâs most prized works in a whole new perspectiveâin a different space, in different light, and in a different context.\n\nâThe exhibition steers clear of traditional art historical paradigms as works are paired in unexpected ways, regardless of time period, genre, or geographical origin, provoking thought and discussion,â says Padilla.\n\nIncluded in HoMA SELECT are works by Francis Bacon, Paul Gauguin, Honâami KÅetsu, Henry Moore, Nam Jun Paik, Auguste Rodin, and Yamakawa ShÅ«hÅ. It puts the spotlight on the remarkable quality and breadth of a collection that began nearly 90 years ago with founder Anna Rice Cooke. The exhibition is generously supported by the Louis L. Borick Foundation."
