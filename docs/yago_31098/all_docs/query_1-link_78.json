        "text": "A 1905 Rice Family Christmas in Hawaii\n\nABOVE: THE HAWAIIAN HOME OF WILLIAM HYDE RICE (1846-1924)\n\nDescendants of Missionary William Harrison Rice\n\nCelebrated Traditional Family Christmas\n\nGrandma Rice first gathered the Hawaiian clan in 1905 at her Lihu'e, Kaua'i home called Hale Nani (beautiful home). This nostalgic Christmas Day tradition lasted into the 1930s.\n\nGrandma was Mary (Waterhouse) Rice, wife of William Hyde Rice. His parents, William Harrison Rice (1813-1862) and the former Mary Sophia Hyde, had come to Hawaii as missionaries in 1841, establishing a clan of Rices spread across the Hawaiian Islands and now (2008) in their sixth and seventh generations.\n\nThe Christmas Day festivities began at noon. About 40 family members in their holiday best arrived at the sprawling one-story house of sanded native woods. A porte-cochere welcomed guests to the big lanai covered by lauhala mats and rocking chairs. Fern baskets hung from rafters. Near the doorway was a large painted cloth mural with the word \"Aloha\" formed with blossoms from luxuriant tropical gardens.\n\nThe house included a large living room with 'oh'ia floors covered with Persian carpets and furnished in mahogany and oak. There was a spacious dining room, music room, two kitchens with their pantries, and six bedrooms.\n\nOne of the guest cottages was the Rices' first home as newlyweds. The favorite guest cottage was the authentic grass \"shack\" built by Hawaiian friends. Here the children and their friennds bedded down and retold Hawaiian legends.\n\nAlways included with the family were three bachelors. They were Judge Lyle Dickey, Judge Charles Dole and Edwin St. Clair de Lacey, who was head of the dry goods department of the Lihu'e store. He also played the organ in church on Sundays and the piano at the Tip Top movie theatre during the week. His \"hearts and flowers\" renditions accompanied the Perils of Pauline and the early silents of Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin.\n\nGrandmother Rice set three tables, one in the dining room, one in the big hall, and the children's table out on the lanai where hilarity decibels were unrestrained by shushing adults. Each table sported white damask cloths with crystal bowls of red carnations surrounded by swags of scented green vine and ferns that accentuated green-bordered porcelain plates.\n\nMrs. William Henry Rice's beautiful voice started the sung blessing. Everyone joined in. The first course was on the table. It was either succulent Hawaiian oranges or big red apples filled with fruit cocktail.\n\nNext came oyster soup. This was Grandmother Rice's triumph. Months before Christmas she ordered oysters from San Francisco. They were shipped in barrels of salt water filled with oatmeal, which the oysters devoured enroute to the islands. They arrived in Nawiliwili harbor fresh, fat and delicious.\n\nEach table had a big roast turkey with chestnut dressing, accompanied by mashed potatoes and creamed onions. Canned peas and canned asparagus salad were served as a treat; neither grew in the islands. Cranberries fresh from the coast provided big bowls of cranberry jelly and sauce.\n\nLiquor was never served then by missionary descendants, but an exception was made for plum puddings. What is plum pudding and hard sauce without a dollop of brandy? The flaming pudding was the long-awaited signal to the children that soon gifts would be distributed.\n\nAfter dinner, the family moved to the music room, where a big Norfolk pine glowed with real candles. Electricity did not come to Kaua'i until the '20s. The beautiful pine with its thick, symmetrical branches was resplendent with peacocks with spun glass tails, golden bugles, silver bells, handmade balls and hand-painted toys. The children's favorite was little baskets of blown glass strawberries.\n\nAfter gifts were exchanged the children ran out to play hide and seek in the gardens. Tiny tots went for naps and grownups caught up on family news.\n\nThe women wore long dresses elaborately tucked and embroidered and often accented with Irish or Cluny lace. Most sewed beautifully and their daughters reflected their skills.\n\nSisters Juliet (Rice) Wichman (1901-1987) and Edith (Rice) Plews (1900-1976) remembered one Christmas when they wore identical handkerchief linen dresses embroidered by their mother. Edith wore a wide pink taffeta sash and matching hair ribbons; Juliet's outfit was trimmed with blue.\n\nBefore long Hawaiian serenaders arrived. There were usually four or five men in the choral group. They sang old Hawaiian songs, never Christmas carols. The children were hushed and enchanted by the music's magic and flowing Hawaiian words. It was the perfect end to a joyous family Christmas.\n\nMore about this Rice family below.....\n\nFrom \"Our Man in Hawaii\"\n\nWilliam H. Rice: Missionary and Plantation Manager\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe following notes are from William Drury of Chelmsford, MA, , a descendant of Edmund-1 Rice of Sudbury, MA. He and his wife have spent the last half of October on Kauai for the past 15 years. Even though the Rices in Hawaii aren't from his branch of the Rice family, Bill couldn't help but notice the Rice presence there. After all, as Bill points out, \"The main drag in Lihue is Rice Street and the Kauai museum is the Rice Museum.\"\n\n~ By William Drury\n\nOn May 21, 1841, the Rices arrived in Honolulu on the ship Gloucester after a voyage of 188 days around Cape Horn. They had been accepted as candidates by the American Board of Commissions for Foreign Missions to be sent to the Oregon Territory. Upon landing at Honolulu they were informed of bad conditions in Oregon and persuaded to remain in Hawaii. Their first three years of mission work were spent at Hana, Maui, sharing an abode with Rev. & Mrs. Conde. While there, William Harrison Rice supervised the building of the Hana church. His bad health required a change of climate so the Rices were reassigned to the Mission School at Punahou, Honolulu. A native couple, Opunui and his wife Kaniho, accompanied them to Punahou and later Kauai.\n\nAlong with teaching at the Mission during the week, Sundays were spent teaching and preaching to the natives of Manoa and Kamoilili and working on additions to the Punahou school. He also took on raising vegetables as his duty. Mary Rice spent her week mending the Mission children's clothing and teaching the natives to sew and braid. After 13 years, Rice's failing health forced them to retire from the American Protestant Mission to the Sandwich Islands\n\nChief Justice Lee of Honolulu offered Rice work managing a sugar plantation, formerly H.A. Pierce & Co., at Lihue, Kauai. His salary was $400 a year, in stock if cash wasn't available. The Rices sailed into Nawiliwili in 1854. In addition to his plantation work he served as deacon of the Foreign Church. By working out an irrigation system now known as the Rice Ditch, the first in the Islands, the plantation was saved from drought. On his death in 1862, he left Lihue Plantation in prosperous condition and in the hands of his son-in-law Paul Isenberg.\n\n\"Mother\" Rice continued to live in Lihue with her children until her death in 1911. The increased value of the Lihue Plantation stock allowed her to continue her charitable works throughout her life.\n\nThe Rice Children\n\n~ Hannah Maria Rice was born at Hana. As the oldest child she often ran the household for her mother. She married Paul Heinrich Friedrich Carl Isenberg, a German who came to work for her father at Lihue Plantation. At her father's death in 1862, Paul took over as manager of the plantation, turning it into a very successful operation. Hannah succumbed to tuberculosis in 1867 at the age of 25 leaving behind two small children.\n\n~ Emily Dole Rice was born at Lahainaluna on Maui. She married Colonel George de la Vergne, a former Union Colonel. They were among the two or three families that first settled Colorado Springs, Colorado. She and her husband had two children.\n\n~ William Hyde Rice was born at Punahou, Honolulu, the only son. After his education was completed, he returned to Kauai and became a successful rancher, planter, politician, and scholar. He married Mary Waterhouse and had 7 children, none of whom remained on Kauai.\n\n~ Mary Sophia Rice, her mother's namesake, was born at Punahou. She died of tuberculosis at the age of 19 while traveling with her mother. She never married.\n\n~ Anne Charlotte Rice was the youngest daughter and born at Punahou. She married another missionary descendant, Charles Montague Cooke and resided in Honolulu. They had 8 children. She was a generous benefactor to the community.\n\nKoamalu\n\nThe Rice family moved to Kauai in 1854 when William Harrison Rice accepted the managership of what was to become Lihue plantation. This was the first house of their own since they had come to Hawaii. All other abodes had been shared. Their residence was often shared with visitors and travelers as there were no hotels on Kauai.\n\nKoamalu, the manager's home, had been built earlier from a pre-fabricated kit made in China and assembled at the Lihue site. Houses such as this were shipped from China, along with porcelain and other trade goods as ballast on returning sandalwood vessels. Koamalu was said to be made of teak and the walls were dark.\n\nHale Nani\n\nHale Nani was the home of William Hyde and Mary (Waterhouse) Rice at Lihue. The driveway of royal palms was situated on what is now Rice Street from Waa to Kalena Streets. Aside from the main house, there was a cottage for Willie's mother, blacksmith shop, a butcher shop, general office, a dairy, and a chapel that served as a schoolhouse during the week. The grounds were rich in California and native plants, roses, heliotropes, artichokes, pineapples, Chinese bananas, banyan, and alligator pears.\n\nBesides their large family, the Rices entertained friends and even strangers coming off the weekly inter-island boats. Taking care of and loaning horses and buggies finally prompted Rice into starting a livery business and, at the same time, encouraging C. W. Spitz to open the first hotel in Nawiliwili.\n\nThe Queen Visits\n\nIn 1891, Queen Liliuokalani made her first visit to Kauai. She, her many attendants and the Royal Hawaiian band were guests of the Rices at Hale Nani, which had guest cottages on its premises. After lavishly entertaining the entourage at Lihue, William Hyde Rice toured the Queen over the entire island in a wagonet he purchased from Princess Pauahi Bishop. The trip took a number of days and, with no bridges, the rivers had to be forded.\n\nEverywhere the Queen went, natives and foreigners laden with gifts expressed their loyalty to their sovereign. On the last night of her visit, the Queen and her retinue were treated to a lavish luau under the hau trees at Kalapaki. Soon after the Queen's return to Honolulu, William Hyde Rice was appointed Governor of the Island of Kauai.\n\nHale Nani's buildings were last used during WW II when the tennis court and main house were used for the W.A.R.D. (Women's Air Raid Defense) before being torn down.\n\nWilliam Hyde Rice\n\nWilliam Hyde Rice (1846-1924) was the only son of William Harrison and Mary Sophia (Hyde) Rice. He was educated at the boarding school of the Rev. Daniel Dole at Koloa, the Oahu College at Punahou, and Braton's College in Oakland, California.\n\nAfter returning from school, Rice managed the Lihue Plantation's ranch under brother-in-law Paul Isenberg. He began a long political career very early, serving as the youngest member of the House of Representatives under Kamehameha V in 1870-72. During this time, Rice married Mary Waterhouse.\n\nWilliam H. Rice served as a member of the House of Representatives during the reign of Kalakaua. He was one of the thirteen committee men who waited on King Kalakaua, giving him 24 hours to sign the new constitution.\n\nRice was appointed Governor of Kauai by Queen Liliuokalani upon her succession to the throne in 1892. He served in that office until the Revolution of 1893, after which he served as Governor of Kauai under the provisional government. Between 1895-98, Rice was a member of the Senate under the Republic. He was part of the constitutional convention which formulated the Constitution of the Republic of Hawaii. This document served as a pattern for the Organic Act. During his years of public service he maintained a residence in Honolulu.\n\nRice was widely known all over Hawaii as an acknowledged authority on the Hawaiian language with a rich store of legends and lore. In 1923, Bishop Museum published Rice's Hawaiian Legends which is still in print today. William Hyde Rice was a noted breeder of fine animals. In 1870, he exported the first Hereford cattle to California from Kauai. In the 1880s, he imported Clydesdale, Belgian, and Percheron draft horses to Hawaii. His fine mules were popular as work animals. Rice's horses were so well known that the Emperor of Japan sent his agent to acquire some animals. Rice gave as a gift, a stallion, to the Emperor Meiji. In return, Rice was presented with a pair of bronze vases inlaid with gold and the imperial crest. On the occasion of his visit to Japan in 1904, William Hyde Rice was the recipient of many special courtesies. During his lifetime, Rice generously supported missionary and church work. Rice was a member of the Lihue Hawaiian Church. He was active in the establishment of modern schools on Kauai.\n\nOn Kauai, the Rices made their home at Hale Nani in Lihue and raised a large family.\n\nKipukai\n\nPrincess Ruth sold her friend William Hyde Rice her lands at Kipu, Kipukai, and Haiku. He sold his Kipukai land to his mother, the Haiku land to his friend George Wilcox, and retained the Kipu lands.\n\nKipukai was a secluded valley nestled between two mountain ridges that ran from the summit of Haupu to the sea. A perilous paved stone trail was traveled on horseback followed by a pack mule train. Week-long house parties were spent at Kipukai.\n\nRanch beef, tiny wild tomatoes, coconuts and papayas rounded out the supplies that were packed in. The Hawaiian cowboys fished for themselves or the household when necessary.\n\nThe property was used as a cattle ranch with the house caretaken by a Japanese couple.\n\nAncestry and Descendants of William Harrison Rice\n\n(Rice section\n\nof cemetery\n\nin Lihu'e\n\nHawaii)\n\nLihu'e Cemetery)\n\nRICE ANCESTRY\n\n(Genealogical data on the ancestry and descendants of William Harrison Rice has been compiled by F. B. Wichman of Hanalei, Hawaii. The following is from his records, as provided by William Drury.)\n\nWilliam Harrison Rice married Mary Sophia Hyde in October of 1840 and six weeks later the couple sailed from Boston with the Ninth Company of American Missionaries. Her parents were Jabez B. Hyde and Jerusha Aiken.\n\nWilliam was the son of Joseph and Sarah Rice, who lived in Hannibal, Oswego Co., NY, but moved to Covington, KY sometime before 1845.\n\nJoseph Rice (1784-1871) married Sarah Burt. He was a son of Asa Rice (1754-1823), who moved from Connecticut to Oswego Co., NY, and changed the spelling of his name from Royce to Rice. His wife was the former Elizabeth Merriam (1763-1822).\n\nAsa Royce/Rice was the son of Asa Royce (1723-1785) who wed Anna Royce. The line then continues back through Isaac and Mary (Benedict) Royce to Samuel and Hannah (Churchill) Royce, ending with Robert Royce (ca. 1605-1676) and his wife Mary. Robert Royce, an early settler of New Haven, CT, is believed to be the immigrant. {See Rice Book 2 for more information on Robert-1 Royce and this branch of the Rice/Royce family.}\n\nWILLIAM H.
