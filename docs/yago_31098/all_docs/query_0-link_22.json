Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate and John Doe v. Kamehameha, in which he both ruled in favor of Kamehameha.\n\nWilliam Harrison Rice Cooke (namesake of his father-in-law William Harrison Rice) was born in 1878 but died young in 1880.\n\nGeorge Paul Cooke was born December 2, 1881, married Sophie Boyd Judd (1883–1966), granddaughter of missionary Gerrit P.
