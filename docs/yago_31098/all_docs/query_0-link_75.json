        "text": "Save Our Surf was\n\nhis battle cry\n\nBy Treena Shapiro\n\nSpecial to the Star-Bulletin\n\nENVIRONMENTAL activist John M. Kelly Jr. has spent his life fighting for Hawaii's coastal preservation.\n\nIn 1964, at age 45, Kelly founded Hawaii's Save Our Surf movement to prevent offshore development at such sites as Magic Island. The goal of SOS, Kelly said then, was to advocate for surfers by preserving surfing sites, promoting surfer safety and creating a positive image of the sport.\n\nOne of his key accomplishments was serving on the advisory committee for the establishment of Sand Island State Park.\n\nIn 1968, the park legislation prevented the building of a freeway from Honolulu Airport to downtown Honolulu. The plan had called for tunnels under Honolulu Harbor, which would have meant dredging and filling 280 submerged fishing and surfing reefs off Sand Island.\n\nSOS also was instrumental in preserving 140 surfing sites between Pearl Harbor and Koko Head, where hotels, parking lots and other developments would have destroyed the reef.\n\nFor his preservation efforts, Kelly was inducted into the Surfrider Foundation's Environmental Hall of Fame in 1990. In 1997, he was awarded the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association's Environmental Award in Costa Mesa, Calif.\n\nKelly served in the Navy during World War II and was on duty when the bombs fell on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. During the war, Kelly volunteered for a series of solo skin dives off Kahoolawe, where he retrieved one of three torpedoes fired at the island's submerged windward cliffs.\n\nNaval officers said these dives significantly impacted the course of the war in the Pacific. Adm. Chester Nimitz, commander in chief of Pacific Naval Forces, awarded Kelly the Navy's and Marine Corps' medal for heroism for this action.\n\nIn 1959, Kelly served as a delegate to the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Hiroshima.\n\nLincoln L. McCandless\n\nWater drilling led to\n\npolitical career\n\nBy Gordon Y.K. Pang\n\nStar-Bulletin\n\nIT is said that Lincoln Loy McCandless arrived in Honolulu from the mainland in 1882 with $140 in his pocket.\n\nWhen he died in 1940 at 81, he left an estate valued at $1.6 million and a political legacy.\n\n\"Link\" McCandless was the youngest of three brothers who made their mark after coming to Hawaii.\n\nIt was James McCandless who arrived in Hawaii first and recognized that artesian water wells were essential for the sugar industry.\n\nJohn and Link soon joined him and together the trio dived headlong into the water-drilling business and bored more than 700 wells in Ewa and Central Oahu, providing irrigation for Hawaii's sugar plantations.\n\nLink McCandless later amassed acres of land both on Oahu and the Big Island and also invested in sugar, cattle and horses. Part of the property wound up with his daughter, Elizabeth Marks, who sold 600 acres of Waiahole-Waikane land to the state in 1977.\n\nA Democrat for most of his life, he began a checkered, but resilient career in 1898 as an elected member of the Territorial House of Representatives and later in the Senate.\n\nBut for 24 years beginning with a defeat at the hands of Prince Jonah Kuhio in 1908, McCandless hit a string of eight defeats in his attempt to become Hawaii's delegate to Congress.\n\nMcCandless finally won in 1932 but almost immediately became embroiled with influential Democratic Mayor Johnny Wilson in a fight over which of them should be appointed governor by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Both lost out to Joseph Poindexter. In 1934, McCandless lost a re-election bid for delegate to Republican Samuel King. He was drafted to run as delegate, for the 11th time, in 1940, but was forced to withdraw after a heart attack.\n\nAs a delegate, territorial legislator and leading Democrat, McCandless fought for air mail to Hawaii, statehood, inclusion of Hawaii in U.S. farm aid programs and monies for flood control.\n\nAnna C. Rice and Charles M. Cooke"
