        "text": "Hawaii is overrun with Kitsch attractions. Most offer loud drums, propane tiki torches and aging paid performers. Some aviation museums purport to exhibit WW2 history but exist simply to sell trinkets and t-shirts.\n\nThe Manoa Heritage Center is authentic Hawaiian history. Century-old monkeypod trees shade the driveway leading to the main buildings. The trees were planted by Charles Montague Cooke Jr., a descendant of wealthy missionaries, when he built the gracious, Tudor-style home on the property in 1911.\n\nThe current residents, Sam Cooke, 78, and wife Mary, 79, are the third generation of Cookes to raise their family in the home, which they refurbished 45 years ago. Having inherited his family’s love of history, Sam Cooke filled the home with paintings by Hawaii artists and a collection of Pacific navigation books.\n\nHouses like this don’t exist anymore, the exterior rock work is by Japanese craftsmen. Other than plumbing and electrical upgrades, the home has been left as a noted Bishop Museum malacologist (someone who studies mollusks) built it.\n\nStanding in front of the stone heiau, you get a sweeping view of Manoa Valley and for a moment you can imagine it as it once was, filled with terraces of taro. Guided tours of the garden and heiau are open to the public, with volunteer docents explaining the legends and natural history of Manoa and traditional uses of native plants.\n\nA lava rock pathway, shaded by kukui and hou trees, passes by the meticulous layers of rocks that make up the lower heiau. Along the path is the Arbor, furnished with three stone benches originally cut as slabs for the home’s windowsills. The benches surround a konane, a Hawaiian board game similar to checkers.\n\nIf you don't visit the Manoa Heritage Center, you simply have not seen Hawaii.\n\nTours are $7 for adults, $4 for seniors and military, free for children and students."
