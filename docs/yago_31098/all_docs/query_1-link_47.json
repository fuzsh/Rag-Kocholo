Cooke Sr., its founder and principal benefactor. Born in Hawaii of American missionary parents, she had acted in the belief that art was important to the lives of all the people of the Islands and that each person has a moral obligation to contribute to the community.\n\nThe youngest daughter of New England missionaries, she grew up on Kauai and became the wife of Charles Montague Cooke in 1874. A successful businessman and builder in Honolulu, he moved his growing family into a large, three-story Victorian home on Beretania Street where Mrs. Cooke began her collection of art from around the world with what were known as \"parlor pieces.\" After her husband died in 1909, she decided to share her art collection with the local community. After a good deal of thought and numerous family consultations, she decided to tear down the old house, building an art academy on the Beretania Street property.\n\nMrs. Cooke chose Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue Associate of New York to design a place where people could draw inspiration not only from the art displayed but from their surroundings. Goodhue sensed the architectural needs of the gentle Hawaiian climate, where courts open to the sky and cooled by water trickling into fountains were practicable and they seized on the possibility of building into the structure adaptations of forms which the peoples migrating common soil, the Hawaiian Islands, had brought with them. The old Polynesian style pitched roof and a lanai reminiscent of those developed by the early missionaries spoke immediately of Hawaii and welcome, and the bold, simple forms of the stuccoed stone walls and heavy columns beneath the weathered tile roofs completed a sense of strength and timelessness.\n\nWithin the building the Chinese Court, surrounded by galleries full of the art of Asia, was placed to the West of the Center Court and the Spanish Court, the center of Western art, was to the East. This was done deliberately in recognition of Hawaii's location in the middle of the Pacific, with Asia to the West and Europe to the East. The materials used in building the Academy were carefully selected and reflected much of Hawaii's history. Granite slabs quarried in China to serve as ballast in the ships that imported Hawaiian sandalwood during the early 1800s were used as pavement; green glazed tiles also from China decorated the Chinese Court; Hawaiian lava rock was brought from Kaimuki; and unusual aggregate stone in which shells were embedded were barged over from Molokai and cut into flagstones for the entrance and the inner courts. Using trees and shrubs with special significance to Hawaiians she created a strong and unified entrance to the building, and in back a series of national gardens, English, French, Chinese, Spanish and Hawaiian complemented the courts and galleries.\n\nMrs. Cooke had opened doors not only to a building but to a whole universe and offered present and future generations of Hawaiian visltors a knowledge of their inheritance and background and a glimpse of the world's enduring beauty.\n\nHighlights & Collections:\n\nA Registered National Historic Place\n\nAccredited by the American Association of Museums\n\nJames A. Michener Collection of Japanese Ukiyo-e Prints\n\nSamuel Kress Collection of Italian Renaissance Art\n\nExhibits:\n\nEUROPEAN MODERNISM: DRAWINGS AND WATERCOLORS FROM THE ACADEMYS COLLECTION (1850-1950) (New title as of 16 July)\n\nNovember 7, 2002 through February 9, 2003\n\nGraphic Arts GalleryAs the Academy celebrates its 75th anniversary and focuses attention on its fine collections and the support of its generous donors, it mounts this exhibition presenting more than 20 drawings and watercolors by many of the English and European masters responsible for the development of a modernist vision in Western Art. These works by Edgar Degas, André Derain, Raoul Dufy, Paul Cézanne, Tsuguharu Foujita, Paul Klee, Amedeo Modigliani, Henry Moore, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Paul Signac, among others, are little seen owing to the fragility of their paper supports and fugitive media. The credit lines for the show carry the names of donors who have beenand still areinstrumental to the development of the collection of Western graphic arts. Included among them are the children of Anna Rice Cooke, the founder of the Academy, or their spousesAlice Cooke Spalding, Charles Montague Cooke, Jr., Mrs. Theodore A. Cooke, and Mrs. Clarence H. Cookeas well as other recent supporters such as Robert Allerton, John Gregg Allerton, and Mr. and Mrs. Henry B. Clark, Jr. This exhibition, with its checklist of extraordinary works and roster of generous donors, is a compelling reminder that the Academys collection is the result of a sustained commitment to the Academy and its collections over the past 75 years. European Modernism: Drawings and Watercolors from the Academys Collection, 1850-1950 provides a rare chance to see some remarkable collection highlights.\n\nTHE HAWAIIAN CALABASH: THE ANNA RICE COOKE COLLECTION\n\nNovember 12, 2002 through February 2, 2003\n\nHolt Gallery CollectionHonolulu Academy of Arts Founder Anna Rice Cooke was among several Kamaaina who understood the cultural importance of Hawaiian umeke and appreciated their aesthetic elegance. Some forty of these calabashes, showcased on the koa shelves of a display unit given by the Cookes, are the focal point of this exhibition. Additional calabashes donated by Cooke before her death in 1935 and by other collectors also appear, as do modern extensions of the tradition of wooden bowl manufacture with works by celebrated Hawaii-based artists Ron Kent, Michael Lee, and Robert W. Butts.\n\nCOMMITTED GENEROSITY: PROMISED GIFTS AND RECENT ACQUISITIONS\n\nDecember 5, 2002 through February 16, 2003\n\nHenry R. Luce GalleryFrom the Academy's prestigious collection, this exhibition highlights recent gifts an acquisitions given in honor of the Academys 75th anniversary in 2002. Since the museums founding in 1927, the Academy has been the recipient of numerous gifts to its permanent holdings. Now totaling over 37,000 objects, donations to the collections have helped to establish the Academy as one of the finest encyclopedic museums of its kind in the world. New acquisitions in Asian art have bought a range of material into the collections, building on strengths and filling in voids. From Gulab and Indru Watumull, rare Indian jewelry and decorative arts; from Drs. Ed and Julia Lewis, exquisite Mogul jade works; from Philip Roach, modern Japanese ukiyo-e prints; and from Christian and Sally Aall, other significant and historically important Indian objects.\n\nMajor gifts from the Aalls, the Watumulls, and Mrs. John Dominis Holt have allowed the Academy to create entirely new galleries including East Meets West: Cross-Cultural Influrens in the Arts, the Jahamandas Watumull Gallery for the Art of India, and the John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery for the Arts of Hawaii. Other collectors including Mr. and Mrs. Henry B. Clark, Jr., Barney and Pamela Ebsworth, John Levas, and the Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation, have made important contributions to the Western holdings. A recent donation of nearly 2,000 objects by The Christensen Fund has significantly broadened Academy holdings from Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, and Japan.\n\nThis exhibition, capping off a year-long celebration of the Academys 75th anniversary, represents a collaborative effort on the part of Academy curators and Director George R. Ellis. (Ellis is retiring February 1, 2003.) More than any other, this exhibition reflects the vision of founder Anna Rice Cooke in creating a museum that reflects the ethnic diversity and demographics of the Hawaiian islands.\n\nCHIC AND DANDY: CONTEMPORARY JAPANESE KIMONOS\n\nDecember 5, 2002 through April 6, 2003\n\nTextile GalleryThis exhibition highlights 30 contemporary Japanese kimonos and obis selected from the collection given by Hiromi Yonezawa honoring the Academys 75th anniversary. Mrs. Yonezawas mother, Nami Ninobe, collected over 700 kimonos over her lifetime, each carefully selected for the season, occasion, and the quality. The collection vividly reflects the distinctive taste of one cultured Japanese woman who had an extraordinary flare for traditional costumes. The exhibition features selections of sophisticated urban casual wear that boasts topnotch technique and innovative design. Numerous professional artists and artisans were involved in making these contemporary garments including Yamaguchi Itaro, a well-known Kyoto artisan and recipient of an Imperial Order.\n\nMASTERPIECES OF CHINESE LACQUER\n\nDecember 18, 2002 through April 27, 2003\n\nGallery 14A selection of Chinese lacquer pieces from the Mike Healy Collection. This exhibition will feature exquisite examples of Chinese lacquer from the Song (11th century) through the Ming period (17th century). The thirty pieces in this presentation are shown here for the first time as a complete collection. Reflecting the beauty of one of Chinas most lasting artistic traditions, this exhibition includes carved red and black lacquer and rare covered boxes with mother-of-pearl inlay.\n\nANCIENT CHINESE BRONZES: INSCRIPTIONS AND THE BIRTH OF THE WRITTEN WORD\n\nJanuary 8 through March 2, 2003\n\nMaurice J. Sullivan Gallery of Chinese ArtThe birth of the written word in Chinese art will be explored in a fine selection from the Shanghai Museums world renowned collection of Chinese bronzes which will be on display in the Maurice J. Sullivan Family Gallery of Chinese Art from January 8 to March 2, 2003. Ritual vessels from the Xia, Shang, Zhou dynasties and the Warring States period will be complimented by rubbings of the inscriptions found on the vessels.\n\nThe earliest object in the exhibition dating from the Xia period (18th-16th century B.C.) is a bronze food vessel known as a Ding while the most recent is an early Warring States wine vessel called a Hu in Chinese. The early bronzes are thin walled with minimal decoration but with a stately refined and restrained presence. Over time the bronzes were more heavily decorated with taotie masks and elaborate patterns. In a rare instance they became animal in shape as seen in one of the most unique items in the exhibition, a gong (wine vessel) in the shape of a bovine. In the Zhou dynasty (11th century B.C.- 8th century B.C.) there was an exploration of new shapes with a phasing out of the wine vessels and an increase in food vessels. A late Spring and Autumn wine vessel known as a hu in the exhibition is heavily decorated with an intertwined animal pattern consisting of a dragon, bird, and beast design. Another from the Early Warring States period (5th to mid4th century B.C.) is decorated with an inlaid pattern of figures and animals.\n\nEach of these ten vessels had a role in the ritual life of early China and were used as containers for food or wine. The inscriptions on them usually refer to a clan, the maker or the owner of the bronze or as a dedication to or commemoration of some past event. The rudimentary form of the earliest pictorial inscriptions gradually gave way to the sophisticated forms found on the Western Zhou and later bronzes. A large bell from a set of suspended bells represents the importance of music to ritual.\n\nThe exhibition will also include four hanging scrolls demonstrating different scripts of writing styles. These will be fully translated and on display with the bronzes and rubbings This exhibition is part of an ongoing relationship forged between the Shanghai Museum and the Honolulu Academy of Arts. It represents the third time a cooperative exhibit has taken place. In 2001 the Honolulu Academy of Arts partnered with the Honolulu Chinese Chamber of Commerce to bring a selection of Chinese jades to Honolulu. In the summer of 2002, the Academys Monet and Van Gogh were presented in Shanghai at a two-painting exhibition that drew over 250,000 visitors to the Museum. This partnership with one of Chinas most influential and progressive museums will continue to provide opportunities to share collections and delight audiences in both countries.\n\nKOREAN CENTENNIAL HAWAII-INCHON ART EXHIBITION\n\nJanuary 10 through 28, 2003\n\nAcademy Art CenterAn exhibition of contemporary and traditional works in a variety of media by members of the Korean Artist Association of Hawaii and members of Koreas Inchon Art Association.

Her work in this exhibition includes a selection of large glass pieces created by a complex process in which multiple layers of metals are vaporized and fused onto furnace-blown glass. She also incorporates dichroic glass into the pieces, which brings the brilliance of metallic colors into the glass. As a result, they reflect and transmit light in an unusual way. New York born Gay Jefferson graduated from Smith College and studied at the Honolulu Academy of Arts and has taught classes there since 1992. The work on view in this exhibition consists of mandala, botanical imagery, and landscapes which Jefferson describes as semi-abstract with an emphasis on the mystery and metaphor in nature.\n\nA WEAVING RETROSPECTIVE: 50 YEARS OF HUI TEXTILES AND ART\n\nFebruary 17 through March 16, 2003\n\nAcademy Art CenterCelebrating 50 years with a special retrospective featuring the best works by past and current hui members.

Their presentation of an annual juried show beginning in 1929, sponsorship of educational workshops and demonstrations open to printmakers and interested members of the public alike, and commissioning of an annual gift print since 1933 have nurtured a vibrant tradition of printmaking and print appreciation in Hawaii.

Baert started painting when she was 6. At 8, her drawings enthused her teacher so much, the teacher sent her first masterpieces to the Childrens Salon in Paris. Her Byzantine schooling in the art of icon painting took five years under Father Igor Sendler, an uncontested master of Russian iconography, at the Center of Russian Studies in Paris. He work, icons and frescoes, adorns chapels throughout Europe. Baert came to Hawaii in December 2000 and May 2002 and conducted sold out workshops in this traditional Christian art form. As a reporter for an architectural and design magazine, she traveled the world over. She also spent twelve years studying Egyptology and decoding hieroglyphs. She left Paris and moved to Vendome where she presented in a XVth century chapel an exhibition of 36 canvases and 5 icons. In Haute Savoie, Brigitte started working on frescos. Icons have become her passion. Icon painting is a time-honored tradition throughout Europe combining the art of painting, the manipulation of gold leaf, and the study of Christian iconography. It is an art of extreme precision which corrects itself to the tenth part of a millimeter. The artist works with three elements: mineral water, pigments, and gold leaves.\n\nKAMA'AINA CHRISTMAS\n\nDecember 13, 2003\n\nAcademy Galleries and CourtyardsThis is the Academy's gala black-tie fundraising event.

Luce Gallery\n\nThe people of Japan have had a great affection for the impressionist artists of France, especially late nineteenth-and early twentieth-century impressionist and post impressionist traditions. Over the years numerous Japanese public, corporate, and private collections have added to their holdings major works by preeminent French impressionist and post-impressionist painters, creating in Japan a significant visual record of their ground-breaking efforts. These works are stunningly beautiful, culturally rich, and conceptually provocative in their own right and are the foundations from which modern Western art springs. Organized by the Honolulu Academy of Arts, Corot to Picasso presents masterpieces by such artists as Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, Paul Guaguin, Paul Cézanne, and Vincent van Gogh on loan from many of Japan's premier collections, including that of the National Museum of Western Art, The Bridgestone Museum of Art, The Hiroshima Museum of Art, and the MOA Museum. This exhibition offers the people of Hawaii a unique opportunity to study French impressionism and post impressionism first hand. This spectacular exhibition will be guest curated by Dr. Katsumi Miyazaki of the Bridgestone Museum of Art, Tokyo, in association with the London-based firm Entwistle, one of the preeminent organizations specializing in the organization of Japan-based traveling exhibitions, and the Academy. Miyasaki is a senior scholar in the field of modern French painting in Japan. The Academy's own Curator of Western Art, Jennifer Saville, is Project Director. A fully illustrated, color catalogue to accompany this exhibition will be published by the Academy.\n\nART AND LIFE IN PARIS AND THE COUNTRYSIDE: IMPRESSIONISTS/POST-IMPRESSIONISTS\n\nApril 8 through July 31, 2004\n\nEducation Wing Gallery\n\nThis exhibition will be a companion show to From Corot to Picasso and drawn from the Academys permanent collection.\n\nMAY 2004\n\nHAWAII QUILT QUILD ANNUAL EXHIBITION\n\nMay 1 through 12, 2004\n\nAcademy Art Center (First Floor)\n\nThis popular exhibition of new quilts by local quilters features the latest in contemporary and classic designs.
