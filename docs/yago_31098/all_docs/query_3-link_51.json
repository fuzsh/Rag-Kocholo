        "text": "As Honolulu architect Harry Seckel noted, “The Hawaiian climate invites a special type of building but does not compel one. . . . It is sufficiently special to favor the development of a regional architecture but it is insufficiently extreme to force it.”1 Nestled in the latitude of lassitude, straddling the Tropic of Cancer, between nineteen and twenty-two degrees north latitude, the Hawaiian Islands are renowned for their benign climate. Moderate humidity, abundant sunshine, and year-round gentle trade winds combine with an equitable temperature to give Hawaii one of the most salubrious climates in the world. Here, human survival requires very little in the way of buildings, but architecture does more than simply provide shelter.\n\nA myriad of factors influence architecture within a locale and in Hawaii these factors have been as diverse as its climate has been stable. A remote geographic location and the limitations of island living have greatly affected Hawaii's architecture for the past millennium. The polyglot of peoples now living in the Islands has contributed a cosmopolitan quality to local life and architecture, and the political shifts from independent nation to colony of the United States to statehood have resulted in equally compelling architectural manifestations. The importance of religion, as well as the socioeconomics of plantation life and its aftermath, also cannot be ignored, nor can the recent acceleration of human travel with its accompanying globalization. The intermingling of these conditions has inexorably led to a distinctive architectural tapestry found nowhere else in the United States.\n\nLying almost in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, two thousand four hundred miles southwest of California, Hawaii is the most geographically isolated place on the earth, farther removed from any major land body or port of call than any other. The vast expanse of the Pacific, however, does not seem as daunting today as it once did. Now California is a mere five-hour jet journey, and New York or Tokyo but ten to twelve hours distant. Long distance communication via cellular phones, the Internet, and satellite television has built bridges across much of the Pacific Ocean's seventy million square miles. However, Hawaii's isolation profoundly affected its architecture and culture until at least the 1960s."
