        "text": "In 2003-4, the Musee d&#39;Orsay, Paris, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, mounted an exhibition, Gauguin Tahiti, examining the French artist&#39;s career in Tahiti and the Marquesas between 1891 and his death in 1903. The organizers, George Shackelford and Claire Freches-Thory, assembled paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, and ceramics by Paul Gauguin around his celebrated monumental painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? of 1897-8 (from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston).1 A striking feature of the exhibition was the inclusion of a number of Tahitian, Marquesan, and other Polynesian objects. These were meant to lend context to Gauguin&#39;s works, and to exemplify the indigenous artefacts to which he was in part responding. Yet these Polynesian objects turned out to have the disturbing capacity to command attention in their own right, even when pressed into the service of a purely Western art history concerned with Gauguin&#39;s artistic progress f...\n\nThis is no mere coffee-table book, but a serious work of painstaking scholarship, in which photographs are not mere “eye candy” but essential components. The author covers, in 224 pages, an historical horizon from the Lapita culture to the present, and to do this across a range of artforms that spans the whole range of plastic arts up to the most contemporary, and includes also the performing arts.I think this is a fine book, and an eminently worthwhile addition to the corpus of Pacific material culture publication.\n\nVanuatu’s sand-drawings are complex geometric designs made from a single uninterrupted line that begins and ends at the same point, creating a self-enclosed form. Drawn with a finger directly on the ground, in sand or ash, sand-drawings epitomise the evanescence of things while manifesting personal qualities, enlivened in the moments of their creation. While ‘official’ representations stress ‘original social function’ (UNESCO 2008), tending to view sand-drawing as a repository (USP 2013) for retaining and conveying socio-cultural information intact, Paama Island sand-drawers describe their experiences of sand-drawing in a way that is deeply personal. Indeed, each time a sand-drawing is created anew, the drawer recalls specific people, places and shared activities and abilities. From this perspective, the qualities, impact or ‘beauty’ of sand-drawing are latent and emergent in the moments of their creation, during which the simultaneity of a drawer and their predecessors’ shared capacity to create become tangible and present aspects of these compositions; sand-drawing reveals shared qualities that, for Paama Islanders, intimate a sameness, or ‘oneness’ (tai), that in idealised form is shared by siblings born within a territorial clan. I suggest that a sand-drawing’s ‘beauty’ is momentarily apparent in its creation and evanescence, because these conditions manifest its lived, relational qualities (Bateson 1972); qualities that reveal and recreate bonds that are important to the continuity of Paama Island’s agnatic clans."
