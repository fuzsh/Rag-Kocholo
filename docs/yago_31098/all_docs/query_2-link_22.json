        "text": "Children aged 17 and under receive free admission to the Honolulu Museum of Art’s Beretania Street and Spalding House campuses year-round; everyone else is admitted free on the first Wednesday and third Sunday (Bank of Hawaii Family Sundays) of each month.\n\nAnna Rice Cooke, a member of a prominent missionary family, founded the Beretania Street facility in 1927 as the Honolulu Academy of Arts. She and her husband, Charles, were stalwart patrons of the arts, and when their collection outgrew their home, Anna decided to establish Hawaii’s first visual arts museum.\n\nSince then, it has grown to be one of the finest museums in the country, with a permanent collection of more than 50,000 pieces from around the world spanning 5,000 years.\n\nThe Contemporary Museum opened in 1988 in Spalding House, Anna’s former home. As its name suggests, it focuses on art created from 1940 to the present. Its gorgeous, sculpture-filled gardens overlook panoramic views of the city. The Contemporary Museum and the Honolulu Academy of Arts merged as the Honolulu Museum of Art in 2012.\n\nBoth museums are closed on Mondays"
