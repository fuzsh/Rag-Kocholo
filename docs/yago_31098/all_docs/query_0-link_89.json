        "text": "HOME OF THE FISHES IS OPENED\n\nA Place to Learn and Enjoy for the Visitors.\n\nAN EFFORT BY HONOLULU’S WEALTHY FOR THE BENEFIT OF EVERYONE.\n\nOn the Saturday of this past week, the Aquarium of Hawaii, which stands in Waikiki, makai of Kapiolani Park opened for viewing. This opening was not an opening for the general public, but it was for just those who were invited to come see. This Sunday is when it will be open to the public.\n\nEarlier, it was reported in the columns of the Kilohana¹ that a home will be built where Hawaii’s fishes will be kept, and in the end, the report has come true as the building was entered by the invited guests and will be entered by Honolulu’s people on Sunday.\n\nMany years ago, there was a thought to build an aquarium in Honolulu nei, and Dr. Dorn was the one to come up with the idea; however, because the Government held back some of the resources, this idea by the doctor was dropped and it slept quietly until it was revived by the Rapid Transit Company [Hui Kaauwila]. This idea was considered seriously by this group, when Mr. James Castle [Kimo Kakela] and Mr. and Mrs. C. M. Cooke stepped in and encouraged the effort.\n\nMr. James Castle gave a portion of the land of Kapiolani Park, which he held in lease, as a place to build this home. When Mr. C. M. Cooke and his wife joined in this effort, that is when the Rapid Transit Company realized that their dream that they were dreaming would come true, and Mr. and Mrs. C. M. Cooke graciously gave the money for the construction. Therefore, the Rapid Transit Company was left to collect Hawaii’s fishes for the aquarium, and that is how the aquarium here on Oahu came to be.\n\nThis is seen in the great lands all over the world, and its importance is recognized. One of the benefits is that knowledge is gained by those studying the life of fish, and this is taught at universities. And some thousands of people graduate, being educated in where various ocean fishes live, like whales, sharks, the fishes of the ocean floor, and outside of those, the small fishes of the sea shore.\n\nAt the aquarium of Hawaii mentioned above are the many fishes of Hawaii; the ocean fishes are separated from the fresh-water fishes, and according to the visitors who went to see this new place and who have seen the displays of the Foreign Lands, …\n\n¹From the subtitle of the Kuokoa Newspaper: “Ke Kilohana Pookela no ka Lahui Hawaii” [The Greatest Prize of the Hawaiian Nation]\n\n[Go check out the Waikiki Aquarium today, Saturday, 3/22/2014! The 110th anniversary celebration continues with fun for the entire family! $1.10 admission to the Waikiki Aquarium all day! Activities include: the Great Marine Chalk Art Draw and Kids Doodle Zone, entertainment by the UH Rainbow Marching Band, Rainbow Dancers, and other guests groups, a special performance of the musical “Honu by the Sea,” free giveaways (while supplies last), LEGO build area, samples from Pepsi, educational and entertaining activities and much more!]\n\n(Kuokoa, 3/25/1904, p. 1) Continue reading →\n\nAN AMAZING AWA BOWL.\n\nBrought over by Jim Davis, the supercargo [kupakako] of the steamer Upolu, was a stone awa bowl that has a god image [kii akua] on its side. It is estimated to be 150 years old. This kanoa was found in the earth of Halikiki, Kona, Hawaii, a few feet underground. It was found when the land was being worked to plant coffee, and some people said there was a house foundation there in the olden days. There are many who say that a kanoa carved out of stone is very rare, and that most seen to this day are made from wood. This kanoa will be taken to the Bishop Museum after the one who it belongs to gives his consent.\n\n[There was also this story on a stone kanoa at the Museum. And this did not i hear make its way to the Bishop Museum…]\n\n(Aloha Aina, 6/9/1900, p. 6)\n\nPROVERBS.\n\nIn order for us to hold on to all of the olelo noeau and all of the ingenious deeds of the Hawaiian people, we very much want everyone to assist the Bishop Museum in their collecting and explaining of wise and witty sayings known amongst this race.\n\nSo that this endeavor will move forward, whenever an ancient olelo noeau comes to mind, or perhaps a riddle, do write it down and send it to the museum; and if not to there, send it directly to the Kuokoa with clarification of its hidden meaning or deep wit.\n\nHere are some olelo noeau sent from the museum to this newspaper:\n\nHe ala iki ko kahuna.\n\nAohe pau o ka ike i kau halau.\n\nAohe hookahi halau i a’oia ai.\n\nHe maia ke kanaka, a ka la e hua mai ai, hua.\n\nO-u i ka maka o ka wauke o i opiopio.\n\nAohe ipukai pau i ka iole.\n\nAohe malama pau i ka iole.\n\nAole e nalo na iwi o ke alii kolohe. E nalo na iwi o ke alii maikai. Oluna, olalo, okai, ouka, o ka hao pae, ko ke alii.\n\nUa mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono.\n\nE hele ka elemakule, ka luahine, ame ke keiki a moe i ke ala.\n\nOla na iwi o kaua.\n\nHiamoe loa ke kane, nana wale ka wahine.\n\nMai noho a hele kikaha aku.\n\nUa hala i Kauai, i Kalalau.\n\nAohe pilo uku.\n\nI ke alo iho la no ka ulu a o ka hala no ia.\n\nHe ohu ke aloha, aohe kuahiwi kau ole.\n\nOno kahi ao luau me ke aloha pu kekahi.\n\nPa mai, pa mai ka makani o Hilo: waiho ka ipu iki, homai ka ipu nui.\n\nKa i ke pohuehue, ha’i ka nalu.\n\nMonia, monia, alealea i ke kumu pihapiha: Lawea mai!\n\nO kau ola ia, e Ku ame Hina; O ko’u ola ho’i ia. I ka olua pulapula i keia ao. Amana, ua noa.\n\nPua ka neneleau momona ka wana.\n\nPala ka hala, momona ka uhu.\n\n[And presumably from the responses came the publication we all know today as “‘Ōlelo No‘eau: Hawaiian Proverbs and Poetical Sayings”. Some of the examples above are included with different phrasing, while others appear not to have been included. If you don’t have a copy of this publication, it is a must have!]\n\n(Kuokoa, 9/14/1922, p. 5)\n\n[Found under: “Bits of News from Kauai”]\n\nKahelelani\n\nThose lei blossoms, the momi of Niihau of Kahelelani, Mr. and Mrs. Niau, and their daughter Mrs. Miriam Hanaike and her daughters, have arrived, and they are spending their days gazing at the beauty of Manookalani [Kauai], the flower garden famous for the fragrance of Mokihana. They will return to the land famous for the Shell Lei [Lei Pupu].\n\nNiihau O Kahelelani Hula\n\n1. A he nani Niihau o Kahelelani, Ko lei pupu e kaulana nei.\n\n2. Hoohihi ka manao la ilaila, I ka pua lei Momi o Kahelelani.\n\n3. Aohe ou lua ae like ai, E kaulana nei a puni ka honua.\n\n4. He nani hoi kou, Ua kaulana hooipo ia nei e ka nui manu.\n\n5. Puana ka inoa ua lohe ia, Ko pua lei momi poina ole.\n\n6. Haina ia mai a na ka puana, A he nani Niihau o Kahelelani.\n\n(Your writer has composed these lines of poetry.)\n\n[Abbie P. Palea had a regular column in Hoku o Hawaii, writing about various happenings on Kauai. She often wrote in with poetic compositions by her own hand. Here is just one of them. Although you will find credit given to Joseph Kelly (Keʻale), at the Bishop Museum’s Niihau Shell Lei Exhibit going on now (see it while you can!), i would suggest that because there seems to be no counter claims in later newspapers to Palea’s statement, that “Niihau o Kahelelani Hula” was indeed written by her.\n\nThere is so much to be learned from the old Hawaiian-Language Newspapers!]\n\n(Hoku o Hawaii, 8/28/1940, p. 1)"
