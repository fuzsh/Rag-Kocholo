They have bequeathed to us a heritage\n\nof which we are justly proud and which should be an\n\ninspiration in the coming years to our descendants.\n\nThe Cook Coat of Arms\n\nThis is the most widely used of all Cook Coats of Arms and\n\nhas been in existence for many centuries. It is described in\n\nBurkes General Armory, Burkes Landed Gentry, Burkes Peerage\n\nand Baronetage and other reliable works of heraldry, in some\n\ncases accompanied by illustrations. It has been used by many\n\nAmerican Branches of the Cook Family. A Coat of Arms is an\n\nemblem or a device which is displayed by titled persons,\n\npersons of royal blood, and their descendants. Coats of Arms\n\nwere originally used for purposes of identification and\n\nrecognition on the field of battle as well as in civil life.\n\nThere are records of Coats of Arms, in one crude form or\n\nanother, at different times of ancient history. Heraldry, as\n\nwe know it today did not become of importance until after the\n\ninvasion of England by William the Conqueror, A.D. 1066. It\n\nbecame of general interest at about the time of the Crusades.\n\nARMS Or, a chevron gules between two lions passant,\n\nreguardant, sable.\n\nA golden shield bearing two black lions, walking\n\nand looking back, separated by a red chevron.\n\nCREST Out of a mural coronet argent, a demi-lion rampant\n\nsable, gorged with a ducal coronet or.\n\nA black half-lion, collared with a golden ducal\n\ncoronet, rising from a mural coronet of silver.\n\nMOTTO Tutum monstrat iter\n\nor Tutem monstrat iter\n\nHe showeth a safe road\n\nor\n\nHe leads the way\n\nThe English Cooks\n\nThe Cook family has been prominent in the British Empire and\n\nthe United States, its members having played important roles\n\nin war and in peace. Family pride is a commendable trait and\n\nshould be cultivated. All Cooks have just cause to be proud\n\nof the family history and traditions.\n\nThe name of Cook was first used by those whose occupation\n\ncorresponded with the name. In such days as those, with the\n\nnumber of personal retainers and the excess of hospitality\n\nexpected of the feudal chief, the culinary department was a\n\nvery significant part of the baronial establishment.\n\nOur Cooks are relics of the old \"le Cook\", \"le Coke\" or\n\n\"Cokeman\". The Anglo-Saxon form is \"Cuc\" or \"Cucca\". Coke is\n\none of the earliest forms and in the Doomsday Book there are\n\nseveral tenants styled \"Cocus\" and one \"quida Coquus Regis\".\n\nAmong the earliest records of the Family Cook or Cooke in\n\nEngland is that of Gilbert Cocus or Cook, of the time of\n\nWilliam the Conqueror. Families of the name were to be found\n\nat early dates in counties of Norfolk, York, Cambridge,\n\nBedford, Northumberland, Worcester, Kent, Cornwall, Devon,\n\nEssex, Sussex, Lancaster, Hants, Middlesex, Suffolk, Surrey,\n\nOxfordshire, Warwick, and London and were for the most part,\n\nof the landed gentry and yeomanry of Great Britain.\n\nIt is not definitely known from which of the many\n\nillustrious lines of the family in England the first\n\nemigrants of the name to come to America were descended, but\n\nall of the families bearing the name are said to be of\n\nancient origin and many of them were of common ancestry. It\n\nis thought our people were from Kent or Yorkshire and were\n\ndescendants of Sir Henry Cooke, a son of Bryan Cook of\n\nYorkshire in the early seventeenth century.\n\nThe Cook Family is among the forty-nine \"Best Families\"\n\nselected by the American Historical-Genealogical Society. And\n\nour family is among the largest and oldest of the colonial\n\nfamilies still in existence in the United States today with a\n\nheritage of which we are justly proud.\n\n\"History with it's flickering lamp stumbles along the trail\n\nof the past, trying to reconstruct it's themes, to revive\n\nit's echoes and kindle with pale gleams the passion of former\n\ndays.\" --Sir Winston Spencer Churchill\n\nBiography\n\nHENRY COOK There are four generations in our family where our direct ancestor had the same name. Our first American forefather was Henry Senior who was at Salem Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1638, it is believed that he came from England shortly before that date since there is no record of him prior to that time. It has been recorded that Henry was born in County Kent in England, but this is not definitely known. The name of Henry's father has not been established it is known that there were several distinct branches of the family Cook or Cooke in England in the 1600's all of whom could trace the family lineage to the earliest ancestor, Gilbert Cocus or Cook or Cooke who lived during the time of William the Conqueror in the eleventh century The name Sir Henry and Sir George Cooke of Yorkshire appear in the seventeenth century, they were sons of Bryan Cooke of that county, and is the first appearance of the given name Henry. It is not definitely known from which of the many illustrious lines of the family in England the first immigrants of the name to come to America were descended, but all of the families bearing the name are said to have been of common origin and of ancient ancestry. It has also been stated that Henry was a descendant of the Cooks of Hertfordshire.\n\nOur Henry was a Puritan in his religious beliefs, this probably being the reason for his early immigration to New England, since there was a great deal of discrimination practiced in England at the time against those of the faith. He was obviously a successful farmer and active in the political atmosphere of the colony. His name is mentioned on several occasions in the records of the proceedings of the Common Council and the Salem Town Records. In these records the following reference is made; \"Henry Cook and Samuel Ebourne appointed to be surveyors for the north neck and all fields about the Glass House, and for about Though. Goidwaight field and VP to Michele Slaffin.\" at a town meeting of the Selectmen 14 Jan 1659/60. And secondly, \"At a General Town meeting held 3 March 1661; Granted that the lands lying along the highway against Though. Goidwaites andgiven to Hugh James and by him sold to William Robinson and the Widow Cooke (Judith) from the way to the brook as it was divided by Mayor Hathorne and William Bartholmew, shall all belong to the widow Cooke and William Robinson\" Although the family of Frederick Cooke, of the Mayflower had resided at Salem none bore the given name Judith, this can only refer to our family. Judith was the daughter of Henry Burdsall or Birdsall who arrived in America in 1632 from Yorkshire County England. Henry Birdsall was a member of the First Church at Salem in 1636 and was registered a freeman May 2, 1638. Henry was a widower and he came to Salem with Judith age 13 and a son, Nathan age 21. Judith of course being the wife of our Henry Cook. Both Henry and Judith remained at Salem where they died, sons Henry Jr. and Samuel removed to Wallingford, Connecticut at an early date the other children all remained in Massachusetts.\n\nHenry Junior emigrated to Wallingford in 1674, his brother Samuel having emigrated to the same Place in 1670, both were original proprietors of the town and First settlers of the village as well as of the Commonwealth. Samuel was one of the signers of the Fundamental Orders in 1670 which was one of the first forms of a constitutional government in America. Henry was a farmer like most of these rugged individuals and early settlers who were entirely self sufficient for their own needs. He was active in politics and was frequently elected to offices of trust and responsibility by the people of the town. Of him it is recorded in the early Wallingford town records under the date February 10, 1689 or 1690; \"Hennery Cook, cast lotts (with others) for the Falls Plaine.\" These were the undivided lands set aside when the town was first settled to which Henry was entitled to share in under his proprietory and first settler rights. The town of Wallingford at that time included the present town of Meriden and the Falls Plaine was located at what is now Meriden and South Meriden, where Henry subsequently emigrated and where he lived the remaining years of his life.\n\nHENRY III AND THE COOKS OF NORTHBURY -- by Frank W. Cook\n\nThe earliest list of inhabitants of Northbury parish, Litchfield County, Conri. is a roll of subscribers to the town for winter privileges bearing the date of September 29th 1736. Among the 16 names on the roll are the signatures of Henry Cook and his eldest son Johnathan. Yet it is known that Henry was living at Northbury nearly a decade before this date. The deeds reveal that he was living there in 1727 and further that he was probably there in 1725. Henry was the first settler of the town, of the area now within the bounds of Thomaston and Plymouth, Connecticut.\n\nHenry was born at Wallingford and was only seven years old when his father took the family to live at Hanover, south of Wallingford in 1690. He married Experience Lyman, a daughter of Richard Lyman in 1705 the same year his father died. His father left an estate valued at 301.5.06 pounds. Experience died in 1709 having given him a daughter, Martha. He took as his second wife the following year, Mary, daughter of John and Mary Frost and widow of John Wheaton and went to Branford to live. Death again struck and Mary died after presenting Henry with two children, Jonathan and Pheobe. He married as his third wife Sarah, daughter of Richard Turner or Towner, widow of Samuel Frost, in 1719. We know little of Sarah only that she gave Henry four children, Sarah, Ebenezer, Henry and Thankful. The family resided at Wallingford for a time and later at Waterbury. In 1725 Henry was one of the seven men who went out from Branford and Waterbury under the command of a sergreant for the protection of Litchfield upon the threat of an Indian attack. Apparently Henry liked what he saw of Northbury for he soon returned with his family to Twitch Grass meadow where he lived the rest of his life.\n\nThe history of the region and the deed records reveal that Henry owned and held title to many hundreds of acres much of which he bought and sold to other settlers. He held title to a lead mine at one time which was an important commodity in those times. In May of 1738 he was one of the signers of a petition to the General Assembly requesting that the Commonwealth grant parish privileges to Northbury. Henry Was also one of the founders of the First Congregational Church in 1740, still active today at Plymouth. The story goes that on one occassion he was taken aback by the high tax levied upon him by the church, thinking that it was too high he refused to pay it and he changed his affiliation to the Church of England. In 1737 his property was entered on the Waterbury Grand List at a value of 66 pounds tax and stood 40th in the town and 7th of the early inhabitants of Northbury.\n\nHenry's sons remained at Northbury. Henry Jr. like his father was also involved in any number of real estate transactions both with his father and in his own right. Like his father he also engaged in farming among other pursuits and was closely associated with his brothers Jonathan and Ebenezer. He bought his first farm in 1744, his name appears on the tax rolls that year when he was assessed the sum of 50 pounds. The following year he married Hannah, daughter of Nathan and Mary Benham also early settlers of Northbury. In 1762 he served in the French and Indian Wars, in the 2nd Conn. Regiment, the same unit his father served in and the same his sons Selah and Lemuel would serve in during the Revolution. The family seems to have resided at several locations after their arrival in 1725, within the vicinity of Thomaston. The home that saw the arrival of the fifth generation was located on the hill just above the village of Thomaston, it may have been erected by Henry 3rd it isn't known with certainty. Henry died a young man in 1771 and as is the case with his father no marker has been found indicating the resting place. Yet history records their names as first settlers of the region. In 1795 the village of Plymouth was incorporated the name being chosen in tribute to the 1st settler, it being supposed that the family originated at Plymouth Mass. Had they known the facts it might well be known as Salem today. In any event Lemuel was residing there at that time and was one of the incorporators and represented his grandfather and the family.\n\nAbove by - Frank W. Cook, 1978\n\nHenry Cook III was born at Wallingford and was about seven years old when his father made the family home on the Falls Plain. He remained in this area for many years until after the death of his first wife in 1709, at which time he removed to Branford where he was a widower a second time and subsequently married a third time, all in the space of ten short years. In 1725 Henry went to Waterbury and from there to Northbury, where he was the first settler of the town. The first record of him there was in 1727/8 which was the deed to his farm. The earliest roll at Northbury is the list of subscribers to the town for winter privileges, which bears the date September 29, 1736, the first name being that of Henry Cook. His autograph is the most distinctive of all of the early inhabitants and denotes a strength and independence of character. This list also shows sixteen other names among is that of Jonathan Cook, who was Henry's eldest son. The Plymouth Congregational Church was founded May,17, 1740, Henry and his family being founding members of the church. The site of Henry's farm has been stated in the History of Plymouth as ; \"Henry Cook built on the west bank of the river on what is known as the West Branch, called Wooster Swamp, Cur Northwest Inhabitants, Northbury and Plymouth Hollow and most recently incorporated as the village of Plymouth.\" More correctly Henry's farm and first homestead was located at what was them called ; Welton's Meadow, and is closer to the village of Thomaston than to Plymouth, all of this vicinity having been refered to as Northbury. The History of Waterbury written by Bronson in 1858, refers to the location of the farm; \"He had a farm on which he lived on the west bank of the river (Naugatuck) not far from the Litchfield boundary.\" Although not specifically stating so this places the location of the farm in Welton's Meadow, where in fact it was located. In 1737 Henrys property was entered on the Waterbury Grand List at 66 Pounds, which stood the fortieth in amount in the town, and the seventh among the other early inhabitants and early settlers of Northbury. In May 1738 he was a signer of a petition requesting that the General Assembly of the Commonwealth grant parish privileges to Northbury, which was subsequently complied with. The exact date of Henrys' death has not been determined, it is known that it occurred at Northbury where he lived the remainder of his life. The last record of him is a deed transaction which he signed with Henry Jr in 1748. During the first years of settlement of the town Henry was very active in the purchase and sale of real estate in the town which will be seen, he was also engaged in the development of a lead mine which was found on his property that he had obtained title to in addition to the several successful farms he owned and operated over the course of his lifetime at Northbury.\n\nHenry Cook the fourth was born at Branford and of course he came to Northbury with his father, where he lived thoughout his lifetime. It is not known what disposition was made of his fathers' estate since he died intestate and no other proceedings were had9 The holdings were evidently rather large consisting of at least 125 acres, Henry apparently receiving the larger portion since he was the only son who remained at Northbury. Henry served in the French and Indian War during the Campaign of 1762 in the Connecticut Militia his unit being the 2nd Conn. Regiment, the same unit his sons Selah and Lemuel were to serve in the Revolutionary War. The records show that Henry died in the township of Waterbury, actually it was in Northbury in the area where the farms of his father were situated subsequently changed by the movement of the town and village boundary lines. The four Henrys were certainly courageous individuals and always gave a good account of themselves, they lived the motto appearing on the family coat of arms 'They Lead the Way'.\n\nMore Henry Cook biography\n\nHENRY COOK is accredited as the First Settler of Plymouth Connecticut. He was born at Wallingford and he 1ived at Branford and it is said he removed to Litchfield before 1727. It is\n\nthougt that he may have been one of the seven men Of Branford who were sent up from the coast, under the command Of a Sargeant, for the protection of Litchfield in 1725, and that the new town was so attractive to him that he decided to settle there with his family. Possibly Daniel Rose, from the same place was also one of these 7 because Henry Cook of Litchfield and Rose Of Branford bought land as partners in the township of Waterbury less than two years after the twenty one men fros Branford, Guilford, and Wallingford marched thru Waterbury ari their way to the new town in the wildernness.\n\nThe earliest name applied to the region now occupied by Plymouth and Thomaston was, Up River, so named in 1688 because it layed in the up river division of meadow lands. Twitch Grass meadow was selected at a later day as the name for the same region, to distinguish the little hamlet from their distant neighbors at Woster or Wooster Swamp. Taken collectively the present towns of Oakville, Watertown and Plymouth were in 1730 sometimes called Wooster and sometimes Our Northwest lnhabitants. Thirty acres of the elevated ground or plain on which the Village of Thormaston stands was the Up River division . Twitch Grass Meadow is the extensive meadow west of the river just below the village. The natural expanse of meadow just above\n\nThomaston bridge has long been known Andrew's meadow. Just above is a ridge which divides it from Welton's up river division. It was in Welton's meadow that the supposed first house in Plymouth was built.\n\nIn Weltori's Meadow on Feb. 2, 1727-8 Henry Cook of Litchfield and Daniel Rose of Branford boght of Gershom and Abigail Fulford, Thomas and Mary Porter - heirs of Stephen Welton - two thirds of a Lot of land \"Supposed to be ten acres more or fewer lying towards the upper bounds that was our grandfathers, John Welton's deceased.\" February 1, 1727-8, or the day before Henry ard Rose had bought of Thomas and Mary Porter, twenty acres to be taken up in the undivded lands, and the next day they had it laid out on the west side of Welton's Meadow. January 14, 1728, nineteen and a half acres were laid out to The same parties \"at a place called Welton's meadow,\" and the same day still another \"triangle\" piece of thirteen acres, both pieces having been bought of Jonathan Scott Junior. On April 10, 1730, Henry Cook had laid out, \"a little southwest of Twitch Grass Brook,\" a diamond shaped piece of land that contained one hundred acres, this was sold the same year, to Jeremiah Hull. Before January 10, 1731, Henry had built a house in Welton's Meadow, because he sold at that date to one Beach of Cheshire, forty acres from the south end of his farin on the west side of the river, joining to the river, and in 1733 he owned a house and lot of seventy acres with the river running thru it, about fourteen acres of which were east of the river. This farm, with a house and other buildings, fruit trees, and fences - all upon the west side portion of it - he sold in 1733 to Ebenezer Elwell of Branford. ln 1730 he gave one John Standly L70 in bills of public credit for his L40 interest in the towship. Henry laid out one hundred acres with Rose at the west branch of the river in 1730; over a hundred acres with Thomas Brooks at Poland (then in Waterbury) in 1731; numerous other purchases and lay outs filled the time until 1735 when Mr. Southmayd conveyed fifty-three acres to Henry. After the sale to Elwell of his first house, he built another house, at least he sold land in 1737 described as \"sixty nine acres with a house upon it, with buildings, fencing, fruit trees, timber, stones, watering and appurnances\" to John Humaston of New Haven. This deed his wife Sarah signed with him. The land was by the Litchfield line - bounded north \"on land left for a highway by Litchfield bounds.\" In 1739, he had a house at Poland, with \"a brook running on tile east side of It.\" In 1748 Henry Cook and his son Henry Cook Jun. quit-claimed to Samuel and Enoch Curtice (or Curtis) \"lands at Poland, originally called Lewis and Judd lots, excepting one hundred and twenty five acres. Upcn this land which he had reserved his house stood.\n\nThe first settler of any town holds a unique position, this information will help to identify the site of Henry's first and subsequent farms, which can now only be positively located through examination of the deeds held by the present owners of these tracts of land first developed by our forefather. Henry was certainly a man of courage, enterprise, and had a spirit that withstood injustice. while he was apparently one of the foremost promoters of the established church, he seems to have been so incensed one year at having his property four-folded, put on the tax list at four times its real value - when perhaps he could not get to the town spot with his tax list -that the next year he went over to the Church of England.\n\nCooks in the Revolutionary Army\n\nLemuel Cook Married Hannah Curtis\n\nTimothy Coleman \" Elizabeth DeWitt\n\nJacob DeWitt \" Jenneke DePuy\n\nNathan Bixby \" Martha twitchell\n\nJoseph twitchell \" Deborah Fairbanks\n\nWilliam Milliken \" Esther Tagart\n\nAaron Burr \" Martha Tobey\n\nDavid Baldwin \" Lois Churchill\n\nAbijah Foster \" Artemesia Blake\n\nDr. Obadiah Blake \" Zipporah Harris\n\nSelah Cook \" Lucy ???\n\nTrue Worthy Cook \" Freelove Dodge\n\nThe Statement below refers to Henry IV.\n\nESTATE OF HENRY COOK FROM THE COURT OF PROBATE AT WOODBURY CONN.\n\nAt a court of Probate held in Woodbury July 7, 1772, HANNAH COOK the widow of HENRY COOK late of Waterbury, deceased, appeared and enformed that said deceased died intestate and desired to take administration of said estate; this court accepted thereof and did on the date above grant letters of adinistration unto her, sufficient bond being given.\n\nGIDEN WALKER, Clerk of Probate LS\n\nON the date and day above written the above administrator appeared and reported said estate insolvent, and in such case according to law commissioners are to be appointed and this court doth appoint Mr. Timothy Pond and Mr. Cornelious Graves both of Waterbury, commisioners to receive and examine the claims and at the expiratian of six months from the above date to make their report to this court of their doings.\n\nGIDEN WALKER, Clerk of Probate LS\n\nOn the date above written the Court doth appoint the widow HANNAH COOK guardian to three of her children not capable by law for their support, Viz TRUEWORTHY COOK, LEMUEL COOK and HANNAH COOK, said HANNAH COOK appeariring, declared her willingness to accept of said care and trust reposed in her, bond sufficient being given.\n\nGIDEN WALKER, Clerk of Probate LS\n\nAt a Court of Probate held in Woodbury, September the fifth 1772 The administrator of the estate of Henry Cook late of Waterbury, deceased, appeared and exhibited an inventory of said estate and made oath to the truth thereof where upon it was accepted to be recorded and is as followeth A true and perfect inventory of the estate of Henry Cook late of Waterbury, deceased, made this fourteenth day of August 1772 by us the subscribers, appraisers under oath.\n\n....Inventory Omitted....\n\nThere is a dwelling house listed as part of the estate but no mention is made of real estate.

I was born on June 2, 1611in England.\n\nI married Henry Cook on June 29, 1639 at the First Church of Salem when I was twenty. At that time I think there was only one other family by the name of Cook in the colonies. Our ten children were all born in Salem. I think Henry was born in North Gray Parish, County Kent, England in 1615. His father was Edmund Cook and his mother was Elizabeth Nicholls Cook. Like most everyone else we knew Henry was a Puritan by religion. Father was always an active member of the church, too.\n\nI don’t know much about government and how it operates but I do know that things are so different now than when I first came here from the old country. Most of the first immigrants to come were from our Puritan church. Later other religious groups came to join us, but we were the first. I guess there were a lot of people who came who were Strangers too, but I don’t know any of them. There were many companies in England that sponsored people to move here and the different areas where people settled were named for the company that sponsored the people. For instance, there was the Plymouth Plantation, Massachusetts Bay Colony, and the New Haven Plantation. We called this whole area New England because we had all come from England. When the first of our church people left Holland and England to come to America in 1620 there were only one hundred and two of them. There was no settlement here for them to join when they arrived in Plymouth on the Mayflower. Those families were different from the many other men who had come to this land before them. The others came to trade, explore or just for the adventure of it all, but our people came to live. Many of them died that winter, but that didn’t change our minds about this land. Those old planters stayed and built new lives for themselves and their families. Their lives were so hard, but they stayed and I am glad they did.\n\nIn the ten years after the Mayflower arrived here there were a lot of different land grants made by the King. Many new groups of Puritans came here and started to build their own little settlements around Plymouth. In 1628, with a charter from King Charles I, a group of about sixty Puritans arrived and built to a small settlement they called Salem. They had a governor and eighteen assistants, who were elected by the company, but the best thing about this new charter was that their main government was not in England, but right here in New England where they lived. The old planters of 1620 came with great excitement for building a new life but they had little knowledge of how to do it. By 1630 there were educated men and a few men with money who came here to start new lives. There were even some men of Parliament and preachers among the new arrivals. I guess in 1630 alone more than one thousand people came. Father, Nathan and I came as a family, in 1632, and we were also a part of a church congregation with our pastor as our leader. Most of the members of our church in England moved with us to New England. We settled in Salem where others of our church family already lived.\n\nI don’t know exactly when Henry and his brother John came to New England but it was after my family had already settled here in Salem. I don’t remember if Henry ever told me what ship he came on. It wasn’t very important to him to remember things like that. Henry was a free man when he came to Salem at the age of twenty-three. Not everyone was free in those days. Many young men had put themselves in bondage with the company in order to get passage to New England. The company owned everything, even the people. Many people came as indentured servants, who were contracted to work a year or more in order to gain their freedom, and then they were free and could work for themselves. I heard once that when there were 3000 people living in this area only 350 of them were freemen. In fact, Henry helped John Talbey by taking him in as a servant for a year in 1655. The town supplied John Talbey with shirts, cloth for a coat and his bed and covering and John lived with us for the year. Henry received eight bushels of Indian corn from the town for his service.\n\nI think Henry had lived in Plymouth for a little while before he came to Salem. I don’t know for sure but Henry may have come to Plymouth as an indentured servant and served his work time there. He never really told me about his past. I do know that when Henry arrived in Salem he came with enough cash to buy some property. Henry registered his first six acres of land in Salem on December 25, 1638; Lot Number 68, by the cove. We were not rich but Henry was a hard worker and saved his money and we were able over the years to acquire several more acres of land. In January 1645 we built our house near the intersection of Washington and Essex Streets and that is where Henry died on Christmas Day 1661. He was only forty-six years old. Many of the men around here die young. That was twenty-eight years ago. I can’t believe how fast the time has gone. After Henry died I was able to keep the house and lived there for several more years before I sold it. Since them I have lived from time to time with several of our children. Over the years more and more people have come to Salem to live and more and more houses have been built. Washington at Essex has become the main intersection in the center of Salem. Our old house has been torn down now. It was on the western half of the lot and Reverend Edward Norris was on the other half. Our other neighbors were Edmond Batter and Samuel Sharpe’s field.\n\nIn 1649 Henry the town council granted forty acres beyond the river which included a beautiful meadow. Then in 1655 Henry and a couple of other men who owned adjacent land in that area had to give their land back because the selectmen wanted to lay it out as common land to make the town square for Salem.\n\nIn the early days all of the animals were brought here from England on the ships, those animals had babies, then those animals had more babies and now we have large herds of sheep, swine, cows, and goats all over New England. Henry was a hard worker. He was a butcher or slaughterer by trade, but over the years he did several other jobs to support our family. His first job, soon after we were married, was the keeper of the swine. For this job he received six shillings for each animal each day. He would go through town in the morning on his way to the pasture outside the settlement. As he walked he blew a horn and the owners of the swine would bring them out for him to drive. Then at sunset he would return the swine to their owner’s homes. As the swine keeper Henry was responsible for any animal that was lost. He had to pay the owner for lost animals, but, if the animal was killed by a wild beast he was excused if he brought back part of the flesh as evidence of the attack.\n\nFor many years Henry worked as a butcher and farmers would bring their animals to him to kill, cut up and prepare for preserving and cooking. Henry had a building on the back of our property where he did his work. Young John Talbey helped him in this work and our older sons often helped him too.\n\nIn March 1659 the town council appointed Henry as fence viewer or surveyor for the north neck, about the glass house, and Goldwaith’s field. He worked as a surveyor until his death in 1661. This was a much easier job for Henry as he was not well and found lifting the heavy carcasses a great effort.\n\nWe had ten children but Elizabeth died very young. Most of us married women seem to have a baby about every two years. We have one baby and by the time we wean it there is another baby to take its place. I had ten babies in eighteen years. There was always a baby in our house, but for some reason some of my babies came in pairs. Our twins Rachel and Judith were born in 1645 when Isaac was three and Samuel was two. John came when the twins were four so that gave me a little breather but there was still five children under seven years old. The twins Martha and Mary were born in 1650, then Henry junior, Elizabeth and Hannah. Henry died when our nine living children ranged in age from four years old to twenty-one. It seems like my life had always revolved around caring for our home and raising the children. After Henry died I had so many more responsibilities it was very difficult for me. The older children helped with the younger ones as much as they could but they were getting to an age when they needed to start their own lives.\n\nI suppose all mothers believe it too, but I think all of our children are energetic, intelligent and patriotic citizens and I am very proud of them and their accomplishments in life. Our sons, Samuel and Henry, moved to Connecticut but most everyone else is still here in Salem where they have married and raised their families. I have many grandchildren and will probably have great-grandchildren soon. I am so proud of all of them.\n\nFor years I have talked about the old country. For me the ‘old country’ or ‘back home’ is England. I have never gone back home. My children have never been to England and probably never will. Samuel and Henry have moved to Wallingford in the Commonwealth of Connecticut. They will probably someday be called the ‘old planters’ of Wallingford because they were the first families to settle the area. Samuel and Henry refer to Salem as ‘back home’. The way we talk is strange. England is not my home anymore. My home for fifty-seven years is Salem. I am home.\n\nNOTES:\n\n1.

May I display it on my web site and if so who should I credit. Also I am interested in how you came by it. I am 85 now and would like to leave as much data as I can for my family. I have many descendants and one great great grandchild.\n\nBurr Cook\n\nemail: info@burrcook.com\n\nWeb Site: www.burrcook.com\n\nd mail account\n\nFavorites\n\n·\n\nInbox\n\n2\n\nfree books\n\nDrafts\n\n2\n\nSent objects\n\nSpam\n\n174\n\nTrash\n\n14\n\nlennie\n\nMy folders\n\n·\n\n449.67 MB of 50 GBMail quota\n\nMobile synchronization of all data\n\nDrop EML file here for import\n\nHi there cousin! So nice to meet you!\n\nI’m so glad you enjoyed it and that you hadn’t seen it before. I was quite thrilled (and amazed) when I found it. Most of the historical stories are bits and pieces – that one is remarkable. The language in it seems rather modern which makes me wonder if someone cleaned it up along the way, but the names, dates, places all seem correct, AND adds certainty about the lineage to Edmund, which has been greatly questioned on all the sites as it pertains to Henry and his brother John. (At present, both have been deleted from WikiTree for lack of proof. I posted the story and asked they be re-entered.)\n\nFor me, it matters that John is put back because I’m at a brick wall with my John Cook of Dover from the 1600s. He’s our “first-in” (that we know of thus far) on my dad’s side, and an exciting find because we have an unbroken male line! I’m one of only 2 female cousins… when my older cousin was born she was the first female in 50 years! He’s also an original settler of NH, and yet no one actually knows where he’s from, when he was born, or who his parents were. (Very, very odd because NH kept very good records even back then.) The trees on the genealogy sites all claim to know but it’s a mess of erroneous information. People just see something similar and click ACCEPT, and as you know, there are a LOT of Cooks to get mixed up! I can’t tell you how many rabbit holes I’ve been down. On the shared sites like Geni, Wiki and LDS, even when you point out the reasons the connection is wrong they just leave it there. It’s weird… why would someone WANT incorrect information?? Now, I don’t even look at the hints, they’re all the same ones and they’re all wrong. ☹ Oh well.\n\nAnyhow, I’ve come across your most excellent history online many times, but never fathomed we might be connected. It’s really quite good, you have so many details and your Cook information is really interesting… little did I know I would later find the possible Henry/John connection.\n\nI’ve dabbled with our tree for a decade or so, but have worked more earnestly for the past two years when we had a death of an elder. The younger generation started asking, “Where did we come from?” and the older generation (mine, I’m 55) started to panic! LOL We better start asking before it’s too late! One day, I hope mine will look like yours!\n\nIn an effort to get away from the bad site-hints I joined NEHGS/American Ancestors and Godfreys and started going to the library to search. I’ve been looking for every male Cook in the correct time frame that ISN’T on any genealogy websites. (I’ve searched every possible one that IS there!)\n\nYour Henry and his brother John fits the bill. The ages/locations/immigration year, etc. all work and they haven’t been listed (and messed with) because until Judith’s account was uncovered, there hasn’t been proof to find that Edmund was their father. (Which also means they don’t come up as the dreaded hints!) That’s exactly what I was looking for… a male Cook that exists, born in the right time-frame, but not already polluted all over the sites. Voila! The beauty of this John is that if he’s the right one, the rest of the lineage is there! (Except for a wife… which is good… so it can be my John’s wife!)\n\nSo, I’ve known about your site for a long time, (you come up in a LOT of Cook searches!) but Judith’s transcript I just found yesterday. I was entering presumptive search terms and tried this one because I’ve had luck with land grants in NH:\n\n“colonial land grants massachusetts john cook”\n\nThe first entry for that search was the Judith bio. Later last night I was doing more searches and came across your link and knew you would want it if you hadn’t seen it.\n\nI’m sure you can re-post it, most people are happy someone is actually reading it!\n\nModified Register for Henry Cook\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1. Henry Cook was born about 1615 in Yorkshire, England. He died on 25 Dec 1661 in Salem, Mass..\n\nHenry was the first Cook in America. He was at Salem, Mass. in 1638 and most likely\n\narrived in US a short time before that. He is believed to be a descendant of the Cooks\n\nof Kent or Hertsfordshire who migrated from Normandy in the 11th century. He came\n\nto New England as a Puritan. Sons, Samuel and Henry Jr. emigrated to Connecticut\n\nwhile the rest remained in Mass. The family also lived at Plymouth Conn. for a time.\n\nThe farm was passed to the widow after he died and it is unknown where it passed\n\nfrom there. Henry was a Butcher .\n\nResources : Families of Ancient New Haven p27.\n\nNote. I recieved the following eMail from another Cook tracker:_ \"The only information I found on\n\nHenry Cook/Judith Birdsall, was from a Winch-Fitzmeyer\n\nGen. Database Chart...and they have his parents as Edmund Cook and Elizabeth Nichols,\n\nHenry Cook/AnnaGoodere John Cook 1486. What do you think? I can't seem to do anymore\n\nresearch on Henry if I am not sure who his parents are. We do have the Cook info at our\n\nSt. Lib. But like I said, they are on the other Cooke Line, Frances of the Mayflower.\n\nOthers wrote me and said we do not connect with them, but they have no proof one way\n\nor the other. Any ideas?\"\n\nThe Below comes from - Jane Hadley - Subject: Re: DIRECT DESCENDANT OF LEMUEL COOK.\n\nDuring the seventies, my son and I made a trip through the Nes England are and on to\n\nEngland ...following the migratory footsteps of my forbears. We found many interesting\n\nthings, among which was the church and cemetery in Beaminster where among the coats\n\nof arms and family names painted on the walls near the ceiling were the names of my\n\nancestors.......and in the cemeterties were the time ravished stones that had been lovingly\n\nplaced in their memory so many years ago. We visited the Pomeroy Castle in Totnes,\n\nEngland. And left our signatures in the guest book as we did in Cornwall, where we found\n\npaintings from and earlier day depicting scenes from Wm. The Conqueror with\n\nRolf de Pomerai at his side.....It was quite a thrilling experience.\n\nHenry married Judith Birdsall daughter of Henry Birdsall and Judith or Agness Kempe on 29 Jun 1639 in Salem, Mass.

This can be confusing\n\nbecause of the two Cook lines:\n\nFollowing is my attempt to make it clear.\n\nDaniel, (no relationship to Lemuel Cook) and Rebecca Pomeroy had son, Enos Pomeroy Cook\n\nEnos Pomeroy Cook and Polly had a daughtr, May Ann Cook.\n\nMary Ann Cook married Homer Cook, who named their son after her father, Enos Pomeroy Cook.\n\nIn essence what we have is a descendant of Daniel , Mary Ann, marrying a descendant f our\n\nLemuel......which, if I am correct, means I am a descendant of the original Aaron Cook from whom\n\nDaniel is descended , as well as Lemuel.\n\nBoth were Revolutionary Soldiers....maybe I'll start tracing Daniel...I did at one time but those\n\npapers have disappeared or perhaps I gave them to someone and don't remember who.\n\nRegards to all\n\nJane\n\nHomer married Mary Ann Cook daughter of Enos Pomeroy Cook and Polly Sutton about 1844 in Elba, NY.
