For information about accessing another patient's information in MyChart by setting up a proxy account, click here to learn more.\n\nBJC HealthCare and Washington University Physicians take very seriously the safeguarding of our patientsâ€™ personal information. The following includes information on how we verify your identity before activating your MyChart account.\n\nWe utilize a secure third-party identity verification system as part of this sign-up process. The process starts with gathering some personal information. This information is used to perform a soft inquiry of your credit using EXPERIANHLTH. A soft inquiry means information is gathered to create questions to help verify your identity. For example, a prior address or the make/model of a car you have purchased. The soft inquiry made by EXPERIANHLTH appears on your credit report but does not affect your credit score in any way. No information regarding your credit score or credit history is acquired or retained by BJC HealthCare or Washington University Physicians as a part of this process. Once your identity has been verified, you will be able to complete the sign-up process.\n\nIf you have any questions or if you do not wish to activate an account using the process described above, please contact our Help Desk at 314-273-1966 (toll-free: 866-273-1966) for other options to create a MyChart account.\n\nPlease note: this sign-up process is only available for patients 18 and older.
