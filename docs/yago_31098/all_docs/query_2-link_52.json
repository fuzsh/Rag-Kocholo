        "text": "Cooke History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons of Britain first developed the name Cooke. It was a name given to someone who was a cook, a seller of cooked meats, or a keeper of an eating-house. The surname Cooke is derived from the Old English word coc, which means cook. 1 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Cooke family\n\nThe surname Cooke was first found in Essex where the first found record the name was Aelfsige Coc (c.950) who is recorded in an early reference of Anglo Saxon Wills, 3 more than one hundred years before the Norman Conquest and the arrival of Duke William at Hastings in 1066.\n\nGalter Coc was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 in Essex and almost two hundred years later, Walter le Kuc was listed in the Assize Rolls of Cheshire in 1260. Continuing the quest, we found Richard Cok in the Assize Rolls of Staffordshire in 1269, Henry Coke in the Assize Rolls of Somerset in 1279, Ralph le Cook and Joan Cokes in the Subsidy Rolls of Sussex in 1296. Robert le Couk was listed in the Subsidy Rolls of Sussex in 1327 and Roger le Kokes in the Subsidy Rolls of Staffordshire in 1332. 3\n\nThe Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 listed John Cocus in Norfolk, Alexander Cocus in Yorkshire, Emma Coca in Cambridgeshire and Matthew Cocus in Oxfordshire. 2\n\nIreby in Lancashire was home to another branch of the family. \"This place is written 'Irebi' in the Domesday Survey, and then comprehended three carucates of land. In the reign of James I., lived Thomas Cooke de Irebye. The family of Cooke were the former possessors of the Hall, sometimes called Fothergill Hall, and sometimes Nether Hall.\" 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Cooke family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Cooke research.

In the Middle Ages, even the literate spelled their names differently as the English language incorporated elements of French, Latin, and other European languages.

The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts.
