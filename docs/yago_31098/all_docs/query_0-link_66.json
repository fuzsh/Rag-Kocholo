Alexander Appointed for three years The Hawaiian Mission Children's Society THE ANNUAL MEETING. For the far away Cousins, whose bodily presence was elsewhere but who came very near us in spirit on our reunion day, April 24, we would give a moving picture and short resume of the day. We wonder if their telepathic vision took in the approach from old Kawaiahao church — the old coral Chamberlain house, whose straight lines, small windows and inset doors speak of the upright character and strong, unflinching purpose of the missionaries ; the stone wall enclosing the yard on King street and Kawaiahao lane; the im- mense, overhanging samang trees, the tamarind and the mangoes, the grassy lawn which extends in front of this and on past the office which was the long-ago printing office, and the old frame Mission Home, or \"Cooke House\" as many remember it. A hibiscus hedge, a kukui tree, two cocoanut trees and two other little palms are there but do not obstruct the view. Passing around this building and two old wells, between these and the Kaiulani Home for Girls, we reach the rear lawn. This is shut in on the \"makai\" side by a high board fence over which clambers a purple bougainvillea, and on the \"mauka\" side by the stone kitchen of the Mission Home draped with the alamanda vine bursting into yellow bloom. Be- tween these stood the tent, decorated with branches of \"Gravillia Kobusta\" in yellow flower, the large, tropical variegated \"Pothos Aurea\" vine and a jardiniere of rare yellow lilies, all golden, to rep- resent the years and the experience of the guests of honor. In some ways it was like old \"General Meeting\" days, for chil- dren's voices could be heard inside the tent and outside. There were little cherubs there in their mothers' arms, and children perched upon their fathers' shoulders, to answer to the roll-call by families; there were boys and girls on the front seats trying to read from the charts on the easel ttfie names of their forbears; there were young men and maidens, and men and women in the prime of life, all wreathed in smiles and full of interest. And there were the guests of honor — sons and daughters of the missionaries, whose snowy locks covered memories of these old grounds more wonderful than stories of fairy-land; for these men and women had slept in these old rooms, pumped water from these wells, played \"I spy\" in the old attic, and assembled at these gates to walk, bare-foot, over the treeless dusty plains to Punahou school. Oh, the stories these sons and daughters might have told that day! There were, in 1852, two hundred thirty-five of this second genera- tion, of whom one hundred sixteen remain. Seventeen of these were present in body on Saturday, and many more in spirit. Twenty-nine remembered to send either a message or photograph. It was especially when gathered about the long photo-covered tables in office and Mission House that memory dwelt long on other days and we felt the presence of those we loved in the precious days of long ago. There were many friends and visitors present. It could not have been a representative meeting otherwise, for in olden days these homes were never without guests, and all, from the king to the homeless stranger, were welcome. With President G. R. Carter in the chair, much business was transacted in short time — officers elected, appropriations made, con- densed reports read, a new trustee, F. C. Atherton, appointed to succeed the late A. B. Clark ; a collection of $91.22 was taken and a donation received from Mrs. E. K. Wilder of $1,000 for the care of the dear old home where she was born. There was music, too — ''Blest be the Tie\", that has bound this society together for sixty- three years, and that other song, for closing, sung by all Cousins and lived by them in many lands, ' ' Waft, waft ye winds His story. ' ' There was a new item of business, a \"Report from the Chamber- lain House Committee.\" This report told of a conference meeting with a committee from the Hawaiian Board relative to the raising of funds for their Memorial Building. It was presented by W. W. Chamberlain, A. C. Alexander speaking on behalf of the Hawaiian Board, was commented upon favorably and accepted. So harmo- nious was the expression that the $15,000 needed seemed a small sum between us and the realization of the hopes of the Cousins for a restored Chamberlain House, representing the home life of the sainted mothers, and a share in the new Memorial Building of the Hawaiian Board, headquarters for the continued work of the Fathers. The following brief statement is made for the benefit of absent Cousins. The Need of the Memorial Building. 1st. To better house the Hawaiian Board which, with its many branches, is carrying on work among all the various nationalities in Hawaii nei, and in the administration of which much office room is required. 2nd. As a fitting and permanent memorial to the Mission Fath- ers this building in which to continue their work should be erected. As the Cousins are the direct descendants of the Fathers and Mothers, and the Hawaiian Board continues the work of the Fath- ers, what more fitting than that they join hands in honoring the memory of those so dear to both organizations. The Cousins' Part in the Memorial. The Cousins have for years past been working and planning for a Missionary Memorial Building to be erected on the Chamber- lain grounds. Now comes the proposition from the Hawaiian Board to join with them in the erection of a Memorial Building on the opposite side of King Street from the Old Mission Home. We are to raise at least $15,000, the first $7500 of which shall be used for the restoration of the old Chamberlain House to its original state, to be later furnished with old \"mission-used\" fur- niture. The second $7500 shall be given to the Hawaiian Board's Memo- rial Building, in which we will have the free use of a vault and adjoining rooms on the second floor, and will become the trusted custodians of the old Records of the Mission as long as we occupy the building. The new president, Miss A. E. Judd, has since enlarged this Chamberlain House Committee, and it is already planning for the year's work. The Roll-Call by Families was not quite so exciting this year as last. Many Cookes and Alexanders being absent from the city the Judds easily led with 25 descendants present. The Halls, how- ever, with 12 present, numbered as many as the winners the first year, and the Chamberlains were not far behind. Besides the \"Roll-Call by Families\" and the \"Roll-Call of Sons and Daughters,\" there was begun a \"Competitive Honor Roll, ' ' on which are to be placed the names of all descendants pres- ent at the Annual Meeting for five consecutive years. There were ninety-nine cards of attendance signed this year. For next year's Annual Meeting the President has a plan that will appeal especially to the boys and girls, or fourth generation. THE SECRETARY'S REPORT A Summary of the Year. The manuscript of the 1914 Annual Report was sent to the print- er on May 6, and seventeen days later the 500 books were received at the Old Mission Home and were immediately sent to their various destinations. The small number made it expedient to send but one book to a family, except to those families whose members are greatly scattered. A few copies, however, are still reserved for any who wish for one. There has been but one extra meeting this year — the delightfully informal reception given Mrs. Lydia B. Coan to celebrate the 80th anniversary of her birth in this Old Mission Home. Certificates of stock in the Morning Star have been received from Mrs. Emma Lyman Wilcox, Mrs. Agnes Boyd Judd, F. S. Lyman and Mrs. H. C. Coleman. Mrs. W. Hyde Rice contributed an old letter written by Mr. Ely, found among Mother Rice's papers. Mrs. H. C. Coleman gave a booklet, \"The Story of the Morning Star\". We already had, from Miss Chamberlain's collection, \"Sequel to Morning Star, No. 2,\" and we now want, \"Sequel to Morning Star, No. 1.\" The legacy, amounting to $2,500.00, left by our Cousin Mrs. Stangenwald, the interest of which is to be used in the education of Hawaiian children, was accepted with many thanks, and is now pay- ing the expenses of three dear little Hawaiian girls, one at Kameha- meha and two at Maunaolu. The mothers of these girls were for- mer Maunaolu girls who have \"made good.\" One died recently, and the other two are widows. We believe the girls will do credit to Mrs. Stangenwald 's liberality. Mrs. Eleanor Waterhouse Wood has since presented the Society with Dr. Stangenwald 's large book- case, a \"what-not,\" four flower-vases, some of Mrs. Stangenwald 's beautiful handiwork in wax, leather, hair and shells, some photo- graphs and some of Mother Dimond's dishes that she often loaned to Fort Street Church for church socials. Mrs. H. M. Alexander has given a koa table made by Father Emerson. More genealogical records have been secured and placed in the Big Book. Boxes of old letters, essays and papers have been classi- fied and indexed. The books, also pictures and other belongings, have been indexed and, thanks to Mr. Atherton, there have been made typewritten copies of the Thaddeus journal, besides other journals and letters loaned to the society. I It has been a great treat to welcome back some long-absent Cousins, Dr. Hiram Bingham of Yale with his family, W. R. Castle, Jr., of Harvard, Prof. Martha Beckwith of Vassar College, Prof, and Mrs. Van Slyke and Mrs. Eleanor Waterhouse Wood; and also to greet the Misses Eowell and Clara Dole, and Mr. George Bates and his sister, children of Dudley C. Bates. There have been 14 marriages among the Cousins this year, 31 births and 21 deaths. \"We have received 9 new members and the total number of Cousins is 1004. MISSIONARIES, CHURCHES, ETC. Our friends of Nauru, Mr. and Mrs. Delaporte, and Miss Meitz- ner, have been in the line of the world-wide war. One letter in- formed us that all work at the Pacific Phosphate Co. had ceased. On Sep. 9, the Australian cruiser \"Melbourne\" touched at Nauru and destroyed the wireless station, taking the two operators pris- oners. They left the people with short rations, but on Sep. 21st a Norwegian steamer arrived bringing foodstuff and soon after the supplies sent from Honolulu reached them, relieving all anxiety. Mrs. Delaporte was quite ill in August and may be obliged to leave Nauru soon. Augusta and Paul are doing well in the Oberlin schools and Mabel has gone to be with them. The latest news, however, from the Delaportes is that they have been allowed, by the American Board, a furlough, on account of the health of Mrs. Delaporte and Miss Meitzner. They will touch here and proceed to the mainland, where Mrs. Delaporte will be with her children in Oberlin, Ohio, while Mr. Delaporte, in New York, expects to see the completed Bible in the Nauru language, and a book of 250 hymns, with tunes, through the press. In this work he will have the assistance of a young man, Kim Jedidamo, whom he has trained from childhood. The A. B. C. F. M. delegation, on their return from the centenary celebration at Bombay, India, Aug. 15, were royally entertained by members of the Hawaiian Board. They were shown the sights of the city, lunched at Central Union Parish House and were taken to a grand mass meeting at old Kawaiahao Church, where they were greeted by the Hawaiian Board and Woman's Board of Mis- sions, by representatives from the Hawaiian, Japanese, Chinese and Portuguese churches, and in song by the Kamehameha schools. They can never forget their day spent in Honolulu. On Aug. 17, Miss Tollman, a friend and former co-worker with 8 Lucia Lyons at Pang Chuang, China, spent a day here on her re- turn from her vacation. In August, Rev. Kimura, the \"Moody of Japan,\" spent a few weeks in Honolulu, speaking in Central Union, Y. M. C. A., and at all the Japanese churches. His slogan was \"1000 souls for Christ in Hawaii.\" \"Dan Crawford\" was here in May and June and spoke to large crowds from C. U. church pulpit, at the Y. M. C. A., at Men's League and in the theater, also on the islands of Maui and Hawaii. He received financial aid toward establishing two schools in Africa, to be called \"Honolulu\" and \"Maui\". Then in July we had the pleasure of hearing Charles M. Shel- don, author of \"In His Steps,\" who spent two weeks in Hawaii while on his way to New Zealand. He also spoke at C. U. church, at the Y. M. C. A., at an evangelistic meeting in the theater, and at the Hawaiian Evangelical Association at Wailuku, Maui. That meeting of the Association at Wailuku, the 92nd Annual Conference, was said to be one of the best ever held. Hospitality abounded, temperance and anti-saloon work was enthusiastic, sun- rise meetings were an inspiration, Bible-readings under A. A. Eber- sole constituted a feast, sanitation and hygiene, Sunday attractions for children, music — all combined to make the convention a delight. Peace seemed to permeate all discussions and meetings, and \"aloha\" was the key-note to which all nationalities were attuned. In the Methodist church there have been changes. Rev. Elmer Smith, who had won a place in the hearts of people of all denomina- tions, resigned to go to Portland, Oregon. Rev. Wm. H. Fry, who has charge of the Korean churches, has entered with zeal into the civic welfare of our city, and Rev. E. E. Brace, with his interesting family, has come to supply the Methodist pulpit. Central Union Church loaned its minister, Dr. Doremus Scudder, for two months to the \"Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America,\" to assist Dr. Sidney L. Gulick in bringing about juster relations between the United States and Japan. Bible study, under Rev. A. A. Ebersole, has been taken up by \"A Business Men's Bible Class\" on Tuesday evenings, The Woman's Class on Thursdays, and the Young People's Class on Sunday mornings, and these have proved interesting as well as helpful. The Bible-school held its annual picnic on Oct. 3d at Pearl Harbor, where with boat excur- sions, races, games and slides, an excellent dinner and car-ride, it was voted a grand success. The next day the school assembled in force for the opening of the new Bible-school year. 9 The Anti-Saloon League, under Dr. J. W. Wadman, Superintend- ent, and Secretary George Paty, have done strenuous and efficient work in closing saloons, holding up licenses and educating the peo- ple to welcome prohibition. The Y. M. C. A. with its 1500 members and able leaders, its twenty-five Bible clubs, its educational classes and its games, is a wonderful power for good. A Christmas present of $500 was do- nated for a swimming pool, and an artesian well is being bored on the lawn back of the building. The Y. W. C. A. has never seemed so wide awake as now. The Homestead, precious as the home of Father and Mother Castle, was in need of repairs, and a delicatessen sale brought in the funds. Since then it was found that $3868 were needed to complete the budget for the year, and a committee sent out for one day raised the amount with $500 over as a fund for the new building. The Castle Home for Children has lost, through illness, the Misses Johnson, who for thirteen years have been the efficient man- agers of that charming home, and \"mothers\" to the little ones. Miss Belle Johnson has since passed on to her reward from San Jose, Cal. Miss Gould, formerly of Kawaiahao Sem., now takes the place of matron. The Beretania Settlement, or McKenzie Mission, is prospering, and rejoicing over the return of Mr. McKenzie, in apparent health. The Palama Settlement has fitted up its playground with sand- pile, swings, tennis court and ball ground, besides a new open-air school-room. A new departure last summer was a fortnight's out- ing by the sea at Kaipapau for ailing mothers and little ones. Many Cousins (W. R. Castle, Dr. Baldwin, Ernest Clark and others) have helped on this enterprise. Thanksgiving Day with its delicious dinner was a happy day for over 500 little folks of all nationalities, at the Kakaako Settlement. The King's Daughters, in a very unique way, secured a beau- tiful Mother's Day memorial of $1000 as a part of the $20,000 needed for the King's Daughters' Home. SCHOOLS. During vacation the Normal School held a six weeks summer session, which was attended by 150 or more teachers. The Y. M. C. A. also held a six weeks summer school for boys, which was quite popular. The Public Schools re-opened on Sep. 14, with H. W. Kinney as Superintendent of Public Instruction, an able Board of Trustees, 10 and about 700 teachers. The new open-air school-houses have eased the congested condition of the school-rooms. The College of Hawaii held its Commencement exercises on June 1st with four graduates. The baccalaureate sermon was preached by Dr. Doremus Scudder. The new president, Arthur L. Dean, ar- rived in July, and on Sep. 2 a brilliant reception was given him at the University Club by the faculty, regents and Yale graduates. The Kamehameha Schools held their Commencement exercises. on the evening of June 4th, when an audience of 1000 or more peo- ple assembled on the illuminated lawn to see the 13 boys from the Preparatory Department, 21 girls from the Girls School, and 18 boys from te Manual Training School graduate. The morning and afternoon had been given over to an Industrial Exhibit. There were shown drawings, paperfolding, useful articles made in wood, and vegetables grown by the Preparatory boys ; class-room work by the girls, dresses designed and made by them, cakes, can- dies, preserves, bread, roasted meats and salads ; and by the Manual Training boys there were tables, bureaus, doors and cottages, paint- ing, printing, piping, and electric-wiring, as well as an exhibit of vegetables, live-stock and various lines of dairy work. With deepest regret the Kamehameha Schools have parted with their efficient President, Perley L. Home, who, during the past ten years, has ruled so wisely and introduced so many improvements. In July a farewell reception was given Mr. and Mrs. Home by the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution of Honolulu. The loss by death of Miss Ida M. Pope, the beloved principal of the K. Girls' School, seemed little short of a calamity. Memorial serv- ices were held at the school and in Central Union Church. Also on the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Girls' School in Decem- ber, most touching encomiums were passed upon her. In November the Trustees tendered a brilliant reception to the new President, E. C. \"Webster, who arrived July 15th from New Haven, Conn., with his family. Hilo Boarding School. — In April, 1914, an appropriation of $35.00 was made by this Society for a Hilo Boarding-School \"work scholarship.\" This has been given to Philip Naone, a little boy in whom Mrs. W. W. Hall has been greatly interested. That the Cousins may understand this unique feature of the school we quote from the prospectus. \"Each pupil of the Hilo Boarding School is expected to pay $35, and to give an additional three hours daily of honest labor for board during the year. This merely covers the board expense as the tuition is free. The applicant may be set to 11 work either upon the school farm, in the domestic department, or in the school workshops. Any worthy Hawaiian boy who is willing' to give an additional hour of work daily to cover his actual ex- penses, is allowed to enter as a Work Scholarship Boy, without the $35.\" \"The Hilo Boarding School finds that this system has had an elevating effect on the lives of the boys.\" \"A boy who is self- supporting has a self-respect which is wanting in the boy who is liv- ing off the bounty of his friends. Honest work has assumed a dig- nity in his eyes, since thereby he is able to procure for himself not only an education but the common necessities of life.\" All success to this character-building school! We wish the Cousins could send a dozen boys instead of only one. Maunaolu, — filled to its limit of 81 girls, has had a successful year. Miss Heusner says the school has never since her connection with it been so prosperous, as she is pleased with the work in all departments as well as with the general spirit and character of the girls, and adds, \"I do think this country life is ideal for girls.\" There were eight graduates from the academic and two from the sewing department. The graduating dresses, carefully designed and made, were the girls' own handiwork. One innovation follow- ing Commencement exercises was a luau, planned and served in the play-house by the girls. An excellent operetta was rendered on the 6th of June. One little story of Maunaolu, told briefly, beginning thirty years ago, singles out from the 100 interesting pupils, four girls, studious, industrious, and trustworthy. Later, these married, and though tempted and tried in many ways, remained true to the principles of Maunaolu. Recently, one died, and shortly before two others became widows, each the mother of a large family. One of them said, \"I prayed God to remember the widow and the fatherless, and I thank God he heard my prayer and sent good friends in the time of need.\" As a part of the answer to that prayer, we love to think that the Father of the fatherless prompted our dear Mrs. Stangenwald to bequeath to the Cousins a legacy, the interest of which goes toward the education of Hawaiian children, and also pointed out the girls, and opened the way. The schools were full. There was no vacancy at Kawaiahao and but one at Kamehameha. As bright, interesting Helen Naone already had a sister at Kameha- meha, she was received and welcomed at once. Miss Heusner kindly \"made room\" at Maunaolu for motherless Miriam Lane and dear little Mary Kauelo. Again Providence opened the way by sending, on a vacation to Honolulu, Miss Case, a Maunaolu teacher, who, on 12 her return, on New Year's Eve, quite won the hearts of waiting friends by saying as she stepped aboard, \"Where are my two little girls, ' ' and taking them by the hand to her room. The fourth Mau- naolu mother said, as she looked at her own little girl who \"crying pitifully\" to go, \"They are lucky little girls.\" It is t( be hoped that some way may be opened in September for Lulu t< become a \"Maunaolu girl.\" Mid-Pacific commencement exercises for both departments were held at Mills School on June 9th. Eleven boys graduated from Mills High-School, and twenty from Mills Grammar Grades. There were also sixteen girl graduates from Kawaiahao Grammar. Pre ceding Commencement Day there was Kite-flying Day, Tree-plant- ing Day, the Baccalaureate sermon preached by Dr. Ferguson, calisthenic and acrobatic exhibition, and an industrial exhibit eluding commencement dresses made at an average cost of $1.50- whole week of festivities. The new term opened on Sep. 21st with Dr. Ferguson and Mis Bosher in charge of the two schools, and a full and enthusiastic ban< of teachers and pupils. A long waiting list also testifies to the pop ularity of the schools. The year has been an eventful one because of the semi-centennial anniversary of the founding of Kawaiahao Seminary. The celebration occurred on Nov. 28, and consisted of pageant on the terraced grounds; a reception in the spacious ha] to the first principal, Mrs. L. B. Coan, the present principal Mis Bosher, and a member of the first class, Mrs. Imhof f ; and an alum nae-trustee banquet in the decorated dining-room. The grace anc beauty of action in the \"Spirit of Kawaiahao,\" the brilliant setting the harmonious blending of dignity and gaiety among the 300 alum nae, patrons and trustees, with the valuable historical papers read and the beautiful \"Dream of the Future\" given by Miss Bosher are graphically told in thirteen pages of the Dec. \"Friend\" to which we refer all interested. At this meeting $10,000 was pre sented to Kawaiahao by Mrs. Juliette M. Atherton, $5,000 by Mrs Anna Cooke, and $250 by pupils and trustees. The sudden death of the president Dr. W. P. Ferguson on Jan. 5 came as an irreparable loss, not only to Mid-Pacific, but to Honoluli as well, and the text of Dr. Wadman 's discourse at the funeral hel< in C. U. church, \"know ye not that a prince and a great man has fallen in Israel this day,\" voiced the feelings of all who knew him Punahou. — On May Day, 1914, the students under Mrs. J. M Cox gave a Greek play at the Pergola and I/ily Pond. It consistec of scenes taken from Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, with Greek cos 13 tumes and dances. Later the dramatic club staged Shakespeare's \"Love's Labor Lost.\" On June 20th, a class of twenty-eight re- ceived diplomas. The class presented the school with a large and handsome koa table and some chairs. Mr. P. C. Jones resigned as treasurer on July 14th, the fortieth anniversary of his election as trustee of Punahou. Later, W. H. Babbitt was elected as treasurer in his place. The new term began Sep. 8th with 200 pupils in the Academic department and 450 in the Preparatory School. In March the Punahou Mothers' Association was organized at the suggestion of Pres. Griffiths, that the homes and school may work together for the good of the boys and girls. The Punahou campus, with its wide stretches of well-kept lawns, its feathery palms and flaming bougainvillea, lends itself so well to all dramatic scenes, that different parts of it were used during the Carnival week in February, for the Hawaiian Pageant, the Sho-Gun, and the great Peace Pageant. That Peace Pageant, written by J. A. Wilder and staged on Alexander Field with 1500 performers by \"The Friend,\" was wonderful. The \"assembling of the na- tions\" as they wound down the paths of Rocky Hill and massed themselves on the terraces, the disappearing statue of \"The Christ of the Andes,\" and the play itself with its costuming and acting were so impressive as to seem a prophetic realization of the time when \"war shall be no more.\" 14 THE ROLL-CALL OF COUSINS. The Family News, which is brought together in this roll-call might be greatly extended if all the Cousins would kindly volunteer to notify us of incidents and changes within their immediate knowl- edge. Alexander (W. P.). — Mr. and Mrs. C. H. Dickey welcomed this year a new grandson, Charles Herbert Dole. A delightful re- ception was given on April 11, 1915, by Mrs. C. H. Dickey, for her sister, Mrs. Guilio Ferreri, here with her husband from Milan, Italy, after an absence of many years. Prof, and Mrs. Ferreri also visited Mrs. Baldwin, on Maui, and on Sep. 9th left for Rome by way of Philadelphia, Prof. Fer- reri being a delegate to the International Child Culture Convention in that city. Mrs. Henry Alexander and others accompanied them to the Coast. On Mrs. Alexander's return in March she presented this society with a koa table, made long ago by Father Emerson. Miss Mary J. Alexander and Mrs. Helen Alexander are in Oakland. W. D. Alexander still writes from Arizona. DeWitt Alexander, sec- ond son of A. C. Alexander, entered Yale University this year, where his brother, Wm. P. Alexander, has been honored by an elec- tion to the Students Council of the Sheffield Science School, and was also chosen editor of the Yale News. He is the author of a Hawaiian play, ', Queen Kapiolani,\" which was presented here in the opera house during Carnival week, and repeated in March. Andrews (L.). — Wm. Andrews, under the firm name of Andrews Engineering Co., 120 Liberty St., N. Y., is prosecuting a money- making business in the metropolis, and is as jolly as ever, if we may judge by his last letter recalling \"boyhood days when Saui Andrews, Allan Judd, John Paty, Billy Hall and myself used to go hunting the elusive ohia, and hear swarms of land-shells in the tops of trees and under the bushes.\" — Mr. Lorrin Andrews occupies a cottage at the seaside, his wife having returned from visiting rela- tives on the Coast. — Lorrin Jr. is at Punahou. — Mrs. Mary C. Nott wrote \"I would love to be with you at the Annual Meeting in the old 'Cooke House.'

She says: \"I am sorry to send this picture of Dr. Shepard — it looks sick and sad. He is indeed a 'man of sorrows and acquaint- ed with grief.' His wonderful sympathy and the breadth of his humanity bring a very heavy strain upon a nature which is natur- ally buoyant. Life is always living in his presence. . . . The sup- port of the Aintab mission has been so inadequate that he has broken his health in trying to meet the financial deficit of educational and medical work. . . . You are quite safe in sending your moneys through the American Board, and I am gratified and grateful that you can send so much. . . . Lorrin Shepard is very much like his father and has the making of a good doctor. He is now study- ing medicine in New York City. Luella wishes to be remembered.\" Armstrong (R.). — Mrs. E. A.

Well, if I may quote some lines of my own in \"The Century Maga- zine ' ' I heard them say the riper years are best— I find it true ; But ah, they have one fault— They are so few. 19 With sincere aloha, yours — Titus Munson Coan.\" In answer to the question concerning the 153 original members, 52 are with us while 101 have gone to attend the greater reunion.

I have a good saddle-horse for long trips but if it isn't too far I prefer my own feet. My work has been extended this year. I go about fifteen miles up the river, stopping at Indian houses here and there along the way. I stay over night at the little town of Stites.

OBITUARIES. The \"Reaper\" in his \"harvest home\" this year has garnered richly of ripened sheaves, taking of the first generation of Cousins eighteen members. Two also of the second generation, and two lit- tle ones of the third were gathered home. Dr. Albert Barnes Clark died in Hilo, Hawaii, June 30, 1914. Albert B. Clark, born at Wailuku, Maui, July 7, 1845, was the son of Rev. E. W. Clark and the youngest of eight children. After completing his course at Punahou school, 1863, he spent five years with his brother-in-law, S. L. Austin, conducting and developing the Onomea sugar plantation. Leaving Onomea in 1868 he went to Chicago, studied dentistry and entered upon his life's career as a successful dentist. While in Chicago he was president of both the Illinois State Dental Society and the Chicago Dental Society. He served as elder in the Third Presbyterian church of Chicago for twelve or more years, being a faithful and efficient co-laborer with the pastor. He married, in 1872, Miss Sara Hamlin, with whom he spent about forty years of happy married life. In 1901 he returned with his family to Hawaii, settling in Honolulu. Prom this time Dr. Clark entered with heart and soul into the life of the Cousins' Society. He knew what the Society meant to the absent Cousins, and he had a vision of what it should mean to the descendants here when once they had for it a home of its own, a place in which to store their precious reports and mementoes of the early days. He felt that the descendants owe it to Fathers and Mothers to have such a home, and when he was made president of the Society he worked to this end. Possessed as he was with a bright, cheerful disposition and unusual conversational powers, he led in the transformation of the Cousins' Society into a memorial society. He was instrumental in having the Recorder's office cre- ated, and the Missionaries' Record of Genealogies begun. The \"Big Book\" was the darling of his heart, and shortly before he left us, he said while turning the leaves with loving hands, \"This is a book of inestimable value.\" No one was more pleased than he over the ALBERT BARNES CLARK, D. D. S. 37 gift to the Society of the Old Mission Home, from our esteemed cousin, C. M. Cooke, and he never gave up the idea of owning the Chamberlain House. When that, too, came as a gift, from the Cooke brothers, his energies were directed to its refitting for the uses of the Society. The placing of the Society under the management of the younger generation was another plan whose accomplishment he labored for, and the splendid efficiency of these younger members as officers seemed to inspire in him great confidence in the success of its future. Dr. Clark's beloved wife was laid to rest in 1908, but he leaves behind him a son, two daughters with their families, and three sis- ters, to mourn his loss. Warren Chamberlain died at the home of his son W. W. Cham- berlain, on Dec. 9, 1914, aged eighty-five years, and his body was laid to rest in Kawaiahao cemetery after a beautiful service con- ducted by Rev. A. A. Ebersole in the old stone church. Warren Chamberlain was born July 17, 1829, in a grass house in Honolulu, and in April of 1832 moved with his parents into the large coral house now called the Chamberlain House. He was the eldest son of Levi Chamberlain, Secular Agent of the Hawaiian Mis- sion, and in 1836, at the age of seven years, he and a younger brother were sent in a whaling ship around Cape Horn to New Lon- don, Conn. In 1841 he entered Williston Semiary, East Hampton, at its commencement, which school he attended for some years. Probably early approaching deafness influenced him in the choice of a course in agriculture, and he returned to Hawaii in 1850 an educated farmer. He bought land in Waialua and engaged in agri- culture and grazing till 1867, being the pioneer sugar planter there. After leaving Waialua he was Superintendent of Grounds at Puna- hou, taking charge of the boys in their outdoor lessons, as Mr. Rice, his predecessor, had done. In 1870 he entered the Statistical Bureau of the Custom House in Honolulu, where he served faithfully for thirty years, retiring in 1900, at the age of seventy-one years. He was married in 1854 to Miss Celia P. Wright, a devoted wife who preceded him to the better land in 1907. He was a good hus- band, a kind and loving father and a true, unselfish friend. He was a charter member of the 2nd Foreign Church, afterward called Fort St. Church, organized in 1851, and in 1866 was one of a committee of five to petition for a charter for Central Union Church. He was one of the original members of the Cousins' Society, contributed to the Maile Wreath, and in his eighty-first year wrote for the Annual Report of 1910 a very valuable paper entitled, \"Incidents and re- 38 membrances connected with the Chamberlain House.\" David Brainard Lyman died in Chicago, 111., April 8, 1914. David Brainard Lyman was born in Hilo, Hawaii, March 27, 1840. He attended Punahou school from 1852-1859. In 1860 he went to ''The States\" and was at the front in the Civil War, for a time, as agent of the Sanitary Commission. In 1865 he was study- ing law in Cambridge, Mass. He married, in 1870, Miss Mary Cos- sitt, with whom there existed a thorough understanding and bond of sympathy, and who accompanied him on his only and delightful visit to his island home in 1910, fifty years after he left it. Mr. Lyman practiced law in Chicago, but built a home in the suburbs which he helped to develop and beautify till it became the charming city of La Grange. Mr. and Mrs. Lyman were members of the Episcopal church of La Grange for which he provided an altar in memory of Father and Mother Lyman. As one of the greatest pleasures of his life was the getting of supplies for the Easter serv- ice, it was fitting that he should pass from this employment to the greater celebration above. On the morning of Good Friday, April 8, he rose early, walked about the village, ate a good breakfast and took the 8 :14 train to Chicago. On the train and at the station he talked with friends, and seemed in a very happy mood. He walked from the train for his office by way of a church-supply house and ordered candles for the Easter service, and while the clerk was ab- sent the body of Mr. Lyman slipped to the floor while he himself left to celebrate the resurrection of his Savior in heaven. His friends rejoice that without an instant's pain his going was so hap- py and triumphant. He leaves, besides his wife, a son and daugh- ter, two brothers and a sister. Curtis Jere Lyons, called to his rest, September 24th, 1914, aged 81 years. We can only rejoice with our friend and brother, Curtis J. Lyons, that after so many years of feebleness and waiting, God per- mitted him through \"A Great Light\" to enter into the Heavenly Home, Sept. 24th, 1914. We are privileged to present to the Cousins the following lov- ing tribute to Mr. Lyons' personal worth and the respect in which he was held by this community, from the pen of the one who knew him best: \"Curtis Jere Lyons was a man of the greatest integrity and honor, and commanded the respect of all who knew him. Large- hearted and sympathetic, he was generous to a fault, and of his 39 somewhat limited means he gave freely to those in need, and to the spread of the Gospel. \"His tastes were pre-eminently literary and scientific. Broad- minded and liberal, he was thoroughly interested in all the topics and questions of the day. In addition to the work of the Survey Department and the Weather Bureau, to both of which he was deeply attached, and which were very congenial to him, he found time in his leisure moments to pen numerous magazine and newspaper ar- ticles upon a great variety of subjects, political, scientific, religious, educational and historical, besides many addresses and essays of all kinds to be read before the various literary, religious, scientific and social organizations with wThich he was connected. In his prime he was one of the best-known and most highly respected men of this island community. \"He had an affectionate and lovable disposition, and while not lacking in true and manly courage, he was mild, gentle, kind, and forgiving. Having a deeply religious and conscientious nature, he was actuated in all he did and said by a sense of right and duty. \"His departure, after eleven years of semi-helpless invalidism, was not wholly unexpected, as he had been gradually failing for a long time. His last words, spoken with much difficulty, were: 'A great Light! A great Light!' 'Victory over death!' And as he passed through the gates into the City, his listening family caught the last whispered word, 'Jesus!' The example of his beautiful Christian life, and the inspiration of his triumph over death are a most precious legacy to his family.\" Miss Fidelia M. Lyons, well known to kamaainas, especially on Hawaii, passed away quietly on the morning of Nov. 13, 1914. The earthly remains were laid to rest in Kawaiahao Mission cemetery the next afternoon, after a simple but beautiful service at which Rev. A. A. Ebersole officiated. Hymns translated by Miss Lyons' father were sweetly sung in Hawaiian by a trio from the Kawaiahao Church choir, a fitting tribute to the departed one's love for Hawaii nei which was evinced in one of her very last con- versations. Miss Lyons was the daughter of the Rev. Lorenzo Lyons, once known as \"The lyric poet of Hawaii.\" She was born at Waimea, Hawaii, Sep. 4, 1839, and passed most of her life in that village. There she and her sister continued, to some extent, the missionary labors that had so endeared their parents to the Hawaiians. As a young girl she attended Punahou School, many present residents of Honolulu being among her schoolmates. Ten years ago 40 failing health caused her to leave Waimea for Honolulu, where she has since resided. Hers was a simple, uneventful Christian life, characterized always by the strong but childlike faith that was her blessed heritage. She was uncomplaining through years of lonely seclusion and subsequent years of invalidism. Even in her last hours she showed consideration for those who cared for her rather than for herself. — Miss Lyons was a sister of Dr. A. B. Lyons of Detroit, Michigan, the late Prof. Curtis J. Lyons of Honolulu, and the late Mrs. Joseph Hay of Myrtle Point, Oregon. (From' 'The Friend.\") William Harvey Rogers, second son of the missionary printer, Edmund Horton Kogers, was born Jan. 7 ,1841, at Honolulu, and died May 17, 1914, at Oakland, Calif. His early life was connected with the \" Mission\" in Honolulu; first in the Rogers cottage on Printers' Lane, afterwards more widely known as \"William Gu- lick's School,\" and when his mother became a widow, in the Di- mond house, which stood on what is now the front lawn of the Library of Hawaii. His schooling was at Punahou under the Dole- Rice regime, and at the Royal School and Oahu College under Mr. E. G. Beckwith. He was never robust of body, and his mind devel- oped in a facility for poetic expression. In the Oahu College Rhe- toricals, May 29, 1862, Harvey read a lengthy poem of his own, entitled, \"The Voyage of Life,\" which was incited by a series of famous paintings, grouped under that name, by Thomas Cole, the American artist, and better known to the world at large, Honolulu included, by steel-engraved copies. A local paper printed the poem just after it was read. Like others having his temperament, Harvey passed through periods of great depression, which alternated with others of elation; but normally he was fond of good company and ready to do his share in keeping it up. He was an expert candy- maker, and his handiwork rivaled the best imported. The writer remembers a bit of his life when he was boss of the Haleakala Boys' School dairy. Eight people, by a fortuitous concur rence, sought shelter for the night in \"The Cave,\" near the top of the great mountain — Bishop Willis of Honolulu and his traveling companion ; Mrs. R. P. Thomas and daughter of Oakland, Cal. ; a gentleman and his wife from Wailuku; and two of us from Maka- wao. Fleas, the hard floor, a smoky fire, and cold, conspired to make sleep a mere pretense, but the memory of that ten hours might be filed away under the title, \"A Merry Night in Ten Acts,\" with Harvey Rogers and the California girl in the leading parts. W. H. Rogers was married, Aug. 19, 1888, to Marie A. Souza, at 41 Papaikou, Hawaii ; and all of the nine children born to them except the youngest can claim Pepeekeo, in Hilo, as their native heath, for there was their father manager of the plantation store for many years. After transplanting his family to California soil, about seven years ago, Mr. Rogers suffered financial loss, and this reverse was followed by partial paralysis which by degrees reduced him to almost entire helplessness. But though his body was racked with pain, his mind was bright, and at intervals he made poetic compo- sition his recreation. Old friends lightened the weight of his last years by their sym- pathy and kind ministrations — Rev. James M. Alexander, Mrs. Mary E. Nott, Mrs. Emily A. Baldwin, Mrs. Martha C. Alexander and his brothers of the Masonic Order — and he died in full Christian faith. R. W. A. Mrs. Ann Maria Stangenwald died in Honolulu, Aug. 13, 1914. Mrs. Stangenwald was the second daughter of Henry Dimond and Ann Maria Dimond, his wife. Her parents came to Hawaii in the same ship with the Rev. Titus Coan and wife, Mr. and Mrs. E. 0. Hall and others. More than forty years ago she married Dr. Hugo Stangenwald and was a most faithful and devoted wife. As a neighbor she most certainly fulfilled the \"royal law.\" Her never- failing kindness and thoughtfulness, so quietly and unobtrusively bestowed, cannot be forgotten. She loved flowers and tended her garden with loving faithfulness, that she might have them to send to her friends in joy or sorrow, and often a growing plant which she had carefully tended formed her Christmas greeting to a friend. She had no children of her own, but \"Aunt Annie\" is a name full of sweetness to the large circle of young people who loved her. Unselfish devotion and cheerful patience were chief characteristics of this noble woman. \"She has gone to her crowning,\" and her crown is well won. E. V. C. H. Mrs. Sarah Elizabeth (Johnson) Williams died at Twin Lakes, Santa Cruz, Cal., on Jan. 1, 1915. Elizabeth Johnson, born at Waioli, Kauai, Dec. 30, 1837, was the daughter of Rev. and Mrs. Edward Johnson, who arrived on the barque Mary Frazier in 1837. They were stationed on Kauai, and beautiful Waioli left its impress on the quiet, poetic, peace-loving temperament of little Lizzie Johnson. Early lessons from her moth- er and nine years of painstaking devotion to studies at Punahou fit- ted her for life. She went to California in 1862 and remained there some years, but in 1868 she was again in Honolulu as Miss Bingham's first assistant at Kawaiahao Seminary. Miss Johnson was married 42 in 1872 to Mr. G. C. \"Williams, and they lived happily many years on the Kohala plantation, moving to the Spreckelsville, Maui, plan- tation in 1882. Here she made a delightful hostess and an ideal home-keeper, anticipating her husband's every wish, ruling her ser- vants by love, and beautifying her home and grounds with flowers, shrubbery and trees. Because of failing health Mr. Williams left the plantation in 1888 and went to California from whence they never returned, as Mr. \"Williams died in 1891. Mrs. Williams and her sister, Mrs. D. K. Fyfe, have since made their home at Twin Lakes, Santa Cruz Co., Cal. For some months her health has been failing, and on Jan. 1, 1915, her spirit passed peacefully to her heavenly home. With the above eight sons and daughters of the Missionaries who have gone to the great reunion, were also two grandchildren. Paul Findley De La Vergne, son of Col. George De La Vergne and the late Emily Dole Rice De La Vargne, was born in Clinton,. Missouri, Dec. 11, 1870. Later on his parents moved to Colorado Springs, where he met Clara Kennedy, whom he afterward married. This union was blessed by a son and daughter, Paul and Marjorie. Soon after his marriage he returned to the Islands and was in the employ of Lew- ers & Cooke, in which position he was greatly esteemed, but which he was forced to relinquish owing to the ill health of his .wife. Re- turning to Los Angeles he engaged in real estate business, was known as a man of honor and integrity, and made many friends. During his residence in Los Angeles he made one or two trips to the Islands which he looked upon as home, and one of his greatest longings toward the close of his life was to visit them once more. He had a keen sense of humor which tided him over many a hard place and made his companionship delightful. For two or more years before his death, while suffering from pulmonary trouble, and while going from place to place in search of health, his patience and cheerfulness were an inspiration to his many friends. Not long before the end, in conversation with his father, he expressed him- self as satisfied with God's will. He passed away April 11, 1914. The funeral took place Apr. 12, at 10 a. m., conducted by Rev. Shaw and Rev. Fisher — a most comforting service. His body was laid away in Rosedale Cemetery, beside that of his beloved mother. M. W. R. Jared Knapp Baldwin, the son of Henry A. Baldwin, died June 27, 1914, at Paia, Maui. 43 He was born at Hamakuapoko, Oct. 4, 1899, and was a boy of promise and greatly loved. He had been attending Hitchcock's Military Academy at San Rafael, Calif., and was home for his sum- mer vacation. Though he had been ill during the year, his friends were not prepared for the sudden closing of the gate between them and their loved one, and for a time they could only cry, 1 ' The Beautiful Gate of Sleep is barred, O, angel within!
