        "text": "Those to be scene and heard\n\nGuys of plus years are still going good. George Hamilton at West 56th’s Carnegie Club. Smoking cigars. Arrives, gives his credit card, says: “Add 25% for the staff and never bring me a check.”\n\nTom Brady. Says he’s “unroastable.” Kevin Hart and roastmaster Jeff Ross disagree. Netflix Is a Joke Fest’s “The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady” streams live Sunday, 8 p.m. EST from LA.\n\nNewly divorced Gisele Bündchen, after 13 years Brady’s wife, maybe didn’t find him fall-down hilarious. Forget that he did good touchdowns.\n\nA David Arquette quote: “Sharing your movies with children or people you don’t know is difficult. You have to say it’s make-believe and that daddy really loves mommy and that this scene kissing is not real. I guess there’s guidelines but I have to ask other actors how they cope with that.”\n\nRon Howard wanted a doc about Jim Henson. Family footage not seen before. “Jim Henson Idea Man” is first at Cannes Film Festival. Then your living room.\n\nRon: “I didn’t know where his ‘outlier’ mentality came from. Driven to get his work out there. His creativity never stopped. The ability dazzled me.” It’s May 31 on Disney+. Miss Piggy will even oink enthusiasm.\n\nAnd a Tony Bennett watercolor of Central Park just sold for $3,900.\n\nSpeaking of great old guys, “The Great Gatsby” at the Broadway Theatre has the best scenic design ever ever. Ever. The creator’s name almost eclipses his sets. It’s Paul Tate ­dePoo, the Third.\n\nSchool of ire learning\n\nCanning antisemitic, anti-Israel protesters swiftly, Google began a template for academia by showing strength and leadership.\n\nBut rat-size brains in academia’s big world continue negotiation with the antisemites, plus they pledge not to call cops again. It signals other campuses to push for the same.\n\nColumbia — a core of the problem — encourages students. Claims their rights were violated. Forget the four R’s: reading, writing, ’rithmetic and race. Today’s curriculum is hate and antisemitism.\n\nAcademia’s become a major American culture problem for years and now we have a whole generation of grads with zero idea of history or reality and 100% know-how of hate.\n\nAnother latent issue is why these schools major in left-wing professors. Why? Because they’re tenured? Never have to work or sweat to bring in a dime? Why?\n\nIn a safe house\n\nGiven today’s crime surge I’m asked who to call, hire, trust in terms of protecting an event. I know many services.\n\nHowever, at a recent party my six-man team — ex-military men, ex-police officers — was from Roger Akiki’s Preferred Security & Investigations.\n\nI once had an evening for Imelda Marcos, then-first lady of the Philippines. Hers was a high-level guest list. Suddenly a South American ambassador’s pocket began to ring. And continued ringing. It was my small bejeweled bedroom alarm clock.\n\nI know about booking security.\n\nIn Washington everyone’s on the lookout for white powder. Upon hearing this, Hunter said: “Don’t look at me. I haven’t touched the stuff all day.”\n\nNot even in New York — only in DC, kids, only in DC."
