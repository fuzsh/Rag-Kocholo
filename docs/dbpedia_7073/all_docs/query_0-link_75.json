He lived, I think, by example. To show other people how to be by who you are.\"\n\n-Jerry Nelson\n\nJim was a gentle leader, he never yelled at his employes.\n\n“Jim inspired people to be better than they thought they could be. …And he did it all without raising his voice.”\n\n-Bernie Brillstein\n\nJim was a natural leader.\n\n\"I can say this about Jim and me,\" she said finally. \"He is totally a natural leader. And I am absolutely a follower. I really am. I'm pretty good at allowing things to happen when they're supposed to rather than being leader. But Jim was always a leader. Always.\"\n\n-Jane Henson\n\nJim was a fearless leader.\n\n\"We called Jim Henson \"fearless leader\" and there was a reason for that. Because Jim would try all kinds of things and he was not afraid to try something new, and if he could see it happening in his mind's eye and knew that it would work, he would dog it until it worked ... I think we always wanted to give Jim exactly what he was looking for.\"\n\n-Jerry Nelson\n\nJim never demanded more work than he was willing to give to the project.\n\n\"Jim was always famous for saying simple is good but then he would turn around and make the most complex scene and wipe us all out trying to do it, including himself.\"\n\n-Jerry Juhl\n\nJim respected the ideas of his\n\nco-workers.\n\n\"People say to me what was it like working for Jim Henson and I always correct them and say \"you don't work for Jim Henson you work with Jim Henson.\"\n\n-Martin Barker"
