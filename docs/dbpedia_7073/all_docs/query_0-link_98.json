        "text": "Jim Henson was a visionary artist, someone who brightened the world with his creations and stories. His creative mind breathed life into Sesame Street, The Muppets, Labyrinth, and The Dark Crystal. Henson shaped many a childhood with his joyful spirit. A new Disney+ documentary from director Ron Howard will look back at Henson’s career and home life. The trailer for Jim Henson Idea Man promises an intimate glimpse into Henson’s history, and it’s making us feel all the feelings—especially with its blatant use of “Rainbow Connection” to compromise our hearts (in the best way).\n\nSince the trailer puts us on the verge of tears, we know we’ll need tissues when we watch the documentary. The documentary trailer promises conversations with Henson’s family and long-time collaborators such as the inimitable Frank Oz and even Labyrinth‘s Jennifer Connelly. Howard made Jim Henson Idea Man with the full participation and cooperation of the Henson family. That means the footage will include never-before-seen personal archival home movies, photographs, sketches, and Henson’s personal diaries. Now if Disney can only release a book to go with the documentary!\n\nIt seems like this documentary is going to be an in-depth and inspiring look at an iconic person who was taken from the world too soon. Henson passed in 1990 at only 53 years old. We’re sure Jim Henson Idea Man will only encourage others to pursue their passions and add more positivity and joy to the world. Goodness knows the world could use it.\n\nThe original documentary from Disney Branded Television is produced by Imagine Documentaries. Howard also serves as a producer alongside Brian Grazer, Sara Bernstein, Margaret Bodde, Justin Wilkes, Mark Monroe, and Christopher St. John. Paul Crowder, Meredith Kaulfers, and Michael Rosenberg serve as executive producers."
