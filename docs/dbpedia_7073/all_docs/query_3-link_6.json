It is the first Kermit puppet, and it is made from Jim Henson’s mother’s old spring coat and a pair of Jim’s blue jeans. Henson used ping pong balls for the eyes. Kermit started as a lizard-like character and evolved into a frog over time. A newer version of this Kermit that was a brighter green color began to be used in 1963 when color television became more common. Subtle changes to his collar and feet were made as newer versions of Kermit were created, but the Kermit we recognize today has not really changed since 1973. When creating Kermit, Jim Henson wanted a puppet that was more capable of expression than those made with harder materials. There is no stuffing in Kermit’s head, meaning the puppeteer’s hand is the only thing inside. This allows for every subtle movement of the puppeteer’s fingers to become a subtle expression change in Kermit.\n\nDescription (Brief)"
