He was passionate about education, the environment, world peace and the arts.\n\nHe used his Muppet friends to raise awareness of issues close to his heart, and created the Jim Henson Foundation in 1982 to promote and develop puppetry in the United States.\n\nAfter his death, his wife set up the nonprofit organization Jim Henson Legacy, which is dedicated to preserving and perpetuating Jim Hensonâ€™s contributions to the worlds of puppetry, television, motion pictures, special effects and media technology."
