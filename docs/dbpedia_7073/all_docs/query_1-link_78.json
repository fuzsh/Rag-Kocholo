        "text": "From the creative mind of puppeteer and filmmaker Jim Henson, children were treated to a new way of learning through “Sesame Street.” At the same time, grown-ups could not stop laughing over the irreverent comedy of “The Muppet Show.” Academy Award-winning producer and director Ron Howard has created “Jim Henson Idea Man,” an engaging documentary that does not disappoint, now streaming Disney+.\n\nHoward incorporates items from Henson’s personal archives that show how he developed his productions. Included are many detailed interviews with Henson’s family and colleagues, particularly Frank Oz, a puppeteer, filmmaker, and actor.\n\nOz, an award-winning filmmaker and Henson were joined at the hip as they scripted projects and designed puppets. Their puppets delivered lines that were poignant, funny, and stinging as acted out by the minds and motions of puppeteers. Oz saw how unique Henson was in his approach.\n\n“It took about 10 years before we could sense each other’s rhythm,” said Oz, who was with Henson for 35 years. “Jim created out of innocence. He was a very rare creature.”\n\nHenson’s DMV Connection\n\nHenson’s family moved to College Park, Maryland, and Henson attended the University of Maryland, where he met his soon-to-be wife Jane Nebel Henson. After graduating, Henson and Jane developed and performed on a daily five-minute show with puppets called “Sam and Friends” on WRC-TV, now known as NBC Washington. Henson’s most cherished character, Kermit the Frog, evolved through the show.\n\nWhat is seen in the documentary is that Kermit represents Henson’s heart.\n\nHenson and Jane married and had five children, but the growing family strained the marriage. Jane was just as creative as her husband but stayed home to raise the children. Henson spent most of his time developing his craft. Henson was happiest at work and not at home.\n\n“When you’re running a several hundred-person unit, you have to keep everybody else enthusiastic,” said Henson, in the film. “You can’t really express grave doubts about whether or not this thing is a good idea or not.”\n\nA running theme throughout “Jim Henson Idea Man” is how hard this man worked, often neglecting his health. Some of his colleagues and family felt that Henson was motivated by the death of his older brother Paul at age 24 in a car crash. Henson was five years younger than his brother, and Paul was his best friend. Henson wanted to stretch and get everything in.\n\nThis documentary shows the trajectory of Henson’s career through every milestone. From Sesame Street to Saturday Night Live to The Muppet Show- to full-length feature films. The University of Maryland has designated Henson’s birth date of September 24 as “Jim Henson Day.”\n\nThe university uses Henson’s own words to explain his desired impact: “When I was young, my ambition was to be one of the people who made a difference in this world. My hope is to leave the world a little better for having been there.”"
