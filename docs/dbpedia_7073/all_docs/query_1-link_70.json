        "text": "The Visual and Performing Arts program at Northwestern is a pre-professional, four-year arts program offering talented high school students educational opportunities designed to prepare them artistically for college, professional study, or career options in the arts in the 21st century.\n\nOur curriculum is designed to foster creativity and personal expression.\n\nOur Beloved Alumni\n\nJim Henson was born James Maury Henson on September 24, 1936, in Greenville, Mississippi. At a young age, Henson was drawn to the arts. His maternal grandmother, a painter, quilter, and needleworker, encouraged his creative passions, including puppetry. Well before his teen years, Henson performed puppetry for audiences, including his fellow Cub Scouts. His youth was also spent toying with different visual mediums, including television, which he adored. A significant influence on his childhood was TV puppeteer Burr Tillstrom, of the show Kukla, Fran, and Ollie.\n\nHe attended Northwestern High School after moving to Hyattsville and graduated in 1954. He then went on to study at the University of Maryland"
