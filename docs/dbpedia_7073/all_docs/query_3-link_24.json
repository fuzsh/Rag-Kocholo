        "text": "K is for KERMIT!\n\nReally, what else could K stand for but Kermit?!\n\nWhen you ask who is our most famous alumnus/alumna, the most frequent answer you receive is Jim Henson, creator of the world-renowned and much-beloved Muppets. The best-known of Jim’s characters is Kermit the Frog, although Miss Piggy might give you an argument there…Jim created Kermit from an old coat of his mother’s and two ping-pong balls while he was still a student at the University of Maryland. He started his fabulous frog on the road to stardom with appearances on the local television show “Sam and Friends,” which Jim created on WRC-TV, the NBC affiliate in Washington, DC.\n\nTheir partnership is immortalized in a bronze statue of the two of them in conversation by Jay Hall Carpenter at the west end of the Stamp Student Union along Campus Drive. This special piece was a gift of the Classes of 1994, 1998, and 1999, and was dedicated on September 24, 2003, on what would have been Jim Henson’s 67th birthday. Jim and Kermit are surrounded by a lovely garden, and this entire spot has become a favorite place for campus photo ops.\n\nOddly enough this is not the only place that “Kermit” appears on campus. His name is carved into the capstone of the parapet wall on the left side of the stairs to the entrance to the Kent Hall dormitory on South Hill. This appearance is quite mysterious, however, since Jim Henson never stayed in this dorm. His family lived in University Park, just south of campus, so there was no reason for him to incur the added expense of dormitory life during his undergraduate days as a home economics major. Who added this carving to Kent Hall and when is unknown.\n\nThis is the 11th post in our series on Terrapin Tales called ABC’s of UMD! Posts will come out twice a week, on Mondays and Fridays, throughout the semester. If you want to learn more about campus history, check back weekly to see what we’ve picked to highlight, and you can also visit our encyclopedia University of Maryland A to Z: MAC to Millennium for more UMD facts.\n\nDo you have other ABC’s about campus? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nTake a quick guess and click here for Letter L!\n\nWithout Jim Henson, there would be no Muppets, no Fraggle Rock, and the magical world of Sesame Street would be quite different. As a pioneer in his industry, Henson’s unique style brought a brand new element to television. His accomplishments at the University of Maryland and beyond make him one of the university’s most distinguished alumni.\n\nFollowing his death in May of 1990, the University of Maryland commemorated the life of Jim Henson during the Homecoming football game on October 13, 1990. Henson’s wife, Jane, accepted a painted drum head on his behalf and also served as the Homecoming grand marshal, an honor bestowed on her husband 11 years prior. 27,000 spectators were on-hand in Byrd Stadium to witness the event.\n\nThe focus of that special weekend was reviving a little bit of Henson’s magic and remembering his best work. With the help of Jim Henson Productions, the event featured life sized versions of some of Henson’s most popular characters, including Kermit, Miss Piggy, and the Cookie Monster, dancing to familiar Sesame Street tunes.\n\nMrs. Henson, who was delighted with the turnout and response to the event, explained, “The campus has always been very responsive to Jim and his work…They’ve always considered him an alumnus to be proud of.” When asked about her late husband’s legacy, Jane added, “He touched so many people’s lives that I think the real loss will be felt by his audiences.”"
