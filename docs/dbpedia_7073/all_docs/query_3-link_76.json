        "text": "and I'm a puppeteer.\n\nHe just kept wanting to push the boundaries of what was miraculous and magical and real.\n\n(HENSON SPEAKING) -I want one that fits.\n\n-(CHUCKLES) Is this the best you can do?\n\nNARRATOR: He was an artist of boundless talent and imagination.\n\nJim was someone of terrific curiosity, ambition and drive.\n\nHe was always going.\n\nHe was always working.\n\nHe was always on.\n\nHelp!\n\nI was undoubtedly a great deal more comfortable... (HENSON SPEAKING) Hi-yah!\n\nNARRATOR: Jim Henson's Muppets won the hearts of fans around the world.\n\nHe created a family of unforgettable characters.\n\nNARRATOR: Yet, while the Muppets were beloved by millions, their visionary creator felt restless and confined.\n\nJim had to fight against this stereotype of, \"Muppets are children's things.\"\n\nHe had to fight that battle constantly.\n\nHis idea was always to be more experimental as a filmmaker.\n\nThat's what he wanted to do.\n\nNARRATOR: Henson's soaring artistic ambition drove him to pioneering work on the big screen.\n\nJim's focus became more and more on movies.\n\nNARRATOR: Then, on the verge of a bold, new creative partnership... His life was cut short.\n\nI was just in shock, in shock.\n\nHow?\n\nYou know, what?\n\nWhat?\n\nHow?\n\nThis is like, \"Whoa!\n\nThe center of our universe is no longer there.\n\n\"What's going to happen.\"\n\nFRANK OZ: What once was can never be again.\n\nIt was a Camelot time for us with Jim.\n\n(HENSON SPEAKING) NARRATOR: This is the story of Jim Henson.\n\n(APPLAUSE) Thank you!\n\nThank you!\n\nHey, listen, it's another great show, folks.\n\nNARRATOR: With the blockbuster premiere of The Muppet Show in 1976, Jim Henson finally achieves his dream of prime time Muppet success.\n\n-Piggy, honey?\n\n-Hmm?\n\n-You can take the solo.\n\n-Yes, my love.\n\n-Here are the Muppets.\n\n-(AUDIENCE APPLAUSE) Hey, what are you doin'?\n\nOh, I'm taking a course on visual thinking.\n\nIt teaches you how to visualize your thoughts.\n\nWatch.\n\nQ!\n\nNARRATOR: That dream began during the early years of television.\n\n-Watch!\n\n-Hey, a real watch.\n\nAs he brought a hip cutting-edge humor to a new medium.\n\n(VOCALIZING) Gee, I see.\n\nThe Muppets were not Sesame Street.\n\nThey really did have deep, deep roots in early television, in that kind of off-the-wall, brilliant comedy.\n\nWhat are the symbols for?\n\n(CLANGING) This is a very symbolic commercial.\n\nJim was so innovative in television and was in early television, and was such a presence in variety.\n\nThe Muppet characters really paid their dues.\n\n-Cheese.\n\n-(CAMERA CLICKING) Got that?\n\nHe created a family of unforgettable characters.\n\nWith real feelings and real problems that audiences could identify with, that children could identify with, and grownups could identify with.\n\n♪ Who said that every wish ♪ Would be heard and answered ♪ When wished on the morning star?\n\nNARRATOR: Among those characters was a quirky green frog with whom Jim Henson became most identified.\n\n♪ Look what it's done so far WILLARD SCOTT: Kermit was Jim's soul.\n\nWhen you heard Kermit speak, that was from Jim's heart.\n\n♪ What's so amazing that keeps us star gazing All you have to do is, uh, look at Kermit the Frog.\n\nYou know, that's Jim Henson.\n\nHe was a little frog growing up in a small-town swamp.\n\nAnd he had a dream of making millions of people happy, so he gathered up his friends and went to Hollywood.\n\nAnd then he shared that dream with other people.\n\nAnd it got bigger, the more he shared it with.\n\n♪ Someday we'll find it, ♪ The rainbow connection ♪ The lovers, the dreamers and me♪ NARRATOR: Jim Henson's fertile imagination was cultivated in the farmland of rural Mississippi.\n\nBRIAN JONES: Jim always called himself a Mississippi Tom Sawyer, talked about shooting water moccasins with his BB gun, sort of had this quiet, country upbringing.\n\nNARRATOR: Born in 1936, he spent his boyhood in tiny Stoneville, with his older brother Paul and his parents, Paul and Betty Henson.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture had a big plant and that's who his father worked for.\n\nNARRATOR: Stoneville isn't far from the larger town of Leland, Mississippi which is itself hardly a bustling metropolis.\n\nLeland was about four or five thousand people.\n\nA typical Southern town.\n\nEvery Sunday everything shut down and everybody went to church.\n\nJim was raised Christian Science, his mother was Christian Science, his father wasn't really.\n\nSo Christian Science sort of shaped his thinking a little bit.\n\nNARRATOR: The Church of Christ Scientist emphasizes healing through faith.\n\nAnd while Jim's family will seek medical help for serious injury or illness, they rarely go to a doctor.\n\nHe himself did not practice the religion, but he was very affected by it.\n\nNARRATOR: Jim will avoid seeing doctors for the rest of his life.\n\nAn attitude that will have profound consequences.\n\nNARRATOR: There's little to do for entertainment in Leland, so young Jim finds creative ways to entertain himself.\n\nJim, as a kid, loved to draw.\n\nAnd he had, I think at one point, the idea of being a cartoonist.\n\nHim and his brother were always building something.\n\nThey made model airplanes and you name it.\n\nThey made a little crystal radio that you could actually pick up the nearest radio station.\n\nNARRATOR: Among Jim's radio favorites during wartime in the early 1940s are ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his dummies, Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd.\n\nCharlie and Mortimer are beautifully carved characters in wood.\n\nAnd, it's very shocking that there's no life in their eyes.\n\nAnd yet, when my father was operating them, you thought there was.\n\nJim was very respectful of my father, and he dedicated their first movie to the magic of Edgar Bergen.\n\nNARRATOR: In 1948, Jim's dad is reassigned from Mississippi to Maryland.\n\nSo 12-year-old Jim and his family move to a suburb of Washington, D.C.\n\nUnlike in the rural south, many homes have a rare and wondrous modern appliance... A television.\n\nIn the flickering black & white images, 14-year-old Jim sees his future.\n\nWhat Jim wanted to do more than anything else was work in television.\n\nHe didn't care what it was gonna be that got him through the door.\n\nBONNIE ERICKSON: Jim didn't start out as a puppeteer.\n\nHow he came into it is just miraculous.\n\nNARRATOR: Jim looks for work at local stations, but it's not until his senior year in high school that he finally gets his chance.\n\nJONES: I believe there was a newspaper ad in the Washington newspapers looking for young people to perform marionettes on the local CBS affiliate.\n\nERIKSON: Jim went and got a book, built a couple of puppets, and then went in and got the job.\n\nIt was short lived, but it was the beginning of everything that he did from that time on.\n\nHENSON: It's certainly not a career that one would plan.\n\nYou know, you wouldn't decide to become a puppeteer, I don't think, in your life.\n\nNARRATOR: 17-year-old Jim graduates from high school in June of '54 and makes his first appearance on The Junior Morning Show at WTOP.\n\nFeaturing his very first Muppet, Pierre The French Rat.\n\nJim's soft, expressive Muppets are a revolutionary departure from TV puppet shows of the time, like Kukla, Fran & Ollie.\n\nJONES: Jim didn't want painted faces with mouths that didn't move, like Kukla was that way.\n\nJim wanted mouths that opened, he wanted the eyes to look focused.\n\nHe figured out the Henson triangle, it's the relationship between the eyes and the nose.\n\nThere's a magic triangle.\n\nJim would always make sure that that was something that would focus when a puppet looked to camera.\n\nI love the notion that a piece of felt and two, uh, ping-pong balls, could turn into something that was alive and seemingly mobile.\n\nLANDIS: Jim gave me this great thing about the Muppets.\n\nMost people when they do puppets, they open their mouth like this, like, \"Hello, how are you?\"\n\nHe said, \"Muppets don't speak the words.\n\nThey attack the words.\"\n\nSo a Muppet talks like this because he is attacking the word.\n\nGood night, and good luck.\n\nNobody has ever seen puppets like that, nobody.\n\nThose are completely and utterly new.\n\nNARRATOR: In the summer of '54, Jim works at NBC affiliate, WRC, where he creates new Muppets for Circle 4 Ranch with Cowboy Joe Campbell.\n\nWillard Scott works as a deejay and weatherman at the station.\n\nI met Jim when I was 18, he was 17.\n\nNBC wanted to buy the Muppets.\n\nAnd I gave him some good advice.\n\nI said, \"Jim don't you ever, ever sell these characters.\n\nThey're yours.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Jim and his Muppets are still appearing on WRC in the fall of '54, when he enters the University of Maryland.\n\nThe shy, quiet, gangly 17-year-old takes the only puppetry class offered in the Home Economics department.\n\nCHERYL: It actually was a required course for a lot of the mostly women, um, studying art and art therapy and education in art.\n\nEveryone would gravitate to him because he already knew how to do puppetry and he was already on television doing puppetry.\n\nNARRATOR: Among those gravitating to Jim is Jane Nebel a 20-year old senior majoring in art and education.\n\nThey really enjoyed working with each other and so they, they started working together.\n\nHe hired her immediately to come work for him and that's how their partnership developed.\n\nCreatively they always got along.\n\nShe had a kind of unerring eye for talent and in a way, Jim Henson was her first discovery.\n\nNARRATOR: Jane joins Jim at WRC in the spring of 1955.\n\nTheir chemistry is immediate.\n\n♪ That old black magic has me in its spell ♪ That old black magic that you weave so well They were young together.\n\nThey were explosive together.\n\nThey had a really wacky sense of humor.\n\n♪ Aflame with such a burning desire♪ SCOTT: They worked behind this curtain.\n\nI always said, \"I don't know what went on behind that curtain.\"\n\nBut... (CHUCKLES) But they ended up getting married and having kids so something went on behind that curtain we didn't all see.\n\n(APPLAUSE) NARRATOR: While still a college freshman living at home in May of '55, Jim creates Sam and Friends for WRC.\n\nSam and Friends!\n\nNARRATOR: Jim and Jane perform five-minute shows twice a day.\n\nHe got to, sort of, create his own show.\n\nDecide what the conceit was.\n\nSam was this sort of vaguely human character who never spoke, and the friends were these abstract figures that may or may not have been inside his head.\n\nWhy don't you just call me Kermit?\n\nJONES: Kermit came out of that cast of Sam and Friends.\n\nBut was sort of a vague, abstract character.\n\nHad his little padded feet, um, didn't have his frog collar.\n\nKermit was built out of Jim's mother's coat, uh, with ping-pong balls for eyes.\n\nHelp!\n\nHelp!\n\nHelp!\n\nNARRATOR: But it's not just Jim's characters that make the Muppets a game-changer in the mid-1950s, it's Jim's use of the TV screen itself.\n\nThe difference between what Jim was doing and something like Kukla, Fran and Ollie is Kukla, Fran and Ollie was a puppet show on television.\n\nWhat Jim realized is if you're on TV, the four sides of the TV screen are your puppet theater.\n\nYou can bring a puppet in from the left, from the right, from the top, from the bottom.\n\nIt immediately expands the universe that puppet lives in.\n\nNARRATOR: Jane graduates from the University of Maryland in the summer of '55, along with Jim's brother, Paul, who joins the Navy.\n\nPaul is stationed in Florida for training as a Navy pilot.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim and Jane's Muppets are a local comedy sensation.\n\nSCOTT: Everybody watched the Muppets in Washington.\n\nIt put a smile on your face and made you happy.\n\nNARRATOR: By 1956, beat poetry, jazz, and rock & roll are shaking up the staid conformity of post-war America.\n\nAnd Jim's Muppets are on the comic cutting-edge.\n\nThere are two young college students, uh, Jim Henson and Jane Nebel.\n\nThey got together and they formed the Muppets.\n\nBlack Bart is coming in on the next stage!\n\nMac, what are you doing under the desk?\n\nNARRATOR: They appear as guests on late night talk and variety shows, playing to a sophisticated adult audience.\n\nMy next move will be your last, Black Bart!\n\nJust try it!\n\nOkay, here it comes.\n\nMy pawn takes your bishop.\n\nCheckmate!\n\nOh, you got me, Marshal.\n\nNARRATOR: But as his professional career is taking off in the spring of '56, Jim suffers a deeply personal loss, when his brother, Paul, dies of injuries suffered in a car accident.\n\nCHERYL: Anytime you're faced with death that life and the time that you have here on this Earth become that much more precious and I do feel like my father felt that this life was precious and that the time that we have is never enough.\n\nAnd he was always making, making, doing, doing, making.\n\nAnd I think there was a sense of wanting to live in the present.\n\nNARRATOR: Jim is indeed making and doing, turning to work to cope with the loss of his brother and adding to his ever-increasing workload.\n\nLet's go up to the surface for some Wilkins Coffee.\n\n-I never touch the stuff.\n\n-(GULPS) You should, it's a whale of a coffee!\n\nNARRATOR: Jim makes his first commercials in 1957 for the Washington, D.C. based Wilkins Coffee Company.\n\nWhen did you have your last cup of Wilkins?\n\nMy last cup wasn't Wilkins.\n\nHe's had his last cup.\n\nOne of the people who was putting together the commercials had seen Sam and Friends, liked it, thought it was hilarious, really wanted to take that sort of mentality and put it into commercials.\n\n-Got your parachute?\n\n-I forgot it.\n\nHow about the Wilkins Coffee?\n\nI forgot that too.\n\nYou'll never forget this.\n\nEverything always ended with an explosion, something really outrageous.\n\nJONES: Once the Wilkins commercials caught on, people selling coffee in Boston and Louisiana wanted the Muppets selling their coffee.\n\nWant some Red Diamond Coffee with your pie?\n\nNo, just give me the pie.\n\nThe numbers for Kraml Milk, once the Muppets started selling it, apparently went through the ceiling.\n\nWant some Kraml Milk with your dinner?\n\nNo, give me some water.\n\nThe commercials are paying the bills.\n\nAnd it really sort of gave him the opportunity to buy his artistic freedom.\n\nNARRATOR: Eager to move forward in his life and career.\n\nJim incorporates his company as Muppets, Inc. And on May 28, 1959 he and Jane are married.\n\nHe said, we're going to build this company and we're going to get married and you know, sort of laid out their agenda for the next decade.\n\nNARRATOR: Jim is a prodigiously successful college senior in 1960, having earned over $100,000 in the past year.\n\nIn May, Jim and Jane's first child, Lisa, is born and later that year, the Muppets make their first appearance on NBC's Today Show.\n\nThey're called Muppets because they're neither puppets nor marionettes but kind of a combination.\n\nI'm honored to be in the studio with two very distinguished NBC newsmen.\n\nFirst we have... Chet Huntley, NBC News, New York.\n\nFrom my very early childhood I remember the feel and the smells and sounds of the puppet workshop.\n\nWell, what would you like me to call you?\n\nChet Huntley.\n\nOh, okay, Chet Huntley.\n\nWe could see the latest appearance on a variety show or Ed Sullivan.\n\nThis program is come to you from... NBC News, New York.\n\nNo, no.\n\nThis program is coming from... NBC News, Washington.\n\nNew York.\n\n-Washington.\n\n-New York.\n\nWashington.\n\nNARRATOR: Flush with early success, Jim drives to his June 1960 college commencement in a Rolls Royce bought with Muppet money.\n\nCHERYL: He had a wife, he had a baby, he owned his own house and he drove that Rolls Royce to his college graduation to pick up his degree in home economics and there you go, he was a self-made man.\n\nI met Jim when I was 17 years old and Jim was in his early 20s.\n\n(CHUCKLES) NARRATOR: In 1960, Jim meets Frank Oznowicz at a puppeteer conference in California.\n\nJim asks him to join his Muppet team, but the teenager is still in high school.\n\nAfter graduation in 1963, Frank Oz begins work at Muppets, Inc.\n\nI remember being in front of a mirror with Jane Henson and Jim teaching me how to do the Muppets lip-sync technique.\n\nI didn't do voices for about four years.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nJim was about to give up on me.\n\nNARRATOR: But he didn't.\n\nTake off that moustache!\n\nTake off that... (GRUNTS) Double... Double-face tape.\n\nTake that tape off.\n\n(GRUNTS) The story of the Muppets is the story of Jim and Frank as this incredible, uh, once in a lifetime comedy duo.\n\nOZ: Jim was the boss, but he was my best friend, too, and I know how devastating his brother's loss was to him.\n\nCHERYL: My dad had an older brother who died and I think that having a younger brother like Frank was just fantastic.\n\nTheir relationship was very much like brothers.\n\nThey're competitive, they're feisty, they're funny... -Get your hand off me.\n\n-(CHUCKLES) It's the sort of relationship that has highs and lows, and you have times when you work very well together and times when, you know, you're slightly brushing against each other.\n\nIt's like a marriage, you have fights sometimes.\n\n(CHUCKLES) But Jim was extraordinary in that we would always allow me to voice my opinion.\n\nI think he should have fired me many times.\n\nHe was extraordinarily patient.\n\n(SCREAMS) Now there was such a closeness that I can't explain.\n\nNARRATOR: Another key team member is puppeteer, Jerry Juhl.\n\nWho takes over for Jane on Sam and Friends when daughter Cheryl is born in August of '61.\n\nCHERYL: Most of my childhood memories with my dad are more about making things and also about telling stories.\n\nNARRATOR: Restless to tell new stories, Jim ends Sam and Friends successful 6-year run in December of '61 to pursue more ambitious projects.\n\nHe tapes the TV special Tales of the Tinkerdee in 1962 and continues to appear on daytime and late-night TV shows.\n\nAll the while, his commercial work flourishes.\n\nTry Purina Dog Chow, right?\n\nRight.\n\nNARRATOR: Jim hires puppetmaker, Don Sahlin, who builds Rowlf the Dog for Purina.\n\nThe first of countless numbers of Muppets Sahlin will build over the next 15 years.\n\nI'm the Muppets big, lovable, shaggy dog, Rowlf on ABC's The Jimmy Dean Show.\n\nNARRATOR: Rowlf joins country music singer Jimmy Dean on his weekly variety show in 1963.\n\n-Where's that other dumbbell?\n\n-Hi!\n\nAnd the Muppets make the jump from late night and morning show guests to prime time TV stars.\n\n-Ready, here we go!\n\n-(BELL DINGS) (GROWLING) Would you cut it out?\n\nRowlf, no bitin'.\n\nNo bitin'?\n\nYou're taking away my best punch.\n\nNARRATOR: With seemingly boundless energy, Jim performs Rowlf every week while directing his expanding empire.\n\nThe Muppets have been seen often on such network shows as Jack Paar, Johnny Carson, Steve Allen Arthur Godfrey, Today, and Al Hirt's Fanfare.\n\nAnd this fall we're gonna do The Hollywood Palace and The Perry Como Christmas Show.\n\nNARRATOR: Amid all the Muppet madness, Jane gives birth to their son Brian in November of '63.\n\nHalf of the time that I saw my dad when I was a young kid, was being at the studios while he was working.\n\nOr being at the workshop while he was building puppets.\n\nHe was always working.\n\nNARRATOR: The mid-1960s are a time of bold experiments in art and movies, and while his Muppet business is booming, Jim is driven to be more than just a popular puppeteer.\n\nJim always loved film.\n\nHe always wanted to do a film.\n\n(COUGHS) He made a film called Time Piece that I saw at the LA County Museum of Art, and I remember going, \"That's Jim Henson!\"\n\n\"That's the puppet Jim Henson.\"\n\nCHERYL: Time Piece is so much my father.\n\nIt is right in where his head was and you watch that and you go \"Okay, that is his autobiography.\"\n\n(GROWLS) (TARZAN YELL) So, if you really want to know about my dad, watch Time Piece.\n\nHelp.\n\nNARRATOR: Time Piece earns an Academy Award nomination for short film in 1965.\n\nBut it's Jim's next project that will change his life.\n\nAnd the lives of generations of children all over the world.\n\nNARRATOR: In 1966, the Carnegie Institute sponsors a study that leads to the formation of the Children's Television Workshop.\n\nThey knew they wanted to do something that kids would respond to, they wanted it to be fast paced, they wanted a children's Laugh-In essentially.\n\nNARRATOR: Led by Joan Ganz Cooney, the Children's Television Workshop is developed amid social and political upheaval.\n\nMartin Luther King was killed, Robert Kennedy was killed, the Vietnam War protests were reaching a crescendo.\n\nIt was a really scary time.\n\nNARRATOR: Director Jon Stone recommends Henson to Ganz Cooney for their new children's TV project, Sesame Street.\n\nJim was very reluctant at first because he was concerned that he would be trapped as a little children's producer.\n\nOZ: His idea was always to be more experimental as a filmmaker, that's what he wanted to do.\n\nWe talked about it, that this is not where he wants to be, with Sesame Street, but he will go with it because he sees value in it and out of that value could come other value.\n\nNARRATOR: So, in 1969, Jim joins the visionary team at Sesame Street.\n\n♪ Sunny day Sweepin' the clouds away♪ NARRATOR: His first Muppet characters for the show are a duo played by Jim and Frank Oz.\n\nI'm never going to eat cookies in my bed again.\n\nBERT: Okay, good.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nI'm gonna eat cookies in your bed, Bert.\n\nErnie and Bert have this funny relationship that has developed over the years.\n\nIt has something to do with Frank and I, I'm sure.\n\nOZ: Bert is not me, Ernie is not Jim, but there's an aspect of Jim in Ernie and an aspect of Bert in me.\n\nAt that time, I was very neurotic and very uptight, so it fit perfectly for Bert.\n\nJim was always playful, so it fit perfectly for Ernie.\n\nFRAN BRILL: The chemistry between them was just fantastic.\n\nThey were a great Abbott and Costello, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, whatever team, they were right up there with all of those guys.\n\nTa-da!\n\n-Ernie.\n\n-Yes?\n\nYou've ruined my whole day!\n\nHi-ho, Kermit the Frog here.\n\nNARRATOR: Other characters are soon brought into play, including a frog who Jim has been operating and voicing since the early 1950s.\n\nJim had a piece with Kermit telling kids what it's like to be a frog.\n\nUh, frogs live in apartment houses with, uh, furniture and televisions sets.\n\nAnd I said, \"Well, Kermit, that's, that's not exactly what all frogs do.\n\n\"I happen to have a Giant American Bullfrog here...\" My goodness.\n\nJim's head happened to be right below where I was holding the bullfrog.\n\n(CROAKING) Mr. Froggie went a-peeing on Jim's head.\n\n(HUMMING) (CROAKS) And I thought for sure he'd say \"cut\" but he finished the piece and then we both looked at each other (LAUGHING) and he was dripping and we had an enormous laugh.\n\nAnd it was a take.\n\nI think Kermit made himself a new friend today.\n\nGetting to know Jim was a really special thing.\n\nHe was so, uh, warm and outgoing and understanding.\n\nHe was not like a boss.\n\nHe told me he wanted me to run two characters.\n\nBig Bird and Oscar the Grouch.\n\nEveryone on Sesame Street is always talking about love.\n\nYuck.\n\nBig Bird is kind of a child who hopes people like him.\n\nOh, it's just silly saying, \"Hi, I'm Big Bird.\"\n\n'Cause people can plainly see that I'm just a big bird.\n\nJim gave me this little pink puppet that already existed.\n\nShe was renamed Prairie Dawn.\n\nThat became the first legitimately female puppet character on Sesame Street.\n\n-Prairie.\n\n-Yes?\n\nWhat kind of cookies are those there?\n\n-Oh, well, Cookie Monster, these are oatmeal cookies.\n\n-(GASPS) We were just really encouraged to go for it.\n\nTo be as silly and idiotic and stupid as you possibly could.\n\n(SHOUTING) Cookies!\n\n(GOBBLING) The show was an overnight success.\n\nThe country and the world had never seen before anything like these Muppets.\n\nJim was very proud, of course of the work that was done on Sesame Street.\n\nBut you could feel him kind of bursting in his quiet Jim \"Hmm\" way to take that energy and move it into other arenas.\n\nI said, \"Trust me, Jim, it's just around the corner, \"you're not gonna be stuck in little kiddie entertainment.\"\n\nThe Ramadar.\n\nNARRATOR: Determined not be pigeonholed by the success of Sesame Street, Jim continues his experimental projects.\n\nHe did shows for NBC, one's called The Cube... Hello.\n\nSort of this avant-garde Twilight Zone- type episode of a man trapped inside a cube and you don't know what's real and you don't know what's not.\n\nI'm still in the cube!\n\nOf course you're in the cube, but you're healthy and happy.\n\nNARRATOR: But while Jim craves new creative outlets, it's the Muppets who are in demand.\n\nBy 1971, Jim is juggling a third season of Sesame Street, guest appearances on prime time variety shows, and a syndicated TV special, Muppet Musicians of Bremen.\n\nIn 1973, the Muppet Valentine special tapes at ABC in New York.\n\nIt's executive Michael Eisner's first project with Jim.\n\nEISNER: There's some people you call and when they answer the phone it's like, \"Oh, I'm so glad you called, \"let's have a conversation.\"\n\nJim Henson was somebody that you always felt wanted to be engaged.\n\nAnd if the conversation turned into something creative it was even better.\n\nThe Muppets Valentine Show!\n\nAnd that was really a pilot in disguise for ABC.\n\nFor a weekly show.\n\nL-O-V-E. Now what can we say about love?\n\nNARRATOR: When Jim's sweet Valentine's special doesn't lead to a weekly series, he takes an edgier approach with his next ABC pilot, striving for that elusive hit formula.\n\nANNOUNCER: Presenting the end of Sex and Violence on television.\n\n-(LOUD EXPLOSION) -(LAUGHING MANIACALLY) I thought the Muppets with a provocative title like that would appeal to an adult audience.\n\nOh, well, uh, I might be able to get you a job on an educational show for kids.\n\n(CLEARS THROAT) That was a much more abstract and a little more unhinged kind of environment and character group.\n\n(GRUNTING) MAN: Oh, no, he bit his own arm!\n\n(GROANING) BRIAN: He called it Sex and Violence to try and tell the audience this is not Sesame Street.\n\n\"Look it's called Sex and Violence\" and still all the networks passed.\n\nI was with Jimmy Dean but nobody remembers me anymore.\n\nHe really wanted to be mainstream television.\n\nThat was his great dream, his great goal all of his life.\n\nAnd, um, it eluded him, uh, again and again and again.\n\nHe had a heck of a time convincing the world to let him do The Muppet Show.\n\nHe felt like Sesame Street had pigeonholed him.\n\nAnd it was frustrating to him.\n\nVery.\n\nNARRATOR: Ever eager to free himself from the stifling confines of children's TV, Jim signs on in 1975 for the launch of a daring new late-night show on NBC.\n\nWhat developed was this \"Land of Gorch,\" um, with the king and his wife and his girlfriend and, uh, his henchmen and the mighty Favog.\n\nNobody had ever seen anything like those characters.\n\nJONES: I remember seeing the first, you know, two or three shows and going, \"What in the heck is this?\"\n\n'Cause I was looking for Kermit and here's something I'd never seen before.\n\nI remember Jim sort of being there and just sort of this island of calm in the sea of chaos of the early days of the show.\n\nNARRATOR: Adding to the chaos, some cast members have problems with Jim's puppets.\n\nJohn Belushi called them the Mucking Fuppets.\n\nAnd they were never really a good fit.\n\nFortunately, what happened was Jim got The Muppet Show right at the end of the first season of Saturday Night Live, so he could leave after that first season, no harm, no foul.\n\nNARRATOR: Jim says goodbye to SNL and hello to legendary British entertainment mogul, Sir Lew Grade.\n\nLew Grade called from London and said to him I've seen your Sex and Violence pilot for The Muppet Show, I think it's fantastic.\n\nBring your people here to London and we'll make it.\n\nComing to England gave him the creative freedom the resources, the financial wherewithal to make the show he wanted to make.\n\nIt's The Muppet Show!\n\nNARRATOR: The show that all the US networks passed on begins taping in London in January of '76.\n\nJim's dream of a Muppet series for all ages is about to be realized.\n\nSay, what's happening?\n\nHi.\n\nNARRATOR: Jim crafts a weekly variety show featuring the Muppets and their human guest stars, presided over by the show's amphibian host and director.\n\nScooter, get those dancers off-stage!\n\nBeauregard, get that scenery offstage!\n\nCome on now, move it!\n\nBAKER: Kermit the Frog was the leader, Kermit the Frog was the guy that the whole show was built around.\n\nLet's hear it for me!\n\nYay!\n\nBut you take Kermit away and you've got very humble Jim underneath it.\n\nKermit's function on the show is very much like my own.\n\nHe's trying to hold together this group of crazies.\n\n(ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) -(SCREAMING) Watch out!\n\n-(GRUNTS) He was able to be controlling and in charge through Kermit in a way that he couldn't ever when he was just being Jim.\n\nIt was just a lot of fun.\n\nA lot of hard work, a lot of fun.\n\nAS MISS PIGGY: Oh, Roger!\n\nBecause, with Jim, hard work and fun are synonymous.\n\nIn order make it look good up there it has to be uncomfortable down here.\n\nThere was a scene where Piggy was supposed to slap Kermit and in rehearsals, I don't know quite why I did it, but instead of slapping him I karate chopped him.\n\n-Hi-yah!\n\n-(SCREAMING) He really chopped and everybody was on the floor laughing and we all knew that this was probably gonna be the life of the pig.\n\nHi-yah!\n\n-Hi-yah!\n\n-Ah!\n\nJim encouraged collaboration something fierce.\n\nLike the janitor could come up and say, \"Hey, wouldn't it be great if Piggy did such and such?\"\n\nAnd if he liked the idea, he would use it.\n\nOZ: He was not about ownership, he was about quality.\n\nYes!\n\nHe was about doing the best job possible.\n\nAnd he valued everybody who worked with him as contributors and not just employees.\n\nI would like to now see, you all starting to march back towards the boat.\n\nYes.\n\nFine.\n\nYou worked with Jim.\n\nYou didn't necessarily work for him.\n\nHe got the best out of people not from screaming and shouting.\n\n-I think it should definitely be night.\n\n-...with fireflies.\n\nYeah, it's moonlight and fireflies.\n\nHe did it in his own gentle way, and because of the way he treated people, he got it back in bucket loads.\n\nYes, he plundered his plundering and he... (ALL LAUGHING) NARRATOR: The Muppet Show premieres on US television in September of '76.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, The Great Gonzo!\n\n-(ENGINE RUMBLING) -Whoa!\n\nNot only did The Muppet Show go on to be the number one show in the world, it was also a huge hit in America.\n\nThe Muppet Show was massive.\n\nWhen I was growing up, there were fewer channels.\n\nAnd so when The Muppets would be on it was a big giant deal.\n\n-Where?\n\nOh, this lever!\n\n-This lever over here... No, this lever!\n\n(BOTH SCREAMING) They were gigantic in the UK, the US and Canada and Japan, all over the world.\n\nThe Muppet Show backstage.\n\nIt was pretty exciting when my father got the chance to make The Muppet Show in London The only sad thing, in a sense, was that he had to go and spend so much time away from the family.\n\nWe were all going back and forth and visiting him there.\n\nNARRATOR: The time spent apart is a strain on Jim's relationship with his wife, Jane.\n\nShe had five kids and it's, uh... That's a full time job.\n\nShe took care of a pretty large and chaotic family.\n\nMy mom's world was the family life.\n\nMy dad would be there sometimes, but it was more like he had his world of the making of the shows.\n\n(YELPING) NARRATOR: Henson and his Muppets are on top of the world.\n\nBut for Jim, there are always new creative worlds to conquer.\n\nThe Muppet Show was the most watched show in the world, and now, next.\n\nJim's focus became more and more on the movies, first the Muppet movies.\n\nYou hadn't really had an entire all-puppet cast carrying a movie out in the real world.\n\nHENSON: Jim Frawley, who was the director, wanted to shoot in studio.\n\nI was really trying to talk him into shooting outdoors and I said, \"Come on over\" and he brought a Super-8 camera and we shot footage of the characters outdoors.\n\nFrank and Jim went out in the countryside in England, in front of a bunch of cows.\n\nHave you ever been to Los... Have you ever been to Los...\n\nExcuse me.\n\nHave you ever been to Los Angeles.\n\n(CHUCKLING) (CHUCKLING) Okay, I think I've milked this far enough, right, guys?\n\nNARRATOR: Jim and Frank's experiment is a success and The Muppet Movie opens in 1979.\n\nYeah, well I've got a dream too.\n\nBut it's about singing and dancing and making people happy.\n\nJim was always looking for something that could be done simple but leave people saying, \"How did they do that?\"\n\nGonzo, what are you doing?\n\nAbout seven knots!\n\nI remember watching and seeing Kermit riding on a bike and having just no idea how that could be done.\n\nHe had an idea and then nothing would stop him from doing it.\n\nIf it was impossible, he would make it possible.\n\nThe first day I came to visit him on the set of The Muppet Movie, \"Where's Jim?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's underwater.\"\n\nLike, what?\n\nKermit was on a log in the swamp, and Jim's like underwater in a tank.\n\nNARRATOR: The Muppet Movie is a smash hit, as is The Great Muppet Caper, which opens in the summer of 1981.\n\nThat same year, Jim does the unthinkable.\n\nDespite its soaring popularity, he ends The Muppet Show's five year TV run.\n\nWe had a wonderful time doing it.\n\nYou know, and I think it was, uh, really, five delicious years in my life.\n\nJim wanted to stop when we were at our best.\n\nI realize now, that was a golden time.\n\nIt was magical and it was a grind.\n\nAnybody who does a series on TV knows it is a relentless thing, every single week and you're working like hell and there's nobody, nobody who worked harder than Jim.\n\nCHERYL: The Muppet Show was fantastic, but he wanted to keep experimenting.\n\nHe wanted to keep trying new things.\n\nHe said, \"You know, we do cute really well.\"\n\nBut then, you know, this whole fantasy world was something that he really loved.\n\nJim had this dream of being recognized as an artist, uh, and not simply an entertainer.\n\nAnd this led him into the fantasy world of The Dark Crystal.\n\nTrial by stone.\n\nTrial by stone!\n\nPart of the desire was to create a whole new world.\n\nYou know, to start all over and design everything.\n\nThere is much to be learned.\n\nAnd you have no time!\n\nNARRATOR: Jim enlists artist and designer, Brian Froud, to collaborate on the characters and environment for his 1982 feature film, The Dark Crystal.\n\nWe just were exploring the possibilities of characters.\n\nI was sketching first, and then I made little models of the Skeksis and the Mystics.\n\nThe story wasn't really defined until Jim and Cheryl got stuck in a blizzard at JFK.\n\nWe were stuck there for a couple of days and it allowed my dad the time to actually think through a lot of the ideas that he had brewing in his head.\n\nThe thing that is incredible about The Dark Crystal, is that everything you see up there on screen is made by hand.\n\nWe were, in those days, pioneering.\n\nWe didn't know quite how to do this and how to manipulate them, and what scale they were going to be.\n\nNARRATOR: Dark Crystal's complex combination of manual and remote-control puppetry is daunting.\n\nI said, \"This is it!\"\n\nJim's optimism has really gotten beyond him this time.\n\nCHERYL: The whole thing was very complex and my father really poured his heart and soul and his own personal money into getting this film finished.\n\nWe had such high expectations for what it was going to be, and it's almost as though nothing could live up to those expectations.\n\nNARRATOR: The Dark Crystal opens to mixed reviews and fewer ticket sales than Henson's blockbuster Muppet movies.\n\nBRIAN: People thought it was a little too out there, a little bit too weird, a little too serious, a little too heavy.\n\nThey're like, \"Where's the Muppets?\n\n\"We want the Muppets.\n\nWhat is this thing?\"\n\nOZ: Dark Crystal was not a huge success.\n\nIt hurt him that, uh...\n\nDark Crystal wasn't received as he thought it would've been.\n\nThe Dark Crystal was considered to be a bit of an aberration, sort of a a slightly weird cul-de-sac.\n\nBut, I could see it was expressing the very heart of who he was.\n\nNARRATOR: After work on The Dark Crystal is over in London, Jim returns to New York, but it's no happy homecoming.\n\nAfter nearly a quarter century of marriage and five children, he and Jane have grown apart.\n\nAnd Jim has been seeing other women.\n\nThey agree to a formal separation.\n\nEven when at times they didn't get along, very well personally later on, he totally trusted her creative opinion and she had an impeccable taste level, so they continued to have that dialogue always.\n\n-This is the touch wall, right.\n\n-Yeah.\n\nNARRATOR: With the prime time success of The Muppet Show, Jim no longer fears being labeled a kid's entertainer, so he launches a new children's show in 1983.\n\n♪ Dance your cares away ♪ Worries for another day ♪ And let the music play ♪ Down at Fraggle Rock♪ Fraggle Rock was his global show.\n\nThat was his show for the whole world.\n\nMAN: Fraggles are a noble race.\n\n-(WHOOPING) -Fearless, dignified, intellectual.\n\nHe said to us all, let's make a series that's going to stop war.\n\nIf we're going to make a series that's gonna stop war in the world, well, you have to start with kids because adults, it's too late.\n\nWell, I know what I'd do, if I was faced with such a tragedy.\n\nSo do I.\n\nSo do I.\n\nIn fact, I've been preparing for it all my life.\n\nNARRATOR: Premiering in January of 1983, Fraggle Rock is the first original series on the new cable channel, HBO.\n\nThe Trash Heap knows all.\n\nThe Trash Heap tells all.\n\nLet's face it, boys, the Trash Heap is all.\n\nNARRATOR: Fraggle Rock's success reintroduces the Muppets to a new generation of TV viewers.\n\nBut Jim hasn't given up on his fantasy film vision.\n\nWe were exhausted by the end of The Dark Crystal and we sort of said, \"Never again.\"\n\nBut we were at a showing of Dark Crystal in San Francisco.\n\nJim just looked at me and said, \"Should we do another?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Well, why not?\"\n\n(CHUCKLING) NARRATOR: Responding to criticism of Dark Crystal as being too dark and without human characters, Jim revises his approach on his 1986 film, Labyrinth.\n\nHe brought on Terry Jones to write it and he had that lighter Monty Python-kind of feeling.\n\n-He always lies.\n\n-I do not.\n\n-I tell the truth.\n\n-Oh, what a lie!\n\n(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) There were some real actors with David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly.\n\nLook what I'm offering you.\n\nNARRATOR: While technologically groundbreaking, Labyrinth is not a commercial success.\n\nHe did take that hard when Labyrinth came out and the reviews weren't great.\n\nIt was kind of devastating.\n\nCHERYL: He felt like he had hit the notes he needed to hit to get people to like it and it still fell flat.\n\nHe was uncertain.\n\nHe was disappointed.\n\nHis confidence was shaken.\n\nFROUD: Jim was disappointed but he was really proud of them as a piece of art, and indeed he was right to be proud that over the years it's not just become a classic, but it became really influential.\n\nI could see over the years how fatigued he looked 'cause he was handling so many projects and trying to keep this going and that going and I began to see it in his face how exhausted he was.\n\nNARRATOR: Between running the company in New York and the company in London, Jim is looking for much-needed relief by 1989.\n\nOZ: He was just exhausted.\n\nAnd he had a company of 300 people.\n\nSo he would be flying everywhere because he had to have his hand in everything 'cause he was the boss and he had the vision.\n\nIt's...it's tough.\n\nAnd so, he told me, you know, he just didn't wanna do that anymore.\n\nHe wanted a...\n\nHe wanted to just create.\n\nFRITH: There were all those layers of bureaucracy that begin to build up even in a little funny organization or disorganization like ours.\n\nThere was just a lot of stuff.\n\nAs he saw it, Disney was gonna take over all that stuff.\n\nMy dad had a great relationship with Michael Eisner.\n\nThey had known each other for many years.\n\nNARRATOR: Jim, who likes to do business on a handshake, begins merger negotiations with Disney Company CEO, Michael Eisner.\n\nHe looked forward to a company that would be financing all new products and new movies.\n\nAnd he loved the parks.\n\nJim was a tremendous admirer of Walt Disney and what he accomplished.\n\nMy father kind of thought it was pointless to be in any theme park other than the Disney parks because they were the best.\n\nHe needed to find a way that the Muppets could thrive without it taking so much of his time and effort 'cause he wanted to experiment with other stuff.\n\nHe was looking for protection for his characters, knew that I cared desperately about the quality of his work, knew that I understood his work, and that Disney would protect his work forever.\n\nWe were starting to work on projects as though the deal had been done.\n\nNARRATOR: Jim begins work on the Muppet Vision 3-D attraction at Disney World.\n\nHe was getting to play in the third dimension.\n\nWe were gonna make more movies and television shows.\n\nHe was gonna be treated well financially.\n\nThen came a terrible negotiation period, then came the lawyers and that was very draining on my dad.\n\nOZ: It did wear him down a great deal.\n\nHe was trying to make something work but he had to make it work for himself, for the characters, for the Muppets and for the people around him, and it wasn't working.\n\nHe said something about \"The goddamn deal,\" referring to the Disney negotiations.\n\nAnd I was rocked when he said that.\n\nBecause for him to say \"The goddamn deal\" was like anybody else letting off with a 10 minute stream of expletives.\n\nHe was worn down.\n\nHis system, I think, was not as strong during this time period and he got sick.\n\nBut I don't think he wouldn't have gotten as sick had he not been worn down by the deal that much.\n\nWe were in Walt Disney World together.\n\nHe and I and his daughter.\n\nAnd he got the flu.\n\nMy dad very rarely got sick.\n\nUm, but he did seem to have a cold and he seemed exhausted.\n\nOZ: He didn't know how sick he was, I'm sure.\n\nWhatever illness he had, he thought he could take care of it, and he didn't think it was that serious.\n\nMy dad didn't really like going to doctors much.\n\nAnd it has certainly something to do with his upbringing and his mother being a Christian Scientist.\n\nHe would never go to a doctor and get antibiotics.\n\nReally, he'd just always weather through it.\n\nFRITH: He canceled his sessions on Sesame Street that day, which was unheard of.\n\nEverybody joked about Jim.\n\nJim the Iron Man, you know.\n\nNo matter how lousy he felt he would always turn up.\n\nGANZ COONEY: He came home and was sick, but he didn't want a doctor.\n\nThen he called Jane to come in and stay with him.\n\nThey were about to get a divorce, which showed you that he was scared in some way at bottom.\n\nI got called as he was going to the hospital, like, \"What do you mean, he's going to the hospital?\"\n\nJim and I shared an assistant.\n\nAnd, um...\n\nI came in and I said, \"Where's Jim?\"\n\nAnd she said he's in the hospital, he's got a bad flu.\n\nAnd I said, \"Okay.\"\n\nBut then she said he's in intensive care and I said, \"Wait a second\" and I was thinking to myself something... Something is wrong.\n\nJONES: They put him in the ICU almost immediately and he was unconscious in less than two hours and never regained consciousness again.\n\nNARRATOR: In the early morning hours of May 16, 1990, Jim Henson dies of organ failure, resulting from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.\n\nThe phone rang, and it was Frank Oz and he said, \"Joan, Jim is dead.\"\n\nAnd I, you...\n\nI had a hard time staying on my feet.\n\nI would vacillate between profound grief and then anger of why didn't you, why didn't you do the sensible thing?\n\nBut it was all too late.\n\nI heard two doctors talking about the fact that he just... That he just came in too late.\n\nThey said another hour or two would have helped, would have made the difference.\n\nOne shot of penicillin would have solved the whole problem.\n\nIt took your breath.\n\nYou couldn't believe it.\n\nHe was a young man.\n\nHe was the heart and soul of the family.\n\nAnd the idea of him passing was so unacceptable.\n\nNARRATOR: Five days after his death, a memorial service is held at the Cathedral of St. John, the Divine, in New York City.\n\nSix thousand people showed up.\n\nWe were all just shattered.\n\nOZ: The loss was so great that I think we just didn't accept it at that time.\n\nOur job was to honor him.\n\nAnd I think that carried us through.\n\nAnd I remember the bishop in New York saying, \"I've never felt closer to the Kingdom of Heaven, than I feel at this moment.\"\n\n♪ It's not that easy ♪ Being green♪ Oh, my God, there was not a dry eye in the place.\n\nThank you, Kermit.\n\nKENWORTHY: It was a company built entirely around Jim.\n\nPeople said, what would ever happen if... You know, if Jim wasn't here, well... You knew the company would fold.\n\nIt couldn't...\n\nIt couldn't go on.\n\nAnd then, suddenly out of the blue here was that very situation.\n\nThere was kind of a threshold question of like, \"Oh, well, should it all just be shut down right now?\"\n\nAll of us said we wanted to go on.\n\nWe just... We saw it as a life's work, and we would like to continue.\n\nNARRATOR: When Jim's hero, Edgar Bergen, passed away, his puppet sidekick Charlie McCarthy was retired.\n\nNow, with Jim gone, the fate of Kermit is uncertain.\n\nWhen Kermit dies, what message do you want to send?\n\nI think you're trying to send children a message that in some way, life goes on.\n\nBecause it would have been unthinkable for kids.\n\nIt would have been a death in the family.\n\nA decision was reached that if Jim could have his say, there'd not be a doubt in his mind that Kermit should come back and Kermit should go on.\n\n-Oh, a post card from my uncle, Kermit.\n\n-What's it say?\n\nI forgot to tell you that the big production number is meant to be a tribute to Jim Henson.\n\nAn emotional CBS special, The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson, airs on November 21, 1990, six months after Jim's death.\n\nI remember this Jim Henson fella.\n\n-Oh, yeah?\n\n-Yeah, he was always hanging around.\n\n-Where, where?\n\n-Where?\n\nUh... Down there.\n\nThere were some heavy times, but there were moments in which nobody could say anything.\n\n\"I feel very sorry that your best friend, Jim died.\"\n\nWhat, died?\n\nWe were just starting to get to know him.\n\n(SIGHS) I...\n\nI always felt like his presence was around in the characters.\n\nAnd we'll be seeing you soon with more Muppet stuff because that's the way the boss would want it.\n\nNARRATOR: In September of 2003, Jim's old friend, Willard Scott, speaks at the dedication of a statue in Jim's memory at the University of Maryland, where Jim met Jane Nebel, and their Muppet journey began, half a century before.\n\nLittle kids and big kids like me can sit in Jim's arm and have pictures taken.\n\nAnybody that loved Jim Henson has got to see that.\n\nNARRATOR: The next year, 15 years after negotiations began, the Disney deal finally gets made, insuring that Jim's Muppets will live on.\n\nAs a family we asked Disney to continue on the tradition of the Muppets.\n\nAs a family we put a lot of things into the hands of Sesame Street.\n\nMy dad's legacy is being put in a number of museums.\n\nJim has a legacy like Charles Schulz has a legacy, like Walt Disney has a legacy.\n\nIt's the characters that he left behind.\n\nHe didn't just open doors, there was in the universe a place where there might be a door that nobody had seen before.\n\nAnd he recognized that door.\n\nAnd he opened it.\n\nHe went in and he brought a whole lot of people with him who shared a certain kind of vision.\n\n♪ It's not easy being green OZ: He was sweet and tough.\n\nHe was free and had strong will.\n\nHe had a lot of fun but he was very serious.\n\nHe was professional but he was silly.\n\nHe was a very good decent person who had flaws like anybody else.\n\nBut he always had a higher calling in mind, which is to do good.\n\nEverything about him was to do good, be good, be kind, be caring, help other people.\n\nThere's not a week that goes by that there isn't some reason I don't think of \"How would Jim handle this?\"\n\nSo, I carry him around.\n\nI think all of us do.\n\nHe's gone, but he's still around.\n\nJim was someone of terrific curiosity, ambition and drive and talent, and it's extraordinary when someone has a vision and, and realizes it, It's quite something when characters you've created have a life of their own.\n\nIt really is remarkable.\n\n♪ I'm green ♪ It'll do fine ♪ It's beautiful ♪ And I think it's What I wanna be♪ \"Jim Henson: \"In Their Own Words\" is available on DVD.\n\nTo order, visit shopPBS.org or call 1-800-PLAY-PBS."
