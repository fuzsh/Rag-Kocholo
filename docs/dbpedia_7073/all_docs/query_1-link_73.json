        "text": "Kermit the Frog…Miss Piggy…the rest of the furry, loveable cast of The Muppets…don't they just bring a smile to your face every time you see them? Would you believe those characters were the creation of a special creative mind? Whose was it? Jim Henson's, of course!\n\nJim Henson was born James Maury Henson in Greenville, Mississippi, in 1936. As an adult, he stood 6 feet, three inches tall and loved to work with puppets. Before he had even turned 20 years old, he had achieved success with a popular late-night puppet show called Sam and Friends.\n\nHenson became known for his signature humor, and his puppets became popular fixtures in television commercials. Henson also pioneered the technique of using cameras to focus on the puppets while keeping the puppeteers out of the frame. This allowed puppeteers more freedom, since they didn't have to be stuck behind a screen. It also made the puppets seem much more lifelike.\n\nHenson's big break came in 1969, when his puppets became an integral part of popular educational show Sesame Street. Since that time, Henson's beloved characters have become closely associated with public television.\n\nIn 1976, Henson developed his own comedy show based upon his puppets. The Muppet Show struggled at first, but eventually became a smash hit that was one of the most widely watched television shows in history.\n\nAlways up for a challenge, Henson branched out into major movies, proving that his puppets could be as popular on the big screen as they were on television. Over the years, Henson's characters have charmed countless children with their unique brand of humor.\n\nHenson died in 1990 of bacterial pneumonia. Today, his work lives on through the various companies and organizations he founded, including The Jim Henson Company, the Jim Henson Foundation and Jim Henson's Creature Shop.\n\nJim Henson has inspired millions of people with his creativity. His words have also inspired many to pursue their dreams. Here are a few of Jim Henson's famous quotes:"
