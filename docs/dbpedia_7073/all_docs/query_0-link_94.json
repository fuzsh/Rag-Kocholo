        "text": "Presented by PNC:\n\nJIM HENSON: IMAGINATION UNLIMITED\n\nSaturday, September 28, 2024 - Sunday, January 5, 2025\n\nA Muppet-filled multimedia exhibition spotlighting the groundbreaking work of world-renowned puppeteer Jim Henson will be playing in Peoria this fall. The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited, presented by PNC will be making its last stop before leaving the U.S. on a European tour.\n\nFew people of the 20th century have had such enduring, wide-reaching, and inter-generational appeal as Jim Henson (1936-1990). His innovations in storytelling revolutionized childrens’ education, and his work from “Fraggle Rock” to “Dark Crystal” had a profound impact on generations of people.\n\nThe Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited explores Henson’s transformative impact on popular culture, creating immersive worlds for film and television, and reveals how he and a talented team of designers, performers, builders, and writers brought to life the enduringly popular worlds of The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, and much more.\n\nHenson, with his gently subversive humor, restless curiosity and innovative approach to puppetry, built the Muppets into an enduring international brand, contributed beloved characters to Sesame Street, and made movies that applied his vivid imagination to stories for the big screen.\n\nThe comprehensive and dynamic exhibition features Muppets, puppets, character sketches, storyboards, scripts, photographs, film and television clips, behind-the-scenes footage, iconic costumes, and interactive experiences that allow visitors to try their hand at puppeteering on camera and designing a puppet character. The exhibition also includes material from Henson’s experimental film projects and his early work, presenting him as a restlessly creative performer, filmmaker, and technical innovator.\n\nThe exhibition was developed by Museum of the Moving Image (MoMI) and brought to Peoria by International Arts and Artists.\n\nJim Henson: Imagination Unlimited is presented by PNC\n\nMajor support from Gilmore Foundation and OSF Healthcare"
