        "text": "Trivia: The \"HA!\" logo is still in use today as the print logo for Henson Alternative.\n\nVariants:\n\nAn early version exists of the 2nd version of the logo that had the word \"For\" next to \"ha!\" (like the first version).\n\nThe Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years utilized a cut-short version of the later Muppet Babies variant (as to avoid showing the Marvel Productions logo), likely because they lacked another logo to use.\n\nThere is a special in-credit logo variant that was used on '80s prints of The Muppet Show to replace the outdated ITCand/or ATV in-credit logos (ITC only distributed the show and ATV only held production duties within Britain). In the final shot of the end credits when Zoot blows his saxophone, a white bubble flies out of the sax with the \"HA!\" logo (or \"HIT!\" for Henson International Television) displayed on it and takes its place in the center of the screen, to the amusement of the audience. Sadly, this variant is no longer seen as the current prints (as on DVD releases) merely use the shot of Zoot blowing his sax with a newer Muppets Holding Company copyright notice on the bottom.\n\nFX/SFX: Like the MTM and Cartoon Network Studios logos, the animation varied on whatever show it was used on.Music/Sounds: Plays over the ending theme. The closing theme for the short-lived Muppets, Babies and Monsters, as well as the second season of Muppet Babies onward, an off-key trumpet fanfare was heard at the end of the theme and played over the logo. On The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years, we hear Zoot blowing his saxophone, much like the in-credit \"bubble\" variant.\n\nAvailability: Very rare. Sometimes it's saved on 1984-1986 episodes of Muppet Babies, but it's usually replaced with a Jim Henson Productions/Jim Henson Television logo on that show or other shows. The Muppet Show DVD releases from Buena Vista replace the in-credit version with a copyright stamp for The Muppets Holding Company. However, it was seen on Playhouse Disney in the UK when they reran the show. This logo is usually preserved on the 1986 special The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years.\n\nEditor's Note: None.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(September 13-December 27, 1986)\n\nLogo: On a white background, we see:\n\nHENSON\n\nASSOCIATES, INC.\n\nwith a copyright stamp below in black. The text bears a strong resemblance to the zooming variant of the previous logo.\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The end theme of the show, but on Muppet Babies, the same off-key trumpet theme from the previous logo's variant from that said show.\n\nAvailability: Was originally seen on 1986-1987 episodes of Muppet Babies. Usually preserved whenever someone decides to show the series.\n\nEditor's Note: The logo looks quite boring and generic, but it was likely made as a prototype or placeholder.\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(September 12, 1987-January 16, 1988)\n\nNickname: \"The Shining Kermit\"\n\nLogo: On a white background, we see the words arranged like this:\n\njim henson\n\nPRODUCTIONS\n\n\"im\" and \"enson\" are written in an italic script font, with the \"J\" and \"h\" in green and in presumably the same font as the \"ha!\" in the first logo, and the \"J\" is placed near the words \"PRODUCTIONS\". Then a small flash of light appears above the \"J\" and becomes a still drawing of Kermit the Frog's head, which is used to dot the letter. Underneath is a Henson Associates copyright notice.\n\nVariant: In Fraggle Rock: The Animated Series, the logo is still, the script font is colored blue, and there's no copyright notice.\n\nFX/SFX: The Kermit head appearing and \"shining\". None for the still variant.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The end theme of the show, but again on Muppet Babies, the off-key trumpet once again.\n\nAvailability: Usually preserved on 1987-1988 episodes of Muppet Babies. This still variant was seen on the animated version of Fraggle Rock.\n\nEditor's Note: None.4th Logo (September 10, 1988-January 30, 1993) Logo: As with the logos for MTM and Cartoon Network Studios, the logo described below comes in many animated variations. Basically, we see the words:\n\nJim Henson-------_____________________________________----P R O D U C T I O N S\n\ndisplayed on an object against a gray \"wall\" background. The words \"Jim Henson\" are in the now-familiar corporate \"Henson\" logo font introduced in 1988.\n\nTrivia: The name \"Jim Henson\" is actually his signature.\n\nVariants: There are rumored to be many more variants than currently listed.\n\nSign 1: An animated version of Kermit the Frog's hand puts a white sign with a string on a nail on the wall reading \"Jim Henson Productions.\" Suddenly the sign tilts and the lettering falls off, clattering to the ground.\n\nArrow: An animated version of Kermit the Frog’s hand holds out a white sign against the wall reading \"Jim Henson Productions.\" Suddenly an arrow (with an orange or pink fletching) flies into the sign pinning it to the wall, and taken by surprise Kermit lets go.\n\nSign 2: An animated Kermit the Frog hand holds up a white sign by a string reading \"Jim Henson Productions.\" Suddenly the sign snaps off of the string and falls straight to the ground with a crash.\n\nWindow Shade: The animated Kermit hand pulls down a window shade-like scroll that reads \"Jim Henson Productions\". The shade moves back up and it rolls around a bit before settling.\n\nTV Set: We see the \"Jim Henson Productions\" text already formed in a white rectangle on a tan background, but then the animated Kermit hand comes up holding a TV remote and clicks it, and the screen goes black like a television set being shut off.\n\nRifle: One of Kermit's hands holds a sign from the bottom that reads \"Jim Henson Productions\". Eventually, an off-screen rifle fires at the sign, destroying it.\n\nDarts: Similar to the arrow variant, but instead of an arrow, three darts fix the sign, with a fourth dart just missing Kermit's hand and bouncing off the wall.\n\nOther Variants:\n\nA copyright stamp may be seen under the logo.\n\nTNT reruns of The Muppet Show had a variant to replace the first logo's \"bubble\" variant; here, when Zoot blows out of his saxophone at the end of an episode, a gray circle with a white outline emerges from it, and the circle zooms in to engulf the screen; when that occurs, one of the normal animated variants then played against the gray background.\n\nFX/SFX: The animations in the logo variations.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A particular variant’s sound effects, but on some shows the end theme finished over it; Muppet Babies has the off-key trumpet theme, combined with the sounds.\n\nAvailability: Still preserved on 1988-1991 episodes of Muppet Babies, but is sometimes replaced with newer logos. This was also used at the end of Fraggle Rock reruns on TNT from the late 1980s (as well the Disney Channel reruns of said show from 1992-1996, and at the end of the 1993 VHS releases, except for the fifth volume, \"A Festive Fraggle Holiday\", which uses the 7th logo), and the first season of Dog City after the Nelvana logo. The Muppet Show variant was only seen on TNT reruns of the show from 1988 to 1992, so it's now extinct.\n\nEditor's Note: All these variations the logo offers are generally fun to watch.\n\n5th Logo\n\n(1988)\n\nLogo: On a white background, we see the words:\n\nJim Henson_____________________________________P R O D U C T I O N S\n\nDisplayed on the background with the same font as introduced in the 4th logo but with black coloring.\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None.\n\nAvailability: Rare. Seen on 1988 releases of Muppet Babies Video Storybooks.\n\nEditor's Note: None.\n\n6th Logo\n\n(April 14, 1989-May 6, 1990)\n\nLogo: A series of green circles appear near the middle of the screen, from which emerges a long and wavy line that flails until if contracts and forms the words \"Jim Henson\" (in the company's corporate script font), as well as a line below them. The word \"PRODUCTIONS\" then appears below the script, letter by letter, with a shine effect.(this also turns the green line red). Finally, a flash appears to create a red dot above the \"I\".\n\nVariants:\n\nOn The Jim Henson Hour, the logo's animation is superimposed over the credits background, which then fades to black just before the \"dot the I\" part.\n\nThere is a short version that starts with the \"Jim Henson\" script already formed.\n\nOn The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson, the logo is still and superimposed over a background of TV monitors displaying clips of Henson's work.\n\nFX/SFX: The green line twisting and forming the \"Jim Henson\" script and line, \"PRODUCTIONS\" appearing, and the flash dotting the eye.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The end theme of the show. On The Jim Henson Hour, its end theme syncs with the logo's animation.\n\nAvailability: Very rare. Seen on The Jim Henson Hour, as well as the 1989 airing of A Muppet Family Christmas. The short version was seen on The Muppets at Walt Disney World.\n\nEditor's Note: None.\n\n7th Logo\n\n(April 26, 1991-2006, 2012-2015)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"183\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/4740649537aa758a8307668247470e57de30c03e\" width=\"244\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"183\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/youtubevideo/153b13fd33a4c763f06ca192837d1d6ce9cf630d\" width=\"324\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/youtubevideo/0d8da36976f5f8de51575d06d9d371d52bd856dc\" width=\"329\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"Laser Kermit\", \"Kermit Head\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, a blue laser carves out a line across the screen. The line flips towards the screen, revealing a blue outline of Kermit the Frog, who is then filled with color from left to right. After shining brightly, Kermit is then swallowed by a dot of light that dances across the screen, which from left to right sweeps out the words:\n\nJim Henson-------_________________________________\n\n----P R O D U C T I O N S\n\nthen flies back to the logo to dot the \"I\".\n\nVariants:\n\nUsually, on TV shows from Jim Henson Productions, only the \"dot the I\" sequence of this logo plays.\n\nIn 1997, starting with Bear in the Big Blue House, the word \"PRODUCTIONS\" is replaced with \"TELEVISION\" (a.k.a. Jim Henson Television).\n\nWhen Sony distributed Jim Henson productions in 1997 under the home entertainment label, the dot sweeps out the word \"HOME ENTERTAINMENT\" instead of \"PRODUCTIONS\" (a.k.a Jim Henson Home Entertainment) on the full-version of the logo after the Kermit head was swallowed by the dot of light and buzzes around.\n\nOn Dinosaurs, a pterodactyl flies over the logo from right to left. Sometimes, the pterodactyl sits on the logo either squawking or looking left. Also, the logo is in its 3D style with the gradient shines on it. However, season 1 and the first 8 episodes of season 2 use a still version of the normal variant.\n\nOne version of the 1997 version has \"The Jim Henson Company\" in place of \"TELEVISION\" and the text below the logo is in grey coloring instead of red. This was only known to exist on It's A Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie.\n\nThere is also a still version of the logo.\n\nOn Muppet Meeting Films, the logo in a regal blue background displays \"A Muppet Meeting Film Produced by\" on top of the logo. Another variant where the text fades in after the dot flies onto the \"I\" has the location info text \"117 East 69th Street New York, NY 10021\" below the logo and above the byline.\n\nOn the music videos for \"Kokomo\" and \"She Drives Me Crazy\", the word \"RECORDS\" replaces \"PRODUCTIONS\". It's also in place after the program/presentation of The Muppet Show, The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper where it uses the style from the Jim Henson Video logo and with the text above it with \"Soundtrack Available on\" (for film releases only) and \"Music From The Muppet Show Available On\" (for The Muppet Show).\n\nThere is also a version with copyright info on the bottom of the screen, sometimes with the URL \"<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.henson.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.henson.com</a>\" just above it.\n\nOn early North American VHS releases from Jim Henson Video, including The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper (which were later plastered by the Jim Henson Pictures starting on DVD releases of the two films),Muppet Babies: Explore With Us, Muppet Babies: Time to Play, Muppet Babies: Let's Build, It's The Muppets: Meet the Muppets, It's the Muppets: More Muppets Please! and The Tale of the Bunny Picnic, the logo was off-center. Additionally, there is also a difference on how Kermit's eyes were designed akin to Young Kermit and the dot of lights shine brighter on this variant. It was fixed starting on later 1993 VHS tapes like The Muppet Christmas Carol and the Kermit graphic was re-touched. In Muppet Babies: Let's Build, there is a video editing error of the off-center variant that has small amount of the beginning and ending frames (including the fade out) edited out to where the logo cuts straight to the Muppet Babies intro at the end. In Non-American releases, a centered version of this variant appears on Muppet Babies VHS tapes while other early Henson videos have the Jim Henson Video logo before the presentation.\n\nOn Muppet Classic Theater, the \"dot the I\" variant plays as the word \"PRESENTS\" (in the same font as \"PRODUCTIONS\") fades below the logo.\n\nA silent medium-length version, starting with the text being wiped onto the screen, was spotted at the end of Gulliver's Travels.\n\nAnother shortened version, which starts at Kermit about to get sucked into the light, appeared at the end of The Muppet Christmas Carol and Muppet Treasure Island.\n\nOn Mopatop's Shop in the UK, a still version of the \"TELEVISION\" variant is shown alongside the Carlton Television logo in orange or white.\n\nOn Jim Henson's Animal Show, it's on a blue background and Tizzy The Bee flies to the logo when the dot comes in.\n\nOn The Hoobs, the logo is seen with the Channel 4 \"Squares\" logo and the Decode Entertainment logo.\n\nOn some prints of Muppets Tonight, the animated \"PRODUCTIONS\" variant is seen alongside the 1988-97 BBC logo in white.\n\nFX/SFX: The blue laser \"carving,\" the color \"filling,\" the dot of light \"swallowing\" and \"sweeping\" out the logo.\n\nTrivia:As Tizzy (a CGI animated bee) was chroma keyed in the The Animal Show variant of the logo and on the show, the effect for Barry the Honeybee like the logo was done in puppet form for street scenes in<a href=\"https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_4189\" target=\"_self\">Episode 4198</a> onSesame Street.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The long version has a weird \"phaser\"-like sound when the laser appears, and when the Kermit head \"flips\" into view, an orchestrated horn/string fanfare is heard. A whoosh, 3 timpani hits, and chimes/shining sounds are heard when the head is colored in and shines. A louder whoosh and a cymbal crescendo are heard when the head gets sucked into the dot of light, followed by a woodwind section with plucked strings and \"buzz\"-like sounds (not unlike a cartoon bumblebee) as the dot of light flies around, and another whoosh when it sweeps out the text. One more \"buzz\" is heard as the dot returns, and a \"ding\" and a gong hit are heard when the \"I\" is dotted, followed by a triumphant horn/string/woodwind chord to finish the logo. The music was composed by Miles Goodman.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variant:\n\nAt the end of movies and shows, either the end theme or silence plays over it.\n\nOn the 1994 VHS of Hey Cinderella!, the final \"buzz\" is partially muted, fading in just as it dots the \"I\".\n\nOn PAL VHS releases from Jim Henson Video, the long version of the music is high pitched. 90's prints of Muppet Babies with episodes that used the 4th logo's variants plastered said logos, but kept their sound effects intact.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. It was first seen as a still variant on season 1 of Dinosaurs, and the full version made its debut on The Muppet Christmas Carol on December 11, 1992. The short TV version is generally left intact on most shows from the company (except for Sesame Street) as well asMuppet Timeskits aired on Nick Jr.; if classic Jim Henson shows like The Muppet Show and Fraggle Rock are rerun in the future, this logo might be tacked on unless a different logo is used (such as a Muppets Holding Company Ltd. copyright notice, a newer Henson logo, or HiT Entertainment). The long version can be seen on several '90s VHS prints from Jim Henson Video such as Fraggle Rock: A Festive Fraggle Holiday (this VHS also uses the short version of this logo at the end, unlike the other four 1993 VHS releases which use the 4th logo), Muppet Sing-Alongs videos, and A Muppet Family Christmas, as well as films like the aforementionedMuppet Christmas Carol and Muppet Treasure Island; it can also be seen on various Muppet Babies videos (first releases in the U.S. like Let's Build had the logo off-center) before the show's opening theme. The \"RECORDS\" variant can be found on a promo for the album Kermit Unpigged, as seen on the 1994 VHS release of Muppet Classic Theater. Strangely, the long version can also be seen at the end of the 1994 VHS release of Muppet Classic Theater.\n\nEditor's Note: A fondly-remembered logo by many people.\n\n8th Logo\n\n(August 18, 2000-March 10, 2003)\n\nNickname: \"Computer Henson\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, a series of flying computer-like lasers and streaks write the green words:\n\nTHE JIM HENSON\n\n-------COMPANY---------\n\nwith the word \"THE\" in superscript format.\n\nFX/SFX: The laser \"writing\" effects.\n\nMusic/Sounds:A phaser sound effect with a whooshing sound,or the end theme of the show or movie.\n\nAvailability: Seen on Farscape, starting with the 15th episode of season 2, as well as Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story.\n\nEditor's Note: The text looks very generic, but the laser effect makes up for it.\n\n9th Logo\n\n(October 17-18, 2004)\n\nLogo: On a black background, the white Jim Henson Company logo fades in.\n\nFX/SFX: The logo fading in.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The opening/ending theme of the show.\n\nAvailability: Only seen onFarscape: The Peacekeeper Wars.\n\nEditor's Note:None.\n\n10th Logo\n\n(April 27, 2005)"
