        "text": "Sesame Street began in 1969, under the direction of the Children's Television Workshop (now known as Sesame Workshop). Jim Henson was contracted to provide the puppets for that show.\n\nAt that time, Jim Henson was also producing a number of specials starring other Muppet characters (Kermit, for example, had been created for a local TV show in 1955, and Rowlf for a commercial in 1962).\n\nIn 1976, The Muppet Show began. Most of that show's major characters, except for Kermit and Rowlf, were new creations either for the show itself or for a special intended as a pilot the previous year.\n\nIn 2000, Sesame Workshop bought the Muppet characters that had been appearing on their show from the Henson company.\n\nIn 2004, Disney bought the Muppet Show, its characters, spinoffs, movies, and a few precursor specials (along with the word \"Muppet\") from Henson (along with Bear in the Big Blue House).\n\nFraggle Rock and some other specials not starring either of the above-mentioned sets of characters (except in small roles) remain under the Jim Henson Company's ownership.\n\nNothing so dramatic.\n\nPrior to Sesame Street's creation, Jim Henson (creator of the Muppets) already had a show called The Muppets. The cast of this show are the Muppets of The Muppets franchise (including the movies).\n\nWhen The Children's Television Workshop started developing Sesame Street they wanted puppets to be part of the program, so they asked Jim Henson to provide these puppets. So Jim Henson developed a separate cast of Muppets for Sesame Street, but also added his signature character from the original Muppets: Kermit the Frog.\n\nThat's why the two franchises have different characters, and thus different rights."
