        "text": "Jim Henson\n\nJim Henson\n\nBorn in Leland, MS, James “Jim” Maury Henson is the world’s most famous puppeteer and a master storyteller. Henson told stories through innovation, invention, and inspiration.\n\nInnovation\n\nJim Henson changed the world of puppeteering forever. For many years, puppets were mostly figures made of wood or other hard materials and their expressions could not change. Henson used resourcefulness and innovation to construct puppets out of rubber, foam, felt, and small metal bars used to control their limbs. Henson called these creations “muppets,” combining the words “marionette” and “puppet.” The Muppets have inspired and influenced puppeteers around the world ever since.\n\nOn loan from The Jim Henson Company\n\n© 2021 The Jim Henson Company.

Henson invented so many new ways of puppeteering that he founded Jim Henson’s Creature Shop. Through the Creature Shop, animatronic puppet control systems were created which enabled puppets to appear almost life-like. This control system was named the Henson Performance Control System in honor of the Creature Shop’s founder.\n\nDiscussion\n\nK-3rd Grade\n\nIf you started a shop, what would you sell?\n\nWhat can you control with technology?\n\n4th-6th Grade\n\nThe puppets controlled by the Henson Performance Control System are animatronic robots.
