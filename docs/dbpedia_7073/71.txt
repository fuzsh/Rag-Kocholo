Jim Henson

Born in Leland, MS, James “Jim” Maury Henson is the world’s most famous puppeteer and a master storyteller. Henson told stories through innovation, invention, and inspiration.

Innovation

Jim Henson changed the world of puppeteering forever. For many years, puppets were mostly figures made of wood or other hard materials and their expressions could not change. Henson used resourcefulness and innovation to construct puppets out of rubber, foam, felt, and small metal bars used to control their limbs. Henson called these creations “muppets,” combining the words “marionette” and “puppet.” The Muppets have inspired and influenced puppeteers around the world ever since.

Invention

Jim Henson revolutionized puppetry, entertainment, and education by inventing new ways for puppets to communicate with audiences. Henson invented so many new ways of puppeteering that he founded Jim Henson’s Creature Shop. Through the Creature Shop, animatronic puppet control systems were created which enabled puppets to appear almost life-like. This control system was named the Henson Performance Control System in honor of the Creature Shop’s founder.
