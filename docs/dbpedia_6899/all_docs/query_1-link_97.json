It is probably older than\n\nearlier Kaupang finds.\n\nMore than 30 house foundations and remnants of extensive\n\nhandicraft production have been uncovered. The items\n\nfound have been unusually well preserved due to the dry\n\nclimate in this region.\n\nArchaeologist Asle Bruen Olsen says to NRK TV that the\n\nfind is older and larger than those uncovered in other\n\nplaces, and that it will be very important in the\n\nresearch into the early Viking age.\"\n\nhttp://www.norwaypost.no/content/view/22366/26/\n\nhttp://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_sogn_og_fjordane/1.6725566\n\nBecause of the good preservation conditions, they do expect to\n\nexcavate between 100.000 and 150.000 animal bones, wich is more\n\nthan found in all the Norse Viking Age sites together.\n\nNot clear to me is whether this is a new discovery or the rescue\n\nexcavation of an earlier known site prior to the building of a new highway.\n\nPeter Alaca:\n\n\n\nIt's an all new site, but my first thought was \"of course\", for several\n\nreasons. The valley of L�rdal is and has always been an east-west\n\nhighway. A trading post named Lusakaupang is known from the sagas and is\n\nthought to have been located in what's now the bayside village with the\n\ntelling name Kaupanger straight across Sognefjorden. The location of\n\nthat one seems certain but has always nagged me since just on the other\n\nside, in L�rdal, travellers by land from east and by sea from west could\n\nhave met directly. In more recent centuries L�rdalsmarknaden (\"The\n\nL�rdal Fair\") in October, held where the valley meets the fjord, was an\n\nimportant annual event in the trading connections between east and west,\n\nwhere the commercial houses of Bergen came to trade with farmers from\n\nSogn and from the valleys across the mountain ridge. By midsummer there\n\nwas a fair and a religious festival up in the main mountain pass (and\n\nthe mountain chapel was -- is -- dedicated to St. Thomas, no doubt\n\nbecause his feast day was a convenient excuse for celebrating a much\n\nolder tradition).\n\nBut the location of the new Kaupang puzzles me, too. Being sat on a\n\nriver-bank half-way up the valley, at 130 m above sea level, it's\n\nneither reachable by ship nor placed where the roads from the different\n\neastern valleys meet (to maximize the effect of trans-shipping). This\n\nmight be what the archaeologists think of when they call it a \"local\n\nKaupang\" -- its location in a spot that may fit /local/ east-west trade\n\nbut, even if on a major trade route, doesn't make sense for\n\nlong-distance shipping of goods. If so, it's hard to see how it could\n\nhave been a permanent settlement rather than an annual market.\n\nI glean from the NRK article and the comments below it that the local\n\nplace-name is Bj�rkum, traditionally interpreted as \"birch-home\", and\n\nthe likeness with the <birk> of Sw. Bj�rk� (Birka) and several Norwegian\n\ntrading stations named Bjark�y wasn't lost on e.g. the great 19th\n\ncentury historian P.A. Munch. Another name coincidence (of my own\n\nnotice): The local parish is named Borgund, no longer a farm name but\n\nbelieved to have originated as one. There are farms named Borgund three\n\n(other) places in Norway. In one of them it's also the parish name. That\n\none is another old Kaupang, Borgund near �lesund.

I see Laerdal is a pretty\n\nlarge municipality. Can you name a village?\n\nBrian M. Scott skreiv:\n\n\n\nThanks. I didn't find (or remember) the island in Kvinnherad. In\n\naddition to these there's a \"farm\" (is \"homestead\" a better term?) on\n\nthe north side of the Stad promontory. On a larger scale the island (and\n\npre-Viking Age trading center) of Bornholm (< <Borgundarholm>) in the\n\nsouthern Baltic and the Burgundians share the same element.\n\nThe idea is that 'borg' as a toponymic element went through a bleeching\n\n\"fortification\" -> \"fit for fortification\" -> \"flat with steep sides\".\n\nLooking briefly I'd say that some of the places, especially the islands,\n\nfit a \"steepsided flat one\" etymology, but that seems hard to reconcile\n\nwith both the �lesund kaupang and the valley parish.\n\nThe only idea I have for reinterpretation is that the first element\n\nmight have meant \"trade, negotiation\". The verb 'borge' means \"vouch,\n\nguarantee\", generally taken from \"protect\", but could also have risen\n\nfrom \"negotiate\". A similar (or the same) development can perhaps be\n\nseen in German 'Burger' \"citizen (engaged in trade or in _a_ trade)\".\n\nBut I see that the parish line is drawn above Bj�rkum, so this idea is\n\non even shakier ground than it first seemed.\n\n--\n\nTrond Engen\n\nJack Linthicum skreiv:\n\n> On Aug 18, 8:56 am, Peter Alaca <p.al...@invallid.invalid> wrote:\n\n>\n\n>> Trond Engen <trond...@engen.priv.no> 18/08/2009 13:40 wrote:\n\n>>\n\n>>> <http://tinyurl.com/nfd9qd>\n\n>>\n\n>> Thank you.

I see that traditionally the atlantic\n\nsalmon has climbed L锟絩dalselva (the river) to Sjurfossen (waterfalls) 5\n\nkm upstream, so this is about as far as people from the eastern valleys\n\nwould need to walk, and quite likely the very first campsite they'd find\n\nalong the river banks that is above the highest flood. Could it have\n\nbeen an annual fair on the time of year when people from near and far\n\ngathered here to fish? People coming back every year could even invest\n\nin solid houses, which would make the flood level even more important.\n\n--\n\nTrond Engen\n\n\n\nClucks like me can go back to the citation and hit the \"translate\"\n\nbutton.

As it looks\n\ncurrently, this is an important cultural heritage, and it will of\n\ncourse also could be a great tourist attraction for Lærdal, \"said the\n\nmayor.\n\nLes mer i Vårt Land på papir, onsdag 12.

Harvesting was over, so\n\npeople were free to travel. In the eastern woodlands and up north sled\n\nseason from christmas to easter was the best time for markets. In L�rdal\n\nit was different since the deep snow and the unpredictable weather would\n\nmake the western mountains almost impenetrable, and deep, rotten spring\n\nsnow would last at least until june on parts of the road. In october\n\nfrost but little snow could make the mountain lakes and bogs easier to\n\ncross, in good years maybe even by sled.\n\nThe great L�rdal market that I mentioned was held in October every year\n\nfrom before 1596, when the time was fixed to eight days from Oct. 7,\n\nuntil the 19th century, when the social problems of drunkenness and\n\nviolence and its being made obsolete by modern communications led to a\n\ngradual decay until its abandonment in 1872.\n\nI'm not sure what that means for the salmon idea, though. The salmon\n\nseason in Norwegian rivers is in the summer months, in june and july at\n\nthe mouths, later in summer in the upper parts of the rivers, and the\n\nmore so the longer and harder a river to climb. The fish would have been\n\nmoving slower upwards before modern-day salmon ladders, but I don't\n\nthink it would be much later than mid-september at Bj�rkum (but this\n\nlatest conjecture is based on little real knowledge). Late august and\n\nseptember is a nice time to travel in the mountains, often with bright\n\nweather and dry peat. It's a bit early for farmers, but not if that's\n\nwhen the food is there.\n\n--\n\nTrond Engen\n\nPeter Alaca:\n\n\n\nI'm not so sure about that.\n\nYou've translated the articles that quote the Minister of\n\nCommunications, Liv Signe Navarsete (who is a local, from Hï¿½yanger\n\nfurther out in the fjord, and representing this region in parliament),\n\nas being in doubt as to what would be the correct procedure in this\n\ncase. That was the answer of a politician who is still waiting for\n\nreports and advice from the relevant authorities.\n\nYou've also translated an interview with the retired Regional Culture\n\nDirector Lidvin Osland who says that if this is a world class site, as\n\nthe archaeologists claim, moving the road should be a minor thing. And\n\nthen he plays the tourist card. These are words that will chime well\n\nwith local politicians.\n\nBut there's another complication: The chief archaeologist, Asle\n\nBruen-Olsen of Bergen Museum, warns against moving the road because the\n\nsite can't be left as it is. Now that the seal is broken one has to keep\n\ndigging. I suppose this means that if the Road Authority closes the\n\nproject, the authomatically released money for digging will disappear,\n\nand he fears that the site will be left as it is until some other\n\nsource, like the Directorate for Cultural Heritage, finds new money.\n\nThis article from the local paper Sogns Avis has something, though:\n\n<http://www.sognavis.no/lokale_nyhende/article4512010.ece>\n\n[...]\n\n[No:]\n\nï¿½ Gjenstandane me har funne kan utvilsamt bidra med ï¿½ gje ny kunnskap om\n\ntidleg vikingtid, og dei vil nok vera ein sentral referanse for\n\nframtidige vikingstudiar, trur arkeolog og prosjektleiar Morten Ramstad.\n\nFunna i Lï¿½rdal er mest truleg frï¿½ om lag ï¿½r 800 e. Kr.\n\n[En:]\n\n- The artefacts we have found can without doubt contribute new knowledge\n\nof the early Viking Age, and they are likely to become a central\n\nreference for future viking studies, believes archaeologist and project\n\nleader Morten Ramstad.\n\nThe finds in Lï¿½rdal are most likely from around 800 CE.\n\n[No:]\n\nTil november\n\nUtgravingane er sett i gang og finansiert av Statens vegvesen, som til\n\nneste ï¿½r skal byggja veg over dette omrï¿½det.\n\nDen opprinnelege planen om ï¿½ vera ferdige med utgravingane 20. august\n\nvar basert pï¿½ at dei enno ikkje hadde indikasjonar eller spor pï¿½ det dei\n\nno har funne, fortel arkeolog og seksjonsleiar Asle Bruen Olsen.\n\nï¿½ Me har no sendt inn sï¿½knad til riksantikvaren om ï¿½ fï¿½ forlenga\n\nutgravinga, slik at omrï¿½det kan bli dokumentert pï¿½ ein skikkeleg mï¿½te,\n\nseier Bruen Olsen, som trur vegkontoret som tiltakshavar ogsï¿½ vil gï¿½ med\n\npï¿½ dette.\n\nDen nye planen er difor ï¿½ utvida til ti arkeologar og halde fram til\n\nbyrjinga av november. Seinare i haust vil teamet frï¿½ Bergen Museum ha\n\nopen dag slik at interesserte og lokalbefolkning kan koma og sjï¿½ pï¿½\n\nvikingfunna.\n\n[En:]\n\nUntil November\n\nThe excavations were initiated and financed by the National Road\n\nAuthority, which next year will be building a road across the field.\n\nThe original plans to finish excavations August 20 were laid when there\n\nwere still no indication or trace of what has now been found, says\n\narchaeologist and section leader Asle Bruen-Olsen.\n\n- We have now sent an application to the Directorate for Cultural\n\nHeritage to prolong the excavation, so that the field can be documented\n\nin a proper fashion, says Bruen-Olsen, who believes that even the\n\nRegional Road Management as the project owner will agree to this.\n\nThus, the new plan is to expand to ten archaeologists and keep digging\n\nuntil early November. Later this autumn the team from Bergen Museum will\n\nopen the site for a day so that interested public and locals can come\n\nand see the viking finds.\n\n(Sadly you and Jack seem to have found just about everything that's been\n\nwritten about it. I've tried the University of Bergen and Bergen Museum,\n\nI've tried the national and regional cultural heritage authorities, I've\n\nsearched the national and regional newspapers, and I've looked in the\n\nonline reseach bulletin <forskning.no>, with no result. One reason may\n\nbe that the parliamentary elections are coming up and the press is busy\n\nelsewhere.)\n\n--\n\nTrond Engen\n\nJack Linthicum:\n\n> On a different but pretty similar slant, I notice that this place is\n\n> about 20 km downhill from a mountain pass.

Or the price.\n\nThere's plenty of water in the mountains here.\n\n20 km up the valley? That would be Borlaug, the forking of the old roads\n\nto Valdres and Hemsedal/Lower Hallingdal. That's quite a fertile spot in\n\nitself, and where I would have expected a marketplace (if not by the\n\nvalley's mouth)*. Or do you mean the mountain pass to the south? That\n\nactually makes some sense. When I looked at it the other day** I assumed\n\nthat the path would branch off either up R�sdalen downriver or Nesdalen\n\nnear Borgund church, but it seems quite likely that travellers with\n\npackhorses would follow the valley to Bj�rkum, take the path up the\n\nsouthern hillside and follow the mountain plain*** southwards to\n\nHallingskeid rather than one of the steep side valleys in that direction.\n\nPerhaps even packhorse traffic to the other passes could choose to climb\n\nonto the mountains here, the route to Lower Hallingdal taking a more\n\neastern route than the one we've just seen and the route to Valdres\n\ngoing up the northern hillside.\n\n*) Being the only place in Norway with this name, it has to be the\n\norigin of the surname of the Nobel Prize laureate Norman Borlaug.\n\nWikipedia tells that his family were from Leikanger out by the fjord,\n\nthough. Oluf Rygh explains the name as <borg> + <l�> \"plain near water\"\n\n(but I believe there are other options for the latter element).\n\nInteresting, except that I've already discredited my own attempt on\n\nreinterpretation of 'borg'.\n\n**) There's a placename Hallingskeid on the highest point in the pass.\n\nIn toponyms 'skei(d)' is usually explained as \"racetrack\", but it could\n\nalso mean \"road dividing two fields\". Etymologically it means \"divide\",\n\nand in this case I believe it simply means \"the Halling border\"\n\n(Hallings are the inhabitants of Hallingdalen). Either way, it shows\n\nthat the pass used to be a road towards (the upper parts of) Hallingdalen.\n\n***) Norway is not so much a country of mountains as one of deep valleys\n\nand fjords. The mountains are generally flat and easy to walk, at least\n\nas long as one follows the general direction of the landscape, while the\n\npaths in the valleys may have parts that are too narrow and steep for a\n\npackhorse. In more recent days traders used to buy horses and cattle in\n\nthe western fjords and lead them on established paths along the mountain\n\nridges between the valleys to the profitable markets in the eastern towns.\n\n--\n\nTrond Engen\n\nOn Thu, 20 Aug 2009 01:56:19 +0200, Trond Engen\n\n<tron...@engen.priv.no> wrote in\n\n<news:h6i3h7$713$1...@news.eternal-september.org> in\n\nsci.archaeology:\n\n[...]\n\n> *) Being the only place in Norway with this name, it has\n\n> to be the origin of the surname of the Nobel Prize\n\n> laureate Norman Borlaug.
