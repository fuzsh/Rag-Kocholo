        "text": "History of Tedeschi Surname\n\nThere are two possible explanations for the origin of the Italian surname Tedeschi and its variations such as Tedeschini, Tedesco, Tedisco, Todeschi, and Todesco. Firstly, the name may be of nickname origin, descriptive of some personal or physical characteristic of the initial bearer. In this case, the name may be derived from the Old Germanic word “theudisk or theodisk”, which comes from “Theuda”, meaning “German people”. Thus this name came to indicate “one who came from Germany, a German”. In some instances, it is also possible that the name is of occupational origin, belonging to the category of surnames descriptive of the trade or profession pursued by the original bearer. In medieval Italy, most fifers were of German extraction and therefore, the name Tedeschi in time came to denote a fifer as well as a German. This surname can be found throughout Italy and is recorded as early as the 12th century in the Latin forms Teudiskus, Todescus, Todischus, and Tediscus. Early records show that between the 13th and 16th century a family of the name Tedeschi originally from Catania was counted among the nobility in Messina, Sicily. In 1573, one Giovani-Giacome Tedeschi was a member of the counsel of noblemen of Verona. One Giovan-Giacome Tedeschi was recorded in 1651, and Leonardo Tedeschi was residing in Verona in 1666. Other references in Italy include the recorded birth of Giovanni Michele Tedeschi, which took place on the 17th of September 1808, in Castelnuovo Della Daunia, Foggia. His parents were Carmine Tedeschi and Domenica Lembo. It is also known of one Maria Giovanna Tedeschi who married Antonio Migliozzi in Carinola, Caserba on the 22nd of November 1840.\n\nCoat of Arms & Family Crests indicates the surname of TEDESCHI is an Italian and Jewish name for someone of German origin who spoke German. The name was derived from the Italian word TEDESCO. As a Jewish name it was given or taken by Ashkenazic Jews in Italy, or is based on a nickname given to a Jew who had been to Italy. In Lucca, the variants TODESCO and TODESCHI were nicknames for a stammerer; in Naples the variant TODISCO was a nickname for a tippler. The name is also spelt TEDESCHI, TUDISCO, TODESCHINI and TEDESCHINI. The Austrian Jewish industrialist and philanthropist Hermann TODESCO (1792-1844) took this surname after he had acquired the nickname TODESCO as a result of numerous trips to Italy. Despite evidence that hereditary surnames were in use in the Venetian Republic as early as the 10th Century, the origin of many Italian surnames is unclear. There is still a great potential for research into medieval Italian records while documented evidence indicates the adoption of the father's name as a surname is the most common form. The familiar endings of \"i\" and \"o\", meaning to be a member of a certain family, bears this out. The Church played a very important role in Central Italian heraldry and many Italian families who derived their titles from popes incorporated elements of the papal insignia, notably the papal tiara and the crossed keys, on their Coats of Arms. As in the rest of Europe, the turbulent history of Italy in the Middle Ages is reflected in its heraldry. Traces remain from the successive invasions of the Germans, French, Spanish and Austrians. Certain characteristics, such as the use of horse-shaped shields which were put on the foreheads of horses during tournaments, remain uniquely Italian. Social conditions in Southern Italy during the agricultural depression of the late 19th Century spurred the first wave of emigration as thousands of people escaped to the New World. Latin America was the original destination for these early settlers but as the economy strengthened in the United States, North America became more popular.\n\nHistory of Caruso Surname\n\nCoat of Arms & Family Crests cites the Italian surname of CARUSO was a nickname derived from the Italian word CARUSO meaning 'close cropped'. This word was also used in the more general sense 'boy'. 'lad', since in the Middle Ages young men of fashion sometimes wore their hair much shorter than was the prevailing style. In the Girgenti area of Sicily the term was an occupational one for a worker in the sulphur pits, since such workers, apparently were required to wear their hair short. As the agricultural depression of southern Italy worsened towards the end of the 19th century, people began to escape to the New World. The exodus started in earnest in 1887 with Brazil and other parts of Latin America being the original destinations. By 1893, the economy had improved in the United States and people headed there from Italy in greater and greater numbers. In 1898 there were more Italian immigrants to the USA than from any other country. In the post war era, more than a quarter of Italians left the country for a new life. They joined a flood of immigrants to America which was averaging a million a year in the pre war years. The origins of Italian surnames are not clear, and much work remains to be done on medieval Italian records. It seems that fixed bynames, in some cases hereditary, were in use in the Venetian Republic by the end of the 10th century. The typical Italian surname endings are 'i' and 'o', the former being characteristic of northern Italy. The singular form 'o' is more typical of southern Italy. The name is also spelt CARUSIO, CARUSELLI, CAROSIELLO, CAROSELLI, CARUSONE and CAROSONI. A notable member of the name was Enrico CARUSO (1873-1921) the Italian operatic tenor, born in Naples. He made his first appearance in FAUST (1895), first appeared in London in 1902 and in New York the following year. The extraordinary power and musical purity of his voice, combined with his acting ability, won him recognition as one of the greatest tenors of all time.\n\nFamily Photo Collection\n\nThe slide shows are better viewed with Internet Explorer.\n\nA collection of photos as a tribute to the flora and fauna in the tropics.\n\nFamily Video Collection\n\nThe videos below are compilations of travels, parties, and holidays listed in chronological order of the events.\n\nYear\n\nDate\n\nEvents\n\nDescription\n\n2006 May 27 A tribute to mother's day 2002 to 2006 This is a collection of photos of Eloisa and Nicole from 2002 to 2006 [2:09] 2009 Nov 14 Capoeira A friend of ours made a presentation with the Capoeira group in College Station at the Worldfest in College Station, TX [10:15] Dec 25 Christmas' presents This video features Nicole opening her Christmas presents and building her Barbie house with daddy in our living room in College Station, TX [10:39] 2010 Fev 12 Nicole's birthday This video has the 8th birthday of Nicole [1:19] Mar 26 Rosa Parks presentation This video has the presentation performed by Nicole Tedeschi about Rosa Parks at Rock Praire Elementary School (2nd grade) [2:04] Apr 8 Tour in Vietnam This video shows the traffic in Ho Chi Minh city and Hue, Vietnam [3:39] Apr 10 Drums of hope The \"drums of hope\" is a party hold in Narita, Japan at the beginning of the spring for people safety and health, and good agriculture production [3:34] Apr 10 Japanese eel BBQ Learn how to prepare eel for BBQ; video recorded on Sunday fair in Narita, Japan [2:16] Apr 27 Fireworks in Pira city The celebration of São João fest at the Clube de Campo de Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil with special introduction by Nicole [9:53] Apr 27 Paella a la Dona Inês A quick video of the Paella a la Dona Inês [2:05] Jul 9-12 Thermas dos Laranjais Time off at Thermas dos Laranjais Resort [4:19] Nov 6 Texas A&M x Oklahoma Football game between TAMU Aggies and Oklahoma Sooners (Nov 6, 2010) [10:10] Nov 6 Texas A&M Aggieband The band at Texas A&M University (aggieband.org, tamubands.tamu.edu) [7:12] Dec 11 Christmas in the Park Christmas in the Central Park of College Station, TX [1:38] Dec 15 The night before Christmas The night brfore Christmas at Rock Prairie Elementary School [15:13] Dec 25 Christmas night Openning the Christmas presents and thank you!

As per the State Council of Honor and Merit of São Paulo (CEHM), commendation is an award given to individuals who excel in their fields, from artists, politicians, businessmen, and athlets. In the Middle Ages, this award had a completely different meaning as described by \"in commendam\". At that time, the award was a benefit given to members of the clergy or the military who showed bravery in battle. \"Generally, the commendation was worth something, as the title to the land. Over the centuries, its value has become symbolic, represented by diplomas or medals,\" as told by Mr. Waldemar Baroni, Herald (specialist titles and badges nobility) to the magazine Superinteressante. If before the commandator had a duty to defend the land against incoming enemies, he now has no defined function. The commendator distinction confers prestige in certain social circles. Still, the title survives in the ceremonial government and private institutions, which follow a hierarchy according to the importance of the honored."
