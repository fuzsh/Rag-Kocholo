        "text": "Fireside this week!\n\nFor this week’s musing, I want to consider the role the historian has in making judgements about the past, particularly – but not exclusively – about historical figures and their legacies. In particular, I very often encounter the notion that historians aren’t supposed to make any sort of value judgements about the past or that we are only supposed to judge past actors by the values of their own societies. Both claims are, at best, a fairly substantial misunderstanding of how the discipline of history functions and what its aims are. On the one hand, historians ought to seek truth about the past, but on the other hand we also ought to interpret the facts we find with an eye towards present-tense use and understanding. Doing the latter requires rendering a variety of value judgements; the historian does not pretend perfect objectivity (such a thing being, we contend, impossible) but is instead intended to indicate at the outset what the basis of those judgements are.\n\nThat is not, by the by, some sort of new thing in historical inquiry. There is a tendency in some quarters to assume that historians assigning judgements to things in the past is some sort of new thing (often implicitly or explicitly ‘leftist’ in some way), but historians of decades past did this too. The only difference is that those historians generally didn’t acknowledge the values they were applying. But it is, for instance, not an accident that Johann Gustav Droysen (d. 1884) and William W. Tarn (d. 1957), both upper-class men writing in hegemonic, imperial monarchies (Prussia and Great Britain, respectively) thought Alexander’s hegemonic, imperial monarchy was fantastic. They were ‘pro-‘ regimes which enforced – to borrow Tarn’s phrasing of Alexander’s accomplishments and mentality – “the unity of mankind” by killing lots of mostly brown people. They just didn’t feel the need to register those values in any way because those were the hegemonic values of the society they lived in; they assumed their readers too accepted the fundamental justice of creating the “brotherhood of man” (also a Tarn phrasing) through armed violence. And indeed what people mean when they complain that now historians are ‘imposing’ their values on history is really, ‘in the past I agreed with the values historians imposed on history, but now I do not.’ This isn’t a plea for objectivity, but for special consideration. What has changed with more modern historians is that we try to be honest about how we make our value judgements and that we are doing so (or at least we’re supposed to try – some historians do not succeed and others do not try).\n\nNor was that new to the modern era. Recall that Polybius (writing in the second century BC) presents part of the purpose of history being that, “men have no more ready corrective of conduct than knowledge of the past” (Polyb. 1.1.1); such a corrective, of course, can be of little use without make value judgements about those past events. “So-and-so did X” has no value as a corrective of conduct without the added assessment, “and that had positive/negative effects” or “was productive/counter-productive to certain aims.” Herodotus and Thucydides, the first historians, have no problem assessing certain actions and certain figures as wise or foolish, pious or impious, brave or cowardly and so on.\n\nAnd indeed, historians today tend to view claims of ‘objectivity’ very skeptically. On the one hand, as a discipline we value the ability to view historical events dispassionately and follow the evidence where it leads. On the other hand, the history of history (historiography) and other fields as well suggests that ‘true’ objectivity is impossible. Even when advocates of more quantitative fields claim true objectivity and ‘value-free’ analysis, to most historians it seems what they’ve done is hide their value systems, not remove them. What is studied and how it is studied still derive from non-objective systems of value; the values are still there, merely the frame of consideration has been adjusted to hide them. Such claims of ‘value-free’ analysis in the past have all too often served efforts to cloak values (often quite contested ones) in the mantle of ‘objective science.’ This is not a retreat into crass relativism; some things are true and other things are not, but even the choice of what truths we pursue (to the necessary exclusion of others, given limited time and resources) is an expression of value. Historians – not universally, mind you, but generally – have tended to figure that it is better simply to be transparent about how we are judging something, rather than to claim falsely that we offer no judgement at all.\n\nThat said, one of the things historians are trained to do is to inhabit systems of value or knowledge different from our own. You’ve seen me do this, for instance, in explaining how the world looks from inside religious systems which I do not believe or discussing the values of medieval military aristocrats which I do not hold. The entire Sparta series relied in part on repeatedly accepting value frameworks to which I disagreed in order to show that even by those standards Sparta fell short. Doing that does require the ability to view a subject – even an odious one – dispassionately, to consciously use a different system of values or set of assumptions than the ones you operate with in every day life. That same skill is useful when trying to judge a given outcome, event or person, allowing the historian to inhabit different value systems and offer an analytical judgement for each.\n\nOne such application, of course, is to judge a given event or character by the standards of their own society. I made a point, for instance, in the recent Twitter debate on the legacy of L. Cornelius Sulla, to point out – more than once – that even by Roman standards, Sulla was regarded quite negatively. Indeed, even Roman optimates like Cicero treated Sulla as, at best, an embarrassment, while Plutarch’s sketch of Sulla’s dissolute and luxury-corrupted character is quite severe. The Gracchi, Caesar, Cicero and Cato the Younger all had their partisans and defenders in the decades after their deaths; defenders of Sulla (or late career Marius!) are rare indeed.\n\nThat said, this standard is limited in a lot of ways. In practice, in my experience, most demands to only judge figures that engaged in conquest, slavery or racism ‘by the standards of their time’ come from individuals who, when one pulls out a nickel and scratches the surface just a little, turn out to be pro-conquest, pro-slavery or pro-racism. The ‘figures should only be judged by the practices of their day’ pose turns out to be a weak disguise for the more serious and also usually more reprehensible position that those practices were good. It is not always the case, but it is very frequently so.\n\nBut most people, when asking a historian about a figure do not want to know what Gaius Q. Publicus thought of something, but what they should think of it. After all, Thucydides offers his “possession for all time” but rather “an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to understanding the future” or as Polybius advances it, “a ready corrective of conduct.” To simply assemble historian details without any intention of them ever being useful to anyone is just, after all, antiquarianism, a pursuit every bit as shallow as crass presentism. They are asking if a given thing is something to be admired and emulated, or a cautionary tale to be avoided and that requires a bit more of the historian.\n\nOne such more useful standard for individuals is asking, “did this person succeed at what they were trying to do?” For instance, Octavian largely succeeded in his core aims (reestablish the Roman state around his sole rule) whereas Sulla largely failed in his (restore the Roman state to its traditional function in a durable way). That approach is valuable because what people often what to know is if a person or a system was effective, which really boils down to asking if it achieved its aims. That is not the same, mind you, as asking if it conformed to the broader values of its society. Sometimes individuals succeed at their core aims to the general irritation of their broader society; Peisistratos was a great success at making himself tyrant, but the Athenians don’t seem to have been truly thrilled about it, for instance.\n\nAt the same time people are often not asking, “did this thing do what it intended” but rather “was that outcome good?” Would it have been good for me?” That second question is, of course obviously implicated when some blockhead suggests that what we really need is a Caesar or a Sulla or a Franco to solve all of our problems (a repeat occurrence lately); the historian has not raised modern judgement here, rather the initial question has by proposing that society needs someone of the type of some historical figure. That requires the historian to step outside of the values of the past or the intents of historical figures. One such measure you’ll see me use quite to assess those questions is the impact to individual well-being for the average or typical member of a society. That can be, I think, a lot more illuminating than simply asking how a given society or person stacked up against the values of their day. After all, by the values of many Greek elites, Sparta was at least notionally fantastic, but we can be quite sure Sparta was a pretty terrible place to be for most people who lived there (but whose condition fell beneath the notice of the Greek elites who write to us). So when the question is, “was Sparta a society to be admired, to be emulated by us?” assessing it in terms of its treatment of a typical member of the society is a lot more useful.\n\nAt the same time, because of the very nature of the questions being asked, it can be important to also assess societies, social structures and indeed individuals against current standards as well. This is not some sort of historical crime, though it is important to lay out the facts as impartially as possible first and then set out a judgement second with transparency on the standards by which the judgement is being laid. If you ask, “was so-and-so a good person?” the answer is clearly going to depend mostly on how you define ‘good person.’ But for the reader asking, “should I admire this society or person?” it is perfectly fine for the historian to say, “well, if you value X, Y and Z, then yes/no.” Likewise it is perfectly reasonable for a historian to say, “if we, as a society, profess our value of X, then we ought to reassess our assumption that person Y is admirable.” For instance, if we think conquest is bad, well it’s quite hard to justify admiration of Alexander the Great on any other basis – which is precisely why the tenor of scholarly reception on Alexander (and perhaps, at some decades delay, public reception) – has shifted, if incompletely.\n\nJudgements like that tend to be complex, especially applied to societies, because most societies have at least some traits we might view positively and some we might view negatively (which is not to say they have them to the same degree; it is fine to judge some societies as worse ways to organize people, so long as we are transparent about the values we use). But they are also useful and indeed to a substantial degree necessary for us to make about the past, if we are going to use it as a guide to the future. And so historians have to make them, albeit in a transparent way where our goal is to explain our reasons to the public and indeed convince the public that they can and should share our reasons. That’s what historians do.\n\nOn to the recommendations:\n\nOver at the Texas National Security Review (which goes by TNSR in security policy circles), assistant professor of national security affairs for the U.S. Navy War College and my old graduate school colleague Joseph Stieb has an article on “Why Did the United States Invade Iraq? The Debate at 20 Years.” Attentive readers may remember that Stieb also wrote a book on this very topic. Stieb’s article is, I think, well worth reading because its purpose is not to argue for a specific position but rather to outline the main scholarly positions. The reason I think that is valuable to read is that, to be blunt, most people hold to some version of uninformed folk history on this topic, either favorable or unfavorable to the Bush administration and most of those folk histories have nothing to do with the actual evidence of why the administration was doing what it was doing. Stieb lays out the positions as they exist now from the people who have bothered to read the evidence and develop informed opinions, dividing them between the ‘security school’ which argues that the administration believed itself (rightly or wrongly) to be moving to counter a real threat to long-term US security and the ‘hegemony school’ which argues that the administration intended instead a substantial extension of American influence and hegemony in the region in the absence of a compelling security threat. He then details how these different schools views on that basic question filter out into how they understand subsidiary questions about the war; the whole thing is well worth a read. TNSR is great for putting the sort of scholarship one generally finds behind the formidable paywalls of academic journals out in an open forum.\n\nSpeaking of which, also worth a read a TNSR is Henrik Larsen’s article, “Thinking About Post-War Ukraine.” Since the start of the war, commentators in the West have rightly urged policy makers to begin now to think carefully about the post-war settlement and in particular the necessary reconstruction of Ukraine. Larsen tackles this question and in particular the problem posed by Ukrainian corruption (particularly ‘grand corruption’) and the opportunities posed by reconstruction and Ukraine’s clear aim to join the EU. Larsen suggests a structure for tying reconstruction aid to anti-corruption reforms, but regardless of what one things about the specific recommendations, the opening history of Ukraine’s anti-corruption efforts since 2014 is valuable, especially since many people’s understanding of Ukraine’s situation here remains mired in the past, even as Ukraine has made steps forward (albeit sometimes slow, halting and halfway steps) on this issue.\n\nOn a far flashier note, UNC’s Prof. Wayne Lee continues his efforts to reconstruct version of the Chinese firelance, one of the earliest uses of gunpowder weaponry, with video of another test-firing, this time of a three-barreled version. If you’ve seen previous videos of his efforts (I’ve highlighted them here and on Twitter), this experiment is clearly more successful, with the use of small copper-caps to keep the burning powder from self-ejecting out of the barrel too quickly, allowing for a longer burn time. Also, it’s just really cool to watch!\n\nFinally, for a bit of the ancient Mediterranean, the latest Pasts Imperfect features quite a few interesting things, including Gregory S. Aldrete discussing his latest book in collaboration with Graham Sumner (one of the premier artistic-reconstruction artists of the day) contrasting how Rome is visually depicted in film against how it might have actually looked. Also noted in the round-up and not to be missed is the spectacular recent find of an incredibly well-preserved 3,000-year old bronze sword from Nördlingen, in Bavaria and an exciting note that the Index of Medieval Art is going freely accessible to the public at the beginning of next month.\n\nAnd for this week’s book recommendation, I’m going to recommend a book I frankly though I had done earlier, Dexter Hoyos’ The Carthaginians (2010). Carthage is one of those ancient states that shows up mostly in history classes in a secondary role as Rome’s chief antagonist before being defeated and then destroyed, but as you may well guess any state that managed to go three rounds with Rome is a lot more interesting than that. Digging into Carthage’s history, however, is difficult for the non-specialist because the Carthaginians largely don’t write to us, forcing us to rely on scattered mentions and discussions in Greek and Latin sources (commenting from outside Punic culture) and the very limited epigraphic evidence from Carthage itself.\n\nIn The Carthaginians, Hoyos, one of the most substantial modern scholars of Carthage, pulls that disparate evidence together to provide the reader a sound introduction to the Carthaginian state, working through what we can know of Carthage’s foundation, political, social and religious structures, and its history down to 146 (with a brief epilogue touching on the memory of Carthage in the sources)."
