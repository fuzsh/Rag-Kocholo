        "text": "Publications on Google Scholar\n\nSaweda Liverpool-Tasie is a MSU Foundation Professor in the department of Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics. Her current research focuses on emergent issues related to smallholder productivity and welfare within dynamic and transforming food markets in sub Saharan Africa and alongside poorly functioning markets in the region. In addition to evaluating the heterogeneous effect of poverty reduction strategies (and social networks) on rural household behavior and livelihood, she has a keen interest in understanding input use and input markets as well as evaluating input policies. Before joining MSU, she was a Post Doctoral fellow at The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). She received her PhD in Agriculture and Consumer Economics from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. She holds an MSc in Urban and Regional Planning and an MA in Third World Development, both from The University of Iowa. She also holds a BSc. (Honors) in Economics from the University of Jos, Nigeria.\n\nHer research work on poverty and international development has taken her to several states in the USA, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and The Gambia. Saweda was a Norman Borlaug Research Fellow in Ethiopia during the 2006/7 academic year. Her work on input use contributed to Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa - GISAIA and was part of a portfolio of research recognized when she (and other colleagues) received the 2017 AAEA Bruce Gardener Memorial prize for applied policy analysis, in recognition of contributions to rigorous policy research” that has impacted several countries. She is a 2016 recipient of the Michigan State University John K. Hudzik Emerging Leader in Advancing International Studies and Programs Award. In 2022 she was appointed to the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), a USAID advisory board.\n\nShe is currently the lead Principal Investigator on a multi-million dollar project, Research Supporting African MSMEs to Provide Safe and Nutritious Food (RSM2SNF) in Nigeria and Tanzania. Previously, she was the Principal Investigator for Feed The Future Innovation Lab For Food Security Policy: Nigeria, which focused on strengthening capacity among Nigerian researchers and other stakeholders to support the agriculture policy processes with evidenced based policy recommendations. As the 2017-18 chair of the Africa section of the AAEA (professional association of agricultural economists in the USA) she launched an innovative continent-wide initiative that paired African scholars with mentors at top research universities and centers. She was on advisory boards for Michigan State University’s African Studies Center and the Alliance for African Partnership; a flagship program of Michigan State University’s International Programs. She is a 2018/19 winner of the MSU Teacher-Scholar Award; given to six MSU faculty members every year, who early in their careers have earned the respect of students and colleagues for their devotion to and skill in teaching that is linked to scholarly work.\n\nResearch and Outreach Interests\n\nPoverty reduction strategies\n\nSocial networks\n\nAgricultural input markets\n\nFood security and agricultural productivity\n\nTeaching Experience"
