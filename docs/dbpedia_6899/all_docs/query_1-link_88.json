        "meta_description": "\"I find myself taking long walks on my farm with my wife, Renee, wondering what in the world happened,\" says Grisham. Today he one of the world's bestselling authors, but John Grisham showed no early interest in writing. One day in 1984, three years after Grisham began practicing law in Southaven, Mississippi, he dropped by the courthouse to observe a trial. \"This ten-year-old girl was testifying against a man who had raped her and left her for dead,\" he says. \"I never felt such emotion and human drama in my life. I became obsessed wondering what it would be like if the girl's father killed that rapist and was put on trial. I had to write it down.\" Grisham has hardly stopped writing since then. Grisham's first novel, A Time To Kill, was published in 1989 and sold a mere 5,000 copies. But his second, The Firm, the story of a law school grad recruited by a firm with mob connections, spent a spectacular 47 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list. Once Grisham started writing, he never stopped. Every year brings a new bestseller from the master of the legal thriller. Many of his works, including The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client and The Rainmaker have been made into successful motion pictures.  Read all over the world, his books have sold more that 300 million copies.",

        "text": "What does the phrase, “the American Dream” mean to you?\n\nJohn Grisham: It’s hard to define, but I guess I’m living it. At times I feel like I’m living a dream. My parents did not have the benefit of college. They didn’t get to go to college. They were from a very rural part of the Deep South, where most of my relatives were from. College to them was always a dream. For us, it was always a requirement. We knew — because they told us — we’d go to college. And they worked very hard to pay for it, and to provide it for all of five kids. And I was the first member of my family to finish college, and to get a graduate degree in law, and to start practicing law. And for the family, that was a source of immense pride. To me, that’s the American Dream, for one generation to keep building the dream for later generations.\n\nMy success was not planned, but it could only happen in America. We entertain the world. There are very few foreign authors that sell here. There are a lot of American authors who sell well around the world. There are very few foreign movies that anybody will watch here. Yet our movies and our music are watched and listened to around the world.\n\nDid you have any experiences when you were a kid that inspired you?\n\nJohn Grisham: There were a couple of things that were very important in my childhood. Number one, my mother did not believe in television. We just didn’t watch much of it. She just thought it was bad, and that was 30 years ago. She believed in books, and we were taught to read early. We were encouraged to read, throughout childhood and adolescence, by my mother.\n\nWe moved a lot when I was a kid, throughout the Deep South. We would always go to a new town and go to the library, get our library cards and load up with books. And we spent our time reading, reading to each other. And my mother spent a lot of time reading to us. I’ve always had a love for books and a love for literature and a love for reading. Oddly, I never thought about writing until late in life.\n\nWas there a person who inspired you?\n\nJohn Grisham: I had the benefit of some very good high school English teachers. One in particular when I was a senior in high school. I was a jock, okay. I was not a student. Although I enjoyed reading, that was about it as far as academics.\n\nBut she forced us to read good books and good writers, particularly good American writers. We weren’t too thrilled to do it initially, but she taught us how to do it. Through that, I discovered some of my favorite authors, particularly John Steinbeck. Once I had gone through all of Steinbeck’s books, I realized that I had had a wonderful experience.\n\nI remember reading a lot of Steinbeck in high school and thinking, “I’d love to be able to write this clearly.” At the same time we were having to read Faulkner. So we had Faulkner on one hand, and Steinbeck on the other, and Steinbeck looked remarkably clear, compared to Faulkner. I can’t say that when I’m in Mississippi, but I can say it here.\n\nWhat was the teacher’s name?\n\nJohn Grisham: Francis McGuffey. She’s still teaching, and we still correspond. She comes to my book signings in Memphis when I’m there. I send her an autographed copy of every book. We’re still friends, still buddies.\n\nWhat particular books meant a lot to you when you were young?\n\nJohn Grisham: I read a lot of books when I was a kid, just for the sheer fun of reading. All the series of mysteries and books like that.\n\nThe first book I remember that really grabbed me was a book that Miss McGuffey made us read, a book called Tortilla Flat by Steinbeck. And when I read it, I really enjoyed the book. And so I went to her and said, “This is really — I like this.” And she was shocked that I would show any interest in what she was making us do. So she said, okay, read this. And the next one was Of Mice and Men. So she sort of fed the Steinbeck books to me. When I read The Grapes of Wrath — we saved that for last — I knew that was a very powerful book. And I don’t know if it had anything to do with my writing style, or me as a writer, because I wasn’t thinking about it back then. It had a lot to do with the way I viewed humanity and the struggles of little people against big people. It was a very important book for me.\n\nWhat was your ambition when you were growing up?\n\nJohn Grisham: To play professional baseball, like every kid, from the time I was six years old until I was 20. It took a long time for the dream to die. It took a long time to realize I didn’t have the talent to play, which is always difficult to accept.\n\nAt what point did you decide to become a lawyer, and how did you go on to become a writer?\n\nJohn Grisham: There was a pivotal moment. I grew up in a very small, close-knit, Southern Baptist family, where everything was off-limits. So I couldn’t wait to get to college and have some fun. And I did for the first two years. And I regret a lot of it, because my grades were in terrible shape. I never got in serious trouble, except for my grades.\n\nFor two years of college, I was going nowhere. And before my junior year in college I said to myself, “Enough of the partying, it’s time to get busy and get serious.” And I decided to study accounting, which was a tough degree to get, and to take that and go to law school and become a tax lawyer. I had sort of a business background, or mentality, I guess. That’s what I enjoyed. And I did. At that point I just said, “Okay, it’s time to get serious.” And I was 20 years old. And at about the same time I said, “Okay, it’s time to forget about playing baseball.” I’d played baseball in junior college, and so it was time for that boyhood dream to go away. And at that point I was no longer a kid.\n\nSometimes giving up a dream can lead to other dreams.\n\nJohn Grisham: Yeah. I had to give that up before I could really be happy pursuing something else. It had been with me so long and the talent simply was not there. I can’t tell you what made it happen, but it was a very real, definite moment, when I said, “Okay, it’s time to grow up.”\n\nAre there personal characteristics that you think are important for success in every field?\n\nJohn Grisham: I love to talk to kids and ask them where they’re going to college, and what they want to study. And so often it’s all planned. They know exactly where they’re going, what they’re going to do and where they’re going to be ten years from now. I don’t want to dampen their enthusiasm, but I want to say, “You can’t plan everything.” I never planned to write books, it was not something I ever thought about. I thought I’d be a lawyer for the rest of my life. It’s important to have goals and to work hard for them, but life has a way of presenting opportunities that you don’t really notice at first. Success a lot of times depends on whether you make a change and try something that you hadn’t planned, something new.\n\nI give commencement speeches occasionally to colleges and high schools, and I usually dwell on that, tell the students, “Get your education and work hard, but don’t race toward the age of 22 or 23 when you’re out of college, and you’ve got the credit card, and you’ve got the BMW, and you want everything right then at the age of 23, because you’re not going to enjoy your education.” I tell kids to stay in school until they’re 30 years old. Their parents hate me for it, but nobody really takes you very seriously until you’re 30 anyway. You need to spend a lot of time in school.\n\nWhat advice would you give to one of these kids if they wanted to write a novel?\n\nJohn Grisham: There are certain things you can do now. I don’t know how much of it is talent. There has to be some talent there, the ability to tell stories, the ability to handle language. There are certain things you cannot do now, but there are certain things you can do now to prepare for it.\n\nThe basics of grammar and vocabulary are very important. And you tend to take it for granted, until you start trying to write. It is terribly important to read extensively. Virtually all writers I know are voracious readers still, and that is preparation. The more you read, the more you know. The more your imagination works, the more you read. And that’s — those are the tools of a good writer. You have to live. Nobody wants to hear — the world does not want to hear — a great novel from a 21 year-old. You’ve got to get a real job and get a real career, and you’ve got to go to work. And you’ve got to live and you’ve got to succeed and fail, and suffer, a little bit, or see suffering, heartache and heartbreak and all that before you really have anything to write.\n\nIf you’ve got the money, it’s nice to travel. Keep journals. Take notes about what you’re doing. You can practice writing. You can start writing now, writing stories and books, or whatever you want to write. The discipline of it is important. All those things are important. Now, can you piece them all together and tell a wonderful story? You won’t know until you try.\n\nThanks for talking with us. It’s been great.\n\nYou’re welcome."
