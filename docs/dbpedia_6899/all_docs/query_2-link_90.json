        "text": "Chicago is a top-10 U.S. #lifesciences market thanks to its strong educational support, according to a recent CommercialCafe report. 💪 In fact, the #Chicagoland metropolitan area is home to 37 institutions offering industry related programs or majors, the second most in the country. 🧪🎓 The Chicago Business Journal explains why life sciences companies are choosing to #BeinIllinois: https://bit.ly/3JXGH6Z\n\n👩🏫 Join the #PRESAGE Training School 💧 From 20 - 23 May, 2024, the #AquaticPollutants research project PRESAGE is inviting you to take part in their training school “Addressing contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in advanced wastewater treatment configurations”. 👩🎓 The course is mainly oriented to PhD students and postdocs that are working on topics related to the monitoring, treatment, or assessment of CECs in #wastewater. The course will contribute to a broader knowledge on how different types of contaminants, such as organic micropollutants (OMPs), antibiotic resistant microorganisms/genes (ARMs/ARGs) and pathogens, should be adequately addressed in new wastewater treatment schemes. 📍 The event will take place in Santiago de Compostela (Spain) and will be held in English. It combines lectures, practicum, technical visit and transversal skills. 👉 Interested? Follow this link to register until 4 March: https://lnkd.in/e_DwEK8h\n\n*Publication update* With my residency in progress, I haven't been able to share my work or accomplishments for a long time. I am grateful to have my undergraduate-level study published in a Q3 journal (European Chemical Bulletin) last year. The idea was to evaluate the level of oral health literacy among a disciple of students not related to the medical fraternity thus emphasizing the importance of Oral health literacy. I've attached the article link below. D.O.I:10.48047/ecb/2023.12.10.494 Do give it a read. #publication #Oralhealthliteracy #EuropeanchemicalBulletin #scopus #manipalcollegeofdentalsciences\n\n#SSETS Training @Commonwealth and Development office @Lancaster University @British Council @National Universities Commission @Coal City University, Enugu @Dr. Akanimo Odion @Dr. Viola. I am an #Educationist, a #Coach and a #researcher in Environmental Microbiology in my #current profession. In #future, I will like to go international collaborating with scientists globally in carrying out research that will affect the society positively. Travelling, meeting people and speaking to an audience are what gives me passion as a person. I intend attending more National and International conferences where I will have opportunity to travel and present my findings. I will also be able to meet people from other countries and then we can collaborate to make findings as researchers. My core strength are #research, #setting up experimental design, #putting up research findings and #analysis of result Statically\n\nI had the opportunity to work in both academic and industry sector in R&D and I can only see similarities in how both of these sectors functions and progress to achieve their scientific goals. However, I have experienced during the recruitment process that academic experience is not given same weightage as industrial experience and that is something I find it discriminating and I strongly disagree with. To me, the approach to design, perform and discover scientific research is similar in both sectors plus the researcher coming from the academic environment will bring the additional skills of broader scientific knowledge , ideas and perspectives of doing science plus the passion for research which is unique and it will only complement the translational research in industry. #industry #academia\n\n15 Doctoral Positions Available in the FAIROmics Project FAIROmics - FAIRification of multiOmics data to link databases and create knowledge graphs for fermented foods is an MSCA-DN-JD Doctoral Network Project. ✅Academic Background: The FAIROmics training programme aims to develop doctoral candidates’ skills at the interface between; 📍Artificial intelligence 📍 Life sciences 📍Humanities 📍Social sciences. ✅Benefits: 📍Gross Living allowance of 3400€/month (correction factor to be applied per country) 📍Mobility allowance of 600€/month. 📍Researchers may also qualify for a family allowance of 660€/month depending on the family situation. 📍 A comprehensive, interactive and international training programme covering the broader aspects and interface between life science, data science, artificial intelligence, humanities and social sciences, as well as transferable skills. 📍An enthusiastic team of professionals to co-operate with. 📍Personal Career Development Plan to prepare young researchers for their future careers. 📍 Individual training at individual institutes for each Doctoral Candidate according to the Personal Career Development Plan description. ✅ Note: Taxation and social (including pension) contribution deductions based on national and company regulations will apply. ✅Apply https://lnkd.in/d2q_y_Hg ⏲ Deadline: Varies\n\nAs a Latin American early career researcher, my routine was very different than at my current position. I used to juggle two jobs with my time in the lab and my personal life. I and my colleagues funded our research with our jobs, sometimes even acquiring laboratory consumables. This motivated me pursuing a PhD in Europe. #braindrain is a real problem in Brazil and other Latin American countries. Ciocca and Delgado in “The Reality of Research in Latin America: An Insider Perspective” discuss key aspects of research in Latin American countries. They list economic factors (low or completely lacking salaries, low research budgets), political instability, and limited career opportunities are identified as primary drivers prompting skilled professionals to seek employment abroad. Their review emphasizes how these factors collectively contribute to a significant loss of human capital, impacting the economic and social development of the Latin American nations. Furthermore, the article highlights the role of education systems and the lack of research infrastructure in Latin American countries as additional contributors to the brain drain. #phdchat\n\nIn this blog, originally written for the Basic Education Coalition, my Chemonics International colleague, Jackson Wu-Pong, details how #StudyExchangeVisits can be an effective way of increasing #collaboration, sharing #learning, and improving #development outcomes if they are set up with some key principles in mind, using the recent example of a successful exchange between the USAID Tajikistan Learn Together Activity and the USAID Georgia Educating the Future Activity.
