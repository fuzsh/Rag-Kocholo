        "text": "It's not because I'm 1/4 Russian that I care about Alexei Navalny's death. It's because I care about adaptability -- the capacity to change under difficult circumstances. Alexei Navalny embodied what I see as the five core elements at the heart of adaptability: INSPIRATION: With his intellect, wit, humor, and warmth, Navalny breathed life into the notion of freedom for all Russians. VISION: Navalny held a picture in his mind of a Russia where people would enjoy their lives, and painted a perspective of a future where people would be free from persecution and autocratic ways. VOICE: For sure, Navalny's voice rang out. Even in captivity, he joked and told stories and his impact could be felt around the world. He spoke up with his hallmark playfulness to provoke others. TOUCH: Despite being in a remote Arctic prison, Navalny found ways to keep in touch with people inside and outside Russia, extending his reach through his extended organization. MOVEMENT: While Navalny's movements may have been limited in a bleak prison, he took steps to share his ideas, motivating others into movement. That Russians risked detention to lay flowers at commemorations speaks to the movement Navalny created. I'm inspired to see how, despite being poisoned by Novichok, being arrested, being imprisoned in the notorious Polar Wolf penal colony, Navalny adapted to harsh conditions, fueled by a vision of a better, freer, more democratic life for Russians. How does Navalny inspire you to adapt? #adaptability #leadership #vision #visionaryleader #shiftbeyond\n\nReflecting on the tragic news of Alexei Navalny's passing, a figure whose life was dedicated to combating authoritarianism in Russia, we are reminded of the critical importance of our collective mission at the Freedom of Mind Resource Center. Navalny's struggle was not just against a political regime; it was a battle for the very essence of freedom of thought, expression, and the inherent right of individuals to live free from manipulation and coercion. This event, while deeply saddening, reinforces the urgent need for our work in supporting individuals and societies oppressed by authoritarian regimes worldwide. It is a stark reminder that the fight against mind control, undue influence, and authoritarianism is far from over. Navalny's legacy teaches us that courage can spark a movement, and even in the face of overwhelming odds, the human spirit's desire for freedom cannot be quenched. In honor of Navalny and all those who have sacrificed for the cause of freedom, we pledge to intensify our efforts. We will continue to stand against the forces of authoritarianism, offering resources, support, and a voice to those silenced by oppressive regimes. Let this moment be a call to action for all who believe in the principles of freedom and human rights. Together, we can create a world where every individual has the freedom to think, believe, and live without fear. #FreedomOfMind #HumanRights #Navalny #Authoritarianism #StandAgainstOppression #cultoftrump #Putin\n\nWell, Madhu Rama, as you say “Name any Black or Brown majority country around the world and there’s a story about how the west has made it worse, sometimes unlivable.” It’s best to keep in mind that these are, as you said, “stories” and that all stories are told from certain perspectives and with certain political or material objectives. Equally, there are stories from different viewpoints. Let’s examine one such story that does not vilify the West, as you seem all too happy to do. First, let it be known that your surname, “Rama” is a name with its origin in the Brahmin caste and is found primarily in the Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar regions of India. If not you, yourself, your family certainly is from one or more of those Indian states. We can postpone to another time what I promise can be quite a lively discussion about the many real and present-day abuses of people from “lower” castes by the Brahmins and by the next-highest caste, the Kshatriyas from whom, traditionally, the majority of military officers are selected. But let’s talk about the horrific abuses of British Lord William Bentnick, who ended the very enlightened practice in India of Suttee, whereby widows were burned to death on the funeral pyres of their (often very older) husbands. I do hope you appreciate my sarcasm as you stare down your officious Brahmin nose at me….or attempt to do so. What an awful guy, this damned British snob, coming along and threatening to protect the lives of Indian women!! https://lnkd.in/gJ9qFGaC Then, there’s the case of American agronomist Norman Borlaug. He developed successive generations of wheat varieties with broad and stable disease resistance, broad adaptive abilities to varied growing conditions across many latitudes, all of which had exceedingly high yields. Dr. Borlaug need not have cared about the plight of peoples (most especially in India) who would starve to death by the millions every time grain crop diseases or other insect pestilence caused famines there before his life of scientific research saved the lives of tens of millions in India and hundreds of millions across the world. https://lnkd.in/gEQjghtn. Now, shall we mention the fact that the overwhelming majority of Indian doctors practicing medicine in India received their training and credentials from American, British, or other European universities? You, yourself, received your degree in Business from my Alma Mater, the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nJFK's \"Peace Speech\" from 1963 is a call for self-examination, as relevant today - given the West's stance on Gaza (“Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.\") & undermining of the U.N. - as during the Cold War. Soviet leader Khrushchev was so impressed with this speech, he allowed it to be printed in it’s entirety, uncensored, in Pravda. Imagine if in each dispute with a partner or coworker, one resorted to threats and giving the other party no option but to retreat in humiliation? It takes a bigger person to show tolerance, respect, and a genuine desire to find common ground. Quotes (full text below): .... \"With such a peace, there will still be quarrels and conflicting interests, as there are within families and nations. World peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor--it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes to a just and peaceful settlement.\" .... \" But it is also a warning--a warning to the American people not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats.\" ..... \"No government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in virtue. As Americans, we find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal freedom and dignity. But we can still hail the Russian people for their many achievements--in science and space, in economic and industrial growth, in culture and in acts of courage.\" ..... \"So, let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.\" \"We are not engaged in a debate, seeking to pile up debating points. We are not here distributing blame or pointing the finger of judgment. We must deal with the world as it is, and not as it might have been had the history been different.\" \"Meanwhile, we seek to strengthen the United Nations, to help solve its financial problems, to make it a more effective instrument for peace, to develop it into a genuine world security system--a system capable of resolving disputes on the basis of law, of insuring the security of the large and the small.\" Video: https://lnkd.in/eGyHgHyS Full Transcript: https://lnkd.in/emd6BC7c -------------------------\n\nIt's natural to think that Netanyahu and his insane government represent the Israeli people, because, otherwise, why would he be in power for so long? However, that's untrue. While we are largely to blame for Netanayhu's ability to bring the most extreme [religious] lunatics to power, this isn't what we wanted. The majority of Israelis are moderate liberals, who are now waking up from decades of sleeping on our noses (since Netanyahu's government started to try to enact a dictatorship in Israel). We've been living our lives and building what some people know as the Startup Nation, while Netanyahu has destroyed Israeli politics for his benefit, which resulted in what you're seeing today. We are accountable for ignoring this. However, many are now reading Netanyahu correctly (see video), both as a dictator-wannabe and a prominent figure in Israel's inability to work on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu has never had a strategy for resolving the conflict, and this insane, fascist government isn't the one that can do anything about it. Netanyahu is held in a death grip by the most extreme members of our coalition because, without them, he can't secure his seat, and thus can't escape his trial. Now don't get me wrong, this war is justified, and Hamas, as one of the two extremes in this situation, must be eradicated. We're facing a terrorist organization that has been growing a generation of hundreds of thousands of Arabs in Gaza who would be happy to see Israel annihilated. And the fact that most of us don't see a concrete way to live in peace with people who think we should all die, should come as no surprise. Is it horrible that innocent Palestinians are dying? Of course, it's f*cking horrible. But ignoring the fact that Hamas is the main reason (just listen to Mosab Hassan Yousef) for this is idiocy and blindness at its worst. What Hamas did, that's been backed up by the majority in Gaza and the ultra-progressives globally, is provide us with a semi-holocaust. But the other extreme is our coalition and their base. They're just fueling up hatred and global antisemitism. For all of our sakes, Netanyahu must be removed from power immediately, and his government disbanded and hauled into prison for betraying the only country we have. Netanyahu is trying to defend his seat no matter what. He has all of the reasons in the world to continue this war regardless of whether it should continue or not, and how. Our soldiers are dying in Gaza, while he and his insane government are investing money in extreme agendas, instead of providing for our soldiers and the hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens affected by Hamas's atrocities. He's to blame for Hamas's ability to grow and function and is using this war to run an election campaign. We, alongside the entire world, must bring moderation to power globally once more, before we're all f*cked.\n\nThe unexpected death of the Russian #opposition leader Alexei #Navalny has once again put the spotlight on the #geopolitical tensions between the #West and #Russia. It is undeniable that Navalny, even after his death, is being used as #propaganda material to fan hatred against the sitting Russian power. However, what is even more poignant is the selective outrage and double standards prevailing among the political #elite in the West. While Western leaders have remained silent for years about the illegal imprisonment of Julian #Assange, the founder of #WikiLeaks, using Navalny as a symbol of resistance against the Russian #regime has almost become a reflex. This blatant #hypocrisy is downright shameful and raises serious questions about the credibility of Western #democracies. It is regrettable that while we can expect such practices from a Russian #regime, we should not expect the same from civilized Western democracies. It is high time that Western #leaders reconsider their own #standards and #values and question why they are selectively outraged and why some #humanrights issues are ignored while others are exploited for #political purposes. If we want the world to continue believing in the #ideals of #democracy and #humanrights, we must be consistent in our actions and not succumb to political #opportunists who are willing to use #humanlives as pawns in their game of #geopolitical chess. It is high time for a thorough reconsideration of our #priorities and #values before we stray further from the #principles on which our Western societies are built. **Disclaimer:** This #commentary is not written with the intention of detracting in any way from the tragic #death of the Russian opposition leader #Alexei Navalny. No one deserves to meet such an end, and our thoughts are with his #family, #friends, and #supporters in this difficult time. This piece is intended to shed light on the double standards and selective outrage in the West regarding #humanrights issues, without trivializing the seriousness of Navalny's situation. #Navalny #Assange #West #HumanRights #Democracy #Hypocrisy #Geopolitics #FreePalestine #peace #journalist #politics #codeblack #EU #NATO #BRICS #ICJ #Hamas #Gaza #Israel"
