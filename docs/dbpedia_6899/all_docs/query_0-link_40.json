Climate change poses new challenges for many crop production systems.\n\nWhile in the past, remote sensing has been applied as a tool for diagnostics, users now want simple recommendations that are tailored to their needs. The aim of this workshop was to cross this chasm and focus on remote sensing applications for farmers, crop advisors, plant breeders, policy makers and last but not least, researchers.\n\nRead the full summary here\n\nDownload book of abstracts: [wpdm_file id=40]\n\nPresentations in running order:\n\n(links to Slideshare, see bottom of page for citation instructions)\n\nSaturday, 14 December\n\nWelcome - Session chairs Maria Tattaris and Urs Schulthess\n\n9:05 Opening address by T.
