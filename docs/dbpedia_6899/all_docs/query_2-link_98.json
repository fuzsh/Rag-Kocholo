        "text": "Pakistan is experiencing one of the most challenging periods in its history. During the last two decades, Pakistan's food security has been under persistent danger. The purpose of this research is to examine the impact of food insecurity and to look into the pillars of food security in Pakistan. This study asserts that Pakistan needs to concentrate on alternate food security solutions. This paper includes a thorough overview of the current situation in Pakistan, including the accumulation of these policies and coping strategies. This article concludes with the idea that Pakistan should consider other options to improve its skills and deal with the problem.COVID-19, a recent epidemic, has posed significant problems to Pakistan's food security. The necessity of ensuring food security and livelihoods has also increased. Because logistical difficulties may pose a threat to the food supply, it's critical to take steps to improve crop yields, which will help to mitigate COVID-19's socioeconomic impact. The purpose of this paper is to inject some new ideas into the discourse about food security problems. It highlights the limits of previous policy responses and proposes a new path to improve the current bleak situation.\n\nFour key factors have characterized Pakistan’s food security outlook in recent decades: i) The country’s broad development challenges mean that a significant proportion of its population is relatively poor and exposed to food insecurity, including prices shocks, such as those which occurred between 2007 and 2011; ii) Pakistan is vulnerable to natural disasters, and these have had a severe impact upon the country’s food security, in particular for the most deprived communities; iii) Pakistan’s food security challenges are often compounded by the military security problems that are found in some areas of the country; and iv) the country has experienced challenges related to political and economic governance which extend to the management of agriculture and the nutritional needs of the population. These key factors are compounded by the inflationary impact of ‘middlemen’ practices, and transportation challenges. As a result of these factors, food security has been a key challenge for the country, and in particular at a time of rising food prices. The 2018 National Food Security Policy builds upon progress in a number of social and economic areas. However, further progress towards food security involves a number of major ongoing challenges.\n\nThis paper is an overview to a collection of reviews about situation of global food supply and demand. It has discussed the major drivers affecting the demand and consumption patterns of food in the world. Despite that state of food insecurity of Pakistan has been reported and highlights the few causes of this phenomenon. Indeed, there are 852 million people are hungry in the world and that are living in the developing countries. It is required to design food policy that should serve humanity to improve the accomplishment of humanitarian goals of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. However, these goals have become quite challenging by emerging rapid increase in population growth, climate change, energy crises, credit crises, water scarcity and instability of peace. It is essentials to increase the production of high quality of food with reduced inputs to feed billions of people in the world. Hence new technologies must be developed to accelerate the crops production and focus on those traits which possessed the greatest potential to enhance the yield."
