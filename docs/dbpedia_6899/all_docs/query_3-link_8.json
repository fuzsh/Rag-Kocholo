        "text": "Read the plaudits heaped on US agricultural scientist Norman Borlaug by presidents, politicians, statesmen and the great and the good of America's industrial and commercial establishment and you could be forgiven for thinking he was a saint or even the god of American farmers. At the very least, he appears to be one of the most remarkable human beings to have ever walked the earth, a man who had created a utopia and eradicated poverty.\n\nHere is just some of the praise showered on him, mostly in his later years or after his death in 2009: \"He is an American hero and a world icon\"; \"He was history's greatest human being\"; \"He saved 1 billion people from death by starvation\"; \"He spearheaded a scientific revolution in agriculture\"; \"he brought human peace and progress\"; \"He was a true humanitarian\"; \"He helped provide bread for a hungry world\"; \"He saved more lives than any man\"; \"He saved millions of square miles of wildlife from being ploughed down\"; \"He is one of the great men of our age.\" ; \"A towering scientist\".\n\nLast week, the 100th anniversary of his birth, was declared Norman Borlaug week by international plant scientists and was marked by the unveiling of a lifesize statue of the Iowan scientist in the US congress building. A Norman Borlaug medallion was awarded to the research institution that grew from his work in Mexico 60 years ago, and the date of national agriculture day in the US – 25 March – is in honour of the man's birthday. There was a Norman Borlaug lecture, a Norman Borlaug dialogue, a Norman Borlaug summit on wheat and food security in Mexico and there is the annual world food prize, whose idea was Borlaug's.\n\nSo what exactly did Borlaug do all those years ago to deserve such praise, and does he still warrant it today? Here opinions widely differ. By successfully breeding what became known as miracle seeds of high-yielding dwarf wheat varieties, he and others launched what is known as the \"green revolution\". Yields could be doubled or even trebled with heavy doses of synthetic chemical fertilisers and other inputs. On the back of his discoveries, countries such as Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are said to have averted famines and started to export grains.\n\nThe US agricultural science establishment, chemical and agribusiness industries love him, if only because he helped their industries grow massively around the world on the back of patented seeds and herbicides.\n\nBut 60 years ago was another age. In those days, Borlaug's work was widely regarded by governments – rich and poor alike – as admirable, progressive, beneficial and even revolutionary. The green revolution offered the prospect that postwar hunger could be averted, people could move out of poverty and that rural societies – just like new wheat varieties – could grow strong and thrive on giant fields of high-yielding crops.\n\nAs we know, that never happened – and by the 1980s doubts were being aired. According to the critics, the green revolution varieties undoubtedly had averted food shortages temporarily, but, said his obituarist Christopher Reed, they had not averted poverty. In fact, they might have added to it.\n\n\"Few people at the time considered the profound social and ecological changes that the revolution heralded among peasant farmers. The long-term cost of depending on Borlaug's new varieties, said eminent critics such as ecologist Vandana Shiva in India, was reduced soil fertility, reduced genetic diversity, soil erosion and increased vulnerability to pests.\n\nNot only did Borlaug's 'high-yielding' seeds demand expensive fertilisers, they also needed more water. Both were in short supply, and the revolution in plant breeding was said to have led to rural impoverishment, increased debt, social inequality and the displacement of vast numbers of peasant farmers,\" he wrote.\n\nThe political journalist Alexander Cockburn was even less complimentary: \"Aside from Kissinger, probably the biggest killer of all to have got the peace prize was Norman Borlaug, whose 'green revolution' wheat strains led to the death of peasants by the million.\"\n\nThe jury on Borlaug is still out. The US government and the mighty farm establishment, which have been milking Borlaug's anniversary last week, have grown rich on the green revolution. They argue that his legacy is GM crops, the triumph of US technology, and the promise of even greater yields. Meanwhile, Borlaug's critics argue equally strongly that the long-term profits of his work have been reaped mainly by large companies at the expense of small farmers. There may never be agreement between the two camps.\n\nSo the last word, perhaps, should go to the Norman Borlaug Song, which should be sung to the tune of Miss Susie Had a Steamboat:\n\nMy name is Norman Borlaug,\n\nI bred a better wheat!\n\nAnd if you dare attack me\n\nYou will go down to defeat\n\nIn Minnesota!\n\nAnd even Idaho!\n\nThe farmers praise my crazy maize\n\nAnd grow it row by row!\n\nI have to go now!\n\nThe Third World's farmland calls!\n\nSo sing Yipee, agronomy\n\nWhile wearing overalls!\n\nAnd this is an excerpt from a rap by Rohan Prakash, the son of one of GM technology's greatest advocates, CK Prakash:\n\nNorman Borlaug, you may be\n\nThe greatest man in history.\n\nUsing science and your brain\n\nTo stamp out hunger, woe and pain.\n\nCreating new varieties\n\nOf plants with new technologies.\n\nYou're the man we look up to.\n\nThat is why we're thanking you.\n\nBut then some people started to panic\n\nTelling the farmers to go organic.\n\nTechnophobes started making a mess\n\nOf Norman Borlaug's great success.\n\nGreen groups thought they found the cure\n\nIn stinky piles of cow manure\n\nTelling their governments not to send\n\nFertiliser aid to our African friends."
