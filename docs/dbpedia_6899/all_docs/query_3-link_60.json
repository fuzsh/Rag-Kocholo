Unfortunately after reading this article and visiting the wikipedia page on Borlaug I found that he died a few weeks ago. Kind of sad how I had not known about someone this important. I'm sure there are many like me who had never heard his name or his accomplishments.\n\nI'm incredibly impressed not only at what he did, but why. Whether it was more to help people or just a love of science he deserves major recommendations. I agree with this:\n\nBorlaug's story is ignored because his is a story of righteousness -- shunning wealth and comfort, this magnificent man lived nearly all his life in impoverished nations. If he'd blown something up, lied under oath or been caught offering money for fun, ABC, CBS and NBC would have crowded the Capitol Rotunda today with cameras, hoping to record an embarrassing gaffe. Because instead Borlaug devoted his life to serving the poor, he is considered Not News. All I can say after watching him today is that I hope Borlaug isn't serious about retiring, as there is much work to be done -- and I hope when I'm 93 years old I can speak without notes, as he did.l\n\nDexterMorgan said:\n\nOnozuka Komachi said:\n\nshunning wealth and comfort\n\nNo wonder people don't know about him. This is a mortal sin in consumerist societies most of us live in.\n\nQuit bitching communist!\n\nTheres a difference between being forced to give your money away and choosing to do so."
