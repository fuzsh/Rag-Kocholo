The table below contains all of the statistics for both years in a side-by-side comparison.\n\nThe history of the last name Borlaug\n\nThe surname BORLAUG has its origins in Norway, with the earliest recorded instances dating back to the 16th century. It is believed to be derived from the Old Norse words \"borr,\" meaning \"evergreen tree,\" and \"laugr,\" meaning \"a small lake or pool.\" This suggests that the name may have originated as a descriptor for someone who lived near an evergreen-surrounded body of water.\n\nOne of the earliest known references to the BORLAUG name can be found in the 1593 census records of the village of Vågå, located in the Gudbrandsdalen valley of central Norway. The name appears to have been concentrated primarily in this region during its early years, with several variations in spelling, such as Borlaugr, Borloug, and Borlaugh.\n\nBy the 17th century, the BORLAUG name had spread to other parts of Norway, particularly the coastal areas. In the 1645 parish records of Kristiansand, a fisherman named Nils Borlaug is mentioned, indicating the name's presence in the maritime community.\n\nOne of the earliest notable individuals with the BORLAUG surname was Hans Borlaug (1625-1697), a farmer and landowner from the village of Lom in the Gudbrandsdalen valley. He is recorded as having inherited a substantial amount of property from his father, which he later passed on to his own children.\n\nAnother historical figure with this name was Knut Borlaug (1789-1865), a prominent member of the Norwegian Storting (parliament) in the mid-19th century. He played a significant role in the debates surrounding Norway's independence from Sweden.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the BORLAUG name gained global recognition through the accomplishments of Arne Borlaug (1867-1942), a Norwegian-American electrical engineer and inventor. He is best known for his contributions to the development of the alternating current (AC) electrical system and his work with Nikola Tesla.\n\nMoving into the 20th century, perhaps the most famous individual with the BORLAUG surname is Norman Borlaug (1914-2009), an American agronomist who is widely regarded as the \"Father of the Green Revolution.\" He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his efforts in developing high-yielding varieties of wheat that helped alleviate hunger and famine in many parts of the world.\n\nThroughout its history, the BORLAUG name has been found not only in Norway but also in other Scandinavian countries, as well as in regions with significant Norwegian immigration, such as the United States and Canada.\n\nRace and ethnic origin of people with the last name Borlaug\n\nWe also have some data on the ancestry of people with the surname Borlaug.\n\nThe below race categories are the modified race categories used in the Census Bureau's population estimates program.
