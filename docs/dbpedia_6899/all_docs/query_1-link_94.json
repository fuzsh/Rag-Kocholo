        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn studying the physical world and its phenomena, scientists pursue knowledge about general truths or the operations of fundamental laws. No science is ever a fixed body of knowledge. Scientists conduct experiments and make careful observations in an ongoing process of searching for new information. In a letter to physicist Robert Hooke, Isaac Newton paid tribute to the scientists who preceded him: “If I have seen further than you it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”\n\nThe lists below provide links to biographies of some of the major figures in science. The dates given are for their most notable scientific achievements or for the time period when they were most active in their scientific studies. The lists are divided into three main sections:\n\nScientists by Time Period\n\nScientists by Field of Study\n\nAlphabetical List of Scientists"
