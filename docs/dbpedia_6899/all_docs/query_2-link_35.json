There are numerous factors to consider. Here are some important criteria when choosing a BIN sponsorship partner:\n\n1. Experience: Evaluate the experience of potential BIN sponsorship partners in the payments industry. Given the complexity of payment programs, you don’t want to fall victim to an inexperienced partner's rookie mistakes, which can cost you a lot of money or simply endanger the viability of your program. Partnering with an experienced sponsor can help you structure your program profitably, ensuring better margins and reducing the risk of common mistakes. In addition, an experienced BIN sponsorship partner can guide you from solution design to going live, making the process faster and less painful.\n\n3. Cost Structure Transparency: Understand the fee structure, including setup fees, monthly fees, and transaction fees. There are many different ways that a BIN sponsor can make money, and it is important that you understand this to optimize your program. They can markup network fees, they can take a smaller or larger percentage of interchange income, etc. Opting for a BIN sponsorship partner with a transparent and reasonable cost structure, free of hidden fees, is essential.\n\n4. Flexibility and Scalability: Your BIN sponsorship partner should be flexible enough to support your business model and capable of scaling with your business as it grows. Their ability to support new products or expand into new markets can be an invaluable asset. An example of this may be having the ability to expand to an entire region like LATAM with a single BIN sponsorship partner.\n\n5. Partnership Approach: Seek a partner who views the relationship as a true partnership rather than merely a client-provider interaction. A partner whose interests align with your business model can foster improved innovation and provide solutions tailored to your needs. Whether this will be the case, you can perceive from your first interaction with Sales. Is the BIN sponsorship partner trying to sell you a pre-packaged program, or are they trying to understand your objective and offering solutions that will make the program feasible?\n\n6. References and Case Studies: Request references or case studies from the bank. This can offer insights into their performance and how they have managed other clients in the past. If they can’t provide you with references, maybe this BIN sponsorship partner is not ready for you yet.\n\n7. Financial Stability: It is very important that your BIN sponsorship partner be financially stable, not sustaining operating losses or depending on new capital rounds to remain viable. As seen with several BaaS providers, financial instability can jeopardize your program's ability to grow or even survive. This was seen most recently with Synapse, who filed for bankruptcy protection in April, leaving tens of thousands of consumers with frozen accounts or showing non-existent funds. A desperate BIN sponsor may be willing to take more risks than recommended and/or may “cut corners” on critical functions to reduce their net losses putting all of their programs in jeopardy.\n\n8. BIN Sponsorship Focus: Determine whether BIN sponsorship is the core business of the sponsoring institution or merely a pivot or sideline to promote their other banking or processing services. Beware of banks who have their own card programs and expand into providing BIN sponsorship as a sideline or a pivot. Your company’s payment program will be prioritized last after the banks’ own programs, or the BIN sponsorship bank could even compete with your program. In the cases where BIN Sponsorship is an ancillary business, banks may decide or may be forced to stop offering BIN Sposnsorship to focus on its proprietary business.\n\n9. Regulatory Compliance and Licensing: Your company must ensure that the BIN sponsor has the necessary licenses and complies with relevant regulations in the regions where you plan to operate. This is crucial to avoid legal and operational risks."
