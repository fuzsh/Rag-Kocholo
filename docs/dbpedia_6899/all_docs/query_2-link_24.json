        "text": "Methods\n\nStudy population and data source\n\nThe EHOP Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) of Rennes University Hospital Center (RUHC) contains clinical notes, drug prescriptions, laboratory tests, and administrative data.6,7 It also includes diagnoses coded using the French version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). With this technology, it was possible to screen the population of the RUCH to identify patients suffering from HFpEF. The patients were defined to have a HFpEF according to the reports made by their physicians (these are supposed to apply the definitions coming from the guidelines). We then extracted and analysed individual EHR data of these patients. In addition, echocardiographic data were also available; we focused on records performed between January 2017 and December 2018.\n\nA list of relevant clinical and echocardiographic variables was established. We extracted clinical as well as echocardiographic variables. For clinical variables, we extracted information from the data warehouse using either structured data (ICD-10 codes, laboratory results, etc.) or key words (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%). The echocardiographic parameters consisted only in structured data. In the face of extreme values, the individual patient file was reviewed to check these were correct. The large size of the cohort allowed us to split it into two data sets (50/50): a first one named training set and a second independent data set named replication data set. The first one has been used to perform unsupervised clustering, train, and optimize the predictive models using artificial intelligence (AI). The second one has been used to predict phenotypes similarly to what we could do in real life.\n\nStatistical modelling\n\nWe performed a two-step cluster analysis to identify common characteristics among patients. As a first step, we performed principal component analysis (PCA using the R package FactoMineR8) following by a spectral clustering to the 11 first coordinates of the PCA (using SNFtool R package).\n\nOutcomes were obtained from both data available from the CDW and from the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies. We matched first name, surname, date of birth, and town of birth if available. We collected admissions under cardiology from the CDW. We carried out a survival analysis using Kaplan–Meier curves and the log-rank test on mortality and admission to a cardiology or geriatric department.\n\nAs the final aim was to classify new patients, then we used supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the phenogroups defined by the unsupervised clustering algorithm. We optimized three algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, and random forest (RF). To avoid overfitting, we split the training data set into two sub-data sets (train and test). We trained the algorithms on the first set, and we evaluated their performance on the second one. We measured the performance by computing area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy and the variable importance of each method by using permutations.9\n\nFinally, we replicated the analysis on the replication data set. We predicted clusters with the best machine learning model and studied survival and characteristics of patients across the predicted clusters.\n\nAll analyses were performed using R version 3.6.0.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a challenging disease entity that represents a large proportion of the patients with HF symptoms.11 Up to the recent months, there have been disappointing results in clinical trials for this group of patients who have an unmet need for treatments that alter disease outcomes.12,13 It has been highlighted that this HFpEF syndrome is regrouping different types of patients.3 In this study, we looked at a large population of HFpEF patients treated in a referral hospital and identified four clusters of HFpEF patients using machine learning based on clinical and echocardiographic features. This is important for several reasons; it demonstrates the heterogeneity of HFpEF patients, the possibility to identify specific disease targets that lead to improved outcomes, and to provide individualized prognosis and follow-up plans.14\n\nTraditionally, HFpEF has been treated as one large group, and other studies2 have also confirmed different phenogroups exist under the umbrella of HFpEF.14–16 The use of AI to define and group the patients is promising as it can be done quickly and can be transitioned into care at the bedside. This study provides evidence that AI can be used to define groups of patients that differ in their clinical characteristics and that these groups have different prognoses. Further validation of this method should be carried out as it offers an exciting prospect to provide more personalized care.17,18\n\nPrevious works using the clustering methods have been published and are summarized in .\n\nTable 3\n\nStudyShah et al. 20153Cohen et al. 202024Schrub et al. 202016Gu et al. 202119Uijl et al. 202112Kyodo et al. 202320Population, number of patients397 patients + 107 patients (validation cohort). 56 variables (clinical, biological, echocardiography)3442 patients from the TOPCAT Study.

Cluster 1 had more advanced cardiac disease noted on echo parameters and a higher prevalence of comorbidities including peripheral vascular disease and atrial fibrillation (AF). This was reflected in the survival curves with the poorest survival of 80% at 2 years in this group. Cluster 2 that was a group of predominantly younger men, with a lower proportion of risk factors and surprisingly normal diastolic function despite a high prevalence of AF. These patients would probably benefit from an aggressive management of comorbidities and lifestyle measures to prevent progressive cardiac dysfunction (survival 92% at 2 years).\n\nPreviously, trials have taken all comers with a diagnosis of HFpEF, which may have led to the nulling of the effect of therapies and has left us with very little to offer in terms of treatment. Cluster 3, who are largely defined by the presence of RV dysfunction and >50% with AF, are likely to require substantially different care than the patients in Cluster 4, for example, as the patients in Cluster 4 are older, have a higher percentage of females, and have preserved RV function.21–23 Using these phenogroups, the treatments could be targeted and this may hold the key to the development of disease-modifying therapies for this population where there exists a large space to improve outcomes.\n\nHaving the ability to accurately identify patients who are more likely to have recurrent hospital admissions and higher mortality is useful for both planning frequency of follow-up and to help the patient understand the meaning of the diagnosis of HFpEF specific to their context. The clusters we identified had a large variability in rates of hospitalization and death, and this information could be useful for tailoring the care for each patient. In the patients with high rates of HF hospitalizations, early development of HF action plans may help to reduce the frequency of hospitalization, which is important in considering the cost that these admissions represent.23 Of note, according to the cluster, the location of the hospitalization is potentially different, and the risk of death is not occurring following the same trends than hospitalizations. Frailty is a component that has not been quantified but that might have been more prevalent in Cluster 4.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe clinical variable extraction from health records is imperfect because of automatic extraction, and for a non-negligible number of patients, there was poor quality or missing data. This required clinicians to perform quality control of data, which is time costly, but it can be avoided by utilizing Natural language processing techniques.\n\nImputation of missing values was done using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, which has limitations as these are not real data.\n\nPerspectives\n\nThe utility of this method is that we reliably identified four different clusters of patients who differed in clinical and echocardiographic variables, and that these differences were associated with real differences in outcomes. This phenotypical clustering method could be used for clinical trials using targeted therapies for each phenogroup and may be the key in identifying disease-modifying therapy in HFpEF."
