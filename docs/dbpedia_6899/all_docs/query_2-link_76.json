I have visited many of your links and am very impressed with all the useful and informative information you collected for us to use. I have to give credit to my sister Karen Ranveig Anderson without whom some of my geneology information could not have been shown. It is interesting how my parents created links in our names to family lines that were not traditionally those of inheritance. For example, my middle name (Osmund) is to a maternal grandfather, and my sister's middle name (Ranveig) is repeated in the female of each generation going back to Ranvig Rasmussen (Sand), my grandfather's mother. Is this a common naming tradition among Norwegian families. If anyone knows, please send me a message. Best regards.

My grandfather Sverre Ristesund was born near Brinsaughauge, Norway in 1898. At the age of 16 years he came to Howard, South Dakota. He married Matilda GUDAHL in 1918. I am hoping to hear from anyone who knows anything about the Ristesunds in Norway. I would love to talk to someone about my family. Also would love to have a pal to correspond with. Thank you.

Martin ARNTZEN is my great-grandfathers brother. He left Trondheim October 22. 1887 (twenty years old). I don't know which harbour he arrived at, but he moved and lived in the state of Michigan. The only thing I know is that Martin was back in Norway around 1900. He started out as a carpenter and started his own business with his brothers. I would like to know when he left the US on his way back to Norway and if he has some relatives left in America? Can you help me, or do you know anybody else who can? I would be very greatful if you could help me, give me some ideas, input etc. Sincerely Trine Lise Name: Annmargaret (Breiland ) Engberg\n\nWebsite:\n\nReferred by: Net Search\n\nFrom: Pass Lake, Ontario , CANADA\n\nTime: 1997-04-29 21:55:00\n\nComments: I was here a couple of months ago, when I was new to the search for my Norwegian ancestors. Thanks to Mr. Follesdal and several other helpful genealogists, I've located the place where my grandmother, Hanna JORGINE, born in 1882 came from -- the MELLEMVIK farm on the island of Donna. Her last name was not WICK, as I believed, but JOHANSDATTER. I now know her parents' names, Johan ANDERSEN, born 1849, and Oline JORGENSDATTER, born 1850. I haven't been so fortunate to pinpoint my grandfather, who was Jacob Anreas HARKVIGSEN born near Leirfjord, Nordland, June 6, 1880. He took the surname BREILAND when he came to America, and I've been told it was the name of his home. There was a BREJLAND farm in the 1801 census, but I cannot find it in the 1900 census, nor anyone in the census area with either name. I have learned to pay more attention to the farm name, first names and birthdates. I'm finding that surname spelling was not a big thing, and it can vary from one record to another, even in our local church. Thank you to all who have helped so far. If I have any relatives out there, I'd love to hear from you. Name: Richard A. Larson\n\nWebsite:\n\nReferred by: Just Surfed On In!\n\nFrom: born Minot, N.

My great-grandfather's name was Ludvig WATNE (perhaps originally WATHNE). Quite a few of these relatives have been found and visited by some members of my family. My other great-grandfather was named Berndt OIEHOL. This is a very unusual name. There are OIEs and OYEs but no one in North America seems to have that name. I found a few OYEHOLs in Norway but none have responded to my letters.
