HERE Robert Lee Brower writing for Writer’s Digest has an article titled 21 Authors Share One Piece of Advice for Writers. Maybe this will spark something for you.\n\nK. M. Allan has 7 Tips for Creating Awesome Characters HERE to help you out. It’s a good one.\n\n“Your setting is the ‘spooky background music’ of your novel.” Janice Hardy always has great stuff for writers. HERE she tackles setting with How the Setting Raises Tension in Your Novel.\n\nMy new desktop computer was installed on Friday. YAY! It was a painless process for me. Best Buy sent a Geek Squad guy (thanks, Zachery!) who moved all my files and photos and falderal from my old to my new computer and set my old computer to factory settings. I have a family who needs it, and I’m happy to give it to them. My new computer has a big enough screen for me to put up two full-size pages next to each other. That will be great for editing and page layout. I do the layout for the newsletter of the local chapter of the California Writers Club. I haven’t had much time yet to play with it, but I have to do the newsletter later today, and I am busy editing a couple picture books and one of my novels. Oh, and it is fast, fast, fast! I think I’m going to love it.\n\nThis is a week we all spend a lot of time thinking about food. I read a wonderful non-fiction book recently, one that will make readers really think about food. It is written by Peggy Thomas, someone I met at a Highlights Workshop some years ago. She is really a pro in the non-fiction category and has even written, with her mother Margery Facklam, the seminal book on writing non-fiction for kids — Anatomy of Non-Fiction: Writing True Stories for Children. If you are considering writing non-fiction, you need to have that book. Anyway, I ran across Hero for the Hungry: The Life and Work of Norman Borlaug by Peggy on the review list for Seattle Book Review and grabbed it. It is fascinating! Here is the review I wrote for SBR.\n\nNorman Borlaug grew up on a farm in the Midwest in the early 20th century. His grandparents came from Scandinavia when the potato blight chased them from their home. Norman grew up knowing hunger could devastate, and he vowed he would see as little hunger as possible. He was able to attend college largely because he was great at sports, but he focused on science and became a plant scientist.\n\nHe was hired to help find ways for Mexico to increase their crops to match the increase in their population. He worked hard to develop disease-resistant wheat and to teach the farmers in Mexico to make their fields healthier and use more successful methods. When famine struck in Pakistan and India, Borlaug fought hard to improve things there, saving millions of lives.\n\nPeggy Thomas has really done her homework, and her impeccable research and beautiful writing have led to a biography that will excite young readers and keep them engaged. The story is a compelling one. Illustrator Sam Kalda has populated the pages with realistic illustrations to complete the story. In addition, there are plenty of sidebars and some back-matter to give readers even more information."
