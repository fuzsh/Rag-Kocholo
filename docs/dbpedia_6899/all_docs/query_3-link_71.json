        "text": "This article originally ran at Forbes and has been republished here with permission of the author.\n\nNorman Borlaug, the plant breeder known as the Father of the Green Revolution, would have been 100 on March 25. (He died in 2009 at the age of 95.) I was privileged to know Norman as a friend and mentor, and whenever I met or spoke with him, I couldn’t help thinking that he possessed the kind of idealism and courage epitomized by Jimmy Stewart in the title role of “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” and Gary Cooper in “High Noon.”\n\nNorman’s life was one of extraordinary paradoxes: a child of the Iowa prairie during the Great Depression who attended a one-room school, aspired to become a high school science teacher but flunked the university entrance exam – yet ultimately went on to become one of only six people in history to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Nobel Peace Prize, for a series of agricultural innovations that averted malnutrition, famine and the death of millions.\n\nNorman’s formula for progress — science, common sense, and plain old hard work – yielded several revolutionary innovations. First, he and his colleagues laboriously crossbred thousands of wheat varieties from around the world to produce some new ones with resistance to rust, a destructive plant pest. This raised yields 20 to 40 percent.\n\nSecond, he crafted so-called dwarf wheat varieties, which were smaller than the old shoulder-high varieties that bent in the wind and touched the ground (thereby becoming unharvestable); the new waist or knee-high dwarfs stayed erect and held up huge loads of grain, boosting yields even more.\n\nThird, he devised an ingenious technique called “shuttle breeding”– growing two successive plantings each year, instead of the usual one, in different regions of Mexico. The availability of two test generations of wheat each year cut by half the years required to breed new varieties. Moreover, because the two regions possessed distinctly different climatic conditions, the resulting new early-maturing, rust-resistant varieties were broadly adapted to many latitudes, altitudes and soil types. This wide adaptability, which flew in the face of agricultural orthodoxy, proved invaluable, and Mexican wheat yields skyrocketed.\n\nSimilar successes followed when the Mexican wheat varieties were planted in Pakistan and India, but only after Norman convinced politicians in those countries to change national policies in order to provide both improved seeds and the large amounts of fertilizer needed for wheat cultivation. With a mischievous smile, Norman liked to recall one strategy that he used:\n\nWhenever I reached New Delhi the first question I was asked was: “How are the Mexican wheats doing in Pakistan?” And whenever I reached Lahore the first question was: “How is India doing with the new varieties?”\n\nTo each I always answered the same: “They are doing very well, very well indeed. You are going to have to work as hard as you can just to keep up with them.”\n\nIn his professional life, Norman struggled against prodigious obstacles, including what he called the “constant pessimism and scare-mongering” of critics and skeptics who predicted that in spite of his efforts, mass starvation was inevitable and hundreds of millions would perish in Africa and Asia. His work resulted not only in the construction of high-yielding varieties of wheat but also in new agronomic and management practices that transformed the ability of Mexico, India, Pakistan, China, and parts of South America to feed their populations.\n\nHow successful were Norman’s efforts? From 1950 to 1992, the world’s grain output rose from 692 million tons produced on 1.70 billion acres of cropland to 1.9 billion tons on 1.73 billion acres of cropland — an extraordinary increase in yield per acre of more than 150 percent. India is an excellent case in point. In pre-Borlaug 1963, wheat grew there in sparse, irregular strands, was harvested by hand, and was susceptible to rust disease. The maximum yield was 800 lb per acre. By 1968, thanks to Norman’s varieties, the wheat grew densely packed, was resistant to rust, and the maximum yield had risen to 6000 lb per acre.\n\nWithout high-yield agriculture, either millions would have starved or increases in food output would have been realized only through drastic expansion of land under cultivation — with losses of pristine wilderness far greater than all the losses to urban, suburban and commercial expansion.\n\nNorman recalled afterwards without rancor the maddening obstacles to the development and introduction of high-yield plant varieties: “bureaucratic chaos, resistance from local seed breeders, and centuries of farmers’ customs, habits, and superstitions.” About his experience in India (in the early 1960′s), he said:\n\nWhen I asked about the need to modernize agriculture, both scientists and administrators typically replied, “Poverty is the farmers’ lot; they are used to it.”\n\nI was informed that the farmers were proud of their lowly status, and was assured that they wanted no change. After my own experiences in Iowa and Mexico, I didn’t believe a word of it.\n\nIn Pakistan and Egypt, government research directors actually sabotaged trials of Norman’s seeds in order to discredit his work. As a result, people starved. As Norman recalled: “In Bombay during those terrible days I saw miserable homeless kids clustered around hotels, pleading not for money but for scraps of bread. Each morning trucks circled the streets, picking up corpses.”\n\nWith the world’s population continuing to increase, the need for additional agricultural production remains, and in his later years Norman turned his efforts to ensure the success of this century’s equivalent of the Green Revolution — the application of modern genetic engineering (also known as “genetic modification,” or GM) to agriculture. As Norman and other plant scientists realized, the use of the term “genetic modification” to apply only to the newest genetic techniques is an unfortunate misnomer, because plant scientists had been using crude and laborious techniques to obtain new genetic variants of wheat, corn and other crops for centuries. Products now in development with genetic engineering techniques offer the possibility of even higher yields, lower inputs of agricultural chemicals and water, enhanced nutrition, and even plant-derived, orally active vaccines.\n\nHowever, small numbers of dedicated extremists in the environmental movement have been doing everything they can to stop scientific progress in its tracks, and their allies in national and United Nations-based regulatory agencies are more than eager to help. Anti-technology activists have trotted out the same kinds of rumors to frighten rural illiterates that confronted Norman a half-century earlier – that genetically engineered plants cause impotence or sterility, or that they harm farm animals, for example. As Norman observed about opposition to modernizing agricultural practices in India in the 1960’s, “The situation was tailor-made for demagogues, fear-mongers, second-guessers and hate groups. We heard from them all.” They continue to spew their lethal venom today.\n\nNorman was concerned that these kinds of attacks were examples of history repeating itself a half-century later:\n\nAt the time [of the Green Revolution], Forrest Frank Hill, a Ford Foundation vice president, told me, “Enjoy this now, because nothing like it will ever happen to you again. Eventually the naysayers and the bureaucrats will choke you to death, and you won’t be able to get permission for more of these efforts.” Hill was right. His prediction anticipated the gene-splicing era that would arrive decades later . . . The naysayers and bureaucrats have now come into their own. If our new varieties had been subjected to the kinds of regulatory strictures and requirements that are being inflicted upon the new biotechnology, they would never have become available” [emphasis in original].\n\nNorman’s world-view was shaped by his roots and by his experiences as a young man. He applied throughout his professional life the lesson he had learned when during the late 1930′s he saw Iowa corn farming transformed by the advent of new hybrid corn seeds and appropriate amounts of fertilizer. These advances boosted yields from the traditional ceiling of 30 bushels per acre to an astonishing state average of 75, which in turn converted Iowa farming from subsistence to a more assured existence.\n\nNorman had been shocked by what he saw when he arrived at the University of Minnesota as a freshman in the fall of 1933: “I saw these people out there on the streets in the cold, mostly grown men and whole families too, sleeping on newspapers, hands out, asking for a nickel, begging for food. This was before the soup lines.” Perhaps as a result of Norman himself often going hungry during his childhood and college years, his modus vivendi might be summed up in several observations that he made about the importance of food and the application of science to feeding the hungry.\n\nFirst: “There is no more essential commodity than food. Without food, people perish, social and political organizations disintegrate, and civilizations collapse.”\n\nSecond: “You can’t eat potential.” In other words, you haven’t succeeded until you get new developments into the field and actually into people’s bellies.\n\nAnd finally: “It is easy to forget that science offers more than a body of knowledge and a process for adding new knowledge. It tells us not only what we know but what we don’t know. It identifies areas of uncertainty and offers an estimate of how great and how critical that uncertainty is likely to be.”\n\nNorman had a great deal of good fortune along the way, in the form of unexpected and unlikely confluences of people and circumstances, which bring to mind the observation of microbiologist Louis Pasteur that “luck favors only the prepared mind.” Norman Borlaug possessed not only a prepared mind, but one that was exceedingly kind and generous. A fitting epitaph is a line from a poem by Matthew Arnold: a man “who saw life steadily, and saw it whole.” I miss Norman greatly."
