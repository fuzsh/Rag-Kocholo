        "text": "Two hundred years ago the Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus, an English economist and mathematician, anonymously published an essay predicting that the world's burgeoning human population would overwhelm the Earth's capacity to sustain it.\n\nMalthus's gloomy forecast, called ''An Essay on the Principle of Population As it Affects the Future Improvement of Society,'' was condemned by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and many other theorists, and it was still striking sparks last week at a meeting in Philadelphia of the American Anthropological Society. Despite continuing controversy, it was clear that Malthus's conjectures are far from dead.\n\nAmong the scores of special conferences organized for the 5,000 participating anthropologists, many touched directly or indirectly on the Malthusian dilemma: Although global food supplies increase arithmetically, the population increases geometrically -- a vastly faster rate. The consequence, Malthus believed, was that poverty and the misery it imposes will inevitably increase unless the population increase is curbed.\n\nThis contention has prompted endless debate. Malthus's critics, especially the utopians of his time, have argued that man's ingenuity will always keep pace with population growth by finding improved ways to produce food.\n\nRecent assaults on Malthusian pessimism have cited the success of the ''Green Revolution'' launched in the 1950's and 1960's by Dr. Norman Borlaug and his associates in developing high-yield strains of rice and wheat.\n\nBut the scientific descendants of Malthus argue that feeding the world's masses is only part of the problem. Just as dangerous, they contend, is the omnivorous consumption of nonrenewable resources, the irreversible destruction of habitats and species, the fouling of the air and seas and consequent changes in climate, and many other effects of the growing human horde.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
