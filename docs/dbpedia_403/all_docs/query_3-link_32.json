        "text": "A Message from The Moscow Times:\n\nDear readers,\n\nWe are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an \"undesirable\" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a \"foreign agent.\"\n\nThese actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work \"discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership.\" We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.\n\nWe, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.\n\nYour support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.\n\nBy supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us."
