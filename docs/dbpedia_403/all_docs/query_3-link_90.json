        "text": "noun - A winter swimmer is an athlete who does any form of swimming that is extreme in terms of water temperature and includes ice swimming during the winter season. A winter swimmer performs exploits in bodies of water ranging from a frozen crust of ice to water under 5°C.\n\nA cold-water swimmer may be synonymous with winter swimming or Avantouinti or ice swimming in colder countries. This requires either breaking the ice or entering where a spring keeps the water from freezing over. This may also be simulated by a pool of water at 0°C, the temperature at which water freezes. Ice swimmers typically dip their heads below the surface to ensure that they are completely wet, whether or not the water is over their heads. They usually do not swim beneath the ice, as it is easy to get disoriented when turning around and not be able to find one's way back to the hole. Some ice swimmers avoid this problem by swimming from one hole to another, or by swimming under the ice while tethered to the shore.\n\nOpen Water Swimming in Antarctica\n\nLynne Cox was the first human to swim in Neko Harbor and in Antarctica without a wetsuit when she swam 1.2 miles in 2°C (35°F) waters in 25 minutes in 2002\n\nRyan Stramrood, Ram Barkai and Kieron Palframan attempted an Ice mile in Neko Harbor in Antarctica in -1ºC (30.2ºF) waters on 4 March 2014\n\nAndrew Chin completed a 1 km swim while Toks Viviers and Gavin Pike completed an ice mile in Paradise Harbour in Antarctica in -1ºC (30.2ºF) water also on 4 March 2014\n\nLewis Pugh has swum 1 km in 0°C waters off Petermann Island and 1 mile in 2°C (35°F) waters near Deception Island in 30 minutes 30 seconds, both in 2005\n\nRam Barkai swam 1 km at 70º south latitude, near Maitri, the Indian scientific research station in Antarctica, in Long Lake in 1°C (33.8°F) waters in 2008.\n\nBhakti Sharma swam 1.4 miles in 52 minutes in 1ºC water in the Southern Ocean in January 2015\n\nSynonyms\n\nExtreme swimmer, Ice swimmer, polar bear swimmer, walrus, cold water swimmer\n\nVideos of Cold-water Swimmers\n\n2017 Ice Swimming Aqua Sphere World Championships\n\n2017 Ice Swimming Aqua Sphere World Championships sanctioned by the International Ice Swimming Association, including the ice kilometer race in Burghausen, Germany.\n\n2017 Ice Swimming Aqua Sphere World Championships sanctioned by the International Ice Swimming Association, including the ice kilometer race in Burghausen, Germany."
