        "text": "WEATHER ALONG THE ROUTE\n\nThe Trans-Siberian Railway is massive – it is 9,000km long and crosses eight time zones. The whole railway runs through an area of continental climate with the only variant being from a mild continental climate in Central Russia to a Musson continental climate in the Russian Far East. The further east you go the bigger the difference between winter and summer temperatures and the lower the average annual temperature. In the Volga Region and Western Siberia, the winter temperature is normally lower than in Moscow by five to eight degrees, although the summer temperature is almost the same. In Eastern Siberia there are much less fall-outs in summer and in winter almost always frosty and sunny.\n\nBetween Chita and Blagoveshchensk the railway crosses an area of permafrost, although in summer it can be even hotter here than in Central Russia. In the Russian Far East the weather is more humid which is why even when the temperature is not very low it feels colder than it would feel, for example, in Western Siberia. In general you should not be scared of very low temperatures in Siberia in winter as due to the very dry air it feels much warmer than it would feel in Moscow. However when it’s windy in Siberia you will really feel the cold.\n\nThe best time to do this trip is probably in summer from May until September when the weather is more or less stable or from February until April when you can enjoy the transparent ice of Lake Baikal.\n\nCLIMATE ON THE TRAIN\n\nThere are lots of trains which run along the Trans-Siberian Railway - some of them are fast while others are slow, some of them are luxurious, while others are not very comfortable, some have perfect climate control while others are poorly heated in winter and not at all air-conditioned in the summer – in short there is a train for each budget. The most uncomfortable time to travel on Russian trains is possibly the inter-season period - April (when it’s hot on the train but the windows are still sealed shut) and in October (when it is already getting cold but the heating isn’t yet on full blast). However, if you are travelling on a premium train, there should not be any problem with the carriage temperature, especially if you are on a tourist train.\n\nSUMMER TRIP\n\nAs mentioned above, the best time to travel on the Trans-Siberian Railway in summer is from May until September. If you travel in May though, there is a risk that you will not be able to travel to Olkhon Island in Lake Baikal which is a highlight of the region. This is due to the movement of ice in the straight between the island and the mainland. In May it is still quite cold in Siberia and snowfall is possible. June is probably one of the best times for such a trip as you should be able to expect warm weather along the whole route and there are less tourists around. It can be really hot (30 and warmer is not unheard of) this time of the year in Eastern Siberia.\n\nHowever, one minus is that this period is when ticks are most active, especially in Siberia. July and August are the busiest months on the route - Russians and foreigners alike use this time to travel as the weather is lovely on the main part of the railway. The biggest problem at this time is booking tickets as they sell out in just a few hours, especially for the Rossia train (Moscow-Vladivostok). Travelling in summer also gives you the opportunity to combine a trip on the Trans-Siberian with a river cruise on the Yenisey or Ob.\n\nWINTER TRIP\n\nA winter trip along the Trans-Siberian is not as interesting as in summer for several reasons. Firstly, you will see just white snow outside all the way from Moscow to Vladivostok.\n\nAlso the days are really short, so if you have some stops on the way, you won't have much time for sightseeing. Another minus of a winter trip is the freezing temperature which will not allow you to walk for a long time. In spite of all these minuses, there are also some pluses - as it is low season there won’t be too many tourists on the route and tickets are much cheaper.\n\nBut the main advantage (although only in February and March) is that you will be able see winter Lake Baikal. This is an unforgettable experience as you can walk on the crystal transparent ice and see magnificent natural beauty. You can also go dog sledding, ride on snowmobiles, or even go ice skating on the lake which has become a massive natural ice rink."
