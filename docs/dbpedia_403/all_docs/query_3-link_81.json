        "text": "The coldest town in the northern hemisphere has brushed off concerns expressed by the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation over low temperatures, claiming that locals have gotten used to such extreme weather.\n\nOymyakon in Russia’s northeastern Sakha republic has been nicknamed the “Cold Pole” for being one of the coldest inhabited places on Earth.\n\n“Recently, thermometers broke when temperatures reached near-record in the Siberian village of Oymyakon,” the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation wrote with concern on Instagram over the weekend.\n\nhttps://instagram.com/p/BfREchHhiIF/\n\n“The estimated temperature that night was around minus 62 degrees. Locals said they haven’t recorded such levels in the past 15 years,” it said.\n\nThe head of a local weather service said Monday that he shared DiCaprio’s concerns over climate change but noted that winters in the region were actually becoming warmer.\n\n“We have been observing [the effects of] climate change annually since the 1980s. It is becoming warmer every year,” Alexander Arzhakov told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency Monday.\n\nThe weather expert went on to say that temperatures of negative 60 degrees were not considered unusual for winters in the region and that locals had gotten used to the weather conditions.\n\nThis year, the average temperature for February in Yakutia was four degrees higher than the norm, Arzhakov added.\n\nA Message from The Moscow Times:\n\nDear readers,\n\nWe are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an \"undesirable\" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a \"foreign agent.\"\n\nThese actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work \"discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership.\" We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.\n\nWe, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.\n\nYour support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.\n\nBy supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.\n\nOnce\n\nMonthly\n\nAnnual\n\nContinue\n\nNot ready to support today?\n\nRemind me later.\n\n×\n\nRemind me next month\n\nRemind me\n\nThank you! Your reminder is set.\n\nWe will send you one reminder email a month from now. For details on the personal data we collect and how it is used, please see our Privacy Policy."
