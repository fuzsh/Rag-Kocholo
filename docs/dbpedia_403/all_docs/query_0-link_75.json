        "text": "Future Events\n\nA Changing Arctic, Registration closes March 1, 2018 (University of Oslo). The University of Oslo will offer a course this summer on the changing Arctic. Registration closes March 1st. The Arctic region has gained increased public, political, commercial and academic interest over the last decade. High-energy prices and technological advances have made it possible, if not yet commercially attractive, to exploit petroleum resources in the area. Climate change and the retraction of the polar ice have opened new sea transportation routes, considerably shortening the distance from Europe and North America to parts of Asia. The demand for high-quality white fish from the Barents Sea is steadily rising on international markets. States, international organizations and private interests, including emerging economies in Asia, now show a keen interest in the High North and the Arctic at large.\n\n** New this week ** Communities in Harm's Way: Addressing Environmental Change and Extreme Weather Events, March 1, 2018 (Washington, DC USA). The Board on Environmental Change and Society of The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine In collaboration with Inter-Agency Forum on Climate Risks, Impacts & Adaptation is hosting this seminar to explore policy and community response mechanisms to prepare for and address threats to the built environment and local communities as a result of environmental change and extreme weather events. Speakers include Joel Neimeyer of the Denali Commission and F. Stuart Chapin, III, of the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.\n\n** New this week ** Marlene Laruelle (George Washington University): Russia's Arctic Ambitions. Domestic Factors and Foreign Policy Strategies, March 6, 2018 (Washington, DC USA). Russia's ambitions for the Arctic have been shaping the geopolitical landscape of the region, both in terms of securitization, governance, and territorial disputes. Yet many aspects of Russia's Arctic policy are based on on domestic imperatives such as that of regional development, transport and infrastructure sustainability, and challenging population management. Moscow envisions shipping routes and energy projects as a leverage for development, but several serious economic, social and climatic elements hamper these projects. This presentation will discuss the dominant role of domestic factors, and their articulation with Russia's foreign policy stances for the Arctic. This event is part of the ARCUS DC Arctic Research Seminar Series.\n\n7th Annual Fletcher Arctic Conference, March 9, 2018 (Medford, MA USA). The Fletcher School is convening its seventh annual Arctic Conference on March 9, 2018 as a platform for policymakers, business leaders, academics, and students to address the implications of a volatile Arctic. Past conferences have addressed the environmental, economic and social challenges posed, drawing upon the insights of keynote speakers like President Ãlafur Ragnar GrÃ­msson of Iceland and then-U.S. Senator John Kerry, as well as interdisciplinary expert panelists from the Pan-Arctic region. Last year, the Arctic Conference drew more than 200 participants from diverse backgrounds to engage on key Arctic issues. With this year's focus is to explore the concept of going Innovation and Sustainable Development in the Arctic through discussions and breakout panels focused on present and future concerns of the region.\n\nMethane Variation Over Terrestrial and Marine Arctic Areas (2010-2016): IASI Satellite Data, March 13, 2018 (Silver Spring, Maryland USA). There is evidence that methane is being released into the atmosphere at high northern latitudes as the Arctic warms up. Methane concentration in the Arctic lower troposphere was estimated between 2010 and 2016 with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), a thermal IR spectrometer orbiting the Earth on a satellite MetOp-A. The area studied encompasses the Barents/ Kara seas and the Wester Siberian Lowland (WSL), one of the most important methane sources in high northern latitudes. This event is a NOAA's National Ocean Service Science Seminar.\n\n48th International Arctic Workshop 2018, April 5-6, 2018 (Boulder, Colorado USA). Hosted by the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), University of Colorado The 2018 Arctic Workshop welcomes a community that includes all career stages - from student to distinguished world-class expert. The Arctic Workshop is open to all interested in high latitude environments, including those of the past, present, and future. Talks and posters on all aspects of Arctic science, social science, and engineering are invited, including Arctic and Antarctic climate, anthropology, atmospheric chemistry, engineering and infrastructure, environmental geochemistry, paleoenvironment, sociology, archeology, geomorphology, hydrology, glaciology, soils, ecology, oceanography, Quaternary history and more. If you are studying the Arctic, this is the conference for you.\n\n5th Annual Arctic Encounter Symposium (AES), April 19-20, 2018 (Seattle, WA, USA) - The Arctic Encounter, the largest annual Arctic policy conference in the U.S., will convene policymakers, industry leaders, scientists, Arctic artists and musical performers, and other stakeholders to debate and discuss emerging Arctic challenges and opportunities including policy, innovation, security, and development. The mission of AES is to raise awareness, engage challenges, and develop solutions for the future of the Arctic region and the people who live there. The 5th annual AES will take place in downtown Seattle at the Bell Harbor International Conference Center on Pier 66.\n\n2018 North by North Festival, April 23-29, 2018 (Anchorage, Alaska USA). The North by North Festival captures the spirit of Alaska and the Arctic - to address our challenges and opportunities with Northern innovation and resilience, to build on a rich history and to ensure a future full of promise. The Festival is for the North, and organized by Northerners, with goals of sustainability, livability and growth. The Festival brings innovators from across Alaska, the nation and other Arctic regions to collaborate and address local and circumpolar challenges. Through knowledge, governance, business, design, film, music, food, literature and art, we celebrate the North.\n\nCouncil on Earth Cryology, May 15-16, 2018 (Moscow, Russian Federation).
