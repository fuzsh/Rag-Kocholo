        "text": "Schools across central Russia have been forced to close after temperatures plunged to minus 36 degrees Celsius, the Interfax news agency reported Friday.\n\nChildren in the Siberian regions of Khanty-Mansiysk, Nizhnevartovsk and Surgut have been excused from classes since the start of the week due to the extreme temperatures.\n\nHigh schools have stayed open in the Tyumen, Tobolsk, Ishim, Yalutorovsk and Zavodoukovsk regions, where the weather has reached a milder 31 to 34 degrees below zero. Elementary school children are not expected to attend classes, Interfax reported.\n\nThink you have what it takes to battle the Russian winter? You Ain't Seen Snow Being Cleared Until You've Seen it Done in Russia.\n\nThis November has already brought unseasonably fierce cold and snow to Russia after several mild winters.\n\nSome 1,000 people in the Moscow region were stranded without power, heat or running waterlast week after storms cut the area's electricity supplies. Thousands more were left without power in the Vladimir and Kaluga regions.\n\nA Message from The Moscow Times:\n\nDear readers,\n\nWe are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an \"undesirable\" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a \"foreign agent.\"\n\nThese actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work \"discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership.\" We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.\n\nWe, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.\n\nYour support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.\n\nBy supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.\n\nOnce\n\nMonthly\n\nAnnual\n\nContinue\n\nNot ready to support today?\n\nRemind me later.\n\n√ó\n\nRemind me next month\n\nRemind me\n\nThank you! Your reminder is set.\n\nWe will send you one reminder email a month from now. For details on the personal data we collect and how it is used, please see our Privacy Policy."
