        "text": "noun - A Zero Ice Mile or an Ice Zero Mile is a solo ice mile performed in water temperature below 1ºC (33.8°F) as defined and ratified by the International Ice Swimming Association.\n\nIce Miles\n\nIce Miles are an officially recognized non-wetsuit ice swim by a solo individual held in water 5ºC (41ºF) or less ratified by the International Ice Swimming Association without the benefit of use of a neoprene cap or any other aid other than a swimsuit, swim cap, and ear plugs. Its shorter equivalent is the Ice Kilometer.\n\nOrigin\n\nThe term was coined by Ram Barkai of the international Ice Swimming Association in 2011.\n\nZero Ice Mile Swimmers\n\nAn Ice Zero Swimmer is an individual who has completed an ice swim of at least one statute mile in water temperature below 1°C (33.8°F).

Inhospitable to humans, but remarkably, Ger Kennedy organized a series of ice swims accessible around the ice-covered tundra to some of the most hardened ice swimmers on the planet. Antarctica 2020 International Swim was held inside the Antarctic Circle to celebrate Lynne Cox's pioneering Antarctica swim in 2002 and enable people to swim short distances or Polar Ice Miles. From Argentina, the Polar Swimming Quest set off by ship and stopped in the Bellingshausen Sea and the Weddell Sea over a few weeks. 12 swimmers entered the cold waters of Antarctica with bioprene only with three major swims safely recorded. Paul Eugen Dorin Georgescu set a world record in Hanusse Bay in 0.0°C water with 22 minute 44 second Zero Ice Mile. Two days later, Ger Kennedy swam another Zero Ice Mile in Paradise Bay in 0.53°C water and -1.10°C air in 34 minutes 2 seconds, and Cath Pendleton followed up 10 days later in Hanusse Bay with a 32:54 Zero Ice Mile in 0.03°C water and -3.2°C air. For safely organizing swims by Kathryn Pratschke, Redy Redfern, Dee Newell, Jane Hardy, Tiffiny Quinn, Michelle White, Una Campbell, Martina Ring, Anne O'Donovan, Matías Ola, and Alice Kelliher in Antarctica with the help of Sean Cullen and Dimcea Lulian Zamfir, for encouraging marine conservation awareness while encountering challenging conditions, and for enabling the extension of the known physical boundaries for everyone involved, the Antarctica 2020 International Swim by Ger Kennedy is a worthy nominee for the 2020 World Open Water Swimming Offering of the Year."
