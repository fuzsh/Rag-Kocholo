Bright modern artist Lyudmila Davydenko paints with oil paints in the original author's technique, works in the direction of abstract associative painting, sculpture and ceramics.

Lyudmila Davydenko calls the technique of drawing lines on the canvas "rhizome", which corresponds to the French term "rhizome" (lit. "rhizome", or a system of non-linear connections that expands in all possible directions at the same time, and is essentially infinite). Multi-layered, pulsating canvases with woven lines create abstract compositions, images and figures.

Each of her works is a kind of philosophical expression, the images in them are strange and amazing - they seem to have come from the world of fiction. Lyudmila's painting is able to tell about all times and phenomena, and the refined painting-plastic structure, filled with deep movement and strange illusory vibration of the surface, seems to mesmerize.

Among them are the Honoré de Balzac Award of the Alliance Française organization (2013), a first degree diploma in the art project "Abstract Art-2019" (Ivano-Frankivsk), a diploma of the international exhibition of abstract painting "ART-ACT 2019" (Chernivtsi) etc. There were more than 20 personal exhibitions in Ukraine and abroad.
