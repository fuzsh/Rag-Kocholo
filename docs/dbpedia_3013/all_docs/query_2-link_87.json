        "text": "History of Odesa\n\nOdesa before official foundation\n\nPeople began to live in the territory of present Odesa at least since the era of the Upper Paleolithic (about 50 thousand years ago). In the 6th-2nd centuries BC, the ancient Greeks founded twelve colonies here. In the second half of the 4th century AD, this territory was occupied by the Huns during the Migration Period and the colonies fell into decay.\n\nAt the end of the 14th century, on the site of the former Greek colony, a Genoese trading post of Ginestra appeared, which traded with nomads. At the end of the 15th century, the Lithuanian-Polish authorities on these lands weakened. In 1484, these lands passed under the control of the Crimean Tatars. By the beginning of the 17th century, Rzeczpospolita lost control of the Black Sea coast in favor of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, it was a small trading town of the Ottoman Empire called Kachibey or Hajibey. In 1765, the Ottoman authorities rebuilt the old Lithuanian fortress in connection with the increasing pressure on this region by the Russian Empire. In 1774, the fortress was first captured by the joint Cossack-Russian troops. However, according to the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kaynarca, it was returned to the Ottomans.\n\nDuring the Russian-Turkish War of 1787-1792, the fortress was again captured by Russian troops. The population of the town was several hundred people, mostly Ottomans and Tatars. In 1794, Empress Catherine II issued a rescript about the founding of the town and harbor on the site of Kachibey. This year is considered the beginning of the official history of present Odesa. Odessa, the new name of the town, was first mentioned in 1795.\n\nMore Historical Facts…\n\nOdessa during the Russian Empire\n\nThe population of Odessa began to grow rapidly. In 1799, it was about 4,200 people, in 1803 - 9,000, in 1812 - 20,000. The town became the main port through which grain was supplied from the Russian Empire to other countries of Europe and Asia. Odessa became known in the world as a gate to the Russian Empire.\n\nEmperor Alexander I decided that the newly conquered lands in the south needed a progressive administrator. In 1803, the Duke de Richelieu, a descendant of the famous Cardinal Richelieu, became the first mayor of Odessa. He created favorable conditions for the development of trade. For a decade under his administration Odessa received a lot of new streets and buildings.\n\nIn 1812-1813, there was an epidemic of plague in Odessa. As a result, about 10% of the population died. The dead were taken to a huge common grave outside the town, a hill that arose on the burial site received the name Chumka (“chuma” means “plague” in Russian). Today, this hill is located almost in the center of Odessa.\n\nIn 1815, Richelieu, after receiving an invitation to head the French government, left the Russian Empire. In memory of this town governor, who played a big role in the formation of the Odessa, one of the main and most beautiful streets of the city was named Rishelievska.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, the population of Odessa was about 90,000 people. It became the second largest port of the Russian Empire after St. Petersburg. In April 1854, during the Crimean War, Odessa was bombarded by the British-French fleet, but without much success.\n\nAfter the war, Odessa continued to grow rapidly, especially after the construction of the railway in 1866. In 1873, the population of the city was about 193,000 people. In the same year, a water pipeline was opened. At that time it was the most modern water supply system in Europe and the largest in the Russian Empire.\n\nIn 1897, there were about 403,000 people in Odessa (Russians - 49%, Jews - 31%, Ukrainians - 9%, Poles - 4%, Germans - 2.5%, Greeks - 1%).\n\nOdessa in the the 20th century and beyond\n\nIn 1902, the second funicular in the Russian Empire was opened. In 1903, with the help of Count M. M. Tolstoy, an ambulance station was opened. In the beginning of the 20th century, Odessa was the fourth largest city in the Russian Empire in terms of population after Warsaw, Moscow, and St. Petersburg.\n\nIn 1905, one of the greatest tragedies in its history occurred in the city, namely the Russian Revolution of 1905-1907. In the summer of 1905, one of the most famous events of that revolution happened here. The sailors of the battleship “Prince Potemkin-Taurian” raised an uprising, which was the first military mutiny during the revolution.\n\nUpon the arrival of the battleship in the port of Odessa, a crowd of sailors and locals began to loot and burn the warehouses. These events and their armed suppression caused great casualties among civilians, about 500-1,000 people were killed. Sergey Eisenstein’s classic movie “Battleship Potemkin” is based on these events. It was filmed in Odessa in 1925.\n\nDuring the same revolution in Odessa, as in many other cities of the Russian Empire, there was a wave of anti-Jewish pogroms. In Odessa, about 400 Jews were killed during the pogroms in 1905.\n\nIn 1910, the pilots Mikhail Efimov and Sergei Utochkin conducted the first flights on airplanes in the Russian Empire at the Odessa Hippodrome. In the same year, the first electric tram was launched. In 1913, a new educational institution was opened - the Odessa Conservatory.\n\nDuring the First World War, Odessa was attacked from the sea. In October 1914, the Turkish fleet shelled the city and port. The revolutionary events of 1917 brought chaos. The city experienced devastation and frequent change of authorities. A lot of residents of Odessa had to leave it.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the defense of Odessa lasted 73 days. October 16, 1941, Odessa was captured by the Romanian-German troops. Almost three years Odessa was part of the Romanian Kingdom. April 10, 1944, the city was liberated by the Soviet army. By 1948, all important port and industrial facilities were rebuilt.\n\nDespite the fact that industry and construction in Odessa actively developed, the city lost its importance as one of the most important cities in the country and received the unofficial status of a provincial city. The historical center was almost not restored, which led to the decline of many architectural monuments, cemeteries and churches were destroyed.\n\nSince 1991, after Ukraine proclaimed independence, a lot of industrial enterprises in Odesa were closed due to the severance of economic ties with the former republics of the USSR, insufficient support from the authorities, and inability to work in the new economic conditions.\n\nSince the late 1990s, Odesa has suffered significant losses because of the construction of modern residential buildings and business centers in the historical center. A lot of buildings that have historical and cultural significance are gradually declining.\n\nBeautiful architecture of Odesa\n\nOrigin of the name of Odesa\n\nThere are several versions about the origin of the name of Odesa, but the most reliable one is the assumption that the town was named in honor of the ancient Greek colony of Odessos.\n\nOriginally, it was assumed that the ancient Odessos existed near the Odesa Gulf. Later, archaeologists found the remains of this colony near the Bulgarian town of Varna located on the Black Sea coast about 400 km to the south-west of Odesa.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, in the Russian Empire, there was a tradition of naming new towns, located in the northern Black Sea region just captured from the Ottoman Empire, similar to the names of the ancient Greek colonies, which once existed there.\n\nOdesa also has a number of unofficial popular names: Odesa-Mother, Pearl of the Black Sea, Pearl near the sea, South Palmira, South Capital.\n\nOdesa - Features\n\nOdesa is located on the shore of the Odesa Gulf on the northwest coast of the Black Sea, at a distance of about 39 kilometers from the border with Moldova. The total length of the coastline of Odesa is about 30 km. Like any seaside city, Odesa is famous for its beaches, there are a lot of them, and the coastline from Lanzheron to the Great Fountain is, in fact, one continuous city beach.\n\nThe climate of Odesa is temperate-marine with subtropical features: mild winter; relatively long spring; warm, long, often very hot summer; long and warm autumn. The average temperature in January is minus 0.5 degrees Celsius, in July - plus 22.6 degrees Celsius. The local climate is characterized by a large number of sunny days (250-300).\n\nOdesa is the largest seaport of Ukraine transporting grain, sugar, coal, oil products, cement, metals, jute, timber, products of the machine-building industry. The city is also a major railway center. The main industries are oil processing, engineering, metalworking, light, food, woodworking, agricultural, and chemical industries.\n\nThe resort area of Odesa stretches for tens of kilometers along the Black Sea coast. One of the most popular resort and entertainment districts of Odesa is Arcadia. On its territory there are sanatoriums, rest houses, as well as a hydropathic institution, a resort polyclinic, a tourist base, hotels, numerous restaurants and nightclubs, other entertainment facilities.\n\nIn Odesa and near it, as well as to the west of the Dniester along the Black Sea coast, there is a group of balneo-mud, balneo-climatic, and climatic seaside resorts.\n\nOdesa International Airport connects Odesa with Vienna, Tel Aviv, Sharm El Sheikh, Istanbul, Ankara, Warsaw, Dubai, Prague, Kyiv. Passenger trains run regularly between Odesa and Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava, Vienna, Berlin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, the main cities of Ukraine, and a lot of other cities of the former USSR.\n\nThe architecture of Odesa is represented mainly by buildings constructed in the styles of neoclassicism, modernism, postmodernism, constructivism in the 19th-20th centuries. The historical center of Odesa is listed in the preliminary UNESCO World Heritage List. Odesa is famous for its picturesque streets and yards. In the city there are a lot of monuments, including very unusual ones.\n\nOdesa is one of the most important cultural centers of Ukraine. There are a lot of theaters and museums that have a long history. Many cultural figures were born and grew in this city: pianists Emil Gilels and Svyatoslav Richter, violinist David Oistrakh, singers Leonid Utesov and Valery Obodzinsky, composer Oskar Feltsman, actors, writers, artists.\n\nIn Soviet times, Odesa became known as the capital of humor. Isaac Babel, Ilya Ilf and Yevgeny Petrov, Mikhail Zhvanetsky, Roman Kartsev were born in Odesa. April 1 is celebrated as the Day of Humor - there is a parade of humor, artists and clowns perform on the streets.\n\nThe City Day of Odesa is celebrated on September 2. September 2, 1794, after the prayer and consecration of construction sites, the first piles were built in the foundation of the town. Celebrations usually last for several days, the main events take place on the first weekend of September.\n\nMain Attractions of Odesa\n\nPedestrian streets\n\nDerybasivska Street.
