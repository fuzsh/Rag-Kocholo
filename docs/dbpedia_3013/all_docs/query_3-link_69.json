        "text": "The easy answer is that Israelites disobeyed YAHAWAH; however, there is another answer, and this article will look at all the biblical twists and turns. A simple transaction where Esau, the firstborn, sold his birthright caused all the problems Israelites are experiencing today. Had Esau been honest, he would have informed his father, Isaac, about the sale of his birthright. I speak as a man; please let me know if anything is wrong with the statement. I saw a question: what tribes are the Jews in Israel today? The person who answered said that some of us are from Levi specifically; most are from Judah. He said, \"We don't care; why do you? I say the truth matters; everyone should care!\n\nThis a fantastic statement coming out of the mouth of one of the people who, in 1948, said that they are the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy: the return of Israel to their ancestral home. The peace the Bible predicted has not been realized. War, the opposite of peace, has been with the Jewish People since the inception of the Jewish state called Israel. You can check the scriptures, saying there would not be a deceitful or lying tongue among the Israelites because they would all be holy. Now, I have referred to what the Jewish People have claimed. The historical facts the world is witnessing are not in sync with the 1948 statement. Therefore, the Israelites must differ from those claiming they are Israel today.\n\nLanguage is an integral part of a people's identity. History tells us Hebrew is in the Afro/Asian family of languages. The Jewish People came to Palestine speaking Yiddish, which they disguise as Hebrew using the Syriac script. Yiddish is an Indo/European language family and ties the Jewish People to Europe when Russia defeated Khazaria in 965 AD. History says the Khazars who converted to Judaism fled to Eastern Europe. I am not a linguist; I only repeat historical facts recorded during Caliph Abd Rahman III, whose minister and doctor corresponded with the Jews of Khazaria in 954. Caliph Rahman III reigned 929 AD - 961 AD. The story of Civilization, The Age of Faith, Book IV by Will Durant, and Hebrewism of West Africa by Joseph J. Williams give a good idea of the Israelites' appearance. The Biblical reference of the physical appearance of the Israelites speaks for itself.\n\nThen, we have professors like Bernard Pares, Russian History, Language and Literature, University of Liverpool 1908 - 1918; University of London 1919 - 1936. In his book \"A History of Russia, on pages 16, 18, and 31, he speaks of the Khazars and their conversion, Jews in Kiev, and the Polish King Mieszko I, before he accepted Catholicism in 966. The Oxford Dictionary of World Religion, on page 545, Khazars: A national group originally of South Russia who professed Judaism. The Khazars were an independent Nation of Eastern Europe between the 7th. and 10th. centuries. Hasdai Ibn Shaprut corresponded with their King Joseph in 954 during the reign of Caliph Abd Rahman III. World Facts and Dates gives a clear idea of who the Khazars are, and on page 127, tells of their conversion to Judaism in 740 AD.\n\nAbove, I have quoted and given the historical view of who the Israelites are. I have also shown an extensive summary of the Jewish converts. In some of my articles, I have demonstrated the use of words like semite and antisemitism, coined in the 1860s and 1870s, to make them appear Biblical, the hallmark of the counterfeiter. These are the people and their efforts over the centuries who have tried to replace the Israelites while searching for a homeland from Alaska to Australia. These European people have colonized Israel and hope no one will ever read the Torah. The Torah and its prophetic support are the standard for the Israelites' claim.\n\nNow, let us start with Abraham: In Genesis 15: 13 Yahawah said unto him; Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and the people the Israelites serve shall afflect the Israelites four hundred years. The nation the Israelites serve shall be judged, and the Israelites will come out with great substance. Genesis 25:23 Jacob and Esau are born, and the scriptures say they are the fathers of different nations. In Genesis 27, (read the whole chapter), the blessing of the Kingdom was given to Jacob, and the sword symbolizes world domination was given to Esau. Esau is called the wicked in Job 9:24; the earth was given to him. And finally, in Genesis 35: 10, and 36: 1, they were renamed Israel and Edom, respectively. One nation will be Israelites, the Children of Israel; the other will be Edomites, the Children of Esau.\n\nJoseph was sold as a slave to the Egyptians, then his brothers and his father joined him there. The Israelites' families were in Egypt and mistaken at times for Egyptians, Moses in Exodus Chapter Two, the Children of Israel in Genesis Chapter fifty, and Paul (Saul) in Acts Chapter Twenty-one. The first few verses of Deuteronomy tell the Israelites of the blessings they will get for obedience; the latter verses talk of the tragedy that would befall them if they disobeyed. Moses prophesied that the Children Of Israel would be brought into slavery by ships. Hosea 1:10 Yet the number of the Children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor numbered. It shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto the Israelites, you are not Yahawah's people; there it shall be said unto them, you are the sons of the living power.\n\nThe works of Yahawah are impressive; every loose end is tied up. In Jeremiah 17: 4, Yahawah took the Israelites' heritage and made them serve their enemies in a land that was not their own, and in Baruch 2: 30, Israelites remember themselves in the land of their captivity. The awakening is here, which is freeking out the nations who have tried to supplant the Israelites. Israelites are Yahawah's chosen whom he promised that he would never forsake; Wisdom of Solomon chapter five adequately describes the anguish of those who despise the Israelites.\n\nA glaring example: Antipata, an Edomite, helped the Romans; The Romans made him governor of Israel. He maneuvered his way politically and made his son king of Israel. Antipata, the Edomite descendants, became the Herodian Kings. These Edomites were ruling Israel during the time of the birth of Yahawashi. Yahawashi's prediction in Luke 21:24, And they (the Israelites) will fall by the sword and would be carried away captives, and Jerusalem would be trodden down by the Gentiles until the time of the Gentiles is fulfilled. Rudolph R. Windsor recorded in his book, From Babylon to Timbuktu, on page 84, that the slave markets were full of black Jewish slaves.\n\nIn 70 AD, the governing structure of Israel as a nation was demolished. The Romans wholly took over the country. Israelites fled to Africa the same way their ancestors did. I just read the five books of Moses. The Israelites are despised because Esau has done a masterful con job. From helping the Babylonians in Hebron to setting up the Latin Kingdom in Jerusalem and the Balfour Declaration, Esau has finally succeeded. His ambition to wreck and have the world despise his brother, ISRAEL, has been realized."
