        "text": "Lyudmila Davydenko was born in the city of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Odesa region. She received her education at the Myrhorod Ceramic Technical College, majoring in \"Ceramics Technology\", and later at the Lviv Academy of Arts at the \"Art Ceramics\" faculty.\n\nMember of the Union of Artists of Ukraine.\n\nBright modern artist Lyudmila Davydenko paints with oil paints in the original author's technique, works in the direction of abstract associative painting, sculpture and ceramics.\n\nLyudmila Davydenko calls the technique of drawing lines on the canvas \"rhizome\", which corresponds to the French term \"rhizome\" (lit. \"rhizome\", or a system of non-linear connections that expands in all possible directions at the same time, and is essentially infinite). Multi-layered, pulsating canvases with woven lines create abstract compositions, images and figures.\n\nEach of her works is a kind of philosophical expression, the images in them are strange and amazing - they seem to have come from the world of fiction. Lyudmila's painting is able to tell about all times and phenomena, and the refined painting-plastic structure, filled with deep movement and strange illusory vibration of the surface, seems to mesmerize.\n\nParticipant of numerous group exhibitions, plein-air exhibitions, winner of awards and honors as a painter and sculptor. Among them are the Honoré de Balzac Award of the Alliance Française organization (2013), a first degree diploma in the art project \"Abstract Art-2019\" (Ivano-Frankivsk), a diploma of the international exhibition of abstract painting \"ART-ACT 2019\" (Chernivtsi) etc. There were more than 20 personal exhibitions in Ukraine and abroad. The artist's works were exhibited at ART ZURICH, Art Paris, RHY Art Fire Basel, so they are part of private collections in Ukraine, Poland, Germany, USA, France and Switzerland."
