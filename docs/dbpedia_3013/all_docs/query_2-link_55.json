        "text": "Russia\n\nThe U.S. spy chief said Russian President Vladimir Putin still seeks to control swaths of Ukraine beyond the eastern region known as the Donbas, after local authorities said Russian missiles struck the port city of Odessa overnight, killing one person and wounding others. – Wall Street Journal\n\nMaria V. Alyokhina first came to the attention of the Russian authorities — and the world — when her punk band and performance art group Pussy Riot staged a protest against President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow’s Christ the Savior Cathedral. – New York Times\n\nRussia’s nearly three-month-old invasion of neighboring Ukraine has been punctuated by flawed planning, poor intelligence, barbarity and wanton destruction. But obscured in the daily fighting is the geographic reality that Russia has made gains on the ground. – New York Times\n\nRussia’s foreign minister met Tuesday with the president of Algeria, marking 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries with hopes of deepening ties. – Associated Press\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Tuesday for the Czech Republic to replace Russia on the world organization’s leading human rights body following its suspension over allegations of horrific rights violations by Russian soldiers in Ukraine. – Associated Press\n\nSergey Rylov heard the thud as a Russian missile was shot down on its way toward Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, a town on the Black Sea coast of Ukraine where he’s lived since fleeing the fighting in the east a month ago. – Bloomberg\n\nBoris Johnson vowed to ramp up pressure on Vladimir Putin’s “cronies” by driving dirty money out of the U.K., as the prime minister set out an agenda that is also heavy on electoral priorities including cutting pandemic-hit hospital waiting lists and boosting disadvantaged regions. – Bloomberg\n\nThe Crimean human rights activist and nurse disappeared on her way home from work in the Russian-annexed peninsula more than a week ago. She has not been seen since. – CNN\n\nThe EU is preparing to loosen its environmental regulations as it seeks to replace Russian fossil fuels with renewable energy and imported hydrogen power. – Financial Times\n\nA Republican senator is pushing the US Treasury to tighten its sanctions on a range of companies, warning that gaps in the current regime are strengthening the hand of Russian president Vladimir Putin. – Financial Times\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought the world to the brink of a mass international famine that “will kill millions of people,” according to the lead U.S. official for global food security. – Washington Examiner\n\nLithuania’s parliament announced on Tuesday that it had adopted a resolution in which it called Russia “a state supporting and carrying out terrorism” and recognized Russia’s actions in Ukraine as a genocide. – The Hill\n\nRussian generals are being killed due to a weak chain of command during their invasion of Ukraine, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said at a hearing Tuesday. – Newsweek\n\nThe Ukrainian government announced Tuesday that all Russian assets in the nation will be seized and used to help rebuild what has been destroyed in the ongoing war. – Newsweek\n\nAfter Vladimir Putin was seen speaking Monday with a man during the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, rumors began circulating on social media that the man had been designated as the Russian president’s successor. – Newsweek\n\nThe Russian military is allegedly counting killed soldiers in Ukraine as “missing” to hide the true number of combat losses, a Ukrainian government agency said Tuesday. – Newsweek\n\nRussia’s losses during its invasion of Ukraine forced Russian President Vladimir Putin to change his goals, according to British intelligence. – Newsweek\n\nThe Pentagon on Monday refuted Russia’s claims that some Ukrainian civilians are willingly traveling to Russia. – Newsweek\n\nTom Stevenson writes: Diplomatic efforts ought to be the centerpiece of a new Ukraine strategy. Instead, the war’s boundaries are being expanded and the war itself recast as a struggle between democracy and autocracy, in which the Donbas is the frontier of freedom. This is not just declamatory extravagance. It is reckless. The risks hardly need to be stated. – New York Times\n\nTyler Cowen writes: The alternative is to speak repeatedly about Russia’s nuclear outrage and to keep the attention of the world focused on it as a special and uniquely evil event. The risk in doing so is that we would elevate Putin’s rebellion against Western norms and raise his supposedly heroic profile among those who support him. If you talk about a tyrant but don’t punish him, he may end up all the stronger. Furthermore, it isn’t obvious whether “trending on Twitter” would support such a Biden strategy in the longer run. – Bloomberg\n\nLuke McGee writes: Of course, nothing is certain until Finland makes the first move of declaring its intention. But with public approval, political support and Russia providing every reason for another of its neighbors to join its hated rival, there’s little doubt that Putin’s gambit to decrease NATO’S influence in Europe has backfired, spectacularly. – CNN\n\nJoseph Bosco writes: Of all people on earth, the Holy Father should recognize and condemn the pure evil that Putin embodies. Yet, the moral leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics has chosen to legitimize and amplify Putin’s disgustingly cynical posturing as the wronged party in the humanitarian horrors he has unleashed. Pope Francis’s position sadly betrays Pope John Paul’s heroic stance against Soviet domination of Eastern and Central Europe. It is up to the less saintly leaders of the temporal order to bring the Putin barbarian to heel and show that NATO’s bite is stronger than its bark. – The Hill\n\nCristina Florea writes: With or without Putin at the helm, Russia would likely have reemerged after 1991 as a revisionist power, just as it did after World War I. […]But first it must be completely defeated, along with Putin’s illiberal and nativist vision of empire. And although Ukraine and its allies in the West can help with the former, only Russians can achieve the latter. – Foreign Affairs\n\nSeth Gordon Benzell writes: Second, the longer the war goes on, the more the Russian government can react to and ameliorate the lack of foreign investment. One important mechanism for this might be oligarchs reshoring their wealth and investing it domestically. By going after wealthy Russians, the West may actually be accelerating this process, and thus undermining the goals of sanctions. […]Instead, the West should be doing what it can to accelerate the emigration of Russia’s best and brightest. Things are bad for Russia’s economy now, but it would be in even worse shape without the disgruntled but technically sophisticated Muscovites who Putin despises. – War on the Rocks\n\nIsrael\n\nIsrael’s top court called on Tuesday for the conclusion of a long-running trial of a Palestinian aid worker accused of funneling tens of millions of dollars in relief funds to the Islamic militant group Hamas, charges he has consistently denied. – Reuters\n\nArab politicians, organizations and media sources condemned the death of prominent Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aqla on Wednesday morning, accusing Israel and the IDF of systematic terrorism, premeditated murder and intentionally targeting free speech. – Jerusalem Post\n\nThe lack of funds has hampered the IDF’s ability to strengthen and repair security components in communities along its borders in the north and south, a new State Comptroller report has found. – Jerusalem Post\n\nOver 1,100 Palestinian family members related to terrorists have been denied by the IDF from entering Israel since the wave of terror attacks began a month and a half ago. – Jerusalem Post\n\nA plane that was about to take off for Turkey from Ben-Gurion Airport on Tuesday returned to the terminal. The pilot aborted the flight after passengers said they had received photos of aviation disasters on their mobile devices. Israeli authorities believe they were sent by nine people on board using the iPhone AirDrop function. – Jerusalem Post\n\nThe state has failed to protect its security and economic interests from wide-ranging cyberattacks, State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman said Tuesday in his annual report. – Jerusalem Post\n\nThe Islamist Ra’am party announced that it was canceling a scheduled press conference on Wednesday morning in which it was expected to announce its decision on voting with the coalition to fend off an expected legislative attack later in the day. – Times of Israel\n\nRussian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov on Tuesday left a Knesset event commemorating Victory Day after lawmakers there criticized Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. – Times of Israel\n\nA television poll has found that if elections were to be held today, parties currently in the government coalition would drop by several seats into a minority in the Knesset, but the opposition bloc of parties led by Likud would also fall short of a majority. – Times of Israel\n\nThe Likud-led opposition was still weighing Tuesday whether or not to attempt to bring the Knesset a step closer to snap elections on Wednesday. Since Silman’s resignation, Likud and other opposition party members have been vocal about their efforts to pry away additional MKs from the coalition. Reports swirled this week citing Likud sources who claimed they were in talks with potential defectors, without naming names. – Times of Israel\n\nSpeaking to The Times of Israel on Monday, France’s envoy in Tel Aviv expressed a sentiment similar to that of Israeli officials, stressing that close cooperation between the countries would continue, especially in defense and energy.- Times of Israel\n\nIsrael may be the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, but the world’s only majority-Jewish nation also enjoys a special relationship with Moscow, a relationship now under strain as a result of Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine and the competing narratives surrounding the conflict. – Newsweek\n\nBoris Epshteyn writes: The antisemitic boycotts have failed. The relationship between the Jewish state and its neighbors is thriving thanks to the Abraham Accords. And Jared Kushner has now once again made an important mark on the international stage. – Newsweek\n\nHerb Keinon writes: While this idea was much discussed in the immediate aftermath of Operation Guardian of the Walls, as the months passed – and as bureaucratic turf battles emerged – it was pushed to the side. It emerged again in the midst of the latest surge in terror. There is no need now to wait for yet another crisis – the time to actualize this idea has arrived. – Jerusalem Post\n\nBen-Dror Yemini writes: The confrontation between Israel and Hamas takes place on two fronts. The military front and the conscious one. It doesn’t matter how strong Israel is on the former front, in the end it always surrenders because of the latter. – Ynet\n\nGidon Ben-Zvi writes: By downplaying the actual source of terror, people who scan AFP’s headline might well conclude that Israel is at least indirectly at fault for the Palestinian campaign of violence, which has grown to include attacks on May 8 in Tekoa and Jerusalem Old City’s Damascus Gate, and has resulted in 19 Israelis being killed and dozens more wounded since the end of March. The AFP is the world’s oldest news agency, with news bureaus in 151 countries. As such, it should know better than to imply that there is a spiral of attacks and counter-attacks taking place in Israel. – Algemeiner\n\nEurope\n\nThe risk of Ukrainians falling victim to human traffickers will continue to increase the longer the war continues, according to the latest assessment by anti-trafficking organizations. – Washington Post\n\nAs Russia’s invasion of Ukraine grinds through its third month, gas shortages are spreading across the country, adding to people’s misery and testing their resilience in new ways. – Washington Post\n\nSeveral Jewish travelers say the airline Lufthansa discriminated against them when it blocked more than 100 people from boarding a connecting flight in Frankfurt, Germany, last week, prompting a member of the German parliament to call for an investigation. – Washington Post\n\nFor the past five years, French troops have been training at a NATO military base here, nestled among pine forests, for a conflict that seemed improbable. But Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has suddenly given a new raison d’être to the 200 or so French infantrymen posted in Tapa, a town about 60 miles from the Russian border. – New York Times\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Tuesday reopened her country’s embassy in Kyiv that was closed more than two months ago following the Russian invasion. – Associated Press\n\nAlbania’s prime minister on Tuesday visited Kosovo’s ex-president Hashim Thaci in a prison in The Netherlands, where he is being held pending trial for alleged war crimes. – Associated Press\n\nThe UK and the EU appeared on a collision course Tuesday over post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland, after London branded them unsustainable but European leaders insisted they would not be renegotiated. – Agence France-Presse\n\nFrance’s President Emmanuel Macron has revived a decades old idea with a proposal for a new form of European cooperation that goes beyond the EU, but the details of how such a mechanism would work remain murky and also controversial. – Agence France-Presse\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday warned Britain against making any “unilateral” changes to hard-fought post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland. – Agence France-Presse\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister said Tuesday Kyiv was grateful to Berlin for changing its position towards Moscow, including its stance on a Russian oil embargo and on supplying arms to Ukraine. – Agence France-Presse\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister said Tuesday that its membership in the European Union was a question of “war and peace” on the continent. – Agence France-Presse\n\nItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said allies should start work on negotiations toward a long-lasting peace process in Ukraine, even as they continue to sanction Russia over its invasion of the country. – Bloomberg\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his nation has taken “a very important” step toward the country’s path to the European Union after a Monday meeting with the secretary general of the Council of Europe. – The Hill\n\nThe Russia-aligned nation will also prepare air defense, missile units, and artillery for drills in its northwestern and western regions as Belarusian leaders fret about elevated NATO activity near the country’s borders they claim is a growing threat. – Washington Examiner\n\nThere is “credible” information that Russian prisoners of war have been mistreated by Ukrainian forces since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February, a United Nations official said. – Washington Examiner\n\nDavid Ignatius writes: Armenia has a problem that Ukrainians may eventually have to confront. After suffering so much in battle, how can a nation make peace with countries that have caused so much pain and suffering? It’s an age-old problem, especially for a nation like Armenia that has experienced genocide. Blessed are the peacemakers, even if they’re not very popular right now in a still-grieving Yerevan. – Washington Post\n\nHenry Olsen writes: Britain is our closest ally, and it’s always in our interest to have a strong and confident leader at the helm. The local elections gave Johnson a reprieve from months of scandal to show he can be that person. He needs to seize the moment before another winter of discontent convinces Britons it’s time for a change. – Washington Post\n\nAndreas Kluth writes: Scholz, the nominal addressee of the letters, remains careful — as he should — but now also tells Germans that “we cannot allow ourselves to be paralyzed by fear,” and that Putin must not win. Seventy-seven years to the week after the end of the world war Germans caused, he says, this is the meaning of “never again.” – Bloomberg\n\nHal Brands writes: So far, the U.S. and its allies have been very effective at coercing Putin’s Russia. […]Thanks to Ukraine’s incredible resistance, the U.S. and its friends have put Putin on the wrong end of a brutal proxy war. Now Washington just needs to shut up about it. – Bloomberg\n\nAlexander Stubb writes: The timing for Finnish and Swedish Nato membership has been carefully crafted. Anyone suggesting that membership should be delayed is naive, follows Putin’s playbook or has a limited understanding of the security situation in north-eastern Europe. – Financial Times\n\nAlexander Vindman writes: If peace will come only on the heels of a military breakthrough, then the United States has an obligation to help Ukraine win on the battlefield. Those worried about escalation with Russia must understand that the risks of a Ukrainian victory are greatly exaggerated. The risks of a Ukrainian loss are far greater and would entail irreversible damage to the liberal order, international law, security norms, and global stability. That is an outcome that the United States cannot afford and should be doing everything in its power to avoid. – Foreign Affairs\n\nAnna Reid writes: Not all of these dreams—of security, a thriving modern economy, returning families, well-planned new cities—are likely to come true. (Shevchenko puts the chance of a real cleanup of corrupt local planning departments at 30 to 40 percent.) But the fact that they are being discussed at all, even as a brutal war continues to unfold, shows how determined Ukrainians are to win, and how their unity and sense of identity has been strengthened by the Russian threat. – Foreign Affairs\n\nDalibor Rohac writes: But that is no reason for the European institutions and governments of the remaining 26 countries to indulge him. They must turn off the spigot and boycott Hungarian representatives in the Council — just as the rest of the EU boycotted Austria in 2000, after the far-right Freedom Party of Austria joined its governing coalition. When it puts its mind to it, the EU can play hardball. For the sake of self-preservation, it’s time that it does so now, and stop coddling a revisionist autocrat aligned with Moscow and Beijing. – Politico\n\nAzeem Ibrahim writes: Even in a time of political upheaval, the duty of the United Kingdom towards Northern Ireland remains clear. It must attempt to uphold the letter and the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, even if European intransigence indicates that these concerns are far from front of mind in Brussels. – The National Interest\n\nMart Kuldkepp writes: Everyone needs to exercise their critical and moral faculties when thinking and talking about Russia’s war against Ukraine—including about claims like the ones I’ve made in this article. Exercise source criticism, and trust the voices that have made accurate predictions in the past. But most of all, listen to the people affected by and fighting against this invasion: Ukrainians. – Foreign Policy\n\nCybersecurity\n\nA cyberattack that took down satellite communications in Ukraine in the hours before the Feb. 24 invasion was the work of the Russian government, the United States and European nations declared on Tuesday, officially fixing the blame for an attack that rattled Pentagon officials and private industry because it revealed new vulnerabilities in global communications systems. – New York Times\n\nThe chief of Spain’s intelligence agency was ousted by the government on Tuesday following the disclosure that her agency had used powerful spyware to infiltrate the cellphones of Catalan separatist politicians. – New York Times\n\nRussia’s ability to unleash devastating cyber attacks on Ukraine’s military and civilian infrastructure may have been overblown, according to a British spy chief, as Ukrainian defences prove to be resilient against some of the country’s most sophisticated assaults. – Financial Times\n\nThe White House announced on Tuesday that it is expanding its cyber policy office with three new hires, including a former Microsoft executive and a former CIA official. – The Hill\n\nThe Biden administration has forged a new agreement under which the State Department will have more ability to weigh in on certain kinds of cyber operations, according to two sources familiar with the discussions between the White House and the agencies. – Cyberscoop\n\nJason Blessing writes: Civilian oversight of military and intelligence cyber operations is important for a healthy democracy, but a lengthy bureaucratic review process hamstrings the proven operational effectiveness that protects our democracy. The Biden administration is focusing too much on oversight and control at the expense of effectiveness. Let’s hope the White House can course-correct before the midterms. – The Hill\n\nEric Swalwell writes: Instead of pushing these bills through Congress, we should take a step back and think through the unintended consequences. Forcing platforms to interoperate with untrustworthy entities or make it practically impossible for them to refuse integration with apps and other plug-ins that trade in hate speech, vaccine misinformation, violence-inciting rhetoric or low-quality products or services that increase security risks is just not the right answer. – Cyberscoop\n\nMin-hyung Kim writes: Hence, North Korea’s evolving cyber capabilities pose a new type of threat to international security. […]Simply put, both Moscow and Beijing continue to supply Pyongyang with training, technology, and materials support for its cyber operations. This kind of cooperation in the axis of the northern cyber powers is likely to continue as the three authoritarian allies who support cyber sovereignty as opposed to cyber freedom have a common goal of weakening U.S. hegemony, in general, and U.S. cyber supremacy, in particular, and the world moves towards a new Cold War era. – The National Interest\n\nDefense\n\nA US Navy SEAL jumps out of a Romanian helicopter and slides down a rope. He’s one of several American special forces units taking part in a military drill on the Black Sea, just 100 miles from Ukraine, where Russia continues to wage its war. – CNN\n\nHalf of the Navy’s littoral combat ship fleet is suffering from structural defects that have led to hull cracks on several vessels, limiting the speed and sea states in which some ships can operate, according to internal records obtained by Navy Times and confirmed by sea service officials. – Defense News\n\nNew aviation platforms and gear that link Marines across the sea-air-land are shifting how Marine aviation heads into the next fight. – Defense News\n\nReestablishing the 11th Airborne Division in Alaska could entail cutting Stryker vehicles from a brigade there and adding personnel to create an operational headquarters. – Defense News\n\nOfficials spearheading the U.S. Army’s development and deployment of upgraded network tech and tools are pursuing multiple layers, multiple functions and multiple bands, seeking a resilient network for relaying intel that can withstand the challenges of warfare. – Defense News\n\nThe sophisticated threats Russia and China pose are a radical departure from those faced for years in the Middle East and underline the need to rapidly upgrade military networks and information sharing capabilities, the U.S. Army’s chief information officer said. – Defense News\n\nThe Marine of 2030 will be a digital native, born into the age of the Internet of Things and raised with drones, virtual reality goggles and maybe even 3D printers at home — making the commandant of the Marine Corps comfortable they’ll be able to manage a battlefield swirling with information. – Defense News\n\nThe Space Force released its vision for integrated testing of satellites, sensors, ground systems and other capabilities, laying out a plan to develop the organizations and infrastructure needed to operate in an increasingly contested environment. – Defense News\n\nTwo members in Congress have heard the Marines’ call for more amphibious warships and issued a House bill that would cement their level at 31, according to language reviewed by USNI News. – USNI News\n\nBut President Joe Biden’s 2023 budget proposal cuts funding for the center, which could put 120 jobs on the line; make a recent $25 million military construction project for a new hangar useless; and, ultimately, close one of the largest regional installations for reserve air combat exercises. – Military.com"
