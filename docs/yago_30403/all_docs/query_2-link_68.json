Maria Sophia Christine Elisabeth TiedtMaria was born on November 16, 1841, in Mankmoos, Amtsgericht Warin, Landgericht Güstrow, Grandduchy of Mecklenburg -Schwerin.

She died as a child on April 3, 1847, at the age of 1. Sophia Elisabeth Dorothea Marie TiedtSophia was born on September 18, 1848, in Mankmoos, Amtsgericht Warin, Landgericht Güstrow, Grandduchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She married Rudolph Messerly on April 24, 1870. Sophia died on 31, 1929, at the age of 81. Lisette Friederike Sophia Maria \"Lizzie\" TiedtLizzie was born on October 17, 1851, in Mankmoos, Amtsgericht Warin, Landgericht Güstrow, Grandduchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She married Phillip C. Davis on March 23, 1870, in Waverly,Bremer County,Iowa,.\n\nJohann and Lena immigrated with their family to the United States in 1855, first settling in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. They then moved to Bremer County Iowa. He eventually became one of Bremer county's most prosperous farmers and at the time of his death was treasurer of the of the Wapsie Valley Creamery of which he was one one of the founders.\n\nJohann died on November 24, 1871, in Bremer County, Iowa, at the age of 66. Lena died on November 4, 1884, in Bremer County, Iowa, at the age of 75.\n\nThis 1894 map of Maxfield Township, Bremer County, IA shows 2 80-acre parcels in Section 7 owned by John and Henry Tiedt. Most likely this was the original 160-acre homestead of Johann Christian Tiedt. Johann Christian died in 1871, and it is likely that his two sons Johann Franz and Heinrich Frederick each inherited 80 acres of the homestead. Johann Franz died in 1893, the year before this map was published, so it is most likely it is his son John who now owns this 80-acre parcel.\n\nThis Historic 1894 map of Franklin Township, Bremer County, Iowa shows 2 additional 80-acre parcels in Section 7 owned by John Tiedt, which connect at the southwest corner to the Maxfield Township acreage owned by John. According to family historian/reasearcher 'cousin' Don Leistiko, Johann Christian purchased 120 acres in Bremer County for $1,200 in 1865, a few years after his son Johann Franz Tiedt was mustered out of the army with a disability. This was six years before Johann Christian died, so it might be that this Franklin Township acreage is where Johann Franz lived when he married in 1865 and started his family. There is a house shown on this property (though the Franklin Township property totals nearly 160 acres, not 120). In any case, Johann Franz likely inherited this farm when his father died, and it probably passed to his son John who in 1894 owned both the Franklin and the Maxfield Township farms. Johann's brother Christian Tiedt also died not long before this map was published, and his second wife Marie (Piehl) Tiedt is shown as owning their family farm in Sections 18 & 19. Most likely it is Maria's nephew, Henry, son of her brother Henry (Hienrich) Piehl who owns the 120-acre parcel in Sections 29 & 30. Henry J. Tiedt owns 200 acres in Section 10, and is likely Christian's oldest son. Leopold Leistikow, who married Christian's sister Sophie, owns a 320-acre farm in Sections 19 & 20, and hs son Fred owns an adjoining 40-acre parcel.\n\nMaxfield Township on left and Franklin Township on right. Blue dash line separates townships. In 1894 Henry J Tiedt b 1862 owned 200 acres in section 10 in Franklin Township, Bremer County Iowa. By 1917 Christ F. Judas, Henrys sisters husband, owns this land and Henry J. Tiedt owns land in Section 15 and 16.\n\n(My thanks to Sue (Tiedt) Rife for supplying this later map, and the Warranty Deed documenting the purchase of the land by Christian Tiedt in 1868.)"
