        "text": "Charles II, Elector Palatine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II,_Elector_Palatine) was the cousin of OTL George I of Great Britain, and (please correct me if I'm wrong) would have been the heir to Queen Anne Stuart instead of his Aunt, Sophia of Hanover.\n\nIOTL, he died childless in 1685 at the age of 34. What if he had survived and he, or a son, lived long enough to succeed Anne? By Anne's death in 1714, Charles would have been 63 years old, as opposed to George who was 54 and who passed away at the age of 67. Another consequence of his death was that the Electorate of the Palatinate passed to his Catholic cousin, Philip William of Neuburg.\n\nEDIT: Charles was married to Princess Wilhelmina Ernestine of Denmark, but the marriage was unhappy and Charles' father was considering divorcing the two before his death. I imagine, if not for his death, the younger Charles would have divorced her and married someone else. Three candidates I found were:\n\nElisabeth of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_of_Mecklenburg-Güstrow)\n\nFredericka Elisabeth of Saxe-Eisenach (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericka_Elisabeth_of_Saxe-Eisenach)\n\nAnna Sophie of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Sophie_of_Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg)\n\nCharles II, Elector Palatine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II,_Elector_Palatine) was the cousin of OTL George I of Great Britain, and (please correct me if I'm wrong) would have been the heir to Queen Anne Stuart instead of his Aunt, Sophia of Hanover.\n\nIOTL, he died childless in 1685 at the age of 34.

The other alternative is plausible is for Charles to marry Princess Frederica Amalia of Denmark, the one-year older sister of Princess Wilhelmina Ernestine of Denmark.\n\nIOTL, Frederica Amalia was married at Glücksburg Castle on 24 October 1667 to Duke Christian Albert of Holstein-Gottorp as part of a peace treaty between Denmark and Holstein-Gottorp, but the hostile parties continued to fight. The marriage was unhappy, with Frederica Amalia often tormented by the frequent disagreements between her brother, Christian V of Denmark, and her spouse.\n\nEven after it was reportedly well known, that Frederica Amalia was being badly treated by Christian Albert, she still had four children with him.\n\nIf you have the Peace Treaty, fall through, which, again is not implausible, as stated above, even after the marriage the Denmark and Holstein-Gottorp continued to fight.\n\nThen I could see this being a better match.\n\nPrince Charles of Palatinate was born, 31 March 1651, the son of Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine and his second wife, Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel, as a boy, Charles was of a weak and timid nature, marked by familial childhood experiences. He showed a superficial enthusiasm for military life.\n\nOn 24th October 1666, his aunt, Electress Sophia of Hanover, arranged his marriage to Princess Frederica Amalia of Denmark, daughter of King Frederick III of Denmark.\n\nThe couple visited her sister, the Swedish queen Ulrika Eleonora, often, with Charles being able to set up a trade agreement for his country with Sweden.\n\nOn one such visit, in April 1685, the 34 year old, Prince Charles, came down with, what he believed was a minor ailment, it was only at the demand of Queen Ulrika Eleonora, that he allowed Urban Hjärne, a Swedish chemist and physician, to access him; Hjärne, was able to diagnose the problem and provided the young Elector, with medicine.\n\nOn 23 April 1702, the 51 year old Prince-Elector Charles II, his wife Princess Frederica Amalia, along with their son, Prince Frederick (30) and his wife, Hedvig Sophia, daughter of King Charles XI of Sweden, Prince Charles (29) and Princess Elizabeth Marie (23), attended the coronation of Queen Anne of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nThe royal family was invited by Lord John Somers, 1st Baron Somers, a former Lord High Chancellor of England, who hoped to see a successful Protestant succession, as it was plainly seen, but publically unspoken of that the new lame and obese queen, would not conceive a heir to the throne.\n\nWhig politicians believed Parliament had the right to determine the succession, and bestow it on the nearest Protestant relative of the Queen, while many Tories were more inclined to believe in the hereditary right of the Catholic Stuarts, who were nearer relations.\n\nIn 1710, Prince-Elector Frederick VI announced that he would succeed in Britain by hereditary right, as the right had been removed from the Stuarts, and he retained it. \"This declaration was meant to scotch any Whig interpretation that parliament had given him the kingdom and convince the Tories that he was no usurper, as his paternal great-grandmother, was Princess Elizabeth of England, daughter of James I, King of England\"\n\n\"By the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, Archtreasurer and Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire,\n\nPrince of Palatinate, King Frederick I and VI.\"\n\nPrince of Palatinate, Frederick VI was crowned as the new King of Great Britain on 20 October 1714, following the death of Queen Anne on 1 August 1714.\n\nAnd so began the House of Wittelsbach rule of the British Isles.\n\nThe thing with Wilhelmine was that AFAIK she was lame/cripple/disable and it affected her ability to bear children. She also came with a ridiculous dowry almost as though to compensate for it. In the beginning stages of Apollinis et Dianae, someone actually proposed switching her and her sister, Ulrike's fates. That way, even if his bride is ugly (if not disabled per se), momma's boy Carl XI will soldier on until he gets a son or she dies, and Karl gets a prettier wife with whom he might be more inclined to have kids.\n\nThis someone was me. We ended up just killing Wilhelmine, though."
