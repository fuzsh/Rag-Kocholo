        "text": "Christian VI (born Nov. 30, 1699, Copenhagen—died Aug. 6, 1746, Hørsholm, Den.) was the king of Denmark and Norway, son of Frederick IV of Denmark and Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, who ascended the throne after his father’s death.\n\nTolerably gifted, he became a diligent and conscientious ruler, choosing able administrators; but he was shy, reserved, and unprepossessing in appearance. Like his consort, Sophie Magdalene of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (1700–70), he was imbued with German pietism and devoutly encouraged a pietistic national church. Frivolous amusements were banned at court, but the royal couple’s love of splendour led to costly buildings, such as Christiansborg Castle (built 1733–45). In 1733 he reestablished the national militia but acceded to the landowners’ demand that peasants who were conscripted were bound to return as tenant farmers to the estates on which they were born. Christian’s foreign policy was pacific, and he succeeded in forming alliances with Sweden, England, and France."
