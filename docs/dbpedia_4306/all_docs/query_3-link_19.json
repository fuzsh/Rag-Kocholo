From the time when Chinese autonomist retreated to Taiwan, this little island has transformed itself quite differently from the China. Thanks to a series of financial and economic reform by the Nationalist Party, Taiwan got a head start on economic and democratic development. Taiwan had been benefited from rapid industrialization and GDP escalation that brought about Taiwan Miracle during the latter half of the 20th century, thus fetching one of the \"Four Asian Tigers\" in conjunction with Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong. There are many reasons behind Taiwan’s progress. Strong external financial position. Support for R&D via public spending, Established democratic principles and practices, World’s fourth-largest electronics producer, improved relations with mainland China and many more are the strong parts that actually make the country different from others. There are also some of limitations in Taiwan. Amongst them; foreign trade too concentrated on China, immense relocations undermining industrial employment, Lack of services sector competitiveness, Infrastructure development lagging compared to other Asian economies are gravely weaknesses in this particular country. Taiwan is one of the most countries out there in the world that actually managed to preserve an average of 5% growth over past few years.

It was tough to find those problems in websites but we tried to find invisible risk of Taiwan. Cronyism: Most Taiwanese business is conducted among friends, friends of friends, and family. Such connections or \"guanxi\" (pronounced gwan-she) are developed with people at your own level or of a higher status in both business and social situations. \"Guanxi\" opens doors, smoothes out problems, and leads to even more connections. Taiwan is a rotten country, Taiwan's CPI (Corruption Perception Index, by Germany based Transparency Int'l) rankings in recent 3 years are worse than those in 1998-2000 by about 8-9 positions in average. Corruption in Taiwanese officials field is even worse ( more serious ) than that in China's officials circle in last year, and about same score as China this year, according to a survey by PERC , which was reported by most Taiwan's news media. Corruption is not only throughout Taiwan's military, police, education systems, Parliament/legislation, Public officials/civil servants, political parties, religious circles, media, also lies in the judiciary & high court judges. The reasons Taiwan had not really held a large anti-corruption campaign also include: (1) Taiwan government is afraid of loss in political elections. (2) The arrested suspects may disclose many more (other) \"partners\" implicated in the case, so that Taiwan government can't handle it well.\n\n10. 9 Country risk analysis on Taiwan The finding of the 2013 Global Corruption Barometer (GCB), ( the Gallup Poll to interview 114,000 people in 107 countries all over the world): 36% of people (surveyed in TW) who had used any of eight government services in the past year had paid a bribe (the number is higher than global average). Taiwan's worst corruption units: (1) The came-out worst corruption institution: the Legislative Yuan (75 % of respondents feeling the institution was affected by corruption) (2) The political parties (74%) (3) Taiwan's media (62%) (4) Judiciary (57%) (5) Police, the military, public officials and civil servants all finishing at 56 percent (6) Non-governmental organizations (31%) One of the principal human rights problems reported in Taiwan 2012 was judicial corruption. “Although the authorities made efforts to eliminate corruption and diminish political influence in the judiciary, some residual problems remained,” the report said. The report also said that political commentators and academics had publicly questioned the impartiality of judges and prosecutors involved in high-profile and politically sensitive cases.\n\n11. 10 Country risk analysis on Taiwan Foreign Direct Investment Statistics Statistics on foreign direct investment in Taiwan are available from two official sources: the Investment Commission (IC), and the Central Bank (CBT). The IC publishes monthly and yearly foreign investment approval statistics by industry and by country. While these statistics do not correspond exactly to actual commitments of investment funds, AIT believes these data serve as a good proxy. CBT publishes foreign direct investment arrivals on a quarterly and yearly basis. CBT data contained in balance-of-payments (BOP) statistics are not classified by industry or country. As of the end of November 2011, Taiwan's total stock of foreign direct investment stood at US$155.8 billion (valued at historical cost). This represents about 33.1% of Taiwan's 2011 GDP. Total FDI inflows for the first eleven months of 2011, based on approvals, stood at US$4.5 billion, or about 1% of 2011 GDP. As of November 2011, Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves amounted to US$388 billion, the fourth-largest in the world. After experiencing a robust growth of 10.72% in 2010, buoyed partially by a low-base year effect due to the global economic downturn in 2009, Taiwan's GDP trended down in the first three quarters of 2011. Overall GDP in 2011 is expected to grow by 4.51%, according to official forecasts. Inbound foreign direct investment approved from January to November of 2011 increased 34.6% year-on-year. In recent years, foreign direct investment has shifted from capital-intensive high-tech industries to investments in the financial service sector. Approved direct investment in electronics industries (including electronic parts and components, computers, communications, semiconductor, TFT-LCD and other optical electronic products), which peaked at 48.2% as a percentage of FDI in 2006, declined steadily to 12.8% in 2010. Meanwhile, the percentage share\n\n12. 11 Country risk analysis on Taiwan of FDI for financial services increased from 34.3% in 2006 to 39.7% in 2010. In the first eleven months of 2011, nearly 75% of approved inbound direct investment in Taiwan’s electronics industries came from the Hong Kong, the United States, and the British Territories in North America (BTA). Nearly 70% of approved inbound direct investment in the financial and insurance sectors came from Singapore, the United States, and the BTA. According to official Taiwan statistics, approvals for U.S. investment from 1952 to 2010 totaled US$21.6 billion (US$20.9 billion according to official U.S. figures), or 19.5% of total foreign investment. These aggregate figures of investment stock are valued at historical cost. In the first eleven months of 2011, 63.8 percent of U.S. total investments in Taiwan went to the service sector. Approvals for Japanese investment from 1952 to 2010 amounted to US$16.5 billion, or 14.8% of total foreign investment. As the tables below indicate, significant FDI now flows from the tax havens of the British Territories in North America, which harbor a growing number of multinational corporations, including those with Taiwan roots. Fifty-two percent of the investment from the BTA was directed towards financial services, real estate and wholesale and retail trade industries. As a relatively open and liberal economy, Taiwan not only benefits from substantial foreign investment but also has significant investments overseas. According to balance-of-payments statistics compiled by the Central Bank, outbound direct investment has exceeded inbound direct investment every year since 1988. According to IC statistics, by 2010, cumulative approvals for outbound investments totaled US$162.9 billion. The main recipient has been the PRC, which has received nearly 60% of Taiwan’s outbound investment. Approved investments to China almost doubled in 2010 compared to the previous year. As of the November 2011, Taiwan firms hold investments estimated in excess of US$110 billion on the mainland, though some other estimates suggest the figures could be from US$150 billion to US$300 billion. Taiwan business firms have been relocating their production bases to China since the late 1980s. The WTO accessions of the PRC and Taiwan in 2002 prompted Taiwan business firms to accelerate this relocation to sharpen their competitive edge in exports. Taiwan factories based in China use the lower labor and land costs to process Taiwan-made production inputs into finished\n\n13. 12 Country risk analysis on Taiwan goods for exports to such industrial markets as the United States, Japan and Europe, and also for final sale in China. Recently however, rising labor and land costs on the mainland have prompted some Taiwan firms to move from China to economies in South and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam. Many Taiwan firms have also shifted to producing higher value-added goods and higher-tech products in China. Taiwan's annual registered direct investment across the Taiwan Strait grew from US$1.25 billion in 1999 to US $14.6 billion in 2010. As a result of this trend, Taiwan factories in China produced slightly over 50% of export orders received by Taiwan companies’ headquarters by late 2010, up from 11.5% in early 2000. The ratio is closer to 85% for information technology (IT) firms. China, including Hong Kong, replaced the United States as Taiwan's largest export market in 2001, and its share of Taiwan's exports in 2010 was 41.8%, compared to 12% for the United States and 11% for the European Union.

Most of the crimes occur in the metropolitan areas. The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) is not aware of any specific threats directed against American citizens or U.S. government personnel.1 According to world ranking, Taiwan is ranked fourth low risk country. Organized crime There are several prominent organized crime (OC) organizations in Taiwan. The four largest are United Bamboo Gang, Four Seas Gang, Celestial Path Alliance Gang, and Songlian Gang.\n\n17. 16 Country risk analysis on Taiwan Organized crime and gangs in Taiwan remain involved in local politics and businesses, particularly in central and southern Taiwan. Their influence extends to the waste disposal, construction, cable TV, communications, stock trading, entertainment, gambling, loan sharking, debt collection, and prostitution industries. Due to aggressive law enforcement actions in the past, the major OC organizations have devolved into local units that have their own management structures and business interests; however, local units of the same organization will collaborate to accomplish a goal. While the major OC groups do not engage in drug trafficking, Taiwan's many street gangs do. Taiwan's organized crime groups and street gangs rarely target the emigrant community. Area Centric Criminal Activities Although the overall violent crime rate in Taiwan is low, visitors should avoid high crime areas, namely areas where massage parlors, barbershops, and nightclubs operate as covers for prostitution and are often run by criminals. In contrast to these illegal fronts, ordinary barbershops and other legitimate businesses prominently advertise their services, and visitors can see the interiors through storefront windows. Illicit establishments generally do not advertise, and casual passersby cannot view their interiors. Several U.S. citizens have been assaulted in these establishments and in the areas near bar and nightclub districts. Taiwan’s public buses and subway are generally considered safe, but passengers in taxis – particularly women - should exercise caution when traveling alone in taxis late at night. In several parts of Taiwan, incidents of purse snatching by thieves on motorcycles have been reported. Visitors should keep a photocopy of their passport, other identification, and credit cards in a safe place. Actions of the Law Enforcement Agencies Taiwan's police and law enforcement personnel are very well trained and professional. They support the foreign victims very perfectly for the reimbursement. The Foreign Affairs Police, which is a division of the National Police Agency, is responsible for crimes involving foreigners. English-speaking Foreign Affairs police officers assist foreigners with a wide variety of law enforcement matters. The Foreign Affairs Police has English-speaking\n\n18. 17 Country risk analysis on Taiwan police officers at all major police precincts during normal working hours. The Foreign Affairs Police also maintain a 24-hour service center that is staffed by English-speaking officers around the clock. In Taipei, the Foreign Affairs Service Center can be reached at any time. So if anyone faces any problem then he will have less hassle while getting legal support. Road Safety in Taiwan Taiwan's metropolitan areas often see major traffic jams, which is why many people opt for the scooters which are visible in abundance on Taiwanese roads. Although scooters allow visitors to weave in and out of traffic and get from point A to point B faster than other means, this sort of erratic driving does make for chaotic traffic, especially at peak hours, and bicycle and scooter accidents are common. Added to the confusion are ongoing repairs and extensions of the MRT underground system, as well as highway overpasses, have resulted in congestion at peak hours. All passengers in all vehicles are required to wear seatbelts. The highways in western and northern Taiwan are usually in good condition; however those in eastern Taiwan are sometimes in disrepair. Road closures due to flooding are not uncommon in typhoon season. Fraudulent Activities in Taiwan Taiwan is a very safe country and violent crime against foreigners is a rare occurrence. Expats in Taiwan, particularly in metropolitan areas like Taipei, should exercise basic precautions as in any large city, such as being aware of personal belongings in crowded markets. It is safe to walk around or catch public transport at night, especially if you do not do so alone or in very isolated areas. The police are genuinely helpful and people are kind – if anyone is a foreigner in distress on the street, within seconds someone will come to them for aid. Guns are outlawed and genuinely rare, although some gangsters do have them. When crime takes place, it is almost always between\n\n19. 18 Country risk analysis on Taiwan people who know each other and have a score to settle – as a foreigner, they are very unlikely to get caught up in anything dangerous. Pick Pocketing in Taiwan Crowded public areas such as markets and public transport hubs are often targeted by pickpockets and occasionally even bag snatchers. In these areas, expats should be careful not to carry valuable items in open bags and should wear fanny packs or bags in the front of them. Bag snatching from motorcycles also happens occasionally. The usual rules of travel apply - keep photocopies of passports and other important documents in a safe place, and if possible carrying the photocopies themselves in place of the original documents is indeed a better contingency. Scams in Taiwan The main kind of crime in Taiwan that expats should be aware of is scams. Credit card fraud is common, as is telephone fraud, where the scam artist will call the victim and claim to be from a government department, bank or other official office and request personal information such as bank details. ATM fraud is also a risk – when using ATMs, awareness must me needed to avoid scams from strangers. Unique Cultural Issues Taiwan could be said to be a hybrid blend of cultures that has been largely shaped by processes of imperialism and colonization. At various times the people of Taiwan have been ruled by the Dutch, Chinese, Imperial Japanese, postwar China and even, arguably, the United States. An autonomous state now, the culture of Taiwan still bears the marks of these foreign powers as it continues to struggle to find it owns conception of a national identity. Religion in Taiwan The prevalent form of religious belief in Taiwan is the traditional Chinese blend of Buddhism, Daoism, and Chinese folk religion, including ancestral worship. However, there are also large numbers of devotees to each of these belief systems. Confucianism remains a major influence on\n\n20. 19 Country risk analysis on Taiwan personal philosophy and ethics. The government on Taiwan has continued the tradition of honoring Confucius and his lineal descendants. It is safe to say that every major world religion has some followers in Taiwan. Taipei in particular will be home to the overwhelming majority of these communities. Christian churches have been active in Taiwan for many years, the majority of which are Protestant. 2.6% of the population identify themselves as Protestant, with Presbyterians playing a particularly significant role. With the recent influx of immigrants from Malaysia and Indonesia there is also an active and growing Islamic population in Taiwan. Several organizations, especially Buddha’s Light International Association and Tzu Chi, have extended their operations around the world. There are frequent contacts between Matsu temples in Taiwan and those in Fujian on the mainland. Likewise, there are close contacts between Buddhist organizations in Taiwan and those on the mainland. Popular Culture in Taiwan The 1990′s and early 2000′s saw the emergence of bands and artists of diverse styles, such as LTK Commune, Labor Exchange Band, Chairman, Sugar Plum Ferry, Medicine Jar, Backquarter, Ladybug, Feiwu, Sodagreen, Deserts Chang, Fire EX, 8mm Sky, and ChthoniC. The annual Formoz Festival, Spring Scream, and Hohaiyan Rock Festival are representative gatherings within Taiwan’s music scene. Of these, Formoz Festival is notable for its international draw, with foreign artists such as Yo La Tengo, Moby, Explosions in the Sky and Caribou headlining the event, while Spring Scream is the largest local band event, and Hohaiyan draws a mixed crowd of beach side party-goers and music appreciators alike. Recent Taiwanese popular singers/bands include Cyndi Wang, S.H.E, 5566, Rainie Yang, Da Mouth and much more. The popular culture of the Taiwanese people has also influenced Chinese-speaking populations in other countries such as China, Malaysia and Singapore. For instance, a significant band, May Day has taken these countries by storm.\n\n21. 20 Country risk analysis on Taiwan Internet cafes, also known as “Wang Ka”, are very popular with the younger generation who spend endless hours playing online games. It has reached a point where many parents and teachers are concerned with the amount of time youth spend in the virtual world. The Taiwanese movie director Ang Lee is also popular in the West (his movies include Lust, Caution, Brokeback Mountain, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). Musical artists such as Jay Chou, Alan Luo, Jolin Tsai and David Tao have gained international fame performing throughout Asia. Taiwan is also known for its many TV game shows, some of which are so popular that they are aired across Asia and some Western countries. Anime and manga comics are also very popular in Taiwan. It is common to see a manga rental shop or a manga store every couple of streets in larger cities. Personal threats As we said earlier that Taiwan pretty safe country for investment still there are some of violent crimes which is increasing against foreign investors in Taiwan. so therefore travelers should consider some carefulness and take personal security countermeasures appropriate to any major metropolitan city. One should give awareness to personal belongings in crowded areas, such as night markets and during large-scale public events, where pick pocketing and petty theft is more likely to happen. Residential thefts do occur, particularly in buildings without 24-hour security coverage.  There are some of ethnic Taiwanese criminal groups also have appeared in the geographical areas under study here. Taiwanese organized gangs had diversified significantly in activity and spread to other parts of the world. They organize countless of criminal activities throughout the country. So, before entering into Taiwan businesspeople has to comprehend the whole scenario and question themselves whether they can survive there or not if not then they should not consider Taiwan as there as investments.\n\n22. 21 Country risk analysis on Taiwan  Scam is common throughout Taiwan. The doer of the fraud influences the victim to provide personal banking information or want large amounts of cash to the caller by stating that the victim's funds are involved in criminal activity and they represents themselves as very important personnel. It is one example of many frauds which are usually practiced in Taiwan.  If you consider political unrest, Taiwan does not have any records of terror campaign, large conflicts between parties or civil unrest. Taiwan is a full-fledged democratic country.  Now if we consider the road safety, major highways throughout Taiwan are in good restore and condition, expansion of the subway system has resulted in road closures and blockages, which hamper traffic during peak traffic hours. Highway overpass construction in Taiwan has also caused some traffic delays now a day. So traffic jam is a normal incident in Taiwan much like Bangladesh, one should schedule his day with this fact in mind. Taiwan contains a very strict traffic laws, although they may not always be enforced. The most difficult aspect of driving in Taiwan is the endless streams of motor scooters and motorcycles roving Taiwan's roadways all day long. They don’t follow any traffic regulations and they use any sort of means to drive fast. It makes more difficult to drive in Taiwan. Because of disorganized driving, accidents involving are frequent and sometimes deadly.  The threat of kidnappings has greatly reduced over the past few years and is directed first and foremost at wealthy and/or high-profile Taiwanese individuals and families.  Crime of using or selling narcotics has greatly diminished due to aggressive law enforcement action. Taiwan authorities prolong to make stronger anti-drug efforts through enhanced airport interdiction, coast guard and customs checks, supervision, and other investigative methods.\n\n23. 22 Country risk analysis on Taiwan Extremism There are currently no worldwide nor intercontinental terrorism concerns or issues that have an effect on Taiwan. As we mentioned earlier that Taiwan does not have any record of terrorism, war or civil unrest in last few years. Protests and manifestation take place on a regular basis in Taiwan's major cities, particularly during elections. Protests are an accepted part of political life in Taiwan and are generally peaceful comparing to Bangladesh. Demonstrations rarely turn aggressive, although they may occasionally become challenging between opposing groups. Precautionary measures Precautionary measures are steps/actions which are carried out to ensure that nothing bad happens. It is important that before entering into any country we have to know what the things that might go wrong and what can be done to avoid those circumstances. Medical safety People should be careful of comparatively undercooked food. Many Taiwanese restaurants present plates of raw, sliced red meat and lightly cooked sea foods that are brought to the table and either barbecued or simmered in a pan of stash. As this constitutes a staple of the Taiwanese diet, any germs that may remain doesn't affect the locals, but it can cause disorder with foreigners. The best policy is to make sure that one cook the food in a manner to which he or she is accustomed. Taiwan’s medical system is comparatively good. Most medical emergency medical conditions can be appropriately treated in Taiwan. Air ambulance services can be arranged.
