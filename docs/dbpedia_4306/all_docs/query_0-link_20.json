        "text": "An upstart Texas-based golf business is outperforming the $2 billion-backed LIV Golf with live viewership of its tournaments, which star YouTube creators instead of golf pros. Good Good Golf hosted its Midwest Open on Tuesday in French Lick, Indiana. Close to 3,000 fans of the YouTube channel braved high heat to attend the tournament in person. It was a chance to meet their favorite golf creators from the channel, and snag a photo and autograph between holes. NBC Golf produced the Midwest Open live broadcast for Good Good Golf, and added live streaming to its Peacock and PlutoTV platforms to complement the live stream on YouTube. Online viewership of Good Good Golf's tournaments on YouTube alone is 2x the unique viewer average compared to LIV broadcasts on TV in the US. Viewership and fan engagement has translated to robust sales of the company's merchandise online and at retail. Its collection of hats are the top sellers at Dick's Sporting Goods across the US. GolfDigest recently said the boom in new golfers and golf fans has settled its attention on YouTube. LIV's star golfer, the recent US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, is quite active in posting videos to his personal YouTube channel (and collaborating with Good Good Golf's creators). Creators like Garrett Clark and Tom \"Bubbie\" Broders are already household names in the homes of the kids and 20-somethings I saw lining the course in French Lick. They along with their Good Good Golf colleagues are going to lead golf's next generation of viewership and fanship.\n\nYouTube should be bidding for NBA broadcast rights, if it’s not already a quiet suitor seeking to snatch TNT’s current rights. Media prognosticators say Disney/ABC and Amazon are two of the three winners in the new rights deal the NBA is securing $76 billion for over the next 11 years. For the past 40 seasons, TNT has carried NBA games on its cable TV network. It’s currently paying $1.2 billion a year to broadcast 65 regular season games, 40 playoff games, and the All-star weekend. YouTube would make an ideal third rights partner for the NBA. Better than Comcast or a TNT renewal. The NBA was the first pro league to create a channel on YouTube in 2005, and the first to enter the YouTube partner program to collect Adsense checks in 2007. Today the NBA boasts over 21 million subscribers to its channel, and over 13.5 billion lifetime views. YouTube TV is ascending, with over 8 million paid subscribers. The company has already been a presenting sponsor of the NBA Finals since 2018, placing its YouTube TV logo on the court and on-air broadcast. The NBA, its teams, and its players would surely benefit from having YouTube more involved throughout the season. Aside from the Warriors, most other NBA team channels on YouTube are abysmal, averaging 212,000 subscribers and 51 million lifetime views. Numbers a top YouTube creator can achieve in a month. YouTube and its parent company Google can afford the deal. It’d be another reason to subscribe to YouTube TV, and a great global platform for the NBA to reach and grow its existing 1 billion viewers of NBA game clips and highlights. https://lnkd.in/ghPz9Naf\n\nThe recent ~$200 million investment into Dude Perfect is a big bet on the ability of a YouTube creator brand and media company to drive returns in real estate. In December, Mark Cuban sold his majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks to a pair of families with strong ties to the hotel and casino industry, because he sees a future of NBA ownership where the advantages are in real estate. Last year I attended a conference hosted in Frisco, Texas at the Dallas Cowboys HQ. Conference guests stayed at a hotel that's on land owned by the team, and dined at restaurants where the Cowboys are the landlord. The team is the NFL's most valuable, with a $9 billion valuation and $500 million in EBITDA -- driven in large part by its real estate portfolio. Dude Perfect is also based in Frisco. They are one of the largest sports brands on YouTube. 4.5x more subscribers than the NFL, and 3x more than the NBA. The planned $100m Dude Perfect amusement park is the modern day Disneyland or Great Wolf Lodge versus a stadium to watch sports competitions. A destination for kids to pester their parents to travel across the country -- or world -- to visit for an extended period of time. Disney's parks business segment accounts for one third of total revenue and two thirds of operating income. Movies and TV shows drive awareness and consideration for the theme parks. Dude Perfect Inc. today is largely a media business driven by advertising revenue generated off the back of billions of YouTube views. I bet in the future it'll be real estate that drives its valuation, similar to the major sports teams and the world's largest media company.

I first learned of this scam last year when I met a top online creator who told me they routinely take down 20k fake accounts made in their name & likeness on Facebook and X -- every single month. They estimate $50 million was spent last year by lonely men seeking companionship, and thinking they were conversing with the actual online creator, and not an organized crime syndicate. The scam is called pig butchering because it's analogous to a farm where little piglets are raised, and fattened up before being butchered. People in the scam are the little piglets, fattened up with illusions of grandeur (wealth, love), before being bled dry. The FBI estimates the size of the scam reached $3.3 billion in 2022 in the US alone. That's likely a low figure because most victims don't report the losses out of embarrassment. At the core here is the desire to alleviate loneliness. I've seen news articles referring to loneliness as an epidemic in the US, and one study estimating 44 million Americans are experiencing significant loneliness. Loneliness costs US employers $154 billion annually due to worker job-withdrawal, according to a researcher at Cigna. Who are the interesting startups operating in the 'loneliness market', and people building solutions to tackle the epidemic that don't involve scamming lonely people out of their life savings?\n\nYou won't find the latest non-fiction story worth binging on Netflix. It's a 50-part video series on TikTok made with a camera phone. Reesa Teesa is an Atlanta based creator who grew her following from 7,768 in January to 2.7 million today. She tells her story of how she met, dated, married and then divorced a pathological liar in the series \"Who TF Did I Marry?!?\". It's ~8 hours of gripping storytelling, featuring Reesa either in her car or home talking straight to the camera. As of today, the video series has amassed 297 million views, 21.2 million likes, 1.25 million comments, 2.5 million bookmarks, and 927k shares. The watch time for Reesa's series would rank it higher than 98% of movies and series on Netflix. Reesa said she made the series because she hopes it will help other people who have gone through or are going through similar experiences. “I already knew this story was not going to always make me look good at all,” she recently told NBC News. “But I also felt like the story was bigger than me in a way. In other words, it was worth some embarrassment. But it was cathartic and it was also very emotional, and very hard at times.” Avi Gandhi commented on LinkedIn this week about the opportunity to create original content without studios and financiers. Reesa embodies this to great effect. I am sure Reesa's phone and email inbox is full of producers seeking her permission to adapt her TikTok series into a Netflix series. She can now decide what to do next -- on her own terms.\n\nGoogle captured ~31% of the total US advertising market in 2023, and is forecast to receive just 4.5% of the $10.2 billion in political ad spend this year. Half of the political ad spend is still forecast to go to broadcast TV. This election cycle should be an advertising bonanza for the YouTube ecosystem. It didn’t make any 2024 prediction list I read over the holidays. One reason for the spend discrepancy is the age of the voter. In the 2020 election, 48% of US citizens aged 18-20 voted. For citizens in their 50s, the rate was 71%. More citizens in their 80s voted than those of college age. You’ll reach my 80-year old parents quite easily on TV. Since Biden has been president, the interest level of top voter issues as seen on YouTube ranks as follows: inflation, immigration, abortion, climate and employment. Since the start of the year, immigration, inflation and employment top the list. Do these issues matter less to those in their 20s than those over 50? If those in their 20s vote at the same rate of those over 50, we’d have the largest single voter demo block by a meaningful margin. Where’s Taylor Swift with her voter registration drive? 49% of US adults now identify as politically independent. It’s the highest rate in history, and up from 31% since 2004. In the 2020 election, new voters under age 30 backed Biden over Trump by a 26 point margin. I recently met a startup that claimed conservative groups are outspending liberal groups 93-to-1 in terms of financing creators and content online. These groups understand that to reach new younger voters, and to swing those independent voters to your candidates and causes, you won’t succeed with 30-second TV commercials. It’s via voices like Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens. Shapiro averages 135 million monthly views in the past year. No liberal-leaning creator comes close to his reach and engagement on YouTube. A lot can change in the next 8 months.\n\nIndependent creators in Japan have utilized digital channels to create two of the largest new entertainment IPs in recent years. Takuro Mizobe and his ~40 person team at game studio Pocket Pair spent ~$7 million and 2+ years of development on Palworld, an action-adventure, survival and monster-taming game that draws inspiration from Ark: Survival Evolved and Pokemon. Since the game’s Jan 19 early-access release on Steam, it has gone on to gross $360 million in its first 13 days. The full v1 of the game is not expected to be released for another year. What other entertainment IP has sold this well in its beta form, and produced as strong an ROI? A Japanese creator who goes by the name Nagano created and released a manga titled Chiikawa on X in Jan 2020. In the following year a publisher released five collections of the illustrations from X, and an anime series followed in 2022. Today, the creator releases Chiikawa anime on YouTube. The channel has reached 510,000 subscribers and averages 2.4 million views a month. The content is tailored to Japanese viewers, where over 80% of the channel’s audience is located, and connects with an equal number of men & women aged 18-34. A friend in Tokyo told me the most in-demand consumer product this past holiday season at the Tokyo Station character street was Chiikawa. Consumer product sales have reportedly surpassed $1.5 billion, with a nine figure tally from direct-to-consumer ecommerce. Japanese consumer interest in Chiikawa, as measured by Google, has been ~5x greater than Hello Kitty over the past year. It’s a great time to be building with Japanese creators, and at a time when digital platforms can scale IP globally more effectively than ever before.\n\nYouTube just announced its TV product surpassed 8 million paid subscribers – growth aided by the addition of NFL Sunday Ticket to its offering. Analysts have estimated YouTube added 1.3 million subscribers to the NFL package this season. The base plan + NFL package generates over $7 billion in annual revenue, which would be ~20% of parent co. Google’s total subscription and device revenue in 2023. A big miss this past quarter is the growth of free subscribers to YouTube channels operated by the National Football League (NFL) teams, and how the teams leveraged all of the marketing by YouTube to attract NFL fans to its platform. The 32 NFL teams average 201k subscribers, and 26 million views over the past 12 months to their team channels. Dude Perfect, a top sports creator group on YouTube, has over 1.7 billion views in the past year. The Eagles, Chargers, Cowboys, Chiefs and Vikings top the league in channel view counts. The Cowboys are the only team among the group to not lean into Shorts to drive views. I listened to an NFL team owner speak at a conference last year about how their team prefers fans purchase merchandise from their team store versus the NFL store so they acquire the customer data. It’s that data that informed the team the majority of its merch buyers are women, and that they have a decent sized fan base in Mexico. Each of the NFL teams should consider hiring YouTube creators who know how to build community and drive fan engagement to manage their team channel. None of the top 5 most viewed teams offer Memberships on YouTube – a paid area where the team can engage its more passionate fans, and gain key insights like those mentioned by the team owner. Surely these billion dollar sports enterprises can afford to do YouTube right.\n\nOne of the best things I heard at a conference this year is a story tied to failure and taking risks. Alongside five championships, 18 consecutive all-star appearances, one league MVP honor, and 39,283 career regular season points, Kobe Bryant still holds the record for the most missed shots in the NBA with 14,481. In Bryant’s rookie season, during game 5 of the second round of the playoffs, he tried a mid-range jump shot in the closing seconds of the game – and missed the rim entirely. In overtime, Bryant attempted three more shots and missed all three. Four airballs in 5 minutes. His team lost the game by 3 points. Bryant later said the game and his play shaped him. “It was an early turning point for me in being able to deal with adversity, deal with public scrutiny and self-doubt. I look back at it now with fond memories, but back then it was misery.” Undeterred, Bryant carried on shooting and missing to the point he became so comfortable with the idea of failure that he was willing to encounter it in every game he played. I have worked at several leading tech companies in my career, and at each I would hear leadership talk about risk taking and instilling innovation throughout the workforce. Unfortunately individual performance reviews would negatively impact a project or experiment gone wrong to the point where the employee would think twice before venturing down that path again. Throughout my career, I sought out managers and mentors who would “block and tackle” for me, and support taking risks. It’s these people who supported my move from corporate intrepreneurship to entrepreneurship 6 years ago where I have managed to fail many times over. I take comfort in knowing any notion of personal success in 2024 is due to getting up each day, being comfortable with discomfort, keep taking risks, and venturing into the unknown. Happy Holidays, and best wishes to you on your own risk-taking journey in 2024.\n\nThe largest financing of a media startup in 2023 is the faith and values-based company The WONDER Project. I first learned about the startup one year ago from my friend and ex-colleague Heather Moosnick. I heard her outline the vision and ambition, and the team being assembled. Sign me up. I'm thankful she allowed my little vehicle Creator Capital to join the seed financing round, and I'm delighted to see larger institutions back the series A financing round. Jon Erwin has said before, \"what can we build together, that none of us can do alone\". It's a pleasure to support him, my former YouTube boss Kelly Merryman, and Heather on their journey. Faith based entertainment is considered a niche in Hollywood. In reality, it's a rather large niche that's just been overlooked. Years ago when I was working at YouTube, I spoke with a fellow exec about the lack of partner management of faith based creators. We had partnership teams for music, gaming, sports, beauty, kids. Despite the direct support, many faith based creators (of all faiths) have flourished on YouTube. See what Dallas Jenkins has built with \"The Chosen\". It's exciting that he's now involved in The WONDER Project. If you're into investing and supporting faith and values-based startups, send me a DM. I've met number of talented founders this year who could benefit from more support."
