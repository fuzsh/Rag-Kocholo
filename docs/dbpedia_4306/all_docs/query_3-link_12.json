He is a member of the South Korean boy group SEVENTEEN under the Performance Team.\n\nHe then released his first special single \"Can you sit by my side?\" on December 14, 2018.\n\nProfile[]\n\nStage Name: Jun (준)\n\nSub-Unit:\n\nPerformance Team\n\nPosition:\n\nLead Dancer\n\nSub-Vocalist\n\nCareer[]\n\nPre-debut and Training[]\n\nAs a child, Jun began starring in commercials and worked as a child actor on TV shows and movies in Hong Kong and Mainland China.\n\nHis acting career started at the age of two when he was cast in a commercial. He has appeared in numerous television series, including Flying Dragon – the Special Unit (特警飞龙) at the age of five.\n\nHe made his film debut in 2006 in The Pye Dog, for which he won the Hong Kong Film Directors' Guild's Best New Performer Silver Award and was nominated for the Best New Performer Award of the 27th Hong Kong Film Awards. In 2010, he played the young Ip Man in The Legend Is Born: Ip Man.\n\nIn October 2012, Jun moved to South Korea to undergo training under Pledis Entertainment. From 2013 to 2015, he appeared on Seventeen TV and MBC Seventeen Project: Debut Big Plan as a trainee alongside the other future members of his band.\n\n2015 - now: Seventeen and Solo Activities[]\n\nHe debuted as a member of Seventeen on May 26, 2015 under the stage name Jun. Their first EP 17 Carat was released three days later.\n\nIn 2018, he and group member The8 participated in the Chinese music reality show Chao Yin Zhan Ji (潮音战纪). He won the first solo stage competition on the show with his performance of Wo Ming Bai (我明白), a Chinese cover of Seventeen's Thanks. He wrote the Chinese lyrics for the cover. His solo and collaboration stages on the show have been released on digital music platforms owned by Tencent Music.\n\nHe released his first solo, the special single album Can you sit by my side? (能不能坐在我身边), which he co-wrote, on December 14, 2018. He released his first solo OST, the Chinese version of Dream, for The King: Eternal Monarch on July 2, 2020.\n\nActing[]\n\nIn 2014, he was cast in the Chinese web drama Intouchable. He filmed a music video for the NetEase mobile game A Dream of Jianghu in July 2019.\n\nOn October 2021, it was announced that he will be playing the main male lead for the Chinese drama, Exclusive Fairytale (独家童话). This marks his first ever main role in a drama.\n\nHosting[]\n\nIn 2015, Jun was a special MC for the Chinese interview segment on SBS The Show. From October to December 2018, he co-hosted the Chinese music ranking show YO! BANG (由你音乐榜样).\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nHe learned wushu as a child and participated in competitions. He also plays the piano and has performed arrangements of Seventeen's songs.\n\nHis handsome looks have garnered him the nicknames of The Miracle of Mainland (大陸の奇跡) in Japan and Big Beautiful (大漂亮) in China. He is also known to fans as the Little Prince of Shenzhen Subway (深圳地铁小王子) because a promotional ad he filmed for the Shenzhen Metro in middle school is still being aired on certain trains.\n\nIn his teenage years, he experienced spinal tuberculosis after a waist injury sustained during a martial arts competition. The treatment lasted approximately 10 months, leaving residual stiffness around his waist and hips that affects his dancing.[1]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nDigital single albums[]\n\n\"Silent Boarding Gate (寂寞号登机口)\" (2021)\n\nDigital singles[]\n\n\"Crow (乌鸦)\" (2021)\n\n\"Limbo\" (2022)\n\n\"Psycho\" (2023)\n\nSpecial singles[]\n\nCan you sit by my side?
