        "text": "It finally happened. They already lost their lunch on the hardwood and linoleum, so it was only a matter of time before the carpet earned its ticket to ride.\n\nNo one loves coming home to dog vomit sprawled across the family room, but the good news is that it may not be as big of a problem is it appears at first glance.\n\nFirst and foremost: Check in on your dog. Your carpet is replaceable, but your best friend isn’t. Is it an isolated incident? Is it part of a chronic vomiting pattern? Is your dog panting, huffing or acting irregular in any way?\n\nOur vomit guide can give you a better idea of when it’s time to call the vet, but trust your gut above all else.\n\nThe simplest dog vomit carpet cleaning solution\n\nProvided your dog is in good health and their behavior appears normal, it’s fair to turn your attention toward removing the potential stain. Here’s all you’ll need for starters:\n\nDistilled white vinegar\n\nA spray bottle\n\nSome old rags, t-shirts or any cotton you don’t mind throwing away\n\nFirst, do your best to remove any undigested food or substantial material that’s resting on top of the carpet. Using a pair gloves or your rags, pluck them out of the fibers and toss them in the trash.\n\nNext, pour some vinegar into a spray bottle and add roughly the same amount of tap water to dilute the solution. Give it a good shake, spray liberally across the vomit stain and give it a minute or two to soak.\n\nCarefully blot your carpet with your rags to pick up remaining vomit residue and fade the stain’s color. Repeat this process as many times as necessary.\n\nFor stronger dog vomit stains\n\nTry adding baking soda and dish soap to the mix.\n\nAdd a dash of dish soap to your vinegar/water mixture and repeat the same spraying and blotting process. Afterwards, spread a few pinches of baking soda across the stain (or a handful, depending on its size). Let it set for about 15 minutes, then vacuum it up\n\nOnce you’ve sprayed it down with vinegar, spread baking soda across the stain and let stand for around 15 minutes then vacuum it all up.\n\nIf all else fails...\n\nSee if you can dig up the cleaning instructions for your rug. Many brands keep them tucked away on the tag. While some rugs can be dry cleaned or even tossed in the washing machine, others may require more gentle care or specialty cleaning.\n\nAs with all home remedy cleaning solutions, try it out on an inconspicuous corner of your carpet before you dive right in. Vinegar and baking soda are fairly harmless, natural and low-odor cleaning products that rarely cause a reaction, but you’re always better safe than sorry.\n\nHappy cleaning!"
