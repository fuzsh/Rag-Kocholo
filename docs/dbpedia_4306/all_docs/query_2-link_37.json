I hereby waive any right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief. I understand that I will have neither the right to rescind or terminate this Agreement, or any of Jones’s rights hereunder, nor seek to enjoin Jones or any third party from use of my likeness. I agree this Agreement constitutes our entire understanding and agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and cannot be amended except by a written instrument signed by me and Mary Jones.\n\nI agree this Agreement shall be binding upon me and my heirs, legal representatives, and assigns.\n\nI warrant that (i) I am over the age of 21 and have the right to contract in my own name,(ii) I have had the opportunity to confer with counsel of my choosing, and (iii) I have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.\n\n———————————————————————————-\n\nWelcome to maryjones.com and thanks for your interest in our products.\n\n1.
