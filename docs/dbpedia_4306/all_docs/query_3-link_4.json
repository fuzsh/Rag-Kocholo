        "text": "Taiwanese singer and actress\n\nElla Chen Chia-hwa (traditional Chinese: 陳嘉樺; simplified Chinese: 陈嘉桦; pinyin: Chén Jiāhuà; born 18 June 1981) is a Taiwanese singer, actress, and television host. She is a member of the Taiwanese girl group S.H.E.\n\nMusical career\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 8 August 2000, HIM International Music held a 'Universal 2000 Talent and Beauty Girl Contest' in search of new artists to sign under their label. When Chen traveled with her older sister to Taipei for a holiday, she discovered that her sister had registered her for the competition. Intimidated by the long line of contestants and worried of facing ridicule for her tomboy personality, Chen almost gave up before the first round, but her sister convinced her to stay. Chen's deep voice caught the label's attention, and she reached the final round. Her alto voice was noted for its strong and beautiful nature.[1]\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the contest, Chen returned to her duties at a local hospital, but received a call from HIM International requesting an additional audition. After test recordings were done, she signed on as part of HIM's newest girl group, S.H.E. Her English name 'Ella', which means courage, was derived from a personality test set by HIM Management Co.[2] When Chen first tested out her signature, HIM employees were concerned that the signature would be easily forged due to its simplicity; thus, during S.H.E's early days, Ella signed autographs using the last character of her name, (pinyin: huà). However, as S.H.E's autograph sessions drew larger audiences, Chen reverted to her simpler, English signature.[3]\n\nDuring her career with S.H.E, Chen has been the most accident-prone member. On 29 July 2003, she was sent to the hospital after jumping from the third story of a building and injuring her spine while filming a variety program; the two other members refused to jump. She returned three weeks later to promote Super Star. In 2005, during the filming of Reaching for the Stars, Chen burned her ears and hair on a candle, prompting crew members to send her to the National Taiwan University Hospital.[4] She stayed away from filming for two days, during which she cut off approximately two centimeters of burnt hair on both sides of her head.[4]\n\nIn 2007, Chen was voted by online fans as Taiwan's most down-to-earth artist.[5] Since the release of S.H.E's first album in 2001, Chen has usually been the one to answer reporter's questions.[6] As the tomboy of S.H.E, Chen is frequently the subject of jokes targeting her gender and sexual orientation, but she usually takes the jabs in stride.[7] In one online poll she was labelled as one of China's Four Main Tomboys of the past century.[8]\n\nIn 2009, Chen composed a song for her seniors Power Station, entitled \"Love Crazy/愛到瘋癲\" (originally titled Shi Mian/Insomnia (失眠), written after her failed heartbreaking relationship). The song was given to them as repayment for Power Station have given S.H.E the song \"Freezer\". Chen had also composed a station song entitled \"Pop Radio 91.7 jingle\" for Taiwan Pop Radio station \"Pop Radio 91.7,\" 再这里 for Huang Yi Da (黄义达), 鸟 for Yao Yao.\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\nHer unusually deep voice earned her a starring role as the voice of Arthur in the Mandarin version of Arthur and the Minimoys.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2003, Chen starred in drama series The Rose (薔薇之戀) with Joe Cheng (鄭元暢) and Jerry Huang (黃志瑋). The drama was voted the Most Popular Drama at the Golden Bell Awards.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2005, Chen and her S.H.E group mates were involved in a drama called Reaching for the Stars (真命天女). She was the only member nominated for Best Lead Actress at the 41st Golden Bell Awards.[citation needed] In 2006, Chen accepted a role in drama series Hanazakarino Kimitachihe (花样少年少女) with Wu Chun (吳尊). The show was popular both in Taiwan and internationally in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and in non-Chinese speaking countries like Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, the USA and some European countries.[citation needed]\n\n2010 marked Chen's return to the drama series arena when she starred alongside Jerry Yan (言承旭), in Down With Love (就想賴著妳).\n\nIn 2012, Chen ventured onto the big screen in her first full-length film New Perfect Two (新天生一對) alongside Vic Zhou (周渝民). This was immediately followed by another equally successful movie, Bad Girls (女孩坏坏) with Mike He (賀軍翔). Bad Girls' theme song was covered by Chen and became the carrier single of her first commercial mini album entitled To Be Ella/I am Chen Jia Hua, which topped the charts all over Asia and gained various praises from the critics and nominations from different award giving bodies on the same year.\n\nAs a singer and an actress, Chen has also appeared in various music videos such as 愛的重唱曲-覆水難收篇 (2004-04-05), 再一次拥有 (2005) by Kaira Gong and 愛到瘋癲 (2009) by Power Station.\n\nIn 2013, Chen filmed a Chinese New Year Drama in Shanghai entitled Ji Pin Da Zuo Zhan which required her to film one month straight as she went back and forth from Taiwan to Shanghai to fulfill her group activities in her home country.\n\nChen also hosted a dating show, Take Me Out, with Harlem Yu which began airing on 13 April 2013. She was nominated for Best Entertainment TV Show Host along with Yu at the 49th Golden Bell Awards. Chen was a judge in Season 2 of the Chinese reality singing television show, Masked Singer.\n\nChen was a vocal mentor on Produce 101 China, which aired in 2018. In 2020, Chen joined Season 2 of the Chinese survival show, Youth With You, otherwise also known as Idol Producer Season 3, as a vocal coach along with Cai Xukun, Lisa and Jony J.[9]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 2016, Chen announced that she was 6 weeks pregnant with her first child with her husband, Alvin Lai, who is Malaysian. Their child, a boy, was born on 12 April 2017.[10] She first revealed her son nine months after his birth on social media.[11] He later appeared at S.H.E 17th anniversary concert as a surprise guest.[12]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: S.H.E discography\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nWhy Not – released 17 April 2015\n\nBad Habits – released 01 April 2024 ella chen's instragram\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nQiang Qiang – released 27 August 2007.\n\nTo Be Ella – released 30 March 2012.\n\nMe vs. Me – released 28 October 2016\n\nElla Show - Entertainment Unlimited Company – released 16 November 2020\n\nSolo / duet\n\n[edit]\n\n单手超人 (Dān Shǒu Chāorén / Single-handed Superman)\n\n我就是我 (Wǒ Jiù Shì Wǒ / I Am Just Me) – A self-penned and self-composed song she made for her Solo Performance in the S.H.E Is The One Concert Tour.[13]\n\n跟月亮Say Goodbye (Gēn Yuèliàng Say Goodbye / Say Goodbye with the Moon) – Solo – unreleased but leaked around April 2010.[14]\n\n你被寫在我的歌裡 (Nǐ Bèi Xiě Zài Wǒ De Gē Li / You're To Write in My Songs) – Duet with Wu Qing-feng – was the featured artist in What Is Troubling You (你在煩惱什麼) Album by Sodagreen, released 11 November 2011.\n\n別 (Bie / Don't) – A solo in Girl's Dorm (女生宿舍)\n\n偷偷愛著你 (Tou Tou Ai Zhe Ni / Secretly in Love with You) – Opening theme song of Hana Kimi, but 'Zen Me Ban' was chosen.
