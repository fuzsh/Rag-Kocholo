        "text": "Use ARM & HAMMER® Super Washing Soda regularly in your wash cycle for added cleaning and freshening power\n\nRegular Wash:\n\nFor regular wash, add ½ cup of Super Washing Soda along with the usual amount of either liquid or powder detergent at the beginning of the wash cycle. (Always follow machine instructions when adding laundry products.)\n\nAdd clothes and let washer fill completely.\n\nFor HE washers, add ½ cup of Super Washing Soda along with the usual amount of either liquid or powder detergent to the HE dispenser. (Always follow machine instructions when adding laundry products.)\n\nLarge, Heavily Soiled Wash:\n\nFor large, heavily soiled wash loads use 1 full cup of Super Washing Soda along with the usual amount of either liquid or powder detergent at the beginning of the wash cycle. (Always follow machine instructions when adding laundry products.) Add clothes and let washer fill completely.\n\nHard Water:\n\nFor hard water conditions, add 1 cup of Super Washing Soda along with the usual amount of either liquid or powder detergent at the beginning of the wash cycle.\n\nTough Stains:\n\nSuper Washing Soda adds extra cleaning and freshening power to your detergent. Stains and greasy soils sometimes need special handling. Often a routine machine wash will just not be enough to remedy stubborn problems.\n\nThe most effective way to remove stains is to begin treatment as soon as possible. Although some stains may be impossible to remove, a pre-treatment or pre-soak with Super Washing Soda is often very helpful — especially for removing greasy stains and embedded dirt from synthetics and cottons.\n\nTo Pre-treat:\n\nMake a paste of 4 tablespoons Super Washing Soda and ¼ cup warm water. Using rubber gloves, gently rub paste into dampened stain and wash as usual.\n\nWhen laundering, add ½ cup of Super Washing Soda in addition to your usual detergent. Always test a small, hidden area of fabric to determine colorfastness before pre-treating.\n\nTo Pre-soak:\n\nPre-soak laundry in warm water (use cool water for non-colorfast items as well as for blood and egg stains).\n\nUse 2 tablespoons of Super Washing Soda per gallon of warm water if pre-soaking in a small tub, or use ½ cup if pre-soaking in a filled washing machine.\n\nPre-soak for at least 30 minutes before washing.\n\nWash with ½ cup of Super Washing Soda in the wash cycle, in addition to your usual detergent.\n\nSuper Washing Soda can dissolve grease and dirt throughout the kitchen.\n\nOvens, Range Tops, and Broiler Pans\n\nEase these messy jobs with a solution of ½ cup Super Washing Soda dissolved in a gallon of warm water. For stubborn, crusted soils, sprinkle Super Washing Soda dry on a damp sponge to scour quickly and easily. Remove burners and soak in solution for at least 30 minutes to banish greasy build-up. Rinse well and dry.\n\nRange Hoods and Exhaust Fans\n\nA weekly wash with a solution of ½ cup Super Washing Soda dissolved in a gallon of warm water keeps range hoods and exhaust fans grease-free. Rinse well afterwards.\n\nPots, Pans, and Cookware\n\nTo remove greasy, burned-on stains from cookware, try the method that works best for you.\n\nSprinkle dry Super Washing Soda on a damp sponge to scour stains. Rinse well.\n\nOr apply a paste of 2 parts Super Washing Soda, 1 part water to stained areas. Let stand for 30 minutes; then wash and rinse as usual.\n\nDo not use on aluminum cookware\n\nPlastic Housewares\n\nClean and freshen garbage cans, tablecloths, shower curtains, and small appliance covers with a solution of ½ cup Super Washing Soda dissolved in a gallon of warm water. Wash surface and rinse.\n\nSmall Appliances (toasters, electric mixers, and food processors)\n\nA weekly wipe down with a solution of ½ cup Super Washing Soda dissolved in a gallon of warm water will keep your small appliances shining and free of dirt and grease. Do not use on aluminum appliances."
