The show first aired on June 19, 2016, and it is hosted by Li Hao (李好). The mentors of the show include Psy, Leehom Wang, Harlem Yu, and Phoenix Legend.\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series is based on a similar competition format in Vietnam with the same name. Different from the past variety shows in China, the show features Electronic Dance Music (EDM) marking China's first-ever variety show featuring the music genre.[1][2][3]\n\nWith the introduction of EDM in the western world, the show hopes to extend its possibilities of electronic music-making in China. According to People's Daily's music producer Liu Zhou (刘洲), \"In China, the development of EDM somewhat lags behind, and we are not able to keep up with industry trends. If everyone else is making electronic music but we are not, we will stay behind.\"[4] In this sense, Heroes of Remix aims to introduce the real meaning of EDM to its viewers, particularly to the Chinese people.[4]\n\nIn contrast to the popular belief that EDM is all about being 'fast-tempo nightclub tunes' only, the show would bring about the 'true essence of electronic music' in the context of Chinese music. However, since EDM is defined as \"...one of the most transportable\" by Forbes Magazine, not only will the performers bring elements of Chinese traditional culture into the remixes of their songs but they are also welcome to incorporate other traditional cultures from other countries. In this way, they would be producing new and creative remixes of their songs.[4]\n\nFormat\n\n[edit]\n\nHeroes of Remix highlights the performers' and mentors' talents in producing Chinese EDM music. Performers (bands or soloists) would perform their own rendition to their song choice under the guidance of their mentors. They are welcome to interpret and remix the songs in any way possible. Audience would then vote for their winning group/soloist by the end of each show.[4]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2016, Chinese-American singer-songwriter Leehom Wang was confirmed to join Heroes of Remix together with South Korean singer-songwriter and rapper Psy. The two already met once during the 2012 Mnet Asian Music Awards in Hong Kong.[5] On May 12, the variety show held a press conference in Zhuhai. It was reported that the show would provide virtual reality (VR) content and production. Star Media CEO Tian Ming said that VR content would allow viewers to fully experience the backstage activities in their perspective and be able to interact with the artists/performers, which is different from traditional television.[6] Five days after, it was announced that the variety show was set to air in June on Jiangsu TV. By then, Chinese music duo Yangwei Linghua and Zeng Yi, and Chinese singer-songwriter Harlem Yu have been announced as mentors already.[1]\n\nMentors and performers\n\n[edit]\n\nThe mentors of Heroes of Remix\n\nMentors and their respective teams in Heroes of Remix Mentor Team members Leehom Wang\n\nJoyce Chu\n\nSummer (吉克隽逸)\n\nWilliam Wei\n\nLi Qi (李琦)\n\nPsy\n\niKon\n\nSNH48\n\nG.E.M.

Psy's appearance was blurred out while he was also removed from the program's official website.[15] The ongoing Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) issue wherein Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed concerns against the deployment of THAAD in South Korea that could jeopardize China's \"legitimate national security interest\" may be the reason.[18]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
