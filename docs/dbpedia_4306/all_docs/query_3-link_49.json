        "text": "The only hotel in Xiamen with a private beach is the huge wheel hotel\n\nA few years ago, I went to Xiamen and chose the Xiamen Baixiang Wutong Hotel, which is very close to Xiamen Airport. Staying there once left an unforgettable impression on me. This summer vacation, I took my daughter to Xiamen to experience the hotel I like. The hotel is by the sea, resembling a huge ship. The high-ceilinged lobby is very grand, giving a strong vacation feel. Our sea-view king room is also exceptionally large, allowing us to watch the sunrise while lying in bed. The bathroom is also spacious, with a shower facing the sea view. The characteristic of Baixiang Wutong Hotel is the direct sea view, and all the rooms are very spacious. The only hotel in Xiamen with a private beach is this one, which also has children's favorite Dream Island and a sea-view swimming pool. In the evening, you can go to the Quilang Bar for a drink in the sea breeze. You can also sit at the Wuyang Bar, which is too romantic. Breaking the conventional bar model, it feels a bit like a crystal chapel, dreamy under the night lights. We prefer to sit in the executive lounge, loving this spacious area. It is a sea-view executive lounge with an excellent dining environment. For me, the dining environment is as important as the quality of the food, with freshly squeezed fruit or vegetable juice available all day. This time we also tried the hotel's Wakamizu, a Japanese restaurant that serves food in buffet style, made to order. There are many dishes to choose from, and we focused on seafood, ordering grilled snow crab legs, codfish, salmon sashimi, sweet shrimp sashimi, etc., all of which were fresh and tasty. In addition, there is a buffet restaurant, a lobby bar, and a Chinese restaurant.\n\nR3@lm_W@nd3r3r\n\nWith its convenient location, this hotel is a short walk to scenic spots like Wuyuan Lighthouse and Wuyuanwan Wetland Park. Boasting wonderful views of the nearby seascape, the design of its interior is also influenced by the ocean. The spacious rooms are understated without being too simplistic, making the property perfect for business travelers. The hotel also offers comprehensive facilities and attentive service.\n\nluoxufenfei.\n\nSummer Family Trip to Xiamen: Discover Beachfront Family Resorts\n\nXiamen Baixiang Wutong Hotel, a luxurious and family-friendly seaside resort, is undoubtedly an ideal destination for family vacations and parent-child trips. Here, you and your children will enjoy a fun and heartwarming holiday, creating beautiful memories together. Private Beach, Close to Nature The hotel boasts a private beach in Xiamen with fine sand and clear waters. Children can run freely, build sandcastles, and embrace the sea. Parents can accompany them, enjoying quality family time and experiencing the beauty of nature together. PS: Hotel guests can borrow sand digging tools for free! Rich Family Facilities, Edutainment The hotel features a children's playground called Dream Island, offering a variety of experiences for children of different ages, such as a comprehensive play area, toddler play area, Little Wu Cruise, craft area, and trampoline area. Additionally, there are colorful educational courses that combine learning with fun. Gourmet Feast, Satisfy Your Taste Buds The hotel has multiple restaurants, including Chinese, Western, Japanese, and tea restaurants, offering a diverse range of culinary options. From seafood feasts to exquisite Western cuisine, from authentic Minnan snacks to exotic dishes, there's something for everyone. Especially the seafood section in the buffet restaurant, with a wide array of fresh seafood, will delight the children. The restaurant also has a dedicated children's dining area and activity zone, ensuring kids eat happily and play to their heart's content. Comfortable Rooms, Home-like Warmth The hotel offers spacious and bright rooms with stylish and cozy designs, equipped with high-quality bedding and toiletries, providing guests with a comfortable stay. The family-themed rooms, in particular, feature themed decorations and are equipped with children's play tents, children's toilet seats, children's towels, and toiletries, making it convenient for family use. Additionally, the hotel offers a variety of pillows to choose from, catering to different guests' needs. Convenient Transportation, Explore Xiamen The hotel is conveniently located with easy access to popular attractions like Gulangyu Island and the Botanical Garden, as well as business and leisure spots like the Xiamen International Conference & Exhibition Center and Wanda Plaza. During the summer, the hotel also provides shuttle buses to popular attractions, making it convenient for guests to travel.\n\nÂªàÈñÄ‰Ω∞Áøî‰∫îÈÄöÈÖíÂ∫ó\n\nXiamen offers sea view hotels where you can easily get the same experience as celebrities, highly recommended to everyone!\n\nI heard this is the favorite spot for celebrities attending the Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Awards in Xiamen. If it weren't for a local friend's recommendation, I wouldn't have known that Xiamen has such a photogenic place! Previously, I might not have chosen local brand hotels when traveling, but this time I was proven wrong. It's not the 'extravagant and inhumane' spending I had in mind; the details of both the hardware and software are really well done! Alright, no more nonsense, let's get straight to the photo spots! Pic 1Ô∏è‚É£: The lobby. When I was heading to the tea restaurant, the midday sun cast the shadow of the sardine storm lamp directly onto the ground through the hollowed-out top of the hotel. It was stunning! For photography, the photographer should stand on the second floor near the tea restaurant. Pic 2Ô∏è‚É£: According to the hotel, this is a spot loved by celebrities attending the Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Awards every year. It's on the second floor to the left of the hotel lobby, leading to the Chinese restaurant. Pics 3Ô∏è‚É£-5Ô∏è‚É£: The hotel beach, said to be the only exclusive beach on Xiamen Island? It's really photogenic. Pic 5Ô∏è‚É£ is the path from the beach to the children's playground. I love this lighthouse. Pic 6Ô∏è‚É£: The hotel lobby. I love this spot, the jellyfish-shaped lamp above and the palm trees outside the window with a hint of the sea in the background complement each other beautifully. Pic 7Ô∏è‚É£: Called the 'Sky Mirror' by the hotel, it's also a favorite spot for many celebrities. If there's any regret, it would be that it isn't a full-length window. Pic 8Ô∏è‚É£: The Wutong Lighthouse at the end of the corridor on the guest room floor, said to be the largest lighthouse in Xiamen. Despite the slightly complex background, I'm quite satisfied with this photo. Pic 9Ô∏è‚É£: The hotel lobby. I really love this lobby, it looks great in every shot. Pics üîü, 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£: Still the hotel beach, but taken from the second-floor Chinese restaurant. Pic 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£: The tea restaurant. If you want to take Hong Kong-style photos, this place is perfect, but I was too shy to pose in crowded places, haha. But honestly, their tea restaurant offers a wide variety of dishes, buffet-style, highly recommended. Alright, my personal suggestion is that local friends can consider their tea restaurant buffet when visiting. It's really worth it. For those from out of town, the location and view are fantastic, perfect for a vacation feel. I heard they provide shuttle buses during concerts, so next time!\n\nElizabeth Evans\n\nIf only I had come across this article before coming to Xiamen\n\nXiamen has so many fun places to visit!

There are so many stars coming to Xiamen for concerts in the near future! Where to stay when attending a concert in Xiamen? I strongly recommend the Xiamen Baixiang Wutong Hotel!! It's very close to the concert venues - Xiamen Strait Grand Theater and Xiamen Olympic Sports Center! Close distance, comfortable sleep, and good food, no wonder stars like JJ Lin, Jackson Yee, Wang Junkai, Jacky Cheung... choose to stay here when they come to Xiamen.

The hotel even provides free sand play tools~ Walking into the hotel's 15-meter-high lobby, you'll be struck by its grandeur. The blue fish decorations hanging overhead are a sight to behold, with a strong marine theme throughout. The room I stayed in was a deluxe sea-view king room. The room style is modern and fresh, spacious and bright. The King Koil mattress provides high-quality sleep. A floor-to-ceiling window faces the rolling sea, offering a magnificent view of the sea and the beautiful bay. The bathroom and bathing area are separated, and there's even a bathtub. Exercising in the sea-view fitness center, looking out at the blue sky, white clouds, and the vast sea, you'll feel inexplicably brighter. The indoor infinity pool is stunning, with crystal-clear water, and there are loungers beside it, so you can lie down and rest after swimming. The 'Children's Dream Island Playground' at Xiamen Baixiang Wutong Hotel must be introduced.

Next door are the Lighthouse Park, the Outlet, and the Guanyinshan business district, making it convenient for dining, entertainment, and shopping!\n\nJoshuaColeman789=\n\nNever stay here when you visit Xiamen, because once you do, you won't want to leave\n\nThe hotel is located at the northeast corner of the island, a bit far from the crowded tourist spots at the southwest corner. However, stepping out of the hotel and picking up a shared bike by the roadside, you can ride along the seaside, which is really delightful. I remember riding over the bridge where the bus explosion happened in the TV drama 'The Beginning', and standing on the bridge looking at the scenery below, I felt it was worth it. Additionally, there's an outlet across from the hotel that's not very popular. I think it's just okay, but if you have shopping needs, you might want to check it out. Lobby The hotel lobby is quite beautiful, especially with the large floor-to-ceiling windows that you see as soon as you enter, overlooking the beach and the sea, as if you're shooting 'The White Lotus'. The hotel has a small private beach, not very big, but fortunately not crowded. The few times I went, there were only a few people on the beach, which was quite comfortable. Room I've stayed a few times, booking both regular and sea view rooms, and didn't feel much difference. The sea view room cost a bit more, but the view didn't seem much different. Dining The main reason I thought the hotel was great from the first visit was thanks to the Japanese restaurant 'Ruoshui' on the first floor. With an average price of 300+ for a buffet, the food is fresh, tastes good, and the service is also very nice. Foie gras, salmon head, sashimi, sukiyaki pot, almost every dish that came up was delightful, and I immediately wanted to give the hotel full marks. Besides the seats in the hall, the private rooms also looked nice. I feel that among the Japanese buffet restaurants in this price range, this one is the most satisfying one I've eaten at recently, and I later found out there's also a lunch set for just a few dozen yuan, which I plan to try again in the future. Experience I remember seeing a large hotel advertisement as soon as I came out of the airport, and I was worried at the time that this kind of hotel would just spend money on advertising. Later, I found that I was overthinking it, and the actual experience was also very good.\n\nLillian White\n\nXiamen Vacation Ceiling Hotel | Unlock Xiamen Vacation in One Stop\n\n| Unlock Xiamen Vacation in One Stop. üåü With the view of spring mountains and the growth of grass and trees, it's the perfect time to visit Xiamen. üõÅ This spring, I unlocked the Xiamen Vacation Ceiling Hotel‚ÄîBaixiang Wutong Hotel.
