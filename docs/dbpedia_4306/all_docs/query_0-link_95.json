Full title: An archaeological clearance investigation : an archaeological clearance survey for New Mexico State Highway Department project F-033-1(14), near San Ysidro, Sandoval County, New Mexico / prepared by William K. Boyer and Denise Fallon. Abstract: An archaeological clearance survey of LA 12533 is a multiroom pueblo of the late Pueblo III (Santa Fe) period. Archaeological surveying Pueblos Pueblo III period Sandoval County (N.M.) San Ysidro (N.M.) LA 12533\n\nThis report documents the results of archeological survey of Lake Lucero Site (LA 21162) and Huntingtin Pueblo (LA 14820) located at White Sands National Monument (WSNM or Monument) and also on White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). The two sites belong among the largest prehistoric loci at Monument (WSNM). Previous documentations revealed significant cultural resources at both sites including the remnants of pit structures and possible jacal structures as well as a variety of thermal features and substantial prehistoric trash deposits (middens).Fieldwork was performed between May 15th and June 28th, 2018. The survey of the two sites revealed the presence of vast cultural resources that have provided a massive amount datasets. These data were utilized during various specialized analyses that altogether elevate our understanding of the sitesâ€™ significance in the local and regional context.\n\nMuseum of New Mexico Project ; no. 76.06.

A cultural resource clearance investigation was conducted to evaluate six archaeological sites, four prehistoric lithic sites and two late 19th-early 20th century homesteads. Included in this report are site summaries. Marsha Jackson prepared the section on the territorial period (1848-1912) homesteads (LA 16648, LA 16650).

The two sites recorded and tested include a multicomponent, prehistoric limited activity site (LA 57411) and the remains of the Wildcat Springs Trading Post, occupied sometime between 1940 and 1960. The third site (LA 59497) is a prehistoric rubble mound and midden. A portion of the midden is located within the right-of-way. The site was sketch mapped and recorded; no testing was conducted.
