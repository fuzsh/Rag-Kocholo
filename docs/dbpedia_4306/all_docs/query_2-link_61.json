        "text": "I had this problem. I was cleaning my cooker and splashed my oak worktop with bicarbonate of soda water. When I looked about an hour later there were dark splash stains in several places that couldnâ€™t be washed off. My clever husband said, bicarbonate is alkaline, so you need to treat it with acid. He squeezed fresh lemon juice onto the stains and left them for about 30-40 minutes. The stains had completely disappeared! No sign of any stains at all. I then washed the worktop with clean water, and once dry, I just reapplied the Danish oil. Problem solved!\n\nIf that's a solid wood worktop you're going to need an orbital sander, a range of sanding pads from 60 grit to at least 400 grit and some patience, then apply a worktop oil to protect it after you've sanded the marks off in stages (starting with the lowest grit - remove all the marks with it then work up to highest - each higher grit produces a smoother finish with fewer obvious scratches). Apply oil per manufacturer instructions; it may also require a sanding operation\n\nIf that's a laminate worktop (and it probably isn't as I don't think laminate would be thus affected) it will need to be replaced. The easiest way to tell is to look inside a cupboard at the underside. If it looks like the top, it's wood/if it doesn't, it's laminate"
