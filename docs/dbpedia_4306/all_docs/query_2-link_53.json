        "text": "Smoothies and tonics with potent anti-inflammatory ingredients, including baking soda and parsley, may help relieve symptoms of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.\n\nTry one of these healthy sips packed with anti-inflammatory powerhouses like ginger, parsley, and turmeric … and feel your pain fade.\n\nIf you live with an autoimmune disease, you’re well aware that food can relieve pain or make it worse. That’s because of the role food plays in fighting or aiding inflammation.\n\n“Inflammation that’s continued beyond the healthy, acute healing phase has been implicated in almost every chronic health condition and a number of autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis,” says Michelle Simon, a licensed naturopathic doctor.\n\nBut the foods you put in your body can help.\n\n“Naturopathic medicine remedies, such as tonics and broths with natural, anti-inflammatory ingredients and immune-modulating agents, can help support the body’s natural healing process,” Simon adds.\n\nHere are seven research-backed drinks that can help fight inflammation in your body.\n\nA 2018 study in the Journal of Immunologyfound drinking a tonic of baking soda and water may help reduce inflammation.\n\nBut be careful with this one: Some studies suggest there may be harmful side effects to ingesting baking soda regularly over time, like liver damage. Even this study capped intake at 2 weeks.\n\nUse this tonic for short-term inflammation relief. But no longer than a month, Simon cautions.\n\nBaking soda benefits\n\neasily accessible\n\ntells the body to calm its autoimmune response\n\nshould only be consumed short term\n\nTry it: Combine 1/4 tsp. baking soda with 8 to 12 oz. of water.\n\nA baking soda and water tonic can provide short-term relief from inflammation, but do not drink it for more than 2 to 4 weeks.\n\nParsley’s active ingredient, carnosol, targets inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis, Simon explains. A 2020 study notes that it may be safe and effective for conditions caused by inflammation.\n\nGinger is a well-known anti-inflammatory. It may prevent the production of inflammatory molecules like prostaglandin and leukotriene as well pro-inflammatory cytokines. These are a type of protein found in cells, Simon says.\n\nGinger benefits\n\ncontains gingerol, a powerful anti-inflammatory\n\nmay help reduce muscle soreness and pain\n\naids digestion\n\nTry it: Make your own juice at home. Add to a juicer:\n\n1 large handful of parsley\n\n2 cups of spinach\n\n1 green apple\n\n1 lemon\n\n1 small cucumber\n\n2 to 3 celery stalks\n\n1 to 2 inches of ginger\n\nParsley and ginger green juice may help reduce inflammation.\n\n“Numerous studies have shown that curcumin, the active ingredient found in turmeric, can help reduce the body’s inflammatory response and provide relief for joint pain and inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis,” Simon says.\n\nWhile additional research is needed, a 2022 review of research suggests that curcumin may benefit multiple inflammatory conditions. These may include:\n\npsoriasis\n\nulcerative colitis\n\nrheumatoid arthritis\n\nA 2018 study analysis found curcumin was a powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant substance. It could help control proteins, enzymes, and cytokines in central nervous system-related disorders, including multiple sclerosis.\n\nA bonus of this tonic (which was modified from Minimalist Baker): The ginger and lemon will help aid in digestion, Simon adds.\n\nCurcumin benefits\n\nhelps with chronic inflammation\n\nprovides antioxidant protection by neutralizing free radicals\n\nfights brain degeneration\n\nTry it: In a small saucepan, combine:\n\n1 tbsp. fresh grated turmeric\n\n1 tbsp. fresh grated ginger\n\njuice of 1 lemon\n\nrind of that lemon\n\n3 cups filtered water\n\nOptional:\n\n1–2 tsp. maple syrup or raw honey\n\npinch of cayenne pepper\n\nBring to a simmer over medium to medium-high heat, then turn off heat. Be careful not to let it fully boil.\n\nSet a small strainer over serving glasses and divide liquid between two mugs.\n\nStore strained leftovers in the fridge up to 2 to 3 days. When ready to eat, reheat on the stovetop until just warm.\n\nTumeric may help reduce the body’s inflammatory response and has other health benefits.\n\n“Bone broth from chickens specifically, not beef or pork or fish, supports joint health through the chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine found in the cartilage, and it’s a good source of anti-inflammatory amino acids like proline, glycine, and arginine,” Simon says.\n\nA 2022 analysis notes that chicken bone broth contains anti-inflammatory compounds and may reduce symptoms of ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nBone broth benefits\n\nfights inflammation\n\ncontains collagen, which helps support joint health\n\nmay promote better sleep, mental function, and memory\n\nTry it: In a 10-quart slow cooker, combine:\n\n2 lbs. of chicken bones (preferably from high quality, free-range chickens)\n\n2 chicken feet\n\n1 onion\n\n2 carrots\n\n2 celery stalks\n\n2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar\n\n1 gallon of water\n\nOptional:\n\n1 bunch of parsley\n\n1 tbsp. or more sea salt\n\n1 tsp. peppercorns\n\nadditional herbs of your liking\n\nSimmer for 24 to 48 hours, skimming fat occasionally. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.\n\nDiscard solids and strain the remainder in a bowl through a colander. Let stock cool to room temperature, then cover and chill.\n\nBone broth varies in the way it’s prepared and the quality of ingredients used. Pay special attention to where you purchase bone broth from and look for high quality ingredients.\n\nCompounds in chicken bone broth may help reduce inflammation and support joint health.\n\nWhole foods are always best, but there are a handful of functional food powders that help deliver a ton of antioxidants and anti-inflammatories into one drink, says Gabrielle Francis, a licensed naturopathic doctor and herbalist based in New York City.\n\nPowders loaded with bioflavonoids and antioxidants from sources like ginger, rosemary, and turmeric can help boost your immune system and reduce inflammation in your body.\n\nOther functional food powders can help heal leaky gut issues, allowing you to absorb more nutrients while keeping out the allergens and toxins that cause inflammation, Francis adds.\n\nFrancis also recommends adding arctic cod liver oil to smoothies. It’s loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, which can suppress the proteins that promote chronic inflammation.\n\nHer smoothie also includes vitamins A and D. Studies show that vitamin A and D deficiencies can contribute to chronic inflammation.\n\nCod liver oil benefits\n\ncontains vitamins A and D, both powerful antioxidants\n\nsource of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids\n\nmay help reduce joint pain in people with rheumatoid arthritis\n\nTry it: In a blender, combine:\n\n2 scoops of your favorite functional food powder\n\n1 cup frozen, organic berries\n\n1/2 banana\n\n1 cup rice, hemp, or coconut milk\n\nOptional:\n\n1 tsp. arctic cod liver oil\n\nIngredients like fish oil contain omega-3 fatty acids that may help reduce chronic inflammation.\n\nWith its high concentration of catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), green tea packs a powerful dose of antioxidants. The powdered green tea known as matcha is an especially potent anti-inflammatory.\n\nMatcha, a powder of finely ground green tea leaves, is higher in antioxidant compounds than other types of green tea because of the way it’s grown and prepared.\n\nTo make a typical cup of green tea, you steep green tea leaves in hot water and drink the water. To make matcha, you mix matcha powder directly into hot water, so you consume the actual benefit-containing tea leaves.\n\nIn addition to its anti-inflammatory effects, the EGCG in green tea may also support heart health and cognitive function.\n\nMatcha benefits\n\nan excellent source of the catechin EGCG\n\noffers anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects\n\nmay support heart health and cognitive function\n\nTry it: In a small saucepan, combine:\n\n1 sprig of fresh mint\n\n2 tbsp. sliced fresh ginger with skin\n\n2 cups water\n\n1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper\n\nBring to a boil and simmer for five minutes. Remove mint and ginger, then add:\n\n2 tsp. matcha green tea powder\n\nUsing a whisk, vigorously stir the matcha into the hot tonic.\n\nOptional:\n\n2 tsp. honey\n\nMatcha green tea contains more anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants than other forms of green tea.\n\nThis hearty smoothie (which was modified from Simple Green Smoothies) is loaded with whole fruits and veggies known to help combat inflammation. Dark leafy greens, berries, and beets are all rich in antioxidants and gut-healthy fiber.\n\nBerries contain polyphenols that may help reduce pain and inflammation associated with inflammatory arthritis. Studies suggest that anthocyanins, quercetin, and other phenolic acids in berries may help reduce arthritis symptoms and progression.\n\nBerry benefits\n\nrich in polyphenols like anthocyanins and quercetin\n\npotent antioxidant effects help combat damage from free radicals\n\nmay help reduce symptoms and progression of arthritis\n\nTry it: In a blender, combine:\n\n1 cup dark leafy greens, like kale, beet greens, or spinach\n\n1/2 peeled beet\n\n1/2 cup of ice or water\n\n1/2 peeled orange\n\n1 cup frozen mixed berries\n\n1/2 cup frozen pineapple or mango\n\n1 tsp. peeled fresh ginger\n\n1 tsp. coconut oil\n\nBerries contain compounds called polyphenols that may help reduce inflammation in conditions such as inflammatory arthritis.\n\nRead this article in Spanish.\n\nRachael Schultz is a freelance writer who focuses primarily on why our bodies and brains work the way they do and how we can optimize both (without losing our sanity).
