Each trip I usually try a few new things, but I usually have my staples for each meal.\n\nHoping people can discuss what they like, found interesting, hated, or otherwise so others can give some new things a whirl on their upcoming trip.\n\nSome of my favourites:\n\n1. Ice coffee - called Triplesso. Only available at Lawson’s from memory, but proper strength coffee and not overly sweet. My go-to when I can find it.\n\n2. Fried chicken. Again, Lawson’s is pretty damn hard to beat. Think KFC chicken but better. Can be sickly filled with oil though, but so worth it. Most places will have a front hot box with fried goodness.\n\nI will add more as I think of them...\n\nRamenman\n\nA Local\n\nMar 3, 2014\n\n7,121\n\n10,113\n\n563\n\nDec 30, 2017\n\n#2\n\nI often buy two onigiris = rice balls at 7-11, Lawson or Familymart before skiing. Salmon roe and tuna onigiri are always my favorite. All major convinis have both salmon roe and tuna onigiris. Two onigiris are \"first lunch\" when skiing. I mean, between 11am and 1pm, restaurants on ski slopes tend to be very crowded, so I eat two rice balls on lifts at 11am and have late lunch at a restaurant on a ski slope at 2pm. You need this kind of \"Haramaki\". I mean, if onigiri is iced, it's not yummy at all. So you need to keep warming onigiri with your belly\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonza\n\nDogs body...\n\nApr 21, 2004\n\n158,126\n\n143,002\n\n3,563\n\nwoonona\n\nDec 30, 2017\n\n#3\n\nUmm the maple syrup infused pancakes...

Curry is inside the bread and the bread is fried, so the surface is nicely crispy too. All convinis have microwaves, so you can ask them to heat it. Hot fried curry breads in ski resorts can be addictive, especially spicy one that Lawson has.
