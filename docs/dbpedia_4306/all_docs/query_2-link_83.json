        "text": "in terms of Daily weekly contests in the podium streak, Why does it say I have to do a battle my progress is not saved in Candy Crush Soda Saga just once I got second with A SECOND CHECKMARK BUT a FEW MINUTES LATER I DON'T I'm sure GOT SECOND place THIS week that ended about 30 minutes ago and I was first place this time last week and now I feel like I've got to 4 th or 5th place competitors can you do something and get those results the way they were before I saw there were no checkmarks for both first and middle one in the three checkmarks to get the prize please this was the second time it happened because I was second place two weeks ago and got the checkmark and some cheat took those checkmarks away, please I am saying what my computer in Candy crush soda saga weekly contest streak looked like please get them back please reply?\n\nHello @sasitha2005 and welcome to Soda community ðŸ˜€\n\nDo you mean you expected to get third position in the leaderboard of weekly contest but you now think you got 4th position?\n\nUnfortunately we cannot retrieve the leaderboard of last round of weekly contest\n\nNo, I got this past weekly contest I was second which ended yesterday at 6pm and on the week before that I was in first place which means I just reached the critical point in the winning streak of the podium streak twhich is collecting 3 winner's badges two out of 3 but now when I go there there are no checkmarks at all there's supposed two checkmarks now zero when I go to candy crush soda saga please do something to fix it.\n\nHi @sasitha2005\n\nThanks for your reply. We've been told the event may not work properly if multiple devices are used as a contest top result may be considered in one device but not the others, which makes players lose badges.\n\nKing recommends to play new new levels on one device only if players aim to win weekly contest 3 times in a row to earn the championship streak prize\n\ni don't know how would do king save THE STREAK OR START OVER BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I DID WHAT iT SAID 2 TIMES OUT OF 3 BUT I DON'T SEE 2 CHECK MARKS IN THE TRACK TO EARN THE GRAND PRIZE IN PODIUM STREak and I just checked it in my windows 10 computer and it took my progress away everything for last two weeks.\n\nHello!\n\nIt has been changed to include winners and podium players to allow more players to take part but the event is the same. Badges are not getting recorded properly if multiple devices are used to play new levels, I have first hand experience of this too. The Studio looked into this and recommended to use only one device.\n\nIf you don't receive your weekly contest prize, please contact King Player Support to ask them to send you your missing prize. For instructions please read my comment above ðŸ™‚\n\nnow I think I reached the criteria of the podium streak because I was 3 rd on the third week and first on the first week and second on the second week I think I reached the goal so I should get the goal which is get 3 winners badges in a row."
