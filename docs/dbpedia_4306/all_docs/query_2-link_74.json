        "text": "Compostable and organic materials like food waste, food scraps, food-soiled paper, and yard trimmings belong in the green bin and need to be separated from regular garbage.\n\nA study by Metro Vancouver found that 40% of what we throw into the garbage is actually compostable, and should go into the green bin. When compostable and organic materials end up in the garbage and then in the landfill, they create methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is 25 times more damaging to the environment than carbon dioxide.\n\nTogether we can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help combat our climate crisis by disposing of compostable and organic materials in the green bin.\n\nThe contents of your green bin are turned into valuable, nutrient-rich soil that is used for landscaping and growing food.\n\nIt’s important we all take small steps to keep our soil healthy and prevent micro-plastics: do not use plastic bags – even those labelled \"biodegradable\" or \"compostable\" – for your food waste and do not put plastic materials in your green bin.\n\nPlastic (of any type) is a contamination risk if put into your green bin and is not accepted by our processor for composting.\n\nImportant note If placed into your green bin, plastic materials (and the contents in them) may result in your items or the entire truck’s load being disposed to landfill or incinerator.\n\nUse paper instead of plastic to line your kitchen container\n\nRather than using plastic bags of any kind, consider lining your kitchen container with newspaper, cardboard, paper towel, or paper bags.\n\nThere are limits for the total weight of materials in your green bin:\n\nCart size Maximum gross weight 120 L 50 kg 180 L 75 kg 240 L 100 kg 360 L 150 kg\n\nBins that exceeds the weight limit can cause damage to the collection vehicles. As a general rule of thumb, if you can’t move your green bin, it is too heavy to be collected. We will not be able to empty your green bin until materials are removed to lessen the weight below the limit.\n\nSet out your green bin weekly, even if the bin is not full, to ensure the bin stays below the weight limit. If your green bin consistently exceeds the weight limit, you may want to consider ordering a larger green bin or an additional green bin to distribute the weight."
