        "text": "Should I bring my passport or ID along with me?\n\nYou’ll need to present your passport or ID at the door. Remember, in all cases, it’s very important that the name on your ticket matches precisely what is written on your ID i.e. Don’t use nicknames or common names if that’s not what’s in black and white on your ID. It will only lead to problems on the door and you won’t be able to get in.\n\nBasically, we need to do everything we can to stop ticket touts and any kind of ticket-related fraud. By making sure you are who you say you are, we can eliminate the black market as much as possible, which is good news for everyone. We all have Passports or ID Cards, so the solution is simple. Lucky us.\n\nWhat does it mean when I’m asked to enter my name “as it appears on Passport/ID”?\n\nThis refers to the importance of having the name that’s on your ticket match exactly how it is written on your proof of ID. For example, if your name is John Chan and all your friends call you John Chan - but – your ID card states you as Chan Yiu Ming. Then be sure to type “Chan Yiu Ming” on your ticket and NOT John Chan.\n\nDo we all need to enter the venue together at the same time if I buy tickets for some friends?\n\nThankfully no. Each ticket has an individual name associated to it, so simply ensure that you have the correct name on each ticket and each person is in possession of their ticket."
