        "text": "Sherry Creamy Bay Scallops and Linguine\n\nA Summery Taste of Spain\n\nWritten by SurfWriter Girls Sunny Magdaug and Patti Kishel\n\nWhen SurfWriter Girls Sunny and Patti came across a good deal on bay scallops at the butcher’s, we thought it would be a great summer seafood dish to make. This Sherry Creamy Bay Scallops and Linguine recipe uses sherry, a fortified wine with a distinctive nutty flavor, that originated in the Andalusia region of Spain.\n\nCreamy Bay Scallops and Linguine Recipe\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 Tbsp. vegetable (or olive) oil, 1 1/2 lbs. bay scallops, 2 Tbsp. butter, 3 cloves minced garlic, 2 tsps. lemon zest, 1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional), 1/2 c. dry sherry, 2 c. heavy cream, 1 lemon, juiced, salt and pepper to taste, 2 Tbsp. Italian parsley, grated parmesan cheese (topping for serving).\n\nDirections:\n\nCook 16 oz. linguine (according to package instructions) and set aside. In a large skillet cook scallops in oil on high heat for 1 minute. Turn scallops over, add butter and stir until it melts. Then stir in garlic, lemon zest and pepper flakes, followed by sherry. Continue stirring and allow the alcohol in the sherry to cook off. Pour in cream and add salt/pepper and lemon juice. Add cooked pasta to the skillet, simmer and add parsley just before serving.\n\nServe with a salad or vegetables. A rose wine would go well with this. Spain’s Rioja region has several roses (rosados). And when you drink a toast, everyone will say, “Ole!”\n\nSurf’n Beach Scene Magazine\n\nSurfWriter Girls\n\nSunny Magdaug and Patti Kishel hold the exclusive rights to this copyrighted material.

This classic Filipino dish is a holiday and New Year’s celebration taste of home for Sunny and a delicious treat for anyone who sits around the table to enjoy it.\n\nMade with chicken (or other sliced meat), vegetables and pancit Canton noodles, pancit is cooked in a large wok with the ingredients all layered in together, simmering on top of the stove and filling the kitchen with wonderful aromas.\n\nThe cooking time is relatively fast, but the dicing and slicing takes time so you might want to prepare some of the ingredients the day before and have them ready.\n\nSunny’s Pancit Canton\n\nIngredients:\n\n4T oil, 1 sliced onion, 4T minced garlic, 2lbs. chicken thighs or breasts sliced, 2 medium-size carrots peeled and sliced, 2 C snow peas (ends removed), 4 C thinly sliced cabbage, 16 oz. mushrooms sliced, 3-4 C chicken broth, 8-16 oz. canton noodles, 4-5 T. soy sauce.\n\nDirections:\n\nHeat oil in wok (or large pan) and sauté onions 2-3 minutes.

Pour in chicken broth and simmer over medium heat 2 minutes. Add noodles and soy sauce. Simmer until almost all liquid is absorbed and the noodles are tender.\n\nThe pancit noodles look like a big bird’s nest when you put them into the wok, but they quickly cook down and blend in with the chicken and vegetables mixture.\n\nNote: You can find pancit noodles at a grocery store that carries Asian specialties. Or do what we did, and order the noodles online.\n\nWhen the dish is ready, plate it and garnish with sliced hard-boiled eggs. Serve with steamed rice on the side\n\nA popular Filipino party food, Sunny remembers “my mom taking pancit to celebrations with family and friends.” It’s sure to put you in a festive mood for the New Year… even if the party is just your immediate household.\n\nSurf’n Beach Scene Magazine\n\nSurfWriter Girls\n\nSunny Magdaug and Patti Kishel hold the exclusive rights to this copyrighted material.

The dish also includes other healthy ingredients like onions and garlic, which both have antioxidants.\n\nBlue Zones Rice and Beans\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 onion, chopped, 2 cloves of garlic, minced, 2 T olive oil, 4 T Worcestershire sauce, 15 oz. can of black beans, drained, 4 ½ cups white long grain cooked rice.\n\nDirections:\n\nAdd two tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onions and cook until translucent. Then add the minced cloves of garlic. Cook until onions are soft and look almost brown. Add Worcestershire sauce and black beans. Mix these ingredients for 3 minutes. Then blend in the cooked rice and cook everything for an additional 5 minutes.\n\nThe finished dish is a meal in itself. Or you can serve it Cuban-style with roasted chicken (like we did) from the supermarket deli. (serves 4 – 6)\n\nPart of the beauty of the Blue Zones Diet is that there are so many variations of it.

Sunny likes to brew coffee in a French press coffee maker and experiment with different types of beans. Plus her parents were both born in the Philippines.\n\nOpening the door of the Teofilo Coffee Company we immediately smelled the fresh roasted beans and were pleased to see how bright and inviting the coffee house is. Smiling from behind the counter, Peter Villafane was waiting to take our order and describe the beans and coffee choices, offering us a sample of the day’s blend.\n\nThe coffee was smooth and mild. It’s roasted in-house in a hot air roaster that reduces acidity, with beans sourced from the Philippines. When Patti said it was so good she didn’t even need milk, Peter laughed and pointed to the large sign by the door that says: “Now I can drink black coffee.”\n\nIn addition to getting our java jolt for the day, we checked out the selection of beans, including Phantom Magician and The Observer, and bought a bag of coffee beans for later.\n\nSomething else caught our eye, too – large, purple-colored chocolate cookies that looked like a treat Barney, the purple dinosaur, would go for. Made out of ube, a purple yam that’s popular in the Philippines, the cookies were delicious.\n\nSurfWriter Girls learned that they’ve been growing coffee beans in the Philippines since the mid-1700s when the Spanish explorers introduced coffee to the islands. Now that we’ve tried it, we say it’s definitely something to flip for: “Bring on the cafe ole!”\n\nSurf’n Beach Scene Magazine\n\nSurfWriter Girls\n\nSunny Magdaug and Patti Kishel hold the exclusive rights to this copyrighted material.

Or been surprised by a mouthful of unexpected cinnamon? That’s what happens when seasonings and spices don’t get properly mixed during cooking. And it can really spoil your enjoyment of a dish.\n\nFortunately, SurfWriter Girls Sunny and Patti have the solution to this problem – just in time for the holidays. It’s one that will turn your culinary creations into cooking masterpieces.\n\nIt’s a bouquet garni. A small, cooking bag, or sachet, made of muslin that holds the herbs or spices during cooking and can be removed afterward.\n\nAvailable at grocery and cooking stores or online, you can get bouquet garni bags in varying sizes in packs from four to a hundred and keep on hand for making soups, stews, sauces, and beverages.\n\nIf you don’t have a sachet available, SurfWriter Girl Patti’s husband Greg Kishel has a substitute that comes in handy. An empty teabag. When he’s making spiced, hot apple cider he puts the whole cloves in the tea bag to keep them separate from the cider.\n\nBy separating the spices this way, the only taste surprises your guests will get are how delicious the food is.\n\nAnd your family and guests will be thankful that you did.\n\nSurf’n Beach Scene Magazine\n\nSurfWriter Girls\n\nSunny Magdaug and Patti Kishel hold the exclusive rights to this copyrighted material.

Just slice it in half and eat the flesh with a spoon. That’s what SurfWriter Girls did.\n\nYum! Smooth and creamy, like eating gelato.\n\nIf you want to save the other half, cover it in wrap and store in the fridge.

They say that as long as the apes are on Gibraltar the territory will remain under British rule. Otherwise, it would revert to Spain. As you can imagine, the apes are well taken care of.\n\nFor a taste of the Mediterranean, try this simple and flavorful recipe.\n\nMediterranean Chicken and Vegetable Couscous\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into pieces, 16 oz. frozen mixed vegetables, 1 pkg. couscous mix with seasoning, ½ c. raisins, 1 ¼ c. water, 1 Tbsp. butter or margarine.\n\nDirections:\n\nIn a large skillet heat butter on medium-high heat.

This classic Filipino dish is a holiday celebration taste of home for Sunny and a delicious treat for anyone who sits around the table to enjoy it.\n\nMade with chicken (or other sliced meat), vegetables and pancit Canton noodles, pancit is cooked in a large wok with the ingredients all layered in together, simmering on top of the stove and filling the kitchen with wonderful aromas.\n\nThe cooking time is relatively fast, but the dicing and slicing takes time so you might want to prepare some of the ingredients the day before and have them ready.\n\nSunny’s Pancit Canton\n\nIngredients:\n\n4T oil, 1 sliced onion, 4T minced garlic, 2lbs. chicken thighs or breasts sliced, 2 medium-size carrots peeled and sliced, 2 C snow peas (ends removed), 4 C thinly sliced cabbage, 16 oz. mushrooms sliced, 3-4 C chicken broth, 8-16 oz. canton noodles, 4-5 T. soy sauce.\n\nDirections:\n\nHeat oil in wok (or large pan) and sauté onions 2-3 minutes. Add garlic and chicken. Sauté until chicken is brown. Add carrots, snow peas, cabbage, and mushrooms, stirring over high heat, mixing well. Pour in chicken broth and simmer over medium heat 2 minutes. Add noodles and soy sauce. Simmer until almost all liquid is absorbed and the noodles are tender.\n\nThe pancit noodles look like a big bird’s nest when you put them into the wok, but they quickly cook down and blend in with the chicken and vegetables mixture.\n\nNote: You can find pancit noodles at a grocery store that carries Asian specialties.

So, you should be able to find these flavorful mushrooms at the grocery store now. Creminis are worth looking for because they have a nutty taste and twice the flavor of white mushrooms.\n\nCremini Craze Soup Recipe\n\nCut 6 – 8 green onions into 1/4-inch pieces. Place in an oiled pan with 2 cloves of minced garlic, coarse salt, and pepper (to taste) over medium heat. Add 3 – 4 cups sliced Cremini mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are tender. Add 20 oz. chicken broth and 1 can (12oz) evaporated milk and stir together.\n\nSimmer on low heat for 10 minutes. Then puree the mixture with a hand mixer and ladle into bowls.\n\nSurfWriter Girls added some white wine to the soup during the cooking process and additional sauteed sliced mushrooms to the soup after pureeing. Top the bowls with extra pieces of green onions and serve with bread or rolls.\n\nThis definitely will put an abundance of flavor into your fall.\n\nSurf’n Beach Scene Magazine\n\nSurfWriter Girls\n\nSunny Magdaug and Patti Kishel hold the exclusive rights to this copyrighted material.

And summer vegetables – like zucchini, summer squash and bell peppers – only take 15-20 minutes in the oven.\n\nSunny used zucchinis, green and red bell peppers, and grape tomatoes. “Just cut up the vegetables into bite-size pieces and lay them on a baking pan lined with parchment paper. Drizzle cooking oil on top of the veggies to cover them. Season with salt and pepper and any other seasoning you like. For a change of pace, I added a few drops of Outerbridge’s sherry peppers sauce, which comes from Bermuda,” says Sunny.\n\n“For the best results, make sure the veggies aren’t crowded too close together on the pan or they will steam, rather than roast. Then bake in the oven at 425 degrees for 15-20 minutes.”\n\nWhen the veggies are done, serve and enjoy! Even the pickiest eaters will like this simple pleasure of summer.\n\nSurf’n Beach Scene Magazine\n\nSurfWriter Girls\n\nPlease post your comment below.

Julia Child made French cooking look easy and accessible to all from her TV show kitchen, showing people how to do elegant cooking at home and still have time to spend with guests.\n\nThe wife of an American diplomat living in Paris, Child was one of the first women to study at the famed Cordon Bleu cooking school. Combining extraordinary cooking skills with a down-to-earth style, through her TV shows and cook books she entertained and didn’t intimidate her audience.\n\nChild showed that even an omelet could be the epitome of elegance and simple sophistication when cooked the French way.\n\nIt begins with lightly whisking two or three eggs in a bowl and adding salt, pepper, or herbs to taste. Then you pour the mixture into a skillet with hot butter “just as it’s starting to foam” and shake the pan and stir the eggs briefly with a fork until they start to coagulate.\n\nThen, instead of folding the omelet on itself, she pushes it to the side of the pan and rolls it perfectly off the skillet to the plate – a French cooking technique she shows over and over again, demonstrating how easy it is. This “makes it soft and creamy on the inside and not hard and rubbery,” says Child.\n\nChild also shows how she adds fillings – such as ham, cheese, or herbs – on top of the omelet after making a slice down the length of it. The filing can be anything that you can imagine would taste good.\n\nSeeing Child’s demonstration, inspired SurfWriter Girls to make our own French omelet using her techniques.\n\nSunny layered feta cheese, shredded cooked chicken, peas with cubed carrots and topped it off with cheddar cheese.\n\nSurfWriter Girls thought it was light and heavenly – a taste of France!\n\nBon Appetit!\n\nSurf’n Beach Scene Magazine\n\nSurfWriter Girls\n\nPlease post your comment below.

SurfWriter Girl Sunny has turned this dinner classic into a tour de force that’s rich and delicious.\n\nOne of the secrets to her recipe is that, like famed cookbook author Julia Child, Sunny doesn’t skimp on the butter. “I use a whole stick of salted butter,” says Sunny, making no excuses. “With mashed potatoes it’s a time to indulge.”\n\nSometimes Sunny kicks her potatoes up a notch by adding sour cream instead of milk.\n\nAnother tip for perfect mashed potatoes comes from SurfWriter Girl Patti’s husband Greg: “When you slice the potatoes, slice them thin so that they cook faster.”\n\nTo make your own Marvelous Mashed Potatoes, here’s Sunny’s recipe.\n\nMarvelous Mashed Potatoes Recipe\n\nIngredients:\n\n4 medium potatoes peeled and sliced, 1/3 c. milk (or 1/3 c. sour cream), 1 stick butter, 2 tsps. salt, 1/2 tsp. powdered garlic, pepper to taste, 1/2 tsp. parsley flakes.\n\nDirections:\n\nBoil potatoes with salt in pot of water. When potatoes are soft remove from heat and drain most of the water, leaving some in the bottom of the pot. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher, then add other ingredients and whip with a spoon.\n\nServe the potatoes with your main dish.

With easy-to-follow recipes and beautiful photos, the book walks you through the steps of making dishes ranging from Korean Short Ribs to Moroccan Grilled Lamb.\n\nKempton, a former editor at Surfer Magazine and the president of the California Surf Museum in Oceanside, loves good food almost as much as surfing.
