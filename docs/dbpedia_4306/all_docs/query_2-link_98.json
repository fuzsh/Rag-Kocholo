Once you make Mongolian Beef at home, I am confident that you will never want to eat this dish in takeout again!\n\nYou will need soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic, sugar, and green onion for the delicious restaurant-quality glaze in Mongolian Beef.\n\nA good quality soy sauce and oyster sauce make a massive difference in any dish; I recommend using Lee Kum Kee for both of these condiments. They are authentic and delicious and affordable, and accessible.\n\nHere are a few secrets to SUPER TENDER Beef every single time!\n\nThe first one is baking soda. I got this secret from a good friend who works at a Chinese restaurant; it is honestly a game-changer. No more eating tough beef at home, and hello to juicy, tender, silky beef!\n\nThe second tip is cutting against the grain and diagonally. Always cut against the grain and sideways to get thin slices. With this tip, it doesn’t matter what type of steak you get; it will turn out perfect every time!\n\nThe final tip is to freeze the beef for 10 minutes before you slice it. This step will make it 100x easier to cut the meat.\n\nI am deep frying the beef today to make them extra tender; however, you can also pan-fry the meat.\n\nThe corn starch and egg white will also tenderize the meat and prevent it from becoming chewy or tough when cooking.\n\nDo you like Chinese Takeout Recipes?
