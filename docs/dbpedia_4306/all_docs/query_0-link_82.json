        "text": "In this paper we examine the musical and performance styles of several Chinese bands that fall loosely into the category of “Beijing punk rock.” Analyses of punk rock music are often undertaken in the context of subcultural theory, to which punk rock served as a principle case (Hebdige 1978). A more fruitful line of inquiry, exemplified by Davies (1996) uses postmodern theory to study how punk rock challenges structures of power and authority while preventing co-optation by the market forces that drive the music and fashion industry in the Western world. In the West, the postmodern condition came to be associated with the malaise surrounding the global politics of the Cold War and the disenchantment with utopian visions of modernity that had arisen over the previous century embodied in the “isms” that professed a cure for the world’s ills. In his study of punk rock in the UK, focusing on bands such as the Clash and the Sex Pistols, Davies demonstrates how these bands voiced strong critiques of post-war UK politics and US imperialism, while struggling against the commodification and ultimate dilution of the power and energy of their music, performance styles and ideas. Noting a similar trend in China, we connect the emergence of a punk rock scene in Beijing to the conditions of global postmodernity that are specific to the Chinese scene.\n\nDear colleagues, We are delighted to meet you all at the third KISMIF International Conference ‘Keep It Simple, Make It Fast!’ (KISMIF) International Conference, here at Porto, this year dedicated to the theme ‘DIY Cultures, Spaces and Places’. This initiative follows the great success of the two first KISMIF Conference editions (held in 2014 and 2015), seeking to voice the will of the many researchers who have sought to promote an annual scientific meeting for the discussion of underground music scenes and do-it-yourself culture at the highest level . The KISMIF Conference 2016 is once again focused on underground music, directing its attention this time towards the analysis of DIY cultures’ relationship to space and places. Thus, we challenge students, junior and senior teachers/researchers, as well as artists and activists, to come to the KISMIF International Conference and present works which explore the potential of the theoretical and analytical development of the intersection of music scenes, DIY culture and space under a multidimensional and multifaceted vision. We hope with this to enrich the underground scenes and DIY cultures analysis by producing innovative social theory on various spheres and levels, as well as focusing on the role of DIY culture in late modernity. Indeed, the role of music and DIY cultures is once more an important question – taking place in a world of piecemealed yet ever-present change. The space, spaces, places, borders, zones of DIY music scenes are critical variables in approaching contemporary cultures, their sounds, their practices (artistic, cultural, economic and social), their actors and their contexts. From a postcolonial and glocalized perspective, it is important to consider the changes in artistic and musical practices with an underground and/or oppositional nature in order to draw symbolic boundaries between their operating modalities and those of advanced capitalism. Territorialization and deterritorialization are indelible marks of the artistic and musical scenes in the present; they are related to immediate cosmopolitanisms, to conflicting diasporas, new power relations, gender and ethnicity. As in previous KISMIF Conferences, it is our intention to welcome reflexive contributions which consider the plurality that DIY cultural practices demonstrate in various cultural, artistic and creative fields and to move beyond music in considering artistic fields like film and video, graffiti and street art, the theatre and the performing arts, literature and poetry, radio, programming and editing, graphic design, illustration, cartoon and comics, as well as others.\n\nUsing contemporary Beijing’s alternative music scenes as a focal point, this ethnographic research seeks to enrich the understanding of China’s post-socialist urban youth by examining their cultural practices. First, this thesis offers an analytical account of the popularizing embrace of “independent cultures,” which is defined as a collection of experienceable objects and activities in musical, filmic, theatric, and other cultural forms that are well recognized yet believed by advocates as having aesthetic and participatory features that are different from those produced in the popular culture industry. While the vogue for independent cultures is substantially conditioned by the socioeconomic attributes of China’s post-socialist reform, it also involves a set of generation-specific attempts to articulate the unstructured and incongruous aspects of such seemingly consistent social transformations. Second, the thesis investigates the current popularity of independent music by examining how such music is (re)produced through social interactions. Specifically, it examines how language plays an important role in the functioning of different kinds of “music ideologies,” which is defined as a set of beliefs, feelings, and reflexive understandings of music that guide related cultural practices and produce new practitioners. By comparing the differing ways in which the specificities in the live performances of rock-based independent music and experimental music are textually mediated to the public under the influence of certain music ideologies, this thesis shows that musical genres are reproduced not only through musicality, but also the related forms of sociality encouraged in different music ideologies.\n\nWhy do they not talk about creativity in Japanese Creative Industries? Shinji Oyama Ph.D. Professor, Ritsumeikan University s-oyama@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp Japan has built a formidable reputation as one of the major forces in global cultural production. Its game, animation, fashion, and music have left a particular mark on global popular culture; and a much more extensive range of Japanese popular culture has enjoyed the substantial impact on the formation of East Asian popular culture. While Japan certainly possesses the active and diversified creative industries and is continuously ranked high on various global creativity ranking, far less is known about creative workers in Japan. There has been a growing number of researches that are focused on Japanese popular culture; nevertheless, there are very few studies on the issue of workers in Japanese creative industries. This is in contrast to growing attention to the issue of cultural workers amongst scholars researching media and culture on a global scale. This paper is an attempt to start analyzing the distinctiveness and some of the most critical issues concerning workers in Japanese creative industries in the context of heightened global scholarly interests in and conceptualization of creative workers. This paper will reveal often-neglected tensions and fissures that exist within the Japanese creative industries to analyze the issue of power and inequality in one of the largest creative industries in the world. It starts by addressing how the global creativity discourse function in Japan particularly in Cool Japan policies and discourse in the last two decades. The paper then gives some background knowledge about the structure of Japanese creative industries and discuss domestic dominance of what we call ‘old media,’ the core of the creative industries including television, newspapers, magazines, and advertising. In Japan, the old media still exerts tremendous influence upon national cultural production but has so far eluded scholarly attention at the cost of excessive attention on anime and manga, Cool Japan mainstay which is globally popular but is somewhat peripheral. This often-neglected view on Japanese creative industries reveals the tensions and fissures within the industries and the diversity of workers involved in the cultural production. In short, cultural workers within old media enjoy the unrivaled salary, perks, prestige, and job security that are protected by many regulations and their close connections with the political and business elites. For example, amongst the top 20 companies with the highest average salary, seven are old media, which would be unthinkable in the West where such list, if exist at all, would be dominated by large banks or the big technology companies. Many influential ruling LDP politicians had their sons and daughters at one of the big old media company. Cultural workers within the old media are not known and rarely talked about in terms of their creativity and innovation, because these are so matter-of-factly outsourced and burdened by young (and not so young), temporary, freelancing, female and precarious workers. The paper analyzes this uneven distribution of opportunity across gender, class, and social capital in the process of recruitment, working practices and other HR related practices that are different to the one that is known to the Western model of creative industries management. The dominance of the old media is partly explained by how well they are coping with the forces of globalization and neo-liberalization. The old media more or less successfully eschew globalization in a very nation-centric way, sometimes at odds with the neoliberal logic driving creative industries, and their worker management, elsewhere. What becomes apparent in this paper is how creativity is managed very differently in Japanese creative industries than the Western model that is considered the norm in the literature on the issue of creativity and its management."
