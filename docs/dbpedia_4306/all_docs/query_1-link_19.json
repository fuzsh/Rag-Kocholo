        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe Southern Hemisphere ocean circulation is characterized by the eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the meridional overturning circulation (MOC). The MOC appears different depending on whether it is zonally averaged on surfaces of constant density or on surfaces of constant pressure (Döös and Webb 1994), but south of 40°S, both types of averaging show two cells. The upper cell consists of the near-surface northward-flowing branch and the mid-depth southward-flowing water, while the bottom water flows northward to form the lower cell. The upper cell is often referred to as the Deacon cell (e.g., Speer et al. 2000). In this paper, we call the lower cell the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) cell.\n\nUnder the influence of the strong westerly wind over the Southern Ocean, the deep waters in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans outcrop in the Southern Ocean, making subsurface water masses susceptible to changes in air–sea fluxes. Indeed, significant changes in subsurface water masses in the Southern Hemisphere oceans have been observed in recent decades, which include freshening (Aoki et al. 2005; Rintoul 2007; Böning et al. 2008; Durack and Wijffels 2010), warming of mid-depth waters (700–1100 m) (Gille 2002, 2008; Böning et al. 2008), and warming of deep waters (>3000 m) (Purkey and Johnson 2010; Kouketsu et al. 2011). Some but not all of these changes can be explained by the southward shift of the ACC axis (Cai et al. 2010; Meijers et al. 2011). The southward shift of the ACC (Sokolov and Rintoul 2009a), in turn, is likely associated with the southward shift and intensification of the westerlies as quantified by the increasing southern annular mode (SAM) index (Marshall 2003; http://www.nerc-bas.ac.uk/icd/gjma/sam.html) (Fig. 1). A least squares fit between 1988 and 2008 shows an increase in the zonal wind stress at a rate of 5%–8% decade−1.\n\na. Antarctic Circumpolar Current transport\n\nThe subsurface hydrographic changes can lead to changes in the meridional slope of the isopycnals, which result in changes in the baroclinic transport of the ACC. However, hydrographic observations have detected no significant decadal changes in the meridional isopycnal tilts and concurrent changes in ACC transport. Cunningham et al. (2003) and Renault et al. (2011) reported no significant changes in the baroclinic transport across the Drake Passage from 1975 to 2000 and from 1975 to 2006, respectively. Similarly, no significant changes in baroclinic transport have been reported south of Africa between 0° and 30°E (Legeais et al. 2005; Swart et al. 2008) or across 140°E (Rintoul and Sokolov 2001; Rintoul et al. 2002). Steady baroclinic ACC transport has also been inferred in the circumpolar average of hydrographic data along the dynamic height contours from the 1960s to the 2000s (Böning et al. 2008) as well as in satellite altimeter data from 1991 to 2000 (Sokolov and Rintoul 2009b).\n\nAn explanation for this limited sensitivity of the baroclinic ACC transport to increased wind stress (Fig. 1) is that mesoscale eddies counteract the increase in meridional isopycnal tilts caused by anomalous Ekman transport. This “eddy saturation” (Straub 1993) was found in eddy-permitting ocean-only models (Hallberg and Gnanadesikan 2006; Yang et al. 2007) and in an eddy-permitting ocean–atmosphere coupled model (Farneti et al. 2010) as well as in a satellite observation (Meredith et al. 2004).\n\nChanges in the total transport are more difficult to observe because it is necessary to know the depth-independent barotropic component of the transport, which does not show up in hydrographic observations and has a much shorter time scale (days) than the baroclinic component (years). Direct velocity measurements using mooring (Whitworth and Peterson 1985) or lowered acoustic Doppler current profilers (Renault et al. 2011) have been used to estimate total transport. The different time scales of baroclinic and barotropic responses in ACC transport mean that short-period fluctuations in the bottom pressure or sea surface height anomaly can be associated with the barotropic component of transport fluctuations (Olbers and Lettmann 2007). Satellite gravity observations can detect these short-term bottom pressure fluctuations (Zlotnicki et al. 2007; Bergmann and Dobslaw 2012). In gravity records from 2003 to 2005, Zlotnicki et al. (2007) found a decreasing trend in bottom pressure records averaged along the southern edge of the ACC.\n\nAt decadal time scales, the ACC transport in coupled models shows both increasing and decreasing trends (Wang et al. 2011) although all atmospheric models show an increase in the zonal westerly jet in the midlatitude Southern Hemisphere. This suggests a significant role for driving mechanisms other than wind stress, such as buoyancy (Hogg 2010), mesoscale eddies (Straub 1993), and eddy parameterization in the model (Kuhlbrodt et al. 2012). It is interesting that two recent efforts to realistically simulate these effects by using eddy-permitting resolutions (⅓° in latitude and longitude) in 100 model year runs (Graham et al. 2012) and by using a four-dimensional variational (4D-VAR) data-assimilation technique (Wang et al. 2010) both show a decrease in the ACC total transport through the Drake Passage under increasing zonal wind stress. Wang et al. (2011) and Graham et al. (2012) explained this decrease as a result of narrowing of the ACC.\n\nAlthough no significant trends have been detected on decadal time scales, there are some studies suggesting a relationship between the wind and the ACC transport at interannual time scales. Meredith et al. (2004) found a significant correlation between the SAM index and the bottom pressure record from approximately 1000-m depth during the 1980s and 1990s on the south side of the Drake Passage, a proxy for ACC transport at subseasonal time scales. In ocean general circulation models (OGCMs), Yang et al. (2007) and Treguier et al. (2010) also found a statistically significant correlation between ACC transport and the SAM index at interannual time scales.\n\nb. Meridional overturning circulation transport\n\nThe relationship between zonal wind changes and MOC is not intuitively clear. Lacking observations, studies of the variability of the MOC have used numerical simulations. Using a coarse-resolution coupled model, Hall and Visbeck (2002) explained oceanic responses to the westerly wind increase as anomalous northward Ekman transport, which leads to increased meridional isopycnal tilts (i.e., increased ACC transport) and increased MOC south of 40°S. In simulated responses of the Southern Ocean to a southward shift of the subpolar westerly jet (Oke and England 2004), a 5.4° latitudinal shift over a 100-yr simulation caused an insignificant change to the Deacon cell strength and a slight (−1.1 Sv; 1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1) decrease in the AABW cell. The reason for the AABW decrease was not clear. In a model with ⅙° resolution (Hallberg and Gnanadesikan 2006), a 20% increase in wind stress produced about a 20% increase in the Deacon and AABW cells, although the ACC transport showed only a 3%–5% increase (eddy saturation). An increase in MOC strength in response to an enhanced westerly jet was also found in an eddy-permitting ocean–atmosphere coupled model (Farneti et al. 2010) as well as in an eddy-permitting ocean-only model (Yang et al. 2007). These simulated increases in MOC with enhanced westerlies can be explained by enhanced isopycnal eddy diffusivity in response to eddy kinetic energy increase (Meredith et al. 2011; Abernathey et al. 2011). Under the assumption that increased eddy kinetic energy also enhances the diapycnal diffusivity, an increase in the AABW cell can similarly be expected (Ito and Marshall 2008; Saenko et al. 2011).\n\nThe paucity of observational data showing the variability of the Southern Hemisphere MOC reflects the difficulty of observing the Southern Hemisphere oceans in full-depth and land-to-land coverage. Nevertheless, with the internationally coordinated efforts of ship-based hydrographic programs, it is now possible to discuss the difference in the Southern Hemisphere circulation at decadal intervals. Given the internal variability of the ocean (Wunsch 2008), however, it is imperative that we combine the observed results with simulation estimates. In this paper, we report the results of one such effort. The OGCMs used in this work, as well as the box inverse model used to combine the hydrographic observations, are described in section 2. The results are separately shown and discussed for the meridional transports in section 3 and for the zonal transports in section 4.\n\n2. Models\n\na. Box inverse model\n\nEight hydrographic sections across the Southern Hemisphere oceans have been occupied at least twice; once in the 1980s and 1990s as a part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) (Fig. 2), which we will call the WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP), and once in the 2000s as part of the International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project and the Climate Variability and Predictability Program (Fig. 3), which we will call Revisit. The details of the two occupations are summarized in Table 1.\n\nThe hydrographic sections and the continental landmasses define the horizontal extent of the boxes, while the neutral density surfaces (Jackett and McDougall 1997), the sea surface, and ocean bottom define the vertical extent. Following Sloyan and Rintoul (2001), we labeled five water masses according to their approximate neutral density γn; thermocline water (TW) for γn < 26.0, intermediate water (IW) for 26.0 < γn < 27.4, Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW) for 27.4 < γn < 28.0, Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW) for 28.0 < γn < 28.2, and Bottom Water (BW) for 28.2 < γn.\n\nOur calculations used the measured temperature and salinity to derive the geostrophic velocity across the sections with assumed zero-velocity surfaces. The velocity corrections at these initial zero-velocity surfaces and the diapycnal fluxes were then estimated so as to conserve the volume, temperature, and salinity in each box. The results are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Details of the inverse box model are described in the appendix.\n\nb. Ocean general circulation models\n\nAs the eddy saturation hypothesis suggests, it is desirable that a simulation model of the Southern Ocean has an eddy-resolving grid (Hallberg and Gnanadesikan 2006; Farneti et al. 2010). At the same time, biases and drifts in the model need to be kept minimal, which requires a long, preferably millennial, run time. A millennial run of an eddy-resolving model is still beyond modern computers' capability and compromises have to be found. One way is to parameterize eddies and use coarser grids for longer run time. The coupled models in phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project employed this approach. The ACC in these models have been studied by Wang et al. (2011). Another is to assimilate observed data to minimize biases and drifts. Indeed, an eddy-resolving assimilation model of the Southern Ocean provides a realistic description of the Southern Ocean circulation (Mazloff et al. 2010), but the 4D-VAR method, which preserves perfect mass and momentum balances, is computationally expensive and decadal runs are still difficult at eddy-resolving resolutions. We use three OGCMs to represent three different approaches to these requirements. The OGCM for the Earth Simulator (OFES) has an “eddy resolving” grid but is not constrained by observed data. In an attempt to minimize initial transients, the model had been spun up for 50 years by climatological forcing (Masumoto et al. 2004) before a hindcast run from 1950 was started (Sasaki et al. 2008). The Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) model (Carton and Giese 2008; Carton et al. 2012) and the K7 model (Masuda et al. 2010) are constrained by observed data. The SODA model has an “eddy permitting” resolution but uses less computationally expensive method of data assimilation than the 4D-VAR method at the cost of errors in mass and momentum balance. The K7 model is a 4D-VAR model but does not resolve eddies. The details of these model implementations are summarized in Table 2.\n\nc. Comparison between observation and OGCMs\n\nThe OGCM results and the observations are compared across a meridional section at 30°E in Fig. 4. All data were linearly interpolated onto the coarsest model grid (K7). All OGCMs captured the approximate distribution of water masses, with salty surface water around γn = 26.0 from the Indian Ocean, the Antarctic Intermediate Water salinity minimum along γn = 27.4, the high-salinity signature of North Atlantic Deep Water at 27.4 < γn < 28.0, and Antarctic Bottom Water 28.0 < γn. Reflecting its low-resolution grid, the K7 model showed the smoothest water mass distribution, which led to the least-inclined isopycnal surfaces. In the OGCMs, salty North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) extended more broadly than suggested by the observations, even in the OFES model that had the finest grid, suggesting that the OGCMs overestimated the diapycnal diffusion of salinity. The OGCMs successfully reproduced the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) salinity minimum intrusion along γn = 27.4, except in the K7 model, where the salinity minimum barely extended northward below the high-salinity surface water at 40°S. As a result, in the K7 model the salinity around γn = 27.4 was higher than in the observations or the other OGCMs (Fig. 4d′), leading to a shallow bias of the isopycnal. For the K7 model, we therefore used γn = 27.6 as the boundary between thermocline water and intermediate water. In the K7 model, overmixing is also indicated by the low-salinity bias in the high-salinity water from the Indian Ocean around γn = 26.0 (Fig. 4d′). For the SODA and OFES models (Figs. 4b′, c′), the largest differences were found around 39°S above 2000 m, whose structure suggest that the models did not resolve the observed eddy (Fig. 4a). The near-surface salinity in OFES south of 50°S was too high, where the data-assimilated SODA and K7 model performed better, suggesting errors in the surface freshwater fluxes.\n\nModel drift is examined against one of few observed changes in the Southern Ocean—contraction of AABW (Purkey and Johnson 2012). Because all OGCMs employed in this study do not explicitly have a sea ice component, the AABW production processes are mimicked in the models either by nudging to monthly climatological salinity at the surface and the southern end of the model domain or by assimilating to observed data (see Table 2). All OGCMs showed decreases in the AABW volume (Fig. 5) although the OFES model underestimated and the K7 model overestimated the trend. The agreement does not mean that these models are free from drifts and biases. Indeed, it was found that the ACC fronts in the K7 model showed an unexplainable northward drift (see Figs. 13–16, described in greater detail below). The agreement, however, shows that the parameterized diabatic processes (diapycnal mixing, AABW production, etc.) in the models work reasonably well and that the relaxation processes are at least in the right direction. We therefore regard trends reproduced in these models as likely to have occurred in the real oceans.\n\n3. Meridional overturning circulation\n\nMost of the WOCE hydrographic data used in Fig. 2 overlap with the data used by Ganachaud and Wunsch (2000) and Sloyan and Rintoul (2001). Our results for meridional transport are mostly consistent with these previous works within the uncertainty. This section discusses the MOCs, as quantified by the transport across the hydrographic sections along approximately 30°S.\n\na. South Pacific Ocean: Section P6\n\nThe box inverse model estimated a 12 Sv increase in the total northward transport across the South Pacific section P6 (Fig. 6, Total), although the difference was not statistically significant with overlapping uncertainties. The OGCMs did not show this increase. There were nonnegligible differences among OGCMs as well as between the OGCMs and the inverse model. A particularly large one involves the WHP Upper Circumpolar Deep Water, where the OGCMs estimated southward transport between 0 and −5 Sv (consistent with the Revisit box inverse estimate), whereas the inverse model estimated it at −20 Sv. Comparison of the transport and isopycnals of two occupations (Fig. 7) shows that the γn = 28.0 contour for the 1992 (WHP) data had a steep slope along the western side of the Tonga–Kermadec trench, which explains the southward jet of about 10 Sv near 182°E (green circle on Fig. 7). There were also differences in the barotropic correction at the assumed zero-velocity surface with the 1992 barotropic flow having a more negative (southward) component. Because the narrow jet along the Tonga–Kermadec trench was neither seen in the OGCMs (not shown) nor in the Revisit observations, it is plausible that this jet was a transient feature.\n\nIt was possible to reduce the negative bias in the WHP Upper Circumpolar Deep Water by prescribing a greater covariance to the barotropic adjustments across this section, but this would add a positive bias to the Antarctic Intermediate Water transport and the total transport, that is, the Indonesian Throughflow (see section 3b). Given the reasonable agreement of the total transport of the current solution with the OGCMs on Fig. 6, we did not adopt the adjusted solution.\n\nThe box inverse model also estimated a significant change in the thermocline water, which the OGCMs did not duplicate. This is probably a result of the box inverse model's trying to adjust the drastic increase in the Upper Circumpolar Deep Water in the least-constrained layers.\n\nIn summary, the OGCMs did not show a significant change in the MOC transport across the South Pacific section. The increases shown by the box inverse model in the Upper Circumpolar Deep Water and the thermocline water are probably due to a transient jet along the deep western boundary (Fig. 7) and not a decadal trend.\n\nb. South Indian Ocean: Section I5\n\nIn all density ranges, the transport estimates for 1987 (WHP) and 2009 (Revisit) given by the box inverse model did not show significant differences beyond the overlap of the uncertainties (Fig. 8). The OGCM results also did not show significant trends (discussed in more detail in section 3d).\n\nBecause transport through the Bering Strait connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is small (<1 Sv; Roach et al. 1995), the total transport through I5 or P6 is almost equal to the Indonesian Throughflow. A recent estimate based on 3-yr mooring observations of the transport is 15 Sv (Gordon et al. 2010), which suggests that the K7 and OFES models underestimated and the SODA model overestimated the transport.\n\nc. South Atlantic Ocean: Section A10\n\nAs was the case in the South Indian Ocean, the transport across the South Atlantic ocean estimated by the box inverse model for 1992/93 (WHP) and 2003 (Revisit) did not show a significant difference (Fig. 9).\n\nd. Discussion\n\nLinear trends were tested in the monthly model output by fitting a straight line to the time series with covariances prescribed by the temporal variance assuming that each monthly transport is statistically independent. We regarded an estimated trend as significant when a zero trend was not included within one standard uncertainty. We regarded a trend as robust when the trends estimated by all three OGCMs were significant. With this criterion, robust trends were found in 1) positive/negative trends in the total transport across P6/I5 (reflecting the Indonesian Throughflow transport), respectively, 2) a positive trend in UCDW across P6, and 3) a negative trend in Lower Circumpolar Deep Water across I5. Lee et al. (2010) studied the interannual variability of the Indonesian Throughflow in 14 ocean data assimilation products and found that the models showed reasonable agreement, particularly after the 1990s, and the most consistent signal was an increase in transport from 1993 to 2000 associated with the strengthening of the tropical Pacific trade winds. This increase in the Indonesian Throughflow appears in the total panel in Figs. 6 and 8, which explains the trend 1). The trends 2) and 3) might be associated with the response of the low-latitude Pacific and Indian Oceans to this trade winds anomaly (Wijffels and Meyers 2004).\n\nAs described in the introduction, some simulations have shown an increase in the MOC strength in response to the increased westerly jets (Fig. 1). We examined the MOC strength at about 30°S by adding the transports across the Atlantic (A10), Indian (I5), and Pacific (P6) Oceans (Fig. 10). The northward-flowing branch of the Deacon cell is represented by the sum of thermocline and intermediate waters, and the southward-flowing branch is the sum of Upper and Lower Circumpolar Deep Waters.\n\nAs found in Yang et al. (2007), the Deacon cell in the SODA model showed an increasing trend (Fig. 10a). The positive trend in the upper branch of the Deacon cell was also found in K7 and OFES outputs, but these trends were not statistically significant given that monthly outputs are statistically independent (with estimated trends for the SODA, K7, and OFES models being 0.8 ± 1.3, 0.6 ± 0.9, and 0.2 ± 1.0 Sv decade−1, respectively). The southward-flowing mid-depth branch (UCDW + LCDW, Fig. 10b) did not show a robust trend with only the OFES trend (0.7 ± 0.5 Sv decade−1) being significant. As shown in Fig. 7, the box inverse model estimates of the UCDW transport suffered from the transient jet.\n\nInterestingly, two of the three OGCMs showed significant negative trends for the AABW branch (Fig. 10c) with a large decrease from 1990 to 1992 found in all three models followed by a trend in the OFES model and a more pronounced negative trend in the K7 model (−0.8 ± 0.6 Sv decade−1 for OFES, −0.0 ± 0.7 Sv decade−1 for SODA, and −1.0 ± 0.3 Sv decade−1 for K7). The box inverse results do not resolve the decreasing trends, but the uncertainties estimated by the box inverse model were greater than the decrease in the OGCM transports, which means the estimated trends were not inconsistent with the observation. The negative trend is opposite to a theoretical prediction that AABW export will increase under enhanced mixing resulting from the wind increase (Ito and Marshall 2008; Saenko et al. 2011). There are three possible reasons for the discrepancy; first, the use of monthly average velocity and monthly average thickness in the OGCM outputs might miss eddy transport owing to the velocity-thickness correlation [however, an eddy-permitting simulation showed that the eddy-driven component of the MOC is small at 30°S (Saenko et al. 2011)]; second, a monotonic relationship in which increased wind stress leads to increased mixing might not hold; and third, another mechanism not considered in the theoretical models such as time dependence, easterly Antarctic winds (Stewart and Thompson 2012), or global constraints (Nikurashin and Vallis 2011; Shakespeare and Hogg 2012) might not be negligible.\n\nIndeed, the time dependence of the background stratification not considered in the theories offers a partial explanation of the transport reduction. The reduction in transport can be caused by reduction of the area that AABW occupies along 30°S or by reduction of the velocity of the deep northward current. Figure 11a shows that the AABW area across 30°S had a negative trend but the rate was much less than that of the transport reduction in Fig. 10c (e.g., for OFES, the area would disappear in about 60 decades whereas the transport would disappear in about 12 decades). The AABW reduction is therefore due to the combined effect of area reduction and velocity reduction.\n\nThe reason for the area reduction, in turn, might be related to the reduction in AABW volume. Purkey and Johnson (2012) compared WOCE and Revisit hydrographic data and found an 8.2 ± 2.6 Sv reduction in the volume of water below θ = 0°C. This reduction was partly reproduced by the K7 and OFES models (Fig. 11b). The AABW volume change is the difference between production by winter convection and removal by northward export (by the deep currents) and upward export (by diabatic mixing). If the northward export is declining (Fig. 10c), the volume reduction therefore is a result of reduced production and/or enhanced upward export by diabatic mixing. Because both the K7 and OFES models use relaxation boundary conditions at the southern boundary of the model region (Table 2), they cannot accurately estimate AABW production. The strength of winter convection can be calculated in the models by the volume of water that flows downward across the bottom of the mixed layer. For simplicity, we fixed the bottom of the mixed layer at z = 300 m, and estimated the downward volume flux as the horizontal convergence of water of γn > 28.0 (Fig. 11c). The K7 model showed a slight increase in AABW production, whereas the OFES model did not show a clear trend. The reduction in the AABW volume (Fig. 11a) is thus a result of reduced production of new AABW at the southern relaxation boundary and/or enhanced upward export of diabatic mixing. With the present configuration of the OGCMs, it is difficult to separate the contributions of these two factors.\n\n4. Antarctic Circumpolar Current\n\nWhen examining the ACC transport, we could have decomposed the transport into water masses defined by density, but we noted that the observed variability in the ACC is characterized by movement of water masses in the meridional rather than vertical direction (e.g., Sokolov and Rintoul 2009a; Meijers et al. 2011). Considering that most of the zonal transport is concentrated along fronts, with two major fronts being the Subantarctic Front and the Polar Front (e.g., Rintoul and Sokolov 2001; Swart et al. 2008; Renault et al. 2011), we divided the sections meridionally into three components: south, north, and central (Fig. 12). The central component includes the two major fronts. Sokolov and Rintoul (2009a) established that certain dynamic height contours follow these fronts. Using the altimetric sea surface height anomaly added on top of the climatological dynamic height above 2500 dbar, Sokolov and Rintoul (2009a) identified 12 fronts across the ACC (their Fig. 3). For the hydrographic data, we used the dynamic height anomaly calculated with reference to 3000 dbar and defined the central part as the region between the 1.11- and 2.40-m dynamic height contours. We also constructed the sea surface height by using the same climatological and altimetric data used by Sokolov and Rintoul (2009a). Our definition of the central part corresponds to the region between the dynamic height labels of 0.98 and 2.17 m from Sokolov and Rintoul (2009a), which were located between the northern branch of the southern ACC Front (N-SACCF) and the southern branch of the Polar Front (S-PF) and between the subantarctic zone/subtropical zone (SAZ/STZ) and the northern branch of the Subantarctic Front (N-SAF), respectively. The sea surface height is available in the OGCM outputs and we defined the central part using the sea surface heights: −0.41 and −1.42 m for OFES (but −0.25 and −1.42 m for 30°E), −0.16 and −1.41 m for SODA (but −0.15 and −1.41 m for 30°E), and −0.36 and −1.13 m for K7 (but −0.55 and −1.00 m for 30°E).\n\nAbove a depth of 3000 m, the central part is further separated into the barotropic (vertically uniform) and baroclinic components. The velocity at 3000 m defines the barotropic component, so that the baroclinic velocity is zero at 3000 m. The transport below 3000 m is called the bottom component. The transport carried by the region north and south of the central part is called the north and south component, respectively (Fig. 12). The corresponding decomposition that we applied to the box inverse model is summarized in Table 3.\n\nFor the box inverse model, the uncertainty introduced by this decomposition is difficult to estimate, and we used the uncertainty in the thermocline water box of 5 Sv as a nominal measure of the uncertainty. For the OGCM results, we plotted the standard deviation of the monthly output as a measure of the uncertainty.\n\na. Transport across 115° and 142°E\n\nThe box inverse model estimated a 6-Sv reduction across 115°E, which is not statistically significant. Indeed, the OGCMs showed no significant changes in total transport (Fig. 13a). The decomposition shows that all components were steady over the period 1986–2008. We note that the variance was much less for the baroclinic component (Fig. 13c) than for the total transport, and the largest variance was in the north component.\n\nThe K7 output showed a positive drift in the south component and a negative drift in the north component. This was caused by a northward drift of the fronts (about 1.5° lat decade−1). The cause of the drift is not known.\n\nBecause of the geometric constraints, the transport across 142°E (Fig. 14) behaved similarly to the transport across 115°E; a steady baroclinic component, a particularly variable north component, and northward shift of the fronts in K7. The decomposition of the box inverse model, however, showed slightly different contributions (Table 3). Across 115°E, the 6-Sv reduction of the total transport was a result of 4-Sv increase of the north component, and a 9-Sv decrease of the central (= barotropic + baroclinic + bottom) component. Across 142°E, the north component increased by about 22 Sv, which was offset by a 11-Sv decrease of the south component and a 16-Sv decrease in the central component (Table 3). Across 115°E, the fronts are almost zonal and parallel to the major topographic ridge (Southeast Indian Ridge), whereas across 142°E, the fronts meander to cross the Southeast Indian Ridge (Sokolov and Rintoul 2009a). Although the deviations of the front positions as observed by the altimetry are not very different between 115° and 142°E [Figs. 9 and 10 of Sallée et al. (2008)], the fronts are locally parallel to the hydrographic section across 142°E such that the large variability was generated.\n\nb. Transport across 30°E\n\nThe box inverse model estimated a large (19 Sv) reduction of the total transport between the WOCE and Revisit occupations (Fig. 15a). This was a result of a 17-Sv reduction in the north component, a 7-Sv reduction in the south component, and a 5-Sv increase in the central part (Table 3). Again, the baroclinic component was steady in the OGCMs and the box inverse model. Because the north part of this section is dominated by the Agulhas current and its return flow, making it one of the most variable regions in the Southern Ocean [e.g., Fig. 10 of Chelton et al. (2011)], we expected that the variability from the north part would be the largest here.\n\nThe north component has a complicated flow structure and we note that all OGCMs failed to reproduce the strong westward flow (i.e., southward deepening isopycnals) present in the observation (around 40°S in Fig. 4). As a result, the north transports of the OGCMs showed a large positive (eastward) bias (Fig. 15f). This positive bias was compensated by a negative bias in the barotropic and baroclinic components. The negative bias in the baroclinic component suggests weaker stratification. Given that the baroclinic components in OGCMs were always smaller than the box inverse estimates in other sections (Figs. 13c and 14c) this negative bias is probably caused by the use of monthly average output in the model and excessive diffusion in the OGCMs (or lack of spatial resolution).\n\nc. Transport across the Drake Passage (68°W)\n\nIn the Drake Passage, the Subantarctic Front is next to the northernmost hydrographic station and consequently the north region does not exist.\n\nThe transport across the Drake Passage is probably the best constrained of all longitudes [e.g., Table 2 of Renault et al. (2011)]. The transport (mean plus or minus one standard deviation) estimated by the OGCMs were 113 ± 6 Sv (K7), 142 ± 5 Sv (OFES), 154 ± 6 Sv (SODA). The low bias of the K7 model is probably due to its excessive diapycnal mixing (Fig. 4). The other values are slightly larger than previous estimates listed in Renault et al. (2011), but they are compatible with recent estimates using an eddy-resolving data-assimilated estimate of 153 ± 5 Sv (Mazloff et al. 2010).\n\nThe OGCMs did not show a decreasing trend in the total transport that can explain the decrease estimated by the box inverse model (Fig. 16a). The decomposition of the box inverse model shows that this decrease is largely explained by the reduction in the barotropic transport (Fig. 16d). The baroclinic transport was rather steady except in the K7 model. The reduction in the baroclinic transport in K7 was compensated by an increase in the south component. This was a result of northward migration of the southern boundary of the central part (about 2° lat decade−1, not shown).\n\nd. Discussion\n\nThe box inverse model estimated a decrease in the total zonal transport from the WHP period (1987–95) to the Revisit period (2003–09). The decomposition of the total transport (Table 3) demonstrates that the baroclinic transport carried mainly by the Subantarctic and Polar Fronts (baroclinic component in the central part) varied much less than the total transport except across 142°E, where the Polar Front flows almost parallel to the hydrographic section probably leading to the variable transport in the central part. The variability in the estimated total transport therefore came from other components—the largest one being the north (across 30° and 142°E) and barotropic (across 115°E and 68°W) components.\n\nThe steadiness of the baroclinic transport was also confirmed in the OGCM outputs, where the standard deviation of the baroclinic transport was always smaller than the standard deviation of the total transport.\n\nGiven these steady baroclinic transport estimates and the much longer time scale of baroclinic responses than barotropic one (Hughes et al. 1999; Olbers and Lettmann 2007), we conclude that the decrease in total transport estimated by the box inverse model reflects contributions from short-period fluctuations, not a robust trend. This conclusion is consistent with past studies detecting no trends in the baroclinic transport across the Drake Passage (Cunningham et al. 2003; Renault et al. 2011), south of Tasmania (Rintoul et al. 2002), and south of Africa (Swart et al. 2008).\n\nIn the OGCMs, the variability of the total transport was often correlated with the south component (Table 4). In discussing the response of the ACC to atmospheric disturbances, Hughes et al. (1999) demonstrated the importance of a “southern mode,” a barotropic mode propagating mostly, but not always, along the closed geostrophic contours for the Coriolis parameter f and water depth H of f/H circumnavigating the Antarctica shelf break. We speculate that the significant correlation in the south transport is explained as a result of the southern mode. The relatively low correlations across the 115°E south section might be related to the relatively narrow shape of the southern mode there [Fig. 4d of Hughes and Stepanov (2004)].\n\nThe trend in each component was estimated in the same way as for the meridional transport. The only significant trend was found in the barotropic component through the Drake Passage with −0.45 ± 0.27, −0.60 ± 0.43, and −0.50 ± 0.28 Sv decade−1 trends for SODA, K7, and OFES, respectively. The box inverse model also estimated a significant decrease in the barotropic component (Fig. 16d and Table 3). This result appears at odds with the enhancement of the westerly jet over the Southern Ocean observed mainly in the 1990s (Marshall 2003), but a close look at the SAM index (Fig. 17) shows that the decadal increase in the 1990s included conspicuous periods of decrease around the years 1994 and 2000. A close look at the time series of the OGCMs (Fig. 17) shows that the significant decreasing barotropic trend can be attributed to the barotropic response of the ACC to these wind decrease events rather than decadal trends. The wind change in 2000 might be a part of a larger change in wind pattern observed over the Pacific and Indian Oceans (Lee and McPhaden 2008). For the shorter period from 2003 to 2005, Zlotnicki et al. (2007) found a decreasing trend in the bottom pressure averaged along the southern edge of the ACC, as indicated by satellite gravity data. The OFES and K7 models showed a slight decrease over the period (Fig. 17), although their estimated decrease rate [1.2 cm (H2O) yr−1, corresponding to −3.7 ± 1.5 Sv yr−1] was much larger than ours. The decrease in the barotropic component estimated in the box inverse model is therefore likely a short time scale fluctuation caused by the wind.\n\nIndeed, the total transport anomaly at all four sections is well correlated with SAM when smoothed by a 25-month low-pass filter (Fig. 18) with correlation coefficients between 0.37 (p = 0.0) for SODA through the Drake Passage and 0.85 (p = 0.03) for OFES across 115°E, where p is the probability that the estimated correlation occurs by chance. This extends to other key sections the finding at the Drake Passage (Meredith et al. 2004; Treguier et al. 2010) that transport estimated in the Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling Project (OCCAM) is correlated with the SAM index at interannual time scales.\n\nWang et al. (2010) found a decreasing trend of −1.80 Sv decade−1 in the ACC transport across the three key sections (Drake Passage, 20°E, and 147°E) in a 4D-VAR German contribution to estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (GECCO) model from 1960 to 2001. In our OGCMs, that trend was found in SODA (−2.30 ± 0.56 Sv decade−1) and K7 (−0.85 ± 0.54 Sv decade−1) but not in OFES (0.80 ± 0.40 Sv decade−1). Wang et al. (2010) argued that the decrease in total transport could be attributed to different density layers, indicating a baroclinic structure in the decreasing transport, accompanied by decadal changes in diapycnal transport among the layers. Our 4D-VAR model (K7) also showed a decreasing trend in the baroclinic component (−7.95 ± 0.60 Sv decade−1) but compensated by an increasing trend in the south component (7.82 ± 0.62 Sv decade−1). The decrease estimated by the box inverse model (Table 3) was −4 Sv for the baroclinic and −2 Sv for the sum of the baroclinic, north, and south components. Taking the median dates for the WHP (January 1993) and Revisit (January 2004) data, these signify a trend of −0.4 and −0.2 Sv decade−1, respectively. Given the a priori uncertainty for the thermocline water (γn < 26.0) of 5 Sv, the estimates by the box inverse model are inconclusive. The trend estimated by the OGCMs is too small to detect using repeat hydrographic measurements revisited at decadal intervals (Keller et al. 2007; Wunsch 2008). In an eddy-permitting OGCM experiment, Treguier et al. (2010) found a decreasing trend in the ACC transport through the Drake Passage that they attributed to model drift because a larger decrease happened during the model spinup. We found a similar long-term trend with decreasing amplitude in the K7 results, which also showed meridional drifts in the front positions (Figs. 15 and 16). The model drifts were not clear in the OFES and SODA outputs (not shown). Given the discrepancy between the decadal running time for these models and millennial time scale required for thermohaline equilibrium, further data collection and extended model runs are required to detect the ACC trend.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nFor the MOC strength, we find no significant decadal changes in our OGCM analysis and in the box inverse model. All OGCMs suggested strengthening of the Deacon cell but the trends were not statistically significant. No model showed strengthening in the AABW cell; indeed the K7 and OFES models showed a statistically significant decreasing trend in the AABW strength. Part of this decrease is explained by the AABW volume contraction (Purkey and Johnson 2012). In the K7 and OFES models, this AABW contraction is associated with the reduced production and/or enhanced mixing with the water masses above. The hydrographic data used in the box inverse model do not have sufficient temporal resolution to detect the AABW export trend, but the decreasing trend found in the K7 and OFES models are within the uncertainty of the inverse box model estimates.\n\nFor the ACC transport in our OGCMs and box inverse model, we confirmed the stability of the baroclinic transport (Rintoul and Sokolov 2001; Rintoul et al. 2002; Cunningham et al. 2003; Legeais et al. 2005; Swart et al. 2008; Böning et al. 2008; Sokolov and Rintoul 2009b; Renault et al. 2011), in particular, the transport carried by Subantarctic and Polar Fronts. The overall transports through the four key sections, however, varied with barotropic components and with meridional migration of the fronts, both of which explain the apparent decrease of 5–21 Sv found in the box inverse model estimates. We find the overall transport anomalies at interannual time scales are well correlated to the SAM index.\n\nIt is interesting that the stability of the MOC (at least for water masses above and including Lower Circumpolar Deep Water) and the ACC transports from the 1980s to the 2000s was found under the increasing westerly jet over the Southern Ocean (Fig. 1). The stability could be a useful condition to constrain theories for the MOC and ACC. The eddy saturation of the ACC is model dependent and has not yet been fully formulated. The zonal wind enhancement can lead to an increase in the AABW cell if diapycnal diffusivity is enhanced (Ito and Marshall 2008; Saenko et al. 2011), but the AABW export may become weaker if the enhanced wind deepens the thermocline (Nikurashin and Vallis 2011; Shakespeare and Hogg 2012). In simulation models, the link from large-scale wind and buoyancy input at the surface to diapycnal mixing through eddy generation depends on model configuration and parameterization. Observational constraints would be of great use to study the relationship.\n\nThe stability of the MOC and the ACC found in this work is limited by the model run time and the data's temporal span as well as by the uncertainties in the estimates. The uncertainties for the box inverse results were typically ±5 Sv or more (e.g., Fig. 10). Keller et al. (2007) argued that with 5-Sv uncertainty in revisit observation every 10 years of a zonal hydrographic section, it would take more than 100 years to detect a trend in a simulated Atlantic MOC. A practical strategy, at least in near future, is to seek trends in well-calibrated, preferably data-constrained simulations and to use data as consistency checks. We reemphasize the importance of further data collection and extended model runs."
