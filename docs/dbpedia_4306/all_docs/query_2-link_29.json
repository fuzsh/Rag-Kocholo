        "text": "Before snorkeling, select a snorkel location that has clear, calm water. Contact the local snorkel store for snorkel reports or book a snorkel tour where guides take you to the best snorkel spots.\n\nIf in doubt, don’t go out. That’s what we say here in Hawaii when we are considering snorkeling and assessing the ocean’s conditions.\n\nAvoid snorkeling after recent rainfall if the water is murky. If there are waves or signs indicating high surf or current, avoid snorkeling or getting in the ocean.\n\nLanai offers many snorkel locations that have crystal clear waters and healthy reef.\n\nDolphins or Nai’a are considered ‘aumakua in our Hawaiian culture. ’Aumakua are spiritual guides and ancestral guardians that protect their ohana (family). There are some debates on dolphins being mentioned in Hawaiian history as they are not named specifically in traditional stories, myths or legends. The word nai‘a Some historians believe they were mentioned but under another name mano (shark). There are many stories of sharks and when thoroughly examined the description of the “shark” and it’s behavior implies that of a dolphin. One such example is the story of Mangaia and the goddess ‘Ina. Some have conclud- ed that the Hawaiian term mano was used interchangeably with sharks and dolphins in stories told.\n\nStories that do mention nai’a like No ka Lawai’a a me kāna Wahine, talked about dolphins having special powers, granting wishes and almost being human-like.\n\nThere are at least 8 dolphin species found in Maui near Lanai, but the three most common we see are spinner dolphins, bottlenose dolphins and spotted dolphins.\n\nSpinner dolphins are the smallest of the three species weighing in at 4-7 ft in length and 50-170 lbs. Known for their aerial acrobatics, spinner dolphins can travel in pods up to 300 animals, making them a very playful and social species. Because spinner dolphins are nocturnal feeders, recent legislation has come into law protecting them from human encounters, like swimming with dolphins, that may disrupt their sleeping, eating and reproduction. As the dolphin pod moves during the day, they are prac- ticing resting behaviors which is called “milling”. During their resting period, which can be approximately 4-5 hours from sunrise to late afternoon, spinner dolphins will rest half of their brain, while the other half remains active to control breathing and possibly monitor for predators. This is the time of day when mom and calf dolphins interact the most as well and seeing baby spinner dolphins will definitely melt your heart.\n\nBottlenose dolphins are the species you may be familiar with in film or television. Bottlenose dolphins are found all over the world in every tropical and temperate ocean, the only place you won’t find them are the Artic and Antartic Oceans. It’s estimat- ed a few thousand have made Hawaii their home, permanently residing in pods of two-fifteen animals. Because their pods are smaller, it is often harder to spot bottlenose dolphins compared with their sister species the spinner dolphins. Spinners are some of the larger dolphin species growing to lengths of 6-15 feet and adults weighing up to 1400 lbs.\n\nPantropical spotted dolphins are, well you probably guessed, spotted! Their darker spots can be seen on the lighter underside of their belly, not showing until they are around the age of 5 years. This species’ coloring and size does vary depending on where it resides. Some species outside of Hawaii can have almost no spots even into adulthood. Unlike bottlenose who reside more in shallow water, pantropical spotted dolphins are found in both shallow and deep water. Most spotted dolphins travel in pods averaging around 65 animals, but will sometimes travel alone or in mega pods up to 350 animals. Spinner dolphins aren’t the only species that jump, all dolphins can, and spotted dolphins can jump up to 15 feet out of the water.\n\nEach dolphin is given a unique name (specific sound) by it’s pod.\n\nDolphins communicate using sounds that are whistles and high pitch squeaking.\n\nDolphins are mammals and give birth to their live young in the water and nurse them.\n\nLike all toothed whales, bottlenose dolphins are predatory animals and feed on crabs, fish, octopus and other marine animals.\n\nWhen not resting, dolphins are some of the fastest swimming marine mammals, sprinting up to 22 mph.\n\nDolphins can give birth to one young every year typically in spring or fall after reachign sexual maturity around the age of 7 years old. The average lifespan is around 20 years, but dolphins have been know to live up to 50 years."
