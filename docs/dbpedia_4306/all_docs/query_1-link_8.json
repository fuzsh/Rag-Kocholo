        "text": "In the year 2005, the Coca-Cola company sought to capitalize on the rapidly growing energy drink market with the introduction of a new citrus-flavored soda they called Vault.\n\nMarketed as a \"hybrid energy soda\", Vault represented Coca-Cola's attempt to compete with brands like Red Bull and Monster, which had seen tremendous success marketing high-caffeine beverages to young adult consumers.\n\nRather than directly emulate the extreme caffeine levels and in-your-face branding of market leading energy drinks, Coca-Cola took a different approach with Vault, infusing it with just 70 mg of caffeine per servingâapproximately half that of a can of Red Bull.\n\nCoca-Cola hoped this moderate level of stimulation would appeal to a broader consumer base looking for a pick-me-up beverage.\n\nThrough Vault, the Coca-Cola company sought to bring energy to the masses, moving the category beyond just hardcore gym rats and gamers.\n\nAs subsequent events would show, Vault was discontinued and would not become the revolutionary hybrid sensation Coca-Cola envisioned.\n\nâ\n\nVAULT NEVER MANAGED TO GAIN A STRONG MARKET FOOTHOLD\n\nâ\n\nDespite Coca-Cola's ambitious vision and heavy investment in promoting Vault as the next big thing in beverages, the soda unfortunately never seemed to resonate with consumers during its short six year lifespan.\n\nThe company spared no expense marketing Vault, running flashy TV commercials and web advertisements targeting youth culture.\n\nThey sponsored action sports events and concerts to generate buzz.\n\nFor a time in the late 2000s, the vibrant green Vault logo was omnipresent, appearing everywhere from billboards to vending machines in an attempt to drive brand recognition.\n\nYet according to sales data, the extensive promotional campaigns failed to translate into sustained revenue growth for Vault.\n\nAfter a brief honeymoon period following its 2005 launch, Vault's national distribution and sales volumes stagnated.\n\nUnlike successful energy drink brands before it, Vault struggled to build a loyal following or stand out in an increasingly cluttered beverage landscape.\n\nCoca-Cola did see some strong regional demand in select southern states like Alabama and Tennessee where Vault continued selling well throughout its lifespan.\n\nHowever, sales in the broader nationwide market remained lackluster.\n\nâ\n\nTHE ODD NEON GREEN COLOR OF VAULT TURNED SOME PEOPLE OFF\n\nâ\n\nThe unique, artificial neon green coloring chosen for Vault was central to its energetic branding, but some have speculated this design decision may have inadvertently turned consumers off, dooming the soda to mediocrity.\n\nUnlike the caramel-hued colas and crisp clear citrus sodas drinkers were accustomed to, Vault's fluorescent green fluid appeared radioactive, conjuring associations with toxic waste rather than refreshment.\n\nSome industry insiders rumored that the alien hue subconsciously repelled people, making them suspicious of what was in the can.\n\nWhile Coca-Cola's extensive product testing likely identified the neon green color as alluring for the young demographics it targeted, for many mainstream consumers it may have crossed a threshold from bold to unnatural.\n\nIts alarming glow under fluorescent lighting supposedly led some to decry Vault as a \"frankendrink\" better suited for mad scientists than public consumption.\n\nWith the natural and organic food movement gaining steam in the 2000s, Vault's artificial look in hindsight seemed out of step with the shifting culture.\n\nThough never substantiated, the suspicions that Vault's otherworldly coloration turned people away from the brand at first sight persist.\n\nâ\n\nCOCA-COLA MAY HAVE PURPOSEFULLY DESIGNED VAULT TO FAIL\n\nâ\n\nIn the aftermath of Vault's rapid demise, some cynical industry observers began floating an intriguing conspiracy theoryâthat Coca-Cola had sabotaged Vault on purpose as sacrificial lamb to clear room in the marketplace for their Full Throttle energy brand.\n\nThe theory suggests Coca-Cola wanted Vault gone so Full Throttle wouldn't have in-house competition and could dominate the energy drink niche.\n\nHowever, there is little hard evidence to support such a claim. While enticing, the idea of a deliberate covert sabotage by Coca-Cola is largely speculative.\n\nVault and Full Throttle did debut successively in 2005 and 2004, positioning them as siblings in Coca-Cola's beverage family.\n\nWhen Vault sales languished, it meant less internal rival for Full Throttle. But concrete proof indicating Vault was designed as a disposable, short-term placeholder is lacking.\n\nIn truth, as a major new product launch, Vault's failure was likely a genuine disappointment for Coca-Cola.\n\nThe lower than expected returns on their large promotional investments into Vault do not suggest an intentional ploy.\n\nDiverting resources into a new brand just to undermine it would have represented an incredibly high-risk gambit for Coca-Cola's management.\n\nWhile the Coca-Cola Company certainly benefited from Vault's exit clearing the lane for Full Throttle, all signs point to them making a good faith effort to make Vault a success in its own right, rather than a kamikaze mission.\n\nâ\n\nSEVERAL OF VAULT'S INGREDIENTS FACED REGULATORY PRESSURE\n\nâ\n\nIn the mid to late 2000s, scrutiny was increasing on energy drinks and supplements containing herbal stimulants like ginseng and guarana.\n\nSome feared their growing use among youth could pose health risks.\n\nWhile no direct evidence linked these ingredients to adverse effects, calls for greater regulation put pressure on products like Vault.\n\nGinseng, a staple of energy drinks, was under review by the FDA for potential drug interactions and side effects.\n\nMeanwhile, the FDA imposed restrictions on levels of guarana, a natural source of caffeine, after concerns about risks for children.\n\nWith alarm spreading among consumer advocacy groups about unintended effects these trendy drink additives could have, especially on still-developing young bodies, their unregulated ubiquity became precarious.\n\nSome speculated Coca-Cola grew wary of potential regulatory action targeting Vault's formula.\n\nRather than reformulate or draw negative scrutiny, Coca-Cola may have seen ditching Vault, whose revenues were already underwhelming, as the prudent choice.\n\nLetting the brand fade quietly could avoid both public controversy and the expense of altering recipes to appease regulators.\n\nWith its core colas unaffected, Coca-Cola could afford to sacrifice Vault.\n\nâ\n\nSOME ADVERTISING FOR VAULT USED PROVOCATIVE IMAGES\n\nâ\n\nIn an effort to make Vault appeal to young male demographics, some of the brandâs advertising campaigns took on a provocative tone, using imagery and messaging with strong sexual overtones evocative of the âBanned in the U.S.A.â beverage marketing trends of the early 2000s.\n\nHowever, these titillating ads likely only served to undermine Vaultâs mainstream potential.\n\nOne notorious Vault commercial featured buxom, scantily clad twins seductively dancing and splashing in a kiddie pool filled with Vault soda.\n\nPrint ads often centered double entendres with taglines like âGet your mind out of the gutterâ and âVault satisfiesâ.\n\nThis overt pandering to adolescent male fantasies led to backlash, with conservative watchdog groups threatening boycotts over the âsoftcore pornâ marketing.\n\nVaultâs recurring strategy of mixing sex and soda in advertising tried taking the provocative ethos that boosted energy drink culture mainstream.\n\nBut for many consumers, it crossed a line from edgy to offensive, aimlessly copying crude shock tactics better suited to far more niche beverages.\n\nThe hyper-masculine sexualization entwined with Vaultâs branding likely hampered its ability to be taken seriously as an everyday soda.\n\nBeyond just moral outrage, Vaultâs excessive horny-teenager pandering in marketing painted the soda as a novelty indulgence rather than functional thirst quencher, pigeonholing sales.\n\nâ\n\nIN 2011, COCA-COLA DISCONTINUED VAULT\n\nâ\n\nAfter nearly six years of lackluster sales and fading consumer interest, the Coca-Cola Company finally threw in the towel on its struggling Vault brand in 2011, discontinuing bottled distribution across most of the United States.\n\nIt was an acknowledgment that the hybrid energy soda had failed to take off as hoped, neither achieving the buzzworthy cult status of alternative sodas like Mountain Dew, nor the blockbuster sales of Coke's signature colas.\n\nYet, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Vault managed to live on in limited fashion even after its apparent demise.\n\nDespite ceasing production of pre-bottled Vault, parent company Coca-Cola allowed some third party distributors and restaurant chains to continue offering it as a fountain beverage for a few more years.\n\nThese holdouts kept the embers of Vault burning within select regional markets, mainly concentrated in the Southeast where it had found its most fervent fanbase.\n\nHardee's fast food franchises in particular continued serving Vault from their soda fountains into the 2010s, giving diehard brand devotees access to their beloved neon nectar.\n\nFor a brief time, one could still walk into a handful of restaurants in Alabama or Tennessee and order a Vault like it was 2008.\n\nBut make no mistakeâthese scattered fountain holdouts were last gasps.\n\nâ\n\nIN 2019, COCA-COLA RERELEASED VAULT FOR A LIMITED TIME\n\nâ\n\nAfter nearly a decade absence from shelves, the Vault brand improbably returned for one last encore run in 2019, resurrected by Coca-Cola for a fleeting promotional tie-in with the post-apocalyptic video game Fallout 76.\n\nSeeking to capitalize on nostalgic millennial fondness for Vault, Coca-Cola brought it back in special Fallout 76-branded packaging, playing into the game's retro nuclear era aesthetics.\n\nVault's glowing neon fluid and gritty punk sensibilities aligned with the Fallout universe.\n\nThe soda essentially served as in-game product placement, available as an in-fiction item that video game characters could drink to gain health.\n\nA few limited production runs of real life Vault were produced to generate buzz, sold in bottle caps mimicking the game's currency.\n\nBut this attempt to cash in on nerdy nostalgia proved short lived.\n\nJust months after release, the promotional Vault was discontinued again, the brand returning back to its grave once its fleeting marketing synergy with Fallout 76 was over.\n\nNonetheless, the brief Fallout 76 relaunch demonstrated Vault still possessed dormant cultural cachet nearly a decade after its initial demise. Had the odd reunion proved more popular, perhaps Vault could have been fully exhumed.\n\nAlas, the second discontinuation only reaffirmed Vault as a novelty of the past, rather than soda of the future."
