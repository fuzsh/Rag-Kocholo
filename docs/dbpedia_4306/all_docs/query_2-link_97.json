        "text": "greenvalve, you don't need any impedence matching transformers for the sound pads.\n\nThe links you have provided are correct. The Dayton soundpads are basically the same as the Sonic Impact ones but cheaper(?).The Gatorfoam I used was the 5mm thick black with black core.\n\nThe piezo transformer is only for use of a piezo as a DML transducer. But, it will need a woofer to fill in the lower frequencies - the sound pads are full range.\n\nEd, the panels present a calculated 6 ohm load to the amplifier. This seems to make a big difference with the Pioneer (I had to change the speaker impedence setting from 8 ohms to 6 ohms due to the PTC resistors on the exciters kicking in at higher levels at the 8 ohm setting only\n\nI would say that with 6 exciters wired for 6 ohms impedence roughly, an amplifier power of around 10 watts minimum is required. As the 845 was only 4 watts, I would estimate that at 2 watts the panels revealed the amp's weakness without mercy.\n\nThe panels are indeed fussy beasts. They will reveal low power valves in an instant. If you like your music played at soft levels with an active preamplifier, you'll be o.k.\n\nHowever, if you're in the mood to blast the paint off your walls, higher power, most likely in the form of solid state is the way to go. High powered valve amps will of course do as well but to me it seems like S.S. is a better partner in this revealing set up?It's just my opinion and observations though......don't take this as gospel\n\nAnother thing my ''Ziggyplanars'' love 16 guage vintage magnet wire as speaker cables. When I say vintage, I mean 40 years old with a coating that is orange and WILL NOT BURN with a naked flame what the hell would that coating be? You can only scrape it off with a scalpel!\n\nAnyway, it sounds FANTASTIC!!....best cable ever....and I have a few expensive ones.\n\nEd, I gather you don't take my sound evaluation on the Pioneer receiver seriously ?\n\nCan't say I blame you - I would have laughed at the thought also until It started breaking in and revealing it's strengths\n\nI wonder how a Gainclone will sound with the panels? I have all the stuff to knock up a quick working clone - might give it a go?"
