        "text": "I couldn't find the digital thermometer last night and he was vomiting, so I gave him the only one I could find... the old-school glass one. Said to be really careful...\n\nHe broke it this afternoon over his bed. He said a silvery liquid poured out. That's the story but I didn't see the broken end or little beads of mercury (the comforter is star wars and has a really busy grey print) I gingerly gathered the bedding into a contractor bag and put it outside. He showered and put his clothes in a bag. I wasn't aware that I'm not supposed to walk around the house after being in there and it took a while for me to figure out that the air purifier should be shut off in his room.\n\nThe company that made the thermometer has been useless in figuring out whether it has mercury. There are some numbers on the thermometer and an outdated logo, and I'm fairly certain it was bought in Illinois in 2004 or later. I thought that would be plenty of information for them to tell me something concrete, but no. They direct me to the EPA fact sheet, which directs me to poison control, which directs me to some other state agency closed until tomorrow...\n\nI have a 4 mo old and a 2 yo, so it is concerning that I don't know if it was mercury and that I didn't see the actual mercury (could it have rolled off the bed onto the carpet? Passed through to the mattress? Did I track it everywhere? What needs to be thrown away?)\n\nBalancing my worries are the memories of mercury thermometers from my childhood. There was probably a mercury thermometer in most households and they'd get broken all the time. I might have even broken one. I remember kids playing with little beads of mercury on their desks in elementary school.\n\nA kid I was babysitting when I was a teenager bit through a mercury thermometer and then spit the glass and mercury out onto the kitchen floor. It was a bear to try to clean up. It just rolled away no matter how I tried to gather it. It didn't help that I blurted out, \"THAT'S POISON!\" at the little girl. There was screaming and crying. Not my finest moment. (I was 15.)\n\nWe went to the neighbor's house who called poison control. They said she'd be fine if she spat it out. They didn't say we needed to do anything else. Nothing about airing things out or anything.\n\nI'd take a flashlight and search really hard for any mercury balls. You don't want the littles to swallow them.\n\nEdited December 28, 2016 by Garga\n\nMy college roommate bit through a mercury thermometer in 1989 and called me at my babysitting job in a panic. I called poison control, and while I don't remember the details, they were very reassuring.\n\nWhat I do remember, is that poison control called back a few hours later to ask how \"the girl who swallowed the mercury\" was doing. Needless to say, my boss (mother of 3 young girls) freaked out. I hadn't thought to tell her what had happened, because it hadn't involved her child. Luckily she reached me pretty quickly, but for a few moments there I thought I was going to be unemployed.\n\nI would call poison control. I have had very good experiences every time I've called poison control. They are very good at putting people's minds at ease. I remember once calling them because the liquid in my son's g-tube turned neon green, and I was convinced he had found antifreeze or something. The woman almost immediately said \"Any chance he's been sucking on a black washable marker? The colors in those break down, except for the green . . . \" and sure enough, that was what had happened.\n\nthere is mercury in most high fructose corn syrup. comes from caustic soda. (i had to look it up. but dudelings mercury test was pretty definitive. he was drinking pop when they did the blood draw.)\n\ntuna fish has mercury.\n\nat this point, you can calm down.\n\nour bodies can detox mercury as long as it isn't getting a new supply.\n\nwhen he did that blood draw - his mercury level was the same as if he'd ingested the entire mercury thermometer himself. and it hadn't gone anywhere else. his provider was freaking out when she saw his results.\n\nwe did do three months of gluathione injections (he was probably fine with two.) glutathione is a strong antioxidant that is naturally occurring. some people dont' produce enough (like my family.) you can buy glutathione capsules otc - but they are not very effective at getting into the cell.\n\nthe next test - he'd had nothing with hfcs, no tuna - and his mercury level was 0.\n\nAs a child back in the early 60's, I played with mercury and so did my friends. We broke open thermometers and played with the fun little silvery balls. We brought them to school and shared with our friends. We experimented with them. Eventually the little blobs got smaller and smaller until the stuff was gone. This was not a one-time event.\n\nOur friends whose parents were dentists brought amalgam to play with. We hammered it and make tiny \"sculptures.\" Recently I found a blob of this in a memory box from my childhood.\n\nSo...my take on this is to be sure there are no tiny rogue mercury balls in the bedding or on the floor. wash everything and check for obvious bits, and then move on. Like is interesting."
