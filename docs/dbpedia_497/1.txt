Speedy West, whose innovative steel-guitar licks made him one of the best players on the instrument, died Nov. 15. He was 79.

Born Wesley Webb West in Springfield, Mo., he moved to the West Coast after World War II. He eventually landed a job with the popular western-swing band of an Oklahoma expatriate, Spade Cooley.

Taking a cue from the recording star Alvino Rey, who introduced the pedal-steel guitar to pop audiences, Mr. West had a custom instrument that featured three necks and four pedals. He became the first country-music steel-guitarist to use pedals.

He was Capitol Records' first-call steel player from 1950 through 1956.

''During that time, I played on more than 6,000 records for 177 different artists, both pop and country -- Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, the big bands of Nelson Riddle and Billy May, Jim Reeves,'' he said in an interview.
