        "text": "The last time a military junta seized power in Mali, in the spring of 2012, it lasted barely three weeks: International pressure, first from West African neighbors and then from the wider world, persuaded the coup’s leaders to return power to a civilian administration. But even in that short time, Tuareg rebels in the north capitalized on the political chaos in Bamako by grabbing large swaths of territory, effectively splitting the country in two.\n\nThe north became a haven for terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda’s North African franchise. It would take a French military intervention, followed by a larger United Nations force, to push back the Tuareg rebels and their Islamist fellow travelers. Eight years on, that task is far from complete."
