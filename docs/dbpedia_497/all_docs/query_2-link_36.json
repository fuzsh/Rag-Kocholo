What might be interesting to some of you younger guys who play the guitar is that Jimmy Bryant played the first Telecaster ever made when Leo Fender brought it to a club he was at in California. He sat on the edge of the stage and played it for two hours. (Jimmy was just there to hang out, not to play. The band that played that night quit playing and sat with the rest of the audience to here Jimmy play this new weird looking guitar). There are a couple of other firsts as well. I think he may have been the first to appear on TV with a Telecaster. John says his dad was in 12 movies with Roy Rogers and in one of them from 1951 you can see Jimmy holding a Tele. I also think he may have been the first to record with one. A new boxed set just came out called, \"Frettin' Fingers - The Lightning Guitar of Jimmy Bryant\" that contains 75 songs he recorded from the 50's and 60's, and two of these songs were made in September of 1950 and featured Jimmy with his Telecaster. Truth be known, it was likely a Broadcaster. At any rate Jimmy liked the two pickups Leo was trying out better than the one pickup version Esquire and that's how the Tele came about for the most part. I'm going to post a couple of short 1-minute excerpts from some of his tunes here. Also, Jimmy's son, John, is making a documentary of his dad. He sent me a small postage stamp sized video of Jimmy and Speedy playing together on Hometown Jamboree in the early 50's, (Jimmy quit the show in 1955). I'll post that as well.\n\nJimmy playing the first tune he ever wrote--Bryant's Boogie/September-1950\n\nJimmy and Speedy playing Cotton Pickin' /1954\n\nJimmy also brought into the studio another first, the prototype of the Stratosphere Twin Guitar. It had a six string neck tuned regular and a twelve string neck that had the string pairs tuned in thirds allowing you to play harmonies with yourself. It never caught on but Jimmy starting making his reputation as the fastest, cleanest guitarist ever during this time. Barney Kessel once said, \"Of all the guitar players I have known, Jimmy Bryant is the fastest and the cleanest, and has more technique than any other.\" In 1967 Jimmy recorded his last record for Imperial called, \"The Fastest Guitar in the Country\". And it was no hype, he probably was.\n\nJimmy playing his first recording with the new double-neck, Stratosphere Boogie/1954\n\nAnother Stratosphere recording, Frettin' Fingers/1955\n\nAnd the first take from the session of the same song as above, this time played on standard guitar, and notice how totally different the opening is. Bryant and West improvised a huge amount of what they did both live and in the studio. Frettin' Fingers-First Take/1955\n\nJimmy playing what he \"really\" liked to play, namely, bop. This tune came out in 1967 and features Barney Kessel on backup guitar along with Shelly Manne on drums. Itâ€™s a crying shame the record companies kept pushing him into some of the insipid commercial crud that they did. This is truly what he did best. By the 60's he was endorsing and playing all kinds of guitars after parting with Fender. There's no telling what he played on this tune. But no, its obviously not a Vox (although he did play them for a time). Voxwagon/1967\n\nLastly, this is the video John sent me. He managed to get the rights to a lot of the Hometown Jamboree stuff featuring his dad so he could show it in his documentary. Its the same tune as the song I posted above called, \"Cotton Pickin'\", but this TV show (Hometown Jamboree) is an earlier version of the song, probably from around 1952 or 53. Back then they called it, Flyin' High. (mpeg format)\n\nJohn also says he has some never before seen footage of his dad playing both the first prototypes for the Stratocaster and the Tele that will be shown in his documentary, which right now looks to be a DVD only release. I can't wait to see that.\n\nHope this was fun for somebody else besides me.\n\npost edited by Joe Bravo -\n\n6 Replies\n\nkennywtelejazz\n\nMax Output Level: -3.5 dBFS\n\nTotal Posts : 7151\n\nJoined:\n\nLocation: The Planet Tele..X..\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRE: Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant (permalink)\n\nHey Joe B...,\n\nExellent Man, ......\n\nI heard of Jimmy Bryant when I was younger, then later on from Guitar Player Mag in articles.\n\nThat Cat had Fire in his playing....\n\nThanks for the History lesson, didn't know that He was the first to play A Tele, ( my Fav git since 68)\n\nYou can realy hear the fun they are having playing.\n\nI enjoyed this very much, hmmmmm I'm tempted to write and play something along these lines.\n\nWhat about Hank Garland ? you dig him?\n\nKenny\n\nOh Yeah , Life is Good .\n\nThe internet is nothing more than a glorified real time cartoon we all star in.\n\nI play a \"Gibson \" R 8 Les Paul Cherry Sunburst .\n\nThe Love of my Life is an American Bulldog Named Duke .

I'm making a Jimmy Bryant web page with more samples on it. I think the Texas Swing stuff Bryant and West did together is what people like the best (I know I do) so I'm mostly focusing on that. Here's some more excerpts from them together in the 1950's. You know, everybody talks about Bob Wills when it comes to Texas Swing but I personally always thought that Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant were the top of the heap, and what they did really set the foundation for rockabilly and rock n roll.\n\nBryant's Bouce\n\nCountry Capers\n\nLow Man On a Totem Pole\n\nSerenade to a Frog\n\nSleepwalker's Lullaby\n\nTwo of a Kind\n\nRailRoadin'\n\nKenny, I liked Garland too, Jazz Winds From New Directions was great but I think the stuff he played as a sideman for other people was better myself. I love Byrdland Guitars too (he helped develop them) but could never afford one. Roy Buchanan was my other favorite Tele player.\n\nPS, that's also Bryant playing fiddle on Two of a Kind. He was maybe even a better fiddle player than a guitar player.\n\nAnd if anybody's interested, they used to record Bryant and West in the studio by placing their amps at right angles to each other and sticking one mic between them. (I guess maybe it as an omni).\n\npost edited by Joe Bravo -\n\nkennywtelejazz\n\nMax Output Level: -3.5 dBFS\n\nTotal Posts : 7151\n\nJoined:\n\nLocation: The Planet Tele..X..\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRE: Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant (permalink)\n\nJoe ,\n\nThanks for posting some of Jimmys song clips here.\n\nI'm enjoying the great playing , and I'm glad to have a chance to draw some inspiritation from this music.\n\nYeah , The whole genre of Texas Swing and Rockabilly got some big roots, I can see how this set a ball in motion.\n\nSome of the working players that play in those styles got chops with deep pockets.\n\nI found this out , one day in the late 70's while I was working at Sam Ash on 48th st.\n\nA guy walked into the store with a BIG Guitar case and a black cowboy hat on.\n\nI hit it off with Craig ( his name) and asked him what he had in the case, and if I remeber correctly it was a 30's or 40's L5 acoustic with a pickup.\n\nAt the time I had an 1936 Epiphone Deluxe non cutaway with a custom D Angelico ebony fingerboard, ( that got a tip of the hat nod from Craig)\n\nI played him a version of Here's That Rainy Day that I had been working on , and to make a long story short , Craig played me some jazz guitar and asked me if I had a union card.\n\nI didn't at the time so he told me to get one which I did .\n\nHis band was called Craig Chambers And The Rio Grand Band and he gave me a gig in the original broadway show The Best Little Whore House In Texas as a sub .\n\nCraig's band was the same band that played the show.\n\nNever got to play the show but I met some real tallented people who could play the sh** out of jazz with or with out wearing a cowboy hat. lol\n\nAs far as Roy Buchanan go's I got into to him around the time his second album came out.\n\nRoy remained one of my favorites for many years, even after his passing.\n\nI used to go out to hear him all the time.\n\nOne time I snuck into one of his shows at Town Hall N.Y.C, and made it to the backstage area .\n\nBack then I used to look for the truck with the gear and help the roadies bring in the equipment. lol\n\nWhen Roy came out to play I trembled as I said Hi to him , and sat right on the stage right next to the monitors and watched him play the show.lol\n\nThat night Larry Corryell was also on the bill .lol\n\nPlaying guitar is a fun path , never know when a few good experiences are gonna happen. Hope a few more are on the way.\n\nKenny\n\nOh Yeah , Life is Good .\n\nThe internet is nothing more than a glorified real time cartoon we all star in.\n\nI play a \"Gibson \" R 8 Les Paul Cherry Sunburst .\n\nThe Love of my Life is an American Bulldog Named Duke . I'm currently running Cakewalk By BandLab as my DAW .\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/guitarist-kenny-wilson\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Kennywtelejazz/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=1\n\nhttp://www.soundclick.com/bands/pagemusic.cfm?bandID=427899\n\nJoe Bravo\n\nMax Output Level: -56.5 dBFS\n\nTotal Posts : 1870\n\nJoined:\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRE: Speedy West and Jimmy Bryant (permalink)\n\nNice story. I wish Buchanan would have toured more so I could have seen him. I loved his first two records and the live one. I get chills just thinking about \"I'm Evil\". I suppose Danny Gatton and Bugs Henderson have come close to him over the years, but it still ain't the same. I can't imagine why any promoter would book him and Larry Coryell on the same play bill. Talk about two different guys.\n\nI was never a big country music fan. I just enjoy anyone that can really pick though. Texas Swing and some Mountain Music (Doc Watson, Tony Rice, et al) is as close as I come. I've got a song called \"The Devil's Elixirs\" that's up for best instrumental award at Winfield this year and if it wins then I'm heading out there in September for the Grand National Competitions (flatpick and fingerpick mandolin etc.). I'll probably miss out on the guitar competitions though because I think I'll be playing on the Saturday after those events, which is a drag because some of the best players in the world show up for them. They had a guy from New Zealand a couple of years ago who was quite good. But I really love good acoustic guitar music more than anything else. But I like anything done well. One day I'll listen to Manuel Barrueco, the next Holdsworth, then Metheny or Dan Crary, Phil Keaggy or even some symphony music."
