        "text": "American basketball coach (born 1942)\n\nWilliam \"Speedy\" Morris (born April 26, 1942) is an American basketball coach.\n\nBorn in Manayunk, Morris acquired the nickname \"Speedy\" because he was one of the slowest kids in his neighborhood. Morris started coaching at St. John the Baptist Catholic School's CYO varsity basketball team. He then went on to coach at Roman Catholic High School.[1] Morris was then asked to be head coach of La Salle University's women's basketball team. He was head coach of the La Salle University men's team from 1986 to 2001, where he led the Explorers to four NCAA tournament appearances.\n\nMorris's 238 wins are the most in school history. His best team was the 1989–90, led by Lionel Simmons and Doug Overton, which posted a 30–2 record and finished 12th in both major polls.\n\nMorris was the first Division I coach to coach both the men's and women's program at the same school. While at La Salle, Morris coached future NBA players Simmons, Overton, Randy Woods, Tim Legler, and Rasual Butler. However, he was forced to resign in 2001 after eight straight losing seasons.\n\nSoon afterward, Morris was hired at St. Joseph's Preparatory School in Philadelphia. The teams won Catholic League titles in 2002 and 2003. On February 7, 2011, he earned his 561st win in the Philadelphia Catholic League, the most of any coach in league history. On February 3, 2012, Morris earned his 900th win as Prep defeated Roman Catholic, a team he once coached. Morris is the first and only coach in Pennsylvania state history to win 300 games with two schools. He won his 1000th game on January 12, 2018. In December 2019, Morris announced that he would retire at the end of the season.[1] He wanted to continue coaching, but his battle with Parkinson's disease had taken its toll on him.[2]\n\nHead coaching record\n\n[edit]\n\nCollege men's\n\n[edit]\n\nStatistics overview Season Team Overall Conference Standing Postseason La Salle Explorers (Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference) (1986–1992) 1986–87 La Salle 20–13 10–4 2nd NIT Runner-up 1987–88 La Salle 24–10 14–0 1st NCAA Division I first round 1988–89 La Salle 26–6 13–1 1st NCAA Division I first round 1989–90 La Salle 30–2 16–0 1st (South) NCAA Division I second round 1990–91 La Salle 19–10 12–4 2nd NIT first round 1991–92 La Salle 20–11 12–4 2nd NCAA Division I first round La Salle Explorers (Midwestern Collegiate Conference) (1992–1995) 1992–93 La Salle 14–13 9–5 3rd 1993–94 La Salle 11–16 4–6 5th 1994–95 La Salle 13–14 7–7 6th La Salle Explorers (Atlantic 10 Conference) (1995–2001) 1995–96 La Salle 6–24 3–13 T–5th (West) 1996–97 La Salle 10–17 5–11 T–5th (West) 1997–98 La Salle 9–18 5–11 T–4th (West) 1998–99 La Salle 13–15 8–8 3rd (West) 1999–00 La Salle 11–17 5–11 5th (West) 2000–01 La Salle 12–17 5–11 8th La Salle: 238–203 128–96 Total: 238–203\n\nNational champion Postseason invitational champion\n\nConference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion\n\nDivision regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion\n\nConference tournament champion"
