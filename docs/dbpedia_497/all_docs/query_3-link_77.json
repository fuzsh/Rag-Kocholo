        "text": "1961 popular music song\n\nThis article is about the song. For the cartoon character, see Speedy Gonzales. For other uses, see Speedy Gonzales (disambiguation).\n\n\"Speedy Gonzales\"Single by David DanteB-side\"K-K-K-Katy\"ReleasedApril 1961Recorded1961GenrePopLength2:28LabelRCA VictorSongwriter(s)Buddy Kaye, Ethel Lee, David HillProducer(s)Hugo & Luigi\n\n\"Speedy Gonzales\" is a 1961 song by David Hess (RCA 8056),[1] who recorded it under the name David Dante, about Speedy Gonzales, \"the fastest mouse in all Mexico\". It was written by Buddy Kaye, Ethel Lee and Dante/Hess. The David Dante original version briefly entered the U.S. Music Vendor chart in April 1961.\n\nPat Boone version\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Speedy Gonzales\"Single by Pat Boonefrom the album Pat Boone's Golden Hits Featuring Speedy Gonzales B-side\"The Locket\"ReleasedMay 19, 1962Recorded1962GenrePopLength2:30LabelDotSongwriter(s)Buddy Kaye, Ethel Lee, David HillProducer(s)Randy Wood\n\nThe song was popularized in the United States as a 1962 single by Pat Boone.[2] The Boone version peaked at the No. 6 Billboard Hot 100 position in 1962 during a total chart run of 13 weeks, doing better in many national charts in Europe, where it sold a million copies.[3] The female voice (\"La-la-la...\") on this song was of Robin Ward.[3] It also incorporated Mel Blanc voicing Speedy Gonzales as he did in the Warner Brothers cartoons.\n\nDante's version details a demand from a girl named Consuela to Speedy to stop roving about and take care of his neglected household. Boone's song adds a spoken introduction stating that he was wandering between some old adobe haciendas on a moonlit night in Mexico, where he heard the voice of a Mexican girl calling to Speedy, and Mel Blanc's inserts replace a recurring line from Dante's lyrics.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures sued Boone and Dot Records for $850,000 over Blanc's performance of Speedy's voice on Boone's record without their authorization. The case was later dropped.\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nPat Boone version\n\nChart (1962) Peak\n\nposition Argentina[4] 1 Australia (Kent Music Report)[5] 3 Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)[6] 1 Belgium (Ultratop 50 Wallonia)[7] 7 France (IFOP)[8] 8 Ireland (Evening Herald)[9] 4 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)[10] 1 Norway (VG-lista)[11] 1 Sweden (Kvällstoppen)[12] 1 Sweden (Tio i Topp)[13] 1 UK Singles (OCC)[14] 2 US Billboard Hot 100[15] 6 West Germany (Official German Charts)[16] 1\n\nKumbia All Starz version\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Speedy Gonzales\"Single by A.B.
