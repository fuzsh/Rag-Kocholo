        "text": "On this week's All Songs Considered, I'm joined by NPR Music's Marissa Lorusso and Hazel Cills to share some thrilling new music, beginning with Indigo De Souza's \"You Can Be Mean.\" The song's inspiration stems from a mean and harmful relationship and the acute realization of her need to protect her body and spirit. Indigo De Souza's next album, All of This Will End, is out on April 28.\n\nNext up is \"Cherie Vico,\" a charming, sweet song from Nashville-based musician Peter One. The 67-year-old singer from Côte d'Ivoire had a career in West Africa before moving to the United States, and now after 20 years of working in other fields – he's been a security guard, a teacher and most recently a nurse – he's finally releasing music again.\n\nAfter that, we hear new music from two beloved rock bands: Speedy Ortiz has released \"Scabs,\" its first new song in five years, which sounds like it may have been influenced by bandleader Sadie Dupuis' solo recordings. In a statement, Dupuis said the tart, wiry track was inspired by a desire for stronger political convictions in others. And next we hear Bully's Alicia Bognanno sing about the death of her dog and the unconditional love and support that her pet brought her. The song \"Days Move Slow\" is from Bully's fourth album Lucky for You, which is out June 2.\n\nWe end the show with a couple of new artists. Charlotte Cornfield's song \"Cut and Dry\" reflects on the idea of leaving things behind as part of moving on and the difficulty of severing ties with the past. And our final song comes from Laura Wolf, a classical musician also in love with sound manipulation. I'll play the creative-sounding tune \"Calligraphy and Calculations\" from her upcoming album Shelf Life.\n\nFeatured Artists And Songs:\n\n1. Indigo De Souza: \"You Can Be Mean,\" from All of This Will End\n\n2. Peter One: \"Cherie Vico,\" from Come Back to Me\n\n3. Speedy Ortiz: \"Scabs\" (Single)\n\n4. Bully: \"Days Move Slow,\" from Lucky For You\n\n5. Charlotte Cornfield: \"Cut and Dry,\" from Could Have Done Anything\n\n6. Laura Wolf: \"Calligraphy and Calculations,\" from Shelf Life"
