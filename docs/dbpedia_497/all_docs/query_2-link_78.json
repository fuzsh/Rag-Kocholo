        "text": "Hitchhiking the rest of the way after his car broke down, Gary West was destined for more frustration once he got to the hotel.\n\nThe showroom staff wouldn't let him in to see the band because of the holes in his jeans.\n\nThe Tulsa guitarist, who had traveled to Oklahoma City after hearing that keyboardist Steve Hardin was looking for a Tulsa guitar player for his band, could see and hear, however, from where he was standing - the band already had a guitarist.\n\nWest almost turned around and walked out.\n\nBut he didn't, and when the band came out for a break, he introduced himself, told them who he had played with in Tulsa and who his father was.\n\n\"They fired their guitarist that night, and I got the best job in town,\" West told the Tulsa World years later.\n\nWest, better known by his stage name, Speedy West Jr., was on his way to establishing himself on a much wider stage.\n\nThe son of late steel-guitar legend and Broken Arrow resident Speedy West, Gary West, who graduated from Webster High School, died Wednesday in Oklahoma City of complications from lung cancer. He was 58.\n\nA memorial service is set for 3 p.m. May 11 at St. Luke's United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City under the direction of Buchanan Funeral Service of Oklahoma City.\n\nIn the early 1990s, West, who grew up in Tulsa, started his own band, the Speedy West Jr. Band, and played local venues frequently.\n\nHis father, Speedy West, had been associated with a uniquely identifiable country sound, but Gary West went his own way musically, building a legacy grounded in rock and power blues.\n\nBorn in Hollywood, Calif., during his father's prolific days as a Capitol Records musician, West was 5 when he got his first guitar - a gift from legendary guitar innovator Leo Fender, a close friend of his father's.\n\nWeary of the showroom circuit, Speedy West later moved to the Tulsa area and became the manager of a Fender guitar warehouse.\n\nGary West learned the guitar and played with various Tulsa groups, including the Sweat Band, before moving on.\n\nAfter his introduction to Oklahoma City through Hardin, he later caught on with Maya, one of the city's top show bands.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHe played lead guitar with Maya from 1976 to 1992, when he left to start his own band. Later he played with Wild Oats and, more recently, with the house band at Friends Restaurant and Club in Oklahoma City.\n\nAlthough they differed in styles, Gary West, who also sang vocals, and his father had great respect for one another.\n\nThe elder West once offered his assessment of his son's skills:\n\n\"He's a real good player. He plays so clean,\" he told the Tulsa World. \"He plays too damn loud, like the rest of 'em, but he sure plays clean.\"\n\nSpeedy West died in 2003.\n\nTauni Oakley, Gary West's sister, remembers her brother jamming with his buddies in the garage of their Tulsa home.\n\n\"And if he wasn't playing music, he was working with his motorcycle,\" she said.\n\nGary West was diagnosed with lung cancer six months ago, family members said, but he continued playing throughout his treatments.\n\nMusician friends from far and wide came together in support, raising money to help him with his bills.\n\n\"The outpouring of sentiments and love was overwhelming,\" his wife, Kristen West, said. \"It encouraged Gary. Truly, in our 12 years together I'd never heard anyone say an unkind word about him.\"\n\nWest's survivors include his wife, Kristen West; a son, Andrew West; his mother, Opal Dunham; his stepmother, Mary West; and two sisters, Tauni Oakley and Dee Anna Snyder.\n\nTim Stanley 918-581-8385\n\ntim.stanley@tulsaworld.com SUBHEAD: Speedy West Jr. carried on his father's legacy in his own style.
