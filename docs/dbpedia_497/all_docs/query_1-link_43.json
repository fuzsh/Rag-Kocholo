        "text": "ADOPTED\n\nBY THE\n\nSUPREME COURT OF NEVADA\n\n____________\n\nEffective January 1, 1953\n\nand Including\n\nAmendments Through September 29, 2023\n\nPREFACE\n\n________\n\nThe 1951 legislature authorized the Nevada Supreme Court to Prescribe rules to regulate civil practice and procedure. Existing statutes were deemed rules of court, to remain in effect Until superseded. 1951 L., p. 44. [See NRS 2.120.]\n\nThe court appointed an Advisory Committee, consisting of the undersigned, to submit a draft of rules. A tentative draft, based primarily upon the federal rules, was prepared, and through the courtesy of West Publishing Company, was published and distributed to the Bar prior to the 1952 State Bar Meeting held at Las Vegas, March 27-29, 1952. At that meeting the rules were discussed and explained by Mr. Thompson of the Committee, and in federal application by the Honorable Leon R. Yankwich, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.\n\nBy order of April 1, 1952, the court invited submission to the committee of proposed modifications, such modifications to be submitted on or before June 4, 1952. Comments and proposals were submitted and discussed with their sponsors, and, in many instances, adopted. The Committees final recommendation was thereafter submitted to the court, discussed with the court in meeting, and adopted by the court.\n\nADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\nNEVADA, ON RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE\n\nJohn S. Belford Harold V. Harris\n\nRichard W. Blakey Royal A. Stewart\n\nWilliam J. Forman Lester D. Summerfield\n\nLeslie B. Gray Bruce R. Thompson\n\nPrince A. Hawkins, Chairman\n\nENABLING ACT\n\n[Chapter 40, Statutes of Nevada 1951; now NRS 2.120]\n\n________\n\nAN ACT relating to rules of civil practice and procedure, and authorizing the supreme court to prescribe such rules for all courts.\n\n(Approved February 28, 1951)\n\nThe People of the State of Nevada, represented in Senate and\n\nAssembly, do enact as follows:\n\nSection 1. The supreme court of Nevada, by rules adopted and published from time to time, shall regulate original and appellate civil practice and procedure, including, without limitation, pleadings, motions, writs, notices and forms of process, in judicial proceedings in all courts of the state, for the purpose of simplifying the same and of promoting the speedy determination of litigation upon its merits. Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right and shall not be inconsistent with the constitution of the State of Nevada.\n\nSection 2. All statutes regulating original or appellate civil practice or procedure, including, without limitation, pleadings, motions, writs, notices and forms of process, in effect or taking effect at the time this act takes effect, shall be deemed to be rules of court, and shall remain in effect, until modified or superseded by rules adopted and published pursuant to this act. Such rules shall take effect on such date as the supreme court shall specify, but not in any event until sixty days after adoption and publication.\n\nORDER ADOPTING RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE\n\n________\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to the foregoing enabling act and to the matters recited in the foregoing preface, that the annexed rules be and the same hereby are adopted for the regulation of original and appellate civil practice and procedure in judicial proceedings in the district courts of the State of Nevada, and the forms annexed thereto approved; that the same shall be effective on January 1, 1953; that publication thereof be made by the mailing of a printed copy by the clerk of this court to each member of the State Bar of Nevada according to the clerks official list of membership of such Bar (which will include all district judges and district attorneys), and that the certificate of the clerk of this court as to such mailing, not less than sixty days prior to January 1, 1953, shall be conclusive evidence of the adoption and publication of said rules in accordance with the provisions of said enabling act.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that copies be provided by the clerk of this court to each county clerk in the state and to the clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and to each member of the 1951 and 1953 legislatures and to the State Library and each county law library.\n\nDated: August 29, 1952.\n\nBY THE COURT\n\nMilton B. Badt\n\nChief Justice\n\nEdgar Eather\n\nCharles M. Merrill\n\nAssociate Justices\n\nFOREWORD\n\n________\n\nThe vesting of the rule-making power in the Supreme Court by the Forty-Fifth Legislature (1951) was well-advised and forward-looking legislation. It was supported by the entire Judiciary Committee of the assembly comprising Wm. G. Coulthard, J. F. McElroy, J. K. Houssels, Farrell L. Seevers, Harold Anderson, A. Primeaux, C. C. Boak, Frank E. Walters and Edward D. Carville, and by the entire Judiciary Committee of the senate comprising Fred C. Horlacher, John H. Murray, Forest B. Lovelock, John E. Robbins and B. Mahlon Brown. It provided the authority under which, by adoption of simplified rules of practice and procedure, the Supreme Court could greatly improve the administration of justice in the state. The adoption of the rules of civil procedure for the district courts, including appellate practice and procedure for review by this court, constitutes perhaps the states most important advancement of the administration of justice in civil cases. These rules were drafted by an Advisory Committee appointed by the court, after mature deliberation. Despite our roster of able and public spirited attorneys throughout the entire state, it became necessary to appoint a committee of attorneys all residing in the same city so as to permit weekly meetings of that committee and interim meetings of various subcommittees for initial consideration and reports of various parts of the rules.\n\nFor its diligent and untiring work in the preparation and presentation of both the tentative draft and the final draft of the rules of civil procedure, we accord to that committee the appreciation of this court, of the district courts and of the bar of the State of Nevada. That committee comprised Prince A. Hawkins, Chairman, John S. Belford, Richard W. Blakey, William J. Forman, Leslie B. Gray, Harold V. Harris, Royal A. Stewart, Lester D. Summerfield and Bruce R. Thompson, all of Reno.\n\nTo those attorneys and district judges throughout the state who, by personal conferences, telephone calls and correspondence with members of the committee and with members of the court, made valuable suggestions, many of which have been written into the final draft, the court likewise expresses its thanks and appreciation.\n\nOn behalf of the bench and bar of the state, the court also expresses its thanks to West Publishing Company for printing as a public service and without charge both the tentative draft and the final draft of the rules. Without such assistance, our lack of funds for the purpose would have made the task materially more difficult.\n\nThe general approval of the rules by the bar is gratifying. It is not thought that they are perfect. Amendment will not be difficult when necessity for such amendment appears clear.\n\nAugust 29, 1952.\n\nMilton B. Badt\n\nChief Justice\n\nEdgar Eather\n\nCharles M. Merrill\n\nAssociate Justices\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEVADA\n\nIn the Matter of a Study Committee to Review the NEVADA RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.\n\nADKT 276\n\nORDER AMENDING THE NEVADA RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE\n\nWhereas, in July 1999, this court appointed an Advisory Committee to study the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure and to propose amendments or revision; and\n\nWhereas, on March 19, 2003, the Committee submitted to this court a report of its activities and recommended specific amendments to the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure; and\n\nWhereas, this court solicited and considered public comment on the recommended amendments; and\n\nWhereas, this court has concluded that amendment of the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure is warranted, accordingly,\n\nIt Is Hereby Ordered:\n\n1. That the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure shall be amended and shall read as set forth in Exhibit A.\n\n2. That the Introductory Statement and Forms 3, 19 and 31 of Appendix of Forms to the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure shall be amended and shall read as set forth in Exhibit B.\n\n3. That a new Form 33 for Consent to Service by Electronic Means Under Rule 5 shall be added to the Appendix of Forms and shall read as set forth in Exhibit B.\n\n4. That these rule amendments shall become effective January 1, 2005, and shall govern all proceedings brought after that date and all further proceedings in actions pending on that date, unless in the opinion of the district court their application in a particular pending action would not be feasible or would work an injustice, in which event the former procedure applies.\n\n5. That the clerk of this court shall cause a notice of entry of this order to be published in the official publication of the State Bar of Nevada. Publication of this order shall be accomplished by the clerk disseminating copies of this order to all subscribers of the advance sheets of the Nevada Reports and all persons and agencies listed in NRS 2.345, and to the executive director of the State Bar of Nevada. The certificate of the clerk of this court as to the accomplishment of the above-described publication of notice of entry and dissemination of this order shall be conclusive evidence of the adoption and publication of the foregoing rule amendments.\n\nDated this 26th day of July, 2004.\n\nBY THE COURT\n\nMiriam Shearing, Chief Justice\n\nDeborah A. Agosti Robert E. Rose\n\nAssociate Justice Associate Justice\n\nNancy A. Becker A. William Maupin\n\nAssociate Justice Associate Justice\n\nMark Gibbons Michael L. Douglas\n\nAssociate Justice Associate Justice\n\nRULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE FOR THE NEVADA DISTRICT COURTS\n\nI. SCOPE OF RULES; FORM OF ACTION\n\nRule 1. Scope and Purpose\n\nThese rules govern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the district courts, except as stated in Rule 81. They should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 2. One Form of Action\n\nThere is one form of action—the civil action.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nII. COMMENCING AN ACTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS, PLEADINGS, MOTIONS, AND ORDERS\n\nRule 3. Commencing an Action\n\nA civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 4. Summons and Service\n\n(a) Summons.\n\n(1) Contents. A summons must:\n\n(A) name the court, the county, and the parties;\n\n(B) be directed to the defendant;\n\n(C) state the name and address of the plaintiffs attorney or—if unrepresented—of the plaintiff;\n\n(D) state the time within which the defendant must appear and defend under Rule 12(a) or any other applicable rule or statute;\n\n(E) notify the defendant that a failure to appear and defend will result in a default judgment against the defendant for the relief demanded in the complaint;\n\n(F) be signed by the clerk;\n\n(G) bear the courts seal; and\n\n(H) comply with Rule 4.4(c)(2)(C) when service is made by publication.\n\n(2) Amendments. The court may permit a summons to be amended.\n\n(b) Issuance. On or after filing a complaint, the plaintiff must present a summons to the clerk for issuance under signature and seal. If a summons is properly presented, the clerk must issue a summons under signature and seal to the plaintiff for service on the defendant. A summons—or a copy of a summons that is addressed to multiple defendants—must be issued for each defendant to be served.\n\n(c) Service.\n\n(1) In General. Unless a defendant voluntarily appears, the plaintiff is responsible for:\n\n(A) obtaining a waiver of service under Rule 4.1, if applicable; or\n\n(B) having the summons and complaint served under Rule 4.2, 4.3, or 4.4 within the time allowed by Rule 4(e).\n\n(2) Service With a Copy of the Complaint. A summons must be served with a copy of the complaint. The plaintiff must furnish the necessary copies to the person who makes service.\n\n(3) By Whom. The summons and complaint may be served by the sheriff, or a deputy sheriff, of the county where the defendant is found or by any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party to the action.\n\n(4) Cumulative Service Methods. The methods of service provided in Rules 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 are cumulative and may be utilized with, after, or independently of any other methods of service.\n\n(d) Proof of Service. Unless a defendant voluntarily appears or waives or admits service, a plaintiff must file proof of service with the court stating the date, place, and manner of service no later than the time permitted for the defendant to respond to the summons.\n\n(1) Service Within the United States. Proof of service within Nevada or within the United States must be made by affidavit from the person who served the summons and complaint.\n\n(2) Service Outside the United States. Service not within the United States must be proved as follows:\n\n(A) if made under Rule 4.3(b)(1)(A), as provided in the applicable treaty or convention; or\n\n(B) if made under Rule 4.3(b)(1)(B) or (C), by a receipt signed by the addressee, or by other evidence satisfying the court that the summons and complaint were delivered to the addressee.\n\n(3) Service by Publication. If service is made by publication, a copy of the publication must be attached to the proof of service, and proof of service must be made by affidavit from:\n\n(A) the publisher or other designated employee having knowledge of the publication; and\n\n(B) if the summons and complaint were mailed to a persons last-known address, the individual depositing the summons and complaint in the mail.\n\n(4) Amendments. The court may permit proof of service to be amended.\n\n(5) Failure to Make Proof of Service. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity of the service.\n\n(e) Time Limit for Service.\n\n(1) In General. The summons and complaint must be served upon a defendant no later than 120 days after the complaint is filed, unless the court grants an extension of time under this rule.\n\n(2) Dismissal. If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant before the 120-day service period—or any extension thereof—expires, the court must dismiss the action, without prejudice, as to that defendant upon motion or upon the courts own order to show cause.\n\n(3) Timely Motion to Extend Time. If a plaintiff files a motion for an extension of time before the 120-day service period—or any extension thereof—expires and shows that good cause exists for granting an extension of the service period, the court must extend the service period and set a reasonable date by which service should be made.\n\n(4) Failure to Make Timely Motion to Extend Time. If a plaintiff files a motion for an extension of time after the 120-day service period—or any extension thereof—expires, the court must first determine whether good cause exists for the plaintiffs failure to timely file the motion for an extension before the court considers whether good cause exists for granting an extension of the service period. If the plaintiff shows that good cause exists for the plaintiffs failure to timely file the motion and for granting an extension of the service period, the court must extend the time for service and set a reasonable date by which service should be made.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 4.1. Waiving Service\n\n(a) Requesting a Waiver. An individual, entity, or association that is subject to service under Rule 4.2(a), 4.2(c)(1) or (2), 4.3(a)(1) or (3), or 4.3(b)(1) or (3) has a duty to avoid unnecessary expenses of serving the summons. The plaintiff may notify such a defendant that an action has been commenced and request that the defendant waive service of a summons. The notice and request must:\n\n(1) be in writing and be addressed:\n\n(A) to the individual defendant; or\n\n(B) for an entity or association, to a person designated by Rule 4.2(c)(1);\n\n(2) name the court where the complaint was filed;\n\n(3) be accompanied by a copy of the complaint, two copies of the waiver form, Form 2 in the Appendix of Forms or its substantial equivalent, and a prepaid means for returning the form;\n\n(4) inform the defendant, using the waiver form, of the consequences of waiving and not waiving service;\n\n(5) state the date when the request is sent;\n\n(6) give the defendant a reasonable time of at least 30 days after the request was sent—or at least 60 days if sent to the defendant outside the United States—to return the waiver; and\n\n(7) be sent by first-class mail or other reliable means.\n\n(b) Failure to Waive. If a defendant located within the United States fails, without good cause, to sign and return a waiver requested by a plaintiff located within the United States, the court must impose on the defendant:\n\n(1) the expenses later incurred in making service; and\n\n(2) the reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, of any motion required to collect those service expenses.\n\n(c) Time to Answer After a Waiver. A defendant who, before being served with process, timely returns a waiver need not serve an answer to the complaint until 60 days after the request was sent—or until 90 days after it was sent to the defendant outside the United States.\n\n(d) Results of Filing a Waiver. When the plaintiff files a waiver, proof of service is not required and these rules apply as if a summons and complaint had been served at the time of filing the waiver.\n\n(e) Jurisdiction and Venue Not Waived. Waiving service of a summons does not waive any objection to personal jurisdiction or to venue.\n\n[Added; effective March 1, 2019; Amended effective March 26, 2019.]\n\nRule 4.2. Service Within Nevada\n\n(a) Serving an Individual. Unless otherwise provided by these rules, service may be made on an individual:\n\n(1) by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the individual personally;\n\n(2) by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the individuals dwelling or usual place of abode with a person of suitable age and discretion who currently resides therein and is not an adverse party to the individual being served; or\n\n(3) by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.\n\n(b) Serving Minors and Incapacitated Persons.\n\n(1) Minors.

An incapacitated person must be served by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint:\n\n(A) to the incapacitated person; and\n\n(B) to one of the following persons:\n\n(i) if a guardian or similar fiduciary has been appointed for the incapacitated person, to the fiduciary under Rule 4.2(a), (c), or (d), as appropriate for the type of fiduciary; or\n\n(ii) if a fiduciary has not been appointed:\n\n(a) to a person of suitable age and discretion with whom the incapacitated person resides;\n\n(b) if the incapacitated person is living in a facility, to the facility under Rule 4.2, as appropriate for the type of facility; or\n\n(c) to another person as provided by court order.\n\n(c) Serving Entities and Associations.\n\n(1) Entities and Associations in Nevada.\n\n(A) An entity or association that is formed under the laws of this state, is registered to do business in this state, or has appointed a registered agent in this state, may be served by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to:\n\n(i) the registered agent of the entity or association;\n\n(ii) any officer or director of a corporation;\n\n(iii) any partner of a general partnership;\n\n(iv) any general partner of a limited partnership;\n\n(v) any member of a member-managed limited-liability company;\n\n(vi) any manager of a manager-managed limited-liability company;\n\n(vii) any trustee of a business trust;\n\n(viii) any officer or director of a miscellaneous organization mentioned in NRS Chapter 81;\n\n(ix) any managing or general agent of any entity or association; or\n\n(x) any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.\n\n(B) If an agent is one authorized by statute and the statute so requires, a copy of the summons and complaint must also be mailed to the defendant entity or association at its last-known address.\n\n(2) Other Foreign Entities and Associations. A foreign entity or association that cannot be served under Rule 4.2(c)(1) may be served by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to any officer, director, partner, member, manager, trustee, or agent identified in Rule 4.2(c)(1) that is located within this state.\n\n(3) Service via the Nevada Secretary of State.\n\n(A) If, for any reason, service on an entity or association required to appoint a registered agent in this state or to register to do business in this state cannot be made under Rule 4.2(c)(1) or (2), then the plaintiff may seek leave of court to serve the Nevada Secretary of State in the entitys or associations stead by filing with the court an affidavit:\n\n(i) setting forth the facts demonstrating the plaintiffs good faith attempts to locate and serve the entity or association;\n\n(ii) explaining the reasons why service on the entity or association cannot be made; and\n\n(iii) stating the last-known address of the entity or association or of any person listed in Rule 4.2(c)(1), if any.\n\n(B) Upon court approval, service may be made by:\n\n(i) delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the Nevada Secretary of State or his or her deputy; and\n\n(ii) posting a copy of the summons and complaint in the office of the clerk of the court in which such action is brought or pending.\n\n(C) If the plaintiff is aware of the last-known address of any person listed in Rule 4.2(c)(1), the plaintiff must also mail a copy of the summons and complaint to each such person at the persons last-known address by registered or certified mail. The court may also order additional notice to be sent under Rule 4.4(d) if the plaintiff is aware of other contact information of the entity or association or of any person listed in Rule 4.2(c)(1).\n\n(D) Unless otherwise ordered by the court, service under Rule 4.2(c)(3) may not be used as a substitute in place of serving, under Rule 4.3(a), an entity or association through a person listed in Rule 4.2(c)(1) whose address is known but who lives outside this state.\n\n(E) The defendant entity or association must serve a responsive pleading within 21 days after the later of:\n\n(i) the date of service on the Nevada Secretary of State and posting with the clerk of the court; or\n\n(ii) the date of the first mailing of the summons and complaint to the last-known address of any person listed in Rule 4.2(c)(1).\n\n(d) Serving the State of Nevada, Its Public Entities and Political Subdivisions, and Their Officers and Employees.\n\n(1) The State and Its Public Entities.

Serving and Filing Pleadings and Other Papers\n\n(a) Service: When Required.\n\n(1) In General. Unless these rules provide otherwise, each of the following papers must be served on every party:\n\n(A) an order stating that service is required;\n\n(B) a pleading filed after the original complaint, unless the court orders otherwise under Rule 5(c) because there are numerous defendants;\n\n(C) any paper relating to discovery required to be served on a party, unless the court orders otherwise;\n\n(D) a written motion, except one that may be heard ex parte; and\n\n(E) a written notice, appearance, demand, offer of judgment, or any similar paper.\n\n(2) If a Party Fails to Appear. No service is required on a party who is in default for failing to appear. But a pleading that asserts a new claim for relief against such a party must be served on that party under Rule 4.\n\n(b) Service: How Made.\n\n(1) Serving an Attorney. If a party is represented by an attorney, service under this rule must be made on the attorney unless the court orders service on the party.\n\n(2) Service in General. A paper is served under this rule by:\n\n(A) handing it to the person;\n\n(B) leaving it:\n\n(i) at the persons office with a clerk or other person in charge or, if no one is in charge, in a conspicuous place in the office; or\n\n(ii) if the person has no office or the office is closed, at the persons dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there;\n\n(C) mailing it to the persons last-known address—in which event service is complete upon mailing;\n\n(D) leaving it with the court clerk if the person has no known address;\n\n(E) submitting it to the courts electronic filing system, if established under the NEFCR, for electronic service under NEFCR 9 or sending it by other electronic means that the person consented to in writing—in which events service is complete upon submission or sending, but is not effective if the serving party learns that it did not reach the person to be served; or\n\n(F) delivering it by any other means that the person consented to in writing—in which event service is complete when the person making service delivers it to the agency designated to make delivery.\n\n(3) Using Court Facilities. If the court has established an electronic filing system under the NEFCR through which service may be effected, a party may use the courts transmission facilities to make service under Rule 5(b)(2)(E).\n\n(4) Proof of Service. Proof of service may be made by certificate, acknowledgment, or other proof satisfactory to the court. Proof of service should accompany the filing or be filed in a reasonable time thereafter. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity of service.\n\n(c) Serving Numerous Defendants.\n\n(1) In General. If an action involves an unusually large number of defendants, the court may, on motion or on its own, order that:\n\n(A) defendants pleadings and replies to them need not be served on other defendants;\n\n(B) any crossclaim, counterclaim, avoidance, or affirmative defense in those pleadings and replies to them will be treated as denied or avoided by all other parties; and\n\n(C) filing any such pleading and serving it on the plaintiff constitutes notice of the pleading to all parties.\n\n(2) Notifying Parties. A copy of every such order must be served on the parties as the court directs.\n\n(d) Filing.\n\n(1) Required Filings. Any paper after the complaint that is required to be served must be filed no later than a reasonable time after service. But disclosures under Rule 16.1 and the following discovery requests and responses must not be filed until they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing: depositions, interrogatories, requests for documents or tangible things or to permit entry onto land, and requests for admission.\n\n(2) Nonelectronic Filing. A paper not filed electronically is filed by delivering it:\n\n(A) to the clerk; or\n\n(B) to a judge who agrees to accept it for filing, and who must then note the filing date on the paper and promptly send it to the clerk.\n\n(3) Electronic Filing, Signing, or Verification. The court may, by local rule, allow papers to be filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with any technical standards established by the NEFCR. A paper filed electronically is a written paper for purposes of these rules.\n\n(4) Acceptance by the Clerk. The clerk must not refuse to file a paper solely because it is not in the form prescribed by these rules or by a local rule or practice.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 5.1. Reserved\n\nRule 5.2. Reserved\n\nRule 6. Computing and Extending Time; Time for Motion Papers\n\n(a) Computing Time. The following rules apply in computing any time period specified in these rules, in any local rule or court order, or in any statute that does not specify a method of computing time.\n\n(1) Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit. When the period is stated in days or a longer unit of time:\n\n(A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;\n\n(B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and\n\n(C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.\n\n(2) Period Stated in Hours. When the period is stated in hours:\n\n(A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the period;\n\n(B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and\n\n(C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the same time on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.\n\n(3) Inaccessibility of the Clerks Office. Unless the court orders otherwise, if the clerks office is inaccessible:\n\n(A) on the last day for filing under Rule 6(a)(1), then the time for filing is extended to the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or\n\n(B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 6(a)(2), then the time for filing is extended to the same time on the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.\n\n(4) Last Day Defined. Unless a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or court order, the last day ends:\n\n(A) for electronic filing under the NEFCR, at 11:59 p.m. in the courts local time; and\n\n(B) for filing by other means, when the clerks office is scheduled to close.\n\n(5) Next Day Defined. The next day is determined by continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an event and backward when measured before an event.\n\n(6) Legal Holiday Defined. Legal holiday means any day set aside as a legal holiday by NRS 236.015.\n\n(b) Extending Time.\n\n(1) In General. When an act may or must be done within a specified time:\n\n(A) the parties may obtain an extension of time by stipulation if approved by the court, provided that the stipulation is submitted to the court before the original time or its extension expires; or\n\n(B) the court may, for good cause, extend the time:\n\n(i) with or without motion or notice if the court acts, or if a request is made, before the original time or its extension expires; or\n\n(ii) on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.\n\n(2) Exceptions. A court must not extend the time to act under Rules 50(b) and (d), 52(b), 59(b), (d), and (e), and 60(c)(1), and must not extend the time after it has expired under Rule 54(d)(2).\n\n(c) Motions, Notices of Hearing, and Affidavits.\n\n(1) In General. A written motion and notice of the hearing must be served at least 21 days before the time specified for the hearing, with the following exceptions:\n\n(A) when the motion may be heard ex parte;\n\n(B) when these rules or the local rules provide otherwise; or\n\n(C) when a court order—which a party may, for good cause, apply for ex parte—sets a different time.\n\n(2) Supporting Affidavit. Any affidavit supporting a motion must be served with the motion. Except as Rule 59(c) provides otherwise, any opposing affidavit must be served at least 7 days before the hearing, unless the court permits service at another time.\n\n(d) Additional Time After Certain Kinds of Service. When a party may or must act within a specified time after being served and service is made under Rule 5(b)(2)(C) (mail), (D) (leaving with the clerk), or (F) (other means consented to), 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire under Rule 6(a).\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nIII.

A request for a court order must be made by motion. The motion must:\n\n(A) be in writing unless made during a hearing or trial;\n\n(B) state with particularity the grounds for seeking the order; and\n\n(C) state the relief sought.\n\n(2) Form. The rules governing captions, signing, and other matters of form in pleadings apply to motions and other papers.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 7.1. Disclosure Statement\n\n(a) Who Must File; Contents. A nongovernmental party, except for a natural person, must file a disclosure statement that:\n\n(1) identifies any parent entity and any publicly held entity owning 10% or more of the partys stock or other ownership interest; or\n\n(2) states that there is no such entity.\n\n(b) Time to File; Supplemental Filing. A party must:\n\n(1) file the disclosure statement with its first appearance, pleading, petition, motion, response, or other request addressed to the court; and\n\n(2) promptly file a supplemental statement if any required information changes.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 8. General Rules of Pleading\n\n(a) Claim for Relief. A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain:\n\n(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the courts jurisdiction, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new jurisdictional support;\n\n(2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief;\n\n(3) a demand for the relief sought, which may include relief in the alternative or different types of relief; and\n\n(4) if the pleader seeks more than $15,000 in monetary damages, the demand for relief may request damages in excess of $15,000 without further specification of the amount.\n\n(b) Defenses; Admissions and Denials.\n\n(1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a party must:\n\n(A) state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim asserted against it; and\n\n(B) admit or deny the allegations asserted against it by an opposing party.\n\n(2) Denials—Responding to the Substance. A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.\n\n(3) General and Specific Denials. A party that intends in good faith to deny all the allegations of a pleading—including the jurisdictional grounds—may do so by a general denial. A party that does not intend to deny all the allegations must either specifically deny designated allegations or generally deny all except those specifically admitted.\n\n(4) Denying Part of an Allegation. A party that intends in good faith to deny only part of an allegation must admit the part that is true and deny the rest.\n\n(5) Lacking Knowledge or Information. A party that lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation must so state, and the statement has the effect of a denial.\n\n(6) Effect of Failing to Deny. An allegation—other than one relating to the amount of damages—is admitted if a responsive pleading is required and the allegation is not denied. If a responsive pleading is not required, an allegation is considered denied or avoided.\n\n(c) Affirmative Defenses.\n\n(1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense, including:\n\n(A) accord and satisfaction;\n\n(B) arbitration and award;\n\n(C) assumption of risk;\n\n(D) contributory negligence;\n\n(E) discharge in bankruptcy;\n\n(F) duress;\n\n(G) estoppel;\n\n(H) failure of consideration;\n\n(I) fraud;\n\n(J) illegality;\n\n(K) injury by fellow servant;\n\n(L) laches;\n\n(M) license;\n\n(N) payment;\n\n(O) release;\n\n(P) res judicata;\n\n(Q) statute of frauds;\n\n(R) statute of limitations; and\n\n(S) waiver.\n\n(2) Mistaken Designation. If a party mistakenly designates a defense as a counterclaim, or a counterclaim as a defense, the court must, if justice requires, treat the pleading as though it were correctly designated, and may impose terms for doing so.\n\n(d) Pleading to Be Concise and Direct; Alternative Statements; Inconsistency.\n\n(1) In General. Each allegation must be simple, concise, and direct. No technical form is required.\n\n(2) Alternative Statements of a Claim or Defense. A party may set out two or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements, the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.\n\n(3) Inconsistent Claims or Defenses. A party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.\n\n(e) Construing Pleadings. Pleadings must be construed so as to do justice.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 9. Pleading Special Matters\n\n(a) Capacity or Authority to Sue; Legal Existence.\n\n(1) In General. Except when required to show that the court has jurisdiction, a pleading need not allege:\n\n(A) a partys capacity to sue or be sued;\n\n(B) a partys authority to sue or be sued in a representative capacity; or\n\n(C) the legal existence of an organized association of persons that is made a party.\n\n(2) Raising Those Issues. To raise any of those issues, a party must do so by a specific denial, which must state any supporting facts that are peculiarly within the partys knowledge.\n\n(b) Fraud or Mistake; Conditions of Mind. In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a persons mind may be alleged generally.\n\n(c) Conditions Precedent. In pleading conditions precedent, it suffices to allege generally that all conditions precedent have occurred or been performed. But when denying that a condition precedent has occurred or been performed, a party must do so with particularity.\n\n(d) Official Document or Act. In pleading an official document or official act, it suffices to allege that the document was legally issued or the act legally done.\n\n(e) Judgment. In pleading a judgment or decision of a domestic or foreign court, a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, or a board or officer, it suffices to plead the judgment or decision without showing jurisdiction to render it.\n\n(f) Time and Place. An allegation of time or place is material when testing the sufficiency of a pleading.\n\n(g) Special Damages. If an item of special damage is claimed, it must be specifically stated.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 10. Form of Pleadings\n\n(a) Caption; Names of Parties. Every pleading must have a caption with the courts name, the county, a title, a case number, and a Rule 7(a) designation. The caption of the complaint must name all the parties; the caption of other pleadings, after naming the first party on each side, may refer generally to other parties.\n\n(b) Paragraphs; Separate Statements. A party must state its claims or defenses in numbered paragraphs, each limited as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances. A later pleading may refer by number to a paragraph in an earlier pleading. If doing so would promote clarity, each claim founded on a separate transaction or occurrence—and each defense other than a denial—must be stated in a separate count or defense.\n\n(c) Adoption by Reference; Exhibits. A statement in a pleading may be adopted by reference elsewhere in the same pleading or in any other pleading or motion. A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.\n\n(d) Using a Fictitious Name to Identify a Defendant. If the name of a defendant is unknown to the pleader, the defendant may be designated by any name. When the defendants true name is discovered, the pleader should promptly substitute the actual defendant for a fictitious party.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 11. Signing Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers; Representations to the Court; Sanctions\n\n(a) Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorneys name—or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented. The paper must state the signers address, email address, and telephone number. Unless a rule or statute specifically states otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attorneys or partys attention.\n\n(b) Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the persons knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:\n\n(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;\n\n(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;\n\n(3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and\n\n(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.\n\n(c) Sanctions.\n\n(1) In General. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that Rule 11(b) has been violated, the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the rule or is responsible for the violation. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm must be held jointly responsible for a violation committed by its partner, associate, or employee.\n\n(2) Motion for Sanctions. A motion for sanctions must be made separately from any other motion and must describe the specific conduct that allegedly violates Rule 11(b). The motion must be served under Rule 5, but it must not be filed or be presented to the court if the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within 21 days after service or within another time the court sets. If warranted, the court may award to the prevailing party the reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, incurred for presenting or opposing the motion.\n\n(3) On the Courts Initiative. On its own, the court may order an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why conduct specifically described in the order has not violated Rule 11(b).\n\n(4) Nature of a Sanction. A sanction imposed under this rule must be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. The sanction may include nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty into court; or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of part or all of the reasonable attorney fees and other expenses directly resulting from the violation.\n\n(5) Limitations on Monetary Sanctions. The court must not impose a monetary sanction:\n\n(A) against a represented party for violating Rule 11(b)(2); or\n\n(B) on its own, unless it issued the show-cause order under Rule 11(c)(3) before voluntary dismissal or settlement of the claims made by or against the party that is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned.\n\n(6) Requirements for an Order. An order imposing a sanction must describe the sanctioned conduct and explain the basis for the sanction.\n\n(d) Inapplicability to Discovery. This rule does not apply to disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and motions under Rules 16.1, 16.2, 16.205, 26 through 37, and 45(a)(4). Sanctions for improper discovery or refusal to make or allow discovery are governed by Rules 26(g) and 37.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 12. Defenses and Objections: When and How Presented; Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings; Consolidating Motions; Waiving Defenses; Pretrial Hearing\n\n(a) Time to Serve a Responsive Pleading.\n\n(1) In General. Unless another time is specified by Rule 4.2(c)(3)(E), this rule, or a statute, the time for serving a responsive pleading is as follows:\n\n(A) A defendant must serve an answer:\n\n(i) within 21 days after being served with the summons and complaint; or\n\n(ii) if the defendant has timely waived service under Rule 4.1, within 60 days after the request for a waiver was sent, or within 90 days after the request for a waiver was sent to the defendant outside of the United States.\n\n(B) A party must serve an answer to a counterclaim or crossclaim within 21 days after being served with the pleading that states the counterclaim or crossclaim.\n\n(C) A party must serve a reply to an answer within 21 days after being served with an order to reply, unless the order specifies a different time.\n\n(2) The State of Nevada, Its Public Entities and Political Subdivisions, and Their Officers and Employees. Unless another time is specified by Rule 12(a)(3) or a statute, the following parties must serve an answer to a complaint, counterclaim, or crossclaim within 45 days after service on the party, or if required service on the Attorney General, whichever date of service is later:\n\n(A) the State and any public entity of the State;\n\n(B) any county, city, town or other political subdivision of the State, and any public entity of such a political subdivision; and\n\n(C) any current or former public officer or employee of the State, any public entity of the State, any county, city, town or other political subdivision of the State, or any public entity of such a political subdivision, who is sued in his or her official capacity or his or her individual capacity for an act or omission relating to his or her public duties or employment.\n\n(3) Effect of a Motion. Unless the court sets a different time, serving a motion under this rule alters these periods as follows:\n\n(A) if the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until trial, the responsive pleading must be served within 14 days after notice of the courts action; or\n\n(B) if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading must be served within 14 days after the more definite statement is served.\n\n(b) How to Present Defenses. Every defense to a claim for relief in any pleading must be asserted in the responsive pleading if one is required. But a party may assert the following defenses by motion:\n\n(1) lack of subject-matter jurisdiction;\n\n(2) lack of personal jurisdiction;\n\n(3) insufficient process;\n\n(4) insufficient service of process;\n\n(5) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and\n\n(6) failure to join a party under Rule 19.\n\nA motion asserting any of these defenses must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed. If a pleading sets out a claim for relief that does not require a responsive pleading, an opposing party may assert at trial any defense to that claim. No defense or objection is waived by joining it with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or in a motion.\n\n(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. After the pleadings are closed—but early enough not to delay trial—a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\n\n(d) Result of Presenting Matters Outside the Pleadings. If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(5) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.\n\n(e) Motion for a More Definite Statement. A party may move for a more definite statement of a pleading to which a responsive pleading is allowed but which is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response. The motion must be made before filing a responsive pleading and must point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the court orders a more definite statement and the order is not obeyed within 14 days after notice of the order or within the time the court sets, the court may strike the pleading or issue any other appropriate order.\n\n(f) Motion to Strike. The court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. The court may act:\n\n(1) on its own; or\n\n(2) on motion made by a party either before responding to the pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 21 days after being served with the pleading.\n\n(g) Joining Motions.\n\n(1) Right to Join. A motion under this rule may be joined with any other motion allowed by this rule.\n\n(2) Limitation on Further Motions. Except as provided in Rule 12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under this rule must not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.\n\n(h) Waiving and Preserving Certain Defenses.\n\n(1) When Some Are Waived. A party waives any defense listed in Rule 12(b)(2)-(4) by:\n\n(A) omitting it from a motion in the circumstances described in Rule 12(g)(2); or\n\n(B) failing to either:\n\n(i) make it by motion under this rule; or\n\n(ii) include it in a responsive pleading or in an amendment allowed by Rule 15(a)(1) as a matter of course.\n\n(2) When to Raise Others. Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, to join a person required by Rule 19(b), or to state a legal defense to a claim may be raised:\n\n(A) in any pleading allowed or ordered under Rule 7(a);\n\n(B) by a motion under Rule 12(c); or\n\n(C) at trial.\n\n(3) Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction. If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\n\n(i) Hearing Before Trial. If a party so moves, any defense listed in Rule 12(b)(1)-(6)—whether made in a pleading or by motion—and a motion under Rule 12(c) must be heard and decided before trial unless the court orders a deferral until trial.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 13. Counterclaim and Crossclaim\n\n(a) Compulsory Counterclaim.\n\n(1) In General. A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that—at the time of its service—the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim:\n\n(A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing partys claim; and\n\n(B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.\n\n(2) Exceptions. The pleader need not state the claim if:\n\n(A) when the action was commenced, the claim was the subject of another pending action; or\n\n(B) the opposing party sued on its claim by attachment or other process that did not establish personal jurisdiction over the pleader on that claim, and the pleader does not assert any counterclaim under this rule.\n\n(b) Permissive Counterclaim. A pleading may state as a counterclaim against an opposing party any claim that is not compulsory.\n\n(c) Relief Sought in a Counterclaim. A counterclaim need not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may request relief that exceeds in amount or differs in kind from the relief sought by the opposing party.\n\n(d) Counterclaim Against the State. These rules do not expand the right to assert a counterclaim—or to claim a credit—against the State, its political subdivisions, their agencies and entities, or any current or former officer or employee thereof.\n\n(e) Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading. The court may permit a party to file a supplemental pleading asserting a counterclaim that matured or was acquired by the party after serving an earlier pleading.\n\n(f) Abrogated.\n\n(g) Crossclaim Against a Coparty. A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the crossclaimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the crossclaimant.\n\n(h) Joining Additional Parties. Rules 19 and 20 govern the addition of a person as a party to a counterclaim or crossclaim.\n\n(i) Separate Trials; Separate Judgments. If the court orders separate trials under Rule 42(b), it may enter judgment on a counterclaim or crossclaim under Rule 54(b) when it has jurisdiction to do so, even if the opposing partys claims have been dismissed or otherwise resolved.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 14. Third-Party Practice\n\n(a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party.\n\n(1) Timing of the Summons and Complaint. A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, file a third-party complaint against a nonparty, the third-party defendant, who is or may be liable to it for all or part of the claim against it. But the third-party plaintiff must, by motion, obtain the courts leave to file the third-party complaint if it files the third-party complaint more than 14 days after serving its original answer. A summons, the complaint, and the third-party complaint must be served on the third-party defendant, or service must be waived.\n\n(2) Third-Party Defendants Claims and Defenses. After being served or waiving service, the third-party defendant:\n\n(A) must assert any defense against the third-party plaintiffs claim under Rule 12;\n\n(B) must assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim against a defendant or another third-party defendant under Rule 13(g);\n\n(C) may assert against the plaintiff any defense that the third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiffs claim; and\n\n(D) may also assert against the plaintiff any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiffs claim against the third-party plaintiff.\n\n(3) Plaintiffs Claims Against a Third-Party Defendant. The plaintiff may assert against the third-party defendant any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiffs claim against the third-party plaintiff. The third-party defendant must then assert any defense under Rule 12 and any counterclaim under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counterclaim under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim under Rule 13(g).\n\n(4) Defendants Claims Against a Third-Party Defendant. A defendant may assert against the third-party defendant any crossclaim under Rule 13(g).\n\n(5) Motion to Strike, Sever, or Try Separately. Any party may move to strike the third-party claim, to sever it, or to try it separately.\n\n(6) Third-Party Defendants Claim Against a Nonparty. A third-party defendant may proceed under this rule against a nonparty who is or may be liable to the third-party defendant for all or part of any claim against it.\n\n(b) When a Plaintiff May Bring in a Third Party. When a claim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may bring in a third party if this rule would allow a defendant to do so.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 15. Amended and Supplemental Pleadings\n\n(a) Amendments Before Trial.\n\n(1) Amending as a Matter of Course. A party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within:\n\n(A) 21 days after serving it; or\n\n(B) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.\n\n(2) Other Amendments. In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing partys written consent or the courts leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\n\n(3) Time to Respond. Unless the court orders otherwise, any required response to an amended pleading must be made within the time remaining to respond to the original pleading or within 14 days after service of the amended pleading, whichever is later.\n\n(b) Amendments During and After Trial.\n\n(1) Based on an Objection at Trial. If, at trial, a party objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that partys action or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence.\n\n(2) For Issues Tried by Consent. When an issue not raised by the pleadings is tried by the parties express or implied consent, it must be treated in all respects as if raised in the pleadings. A party may move—at any time, even after judgment—to amend the pleadings to conform them to the evidence and to raise an unpleaded issue. But failure to amend does not affect the result of the trial of that issue.\n\n(c) Relation Back of Amendments. An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when:\n\n(1) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading; or\n\n(2) the amendment changes a party or the naming of a party against whom a claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1) is satisfied and if, within the period provided by Rule 4(e) for serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment:\n\n(A) received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and\n\n(B) knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper partys identity.\n\n(d) Supplemental Pleadings. On motion and reasonable notice, the court may, on just terms, permit a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented. The court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating a claim or defense. The court may order that the opposing party plead to the supplemental pleading within a specified time.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 16. Pretrial Conferences; Scheduling; Management\n\n(a) Pretrial Conferences; Objectives. In any action, the court may order the attorneys and any unrepresented parties to appear for one or more pretrial conferences for such purposes as:\n\n(1) expediting disposition of the action;\n\n(2) establishing early and continuing control so that the case will not be protracted because of lack of management;\n\n(3) discouraging wasteful pretrial activities;\n\n(4) improving the quality of the trial through more thorough preparation; and\n\n(5) facilitating settlement.\n\n(b) Scheduling and Planning.\n\n(1) Scheduling Order. Except in categories of actions exempted by local rule, the court must, after consulting with the attorneys for the parties and any unrepresented parties by a scheduling conference, case conference, telephone conference, or other suitable means, enter a scheduling order.\n\n(2) Time to Issue. The court must issue the scheduling order as soon as practicable, but unless the court finds good cause for delay, the court must issue it within 60 days after:\n\n(A) a Rule 16.1 case conference report has been filed; or\n\n(B) the court waives the requirement of a case conference report under Rule 16.1(f).\n\n(3) Contents of the Order.\n\n(A) Required Contents. The scheduling order must limit the time to join other parties, amend the pleadings, complete discovery, and file motions.\n\n(B) Permitted Contents. The scheduling order may:\n\n(i) provide for disclosure, discovery, or preservation of electronically stored information;\n\n(ii) direct that before moving for an order relating to discovery, the movant must request a conference with the court;\n\n(iii) set dates for pretrial conferences, a final pretrial conference, and for trial; and\n\n(iv) include any other appropriate matters.\n\n(4) Modifying a Schedule. A schedule may be modified by the court for good cause.\n\n(c) Attendance and Subjects to Be Discussed at Pretrial Conferences.\n\n(1) Attendance. A represented party must authorize at least one of its attorneys to make stipulations and admissions about all matters that can reasonably be anticipated for discussion at a pretrial conference. If appropriate, the court may require that a party or its representative be present or reasonably available by other means to consider possible settlement.\n\n(2) Matters for Consideration. At any pretrial conference, the court may consider and take appropriate action on the following matters:\n\n(A) formulating and simplifying the issues, and eliminating frivolous claims or defenses;\n\n(B) amending the pleadings if necessary or desirable;\n\n(C) obtaining admissions and stipulations about facts and documents to avoid unnecessary proof, and ruling in advance on the admissibility of evidence;\n\n(D) avoiding unnecessary proof and cumulative evidence, and limiting the use of testimony under NRS 47.060 and NRS 50.275;\n\n(E) determining the appropriateness and timing of summary adjudication under Rule 56;\n\n(F) identifying witnesses and documents, scheduling the filing and exchange of any pretrial briefs, and setting dates for further conferences and for trial;\n\n(G) referring matters to a discovery commissioner or a master;\n\n(H) settling the case and using special procedures to assist in resolving the dispute when authorized by statute or local rule;\n\n(I) determining the form and content of the pretrial order;\n\n(J) disposing of pending motions;\n\n(K) adopting special procedures for managing potentially difficult or protracted actions that may involve complex issues, multiple parties, difficult legal questions, or unusual proof problems;\n\n(L) ordering a separate trial under Rule 42(b) of a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, third-party claim, or particular issue;\n\n(M) establishing a reasonable limit on the time allowed to present evidence; and\n\n(N) facilitating in other ways the just, speedy, and inexpensive disposition of the action.\n\n(d) Pretrial Orders. After any conference under this rule, the court should issue an order reciting the action taken. This order controls the course of the action unless the court modifies it.\n\n(e) Final Pretrial Conference and Orders. The court may hold a final pretrial conference to formulate a trial plan, including a plan to facilitate the admission of evidence. The conference must be held as close to the start of trial as is reasonable, and must be attended by at least one attorney who will conduct the trial for each party and by any unrepresented party. The court may modify the order issued after a final pretrial conference only to prevent manifest injustice.\n\n(f) Sanctions.\n\n(1) In General. On motion or on its own, the court may issue any just orders, including those authorized by Rule 37(b)(1), if a party or its attorney:\n\n(A) fails to appear at a scheduling or other pretrial conference;\n\n(B) is substantially unprepared to participate—or does not participate in good faith—in the conference; or\n\n(C) fails to obey a scheduling or other pretrial order.\n\n(2) Imposing Fees and Costs. Instead of or in addition to any other sanction, the court must order the party, its attorney, or both to pay the reasonable expenses—including attorney fees—incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule, unless the noncompliance was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\n\n[Amended; effective March 1, 2019.]\n\nRule 16.1. Mandatory Pretrial Discovery Requirements\n\n(a) Required Disclosures.\n\n(1) Initial Disclosure.\n\n(A) In General. Except as exempted by Rule 16.1(a)(1)(B) or as otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the other parties:\n\n(i) the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have information discoverable under Rule 26(b), including for impeachment or rebuttal, identifying the subjects of the information;\n\n(ii) a copy—or a description by category and location—of all documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, including for impeachment or rebuttal, and, unless privileged or protected from disclosure, any record, report, or witness statement, in any form, concerning the incident that gives rise to the lawsuit;\n\n(iii) when personal injury is in issue, the identity of each relevant medical provider so that the opposing party may prepare an appropriate medical authorization for signature to obtain medical records from each provider;\n\n(iv) a computation of each category of damages claimed by the disclosing party—who must make available for inspection and copying as under Rule 34 the documents or other evidentiary material, unless privileged or protected from disclosure, on which each computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered; and\n\n(v) for inspection and copying as under Rule 34, any insurance agreement under which an insurance business may be liable to satisfy all or part of a possible judgment in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment and any disclaimer or limitation of coverage or reservation of rights under any such insurance agreement.\n\n(B) Proceedings Exempt From Initial Disclosure. The following proceedings are exempt from initial disclosure:\n\n(i) an action within the original, exclusive jurisdiction of the family court, irrespective of whether the district court actually has a separate family court or division;\n\n(ii) an action filed under NRS Title 12 or 13;\n\n(iii) an appeal from a court of limited jurisdiction;\n\n(iv) an action for review on an administrative record;\n\n(v) a forfeiture action in rem arising from a statute;\n\n(vi) a petition for habeas corpus or any other proceeding to challenge a criminal conviction or sentence;\n\n(vii) an action to enforce or quash an administrative summons or subpoena;\n\n(viii) a proceeding ancillary to a proceeding in another court;\n\n(ix) an action to enforce an arbitration award; and\n\n(x) any other action that is not brought against a specific individual or entity.\n\n(C) Time for Initial Disclosures—In General. A party must make the initial disclosures at or within 14 days after the parties Rule 16.1(b) conference unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order, or unless a party objects during the conference that initial disclosures are not appropriate in this action and states the objection in the Rule 16.1(c) case conference report. In ruling on the objection, the court must determine what disclosures, if any, are to be made and must set the time for disclosure.\n\n(D) Time for Initial Disclosures—For Parties Served or Joined Later. A party that is first served or otherwise joined after the Rule 16.1(b) conference must make the initial disclosures within 30 days after filing an answer or a motion under Rule 12, unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order.\n\n(E) Basis for Initial Disclosure; Unacceptable Excuses. A party must make its initial disclosures based on the information then reasonably available to it. A party is not excused from making its disclosures because it has not fully investigated the case or because it challenges the sufficiency of another partys disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.\n\n(2) Disclosure of Expert Testimony.\n\n(A) In General. In addition to the disclosures required by Rule 16.1(a)(1), a party must disclose to the other parties the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence under NRS 50.275, 50.285, and 50.305.\n\n(B) Witnesses Who Must Provide a Written Report. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, this disclosure must be accompanied by a written report—prepared and signed by the witness—if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or one whose duties as the partys employee regularly involve giving expert testimony. The report must contain:\n\n(i) a complete statement of all opinions the witness will express, and the basis and reasons for them;\n\n(ii) the facts or data considered by the witness in forming them;\n\n(iii) any exhibits that will be used to summarize or support them;\n\n(iv) the witnesss qualifications, including a list of all publications authored in the previous ten years;\n\n(v) a list of all other cases in which, during the previous four years, the witness testified as an expert at trial or by deposition; and\n\n(vi) a statement of the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony in the case.\n\n(C) Witnesses Who Do Not Provide a Written Report. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, if the witness is not required to provide a written report, this disclosure must state:\n\n(i) the subject matter on which the witness is expected to present evidence under NRS 50.275, 50.285, and 50.305;\n\n(ii) a summary of the facts and opinions to which the witness is expected to testify;\n\n(iii) the qualifications of that witness to present evidence under NRS 50.275, 50.285, and 50.305, which may be satisfied by the production of a resume or curriculum vitae; and\n\n(iv) the compensation of the witness for providing testimony at deposition and trial, which is satisfied by production of a fee schedule.\n\n(D) Treating Physicians.\n\n(i) Status. A treating physician who is retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case, or whose duties as the partys employee regularly involve giving expert testimony on behalf of the party, must provide a written report under Rule 16.1(a)(2)(B). Otherwise, a treating physician who is properly disclosed under Rule 16.1(a)(2)(C) may be deposed or called to testify without providing a written report. A treating physician is not required to provide a written report under Rule 16.1(a)(2)(B) solely because the physicians testimony may discuss ancillary treatment, or the diagnosis, prognosis, or causation of the patients injuries, that is not contained within the physicians medical chart, as long as the content of such testimony is properly disclosed under Rule 16.1(a)(2)(C)(i)-(iv).\n\n(ii) Change in Status. A treating physician will be deemed a retained expert witness subject to the written report requirement of Rule 16.1(a)(2)(B) if the party is asking the treating physician to provide opinions outside the course and scope of the treatment provided to the patient.\n\n(iii) Disclosure. The disclosure regarding a non-retained treating physician must include the information identified in Rule 16.1(a)(2)(C), to the extent practicable. In that regard, appropriate disclosure may include that the physician will testify in accordance with his or her medical chart, even if some records contained therein were prepared by another healthcare provider.\n\n(E) Time to Disclose Expert Testimony.\n\n(i) A party must make these disclosures at the times and in the sequence that the court orders. Absent a stipulation or a court order otherwise, the disclosures must be made:\n\n(a) at least 90 days before the discovery cut-off date; or\n\n(b) if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under Rule 16.1(a)(2)(B), (C), or (D), within 30 days after the other partys disclosure.\n\n(ii) The disclosure deadline under Rule 16.1(a)(2)(E)(i)(b) does not apply to any partys witness whose purpose is to contradict a portion of another partys case in chief that should have been expected and anticipated by the disclosing party, or to present any opinions outside of the scope of another partys disclosure.\n\n(F) Supplementing the Disclosure.\n\n(i) In General. The parties must supplement these disclosures when required under Rule 26(e).\n\n(ii) Non-Retained Experts. A non-retained expert, who is not identified at the time the expert disclosures are due, may be subsequently disclosed in accordance with Rule 26(e). In general, the disclosing party must move to reopen the discovery deadlines or otherwise seek leave of court in order to supplementally disclose a non-retained expert. However, supplementation may be made without first moving to reopen the expert disclosure deadlines or otherwise seeking leave of court, if such disclosure is made:\n\n(a) in accordance with Rule 16.1(a)(2)(C);\n\n(b) within a reasonable time after the non-retained experts opinions become known to the disclosing party; and\n\n(c) not later than 21 days before the close of discovery.\n\n(3) Pretrial Disclosures.\n\n(A) In General. In addition to the disclosures required by Rule 16.1(a)(1) and (2), a party must provide to the other parties and promptly file the following information about the evidence that it may present at trial, including impeachment and rebuttal evidence:\n\n(i) the name and, if not previously provided, the address and telephone number of each witness—separately identifying those the party expects to present, those witnesses who have been subpoenaed for trial, and those it may call if the need arises;\n\n(ii) the designation of those witnesses whose testimony the party expects to present by deposition and, if not taken stenographically, a transcript of the pertinent parts of the deposition; and\n\n(iii) an identification of each document or other exhibit, including summaries of other evidence—separately identifying those items the party expects to offer and those it may offer if the need arises.\n\n(B) Time for Pretrial Disclosures; Objections.\n\n(i) Unless the court orders otherwise, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial.\n\n(ii) Within 14 days after they are made, unless the court sets a different time, a party may serve and promptly file a list of the following objections:\n\n(a) any objections to the use under Rule 32(a) of a deposition designated by another party under Rule 16.1(a)(3)(A)(ii); and\n\n(b) any objection, together with the grounds for it, that may be made to the admissibility of materials identified under Rule 16.1(a)(3)(A)(iii).\n\n(iii) An objection not so made—except for one under NRS 48.025 and 48.035—is waived unless excused by the court for good cause.\n\n(4) Form of Disclosures. Unless the court orders otherwise, all disclosures under Rule 16.1(a) must be in writing, signed, and served.\n\n(b) Early Case Conference; Discovery Plan. Except as otherwise stated in this rule, all parties who have filed a pleading in the action must participate in an early case conference.\n\n(1) Exceptions. Parties are not required to participate in an early case conference if:\n\n(A) the case is exempt from the initial disclosure requirements under Rule 16.1(a)(1)(B);\n\n(B) the case is subject to arbitration under Rule 3(A) of the Nevada Arbitration Rules (NAR) and an exemption from arbitration under NAR 5 has been requested but not decided by the court or the commissioner appointed under NAR 2(c);\n\n(C) the case is in the court-annexed arbitration program;\n\n(D) the case has been through arbitration and the parties have requested a trial de novo under the NAR;\n\n(E) the case is in the short trial program; or\n\n(F) the court has entered an order excusing compliance with this requirement.\n\n(2) Timing.\n\n(A) In General. The early case conference must be held within 30 days after service of an answer by the first answering defendant. All parties who have served initial pleadings must participate in the first case conference. If a new party serves its initial pleading after the first case conference, a supplemental case conference must be held within 30 days after service by any party of a written request for a supplemental conference; otherwise, a supplemental case conference is not required.\n\n(B) Continuances. The parties may agree to continue the time for the early case conference or a supplemental case conference for an additional period of not more than 90 days.
