        "text": "DAVE'S DIARY - 20 NOVEMBER 2003 - RIP SPEEDY WEST\n\nSPEEDY WEST RIP AT 79\n\nBORN JANUARY 25, 1924, - SPRINGFIELD, MISSOURI.\n\nDIED TULSA, OKLAHOMA - NOVEMBER 15, 2003\n\nWESLEY SPEEDY WEST\n\nApproximately 1942, Wesley and Opal moved to Strafford, near Springfield, Missouri, where they lived on the family 200-acre farm.\n\nFarming was vital to the war effort.\n\nOne of their main crops was tomatoes - he also milked up to 33 cows daily.\n\nAfter the war Wesley continued to farm but found more time to play music and develop his skills.\n\nEDDY ARNOLD\n\nIn 1946, a Grand Ole Opry tent show came to Springfield starring Eddy Arnold and Minnie Pearl.\n\nSpeedy, inspired by Arnold's steel guitar player, Little Roy Wiggins, began to play the steel locally on jam sessions broadcast over KWTO radio in Springfield.\n\nA major turning point occurred when a sailor, passing through town, told Wesley about the wonderful musical opportunities available in Southern California.\n\nHe told him he could make as much as $25 a night, which sounded like a gold mine just waiting for him.\n\nOn June 13, 1946, with only $150 in his pocket, Speedy and his wife and their 2-1/2 year old son, Donnie, packed all they could into a 1936 Lincoln Zephyr and headed to Southern California.\n\nDuring the first few months after arriving in Los Angeles, Speedy worked during the day at a drycleaners.\n\nAfter working all day he played steel guitar at night, starting out with a group called the Missouri Wranglers, all part-time musicians, who played a VFW Hall in Southgate.\n\nSPADE COOLEY\n\nSpeedy found a new steel guitar idol - Joaquin Murphy, who played with the Spade Cooley band.\n\nIn the spring of 1948, Spade Cooley - a character in James Ellroy crime novels with a 23-piece western swing band that included a full horn section - hired Speedy.\n\nCooley also hosted the Hoffman Hayride TV variety show, broadcast by KTLA on Saturdays, and played dances.\n\nBut Speedy's job with Cooley lasted only 5 months.\n\nCooley's erratic behaviour caused him to repeatedly fire and then attempt to rehire several band members.\n\nSpeedy chose not to accept being rehired after he fell victim to one of his tirades.\n\nEDDIE KIRK\n\nSpeedy's first recording session was in 1949 with Eddie Kirk who sang \"Candy Kisses\".\n\nSpeedy worked full time doing recording sessions.\n\n6,000 RECORDING SESSIONS\n\nBetween 1950 and 1955, Speedy (with and without Bryant) played on over 6,000 recordings with a total of 177 different artists.\n\nArtists include Frankie Laine, Jo Stafford, and Paul Weston's Orchestra, Billy May's Orchestra, Betty Hutton, Helen O'Connell, Doris Day, Johnnie Ray, Ella Mae Morse, Spike Jones, Jean Shepard, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and many others.\n\nMitch Miller, A&R man for Columbia Records, was so impressed by Speedy's playing on Frankie Laine's 1951 recording of \"Hey Good Lookin\" that he paid him double on that session as well as future sessions.\n\nBOBBY BARE\n\nIn the mid-1950's Speedy helped Bobby Bare get started in show business. He first met him following Bobby's trip to L.A. via hitchhiking and riding rail cars.\n\nBobby presented himself as a songwriter when he came to KXLA radio station.\n\nHe asked Speedy to listen to some songs he had written.\n\nThey both went to Studio B at the station where Bobby sang several songs.\n\nSpeedy told him he should record them himself.\n\nBobby stayed with Speedy for several weeks during which time they went to Bakersfield to record some demo dubs.\n\nSpeedy started promoting them to various record companies. As a result Ken Nelson at Capitol Records signed him up as an artist.\n\nBobby then recorded four songs with Speedy's band on Capitol.\n\nWESTERN MOVIES\n\nIn the early 1950's, Speedy appeared in three Western movies, while still working the daily Hometown show at KXLA and the Saturday night show and dance.\n\nDuring this time he continued to work on recording sessions.\n\nHe also landed a guest spot on Red Foley's ABC-TV show, \"Ozark Jubilee\", from Springfield and a TV show hosted by bandleader Bob Crosby.\n\nHe enjoyed another guest spot on Lawrence Welk's very popular ABC-TV and Dinah Shore's NBC Chevrolet Shows.\n\nFLAMING GUITARS\n\nSpeedy West and Jimmy Bryant first met when playing in different bars on the same street in 1947.\n\nCliffie Stone put them together on his \"Hometown Jamboree\" radio and TV programs for 11 years.\n\nStone also recommended West and Bryant to Capitol where they recorded together until splitting in 1958.\n\nAmong albums were \"Two Guitars Country Style\" in 1954 and \"West of Hawaii\" four years later.\n\nSpeedy and Jimmy's final recording session for Capitol, as a team, was October 9, 1956.\n\nBut Speedy's contract with Capitol was renewed and he continued to record solo until 1962.\n\nWest and Bryant, known as the Flaming Guitars, played on Los Angeles sessions for many artists country and non-country as well as recording five albums on their own.\n\nTheir sound was a healthy hybrid of Texas swing and jazz.\n\nBryant died in 1980 at 55.\n\nA year later, West suffered a stroke, curtailing his performances.\n\nLORETTA LYNN DEBUT\n\nBack in the spring of 1960, Speedy was asked to report to a small studio in L.A. where an unknown singer from Washington and her husband were to arrive to record.\n\nThe singer turned out to be Loretta Lynn and husband, Mooney.\n\nImpressed with her voice, Speedy suggested that they release the musicians in the studio and hire some capable studio pickers and rent a better studio.\n\nHe rounded up some of the Hometown people he had recorded with for years, such as Roy Lanham, Harold Hensley, Roy Harte and Billy Liebert.\n\nSpeedy also suggested that Loretta overdub harmonies on her original song, Honky Tonk Girl, an idea that he borrowed from Patti Page.\n\nSPEEDY DOWN UNDER\n\nIn 1963, the famed Queensland born LeGarde Twins, latter day Nashville residents, invited Speedy to Australia.\n\nWhile here for 44 days Speedy performed on country TV shows, concerts and radio stations.\n\nAlthough not able to play anymore because of a stroke in 1981, Speedy attended various events promoting the steel guitar, such as the annual Steel Guitar conventions in St. Louis, Dallas and Tulsa."
