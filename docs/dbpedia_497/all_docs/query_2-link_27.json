        "text": "Thank you. I knew that Steve was associated with Razor & Tie, and I suspected from the first listen of this compilation that he was the mastering engineer. I know, I could have confirmed my suspicions long ago by reading the notes. Shame on me! Anyhow, I have the second volume of this Razor & Tie set titled \"Swingin' on the Strings\", and it's just as amazing! Speedy West's and Jimmy Bryant's talents amaze and enthrall me to no end! I can put these discs on repeat and dig to them over and over and over, and never tire of them! Steve's mastering of these very vintage recordings is nothing short of superlative, and another fine example of just how talented he is and how amazing the humble compact disc format really is! Anyhow, these two discs are stunningly beautiful!\n\nBy the way, I have the Bear Family single disc release titled \"Bustin' Thru / Flippin' The Lid\", which offers a brief, but well defined and enjoyable overview of the careers of these two stellar jazz guitar musicians. The audio fidelity is not up to par with Steve's work as they are a bit bright and lack some warmth, but the disc is certainly worth having and is a fun listen."
