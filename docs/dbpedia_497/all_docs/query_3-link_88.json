        "text": "Speedy West Ham United Ladies striker Molly Peters is planning to continue her fast start to the season on Sunday.\n\nThe Hammers host Queens Park Rangers in the Women’s Premier League Plate first round at Rush Green at 2pm – a tie that also marks the Ladies’ first-ever Family Fun Day.\n\nWhile the presence of first-team players, a DJ and other activities will add to the occasion from 12noon, Peters is hoping her blistering pace will be the main attraction.\n\n“Before I played football I used to do the 100m sprint and I got so good that I did it competitively for the English schools,” revealed Peters, who is preparing to face Queens Park Rangers in the Women’s Premier League Plate first round at Rush Green on Sunday afternoon.\n\n“When I got into playing football I realised I could combine the two and it’s certainly worked in my favour so far!”\n\nI think the team, in the past few games, have become a family. You have to have that\n\nMolly Peters\n\nIt is not just her blistering pace that has caught the eye so far this season. Peters has impressed her teammates and supporters with a string of fantastic goals – she has four to her name in the Premier League Southern Division already.\n\nEach of the young attacker’s finishes this season have been eye-catching or memorable for different reasons.\n\nAgainst Swindon Town, Peters rounded the goalkeeper to slot home. Against Charlton Athletic, she scored twice – creating one goal all on her own and netting a sensational lobbed effort, the latter of which is her favourite so far.\n\n“The second goal against Charlton was a beautiful goal. I couldn’t believe it had gone in to be honest. I just saw the goalkeeper off her line and decided to have a go.\n\n“When it comes to scoring I usually try to knock it around the goalkeeper with my speed, and then score. Or I’m outside the box and I just need to hit it. So far that approach has been working and I loved the goals I’ve got this season already.”\n\nThere is a certain goal type that Peters does not score too often though, that she really relishes when she gets the chance.\n\n“Obviously I love scoring worldies, but I also really like getting the chance to score headers. Because I’m so short I don’t score many headers, so when I do get them I’m absolutely over the moon!”\n\nWest Ham Ladies will be seeking to bounce back from last weekend’s Capital Women’s Cup defeat at Crystal Palace on Sunday, and Peters is confident the Hammers have the spirit and talent to overcome a QPR side which has just won just once in the league this season.\n\n“I think the team, in the past few games, have become a family. You have to have that. The atmosphere among the girls both in training and on the pitch has been amazing.\n\n“This season is about improvement, both for me personally and the team. I want to keep scoring goals and there’s a few games coming up where I should get the chance to add to my tally.\n\n“We’re playing really well as a group and we want to keep developing. It’s literally all about us improving together.”\n\nWest Ham United Ladies host QPR Ladies at Rush Green on Sunday at 2pm. Gates open for the Family Fun Day at 12noon, with free admission for Season Ticket Holders and Claret Members."
