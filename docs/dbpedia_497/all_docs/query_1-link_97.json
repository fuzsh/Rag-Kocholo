A June 11 covering memorandum from McCone to McGeorge Bundy reads as follows:\n\n“Attached is a memorandum from Dr. Sherman Kent on the ‘doming effect’ in the Far East resulting from loss of South Vietnam and Laos.”\n\n“You will recall the President made inquiry concerning this subject last Saturday. I call your specific attention to numbered paragraph 9, the final paragraph in the memorandum.”\n\nOn another copy of this memorandum, Forrestal wrote the following note: “Mac: This is obvious but good. Might help answer one of the Pres’s questions.”"
