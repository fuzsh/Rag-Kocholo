        "text": "Benjamin Franklin was a Founding Father of the United States and a main protagonist in the series.\n\nHistorical Characterization[]\n\nBenjamin Franklin, b. January 17, 1706, was a Founding Father, inventor, scholar, and printer. He was a patriot who advanced the cause of independence for the colonies. He was an abolitionist and served both as governor, postmaster General for the colonies, and diplomat to France. He became wealthy by printing his paper, the Pennsylvania Gazette, and the well-known book Poor Richard's Almanac. His wife, Deborah Franklin, died in 1775, and he had two children: a patriot daughter, Sarah Franklin Bache, and an illegitimate son he raised with his wife named William Franklin, who became a loyalist and died in England.\n\nSeries Character[]\n\nBenjamin Franklin, called 'Dr. Franklin' by most of the characters, is a main protagonist of the series. James Hiller and Henri Lefebvre work at his print shop for the Pennsylvania Gazette as apprentices, and Sarah Phillips stays with him while waiting for her father to return from the Ohio Territory. He employs Moses, a freed shave, to work at the print shop and writes him a letter certifying his freedom to everyone. Moses keeps it with him at all times. Behaving as a mentor and father figure to the three children, he helps them to understand the issues fueling the Revolutionary War."
