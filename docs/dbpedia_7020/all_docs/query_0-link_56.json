        "text": "Ben Franklin written by Edmund S. Morgan, provides highly detailed information on Benjamin Frankin’s life. Each chapter talks about different times and accomplishments throughout his life. In Chapter one, Morgan provides us with what Franklin did as a kid growing up, and what he was like. Morgan writes, “[...][A] muscular young man, about five feet nine or ten, full of the energies-physical, intellectual, and sexual-of youth...he enjoys a form of exercise that few people of his time dared to try: he swims, and he is good at it,” (Morgan, 2-3). Chapter one provides examples of why I agree the quote. For example, while America was trying to gain its independence, “[...]Franklin was in Paris, winning the alliance that secured American independence,” (Morgan, 27). Franklin was such a popular and influential man that during the revolution, he was sent overseas to Paris to make an alliance. Also, he was a great ruler in the eyes of many, however did not have much of an interest holding public office.…\n\ndelivers a prophecy and blessing to the child that Hagar was carrying (Gen. 16:10-12). Upon hearing the words of the angel, Hagar has a change of character; and instead of submitting to standard social norms she takes initiative of her own and “names” the LORD, the sacred power who spoke to her, El-Roi (Gen. 16:13). Genesis 21 is a continuation of the previous narrative, which adds to the already dramatic tale of Hagar and her son Ishmael. The chasm in the relationship between Sarah and Hagar…\n\nBy faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised (Hebrews 11:11 NKJV). Sarah, wife of Abraham, first mentioned in Genesis 11:29 was 10 years younger than Abraham, and was married to him in Ur of the Chaldeans.(Gen.11:29-31) According to Genesis 20:12, she was Abraham’s half-sister, the daughter of his father, but not of his mother. Marriage with half-sisters was not un-common in…\n\nThe writer is writing for a male elite Israelite audience. Abraham is a man in power with land, cattle, and servants. He is preforming acts of hospitality and serving, what the reader understands to be, The Lord. This shows Abraham as an upright man. The text offers some insight into the culture of the time. Hospitality is regarding highly in the culture. This can be seen in Abraham and Sarah’s response to the strangers. The culture also was dominated by men and women’s roles are assumed…\n\nIt was another pandemonium day locked up in a place where no one wants to be. All I heard was someone yelling my name Sarah Sarah get up you have a phone call All I could smell was bleach and clorox. With the sour taste of my morning breath on my lips, I sluggishly get off my cot, And went to the phone. It was my caseworker. I had asked her what she wanted and she told me that she wanted to talk. I asked her what about and she told me that she would talk to me about it when she got there.…\n\nSarah (originally named Sarai) was one of several women in the Bible who were unable to have children. That proved doubly distressing for her because God had promised her husband Abraham that he would be the father of the Jewish nation, with descendants more numerous than the stars in the sky. After waiting many years, Sarah convinced Abraham to sleep with her handmaiden, Hagar, to produce an heir. That was an accepted practice in ancient times. The child born of that encounter was named…\n\nAs already outlined, the first phase of Fanon’s model is demonstrated in Abram’s journey to Egypt. Abram leaves the land of Haran because there is a severe famine (Genesis 12:10). The Pharaoh does not invite Abram to Egypt. Rather, he goes there, at the command of the Lord, looking to exploit resources because there are none in his country. The second phase materializes in this narrative as Abram and Sarai take Hagar and the other slaves out of Egypt to the land of Canaan. Although Hagar is of…\n\nDiversity in Interpretation.” Her interpretation of the interpersonal relations between Sarah and Hagar being a mirror for human tendency are a notion that I feel is important for my congregation’s context. Society’s stratification of importance based on gender, race, economic status, educational levels, and the like greatly afflict this white, rural context. The conflicts found within this ancient world of women are more universally known than most would care to admit. The fact that God…\n\nThan look more into the character of Isaac Holcombe and see why he is so important to the author. Isaac is significant in Ron Rash’s novel “One Foot in Eden” because he parallels the biblical story of Isaac in the Bible, which also play off Rash’s concern for Nature in Southern Appalachia. Isaac is a significant character in the story “one Foot in Eden” by Ron Rash because he parallels the biblical story of Isaac in the bible. There is a character named Isaac, which can be seen throughout the…\n\nEve, Cain and Abel, Abraham and Sarah, and the list goes on. All of these characters play an important role within the overall story of Genesis. Although all of these characters are crucial to the makeup of Genesis, Abraham may be one of the most influential and crucial characters of the Genesis story. The life of Abraham covers thirteen out of the fifty chapters in the book of Genesis, and Abraham is seen as one of the first prophets within the Bible. God says, “…I will make of you a great…"
