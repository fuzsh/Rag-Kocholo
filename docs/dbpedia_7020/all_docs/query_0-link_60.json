February 27: Franklin moved to Paris suburb of Passy, where he remained during French mission.\n\nFebruary 6: Franklin, on behalf of the United States of America, signed the Treaty of Amity…symbolically, Franklin wore to the signing ceremony same brown velvet suit he had worn when accused by Wedderburn before the Privy Council. June 17: France declared war on Great Britain"
