A committed Whig, she followed Pennsylvania politics and during the American Revolution became active in the Ladies Association of Philadelphia, enthusiastically supporting its relief efforts for American troops. In 1794 her large family moved from Philadelphia to a farm on the Delaware River named âSettleâ (ANB description begins John A. Garraty and Mark C. Carnes, eds., American National Biography, New York and Oxford, 1999, 24 vols. description ends ; Vol. 31:246n).\n\nPhiladelphia native Joseph Clay was the executor of the estate of Benjamin Franklin Bache. In May, Clay had joined William Duane, Thomas Cooper, and other Philadelphia Republicans in recommending William Henderson for the post of naval officer (Richard N. Rosenfeld, American Aurora: A Democratic Republican Returns [New York, 1997], 231; Vol. 30:567n; Thomas Cooper and Others to TJ, 23 May 1801)."
