        "text": "Benjamin Franklin was one of the founders of the United States, but he is also well-known for being an inventor and a statesman.\n\nConsidered to be multitalented, he excelled in writing, politics, music, invention, diplomacy, and science. Franklin was found to be a “Renaissance Man,” influencing local and international events of his time.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBen Franklin was the son of a chandler, which is the profession of making soap and candles, and was born in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nBen was the youngest of sixteen brothers and sisters and had very little formal education.\n\nWhen he was ten years old, he had to abandon school to work with his father and then later became an apprentice to his brother as a printer.\n\nBen loved reading and was somewhat self-taught due to all of the books that he read. When Ben was 17 years old, he ran away and became a printer in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nEarly Career\n\nFranklin made a name for himself in Philadelphia when he became the publisher of the newspaper Pennsylvania Gazette.\n\nHe was intelligent and witty, and it didn’t take long for his reputation to expand throughout the colonies.\n\nIn his early years, he had a few different jobs in London, England, and Philadelphia, and he had useful contacts in London.\n\nAt the beginning of the fight for freedom against the British Ben acted as the Pennsylvania colonist’s voice to the British Parliament.\n\nHe later protested against the Stamp Act of 1765, which imposed taxes on publications. The logical arguments that Franklin gaveled to Parliament repealing the act.\n\nBenjamin Franklin began publishing his famous “Poor Richard’s Almanack” pamphlet in 1732. He wrote under the pseudonym of Richard Saunders, and the pamphlet covered a lot of interesting topics.\n\nBenjamin earned a good living with the sale of the pamphlet for 25 years.\n\nThe Revolutionary War\n\nThe Revolutionary War was close at hand, and although living in London, he came home and suggested that the colonies have a meeting in 1774 that would be the First Continental Congress.\n\nIn 1775 Franklin delivered the petition to King George III of England. Upon his return, Franklin was elected as the delegate from Pennsylvania for the Second Continental Congress, and the Revolutionary War had already started.\n\nFranklin became heavily involved in the political committees of the colonies, with a major role as part of those that wrote the Declaration of Independence.\n\nHe also became the first Postmaster General of the new nation.\n\nTreaty of Paris\n\nWars cost money, and the colonies needed backers to help them fight the British.\n\nBen Franklin went to Europe in 1776, focusing a few years in France to try to get their support for the American Revolution.\n\nBy 1778 France joined the colonies as an ally in the fight, and it proved to be one of the most important actions that led to eventual victory.\n\nBen stayed in France throughout the war and assisted in the negotiations of the war’s end with the Treaty of Paris.\n\nWhat did Benjamin Franklin invent?\n\nBeyond writing, Franklin was an incredible scientist and inventor.\n\nHe is most well-known for his experiments with electricity and the story of the “kite,” but he invented a lot of things that we take for granted today.\n\nIt was Ben that invented bifocal glasses, a carriage odometer, the Franklin stove, and the glass harmonica.\n\nHis fascination with science led to discoveries in the fields of cooling, printing, electricity, meteorology, and the wave theory of light.\n\nBen Franklin’s love of reading led him to start the first library in America. He also founded the first fire department.\n\nLater Life\n\nOnce Franklin came home from France in 1785, he was a participant in the Constitutional Convention.\n\nHe was the only founder to sign the Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of Alliance with France, the Treaty of Paris, and the Constitution.\n\nHis only major political role with a title was when he served as a kind of governor of Pennsylvania. Franklin died in 1790 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nFacts about Benjamin Franklin\n\nHe was born January 17, 1706, in Boston, Massachusetts\n\nHe was the tenth son Josiah Franklin\n\nHis father could not afford to send him to school; he stopped going to school at ten years old.\n\nWhen he was 17, he left Boston and worked as a printer in Philadelphia\n\nHe conducted scientific experiments and invented the lightning rod, bifocal eyeglasses, Franklin stove, and the glass harmonica, a musical instrument.\n\nBenjamin Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States\n\nHe helped to create the foundation of the Articles of Confederation, which later became the first constitution of the United States in 1781.\n\nIn 1776, Franklin was one of the five members of the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence,\n\nHe died April 17, 1790, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nWhat did you learn?\n\nWhat talents to Benjamin Franklin have throughout his life?\n\nScientist, printer, writer, politics, music, inventor, diplomat\n\nHow did Benjamin Franklin receive his education?\n\nSelf-taught through reading\n\nWhat was Franklin’s first job as a teenager?\n\nPrinter’s apprentice\n\nWhat law did Franklin convince the British Parliament to repeal?\n\nThe Stamps Act\n\nBenjamin Franklin used his negotiating skills to convince what country to join as an ally to the colonies to fight the British?\n\nFrance\n\nFranklin is most well-known for signing what document that led to the development of freedom?\n\nDeclaration of Independence"
