Enter from Market Street or Chestnut Street, between 3rd and 4th Streets.\n\nAlthough this area was preserved to remember and honor Benjamin Franklin, the house that once stood in Franklin Court speaks to the women who called it their home. Franklin's wife Deborah oversaw the construction of the house while Benjamin was in London. Daughter Sarah (Sally) Franklin Bache and her husband Richard raised their eight children in this house during Benjamin's mission to France. Franklin's grandchildren demolished the house in 1812 to allow for commercial development. Only the foundations of the large and elegant house remain, outlined at present by a modern steel \"ghost\" structure. The courtyard is now home to the Benjamin Franklin Museum, the Franklin Court Printing Office, the \"Fragments of Franklin Court\" exhibit and the B. Free Franklin Post Office."
