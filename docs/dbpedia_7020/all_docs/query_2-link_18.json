        "text": "Decision analysis: key concepts and symbols\n\nA decision tree can be used to analyse Franklin's choice (fig 1 and table 1 ). The square box is a choice node. The box refers to a decision and decision maker. In this case Franklin's choice is to inoculate his son or not. Branches to the right indicate the two choices. The circles are chance nodes. Each circle indicates the consequences of a choice which have a probability of occurrence. There are two such uncertain consequences of this decision: The probability of infection and the probability of living or dying. Chance nodes have probabilities attached to each branch to the right of the chance node. These probabilities must add up to 1.00.\n\nFigure 1 Smallpox, Boston 1721: population 10 700. Decision tree: inoculate or not.\n\nPath namePath probabilityNumber of peopleInoculate and live0.979281Inoculate and die0.0216No inoculation, infected and live(x)(0.854)4917No inoculation, infected and die(x)(0.146)842No inoculation, not infected and live(1–x)4654Total population10 700\n\nIn 1721, 287 people were inoculated by Boylston. Of these, 281 lived (281/287 = 0.979) and six died (6/287 = 0.021). Thus, the two probabilities associated with the inoculation chance node add up to 1.00 (0.979 + 0.021 = 1.00)\n\nBranches in sequence are “paths”. Each path has an “outcome” associated with it. Paths have probabilities of occurring, which are obtained by multiplying the branch probabilities together. The upper branch (inoculate) probabilities we know from the data. The lower branch (do not inoculate) has two chance nodes. The first is the probability of infection in the natural way without inoculation. We start off by deciding we do not know what this probability is. So we call it x which can range in value from 0 (no chance of infection) to 1.00 (certainty of infection.) By the rules of decision analysis we know that if the probability of infection is x then the probability of not being infected is 1–x (x plus 1–x adds up to 1).\n\nThe larger the value of x the better inoculation looks as a choice. This decision tree has three paths to the right of the choice to do nothing. The probabilities associated with these paths are obtained by multiplying the probabilities along the path (table 2 ). These probabilities add to 1.00. The path probabilities to the right of each choice node add to 1.00. Outcomes are numerical and are associated with each path. In this case “live” is given the value of 1 and “death” is given the value of 0. More complex medical decisions relate to quality of life, different life expectancies and costs.\n\nPath namePath probabilitiesInfected and live(x)(0.854)Infected and die(x)(0.146)Not infected(1–x)Sum1.00\n\nWhat should Franklin do with that unknown x?\n\nTwo possibilities come to mind. The Boston population figures shown in fig 1 allows us to make an estimate of the probability of being infected without inoculation, (4917+842)/(4654+4917+842) = 0.553. The probability of being infected in the natural way in Boston in 1721 was 0.553. If we give x this value we can give Franklin an answer. This is done by multiplying the path probabilities by the outcomes and adding these up for each choice to compare them. For the inoculation choice this is (0.979×1) + (0.021×0) = 0.979. This expected value is the same as the probability of surviving this treatment. What about the do nothing choice where x is replaced by 0.553? The expected value of the “do nothing” choice is 0.919 (table 3 ), which is less than the expected value of inoculation (0.979).\n\nPath namesPath probabilities times outcomesDo nothing, infected, live(0.553)(0.854)(1) = 0.472Do nothing, infected, death(0.553)(0.146)(0) = 0. 0Do nothing, not infected(1−0.553)(1) = 0.447Expected value of do nothing0.919\n\nThe rule in decision analysis is, if the tree structure, probabilities and outcomes are correct, the choice should be made which has the best expected value, in this case—inoculation. If you have followed us this far, we hear you saying “now wait a minute”. From your list of concerns, let us pick one. The probability of being infected of 0.553 is not realistic. Of the 4654 Bostonians who were not infected many of them were not infected because they were not at risk, having had smallpox in the past and survived. This is information we would like to have, but cannot and can never know. So what should we do? We can do two things, which come under the broad heading of sensitivity analysis.\n\nThis bias in our data implies that for Bostonians without exposure to smallpox, the risk of becoming infected in the natural way was greater than 55.3%. The greater the risk of infection above 55.3%, the better and better inoculation looks as a choice. So this bias will not change our decision and, therefore, we can still choose inoculation.\n\nThe other approach is to ask how low does the probability of infection have to be to give these two choices equal expected values? Knowing this probability will give us the “indifference point” where the expected values are the same. This probability can be found with a bit of algebra. Set the two expected outcomes equal to each other and solve for x (see table 4 ).\n\nExpected survival with inoculationExpected survival—do nothing0.979 = (x)(0.854)(1) + (x)(0.146)(0) + (1−x)(1)0.979 = (0.854)(x) + (1–x)x–(0.854)(x) = 1−0.979(0.146)(x) = 0.021x = 0.021/0.146x = 0.144\n\nIf the probability of becoming infected in the natural way is less than 0.144 then it is best to do nothing. If the probability is greater than 0.144 then inoculation is a better choice. Now wait just another minute—your analysis assumes just two choices. Are there other choices? Actually there were: “head for the hills” or leave town. Data on this choice are reported for the Boston smallpox epidemic of 1752; too late for Franklin's 1736 decision (fig 2 and table 5 ). In 1752 Boston was a bigger town with 15 684 people of whom 5998 were recorded as immune to smallpox. Thus 9686 Bostonians were at risk of infection. They made one of three choices, inoculation, do nothing or leave town:\n\nFigure 2 Smallpox, Boston 1752: population 15 684. The decision tree: inoculate, do nothing or leave town.\n\nPath namePath probabilitiesOutcomesNumber of peopleInoculate and live(0.986)12094Inoculate and die(0.014)030Do nothing infected and live(0.97)(0.903)15006Do nothing infected and die(0.97)(0.097)0539Do nothing NOT infected and live(0.03)1174Left town infected and live(y)(0.903)11762Left town infected and die(y)(0.097)026Left town not infected and live(1−y)155Not at risk of infection, immune5998Total population15 684\n\n2124 people chose inoculation of whom 30 died (0.014);\n\n5719 people chose to do nothing. Of these 97% were infected and 539 died;\n\n1843 left town to escape infection in the more isolated countryside. We do not know how many of these people died.5\n\nNote that in 1721, 2.7% of the total population took inoculation. In 1752, 13.5% of the total population and 21.9% of the at‐risk population chose inoculation, showing a slowly greater public acceptance of this beneficial treatment. More inoculated, and therefore infectious, people could have increased the risk of infection for the do nothing group. We can calculate the expected values in 1752. The probability of surviving inoculation was 0.986. For at‐risk people, doing nothing led to a high risk of infection (0.97) and an expected outcome of (1)(0.903)(0.97) + (0)(0.097)(0.97) + (1)(0.03) = 0.906.\n\nInoculation with its higher survival rate is the better choice between these two. What about the “leaving town” choice? To be worth choosing, it should have a better survival rate than the 0.986 resulting from inoculation. All we know about the “leave town” group is that 1843 susceptible people made this choice. For this choice to be better than inoculation with its 98.6% survival, there would have to be fewer than 26 deaths in this group of 1843 people. This is 26/1843 = 0.0141 mortality compared to the inoculation mortality of 0.014. We do not know the probability of becoming infected in the leave town group. Therefore we give it a value of y. If the value of y is low enough, leave town could be the best choice. What value of y would make us indifferent between the leave town, and the next best choice, which is inoculation? We can find this out by setting the two expected outcomes equal to each other and solving for y (table 6 ).\n\nExpected value of leaving town = (probability of living)Expected value of inoculation (probability of living)(y)(0.903)(1) + (y)(0.097)(0) + (1−y)(1) = 0.986(y)(0.903) + 1 − (y) = 0.986y = 0.144\n\nIf the probability of being infected is less than 14.4% the best choice is to leave town. If the probability of being infected is greater than 14.4%, inoculation is the best choice. This probability of infection times the mortality times the number of Bostonians' who left town ((0.144)(0.097)(1843)) equals 25.7, just below the 26 deaths that makes this our preferred choice in the short run. Short run, because these people will continue to be at risk when the next epidemic comes in 1764, when they will have to choose again.\n\nYou now know the basic ideas of clinical decision analysis. It can be seen as the logic of medical decision making. Decision analysis was developed by Howard Raiffa8 and others in the 1960s. It was applied to real clinical problems in the 1970s in two books Clinical decision analysis9 and Costs, risks and benefits of surgery,10 and in an entire issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.11 There is now an active Society for Medical Decision Making with its own journal Medical Decision Making."
