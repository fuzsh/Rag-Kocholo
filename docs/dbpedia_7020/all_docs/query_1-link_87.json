In 1767 she married Richard Bache and they had eight children.\n\nShe was a patriot during the American Revolution and was political hostess to her father at that time. In 1780 she became the leader of the Ladies Association of Philadelphia that made shirts for the soldiers.\n\nShe was a fine harpischordist and loved reading. From her father she inherited a small but valuable portrait of Louis XVI that she sold in London. In 1794 she moved with her family from Philadelphia to a location on the Delaware River. She died in 1808 and was buried at Christ Church Burial Grounds in Philadelphia next to her father.\n\nFamily\n\nÂ• Father: Franklin, Benjamin"
