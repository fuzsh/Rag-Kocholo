        "text": "ðŸ”º The son of Founding Father Benjamin Franklin was NJ's 13th governor\n\nðŸ”º William Franklin wanted NJ to remain loyal to the crown\n\nðŸ”º He served as a British spy when war broke out\n\nIâ€™ve been enjoying Apple TVâ€™s new mini-series titled â€˜Franklin,â€™ which tells the story of Founding Father Benjamin Franklinâ€™s secret mission to enlist Franceâ€™s help defeating the British.\n\nItâ€™s based on Stacy Schiffâ€™s book: A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France and the Birth of America.\n\nThe United States is losing the war with Britain. Franklin is dispatched to try and get money, ships and arms from France to turn the tide. He is accompanied on this journey by his grandson, Temple.\n\nTemple has become a ward of Franklin because his father, William, is in prison.\n\nAnd that is the New Jersey connection.\n\nThe last Royal Governor of New Jersey\n\nWilliam Franklin was the product of an acknowledged extramarital affair, but lived with his father Benjamin and his wife Deborah Read in Philadelphia.\n\nIn the early years, father and son were close. William helped his father with the famed kite experiment that helped lead to the harnessing of electricity.\n\nHe achieved the rank of Captain in the provincial military and went on to be an accomplished lawyer who was extremely loyal to the British Crown.\n\nIn 1763 King George appointed William to serve as Governor of New Jersey.\n\nFranklin was popular, until he wasnâ€™t\n\nGov. Franklin was popular in New Jersey during the early part of his term. He proved to be capable and responsive to the colonial residents of the state.\n\nAs pro-colonists efforts began, Franklin was even an early supporter.\n\nWhen America declared its independence, Benjamin Franklin expected his son would join the revolution.\n\nHe did not.\n\nGov. Franklin delivered an impassioned speech to the New Jersey legislature in 1775 urging the colony to declare loyalty to King George and on a path to prosperity.\n\nThe legislature rejected the idea and unanimously voted to support revolting colonists in Boston.\n\nGov. Franklin remained loyal to King George when colonists took up arms in the War of Independence.\n\nHe was a spy\n\nDuring his waning time in office, Franklin secretly reported Patriot activity to the British.\n\nWhen one of his communications was intercepted, Gov. Franklin was arrested and imprisoned in Connecticut.\n\nBy this time, his famous father had disowned him and taken custody of the Governors son.\n\nHe fought against America\n\nIn 1778, the former-Gov. Franklin was released to the British in a prisoner exchange.\n\nBased in New York City, Franklin spent the next fours years involved in both overt and covert operations aimed at helping Britain win the war with America\n\nHis intelligence activities and knowledge of Patriot operations were highly valued by the British military.\n\nWhat happened to Franklin when the war ended?\n\nAfter the British surrendered at Yorktown, William Franklin sailed for England.\n\nHe lived the remainder of his days in London, where he died in 1813.\n\nIn the years before his death, he attempted to reestablish relationships with his father and his son.\n\nBoth Benjamin and Temple Franklin wanted nothing to do with him and he died without ever speaking to them again."
