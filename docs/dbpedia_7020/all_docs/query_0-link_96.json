Â The following evaluation criteria is included during the Spouse of the Year board selection process:\n\nSpouses who provide outstanding examples of volunteerism in support of Army HR / personnel programs in terms of highly successful mission accomplishment.\n\nSpouses who have an established a pattern of excellence, as recognized by previous accomplishments (e.g, Commanderâs Award, Community Recognition).\n\nSpouses who have demonstrated community involvement with linkages to DoD, DA, Army, AG Corps, or local community.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Esther De Berdt Reed AG Corps Spouse of the Year Award is established to annually recognize the contributions of AG Corps or Army HR spouses or widows. Â The award is named in honor of Esther De Berdt Reed, wife of COL Joseph Reed, the second Adjutant General of the US Army.\n\nEsther De Berdt Reed epitomized the best qualities of an AG Corps spouse who placed service to the Continental Army and Americaâs first Soldiers during the American Revolutionary War above all else.\n\nEsther De Berdt Reed built and led the largest womenâs organization of the American Revolution. Â After the news of the battles of Lexington and Concord, her husband (Joseph Reed) was summoned to join General George Washington as an aide and military secretary. Â Life was uncertain and dangerous, as it was for countless other women whose husbands joined in the Revolution against the British Crown.\n\nIn the fall of 1778, when the American Revolution had been underway for two years, Joseph Reed won election as Governor of Pennsylvania. Â Esther used this elevated position to show her patriotism by forming the Ladies of Philadelphia, an organization through which women could raise funds to assist General Washingtonâs Army. Â The Ladies of Philadelphia, headed by Esther, worked to raise the incredible amount of three hundred thousand continental (paper) dollars, or approximately seventy-five hundred dollars in specie (precious metal coin) by walking door to door requesting donations from over 1,600 contributors. Â This amount of money was extraordinary for this time in American history.\n\nEsther de Berdt Reed did not live to see her efforts fully realized. Â She died on September 18, 1780, at the young age of 34. Â Sarah Franklin Bache, the daughter of Benjamin Franklin, took over Estherâs position and finished the patriotic project. Â Although she did not see the project finished, Estherâs efforts did not go unacknowledged. Â All of Philadelphia mourned her early death, and a moving obituary praised Esther for her efforts and patriotism.\n\nCost\n\nTo be borne by the Adjutant Generalâs Corps Regimental Association.\n\nRecommending Procedures\n\nDetailed recommending procedures and all criteria for the Esther De Berdt Reed Spouse of the Year Award are found in the annual AG Corps Awards Program MOI. Â The MOI is normally distributed to major Army command headquarters and S1Net on or about in late summer of each year. Â Nomination packets are normally required to be submitted to the AG School at Fort Jackson, SC by February 1st of the following year (see MOI to confirm actual suspense date). Â Additionally, contact the AG School Operations Division, (803) 751-8300, if you need a copy of the MOI.\n\nApproval Process and Announcement\n\nThe Chief of the Adjutant Generalâs Corps, or his/her representative, will appoint board members to select the AG Corps Spouse of the Year from the nominations received from the field. Â The Chief of the Corps will notify the winner, the winnerâs chain of command, AGCRA, and provide an Army-wide announcement.\n\nPresentation\n\nThe winner will be presented the Esther De Berdt Reed Spouse of the Year Award during the Adjutant Generalâs Corps National Ball at Columbia, SC. Â All travel costs for the winner will be borne by the winning spouse or widow. Â The winnerâs photo will be displayed at the Adjutant General School and the winnerâs name will be added to the AG Corps Spouse of the Year plaque hanging in the AG Corps Hall of Honor.
