        "text": "When I was a child, my mother and I had a few ‘mother/daughter’ outfits—dresses that were similar and/or the same, but sized accordingly. While it was fun to have these matching clothes, wouldn’t it be more illuminating to have ‘mother/daughter’ books, so they could be read simultaneously? Perhaps Cokie Roberts had this in mind when she wrote the newly published children’s book, Founding Mothers: Remembering the Ladies.\n\nIn 2004, Roberts published the ‘adult’ version, Founding Mothers: The Women Who Raised Our Nation. Her book masterfully documents the women behind the men. She traces the forming of America, chronologically from British colonies to the newly established democracy, through the roles of women, both known and unknown —Deborah Reade Franklin, Mary Otis Warren, Abigail Smith Adams, Sarah Franklin Bache, Sarah Livingston Jay, Mary White Morris, Phyllis Wheatley, and Martha Washington—to name just a few.\n\nWhy, one wonders, is it still necessary to write a ‘children’s’ version in today’s world? Roberts states in her NPR interview with Steve Inskeep:\n\n“The National Archives are the closest thing we have to a cathedral of the country. There are these fabulous murals up on the walls above the Constitution, the Declaration and the Bill of Rights. And they’re all white men in white wigs with tights, and I don’t think they’re recognizable to a lot of Americans. But they weren’t the only people who did it. They were incredibly important — I’m not taking anything away from our Founding Fathers — but they didn’t do it alone.”\n\nSpies, activists, poets, writers, postmasters, printers, cannon operators, farmers shopkeepers, cooks—these are a few of the jobs held by women during colonial times, and without their work, Roberts rightly asserts, the revolution would not have been successful. Stories need to be told and re-told, and women’s history especially, and thus one finds Roberts’ distillation of these revolutionary women an act of beneficent wisdom. Of course, a book for young girls needs to be accompanied by illustrations, and the pages are graced by the masterful pen and watercolors of Diane Goode. For an insight into her working methods—translating both facts and images into illustrations–please refer to a photographic documentation on her website.\n\nVenture forth to your local book store, purchase a copy of Founding Mothers: Remembering the Ladies, then pull your copy of Founding Mothers: The Women Who Raised Our Nation off your bookshelf and invite your daughter or granddaughter to sit on the couch for a read-along. You don’t have to be wearing similar clothes, but it may help.\n\nRemember the Ladies, indeed.\n\nWith the next polar vortex bearing down on us, it is time to gather one’s warmest clothes and prepare to bundle up for the daily chores—fire stoking, chicken feeding, wood chopping, egg gathering. What did the women of yore wear in the bitter winter?\n\nRecently, I saw a painting of Mrs. Richard Bache (Sarah Franklin, 1743-1808–Ben Franklin’s daughter) wearing a crisscrossed shawl and it occurred to me that shawls for women were the equivalent of waistcoats for men.\n\nA shawl—a very large triangle—worn over the shoulders and crossed over the chest, can be tied in the back. The shawl is now secure and one does not have to concentrate on holding it closed or worrying about it falling off. Thus, one is able to move about freely and accomplish needed tasks. Furthermore, the trunk of the body is warm, just as if one was wearing a modern day vest.\n\nIn the recent movie, Camille Claudel 1915, Camille (played by Juliette Binoche) wears a very large shawl, and throughout the movie, the shawl takes on many uses—as a large scarf bundled around her neck, as a shawl draped over the shoulders, and as a ‘waistcoat’ wrapped and tied around her waist. In contrast, the character Griet, in the movie Girl with a Pearl Earring, merely drapes her shawl around her and holds it closed with her arms, thus not allowing the body freedom of movement.\n\nAfter seeing Juliette wrap, drape and enfold her body with her knitted shawl, I decided to make one. I discussed this with one of my colleagues and fellow knitters, and there was a twinkle in her eye. The next day she brought me the perfect pattern—‘A Sensible Shawl’ by Celeste Young. My shawl, finished just in time for the last polar vortex, has been keeping me warm as I move through the day’s chores and at night whilst I am knitting socks or stitching my Alabama Chanin DIY swing skirt.\n\nWrap up and keep warm.\n\nMrs. Richard Bache, 1793, by John Hopper (British, 1758-1810), oil on canvas, The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJust a few weeks ago, the hills were covered in snow and it was bitterly cold. Yesterday dawned chilly with the thermometer reading 26. The world was shrouded in white; not snow, but a chalky fog and all surfaces thinly coated with glistening ice. The sun burned away the fog and ice, and the mercury quickly rose to the mid-40s.\n\nM has been worried about the bees with the odd weather –hot, cold, hot; wet, and more wet—the sudden damp shifts are quite difficult for a hive as it makes it more difficult to regulate interior temperatures. In the winter months, the bees stay inside and do not venture out, but rather cluster around the Queen to keep her warm. Having said that, bees like to do housekeeping, and on a warm day in January, one can see them leaving the hive, carrying out waste. Around noon, with the sun shining directly on the hive, M and I wandered over to see if there was any activity. The hive was all abuzz with many bees flying around the entrance. One of the bees even buzzed by our heads, perhaps to give us a greeting. Hooray! A very welcome sign to see the bees alive and hard at work, taking advantage of the warm winter’s day. Thank you, Mother Nature, for rendering a perfect day for us to check in on the bees.\n\nToday, however, snow flurries and a very gray sky are on hand, and the hive from the outside is quiet, but we now know that it is humming with activity inside.\n\nAs the New Year dawns, it seems appropriate to look back as well as forward.\n\nMartha Ballard, midwife, January 1, 1796, living in Hallowell, ME:\n\n“Clear and Pleasant. I washt and washt my kitchen. Was Calld at 9 hour Evening to see the wife of Capt Moses Springer who is not so well as Shee Could wish. Her husband is gone a trip to Boston. I tarried there all night. Slept some after 1 o Clock.”\n\nAbigail May Alcott, mother of Louisa May Alcott, January 1, 1877, Concord, MA:\n\n“……..Brilliant, beautiful day. The year comes in festively; its gorgeous drapery of clouds of many colors. Not cold. I sew a little for Louisa. Freddy played the piano last night, the last tune, “America,” ushers in the New Year with his favorite waltz (Star). We rake a sleigh-ride, call at Mrs. Pratt’s.”\n\nMargaret Dow Gebby, farmwife, January 1, 1891, Bellefontaine, OH:\n\n“A very wet day. Orra and George made each a key for the P.O. but Georges did not open the lock. Jerry was at the farm this morning, everything all right, went to town this P.M. paid the taxes $240.22, got bank div $140. I swept and dusted the house all over to day.”\n\n[Note: Virginia McCormick, editor of Gebby’s diary, points out that a century ago New Year’s Day was not always a holiday, and that it was business as usual for merchants, bankers and government workers.]\n\nAt our home today, it dawns crisp, 12 degrees with ribbons of mauve clouds in the sky. A snowstorm is predicted for the Berkshire hills in the next few days, accompanied by howling winds and frigid temperatures.\n\nThe weather is a constant. A grounding for each woman–Martha, Abigail and Margaret–began by noting the climatic conditions. Likewise, for the past six years, I have opened my ledger, every morning, and recorded the temperature. Often, I will note events of the day—the coming of mud season, the planting of onions, the harvesting of the garlick crop, the starting of the wood furnace, and, happily, the day the first puce points of the skunk cabbage open in the bogs: the harbingers of spring.\n\nLaurel Thatcher Ulrich, A Midwife’s Tale: the life of Martha Ballard, based on her diary, 1785-1812, (Vintage Books, 1990), p .205.\n\nMy Heart is Boundless Writing os Abigail May Alcott, Louisa’s Mother, edited by Eve LaPlante, (Free Press, 2012), p. 216.\n\nFarm Wife A Self-Portrait, 1886-1896, edited by Virginia E.
