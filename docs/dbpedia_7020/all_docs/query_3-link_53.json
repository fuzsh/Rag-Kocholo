        "text": "Writer, scientist, inventor, statesman, diplomat, printer, publisher and political philosopher--Benjamin Franklin, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, was all of these and more. As a Patriot, he endured a split with his son, a Loyalist. His diplomacy helped win America's independence, and it was he, as much as any, who shaped what America would become.\n\nThis is another in the many historical recollections we're providing leading up to America's 250th birthday in 2026. They are provided by members of the DAR and SAR, and this one was compiled by Jennifer Baker of the DAR Vesuvius Furnace Chapter.\n\nBenjamin Franklin is one of the most well-known and well-written founding fathers. He also led a very colorful and unconventional life – even by modern standards.\n\nHe had what would now be known as a common-law wife named Deborah Read with whom he fathered children and is known to have other “illegitimate” children. Franklin’s common-law marriage to Deborah Read was likely built more on convenience than love. He didn't seem especially attracted to her, and once even compared her body to a beer mug. Some historians believe that Franklin married her just so he’d have someone to take out his sexual energies on. He cheated on her openly throughout their 44-year marriage, 18 years of which were spent living apart. Deborah suffered a stroke while her husband was overseas. Franklin didn’t return to Philadelphia to see her, and she passed away alone in 1774.\n\nFranklin was also a known womanizer and openly admitted to “intrigues with low women” and wrote a cheeky piece of “Advice to a young man on the choice of a mistress.” In it, he argued that older women make the best companions. \"In all your Amours, you should prefer old Women to young ones,\" he wrote. He also wrote, \"The Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement.\" According to Franklin, older women are \"so grateful.\"\n\nFranklin publicly promoted a life of upstanding morality and virtues, as seen in his Poor Richard’s Almanack. In his autobiography, he described 13 virtues every decent man should live by, noting that men should \"rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another’s peace or reputation.\" Privately, he allegedly did no such thing. Indeed, Franklin’s famous thirteen-step plan for moral perfection was most notable in its failure, and he “was surpris’d to find myself so much fuller of Faults than I had imagined.” Nevertheless, Franklin insisted that moral management began with eating and drinking…\n\nFranklin employed common eighteenth-century stereotypes that portrayed religious difference as a sign of sexual deviance. Franklin illustrated the difference in the story in which he lampooned Samuel Keimer, his “piggish” and pious Philadelphia employer. Even though Franklin separated temperance from chastity in his own list of virtues, he mocked Keimer’s religious practices by sexualizing his dietary lusts.\n\nWhen Franklin first moved to London in 1724, he was a regular at the city’s parlors. That same year, Franklin went to London with his friend, a poet named James Ralph. The two soon had a falling out. Franklin had made a sexual advance on Ralph’s mistress. Furious, Ralph ended the friendship and refused to pay Franklin the 27 pounds he owed him.\n\nThis habit of visiting “parlors” was something that he kept up into the later years of his life. At night, he would always be seen at a pub in the company of women. \"In his morning litany he could pray to be kept from lasciviousness, but when night came lust might come with it,\" wrote biographer Carl Van Doren. \"He went to women hungrily, secretly and briefly.\"\n\nOne of Franklin's illegitimate children is well accounted for. In 1731, a year into Franklin’s marriage with Deborah Read, he had a son with one of his mistresses. Some historians believe the mother of the child was a woman named Barbara, a maid in Franklin’s house. Deborah accepted the child, William Franklin, into her home and raised him as her stepson. William grew up to be a political figure in his own right, becoming the governor of New Jersey. Deborah and Franklin also had two children of their own, a son who passed away at the age of five due to smallpox, and a daughter named Sally, who lived into her sixties. Some historians, like Thomas A Foster, author of Sex and the Founding Fathers: The American Quest for a Relatable Past, think Franklin may have fathered 15 illegitimate children in his life; however, historians can't confirm any other details about his potential offspring.\n\nYet it is Franklin's account of breaking his vegetarian diet after being seduced by the smell of frying cod that reveals a great deal about how he encouraged readers to govern bodily desires for food and sex. Even as he joked, Franklin insisted that reasonably managing desires was more useful than dogmatically denying them altogether. Franklin was not simply advocating an early form of sexual liberation; instead, he sought to make bodies better instruments for secular civil society, capitalist economies, and republican governments by demonstrating that bodies need not be pure, but well-managed.\n\nClose readings of Franklin’s Autobiography are particularly useful for understanding his vision for public morality, since shaping young Americans was an explicit aim of his text. To justify publishing his memoirs, Franklin quoted friends who insisted that his “little private incidents” would serve as “a sort of key to life” that could teach “business, frugality, and temperance with the American youth,” and might even “bette[r] the whole race of men.” Carefully crafting his tale, the aging printer sought to shape American society by recounting the adventures of a young Ben Franklin, who got into his own scrapes with food and sex.\n\nFranklin had a reputation for having a strong libido, even as he grew old. In 1754, when Franklin was 48, he met 23-year-old Catherine Ray. He tried to make a move on her, but she refused. However, the two kept up a correspondence, and Franklin attempted to entice her into a relationship for a while. In fact, Franklin penned hundreds of love letters to his current and previous lovers, many of which have survived, giving historians a glimpse into the often-dirty mind of this great American founding father. His letters contained reminiscences of past encounters, details of Franklin's plans for future encounters, and naughty poems and verses.\n\nWhile Franklin was in London from 1757-75, some historians believe he was a member of the Medmenham Monks, also known as the Hell Fire Club. This was a group of libertine men who were known for their perverse sexual proclivities and their rejection of religious constraints. While his actual membership cannot be confirmed or denied, historians point out Franklin had close friendships with some of the club’s most notorious members, including its founder, Francis Dashwood.\n\nIn 1757, Franklin moved into an apartment in a London building owned by a widow named Margaret Stevenson. Margaret also lived there with her 18-year-old daughter, Polly. Some historians think Margaret and Franklin may have had an affair over the 15 years he lived under her roof. Others think Franklin may have tried to spark up a romance with Polly as well. He was reportedly fond of Polly, and he kept up a long correspondence with her. In his final years, he even had the widowed Polly move to Philadelphia to be by his side until his death in 1790.\n\nThere was another incident in London in 1767, where Franklin’s friend Charles Wilson Peale went to visit Franklin's apartment. He opened the door and saw then 61-year-old Franklin kissing and fondling a young girl who was sitting on his lap. There was even a little quip about Franklin’s taste for young women as he aged: \"Franklin, tho’ plagued with fumbling age/Needs nothing to excite him/But is too ready to engage/When younger arms invite him.\"\n\nFranklin arrived in Paris in 1776 just as he turned 70. The United States had just become a nation, and he had been sent over to serve as its commissioner to France. While he was there, even in his advanced years, he still charmed plenty of women at one ceremony, he was honored by 300 French women, who honored him by placing a crown of laurels on his head and kissing both his cheeks.\n\nHis sex drive likely didn’t wane, either. A young composer and musician, Anne-Louise d'Hardancourt Brillon de Jouy, caught his eye and he tried to seduce her, with no luck — she affectionately referred to him as \"Cher Papa.\" Franklin then fell for and courted a rich noble widow named Madame Helvetius. She had an estate in the French countryside, where Franklin got very comfortable in the company of her and her guests. Franklin even proposed marriage to Madame Helvetius, but she turned him down.\n\nAfter living a life of debauchery and sexual excess, Franklin may have come to regret his promiscuous past. In his autobiography, he wrote, \"That hard-to-be-governed passion of youth had hurried me frequently into intrigues with low women that fell in my way.\""
