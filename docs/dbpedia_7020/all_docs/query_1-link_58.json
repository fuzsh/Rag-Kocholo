        "text": "Sarah Franklin “Sally” Bache (September 11, 1744 – October 5, 1808) was the daughter of Benjamin Franklin and Deborah Read. She was a leader in relief work during the American Revolutionary War and frequently served as her father’s political hostess, as her mother had died in 1774.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nBorn Sarah Franklin and known as “Sally” throughout her life, she was the only surviving child of her parents, Deborah Read and Benjamin Franklin. Their son Francis Franklin died of smallpox at age four. Also in their household was her older half-brother William Franklin, her father’s illegitimate son whom her parents raised from infancy. She was carefully educated by her father about political life.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n\nSally married Richard Bache on October 29, 1767, although her family was worried about his financial position. The couple had eight children together:\n\n* Benjamin Franklin Bache (b. 1769, d. 1798 during the Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic of 1798.), a publisher, he was jailed and awaiting trial under the Sedition Act.

He was a Lt. Col. in the Pennsylvania State Militia Volunteers during the War of 1812. Assigned by Pennsylvania Gov. Snyder to defend the City of Philadelphia against the British.\n\n* Deborah Franklin Bache (1 October 1781 – ?) married William J.

She did extensive relief work. After her father’s return in 1775 from a diplomatic mission to France, she frequently acted as his political hostess, as her mother had died in 1774.\n\nShe raised money for the Continental Army and is known for her involvement in the Ladies Association of Philadelphia. In 1780, under her leadership, the group made 2,200 shirts for the soldiers in the Continental Army at the army’s winter quarters at Valley Forge. The women often met to work together at The Cliffs, a country estate owned by Samuel R. Fisher on the Schuylkill River, two miles north of Philadelphia.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nBache loved music and reading, and was considered a skilled harpsichordist. When her father died in 1790, he left most of his estate to her. Among the items bequeathed to her was a small portrait of Louis XVI surrounded by diamonds, which she sold to finance a trip to London. In 1794, she and her family moved to a farm outside Philadelphia, to the north along the Delaware River.\n\nSarah Franklin Bache died in 1808 and is buried in Christ Church Burial Ground, Philadelphia.\n\nSource(s): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Franklin_Bache"
