The West Coast Conference announced its 2013-14 men's basketball conference schedule on Tuesday, featuring 10 teams for the first time in league history. The race for the WCC regular season crown will be contested over a 10-week span, and consist of a double round-robin format. Conference play is slated to begin on Saturday, December 28, and will culminate on March 1, 2014.

Anticipation for this season's WCC conference battle is extremely high after a 2012-13 campaign that saw Gonzaga being ranked No. 1 in the nation, Saint Mary's securing its sixth straight postseason berth, BYU reaching the NIT semifinals, and Santa Clara winning the CBI postseason tournament. Additionally, those four teams each won 24 or more games, marking another first for the West Coast Conference.

USF will open West Coast Conference play in the Pacific Northwest on Saturday, Dec. 28 against the Portland Pilots at the Chiles Center, followed by a Monday night contest against defending WCC champion Gonzaga in Spokane, Wash. on Dec. 30.

The first of two conference meetings with Saint Mary's takes place on Saturday, Jan. 11 in Moraga.

USF will have five straight home conference games beginning on Jan. 16 against the BYU Cougars. San Diego will follow BYU into Memorial Gym on Saturday, Jan. 18.
