He has led the Cougars to nine-straight 20-win seasons and nine-straight postseason appearances, including seven NCAA tournament appearances during that stretch.

Senior guard Tyler Haws, the 2013-14 West Coast Conference Player of the Year, has been named by the coaches to the preseason All-WCC team.

Junior guard Kyle Collinsworth was selected by the WCC coaches to the preseason All-WCC team. Collinsworth, an All-WCC performer last season, is coming off a torn ACL suffered at the end of last season.

Dave Rose

BYU head coach Dave Rose has led BYU to one of the most successful runs in program history since taking over in 2005.

Rose has been named conference coach of the year three times, district coach of the year twice, led the Cougars to four conference titles, seven NCAA tournament appearances, two NIT appearances, six 25-win seasons and nine 20-win seasons. In 2010, he led BYU to its first NCAA tournament win in 17 years and the Cougars won at least one postseason game in the next three seasons, including a spot in the Sweet 16 in 2011, a win in the 2012 NCAA tournament and a trip to the NIT semifinals in 2013.

Record Streaks

The Cougars will be looking to keep several program-record streaks intact during 2014-15. Coming into the season, Dave Rose has led the Cougars to nine-straight 20-win seasons, nine-straight postseason appearances and nine-straight seasons with 10-plus conference victories.
