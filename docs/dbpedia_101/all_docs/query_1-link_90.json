        "text": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – Arkansas defensive lineman Anton Juncaj was named National Preseason Newcomer of the Year, National Preseason Transfer of the Year, Preseason SEC Defensive Newcomer of the Year and Preseason SEC Defensive Transfer of the Year as seven Razorbacks received preseason All-SEC praise from College Football Network.\n\nJuncaj arrives on The Hill after spending the 2022-2023 seasons at Albany, where he appeared in 26 games. The Port Jervis, N.Y. product earned First-Team FCS All-America honors in 2023 after leading the nation with 15 sacks and finishing third among FCS players in tackles for loss with 21.5. During the season, Juncaj registered 55 total tackles (34 solo, 21 assisted), 12 quarterback hurries, five forced fumbles, and three pass breakups. He recorded at least one sack in 10 of the Great Danes’ 15 games.\n\nIn addition to Juncaj, defensive backs Jaylon Braxton and punt returner Isaiah Sategna earned second-team All-SEC selections. Defensive lineman Landon Jackson garnered preseason third-team All-SEC praise while wide receiver Andrew Armstrong, offensive lineman Fernando Carmona, running back Ja’Quinden Jackson and Juncaj received honorable mention All-SEC distinction. Jackson earned honorable mention honors at the FLEX position.\n\nBraxton is coming off an impressive 2023 campaign, which saw him earn Freshman All-SEC honors after leading the Razorbacks with eight pass breakups while recording 20 tackles, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and an interception. The Frisco, Texas product appeared in nine games and made six starts last season. He earned SEC Freshman of the Week honors after posting a season-high four tackles and forcing and returning a fumble 33 yards for a touchdown at Florida (Nov. 4).\n\nSategna was recently named to the 2024 Jet Award Preseason Watch List, which honors the most outstanding return specialist in college football. In 2023, he earned Freshman All-SEC honors and Third-Team All-SEC honors from Phil Steele after returning 23 kicks for 500 yards while registering 180 yards and a touchdown on 15 punt returns. His 680 total return yards were the sixth-most in a single season by a Razorback in program history and the seventh-most nationally in 2023. The Fayetteville product’s 500 kick-return yards were the 10th-most in a season in program history.\n\nLandon Jackson, who enters the 2024 campaign as a Walter Camp Football Foundation Preseason All-American and Preseason All-SEC selection, proved to be one of the nation’s most dominant pass rushers last season, tallying 44 total tackles, including team-leading 13.5 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks. He also recorded a pass breakup during his junior season for the Razorbacks. In 2023, Jackson became the first Arkansas defensive lineman since Jake Bequette in 2011 to earn First-Team All-SEC recognition.\n\nArmstrong returns for his second season on The Hill after leading Arkansas in receptions (56), receiving yards (764), receiving yards per game (63.7) and receiving touchdowns (5) a year ago. The Dallas product started all 12 games and caught at least two passes in every game, including a career-best nine vs. BYU for 98 yards. He logged 103 yards on three catches in the Razorbacks’ first-ever win at Florida and hauled in a pair of TDs in the victory vs. Kent State early in the season. He landed on Phil Steele’s preseason All-SEC fourth team.\n\nCarmona arrives in Fayetteville after spending the 2021-23 seasons at San Jose State, where he appeared in 25 games with 24 starts. In 2023, he earned Honorable Mention All-Mountain West accolades after registering a total of 765 snaps and posting an overall of 81.5 per Pro Football Focus (PFF), helping the Spartans earn a share of the regular-season Mountain West Championship. Last season, Carmona posted a pass-blocking grade of 81.0 and a run-blocking grade of 78.9 while allowing only two sacks in 424 snaps.\n\nJa’Quinden Jackson transferred to Arkansas this offseason following three seasons at Utah, where he played in 28 games, appearing as a running back, quarterback and on special teams. The Dallas, Texas native played in all 12 games while starting 11 at running back in 2023. Jackson led the Utes in carries (161), rushing yards (797), rushing touchdowns (4) and 100-yard games (3)."
