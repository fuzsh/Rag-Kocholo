        "text": "The last time Nick Emery, TJ Haws and Eric Mika played a regulation basketball game together before this season they made history.\n\nIn the spring of 2013 the trio, with the moniker 'Lone Peak Three,' not only won a third-consecutive 5A Utah state title, but were crowned the Max Preps high school national champions. Together, Haws, Emery and Mika beat some of the top teams in the country.\n\nIt was a real-life underdog story that broke down the typical stereotypes of high school basketball. Here was a group of white Mormons from Utah who were competing and winning at the highest level of high school basketball. Emery, Haws, and Mika garnered plenty of national acclaim and each received a number of scholarship offers to play for prestigious and storied basketball programs around the country.\n\nHowever, for the three, there was only one place they wanted to play. In an unprecedented move, the 'Lone Peak Three' were all recruited and accepted offers to play college basketball together for Dave Rose and BYU basketball. It is rare that two high school teammates are recruited and accept offers to continuing playing at the college level together, but three is almost unheard of in the world of college sports.\n\nAfter that historic season, the three diverged onto different paths that would someday lead them all back to Provo.\n\nEric Mika\n\nMika graduated in the spring of 2013 and opted to join the BYU men’s basketball team immediately for the 2013-14 campaign. With the graduation of star forward Brandon Davies, the Cougars were in desperate need of a big man to fill his shoes. Mika stepped up and started 29 of 33 games his freshman season, averaging 11.8 points and 6.4 rebounds per game. Mika scored in double figures 24 times, notched five double-doubles and by season’s end, Mika’s name was littered among the lists of the top freshmen in the country. He was named to the WCC All-Freshman Team.\n\nAfter a successful season, Mika departed to Italy on a two-year mission for the LDS Church.\n\nMika returned home in the spring of 2016 and immediately returned to basketball.\n\n“Since the day I got home — maybe the week after — we’ve been working out in the gym. It took about three months to get back to 100 percent,” Mika said.\n\nMika was excited about the opportunity to finally reunite with his former high school teammates.\n\n“Both Nick and TJ definitely make me a better player,' Mika said. 'Being with them makes me happy because they make me look better than I really am.”\n\nMika married his high school sweetheart, Gabrielle, in September.\n\nNick Emery\n\nWhile teammate Eric Mika opted to play a year after high school, Emery decided to immediately serve a mission. With a slew of guards already playing at BYU, including all-time leading scorer Tyler Haws, Emery’s role would have been negated by upperclassmen. Instead Emery served an LDS mission in Germany and returned prior to the 2015-16 season.\n\nEmery worked hard to get back into basketball shape following his mission and quickly worked his way into the starting lineup for the Cougars. Emery started in 32 of 36 games last season and averaged 16.3 points per game.\n\nEmery wasn't above criticism, as many fans were frustrated by his streaky play and inconsistency from the 3-point line. Now as a sophomore and team captain, Emery is looking to improve on and off the court because he knows expectations are high.\n\n“As a team, we’re expected to do a lot of things this year,' Emery said. “We have to go out and get those. It’s sitting on the table and we have to pick it up and take it.”\n\nTJ Haws\n\nMika and Haws were both seniors when they won a National Title, but TJ Haws was still a junior in high school with another year to play. Haws watched Mika’s success at BYU while continuing the tradition of success at Lone Peak. Haws led Lone Peak to a fourth- consecutive 5A Utah state championship.\n\nAfter graduating, Haws left to serve a mission in France for the LDS Church and returned around the same time as Mika. Like Mika, he focused on getting back into basketball shape.\n\n“My brother (Tyler) helped me out a lot,' Haws said. 'He’s been through it. My dad helped me out a lot. We tried to just take things slowly to try to get back into running shape.”\n\nHaws recounted what the meeting was like between the 'Lone Peak Three' after not seeing each other for three years. He said it was like the group had never parted ways.\n\n“It was so good to see these guys again,' Haws said. 'I felt like our friendship off the floor was the same, as well as off the court. I’m really excited to be able to play with them again.”\n\nIt is not hard to see why.\n\nIn the Cougars' season opening win over Princeton, the three scored 61 of BYU's 82 points.\n\nThe return of the 'Lone Peak Three' has been long awaited. “That’s part of the excitement and the hype of this group is that there are a few players we’ve waited to play together for a long time.” Coach Rose said. “When you look at TJ and Nick, when they came in my office and committed to us, at that time we were recruiting two or three other players that have gone to their individual schools and graduated. Now it’s our turn to get that committed class here to play together.”\n\nIt has been a long journey since that fateful day in the spring of 2013 when they last suited up together. Over three years later, the 'Lone Peak three' are back together. With the trio finally on the same roster it may be time to finally retire the 'Lone Peak Three' and adopt a new title, 'The BYU Three.'"
