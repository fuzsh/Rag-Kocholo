Idaho was a charter member of the Big Sky, competing in the league from 1963-1996. The Vandals’ return gives the Big Sky 12 men’s basketball members. Idaho played in the WAC Championship game in 2014, losing to New Mexico State. The Vandals are coached by Don Verlin. Idaho’s first game under the Big Sky banner since 1996 comes Friday night as the Vandals play host to Eastern Oregon. Idaho won Big Sky postseason championships in 1981, 1982, 1989, and 1990. The Vandals last appeared in the Big Sky championship game in 1993.\n\nWHAT’S NEW: Big Sky teams will no longer play a true double round-robin schedule. League teams will play 18 conference games.

Montana State’s Brian Fish came to Bozeman from Oregon, where he served as an assistant coach under Dana Altman. Fish has also been an assistant at Creighton (twice), Kansas State, San Diego, TCU and Marshall. Fish replaced Brad Huse, who coached the Bobcats for eight seasons. DeCuire replaced Wayne Tinkle, who left Montana after eight seasons to become the head coach at Oregon State.

Former Montana guard Will Cherry made his NBA debut with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Nov. 7. Cherry scored his first NBA basket on Nov. 10 with an assist from LeBron James.\n\nGARRITY 10TH IN DIMES: Sacramento State’s Dylan Garrity begins his senior season 10th in league history in assists with 443.
