In 2010, he led BYU to its first NCAA tournament win in 17 years and the Cougars won at least one postseason game in the next three seasons, including a spot in the Sweet 16 in 2011, a win in the 2012 NCAA tournament and a trip to the NIT semifinals in 2013.\n\nRecord Streaks\n\nThe Cougars will be looking to keep several program-record streaks intact during 2014-15.

In league games, a school has had the league’s leading scorer in at least three-straight seasons three other times (San Francisco from 2006-07 to 2008-09, Loyola Marymount from 1982-83 to 1985-86 and Loyola Marymount from 1987-88 to 1991-92).\n\n2014 EA SPORTS Maui Invitational\n\nBYU will play in the 31st annual EA SPORTS™ Maui Invitational® this season.
