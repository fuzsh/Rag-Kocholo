        "text": "Kerry Miller@ @kerrancejamesCollege Basketball National Analyst\n\nPower Ranking the 50 US States by College Basketball Strength\n\n0 of 52\n\nMark Zerof-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWe are constantly being bombarded with debates about the best conference in the country, but this might be the first time anyone has attempted to mathematically rank the 50 U.S. states (and District of Columbia) by college basketball strength.\n\nUsing 75 years of tournament history and three years of AP rankings, we've done exactly that.\n\nDepending on how well you know college basketball history, you can probably guess most of the states in the top 10. Based on their sheer number of national championships, it should be no surprise to find California, Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina near the top of the list.\n\nBut Nevada at No. 4? That one shocked even me.\n\nOn the following slide, I'll explain the thought process that went into the calculations. Beyond that, we'll work our way from Alaska all the way up to the most successful state in the nation.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, statistics on the following slides are courtesy of College Basketball Reference.\n\nCriteria Considered\n\n1 of 52\n\nDavid Banks-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIf math isn't your thing, feel free to jump right into the rankings, but rest assured there is a method to this madness. For those of you who aren't terrified by numbers, here's how we determined where each state ranks.\n\nThe historical component—which accounts for 85 percent of each state's score—is based entirely on tournament appearances, Final Fours, national championships and the combined number of years for all D-I schools in each state. Regular-season wins were not included because, let's be honest, what you do during the regular season means nothing compared to how you do in the tournament.\n\nNumber of years per D-I school was included in the calculation, as it's simply not fair to judge states like California and Texas with more than 20 D-I schools on the same plane as states like Minnesota and Wyoming that only have one school to bring home the bacon.\n\nAlso, tournament appearances by schools that are no longer D-I were excluded. Apologies to Oklahoma and New York for losing the contributions of Oklahoma City, NYU and CCNY, but we either had to exclude those wins or include every school that ever counted as D-I—and the former was much less complicated.\n\nIn the end, we settled on the following formula: [TA + (FF*4) + (NC*20)] / Y\n\nTA = tournament appearances, FF = Final Fours, NC = national championships and Y = total number of tournament-eligible years by all D-I schools in the state.\n\nThe current component makes up the remaining 15 percent of each state's score, and it is based on the number of weeks that schools have been ranked in the AP Top 25 since the start of the 2011-12 season. As with the historical component, we had to include a multiplier for the number of schools, so as to not give an unfair advantage to states with a lot of D-I schools.\n\nThe formula for the current component is: WR / (54*S)\n\nWR = weeks ranked and S = number of schools in the state. Fifty-four represents the maximum number of weeks that a team could have been ranked.\n\nWe also added multipliers to each component. To get the historical component on a scale from 0 to 85, the scores were multiplied by 74.6744. To put the current component on a scale from 0 to 15, a factor of 24.796 was included.\n\nAdd them together, and you get each state's score.\n\nPretty simple, right?\n\n51. Alaska\n\n2 of 52\n\nMichael Dinneen/Associated Press\n\nScore: N/A\n\nNumber of D-I Programs: Zero\n\nNoteworthy Programs: Alaska-Anchorage Seawolves (D-II)\n\nAlaska is at the bottom of the list for not having any D-I schools.\n\nOn the plus side, Alaska does give us the Great Alaska Shootout every year, and Alaska-Anchorage did score a memorable win over Michigan 25 years ago.\n\n50. Maine\n\n3 of 52\n\nDavid Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\n\nScore: 0.0\n\nNumber of D-I Programs: One\n\nNoteworthy Programs: Maine Black Bears\n\nThe Past\n\nThe Black Bears have a ton of history.\n\nHardly any of it is good.\n\nThis is Maine's 53rd season of NCAA tournament eligibility, but it has yet to make an appearance in the Big Dance. The Black Bears have finished 22 of the past 32 seasons with a sub-.500 record, and they have already locked in a sub-.500 record for the 2013-14 season.\n\nThe Present\n\nThe America East Conference's tournament representative has been either a No. 15 or No. 16 seed in each of the past six seasons. Maine's conference record over the past six seasons was 35-57.\n\nYou do the math.\n\nThe Future\n\nThere isn't a single senior on this year's roster, so there's at least a reasonable expectation that this team will be much improved next season under a ton of veteran leadership.\n\n49. Delaware\n\n4 of 52\n\nGreg Bartram-USA TODAY Sports\n\nScore: 3.27\n\nNumber of D-I Programs: Two\n\nNoteworthy Programs: Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens and Delaware State Hornets\n\nThe Past\n\nThough the two schools have combined to make five NCAA tournaments since 1992, they have yet to win a game in the Big Dance.\n\nDelaware State's one appearance came as a No. 16 seed in the 2005 NCAA tournament. After opening the season 4-11 with an ample number of blowout losses to power-conference schools, the Hornets won 15 of their next 17 games in MEAC play before running into Duke in the opening round.\n\nAt least the Fightin' Blue Hens had a fightin' chance in three of their four appearances, earning a No. 13 seed in the 1992, 1993 and 1999 NCAA tournaments. Unfortunately, they couldn't capitalize on any of them.\n\nThe Present\n\nDelaware State is nothing short of dreadful—ranking near the bottom in the nation in virtually every statistical category—but Delaware won the Colonial regular-season championship.\n\nThe Future\n\nDelaware's five leading scorers consist of three seniors and two juniors, so there might be a couple of rebuilding years in the near future.\n\n48. Montana\n\n5 of 52\n\nBen Margot/Associated Press\n\nScore: 5.97\n\nNumber of D-I Programs: Two\n\nNoteworthy Programs: Montana Grizzlies and Montana State Bobcats\n\nThe Past\n\nThe Bobcats are 0-3 in NCAA tournament history, but the Grizzlies do have two wins—one over Utah State in 1975 and one over Nevada in 2006.\n\nTheir biggest contribution to the tournament, though, was knocking Weber State out of three consecutive Big Sky tournaments from 2010-12, thus keeping Damian Lillard from doing his best Stephen Curry impersonation.\n\nNeither team has ever been ranked in the AP Top 25, and that doesn't seem likely to change in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Present\n\nThe Grizzlies have been to three of the last four NCAA tournaments. Kareem Jamar and teammates would love to make it four out of five.\n\nThe Future\n\nMontana State does have a mildly intriguing recruit coming next season. Bradley Fisher, a 7'0\" center from England, will be joining the Bobcats in large part due to assistant coach Chris Haslam. Haslam was also a big man from England and spent his collegiate days at Wyoming back in the early '90s.\n\nFisher is by no means a top recruit, though, and Montana State is losing its top two scorers from a team that barely scores as it is. Montana is also losing its top scorer to graduation, so 2014-15 could be even more of a rebuilding year than usual in the state of Montana.\n\n47. Vermont\n\n6 of 52\n\nELISE AMENDOLA/Associated Press\n\nScore: 6.33\n\nNumber of D-I Programs: One\n\nNoteworthy Programs: Vermont Catamounts\n\nThe Past\n\nTry as they might, the Catamounts are unlikely to ever outdo what they did in the 2005 NCAA tournament.\n\nTaylor Coppenrath and T.J. Sorrentine led the team to a monumental upset over No. 4 Syracuse in the opening round. It was the only time (thus far) that Vermont has come within 10 points of advancing to the round of 32.\n\nThe Present\n\nChances are you've had no reason to hear about Vermont since its near-upset of Duke on Nov. 24, but the Catamounts have been playing pretty well in 2014.\n\nSince opening the season with a 4-8 record, they have dominated in America East play and should be well on their way to this year's tournament.\n\nThe Future\n\nVermont does have a 3-star recruit next season in the form of Brandon Hatton, but the team is also losing all five of its leading scorers to graduation. The America East Conference isn't exactly a gauntlet of quality competition, but there could be a couple of difficult years forthcoming.\n\n46. Idaho\n\n7 of 52\n\nOtto Kitsinger/Associated Press\n\nScore: 6.44\n\nNumber of D-I Programs: Three\n\nNoteworthy Programs: Idaho Vandals, Idaho State Bengals and Boise State Broncos\n\nThe Past\n\nIdaho State hasn't been to the NCAA tournament in 27 years. The Bengals haven't even finished more than one game over .500 in any of the past 19 seasons. But there is a fair amount of tournament history in that potato patch.\n\nBack in the 1950s, Idaho State was a regular in the NCAA tournament. The Bengals went to seven consecutive tournaments from 1953-1959, winning a total of six games during that stretch. They also advanced to the Elite Eight in 1977, stunning UCLA in the Sweet 16 to end the Bruins' streak of 10 straight years making it to the Final Four.\n\nThe other two schools haven't done nearly as well. Idaho won one game in the 1982 NCAA tournament, while Boise State is still winless in six trips.\n\nThe Present\n\nIdaho and Idaho State are a combined 151 games below .500 over the past nine seasons, and neither is doing much to improve upon that this season.\n\nBoise State has been much better than that, but a stretch of three straight losses to open the month of February has doomed the Broncos to a trip to the 2014 NIT.\n\nThe Future\n\nIdaho and Idaho State aren't going anywhere fast, but 2014-15 could be a special year for Boise State.\n\nAssuming Anthony Drmic and Derrick Marks return for their senior seasons, they will join forces with incoming 4-star recruit Chandler Hutchison. With both New Mexico and San Diego State losing a few crucial players to graduation, the Mountain West will likely be a battle between Boise State and UNLV.\n\n45.

Either UC Santa Barbara or UC Irvine will likely represent the Big West in the 2014 tourney, but Hawaii has a chance to get back to the Big Dance for the first time in over a decade.\n\nThe Future\n\nChristian Standhardinger will be dearly missed when he graduates after this season, but between Garrett Nevels, Isaac Fotu and Keith Shamburger, Hawaii will still have quite a stable of scorers next season.\n\n44.

It's a pretty good state for football, but its basketball prowess is quite lacking.\n\nDespite 12 schools, the state has a grand total of 16 victories in NCAA tournament history. The majority of those belong to Clemson (nine) and South Carolina (four), and the Gamecocks haven't won a tournament game since 1973.\n\nNo team from South Carolina has ever been to the Final Four, and Clemson's run to the Elite Eight in 1980 was the only time the state has even gone that far.\n\nThe Present\n\nClemson briefly had an outside shot at making this year's tournament as an at-large team, but it wouldn't be a surprise if the state failed to send a single team to the tournament for a third consecutive season.\n\nThe Future\n\nBefore a disappointing 2012-13 season, Clemson had finished above .500 in seven consecutive seasons, and it is well on its way to starting a new streak this year.\n\nWith South Carolina almost certainly destined for a fifth straight season finishing in the bottom three in the SEC standings, Clemson might be the state's best hope for future returns.\n\n43.

After several years as an Independent, North Dakota State joined the Summit League before the 2007-08 season. North Dakota spent a few years in the Great West—a conference that did not receive an auto bid to the tournament—until joining the Big Sky this past season.\n\nStill, one tournament appearance and no tournament wins won't cut it in these rankings. Maybe the state deserves some bonus points for having the only player to score 60 points in a game in the past 13 years, but Ben Woodside merely serves as a bright spot in a lackluster history.\n\nThe Present\n\nNorth Dakota State was strong last season but not strong enough to overcome South Dakota State's Nate Wolters in the Summit League final. The Bison are the team to beat this year, though.\n\nThe Future\n\nThe three leading scorers for both North Dakota and North Dakota State are seniors, and—big surprise—neither school has much of anything in the pipeline in the way of top recruits.

The last time it happened was at the conclusion of the 1958-59 season. Prior to that, though, the state has a decent amount of tourney history.\n\nDartmouth has a 10-7 record in the NCAA tournament, including playing in the 1942 and 1944 national championship games—coming up short in both.\n\nThe Present\n\nThe Wildcats have never made the NCAA tournament and haven't finished above .500 since the 1993-94 season. Dartmouth's recent past hasn't been much better. The Big Green won just 27 percent of their games over the past 14 seasons.\n\nThe Future\n\nIf either of these teams made the NCAA tournament in the next five years—let alone won a game in the tournament—we would need a documentary to discover how it was even possible.\n\n41.

The Buffaloes don't have a single senior averaging better than 5.0 minutes per game, so they'll have virtually their entire rotation back for another go-around.\n\nThe Rams are losing one somewhat key player (Gerson Santo) to graduation, but they will have a bevy of crucial upperclassmen returning for another year.

Yet, the Braves have three (opening-round) tournament wins in their history. That's three more wins than 2014 sleeper team Southern Miss can claim. So, yes, the SWAC team counts as a noteworthy program.\n\nOle Miss and Mississippi State don't have a particularly deep history of success—the schools had a combined record of 1-3 in the first 56 NCAA tournaments—but have both been solid since the mid-'90s. They have a total of 14 tournament wins in the past 20 years, including the Bulldogs' trip to the 1996 Final Four.\n\nThe Present\n\nMississippi State has struggled over the past two seasons since Rick Stansbury's sudden retirement from the head coaching position, but the state is still in good shape.\n\nAndy Kennedy has gotten Ole Miss back to being a quality program—even though most probably can't look past Marshall Henderson's antics these days—and Southern Miss is bound to do a bit of tournament damage at some point in the next few seasons.\n\nThe Future\n\nMississippi State is an incredibly young team right now. Of the Bulldogs' five leading scorers, three are sophomores. In total, they have nine underclassmen on the roster. In theory, they'll only get better with age.\n\nOle Miss is losing Henderson after the season, but it has a quartet of 3-star recruits on the way.

However, the Friars do have two incoming freshmen whom ESPN ranks in the top 100 of the 2014 class, and they have already gotten a verbal commitment from a 4-star recruit for the 2015-16 season.\n\nIf there's hope for the future for Rhode Island, it's in Providence.\n\n38.

Syracuse is great and St. John's was fantastic once upon a time, but the other 20 schools have combined for 66 tournament appearances and one Final Four in 1,148 years of existence.\n\nFocusing on the positives, though, Syracuse won it all in 2003, has been to five Final Fours and has missed the tournament just seven times in the past 41 years. Save for a couple of truly iconic programs like Indiana, Kentucky, Louisville and North Carolina, there hasn't been a more consistently great school over the past four decades than Syracuse.\n\nSt. John's had a pretty nice run of its own for about 20 years under Lou Carnesecca. From 1976-92, the Red Storm competed in 15 NCAA tournaments, advancing to one Final Four, three Elite Eights and four Sweet 16s.\n\nThe Present\n\nAside from another great season for Syracuse, New York has St. John's fighting for an at-large bid, Canisius, Iona and Manhattan battling for the MAAC title and LIU-Brooklyn's Jason Brickman making a run at the all-time assists record.\n\nProvided you aren't hoping to see Binghamton, Cornell or Niagara win any games, it's been a fun year of college hoops in New York.\n\nThe Future\n\nSyracuse is presumed great until proven otherwise, and St. John's should be headed for at least another above-average season if D'Angelo Harrison, Jakarr Sampson and Rysheed Jordan are back again next year.\n\n36.

Starting in the 1984-85 season, the Yellow Jackets spent at least one week in the AP Top 15 in 12 consecutive seasons. During that stretch, they won 15 games in 10 trips to the NCAA tournament.\n\nSave for a surprising run to the 2004 national championship game, it has been almost 20 years since we've really seen Georgia Tech play that well.\n\nOutside of Georgia Tech, though, there's not much to write home about. Georgia has a 7-11 all-time record in the tournament, but the Bulldogs have only gone to 10 of the past 30 tournaments, making the Sweet 16 just once (1996).\n\nThe Present\n\nGeorgia might send two teams to the 2014 NCAA tournament, but it won't be either of the ones mentioned above. Georgia has had a nice run since the end of November, but the Bulldogs are still a large stone's throw from a tournament bid.\n\nMercer has already earned the Atlantic Sun's automatic bid, and Georgia State may very well represent the Sun Belt. If Georgia State does make it, I hope the selection committee does the right thing and pits the Panthers against Kentucky as early as possible.\n\nWho doesn't want to watch Ryan Harrow try to eliminate the team he led to the NIT last year?\n\nThe Future\n\nGeorgia Tech is near the bottom of the ACC and is going to lose three of its five leading scorers after the season. I don't know when the Yellow Jackets will return to national relevance, but I'm pretty confident it won't be next season.\n\nGeorgia, on the other hand, has just one senior on the roster (Donte' Williams), and he's sixth on the team in both points and minutes.

All in all, the state has had eight chances to go dancing and has impressively converted on two of them.\n\nUnfortunately, the Jackrabbits opened the 2012 tournament against a Baylor team that would eventually reach the Elite Eight and merely served as a stepping stone at the start of Michigan's journey to the 2013 championship game.\n\nThe Present\n\nWhen Nate Wolters graduated to the NBA, he took the state's competitiveness with him.

Tommy Amaker has the Crimson headed very much in the right direction, and the Minutemen made it as high as No. 13 in the AP Top 25 this year after 14 consecutive seasons without once being ranked.\n\nThe Future\n\nAside from Chris Egi going to Harvard, there isn't a single player in 247sports.com's ranking of the top 250 incoming recruits that has committed to play for a school in Massachusetts.\n\nHarvard will remain in great shape—especially in a weak conference—but it might be a down year or two for the Minutemen as they adjust to life without Chaz Williams.\n\nAlso, try not to be alarmed when basketball pundits start offering Boston College as a sleeper team for next season. The Eagles haven't signed a single incoming freshman for next season, but they also aren't losing anyone who has scored a point in this calendar year.\n\nExpect a lot of \"This team beat Syracuse! Imagine what it can do with another year of experience!\" rationale over the summer.\n\n26.

Bradley made it to the championship game in both 1950 and 1954, losing both.\n\nOther than the Illini's trip to the 2005 championship game—a loss to North Carolina—those were the only times the state of Illinois was represented in the NCAA title game.\n\nThat's pretty surprising, considering how good DePaul was in the 1970s and '80s and how successful the Fighting Illini have been for the past 30 years.\n\nIn total, though, the state has been to 89 tournaments, advancing to the Final Four 10 times.\n\nThe Present\n\nThe 2013-14 season has not been kind to the Prairie State. We'll see what happens in the conference tournaments, but the state could very well go 0-of-13 in tournament bids this year.\n\nThe Illini did appear in the AP Top 25 for one week back in January, but that hardly makes up for an otherwise disappointing season.\n\nThe Future\n\nIt's no fluke that both DePaul and Illinois are near the bottom of their conference standings.

Only BYU (27) has been to more dances without making it past the Elite Eight.\n\nThey do have 22 tournament wins in those 26 trips, but it's rather disappointing to see a team have that many above-average seasons without any banners worth hanging.\n\nThe Present\n\nSaint Louis has been one of the better teams in the country over the past three seasons. The Billikens will be headed to the NCAA tournament for a third consecutive year, hoping to break their 57-year drought without a Sweet 16 appearance.\n\nMissouri is on the bubble, but the Tigers will also be looking to extend their streak of tourney appearances. Should they see their name on Selection Sunday, it will be for the sixth straight season.\n\nThe Future\n\nSaint Louis is going to have one heck of a rebuilding season next year. All five of the Billikens' leaders in minutes played are in their final year of eligibility. Grandy Glaze (what a name!) averaged just 2.8 points per game through Saint Louis' first 11 A-10 games, but he'll likely have to be a leading scorer next year.\n\nMissouri's fate is TBD until we find out whether Jabari Brown and/or Jordan Clarkson decide to return for their senior years.

In 32 years of existence, Seattle has been to 11 NCAA tournaments, including the 1958 championship game against Kentucky.\n\nThat was the last time Washington was represented in the Final Four.

The Washington Huskies are pretty good, but they're going to miss the tournament for a third straight season.\n\nThe Future\n\nDon't hold your breath.

The Ducks have made four more trips to the Elite Eight, though—most recently in 2002 and 2007—so at least the past 75 years haven't been a total loss.\n\nOregon State has been to two Final Fours (1949 and 1963).\n\nThe Present\n\nOregon State has some history, but none of it is recent. The Beavers are very likely headed toward a 24th consecutive season without a tournament bid.\n\nOregon, on the other hand, is in great shape. It has been a tale of three seasons for the Ducks, opening the year 13-0 before losing eight out of 10 and finishing the regular season with seven straight victories. All in all, it's enough to go dancing. The Ducks will be looking to build on last year's trip to the Sweet 16.\n\nThe Future\n\nIt could be a rough couple of years in Oregon. Between the Ducks and the Beavers, there are 11 seniors on the 2013-14 roster—including five of the seven players averaging better than 10 points per game.\n\nOregon State may be adding JUCO transfer Gary Payton II next year, but unless he's twice as good as his dad, it won't be enough to have that team contending for a Pac-12 title.\n\n19.

St. Francis (PA), Lehigh, Lafayette and Bucknell have combined for just 15 tournament appearances in 284 years of opportunity—without a single tip to the Final Four.\n\nMost of Pennsylvania's history is of the ancient variety. Other than Villanova's trip to the 2009 Final Four, each of the state's appearances in the national semifinals came more than 25 years ago.\n\nThe Present\n\nBoth Pittsburgh and Villanova will be looking to change that this year. Pittsburgh still hasn't proven that it is capable of winning a big game this year, but Villanova is pretty comfortably one of the best teams in the country.\n\nThe Future\n\nPittsburgh might be in some trouble next year after it loses both Lamar Patterson and Talib Zanna.\n\nVillanova should still be in good shape. James Bell is graduating, but the Wildcats are adding a pair of 4-star recruits to an already deep rotation.\n\nAnd on the \"Rip Van Winkle Sleeper Watch,\" keep an eye out for Temple next season. The 2013-14 season was a colossal disaster, but the Owls were in the NCAA tournament in each of the previous six seasons.\n\nThey are losing leading scorer Dalton Pepper but will return three players averaging better than 13 points per game this year while adding a 4-star power forward.\n\n18.

They had a 5-3 record in the NCAA tournament from 1968-70, but all three of the losses came at the hands of John Wooden's Bruins. And in their last respectable showing in the tournament, UCLA eliminated them in the Sweet 16 of the 1992 tournament.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lobos have been a very good regular-season team over the past 30 or so years, but they haven't yet figured out how to turn that into a deep tournament run.\n\nThe Present\n\nBoth schools have made the tournament in each of the past two seasons and should do so again this year. New Mexico will likely make the tournament as an at-large team. And if New Mexico State fails to win the WAC tournament to earn an automatic bid, something has gone horribly wrong.\n\nThe Future\n\nNew Mexico could fall on some hard times after losing Cameron Bairstow and Kendall Williams to graduation—and would really be in trouble if Alex Kirk decides to forgo his senior season—but I suspect the Land of Enchantment will be doubly represented in the tournament for at least a fourth consecutive year.\n\n16.

In fact, there isn't an entire state (aside from California, of course) that has more titles than UCLA's 11.\n\nUnfortunately, California's score was bogged down by a plethora of UCs (Davis, Irvine, Riverside and Santa Barbara) and Cal States (Bakersfield, Fullerton and Northridge) that have amounted to virtually nothing. Those seven schools have combined for nine tournament appearances in 176 years of existence.\n\nSure, UCLA has been to 18 Final Fours, but there are also 18 schools in California that have never advanced that far in 720 seasons. It ended up diluting the Bruins' contributions.\n\nJust know that, even though California isn't No. 1 in these rankings, UCLA would be No. 1 if we were power rankings the 351 schools.\n\nThe Present\n\nOf course, only one of California's 15 national championships has occurred since USA's Bicentennial year.

Michigan\n\n46 of 52\n\nTony Ding/Associated Press\n\nScore: 42.19\n\nNumber of D-I Programs: Seven\n\nNoteworthy Programs: Michigan Wolverines and Michigan State Spartans\n\nThe Past\n\nIn the past 29 years, Michigan and Michigan State have combined to make 39 tournament appearances, 19 Sweet 16s, 10 Final Fours and two national championships. Prior to 1985, they had another five Final Fours and a national championship.\n\nThe rest of the state has done nothing special, but the two banner programs have accomplished more than enough to carry the Wolverine State into the top 10.\n\nThe Present\n\nBoth Michigan and Michigan State are likely headed for a No. 4 seed or better for a third straight season. There might be seven programs in the country who accomplish that task on Selection Sunday, but the fact that two are from the same state is quite impressive.\n\nThe Future\n\nFar be it from me to doubt Tom Izzo's coaching abilities, but next season could be a tough one for the Spartans. They will definitely be losing Keith Appling and Adreian Payne. Chances are they'll lose Gary Harris to the NBA as well.\n\nMichigan's fate is very much to be determined. The Wolverines only have one senior and one junior, and neither Jon Horford nor Jordan Morgan would be missed too much if the rest of their core group ignores the temptation to bolt for the pros.\n\nIn a perfect world, they still have three more years of Zak Irvin and Derrick Walton Jr. and two more years of Mitch McGary, Nik Stauskas, Glenn Robinson III and Caris LeVert. If all of those guys actually stick around, we might as well just hand the next few B1G titles to Michigan now.\n\n6. Oklahoma\n\n47 of 52\n\nAlonzo Adams-USA TODAY Sports\n\nScore: 46.25\n\nNumber of D-I Programs: Four\n\nNoteworthy Programs: Oklahoma State Cowboys and Oklahoma Sooners\n\nThe Past\n\nIn the first 13 years of the NCAA tournament, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State combined for six Final Fours and two national championships—back-to-back titles in 1945-46 when Oklahoma State was still known as Oklahoma A&M.\n\nSince then, they have each made the Final Four twice. Oklahoma has been in 23 of the past 31 tournaments, while Oklahoma State has gone to 16 of the last 23.\n\nThe Present\n\nNeither has had much tournament success in recent years, though. Oklahoma did make an Elite Eight appearance in 2009, but Oklahoma and Oklahoma State have a combined record of 5-7 in the tournament since 2006.\n\nBoth will be looking to improve upon that record this year. The Cowboys' bid is still a little shaky at the moment, but the Sooners will almost certainly get their chance.\n\nThe Future\n\nThe Sooners should be in great shape for a while. They're losing Cameron Clark this year, but he's the only one of their top five scorers that isn't a freshman or a sophomore.\n\nOklahoma State's future is considerably more up in the air. Markel Brown is graduating after this season, and Marcus Smart will likely depart for the NBA as well. The Cowboys have a pair of quality incoming recruits in Joe Burton and Jared Terrell, but they're still holding out hope for Myles Turner.\n\nShould they land the top remaining unsigned recruit, they'll be contending for a Big 12 title next season. If they don't, it might be another March on the bubble.\n\n5. Wisconsin\n\n48 of 52\n\nAndy Manis/Associated Press\n\nScore: 48.61\n\nNumber of D-I Programs: Four\n\nNoteworthy Programs: Marquette Golden Eagles and Wisconsin Badgers\n\nThe Past\n\nThe Wisconsin Badgers make the tournament nearly every year, but they always seem to get eliminated before they should. They're basically the opposite of Michigan State, which seems to always win one or two more games than it should.\n\nSince incredulously making it to the Final Four as a No. 8 seed in 2000, Wisconsin has been to 13 straight tournaments, advancing to the Elite Eight just once in 2005. And let's be honest, the Badgers had some help that year by being the No. 6 seed in a region where both the No. 3 and No. 2 seed lost before playing Wisconsin.\n\nBut, Wisconsin won the national championship in 1941, and Marquette won it in 1977, so the Badger State is in pretty good shape.\n\nThe Present\n\nWisconsin will extend its tournament streak to 16 consecutive seasons, likely earning a No. 2 seed this year.\n\nMarquette will almost certainly miss the tournament at this point, but there is hope for Wisconsin elsewhere. Green Bay was gathering some serious steam as this year's consensus Cinderella team until the Phoenix were an early exit from the Horizon tournament. They still have an outside shot at an at-large bid, but it's likely Badgers or nothing for the state of Wisconsin.\n\nThe Future\n\nMarquette is losing more than 50 percent of its points and rebounds to graduation. Buzz Williams won't let that program sink too far, but it might be another year or two before the Golden Eagles are back and ready to compete.\n\nWisconsin's only major casualty this year will be Ben Brust, but that just means more minutes for Nigel Hayes and Bronson Koenig. The Badgers will be plenty strong once again next season.\n\n4. Nevada\n\n49 of 52\n\nEthan Miller/Getty Images\n\nScore: 49.55\n\nNumber of D-I Programs: Two\n\nNoteworthy Programs: UNLV Runnin' Rebels and Nevada Wolfpack\n\nThe Past\n\nDuring Jerry Tarkanian's 19 years as a head coach at UNLV, the Runnin' Rebels won 82.9 percent of their games, advancing to four Final Fours and winning the national championship in 1990.\n\nAs a point of comparison, UCLA won 84.4 percent of its games during John Wooden's final 19 years at the helm—which includes the Bruins' 10 national championship in a span of 12 years.\n\nOutside of Wooden, you'd be hard-pressed to find a coach who accomplished more for a program in two decades than Tark the Shark.\n\nThe Present\n\nAside from that hot stretch in the 1970s and '80s, though, there hasn't been a whole lot going on in the Silver State. Nevada has never been to the Elite Eight, and UNLV hasn't been there since 1991.\n\nNeither will be making the tournament this year, barring a miraculous run through the Mountain West Conference tournament.\n\nThe Future\n\nThe Wolf Pack are slumping and going nowhere fast. They were able to take care of business in the WAC fairly routinely, but it might be a while before they're really competing for a MWC title—especially with their two leading scorers leaving after this season.\n\nUNLV, however, should be back on top of the MWC next season. The Runnin' Rebels lose a relatively key player in Kevin Olekaibe, but they have one of the top recruiting classes in the country after signing Rashad Vaughn in mid-February.\n\n3. North Carolina\n\n50 of 52\n\nGrant Halverson/Getty Images\n\nScore: 56.52\n\nNumber of D-I Programs: 18\n\nNoteworthy Programs: North Carolina Tar Heels, Duke Blue Devils and North Carolina State Wolfpack\n\nThe Past\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, North Carolina has an area of 53,819 square miles. Strange that the vast majority of the state's history is contained to three schools within about 30 miles of each other.\n\nBoth Charlotte (1977) and Wake Forest (1962) have advanced to the Final Four once, but they've got nothing on the Triangle.\n\nNorth Carolina has been to 18 Final Fours, winning five titles. Duke isn't far behind with 14 trips to the national semifinals and four championships. Compared to all that, North Carolina State's three Final Fours and pair of national championships seems pretty pithy, but the Wolfpack are still one of just 14 schools that have won it all more than once.\n\nThe Present\n\nAs is often the case, Duke and North Carolina are looking great, while the rest of the state is pretty much left to root for them.\n\nIf you insist on rooting for a team from the Tar Heel State that is neither the Tar Heels nor the Blue Devils, jump on North Carolina Central's bandwagon. The Eagles only became eligible for the NCAA tournament in 2011 and have not yet been to the Big Dance. But they are the overwhelming favorites to represent the MEAC this March.\n\nThe Future\n\nDuke and North Carolina have two of the five best incoming recruiting classes in the entire country.\n\nAt least one of those two schools has been in every tournament since 1974 and at least one has advanced to the Sweet 16 in each of the 18 NCAA tournaments since 1996.\n\nDon't expect either of those trends to end any time soon.\n\n2.

Did you notice the completely ridiculous jump from No. 3 to No. 2?\n\nThe gap between Kansas and North Carolina is larger than the difference between North Carolina and No. 16 Ohio.\n\nKansas doesn't have anywhere near as many titles as states like California, Kentucky and North Carolina, but the Sunflower State checks in at No. 2 in the power rankings because it doesn't have a single bad team weighing it down.\n\nWichita State has been to two Final Fours, Kansas State has been to four of them and the Jayhawks have won three national championships in 14 trips to the Final Four.\n\nThe Present\n\nBoth Wichita State and Kansas are very much in the running for a No. 1 seed.\n\nKansas is headed to its 25th consecutive NCAA tournament, while Kansas State will likely be going to the tournament for a fifth straight year.\n\nThe Future\n\nKansas might be losing Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid after just one season, but the Jayhawks will be reloading once again with 5-star recruits Cliff Alexander and Kelly Oubre.\n\nWith all of the press it has gotten this season, it's hard to imagine Wichita State will have any difficulty recruiting over the next few years. Losing Cleanthony Early after this season may lead to a brief adjustment period, but the Shockers should be fine for years to come.\n\n1.

And unlike North Carolina, the other schools in the Bluegrass State aren't a complete liability.\n\nWestern Kentucky has been to 23 tournaments and competed in the 1971 Final Four. Eastern Kentucky, Morehead State and Murray State have 29 total tournament appearances.\n\nThe Present\n\nIn the past three years, both Kentucky and Louisville have been to two Final Fours and have won a national championship. Each is a strong candidate to make the Final Four this year as well.\n\nThe Future\n\nKentucky and Louisville have two of the five best recruiting classes in the nation.\n\nLooks like good things happen for your state when you've won the past two national championships.\n\nX"
