        "text": "Venue: LaVell Edwards Stadium / Qualcomm Stadium\n\nLocation: Provo, UT / San Diego, CA\n\nDate: Saturday, October 18\n\nTime: 10:30 p.m. ET\n\nAttendance: 56,355 / 35,686 (92,041)\n\nThe EA SPORTS™ Maui Invitational® 'Surfboards Across America' program visited Provo, UT and San Diego, CA on Saturday night, as the Cougars and Aztecs basketball teams joined their classmates on the gridiron.\n\nThe BYU basketball team received its surfboard during halftime of the Cougars game against Nevada, while San Diego State cheerleaders showed off their team's surfboard during the Aztecs match up with Hawaii.\n\nWith 56,355 fans in attendance at LaVell Edwards Stadium in Provo for BYU-Nevada, and 35,686 fans at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, more than 92,000 witnessed this weekend's deliveries. In addition, the BYU delivery was shown during the game's national broadcast on ESPN2 and online on WatchESPN.\n\nSocial Media\n\nThe BYU and San Diego State athletic departments partnered with the EA SPORTS™ Maui Invitational® to promote the presentation through social media outlets. The official Aztec athletics Twitter account (@GoAztecs) tweeted a photo to 18,100 followers on Saturday.\n\nAlso on Saturday, the EA SPORTS Maui Invitational Twitter account (@EASPORTSMauiInv) tweeted a photo of the BYU surfboard presentation. The post was retweeted by both the Official BYU Athletics (@BYUCougars) and BYU Basketball (@BYUbasketball) accounts, which have a combined following of 48,300.\n\nBetween the two posts, the surfboard deliveries reached more than 85,000 Twitter accounts between the time of the original posts and Monday.\n\nRivalry Renewed\n\nFormer conference rivals in the Mountain West, BYU and San Diego State renew their series in the tournament's opening round on November 24. In his tournament preview, ESPN college basketball analyst Seth Greenberg shared his thoughts on the opening round match up.\n\n\"To me, when I think BYU-San Diego State, you have to think about guys like Jimmer Fredette and Kawhi Leonard, but this will be a great matchup. One team, San Diego State, is terrific defensively, while the other is terrific offensively, led by Tyler Haws, one of the nation's top scorers last year,\" Greenberg said.\n\nSee the rest of Seth Greenberg's tournament preview here.\n\n'Surfboards Across America' Program\n\nDuring the 2013-14 basketball season, the EA SPORTS Maui Invitational tournament team delivered surfboards to each of the seven mainland teams participating in the Championship Round during top home games, several of which were broadcast on ESPN. Since, surfboard presentations have taken place at Purdue's Homecoming football game, CSUN's Matador Madness and at adidas Hoops Clinics presented by Hawaiian Airlines with Chaminade."
