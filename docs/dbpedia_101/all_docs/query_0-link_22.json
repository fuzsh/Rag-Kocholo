        "text": "Men's Basketball 11/11/2014 10:50:00 AM\n\n2014-15 Season Outlook: Chaminade Silverswords\n\nQuick Links\n\nChaminade Basketball Homepage\n\n2014-15 Chaminade Schedule\n\n2014-15 Chaminade Roster\n\nGoing into the 2013-14 season, no one was quite sure what to expect from the Chaminade University basketball team, having lost four starters including the conference player of the year from the previous season. The team gelled at the right time and captured the 2014 Pacific West Conference Tournament championship, reaching the NCAA West Regional for the second straight season, a feat never before accomplished in the history of the program.\n\nExpectations will be high this season with three starters and 11 returning lettermen. Among them is three-time all-PacWest senior guard Lee Bailey, who received first-team All-Conference honors last season and was the PacWest Tournament Most Valuable Player. Last season, Bailey became only the 13th player in school history to surpass 1,000 career points.\n\nSophomore guard Kuany Kuany exploded on the scene last season and quickly made a name for himself, logging eight double-doubles and earning six weekly conference honors, including Freshman of the Week honors four times. Sophomore guard Kiran Shastri also excelled during his first season in a Silverswords uniform, leading the PacWest in 3-pointers made with 93, while shooting nearly 44 percent from long distance.\n\nAlso returning are junior guards James Harper and Kevin Hu. Harper, who joined Shastri as one of the conference's top long-distance shooters, came into his own late in the season. He was instrumental in the Silverswords' run in the PacWest Tournament, scoring a tournament-high 31 points in their win in the championship game. Meanwhile, Hu received valuable playing experience at the FIBA Asia Cup during the summer, helping lead Chinese Taipei to a runner-up finish.\n\nSenior guard A.J. Mathew provides quality depth in the backcourt and performed well when the team needed him most. Notably, Mathew provided critical minutes in the PacWest Tournament championship game after Bailey was saddled with second-half foul trouble. At 6-10, senior forward Frankie Eteuati averaged 1.1 blocks per game last season, putting him among the PacWest leaders in that category.\n\nChaminade also added talented newcomers in junior college transfers David Ware and Oscar Pedroso as well as Jacksonville State transfer Michael Louder.\n\nCoach Eric Bovaird, who is in his fourth season at the helm for the Silverswords, has 49 career wins coming into the season, the fourth-highest in program history.\n\nChaminade hosts the 31st annual EA SPORTS Maui Invitational. The Silverswords will take on Pittsburgh in the third game of the Championship Round on November 24 at 9 p.m. ET on ESPNU. Pittsburgh and Chaminade join Arizona, BYU, Kansas State, Missouri, Purdue and San Diego State at the Lahaina Civic Center in Maui from November 24-26.\n\nYou can follow live updates and interact with the Tournament on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram at @EASPORTSMauiInv and with the Tournament's official hashtag, #mauihoops.\n\nNext up: 2014-15 Season Outlook: BYU Cougars"
