        "text": "PROVO, Utah – The NCAA Tournament has not been kind to BYU basketball.\n\nBYU holds the distinction of being the program with the most NCAA Tournament appearances without playing in the Final Four.\n\nThe 2024 NCAA Tournament will be BYU’s 31st appearance in the Big Dance.\n\nBYU is 15-33 all-time in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nSince 1979, when the NCAA adopted a seeding format, BYU is 11-23 in the Big Dance.\n\nThe Cougars have appeared in the Sweet 16 twice since 1979. They have played in the Elite Eight once. That was in 1981 with legendary guard Danny Ainge, who was the Naismith Player of the Year that season.\n\nJimmer Fredette led BYU to memorable NCAA Tournament runs in 2010 and 2011. During his senior season, Fredette took BYU to the Sweet 16 after defeating Wofford and Gonzaga.\n\nLooking back at the history of BYU basketball in the NCAA Tournament\n\nBefore the 2024 season, BYU’s last NCAA Tournament appearance was during the COVID season in 2020-21.\n\nIn that year, the NCAA Tournament was based out of Indianapolis and teams were stationed in a “bubble” environment to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nBYU’s last appearance in an NCAA Tournament that COVID-19 didn’t impact was 2015.\n\n1950\n\nWestern Regional Semis (Kansas City): Baylor 56, BYU 55\n\nWestern Consolation (Kansas City): BYU 83, UCLA 62\n\n1951\n\nWest First Round (Kansas City): BYU 68, San Jose State 61\n\nRegional Semifinals (Kansas City): Kansas State 64, BYU 54\n\nWest Consolation (Kansas City): Washington 80, BYU 67\n\n1957\n\nWest Regional Semifinals (Corvallis, Oregon): California 86, BYU 59\n\nWest Regional Consolation (Corvallis): BYU 65, Idaho State 54\n\n1965\n\nWest Regional Semifinals (Provo): UCLA 100, BYU 76\n\nWest Regional Consolation (Provo): Oklahoma City 112, BYU 102\n\n1969\n\nWest First Round (Las Cruces, New Mexico): New Mexico State 74, BYU 62\n\n1971\n\nWest First Round (Logan): BYU 91, Utah State 82\n\nWest Reg. Semifinals (Salt Lake City): UCLA 91, BYU 73\n\nWest Reg. Consolation (Salt Lake City): Pacific 84, BYU 81\n\n1972\n\nWest First Round (Pocatello, Idaho): Long Beach State 95, BYU 90\n\n1979\n\nWest Second Round (Tucson): (4) San Francisco 86, (5) BYU 63\n\n1980\n\nWest Second Round (Ogden): (6) Clemson 71, (3) BYU 66\n\n1981 (Elite 8 run in the NCAA Tournament)\n\nEast Regional (Providence, Rhode Island)\n\n(6) BYU 60, (11) Princeton 51\n\n(6) BYU 78, (3) UCLA 55\n\nEast Regional Semifinals (Atlanta)\n\n(6) BYU 51, (2) Notre Dame 50\n\nEast Regional Final (Atlanta)\n\n(1) Virginia 74, (6) BYU 60\n\nThe deepest run in the NCAA Tournament in BYU basketball history. Danny Ainge going coast-to-coast against Notre Dame to send BYU to the Elite Eight is an iconic moment in BYU history and March Madness lore.\n\n1984\n\nMideast Regional (Birmingham, Alabama)\n\n(8) BYU 84, (9) UAB 68\n\n(1) Kentucky 93, (8) BYU 68\n\n1987\n\nSE First Round (Birmingham): (7) New Orleans 83, (10) BYU 79\n\n1988\n\nMideast Regional (Birmingham): (4) BYU 98, (13) UNC-Charlotte 92 (OT)\n\n(5) Louisville 97, (4) BYU 76\n\n1990\n\nEast First Round (Hartford): (5) Clemson 49, (12) BYU 47\n\n1991\n\nWest First Round (Salt Lake City): (10) BYU 61, (7) Virginia 48\n\nWest Second Round (Salt Lake City): (2) Arizona 76, (10) BYU 61\n\nThe last time BYU defeated a single-digit seed was in Salt Lake City against 7-seed Virginia.\n\n1992\n\nWest First Round (Boise): (7) LSU 94, (10) BYU 83\n\nShaquille O’Neal put together a record-setting triple-double that included 11 blocks against BYU.\n\n1993\n\nMidwest First Round (Chicago): (7) BYU 80, (10) SMU 71\n\nMidwest Second Round (Chicago): (2) Kansas 90, (7) BYU 76\n\n1995\n\nMidwest First Round (Memphis): (9) Tulane 76, (8) BYU 70\n\n2001\n\nWest First Round (San Diego): (5) Cincinnati 84, (12) BYU 59\n\nIt was an accomplishment for BYU to make the NCAA Tournament after five years prior, finishing with a 1-25 record. The stage appeared too big against a red-hot Cincinnati team led by Steve Logan.\n\n2003\n\nSouth First Round (Spokane): (5) Connecticut 58, (12) BYU 53\n\nThe NCAA Selection Committee mistakenly placed BYU in a Friday/Sunday regional. If BYU had advanced to the Sweet 16, they would have switched regionals. UConn saved the committee from an embarrassing mistake.\n\n2004\n\nPhoenix Region (Denver): (5) Syracuse 80, (12) BYU 75\n\nBYU built an 11-point lead against Syracuse’s vaunted 2-3 zone. The defending National Champions switched to man defense and Gerry McNamara scored 43 on BYU.\n\n2007\n\nSouth First Round (Lexington): (9) Xavier 79, (8) BYU 77\n\n2008\n\nWest First Round (Anaheim): (9) Texas A&M 67, (8) BYU 62\n\nThe signs of Jimmer Fredette being special emerged in this game as Fredette stepped in off the bench to give BYU a lift after an abysmal start against Texas A&M.\n\n2009\n\nWest First Round (Philadelphia): (9) Texas A&M 79, (8) BYU 66\n\nA rare rematch in the NCAA Tournament. Like the first meeting, BYU was no match for the Aggies.\n\n2010\n\nWest First Round (Oklahoma City): (7) BYU 95, (10) Florida 85 (2OT)\n\nWest Second Round (Oklahoma City): (2) Kansas State 84, (7) BYU 72\n\nBYU’s first NCAA Tournament win in 17 years took heroic efforts from Jimmer Fredette and Mike Lloyd Jr. Who can forget Jimmer laying on the court waving to the camera?\n\n2011 (Sweet 16)\n\nSoutheast Second Round (Denver): (3) BYU 74, (14) Wofford 66\n\nThird Round (Denver): (3) BYU 89, (11) Gonzaga (67)\n\nSemifinals (New Orleans): (2) Florida 83, (3) BYU 74 (Overtime)\n\nBYU reached its first Sweet 16 in 30 years. But it’s a year of what could have been? When BYU suspended Brandon Davies for the season, it took away any chance of BYU reaching the Final Four.\n\nThey fell in overtime to Florida in a rematch game from the previous year.\n\n2012\n\nWest First Round (Dayton): (14) BYU 78, (14) Iona 72\n\nWest Second Round (Louisville): (3) Marquette 88, (14) BYU 68\n\nBYU pulled off an epic 25-point comeback to storm back against the Iona Gaels. Their good luck ran out as they lost to Jae Crowder and Marquette in Louisville.\n\n2014\n\nWest Second Round (Milwaukee): (7) Oregon 87, (10) BYU 68\n\nBYU was viewed as a team that would slide into Dayton if they made the NCAA Tournament. Instead, they were comfortably in the field of 68, avoiding Dayton altogether.\n\nThe only problem is that they were tasked with a rematch against an Oregon team that beat BYU in the regular season.\n\n2015\n\nWest First Four (Dayton): (11) Ole Miss 94, (11) BYU 90\n\nBYU gave up a 17-point lead as Ole Miss put on a slam dunk contest en route to taking down the Cougars.\n\n2021\n\nFirst Round (Indianapolis): (11) UCLA 73, (6) BYU 62\n\nBYU was a sizable favorite against UCLA. The Bruins defeated Michigan State in the First Four, but unlike previous First Four teams, the Bruins didn’t have to travel as the NCAA Tournament was played throughout Indianapolis.\n\nThey had a game under their belt to get confidence, and Johnny Juzang and Jaime Jaquez tore BYU apart in the Big Dance’s first round.\n\n2024\n\nWe will find out on Selection Sunday.\n\nMitch Harper is a BYU Insider for KSLsports.com and hosts the Cougar Tracks Podcast (SUBSCRIBE) and Cougar Sports Saturday (12–3 p.m.) on KSL Newsradio.
