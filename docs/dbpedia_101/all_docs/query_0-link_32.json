        "text": "Nov. 10, 2014\n\nLong Beach, Calif. -\n\nLong Beach State Men's Basketball Game Notes (BYU)\n\nGame: Long Beach State. at BYU\n\nDate: Friday, November 14\n\nTime: 6:00 p.m., MST\n\nLocation: Provo, Utah\n\nArena: Marriott Center (20,951)\n\nTV: BYUtv\n\nTV Talent: TBA\n\nRadio: KBEACH.org; HD 88.1-3\n\nRadio Talent: Rob Brender\n\nWebcast: Cougar IMG Sports Network\n\nLive Stats: byucougars.com\n\nRIGHT AWAY\n\n LBSU opens up the 2014-15 season on the road for just the second time under Dan Monson - the last was also at BYU, in the last meeting between the teams, a 75-65 loss for the Beach.\n\n Senior Mike Caffey was named preseason All-Big West entering the year. The star point guard led Long Beach State with 16.2 points per game and 4.3 assists per game in 2013-14, and is a two-time first-team All-Big West selection, earning the honor following his sophomore and junior seasons. Caffey can join Larry Anderson, Francois Wise, and Ed Ratleff as the only 49er to be a three-time First-Team All-Big West honoree.\n\n The Beach features one of the best backcourts not just in the Big West but in the entire West Coast. Mike Caffey and Tyler Lamb each earned All-Big West honors last season, and combined to average 31.6 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.4 steals per game last season.\n\n Long Beach State returns 78% of its scoring from last year - Leading scorers Caffey and Lamb lead a veteran squad that has eight letterwinners returning from a season ago, as well as three starters in Caffey, Lamb, and David Samuels, while a fourth returner, A.J. Spencer, is out of the season with a knee injury.\n\n Head Coach Dan Monson begins the 2014-15 campaign with 119 wins at Long Beach State, needing four to pass Basketball Hall of Famer Jerry Tarkanian for the most as the head coach of the 49ers. Monson received a contract extension this offseason, and is committed to the Beach through the 2018-19 season.\n\n Under Monson, Long Beach State has finished in the top three in the Big West in each of the last six seasons, and has reached at least the semifinals in the Big West Tournament as well. Long Beach State was picked to finish in third place in the preseason Big West Media Poll, behind UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara.\n\nTHE PLAYERS\n\n Long Beach State begins the 2014-15 season with a full complement of players, the first year since 2011-12 that the 49ers don't have a midseason transfer waiting in the wings -- the last time that the Beach reached the NCAA Tournament. In 2012-13, Keala King and Tony Freeland were late additions, while Tyler Lamb and Travis Hammonds joined the team midway through last season.\n\n The arrival of Lamb and Hammonds sparked a turnaround in last season's fortunes. After posting a record of 1-9 through 10 games, Lamb scored 20 points to help the Beach take down USC 72-71, the first win of a 14-8 run through the remainder of the season. Before the arrival of Lamb and Hammonds, the team was averaging 64.1 points per game while allowing 75.1 -- That turned around to 72.5 points per game scored and 68.4 points allowed over the final 22 games of the year.\n\n The 49ers will feature one new Division I transfer in 2014-15 in Eric McKnight. McKnight graduated from Florida Gulf Coast, allowing the senior to transfer without an NCAA delay. Part of FGCU's #DunkCity Sweet 16 run as a starter, McKnight averaged 6.9 points and 5.1 rebounds per game last season for the Eagles, and will immediately impact the 49er frontcourt.\n\n Long Beach State's other frontcourt starter will be David Samuels, entering his senior season after starting 29 games for the Beach as a junior college transfer last season. Samuels took some time to adjust, but ended the season averaging 6.1 points and 5.4 points per game. The forward played his best in some big games, putting up three double-doubles. Samuels went for 15 and 11 against NC State, and then closed the year with 12 points and 12 rebounds in the Big West Tournament Semifinals against CSUN.\n\n The likeliest candidate to round out the starting five is sophomore guard Branford Jones. Jones suffered a season-ending injury in his first game as a 49er, returning last season for his first full campaign with tthe49ers, starting eight games before the debut of Tyler Lamb with the Beach. Jones averaged 5.8 points per game in an 18.6 minute per contest average, and was second on the team in total assists one year ago behind Mike Caffey with 59. He also led the team in 3-point shooting percentage at 37.2 percent.\n\n Two other major contributors from last season's squad return in senior McKay LaSalle and sophomore Travis Hammonds. Both players shot over 30 percent from beyond the arc, with LaSalle hitting 24 on the year and starting six games at guard. The versatile Hammonds started a pair of games, and played both on the wing and on the post, averaging 6.5 points per game, and hitting the game-winner in a thilling contest against Hawai'i. His 19 steals were also fourth on the team in just 20 games played.\n\n The 49ers also add four incoming freshman from the state of California, with all four reaching the CIF championship game last season with their respective High School programs. All four will be expected to contribute immediately, with comparisons immediately apparent to the last time the Beach brought in four freshman, the group of Larry Anderson, Eugene Phelps, T.J. Robinson, and Casper Ware, who led LBSU to three straight Big West championships. Justin Bibbins is a speedy point guard who will spell Caffey at the point guard position. Deontae North is an excellent scorer who joins an excellent group on the wing. Jack Williams is a great rebounder who will join the 49ers rotation at forward right away, while Temidayo Yussuf is a big body on the post who will back up Samuels and McKnight.\n\n Additional depth for the 49ers will come from guards Alex Rifkind and Anson Moye, along with Charles Lockett, the son of the former 49er football star of the same name.\n\n Long Beach State will have three players miss this season - Senior A.J. Spencer is out for the year with an ACL tear, while Nick Faust (Maryland) and Roschon Prince (USC) can practice with the team, but must sit out this season as NCAA Division I transfers.\n\nTHIS AND THAT\n\n As usual under Monson, Long Beach State will again face one of the toughest non-conference schedules in the country. Four teams (Texas, Louisville, San Diego State, Syracuse) on the Beach schedule are ranked in the preseason poll, while four more (UCLA, Kansas State, BYU, Stephen F. Austin) are also receiving votes in the AP poll entering the year. Long Beach State also faces Xavier and St. John's on the road, hosts Nevada, and will participate in the DirecTV Wooden Legacy.\n\n Long Beach State will face at least seven teams from the Power 6 conferences this season, starting with their trip to Xavier as a non-bracketed game in the Wooden Legacy. Under Dan Monson, the 49ers boast five wins against Power 6 teams, including beating one on this year's schedule, UCLA. The 49ers also previously beat Xavier while the Musketeers were a member of the Atlantic 10 conference.\n\n Long Beach State is scheduled for up to 22 national broadcasts this season - Nearly 70% of the team's games even before the Big West Tournament. 22 television games would break last season's record of 21, as the Beach continues to gain additional exposure."
