Picked to finish ninth in the preseason, the Bluejays went 9-9 in league play and finished sixth in the BIG EAST this year.\n\nThe Bluejays are averaging 79.6 points per game and are 15-1 when scoring 80 or more points this season.\n\nSecond Team All-BIG EAST guard Maurice Watson Jr. leads the conference with 6.5 assists per contest and Creighton with 14.2 points per game, while Geoffrey Groselle tops the club with 6.1 rebounds per game and is third with 10.9 points per game. He's shooting 69.7 percent from the field this year, second nationally among players with at least five attempts per game.\n\nCole Huff (11.1 ppg.) has been in double-figures in eight of the last 11 games, including a career-high 35 points vs. Seton Hall in the BIG EAST Tournament, while James Milliken (9.7 ppg.) has scored 103 points in his last six games and played some of his best basketball in March the past two seasons.\n\nScouting BYU\n\nBYU is 25-10 this season, including a 15-2 mark at home. The Cougars went 13-5 in the West Coast Conference, finishing third behind Saint Mary's and Gonzaga.\n\nChase Fischer (18.3 ppg.), Nick Emery (16.2 ppg.) and Kyle Collinsworth (15.3 ppg.) give the Cougars one of the highest-scoring trio's in the college game.\n\nFischer has made 109 three-pointers and made big play after big play down the stretch of BYU's 80-77 win over Virginia Tech on Friday.\n\nCollinsworth owns the NCAA single-season (6) and career (12) records for triple-doubles and leads the team in rebounds (8.4 rpg.), assists (7.6 apg.) and steals (1.9 spg.) per contest.\n\nThe Cougars are +4.8 on the glass and shoot 46.4 percent from the field, 38.4 percent from three-point range and 68.9 percent from the line.\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) is in his sixth season as head coach at Creighton. He is 141-71 with the Bluejays. McDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000). He owns a career mark of 421-266 in his 22nd season and is 290-202 in his 15th Division I campaign. McDermott is assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Preston Murphy.\n\nDave Rose (Houston, 1983) is in his 11th season at BYU, where he owns a 282-98 mark. The former co-captain of Houston's famed \"Phi Slamma Jamma\" national runner-up is assisted by Andrew May, Terry Nashif and Tim LaComb.\n\nThe Series With BYU\n\nBYU leads the all-time series with Creighton, 6-3, including a 2-0 mark in Provo.\n\nThe teams last met on Dec. 1, 2010 in a game that featured future National Players of the Year Jimmer Fredette (BYU) and Doug McDermott (Creighton). BYU won that game, 77-65, but Fredette was held to a season-low 13 points in the contest.\n\nGreg McDermott is 1-3 in his career against the current West Coast Conference membership, with the lone win coming over Loyola Marymount.\n\nMcDermot is 0-1 against BYU and teams coached by Dave Rose.\n\nLots Has Changed Since Last Meeting\n\nThe last time these teams met in 2010, it was part of the Mountain West-Missouri Valley Conference Challenge Series. BYU has since left the MWC for the West Coast Conference, while Creighton left The Valley to join the BIG EAST Conference.\n\nThat last meeting also featured a pair of eventual National Player of the Year winners.\n\nThe 2013-14 National Player of the Year Doug McDermott (Creighton) was a freshman for Creighton in that contest, while 2010-11 NPOY Jimmer Fredette (BYU) was a senior.\n\nFredette was held to a season-low 13 points in that game, while McDermott had 20 points and 12 rebounds in becoming the first Bluejay freshman since 1988 to record a double-double.\n\nOnly One Name Needed\n\nAlums Doug McDermott and Jimmer Fredette each are considered among the all-time greats in their respective program, and among the nation's best players in the last decade.\n\nBoth men swept the National Player of the Year awards as seniors, appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, and are among the NCAA's all-time scoring leaders (McDermott is 5th, Fredette 35th).\n\nMcDermott and Fredette are among 13 players in the last 22 years who have scored 900 points or more in a college season, a list that also includes the likes of Stephen Curry (twice), Kemba Walker, J.J. Redick, Allen Iverson, Adam Morrison and Kevin Durant.\n\nHere's a closer look at their basketball stats:\n\nCategory McDermott Fredette\n\nCollege Games 145 139\n\nCollege Points 3,150 2,599\n\nCollege Points/Game 21.7 18.7\n\nCollege Rebounds 1,088 367\n\nCollege Assists 194 515\n\nCollege 3FG Made 274 296\n\nCollege 3FG Percentage .458 .394\n\nNBA Draft 11th (2014) 10th (2011)\n\nNBA Games 103 235\n\nNBA Points 759 1,416\n\nNBA Points/Game 7.4 6.0\n\nNBA 3FG Made 111 193\n\nNBA 3FG Percentage .413 .381\n\nWatson Nears 500/200 Club\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. enters Tuesday's game with 483 points and 220 assists. With 17 points, he can become the first player in CU history with 500 points and 200 assists in the same season.\n\nCurrently, the only man to ever score 500 points and dish 160 or more assists in the same year is Antoine Young, who did so with 511 points and 195 assists in 2010-11 when he was also a junior under Greg McDermott.\n\nNationally, through games of Saturday, Watson was one of nine players nationally had both 480 points and 200 or more assists this season, as seen below. That list includes BYU's Kyle Collinsworth.\n\n480 Points & 200 Assists in 2015-16 (through 3/19)\n\nName, School Assists Points\n\nKay Felder, Oakland 296 773\n\nKyle Collinsworth, BYU 266 537\n\nJaaron Simmons, Ohio 260 502\n\nTyler Ulis, Kentucky 246 606\n\nJuan'ya Green, Hofstra 243 606\n\nDenzel Valentine, Michigan State 241 595\n\nMaurice Watson Jr., Creighton 220 483\n\nKris Dunn, Providence 206 542\n\nDallas Moore, North Florida 205 672\n\n20 Wins, Again\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games for the 16th time in 18 seasons, a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust three schools nationally have had 20 or more wins each of the last 18 years: Duke, Gonzaga and Kansas.\n\nKentucky , Florida, Texas and Syracuse have each done it in 17 of the last 18 seasons.\n\nAlong with Arizona, Xavier and Connecticut, Creighton is one of four schools with 20 or more wins in exactly 16 of the past 18 years.\n\n20-Win Seasons, Since 1998-99 (through 3/19)\n\n20+ Win 2015-16 Next\n\nSeasons Team W-L Game\n\n18 Kansas 32-4 3/24\n\n18 Gonzaga 28-7 3/25\n\n18 Duke 25-10 3/24\n\n17 Kentucky 27-9 Done\n\n17 Florida 20-14 3/20\n\n17 Texas 20-13 Done\n\n17 Syracuse 20-13 3/20\n\n16 Xavier 28-5 3/20\n\n16 Arizona 25-9 Done\n\n16 Connecticut 25-11 Done\n\n16 Creighton 20-14 3/22\n\nPlaying With The Lead\n\nBoth Creighton and BYU have spent the majority of the NIT with a lead.\n\nCreighton trailed for 7:11 against Alabama and just 35 seconds vs. Wagner.\n\nBYU trailed for 7:08 against Virginia Tech in the second round after never trailing in the first round.\n\nCreighton has owned a lead at some point in each of its last 42 games, dating to an 84-66 setback at St. John's late last season.\n\nWith A Win...\n\n-Creighton would win its third straight game, tying a season-high win streak, and improve to 21-14.\n\n-Secure a trip to Madison Square Garden for the second time this month, the first BIG EAST team to do so since 2008-09 (Notre Dame)\n\n-Reach the NIT semifinals for the first time, but the semifinals of a postseason tournament for the third time in the last seven seasons.\n\n-Win a third straight postseason game for the second time in program history, joining the 2011 run to the CBI Finals when CU won four straight.\n\n-Improve Greg McDermott to 10-5 in the postseason at Creighton, and 142-71 overall.\n\n-Give Creighton an NIT win away from home for the first time since 1942.\n\n-Give Creighton its first true road win in the school's postseason history.\n\nGarden Reunion?\n\nWith a win at BYU, Creighton would clinch a trip to Madison Square Garden for the second time this month. CU played Seton Hall at the \"World's Most Famous Arena\" on March 10th in the quarterfinals of the BIG EAST Tournament.\n\nPrior to joining the BIG EAST, Creighton had not played at the current Madison Square Garden facility since it opened in 1967.\n\nHowever, since joining the BIG EAST in the summer of 2013, Creighton has played there eight times (six BIG EAST Tournament games, twice vs. St. John's), going 3-5.\n\nCreighton did reach previous versions of Madison Square Garden in both the 1942 and 1943 NIT's.\n\nMaking A Jump\n\nCreighton has gone from 14-19 last year to 20-14 so far this season. In the last 50 seasons of Creighton basketball, there's only been four seasons where the team has made a bigger leap from one year to the next:\n\nBiggest Win Improvements, Last 50 Years\n\nJump Year W-L Year W-L\n\n+8 1972-73 15-11 1973-74 23-7\n\n+7 1986-87 9-19 1987-88 16-16\n\n+7 1994-95 7-19 1995-96 14-15\n\n+6 2001-02 23-9 2002-03 29-5\n\n+6 2010-11 23-16 2011-12 29-6\n\n+6 2014-15 14-19 2015-16 20-14\n\nDefense Wins Championships\n\nCreighton has made its name over the years for its offensive prowess, shooting ability and \"Let It Fly\" philosophy, but this year's team has done its best work in the NIT on the defensive side of the court.\n\nCreighton held Alabama to 28.3 percent shooting from the floor, and 54 points overall, last Tuesday. Those two figures led all NIT teams on the defensive end in the first round of the postseason.\n\nIn a second round win over Wagner, Creighton held the Seahawks to 27.9 percent shooting from the field and 54 points overall. The 27.9 percent shooting is the second-best defensive effort by the Bluejays in the six-year Greg McDermott era.\n\nThis is also the first time since November 23 & 25, 2014, that Creighton has held consecutive opponents to 54 points or less. CU has not held three straight foes to 54 or less since December of 2010.\n\nThrough games of Saturday, Creighton leads all teams in the NIT in scoring defense (54.0), field goal percentage defense (.281) and rebound margin (+16.0).\n\nSome Loyal Fans\n\nCreighton attracted 302,887 fans at home this season, surpassing 200,000 fans for the 11th straight season. The 302,887 home fans this season ranks as the most in school history.\n\nCreighton had never attracted more than 141,000 home fans in any season prior to the opening of CenturyLink Center Omaha, and now has done it in 13 straight seasons.\n\nCreighton has led its conference in home attendance every year since moving into CenturyLink Center Omaha, which is now in its 13th season.\n\nCreighton's Most Home Fans, Season\n\nRk.

Thomas came out strong early and in the second half threw down his first dunk since December.\n\nThe Omaha native continued his resurgence on Saturday with 13 points, four rebounds and two assists in the victory over Wagner.\n\nIt marks the first time in the freshman's college career he's scored in double-figures in consecutive games.\n\nThomas averaged 2.6 points and 2.8 rebounds on 20 percent shooting from three-point range against BIG EAST teams this winter, compared to 10.4 points and 4.9 rebounds on 63.0 percent shooting from three-point range against teams not in the BIG EAST. All 12 of his dunks this season have come in non-conference play.\n\nOpponents PPG RPG 3FG% Dunks\n\nvs. BE Teams 2.6 2.8 .200 0\n\nNon-BE Teams 10.4 4.9 .630 12\n\nConfident Khyri\n\nHead coach Greg McDermott was quick to point out the importance the NIT will have on Khyri Thomas' confidence moving forward.\n\n\"Outside the experience for the seniors of getting to play extra games, his play in these two games is the most valuable thing that's happened. Because of where he was mentally and from a confidence standpoint, and how he's been able to flip it against teams that have had really good seasons. We're not playing slouches...Khyri's put two together back-to-back, which probably hasn't happened since December. Moving forward for him into the offseason, it's incredible the impact it will have on him.\"\n\nAccuracy, Thy Name Is Geoffrey\n\nGeoffrey Groselle was 7-for-7 vs. Wagner and has made 30-of-38 field goals during the last six games, upping his league-best accuracy to 69.7 percent of his field goal attempts from the field (138-198).\n\nHe recently surpassed the minimum 300 attempts required to qualify for Creighton's career leaders in field goal percentage.\n\nGroselle enters Tuesday's NIT quarterfinal having made 224-of-329 career shots from the field, good for 68.1 percent. Creighton's all-time leader in field goal percentage had been Gregory Echenique, who made 62.5 percent (374-598).\n\nGroselle could etch his name into the single-season record book for field goal percentage in a season with two or more field goal attempts on Tuesday. Groselle, at 69.7 percent (138-198), would rank first on the list as long as he takes multiple attempts and doesn't go 0-for-7 or worse.\n\nField Goal Percentage, Career (min. 300 att.)\n\nRank Pct.

This year marks Creighton's first trip to the NIT since 2009, when it topped Bowling Green 73-71 before falling to Kentucky, 65-63.\n\nCreighton had gone 1-1 in each of its previous three NIT appearances (2009, 2008, 2006), and hasn't won a NIT game away from home since a March 25, 1942 victory vs. Toledo at Madison Square Garden (the one that was open from 1925-68).\n\nMake It A Double\n\nCreighton has 12 all-time wins in 19 NCAA Tournament appearances and seven wins in 11 NIT appearances (including this year), but this season is the first time the Bluejays have never won consecutive postseason games in the same year in either of those tournaments.\n\nCreighton did start 2-0 in the 2010 CIT and 4-0 in the 2011 CBI.\n\nMcDermott In The NIT\n\nAt the Division I level Greg McDermott has taken six teams to the NCAA Tournament and one to the CBI, but this is his first time coaching a team in the NIT.\n\nMcDermott is 9-8 in his Division I career in the postseason, including a 2-0 NIT mark. He was 0-3 at Northern Iowa and is 9-5 at Creighton.\n\nCommon Opponents?\n\nCreighton and BYU share no common opponents this season.\n\nAgainst Postseason Qualifiers\n\nCreighton is 6-9 against teams that qualified for the postseason, including a 3-9 mark against NCAA qualifiers (wins over Xavier, Butler and Seton Hall), and a 3-0 mark against NIT qualifiers (Texas Southern, Alabama and Wagner).\n\nBYU went 8-7 against teams that qualified for the postseason. That includes a 3-4 mark over NCAA qualifiers (defeating Weber State, Northern Iowa and Gonzaga), a 4-2 mark vs. NIT teams (defeating Belmont, Saint Mary's, UAB and Virginia Tech) and a 1-1 record over CBI qualifier Pepperdine.\n\nBIG EAST History In The NIT\n\nCreighton was the only BIG EAST team selected to the 2016 NIT.\n\nThe BIG EAST did not send any teams to the NIT last year. In 2013-14, Georgetown went 1-1 in the NIT, while St. John's was 0-1.\n\nThe last BIG EAST team to make the trek to Madison Square Garden to play in the NIT semifinals was Notre Dame in 2008-09.\n\nThe last BIG EAST team to win a postseason tournament in men's basketball was Louisville, which won the NCAA Tournament in 2012-13. No BIG EAST team has won the NIT since West Virginia in 2006-07.\n\nThe BIG EAST has picked up multiple postseason victories every season since the formation of the league in 1979-80.\n\nBack In The Postseason\n\nCreighton is returning to the postseason for the 18th time in 19 years this spring.\n\nThat span includes 10 NCAA Tournament appearances, six NIT appearances (including 2016), one CBI and one CIT appearance.\n\nPrior to last year's postseason miss, Creighton had been one of eight teams to make 17 straight postseason appearances. That elite list consisted of Creighton, Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan State and Syracuse.\n\nMost Postseason Bids By CU Coaches\n\nThis year's bid to the NIT is the fifth postseason bid for Greg McDermott at Creighton. Only Dana Altman (13) has taken the Bluejays to more postseason appearances.\n\nMcDermott's nine postseason wins at Creighton are the most in school history, two more than Altman's seven.\n\nMcDermott (9-5) is one of two coaches in program history with a winning record in postseason play, joining Eddie Sutton (2-1).\n\nCoach (Bids) NCAA NIT CBI CIT NCIT Total\n\nHickey (3) 1-1 2-2 0-0 0-0 0-0 3-3\n\nBelford (1) 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-1 0-1\n\nMcManus (3) 3-3 0-0 0-0 0-0 1-1 4-4\n\nSutton (1) 2-1 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-0 2-1\n\nApke (4) 0-3 0-1 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-4\n\nBarone (3) 1-2 0-1 0-0 0-0 0-0 1-3\n\nAltman (13) 2-7 3-5 0-0 2-1 0-0 7-13\n\nMcDermott (5) 3-3 2-0 4-2 0-0 0-0 9-5\n\nHome Sweet NIT Home\n\nIf past years are any indication, having the home-court advantage during the NIT is a tremendous factor. Since the NIT was trimmed to 32 teams and taken over by the NCAA in 2007, home-court teams are a combined 201-67 in the event.\n\nIn the last 10 years, home teams are 123-37 in the first round, 58-18 in the second round (through 3/20) and 23-13 in the quarterfinals.\n\nHome Court Records, NIT, By Round\n\nYear Rd. 1 Rd. 2 Rd. 3 Total\n\n2007 13-3 7-1 4-0 24-4\n\n2008 13-3 7-1 1-3 21-7\n\n2009 13-3 6-2 3-1 22-6\n\n2010 11-5 6-2 1-3 18-10\n\n2011 13-3 4-4 4-0 21-7\n\n2012 10-6 5-3 2-2 17-11\n\n2013 12-4 8-0 1-3 21-7\n\n2014 12-4 6-2 4-0 22-6\n\n2015 12-4 6-2 3-1 21-7\n\n2016 14-2 3-1* 0-0 17-3\n\nTotals 123-37 58-18 23-13 204-68*\n\n*through 3/20\n\nCenturyLink Center Home To Some Close Games\n\nLast Saturday was Creighton's 12th postseason game at the 13-year-old CenturyLink Center Omaha. Three of the 12 games were decided by a single point, and two others were decided by just two points.\n\nCreighton has won eight of its last nine postseason home games at CenturyLink Center Omaha, and 10 of the last 11 postseason games at home if you factor in two 2010 CIT games that were played at the Omaha Civic Auditorium.\n\nCreighton's Postseason Games,\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha History\n\nDate Att.

The Fighting Illini won that game, 66-62.\n\nCreighton has suited up -- and played -- all 11 men in uniform in each of its first two NIT games this March.\n\nPostseason Wins In Eight Straight Appearances\n\nIncluding last Tuesday's NIT win over Alabama, the Creighton men's basketball team has won a postseason game in eight straight appearances.\n\nThat figure is easily the longest streak in school history.\n\nPostseason Features Last-Second Drama\n\nEleven of Creighton's previous 13 postseason runs (all but 2010 and 2014) have included a game that was decided in the final seconds.\n\nIn fact, Creighton's past 14 postseason openers have had four games decided by one point (including a double-OT finish), two by two points, one game by four points, two by six points (including an OT finish), one game by 10 points, three games by 11 points and two decided by 18 points (including 2016).\n\nIn 2013 Cincinnati missed a game-tying three-pointer in the final 20 seconds and Creighton guard Austin Chatman made 3-of-4 free throws down the stretch to hold on to a 67-63 win.\n\nIn 2012 Creighton edged Alabama in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, 58-57, as Trevor Releford's game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer came up short.\n\nCreighton's 2010-11 campaign ended in heartbreaking fashion in the CBI title game at Oregon. Creighton had the ball in a tie game with the shot clock off, but committed a backcourt violation on Oregon's \"unique\" floor. The Ducks' E.J. Singler then banked in a game-winning shot with 2.0 seconds left. A desperation three-pointer by Creighton was off the mark.\n\nIn 2009, Creighton rallied from a 14-point deficit and would hang on to beat Bowling Green, 73-71 in the first round of the NIT. The Jays needed a last-second defensive stand, as BGSU's Darryl Clements' game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer was off the mark.\n\nThe following game, Creighton led Kentucky by one with 36 seconds left, only to miss two free throws and see UK All-American Jodie Meeks convert a three-point play. CU's Booker Woodfox, the nation's No. 2 three-point shooter, missed an open trey as time expired, and Creighton lost 65-63.\n\nIn 2008, Creighton rallied from a 12-point deficit in the final 3:07 to top Rhode Island, 73-72, in the first round of the NIT. Cavel Witter hit the game-winner with 3.2 seconds left to give CU its first lead of the game since 3-0.\n\nIn 2007, Creighton had the ball for a final shot in a tie game against Nevada in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Nate Funk's shot attempt missed, and a tip-in try was also not converted. The Jays would eventually lose 77-71 in overtime.\n\nIn second round of the 2006 NIT, Miami (Fla.) guard Guilermo Diaz drained a free throw with 2.6 seconds left to beat Creighton 53-52. A last-second shot attempt by Bluejay senior Johnny Mathies was knocked out of his hands.\n\nIn the 2005 NCAA Tourney, Nate Funk had his three-point try with seven seconds left blocked by Tyrone Sally, and Sally raced downcourt for a breakaway dunk with 2.4 seconds left to give West Virginia a 63-61 win. Funk's three-point try from the corner missed at the buzzer.\n\nIn 2004, Creighton fell 71-70 to Nebraska in the NIT. The Jays led nearly the entire second half before NU's go-ahead basket with 12 seconds left. Nate Funk's game-winning jumper from 18-feet away was blocked by Husker guard Jake Muhleisen.\n\nIn 2003 Creighton lost 79-73 to Central Michigan in the NCAA's. The Jays trailed 50-24 with 16:24 left but a furious rally got them within two points (72-70) with 1:20 left, only to turn it over the next three possessions.\n\nIn the 2002 NCAA's, Creighton beat #15 Florida, 83-82, in Chicago. Terrell Taylor hit a game-winning trey with 0.2 seconds left in double-overtime, his final three of 28 points after a scoreless first half.\n\nAbout Creighton\n\nCreighton is a private, Jesuit institution located in Omaha, Neb., with 8,435 students. The University was founded in 1878 by Mary Lucretia Creighton, who established it in memory of her husband, telegraph pioneer Edward Creighton.\n\nProminent alumni include J. Joseph Ricketts (Chicago Cubs owner and founder of TD Ameritrade), Bob Gibson (Hall of Fame pitcher), Kyle Korver (professional basketball player) and Pat Venditte (ambidextrous baseball player).\n\nMcDermott In The Postseason\n\nCreighton coach Greg McDermott is making his fifth postseason appearance at Creighton, and seventh overall as a Division I head coach when you include his time at Northern Iowa.\n\nMcDermott's Division I teams own a 9-8 record in eight postseason appearances, including a 9-5 mark in five appearances at Creighton.\n\nMcDermott's Div.

He's averaging 13.2 points per game in that time, along with 7.3 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game.\n\nHuff had 21 points in Creighton's game at Xavier on March 5th, making 8-of-14 shots from the field in his first start since January 12th.\n\nHe then went for a career-high 35 points at the BIG EAST Tournament vs. Seton Hall while making 7-of-11 three-point attempts. He also added nine rebounds without a turnover.\n\nPer Basketball-Reference.com, Huff joined Jared Sullinger and Bobby Portis as the only men in the last six seasons with a game of at least 35 points, nine rebounds and no turnovers with one foul or less.\n\nMultiple Choices\n\nCreighton has four men currently averaging in double-figures, and can add a fifth if James Milliken scores 20 points or more on Tuesday (If Isaiah Zierden plays, he'd need to score three or more points to keep his scoring average at 10.0 or more).\n\nCreighton has had three men finish the season averaging in double-figures just once since 2007-08 (that coming in 2010-11), and has not had four men finish the year in double-figures since 1979-80, when Kevin McKenna, Jim Honz, George Morrow and Daryl Stovall did so.\n\nCreighton has not had as many as five men finish the season scoring with a double-figure average since 1964-65, when Neil Johnson, Elton McGriff, Fritz Pointer, Tim Powers, Bob Miles and Charlie Brown all did so.\n\nNew And Improved\n\nLast season's rare down year saw Creighton finish 14-19 overall, and just 4-14 in the BIG EAST. This year's team is 19-14 overall and 9-9 in league play.\n\nThe Bluejays have already greatly exceeded both win totals from a year ago.\n\nCreighton's five-win improvement in league play this season trailed only Seton Hall (+6) for the best in the BIG EAST this year. The only other team to increase its BIG EAST win total by five or more since the league reconfigured in 2014 had been Butler (+8 in 2014-15).\n\nMilliken Marches On\n\nJames Milliken scored a career-high 26 points on March 2nd at Providence, then added 22 more on March 5th at Xavier. It was the first time in the senior's career that he's had 20 or more points in back-to-back games.\n\nMilliken has scored in double-figures in eight of nine career games he's played during the month of March during his Creighton career, averaging 17.0 points per game in that span.\n\nMilliken is also 27-for-54 (50.0 percent) from three-point range in March during his career.\n\n200 Assist Club Adds Watson\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. owns 220 assists this winter, a figure that ranks second in program history for a single season.\n\nRalph Bobik owns the CU record with 252 assists in 1973-74, and that mark has never been approached.\n\nWatson Nabs All-BIG EAST Honor\n\nJunior point guard Maurice Watson Jr. was named Second Team All-BIG EAST on March 6th, as selected by league coaches.\n\nWatson led Creighton in scoring and led the entire conference in assists.\n\nWatson is just the second Bluejay in program history to be named First or Second Team All-Conference since CU joined the league in 2013-14, joining Player of the Year and First Team honoree Doug McDermott in 2013-14.\n\nWatson is Creighton's first point guard named first or second team all-conference since Antoine Young was named Second Team all-Missouri Valley Conference in 2011-12.\n\nSome Of The Best Wins\n\nCreighton's Feb. 9th win over No. 5 Xavier was the program's eighth all-time victory over a team ranked in the top-10 of the Associated Press poll, and third in the last three seasons.\n\nEach of Creighton's last three wins against top-10 foes have come by 14 points or more.\n\nIt was Greg McDermott's third win over a top-10 foe as Creighton coach, matching the three such wins by Eddie Sutton from 1969-74.\n\nThe Feb. 13th win over Marquette improved Creighton to 7-1 in games following a victory against a top-10 foe.\n\nTop-10 Wins, School History\n\nDate Opponent (Score) Next Game\n\n12/13/1963 #4 Arizona State (84-83) Won\n\n12/01/1965 #10 Kansas State (83-75) Won\n\n01/29/1970 #5 New Mexico State (72-68) Lost\n\n02/17/1973 #7 Houston (78-77) Won\n\n02/09/1974 at #6 Marquette (75-69) Won\n\n01/20/2014 at #4 Villanova (96-68) Won\n\n02/16/2014 #6 Villanova (101-80) Won\n\n02/09/2016 #5 Xavier (70-56) Won\n\nDefense Limits Xavier\n\nCreighton held No. 5 Xavier to a season-low 56 points on Feb. 9th, well under the 80.8 points per game the Musketeers had been averaging.\n\nKeying that defensive effort was limiting Xavier from behind the three-point line, where the Musketeers where 1-for-21.\n\nThat game marked the first Bluejay opponent to make just one three-pointer since Indiana State on March 9, 2013 (1-for-13), and it was the first team to shoot less than 7 percent from three-point range against the Jays since Illinois State was 0-for-8 on Dec. 12, 1999.\n\nCreighton held BIG EAST foes to 29.1 percent marksmanship (44-151) from three-point range in its nine league wins, compared to 37.3 percent (75-201) in its nine league setbacks.\n\nLeague Leaders\n\nCreighton had two men lead the BIG EAST in a statistical category in league play.\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. paced the league with 6.7 assists per game, finishing ahead of Kris Dunn's 5.9. Watson had 15 more assists (121) than any other player in league action.\n\nGeoffrey Groselle owned commanding lead in field goal percentage, having made 65.6 percent of his attempts to rank ahead of Luke Fischer's 61.0 percent.\n\nOn Your Mark, Get Set, Go\n\nCreighton has averaged 79.56 points per game in its first 34 contests to date.\n\nGreg McDermott is 37-1 as a Division I head coach when his teams score 90 or more points, including a 31-1 mark on the Creighton sideline.\n\nIn fact, McDermott's team has already scored 90 or more points 10 times (in 34 games) this season, compared to six total times in 280 games on the sideline in nine years at Northern Iowa and Iowa State.\n\nCreighton had won 75 straight games when scoring 90 or more points at all sites since a Jan. 11, 1988 loss to Southern Illinois, before a March 5th 98-93 loss at Xavier.\n\nCreighton is 53-2 all-time when scoring 100 points or more, including 25 straight wins since a 1977 loss to North Texas State.\n\nBig Win on February 28th\n\nCreighton's 100-59 win over St. John's on Feb. 28th was the program's largest margin of victory since a 107-61 win over Alcorn State on Nov. 8, 2013.\n\nCreighton's 53-24 halftime lead was its largest halftime lead since an identical score vs. Butler on Jan. 14, 2014.\n\nCreighton's 41-point victory was the school's largest in a BIG EAST Conference game, and the fifth-largest margin of victory all-time for a league game. The league's last previous win by 41 or more points came on March 5, 2011, when Syracuse topped DePaul 107-59.\n\nCreighton's 47-21 margin on the backboards was also significant. It was tied for the eighth-largest rebound margin ever for a BIG EAST Conference game, and widest spread since Providence outrebounded Connecticut 55-24 on Jan. 31, 2013. Creighton's +26 rebound margin also tied a CenturyLink Center Omaha record, first set vs. Samford on Dec. 22, 2011 (45-19).\n\nBIG EAST Stat Breakdown\n\nCreighton started the season as one of the BIG EAST's best offensive and worst statistically defensive teams in non-conference play. In league play, those numbers have nearly flipped where CU is now among the league's best on the defensive side of the ball in BIG EAST action.\n\nCreighton's BIG EAST Ranks\n\nNon-Con (Rank) League-Only (Rank)\n\nScoring Offense 87.4 (2) 74.3 (5)\n\nFG Percentage .506 (2) .443 (4)\n\n3FG Percentage .401 (1) .317 (8)\n\nAssists/Game 18.1 (2) 13.5 (7)\n\n3FGM/Game 9.3 (1) 7.4 (5)\n\nScoring Defense 75.2 (10) 71.1 (3)\n\nFG Pct. Defense .440 (10) .434 (5)\n\nMost Improved Big Men?\n\nWith the possible exception of Providence's Ben Bentil, few players around the BIG EAST have improved more than Creighton's Geoffrey Groselle.\n\nGroselle entered his senior season averaging 3.2 points and 1.6 rebounds per contest, collecting 200 career points and 102 career rebounds in his first 63 games. This year Groselle owns 10.9 points and 6.1 rebounds per game and has 371 points and 207 rebounds in 34 games (33 starts).\n\nSenior Day Stars\n\nCreighton honored two senior players following a Feb. 28th win over St. John's, as Geoffrey Groselle and James Milliken were recognized. Groselle is a fifth-year senior currently in graduate school, while Milliken transferred in prior to the 2012-13 season and is wrapping up his third year in the program.\n\nDuring the past five years, Creighton has gone 118-55. The team has been to the NCAA Tournament three times and the NIT once, winning a game each trip. Groselle also won two league tournaments and one regular-season conference title in 2012-13.\n\nCreighton is 5-0 against in-state rival Nebraska since Groselle arrived on campus, 9-3 in conference tournament play, and he and Milliken have combined for 1,198 points, 464 rebounds and 144 assists in a collective 64 starts.\n\nHome Season Finale History\n\nCreighton is 19-2 in the last 21 years in its final home game of the regular-season, losing only in 2002 to Drake, and last year to Xavier.\n\nEach of the last 17 Creighton teams to win on Senior Day would go on to reach the postseason.\n\nCreighton's 41-point win over St. John's was the program's largest margin of victory in its final regular-season home game of a season since a 105-51 win over Morningside in 1961.\n\nSenior Citizens\n\nBelow is a list of statistics by the Creighton players honored during Senior Day since 2003. Geoffrey Groselle's 22 points and 11 rebounds vs. St. John's on Feb. 28th made him the first senior with a double-double on Senior Day since Randall Crutcher in 1997.\n\nName Pts. Reb. Ast. Stl.

Schabinger's .714 win rate more 80 years ago.\n\nBelow is a list of the most victorious Creighton coaches in program history.\n\nMost Coaching Wins, Creighton History\n\nRk.

The only two road venues in which it has not won are Providence and Georgetown.\n\nTeam CU Home Games CU Road Games\n\nButler 2-1 1-2\n\nDePaul 2-1 3-0\n\nGeorgetown 2-1 0-3\n\nMarquette 2-1 2-1\n\nProvidence 1-2 0-3\n\nSeton Hall 1-2 2-1\n\nSt. John's 3-0 1-2\n\nVillanova 1-2 1-2\n\nXavier 2-1 1-2\n\nTotal 16-11 11-16\n\nWatson Named National Player of the Week\n\nCreighton guard Maurice Watson Jr. was named National Player of the Week by CBSSports.com and NBCSports.com on Feb. 15th after leading the Bluejays to a pair of wins in the previous week. He was also the BIG EAST Player of the Week for the second time this season for his efforts.\n\nWatson averaged 25.0 points, 7.5 assists, 6.0 rebounds and 2.0 steals as Creighton defeated No. 5 Xavier (70-56) and won at Marquette (65-62). Watson made 54.5 percent of his shots from the field and 81.3 percent of his free throw attempts.\n\nThe Philadelphia, Pa., native began his week with 32 points, seven rebounds, five assists and two steals in Creighton's victory over No. 5 Xavier. Watson scored 22 of his points after the intermission as Creighton picked up a win at home over a top-five team for the first time since 1970. Watson also became Creighton's first player since Benoit Benjamin (in 1985) with at least 32 points, seven rebounds and five assists in a game.\n\nWatson then had 18 points, 10 assists and five rebounds in a 65-62 win at Marquette. Watson tied the game with 2:32 left with a pair of free throws, and assisted on the go-ahead three-pointer with 1:05 left that helped CU move into sole possession of third place in the BIG EAST. The game was Watson's third double-double of the winter, and he became the first Bluejay since Duan Cole in 1989-90 with four games of 10+ assists in the same season.\n\nWatson was the first Creighton player named National Player of the Week by CBSSports.com since Doug McDermott was three times (Jan. 6, Jan. 13, Feb. 17) during a 2013-14 season that saw him sweep National Player of the Year honors. McDermott was also named NBCSports.com National Player of the Week on both Jan. 13 and Feb. 17 of that same season.\n\nLate Game Treys\n\nToby Hegner made three three-pointers in the second half of the Feb. 13 win at Marquette, none bigger than one that tied the game with 3:26 left.\n\nHegner improved to 12-for-18 from three-point range in the final five minutes of games this season, good for 66.7 percent. Hegner also leads the team with 26 rebounds, eight more than any other teammate, in the last five minutes of games this season.\n\nOn a related topic, James Milliken's go-ahead three-pointer with 1:05 left also was a key to victory. It was Creighton's first go-ahead three-point basket in the final 65 seconds of a game since Doug McDermott at Butler on Feb. 13, 2014, exactly two years earlier to the day. McDermott also drained a go-ahead trey to beat St. John's on Jan. 28, 2014, with 2.8 seconds left.\n\nStat Sheet Stuffer\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. did a little bit of everything in carrying Creighton to a 70-56 win over No. 5 Xavier on Feb. 9, finishing with 32 points, seven rebounds and five assists in the victory.\n\nWatson is Creighton's second player with at least 32 points, seven rebounds and five assists in the same game since the 1980-81 season, joining Benoit Benajamin's monstrous game of 45 points, 16 rebounds and five assists vs. Indiana State on January 19, 1985.\n\nPer Basketball-Reference.com, Watson is just the third BIG EAST player in the last six seasons with a 32/7/5 game, joining UConn's Kemba Walker (33/12/5) vs. Syracuse on March 11, 2011, and Villanova's Maalik Wayns (39/13/6) at Cincinnati on Jan. 14, 2012.\n\nStuff On Huff\n\nCole Huff made his first seven shots and finished with 28 points vs. DePaul in Creighton's Feb. 6 win.\n\nEighteen of Huff's points came in the final 5:14 of the first half, a span during which Creighton scored 20 points as a team. Huff made seven straight shots.\n\nHuff's 28 points came in just 22 minutes, as he drained 9-of-11 shots overall. Huff's the first Bluejay with at least 28 points in 22 minutes or less since Larry House had 28 points in 22 minutes in his final home game, a March 3, 2003 win over Wichita State.\n\nHuff's 28 points were the most by a Bluejay reserve since Cavel Witter scored 42 points in a double-overtime win over Bradley on March 1, 2008.\n\nMore Points = Better Results\n\nHistory has shown that the more Creighton scores, the better the team does.\n\nCreighton's best record against any BIG EAST foe since joining the league is the 7-1 mark against DePaul, a team it scores 79.4 points per game against.\n\nCreighton's worst record against any BIG EAST foe since joning the league is the 1-6 mark against Providence, a team is scores just 63.7 per game against.\n\nPPG Opponent CU W-L\n\n79.4 DePaul 7-1\n\n79.3 Xavier 4-3\n\n75.2 St. John's 4-2\n\n74.7 Villanova 2-4\n\n72.0 Seton Hall 3-4\n\n70.0 Butler 3-3\n\n67.8 Marquette 4-2\n\n63.9 Georgetown 2-5\n\n63.7 Providence 1-6\n\nBench Impressive\n\nCreighton's bench contributed 51 points in its Feb. 6th victory over DePaul, with 28 of those points coming from Cole Huff.\n\nCreighton's 51 points by its reserves were the most since it scored 54 in a double-overtime win over South Dakota on Dec. 9, 2014 and its most in regulation since putting up 54 vs. Alcorn State on Nov. 8, 2013. Creighton last had 50+ points off the bench in a league game on March 1, 2008, when the reserves supplied 77 points in a double-overtime win over Bradley.\n\nThe Bluejay bench has scored 911 points so far this season, an average of 26.79 points per contest. That's the program's best figure since the 2007-08 team averaged 36.91 points per game.\n\nCreighton's bench has contributed 35 double-figure performances this season.\n\nCreighton's bench has outscored the bench of its opponents 911-670 this season, and 4,721-3,632 in Greg McDermott's six years on the Bluejay sideline.\n\nZierden With Efficient Eight vs. DePaul\n\nIsaiah Zierden's eight three-pointers at DePaul (Jan. 17) are tied for third-most in Creighton history for a single-game, and one shy of the record set by Kyle Korver (1/15/03 vs. Evansville) and Ethan Wragge (1/20/14 at #4 Villanova).\n\nZierden is one of four men with exactly eight trifectas in a contest, joining Korver (12/31/02 at #19 Xavier), Tad Ackerman (1/23/95 at Drake) and Terrell Taylor (3/15/02 vs. #15 Florida).\n\nOf the players to make eight or more three-pointers in a Creighton game, Zierden's 11 attempts are easily the fewest, two less than Ackerman and Korver (at Xavier). Both Korver (vs. Evansville) and Wragge needed 14 attempts, while Taylor set the school-record with 15 attempts against Florida.\n\nZierden's eight three-pointers vs. DePaul are tied for the most by any BIG EAST player in a game this season.\n\n30 Point Efforts\n\nIn Greg McDermott's first five years at Creighton, only Kenny Lawson Jr. (once) and Doug McDermott (27 times) ever scored 30 or more points in a game.\n\nIn the last two months alone, Maurice Watson Jr. (32 vs. No. 5 Xavier on Feb. 9), Isaiah Zierden (31 points at DePaul on Jan. 17) and Cole Huff (35 points vs. Seton Hall on March 10) have each surpassed 30 points in a game.\n\nThis is the first time since at least 1967-68 that Creighton has had three different players reach 30 points in the same season.\n\nHuff's 35 points are the most by any Bluejay since Doug McDermott also scored 35 in the quarterfinals of the BIG EAST Tournament vs. DePaul in 2014.\n\nBefore the Seton Hall loss in the quarterfinals, the last time a Bluejay scored 31 or more in a loss came on Dec. 31, 2002, when Kyle Korver compiled 32 points in a two-point loss at No. 19 Xavier.\n\nCreighton had won 29 straight games in which an individual has scored 31 points or more. In addition to one such game from Zierden and Watson, that streak included 31 point (or more) games from Doug McDermott (21 times), Nate Funk (3), Kyle Korver (1), Johnny Mathies (1) and Cavel Witter (1).\n\nDynamite Start For Watson\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. has 483 points in his first 34 games as a Creighton Bluejay.\n\nSince 1995-96, Watson's figure is the second-most among all Creighton newcomers through 34 games, 11 less than than Doug McDermott's 494 points at this point.\n\nMcDermott would finish his career with 3,150 in 145 career games to rank fifth in NCAA history.\n\nMost Points In CU Newcomer's First Season Since 1995-96\n\nPts.

In addition to Milliken (3x), Isaiah Zierden (2x), Cole Huff (4x), Maurice Watson Jr. (6x), Khyri Thomas and Geoffrey Groselle (5x) have all reached that mark.\n\nBy comparison, last year Creighton had five players all year reach 20+ points (Austin Chatman, Toby Hegner, Will Artino, Milliken and Zierden), and in the two previous years had only three players surpass 20 points in any game.\n\nThe last previous time that Creighton had six men have 20 or more points in a game during the same season was 1972-73, when Gene Harmon, Al Lewis, Ted Wuebben, Doug Brookins, Ralph Bobik and Gene Ellefson all did it.\n\nCreighton also has five different men with 25 points or more in a game this season, the first time it's had five or more 25+ point scorers in the same season since at least 1968-69. The last time CU had four men with games of 25+ points in the same campaign was 1976-77 (Rick Apke, Robert Scrutchens, John C. Johnson and Cornell Smith).\n\nWinning Formulas\n\nBelow are the records for each current BIG EAST school over the last four, 10 and 16 (since 2000-01) seasons, ranked by overall wins, through games of March 19.\n\nMost Wins - Last 4 Years (2012-13 - Present)\n\nTeam W L Next\n\nVillanova 112 27 3/20\n\nCreighton 89 49 3/22\n\nXavier 89 46 3/20\n\nProvidence 88 50\n\nButler 86 48\n\nGeorgetown 80 51\n\nMarquette 76 56\n\nSeton Hall 73 59\n\nSt. John's 66 65\n\nDePaul 44 84\n\nMost Wins - Last 10 Years (2006-07 - Present)\n\nTeam W L\n\nButler 254 95\n\nXavier 244 100\n\nVillanova 245 98\n\nCreighton 230 117\n\nGeorgetown 222 110\n\nMarquette 221 121\n\nProvidence 182 146\n\nSeton Hall 173 149\n\nSt. John's 160 164\n\nDePaul 111 208\n\nMost Wins Since 2000-01\n\nTeam W L\n\nXavier 381 154\n\nButler 380 157\n\nCreighton 369 169\n\nVillanova 367 170\n\nMarquette 347 183\n\nGeorgetown 340 182\n\nProvidence 282 227\n\nSeton Hall 269 233\n\nSt. John's 242 258\n\nDePaul 202 293\n\nPink Out Auction Raises More Than $21,000\n\nCreighton raised more than $21,000 during its \"Creighton vs. Cancer Pink Out\" game vs. Seton Hall on Jan. 30th.\n\nBluejay players wore pink shooting shirts and pink jerseys for the game and, like last year's event, fans had the opportunity to honor a friend or family member who has battled cancer or is currently battling cancer by purchasing the apparel via auction (the shooting shirt could be personalized – last name, nickname, etc.).\n\nThe first 16,000 fans entering the venue received a complimentary pink t-shirt courtesy of CHI Health and Methodist Estabrook Cancer Center.\n\nComplimentary \"Pink Out\" posters were also available to fans exiting the venue after the game.\n\nThis year's Creighton vs. Cancer jersey auction raised $16,527.90 and donations brought in an additional $5,000. The past five seasons has seen $126,203.04 raised in the jersey auction.\n\nBelow is the final numbers for each item in the auction this year:\n\n#0 $710 #1 $532.40 #2 $1125\n\n#4 $1035 #5 $455 #10 $1397\n\n#11 $910 #12 $620 #13 $1009\n\n#15 $610 #20 $485 #21 $1280\n\n#22 $960 #23 $860 #32 $1125\n\n#40 $1025 #41 $1275\n\nBasketballs: $242.50, $230.50, $227.50, $210.50, $203.50\n\nSome People Call Him Maurice\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. dished 14 assists in Creighton's win at Seton Hall on Jan. 9. While it was three shy of his collegiate high accomplished while he was at Boston University, the 14 helpers were his most in a Creighton uniform.\n\nWatson's 14 assists tie Providence's Kris Dunn (twice) for the most by any BIG EAST player this season, and were the most in a regular-season BIG EAST game since Dee Davis had 15 assists vs. Providence on Feb. 7, 2015.\n\nWatson's 14 assists are tied for eighth-most nationally in a game this season, and directly led to 37 points by the Bluejays in that game.\n\nWatson's 14 assists were the most ever by a Creighton player in any conference game.\n\nWatson's 14 assists were the most by any Bluejay since Ralph Bobik tied his own school-record with 17 assist vs. Bradley on Jan. 22, 1974. Below is a list of the six occasions in CU history in which a player has had 13 or more assists.\n\nAst.

In fact, in Watson had owned or shared the team lead in assists in 23 straight games before that streak was snapped vs. Alabama last Tuesday.\n\nWatson is on pace to become Creighton's sixth player since 1970-71 to lead the club in both points per game and assists per game, as seen below:\n\nCreighton Leaders in PPG & APG, Since 1970-71\n\nName, Year PPG APG\n\nKevin McKenna, 1979-80 16.5 3.7\n\nMatt Petty, 1992-93 17.2 3.1\n\nKyle Korver, 2001-02 15.1 3.3\n\nNate Funk, 2003-04 11.1 2.7\n\nNate Funk, 2006-07 17.7 3.0\n\nAustin Chatman, 2014-15 11.5 3.7\n\nMaurice Watson Jr., 2015-16 14.2 6.5\n\nMo' Points, Mo' Assists\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. leads Creighton in both scoring and assists, and he's doing things at a rate that has never been approached in school history.\n\nSince the program began tracking assists in 1970-71, Watson is one of four men to average at least 12 points and five assists per game. However, he's the only one in that quartet that's scored 12 points per game while also averaging six assists per contest.\n\n12+ PPG & 5+ APG, Since 1970-71 at Creighton\n\nName, Year PPG APG\n\nRalph Bobik, 1971-72 14.1 5.2\n\nJames Farr, 1988-89 12.0 5.0\n\nAntoine Young, 2010-11 13.1 5.0\n\nMaurice Watson Jr., 2015-16 14.2 6.5\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 15 victories under Greg McDermott after trailing by double-figures at some point, including DePaul (down 12) on January 17th. Eight of those comebacks came away from home.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2014, Creighton trailed 42-24 to No. 18 Oklahoma with 18:30 to go before putting together a comeback for the ages. It was CU's largest comeback victory under Greg McDermott (see chart below), the second-largest since 2000 (see chart below), and the second-biggest in the history of CenturyLink Center Omaha (see chart, left column on page five).\n\nOn the other hand, CU is 124-8 under McDermott when putting together double-digit leads, including wins 112 of the last 116 times.\n\nDouble-Digit Comebacks Under Greg McDermott\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n12 at DePaul 01/17/16\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n10 at Nebraska 12/07/14\n\n10 South Dakota 12/09/14\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Dramatics\n\nProvidence's Kris Dunn hit a game-winning shot as time expired to beat Creighton on Jan. 12th. It was the first game-winning shot with no time left to ever to beat Creighton at CenturyLink Center Omaha, exceeding the previous low with 1.9 seconds left by Butler's Roosevelt Jones last year.\n\nDunn's shot was the first to beat Creighton (at any site) with no time left on the clock since Anthony James drained a game-winning three-pointer for Northern Iowa in a 65-62 win on Feb. 4, 2012 in Cedar Falls, Iowa.\n\nAfter allowing just two game-winning go-ahead scores in the last 10 seconds in the first 11 seasons at CenturyLink Center Omaha, Creighton has allowed that to happen four times in the past 13 months alone.\n\nCreighton is now 7-6 in games with a game-winning go-ahead score in the final 10 seconds in the 13-year old facility.\n\nCreighton's Go-Ahead Scores in Wins at CLCO, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n11/26/05 Dayton W 91-90* Funk FG :5.7\n\n01/28/06 Wichita St. W 57-55 Tolliver FG :0.0\n\n11/25/06 George Mason W 58-56 Watts FT :7.5\n\n03/18/08 Rhode Island W 74-73 Witter 3FG :3.2\n\n01/13/10 Southern Illinois W 71-69 Young FG :1.3\n\n02/18/12 Long Beach St. W 81-79 Young FG :0.3\n\n01/28/14 St. John's W 63-60 McDermott 3FG :2.8\n\n*double-overtime\n\nOpponent Go-Ahead Scores in CU Losses at CLCO, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n03/20/06 Miami (Fla.) 53-52 G.

Watson had six such games at Boston University in his first two years as a collegian.\n\nWatson is the first Bluejay with four or more games of 10 or more assists in the same season since Duan Cole, who had four such games in 1989-90.\n\nMagic Number is 79\n\nCreighton has scored 79 points or more in 16 of its 20 wins thus far. Creighton averages 87.1 points per game in its 20 wins this winter, compared to 68.9 per game when it loses.\n\nWatson Reaches Milestones\n\nThough he's still relatively new to Creighton, that hasn't kept Maurice Watson Jr. from reaching a couple big milestones at the collegiate level.\n\nWatson owns 483 points and 220 assists at Creighton this season, and when combined with his 800 points and 410 assists in two seasons at Boston University, now owns career collegiate totals of 1,283 points and 630 assists.\n\nOnly two players have ever attained 1,000 points and 500 assists (all with CU) during their Creighton careers, Ryan Sears (1,309/570) and Antoine Young (1,342/505). Both Sears and Young got there as seniors.\n\nWatson is currently averaging 6.47 assists per game. Creighton's last player to average 6.0 assists per game or more for an entire season is Randy Eccker's 7.3 assists per contest in 1976-77.\n\nOverall, Watson's 1.95 assist/turnover ratio this year ranks seventh in the BIG EAST (min. 3.0 assists per game), and his career ratio (including Boston) of 2.07 assists per turnover ranks 19th-best nationally among active players with 400 or more career assists.\n\nThat ratio ranks better that such highly-touted men such as Yogi Ferrell (2.03), Denzel Valentine (2.02), Kyle Collinsworth (1.92) and Kris Dunn (1.75).\n\nWatson surpassed 1,000 career points on Jan. 5 vs. Georgetown in the 81st game of Watson's collegiate career. If you're curious to see how that stacks up with others in recent Creighton history to reach 1,000 career points, here's a list:\n\nGames To 1,000 CU Points, Last 15 Bluejays\n\nName Games to 1,000 pts.

On Dec. 31 at St. John's, Groselle made his first eight shots before finishing 9-of-10. Groselle was also perfect from the field vs. Villanova on Jan. 2nd, though he only attempted one shot.\n\nThe streak of 21 straight field goals made was just nine shy of the NCAA record set this season by Yale's Brandon Sherrod.\n\nThe recent play has moved Groselle's field goal percentage to 69.7 percent, the second-best mark nationally (min 5 FGA/game) and best in the BIG EAST (min. 3 FG/game).\n\nIf you're curious, the NCAA record (min. 5 FG/game) was set in 1981 by Oregon State's Steve Johnson, who shot 74.6 percent, while the Creighton record (min. 200 attempts) is 67.4 percent set by Vernon Moore in 1984-85.\n\nGroselle's older brother, Mike Groselle, played at The Citadel from 2009-13 and ranks eighth in Southern Conference history with a 58.9 career field goal percentage and led the league in that category as a senior when he shot 57.4 percent from the floor.\n\nFG Percentage Leaders (through 3/19)\n\nMinimum 5 FGA/game\n\nRk.

It's the fourth different season in program history it's done that, and first time since 1971-72's squad did it five times.\n\nThe 1965-66 team cracked the century mark seven times, while the 1971-72 club reached triple-digits five times.\n\nMan Of Steal\n\nIsaiah Zierden ranks ninth in the BIG EAST with 44 steals this season. He owns nine games this season with three steals or more, and had at least three in each of CU's first four BIG EAST victories this winter.\n\nBy comparison, Zierden had a total of three steals (in 28 games and 304 minutes) as a freshman, and 12 steals (in 20 games and 558 minutes) a year ago. Zierden owned just two steals in 23 career BIG EAST games entering the season.\n\nThe Link Turns Into The Dunk Tank\n\nCreighton has put down 56 dunks in 34 games as a unit this year. By comparison, Creighton had 29 dunks in 33 games all last season.\n\nEight different men have thrown down a dunk this winter, led by 17 from Geoffrey Groselle, 12 from Zach Hanson and 11 by Khyri Thomas.\n\nThe Fast And The Furious\n\nCreighton has 317 fast break points already this winter. By comparison, last year Creighton had a total of 143 fast break points (4.3 per game), and never had more than 11 in any contest.\n\nCreighton had a whopping 30 fast break points in its Nov. 14 win over Texas Southern, then added 24 more on Nov. 17 vs. UTSA.\n\nCreighton's 30 fast break points are believed to be its most since moving to CenturyLink Center Omaha in 2003, with the next highest mark on file (before Texas Southern on Nov. 14) was listed as 24 vs. Kennesaw State on Nov. 26, 2010.\n\nRelease, Rotation, Splash, Repeat\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in 747 straight games since a 59-53 loss at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993. The streak is the nation's 22nd-longest active streak.\n\nCreighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nCourtesy Stats Inc., below is a list of the nation's longest active three-point streaks.\n\nLongest Active 3-Point Streaks (thru 3/20)\n\nRk.

He is just the third Bluejay in Greg McDermott's six-year tenure to post at least seven points, seven rebounds and seven assists in the same game, joining Austin Chatman and Grant Gibbs. Both Chatman and Gibbs did it twice each. Maurice Watson Jr. has also done it once since then (Jan. 26 at Georgetown).\n\nCreighton has never had a traditional point/rebound/assist triple-double.\n\n7+ Point, 7+ Rebound, 7+ Assist Games, Since 2010-11\n\nPts.

McDermott would go on to be named First-Team All-MVC and, MVC Newcomer of the Year and MVC Freshman of the Year.\n\nAmong The Best\n\nSince the start of the 2010-11 season, which coincides with Greg McDermott's arrival, Creighton has been the nation's fifth-most accurate team from three-point range.\n\nThe Bluejays are 1767-4574 from deep in that time, shooting 38.63 percent.\n\nBest 3FG%, Since 2010-11\n\nRk.

The Detroit native responded in a big way, finishing with 10 assists in 20 minutes of work. The 10 assists led to 28 points from his Bluejay teammates.\n\nIn the process, Albert became the nation's third reserve with 10 or more assists in 20 minutes or less in a win against a Division I team since 2010-11. He joins Kansas's Naadir Tharpe (12 assists in 20 minutes vs. American on Dec. 29, 2012) and Louisiana Tech's Kenneth Smith (10 assists in 20 minutes on Nov. 20, 2013 vs. Central Arkansas).\n\nPer STATS Inc., Albert became the second BIG EAST reserve since 2004-05 with 10+ assists in 20 minutes or less against a Division I team, joining Marquette's Maurice Acker (12/28/08 vs. Presbyterian).\n\nAlbert is Creighton's only player in the last 30 years to have a game of 10 or more assists as a reserve.\n\nBig Margin Can Lead To Big Things\n\nCreighton's 104-77 win last year vs. Central Arkansas was the second straight season the team has cracked triple-digits in a season-opener.\n\nThe 2015-16 season saw Creighton reach 90 points in each of its first two games this season, just the fourth time that's happened. Each of the previous three times (1973-74, 2011-12, 2013-14), the Bluejays would reach the NCAA Tournament and then win at last one game in the Big Dance.\n\nNine of Creighton's 19 all-time NCAA Tournament teams have scored 90 or more points in their season-opener.\n\nHere's a look at Creighton's last eight teams to score 90 or more in a season-opener, which shows that six of those teams to do so reached the NCAA Tournament.\n\nFinal Post-\n\nScore Opponent Date W-L Season\n\n93-70 Texas Southern 11/14/15 ? ? ?

Both McDermott (145 games) and Sears (124) started every contest of their four-year Creighton careers.\n\nHuff Earns MVP Honor\n\nNevada transfer Cole Huff returned to the Silver State and picked up MVP honors of the 2015 Men Who Speak Up Main Event after averaging 19.0 points and 5.0 rebounds in the two wins.\n\nHuff made 13-of-25 field goal attempts, including 7-of-15 three-pointers. He scored 26 points in the victory over Rutgers before a 12-point effort over UMass in the title game.\n\nPreseason BIG EAST Poll\n\nCreighton was picked to finish ninth in its third season as BIG EAST Conference members according to a preseason poll of league coaches. Villanova was picked first with 81 points and nine first-place votes, while Georgetown (70, 1), Butler (67), Xavier (55) and Providence (45) round out the top half. The predicted lower half was Marquette (44), Seton Hall (27), DePaul (25), Creighton (23) and St. John's (13).\n\nCreighton did not have any honorees on the Preseason All-BIG EAST Teams, which was led by Preseason Player of the Year Kris Dunn from Providence.\n\nZierden Returns From Second Knee Injury\n\nIsaiah Zierden had 15 points on Nov. 14 after missing the second half of last season after suffering a season-ending injury to his right knee for the second straight campaign.\n\nZierden was carried off the floor with 4:05 left in the first half on Jan. 21, 2015 at Butler and did not return.\n\nAn MRI two days later determined that Zierden partially tore the MCL in his knee, while also suffering an injury to his patella.\n\nUnlike his first injury, Zierden elected to have surgery this time around, as he underwent a medical procedure in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 13, 2015.\n\nThe uncommon injury is very similar to one he suffered the previous March at Xavier, which caused him to miss CU's last seven games.\n\nZierden has missed three of the last four games with a shoulder injury.\n\nNBA Representation\n\nThis year marks the second time since 1970 (joining last season) that Creighton has three NBA players at the same time, as Kyle Korver (Atlanta Hawks), Anthony Tolliver (Detroit Pistons) and Doug McDermott (Chicago Bulls) are all in the league.\n\nIncluding 2015-16, Creighton has now had an NBA player in 32 of the last 33 years.\n\nKorver ranks eighth in NBA history with 1,865 three-pointers and is also eighth in league history with 43.0 percent marksmanship from three-point range (through March 19). He set a single-season NBA mark that still stands with his 53.6 percent shooting from three-point range in 2009-10. Last season he was named an All-Star and led the league in three-point percentage for the third time.\n\nTolliver is averaging 5.3 points per game this season for the Pistons, his 10th NBA organization.\n\nMcDermott is in his second season with the Chicago Bulls, where he's averaging 9.7 points per game and ranks sixth in the NBA by shooting 43.0 percent from three-point range for fellow Ames High alum Fred Hoiberg. Hoiberg, ironically, is the same man who replaced Greg McDermott as Iowa State's head coach in 2010.\n\nTop-20 Crowds\n\nCreighton's Jan. 30 crowd of 17,924 was the program's 18th largest home crowd ever. Here's a look at Creighton's top-20 home crowds all-time.\n\nRank Att. Opponent Date\n\n1. 18,868 Providence 03/08/14\n\n2. 18,859 Georgetown 01/25/14\n\n3. 18,797 #6 Villanova 02/16/14\n\n4. 18,742 Seton Hall 02/23/14\n\n5. 18,735 Wichita State 02/11/12\n\n6. 18,613 Wichita State 03/02/13\n\n7. 18,525 Marquette 12/31/13\n\n8. 18,494 Illinois State 02/09/13\n\n9. 18,458 Evansville 12/29/12\n\n10. 18,436 Bradley 01/28/12\n\n11. 18,323 DePaul 02/07/14\n\n12. 18,160 Central Arkansas 11/14/14\n\n13. 18,111 Bradley 02/02/13\n\n14. 18,078 Tulsa 11/23/13\n\n15. 18,073 Drake 01/08/13\n\n16. 17,971 #19 Butler 02/16/15\n\n17. 17,954 Wichita State 12/28/08\n\n18. 17,924 Seton Hall 01/30/16\n\n19. 17,766 Nebraska 12/09/15\n\n20. 17,740 Alcorn State 11/08/13\n\nTrès Bien\n\nSince 2011-12, Creighton is 48-44 (.522) when shooting 40.00 percent or worse from three-point range. While respectable, that pales in comparison to CU's 70-10 (.875) mark the last five years when shooting better than 40.00 percent from downtown.\n\nLower the standards to 30%, and it's still impressive. Creighton is 103-29 in the last five years when shooting 30 percent or better from deep, compared to 15-25 when shooting 29.99 percent or less.\n\nNCAA Success\n\nCreighton is one of 18 schools to have won an NCAA Tournament game in at least three of the last four seasons.\n\nGonzaga, Kansas, Louisville, Michigan State and North Carolina are the only five teams to have won at least one game all four seasons.\n\nThe list of teams with an NCAA win in three of the last four campaigns consists of Arizona, Creighton, Florida, Iowa State, Kentucky, North Carolina State, Ohio State, Oregon, Saint Louis, San Diego State, Syracuse, Wichita State and Wisconsin.\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Success\n\nCreighton has played 222 regular and postseason contests at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time in the 13-year-old facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own a 184-38 (.829) record all-time at the facility, and have never lost there on a Thursday (7-0) or Friday (10-0).\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 16,910-14,267 in games at CenturyLink Center Omaha, an average margin of 11.91 points per game. Creighton has led wire-to-wire 61 different times, including nine times this year (UTSA, Western Illinois, Nebraska, IUPUI, North Texas, Coppin State, DePaul, No. 5 Xavier and St. John's).\n\nCreighton is also 25-22 all-time in the 47 games at CLCO in which it's fallen behind by double-figures.\n\nCreighton is 87-20 (.813) at CenturyLink Center Omaha under Greg McDermott, including a 49-4 record vs. non-conference teams.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 204-38 (.843) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nWhat A Start!\n\nGreg McDermott is 141-71 on the Creighton sideline during his sixth year at the helm. The 141 wins are easily the most in Creighton history in the first six seasons, way more than Tom Apke's 109.\n\nMost Wins at CU, First Six Seasons\n\nCoach Years W-L After 6 Yrs\n\nGreg McDermott 2010-Pres. 141-71 so far\n\nTom Apke 1974-80 109-55\n\nTony Barone 1985-91 102-82\n\nDana Altman 1994-00 99-78\n\nRed McManus 1959-65 91-63\n\nPizza Pie, Piled High = Wins\n\nThanks to a promotion with Omaha-based Godfather's Pizza, Creighton season ticket-holders can get a free mini pizza any time the Jays score 75 points at home.\n\nHistory has proven that when the team earns the fans pizza, it often leads to a victory as well.\n\nThe first three years of CenturyLink Center Omaha (2003-06), Creighton needed 70 points to earn its fans free pizza, and the Jays went 27-3 when reaching that threshold, closing out that run with 12 straight wins.\n\nSince upping the standard to 75 points prior to the 2006-07 campaign, Creighton is 96-1 when scoring 75 points or more at CenturyLink Center Omaha. In other words, Creighton is 108-1 in CenturyLink Center Omaha since Feb. 6, 2005 when scoring enough points to earn its fans some free pizza. The perfect streak of 101-0 was snapped on Dec. 2, 2015 when Arizona State scored three points in the final 15 seconds to sneak away with a 79-77 victory.\n\nHome Run\n\nSince Greg McDermott took over in 2010, Creighton is averaging 78.65 points per home game (8,416 points in 107 home games).\n\nSince a 92-83 loss to Southern Illinois on Feb. 19, 2000, Creighton is 119-0 at home (90-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 78 points or more, and 100-0 at home (73-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 80 points or more at home dating to that same setback.\n\nLast Season Recap\n\nCreighton went 14-19 last season, finishing 4-14 to tie for ninth place in the BIG EAST Conference.\n\nThe Bluejays started the season 5-0, including a win over No. 18 Oklahoma, before losing eight remaining games in the final minute.\n\nSenior point guard Austin Chatman led Creighton in scoring (11.5 ppg.) and assists (3.7 apg.), while fellow senior Devin Brooks paced the team in rebounds (5.0 ppg.) and steals (1.0 spg.).\n\nDespite the struggles on the court, Creighton still ranked sixth nationally with 17,048 fans per home game.\n\nShuttle Service Provided Again\n\nChief Bus will provide complimentary shuttle service from the Creighton University campus to CenturyLink Center Omaha for all men's basketball home games this season. The service is available to all fans, not just Creighton students.\n\nThe shuttle will start 75 minutes before tip-off and shuttles will continue to operate the route during the game. The three designated stops for pick-up around the CU campus are: 24th & California (nearside/southbound); 20th & Cass (nearside/eastbound) and at Billy Blues Alumni Grill (outside the Mike & Josie Harper Center in the turnaround which is on the east side of the building).\n\nThe shuttle will then go eastbound on Capitol Avenue and then go north up 10th Street for drop-off at the CenturyLink Center Omaha convention center entrance. The route is designed for each shuttle driver to make a roundtrip every 15 minutes.\n\nFollowing the game's conclusion, the shuttle will start at the CenturyLink Center Omaha convention center entrance on 10th Street and loop the original route with the first of three stops at 24th & California Streets.\n\nTicket Information\n\nSingle-game tickets for the 2015-16 season went on sale on October 29th.\n\nFans can purchase single-game tickets at CenturyLink Center Omaha Box Office, Ryan Athletic Center, all Ticketmaster locations (Baker's, Younkers), Ticketmaster online at http://www.ticketmaster.com or by calling Ticketmaster and charging by phone at (800) 745-3000.
