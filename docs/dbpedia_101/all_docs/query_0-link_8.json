Rose is BYU’s all-time leader in winning percentage at 74.8 percent and second in career wins at 232. He has led the Cougars to nine-straight 20-win seasons and nine-straight postseason appearances, including seven NCAA tournament appearances during that stretch.\n\nSenior guard Tyler Haws, the 2013-14 West Coast Conference Player of the Year, has been named by the coaches to the preseason All-WCC team. Haws led the league in scoring and was sixth in the NCAA in 2013-14 at 23.2 points per game. He is currently fifth all-time in scoring at BYU at 1,944 career points.\n\nJunior guard Kyle Collinsworth was selected by the WCC coaches to the preseason All-WCC team. Collinsworth, an All-WCC performer last season, is coming off a torn ACL suffered at the end of last season.\n\nDave Rose\n\nBYU head coach Dave Rose has led BYU to one of the most successful runs in program history since taking over in 2005. His career record of 232-78 ranks him second in BYU history in total victories and first in winning percentage (.748). Rose has been named conference coach of the year three times, district coach of the year twice, led the Cougars to four conference titles, seven NCAA tournament appearances, two NIT appearances, six 25-win seasons and nine 20-win seasons. In 2010, he led BYU to its first NCAA tournament win in 17 years and the Cougars won at least one postseason game in the next three seasons, including a spot in the Sweet 16 in 2011, a win in the 2012 NCAA tournament and a trip to the NIT semifinals in 2013.\n\nRecord Streaks\n\nThe Cougars will be looking to keep several program-record streaks intact during 2014-15. Coming into the season, Dave Rose has led the Cougars to nine-straight 20-win seasons, nine-straight postseason appearances and nine-straight seasons with 10-plus conference victories.\n\nCougars leading the league\n\nIn each of BYU’s three seasons in the WCC, the Cougars have had the leading scorer in all games (Noah Hartsock in 2011-12, Tyler Haws in 2012-13 and 2013-14) and in league games (Brandon Davies in 2011-12, Haws in 2012-13 and 2013-14). Only one other school (Loyola Marymount from 1988-89 to 1991-92) has had the league’s leading scorer in at least three-straight seasons in all games. In league games, a school has had the league’s leading scorer in at least three-straight seasons three other times (San Francisco from 2006-07 to 2008-09, Loyola Marymount from 1982-83 to 1985-86 and Loyola Marymount from 1987-88 to 1991-92).\n\n2014 EA SPORTS Maui Invitational\n\nBYU will play in the 31st annual EA SPORTS™ Maui Invitational® this season. The 2014 Championship Round of the premier early-season college basketball tournament will take place at the Lahaina Civic Center on the beautiful island of Maui from Nov. 24-26.\n\nThe Championship Round will feature Arizona, BYU, Kansas State, Missouri, Pittsburgh, Purdue, San Diego Stateand host Chaminade. The seven Division I teams have each appeared in the NCAA Tournament since 2012, with five earning berths in 2014, including Arizona’s run to the Elite Eight. Chaminade has advanced to the previous two NCAA Division II Tournaments.\n\nBYU will take on former Mountain West Conference foe San Diego State in the first round on Monday, Nov. 24, at 9:30 p.m. MST on ESPN2. The Cougars own a 48-23 advantage in the all-time series against the Aztecs, including seven wins in the last nine meetings.\n\nESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU will offer live, high-definition television coverage of all 12 Championship Round contests. Games will also be broadcast live on the WatchESPN app and WatchESPN.com. See the complete bracket on page 21 of this release.\n\nRose in season and home openers\n\nUnder Dave Rose, BYU basketball is 6-3 in season openers and 8-1 in home openers. After dropping his first two season openers in 2005 and 2006, Rose led BYU to four-straight season-opening wins before falling 69-62 at Utah State in 2011-12. Last year, BYU defeated Weber State 81-72 in the season/home opener. Rose lost his first home opener (also the season opener in 2005) but has since won the last eight home openers.\n\nRose vs. the state"
