        "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nBYU is days away from officially kicking off its 2014-15 basketball season, and fans can hardly wait. This year's team is as deep as any under 10th-year head coach Dave Rose, and the schedule boasts several big-name squads.\n\nBut how well do fans really know the Cougars? One can only draw so many conclusions from exhibition games and past seasons.\n\nSo if you are the type of fan lacking a taste for this year's squad, here is a complete scouting report for the 2014-15 BYU basketball team.\n\nNote: Not every BYU basketball player is included. Only those who will legitimately make a case for playing time this season are listed below. A full roster can be found here.\n\nPoint Guards\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nDespite losing Matt Carlino, BYU returns last year's starter at point guard, Kyle Collinsworth, and several others who can play the position. Health will be crucial for KC and the guards, but they are set to have a good season.\n\nKyle Collinsworth (Jr.)\n\nFollowing a knee injury in last year's West Coast Conference championship game, Collinsworth has recovered and is cleared to play on Saturday. He is one of the most versatile players in the country—his aggressive style and 6'6\" frame makes him a unique point guard.\n\nKC isn't the type of guard who is known for his handles or crossovers. Despite not being a \"flashy\" player, Collinsworth has the speed to get past defenders and is physical enough to finish and rebound. He has good court vision—he led BYU in assists last season—and although he is a perimeter player, he averaged eight rebounds per game.\n\nCollinsworth benefited from Rose's zone defenses last season, which helped him tally 57 steals. With Rose trying to install more man-to-man schemes this year, KC may be exposed as an average defender. Anyhow, Collinsworth is set for a big season and should impress a lot of people this season.\n\nAnson Winder (Sr.)\n\nEthan Miller/Getty Images\n\nWinder has never really found his niche in Provo, as he's been drowned in the depth chart for the past few seasons. He should get more playing time this winter—at both point guard and shooting guard—and could be primed for a breakout season.\n\nThere may not be a better one-on-one defender on BYU's roster than Winder, and he will surely get several chances to prove it this season. The biggest question mark for him is his scoring ability, and although he could compete with Tyler Haws as BYU's top free-throw shooter, his all-around scoring skill set is questionable.\n\nJordan Chatman (Fr.)\n\nAs the son of a former BYU legend, Jordan Chatman already has a common name in Provo. He was Washington's Gatorade Player of the Year in high school, but as a true freshman, he still has a lot to prove.\n\nHe definitely is one of the better ball-handlers the Cougars have, and at 6'5\", he is a big point guard (like Collinsworth). Chatman will surely make a case for playing time this season and may even move into the backup point guard spot.\n\nWings (Shooting Guards/Small Forwards)\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nTyler Haws returns as one of the nation's elite shooters, and there are several potential starters at the other wing position. Rose has no shortage of depth here.\n\nTyler Haws (Sr.)\n\nAs a reigning honorable mention All-American and the WCC's Player of the Year, there is definitely plenty of hype surrounding Haws. He is an innovative, all-around scorer and could definitely make a name for himself this season.\n\nHaws is known as a mid-range sniper, but it seems like he's evolved his game to be a freakishly efficient three-point shooter. Coupled with his ability to finish and knock down free throws, don't be surprised if Haws averages over 25 points per game this season.\n\nThe biggest question mark in his offensive arsenal is his ability to create space for his jump shot. He isn't a great ball-handler and is at his best coming off screens. If he can find ways to create his own shot, he will quickly become one of the premier scorers in the nation.\n\nChase Fischer (Jr.)\n\nPeter Casey-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA transfer from Wake Forest, Fischer could prove to be a great complement to Haws' scoring prowess. He is a proven shooter with deep range and a crafty finisher off of the dribble.\n\nFischer was West Virginia's Gatorade POY in high school but had a limited role at Wake Forest. He was used primarily as a shooter off the bench.\n\nThe biggest hurdle Fischer will have to jump is finding his role in Rose's scheme. He is already in his second year in Provo—he redshirted last year—but could prove to be one of BYU's best scorers.\n\nSkyler Halford (Sr.)\n\nHalford averaged seven points in 15 minutes played per game last season. He will likely see more playing time this year, and his numbers should go up.\n\nAs a former JUCO standout, Halford is a shoot-first scorer who can put up numbers on any given night. He may even see playing time at the point guard position considering his ability to see the floor and BYU's depth at the wing positions.\n\nFrank Bartley IV (So.)\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nThere's a good chance that Bartley could be the surprise star of the season. A 6'3\" guard from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he saw sporadic playing time last season but should get a more consistent spot in the rotation this winter.\n\nBartley is a versatile athlete who can play at any guard or wing position. He fits right in with Rose's high-tempo offensive system and is an elite scorer in the paint. If he can fine-tune his shooting, he could become a starter at some point.\n\nJake Toolson (Fr.)\n\nDespite being a true freshman, Toolson is a Division I-ready scorer and a decent defender. He put up 12 points in BYU's first exhibition game and looks like he could be a deadly three-point shooter off the bench this season.\n\nDalton Nixon (Fr.)\n\nFresh off a Latter-day Saints mission, Nixon is another freshman who could make a big impact this season. He is one of BYU's better perimeter defenders but is also a smooth-stroking shooter and able rebounder.\n\nRick Bowmer/Associated Press\n\nPower Forwards/Centers\n\nLast season's starting center, Eric Mika, left on an LDS mission in the spring. Nate Austin, among others, will be back to replace him and could assemble a dominant Cougars frontcourt. The bigs have already been plagued with injuries, but if they can stay healthy, this may be the deepest lineup BYU has seen in a long time.\n\nNate Austin (Sr.)\n\nAustin is a dominant rebounder and physical defender, but he lacks a consistent offensive skill set. He scored in double figures only twice last season and averaged twice as many rebounds as he did points per game (7.9 RPG, 3.6 PPG).\n\nThere's no doubt that assistant coach Mark Pope has worked with Austin during the offseason, and hopefully, that will show in the next few months. Austin is a great rebounder, and even if he doesn't prove to be a consistent scorer, he will help BYU with his physicality and hustle.\n\nLuke Worthington (So.)\n\nDespite seeing limited action in games last season, Worthington will get plenty of chances to shine this winter. He is not a flashy scorer—his hair may be more famous than his jump shot—but he, like Austin, will help BYU with hustle plays and rebounding.\n\nWorthington is one of the several big men who will fight for the starting frontcourt spot next to Austin. He runs the court as well as anyone, and that could prove to help his case for playing time.\n\nJosh Sharp (Sr.)\n\nIn what seems like Sharp's 50th season at BYU, he will (once again) be a role player for the Cougars. He is a rare player—generously listed at 6'7\", he is small for a power forward but doesn't have the offensive skill set to play on the wing.\n\nSharp will definitely get some playing time this season. He probably won't find himself in the starting rotation, but as a solid defender and decent rebounder, he will get minutes as a backup power forward.\n\nJamal Aytes (So.)\n\nEthan Miller/Getty Images\n\nA transfer from UNLV, Aytes is a physical, undersized frontcourt commodity. Despite being listed at 6'6\", he weighs 225 pounds and can post up as well as most 6'10\" players.\n\nBecause of transfer rules, he is ineligible to play until mid-December. Health issues have pushed that date back until January.\n\nCorbin Kaufusi (Fr.)\n\nKaufusi's athleticism brings a lot to the table, but he will have to expand his fundamentals and all-around game before getting significant playing time.\n\nIsaac Neilson (Fr.)\n\nFollowing a two-year LDS mission, Neilson redshirted last season and will provide depth to BYU's frontcourt. He can run the floor as well as any center, and if he can prove to be a physical defender, he may sneak into Rose's rotation."
