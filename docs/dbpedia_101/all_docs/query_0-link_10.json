        "text": "BYU Game Notes\n\nGonzaga Game Notes\n\nAfter a thrilling 79-77 overtime win over San Francisco in the semifinals, BYU will take on Gonzaga in the championship game of the WCC Tournament on Tuesday at 6 p.m. PST at the Orleans Arena. The Cougars and Bulldogs split during the regular season, with Gonzaga winning 84-69 in Spokane and BYU winning 73-65 in Provo. Tuesday's championship matchup will be televised live on ESPN and the Cougar IMG Sports Network on KSL Newsradio 102.7 FM and 1160 AM and BYUcougars.com.\n\nBYU started the 2013-14 season with an 8-7 record, BYU has come on strong, winning 15 of 18 and 10 of 11, including Monday's 79-77 semifinal overtime victory over San Francisco. The Cougars have now won 20-plus games in nine-straight seasons under coach Dave Rose. BYU is looking for its ninth-straight postseason appearance – BYU has six NCAA and two NIT appearances under Rose – and its first conference tournament title under Rose.\n\nNo. 2 BYU Cougars (23-10, 13-5 WCC)\n\nHead Coach: Dave Rose\n\nAlma Mater: Houston, 1983\n\nCareer Record: 232-76 (9th)\n\nRecord at BYU: Same\n\nNo. 1 Gonzaga (27-6, 15-3 WCC)\n\nHead Coach: Mark Few\n\nAlma Mater: Oregon, 1987\n\nDivision I Career Record: 401-99 (15th)\n\nRecord at Gonzaga: Same\n\nSeries Information vs. Gonzaga\n\nSeries Record: Gonzaga leads 6-3\n\nLast Meeting: BYU won 73-65, 2/20/14\n\nH/A/N: 2-1/0-3/1-2\n\nGame Information\n\nTV: ESPN\n\nTV Talent: Dave Flemming (play-by-play), Sean Farnham (analyst)\n\nLive Video: WatchESPN.com\n\nRadio: Cougar IMG Sports Network, KSL 102.7 FM / 1160 AM, BYU Radio - Sirius XM 143\n\nRadio Talent: Greg Wrubell (play-by-play), Mark Durrant (analyst)\n\nLive Audio/Stats: BYUcougars.com\n\nBy the numbers\n\n1 Tyler Haws is the only player in BYU history to surpass 1,700, 1,800 or 1,900 career points during his junior season. The previous record holder for points through a junior season by a Cougar was Danny Ainge, who scored 1,685 in his first three years at BYU. Haws and Ainge are the only Cougars to reach 1,000 career points as sophomores. Ainge had 1,030 at the end of his sophomore season while Haws had 1,177. 4 The number of players in the NCAA ranked in the top 175 in both rebounding and assists: BYU’s Kyle Collinsworth (62nd in assists, T-107th in rebounding), UCLA’s Kyle Anderson (4th in assists, T-54th in rebounding), Saint Joseph’s Halil Kanacevic (76th in assists and 64th in rebounding) and Vermont’s Brian Voelkel (23rd in assists and 89th in rebounding). Rankings as of 3/3/14. 7 The number of career games for Tyler Haws shooting 100 percent from the free throw line with a minimum of 10 attempts, a BYU record. He hit 10 of 10 at Wyoming on Feb. 20, 2010, 12 of 12 vs. Cal State Northridge on Nov. 24, 2012, 10 of 10 vs. Utah on Dec. 8, 2012, 10 of 10 at Weber State on Dec. 15, 2012, 14 of 14 at Loyola Marymount on March 2, 2013, 11 of 11 vs. Wichita State on Nov. 26, 2013 and 14 of 14 vs. San Francisco on March 10, 2014. 7 The number of times a player in the West Coast Conference has scored 35 points or more in a single game since BYU joined the league in 2011. Five of the seven instances have been achieved by Tyler Haws: 42 vs. Virginia Tech on 12/29/12, 37 vs. Washington on 3/19/13, 35 vs. Pepperdine on 1/9/14, 48 at Portland on 1/23/14 and 38 vs. Pacific on 1/30/14. The other two players to reach 35 are Stephen Holt of Saint Mary’s (35 on 2/22/14) and Jared Brownridge of Santa Clara (38 on 3/1/14). 8 BYU has reached the postseason in eight-straight years under BYU coach Dave Rose. In his first season on the job, he took the Cougars to the 2006 NIT. That was followed by six-straight trips to the NCAA Tournament and last season’s NIT bid. 9 Including 2013-14, the number of seasons Dave Rose has been BYU’s head coach and the number of consecutive seasons BYU has won at least 20 games, the longest streak in program history. 46 The number of consecutive games Tyler Haws has scored in double figures, a career-best streak and the 4th-best streak in BYU history. 46 Matt Carlino became the 46th BYU player to score 1,000 career points when he reached the milestone against Santa Clara on Jan. 19, 2014, his 81st career game. He currently has 1,178 career points, good for 29th all-time and 13 from tying Noah Hartsock for 28th. 88.4 Tyler Haws’ career free-throw percentage, first all-time in BYU history. He has hit 503 of 569 from the line in his career. 232 Dave Rose (2005 to present) is second all-time in BYU basketball history with 232 career victories, behind only the great Stan Watts, who coached the Cougars to 371 wins from 1949 to 1972 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1986. Rose and Watts are the only BYU coaches to coach at least 300 career games. 1,901 The number of points Tyler Haws has scored in his career, good for 5th all-time and 384 from tying Devin Durrant for 4th.\n\nDave Rose\n\nBYU head coach Dave Rose has led BYU to one of the most successful runs in program history since taking over in 2005. His career record of 232-76 ranks him second in BYU history in total victories and first in winning percentage (.753). Rose has been named conference coach of the year three times, district coach of the year twice, led the Cougars to four conference titles, six NCAA Tournament appearances, two NIT appearances, six 25-win seasons and nine 20-win seasons. In 2010, he led BYU to its first NCAA Tournament win in 17 years and the Cougars have also won at least one postseason game in the three seasons since, including a spot in the Sweet 16 in 2011 and a trip to the NIT semifinals in 2013.\n\nKyle of all trades\n\nIn his first season since serving a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Russia, Kyle Collinsworth is averaging 14.0 points, 8.2 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 1.7 steals per game. He is proving to be one of the most versatile players in the WCC. As of 3/8/14, he ranks in the top 15 in the four of the five major statistical categories: 15th in scoring, 3rd in rebounding, 3rd in assists and 3rd in steals. He is also top 13 in five other categories: 13th in FG percentage, 11th in assist/turnover ratio, 6th in offensive rebounds, 4th in defensive rebounds and 6th in minutes played.\n\nWe talkin’ about a half, not a (full) game, not a (full) game, not a (full) game. We talkin’ about a half!\n\nIn 2002, NBA star Allen Iverson didn’t want to talk about practice. With BYU’s leading scorer Tyler Haws, we don’t want to talk about a full game, but just a half. In his career, Haws has scored 20 or more in a half nine times, including seven this season.\n\n30 the old fashioned way\n\nTyler Haws scored 31 points against Loyola Marymount while hitting 9 of 19 from the field and 13 of 14 from the free throw line. He joined Brandon Davies (33 vs. Weber State on Dec. 15, 2012) as the only other player to score 30-plus points without hitting a three since Keena Young scored 34 vs. UNLV on March 10, 2007. The last BYU wing/guard to score 30 without hitting a three was Travis Hansen on Jan. 5, 2002 when he netted 30 against Pepperdine. Prior to Hansen, the last guard to score 30-plus was Marty Haws, Tyler’s father, on Jan. 4, 1990 vs. Hawaii.\n\n30 without a free throw\n\nMatt Carlino tied his career high with 30 points against Portland without making a free throw. It was only the fifth game in BYU history in which a BYU player has scored 30-plus points without making a free throw.\n\nCougars leading the league\n\nIn each of BYU’s three seasons in the WCC, the Cougars have had the leading scorer in all games (Noah Hartsock in 2011-12, Tyler Haws in 2012-13, Haws in 2013-14) and in league games (Brandon Davies in 2011-12, Tyler Haws in 2012-13, Haws in 2013-14). Only one other school (Loyola Marymount from 1988-89 to 1991-92) has had the league’s leading scorer in at least three-straight seasons in all games. In league games, a school has had the league’s leading scorer in at least three-straight seasons three other times (San Francisco from 2006-07 to 2008-09, Loyola Marymount from 1982-83 to 1985-86 and Loyola Marymount from 1987-88 to 1991-92).\n\nRose among the nation’s best"
