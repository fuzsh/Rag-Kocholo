In the past 2 seasons, he has led the Wildcats to a 45-25 (.643) overall record, including 19 wins in Big 12 play, with consecutive postseason appearances (2023 NCAA Tournament, 2024 NIT) highlighted by the run to the Elite Eight. He is one of just 4 head coaches (Lon Kruger, Frank Martin and Bruce Weber) in school history to help the Wildcats to the postseason in their first 2 seasons.\n\nTang recently inked a 1-year contract extension with the Wildcats through the 2030-31 season.\n\nAmong his 45 wins at K-State are 11 against teams ranked in the Top 25, including 6 Top 10 opponents. The 11 career Top 25 wins are the fifth-most in school history, while the 6 against Top 10 competition tie for the fourth-most. Nine of the 11 ranked wins have come in the friendly confines of Bramlage Coliseum, where Tang is 29-4 (.879) overall, including 15-3 (.833) in Big 12 play and 9-2 (.818) against ranked foes. The 9 career home Top 25 wins tie legendary coach Jack Hartman for the second-most in school history.\n\nIn addition to the wins over ranked teams, Tang’s teams have also proved to be clutch in his short tenure, posting a perfect 12-0 mark in overtime games, including an NCAA single-season record 7 such wins in 2023-24. The 12-game overtime winning streak is the second-longest such streak in Division I history since 1950 and the second-longest current streak behind Florida State (14; 2018-present) and right ahead of Winthrop (10; 2017-present). Including his time as interim head coach at Baylor, Tang is now 13-0 in overtime games.\n\nThe 12 total overtime wins are the third-most by a head coach in school history, trailing Hall of Famers Tex Winter (15) and Jack Hartman (14), despite coming in just 70 career games.\n\nTang has helped reestablish the “Octagon of Doom” as one of the toughest places to play in college basketball, as the Wildcats have played before nine sellouts while posting a 29-4 record at home with 9 wins over Top 25 opponents, including a pair of top-5 wins over arch-rival Kansas, two over top-10 Baylor and No. 6/6 Iowa State. The 15 wins in 2022-23 were the most in nearly a decade (2014-15) and tied for the second-most in the arena’s 35-year history. The eight sellouts in 2022-23 were the most since 2014-15, while the team ranked 23rd nationally in percentage capacity at 87.57 percent in the newly configured 11,000-seat arena.\n\nDespite losing a pair of All-Americans in Keyontae Johnson and Markquis Nowell as well as a third starter in Nae’Qwan Tomlin right before the season, Tang kept the Wildcats in the NCAA Tournament conversation until the very end of the season before receiving a bid to the NIT, where they lost in the first round at Iowa. The team posted a 19-15 overall record, which included a tie for ninth with Oklahoma in the new 14-team Big 12 with an 8-10 mark. Among the 19 wins were 10 over teams that advanced to the postseason (6 NCAA Tournament and 4 NIT teams), including No. 9/9 Baylor, No. 4/4 Kansas, No. 25/21 BYU and No. 6/6 Iowa State.\n\nThe victories over the Bears and Jayhawks both came in overtime, as the Wildcats set a new Division single-season record with 7 overtime wins, breaking the mark of 6 set by Wake Forest (1983-84), Chattanooga (1988-89) and Lafayette (2007-08). The 7 overtime wins also broke the school record of 5, set in 1992-93 and 2022-23, while it is the most overtime games in school history (5 total set in 1992-93 and 2022-23). The 6 overtime home wins are also a Division I record, surpassing the 5 by Cincinnati in 1966-67.\n\nK-State enjoyed a fast start to the 2023-24 season, winning 14 of its first 18 games, including 4 of 5 in Big 12 play, highlighted by 5 overtime victories – Providence, Oral Roberts, North Alabama, Villanova and No. 9/9 Baylor. Three of those 5 overtime wins came in a row at home in a feat not accomplished in nearly 60 years (1964). However, a 1-7 slide over a 4-week span in late January to mid-February derailed the promising start with 5 of those 7 losses coming to teams that advanced to the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats did win 4 of their last 6 games, including at home over No. 25/21 BYU and No. 6/6 Iowa State and over Texas at the Big 12 Championship.\n\nNewcomers Arthur Kaluma and Tylor Perry were both All-Big 12 honorable mention selections to cap the season, as Kaluma was one of four Big 12 players to rank in the top-15 in both scoring and rebounding in 2023-24 while Perry was among the league’s top scorers, ranking eighth in the league at 15.3 points per game. Perry led the Big 12 in minutes (36.41) and was second in 3-point field goals (2.74) and free throw percentage (90.9).\n\nKaluma and Perry were high-level transfer portal additions for Tang and his staff in 2023-24, which also included a top-35 high school recruiting class. They have continued to attract high-level talent this off-season with the additions of seven Division I transfers (Achor Achor, Baye Fall, Brendan Hausen, C.J. Jones, Max Jones, Dug McDaniel and Ugonna Onyenso), a junior college All-American (Mobi Ikegwuruka) and a top-50 high school senior (David Castillo).\n\nThe success in year two came on the heels of a historic inaugural campaign in 2022-23, in which, Tang guided K-State to its third-highest win total (26) and a thrilling run to the Elite Eight despite returning just two players and being picked to finish last in the preseason Big 12 poll. The Wildcats posted a 26-10 overall record, which included a tie for third place in the nation’s most difficult conference – the Big 12 – with an 11-7 mark and the school’s 13th appearance in the Elite Eight and the first since 2017-18.\n\nThe 26 wins are the third-most in school history, trailing the school-record 29 in 2009-10 and the 27 in 2012-13, and just the eighth 25-win campaign. His 26 wins are the second-most by a first-year head coach in school history.\n\nTang became the 11th first-year head coach to direct his team to the Elite Eight since 1996-97, while joining North Carolina’s Bill Guthridge (K-State alum) in 1997-98 and Hubert Davis in 2021-22 and Kent State’s Stan Heath in 2001-02 as one of four first-time head coaches to accomplish the feat. Tang's win total was the second-most by a first-year Division I head coach.\n\nIn guiding K-State to the Elite Eight in his first season, Tang became just the third coach in the program's history to be selected National Coach of the Year, joining Fred \"Tex\" Winter (UPI) in 1958 and Jack Hartman (NABC) in 1980. He was a candidate for nearly every other National Coach of the Year honor in 2022-23, including finishing as the runner-up for The Associated Press award. In addition, he was the consensus Big 12 Coach of the Year, earning the honor from both the league coaches and the AP.\n\nDuring the team’s historic season, Tang coached a pair of All-Americans in 2023 Bob Cousy Award winner Markquis Nowell and small forward Keyontae Johnson, who became the first duo in school history to each earn the recognition from The Associated Press when they were selected to the Third Team. Both players were named to the All-Big 12 First Team, while Johnson was the league's Newcomer of the Year.\n\nNowell was selected as the Cousy Award winner as the nation's top point guard by the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame after he finished second nationally in assists/game (8.3 apg.), total assists (297) and total steals (92) while ranking in the top-15 in four others. He was chosen the NCAA East Regional Most Outstanding Player after guiding the Wildcats to the Elite Eight, averaging 23.5 points, 13.5 assists and 4.0 steals in his 4-game NCAA Tournament run, which included a tournament and school-record 19-assist performance in the win over Michigan State. He was also named a Third Team All-American by The Sporting News, NABC and U.S. Basketball Writers Association.\n\nJohnson was a finalist for the Julius Erving Small Forward Award by the Naismith Hall of Fame, along with Alabama’s Brandon Miller, Gonzaga’s Julian Strawther, Kansas’ Jalen Wilson and UCLA’s Jamie Jaquez Jr.\n\nFollowing the season, Johnson became the first Wildcat under Tang and the first since 2017 to be selected in the NBA Draft, as he was taken in the second round with the 50th pick by the Oklahoma City Thunder. He is the 13th draft pick developed by Tang, which includes 11 at Baylor and one at Heritage Christian Academy (Von Wafer). In addition, Nowell signed a 2-way contract with the Toronto Raptors on draft night.\n\nThe 2022-23 Wildcats set three school single-season records, including shattering the mark for assists (611), while finishing No. 2 in points (2,742), field goals made (961), 3-point field goals made (258), free throw percentage (74.8) and steals (289) in school history. The 46.1 field goal percentage tied for the seventh-best in the shot clock era and the best since 2017-18. Nowell crushed the single-season marks for assists (297) and steals (92) while he and Johnson became just the second duo in school history to each tally 600 or more points in a single season.\n\nTang came to K-State in 2022 after helping build Baylor into a national powerhouse in his 19 seasons (2003-22) as an assistant and associate head coach.\n\n“I am beyond excited to be the next head basketball coach at Kansas State,” said Tang upon his hiring on March 21, 2022. “Having the opportunity to build on a program with a rich basketball history at a prestigious university is truly a blessing. We look forward to bringing an exciting style of basketball to K-State while helping our student-athletes succeed on the court and in life. My family and I can’t wait to get to Manhattan and form deep relationships with our students, former players, alumni and Wildcat fans everywhere. We look forward to making the Octagon of Doom the best home court advantage in the country!”\n\nOverall, Tang has a 47-25 (.653) record as a head coach, which includes 2 wins while serving as the interim head coach at Baylor in 2012-13. Those 2 wins came in Big 12 play, including an 87-79 overtime victory over archrival Texas in Waco and an 82-48 road win at Texas Tech. He stepped in on 4 occasions as the Bears’ interim head coach, which also includes the first 2 games of the 2020-21 national title season in Las Vegas against Louisiana (112-82) and Washington (86-52). Those wins don’t count since they came while head coach Scott Drew was out due to COVID-19 health and safety protocols.\n\nTang's success as a head coach has not come as a surprise after he built a powerhouse at Heritage Christian Academy in Cleveland, Texas over a 10-year period (1993-2003) before starting his tenure at Baylor in 2003.\n\nAT BAYLOR (2003-22)\n\nTang was an original member of head coach Scott Drew’s staff and played an instrumental role in building the Bears program from one rocked by scandal and NCAA probation into one that has developed into one of the nation’s top programs highlighted by the 2021 NCAA Championship and consecutive Big 12 regular-season titles in 2021 and 2022. He served his first 14 seasons (2003-17) as an assistant coach before being promoted to associate head coach in 2017.\n\nDuring his time at Baylor, Tang helped the Bears post a 397-222 (.641) overall record, including a 168-155 (.520) mark in Big 12 play, to go with 13 postseason appearances (10 NCAA Tournaments, 3 NITs), one NCAA title (2021), one NIT title (2013) and one NIT runner-up finish (2009). In the process, he assisted in the development of 11 All-Americans, including consensus selections Johnathan Motley (2017) and Jared Butler (2021), a National Defensive Player of the Year in Davion Mitchell (2021) and 58 All-Big 12 honorees, including nine on the First Team.\n\nIn addition to his prowess on the bench, Tang helped construct nine consensus Top 25 recruiting classes while at Baylor, including 2010 (Perry Jones III), 2011 (Quincy Miller and Deuce Bello), 2012 (Isaiah Austin, Prince and Rico Gathers), 2013 (Ishmail Wainright, Al Freeman and Johnathan Motley) and the highest-ranked class in program history at No. 4 in 2021 (Kendall Brown, Langston Love and Jeremy Sochan).\n\nStarting with the 2007-08 season, Tang was a pivotal part in helping Baylor to a stretch of 15 consecutive seasons of at least 18 wins, including a school-record 30 in 2011-12, en route to a 361-153 (.702) record and 10 NCAA Tournament appearances. Starting in 2010, the Bears appeared in the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 five times (2010, 2012, 2014, 2017, 2021) with three trips to the Elite Eight (2010, 2012, 2021) and one to the Final Four (2021).\n\nAdditionally, 14 Bears have gone on to play in the NBA, including Quincy Acy, Jared Butler, Freddie Gillespie, Pierre Jackson, Cory Jefferson, Perry Jones III, Quincy Miller, Davion Mitchell, Johnathan Motley, Royce O’Neale, Taurean Prince, MaCio Teague, Ekpe Udoh and Ish Wainwright.\n\nDuring a three-year stretch (2019-22), Baylor tallied an 81-13 (.862) record, including a 43-8 (.843) mark in Big 12 play, with 22 wins over ranked opponents highlighted by the Bears’ first National Championship in 2021, as they defeated No. 1 ranked Gonzaga, 86-70, in the national title game. The 2021 Bears also won their first Big 12 Championship in the league’s 25-year history, which was the school’s first conference title in 71 years, then followed it up with a second-straight crown in 2022 by winning their last five conference games.\n\nBaylor’s 55-9 (.859) combined record during the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons was the nation’s best among power conference teams, while the 81-13 (.862) record since 2019-20 ranked second-best nationally, trailing only Gonzaga (90-6). In that span, the Bears were ranked in the top 5 for 29 consecutive AP Top 25 polls and finished the 2021-22 season with the nation’s third-longest active streak of 56-straight weeks ranked.\n\nDespite a season mired by injuries to key players, Tang helped Baylor navigate a successful 2021-22 season that ended in a heartbreaking 93-86 overtime loss to eventual national runner-up North Carolina in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Down 25 points with 10 minutes left, the Bears rallied to force overtime before faltering late, 93-86, to finish the season with a 27-7 overall record, including a tie for first place in the Big 12 with a 14-4 mark. The team ran their winning streak to 21 games, including 15 straight to start the year, ascending to the No. 1 ranking for five consecutive weeks. For his efforts, Tang was named the 2022 Division I Men’s Assistant Coach of the Year by the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches (TABC).\n\nThree Bears earned All-Big 12 honors in 2022, including a First Team selection by senior transfer James Akinjo. Senior Jonathan Tchamwa Tchatchoua was one of three players to share the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, while freshman Jeremy Sochan was named the league’s Sixth Man Award winner.\n\nSochan became the fourth Baylor player (and second consecutive) to be a lottery pick when he was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the No. 9 pick of the 2022 NBA Draft. Teammate Kendall Brown followed in the second round with the No. 48 selection by the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nBaylor lost just twice during its historic national championship season in 2020-21, posting a 28-2 record and a 14-1 mark in Big 12 play which included school-record 11 wins against ranked opponents. The Bears enjoyed the best start in program history with an 18-game winning streak, which was the fourth-longest streak by any team in Big 12 history. A school-record three Bears earned All-America honors, including Jared Butler becoming the first consensus First Team selection. Davion Mitchell and MaCio Teague were both Third Team All-Americans, while Mitchell swept every major National Defensive Player of the Year honors.\n\nTang helped Baylor to what was then the best season in program history in 2019-20, as the Bears spent five consecutive weeks ranked No. 1 nationally en route to posting a 26-4 record, including a 15-3 mark in league play. The team set a Big 12 record with 23 consecutive wins and were projected to earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament before it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All five starters were named to All-Big 12 teams, a first in league history, including First Team honors for Jared Butler.\n\nTang was part of the Baylor rebuild from the beginning, as he assisted Drew in guiding a Bear program that was crippled by NCAA?sanctions into one that advanced to the postseason 13 times in a 14-year span, including a streak of 11 consecutive seasons (2011-12 to 2021-22), and 15 straight winning seasons (2007-08 to 2021-22).\n\nAfter going 36-69 in their first four seasons, Tang and the Bears were rewarded with their first NCAA Tournament berth in 20 seasons and just their second at the school since 1950 in 2007-08. The team lost to No. 18 Purdue in the first round to conclude the year with a 21-11 overall record, including 9-7 in Big 12 play, as Curtis Jerrells became the program’s first All-Big 12 First Team selection since 2001.\n\nBaylor posted back-to-back 20-win seasons for the first time in school history, as the 2008-09 team advanced to its first Big 12 Championship game before finishing as the runner-up in the NIT. The Bears then made another significant step with two Elite Eight runs in a 3-year period, including the first in the modern era in 2009-10 and to cap a school-record 30-win season in 2011-12.\n\nThe 2009-10 team earned a No. 3 seed in the NCAA South Region and won the school’s first NCAA Tournament game in 60 years en route to reaching the Regional Final for the first time since 1950. The Bears were ranked throughout the 2011-12 season for the first time in program history, reaching as high as No. 3 in the polls and never dropping lower than 14th, as they won a school-record 30 games. A program-record three players (Perry Jones III, Quincy Acy and Quincy Miller) were selected in the 2012 NBA Draft.\n\nTang played a major role in leading Baylor to 23 wins and the program’s first national tournament championship in 2012-13 when the Bears went on a five-game run to the NIT title. The team then ran off a string of four consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances, including Sweet 16 runs in both 2013-14 and 2016-17.\n\nTang helped Baylor win 12 of its last 15 games, including three in a three-day span to reach the 2014 Big 12 Championship game. The Bears won 26 games and advanced to the Sweet 16 for third time in a five-year stretch in 2013-14, becoming one of only 12 programs nationally to accomplish that feat between 2010 and 2014.\n\nThe 2014-15 Baylor team won 24 games, including seven over Top 25 opponents, and earned a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament, tying for the best seed in program history and earning back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances for the first time in school history. Three Bears (Kenny Chery, Rico Gathers and Taurean Prince) earned All-Big 12 honors, while Gathers was named an All-American.\n\nBaylor continued its streak of NCAA Tournament appearances in 2015-16 and 2016-17, as the Bears reached new heights by earning their first No. 1 national ranking on January 9, 2017.\n\nThe 2016-17 team rolled to a 15-0 start in 2016-17, climbing from unranked to No. 1 nationally in an eight-week span. They recorded victories over four Top 10 teams, including No. 4 Oregon, No. 7 Xavier and No. 10 Louisville in the first eight games. The Bears made a third Sweet 16 in a six-year span with victories over New Mexico State and USC to finish the year at No. 12 in AP poll. Four Bears (Johnathan Motley, Manu Lecomte, Jo Lual-Acuil, Jr. and Ish Wainright) earned All-Big 12 accolades with Motley winning the 2017 Karl Malone Power Forward of the Year Award and becoming the school’s first consensus All-American.\n\nAlthough injuries led to a 2-7 start in Big 12 play and derailed a fifth-straight NCAA Tournament appearance in 2017-18, Baylor rallied to win seven of its last 12 games to finish the season with 19 wins and earn a seventh consecutive postseason appearance, advancing to the second round of the NIT.\n\nBaylor extended its school-record streak to eight consecutive postseason appearances in 2018-19, as the Bears posted a 20-14 overall record and made a return to the NCAA Tournament. The squad went from being picked ninth in the Big 12 preseason poll to winning 10 league games and finishing fourth despite losing four projected starters to injuries throughout the season.\n\nAT HERITAGE CHRISTIAN (1993-2003)\n\nPrior to his time at Baylor, Tang built a powerhouse at Heritage Christian Academy, a birth-through-high school private school in Cleveland, Texas, as both the head coach and athletic director, guiding the Eagles to four TAPPS Division A state championships (1995, 1999, 2000, 2001) from 1993 to 2003. His program gained national attention in 2001 when Cedrick Hensley scored 101 points in a game.\n\nTang became known for producing Division I athletes at Heritage Christian, including his most-publicized recruit Vakeaton “Von” Wafer, a 2003 McDonald’s All-American who played at Florida State and was drafted by the L.A. Lakers in 2005. His last two teams featured a number of Division I signees including Cedrick Hensley (Houston), Elijah Miller (Houston), Marlon Pompey (Texas A&M), Lamar Hurd (Oregon State), Tim Mayes (Richmond) and Tyler Jones (St. John’s).\n\nPERSONAL\n\nTang was born in San Fernando, Trinidad.
