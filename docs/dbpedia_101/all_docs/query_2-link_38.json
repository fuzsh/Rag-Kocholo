        "text": "Gonzaga’s ongoing 60-game home winning streak far predates point guard Andrew Nembhard’s arrival at Spokane before last season. The Zags are merely 21-0 at the McCarthey Center since Nembhard transferred in from Florida.\n\nThe second-ranked Zags will try to push the record to 61 straight on Thursday night when BYU visits. Nembhard says everyone is fired up for the occasion, but that the win streak is not at all on their minds.\n\n“Most important is to just win the game,” the senior from Toronto said. “I don’t think we’re too consumed with the record.”\n\nGonzaga (12-2, 1-0) has established so many records and streaks that it would be easy to become distracted by them. In addition to being unbeaten at The Kennel since a 74-71 loss to Saint Mary’s back on January 18, 2018, the Zags have won 22 straight West Coast Conference games and 52 in a row against unranked opponents in the regular season.\n\nNembhard figures that he and his teammates have enough on their hands just dealing with BYU (14-3, 2-0). In response to the Omicron outbreak, Gonzaga officials have canceled the Tent City ticket distribution system that has students camping out on campus for a day or two before big games.\n\nEven so, the arena is expected to be jammed, which only adds fuel to the Zags. “The atmosphere in The Kennel is elite, tops around the country,” Nembhard said. “It just helps us to keep our motivation up on a daily basis. We love to win games for our fans.”\n\nAnd make no mistake, Gonzaga vs. BYU is a big game.\n\n“They’re one of the best teams in the conference every year. It’s real competitive,” Nembhard said. “It’s a game we’re definitely looking forward to. It’s just exciting.”\n\nThe Cougars are the most-recent WCC team to beat Gonzaga, having dealt the Zags a 91-78 loss in Provo on Feb. 22, 2020. Gonzaga was 27-1 and ranked No. 2 nationally then, too. Yoeli Childs had 28 points and 10 rebounds for BYU, while Drew Timme, a freshman at the time, had eight points and eight rebounds for the Zags.\n\nIn their video prep, Nembhard said the Cougars have a different look to them this season. “We’re seeing a different team than they’ve had recently,” he said. “They play a little more small ball.”\n\nWithout as much healthy size this season, BYU relies on defense and a backcourt led by senior Alex Barcello, who is fourth in the WCC in scoring at 16.6 points per game. A big surprise has been freshman Fousseyni Traore, a 6-foot-6, 254-pound forward from Mali, who reportedly has a 7-2 wingspan and is averaging 10.7 points and 10.7 rebounds the past six games.\n\n“I think it’ll be a fun game,” Nembard said.\n\nFOUR QUESTIONS FOR NEMBHARD: Nembhard has averaged 8.5 points and 4.5 assists in two seasons while helping Gonzaga to a 43-3 record over that span. Coach Mark Few calls him “as good a point guard as there is in college basketball.”\n\nBut Few also wants Nembhard to look to score more than he did in the Zags’ 117-83 win over Pepperdine on Saturday, when he dished eight assists but attempted just three shots and scored three points.\n\n“I think Andrew needs to get more selfish,” Few said. “We’ve been on him, but he’s such a great facilitator, he’s just such a gifted passer. Some of the passes he made, you go back and watch them and there aren’t many guys in the country that can make those kind of passes.”\n\nNembhard says he’s listening. “For us to win games I need to be more assertive,” he agreed. “I’ve always been a scorer, so I think I can do both for us.”\n\nHere’s more from Nembard:\n\nJeff Faraudo: Reflect on your decision to leave sunny Florida for Gonzaga?\n\nAndrew Nembhard: “I think it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made. I’ve really, truly made a family here in Spokane. I’ve learned so much on and off the court, and it’s taken my life in a positive direction.”\n\nJF: Coach Mark Few recruited you out of high school. Now that you’ve played for him for a couple seasons, what’s he been like?\n\nAN: ”He’s just been real, that's the best way to describe him. He shoots it straight on a daily basis. I know he really cares about me as a basketball player and a person.”\n\nJF: How does All-America forward Drew Timme’s sense of humor benefit your team?\n\nAN: “He’s the funniest — that’s a daily thing. He’s a great influence. That’s how this program’s runs — we take it seriously, but we also like to have fun. He does a great job of doing both those things.”\n\nJF: Freshman Chet Holmgren has been productive, but at 7 feet, 195 pounds it sometimes looks like he could be snapped in half out there. How does he do it?\n\nAN: “He is a real tough dude. A little undersized at this point, but I love working with him. He really works hard. He’s competitive and has a lot of skill for someone that size. He has a bright future ahead of him.”\n\nBYU’S ROUGH STRETCH: Having just pocketed a 52-43 win over Saint Mary’s, BYU now braces for road games Thursday against Gonzaga and Saturday vs. USF. The combined record of those three opponents: 40-9.\n\n“I’m extremely excited, super happy,” Cougar guard Trevin Knell said. “We compete, no matter if we’re making shots or missing shots. We give it our all 100% of the time. I feel like that’s what’s going to show on Thursday.”\n\nLAST WEEK’S BIG THING: The BYU women beat USF and Pacific, pushing their record to 12-1. That matches the start by the 2013-14 Cougars, who then lost at home to Pacific in their next game. This BYU squad will try to reach 13-1 on Thursday at home against Saint Mary’s.\n\nTHIS WEEK’S BIG THING: Santa Clara’s men finally get back on the court for their WCC opener at Pacific (5-10, 0-1) on Wednesday night. The Broncos (10-5) have been idle since Dec. 21, with four COVID-19 postponements in the meantime, including twice (Dec. 30 and Jan. 8) against Pacific. A victory for Santa Clara would earn coach Herb Sendek his 500th career win.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN FROM LUNARDI: ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi once more had four WCC teams in the projected NCAA tournament bracket he released on Tuesday. He’s got Gonzaga as a No. 1 seed, BYU at No. 8, USF at No. 10 and Saint Mary’s at No. 11.\n\nOn the women’s side, ESPN’s Charlie Creme gives BYU a No. 5 seed and has Gonzaga among the first four teams out of the field."
