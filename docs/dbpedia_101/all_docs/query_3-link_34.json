        "text": "Choose a Staff Member:\n\nDuane Broussard\n\nTitle\n\nAssistant Coach\n\nDuane Broussard is in his fifth season as an assistant coach at TCU.\n\nBroussard has been a part of a run that has seen the Horned Frogs make back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances for the first time in 70 seasons and win their opening round game of the NCAA Tournament in consecutive seasons for the first time in program history. In both the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, TCU finished a program-best tied for fifth place in the Big 12 and had a program-best eight Quadrant 1 wins.\n\nDuring the 2022-23 season, TCU was ranked for a program-best 15 consecutive weeks, and appeared in the final AP Top 25 Poll for the fourth time in program history and the first time since 1987. Also, that season TCU led the nation with 17.5 fastbreak points per game and recorded a program-best six wins against AP Top 25 teams.\n\nDuring the 2021-22 season, Broussard helped lead the Horned Frogs to five top 25 wins and their first NCAA Tournament win in 35 years with an opening round win over Seton Hall.\n\nIn his first season at TCU in 2019-20, Broussard helped TCU to a win over No. 2 Baylor, the Frogs’ highest-ranked home win in program history. That season, Desmond Bane became the first All-Big 12 Conference First Team player at TCU. Bane later became TCU’s first NBA Draft selection in 25 seasons when he went 30th overall.\n\nBroussard previously spent six seasons as an assistant coach at UCLA under Steve Alford and was elevated to the role of associate head coach in Oct. 2017. In six seasons, he guided the Bruins to four NCAA Tournaments (2014, 2015, 2017, 2018) and three Sweet 16 appearances (2014, 2015, 2017). His work on the recruiting trail has seen the Bruins secure four incoming classes that have been ranked in the top five, nationally, over the past five years.\n\nAs the team’s associate head coach in 2017-18, Broussard guided the Bruins to a 21-12 overall record and an 11-7 mark in the Pac-12 Conference. UCLA finished its season with an appearance in the Pac-12 Tournament’s semifinal round before playing in the NCAA Tournament’s “First Four.” Aaron Holiday earned first-team All-Pac-12 honors after becoming the first Bruin to lead the league in scoring since Reggie Miller in 1985-86.\n\nIn 2016-17, Broussard helped UCLA to a 31-5 overall record. The Bruins advanced to the Sweet 16 after having tied the school record for most regular-season victories (28, also accomplished in 2007-08).\n\nThe Bruins’ 2016-17 squad led the nation in assists per game (21.4), field goal percentage (52.5%) and assist-turnover ratio (1.91). UCLA also finished the year second in the nation in points per game (89.8) and fourth in three-point field goal percentage (40.6%). Led by a trio of first-team All-Pac-12 performers in Lonzo Ball, TJ Leaf and Bryce Alford, the Bruins set Pac-12 single-season team records for total assists (771) and made three-pointers (354).\n\nUCLA’s 2016-17 team produced one of the nation’s most high-octane offenses in recent years. The Bruins ranked No. 2 in the country in adjusted offensive efficiency (per KenPom.com). Lonzo Ball, who was one of five finalists for the John R. Wooden Award, secured National Freshman of the Year honors from nearly every national publication.\n\nThrough his first five seasons in Westwood, Broussard helped UCLA send 13 players to the NBA – Jordan Adams, Kyle Anderson, Ike Anigbogu, Lonzo Ball, Jonah Bolden, Aaron Holiday, Zach LaVine, TJ Leaf, Kevon Looney, Norman Powell, David Wear, Travis Wear and Thomas Welsh.\n\nUCLA went 22-14 in 2014-15, advancing to the Sweet 16 for the second straight season. Powell earned first-team All-Pac-12 honors before being selected in the second round of the NBA Draft.\n\nDuring his first season at UCLA (2013-14), Broussard helped the Bruins post a 28-9 record. UCLA won the Pac-12 Tournament Championship and earned the program’s first appearance in the Sweet 16 since 2008. The Bruins ranked No. 11 in the nation in scoring (81.2 points per game), No. 3 in assist turnover ratio (1.7), No. 4 in steals (9.2 spg) and No. 5 in assists (17.2 apg).\n\nBroussard arrived in Westwood in April 2013 after having spent the previous 10 seasons on the men’s basketball staff at the University of New Mexico. He worked on head coach Steve Alford’s staff at New Mexico the final five seasons – the last two years as an assistant coach after having served as Director of Operations for three seasons.\n\nThrough 25 seasons serving on college basketball staffs, both as an assistant coach and as the director of operations, Broussard has helped his teams to a combined .643 winning percentage (516-286). In 10 seasons on staff at New Mexico, Broussard helped the Lobos register a .655 winning percentage.\n\nDuring his final two seasons coaching at New Mexico, Broussard’s work proved instrumental in helping the Lobos compile a 57-13 record and win back-to-back Mountain West Conference regular season and tournament titles. New Mexico advanced to the NCAA Tournament both years. In his five years on Alford’s staff at New Mexico, the Lobos played in the postseason each year, advancing to the NCAA Tournament three times.\n\nWith Broussard on the coaching staff, New Mexico became the first school in Mountain West history to secure back-to-back regular season and tournament titles. Over the last six seasons, New Mexico produced six players who scored at least 1,000 points and won a school-record 155 games during that stretch. The Lobos became one of just three programs to win four regular-season titles in five years (along with Kansas and Gonzaga).\n\nIn 2012-13, New Mexico logged its second-highest win total in program history, posting a 29-6 overall record. Junior guard Kendall Williams secured Mountain West Conference Player of the Year honors. He finished in the top 10 in scoring in the Mountain West, in addition to ranking second in assists per game and assist turnover ratio. As a team, New Mexico ranked No. 26 nationally in field goal percentage defense and No. 38 in scoring defense.\n\nDuring his tenure as assistant coach at New Mexico, Broussard was responsible for four NBA Draft selections, all chosen in the first round – Danny Granger (2005), J.R. Giddens (2008), Darington Hobson (2010) and Tony Snell (2013).\n\nBroussard’s work with Granger was evident at Bradley and New Mexico. Granger, a 6-foot-8 forward, was selected No. 17 overall in the 2005 NBA Draft out of New Mexico. Broussard had worked with Granger during the 2001-02 season at Bradley and during Granger’s junior and senior seasons at New Mexico. Granger became the first player in UNM basketball history to log at least 60 assists, 60 blocks and 60 steals in one season (2004-05) before securing Mountain West Conference Tournament MVP honors and leading the Lobos to the NCAA Tournament. Currently playing for the Indiana Pacers, Granger graduated from New Mexico with a degree in civil engineering.\n\nAdditionally, Broussard helped the New Mexico program stay in the top-25 rankings in 16 of 18 weeks. The Lobos secured five selections on the All-Mountain West Team and produced a school record-tying 14 wins away from home.\n\nServing as an assistant coach and as the program’s Director of Operations at New Mexico, Broussard’s responsibilities included travel arrangements, community relations, scheduling and helping oversee academic progress.\n\nBroussard spent five seasons (2003-07) on head coach Ritchie McKay’s staff at UNM. He spent the 2007-08 season working as Director of Recruitment Initiatives in the Enrollment Services office on UNM’s main campus. Broussard was working with an outreach program that taught the importance of going to college and the process of college admissions to middle school students in the Albuquerque area.\n\nBroussard served on the men’s basketball staff for nine seasons at Bradley University (Peoria, Ill.), working as an assistant coach the final six years (1997-2002) under head coach Jim Molinari. As an assistant coach, Broussard’s responsibilities for the Braves included recruiting, floor coaching and budget planning.\n\nA four-year basketball letterwinner at Bradley (1990-93), Broussard served as the program’s co-captain during his junior and senior seasons. Former UNM head coach Ritchie McKay served as an assistant coach during Broussard’s final two seasons with the Braves. He capped his collegiate career in 1993 by earning the inaugural Downtown Peoria Kiwanis Club Leadership Award in recognition of his positive role-model approach to academics and community service.\n\nIn nine seasons on the men’s basketball staff at Bradley (1994-2002), Broussard helped the Braves win 58 percent of their games, an average of nearly 18 contests per season. Bradley advanced to the postseason in six of nine years while Broussard served on the staff and the program graduated 19 of 22 seniors during that span.\n\nA native of Sugar Land, Texas, Broussard graduated from Bradley in 1993, earning degrees in criminal justice and sociology, in addition to a minor in history. He continued his education by earning a master’s degree in public service administration from Bradley in 1997.\n\nBroussard, is married to the former Holly Marshall. The couple has one daughter, McKenzie, and one son, McKel, who is a sophomore on the UTEP football team."
