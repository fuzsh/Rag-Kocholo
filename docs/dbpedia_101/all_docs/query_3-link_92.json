        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. – Air Force football player Trey Taylor and Colorado State thrower Mya Lesnar are the 2023-24 Mountain West Male and Female Athlete of the Year, respectively.\n\nEstablished by the Mountain West Joint Council in May 2010, the MW Athlete of the Year Awards are bestowed annually to one male and one female student-athlete who has achieved athletic excellence during the past academic year. In addition to superior athletic achievement, MW Athlete of the Year Award criteria require that nominees be in good academic standing throughout their season of competition and demonstrate good character and conduct on and off the playing field.\n\nTaylor is the second straight Air Force cadet-athlete to be named the MW Male Athlete of the Year and the fourth Falcon overall, male or female, to earn the award since its inception in 2009-10. A seventh-round draft pick of the Las Vegas Raiders in April, Taylor turned in an outstanding final season for Air Force, highlighted by winning the Paycom Jim Thorpe Award as the nation’s best defensive back.\n\nA native of Frisco, Texas, Taylor also claimed the Defender of the Nation Award and earned the East-West Shrine Bowl Pat Tillman Award, which is presented to the player who best exemplifies character, intelligence, sportsmanship and service. In addition to being a first-team All-Mountain West selection, Taylor earned All-America honors from several organizations, including a first-team nod from the AFCA to become the Falcons’ first first-team All-American since 2010. He was also named the Colorado College Male Athlete of the Year by the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nTaylor finished the 2023 season with 74 tackles (40 solo) and three interceptions. He helped Air Force to a 9-4 overall record and a win over James Madison in the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl. Taylor also helped the Falcons spend three weeks in the national rankings, including an appearance at No. 25 in the initial CFP Selection Committee Rankings of the season.\n\nLesnar is Colorado State’s second MW Female Athlete of the Year and first since Danielle Minch in 2010-11. She becomes CSU’s fourth winner of a MW Athlete of the Year award overall. She was the national champion in the indoor shot put and rewrote the MW record book in 2024.\n\nAfter winning the 2024 Mountain West individual indoor titles in the weight throw and indoor shot put, the latter with a MW-record throw of 19.10 meters, and helping the Rams to the team title, Lesnar was named the MW Women’s Outstanding Field Performer of the meet and later the MW Women’s Indoor Track and Field Student-Athlete of the Year. She would go on to win Colorado State’s first women’s indoor national championship in program history, entering the NCAA meet with the nation’s top mark in the shot put and winning the title with her fourth throw of the day.\n\nLesnar added another All-America honor during the outdoor season in the spring, finishing fifth at the NCAA meet in the shot put. She also claimed two more MW individual titles, winning the shot put and hammer throw to earn 2024 MW Women’s Field Performer of the Meet honors. The Alexandria, Minnesota, native shattered the MW record in the shot put with a heave of 19.08 meters en route to helping CSU to another team title.\n\nMW MALE AND FEMALE ATHLETES OF THE YEAR ALL-TIME LIST OF HONOREES\n\n2023-24\n\nTrey Taylor, Football, Air Force\n\nMya Lesnar, Women’s Track & Field, Colorado State\n\n2022-23\n\nSam Gilman, Men’s Track & Field/Cross Country, Air Force\n\nAmelia Mazza-Downie, Women’s Track & Field/Cross Country, New Mexico\n\n2021-22\n\nTrey McBride, Football, Colorado State\n\nKristie Schoffield, Women’s Cross Country/Track & Field, Boise State\n\n2020-21\n\nAvery Williams, Football, Boise State\n\nMahala Norris, Women’s Cross Country/Track & Field, Air Force\n\n2019-20\n\nMalachi Flynn, Men’s Basketball, San Diego State\n\nWeini Kelati, Women’s Cross Country/Track & Field, New Mexico\n\n2018-19\n\nRyan Jensen, Baseball, Fresno State\n\nAllie Ostrander, Women’s Outdoor Track and Field, Boise State\n\n2017-18\n\nRashaad Penny, Football, San Diego State\n\nAllie Ostrander, Women’s Outdoor Track and Field, Boise State\n\n2016-17\n\nJosh Kerr, Men’s Track and Field, New Mexico\n\nAllie Ostrander, Women’s Track and Field, Boise State\n\n2015-16\n\nPatrick Corona, Men’s Cross Country/Track and Field, Air Force\n\nCourtney Frerichs, Women’s Cross Country/Track and Field, New Mexico\n\n2014-15\n\nGarrett Grayson, Football, Colorado State\n\nEmma Bates, Women’s Cross Country/Track & Field, Boise State\n\n2013-14\n\nDerek Carr, Football, Fresno State\n\nEmma Bates, Women’s Cross Country/Track & Field, Boise State\n\n2012-13\n\nDJ Peterson, Baseball, New Mexico\n\nShanieka Thomas, Women’s Track & Field, San Diego State\n\n2011-12\n\nKurt Felix, Men’s Track & Field, Boise State\n\nWhitney Gipson, Women’s Track & Field, TCU\n\n2010-11\n\nJimmer Fredette, Men’s Basketball, BYU\n\nDanielle Minch, Women’s Volleyball, Colorado State\n\n2009-10\n\nJerry Hughes, Football, TCU\n\nJodi Ewart, Women’s Golf, New Mexico\n\n–mw–"
