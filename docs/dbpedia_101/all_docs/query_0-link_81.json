        "text": "LAWRENCE, Kan. – Sophomore guard Andrew White III will be leaving the University of Kansas and the men’s basketball team, KU head coach Bill Self announced Thursday.\n\n“We’re definitely disappointed about this, but also respect Andrew and the decision he’s made,” Self said. “Andrew and I talked periodically throughout the season and at the end of the season we discussed what his role could be potentially moving forward. He had a very good spring and we talked again today. He feels it is in his, and his family’s, best interest to pursue some other opportunities.”\n\nWhite played 25 games his freshman season averaging 5.0 minutes and 2.2 points per game in 2012-13. This past season the 6-7 Richmond, Virginia, native appeared in 19 games and averaged 5.9 minutes and 2.3 points. White excelled in the classroom being named to the Athletic Director’s and Big 12 Commissioner’s honor rolls two times: fall 2012 and spring 2013.\n\n“I spoke with my family and the coaches several times throughout the spring and after the season ended, discussing what my expected role would be on the team,” White said. “Coach Self told me it would be questionable to break into the rotation. My family and I decided it would be the best choice to move on and explore other school options. I feel like every day I gave maximum effort and gave everything in my power to the program. I feel I made the best out of my situation.”\n\nA three-point sharpshooter, White scored a career-high 15 points against Belmont (12.15.12) his freshman and made multiple threes in five games over the course of his two seasons at KU. He pulled down a personal best six rebounds against Oregon State (11.30.12) his rookie year. His best outing as a sophomore was a 13-point effort against Towson (11.22.13) which included 4-for-6 from the field and 3-for-4 from three-point range.\n\n“We respect everything about Andrew White,” Self said. “He’s been a great ambassador for our school. He’s a terrific student and terrific young man. He’s been nothing but positive and a great teammate for everyone in our program. He will be dearly missed. We wish him nothing but the best and we will do everything we possibly can to assist him with this move. Understand this, Andrew and I have talked about this, he will always be welcome in any capacity coming back to the University of Kansas because we think that highly of him.”\n\n“I’d like to thank the entire KU staff – the academic staff, trainers, strength and conditioning staff, managers – anybody who has ever supported me,” White said. “I’d like to thank the coaching staff for giving me the opportunity to be here and taking me under their wing and teaching me all the things they have throughout my two years here. Most importantly my teammates; I look at those guys like brothers. I actually talked to them right after I talked with Coach Self so we could discuss it amongst the team because I’ve always been a team-first guy. I’m going to miss those guys a great deal. I’m going to miss all of the fans that support Kansas basketball because those are the people that make a program like this go. They are important to us and I definitely feel the generosity and love from those people who have supported me and my career.”\n\nKUAthletics.com: The official online source for Kansas Athletics, Williams Education Fund contributions, tickets, merchandise, multimedia, photos and much, much more."
