        "text": "With a resume that includes 20 postseason appearances and three conference coach of the year awards, along with demonstrated player and staff development, Herb Sendek is entering his eighth season as Santa Clara's head men's basketball coach in 2023-24. In his seven previous seasons, he has accumulated a 120-94 (.561) record.\n\nSendek, who was hired on March 29, 2016 as the 15th head coach in school history, is among the most successful coaches in Santa Clara basketball history. In his seven-year tenure, the Broncos have posted six winning records, including five-straight entering 2023-24. He is the eighth coach in program history to reach 100 wins, and his 120 victories rank sixth-best in program history.\n\nThe last four seasons of the Sendek Era has been one of the most successful stretches for any coach in Bronco history. Santa Clara has won 76 games since 2019-20, which ranks as the third-winningest four-year stretch in program history, and the most since Carroll Williams guided SCU to 79 wins from 1981-83 to 1984-85. Three of those four seasons saw the Broncos post 20 or more wins with the lone exception being the 2020-21 campaign, which was shortened to only 20 total games due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith five-consecutive winning seasons, the Broncos are currently in the midst of their longest winning season stretch since Dick Davey led the team to seven-straight winning campaigns from 1994-95 through 2000-01. The last two seasons have been particularly impressive with Sendek guiding SCU to 44 total wins, back-to-back third-place finishes in the WCC standings and back-to-back postseason appearances in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT).\n\nA native of Pittsburgh, Sendek is entering his 30th season as a collegiate head coach in 2023-24, and has seen tremendous success in all four of his head-coaching tenures. With a career record of 533-389 (.579), he is tied for the 60th-most wins in NCAA Division I history and is one of 17 active head coaches with 500 career victories. He is also one of three current head coaches in the WCC with 500 wins (Mark Few and Randy Bennett), and ranks 15th in wins among current active head coaches in NCAA D1.\n\nPrior to joining the Broncos, Sendek served as head coach at Arizona State, North Carolina State and Miami (Ohio). In those three stints, he compiled a 413-295 (.583) record, including 39 victories against top 25 opponents. Sendek earned coach of the year honors in the Pac-10, Atlantic Coast Conference and Mid-American Conference. He was one of the three youngest coaches with 400 or more victories. Sendek is one of nine active Division I head coaches to win at least 100 games at three or more D1 schools, and is one of 13 active head coaches to win conference coach of the year honors by three or more conferences.\n\nUnder Sendek’s direction, Santa Clara has emerged as one of the top programs to produce NBA talent over the last couple of seasons. In 2022, Jalen Williams became the program’s highest NBA draft pick of the modern era and second-highest ever when he was selected 12th overall by the Oklahoma City Thunder. A first team All-WCC performer with the Broncos, Williams went on to have a tremendous rookie season with the Thunder, finishing runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nThe following year saw yet another Bronco hear his name called in the first round of the NBA Draft, as WCC Co-Player of the Year Brandin Podziemski was selected 19th overall by the Golden State Warriors. In doing so, Santa Clara became one of just five programs to produce back-to-back top-20 picks in the 2022 and 23 NBA Drafts, joined by Kentucky, Duke, Kansas and Baylor. Additionally, Santa Clara became one of just three current WCC programs to ever produce back-to-back first round selections (Gonzaga and San Francisco).\n\nWilliams and Podziemski are just the latest beneficiaries of Sendek’s pipeline to the NBA which include fellow first-rounders James Harden (Arizona State), Julius Hodge (NC State) and Wally Szczerbiak (Miami).\n\nIn Sendek’s seven seasons, 11 Broncos have earned a total of 18 All-WCC honors with seven first team selections (see chart below) with three earning all-region honors.\n\nThe 2022-23 season as a whole was among the best of the Sendek Era. The team won 23 games, all in the regular season, which not only is the most of Sendek’s tenure, but ranks as the fourth-most in program history. The Broncos were 11-5 in WCC play to finish third in the standings for the second-consecutive year, and their 11 league wins were the most for SCU since 1994-95 when the Broncos were WCC regular-season champions with a 12-2 record.\n\nSanta Clara closed the 2022-23 regular season on a seven-game win streak – their longest since 1997-98 – and made a second-consecutive postseason appearance in the NIT. The Broncos swept BYU in the regular season for the first time since 1961-62, which included their first win in Provo since 1972. Podziemski became the first Bronco since 2008 (John Bryant) to earn WCC Player of the Year honors in addition to being named the WCC Newcomer of the Year. He was one of three players to earn All-WCC honors along with Carlos Stewart (1st) and Keshawn Justice (2nd).\n\nThe 2021-22 season saw the Broncos finish the year with a 21-12 record while earning a bid to the NIT for the program's first postseason appearance in either the NCAA Tournament or NIT since 1996. Among those 21 wins was victory No. 500 for Sendek’s illustrious career. The team posted a 10-5 mark in league play and closed the regular season with a 12-3 record over the final 15 games to lock up third place in the WCC standings – SCU’s best finish in league play since 2006-07.\n\nAmong the many highlights of 2021-22 was the Broncos breaking a streak of 43 consecutive losses to Associated Press top-25 teams. Sendek guided the Broncos to a 77-72 victory over No. 22 Saint Mary’s on Feb. 8th in the Leavey Center to give SCU their first victory over a ranked opponent since 2004. Led by All-WCC performers Jalen Williams, Josip Vrankic and Keshawn Justice, the Broncos also had marquee victories over Stanford, TCU, Nevada and BYU (first time since 2017) and finished the year ranked 11th nationally in field goal percentage (48.4) and 16th in 3-point shooting percentage (37.8). Santa Clara was one of just four teams to produce two first team All-WCC performers (Williams and Vrankic) at seasons end.\n\nIn the shortened 2020-21 campaign, despite navigating Covid-19 restrictions and a relocation for more than six weeks to practice and play in Santa Cruz, Calif., the Broncos were able to post a 12-8 record, which included winning their opening two games in the WCC Tournament for the first time since 2003-04.\n\nIn 2019-20, Sendek guided the program to its first 20-win campaign in seven years and only the fourth in the previous 19 seasons. The team also had a historic run at home as it continued a 17-game winning streak, which is the third-longest in school history and the most ever in Toso Pavilion/Leavey Center. Despite players missing nearly 80 total games to injury, the Broncos, who did not feature a senior on the roster, downed Washington State and Cal, which gave them a pair of victories against the Pac-12 Conference in back-to-back years for the first time in school history. Three players earned All-WCC honors at the end of the season highlighted by Vrankic (second team) and Jaden Bediako (all-freshman).\n\nSendek and his staff navigated through an injury-filled 2018-19 season to post a 16-15 overall mark, including two wins over Pac-12 schools (USC and Washington State) for the first time since 1997-98. Six players missed time, including three (KJ Feagin, Matt Hauser and Juan Ducasse) who combined to suit up for only two games. With a starting lineup that featured two sophomores (Vrankic and Tahj Eaddy) and two freshmen (Trey Wertz and Guglielmo Caruso), the Broncos still managed to finish tied for fifth in the WCC. Wertz was voted to the WCC All-Freshman team, Eaddy claimed a second-team nod and Vrankic earned all-league honorable mention.\n\nDespite having seven players miss more than a combined 70 games due to injury, Santa Clara posted a 17-16 record in 2016-17, Sendek’s first at the helm, and reached the WCC Tournament semifinals for the first time in six years. Sendek led the Broncos to a five-game overall improvement, tied for the best in the league with Gonzaga at the conclusion of the WCC Tournament. The Broncos, who were tied for fourth in the conference standings, finished above .500 in league play for just the third time in the last 10 years, including first since 2012-13. They also had the best turnaround in league play with a three-game improvement (7-11 in 2015-16).\n\nSendek, who recently celebrated his 60th birthday, has one of the more impressive coaching trees in NCAA D1 with 10 former assistants, administrative assistants or graduate assistants currently serving as head coaches (see chart below). Additionally, there are eight other former head coaches who served under Sendek – Jim Christian (Boston College, Kent State, TCU, Ohio), the late Charlie Coles (Miami (Oh), Central Michigan), Larry Hunter (Western Carolina, Ohio), the late Dave Manzer (Messiah College), Barret Peery (Portland State), Mark Phelps (Drake), Lamont Smith (San Diego) and James Whitford (Ball State).\n\nPrior to arriving at Santa Clara, Sendek served nine seasons (2006-15) at Arizona State, posting five 20-win campaigns and making five postseason appearances, including two trips to the NCAAs for a program which had only three in the previous 25 years. In addition, the Sun Devils produced just three 20-win campaigns in the prior 25 seasons to his arrival.\n\nSendek, who posted a 159-137 (.537) record at the school, led ASU to three straight 20-win seasons - 2007-08 (21-13), 2008-09 (25-10) and 2009-10 (22-11) - which had not happened since 1961-63. He was the Pac-10 Coach of the Year in 2009-10 when the Sun Devils went 25-10.\n\nSendek had a very successful 10-year tenure (1996-2006) at North Carolina State, which finished with five straight appearances in the NCAA Tournament, including four with at least one victory.\n\nHe amassed a 191-132 (.591) mark with the Wolfpack, earning 2003-04 Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year. In his final five seasons, NCSU won 53 league games, with only Duke totaling more (76) in that time frame.\n\nSendek earned his first head-coaching job at Miami University when he was just 30 years old. He led the now RedHawks to the postseason in each of his three seasons (1993-96) and his winning percentage (.708/63-26) remains first in school history (minimum three years).\n\nAfter winning the 1994-95 MAC regular-season title, Miami (Ohio) earned an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, where Sendek's 12th-seeded squad defeated No. 5 seed (and 15th-ranked) Arizona before losing to 13th-ranked and fourth-seeded Virginia in overtime.\n\nHe is the only coach ever to lead Miami to postseason play in each of his first three seasons, and he reached 50 victories quicker than any other coach at the school.\n\nAfter finishing at Carnegie Mellon University in 1985, which included a stint as a volunteer assistant at Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, Sendek began an eight-year stint as a Division I assistant coach.\n\nHe served as an assistant coach at Providence College for four years (1985-89), starting under Rick Pitino and helping the Friars earn a trip to the 1987 Final Four. He spent his final season under head coach Rick Barnes with the Friars again landing in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nWith a reputation as a standout recruiter, Sendek joined Pitino at Kentucky for the 1989-90 season and remained for four years. Sports Illustrated named him one of the top 10 recruiters in the nation during 1992-93, which ended in a Final Four run for the Wildcats.\n\nComing off two years probation, Kentucky also made a trip to the 1992 Elite Eight, a run that ended in overtime against Duke on the famous Grant Hill-to-Christian Laettner last-second inbounds heave.\n\nIn addition to his on-court success, Sendek, who graduated from college with 3.95 grade-point average, has stressed academics. While at Arizona State, the program had a 100-percent senior graduation rate and the top graduation success rate in the Pac-12. He inherited a team with Academic Progress Rate (APR) scholarship penalties and posted a perfect 1,000 score in five reporting years, including each of the final four (2010-11 through 2013-14).\n\nFour Arizona State players earned master's degrees in Sendek's final three seasons and six former players came back to finish their studies.\n\nSendek was one of only three coaches who had NBA first-round picks in both the 2005 and 2006 drafts, and then followed that up in 2009 with a top-three pick (Harden at No. 3) and the first pick of the second round (Jeff Pendergraph). Jahii Carson earned Pac-12 Co-Freshman of the Year in 2012-13, while Jordan Bachynski was the 2013-14 Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nSendek is the co-author of Gen Y Now – Millennials and the Evolution of Leadership and is a member of the NCAA Ethics Coalition. He and his wife, Melanie, have three daughters - Kristin, Catherine and Kelly.\n\nWhat They've Said About Sendek…\n\n\"My family and I couldn't be more excited for Coach Sendek and his family. First of all, he is a great coach. Santa Clara University should be so excited. He brings an unmatched commitment level to work every day. He takes tremendous pride in the development of his players, coaches, and staff in all areas of their life. He impacted me in so many ways and continues to do so to this day. The University as a whole, alums and the campus community will not have a better advocate on their behalf, he represents character and class at all times\"\n\n- Archie Miller, former head coach at Dayton and Indiana who served as a Sendek assistant at NC State and Arizona State\n\n\"Santa Clara hit a grand slam. I've been very blessed to be friends with Coach Sendek for about the last 10 years. I would go down and watch his practices and the way he coached his team on a daily basis was impressive. He's a man of the highest integrity. His players are going to represent Santa Clara in the best of all ways. They're going to be well prepared on the court. I know it's a terrific academic school and coach's teams have always done well academically. He preaches balance to these young men in their lives in terms of being the best players they can be but also being the best students. He's the finest teacher of the game I've ever been around. There is nobody who cares more about doing things the right way than Coach Sendek. I hope Santa Clara knows how blessed they are to get a man of his stature. He's been a coach of the year in three different conferences. What he brings to the school is instant credibility and recognition.\"\n\n- Doug Collins, former ESPN analyst and former head coach of the Chicago Bulls and All-NBA player\n\n\"In Herb Sendek, Santa Clara has hired one of the most respected head coaches in college basketball. He has the complete and total understanding of how to run a program. His teams always embody the qualities of unselfishness, purpose and great effort. This is a direct reflection of the experience and intelligence of Herb. Santa Clara will experience tremendous development under his guidance.\"\n\n- Sean Miller, former head coach at Xavier and Arizona who served as a Sendek assistant at Miami (Ohio) and NC State\n\n\"I've known Herb for over 30 years, and I can truly say my relationship with him is one of my most cherished in the game of basketball. Herb is a great basketball mind, and I've learned an incredible amount about the game from him over the years, from my time playing for him in college, coaching alongside him at Kentucky, and most importantly as a friend just talking about the game.\"\n\n- Billy Donovan, current Chicago Bulls head coach who played under Sendek at Providence and coached with him at Kentucky\n\nVideos: Sendek Introductory News Conference | Sendek Campus Welcome | Sendek Talks Goals, Santa Clara Community\n\nPhoto Galleries: News Conference/Campus Welcome | Throwing Out First Pitch at Baseball\n\nSENDEK'S COACHING TREE\n\nCoach\n\nCurrent School\n\nWith Sendek as Asst.
