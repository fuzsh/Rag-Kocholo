Four of those played in the NCAA Tournament, including Weber State, BYU, New Mexico and San Diego State. Illinois State, South Dakota State, Wyoming and Fresno State all played in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI), while Utah Valley played in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT).\n\nFeatured home non-conference games include in-state rivals Weber State and BYU, as well as hosting Santa Clara. The Aggies have some key non-conference road match-ups, traveling to USC, Mississippi State, Illinois State and UC Davis, as well as a Beehive state battle at Utah Valley.\n\n“Our non-conference schedule has lots of challenges and should help our team mature and get ready for conference play,” Morrill said.\n\nUSU will also have an 18-game Mountain West ledger, as the Aggies are in their second year in the conference, and Utah State hosts nine league games and plays nine road league games. The Aggies will have home-and-home games against Air Force, Boise State, Fresno State, Nevada, New Mexico, San José State, UNLV and Wyoming, while only playing Colorado State and San Diego State once, playing at SDSU and hosting CSU.\n\n“As we know, the Mountain West is one of the best basketball leagues in the country,” Morrill said. “I believe if our team stays positive and gains confidence as the year goes along, we will have a chance to surprise and be better than expected.”\n\nUtah State will also be hosting the three-day, six-game World Vision Classic, sponsored by Gossner Foods on Thursday through Saturday, Dec. 18-20, welcoming Cal State Bakersfield, Idaho State and South Dakota State to the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum.\n\nThe Aggies start their ledger with a pair of exhibition games against Texas A&M-International in a Halloween match-up on Friday, Oct. 31, and Arkansas-Fort Smith on Friday, Nov. 7.\n\nUSU officially opens the 2014-15 season against in-state foe Weber State Friday, Nov. 14.
