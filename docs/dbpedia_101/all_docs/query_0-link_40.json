The 2013-14 BYU basketball season is right around the corner and on Oct. 18, you’ll have the chance to see the Cougars in action at the inaugural ‘Boom Shakalaka: The BYU Basketball Showcase.’\n\nBoom Shakalaka will be held on Friday, Oct. 18, in the Smith Fieldhouse at 7 p.m. MT and will be televised live on BYUtv and BYUtvsports.com. Dave McCann and Blaine Fowler will call the action as the men’s basketball team and members of the women’s team will compete in a 3-point shootout, a skills competition and a slam dunk contest.\n\nFans are encouraged to pack the Fieldhouse to cheer on their favorite players and get ready for the upcoming season. The event will feature promotions and giveaways for fans in the arena and on social media as well as live music by recording artists Can't Stop Won't Stop (see samples of their music below). Stay tuned to BYUcougars.com and @BYUbasketball for more information in the coming weeks."
