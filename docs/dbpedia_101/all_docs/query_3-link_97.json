However, BYU scored the first six points of OT and won the game when Avry Holmes' potential game-winning three-pointer and valiant put back effort by Tim Derksen missed their marks.\n\nLast Time Out\n\nUSF fell to San Diego, 57-56 Thursday night in Memorial Gymnasium, dropping the Dons' record below the .500 mark for the first time this season. The Dons built a 33-28 lead at halftime, but managed to shoot just 28.6 percent in scoring 23 second half points.

The Dons came up empty on their next five possessions, however had a chance to win the game in the final seconds before Chris Anderson stole the ball from Matt Glover, preserving the Toreros one-point victory. Mark Tollefsen led all scorers with 14 points while Matt Glover added 11 to go along with nine rebounds. No Torero player scored in double figures, including Johnny Dee, who managed just four points on the night.
