John Bishop will call the action.\n\nThe audio is webcast at 1620thezone.com and can also be heard on SiriusXM channel 83, as well as https://siriusxm.us/SXM83.\n\nTelecast Information\n\nWednesday's game will be televised on CBS Sports Network, with Carter Blackburn and Pete Gillen on the call.\n\nThe competition will also be video webcast at https://www.cbssports.com/cbs-sports-network/. Cable authorization may be required.\n\nLive Stats Information\n\nAll of Creighton's games this season will have free live stats. Visit www.gocreighton.com and click on the small bar graph icon on the scoreboard at the top of the page for the event of your choosing.\n\nHome games can also be followed by those who have mobile devices with internet capability at www.gocreightonstats.com.\n\nScouting #8 Creighton\n\nRanked No. 8 nationally in both the Associated Press poll and the USA Today Coaches poll, Creighton is 8-1 this season, including a home win over Iowa (92-84) and road victories at Oklahoma State (79-65) and Nebraska (89-60).\n\nThe nucleus of the team is formed by three returning starters as senior center Ryan Kalkbrenner (15.1 ppg., 1.9 bpg., 63.2 FG%), senior forward Baylor Scheierman (18.6, 7.3 rpg., 4.0 apg) and junior guard Trey Alexander (15.9 ppg., 6.4 rpg., 4.9 apg.) all put their professional aspirations on hold and came back.\n\nAdd in senior transfer Steven Ashworth (8.9 ppg,. 3.4 apg., 41.3 3FG%), the USBWA District VII Player of the Year last year at Utah State, and it's easy to see why CU was one of three BIG EAST teams picked in the top-10 nationally in the preseason.\n\nCreighton was picked to finish second of 11 teams in a preseason poll of BIG EAST coaches. It's No. 8 spot in the polls was its best preseason rank in program history.\n\nThe Bluejays boast an offense that shoots 51.3 percent from the floor and 40.2 percent from three-point land while draining a nation-leading 12.6 three-pointers per contest, which contributes to CU's 86.8 points per game. The Jays also outrebound foes by 11.2 caroms per contest.\n\nCU's defense has held teams to 63.4 points per game and allowed opponents to make just 39 three-pointers all year.\n\nScouting UNLV\n\nUNLV is 3-4 this season, including an 0-3 mark on neutral floors. The Runnin' Rebels have wins over Stetson, Pepperdine and Akron in addition to a home loss against Southern and neutral site setbacks to Florida State, Richmond and Loyola Marymount.\n\nFour men average in double-figures, a quartet led by Kalib Boone (14.0 ppg., 2.5 bpg.). Others in that grouping include Dedan Thomas Jr. (11.7 ppg.., 6.1 apg.), Luis Rodriguez (11.6 ppg., 6.1 rpg.) and Jalen Hill (11.5 ppg., 6.8 rpg.).\n\nUNLV averages 73.0 points per game on 47.3 percent shooting from the field, 33.8 percent marksmanship from deep and 69.6 percent accuracy at the line. The Rebels allow 74.4 points per game and have been outrebounded by 2.9 caroms per contest.\n\nThe Series vs. UNLV\n\nUNLV owns a 2-1 lead in the series against Creighton, though each meeting has taken place in Las Vegas.\n\nThe last time the teams met UNLV picked up a 90-59 win on Dec. 23, 1987 as part of the Rebel Round-Up. Rod Mason led CU with 14 points. UNLV was paced by 20 points from Gerald Paddio, while future NBA star Stacey Augmon had 10 points.\n\nGreg McDermott has never faced UNLV, nor coached against Kevin Kruger.\n\nThe Creighton Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) owns a 308-151 record in his 14th season with the Bluejays. He ranks 16th among active coaches in victories with a career mark of 588-346 in his 30th season, and is 457-282 in his 23rd Division I campaign.\n\nMcDermott led Creighton to its first BIG EAST regular-season title in 2019-20, taking a Bluejay team that was picked seventh in the league's preseason poll and ending the year ranked seventh nationally. The Cascade, Iowa native has coached Creighton to a share of its first regular-season BIG EAST title in 2019-20 its first Sweet 16 since 1974 in 2020-21 and its first Elite Eight since 1941 in 2022-23.\n\nMcDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000).\n\nHe is assisted by Ryan Miller, Jalen Courtney-Williams and Derek Kellogg.\n\nWith A Win...\n\n- Creighton would improve to 9-1 or better after 10 games for the fourth time in 14 seasons under Greg McDermott.\n\n- Creighton would improve to 6-3 in the state of Nevada under Greg McDermott.\n\n- Greg McDermott would beat his 113th different school as Creighton head coach.\n\n- Creighton would even the all-time series with UNLV at 2-2.\n\nUNLV & Las Vegas Connections\n\n- Creighton assistant coach Ryan Miller was an assistant and associate head coach at UNLV from 2014-16.\n\n- Creighton freshmen Shane Thomas and Sterling Knox are both from Las Vegas and attended Durango High School as well as Red Rock Academy. Both men intend to redshirt this season at CU.\n\n- Another Bluejay freshman who intends to redshirt, Brock Vice, is the son of UNLV Football's Offensive Line Coach Vance Vice.\n\n- Isaac Traudt's sister, Tia Traudt, has verbally committed to play volleyball at UNLV beginning in the fall of 2025.\n\nPiling On The Points\n\nCreighton scored 109 points in last Saturday's victory over Central Michigan, tied for its 12th-most in program history for a single game. It was also the most by any BIG EAST team this season.\n\nMost Points, Creighton History, Single-Game\n\nScore Opponent Date\n\n124-94 at Miami (Fla.) 02/10/1964\n\n120-76 Nevada 12/21/1962\n\n116-62 USC Upstate 12/20/2017\n\n115-80 Indiana State 01/19/1985\n\n115-82 Memphis 02/02/1966\n\n113-58 Longwood 12/09/2016\n\n112-94 vs. North Carolina State 11/20/2016\n\n111-68 North Dakota 12/05/2017\n\n111-110 Bradley (2OT) 03/01/2008\n\n110-73 Houston Christian 12/17/2007\n\n110-60 Coe 12/20/2018\n\n109-81 Wisconsin-Milwaukee 12/16/1967\n\n109-72 Alcorn State 11/12/2017\n\n109-64 Central Michigan 12/09/2023\n\nCentury Mark\n\nCreighton's 109 point effort last Saturday was the 25th time under Greg McDermott that Creighton has scored 100 or more points.\n\nThat ranks second-most among all Power 5/BIG EAST teams nationally in that span, trailing only North Carolina (35).\n\nNo other BIG EAST team has cracked the century mark more than 12 times since 2010-11.\n\nGreg McDermott's teams at Northern Iowa (153 games) and Iowa State (127 games) never scored more than 100 points in any game.\n\nRoad Dubs\n\nCreighton has started 2-0 on the road this season, doing so in impressive fashion each time out.\n\nOn Nov. 30 Creighton beat Oklahoma State 79-65, its second-biggest non-conference home loss since 1978.\n\nFour days later on Dec. 3, Creighton won 89-60 at Nebraska, handing the Cornhuskers their largest non-conference home loss since 1938.\n\nIt's the first time that Creighton has won its first two true road games since 2016-17, when the Jays won their first five road contests.\n\nIt's also just the 12th time in the last 50 seasons that CU has won each of its first two true road games. Ten of the 11 most recent teams to do so made the NCAA Tournament, and each won 20 or more games.\n\nStarted 2-0 Or Better On The Road, Last 50 Years\n\nRoad W's to Start Season Final W-L (Postseason)\n\n2 1976-77 21-7 (NCAA)\n\n2 1980-81 21-9 (NCAA)\n\n2 1998-99 22-9 (NCAA)\n\n3 1999-00 23-10 (NCAA)\n\n2 2002-03 29-5 (NCAA)\n\n4 2003-04 20-9 (NIT)\n\n2 2004-05 23-11 (NCAA)\n\n2 2011-12 29-6 (NCAA)\n\n4 2012-13 28-8 (NCAA)\n\n4 2013-14 27-8 (NCAA)\n\n5 2016-17 25-10 (NCAA)\n\n2 so far 2023-24 TBD\n\nSeeing Three's\n\nCreighton has made 14 or more three-pointers in five different games this year, tied with BYU for the national lead. It's already tied for the second-most games of 14 three-pointers in any year under Greg McDermott, trailing only the 2018-19 squad that did it eight times in 35 games.\n\nCreighton owns four different games this season in which it has made 10 or more three-pointers than its opponent, which also leads the country.\n\nIn the last two games alone, Creighton has made 29 three-pointers while its opponents have made just four total. That's a 75-point differential, which is notable since CU won those two games by a combined 74 points.\n\nThe Bluejays have had three different games this season in which they've made 10 or more triples before halftime, including each of the past two contests.\n\nIn the past two games alone, Creighton is 28-for-56 from three-point land before halftime, an even 50 percent.\n\nCreighton has made three or more three-pointers in every half this season.\n\nForty Time\n\nIn its eight wins, Creighton has scored 387 points before halftime (48.4 per game), and put up 40 or more points in the first half each contest.\n\nIn the lone loss, CU managed just 19 points before half and only 48 for the game.\n\nCreighton has won 14 games in a row when scoring more than 40 first half points.\n\nDon't Forget The Two's\n\nWhile attention tends to focus on Creighton's proficiency from three-point range, the Bluejays are also pretty efficient from inside the arc.\n\nThrough games of Saturday, CU ranked fourth in the country in two-point percentage (.627) in 2023-24 and third-best nationally (.547) among Division I schools to have played 100 or more games since Greg McDermott's arrival in 2010-11.\n\nCreighton shot 26-for-32 (.813) from two-point range on Saturday vs. Central Michigan, just the third time in Greg McDermott's 14 seasons at CU its converted on better than 80 percent of its two-point shots. The only better game was when it shot 22-for-26 (.846) in a March 2, 2013 win over Wichita State in CU's final regular-season game as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\n3 & D\n\nCreighton leads the nation in both three-point field goals per game (12.6) and fewest fouls per game (9.2).\n\nPer Basketball-Reference.com, Saturday's romp over Central Michigan saw the Jays became the nation's only team since at least 2010-11 to score 102+ points and commit 5 fouls or less in the same game against a Division I opponent.\n\nHoop Dreams\n\nCreighton shot 65.1 percent from the field on Saturday vs. Central Michigan.\n\nIn Greg McDermott's 459 games at Creighton, the Bluejays had only surpassed that figure three times previously, and not since 2013.\n\nBest FG%, Single-Game, Under Greg McDermott\n\nFG% (FG-FGA) Opponent Date\n\n.775 (31-40) at Southern Illinois 02/14/12\n\n.704 (38-54) Campbell 11/25/11\n\n.702 (33-47) Wichita State 03/02/13\n\n.651 (41-63) Central Michigan 12/09/23\n\n.648 (35-54) Longwood 11/20/12\n\nPowerful Performance\n\nOne of the few question marks heading into the season was which player would step up at the power forward position\n\nLast Saturday against Central Michigan, the platoon of Mason Miller, Isaac Traudt and Jasen Green each played a starring role.\n\nThe trio combined for 39 points and nine rebounds in 45 minutes of action. They shot 14-for-16 from the field, including 9-for-11 from three-point range. Both Miller and Traudt finished off a four-point play.\n\nFor the season Miller leads the BIG EAST with 58.3 percent marksmanship from three-point land while Traudt is second at 51.6 percent.\n\nNo Time To Waste\n\nIsaac Traudt scored 18 points in just over 12 minutes of action on Saturday vs. Central Michigan. The redshirt freshman made 5-of-6 three-point shots, as well as a dunk, en route to a new career-high scoring total.\n\nTraudt was CU's first player with 18 points or more in 13 minutes or less since Martin Krampelj had 18 points in 11 minutes on Dec. 20, 2018 against Division III opponent Coe.\n\nMr. Perfect\n\nCreighton center Ryan Kalkbrenner went 7-for-7 from the field vs. Central Michigan and has now made his last nine field goal attempts.\n\nIt was the third time in his career that Kalkbrenner has shot 100 percent or better from the field with at least seven attempts. In the past 14 seasons, only Nick Ward (Michigan State) and Tacko Fall (UCF) have done it more times (4 each).\n\nStarting Strong After Nine\n\nCreighton owns its fourth start of 8-1 or better through nine games under Greg McDermott.\n\nEach of those first three teams won their 10th game of the campaign.\n\nW-L After 9 Year Final W-L (Postseason)\n\n8-1 2011-12 29-6 (NCAA, 1-1)\n\n8-1 2012-13 28-8 (NCAA. 1-1)\n\n9-0 2016-17 25-10 (NCAA, 0-1)\n\n8-1 2023-24 ? ? ?\n\nMilestone Watch\n\nTrey Alexander has made 99 career three-pointers and is one away from 100.\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner owns 1,303 career points to rank tied for 21st in CU history with Elton Tuttle (1,303). With 11 or more points, he can pass current grad assistant Mitch Ballock (1,304), as well as Ryan Sears (1,309) and Kenny Lawson Jr. (1,313) to move into 18th place on CU's all-time scoring list.\n\nFrancisco Farabello owns 468 career points (including the 319 he scored at TCU), as he closes in on 500.\n\nJays Don't Foul...Do You Follow?\n\nCreighton leads the nation with just 9.2 fouls per game...let's take a minute to appreciate just how few that is.\n\nCreighton has committed three fouls or less in 7-of-18 halves this year.\n\nCreighton has not had more than eight fouls in any half this season, which means its opponents haven't sniffed the double-bonus yet.\n\nCreighton has allowed just one made free throw in a 1-and-1 situation all year. Iowa had a 1-and-1 with four seconds left but missed the front end. Oklahoma State got there with 41 seconds left and made the first shot but missed the second.\n\nHere's a look at how many fouls Creighton has been called for this season by half:\n\nCreighton Fouls By Half\n\nOpponent First Half Second Half\n\nFlorida A&M 4 5\n\nNorth Dakota State 1 3\n\nIowa 6 8\n\nTexas Southern 1 6\n\nLoyola (Chicago) 3 7\n\nColorado State 2 5\n\nOklahoma State 6 7\n\nNebraska 7 7\n\nCentral Michigan 3 2\n\nRelease, Rotation, Splash, Repeat\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in 994 straight games. The streak is the nation's 10th-longest active streak, but trails the NCAA-record streak of 1,200 by Wednesday's foe, UNLV.\n\nCreighton's last game without a three-pointer came at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993, when the Jays were 0-for-5. Creighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nBelow is a list of the nation's longest active three-point streaks.\n\nLongest Active 3-Point Streaks (12/11)\n\nRk.

He later went into private practice where he specialized in interstate commerce transportation, and labor law.\n\nIn 1960, Mr. Jones became publisher of the Memphis Daily News, a family-owned business and legal newspaper that has published since 1886. Mr. Jones retired from the practice of law in 1992.\n\nA lifelong resident of Memphis, he was a past president of the Tennessee Press Association, the American Court and Commercial Newspapers, Inc., and also a past member of the Memphis Literacy Council. Mr. Jones was a board member of the Benjamin C. Hooks Library, the Rock n' Soul Museum located in the FedEx Forum, the Tennessee Shakespeare Company and a founder of the Memphis Economic Club.\n\nThe basketball/entertainment complex at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville opened in 2005, and bears the name the John Paul Jones Arena.\n\nA Good Start\n\nHere's a look at how Creighton has done statistically after 10 games in recent seasons, which CU will reach after Wednesday's contest.\n\nOf note, Creighton has started 5-5 or better after 10 games in 28 of the past 29 seasons (including 2023-24).\n\nCreighton Stats Through 10 Games, Since 1994-95\n\nYear W-L PPG FG% 3FG 10+ PPG guys\n\n'23-24 so far 8-1 86.8 .513 113 3\n\n2022-23 6-4 78.7 .467 90 5\n\n2021-22 8-2 73.4 .491 62 4\n\n2020-21 8-2 81.3 .482 101 5\n\n2019-20 8-2 78.5 .478 98 3\n\n2018-19 7-3 83.8 .510 117 3\n\n2017-18 8-2 90.2 .516 102 3\n\n2016-17 10-0 91.6 .544 99 4\n\n2015-16 7-3 85.5 .506 93 5\n\n2014-15 8-2 73.8 .438 85 2\n\n2013-14 8-2 83.7 .491 113 2\n\n2012-13 9-1 80.2 .519 90 2\n\n2011-12 9-1 86.0 .516 90 2\n\n2010-11 6-4 69.0 .426 74 3\n\n2009-10 4-6 71.3 .450 78 2\n\n2008-09 8-2 75.6 .439 89 3\n\n2007-08 9-1 80.8 .478 84 2\n\n2006-07 6-4 66.0 .408 59 3\n\n2005-06 7-3 69.3 .405 70 3\n\n2004-05 8-2 69.2 .434 80 2\n\n2003-04 10-0 72.1 .463 61 2\n\n2002-03 10-0 84.9 .526 97 1\n\n2001-02 6-4 75.9 .439 63 3\n\n2000-01 8-2 76.0 .445 83 3\n\n1999-00 9-1 74.7 .458 84 2\n\n1998-99 8-2 78.4 .454 79 2\n\n1997-98 7-3 77.3 .467 73 1\n\n1996-97 5-5 65.7 .409 57 2\n\n1995-96 5-5 66.7 .390 56 3\n\n1994-95 4-6 65.1 .404 66 3\n\nBest of the Bench\n\nCreighton's reserves scored 47 points last Saturday vs. Central Michigan, making 18-of-24 shots from the field.\n\nThe 47 points were CU's most off the bench against a Division I foe since scoring 59 points vs. USC Upstate on Dec. 20, 2017.\n\nCreighton's reserve corps is currently averaging 21.67 points per contest, its best since the 2017-18 club compiled 24.42 points per game.\n\nMaking History\n\nDecember 3rd was the first time in Creighton history that the men's and women's basketball teams combined to score over 200 points on the same day. Creighton's men dominated Nebraska 89-60, while its women throttled Northern Iowa 115-62.\n\nThis year also the first time that the men's and women's basketball team each won against Nebraska in Lincoln in the same season.\n\nCreighton is one of eight schools in the AP Top 25 in both men's and women's basketball this week, joining Baylor, Gonzaga, Marquette, Miami (Fla.), North Carolina, Texas and UConn.\n\nAnd as long as we're talking history, did you know that Creighton had never played in a game (win or loss) that ended 89-60, then did it on both Nov. 11 vs. North Dakota State and again on Dec. 3 at Nebraska?\n\nScheierman's Week Earns Honors\n\nBaylor Scheierman was named the BIG EAST Player of the Week and Oscar Robertson U.S. Basketball Writers Association National Player of the Week on Dec. 4th after helping the Bluejays to a pair of double-digit road wins over Power 5 teams.\n\nScheierman averaged 22.5 points and 9.0 rebounds during the week, sinking nine three-pointers.\n\nScheierman had 21 points, eight rebounds and two steals in Thursday's BIG EAST – Big 12 Battle victory at Oklahoma State. The 79-65 loss was Oklahoma State's second-largest non-conference home loss in 45 years.\n\nThe Aurora, Neb,. product concluded his week by scoring 20 of his game-high 24 points in the first half of Creighton's 89-60 win over Nebraska, matching its largest margin of victory ever over its in-state rival. Scheierman made six three-pointers in the first half to remain (at the time) the nation's only player with three or more three-pointers in every team game this season.\n\nScheierman contributed 10 rebounds for his 40th career double-double, which also moved him over 1,000 career rebounds. The loss was Nebraska's largest in a non-conference home game since 1938.\n\nBig Half Baylor\n\nBaylor Scheierman has had at least 20 points before halftime in two of CU's last five games.\n\nHe had 21 points in the first 20 minutes against Loyola Chicago on Nov. 22, then poured in 20 points in the first half on Dec. 3 at Nebraska. Scheierman is the first Bluejay with multiple games of 20+ points at halftime in the same season since Marcus Foster did it three times in 2017-18 (22 vs. UT Arlington, 21 vs. Butler, 20 vs. Georgetown).\n\nFor the year, Scheierman leads Creighton with 11.9 points per game before halftime. No Creighton player has averaged more than 10 points per first half since Doug McDermott averaged 14.0 points per first half in 2013-14, a season that saw McDermott lead the nation in scoring.\n\nOn The Triple\n\nBaylor Scheierman drained six three-pointers before halftime on Dec. 3 at Nebraska.\n\nNo Creighton player had done that since Trey Alexander had six triples in the first half vs. Georgetown on March 1, 2023.\n\nIn case you're wondering, the Creighton record for three-pointers in a half is eight, done in a pair of memorable victories.\n\nEthan Wragge made eight three-pointers in a 96-68 win at No. 4 Villanova in 2014, while Terrell Taylor made eight after a scoreless first half in a double-overtime win vs. No. 15 Florida in 2002, though some of those trifectas came during the overtime sessions.\n\nScheierman The Scorer?\n\nBaylor Scheierman ranks second in the BIG EAST Conference in scoring at 18.6 points per game.\n\nThe Aurora, Neb., product is one of five BIG EAST players to have scored in double-figures every game this season, joining Marquette's Kam Jones, Providence's Devin Carter, St. John's Joel Soriano and Xavier's Desmond Claude.\n\nScheierman is just the fourth Creighton player in the last 25 seasons to score in double-figures each of the first nine games of a year, joining Doug McDermott (all 35 games in 2011-12), Marcus Foster (first 15 in 2017-18) and Ty-Shon Alexander (first 10 in 2018-19).\n\nThe fifth-year senior is aiming to become the first Creighton player to lead the BIG EAST in scoring since Doug McDermott in 2013-14. McDermott led the nation with 26.7 points per game en route to National Player of the Year accolades.\n\nKeep in mind that Scheierman has proven he can do way more than score. Two years ago at South Dakota State, Scheierman led the Summit League in the rare combination of both rebounds and assists.\n\nAin't Life Grand?\n\nBaylor Scheierman owns 1,753 points, 1,007 rebounds, 478 assists and has made 276 career three-pointers in 136 total games when you combine his Creighton and South Dakota State stats.\n\nCreighton's only other players to reach 1,000 career rebounds (only at Creighton) have been Paul Silas (1,751), Bob Harstad (1,126), Doug McDermott (1,088) and Benoit Benjamin (1,005).\n\nIf you're curious, how many games it took to get to 1,000 rebounds for each man, we've got you covered:\n\nGames to 1,000 Rebounds\n\nName GP Opponent, Date\n\nPaul Silas 47 at Utah State, 2/23/63\n\nBenoit Benjamin 89 at Bradley, 3/5/85\n\nBob Harstad 115 Siena, 2/3/91\n\nDoug McDermott 132 DePaul, 2/7/14\n\nBaylor Scheierman* 135 at Nebraska, 12/3/23\n\n*includes games at South Dakota State\n\n1,000+ Rebounds, 274+ 3FG Nationally, Since 1992-93\n\n**Stats earned at Division I schools only**\n\nName, School(s) REB 3FG\n\nDoug McDermott, Creighton 1,088 274\n\nBaylor Scheierman, SDSU/Creighton 1,007 276\n\nCan't Stop Scheierman\n\nBaylor Scheierman made a three-point basket in all 37 games he played last season and each game this season, stretching his streak dating to last year to 56 in a row if you include his final 10 games at South Dakota State in 2021-22.\n\nScheierman's streak of 46 straight as a Bluejay is the longest streak in Creighton history, 13 more than Ty-Shon Alexander's 33.\n\nScheierman was also the only player in the nation who had made three or more three-pointers in every game his team has played this season until the streak was snapped on Dec. 9 vs. Central Michigan.\n\nAlso listed is the nation's longest active streaks of games with a three-pointer, per the FOX Sports research team.\n\nConsecutive Games With A 3-Pointer, Creighton History\n\nStreak Name Dates of Streak\n\n46 Baylor Scheierman Nov. 7, 2022 - Present\n\n33 Ty-Shon Alexander Feb. 27, 2018-March 6, 2019\n\n31 Booker Woodfox Nov. 25, 2008-March 23, 2009\n\n28 Kyle Korver Feb. 4, 2001-Feb. 6, 2002\n\n27 Kyle Korver Feb. 13, 2002-Jan. 20, 2003\n\nConsecutive Games With A 3-Pointer\n\nNation's Longest Active Streaks (12/12)\n\nStreak Name, School Next Game\n\n74 Kamdyn Curfman, Marshall 12/13\n\n56 Baylor Scheierman, Creighton / S.

McDermott was a three-time All-American (2012, 2013, 2014) and consensus National Player of the Year (2014) during an incredible four-year career spanning 2010-14.\n\nMcDermott finished his career with an NCAA-record 135 double-figure scoring games and wrapped up his time on The Hilltop with 3,150 points, which was fifth in NCAA history. He was named winner of the Oscar Robertson, John R. Wooden and Naismith trophies as the National Player of the Year in 2013-14, when he led the country in scoring and helped Creighton to a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe son of current Bluejay head coach Greg McDermott, Doug McDermott was a three-time Conference Player of the Year and remains the sport's only three-time consensus First Team All-American since 1985.\n\nMcDermott received his Marketing degree from Creighton in 2014 and is currently in his 10th year in the NBA, as a member of the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nMcDermott's number will hang in the rafters alongside five other Bluejay greats (#25 Kyle Korver, #30 Bob Harstad, #33 Bob Portman, #35 Paul Silas, #45 Bob Gibson).\n\nRoad Openers\n\nCreighton is 7-7 under Greg McDermott in its first true road game of the season.\n\nThe road opener has been the barometer for Creighton's postseason plans in the previous 13 years. Creighton has made the NCAA Tournament all six times it has won the road opener, and missed the NCAA Tournament four of the other six years where a postseason was contested.\n\nThat's encouraging since CU defeated Oklahoma State 79-65 in its road opener this winter.\n\nCU would have made the 2020 NCAA Tournament that was canceled even though it lost its road opener that year.\n\nCreighton in Road Openers, Last 14 Years\n\nYear Opponent Score CU in NCAA's?\n\n2010-11 Northwestern L 52-65 No (CBI)\n\n2011-12 UAB W 70-60 Yes\n\n2012-13 Nebraska W 64-42 Yes\n\n2013-14 Saint Joseph's W 83-79 Yes\n\n2014-15 Tulsa L 64-77 No\n\n2015-16 #14 Indiana L 65-86 No (NIT)\n\n2016-17 Nebraska W 77-62 Yes\n\n2017-18 #20 Northwestern W 92-88 Yes\n\n2018-19 Nebraska L 75-94 No (NIT)\n\n2019-20 Michigan L 69-79 No (Postseason CCD)\n\n2020-21 #5 Kansas L 72-73 Yes\n\n2021-22 Nebraska W 77-69 Yes\n\n2022-23 #2 Texas L 67-72 Yes\n\n2023-24 Oklahoma State W 79-65 TBD\n\nBahamas Bounce\n\nCreighton is coming off a trip to the Bahamas in August, which it hopes will prepare the team for early victories as past trips have done.\n\nThis year's team is off to a 5-1 start after going to The Bahamas.\n\nA 2019 trip to Australia helped the Bluejays open the year 12-2.\n\nA 2015 trip to Italy helped the Bluejays start the season 5-1.\n\nA 2011 trip to the Bahamas helped get the Bluejays ready for a 7-0 start.\n\nA 2007 trip to Canada paid dividends as Creighton started 5-0.\n\nIn 2003, the Bluejays also went to Canada and started the subsequent season 12-0.\n\nKalkbrenner Enters Top 25 Of Scoring Chart\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner owns 1,303 career points, as he became the 45th men's player in Creighton history to surpass 1,000 on Feb. 25, 2023 at Villanova. He was the first Bluejay to score 1,000 since Marcus Zegarowski did it on Jan. 20, 2021 vs. Providence.\n\nHe currently ranks tied for 21st in program history, and could move as high as 18th with another double-figure effort on Wednesday.

McDermott did it the first six games of his senior season in 2013-14 and went on to be named National Player of the Year that season.\n\nAlexander is the first Bluejay to score 20 points or more in four consecutive games at any time of year since Marcus Foster did it in seven consecutive contests from Jan. 16-Feb. 10, 2018.\n\nA Head Start\n\nCreighton got a jump start on the season with nine practices in July before heading to the Bahamas to play in three games during the first week of August.\n\nCreighton won all three games by 14 points or more, averaged 98.3 points, and outrebounded foes by 21.3 caroms per contest.\n\nTrey Alexander led CU by averaging 20.0 points before missing the final contest, but Ryan Kalkbrenner (11.0 ppg.), Baylor Scheierman (10.0 ppg.) and Fredrick King (10.0 ppg.) also scored at a double-digit clip.\n\nSteven Ashworth led CU with 15 assists, King and Brock Vice had a team-high 18 rebounds and Kalkbrenner topped the team with 10 swats.\n\nWho's Back?\n\nWith Creighton returning seven of the 13 men who appeared in a game last season, it's no surprise that a similar ratio of the production from 2022-23 is also gone. Below is a breakdown of what is back:\n\nStat Returners Departures\n\nBlocks 126 (82.9%) 26 (17.1%)\n\nRebounds 860 (67.9%) 411 (32.1%)\n\n3FG Made 207 (64.9%) 112 (35.1%)\n\nPoints 1833 (64.8%) 995 (35.2%)\n\nSteals 119 (64.3%) 66 (35.7%)\n\nMinutes 4693 (63.0%) 2757 (37.0%)\n\nStarts 111 (60.0%) 74 (40.0%)\n\nCharges Taken 16 (59.3%) 11 (40.7%)\n\nAssists 308 (53.0%) 273 (47.0%)\n\nPreseason Top 10\n\nThe Creighton men's basketball team was ranked eighth in the Associated Press Preseason Top 25 poll, its highest preseason AP ranking ever. That's one spot better than the previous best, done last year, when the Bluejays started the season ranked ninth. CU is currently No. 8 in the AP poll.\n\nThe announcement marks just the sixth time in program history the writers have voted CU to the top-25 in the preseason, joining 2006-07 (No. 19), 2012-13 (No. 16) and 2016-17 (No. 22), 2020-21 (No. 11) and 2022-23 (No. 9). All five of those teams would end up in the NCAA Tournament, with the last two making the Sweet 16 and last year's club reaching the Elite Eight.\n\nThis week is the 27th in program history that Creighton has been in the top-10 at any point, with all but one of those occasions happening under head coach Greg McDermott. Creighton's best ranking in program history is seventh, done five times (Jan. 16, 2017, March 10, 2020, March 18, 2020, Jan. 7, 2021 and Nov. 28, 2022).\n\nCreighton has now been ranked 128 times in program history, with 100 of those under the direction of McDermott. Creighton is 160-64 all-time as a ranked team, including a 126-52 mark under McDermott. Creighton has now been ranked at least one week in 10 of McDermott's 14 seasons on The Hilltop after doing it just five different seasons in program history before his 2010 arrival.\n\nCreighton is one of four schools to be ranked in the preseason top-10 each of the past two seasons, joining Kansas, Duke and Houston.\n\nAlong with No. 5 Marquette, No. 6 Connecticut and No. 8 Creighton, this year marked the first time since 2011-12 that the BIG EAST had three Preseason Top-10 teams.\n\nCreighton was also eighth in the preseason USA Today Coaches poll, its best preseason mark ever. CU is also No. 8 in the Dec. 11th Coaches poll.\n\nPreseason BIG EAST Poll\n\nThe Creighton men's basketball team has been picked to finish second in the BIG EAST Conference in the annual survey of league coaches, which was unveiled as part of BIG EAST Media Day.\n\nIt's the second time in Creighton's 11 years in the BIG EAST Conference that the Bluejays have been picked second, as the 2020-21 squad was also picked second (and eventually finished second). The Bluejays also had three players receive recognition on one of the Preseason All-BIG EAST teams, tied with preseason favorite Marquette for the most in the league.\n\nThe Bluejays collected four first-place votes and earned 92 points in the poll, trailing only Marquette's seven first-place votes and 96 overall points. Defending national champion Connecticut was tabbed third with 79 points, just ahead of Villanova's 76 for fourth place. Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino's first St. John's team garnered 59 points to be chosen fifth, just ahead of Xavier (57) and Providence (51). The bottom four teams in the poll are Georgetown (34), Seton Hall (30), Butler (16) and DePaul (15).\n\nCreighton finished 24-13 overall and 14-6 in BIG EAST play last season and are the only league team to return three of its scorers that averaged at least a dozen points per game. The Bluejays won three NCAA Tournament games to advance to its first Elite Eight since 1941.\n\nIn 2023-24, Creighton will be led by senior center Ryan Kalkbrenner, who is a Preseason First Team All-BIG EAST selection. Kalkbrenner becomes the first player in program history to earn Preseason First Team All-BIG EAST honors multiple times, and along with Preseason Player of the Year Tyler Kolek from Marquette was one of two men to be named on every ballot.\n\nJoining Kalkbrenner with the Preseason First Team All-BIG EAST acclaim was junior guard Trey Alexander. Alexander was an Honorable Mention All-BIG EAST choice at the end of last season, as was teammate Baylor Scheierman. A senior guard from Aurora, Neb., Scheierman earned Preseason Second Team All-BIG EAST plaudits in 2023-24.\n\nThis year marks the second time that Creighton has had more than two players land on the Preseason All-BIG EAST Team, and comes 12 months after Creighton had four men listed prior to the 2022-23 campaign. Creighton last had two men named Preseason First Team All-Conference in its Missouri Valley Conference days in 2006-07 (Anthony Tolliver, Nate Funk).\n\nKolek was named 2023-24 BIG EAST Preseason Player of the Year by a vote of the league's head coaches, which comes as little surprise after the point guard was named 2023 BIG EAST Player of the Year and BIG EAST Tournament MVP after leading the Golden Eagles to both the regular-season and tournament titles. Connecticut guard Stephon Castle was chosen BIG EAST Preseason Freshman of the Year. The coaches, who were not permitted to select their own players, also chose an All-BIG EAST First Team, All-BIG EAST Second Team and All-BIG EAST Honorable Mention.\n\nCreighton has matched or exceeded its preseason projection in all but one season since joining the BIG EAST in 2013-14, the best showing in the league in that time. The Bluejays are seeking an eighth straight finish in the top four of the league standings. CU's team two years ago was predicted to finish eighth in the BIG EAST, then ended up in fourth. Four years ago, a team picked seventh in the BIG EAST's preseason poll went 13-5 in league play to share its first league title with Villanova and Seton Hall. That Bluejay team ended the year ranked seventh in the entire nation.\n\nCreighton's BIG EAST Preseason Poll History\n\nYear Preseason Actual Preseason All-BIG EAST\n\n2013-14 3rd 2nd Doug McDermott (1st)\n\n2014-15 9th T-9th -\n\n2015-16 9th 6th -\n\n2016-17 3rd T-3rd Maurice Watson Jr. (1st); Marcus Foster (HM)\n\n2017-18 5th T-3rd Marcus Foster (1st); Khyri Thomas (HM)\n\n2018-19 9th T-3rd Martin Krampelj (HM)\n\n2019-20 7th T-1st Ty-Shon Alexander (1st)\n\n2020-21 2nd 2nd Marcus Zegarowski (1st); Mitch Ballock (2nd)\n\n2021-22 8th 4th -\n\n2022-23 1st 3rd Ryan Kalkbrenner (1st); Arthur Kaluma (2nd)\n\nRyan Nembhard (2nd); Baylor Scheierman (HM)\n\n2023-24 2nd ??

That makes CU one of seven teams in the country to have a win in each of the last three NCAA Tournaments, joining Arkansas, Baylor, Gonzaga, Houston, Kansas and UCLA.\n\nThe only other time that Creighton has won an NCAA Tournament game in consecutive seasons came in 2012, 2013 and 2014, also under Greg McDermott.\n\nCreighton is one of six schools with 20 or more wins in each of the last eight seasons, joining Belmont, Gonzaga, Houston, Kansas and Oregon.\n\nCreighton is one of seven teams to post 22 or more wins in each of the last four seasons, joining Baylor, Gonzaga, Houston, Liberty, San Diego State and Southern California.\n\nCreighton is one of just eight teams to have reached at least two of the last three Sweet 16s. Gonzaga, Houston and UCLA have done it each of the last three seasons, while Alabama, Creighton, Michigan and Villanova have done it twice each.\n\n23 of 25 Seasons With 20 Wins\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 23 of the last 25 seasons, a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust two schools have had 20 or more wins each of the last 25 years: Gonzaga and Kansas. Duke has done it 24 times, Creighton and Kentucky 23 times.\n\nMost 20-Win Seasons, Last 25 Seasons\n\nTeam 20-Win Seasons 2022-23 W-L\n\nGonzaga 25 31-6\n\nKansas 25 28-8\n\nDuke 24 27-9\n\nCreighton 23 24-13\n\nKentucky 23 22-12\n\nDynamic Duo\n\nCreighton is also one of eight schools to have men's and women's basketball programs to both own 22 wins or more each of the previous two seasons, a list that includes Creighton, Gonzaga, Liberty, Princeton, Tennessee, Texas, Toledo and UConn.\n\nThis season, Creighton was one of eight teams with a preseason top-25 squad on both the men's and women's side, joining Baylor, Connecticut, Illinois, North Carolina, Southern California, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nThe only five schools to be ranked in the preseason men's and women's basketball Top 25 of the AP Poll both this season and last season are Baylor, Creighton, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nCreighton is one of 11 schools to make the NCAA Tournament in both men's and women's basketball each of the past two seasons, a list that consists of Arizona, Baylor, Creighton, Gonzaga, Indiana, Iowa, Iowa State, Miami (Fla.), Tennessee, Texas and UConn.\n\nThe only schools with at-large bids in each of the previous two years in both men's and women's basketball are Baylor, Creighton, Indiana and Miami (Fla.).\n\nA Dozen Will Do\n\nCreighton finished 14-6 in the BIG EAST last season and is the only school in the BIG EAST with 12 or more league wins each of the previous four seasons.\n\nAmong the other BIG EAST or \"Power 5\" Conference schools, Kansas, UCLA and Virginia have also done it the previous four years.\n\nCreighton has now owned a .500 mark or better in league play 27 times in the last 28 seasons.\n\nThe only BIG EAST teams to finish .500 or better in league play each of the previous six seasons are Creighton, Villanova and Seton Hall.\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 27 victories since the start of the 2010-11 season after trailing by double-figures at some point.\n\nThirteen of those 27 comebacks have come away from home.\n\nIf you're curious, CU's largest comeback win since 2000 came on Jan. 28, 2006, when the Jays trailed 25-6 early before rallying to beat Wichita State on a buzzer-beater by Anthony Tolliver.\n\nCU's Double-Digit Comebacks Under McDermott\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n16 at Seton Hall 01/27/21\n\n16 SIU Edwardsville 11/27/21\n\n15 Arkansas-Pine Bluff 11/09/21\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n14 vs. San Diego State 03/17/22\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n13 #22 Xavier 12/23/20\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n12 at DePaul 01/17/16\n\n12 East Tennessee State 11/11/18\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n11 vs. Ole Miss 11/21/16\n\n11 vs. Connecticut 03/12/21\n\n11 DePaul 01/22/22\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n10 at Nebraska 12/07/14\n\n10 South Dakota 12/09/14\n\n10 St. John's 01/03/18\n\n10 at DePaul 02/07/18\n\n10 Bemidji State 02/13/18\n\nMcDermott Ranks Second On CU Wins List\n\nGreg McDermott has 308 victories at Creighton, good for second place on CU's all-time wins list.\n\nMcDermott's .671 winning percentage is Creighton's best since Arthur A.

CU's 100th win came on Nov. 17, 2010, a 63-58 win over Louisiana.\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 26,895-22,439 in games at CHI Health Center Omaha, an average margin of 12.99 points per game. Creighton has not trailed 90 different times.\n\nIncredibly, Creighton hasn't trailed in its home opener in 10 of the past 23 seasons (2000-01, 2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2009-10, 2011-12, 2014-15, 2016-17 and 2019-20).\n\nCreighton is also 32-36 all-time in the 68 games at the arena in which it's fallen behind by double-figures at any point, 8-11 when down by 10+ points at halftime in the facility, and 40-29 when trailing at halftime at CHI Health Center Omaha.\n\nCreighton is 186-42 (.816) at CHI Health Center Omaha under Greg McDermott and hasn't trailed in 65 of those games. In that same span, CU owns a 100-9 home record vs. non-conference teams.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 302-60 (.834) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nHome Run\n\nUnder Greg McDermott Creighton is averaging 80.71 points per home game (18,401 points in 228 home games), a figure that climbs to 84.37 points in non-conference home games (9,196 points in 109 home games).\n\nCreighton is 140-6 all-time at CHI Health Center Omaha when scoring 80 or points.\n\nElite Eight\n\nGreg McDermott guided his team to the NCAA Tournament for the eighth time last season. That put him in the company of some of the greatest coaches in CU Athletics history, and most among basketball coaches.\n\nMcDermott is one of three head coaches in Creighton history to lead eight or more NCAA Tournament teams.\n\nName Sport NCAA's @CU\n\nKirsten Bernthal Booth Volleyball 13\n\nBob Warming Men's Soccer 11\n\nGreg McDermott Men's Basketball 8\n\nDana Altman Men's Basketball 7\n\nBrent Vigness Softball 7\n\nFiring On All Cylinders\n\nCreighton finished last season ranked 12th overall by KenPom.com.
