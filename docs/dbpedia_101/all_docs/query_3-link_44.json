        "text": "Mountain West men's basketball is having its best season since the current membership was formed in 2013 and perhaps the best season in the conference's 25-year history. Here are some observations about the league heading into Saturday's regular-season finales.\n\n***\n\nThe race for MW player of the year seemed like a slam dunk a week or two ago, and it probably still is. I'm voting for San Diego State's Jaedon Ledee, and I think he'll win. The Aztecs center is first in the MW in scoring, third in rebounding, third in field-goal percentage, first in win shares and first in Player Efficiency Rating. That almost always wins you the player of the year award, and I'll probably have Ledee on my AP All-American second team, too. But I do wonder if SDSU loses to Boise State on Friday and Utah State sweeps its games this week, whether the coaches might makeGreat Osobor the player of the year. Under that scenario, SDSU would finish fifth in the league, and rarely do the coaches pick a player of the year from a fifth-place team, although it happened last year with San Jose State's Omari Moore. Meanwhile, Osobor ranks second in the MW in scoring, first in rebounds, fourth in blocks, second in field-goal percentage, fourth in PER and fifth in win shares. He'd be deserving.\n\n***\n\nIf Utah State wins a share of the MW title, which will happen as long as the Aggies beat San Jose State on Wednesday night, Danny Sprinkle should not only win national coach of the year (he's locked up MW coach of the year), but he also will have completed the best coaching job in the conference's 25-year history.Sprinkle inherited a team returning zero points from 2022-23 and was picked to finish ninth in the league in the preseason poll. Nobody would have quibbled with a rebuilding season given the situation inherited, so to win arguably the best MW ever in those circumstances is a historic effort. You can only hope Utah State holds ontoSprinkle for more than one year, Thankfully, his buyout is steep— $2.775 million this offseason.\n\n***\n\nUtah State'sOsobor, who followed Sprinkle from Montana State, is easily the MW newcomer of the year. I'm more curious about who will win be MW freshman of the year. JT Toppin has long been the favorite and recently earned MW freshman of the week honors for the ninth time, tying the record set by Boise State’s Tyson Degenhart in 2021-22. Toppin (12.4 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 1.9 bpg, 62.3 FG%) is a hugely deserving candidate, and probably the MW's best long-term NBA prospect. But it'd be hard to not vote for UNLV's Dedan Thomas Jr. (13.2 ppg, 5.3 apg), who is more valuable to his team than Toppin because he is the Rebels' only high-level playmaker. UNLV would be nowhere near title contention without Thomas.\n\n***\n\nSpeaking of Thomas, what he's done in conference against elite (and aged) point guards has been nothing short of amazing. The MW boasts a ton of fifth-year senior point guards in Isaiah Stevens (Colorado State), Kenan Blackshear (Nevada), Jaelen House (New Mexico),Darius Brown III (Utah State), Sam Griffin (Wyoming) and Isaiah Hill (Fresno State), not to mention fourth-year senior Lamont Butler (San Diego State). Outside of Stevens, you could argueThomas has been as good as any point guard in the league. Yes, I'd take Blackshear over Thomas for his defensive value, but we're talking about an 18-year-old who was a class of 2024 recruit who is hanging with all these 23-year-olds. Impressive.\n\n***\n\nThere's no bigger villain in the MW than Nevada's Jarod Lucas, and I think he loves that label. Lucas plays to the crowd every road game, and while his stats are better at home (18.1 ppg, 43.2 FG%, 44.3 3PT%) than on the road (15.7 ppg, 38 FG%, 36.1 3PT%), his halfcourt shot at the buzzer to beat Colorado State, sprint around the court and three bows before the Moby Arena faithful cemented him as the ultimate MW road villain. New Mexico's House is a close second. But Lucas has helped Nevada win on the road at Colorado State, Utah State, Boise State, UNLV and Washington. That's a nicequintet of road victories. Nevada's eight overall road wins are the MW's most and tied for 26th in the nation.\n\n***\n\nUNLV'sRob Whaley Jr. is pound-for-pound the toughest player in the MW, quite the title in one of the nation's most physical conferences. The 6-foot-7, 260-pound center has taken off in MW play by averaging 10 points and 3.7 rebounds per game while shooting 65.3 percent from the field. TheFarmington, Utah spent two years at College of Southern Nevada before transferring to UNLV. In high school, he was a 6-5, 320-pounder, which led to Division I teams questioning hiswork ethic, calling himself as a prep player. He's rounded into shape and had the MW's dunk of the year.\n\n***\n\nNevada coach Steve Alford would like you to knowTré Coleman should be the MW defensive player of the year. He says it after almost every game. It's not often a wing defender gets MW defensive player of the year honors, but Coleman is deserving despite his 41 steals and 20 blocks being relatively low on counting stats for a defensive player of the year candidate. Coleman is 10th in the MW in defensive win shares with teammates Blackshear (seventh) and Nick Davidson (eight) also in the top 10. The last wing defender to win MW defensive player of the year was Nevada's Cody Martin in 2017-18. Nine of the last 12 honorees in this category were centers. Voters love blocks.\n\n***\n\nUtah State's Spectrum is louder than New Mexico's Pit. But the Lobos have the best fans in the MW. Sorry, San Diego State.\n\n***\n\nGun to my head, I think Utah State is the seventh-best team in the MW. Yet, the Aggies might win the regular-season title in solo fashion. Utah State is 9-1 in games decided by five points or fewer, tied for the best record in the nation with a minimum of nine such games.Central Michigan also is 9-1 in \"close games.\" TheChippewas are 8-12 in all other games. The Aggies are 15-4 in all other games. Winning close games at a 90 percent clip is not sustainable.\n\n***\n\nAs I've noted previously, six of the MW's top-10 scorers are only eligible this season because of the COVID-19 2020-21 season not counting against eligibility. will be tamed once that extra COVID year is no longer available after the 2024-25 season. But the MW has put itself in a prime position to stay at this level as the nation's elite Western basketball conference with the Pac-12 crumbling. The timing is perfect.\n\n***\n\nThe MW remains in line for six NCAA Tournament bids, which would be a conference record. If that happens, it will have earned those bids. There have been allegations of gaming the NET from envious power conferences, but the MW performed better in non-league this season than last year when the MW got four teams in the Big Dance. Given San Diego State and Nevada are the only MW teams to win an NCAA Tournament game since the conference went to its current membership in 2013-14, I'm curious how well the league will show on the big stage. Outside of SDSU, the MW is2-15 in the NCAA Tournament — both victories by 2018 Nevada in miraculous fashion — since forming its current 11 members in 2013-14. That feels like Gonzaga and the West Coast Conference.\n\n***\n\nI believe the MW will have more success in this year's MW Tournament and have multiple teams win a game in the same Big Dance for the first time since 2013 when San Diego State and Colorado State advanced. But I do have one major concern with the MW. It can't shoot threes. As a league, the MW is shooting 33.9 percent from three in league play. That'd rank 186th in the country. Only two of the MW's seven potential NCAA Tournament teams are shooting better than 33.3 percent from three in league, those teams being Nevada (39.3 percent) and Boise State (34.9 percent). New Mexico (33.2 percent), Utah State (32.8 percent), UNLV (32.5 percent), Colorado State (31.3 percent) and San Diego State (30.8 percent) rank in the bottom five spots in league play in 3-point shooting. Not only is that odd, but that could prove costly in the national tournament.\n\n***\n\nThe MW team most in need of an NCAA Tournament win is Boise State, which is 0-9 in the Big Dance, including 0-4 under Leon Rice, who has done a terrific job with the Broncos but still has that monkey on his back. Perhaps it's unfair to set the standard of a program as winning an NCAA Tournament game, and during a conversation I had with Rice last week, he downplayed the importance of NCAA Tournament wins in determining the strength of a program or conference. But he's overdue for an NCAA Tournament win given all the success he's had with the Broncos. And with Boise State potentially losing two starters in Max Rice (out of eligibility) and Chibuzo Agbo (one year of eligibility but walked on senior night), now seems like a good time to win a tournament game.\n\n***\n\nBeware the First Four. Since those games were introduced in2011, the MW is 0-4 in First Four games, including losses by Boise State in 2013 and 2015; Wyoming in2022; and Nevada in 2023.\n\n***\n\nThere's never been an NCAA Tournament game that pitted one MW team against another, but I'm hoping that happens this season. Since the selection committee wisely protects teams in the same conference from playing each other in the first or second round, such a matchup could only happen at the Sweet 16 level or later. Only once has the MW had two Sweet 16 teams in the same season, that being 2011 whenKawhi Leonard-led San Diego State and Jimmer Fredette-led BYU lost to UConn and Florida, respectively. But a man can dream. I want a MW vs. MW matchup.\n\n***\n\nBefore we get to the NCAA Tournament, there's next week's MW Tournament. And this is the first time seven teams can legitimately win the tournament and you wouldn't be surprised. , the MW's top-seven teams all have between a 9.6 percent (Colorado State) and 19.7 percent (San Diego State) chance of winning the MW Tournament. That's incredible balance and should produce one of the best and most unpredictable tournaments in conference history.\n\n***\n\nAnd before we get to the MW Tournament, there is Nevada's regular-season finale against UNLV on Saturday that could potentially have regular-season title implications. This game will mark the 99th between the Wolf Pack and Rebels in basketball, and in my estimation, it is the most important game played between the schools in a series that dates to1962. This is peak Silver State rivalry.\n\nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports. Contact him at crmurray@sbgtv.com or follow him on Twitter @ByChrisMurray."
