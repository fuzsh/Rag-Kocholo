BYU storylines

In 2013-14, BYU basketball will be looking to extend its program record streaks of eight-consecutive trips to the postseason and eight-straight 20-win seasons. Last year, the Cougars finished 24-12 and advanced to the semifinals of the NIT.

BYU returns preseason All-American junior guard Tyler Haws, who led the WCC in scoring and was seventh in the nation at 21.7 points per game last season. Haws is only the second Cougar to reach 1,000 career points as a sophomore.

Sophmore guard Kyle Collinsworth returns from a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Russia. He started 27 games on BYU’s 2010-11 team that advanced to the Sweet Sixteen.

Dave Rose

BYU head coach Dave Rose has led BYU to its most successful eight-year run since taking over in 2005. His career record of 209-66 ranks him second in BYU history in total victories and first in winning percentage (.760). Rose has been named conference coach of the year three times, district coach of the year twice, led the Cougars to four conference titles, six NCAA Tournament appearances, two NIT appearances, six 25-win seasons and eight 20-win seasons. In 2010, he led BYU to its first NCAA Tournament win in 17 years and the Cougars have also won at least one postseason game in the three seasons since, including a spot in the Sweet 16 in 2011 and a trip to the NIT semifinals in 2013.

Return of Kyle Collinsworth

The 2013-14 season marks the return of sophomore guard Kyle Collinsworth, who spent the last two years serving a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Russia.

Collinsworth started 27 games on a BYU team that won a team record 32 games and advanced to the Sweet 16 of the 2011 NCAA Tournament.
