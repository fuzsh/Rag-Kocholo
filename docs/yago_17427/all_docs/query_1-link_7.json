        "text": "Soon, when you visit Virginia State Parks, you'll see the photography of a local woman highlighting her shots of D.C. landmarks.\n\nAngela Pan is shooting familiar sites in new, exciting ways and is getting a lot of attention for it.\n\nA photo called “Vietnam Memorial Cloudy Sunrise,” is Pan’s best seller. She says she’ll never forget the spectacular sunrise that day.\n\n“It was really different from anything I'd ever seen before. So when I went home and processed it I knew it was something special,” Pan said.\n\nPan, 28, born and raised in Fairfax, Virginia, says veterans’ reaction to that photo has been overwhelming.\n\n“They feel so inspired by my pictures that they're actually tearing up I just can't believe the response we get from my pictures, it's amazing,” she said.\n\nAs a child, Pan spent a lot of time with her grandmother who is a painter—but, she says she was bitten by the photography bug when she was a teenager.\n\n“When I was in high school I took my first photography class and it was over and I knew right then it was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life,” Pan said.\n\nShe majored in marketing at VCU and went to work in a D.C. Government job instead. Pan quickly grew anxious to get back to her passion for landscape and travel photography.\n\nThen, two years ago, she took the plunge and started AB Pan Photography, using high dynamic range photography. She takes multiple exposures of the same scene and combines them, increasing colors and contrasts.\n\nNow, Flyer TV in D.C. airports plays this video of Pan telling tourists how to take great photos in the nation's capital.\n\nPan is getting married in October. And as you can imagine, finding the right wedding photographer was a very big deal.\n\nFor more, ."
