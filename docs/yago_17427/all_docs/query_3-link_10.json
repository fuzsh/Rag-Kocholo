        "text": "Veteran TVB actor Chan Hung-lit died in hospital yesterday after falling ill during shooting of the popular comedy series Off Pedder. He was 66.\n\nChan complained of chest pains when he was in the make-up room at the station's headquarters, TVB City, in Tseung Kwan O at 4.30pm, Virginia Lok Yee-ling, controller of TVB's production resources division, said.\n\nWhile a producer called for an ambulance, station security staff loosened his clothes and tried to resuscitate him. Chan was losing consciousness when the ambulance came, Lok said. He was taken to Tseung Kwan O Hospital where he died at 7.11pm. His younger sister went to the hospital after being told.\n\nLok said Chan's daughter and his second wife, who are in Taiwan, had been notified.\n\nChan had been filming during the day and had fallen ill while he was preparing to change for another scene.\n\nTsang Sing-ming, TVB's external affairs deputy controller, said he did not know much about the state of Chan's health, but the actor had been performing enthusiastically during a live celebration programme for TVB's 42th birthday at the station's headquarters on Thursday.\n\nTsang said Off Pedder episodes featuring Chan would run for two more weeks, but at some point the script would have to explain Chan's character leaving the show. Chan, a main supporting actor in the series, played wealthy and powerful company president Yim Hei.\n\nChan was born to a wealthy family in Shanghai on June 7, 1943. He joined the Shaw Brothers in 1962 and earned fame by impressive performances as villains during the 1960s and 1970s. It was rare in those days for actors playing villains to gain popularity.\n\nHe also directed a number of films during the 1970s with his production company. He joined TVB in 1995, left in 1996, and rejoined the station in 2003. He had been in more than 20 drama series productions from TVB, including the popular The Gem of Life and Off Pedder in recent years."
