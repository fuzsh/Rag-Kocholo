        "text": "Dr. Angela Nelson is an Associate Professor in the Department of Popular Culture and Director of the School of Cultural and Critical Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences. A significant portion of my academic career has been in administrative service on my campus as undergraduate advisor, department chair, program director, and school director. My interdisciplinary research and teaching specifically centers 20th and 21st century Black popular culture in the United States of America. My research questions include: (1) How do the social or cultural concerns, identities, experiences, and perspectives of African Americans influence their artistic or ministerial expressions and their relationship with the culture industry brokers who administer their expressions? (2) How do the social or cultural concerns, identities, experiences, and perspectives of culture industry brokers influence their relationship with African Americans and their administration of African Americans’ artistic or ministerial expressions? (3) How do the audiences, processes, administration systems, apparatuses, and structures surrounding television, music, and religion elevate or oppress African American artistic or ministerial expressions? (4) How do African Americans respond to the audiences, processes, administration systems, apparatuses, and structures surrounding television, music, and religion that elevate or oppress their artistic or ministerial expressions? My teaching and scholarship endeavors to bring marginalized voices of African American women, in particular, to the center of cultural conversations, bridging academic and public spaces."
