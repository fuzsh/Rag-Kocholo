        "text": "Fly With Me <飛女正傳>\n\nGenre: Science Fiction, Modern\n\nProducer: Jonathon Chik\n\nNumber of Episodes: 25\n\nCast:\n\nAda Choi as Leung Hau Chi (Yvonne)/Janetbin\n\nMoses Chan as Kan Ming Hin (Wallace)\n\nKenny Wong as Yeung Ho Yin (Edmond)\n\nRaymond Cho as Tsui Wing Fai (Frankie)\n\nQueenie Chu as Kwok Hui Lam (Cathy)\n\nChan Hung Lit as Yung Bak Keui\n\nCatherine Chau as Tsang Cheuk Nga (Selina)\n\nPlot (Warning! Spoilers ahead! This might not be a complete summary since I did not watch every single episode.)\n\nThe series starts in 1991 where Yvonne was younger and she was being held hostage by an admirer. She tried to convince the guy to give up. She promised that if he were imprisoned, she would go and visit him. The man was arrested and the series then fast-forwarded to 2003; Yvonne was at her cousin’s wedding during the SARS period. In 2008, she got dumped by her boyfriend who went for someone younger. Finally, in the present situation, Yvonne was a single woman in her 30s with failing career, no figure and possibly breast cancer. Life got worse when Cathy (Queenie Chu), the girl who she thought had no brains became her boss. Her admirer was released from prison and found her. He chased her up to the top of the building and kissed her. She fell down the building and was taken to hospital. In hospital the doctors pronounced her death. However, the lights in the hospital switched off and she turned into a different woman, much prettier with a better figure and a purple butterfly tattoo on her chest. She realised that every time she kissed a man on the lips, she would transform into an attractive woman with super powers but her powers only worked for a period of time. She named her self Janetbin when she was transformed.\n\nJanetbin became a well known hero and saved many people in different disasters. Kenny Wong (Edmond) was a police man and he was very curious about Janetbin. He was very fascinated by her but ended up being saved by her in many situations. Since saved by Janetbin, he developed mental problems and became mentally weaker. The only way he could recover was by protecting Janetbin instead.\n\nYvonne met a cosmetic doctor named Wallace (Moses Chan) who always seemed very unhappy. Yvonne often thought about him and admired him. However, Frankie (Raymond Cho) always liked Yvonne and even joined her company. His sister did not want him to join because the Director of the company was Mr. Yung, who was actually his father. Mrs. Yung knew that Frankie was Mr. Yung’s son. Mr. Yung and Frankie were kidnapped by Mr. Yung’s eldest son. Frankie protected Mr. Yung and Mr. Yung told the kidnappers that Frankie was his illegitimate son. Janetbin saved them but Mr. Yung went into a coma. However he pretended to be paralysed because he suspected that his sons were trying to harm him.\n\nMeanwhile, Edmond was very curious about Janetbin and tried to investigate her real identity. At first, he thought Janetbin and Yvonne were the same person but he later believed that they were just friends. He pretended to date Yvonne but his girlfriend Selena (Catherine Chau) always checked on him.\n\nMrs. Yung did not like Frankie and blamed him for stealing information from the company. He became imprisoned and his sister died. Life was really bad.\n\nJanetbin and Yvonne became two different people and they fell for different men. Janetbin liked Wallace while Yvonne liked Edmond. Edmond was only with Yvonne to try and find out about Janetbin. One day, a man went to Wallace’s home and tried to shoot him but shot Janetbin instead. Janetbin realised that she had a weakness and lost all her powers when she pressed the tattoo on her chest.\n\nMeanwhile, Frankie was released from prison and became a different person. He plotted to get into the Yung’s business and managed to get rid of Mr. Yung’s sons. He became the Chairman of the company and moved in with Mr. Yung.\n\nEdmond really wanted to know what Janetbin’s weakness was and tried to find out. He pretended that he was in an accident and consequently Yvonne revealed that Janetbin’s weakness was her tattoo. Edmond invited Janetbin for dinner and tried to reveal Janetbin’s weakness but was kissed by Janetbin immediately in front of Selina. Edmond thought that Yvonne had lied to him. Edmond’s girlfriend was not happy but he proposed to her and they got married.\n\nJanetbin lost interest in Wallace and fell for Frankie instead who was richer. Yvonne discovered that Edmond had been two timing her and was very upset. However, she felt sorry for Wallace who was in love with Janetbin.\n\nYvonne lost control of Janetbin and decided that she will no longer transform into Janetbin. She told Edmond everything about Janetbin. However, she was accidently kissed and transformed into Janetbin. Janetbin invited Edmond to her house and attacked him. Janetbin refused to transform back to Yvonne and moved in with Frankie. She had to kiss him regularly to maintain as Janetbin.\n\nA group of Janetbin haters were formed to try and give bad publicity of Janetbin. They intended to reveal the flaws of Janetbin but Wallace helped publicise Janetbin and used her image to promote perfection. However, Janetbin realised that Frankie was just using her and wanted to take over the Yungs’ business. He accidently killed Mr. Yung and Yvonne was blamed instead.\n\nYvonne was taken into court. She wanted to admit that she killed Mr. Yung but Janetbin came to court and blamed Yvonne. Mr. Yung had faked his death so that his son Frankie would succeed to the whole business.\n\nJanetbin decided to leave for good since Yvonne no longer needed her. Frankie returned back to his old self and continued to run his father’s business. Wallace realised that the person he loved the most was Yvonne and they got married. However, when he went to Yvonne’s house, he got stabbed by Yvonne’s admirer. Thus he had developed superpowers and would transform every time he was kissed. He and Yvonne got married and the series ended with them flying together.\n\nCAST AND COMMENTS\n\nAda Choi as Yvonne and Janetbin\n\nYvonne was a woman in her middle age and had a career but no boyfriend. She had no figure and was considered to be ugly. On the other hand, Janetbin was attractive and was well liked. I think the moral of this series was that appearance was not really an issue. Yvonne at the start thought that she needed Janetbin’s look and figure to get male attention. However, at the end of the day, Yvonne found true love through herself. I think Ada portrayed these characters really well and her comedy skills were evident in this series. The characters were very different from her previous roles.\n\nMoses Chan as Wallace\n\nHis character was not that exciting and was overshadowed by the other characters. Also whats with the gray hair? It does not really make sense.\n\nKenny Wong as Edmond\n\nQuite liked him here. He played a policeman who wanted to find out about Janetbin and did not want to be saved by her. I think he did a good job here.\n\nRaymond Cho as Frankie\n\nHis character was much more exciting to watch and liked his storyline more. I think he had liked Yvonne right from the beginning. I found that there was a slight imitation of Stephen Chow in his acting.\n\nBest Female Character: Ada Choi as Janetbin (Well there wasn’t really much of a choice).\n\nBest male character: Raymond Cho as Frankie\n\nBest Chemistry: Yvonne and Wallace\n\nMost improved: Queenie Chu\n\nI did not really watch the whole series and some parts were not really that good to watch. I think the main idea of the series was that you are loved for what you are and you do not have to be attractive to find love. The series was not that good all the way through and was rather confusing. This was the first time TVB produced a science fiction series and it really was not that successful. I do not think that viewers like this type of series.\n\nSeries Rating : Give it a shot if you have time"
