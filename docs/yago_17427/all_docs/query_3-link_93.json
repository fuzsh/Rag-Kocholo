        "text": "Quan Hongchan has achieved the seemingly impossible: to become the standout diving star in the People’s Republic of China.\n\nThe Asian powerhouse dominates the sport, having won all-bar-one of the gold medals on offer at the past two Olympic Games.\n\nBut somehow, Quan still manages to stand out above her compatriots.\n\nAt Tokyo 2020 in 2021, she secured three perfect 10s at the age of 14 to finish over 40 points ahead of silver medallist and compatriot Chen Yuxi in the women’s 10m platform and become her nation’s second-youngest diver ever to win an Olympic title.\n\nThe Guangdong native was so young, in fact, that she was only able to compete in Japan due to the year-long postponement caused by the pandemic.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at the story behind Quan’s meteoric rise, and some of the lesser known facts about the diving prodigy.\n\nHow to qualify for diving at Paris 2024\n\nDoha 2024: Quan Hongchan wins women's 10m platform world title\n\n1 - Motivated to pay for hospital bills\n\nQuan was born as third of five children in the rural village of Maihe, which has fewer than 2000 inhabitants.\n\nHer father was an orange farmer, and her mother worked in a factory until a car accident left her in poor health.\n\nAged seven, Quan was playing hopscotch at school with her friends, and her jumping ability was quickly spotted by a local coach from the Zhanjiang City Sports School, Chen Huaming.\n\n“He said that I was tiny and swift, but able to jump higher and longer than the others. At that time, I was 1.20m tall and could jump as long as 1.76m,” Quan told Xinhanet.com.\n\n“Coach Chen, who was doing his annual work to scout young talents all over the city and in rural areas, went to my home and spoke to my parents. He taught me diving at school in Zhanjiang. I had never tried any other sports before but I enjoyed playing in the water. It was a good start for me that I jumped from the platform into the water ahead of other kids without hesitation.\n\n“I was not good at studying but I found confidence in diving.”\n\nQuan’s motivation in sport was to get to compete at the Olympic Games and support her mother through paying for her hospital bills.\n\n3 - Spicy snacks, arcade games, and supermarkets\n\nAside from her brilliance in sport, Quan has won the hearts of the Chinese public with her bubbly personality.\n\nAfter looking perfectly serious during Tokyo 2020, the teenager burst into giggles after winning the gold medal, telling reporters that she would be celebrating by eating a spicy Chinese snack called Latiao.\n\n“I want to eat my favourite snacks as much as possible, and I want to go to the amusement park and play the doll-grasp machine and grab many dolls,” she said.\n\n“I had a wish to own a small grocery store in my hometown, but now my dream is upgraded to a supermarket.”\n\n4 - A home comfort with a funny face\n\nTokyo 2020 was the first time Quan ever competed outside of China.\n\nBeing so young, it was important that she had some home comforts to settle any nerves and perform at her best.\n\nThat’s why she always brings a stuffed toy with a big grin on its face, which was a gift from her older brother.\n\n\"It kind of looks like me. We both have toothy smiles,\" she told China Daily."
