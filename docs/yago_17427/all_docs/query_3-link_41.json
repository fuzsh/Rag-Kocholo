        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nLower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are highly prevalent and they can have profound effects on the well-being and life quality in both men and women [1,2]. Because of the high prevalence worldwide, there has been an increasing interest in identifying risk factors for LUTS. To investigate associations with LUTS, epidemiology of LUTS (EpiLUTS) is an international landmark study that surveyed nearly seven thousand people in the United States (US) [3]; however, only 2.3% of the EpiLUTS study population were Asian Americans even though they comprise over 5.0% of the total population in the US [4]. In other large US-based LUTS studies, there was no information on Asian Americans [[5], [6], [7]].\n\nAsian American population grew significantly from 0.5 million in 1965 to over 20 million in 2015 when they became the largest new immigrants to the US [8]. Within this highly heterogeneous and diverse population, those of Chinese descent make up the majority of this population with an estimate number over 5 million in the US [9]. From the existing literature, there is a wide range of LUTS rates among men and women living in China. One study reported that Chinese men and women shared similar LUTS prevalence rates at nearly 60% [10], while others reported that men's prevalence rates ranged from 40% to 70% and women were much higher up to 90% [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. It is unclear, however, whether these prevalence rates can be applied to the Chinese American population living in the US. Chinese Americans live in a different environmental and sociocultural milieus from their counterparts in China, which could theoretically impact the manifestation of LUTS in this fast-growing portion of the US. To address the existing knowledge gap, this study aimed to study the prevalence of, risk factors for, and gender-specific differences in LUTS among Chinese Americans of 60 years and older.\n\n3. Results\n\nOf the total survey participants queried in the study, 1328 (42%) were men and 1829 (58%) were women. The mean±standard deviation age was 72.8±8.3 years of all the participants, and 30.4% reported at least one LUTS. Of the individual LUTS, 27.9% of men reported frequency, 16.5% with urgency, 2.9% with burning and/or pain, 1.5% with hematuria, and 2.9% with incontinence ( ). In women, 22.4% reported frequency, 12.6% with urgency, 2.2% with burning/pain, 1.7% with hematuria, and 5.6% with incontinence. There was a higher proportion of men reported any LUTS when compared to women (32.9% vs. 28.6%, p=0.01); however, women reported higher rates for incontinence than men (5.6% vs. 2.9%, p=0.003) and there were no differences in burning and/or pain and hematuria between the two genders. When comparing participants with OAB-dry, more men met the OAB-dry symptom criteria than women (28.8% vs. 21.2%, p<0.001).\n\nTable 1\n\nDemographic and LUTSMen\n\n(n=1328)Women\n\n(n=1829)p-ValueAge, mean±SD, year72.8±7.972.9±8.60.69Education, mean±SD, year9.9±4.87.9±5.1<0.001Years in the US, mean±SD19.5±13.520.4±12.90.07Married, n (%)1178 (88.8)1058 (58.0)<0.001Income level (per year), n (%)<0.001 $0–$4999486 (37.0)554 (30.6) $5000–$9999631 (48.1)985 (54.5) $10 000 and above196 (14.9)269 (14.9)LUTS, n (%) Any LUTS437 (32.9)524 (28.6)0.01 Frequency370 (27.9)409 (22.4)0.004 Urgency219 (16.5)230 (12.6)0.002 Burning or pain38 (2.9)41 (2.2)0.21 Hematuria20 (1.5)31 (1.7)0.66 Incontinence38 (2.9)102 (5.6)0.003 OAB-dry382 (28.8)388 (21.2)<0.001\n\ndescribes the differences in characteristics and comorbidities between men without LUTS and men with LUTS.

Similar to the comparisons made among men, women without LUTS and with LUTS also demonstrated many statistically significant differences between the two groups. However, there were more characteristics that demonstrated no significant difference, including BMI (p=0.18), education level (p=0.42), smoking status (p=0.23), alcohol use (p=0.18), practice of Tai Chi (p=0.20), or any cancer (p=0.07). When comparing between the two genders, women with LUTS had a poorer general health perception than men with LUTS (p=0.01) and there was no difference in the quality of life responses between men and women ( ). Similar differences in the characteristics, comorbid conditions, and health perceptions were also noted when examining the OAB-dry subgroup in each gender; however, activities of daily living scores in both genders and men's marital status, depression, and any cancer histories were no longer significant ( , , ).\n\nTable 2\n\nCharacteristic and comorbidityLUTSOAB-dry symptomMen without LUTS (n=891)Men with LUTS (n=437)p-ValueMen without OAB-drya (n=946)Men with OAB-drya (n=382)p-ValueAge, mean±SD, year71.9±8.074.4±7.4<0.00172.2±8.174.1±7.4<0.001BMI, mean±SD, kg/m223.0±3.323.5±3.30.0123.0±3.423.5±3.10.02Education, mean±SD, year9.6±4.710.6±4.8<0.0019.7±4.810.5±4.80.004Married, n (%)801 (90.1)377 (86.3)0.04845 (89.5)333 (87.2)0.22Current smoker, n (%)260 (29.2)76 (17.4)<0.001268 (28.4)68 (17.8)<0.001Alcohol use, n (%)0.100.18 Never661 (74.3)327 (74.8)702 (74.3)286 (74.9) Monthly or less122 (13.7)76 (17.4)132 (14.0)66 (17.3) 2–4 times a month31 (3.5)9 (2.1)32 (3.4)8 (2.1) 2–3 times a week13 (1.5)5 (1.1)13 (1.4)5 (1.3) 4 times or more a week63 (7.1)20 (4.6)66 (7.0)17 (4.5)TCM herb userb, n (%)258 (29.0)163 (37.3)0.002276 (29.2)145 (38.0)0.002Tai Chi userc, n (%)71 (8.0)63 (14.4)<0.00178 (8.2)56 (14.7)0.001Cognitive mental statusd, n (%)0.400.31 Severely impaired6 (0.7)7 (1.6)8 (0.9)5 (1.3) Moderately impaired33 (3.8)16 (3.8)40 (4.3)9 (2.4) Mildly impaired99 (11.3)52 (12.2)104 (11.2)47 (12.5) Not impaired738 (84.2)351 (82.4)774 (83.6)315 (83.8)NAGI scoree, mean±SD1.9±3.13.1±4.0<0.0012.1±3.42.8±3.5<0.001ADL scoref, mean±SD0.2±1.10.6±3.0<0.0010.3±1.90.3±1.90.29Comorbidity, n (%) Anxietyg31 (3.5)38 (8.9)<0.00140 (4.3)29 (7.7)0.01 Depressionh126 (14.2)87 (20.2)0.01146 (15.5)67 (17.8)0.31 Heart disease109 (12.2)120 (27.5)<0.001127 (13.4)102 (26.7)<0.001 Stroke47 (5.3)49 (11.2)<0.00159 (6.2)37 (9.7)0.03 Any cancer32 (3.6)27 (6.2)0.0337 (3.9)22 (5.8)0.14 Diabetes171 (19.3)119 (27.2)0.001192 (20.4)98 (25.7)0.03 Hypertension420 (47.2)271 (62.2)<0.001449 (47.5)242 (63.5)<0.001 Osteoarthritis233 (26.2)163 (37.3)<0.001255 (27.0)141 (36.9)<0.001\n\nTable 3\n\nCharacteristic and comorbidityLUTSOAB-dry symptomWomen without LUTS (n=1305)Women with LUTS\n\n(n=524)p-ValueWomen without OAB-drya (n=1441)Women with OAB-drya (n=388)p-ValueAge mean±SD, year72.1±8.474.7±8.7<0.00172.6±8.773.9±8.20.01BMI, mean±SD, kg/m223.1±3.423.4±3.70.1823.1±3.523.4±3.70.25Education, mean±SD, year7.8±5.08.0±5.20.427.8±5.17.9±5.10.81Married, n (%)797 (61.3)261 (49.8)<0.001861 (59.5)197 (50.8)0.001Current smoker, n (%)12 (0.9)2 (0.4)0.2312 (0.8)2 (0.5)0.52Alcohol use, n (%)0.180.34 Never1214 (93.0)496 (94.7)1340 (93.0)370 (95.4) Monthly or less66 (5.1)20 (3.8)72 (5.0)14 (3.6) 2–4 times a month9 (0.7)6 (1.1)12 (0.8)3 (0.8) 2–3 times a week6 (0.5)2 (0.4)7 (0.5)1 (0.3) 4 times or more a week10 (0.8)0 (0)10 (0.7)0 (0)TCM herb userb, n (%)466 (35.7)263 (50.2)<0.001534 (37.1)195 (50.3)<0.001Tai Chi userc, n (%)137 (10.5)66 (12.6)0.20152 (10.5)51 (13.1)0.14Cognitive mental statusd, n (%)0.0030.06 Severely impaired17 (1.4)13 (2.6)27 (2.0)3 (0.8) Moderately impaired124 (9.9)65 (13.1)143 (10.4)46 (12.5) Mildly impaired201 (16.1)100 (20.2)225 (16.3)76 (20.6) Not impaired909 (72.7)317 (64.0)982 (71.3)244 (66.1)NAGI scoree, mean±SD3.3±4.05.3±4.8<0.0013.6±4.24.8±4.5<0.001ADL scoref, mean±SD0.3±1.70.8±3.2<0.0010.5±2.40.4±1.70.39Comorbidity, n (%) Anxietyg108 (8.4)88 (16.9)<0.001135 (9.5)61 (15.8)<0.001 Depressionh241 (18.6)185 (35.4)<0.001298 (20.8)128 (33.0)<0.001 Heart disease156 (12.0)93 (17.8)0.001183 (12.7)66 (17.0)0.03 Stroke45 (3.5)40 (7.6)<0.00156 (3.9)29 (7.5)0.002 Any cancer68 (5.2)39 (7.4)0.0783 (5.8)24 (6.2)0.75 Diabetes270 (20.7)143 (27.3)0.002309 (21.5)104 (26.9)0.02 Hypertension721 (55.3)327 (62.6)0.004804 (55.8)244 (63.2)0.01 Osteoarthritis552 (42.4)283 (54.0)<0.001636 (44.2)199 (51.3)0.01\n\nTable 4\n\nPerception of health and life qualityAny LUTSOAB-dry symptomMenWomenp-ValueMenWomenp-ValueGeneral health perceptiona, n (%)0.010.03 Very good16 (3.7)6 (1.1)14 (3.7)5 (1.3) Good101 (23.1)110 (21.0)89 (23.3)89 (22.9) Fair211 (48.3)243 (46.4)194 (50.8)181 (46.7) Poor109 (24.9)165 (31.5)85 (22.3)113 (29.1)Quality of lifeb, n (%)0.440.70 Very good33 (7.6)1 (0.2)29 (7.6)26 (6.7) Good155 (35.5)43 (9.3)136 (35.6)153 (39.4) Fair231 (52.9)192 (41.7)202 (52.9)193 (49.7) Poor18 (4.1)224 (48.7)15 (3.9)16 (4.1)\n\ndescribes the multivariable logistic regression analysis used to evaluate LUTS while controlling for gender, age, BMI, education, marital status, smoking status, NAGI score, TCM use status, the practice of Tai Chi, hypertension, heart disease, anxiety, and depression.

Again in , we found being married was protective only for women with LUTS (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59–0.96), but not for men. Depression was also strongly associated with LUTS in women (aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.28–2.26) while anxiety was associated with LUTS in men (aOR 2.74, 95% CI 1.54–4.87). Frequent TCM use was the only factor that was significantly associated with an increased odds of LUTS in both men and women (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02–1.73 and aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.30–2.02, respectively). Other gender-specific factors that were associated with an increased odds of LUTS in men but not women included hypertension (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.05–1.78), heart disease (aOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.39–2.61), and practice of Tai Chi (aOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.21–2.62). When analyzing the OAB-dry subgroup, most associations were similar to those found in LUTS; however, smoking was found to be protective (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52–0.99) only in men who reported OAB-dry symptoms.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis large population-based database study examined factors associated with LUTS in an underrepresented population. LUTS are common among older Chinese Americans with OAB-dry being the most predominant phenotype. Chinese American men had a higher prevalence of reporting any LUTS and OAB-dry than women; however, more women reported incontinence than men. Additionally, there were gender-specific characteristics associated with either increased or decreased odds of reporting any LUTS, but frequent TCM use was the only characteristic common to both genders with an increased odds of reporting LUTS.\n\nAs TCM remains commonly used among the Chinese Americans, the association of LUTS to TCM users is particularly interesting and relevant. While people of Chinese ancestry are not the only ones using TCM, it is still the most prevalent among Asian American communities when compared to other cultures [22]. Based on the theoretical framework of TCM, the body can become disharmonious when it is offended by external or internal forces [23]. Specifically, in the genitourinary system, the disharmonious forces may originate externally via exposure to coldness and/or internal repression of emotions (such as anger and anxiety) [24]. There is a paucity of data on the effect of TCM to the lower urinary tract [25]. In our study, we found an association between TCM use and LUTS; however, as we do not know the indication for the TCM use in our study population, we cannot discern whether patients were taking TCM to treat LUTS or if patients who were taking TCM for treatment of other conditions developed LUTS as a side-effect. More studies dedicated to exploring the relationship between TCM and LUTS are warranted to determine whether TCM use could be a modifiable risk factor to LUTS or whether TCM is a common remedy for the treatment of LUTS among Chinese Americans.\n\nThe relationship between depression and/or anxiety and LUTS as demonstrated in this study echoes the current literature [26]. It has been established that serotonin has effects over the central nervous system and also influences urinary tract functions [27]. Our finding reaffirms the need to address mental health when patients present with LUTS. However, it is unclear why depression but not anxiety was significantly associated with LUTS in women but not men and vice versa. Interestingly, being married was associated with decreased odds of LUTS and OAB-dry in Chinese American women. This finding may be supported by the past findings that marital functioning is consequential for health as it provides social support, thus improves physiological functioning, and subsequently maintains lower urinary tract health [28]. The connection between depression and/or anxiety and LUTS appears widely applicable, including among older Chinese Americans based on this study.\n\nFor male-specific risk factors, we confirmed the previously identified associations between LUTS and hypertension as well as heart disease. Sugaya et al. [29] had demonstrated that men with hypertension had more significant LUTS than those without hypertension. Given hypertension being a major public health burden and commonly associated with increased risks for heart disease, it is important to address cardiovascular health when Chinese American men report LUTS. On the other hand, our study also found men who reported practicing Tai Chi to have increased odds of reporting LUTS. However, this may be due to Tai Chi being considered as a complementary treatment in Asian communities to reduce sympathetic nervous system input and stress, which are related to LUTS [30,31]. Jung et al. [32] found that Tai Chi specifically improved LUTS in older men with benign prostate hyperplasia. Further studies are warranted to determine the possible therapeutic relationships between Tai Chi and LUTS. Lastly, although we noted an association between higher education levels with increased odds of reporting LUTS in men, we did not find an association between education level and OAB-dry symptoms in men.\n\nThere are limitations to this study. First, given the design of this study, we cannot determine temporal or causal relationships between LUTS and their associated factors. More research is needed to better understand these factors, including gender differences in health perception that could potentially influence the prevalence of LUTS in this population. Second, the data may be subject to recall bias since responses were based on participants’ retrospective memories. Third, the results might not be generalizable to other populations. The prevalence of LUTS in this Chinese American city-dwelling population was half the rate reported in other studies investigating LUTS in people of Asian descent [10]. This discrepancy might be due to differences in design across the studies, i.e. different tools used to measure LUTS; however, the difference also might reflect unique environmental and sociocultural factors experienced by the Chinese Americans in our cohort, which could in turn impact their bladder health. Fourth, due to the design of the original study, this secondary analysis relied on a genitourinary ROS question to identify LUTS rather than a validated questionnaire. Therefore, we do not have detailed information on LUTS subtypes, such as nocturia, postmicturition symptoms, and types of incontinence. Moreover, given the heterogeneity of LUTS captured by the ROS question, we performed a sub-analysis of OAB symptoms alone. Although genitourinary ROS does not provide the granular details of lower urinary tract symptomology, the ROS provides an accessible way to evaluate this large population speaking predominately in regional dialects and subsequently portrays preliminary understanding of LUTS among this particular population which could lead to future inclusive and culturally specific research.\n\nDespite the possible limitations, this study is strengthened by its large sample of a minority population. The questionnaires and their responses were rich in details with culturally sensitive data which have been largely understudied in the LUTS research. Finally, ROS here was a practical tool to broadly measure LUTS among this traditionally marginalized US population in medical research."
