        "text": "To work with a company as elite as Contiki is one thing, but when you see your work turn into an ad as you scroll the internet is a whole new high. When photography became a side hustle I had no idea where it was going to take me. The most important value I learnt is to believe in your work. It's the self confidence that will sell you. So aim high and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. Fun fact: I had to sit on a random dude's shoulders to get these shots. In return I took some professional photos of his and his girlfriend üò¨. Win-win right? #commercialphotography #contiki #selfconfidence #selfemployed #betterworkstories\n\nWell they say once you make it LinkedIn official there‚Äôs no going back right? Welcome to PANAPETITE Studios! üì∑ My commercial photography and videography business. I cover all creative aspects from product to spatial, fashion and food editorial. Self taught since 2016, photography was always a side hustle. So many big things (mostly great, some bad) have happened in my life since Covid and I can finally settle to focus on what I really want to do. So stayed tuned and in the meantime please browse through www.panapetitestudios.com because I‚Äôm so proud of the website I‚Äôve been perfecting! And as for what PANAPETITE means? That‚Äôs a story for another day. Thank you always for everyone‚Äôs support üôåüèº #newchapter #commercialphotography #westernaustraliaphotographer #productphotographer\n\n8 weeks ago I was made redundant, just before our 6 week honeymoon trip. Not the best news to receive before this girl was about to go on a global shopping spree, but it allowed me to leave with no work load (unlike my husband who willingly checked in every 3 days üòÇ). The 6 weeks away allowed me to create again (pics attached). I was constantly in awe and deeply inspired by the new culture, the people and all the different kinds of knowledge that I hadn‚Äôt been exposed to. The trip got me to appreciate things in life that make me happy. Happiness motivates me. It gives me that hunger to strive and bounce back even higher after a redundancy. 1 week ago I started applying for jobs. Within that time, I‚Äôve gotten 3 interviews and 1 offer. This isn‚Äôt to boast about my abilities but rather to show that changing the mindset will bring a much more positive affect. So if you‚Äôve been in the same shoes here are some tips that worked for me: 1. Don‚Äôt play the blame game. Move on because your previous employer already has. 2. It is just a job. And as cocky as that sounds, the options out there will surprise you. 3. It might just be time to finally do something you love. Tap into different skills you‚Äôve been burying. Let that be your comeback. 4. Use a different job applying method. For the first time I used recruitment agencies and wow are they game changers. Goodbye sending out 100 CVs. 5. Lean on your community. Good friends will help you in ways you don‚Äôt expect. P.S. am still open to opportunities ‚ò∫Ô∏è #redundancy #redundancysupport #community #culture #mindset"
