        "text": "Gerry married his high school sweetheart, Toni, in 1974. Together, they had two daughters. Let's get to know them!\n\nBy Jamie Lerner\n\nUpdated April 19 2024, 11:33 a.m. ET\n\nThe ABC dating reality series The Golden Bachelor made its official debut in September 2023, with 72-year-old Gerry Turner serving as the lead of the very first season of the series. Unlike most Bachelors and Bachelorettes, he already has two daughters and two granddaughters!\n\nWhile Gerry was skeptical about finding love, and rightfully so, Theresa Nist captured his heart, and the two tied the knot at the end of the show.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThree months into their marriage, however, Gerry filed for divorce on April 12, 2024, at the Pike Circuit Court in Indiana. Their split is believed to have been caused by neither being able to agree on where they wanted to live. Despite things not working out between Gerry and Theresa, he still has his daughters and granddaughters. So, let's get to know them a little better!\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n‘Golden Bachelor’ Gerry Turner has two daughters — Jennifer “Jenny” Young and Angela “Angie” Warner.\n\nGerry married his high school sweetheart, Toni, in 1974. Together, they had two daughters, the eldest of whom was born the same year as their wedding. Jenny Young, reportedly born in 1974, is now 50 years old and married to Jon Young.\n\nWe don’t know what Jenny and Jon do for a living, but they have proudly raised two daughters in Holt, Mich. Jenny’s younger sister, Angie Warner, was supposedly born in late 1981, making her 43 years old. According to her LinkedIn, she’s a Vice President of Sales at Assessments 24x7, where she has been working since October 2021.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAngie graduated from the University of Iowa with a Bachelor's degree in Communications and Marketing in 2004 and married her husband in 2019. According to Angie’s Facebook, she enjoys traveling, attending football games at her alma mater, and spending time with her family.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDespite living in different states, Angie and Jenny seem to be close. And they might be fans of the Bachelor franchise! According to Gerry, his daughters were the ones who encouraged him to apply for the show in the first place. And his granddaughters were just as excited.\n\nGerry Turner has two granddaughters, one of whom is old enough to be part of the ‘Bachelor’ franchise herself!\n\nCould we see a Bachelor legacy taking place? We definitely expected Gerry’s daughters and granddaughters to take part in his process of finding love, although it’s unclear if they had a bigger part in that than the typical Bachelor lead’s family. Perhaps the person who was most excited for Gerry’s starring moment is his youngest granddaughter, Charlee Young.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBoth of Gerry’s granddaughters were born to Jenny and Jon and grew up in Holt, Mich. Charlee is just 16 years old, so she’s still in high school, but her sister, Payton Young, is now 22 years old and just graduated from Adrian College. She signed onto Adrian College’s Acrobatics and Tumbling team in 2018, so we know she must be a talented athlete.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAccording to her athletic profile, Charlee is also a gymnast! There’s no telling what’s in Charlee or Payton’s futures, but we bet that if Payton wanted to find love on television, there’d be a place for her in the Bachelor franchise. (That is, if she hasn’t found love already.) According to their Instagrams, Charlee and Payton seem to be “best friends,” just like their mom and aunt.\n\nWhile we were somewhat disappointed that Gerry and Theresa's relationship didn't pan out, it's evident that Gerry isn't keen on maintaining long-distance ties with family.\n\nSeason 1 of The Golden Bachelor is available for streaming on ABC and various streaming platforms."
