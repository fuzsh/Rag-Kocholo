        "text": "Over the past few days, the internet has been paying tribute to martial arts star Cheng Pei Pei, who passed away at the age of 78 on July 17 in San Francisco.\n\nShe reportedly suffered from a degenerative brain disease similar to Parkinson’s disease since 2019.\n\nBest known for her role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the late actress also starred in Mediacorp dramas Heroes In Black (2001), Springs Of Life (2002) and Women Of Times (2006).\n\nA pioneer for women in action films, Pei Pei gained international attention after she starred inHong Kong wuxia film Come Drink With Me in 1966.\n\nIt was also on the set of this movie that she developed a relationship with the late actor Elliot Ngok Wah.\n\nAccording to reports, then Pei Pei was also being wooed by co-star Chan Hung Lit.\n\nPei Pei later revealed on 2009 TVB talk show Club Sparkle that she chose to date Ngok Wah when she found out that Hung Lit was also pursuing another woman.\n\nPei Pei and Ngok Wah dated for five years and were regarded as a golden couple in showbiz.\n\nIt was rumoured that they split after Pei Pei’s good friend, former entertainment journalist Yi Shu, came between them. Also known as Isabel Nee, she is the younger sister of Hong Kong novelist Ni Kuang.\n\nPei Pei and Yi Shu were very close and the latter would often join Pei Pei and Ngok Wah on their dates.\n\nIt is said that after Ngok Wah dropped Pei Pei off at home, Yi Shu would claim to have night blindness and ask him to send her home.\n\nWhen Pei Pei learned about this, she ended her relationship with Ngok Wah and married Taiwanese businessman Yuan Wen Tung in 1970, moving to the United States with him.\n\nNgok Wah then went public with his relationship with Yi Shu.\n\nYi Shu was jealous of Pei Pei's relationship with Ngok Wah.\n\nThe pair had a high-profile relationship, and Yi Shu once publicly expressed her love in an article titled Why Yi Shu Loves Ngok Wah.\n\nHowever, her jealousy led to extreme behaviour.\n\nWhen Pei Pei sent a letter to Ngok Wah from the US, Yi Shu became furious and publicly disclosed the letter in a newspaper.\n\nShe then cut up Ngok Wah’s clothes and even stabbed his bed at the spot where his heart would be. This eventually led to their breakup.\n\nThere were reports that Yi Shu knelt and begged for reconciliation, but Ngok Wah refused.\n\nHe later went on to marry actress Tien Ni, Tien Niu's sister, and they had a daughter. He passed away in Canada in 2018 at the age of 76.\n\nPei Pei and Wen Tung divorced in 1987. They had three daughters, Eugenia, 48, Jennifer, 47, Marsha, 46, and son Harry, 39.\n\nPei Pei with her kids, Harry, Eugenia, Jennifer and Marsha. Pei Pei and Ngok Wah in 1966's Come Drink With Me.
