        "text": "Career\n\nAngela Pan started out in Hong Kong and was involved in many movies and stage shows. But she did not truly become famous until she went to Taiwan. It was in Taiwan when she took up the role as lead actress in The Return of the Condor Heroes, The Empress of the Dynasty, The Princess of the Dynasty which created a sensation at the time. The shows were viewed by over 60% of the population out of all the shows shown at the same time.\n\nAngela Pan did a lot of shows with Taiwan's well-known television network China Television Company, Ltd., also known as CTV, leading her to be called the \"Lovely Young Mistress of CTV\" (At the time there were only 3 channels in Taiwan, Taiwan Television (TTV), China Television (CTV) and Chinese Television System (CTS)).\n\nEven though Angela Pan started out in the 1960s, she never revealed her true age. People have been unable to guess her age because she played a lot of young ladies' roles on the screen. Especially in \"The Empress of the Dynasty\" and \"Empress Da Yu Er\" she played all the roles of the girl from childhood to old age; due to her impressive acting job these performances are considered to be her most critically acclaimed role. Also because of her ability to play a teenage girl's role over the years, she was given a nickname of \"Baby Doll\" or \"Doll\". Angela Pan was also the first actress rumored to have had cosmetic work done, due to her ageless look.\n\nAngela Pan is well known in China also because of her shows of The Empress of the Dynasty, The Return of the Condor Heroes, Empress Da Yu Er and The Quarrels with Mother-in-Law among other roles."
