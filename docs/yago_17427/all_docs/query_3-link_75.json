He is then shocked when a zombie slams into the bus and breaks the windshield just as they enter the gate and is last seen getting out of the bus. The driver's fate, along with that of the archery coach, is unknown as they are never seen again. He is portrayed by Han Sang-chul.\n\nChoir Conductor[]\n\nHe is seen conducting a group of students in the choir. His fate is unknown as he is never seen after the choir practice. He appears as a cameo in Episode 7 in a filmed choir rehearsal. He is portrayed by Kim Kyung-hoo.\n\n\"Deaf\" Zombie[]\n\nWhen the group used the intercom system to lure the zombies to one side of the school, all but one zombie went to that side; he instead just bumped into the wall and stayed there. The group tried sneaking past him but Oh Joon-yeong accidentally dropped a thermos. Despite the zombie seemingly not hearing the music, he heard the thermos hitting the ground and began chasing the group. Su-hyeok tried to fight him off but he was able to tackle him.
