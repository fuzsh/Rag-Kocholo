        "text": "Come Drink with Me is a 1966 Hong Kong wuxia film directed by King Hu. Set during the Ming Dynasty, it stars Cheng Pei-pei and Yueh Hua as warriors with Chan Hung-lit as the villain, and features action choreography by Han Ying-chieh. It is widely considered one of the best Hong Kong films ever made.[1] The film was selected as the Hong Kong entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 39th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.[2]\n\nContents[]\n\n[hide] *1 Plot\n\n2 Cast\n\n3 Production notes\n\n4 Rumors of a remake\n\n5 Recent re-releases\n\n6 See also\n\n7 References\n\n8 External links\n\nPlot[edit][]\n\nA general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated.\n\nA local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret.\n\nThe monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff.\n\nFan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds.\n\nIn order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n\nCast[edit][]\n\nCheng Pei-pei as Golden Swallow\n\nYueh Hua as Fan Da-pei / Drunken Knight\n\nChan Hung-lit as Jade Faced Tiger\n\nLee Wan-chung as Smiling Tiger Tsu Kan\n\nYeung Chi-hing as Abbot Liao Kung\n\nShum Lo as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nHan Ying-chieh as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nFung Ngai as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nSimon Yuen as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nKu Feng as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nWong Yeuk-ping as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nKwan Ying-chi as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nChow Siu-loi as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nNam Wai-lit as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nTung Choi-bo as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nChiu Hung as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nChui Chung-hok as Jade Faced Tiger's henchman\n\nHao Li-jen as monk\n\nWong Chung as Golden Swallow's brother\n\nCheung Hei as innkeeper\n\nYam Ho as waiter\n\nChin Chun as waiter\n\nYee Kwan as waiter\n\nMars as one of the little kids\n\nAlan Chui as one of the little kids\n\nChing Siu-tung as boy monk who gets injured in the eye\n\nAngela Pan as woman escort soldier\n\nChiu Sam-yin as woman escort soldier\n\nNg Ho as prisoner\n\nLeung Lung as caravan guard\n\nHsu Hsia\n\nWong Shing\n\nProduction notes[edit][]\n\nJackie Chan is rumoured to have appeared as one of the child singers near the beginning of the film. Lead actress Cheng Pei-pei denied this in the audio commentary to the Hong Kong DVD release of the film. Still, the film is listed among Chan's acting credits on his official website and autobiography.[3]\n\nDirector King Hu told critic Tony Rayns (quoted in Bey Logan's book) that he had deliberately chosen a ballet dancer for the lead female role, \"... rather than fighting. I'm very interested in Peking opera and particularly its movement and action effects, although I think it's difficult to express them adequately on stage, where the physical limitations are too great.\" King Hu was said to recognise that some of the fights are stylised as opposed to realistic but claimed that combat in his movies was \"always keyed to the notion of dance.\" This movie was a great success upon its release in Hong Kong and made a star of Cheng Pei-pei[4] and others.[5]\n\nThe original film was followed by a sequel, Golden Swallow again with Cheng Pei-pei but with Jimmy Wang as the lead actor.\n\nRumors of a remake[edit][]\n\nProducers Bob and Harvey Weinstein announced in April 2007 that they would invest in movies with Asian themes. One of the movies they announced was a remake of Come Drink with Me, directed by Quentin Tarantino.[6] However, little has been heard of the project since then, and in June 2008, Tarantino announced his next project would be Inglourious Basterds, leaving the status of the remake undisclosed.[citation needed]\n\nRecent re-releases[edit][]\n\nIn 2003, IVL (through Celestial Pictures) released a digitally restored version of this classic film with a new trailer and interviews, including Cheng Pei-pei.[7]"
