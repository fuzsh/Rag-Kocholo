        "text": "The Movie\n\nReleased in June 1982, Chan Is Missing was a ground-breaking independent movie that gave American audiences for the first time a fascinating insight into the diverse Chinese/Asian-American community of San Francisco’s Chinatown. Working with a meager budget of $22,500 - grants from the NEA and AFI - youthful film major Wayne Wang crafted a noirish mystery story about a missing person, the search for whom cleverly paralleling the search for Chinese American identity. The movie’s cinema verite style adds realism to its location-rich narrative. While the main characters were professional actors with the Asian American Theater Company in San Francisco, others in the cast were ordinary residents often simply ad-libbing as themselves. When completed, Chan Is Missing was rejected by the San Francisco International Film Festival before being accepted by a festival in New York. After the New York Times film critic Vincent Canby gave it a glowing review it was picked up for distribution, gradually gaining widespread popularity and recognition as a pioneer within its genre. Wang went on to achieve a very successful directorial career embracing a diversity of movie styles including major Hollywood productions such as The Joy Luck Club, Maid In Manhattan and Smoke. In 2018, the San Francisco International Film Festival finally and farsightedly corrected its shortsighted rejection of Chan Is Missing with a retrospective of Wang‘s career.\n\nThe Story\n\nCab drivers Jo (Wood Moy) and his nephew Steve (Marc Hayashi) have entrusted $4,000 to Jo’s friend Chan Hung to buy them a cab license so they can become independent drivers. But Chan and the money have gone missing and nobody in Chinatown knows where he is. They set out to find him, along the way encountering several of his friends and colleagues whose recollections of him paint a far different person than the one they thought they knew. As the film progresses viewers may find themselves wondering if Chan is real or if perhaps he is a representation of the diversity of Chinatown’s immigrant and American-born denizens.\n\nThe Locations\n\nWhere is Chan?
