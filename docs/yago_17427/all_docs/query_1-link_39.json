I hope he's not cold in that white coffin in the graveyard. I know he's not there anymore because angels come to the graveyard and open the coffin and he's far from the Shannon dampness that kills, up in the sky in heaven with Oliver and Margaret where they have plenty of fish and chips and toffee and no aunts to bother you, where all the fathers bring home the money from the Labour Exchange and you don't have to be running around to pubs to find them\" (90).\n\nBy the end of chapter 2, Angela has had a miscarriage and 3 of her living children have died.

He puts on his tie and his cap and goes to the Labour Exchange for the dole. He will never leave the house without collar and tie.

If you carry such things you lose your dignity. that's what he says...He tells Malachy and me tht when you grow up you have to wear a collar and tie and never let people see you carry things\" (98).\n\nBoots\n\nWhen men from Welfare inspect the McCourts house, Angela asks for new boots for the boys\n\nMalachy is upset that Angela begged for boots\n\nMalachy makes new soles for the boys shoes from rubber tires\n\nFrank and Malachy Jr. are teased at school about the boots\n\nThe Angel of the 7th Step\n\nAngela gives birth to her 6th child, another boy named Michael.\n\nMalachy tells Frank a story, that the baby was left by an angel of the 7th step of their house.

Frank is about 7 years old. No one dies and most of the stories are funny. School and Frank's First Holy Communion are the core of this chapter. Frank gets a \"formal education\" at school but this is contrasted with \"the education\" he gets from stories, on the streets and from his friends, especially Mikey Molloy.\n\n“The master says it’s a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it’s a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there’s anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything.

He says, We don't have room for him, and closes the door\" (149).\n\nChapter VI (6) Pages 151-169\n\nChapter 6 centers around Leamy's National School, the teachers and students. There is real contrast in the chapter between people who \"have\" and the \"have nots\". The \"haves\" are mean and do not share.

Do you know what an omadhaun is? I don't sir. It's the Irish, Clohessy, your native tongue, Clohessy. An omadhaun is a fool, Clohessy. You are an omadhaun. What is he, boys? An omadhaun, sir. Clohessy says, That's what Mr. O'Dea called me, sir, a diddering omadhaun\" (155).\n\nApple Peel\n\nMr. O'Neill peels an apple every day in class.\n\nIt is torture to watch him do this, because all the boys are so hungry\n\nDotty will give the apple peel to a good boy who knows the answers\n\nMr. O'Neill often throws the apple peel away in front of the starving boys\n\n\"It is torture to watch Mr.O'Neill peel the apple every day, to see the length of it, red or green, and if you're up near him to catch the freshness of it in your nose. If you're the good boy for the day and you answer the question he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk...There are days when the questions are too hard and he torments us by dropping the apple peel into the wastebasket\" (155).\n\nFintan Slattery\n\nVery religious\n\nBeautiful curly blonde hair\n\nHas food and money\n\nThe boys at school hate him\n\nFintan is very effeminate (possibly gay)\n\n\"Of course Fintan knows who stood at the foot of the cross.

That's all\" (159).\n\nThe next time Fintan takes Frank and Paddy home for lunch he taunts them by eating a sandwich in front of them and not giving them any food\n\nOn the way back to school Paddy gets angry and he and Frank decide to cut school\n\n\"Fintan, you had your lunch. We had nothing. Paddy explodes. You're a feckin'chancer, Fintan. That's what you are an' a feckin' begrudger too with your feckin' sangwidge an' your feckin' Sacred Heart Of Jesus on the wall an' your feckin' holy water. You can kiss me arse, Fintan\" (160).\n\n\"On the mooch\" (cutting school)\n\nFrank and Paddy Clohessy go on the mooch (cut school) that afternoon\n\nThey steal apples from the orchard\n\nDrink milk straight from the cow\n\nThey poop in the woods\n\nPlay in a stream\n\nFrank remembers this as one of the happiest days of his childhood\n\n\"Paddy and I sit under a hedge eating the apples till we can't swallow another bit and we stick our faces into a stream for the lovely cool water. Then we run to opposite ends of a ditch to shit and wipe ourselves with grass and thick leaves. Paddy is squatting and saying, There's nothing in the world like a good feed of apples, a drink of water and a good shit, better than any sangwidge of cheese and mustard and Dotty O'Neill can shove his apple up his arse...Paddy says, Bejasus 'tis milking time and he's over the wall, stretched on his back under a cow with her big udder hanging in his face. He pulls on a teat and squirts milk into his mouth. He stops squirting and says, come on, Frankie, fresh milk.
