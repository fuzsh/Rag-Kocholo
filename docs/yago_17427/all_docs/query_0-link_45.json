        "text": "Introduction\n\nPlasmodium falciparum is responsible for hundreds of millions of malaria cases worldwide each year. Since 2001, WHO has recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which combine a fast-acting drug (artemisinin and its derivatives) with long-acting partner drugs, to limit drug resistance. Nonetheless, artemisinin partial resistance, as defined by WHO, has arisen first in southeast Asia in the mid-2000s and now in South America and Africa, threatening the long-term efficacy of ACTs by facilitating selection for partner drug resistance.1\n\nAmong the six WHO-recommended ACTs, dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine has been widely used in southeast Asia and has been approved in Europe and several African countries.1 1 year after its deployment in Cambodia, artemisinin–piperaquine double-resistant parasites emerged.2, 3, 4 Copy number amplifications of the plasmepsin 2 (pfpm2) and plasmepsin 3 (pfpm3) genes were first identified as putative piperaquine resistance markers. These plasmepsins are aspartic proteases with multifaceted functions, including haemoglobin degradation, but their exact role in piperaquine resistance is unclear.3 Subsequently, single-point mutations (Thr93Ser, His97Tyr/Leu, Phe145Ile, Ile218Phe, Met343Leu/Ile, and Gly353Val) in the P falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfCRT) were identified as key drivers of resistance to piperaquine.5, 6 This transmembrane protein, located on the parasite digestive vacuole, exports host-derived peptides out of the digestive vacuole and regulates drug traffic.7 In southeast Asia, pfCRT mutations and pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplifications emerged on a pfkelch13 (pfk13) mutant background responsible for artemisinin partial resistance.5, 8 This joint artemisinin partial resistance–piperaquine resistance lineage rapidly spread throughout the Cambodian parasite population.4, 8\n\nEvidence before this study\n\nSince 2008, in southeast Asia, piperaquine resistance emerged in Plasmodium falciparum strains already partly resistant to artemisinin. Previous studies published in 2017 identified pfCRT mutations as well as plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3 gene amplifications as being responsible for the piperaquine resistance phenotype in this region. Different single-point mutations on pfCRT were suggested to be the main drivers of piperaquine resistance. We searched PubMed for articles published before May 25, 2023, with no language restrictions, using the terms “malaria”, “piperaquine”, “resistance”, and “South America”. Our search yielded 10 results including, in 2015, the first documented association between pfCRTC350R (ie, Cys350Arg) mutation and chloroquine resistance reversion as well as a slight decrease of P falciparum susceptibilities to piperaquine, in French Guiana. This mutation was later reported in Surinamese samples in 2017. To date, piperaquine resistance has not been documented outside southeast Asia.\n\nAdded value of this study\n\nThis study highlighted a high prevalence of piperaquine resistance in the parasite population of the Guiana Shield, which hinders dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine efficacy in the absence of artemisinin partial resistance. This resistance is associated with two genetic markers, a unique single-point mutation on pfCRT, pfCRTC350R, and plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3 gene amplifications. Additionally, a retrospective analysis of isolates from the Amazonian basin countries collected across a period of 20 years, shows an original evolutionary path of the parasites from the Guiana Shield. Since the early 2000s, the parasite population experienced multiple events of de novo emergence of the same pfCRTC350R mutation and preceding plasmepsin amplification. Overall, it appears that within the same period, piperaquine resistance emerged independently in southeast Asia and South America but followed a distinct path of selection, which appeared independent of the P falciparum genetic background.\n\nImplications of all the available evidence\n\nGiven this high prevalence and spread of piperaquine resistance in South America, dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine to treat P falciparum malaria is no longer an alternative for the region.\n\nIn South America, artemether–lumefantrine is the predominant first-line therapy; however French Guiana sporadically also prescribes dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. Additionally, another ACT including piperaquine (ie, Artecom, dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine–trimethoprim, Chongqing Tonghe Pharmaceutical, Chongqing, China) is used in remote mining regions by self-medicating gold miners. They represent the main population infected with P falciparum in the region.9 In South America, following intense chloroquine drug pressure in the 20th century, a specific pfCRT haplotype was selected at positions 72–76 (SVMNT).10 Although the removal of chloroquine pressure selected for the return of the ancestral K76 allele and chloroquine susceptibility on other continents, the K76T allele appears to have been fixed in the Guiana Shield region (encompassing Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and parts of Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia). Instead, chloroquine susceptibility was restored by a new mutation, pfCRTC350R (ie, Cys350Arg). Its spread was initially hypothesised to be driven by selection to restore a fitness deficit caused by chloroquine resistance. However, this mutation also appeared to modulate in vitro piperaquine sensitivity. The uncertain relationship between the in vitro isotopic testing method for this drug and in vivo treatment failures precluded confident identification of C350R as a selective driver of piperaquine resistance.11 Subsequently, a gene-editing study on the South American 7G8 reference strain showed an increase in piperaquine survival rate.12\n\nHere, we aimed to describe the prevalence of piperaquine resistance in P falciparum populations from the Guiana Shield, associated with the pfCRTC350R mutation and pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplifications.\n\nResults\n\nIn vitro piperaquine survival assays of randomly cultured French Guianese P falciparum isolates identified 40 (47%) of 86 (95% CI 35·9–57·1) of them to be piperaquine resistant based on a 10% survival rate threshold (appendix 3 p 7). Resistant isolates exhibited a mean survival rate of 24% (IQR 16·6–30·4). All isolates carrying the wild-type pfCRTC350 allele were piperaquine sensitive (mean survival rate of 0·8% [IQR 0·0–0·6]) whereas 40 (71%) of 56 pfCRTC350R mutant isolates were piperaquine resistant ( ). A significant association was observed between piperaquine resistance and the single nucleotide polymorphism coding for pfCRTC350R (Welch's t test, p<0·001, ). Furthermore, we found that the frequency of the pfCRTC350R allele evolved over time and rapidly increased among isolates in French Guiana after its first observation in 2002, reaching 16 (84%) of 19 (95% CI 67·5–100·0) in 2018 (Mann-Kendall test, τ=0·84, p<0·001; ).\n\nTo determine the potential effect of the pfCRTC350R allele on drug efficacy, we systematically investigated treatment response in patients treated by dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in French Guiana. Between Nov 28, 2016 and March 30, 2018, six patients infected with P falciparum were treated with a supervised full course of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (appendix 3 p 11). Two patients exhibited adequate clinical and parasitological responses and for four patients the treatment did not work with parasite recrudescence observed between day 23 and day 29. Of the four patients for whom the treatment did not work, one patient exhibited subtherapeutic piperaquine exposure. The other three were associated with correct piperaquine intake, ie, piperaquine resistance. Parasites within these three infections were pfCRTC350R mutant, with or without a pfpm2 or pfpm3 amplification ( ; appendix 3 p 11). In summary, the presence of the pfCRTC350R mutation led to the treatment not working after dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment in three (75%) of four patients (95% CI 32·6–100·0) and in vitro parasite resistance in 40 (71%) of 56 (59·6–83·3; ) of the patients. Treatment failure occurred solely through piperaquine resistance, without artemisinin partial resistance (assessed both in vitro and through Pfk13 genotyping). The two patients with adequate clinical and parasitological response were associated with parasites harbouring a single copy for pfpm2 and pfpm3. One patient was associated with parasites pfCRTC350R however, piperaquine-resistance status in vitro was unavailable due to an absence of material. The second patient showed in vitro susceptibility to piperaquine associated with wild-type C350.\n\nTo further confirm the association between pfCRTC350R and piperaquine resistance, we performed whole-genome sequencing and a genome-wide association analysis on a subset of 50 samples including 25 piperaquine-sensitive and 25 piperaquine-resistant parasites. pfCRTC350R was the only locus reaching statistical significance ( ). These results support the conclusion that pfCRTC350R is a major driver of piperaquine resistance, although it does not account for the complete resistance phenotype.\n\nGenomic data further support the hypothesis that the pfCRTC350R mutation experienced a soft, rather than a hard, selective sweep.19 First, pairwise fractional identity-by-descent around the pfcrt locus is not high between pfCRTC350R individuals (60th percentile; ). Second, we found evidence consistent with the occurrence of multiple de novo mutation events at pfCRTC350. Among the six clonal clusters whose members are separated by mutation but not recombination, we found one four-member clonal cluster that contains both pfCRTC350 and pfCRTC350R individuals (appendix 3 p 8). A complementary analysis of the 200 kb surrounding pfCRT showed 12 unique haplotypes, three of which contain both pfCRTC350 and pfCRTC350R alleles ( ).\n\nWe expanded our genotyping pool of isolates from French Guiana to a larger panel of 1374 additional isolates collected between July, 1997, and October, 2018, in Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and Brazil (ie, Pará, Amazonas, and Acre states). After 2006, the pfCRTC350R allele was at a high frequency in three countries of the Guiana Shield, namely Suriname (29 [83%] of 35 isolates [95% CI 67·6–93·5%]), Guyana (579 [73%] of 791 [69·9–76·1%]), and French Guiana (326 [59%] of 554 [54·7–62·9%]; ). Notably, we also observed a high prevalence of pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplifications in these countries ( ). In contrast, in the Amazonas state of Brazil, pfCRTC350R was observed at a low frequency. The wild-type pfCRTC350 allele was fixed, and no evidence of pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplifications were observed elsewhere. In addition, pfCRTC350R mutations were not found in samples from Afghanistan (n=66), which also contain the pfCRT 72–76 SVMNT haplotype.\n\nWe further investigated the role of plasmepsin gene amplifications because of their association with piperaquine resistance in southeast Asia. Pfpm2 and pfpm3 gene amplifications were first detected in 2007, 5 years after the first observation of pfCRTC350R ( ; appendix 3 pp 9, 12). Notably, we observed a positive correlation between pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplifications (Pearson's r=0·59, 95% CI 0·44–0·72; p<0·001), suggesting that both events either occur in a dependent manner or are present on the same genomic background (appendix 3 p 9). We therefore use the term xpfpm2 and pfpm3 to designate the amplification of pfpm2 or pfpm3 and 1pfpm2 and pfpm3 to denote one copy of both genes. The prevalence of pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplification changed over time (Mann-Kendall test, τ=0·82; p=0·019). Initially, pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplification was highly associated with the pfCRTC350R allele (Z test p=0·02) but, after 2011, the prevalence of pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplification in pfCRTC350 and pfCRTC350R isolates was not significantly different (Z test p=0·4 for the period 2012–14 and p=0·9 for the period 2015–18; ; appendix 3 p 9).\n\nAlthough pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplification was significantly associated with piperaquine resistance in our in vitro assays (Welch's t test p<0·001; appendix 3 pp 9–10), we found that the phenotypic effect of this genetic marker was dependent on the pfCRT background. We showed that although pfCRTC350 isolates remained sensitive to piperaquine regardless of pfpm2 and pfpm3 gene status (pfCRTC350 1pfpm2 and pfpm3 [median=0·0%; IQR=0–0·1%]; pfCRTC350 xpfpm2 and pfpm3 [0·4%; 0·1–0·9%]), plasmepsin gene amplification seemed to potentiate resistance to piperaquine in pfCRTC350R mutant isolates [21·2%; 16·2–30·2%; p≤0·001]; ). We similarly investigated pfmdr1 copy number variation and observed 12 (14%) of 88 isolates with a co-amplification of pfpm2 and pfpm3 and pfmdr1 (appendix 3 p 10). However, we found a correlation of 0 between pfmdr1 and pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplification (Pearson's r=0·11, p=0·29), or with pfCRTC350R allele (χ2 test, p=0·37), and with piperaquine resistance phenotype (Pearson's r=0·05, p=0·64; appendix 3 p 10).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study reports the de novo emergence of P falciparum piperaquine resistance in Guiana Shield countries, already exhibiting a high prevalence (40 [47%] of 86 isolates) in French Guiana between December, 2008, and April, 2018, based on in vitro phenotypes. Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine therapeutic failure in patients has been associated with this resistant profile, in the absence of partial resistance to artemisinin and pfk13 mutations. These observations, although on a small cohort, strongly support the importance of the partner drugs in ACTs, since mono-resistance to the partner drug has been shown to be sufficient to lead to therapeutic failures.21 Such resistance could also lead to enhanced selection for artemisinin partial resistance. Piperaquine-resistant parasites are highly prevalent in the three countries of the Guiana Shield where miners in the deep forest widely self-medicate using Artecom. This drug pressure was most likely initiated shortly after the year 2000, during the most recent gold rush.9, 11 Therefore, we speculate that this unofficial underlying but strong piperaquine pressure was sufficient to select for and spread pfCRTC350R.\n\nOur results identify pfCRT as the key player involved in piperaquine resistance in the Guiana Shield. To date, pfCRTC350R has solely been associated with pfCRT haplotype 7G8 (appendix 3, p 12) in South America and is predicted to localise on the lumen side of the transporter cavity where it affects the affinity of pfCRT to piperaquine.12 Morphological observations revealed the characteristic presence of swollen translucent digestive vacuoles14 in maturing trophozoites carrying the mutation (appendix 3 p 7).\n\nThis study further highlights the contrast in the piperaquine resistance evolutionary path between isolates from different regions as, in southeast Asia, piperaquine resistance is associated with the continuous emergence of several different but unique pfCRT mutations.6, 14 Furthermore, in southeast Asia, piperaquine resistance has arisen in close association with artemisinin partial resistance, whereas artemisinin partial resistance is not yet widespread in the Guiana Shield.1 Historical patterns of drug selection might explain this disparate outcome. In southeast Asia, previous use of piperaquine and artemisinin as monotherapy against malaria had already led to emergences of piperaquine resistance in the 1980s22 and artemisinin partial resistance in the mid-2000s.23 The deployment of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine later on might have selected for a co-lineage resistant to both artemisinin and piperaquine.4 In this case, the pfpm2 amplification was the first piperaquine resistance marker selected3 and, later on, pfCRT mutations5 ( ). These amplifications were also associated with pfmdr1 deamplification, due to the withdrawal of mefloquine.6 In this context, given the sequence of emergence of the two piperaquine resistance markers,3, 6 pfCRT mutations and plasmepsin gene amplifications were suggested to have contributed additively rather than epistatically to piperaquine resistance. Furthermore, the pfpm2 amplification was acknowledged as sufficient to confer piperaquine resistance in the absence of pfCRT mutations24 whereas, our results indicate that pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplification by itself could not lead to piperaquine resistance but led to the rapid selection of pfCRTC350R in the P falciparum population and the potentiation of piperaquine resistance levels. This regionally distinctive evolutionary pattern has also been noted for strains from Africa versus southeast Asia, with pfmdr1 mutations and amodiaquine resistance.25, 26\n\nFor 16 (18%) of 86 French Guianese isolates, pfCRTC350R does not lead to piperaquine resistance in vitro. This observation could be one of the reasons behind the presence of parasites carrying pfCRTC350R in one of the adequate response cases under dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment, the others being a possible low level of resistance in the absence of pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplification, or the patient-specific immune response. Hence, even though pfCRTC350R is the only common feature identified among piperaquine resistance isolates, it appears that piperaquine resistance in South America could involve other factors. Our genome-wide association study supported the primacy of pfCRTC350R in conferring resistance and did not identify additional genetic factors associated with it, but it was conducted with single nucleotide polymorphisms and not copy number variants (except pfpm2 and pfpm3), which remain difficult to accurately genotype in P falciparum with Illumina data. pfCRTC350R appears to have emerged via multiple recurrent mutational events within the past 20 years. This phenomenon, unique to this part of the world and occurring within a short timespan, suggests there are one or more unknown factors in the genetic background of the local parasite population conducive to the emergence of pfCRTC350R. We attempted to test this hypothesis directly by generating gene-edited clones from several strains collected in French Guiana (pfCRTC350R or not, pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplified or not, n=10 strains, 2 to 10 replicates each); however, we could not obtain viable clones. Further investigations are needed to thoroughly characterise other factors associated with P falciparum piperaquine resistance emergence in this region. Overall, we conclude that antimalarial drug resistance is not a deterministic process that will play out in the same manner in parasite populations around the world, but rather a phenomenon that could proceed along different mutational pathways as a function of local genomic diversity, historical selection pressure, and contemporary disease epidemiology. In this context, genetic surveillance needs to be tailored to specific parasite populations, and investigators and public health officers should recognise that genotypes might not map to phenotypes in a consistent manner across different geographical settings.\n\nFrom a patient-care perspective, we recommend a halt to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment for P falciparum malaria in cases diagnosed in or imported from the Guiana Shield, given the high prevalence of piperaquine resistance, as well as its impact on dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine efficacy. Although French Guiana is the only country in the region to include dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine as a first-line therapy alongside artemether–lumefantrine, dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is widely used for self-medication through the black market in the Guiana Shield. Curtailing its use will therefore be difficult but crucial if we want to preserve artemisinins and aim to eliminate P falciparum malaria in the region.\n\nBased on the prevalence of antimalarial resistance markers in the Amazonian parasite population, the alternatives to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine among ACTs are limited. For example, sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine should be avoided as an artemisinin partner drug, because triple resistance mutations in the pfdhfr and pfdhps loci have been fixed since the late 1980s. Amodiaquine resistance was also reported in the region in the 1970s, and exhibits high cross-resistance with chloroquine on this continent.27 Although Pelleau and colleagues11 showed that pfCRTC350R mutant parasites reversed their resistance to amodiaquine in addition to chloroquine,11 based on the actual prevalence of amodiaquine resistance in French Guiana (39 [51%] of 77, 2017–21, unpublished data), amodiaquine use is not a reliable option. Mefloquine was withdrawn decades ago because of pfmdr1 amplification.28 Since then, the prevalence of this amplification has decreased, but it has not disappeared (appendix 3 p 10). The recent deployment of artesunate–mefloquine in addition to artemether–lumefantrine in the Amazonas state of Brazil, requires tight monitoring.29 Lumefantrine, currently in use as an antiretroviral therapy partner drug in most of the countries of the Amazon basin, is still highly efficient,1 which could explain the failure of the pfk13 C580Y artemisinin partial resistance mutation to spread following its emergence in Guyana in 2010, and repeated observation in 2016.30 Finally, a WHO-recommended ACT that includes pyronaridine has not yet been deployed in South America, although recent data from southeast Asia showed its potency against piperaquine-resistance parasites.31 Overall, artemether–lumefantrine is the better first-line treatment option to treat P falciparum in Amazonia and more generally in malaria endemic areas worldwide whereas dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine appears to be exposed to a rapid selection for resistant parasites particularly in low endemic countries.\n\nThis online publication has been corrected.
