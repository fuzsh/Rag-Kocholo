        "text": "I wrote most of these a while ago, but am only posting this now because I didn’t get enough time to finish up the posts with the pictures and captions yet. Yes, the series is officially over. I am so behind too, but maybe it’s just a sign that I don’t want it to be over yet? I must be crazy, seeing that I’ve survived 70-plus episodes only to not want to run the finishing lap.\n\nSo, to kick it off…\n\nThe previous episode preview we saw Sun Sun bawling his heart out because bad bad Phillip the Old Man has taken him in his last-ditch, desperate attempt to get back at Martin, by taking his little one away. It would have been a cold-hearted, cruel one, but the fact that Martin is dead coupled with the fact that kidnapping Sun Sun is hardly business related shows that old Phillip is really going cuckoo.\n\nIt looks like Phillip is trying to drive a go-kart with one hand, but he’s really trying to push Sun Sun off onto the road. Evil, I tell you. But the fact that he bought some fries for Sun Sun before he tried doing it meant something. I mean, it’s not like he just did it in cold blood, he did think it over first. I dunno which possibility is scarier.\n\nYeah, that’s his new look of fury, which cracked me up so badly that I feel bad for doing it. Great acting, Chan Hung Lit! Anyway Charlie shows up out of nowhere, in classical Tvb style which I felt cheapened the story a little. I mean, it’s almost too convenient that the Ghost of Christmas Past just shows up and asks him why he’s doing all these. She is disappointed that he’d have to resort to hurting an innocent baby to get his revenge, all of which are sensible things to say, but I felt that it’d have been more powerful to have Phillip realise that on his own. I mean, Chan Hung Lit is such a great actor, he’d have no problems conveying the depth of emotions and conflict that his character is going through anyway.\n\nSo he and Charlie returns the baby to Terrence (because Jessica and her mansion is probably swarmed with security guys).\n\nTo give Terrence credit, he did tell Jessica that Sun Sun was sent to him anonymously. He then senses something wrong with Sun Sun because he won’t stop crying.\n\nThere were traffic problems on the way to the hospital, which resulted in Terrence grabbing Sun Sun and running all the way there instead. Aww. However…it was all too late.\n\nSun Sun’s death was probably one of the most anguishing parts of the two episodes. I don’t think it was well played out, but the fact that a young child died has to be sad. No matter that he died of some unknown allergic disease to fries, which I initially thought was coeliac disease. Coeliac disease doesn’t result in instant death if you take gluten-containing foods (I thought Sun Sun was allergic to gluten from what Jessica told Woh, but I could be wrong because I dunno those Canto terms for illnesses), it just makes you unwell, not die (not immediately anyway). Maybe Sun Sun was just allergic to starch or something like that and went into anaphylactic shock. I keep trying to rationalise his death, because it just seems so unlikely, so unexpected.\n\nFollowing that, they showed how some characters dealt with Sun Sun’s death, how they mourned, while Herman’s (Jessica’s new underling after Norman) press statement from Jessica regarding Sun Sun’s passing was used as a voiceover – first was Terrence, then Sylvia, then Woh.\n\nBaby Sun Sun does have a *bit* of makeup on too. Hmm.\n\nPoor Jessica, having to lose two of the people she loved most. Plus, Mummy doesn’t even remember her. =( I’d find every reason to jump off a building if I were her.\n\nI have so much more to say about the two episodes because there are loads of other things happening in episode 78, but I feel so bad after watching episode 77, that watching episode 78 just seemed to be a continuation of that pain.\n\nThere is this heavy load in my heart, because I know that Sun Sun’s death probably just took away another part of Jessica that makes her human. She became such a hard, tough woman after Martin’s withdrawal that it’s just going to be worse after Sun Sun is gone, since the only reason she’s pulling through all these obstacles was for him. Now she’s all alone, I don’t know really what’ll happen to her, and she deserves so much better. It doesn’t help to improve the mood that they’ve been bringing back flashes from the past when Martin was still alive, it shows how much she misses Martin, and I never really believed that Jessica would let Martin die, even if he was going to divorce her.\n\nOther important happenings are things like oh, Constance and Terrence getting back together. I didn’t know how that came along, because I was probably still paralysed from Sun Sun’s death. Since Derek’s incident, Terrence has let his conscience (Constance) control him, so he’s sort of driven to do good to the entire world to make up for his one sin, so that explains why he’d go all out to save Sun Sun too. Constance decides to give him another chance when she sees this I guess, coupled with all the Constance-counselling she’s got from Mr Suen etc. On Sylvia’s side, she’s in denial about Sun Sun’s death, and decides to distract herself with work. Calvin doesn’t give two hoots about it because he knows that’s her way of dealing with it, whereas Sunny thinks she should face it and bawl her heart out. Aww. Both of them throw hissy fits at each other about Sylvia, and Calvin shows his jealousy/anger at Sunny, partly because he thinks Sunny likes Sylvia. Oh, how wrong are you."
