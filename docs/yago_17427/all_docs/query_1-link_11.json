        "text": "8 weeks ago I was made redundant, just before our 6 week honeymoon trip. Not the best news to receive before this girl was about to go on a global shopping spree, but it allowed me to leave with no work load (unlike my husband who willingly checked in every 3 days üòÇ). The 6 weeks away allowed me to create again (pics attached). I was constantly in awe and deeply inspired by the new culture, the people and all the different kinds of knowledge that I hadn‚Äôt been exposed to. The trip got me to appreciate things in life that make me happy. Happiness motivates me. It gives me that hunger to strive and bounce back even higher after a redundancy. 1 week ago I started applying for jobs. Within that time, I‚Äôve gotten 3 interviews and 1 offer. This isn‚Äôt to boast about my abilities but rather to show that changing the mindset will bring a much more positive affect. So if you‚Äôve been in the same shoes here are some tips that worked for me: 1. Don‚Äôt play the blame game. Move on because your previous employer already has. 2. It is just a job. And as cocky as that sounds, the options out there will surprise you. 3. It might just be time to finally do something you love. Tap into different skills you‚Äôve been burying. Let that be your comeback. 4. Use a different job applying method. For the first time I used recruitment agencies and wow are they game changers. Goodbye sending out 100 CVs. 5. Lean on your community. Good friends will help you in ways you don‚Äôt expect. P.S. am still open to opportunities ‚ò∫Ô∏è #redundancy #redundancysupport #community #culture #mindset"
