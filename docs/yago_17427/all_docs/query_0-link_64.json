        "text": "Cantonese food is loved around the world, and there’s arguably no better place to try it than Hong Kong. Ahead of Asia’s 50 Best Bars 2024 returning to the city on 16 July, we asked a Hong Konger to share their favourite restaurants and must-order dishes\n\nThe beauty of Cantonese food in Hong Kong lies in its diversity. From dai pai dong stalls to cha chaan teng teahouses and dim sum halls, hopping from one spot to another is a rite of passage. Think: cash-only, formica tabletops, sharing tables, lazy susans and dim sum trolleys. This is the real Hong Kong – the vibrancy, the bustle and the humble yet delicious food served at every hour of the day. Here are eight restaurants to feast your way around the city like a local.\n\n1. Macaroni soup and milk tea at Australia Dairy Company\n\n@australia_dairy_co\n\nSample Cantonese-Western fusion at Hong Kong institution Australia Dairy Company\n\nQueues snake down the street outside this cash-only cha chaan teng, a Hong Kong staple that has been operating since the 1950s. Known for its lightning-fast, sometimes curt service, this no-frills diner offers affordable Canto-Western fusion breakfast sets and single main items. Its incredibly fluffy and moist crustless scrambled egg with corned beef sandwich is a classic. Pair it with a big bowl of comforting macaroni soup in a chicken broth fizzing with MSG and wash it down with a cup of silky Hong Kong milk tea. Don’t expect five-star service here and be prepared to share a table during peak times. The mantra is: eat swiftly, savour intensely and depart promptly.\n\n47 Parkes St, Jordan, Hong Kong\n\n2. Wontons galore at Ten Noodle Shop\n\n@Tennoodleshop\n\nStop by Ten Noodle Shop in Prince Edward for a bowl of plump wontons\n\nIn Hong Kong, wontons reign supreme as they are quick, budget-friendly and always reliable. Ten Noodle Shop, a beloved second-generation noodle joint in bustling Prince Edward district, draws crowds for its plump wontons. Each delightful, wrinkly ball of joy is filled with minced pork with a whole prawn nestled within. Slurp the handmade, satisfyingly springy noodles that are perfectly paired with the aromatic flounder fish and shrimp roe broth. Elevate your bowl with a variety of condiments, complimentary pickled daikon radish and crispy deep-fried fish skin for added crunch.\n\n45 Yu Chau St, Prince Edward, Hong Kong\n\n3. Jet-fuelled wok cooking at Oi Man Sang\n\nThis dai pai dong is one of the last to still use jet fuel to superheat its woks\n\nOne of the few places still using kerosene for wok cooking, your first impression of Oi Man Sang will likely stem from the flaming kitchen on the street as its chefs whip dishes out at warp speed and high temperatures. Oi Man Sang is as unfussy and unpretentious as it gets, but arrive early as it packs out with tourists and locals. Take a paper ticket, wait until your number gets called, sit on plastic stools among the sea of round wooden folding tables and order a round of Blue Girl beer. Established in 1956, it's among Hong Kong's oldest dai pai dongs, offering unchanged Cantonese classics like fragrant aubergine, sweet and sour pork and salt and pepper tofu. Thanks to the jet fuel, anything stir-fried gets the smoky wok-hei treatment and will be a true delight. Sadly, dai pai dongs (outdoor dining street food stalls) are a dying breed due to government regulations making it almost impossible to get a new licence unless passed down through generations. But Oi Man Sang is holding the fort strong. It’s worth noting that it’s cash only here, too.\n\nSham Shui Po Building, 1A-1C Shek Kip Mei St, Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong\n\n4. Egg tarts at Sun Wah Cafe\n\nGet lost in the nostalgic charm of Sun Wah Cafe with its comforting egg tarts\n\nEstablished in 1966 in the residential district of Cheung Sha Wan, Sun Wah Cafe is a two-storey, old-style cha chaan teng that is a rare find these days. The café has retained much of its original features and layout, including an on-site bakery that makes its own pineapple buns, egg tarts and other baked goods, filling the space with an intoxicating aroma of hot sugar, butter and coconut. From the compact booths and colourful tiled walls to the old Ovaltine containers holding chopsticks and silverware atop every formica tabletop, the space retains a nostalgic charm that holds a special place in Hong Kongers’ hearts. Try Sun Wah Cafe’s signature egg tart, served piping hot. The beautifully golden 200-layer, flaky puff pastry with a perfectly gooey egg custard filling tastes incredible.\n\n334 Castle Peak Rd, Cheung Sha Wan, Hong Kong\n\n5. Crispy vermicelli at Ju Xing Home\n\n@juxinghomesg\n\nOrder the crispy vermicelli nest with stir fried prawns to eat like a local chef\n\nJu Xing Home is a place you'll visit once and immediately want to return to. Always jam-packed with the city’s top chefs on their days off or after service, it owes its popularity to the exceptional cooking of chef Ng Kong Kiu and his wife, who he co-owns the restaurant with. The interior is simple, with a large table in the back storage room among cardboard boxes. Expect homely Cantonese cooking with top-end techniques, focusing on stir-fries and seafood, plus some spicy options. The must-order dish is the showstopping prawn and spring onion pan-fried vermicelli noodle nests, expertly fried in a wok to create the base of an impressive display. These sell out early, so reserving a table and pre-ordering certain dishes is recommended."
