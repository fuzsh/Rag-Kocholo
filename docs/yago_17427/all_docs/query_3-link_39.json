We are all united with one goal of providing excellent patient care while learning to become excellent clinical neurologists.​\n\nInterns (PGY1)\n\nHelen Chung, MD\n\nUndergraduate: University of Southern California\n\nMedical School: Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHey everyone!I’m Helen and I’m originally from the suburbs of Chicago, but I moved to Los Angeles where I attended undergrad and medical school at the University of Southern California. I’m super stoked to be on the east coast for residency and to explore everything that New England has to offer. Boston has been such a treat so far, and I’ve really enjoyed trying out different restaurants/bars, walking around this beautiful city, and exploring the music scene here. I also love hanging out with my cat Toto at home, cooking lots of Korean food (which admittedly cannot compare to LA), and hiking/camping around New England!\n\nLillian Dixon, MD\n\nUndergraduate: State University of New York at Fredonia\n\nMedical School: Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center In Guk (Josh) Kang, MD\n\nUndergraduate: Johns Hopkins University\n\nMedical School: Georgetown University School of Medicine\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi everyone! My name is Josh. I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and was raised in Vancouver, Canada. I moved over to Baltimore, MD to study neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University, where I spent an extra year working on cocaine research. Then, I went a little south to Washington, DC to attend medical school at Georgetown University, where I fell in love with neurology thanks to wonderful mentors. I’ve visited Boston, where my wife is from, over 10 times while living in the DC area. I am so excited to be calling Boston and New England my new home and starting neurology residency at BMC! In my free time, I love traveling with my wife by air, sea, and road, playing tennis, eating breakfast food (inspired by Ron Swanson on Parks and Rec) and crème brûlée (my favorite dessert), watching MasterChef, spending time with my co-residents, and playing with our dog (cutest little Maltipoo!), Brulee (guess where the name came from).\n\nRosalind Dick-Godfrey, MD\n\nUndergraduate: Boston College\n\nMedical School: New York Medical College\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi there! I grew up in San Diego, CA and switched coasts to attend Boston College for undergrad. I then moved to New York City for a clinical research position before completing medical school at New York Medical College. I am so excited to be back in Boston and really get to know the city! On my days off, I am headed to the next destination on my bucket list. There are so many places I hope to visit, and then visit again. Generally, I love to be outdoors. The beach will always have my heart but I have learned to appreciate the chillier activities as well! In my downtime I am recharging with a good book, cooking a cozy meal, or hanging with my fiance or co-residents. I am very close with my family and feel so lucky to have most of them nearby.\n\nHongfei Zhao, MD\n\nUndergraduate: New York University\n\nMedical School: University of Illinois College of Medicine\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center Adriana Lebowitz, MD\n\nUndergraduate: College of the Holy Cross\n\nMedical School: Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHey, my name is Adriana! I grew up in Orange, CT before attending Holy Cross in Worcester for undergrad, where I was an English major. I lived in Boston doing research for a couple years after graduation, then headed back to CT for med school at Quinnipiac… and now I’m back here so I guess I’ll just keep moving back and forth. I like hanging with friends, weightlifting, traveling, coffee, and being in the sun (despite spending my life in New England). I’m very close to my family and love spending time with my two baby neices. I’m also a huge foodie. Although I’m a bandwagon fan, I will say the vibes of Boston sports are unmatched, so I’m down to catch any game any time!\n\nJoyce Lee, MD\n\nUndergraduate: Princeton University\n\nMedical School: Boston University School of Medicine\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi everyone! I’m Joyce. I’m originally from Taipei and Vancouver. I did my undergraduate studies at Princeton, where I majored in neuroscience and minored in finance, then I worked at the Penn Memory Center as a science communications and research assistant. I completed medical school at Boston University, where I pursued my interests in neurology research, health policy, and health innovation. I’m excited to stay in this beautiful city and this special place for residency. Outside of medicine, I love good books, espresso (or coffee if I need to), walks/runs along the Esplanade, yoga classes, violin concertos, calligraphy, and French literature. Looking forward to meeting and working with everyone :)\n\nPGY-2\n\nRose Healy, MD\n\nUndergraduate: Amherst College, Amherst, MA\n\nMedical School: University of Massachusetts T.H. Chan School of Medicine, Worcester, MA\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi all! I’m Rose originally from Concord MA, went to Amherst College in western MA then hung around Boston/Cambridge before going to med school in Worcester MA and here I am now in Boston MA. Go Red Sox! In spare time I enjoy reading, rowing, hiking in NH, and spending time with my 4 nieces and 3 nephews who are all local. I will show you pictures of them at some point if we rotate together! My interests in Neurology are very broad! I’m looking forward to learning more about Stroke, Pain, Headache, Movement Disorders, and Neuromuscular.\n\nMotunrayo Olawaiye, MD\n\nUndergraduate: University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA\n\nMedical School: University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHello! My name is Moty. While I was born in the UK, then spent a stretch moving around a lot until my family settled in Pittsburgh, PA. I attended undergrad and medical school there at the University of Pittsburgh. We briefly lived in Boston and I’m happy to be returning to this wonderful city to complete my Neurology residency here at BMC. My subspecialty interests include Epilepsy, Headache, and Brain injury, but I am open to experiencing all as I progress through residency. When I’m not at work, I enjoy drawing, writing, gaming, and birdwatching.\n\nDaniel Li, MD Undergraduate: Brown University, Providence, RI\n\nMedical School: The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi there! My name is Dan and I am originally from a small suburb of New Jersey, although I spent the eight years before residency in Providence, RI where I attended Brown for undergrad and med school. I am incredibly excited to come to BMC for neurology residency and love Boston as a city. While I am not set on a subspecialty, I am very interested in neuro-oncology and neuro-immunology. Outside of work, I am a foodie by association to my partner and am often exploring restaurants and good eats in and around the city. I also enjoy working out, tennis, cooking, watching anime and am an avid PC gamer. We have an orange cat at home named Leo, and are hoping to add another cat or dog to the family in the near future!\n\nKhadar Haroun, MD\n\nUndergraduate: University of Georgia, Athens, GA\n\nMedical School: Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nI was born and raised in Atlanta, GA and attended undergrad at the University of Georgia which is in a college town called Athens just 1 hour north of Atlanta. I then attended the Morehouse School of Medicine for medical school where I researched the rate the diagnosis and outcome of Parkinson’s disease within the African American community. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports, obsessing over the NBA, filming skits, and watching a good anime. As an Atlanta native through and through, I’m looking forward to exploring Boston and the New England area!\n\nAnnie Hien, MD, PhD\n\nUndergraduate: University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA\n\nMedical School: University of Massachusetts T.H. Chan School of Medicine, Worcester, MA\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi! I am from Malden, just north of Boston, and attended UMass Amherst for college. I earned my MD/PhD at UMass Medical School, where I studied the regulation of translation and synaptic plasticity in the brain. I have not decided on a subspecialty yet and so far in intern year, I am enjoying the opportunities to explore different neurology subspecialties and work with wonderful BMC faculty, residents, and staff! In my spare time, I love to rock climb, mountain bike, explore new restaurants, play board games, and take pictures of my two rescue cats Denali and Katahdin.\n\nRichard Tartarini, MD\n\nUndergraduate: Providence College, Providence, RI\n\nMedical School: Albany Medical College, Albany, NY\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHey everyone!

I’m excited to be back home in Boston for Neurology Residency at BMC! After my interview day here, I knew almost immediately that BMC was the best fit for me and had the most welcoming and supportive environment. Although I don’t have a subspeciality chosen yet, I am currently most interested in stroke, autoimmune neurology, and neuro infectious disease. I also have a strong interest in an academic career with emphasis on medical education and research. In my spare time, I enjoy video games, martial arts, learning languages, and spending time with family, friends, and my French bulldog Drogo (yes, from Game of Thrones).\n\nGrigorios Kalaitzidis, MD\n\nMedical School: Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Medical School, Thessaloniki, Greece\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHiya! I am Grigorios, but you can call me Greg. I come from Greece (hence, the long name). Being raised in Greece, I probably inevitably fell in love with the sea, the sun, classical history, and philosophy. During medical school in Greece, I enjoyed having long conversations with friends outdoors accompanied by our freddo espresso (cold coffee), played for my school’s basketball team, and went on summer excursions to the Greek islands. After graduating, I moved to Kos, an island on the southeastern edge of Europe, where I cared for local inhabitants and refugees. I then moved to Baltimore to pursue my passion for research in Multiple sclerosis. In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball, following the NBA, hanging out with friends, traveling, visiting museums, and coding.\n\nPGY-3\n\nArianna K.

I’m from Methuen, MA which is close to the NH border. I did my undergrad & 3 years of research in Boston prior to going to medical school in Philly, and was happy to be able to come home for residency! In my spare time, I enjoy learning new recipes, kayaking, spending time with my husband and our Boston Terrier & rooting for the Patriots. I have enjoyed my medicine year at BMC but am excited to begin neurology and explore my varied interests in the field!\n\nNicole T. Hayes, MD\n\nUndergraduate: Providence College\n\nGraduate (M.S.): Tufts University\n\nMedical School: University of Massachusetts Medical School\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHey! My name is Nicole and I’m originally from Hingham, Massachusetts. I went to medical school at UMASS Med in Worcester in western Massachusetts (pronounced “Woostuh”) where I had the opportunity to explore some of my outdoor hobbies such as rock climbing and hiking . I was drawn to BMC because of their mission as a Safety net hospital which I have found to be shared by my fellow co-residents and attendings that I’ve had the opportunity to work with this year. I’ve enjoyed intern year in learning medicine and meeting lots of new friends in the medicine residency and am excited to start my neurology training. When I’m not in the hospital you can catch me skiing in the winter months and going to the beach at any chance I get!\n\nTimothy Felong, MD\n\nUndergraduate: University of Rochester\n\nMedical School: Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nI was raised on chicken wings with two brothers in Buffalo, NY, where the best AFC East football team plays! My hometown’s proximity to Canada shaped my upbringing as an ice hockey player and Tim Hortons’ coffee loyalist. During undergrad the University of Rochester, I studied biomedical engineering and English (focusing on creative writing and science fiction). I ultimately left Western New York inspired by Boston Medical Center’s mission and knowing I would be embraced by the BMC Neurology Department’s warm and supportive residents, staff, and attending physicians! Working as a medicine intern at BMC has been exhilarating and rewarding, and I am excited to now focus on neurology while learning from our clinical and research experts. In spare time, I enjoy Sox games at Fenway, Boston’s art museums, and Charles River runs!\n\nHaley Huggins, MD\n\nUndergraduate: Clemson University\n\nMedical School: Tufts University School of Medicine\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi all! I grew up in Bedford, MA which is a small town just north of Boston. I went to Tufts for medical school and am so happy to be able to continue my training in this wonderful city. I love BMC for it’s mission in serving the underserved. The patient population as well as the incredibly dedicated faculty and staff make BMC such an incredible place to learn. I have loved getting to know my medicine colleagues during my prelim year at BMC but I am so excited to start my neurology training and explore my many interests in the field. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the city with my black lab puppy Howard (“Howie”), discovering new restaurants, playing board games, and tending to my community garden.\n\nKelsey G. Jones, MD\n\nUndergraduate: Boston College\n\nGraduate (M.S.): Tufts University\n\nMedical School: University of Massachusetts Medical School\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi everyone! My name is Kelsey. I grew up in Hopkinton, MA (the start of the Boston Marathon!), went to Boston College, got a master’s degree at Tufts, and then went to UMass for medical school. I’m so glad I get to do residency at BMC and stay in the best state in the country! I feel so lucky to get to work with so many truly wonderful co-residents, attendings, staff members, and patients – BMC is truly a special place and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else for residency! Outside of work I love reading (especially fantasy and sci fi), writing, wandering around Boston, and exploring the rest of New England.\n\nSusan Z. Recio, MD\n\nUndergraduate: University of Pennsylvania\n\nMedical School: Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi everyone! I grew up in upstate New York but have primarily lived in/around Philly with brief stints in DC and NYC. I’m new to Boston but I love it for its proximity to New England (hiking and fall foliage!) and have enjoyed exploring museums, restaurants, and green spaces in the city. BMC is a special place, both in the patient population we serve and the amazing co-residents, faculty, mentors, and students I’ve had the privilege of getting to know along the way. In my free time, I enjoy running by the Charles River, tending to my indoor jungle of houseplants, going to concerts, traveling, and drawing/painting to decompress. I will always take you up on any offer to get boba, ice cream, dim sum, or any combination of the three.\n\nChristine H. Server, MD\n\nUndergraduate: Johns Hopkins University\n\nMedical School: University of Maryland School of Medicine\n\nInternship: University of Maryland Medical Center\n\nI was born and raised in a Lake Michigan beach town and later came to call Baltimore my home. Even though I studied neuroscience in college, I didn’t seriously consider it as my future specialty. Luckily, neurology was my very first rotation of my third year of medical school and I fell in love with it after rotating through the neuro ICU. I am now excited to call Boston my new home and continue my neurology training at BMC. I look forward to exploring the city with my husband, who moved here with me for psychiatry residency.\n\nPGY-4\n\nAva Bakhtyari, MD\n\nAdmin/Recruitment Chief\n\nUndergraduate: University of Massachusetts Amherst\n\nMedical School: Robert Larner, M.D., College of Medicine at the University of Vermont\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi all, my name is Ava like Avacado! I’m from Andover, Massachusetts just a touch north of Boston. I loved going to med school at the University of Vermont, but am very happy to be back home.

Outside of work I love walking along the esplanade, practicing yoga, going on spontaneous bubble tea trips in Chinatown, and catching Pats games at local neighborhood bars in the South End with my co residents. I also enjoy summer excursions outside of the city including hiking in NH or western mass and visiting the cape for some beach time!\n\nTatiana Greige, MD\n\nAdmin/Scheduling Chief\n\nMedical School: Faculté de Médecine Paris Descartes, France\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi all, my name is Tatiana! I was born and raised in Paris, France where I also attended medical school at la Faculté de Médecine Paris Descartes. I moved to Boston right after graduating from medical school to pursue a research fellowship in Neurology at BIDMC before ending up at BMC for residency. I absolutely love working at BMC not only because of the incredible mission of the hospital but also because of the wonderful mentorship and education we receive. The residency program has become my home away from home thanks to my amazing co-residents and I feel so lucky to train here. Outside of medicine, I enjoy skiing and paddle-boarding, going to art museums and exploring new restaurants with friends and co-residents! I have also become an avid Boston sports fan and love to go watch the Bruins or the Red Sox play.\n\nKaran Hingorani, MD, PhD\n\nEducation Chief\n\nUndergraduate: York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nGraduate (PhD): University of Massachusetts Amherst\n\nMedical School: Boston University School of Medicine\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi! My name is Karan, I usually mime it as Car-run, originally from Mumbai, India. I made my way to BMC by way of Toronto where I studied abroad for a year in college, followed by a PhD at UMass, Amherst and finally an MD right across the street at BU. Some would say I’m still studying abroad. Outside of work, I enjoy swing dancing, swimming, playing scrabble, spending time with my wife and dog and of course with my co-residents who have been an invaluable source of joy and support in and out of the workplace.\n\nEmma Kaplan, MD\n\nScheduling Chief\n\nUndergraduate: University of Pennsylvania\n\nMedical School: University of Maryland School of Medicine\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi there! I’m Emma from Baltimore, Maryland. I’d never spent a lot of time in Boston before residency, but wanted to move somewhere totally new and try something different! I feel very lucky to have come here, where I’ve made amazing friends with my co-residents and have taken up hiking (I own hiking boots now)! I like to spend summer days off at the local beaches, and I drink insane amounts of bubble tea in all seasons (shout out to Ava).\n\nRobert McCormick, MD\n\nResearch/QI Chief\n\nUndergraduate: Boston College\n\nMedical School: Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi! I’m originally from New Hampshire but I’ve spent 6 years in Boston – 4 at Boston College and 2 here at BMC, with a detour to New York at Hofstra/Zucker School of Medicine in between. I love BMC because of the people here and culture of our program. All of the residents and faculty are great to work with, and we have a lot of fun both at and outside of work. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my wife and my dog, trying to get better at golf (I still have a long ways to go), and rooting for the Boston sports teams.\n\nCayla Vila, MD\n\nWellness Chief\n\nUndergraduate: Wellesley College\n\nMedical School: The George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHello! My name is Cayla and I’m from New Jersey. I went to Wellesley College for undergrad, followed by service in the AmeriCorps Community HealthCorps, and then medical school at George Washington University. BMC Neurology has felt just like home since day one! I love our hospital’s mission-driven culture of service, our tight-knit residency family, and living in Boston. I’m grateful to be in a program that values and supports my free time and well-being, and challenges and respects me as a young clinician. In my free time I love to dance (ballet, salsa, hip hop, and more), spend time outside at the Esplanade or roam around the city with my co-residents, embroider, cook, and hang out with friends.\n\nEmily White, MD\n\nEducation Chief\n\nUndergraduate: Bates College\n\nMedical School: The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University\n\nInternship: Boston University Medical Center\n\nHi All! I grew up in the Boston area and am very happy to be back for residency. I’ve felt welcomed into the BMC and neurology community since arriving for my interview day, and I continue to be impressed by the wonderful human beings that also choose to make this hospital their home. Boston is an awesome place to explore – I’ve enjoyed many wandering/walking adventures both from my apartment in the South End and through day trips to nearby mountains for hiking. I love making ice cream cakes, cookies, and creme brûlée (amongst other sweets). In the spring, summer, or fall, you might find me doing acroyoga in a park, and in the winter, you might find me on the ski slopes. There is also nothing quite a like a good board game night at home."
