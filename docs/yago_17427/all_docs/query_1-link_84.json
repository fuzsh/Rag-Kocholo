        "text": "01 of 131\n\nChrishell Stause & G Flip\n\nThe Selling Sunset star and the Australian musician tied the knot in May 2023, PEOPLE confirmed.\n\nStause posted an Instagram reel, featuring video snippets of her and G Flip enjoying time together.\n\n\"Love doesn't always go as planned… Sometimes it's immeasurably better,\" Stause captioned the reel, which showed a picture of them married at the end of the reel.\n\n\"They found love together in an unexpected place but nothing has ever felt more real to them,\" a source told PEOPLE.\n\n02 of 131\n\nSia & Dan Bernad\n\nThe Australian singer and songwriter Sia wed her boyfriend Dan Bernad in an intimate, candlelit ceremony at Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana's Villa Olivetta in Portofino, Italy, in May 2023.\n\nThe pair exchanged vows under an iron gazebo decorated with stunning pink, purple, yellow and white florals. The outdoor space also featured lavish gold tables topped with white candles in glass cases.\n\n03 of 131\n\nGabourey Sidibe & Brandon Frankel\n\nOscar nominee Gabourey Sidibe revealed on Live with Kelly and Ryan in December 2022 that she married fiancé Brandon Frankel, who was in the studio audience during the talk show appearance.\n\nAfter detailing the proposal story (they got engaged in November 2020 after meeting each other on a dating app), Sidibe explained, \"The thing about weddings is I don't like them. I don't like them. Here's an example of how much I don't like them: I'm actually married. We got married over a year ago.\"\n\nWhen hosts Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest said they were \"confused\" and asked if this was \"breaking news,\" Sidibe said yes and added that they tied the knot \"at the kitchen table\" about four months after their engagement.\n\n04 of 131\n\nJonathan Knight & Harley Rodriguez\n\nIn August 2022, New Kids on the Block singer Jonathan Knight revealed to Entertainment Tonight that he and longtime love Harley Rodriguez quietly tied the knot.\n\nWhen asked about the ring on his finger, Knight said \"we did\" get married.\n\n\"But everybody just assumed we're married, so, I never say yes or no 'cause I don't wanna lie,\" he added in the interview.\n\nET added that while the couple is officially hitched, they haven't celebrated yet due to the pandemic.\n\n\"It's coming,\" he teased.\n\n05 of 131\n\nLance Armstrong & Anna Hansen\n\nThe athlete and his fiancée, who have been engaged since 2017, wed at Château la Coste in France, he announced on Instagram on Aug. 9, 2022. Only close friends and family, including the couple's children, attended the ceremony, which Hansen called \"the perfect elopement.\"\n\n\"Married the love of my life @annahansenarmstrong,\" Armstrong wrote in the caption alongside his wedding photos. He continued, \"So special having our kids there as well. It was an evening full of laughter and plenty of joyful tears.\"\n\nThe couple are parents to Max, 13, and Olivia, 11. Armstrong also has a son Luke, 22, and twin daughters Grace and Isabelle, 20, with his ex-wife, Kristin Richard.\n\n06 of 131\n\nNikki Bella & Artem Chigvintsev\n\nIn August 2022, Total Bellas star Nikki Bella announced her happy news on Instagram, revealing she wed Artem Chigvintsev. A source told PEOPLE the wedding took place in Paris that month.\n\n\"We said I DO,\" Bella captioned a photo of her and the Dancing with the Stars pro's hands with their new wedding bands. She also shared a picture of her and Chigvintsev embracing and taking in the Paris skyline, including the Eiffel Tower, as they toasted their newlywed status.\n\nShe shared another photo of her holding her new husband's hand on her Instagram Story, writing, \"We both can't stop smiling I never want this feeling to end. I will love you forever and ever Mr Chigvintsev.\"\n\n07 of 131\n\nBen Affleck & Jennifer Lopez\n\nNow she's Jennifer Affleck from the block! The A-list couple surprised everyone in July 2022 when they wed in Vegas just before midnight on July 16. \"With the best witnesses you could ever imagine, a dress from an old movie and a jacket from Ben's closet, we read our own vows in the little chapel and gave one another the rings we'll wear for the rest of our lives,\" Lopez wrote in her On the JLo newsletter, adding that the ceremony was \"exactly what we wanted.\" The pair — who famously dated in the early 2000s though never made it down the aisle — rekindled their romance in 2021 and got engaged in early 2022.\n\n08 of 131\n\nSymone Sanders & Shawn Townsend\n\nThe MSNBC host said \"I do\" in a surprise Washington, D.C., wedding ceremony on July 15 following her year-long engagement to Townsend.
