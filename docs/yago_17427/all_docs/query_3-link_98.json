        "text": "\"Win or lose, doesn't matter. Fight hard. Earn respect.\"\n\n―Mr. Han to Dre Parker[src]\n\nMr. Han (S: 韩先生, T: 韓先生) is the deuteragonist of The Karate Kid (2010). He is the counterpart of Mr. Miyagi.\n\nHe is played by actor and martial artist Jackie Chan.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nMr. Han at some point learned Kung Fu from his father & became skilled in English. Han's 10 year old son, Gong Gong, and wife, Zhang died in a car crash as a result of him being distracted by an argument with he has having with Zhang while they were driving in his car. They ultimately crashed, killing Zhang and Gong Gong, leaving Mr. Han relentlessly driven by guilt for it. Every year, he smashes the car after fixing it on the date of their deaths and fixes it again after that to repeat the cycle, hoping to relieve his guilt somehow. At some point, he got a job as a maintenance man at an apartment building.\n\nThe Karate Kid (2010)[]\n\n\"Kung Fu is for knowledge, defense. Not to make war, but to create peace.\"\n\n―Mr. Han to Dre Parker[src]\n\nMr. Han is first seen in his shed eating noodles and swatting a fly. Dre was trying to get his attention but he helped someone else. He at some point checked the shower in Dre and Sherry's apartment and stated that it works and that they use a switch.\n\nMr. Han helps Dre when he is getting beaten up by Cheng and his friends. He beats them up easily and tells them all to go home. He heals Dre using fire-cupping. Han then takes Dre to the Fighting Dragons Studio where he meets Master Li. He makes a deal with the master, allowing Dre to train for an open Kung-Fu tournament without any interference from Li's students. Mr. Han gets invited to go to the Shi-Shi festival with Dre and his mother, which he declines at first but reluctantly agrees to go with them in the end.\n\nMr. Han starts training Dre. Dre gets fed up with his unorthodox methods until he shows how it helps & that Kung Fu lives in everything they do. He takes Dre to a Shaolin temple where he learned Kung Fu. He eventually gives him a day off. He almost fixes his car but he destroys it after remembering his dead wife & son & gets intoxicated. Dre helps him cope & that gave him a second chance as a father. After his training, he helped him reconcile with Meiying and her parents.\n\nMr. Han continued to train him for the tournament even teaching him the cobra pose. He watched him through the tournament and when Dre got injured, he originally refused to help him believing that he proved he was brave. But Dre was eager to return so reluctantly he healed him using the fire-cupping technique again.\n\nAt the Kung-Fu tournament, Dre successfully defeats Cheng and the rest of the Fighting Dragon students thanks to the teachings of Mr. Han. At the conclusion of the tournament, Dre gives a respectful bow to Mr. Han.\n\nFighting Style[]\n\n\"How did you do that up there? You like even didn't punch them. They... beat each other up.\"\n\n\"When fighting angry, blind men... best we just stay out of the way.\"\n\n―Dre Parker and Mr. Han[src]\n\nMr. Han is potentially one of the most skilled fighters in the entire Franchise. He managed to beat six skilled opponents without striking them, being able to swiftly disarm them and take down themselves with ease. Mr. Han believes that the Kung-Fu taught at the Fighting Dragons Studio is not true Kung-Fu used for the proper reasons.\n\nDuring his fight with Master Li, he was able to defeat him also without landing any strikes.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nHe is similar to Mr. Miyagi but he lacks his sense of humor. He appears as a more depressed person, seen emotional about his deceased wife and son, while also being enraged over their deaths that he feels responsible for. Although he may not be the most positive person, he cares about Dre and resembles respect towards those who share the same amount towards him.\n\nTrivia[]"
