She currently lives in Portland, Maine with her husband and two children.\n\nJacki was born in New Jersey, but raised in the heart of the Midwest and currently works from a field office outside of Kansas City, Kansas. She has spent over a decade working in student exchange. However, she spent many years working in the areas of administration and banking, before finding her passion in the field of international cultural and educational exchange. Beginning as a host family, she has gone on to host 14 young people, whom she now calls family, from all over the world. After witnessing the impact these young people had on her family, schools, and community she joined the staff at CIEE: Council on International Educational Exchange. Following her start as a local coordinator. She moved on to the positions of Regional Director and Director of Training. She has worked Pre-Departure Orientations for students and their natural families in Europe, has participated in conducting orientations in the United States, and has overseen hundreds of student placements with families throughout the United States. She attended Johnson County Community College and is a proud grandmother of one and mother of two married sons.\n\nKatie lives in a beautiful small town in Kentucky with her husband and 2 dogs. She loves the outdoors and enjoys camping, hiking and being on the lake. She became involved with exchange by first becoming host parents, but it ended up being so much more. Their first experience as host parents changed them and they began to see the world differently, they found a passion for culture; learning about other’s and sharing their own. That passion led her to become an Area Representative and then part of the Pan Atlantic full time team. She believes strongly that Pan Atlantic Foundation are working together to make the world a smaller place. She and her husband Paul love sharing their country, home, life and culture as much as possible. It gives them a profound sense of purpose and pride. She couldn’t imagine her life without this program.\n\nAllison has worked with Pan Atlantic from day one as an Area Representative. She brings with her a wealth of experience in direct sales as well as several years of experience in the exchange industry. Professionally trained as a nurse, she also brings the compassion needed for that role into her role as a Regional Director. She worked in a busy Emergency Department for over 20 years where she served a diverse population due to the robust international program at the University of Kansas. She assisted her husband, Stan, who was a youth pastor in supporting/coaching teenagers and their families. She has traveled within the U.S. and overseas as a volunteer doing ministry work and regularly interacted with people from varied cultural backgrounds. She lives in Missouri, is a happily married mother to three adult children and “Yaya” to two precious grandsons. Allison believes that people and holidays should be thoroughly celebrated, is a reluctant dog mom and makes a mean lasagna. She is enthusiastic and passionate in her support of exchange students, host families and Area Representatives. She truly believes her work allows her to make the world a better place, one student at a time!\n\nMary is a native Oregonian and lives in a small town just south of Portland. Mary has a degree in Communications and Business Administration from Portland State University. She became the first area representative in Oregon in 2018 and is now the regional director for the northwest and California. She enjoys baking, gardening, hiking, traveling, and spending time with family and friends. Mary’s passion is working with international students and helping to make sure their year in America is the best it can be.\n\nMegan is a Kansas girl transplanted to the wonderful state of Missouri! Although reluctant to make the move initially, she can’t imagine life outside of the Show Me State! Megan was homeschooled most of her academic journey until attending college where she studied Floriculture and Horticulture Design. It didn’t take long to realize that though she enjoyed the creative outlet of floral arrangements, she didn’t see herself making it a career. After a few years of working various jobs gaining experience, she was hired as the Assistant to the CEO at a local ministry/nonprofit in Missouri. It was during her time with this organization that she found her true niche: administrative work. Megan spent the next four years honing her new-found love of spreadsheets, project management, event planning, and learning all the ins and outs of being an admin. Yep, she really does weirdly enjoy it all! As her time with the ministry came to an end, she started exploring other opportunities and came across an opening at Pan Atlantic Foundation that was in need of a Megan-sized filling! When she’s not giddily tracking data on spreadsheets or crafting social media graphics for our students, you can find her eating tacos, thrifting with her mom and sister, playing board games with her son, watching reruns of her favorite shows, or inhaling iced coffee. She’s left-handed, quick-witted, can wiggle her ears, and creating elaborate Halloween costumes for her son is her superpower!"
