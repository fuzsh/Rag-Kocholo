        "text": "Description\n\nBrimming with scientific references, a scarce handwritten letter from Nobel Prize-winning physicist Wilhelm Rontgen to one of his most successful students\n\nDistinguished German physicist (1845-1923) who discovered X-rays in 1895, for which he was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901. Scarce ALS in German, signed \"W. Rontgen,\" one page both sides, 4.5 x 3.5, personal letterhead, June 14, 1906. Handwritten letter to atomic physicist Rudolf Ladenburg. In full (translated): \"Enclosed I return the correction you sent me and Reiger's dissertation. I've read through them in various places and found nothing that should be changed. Concerning the question of the determination of relaxation, I am entirely in accord with you: I have also expressed similar opinions in the same sense, when I mentioned the possibility of an influence of relaxation in general. If in addition you wish to use Reiger's results to show that in your case—experiments relaxation plays no noticeable role, then I have nothing against that. Nevertheless there do indeed remain Laue's own experiments, currents in pipes, Poiseuille's Law—the best proof—we hope! In your letter you hold out the prospect of finding out more from Laue. That would really please me! Have you really turned your back on Munich forever?\" In fine to very fine condition.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1906, Rudolf Ladenburg worked on his dissertation, 'On the Inner Friction of Viscous Liquids and their Dependence on Pressure,' under the direction of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Wilhelm Rontgen. As his work was coming to a close, Ladenburg sent corrections along with fellow physicist Rudolf Reiger's recently published dissertation. Rontgen's reply offers several bits of advice, pointing him towards sources beyond Reiger that should be considered in support of his work, including \"Laue's own experiments, currents in pipes, Poiseuille's Law.\" With his finger on the pulse of the scientific world, this letter shows the active connectivity among scholars at the start of the century. Rontgen autographs are rare in any form; this letter, filled with scientific references and written to a student who would go on to join forces with Einstein and von Neumann in Princeton years later, is one of the finest we have offered.\n\nAuction Info\n\nAuction Title: Fine Autograph and Artifacts\n\nDates: #672 - Ended August 16, 2023\n\nThis item is Pre-Certified by PSA/DNA\n\nBuy a third-party letter of authenticity for $150.00\n\n*This item has been pre-certified by a trusted third-party authentication service, and by placing a bid on this item, you agree to accept the opinion of this authentication service.
