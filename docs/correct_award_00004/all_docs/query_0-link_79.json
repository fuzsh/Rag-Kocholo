        "text": "Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen found his passion for physics in Zurich in 1865. Quarter a century later, he discovered rays that rendered humans transparent. With the discovery of X-rays, it was now possible for the first time, to take pictures from the inside of the body. This was followed by a revolution in the field of medicine in which previously unimaginable possibilities were opening up. To this day, about 40 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for discoveries and findings that are based on radiotechnology."
