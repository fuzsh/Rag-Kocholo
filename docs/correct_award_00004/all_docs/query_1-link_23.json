        "text": "(1845-1923)\n\nOne of the most important events in the development of medicine was the discovery of X-rays by Roentgen. His original report, published in December 1895 and titled “On a New Kind of Ray,” marked the beginning of radiology and won him the first Nobel Prize for Physics in 1901. Less than 20 years after Roentgen’s work, the use of X-rays in diagnosis and treatment of diseases became a well-established practice."
