In 1901, this achievement made him the first person to ever win the #NobelPrize in Physics.\nWhile many of us are probably most familiar with Röntgen’s X-rays when seeing doctors treat broken bones, and in some languages, X-rays are even called röntgen, but X-rays actually have a wide variety of uses. When used in art and cultural artefact restoration, restorers can assess damage and uncover details hidden in artefacts, unlocking a wealth of information about the past. They are also used to check the quality of everyday items like car tires, cables and wires, and even airplanes through a method called non-destructive testing (NDT), which draws on a combination of X-rays and gamma rays. Scientists are also looking at how they can use X-rays to further studies on #nuclear #fusion.\n\nToday we can thank Röntgen and the scientists who built on his discovery for the many innovative ways we now use X-rays to improve lives and help people around the world.\".",
