        "text": "1.2.1 The Discovery of X-Rays and Radioactivity\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, “Newtonian” physics had explained nearly all the phenomena involving mass, speed, electricity, and heat. However, some questions remained unanswered, notably the origin of the luminescence phenomena observed either in glass vacuum tubes subjected to a high voltage (e.g., the Crookes tubes—Fig. 1.2) or on certain ores [4]. In both cases, one of the major questions was their inducibility vis-à-vis the sunlight. The German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen addressed the first challenge by putting some opaque boxes on the Crookes tube, while the Frenchman Henri Becquerel focused on the second one by studying light emitted by uranium ores in the darkness. The two series of experiments became legendary and led to two Nobel prizes in physics [4].\n\nIn November 1895, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (Roentgen) (1845–1923) detected electromagnetic radiation of a sub-nanometer wavelength range, today known as X- or Roentgen rays. For this discovery, he was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901. Although he investigated these X-rays and learned much about their interactions with matter, for a long time, he was not entirely convinced that he had made a real discovery [5] (Box 1.1).\n\nBox 1.1 Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen\n\nWilhelm Conrad Röntgen (1845–1923) experimented with Crookes tubes and in November 1895 detected electromagnetic radiation of a sub-nanometer wavelength range (X-rays).\n\nHe earned the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901.\n\nRoentgen was born in Lennep, Rhineland, Germany [6]. When he was 3 years old, his family moved to the Netherlands. He was an average student in the primary and secondary school, and in November 1865, he enrolled in the polytechnical school of Zurich, graduating as a mechanical engineer in 1868. After that, Roentgen remained at the University of Zurich as a postgraduate student in mathematics having August Kundt, an expert in the theory of light, as a mentor. Roentgen’s first experiments in Zurich concerned the properties of gases and proved to be important for his subsequent discoveries. His doctoral thesis “Studies on Gases” led to his being awarded a PhD degree in 1869 and being appointed as an assistant to Kundt. In 1870, Roentgen, following Kundt, returned to Germany to the University of Wurzburg (Bavaria). In the autumn of 1893, he was elected Rector at the University of Wurzburg, having 44 publications and being highly respected by his colleagues and the larger academic community. Richard I. Frankel gives an excellent description of the life of W. C. Roentgen as a scientist and describes in detail the events leading up to his groundbreaking discovery.\n\nOn November 8, 1895, after experimenting with cathode rays produced in tubes developed by Johann Hittorf and William Crookes, Roentgen made his discovery. He repeated and expanded his work and gave the first description of the physical and chemical properties of X-rays. He demonstrated that these rays could penetrate not only glass and air but also other materials, including various metals. However, a thin sheet of lead completely blocked them. Roentgen inferred that the radiation he observed was in fact rays because it traveled in straight lines and created shadows of the type that would be created by rays (Fig. 1.3). While studying the ability of lead to stop the rays, Roentgen held a small piece of this metal between his thumb and index finger and placed it in the path of the rays. He noted that he could distinguish the outline of the two digits on the screen and that the bones appeared as shadows darker than the surrounding soft tissue. Roentgen continued his work over the next weeks, during which he made additional images and showed that the rays darkened a photographic plate. In his manuscript entitled “Uber eine neue Art von Strahlen” (“On a New Kind of Rays”) submitted to the Physikalisch-Medizinische Gesellschaft in Wurzburg on December 28, 1895, he used the term “X-rays” for the first time [5].\n\nRoentgen did not leave any autobiography, so all information regarding people and events which had an influence on his work comes from his biographers. Scientists whose work had greatly influenced Roentgen were the physicist August Kundt (1839–1894), the physicist and mathematician Rudolf Clausius (1822–1888), and the physicist and physician Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (1821–1894), all three of German origin. Of importance is his lifelong friendship with the physicist Ludwig Zehnder who served as Roentgen’s chief assistant and became an occasional co-author.\n\nIt is worth mentioning the relationship between Roentgen and his contemporary German experimental physicist Philipp Lenard (1862–1947), director of the Physical Institute at Heidelberg University. Lenard (Fig. 1.4) first published the results of his experiments on cathode rays in 1894 and was awarded for this the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1905. Prior to Roentgen’s discovery, the two scientists exchanged several letters regarding the aspects of the cathode ray research, and Roentgen referenced Lenard in his initial publications on X-rays and used Lenard’s modified tube for his experiments (Box 1.2).\n\nBox 1.2 Philipp Lenard\n\nPhilipp Lenard (1862–1947) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1905 for “his work on cathode rays.”\n\nHowever, Lenard became extremely embittered by not winning the Prize in 1901. He became one of Adolf Hitler’s most ardent supporters, eventually becoming “Chief of Aryan Physics” under the Nazi regime.\n\nAfter World War II, he was not sentenced (for his prominent role in the Nazi regime) only due to his old age.\n\nHowever, when Roentgen alone was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1901 “in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him,” Lenard became extremely embittered, and for the rest of his life, he insisted that he had shown Roentgen the way to his discovery. Lenard became one of the early adherents of the National Socialism and one of Adolf Hitler’s most ardent supporters, eventually becoming “Chief of Aryan Physics” under the Nazi regime. In 1933, he published a book called “Great Men in Science” in which he failed to mention not only Jews, such as Einstein or Bohr, but also non-Aryans like Marie Skłodowska-Curie and even Roentgen. When World War II ended, Lenard’s prominent role in the Nazi regime led to his arrest, but due to his old age, instead of being sentenced to prison, he was sent to live in a small German village, where he died at the age of 83 [7, 8].\n\nA few months after the discovery of X-rays, radioactivity was described. Antoine-Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) (Fig. 1.5) was a member of a distinguished family of four generations of physicists, all being members of the French Académie des Sciences. Becquerel’s initial research was in phosphorescence, the emission of light of one color following a body’s exposure to the light of another color. In early 1896, following Röntgen’s discovery, Becquerel “began looking for a connection between the phosphorescence he had already been investigating and the newly discovered X-rays” [9] and initially thought that phosphorescent materials, such as some uranium salts, might emit penetrating X-ray-like radiation, but only when illuminated by bright sunlight. By May 1896, after a series of experiments with non-phosphorescent uranium salts, he correctly concluded that the penetrating radiation came from the uranium itself, even without any external excitation. The intensive study of this phenomenon led Becquerel to publish seven papers in 1896 only. Becquerel’s other experiments allowed him to figure out what happened when the “emissions” entered a magnetic field: “When different radioactive substances were put in the magnetic field, they deflected in different directions or not at all, showing that there were three classes of radioactivity: negative, positive, and electrically neutral” [10] (Box 1.3).\n\nBox 1.3 Henri Becquerel\n\nHenri Becquerel (1852–1908) discovered radioactivity in 1896 while studying phosphorescent uranium salts.\n\nLater in the same year, upon experimenting with non-phosphorescent uranium salts, he concluded that the penetrating radiation came from the uranium itself.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.\n\nInterestingly, radioactivity could have been discovered nearly four decades earlier. In 1857, the photographic investor Abel Niépce de Saint-Victor (1805–1870) observed that uranium salts emitted radiation that darkened photographic emulsions. Later in 1861, he realized that uranium salts produced invisible radiation. In 1868, Becquerel’s father Edmond published a book entitled “La lumière: ses causes et ses effets (Light: Its causes and its effects),” where he mentioned that Niépce de Saint-Victor had observed that some phosphorescent objects could expose photographic plates even when unexposed to sunlight. It is known that “gamma rays” emitted from radioactive materials were first observed in 1900 by the French chemist and physicist Paul Ulrich Villard (1860–1934). Villard investigated radiation from radium salts impinging onto a photographic plate from a shielded container through a narrow aperture. He used a thin layer of lead that was already known as alpha-absorber [11]. He was able to show that the remaining radiation consisted of a second and third type of rays. The second type was deflected by a magnetic field similar to the known “canal rays” and could be identified with beta rays described by Ernest Rutherford. The third type, however, was very penetrating and had never been identified before [12]. Being a modest man, he did not suggest a specific name for the type of radiation he had discovered, and in 1903, it was Rutherford who proposed that Villard’s rays should be called gamma rays [13].\n\nIt is of great importance to read the following notes written by Becquerel on 2 March 1896: “I will insist particularly upon the following fact, which seems to me quite important and beyond the phenomena which one could expect to observe: The same crystalline crusts (of potassium uranyl sulfate), arranged the same way with respect to the photographic plates, in the same conditions and through the same screens, but sheltered from the excitation of incident rays and kept in darkness, still produce the same photographic images. Here is how I was led to make this observation: among the preceding experiments, some had been prepared on Wednesday the 26th and Thursday the 27th of February, and since the sun was out only intermittently on these days, I kept the apparatuses prepared and returned the cases to the darkness of a bureau drawer, leaving in place the crusts of the uranium salt. Since the sun did not come out in the following days, I developed the photographic plates on the 1st of March, expecting to find the images very weak. Instead, the silhouettes appeared with great intensity …” Becquerel used an apparatus to show that the radiation he discovered was different from X-rays in the way that the new radiation emitted by radioactive materials was bent by the magnetic field so that the radiation was charged. When different radioactive substances were put in the magnetic field, their radiation was either not deflected or deflected in different directions. Becquerel discovered therefore three classes of radioactivity emitting negative, positive, and electrically neutral particles [14].\n\nA story like that of “Roentgen and Lenard” has developed between “Becquerel and Thompson.” In London, Professor of Physics Silvanus Thompson (1851–1916), the founding President of the Roentgen Society, had been experimenting with uranium nitrate and at the end of January 1896 (a few weeks before Becquerel) found that when the uranium salt was exposed to sunlight while placed on a shielded photographic plate, film blackening appeared beneath the uranium. Thompson delayed writing a communication to the Royal Society and so he lost the paternity of radioactivity!\n\nBecquerel was awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics jointly with Pierre Curie (1859–1906) and Marie Curie (1867–1934) “in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity.” He received one-half of the Prize with the Curies receiving the other half [15].\n\nThe physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) is often credited as the father of nuclear physics. In his early work, he developed the concept of radioactive materials’ half-life; discovered the radioactive element radon; named the radiation types alpha, beta, and gamma; and classified them by their ability to penetrate different materials. The abovementioned experiments were performed at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (Fig. 1.6). In 1903, Rutherford and Frederick Soddy published the “Law of Radioactive Change” to account for all their experiments with radioactive materials.\n\nThough the Curies had already suggested that radioactivity was an intra-atomic phenomenon, the idea of the atoms of radioactive substances breaking up was principally new. Until then, atoms had even been assumed to be indivisible (Greek: a-tom), and it was Rutherford and Soddy who demonstrated that radioactivity involved spontaneous disintegration of “radioactive” atoms into other elements. The results of this work provided the basis for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to Rutherford in 1908 “for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances” [16] (Box 1.4).\n\nBox 1.4 Ernest Rutherford\n\nErnest Rutherford (1871–1937) is known as the father of nuclear physics. He was the first to suggest the existence of nuclei.\n\nHe developed the idea that radioactivity involved spontaneous disintegration of atoms.\n\nIn 1908, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry “for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances.”\n\nPierre Curie (1859–1906) was a French physicist and a pioneer in crystallography and radioactivity. In 1900, he became Professor at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Paris, and in 1903, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics together with his wife Marie (Fig. 1.7), which they shared with Henri Becquerel. Notably, Marie had been Pierre’s assistant at the City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution (ESPCI Paris).\n\nThe term “radioactivity” was coined by Marie Curie, who together with her husband Pierre extracted uranium from pitchblende (uraninite). To their surprise, the leftover ore was more radioactive than pure uranium, and they assumed that other radioactive elements were present in the ore, a hypothesis which resulted in the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium. However, 4 years of processing tons of the uranium ore had to pass before they isolated enough polonium and radium to determine their chemical properties. It should be noted that one ton of pitchblende contains only about 0.15 g of radium.\n\nPierre Curie and his student Albert Laborde discovered nuclear energy by identifying the continuous emission of heat from radium particles. Incidentally, as early as 1913, H. G. Wells coined the term “atomic bomb”—a bomb of unprecedented power based on the use of nuclear energy—appearing in his novel “The World Set Free.” It should be mentioned, however, that “his” atomic bomb had nearly nothing in common with the actual atomic bomb created three decades later.\n\nThe curie (Ci) became the unit of radioactivity, originally named as such by the Radiology Congress in 1910, clearly in honor of Pierre Curie. Corresponding to the activity of about 1 g of radium, the Ci is not a SI unit, and in 1964, it was formally replaced by the becquerel (Bq, this time to honor Henri Becquerel), a SI unit which corresponds to one disintegration per second (Box 1.5).\n\nBox 1.5 Pierre and Marie Curie\n\nPierre Curie (1859–1906) and his wife Marie Salomea Skłodowska-Curie (1867–1934) discovered the elements radium and polonium.\n\nThe term “radioactivity” was coined by Marie Curie.\n\nPierre Curie discovered nuclear energy by identifying the continuous emission of heat from radium particles.\n\nIn 1903, Pierre and Marie Curie were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics (together with H. Becquerel) for the discovery of radioactivity.\n\nIn 1913, H. G. Wells coined the term “atomic bomb” mentioned in his novel “The World Set Free.”\n\nMarie Salomea Skłodowska-Curie, also known as Madame Curie (1867–1934), was a Polish physicist and chemist. She was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize (1903) and the first person to win it twice (1911) in two different scientific fields (physics and chemistry).\n\nIn July 1898, Pierre and Marie Curie published a joint paper announcing the existence of a new element they named “polonium,” and in December of the same year, they proclaimed the existence of another element, “radium.” Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published a total of 32 scientific papers including one on the radiobiological effects of “radium rays” on normal and tumor cells [17]. Noteworthy, Mr. and Mrs. Curie did not patent their discoveries and benefited little from the increasingly profitable application of radium for the therapy of various ailments.\n\nDuring World War I, the radiologist Antoine Béclère persuaded Marie Curie to use X-rays for the diagnosis of wounded soldiers on the front lines. She gave her full support to this project and, using her authority as a Nobel Prize winner, organized the Mobile Radiology Units (Fig. 1.8), 20 of which were installed in the first year of the war. She also designed needles containing “radium emanation” to be used for sterilizing infected tissues.\n\nThe half-life of radium 226 is 1600 years, which is very much shorter than that of uranium (4.5 × 109 years), so radiation of the former is much more intense. Hence, for the study of radioactivity, radium was much more convenient than the very weakly radioactive uranium. The rays emitted by radium proved also to be an excellent tool for exploring the microscopic structure of matter; radium became to be used for this purpose already at the end of 1901 (Box 1.6).\n\nBox 1.6 Maria Salomea Skłodowska-Curie\n\nMarie Salomea Skłodowska-Curie (1867–1934) was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize (1903 in physics) and the first person to win the Nobel Prize twice (1911 in chemistry).\n\nDuring the Great War (WWI), she focused on the use of radiation to diagnose wounded soldiers. She developed and organized mobile X-ray units, 20 of which she installed in the first year of the war.\n\nWhile uranium was the first radioactive element to be discovered, radium was much more popular, as it was a spontaneously luminous material that emitted an incredible quantity of radiation. The popularity of radium is shown in a novel by Maurice Leblanc, “The Island of Thirty Coffins,” published in 1919 where a central role is played by a stone “shivering with radium, from where goes steadily a bombardment of invigorating and miraculous atoms.”\n\nThe research that led to the discovery of radium in 1898 was performed despite considerable difficulties, including inadequate lab and lack of funding. However, Pierre Curie managed to get uranium ore from Bohemia, which at the time belonged to Austria. The help of the Austrian Government, which gave one ton of pitchblende, as well as the help of the chairman of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, was gratefully acknowledged in a letter by Marie Curie, who wrote: “The preparation of radium has been very expensive. We thank the Académie des sciences [...].” After 2 years, however, the Curies became famous, and the situation had improved considerably.\n\nThe collaboration between Pierre and Marie Curie is exemplary in many ways. These two people really complemented each other, as Pierre was dreamy and imaginative, ready to undertake various difficult projects, and Marie was full of energy pursuing her goals. Sadly, Marie Curie died at the Sancellemoz Sanatorium in Passy (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anemia, presumably from exposure to radiation during her scientific research, compounded by her exposure to X-rays in the field radiology units during World War I.\n\nImmediately after the discovery of radium and polonium by Marie and Pierre Curie, the latter examined the possibility to use radium as a powerful therapeutic tool [18, 19]. First successful results were obtained in patients with lupus vulgaris, a form of tuberculosis of the skin. For patients with lesions situated in deeper organs, radium salts were used. In 1904, John MacLeod at Charing Cross Hospital designed one of the first glass radium applicators to treat throat cancer [20], and in 1917, Benjamin Barringer used needles containing radium salts for treating prostate cancer [21]. After World War I, a number of technological devices were proposed to treat a wide spectrum of tumors. This therapeutic approach was initially called curietherapy in Europe and brachytherapy in the USA [22].\n\nAlong with the first medical applications of X-rays or radium, the first radiation-induced tissue reactions were also observed. In the first decade of the nineteenth century, three major applications of X-rays were developed, namely radiography and radiotherapy, mainly against skin diseases such as lupus rather than cancers, as well as radiation-induced hair removal. From a number of these applications, numerous adverse tissue reactions directly due to radiation have been described. In this period, the term “radiodermatitis” was proposed [2]. In 1906, the participants of a Congress of Radiologists organized in Lyon (France) concluded that some patients may show some unexpected skin reactions probably due to radiation [23]. In 1911, the radiologist Léon Bouchacourt, based on the results of the application of radiation treatment for hypertrichosis to a couple of young people, published a paper with a premonitory title: “About the sensitivity to Roentgen Rays of the skin of different individuals and, for a given individual, of the different part of the body” [24, 25]. In this paper, Bouchacourt suggested not only that each individual may show a specific sensitivity to radiation but also that some tissues/organs may be characterized by a specific response to radiation [2]. It is clear that the radiation-induced adverse tissue reactions were documented very early and that the notion of individual radiosensitivity is an old concept [25].\n\n1.2.2 Recognition of the Acute Injury\n\nThe toxicity of X-rays became apparent soon after their discovery by Roentgen (Fig. 1.9). Hair loss has been recognized by May 1896, and skin toxicity was noted a few months later. Early X-ray images required exposures of as long as 80 min, and thus early X-ray workers were among the most severely affected. Dr. Hall-Edwards, the British physician responsible for the first clinical X-ray “photograph” in England in early 1896, developed cancer of the hands from radiation exposure incurred while holding patients’ extremities on photographic plates. In 1896, a commercial demonstrator at Bloomingdale Brothers store in New York, whose X-ray machine ran continuously for 2–3 h a day, reported the development of dry skin, followed by changes like a strong sunburn and later scaliness of the skin. He also noted the cessation of fingernail growth and loss of hair from the involved portions of the skin (Box 1.7).\n\nBox 1.7 Radiation Poisoning\n\nAcute radiation effects (radiodermatitis. etc.) were observed almost immediately after the discovery of ionizing radiation.\n\nIn spite of this, the so-called mild radium therapy was extensively misused.\n\nBy chance, Roentgen had conducted virtually all his experiments in a zinc box, which gave better definition of the X-ray beam. He had also added a lead plate to the zinc and thus, fortuitously, protected himself from the radiation that he discovered [5]. In 1902, Guido Holzknecht (1872–1931) devised a color dosimeter (“chromoradiometer”) based on the discoloration of crystals after exposing them to X-rays. Holzknecht, like a number of other physicians in the early days of radiology, died from the consequences of radiation “poisoning,” and his name is displayed on the Monument in honor of the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations erected in Hamburg, Germany [27].\n\nHowever, these injuries were not initially attributed to X-ray exposures. Nevertheless, formal action to protect from the harmful effects of radiation was required, and in March 1898, a Committee of Inquiry was established by the British Roentgen Society to “investigate the alleged injurious effects of Roentgen rays” [28]. The Committee mentioned explicitly the known adverse effects: skin inflammation, loss of hair, and more it urged collecting information on various effects of X-rays.\n\nRight from the first days of the use of radiation, the press reported on the death of “radiological” personnel from cancer, and so European countries and the USA established radiation protection Committees [29]. In 1925, the “First International Congress of Radiology” was organized in London, and it was decided to establish the “International X-ray Unit Committee.” Hence, the ancestor of the “International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU)” was born [30, 31].\n\nExposure to radium also caused acute injuries. Two incidents are worth mentioning. The first cases of radium “poisoning” were recorded among girls painting the luminous watch dials in the Radium Luminous Materials Company, New Jersey, USA (“the radium girls”). The luminous paint was a mixture of radium salts with zinc sulfide. The workers swallowed and inhaled the paint, and this resulted in the death of 18 out of 800 employed workers between 1917 and 1924 [32]. The causes of death were either cancer (probably osteosarcoma of the jaw) or aplastic anemia, necrosis of the jaw, and spontaneous fractures [33, 34]. But it was the death of the wealthy American iron and steel industrialist Eben Byers in 1932 which put an end to the so-called mild radium therapy. His death was attributed to the enormous quantities of Radithor (Fig. 1.10) that he had consumed. Radithor, produced in the Bailey Radium Laboratories in New Jersey and advertised in the newspapers as “Science to cure all the living dead,” was commercially available in the USA. Each bottle contained 1 μCi of 226Ra and 1 μCi of 228Ra in 16.5 mL of liquid. Byers started drinking Radithor in 1927 and stopped by 1930 when his teeth started to fall out (it was estimated that he had emptied between 1000 and 1500 bottles). Eventually, he died from sarcoma of the upper and lower jaws [35]. This event was probably the reason why the era of the “mild radium therapy” came to an end [36] (Box 1.8).\n\nBox 1.8 Radium Misuse\n\nRadium was extensively misused before World War II via consumption of various radium-containing products.\n\nThe first cases of radium “poisoning” were recorded among the “radium girls” painting the luminous watch dials.\n\nThe death of the American millionaire Eben Byers in 1932 seems to be the event that ultimately led to cessation of radium misuse.\n\n1.2.3 The Law of Bergonié and Tribondeau\n\nThe so-called fundamental Law of Bergonié and Tribondeau put forward in 1906 postulated that normal tissues appear to be more radiosensitive if their cells are less differentiated, have a greater proliferative capacity, and divide more rapidly. Various data suggest that this law applies to tumors as well.\n\nHeinrich Ernst Albers-Schönberg, Jean Alban Bergonié, Claudius Regaud, and Louis Tribondeau made significant contributions to our knowledge of the biological effects of ionizing radiation. Between 1895 and 1908, they studied histological features of irradiated gonads in numerous animal models. Although the law of Bergonié and Tribondeau that links radiosensitivity with proliferation is not generally applicable, the enormous efforts these scientists made to fight cancer by using ionizing radiation should be acknowledged (Box 1.9).\n\nBox 1.9 The Law of Bergonié and Tribondeau\n\nThe “law of Bergonié and Tribondeau” was formulated in 1906 and postulated that normal tissues appear to be more radiosensitive if their cells are less differentiated, have a greater proliferative capacity, and divide more rapidly.\n\nThe law of Bergonié and Tribondeau has not been verified. However, it has facilitated the advances in radiation biology and understanding of the relationship between cell proliferation and tissue radiosensitivity.\n\nIn 1906, Jean Bergonié and Louis Tribondeau published a communication to the French Academy of Sciences about the link between cellular proliferation and response to radiation. According to Bergonié and Tribondeau [37], “X rays act on cells inasmuch efficiently as cells have a greater reproductive activity, their karyokinetic fate is longer, their morphology and function are at least definitively fixed.” While they never used the term “radiosensitivity,” this article has with time been read as “cells are inasmuch radiosensitive as they grow fastly” and is still considered as a founding law of radiation oncology. Today, however, there is evidence that this “law” can be contradicted by numerous counterexamples. An epistemological analysis of the archives of Claudius Regaud, another pioneer of radiation biology and a contemporary of Bergonié and Tribondeau, sheds new light on this law [38]. Let us now briefly review some important facts about the life and work of these three French scientists.\n\nJean Alban Bergonié (1857–1925) (Fig. 1.11) was a physicist and a medical doctor. His expertise in the two areas allowed him to use electrical currents in medical therapy and to develop many new devices based on the discovery of X-rays and radium. In 1911, because of his hitherto intense use of X-rays in the therapy of patients, he developed dermatitis on the right index, and in 1922, his hand (and thereafter his arm) was amputated. Ultimately, he died from lung cancer in 1925 [39]. Of note, Bergonié funded the Journal Archives d’Électricité Médicale where he wrote that X-rays were discovered “simply thanks to the invention of the Crookes tube some 15 years earlier” [39]. In 1906, he expressed the opinion that “there are two error types that may affect the medical application of X-rays: (1) the uncertainties in the assessment of radiation dose, … and (2) the differences in the sensitivity of the patients” [23].\n\nLouis Tribondeau (1872–1918) (Fig. 1.11) was born in Sète in Southern France and in 1890 joined the Health Corps of the French Navy. Tribondeau was one of the first histologists who described the microscopic features of tuberculous epididymitis. But he became famous thanks to his staining techniques for bacteriology. In 1918, he died from the Spanish flu [39].\n\nBorn in Lyon, France, Claudius Regaud (1870–1940) (Fig. 1.11) studied medicine in Lyon and attended the microbiology lectures at the Pasteur Institute [40]. In 1893, he worked in Lyon in the laboratory of Joseph Renaut, an eminent histologist, known for his staining technique based on mercury. In Renaut’s laboratory, Regaud improved the staining technique of Ehrlich (methylene blue) and developed his own staining method based on ferric hematoxylin, which reveals mitochondria and cytoplasm [40,41,42]. In 1912, Regaud became head of the Biology Section of the new Radium Institute of Paris, where Marie Curie headed the Physics Section. During World War I, he served as head of an Army Hospital. Not only did he organize the emergency services very effectively, but he also managed multidisciplinary meetings between surgeons, radiologists, hygienists, nurses, and other staff. From 1918 until 1939, he treated thousands of cancer patients and developed a method of fractionated radiotherapy. He died of pneumonia in December 1940 [40].\n\nOn August 5, 1895, Regaud presented the new improvements on his staining technique at the Congress of Neurology in Bordeaux [41]. Tribondeau and Bergoni also attended the sessions and had probably read the papers by Regaud in which the histology of the rodent reproductive system was described in detail based on his new staining technique.\n\nAfter the discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in December 1895, two German scientists, H. E. Albers-Schönberg and H. Frieben, began to study the effects of this type of radiation on spermatogenesis by irradiating testicles of rabbits and guinea pigs [39, 43, 44]. In Bordeaux, Bergonié undertook to reproduce the experiments of the two Germans. As a physicist, he was able to build irradiation devices but, owing to his limited knowledge of histology, he asked Tribondeau for his technical savoir faire [39]. Between 1904 and 1905, Bergonié and Tribondeau published their first observations about irradiated testicles of rats having used Regaud’s staining technique [45]. They emphasized the role of spermatogonia as pluripotent cells and as the most radiosensitive cells of the reproductive system. However, since the experiments involved irradiation with X-rays, interpretation of the data remained ambiguous.\n\nRegaud realized that there might be misinterpretations of his own technique. Unlike Bergonié, Regaud was a histologist and not a physicist and was helped by Thomas Nogier, a specialist in medical physics. Regaud and Nogier replicated the experiments of Bergonié and Tribondeau using rat models, single exposures, and Regaud’s staining technique [46]. In 1908, Regaud claimed that in young rats, spermatogonia are less radiosensitive than in the adult animals although proliferation rates of these cells are similar in the two groups of rats [47]. However, according to Regaud and Lacassagne [48], Bergonié and Tribondeau generalizations were “imprudently” based on the studies of rat testes. In 1925, Regaud did not hesitate to write about the law of Bergonié and the Tribondeau-Bergonié’s eulogy that “Actual law as so many people believe it? No. But nice formula of the first approximation” [49].\n\nThese days, several oncology lectures still cite Bergonié and Tribondeau’s law as a founding principle of radiotherapy according to which tumors are more radiosensitive than healthy tissues due to the higher proliferation rate of the former. In this erroneous claim, three kinds of errors were made:\n\n1.\n\nTumors are not necessarily more radiosensitive than normal tissues.\n\n2.\n\nProliferation rate is not necessarily correlated with the cellular death rate after irradiation.\n\n3.\n\nRadiosensitivity and cancer susceptibility to irradiation are two different notions [50].\n\nThe link between proliferation rate and radiosensitivity is far from obvious, and the law of Bergonié and Tribondeau should have been modified as follows: “the faster cells proliferate, the faster cell death will appear.” Besides, reviews about the Tpot (the potential doubling time parameter) have shown that the yield of cell death clearly does not correlate with proliferation rate [51, 52]. For example, fibroblasts from ataxia telangiectasia are hyper-radiosensitive, while their proliferation rate is lower than that of fibroblasts from healthy patients [53]. When fibroblasts are transformed by the Simian Virus 40 (SV40), the cells become unstable and their proliferation rate increases while they are less radiosensitive than their non-transformed counterparts [54]. Other counterexamples of the law of Bergonié and Tribondeau are as follows: the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (caused by the p53+/− mutations) confers radioresistance associated, however, with impaired cell cycle arrests, instability, and cancer proneness. Similarly, some highly proliferating tumors may be very radioresistant [55].\n\nTo conclude, despite its popularity, the law of Bergonié and Tribondeau has not been fully validated. Yet, it has made a significant contribution to the advances in radiation biology and the relationship between proliferation and radiosensitivity.\n\n1.2.4 Early Optimism and Pessimism\n\nThe report of the discovery of “mysterious rays” (X meaning unknown) created a great sensation and spread rapidly in many countries: The first report in the press of Roentgen’s feat appeared in Vienna on January 5, 1896, and days later in Germany, England, and the USA [56]. Of all the properties of X-rays, their ability to make the “invisible visible” was the most fascinating and remained for several years the principal topic for their use in the imaging of anatomical and technical objects (Fig. 1.12).\n\nThe first X-ray machines were large, loud, sparkling, and smelly devices, prone to causing accidents and injury. Such bizarre and sometimes mind-boggling presentations solidified the current public perception of X-rays as a fantastically powerful and yet controversially useful tool. As one of the symbols of the new scientific medicine, X-rays have largely lived up to the public’s expectations of a technological panacea, which was reinforced by the spectacle of their generation and their undeniable effects on the body. This “domestication” of X-ray machines highlighted their failure as modern heroic medicine, while reinforcing at the same time the emerging understanding of radiation as a “subtle, cumulative, and insidious threat” [57, 58] (Box 1.10).\n\nBox 1.10 X-rays Sensation\n\nThe report of the discovery of “mysterious rays” created a great sensation and spread rapidly in many countries.\n\nAs one of the icons of the new scientific medicine, X-rays bore much of the public’s expectations for a technological panacea.\n\nIn addition to the discovery of X-rays, the year 1895 also saw the death of Louis Pasteur. After a plethora of controversies, the “microbial” theory developed by Pasteur triumphed at the end of the nineteenth century to such an extent that nearly all the diseases were believed to originate from a microbial etiology [59]. This was also the case with cancer, a disease that was already well known, but much less frequent than tuberculosis or diphtheria. The so-called parasitic theory of cancer suggested that tumors arise as a result of infection of tissues by microorganisms. This theory opposed the “cellular” theory, which explained carcinogenesis as due to the transformation of one or more cells. Hence, early after the discovery of X-rays, the first experiments involving both X-rays and microbes revealed the biocidal properties of X-rays [60].\n\nIn this historical context, Victor Despeignes, a hygienist and physician in a village of Savoy, Les Echelles, France, in February 1896 was visited by a man of 52, who suffered from pain in his abdomen [3, 60] and had been diagnosed with stomach cancer. Convinced by the works of his former colleagues of the Medical Faculty of Lyon, who in March 1896 demonstrated the curative effects of X-rays in patients with tuberculosis [61], in July 1896, Despeignes performed the first anticancer radiotherapeutic trial by irradiating his patient’s tumor with X-rays in two daily sessions. However, although the therapy led to a significant decrease of the tumor volume, the patient died 22 days after the beginning of the treatment. Despeignes described all these observations in two articles in the Lyon Medical Journal [3, 60, 62,63,−64]. The reconstitution of the radiotherapy of Despeignes suggested that his patient did not suffer from a stomach cancer, a rather radioresistant neoplasm, but from gastric lymphoma, possibly the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of a high-grade Burkitt type, which is very radiosensitive. Unfortunately, following the opposition or reservations of his colleagues vis-à-vis the therapeutic properties of X-rays, Despeignes discontinued further trials with X-rays [3, 60].\n\nEmil Grubbe (1875–1960), who received his medical degree in 1898, was allegedly the first American to use X-rays as a treatment for cancer. According to his own report, on January 26, 1896, he treated in Chicago a woman with breast cancer and, the following day, a man suffering from ulcerating lupus [65]. However, the validity of these statements remains questionable for many reasons. Firstly, no death certificates or medical records of Grubbe’s patients have been found. Secondly, these treatments were not described in any peer-reviewed publications. Grubbe did not describe any clinical features potentially resulting from these treatments [65].\n\nIn August 1896, Leonhard Voigt irradiated in Germany a cancer of the nasopharynx, but, as in Grubbe’s case, the records of this treatment cannot be validated [65]. The first radiation treatment considered to be successful was given in 1897 in Germany by Eduard L. Schiff to a patient suffering from erythematous lupus [66, 67]. While the X-rays generated by the Crookes tubes manufactured in the first two decades of the twentieth century were too “soft” to fully permeate the tumorous tissue, the later technological advances permitted Claudius Regaud and Antoine Lacassagne to perform in the 1930s the first series of anticancer radiotherapy at the Curie Institute in Paris, France [2] (Box 1.11).\n\nBox 1.11 Radiology\n\nCounterintuitively for the modern reader, ionizing radiation was initially used mostly for treatment rather than for diagnosis.\n\nDevelopment of diagnostic radiology remained slow till the outbreak of the Great War (WWI) in 1914.\n\nThe development of diagnostic radiology remained slow until about 1914, when two incidents precipitated its growth: the invention in 1913 of a new type of the cathode tube by the American physicist W. D. Coolidge (1873–1975) and the beginning of the Great War (World War I) associated with the need for medical assistance to the wounded soldiers.\n\nBeginning from the 1920s, X-rays were used regularly for the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis. Before that, the “radiologists” were almost no more than “photographers.” “Thanks to” tuberculosis, the “photographers” became skilled diagnosticians and thus the medical specialty of radiology emerged. Noteworthy, the Roentgen Society founded in London in November 1897 was in 1927 renamed the British Institute of Radiology; in 1931, the section of Radiology was established at the Royal Society of Medicine; and in 1934, the British Association of Radiologists was founded (5 years later, it was renamed the Faculty of Radiologists).\n\nAt that period, radiology was faced with two problems: First, physicians regarded radiology as an intruder in their territory and contrasted the “dead photograph” with the “living sound” of auscultation, and second, the images obtained were of poor quality because all the anatomical structures were superimposed. To overcome this latter problem, B. G. Ziedses des Plantes (1902–1933) built the first machine for planigraphy, in which the X-ray tube and the film moved together around the plane of interest allowing to reconstruct an arbitrary number of planes from a set of projections. He also designed the subtraction method to improve images after the injection of contrast agents [68].\n\nThe history of radiation therapy (radiotherapy) can be traced back to experiments made just after the discovery of X-rays, when it was shown that exposure to ionizing radiation may lead to cutaneous burns. In 1902, several physicians began the systematic use of radiation for the treatment of malignant tumors. The increased use of electrotherapy and escharotics (the medical application of caustic substances) inspired doctors to use radiation for the treatment of nearly any disease—lupus, basal cell carcinoma, epithelioma, tuberculosis, arthritis, pneumonia, and chronic ear infections (https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/nri/patientinfo.htm; [4, 69, 70]). Active use of ionizing radiation for treatment of various diseases continued until the early 1960s. Since then, radiation therapy has been used nearly exclusively in cancer therapy. Two factors contributed to phasing out of radiotherapy for non-oncological purposes: the growing awareness of the radiation-induced carcinogenesis and the development of efficient drugs, primarily, antibiotics (Box 1.12).\n\nBox 1.12 Radiation Therapy\n\nIonizing radiation was successfully used for the treatment of numerous diseases until the early 1960s.\n\nSince then, radiation therapy has been used almost exclusively in cancer therapy.\n\nTwo factors contributed to phasing out of radiotherapy for non-oncological purposes: the growing awareness of the radiation-associated carcinogenesis and the development of efficient drugs.\n\nUntil 1920, patients with cancer were treated mainly by surgeons who assumed that the mechanism of radioactivity involved a “caustic effect.” At that time, when the sources of X-rays produced “weak” radiation, capable of only superficial penetration, it was logical that it was dermatologists who strived to use X-rays in therapy. The crucial experiments performed by Robert Kienböck (1871–1953) entailed the proof that an X-ray dose, rather than electric phenomena, was the active agent causing biological effects when “illuminating the skin using Roentgen tubes” [71].\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, radiobiology was at its infancy, based mainly on empirical observations of the effects of radiation on the skin. The technical progress made with the Coolidge tubes and the higher voltage that these tubes could be operated with introduced the techniques of the “deep X-ray treatment.” The first radiotherapy textbook titled “Treatment of Cancer by Radium” was authored by surgeon Sir Stanford Cade and appeared in 1928 [72].\n\nAt the same time, the Scottish radiotherapist Ralston Paterson (1897–1981) who used X-rays for the treatment of lung cancer wrote, “In cases of true primary carcinoma of the lung, surgery as yet offers little hope of relief … A group of nineteen patients treated by high-voltage roentgen rays is reported. All died within ten months, all but three within four months. This brief period of survival is the same as that in a group of cases in which there was no treatment. Although life is not prolonged, roentgen-ray treatment in all, but advanced cases give marked temporary palliation” [73].\n\nIn 1929, the pioneer Swedish radiotherapist Gösta Forssell (1876–1950) delivered the tenth Mackenzie Davidson Memorial Lecture and summarized the current state of radiotherapy [74, 75]. Figure 1.13 shows a table from Forssell’s summary.\n\nIn 1896, less than a year after the discovery of X-rays, Walter Levitt wrote on modern developments in X-ray therapeutic techniques and stressed that it is Leopold Freund from Vienna to whom “belongs the credit of having carried out the first X-ray treatment.” Freund had noticed that epilation was one of the most constant effects of the exposure to X-rays, and when a patient with a hairy mole on the face came to him for advice, he conceived the idea of treating it with X-rays [76].\n\nAt about the same time, Robert McWhirter from Edinburgh wrote on the radiosensitivity in relation to radiation intensity. Frank Ellis from the Sheffield National Radium Centre during his long life (1905–2006) also contributed to the development of radiotherap; in June 1939, he reported on the radiosensitivity of malignant melanoma [77, 78]. Other publications of this period on the use of radium include illustrations of masks holding the radium needles applied to the skin (Fig. 1.14) and tubes containing radium for the internal use in cervical cancer [79].\n\nConcurrently, the late effects of radiation on the skin were studied and reported in detail, and plastic surgery was applied to the treatment of radiodermatitis and radionecrosis [26, 80]."
