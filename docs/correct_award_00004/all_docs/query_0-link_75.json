His X-rays have continued to transform fields from astronomy to cell biochemistry. An upcoming highlight in the area of X-ray research is the European X-ray laser facility in Hamburg. The research apparatus will emit ultra-short high-energy X-ray pulses to give new insights into the tiniest of biological particles."
