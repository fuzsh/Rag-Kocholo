        "text": "The German physicist, Wilhelm Röntgen was the first Nobel recipient in Physics. He was awarded Nobel Prize in the year 1901 for his remarkable achievement in discovering X-rays.\n\nBorn on 27th March 1845, in Germany, Röntgen was the first person to systematically produce and detect electromagnetic radiation in a wavelength range today known as X-rays. Röntgen is considered the father of diagnostic radiology.\n\nTo highlight the unknown nature of his discovery, he called them X-rays, though they are still known as Roentgen-rays as well.\n\nHe took the very first picture using X-rays of his wife Anna Bertha’s hand. When she saw her skeleton she exclaimed “I have seen my death!”"
