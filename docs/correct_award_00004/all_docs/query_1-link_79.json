        "text": "He started to gather manuscripts from the House of Scholars very secretly. He then experimented in the tunnel that was secret, only his friend and himself knew. The experiments that he did in the tunnel lead to the discovery of the light bulb. He wanted to present his idea to the Council of Scholars but they didn’t like the idea for multiple reasons. He did not belong the the House Scholars, ideas that that are individually created don’t exist, and many other scholars came up with ideas that were also\n\n1895 – X-rays were discovered accidentally by physicist Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen. Rontgen was working on a experiment and testing whether cathode rays could pass through glass. He noticed that a nearby tube emitted fluorescent glow of crystals. The air in the tube was released, high voltage applied, the same tube emitted a fluorescent glow. When Rontgen covered the tube in a heavy black paper, a green light could be seen. He concluded that a new light ray was being broadcast. Rontgen discovered that the light was very powerful and the same ray could pass through human tissue, but not through bones and metal objects. Medical applications were soon to follow. (\"History of radiography,\" )\n\nHe always took a scientific approach to everything but he didn 't see it as such. He wasn 't aware the he was inventing. He was just trying to figure out solutions to his problems. During His first experiment he didn 't even realize that he would be labeled as an inventor. Again, he was just finding a solution to anything that\n\nWhen this problem was brought to the attention of a certain French scientist and mathematician, Blaise Pascal, he and Otto von Guericke did several experiments with suction which eventually led to the discovery of the vacuum. This discovery of the vacuum led to the discovery of something we live with every single day, electricity. The discovery of electricity was due to another French astronomer, Jean Picard, who was carrying a mercury-filled barometer back to his observatory. What is now known as “Barometric light” was the astounding glow that was coming from the barometer as Jean Picard was carrying it, he later discovers it was his hand rubbing against the glass that had caused such a reaction to happen within the tube. This discovery had taken europe by storm as an “Electricity Craze” spread across europe as well, giving birth to many early static electricity machines to see what it could do to the human body. Further investigation into the abilities of electricity led to the first known battery, consisting of wires, metal tools, and a jar of water, which they learned had the properties to hold an electrical\n\nX-rays were discovered by accident in 1895 by the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen. Roentgen was already an accomplished scientist with forty-eight published papers. He had a reputation among the scientific community as a dedicated scientist with precise experimental methods. Roentgen had been conducting experiments at the University of Wurzburg on the effect of cathode-rays on the luminescence of certain chemicals. Roentgen had placed a cathode-ray tube, which is a partially evacuated glass tube with metal electrodes at each end, in a black cardboard box in his darkened laboratory. He sent electricity through the cathodre-ray tube and noticed something strange his laboratory. He saw a flash of light\n\nRontgen was born on March 27, 1845. Wilhelm was a German Physicist. He was also the first person to detect electromagnetic radiation in a wavelength range, today known as x-rays. Rontgen earned the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society of London in 1896 and the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901. People also know him for his discoveries such as electricity, mechanics, and heat.Rontgen was born on March 27, 1845. Wilhelm was a German Physicist.

Today is the day I will receive a Nobel Prize. It's not only me who is being awarded this prestigious prize. My husband, Pierre Curie, and my colleague, Antoine-Henri Becquerel, are sharing this prize with me as well. Sadly, my husband or I cannot attend due to the fact that we are too sick.\n\nHe discovered X-rays by taking a fluorescent light bulb tube, removing all of the air, and then filling it with a special gas. He then passes high electric voltage through this tube making it give off a fluorescent glow. Roentgen then covered the tube with black paper ran the same electrical current through it. He noticed a barium coated screen across the lab glowing. Realizing that the tube was emitting invisible light or a ray, and the ray could pass through most objects he ran more experiments. He named with new ray “X-ray” because in math X is used to indicate an unknown quantity. Roentgen then went on to receive the first Nobel Prize in physics in\n\nAs part of his work on EM wave he reported a sensation that could change the understanding of our universe. Hertz would show a UV light on electrically charged metal. He noticed that the UV light would make the metal’s charge fall quicker than normal. He wrote a book about this experiment and gave it away to any scientist who deemed themselves worth for the task because he was too busy with his EM wave project at the time of his new discovery. J. J. Thompson discovered that the UV light produced electrons from the metal. This discovery caused Albert Einstein to rethink his theory of light. He finalized that light came in completely separate parts of energy that is called photons. This discovery of the photoelectric effect was one of the key parts in making a new way of explaining the atomic\n\nWilhelm Conrad Rontgen was born on March 27, 1845 in Lennep, Prussia; which is now Remscheid, Germany. His family moved to Apeldoorn in the Netherlands, where we went to Institute of Martinus Herman van Doorn, a boarding school. He did not show any special aptitude, but he had a fascination with nature and loved roaming the countryside and walking through forests. Later he attended a technical school in Utrecht, but unfortunately was unfairly expelled for allegedly drawing a rude caricature of one of the teachers, which was in fact drawn by another student. He then entered the University of Utrecht in 1865 to study physics. He did not have the required credentials to enter the University, but he heard he could enter by passing an exam. He"
