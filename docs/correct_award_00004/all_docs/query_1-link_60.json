        "text": "Wilhelm Roentgen received the first Nobel Prize in physics in 1901 for his discovery of X-rays in 1895. Roentgen was studying cathode rays (which we now know as electrons.) He had a cathode tube wrapped in black paper and noticed that a nearby screen was fluorescing. Roentgen realized he was seeing some sort of unknown X radiation that could pass through materials that absorb visible light. His discovery revolutionized physics and medicine."
