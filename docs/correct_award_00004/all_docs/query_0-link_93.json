        "text": "1. The inventor of X-Ray\n\n2. Biography His Work The Nobel Prize The X-Ray Utility\n\n3. Life : 27 March 1845 - 10 February 1923. Origin : Born in Lennep in Lower Rhine Province of Germany. Died at Munich (from carcinoma of the intestine). Education : Institute of Martinus Herman van Doorn(Boarding school), Technical school at Utrecht. He was expelled from the school with unfair reason. He was accused for making a caricature of the teachers. University of Utrecht, studying physics. He then moved to Polutechnic at Zurich as machanical engineering. Life after college: in 1900 he accepted it in the University of Munich, by special request of the Bavarian government, as successor of E. Lommel. Marriage life: married Anna Bertha Ludwing of Zurich, in 1872. Had no children. Adopted Josephine Bertha Ludwig.\n\n4. In 1874 - became a lecturer at Strasbourg University In 1875 - became a professor at the Academy of Agriculture In 1876 - returned to Strasbourg as a professor of physics In 1879 - appointed to the chair of physics at the University of Giessen In 1888 - obtained the physics chair at the University of Würzburg In 1900 - obtained the physics chair at the University of Munich\n\n5. In 1896 – Received Rumford Medal In 1896 – Received Matteucci Medal In 1901 – Received Nobel Prize for Physics In 2004 – Received IUPAC named element number 111 roentgenium (Rg) in his honour.\n\n6. In 1901 Röntgen was awarded the very first Nobel Prize in Physics. The award was officially &quot;in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him&quot;. Röntgen donated the monetary reward from his Nobel Prize to his university.\n\n7. X-rays is the ray that penetrates some substances more easily than others, and also fogged photographic plates. The fact that X-rays could produce images differentiating between the densities of body tissues, produced results which medical enthusiasts for 'the new light' were keen to exploit. X-rays were also used to treat tumours.\n\n9. Examination of Baggage in Airports Industrial Use Medical Use\n\n10. The use of X-rays in airports to examine for the presence of dangerous weapons or bombs is a routine practice. The cargo is also examined similarly for illegal transit of goods.\n\n11. X-rays reveal structural information about the material through which it passes or falls over. It can therefore be used to detect structural deficits or cracks in metal objects that are likely to be missed by the human eye. It is also used to reveal stress related changes in building materials for bridges and aircrafts.\n\n12. X-rays are widely used in medicine to reveal the architecture of the bone and other soft tissues and to find out any abnormality in the form of fracture, growth of tumor etc. It is also used in dental imaging.\n\n13.
