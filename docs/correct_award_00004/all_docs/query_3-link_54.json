        "meta_description": "THE Nobel Prize for Physics, for the year 1948, has been awarded to Prof. P. M. S. Blackett, of the University of Manchester. The most important of Blackett‘s contributions to experimental physics have been made with the Wilson expansion chamber. After the discovery of the artificial transmutation of some of the light elements by Rutherford in 1919, it became important to make a detailed study of individual disintegrations, and this could only be done with the Wilson chamber. In order to observe the transmutation of a nitrogen nucleus, it was necessary, however, to consider making many thousands of photographs. For this purpose, Blackett developed the automatic expansion chamber. The successful design and operation of this elaborate instrument, in which the many operations involved in taking a single photograph were made mechanically, in an ordered sequence many times repeated, represented a technical achievement of the highest order. With this instrument, Blackett secured the classical photographs, now familiar to many generations of physics students, showing the disintegration of nitrogen by fast α-particles ; and many other examples of nuclear processes.",
