        "text": "It’s been quiet without Will Self, hasn’t it? I fear some younger readers may not even know the novelist and contrarian once notorious for snorting heroin on then prime minister John Major’s plane. In the Nineties and Noughties he wrote at a terrific rate — nine books in seven years, as well as profiles, commentary and columns (including a regular one for this newspaper). He was a restaurant reviewer, a gobby Newsnight and Question Time guest; he made documentaries for the BBC and Channel 4. He was the hulking public intellectual who also dabbled in light entertainment (remember Shooting Stars with Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer?). For a while, life was pretty much wall-to-wall Will Self.\n\nThen he receded. Absent from Twitter, barely on telly, a mere muffle on the radio. Why? “It behoves middle-aged white men to shut up,” he says. “I questioned my right to that much space in the public arena. What is questioned [today] is white, middle-class patriarchal hegemony. So what’s the obvious response?” He presses his lips firmly together, then gestures a sharp zip. Had he kept to this, of course, the interview would now be over. But this is Will Self.\n\nAnd so for two hours the 57-year-old talks in his north London gravedigger’s drawl about — among other things — his 22-year-long heroin addiction, his mental health issues and his forthcoming memoir, which comprises “five episodes from my life from between 17 and 25, written in the third person with a character with my name”.\n\nBut when he opens his notebook and begins to read, I question his definition of “date”. He cackles: “You are about to transition and become a member of the opposite sex — for a split second. The father or mother of your unborn child is in the restaurant right now — but the child will never be conceived.” He cackles again. Actually, my favourite he stole from a Sam Freeberg sketch: “Help! I’m being held prisoner in a fortune cookie factory.”\n\n“Maybe a couple who weren’t getting on so well — either an established or a new couple — will find some common ground in the humour,” he says. “I don’t view myself as the Irma Kurtz of cookie-writing but I am trying to shatter the tension of the moment.”\n\nConversely, Self generates tension when it comes to our own lunch. As the waitress arrives with a menu he says “I don’t eat lunch,” and instead sips oolong tea, his large features, like hand-moulded clay, caught in the ghoulish beam of a spotlight. Twice he mauls me over questions. He asks if I am “scrupulous” when I ask about his divorce from the writer Deborah Orr. I remind him that he too once did interviews, and would’ve asked the same. His anger is a thunderclap.\n\nOn other subjects he is extravagantly open — his childhood in north London, where he grew up with an American mother, who died of cancer (“a very good writer but really frustrated”), an academic father who left when he was small, and two older brothers, Nick (a half-brother lives in the US) and Jonathan (whom he no longer speaks to).\n\nHe calls the Sixties and Seventies “innocent” with a grimace because, “people were so innocent and naive about the s**t everyone got up to.” He means not just infidelity (“my impression is people are much less tolerant of that and more concerned to develop relationships that are genuinely egalitarian and communicative”) but dark pockets of immorality and amorality that existed in normal society somehow without acknowledgement. He calls these “the voids”.\n\n“How else do you explain [the fact that] I was a f***king heroin addict when I was 17? I was upstairs in my bedroom sticking a needle loaded with amphetamine in my arm. My parents were quite nice, conscientious people in their way. They were a bit f**ked up but…” he shrugs, as if to say, “not enough to miss it.”\n\nAnd then he casually reveals that one of those “voids” was at his school, University College School in Hampstead, and what “emerged” was one of his teachers saying: “‘Can I put my hand on your cock?’ and, ‘Yeah, I am going to put my hand on your cock.’ There was vast amount of it,” he says.\n\nHis brother Jonathan has said he experienced abuse from two teachers at the same school. Will names a third (but asks me not to include it here). He says this teacher, “would put his hands down our shorts to check if we were wearing pants because we weren’t allowed to wear pants under our rugby shorts. So he would cop a feel of every single boy in the class, every day we went onto the pitch.” With this occurring in “a void”, Self says, the boys didn’t know how to respond. “It was just like, ‘fine’. It was just ‘a thing’.”\n\nSelf went on to Oxford, read PPE and blitzed on drugs. He was a contemporary of Edward St Aubyn, the writer recently played by Benedict Cumberbatch in Patrick Melrose, the adaptation of his books. I ask if they were friends and Self is curt: “Wait, is this an interview about Teddy St Aubyn?”\n\nBut then he continues: “Teddy was derelict — going to NY and getting loaded on smack and coke. I wrote every single essay throughout my entire undergraduate career — two essays a week. I did a lot of drugs but I was a good middle-class boy, not a dissolute aristocrat with a trust fund worth eight million. I grew up in Hampstead Garden Suburb. I called myself the Feminax Junkie — mostly necking period pain pills to get off my head.”\n\nSt Aubyn features in Self’s memoirs, but he won’t say how: “I’ll keep my powder dry.” The book is called Will — “with that reference to the human quality of perseverance — or not”. Was his name a gift? “A gift and a curse. Even I, having had this name all my life, am sometimes, in the middle of the night, struck dumb by nominative determinism.”\n\n“Everything is about content, no longer about style. Pornography,” he continues, “is the most content-driven s**t there is,” and our world is saturated with it. Later he tells me he interviewed Andrea Dworkin, the radical feminist. “She converted me to understanding that pornography was not a free-speech issue but a criminal issue.” Did he stop watching? “Pretty much. Although I am not a whited sepulchre — I relapse. Ha!”\n\nPlus, he has mellowed. “Massively. I was wild beyond belief as a young man.” I ask if he has vices and he mocks me, saying “shooting speedballs”, but actually his life is fairly wholesome. He doesn’t drink. He enjoys walking — famously — and has written extensively about it. Friends say he vapes. He lives in a flat in south London close to his children (he has four from two marriages, aged 27, 25, 21 and 17).\n\nAnd actually, I’ve seen his gentle (but still bossy) side: I met him at lunch with mutual friends when I had a newborn who I was struggling to get to sleep. He scooped her up and settled her in seconds. He admits, “I do like a baby.” His first “was like tripping on acid. I thought: this is extraordinary. That’s why I wanted to do it again and again.” But, he continues: “It’s unseemly for a man my age to have any more. I’m too old now. Sometimes I think, ‘Once more unto the breach!’ But no, it’s irresponsible. When I see men in their fifties having kids, I don’t mean to castigate them but you do think, ‘Have you really thought this through?’”"
