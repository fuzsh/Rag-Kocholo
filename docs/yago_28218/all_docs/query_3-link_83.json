        "text": "Follow these steps to have your name legally changed by a court.\n\n1. Choose Your New Name\n\nIn the U.S., we have a great deal of freedom to choose a new name–but it’s not absolute. That’s why, before we get into the process of changing your name, we should determine whether your proposed name change is legal. Here are the limitations on a name change:\n\nNo rude names. You can’t change your name to something racist, obscene, intimidating or otherwise offensive.\n\nNo confusing names. You can’t change your name to something that causes confusion, such as a numeral, punctuation or symbol. For those of you who remember, Prince may have changed his name to a symbol, well, symbolically, but it wasn’t actually legal.\n\nNo stealing celebrity names. You can’t change your name in a way that could mislead or infringe upon another person’s rights (like a trademarked name). Taylor Swift has worked hard to earn her reputation, and no one else can try to capitalize on that by taking her name.\n\nNo hiding. You can’t change your name to avoid liability, meaning a legal obligation such as debt or criminal punishment. You also can’t change your name for the purpose of committing a crime.\n\n2. Get Your Marriage Certificate and Other Documents\n\nIf you simply want to adopt your spouse’s last name, then a marriage certificate is the most important document you will need to make this happen—this legal document confirms that you’ve officially tied the knot.\n\nThe process of acquiring your marriage certificate varies by state. But it typically begins with getting a marriage license, which is a permit that indicates that you’re legally allowed to get married.\n\nWhile the license authorizes you to get married, the marriage certificate is the document that confirms your legal marital status. The officiant of your wedding is responsible for filing for the marriage certificate within a specific timeframe, which varies by state—for instance, in Texas, the license must be filed with the county clerk’s office within 30 days of the ceremony, while as in California, the deadline to do so is just 10 days.\n\nYou can then obtain a certified copy of the marriage certificate from your county clerk’s office. This certificate will usually have your new name, and you’ll use it to change your name with the DMV, bank and other institutions.\n\nNow, if you want to change your first name, too, or want a completely unique last name, then you’ll need a court-ordered name change. The type of documents you need for this depends on a) your state of residence and b) the reason for your name change.\n\nYou’ll likely need the following items:\n\nA completed application or petition for the name change\n\nA copy of your birth certificate\n\nProof of identification\n\nProof of residency (documents with your name and address, such as a utility bill)\n\nA sworn statement of proof of good character from two citizens of the county\n\nA sworn statement declaring your outstanding tax or child support obligations, if any\n\nState and federal criminal background checks and fingerprints\n\nPayment for the required fee\n\nA “sworn statement” means that the person completing the document must sign it in front of a notary public, who will then notarize the document by stamping it. (This can also be done in front of a judge, but notaries are more commonly used.) A notary public may charge a small fee.\n\nBecause each state has its own very specific requirements, find out what you need in advance so you can move through the process quickly. In most states the process is handled in state court (not federal or county or city court).\n\n3. File for the Name Change\n\nThe good news is that assembling your documents is the hardest part of a legal name change, or at least the most tedious. Once you have your documents in order, head to the court and file them with the clerk of court.\n\nDepending on your state, you may have to publish notice of your name change application. The clerk of court should be able to explain this process, which usually involves paying for a notice in a local newspaper. Alternatively, the court may take care of this for you.\n\nIt’s possible the clerk of court will ask you for additional information to support your name change petition.\n\nThe clerk of court will review your name change application and, if the clerk decides you have good reason to change your name, will grant your request. In some states you have to appear at a brief court hearing before a judge to have your name change approved. It can take several weeks or months to receive your certificate of name change, again depending on the state.\n\nIn some states you will get a certificate or court order that can be attached to your birth certificate. In other states you will be issued a new amended birth certificate.\n\n4. Update Social Security Card\n\nDon’t worry, changing your last name doesn’t mean you need to get a new Social Security number—you just need to update your card with your new name.\n\nFirst fill out Form SS–5 and bring it to your local Social Security Administration office. Also bring along your identification, proof of name change like your marriage certificate or court order with name change. For all these documents, bring in the original copy or certified copy from the issuing agency.\n\nThe Social Security Administration will send you a replacement card with your new name for free within 14 days.\n\n5. Update Drivers License\n\nOnce the SSA has updated your name, the next checkpoint is the DMV to get your driver’s license updated.\n\nTake your current license, your new Social Security card and your marriage certificate. Each state has its own deadline for when you need to get your license updated.\n\nFor instance, Texas gives you 30 days from name change to get your license updated, while Nebraska gives a 60-day window. Make sure to check the rules in your state so you’re not racing against the clock.\n\n6. Update Your Passport\n\nIf you’ve got any upcoming travels, we recommend holding off on updating your passport till after you’re back. Why? Because the name on your airline ticket, if you purchased it before name change, needs to match your passport.\n\nOnce you’re back and ready to proceed, you’ll need to get in touch with the U.S. Department of State and fill out the DS-5504 form. Make sure you have your current U.S. passport, your marriage certificate and a passport photo ready to go.\n\nGetting your new passport will typically take six to eight weeks but if you want it sooner, you’ll have to pay a $60 fee to expedite.\n\n7. Other Places to Update\n\nDepending on your circumstances, your new name will need to make its way to several other agencies and institutions to ensure all aspects of your life reflect this change. These include:\n\nLocal post office\n\nState benefits programs\n\nState taxing authority\n\nVoters’ registration\n\nBanks and financial institutions\n\nCredit card companies and lenders\n\nInsurance carriers\n\nYour mortgage holder or your landlord\n\nUtility service providers\n\nHealthcare providers\n\nYour employer (and coworkers)\n\nYour will/powers of attorney/other estate planning documents\n\nSchools\n\nYour passport and TSA precheck or global entry\n\nYou get the idea, right? In many instances, the legal process of changing your name could actually be the easy part.\n\nNote: The fear of fraud is real, so don’t be surprised if you get pushback from banks, insurance providers, etc. Fortunately, you’ll have your court order, certificate or amended birth certificate to back you up, so be sure to provide that. Just take a deep breath and summon some patience.\n\n8. Let Your Social Circle Know\n\nOnce you’ve tackled the formalities of changing your name with all the major agencies and institutions, it’s time to bring your friends and family into the loop.\n\nA great way to spread the word quickly is by uploading a simple post highlighting the name change on social media.\n\nDepending on what you and your loved ones use, a few apps and platforms where you may consider posting a message include:"
