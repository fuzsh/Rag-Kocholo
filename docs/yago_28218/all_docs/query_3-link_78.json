Copies of online documents printed using your computer are free. These copies will bear an “unofficial copy” watermark.\n\nElectronic Documents Sent by Email – These are uncertified documents that a clerk sends to the customer via email.

These copies can be requested by phone, email, or in person. The cost for this service is $1.00 per page.\n\nCertified Copies – This is when the Clerk makes the copy and places a stamp on it to certify that it is an accurate and complete reproduction of the original document. Certified copies may be requested by phone, email, or in person. There is a $5.00 per document charge for the certification service plus an additional cost of $1.00 per page.\n\nWe accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover credit cards.

Customers often refer to this as a “criminal background check.” Please note that our search only includes data on Travis County Class A and B misdemeanors as well as any Class C misdemeanor cases appealed from a municipal or Justice of the Peace Court. No federal or other county Justice of the Peace or municipality misdemeanor records are searched. The data provided from these searches relies on the information obtained and entered into Travis County’s centralized justice computer system. Inaccurate data obtained or inaccurately entered by any office performing data entry in the system will result in erroneous data returned. For the most accurate results, please provide as much identifying information as possible.\n\nWhen requesting a search of misdemeanor data, please provide the person’s full name and date of birth plus any other identifiers that may assist in locating the correct individual. A certified copy of the findings can be provided after payment has been received."
