        "text": "What is a self-inflicted injury?\n\nA self-inflicted injury occurs when someone purposely hurts themselves.\n\nSelf-inflicted injury is also called self-injury, self-abuse, self-mutilation, deliberate self-harm, parasuicidal behavior, and non-suicidal self-injury.\n\nSelf- inflicted injuries most often occur on the arms, legs and front of the body because they are easier to reach and hide under clothing. However, the injuries could affect any part of the body.\n\nWho is most likely to engage in self-inflicted injury?\n\nMost people who injure themselves are teenagers. People who injure themselves usually start this behavior in their young teens. Self-inflicted injury usually occurs numerous times, rather than just once.\n\nHow could someone injure themselves?\n\nAny of the following methods could be used:\n\nBiting\n\nBone breaking\n\nBurning\n\nCarving words or symbols into the skin\n\nCutting (making cuts or scratches on the skin with sharp objects such as knives, needles, razor blades, scissors, pins, fingernails, etc.)\n\nHair-pulling\n\nHitting or punching (with a hammer or other object)\n\nHitting his/her head (head banging)\n\nPiercing the skin using sharp objects\n\nPicking at skin or reopening wounds so they cannot heal\n\nPinching\n\nPoisoning (or drinking harmful chemicals)\n\nTaking an overdose of drugs\n\nWhat medical problems can result from self-inflicted injury?\n\nChildren who injure themselves do not usually intend to cause lasting injury. However, self-inflicted injury may cause serious medical problems, including:\n\nLife-threatening blood loss\n\nDeep cuts needing stitches\n\nInfections from wounds or dirty cutting objects\n\nIncreased feelings of shame, guilt and low self-esteem\n\nUnintended suicide (Self-inflicted injury is usually not suicidal behavior; however, it may result in death.)\n\nHigher risk of attempted suicide (Most people who injure themselves are not trying to die by suicide. However, the emotional problems and pain that lead to self-inflicted injury may lead to attempted suicide.)\n\nRepeated self-inflicted injury (Self-inflicted injury can become a compulsive behavior.This means that the more a person does it, the more he/she feels the need to keep doing it.)\n\nWhy would someone purposely injure themselves?\n\nSelf-inflicted injury is usually a teen's effort to try to feel better, not to end his/her life. Teens may use self-inflicted injury as a way to cope with (or find relief from) emotional pain, strong feelings (such as anger, hurt, sadness, despair, shame, frustration, rejection, or isolation), intense pressure, or relationship problems.\n\nTeens who injure themselves may be dealing with feelings that they cannot cope with, or hard situations they think cannot change. They may feel desperate for relief from these feelings. These teens sometimes have other mental health problems that add to their emotional pain. They may have experienced trauma, such as living through abuse, violence, or a disaster.\n\nWhat are warning signs of self-inflicted injury?\n\nSelf-inflicted injury is often kept secret so it may be difficult to see warning signs. Warning signs of self-inflicted injury include:\n\nScars (from burns, cuts, etc.)\n\nFresh cuts, scratches, burns or other wounds\n\nBruises\n\nBroken bones\n\nKeeping sharp objects on hand\n\nAlways covering arms and legs and wearing cold-weather clothes even in warm weather\n\nDifficulty controlling his/her emotional state ( especially sadness, fear and anger)\n\nLow self-esteem\n\nEating disorders\n\nSubstance abuse\n\nSpending a lot of time alone\n\nWhat should I do if my child has any of these warning signs?\n\nOpenly express your concern, support, and love.\n\nSeek mental health services.\n\nCall S.A.F.E. Alternative's Self-injury Resource Line: 1-800-DONTCUT(366.8288).\n\nEncourage your child to talk to you, other trusted adults and friends.\n\nWhat NYS laws related to the prevention of self-inflicted injuries are important for me to know?\n\nTimothy's Law requires that health insurance providers provide comparable (similar) coverage for mental illnesses as they provide for other medical care. Timothy's Law ensures that adults and children with mental illness receive the same health care coverage benefits as those provided for physical ailments.\n\nOnly people covered by group health insurance or a school blanket health insurance policy are eligible for the mental health benefits required by Timothy's Law. Group health insurance is insurance that you obtain through an employer or through an association, such as a chamber of commerce. A school blanket health insurance policy covers students enrolled in a college or university who purchase their insurance through the school.\n\nWhere can I find more information about self-inflicted injury?"
