        "text": "If a woman, an individual woman multiplied by billions, does not believe in her own discrete existence and therefore cannot credit the authenticity of her own suffering, she is erased, canceled out, and the meaning of her life, whatever it is, whatever it might have been, is lost. This loss cannot be calculated or comprehended. It is vast and awful, and nothing will ever make up for it.\n\n― Andrea Dworkin, Right Wing Women\n\nI never met Nigella Lawson, not yet. She is still relevant. She is the battered wife. The super woman who drowned her sorrows in cocaine as her former husband lay dying of cancer and her ex husband allegedly emotionally brutalized her.\n\nI only meet women like Nigella when they become irrelevant.\n\nIn my distant social orbit, light years from the warming sun of acceptability, circle the flotsam and jetsam of international society. Isolated by ignominy, the ex wives of current politicians, media titans and corporate mega moguls float in and out of the rooms of AA, expensive treatment centers in the Arizona desert, The San Fernando Valley and Malibu.\n\nAping the lives they once had with limitless funds, they buy a few stems of bruised tuba rose* from the same florist who once filled their many mansions with exotic blooms. Sumptuous bouquets placed on valuable escritoire, on silvered night stands, on grand dining tables.\n\nShe stands briefly on the threshold, looking at her guilty feet, apologising for the frugal fist of sweet smelling flowers. The florist looks on piteously knowing that her younger, more glamorous successor can spend whatever she pleases.\n\nThe lonely ex-wife arranges a slim vase in her well-appointed but humble apartment in Pimlico moments from where she and her spouse once lived on Eaton Square.\n\nThese frosty, cast off ex-wives, their faces wet with angry tears, looking to half-baked sober life coaches in first-rate treatment centers to recalibrate their lives. Drinking away their sorrows, dumped by men whose power they loved and whose money they spent. Yoga, sobriety, macrobiotics, spending, using, crying… nothing seems to work because all these women want is the sweet taste of revenge.\n\nThis week, one very lucky ex-wife gets her dues. She waited patiently on the sidelines of her ex-husband’s life to witness the crushing downfall of her Nemesis. Today, American born, Kay Saatchi is not only back in Charles’s life but has had the delicious pleasure of helping dispense the woman who caused Kay pain beyond description: Nigella Lawson.\n\nKay is delightful. I’ve met her on numerous occasions in Los Angeles. Of course she’s delightful! A man like Charles Saatchi wouldn’t marry an idiot. Kay is everything a powerful man would want, she is elegant, super smart, she has exquisite taste. Kay, nowadays, is sober. Yet, when Kay was drinking, she had an unpleasant habit of blacking out and talking gibberish about Charles. She couldn’t and wouldn’t stop. Even her best friend wouldn’t know how to stem the tirade. Her life, it seemed, could only be nothing… without Charles.\n\nShe would disintegrate into a seething mess of Charles Saatchi resentment.\n\nThe only hook Kay had in her ex as she watched in increasing horror as Nigella used Charles as a spring-board into her own rock solid career as international domestic goddess… was her/their daughter Phoebe who Kay moaned constantly was ignored by her father. When I asked Phoebe if her father ignored her over Christmas dinner a few years ago… she denied it, looked sadly at her drunk mother and told me that the only problem parent… was Kay.\n\nNow, things are different. Kay is sober (unlike Nigella) and Kay’s undying love and loyalty for her ex husband has been rewarded by his begging Kay to help oust Nigella. Kay will never be Mrs Charles Saatchi ever again but she has made herself indispensable to him during his time of need… once again firmly cementing herself back into his life.\n\nIt is hard to explain to ordinary people the intoxicating effect of unlimited cash, how women like Kay, Nigella and now Trinny Woodall would willingly get involved with brooding Charles Saatchi. A man who throttled his ex wife in public. A man so ruthless he recruits his vulnerable ex-wife to destroy his current wife.\n\nDo yourself a favor and read Andrea Dworkin’s Right Wing Women: the politics of domesticated females. Money and power are everything to some women. It defies logic and rationale. The patriarch, the provider, the batterer… do what ever you will to me and for me… I am yours forever.\n\nToday the harsh glare of media scrutiny lights up every dark corner of Charles Saatchi’s famously private life. Appearing every day at the trial of his former employees, The Grillo Sisters. It must be a painful time for secretive Charles. During the trial there was constant mention of the grown women (who were no more that indentured servants) as ‘family’ yet, as Deborah Orr points out in the only pro Grillo piece on offer this week…\n\n“You cannot insist that someone is in your family, then cry fraud when they behave as if they are.”\n\nThe rich are different. They like to live beyond scrutiny, they operate without care for consequence. Partially, this week, on a micro and macro level justice was done. For servants like the Grillo sisters and for ex wives who crave revenge.\n\n* Princess Diana‘s favorite flower.\n\nAfter it’s six month epic repair my gold watch finally came home from Boucheron. The Mec, designed by Solange Azagury. Bought after seeing it on her husband at a party for Bella Freud.\n\nSparkling rose gold and new black leather strap, the small gold button that had popped off for no reason last year was finally repaired, the scratches erased.\n\nI bought the watch with the money I was paid by The News of the World when I sold my Elizabeth Hurley ‘tell all’ story after the making of my film, The Method. My sweet revenge for her appalling behaviour, the treatment of me and others and general vileness.\n\nMost of all I sold that story because it galled me daily that a talentless witch like Hurley could steal a paying job from a real actress.\n\nGoing into that project I rather stupidly thought that I could give her the benefit of the doubt and coerce a performance out of her. When she told me rather grandly the first day of shooting not to direct her because she was a ‘a celebrity, not an actress’ I really had nowhere to go.\n\nA grueling 3 months followed.\n\nThe keystone cop like producers Brad Wyman and Donald Kushner were not interested in making a film, rather they were busily conning money out of the British tax system, which at the time had an incentive designed to help the British Film industry but had been so bastardized that films made in Romania with American producers armed with dodgy budgets..qualified as BRITISH. The BUDGET for The Method that the government saw was no way translated into what the local Romanian crew were paid..about $100 a week.\n\nI told Will Self about this terrible con which, during the time it was operational, must have funneled as much tax payers money out of the country into American bank accounts as it would have cost to pay for several new British hospitals.\n\nWill was appalled. Deborah Orr was appalled. everyone I mentioned it to was appalled but nobody did anything about it.\n\nThankfully Gordon Brown finally put an end to this theft overseen by the worst kind of British film producers.\n\nIf you think I have been nasty to Jake..read what I wrote about Elizabeth.\n\nThe Architect stayed over last night. It’s not happening again. I am waiting for him to leave as I write. No sex. I cooked dinner. He smokes really hard. He makes a kind of gay purring ‘ah ha’ when he means to say yes and his perfume and shoes are CHEAP. His hands on me in the night caused pain in my skin his attention was so unwelcome. He was all over me like a rash.\n\nHe just left.\n\nI may be a perfectionist, as Jake said, but when I loved him..Jake was my perfection. I simply loved touching him, kissing him, rubbing his head. I loved him laying beside me. I loved his smell and his eyes and soft mouth.\n\nWhich makes his treachery that much worse.\n\nI hate him perfectly like I loved him perfectly. For a short while the search for my illusive man was over. For all his miserable flaws and inappropriateness and unavailability I loved him. I really loved him.\n\nThey ask me privately: How then, if you say you love him, can you treat him like that?\n\nAnyone who asks that audacious question has never truly been in love and I pity you.\n\nMy perfect hatred for him is built like a leaden, black as night, tar wall between what is and what was. A black tar wall erected between me and him so I never yearn for him, never cry for him, never love him ever again.\n\nIt is the only way I know how.\n\nWhen I think of all the arguments I have heard for why he was not right for me I am dumb-founded by how pedestrian they are. LOVE, love when it comes should be fought for! I tried every thing I knew to keep him and when I failed, when I failed I couldn’t be his friend. Listening to him tell me about other men. Listening to him reveal in every sordid detail of who fucked who, how many times they came. The rides home to Washington Heights. Those despicable stories are etched into my brain.\n\nThe drinking and driving. The man he slept with for over one year who never let him know until it was over that he had HIV not just risking Jake’s life but the life of his girlfriend!\n\nI really loved him and he tormented me with what he did with others. He tormented me because he saw that love weakens me.\n\nThis morning, after the architect left I opened all the windows and doors. I stripped the bed and I wept because I miss the familiarity of my lover. I miss you so much and I never get to tell you. Instead, I have to tell you that I hate you. That I want my money back. That you betrayed me. I don’t want to tell you any of those things. I want you to know that I miss you, that you left something indelible that I try every single day like an idiot savant scrubbing a tattoo out of his skin…to forget."
