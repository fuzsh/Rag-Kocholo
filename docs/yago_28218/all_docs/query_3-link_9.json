        "text": "It is important to know the difference between depending on another person — which can be a positive and desirable trait — and codependency, which is harmful.\n\nThe following are some examples that illustrate the difference:\n\nDependence:Codependence:Two people rely on each other for support and love. Both find value in the relationship.The codependent person feels worthless unless they are needed by — and making drastic sacrifices for — the enabler. The enabler may get satisfaction from having every need met by the other person.Both parties prioritize their relationship, but can find joy in outside interests, other friends, and hobbies.The codependent has no personal identity, interests, or values outside of their codependent relationship.Both people can express their emotions and needs and find ways to make the relationship beneficial for both of them.One person feels their desires and needs are unimportant and will not express them. They may have difficulty recognizing their feelings or needs at all.\n\nA codependent person is only happy when making extreme sacrifices for their partner. They may feel that being needed by the other person is necessary to feel a sense of purpose.\n\nOne or both parties can be codependent. A codependent person will neglect other important areas of their life to please their partner. Their extreme dedication to this one person may cause damage to:\n\nother relationships\n\ntheir career\n\ntheir everyday responsibilities\n\nThe enabler’s role is also dysfunctional. A person who relies upon a codependent does not learn how to have an equal, two-sided relationship and often comes to rely upon another person’s sacrifices and neediness.\n\nCodependency is a learned behavior that usually stems from past behavioral patterns and emotional difficulties. Early research associated codependency with living with someone with alcohol use disorder.\n\nHowever, experts now suggest codependency can result from the following situations.\n\nDamaging parental relationships\n\nPeople who are codependent as adults may have had problems with their parental relationship as a child or teenager.\n\nTheir parental figure may be emotionally or physically absent. In other situations, a parent may teach a child to think their needs are unimportant or less important than their parents’.\n\nIn these types of families, parents may teach children not to think of themselves. Needy parents may also suggest that children are selfish or greedy if they want anything for themselves.\n\nAs a result, children may learn to ignore their own needs and think only about what they can do for others.\n\nIn these situations, parental figures may have:\n\nan addiction problem with alcohol or drugs\n\na lack of maturity and emotional development, resulting in their own self-centered needs\n\nchronic mental or physical conditions\n\nThese situations may cause gaps in emotional development in the child, leading them to seek out codependent relationships later.\n\nLiving with a mentally or physically ill family member\n\nCodependency may also result from caring for a person who is chronically ill. Being in the role of caregiver, especially at a young age, may cause a young person to neglect their own needs and develop a habit of only helping others.\n\nHowever, this does not solely affect younger people. Even adults in a caregiver role may develop codependency.\n\nA person’s self-worth may form around being needed by another person and receiving nothing in return.\n\nMany people who live with an ill family member do not develop codependency. But, it can happen in these types of family environments, particularly if the parent or primary caretaker displays dysfunctional behaviors.\n\nAbusive families\n\nPhysical, emotional, and sexual abuse can cause long lasting psychological problems. One issue that can arise from past abuse is codependency.\n\nSomeone who experiences abuse may learn to repress their feelings as a defense mechanism. This learned behavior may result in a person caring only about another’s feelings and not acknowledging their own needs.\n\nSometimes, a person who experiences abuse may seek out abusive relationships later because they are only familiar with this type of relationship. This can manifest in codependent relationships.\n\nCodependency can occur in romantic, platonic, or familial relationships. It involves a harmful level of dependency in which a person centers their entire life around the other person’s needs and desires at their own expense.\n\nPeople in codependent relationships may find no satisfaction if they are not doing something for the other person and may feel guilty or reluctant to share their own needs or desires.\n\nHealthcare professionals can help people identify and manage codependency. This process may involve individual or group therapy combined with lifestyle changes, such as trying new hobbies and spending time with people outside the relationship."
