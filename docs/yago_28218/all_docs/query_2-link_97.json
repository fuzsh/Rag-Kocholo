        "text": "According to the Guardian, for whom she writes a weekly column, Scottish journalist Deborah Orr “is one of Britain’s leading social and political commentators.”\n\nDeborah Orr it turns out is not just a “social and political commentator” she is also a scathing critic of the Church of England.\n\nOrr has aimed her most recent criticism at Justin Welby whom she labels “the trendy-vicar”.\n\nDeborah Orr’s problem with Archbishop Welby lies in what she sees as his complicated, she might say conflicted, or even contradictory, position on same-sex relationships.\n\nOrr explains that, on the one hand, Welby wants to say that\n\nit was “great” that parliament passed the same-sex marriage bill. Except that that’s not what he meant. He meant that it was “great” that parliament makes acts in a general sense.\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/17/church-of-england-is-homophobic\n\nAt the same time, the Archbishop\n\nremains against gay marriage himself. Though he also imagines that he’s against homophobia.\n\nOrr goes on to surmise that the Archbishop presumably,\n\nthinks “homophobia” is being personally rude and aggressive to gay people because they are gay, but that asking them to kindly observe the “heterosexuals only” sign is fine, as long as one is polite about it. He is wrong. He and his church discriminate against people because of their sexuality, so the Anglican church is homophobic.\n\nOrr concludes,\n\nThe rest of us have had to come to terms with the fact that the days of empire are over, and also that they might, just might, not have been all they were cracked up to be. Why the Anglican church believes it can and should defy that logic is a mystery that surely can’t endure much longer.\n\n“Homophobia” is not the most helpful label to describe the Archbishop’s position on gay marriage.\n\nThe “Oxford Dictionaries” describes “homophobia” as\n\nAn extreme and irrational aversion to homosexuality and homosexual people.\n\nThe fact that a person believes marriage can only be between a man and a woman, does not necessarily indicate that such a person has “an extreme and irrational aversion to homosexuality and homosexual people.” I could believe that a suitor was unsuitable for my daughter without necessarily having “an extreme and irrational aversion” to him as a person.\n\nIs discrimination, as Orr suggests, necessarily homophobic?\n\nSurely, it is possible to have a well-reasoned intelligent argument in favour of certain discriminations. If my daughter’s imaginary suitor was a cocaine addict, I would have good grounds for encouraging her to be discriminating before jumping into a married relationship with him.\n\nBut here is the problem. The Archbishop of Canterbury does not appear to have a well-reasoned argument upon which to discriminate against people in same-sex relationships sharing faithful, committed, monogamous, life-long intimacy. His argument seems to be the Bible says it is wrong and if we endorse such relationships, our brothers and sisters in Africa will be unhappy and possibly be harmed by those who disagree. Deborah Orr is unlikely to be swayed by such “logic.” All she take away from the Archbishop’s position is confirmation that the Church of England is nothing but\n\nan innocuous purveyor of spiritual pomp and circumstance.\n\nThe Archbishop is going to have his work cut out for him convincing people like Ms. Orr that they should take his church at all seriously."
