        "text": "If one parent will not agree to have a child's name changed, the other parent can file papers to request the change. The non-consenting parent must be served with copies of the name change papers and given a chance to object. A judge may or may not grant a child's name change without the other parent's consent. Read on for more information about how to petition for a child's name change when only one parent is asking for the name change.\n\nIs this page for me? This page is for parents of child residents of Clark County, Nevada, who want to ask for a name change for their child, but the other parent will not agree. Typically, both parents must agree to have a child's name changed. However, one parent can ask for a name change and serve the other parent with the name change papers to see if the other parent will object.\n\nWhat if the other parent will agree and sign? Follow the instructions for Name Changes When Parents Agree.\n\nWhat if the other parent is deceased or their rights were terminated by a court? Follow the instructions for Name Changes When Parents Agree.\n\nDo I have to involve the other parent? Yes. You cannot avoid notifying a parent about a child's proposed name change just because the parent is not involved in the child's life or the parent's location is unknown. You will have to search for the parent and make sure they are served with the name change papers after filing. You may have to get permission to publish a notice in a newspaper if you cannot find them to serve them in person. A judge may grant the name change without the other parent's consent, but the other parent does have a right to know about the proposed name change and object if he/she does not agree.\n\nWhat laws apply? Learn the basics of the laws that apply to name changes in the Name Change Overview.\n\nFollow these steps to file for a child name change:\n\n1. Fill out the forms. There are several forms you will have to fill out and sign.\n\n2. File the forms. Turn in your completed forms to the Clerk of Court by mail or efiling.\n\n3. Serve the other parent. The other parent must be served with a copy of all the papers you filed.\n\n4. Set a hearing with the Judge. The judge will want a short hearing with you before approving the name change.\n\nLearn more about each step below.\n\n1. Fill out the forms\n\nAll of the following documents must be completed to ask the court for a name change:\n\nFamily Court Cover Sheet - always required\n\nThis form asks for basic information about the parent who is filing the paperwork and the child(ren). You are the Petitioner. The Clerk of Court uses this information to open your case. Use the child(ren)'s current legal name when completing this (and all) forms.\n\nFamily Court Cover Sheet (pdf)\n\nFamily Court Cover Sheet (pdf fillable)\n\nPetition for Child's Name Change - always required\n\nThis form tells the Court about the child's current name, the new name you would like the child to have, and the reasons why. You can ask for up to 2 children's names to be changed. Where the form asks for the child's current name, use the current full legal name.\n\nIndicate whether the other parent will agree to the name change and if not, why. Sign this form in front of a notary.\n\nPetition for Child's Name Change (pdf)\n\nPetition for Child's Name Change (pdf fillable)\n\nNotice of Petition for Child's Name Change - always required\n\nThis form is directed to the non-consenting parent. It lets the other parent know about the proposed name change, and what to do if they want to object. Fill out the form completely.\n\nNotice of Petition for Child's Name Change (pdf)\n\nNotice of Petition for Child's Name Change (pdf fillable)\n\nConsent to Child's Name Change (for parents and older children)\n\nIf the other parent will agree to the child's name change, the parent can fill out this form. This form must be signed in front of a notary.\n\nParent's Consent to Child's Name Change (pdf)\n\nParent's Consent to Child's Name Change (pdf fillable)\n\nA child age 14 or older must consent to their own name change. If any of the children are 14 or older, each child must complete a consent.\n\nChild's Consent to Child's Name Change (pdf)\n\nChild's Consent to Child's Name Change (pdf fillable)\n\nOrder for Child's Name Change - always required\n\nThis is the form the judge signs to grant the child's name change. Although this will not be needed until the last step, it is best to fill it out ahead of time and save it for later. You will give this to the judge after you have finished the rest of the steps. Complete all sections except for the date and signature line for the judge. Make sure to indicate whether or not a new birth certificate should be issued for the child with the new name.\n\nOrder for Child's Name Change (pdf)\n\nOrder for Child's Name Change (pdf fillable)\n\n2. File the forms\n\nThe court charges $270 to file the papers. The fee is payable by cash, money order, or most major credit/debit cards. If you cannot afford the fee, please see Filing Fees and Waivers to find out how to ask the court to waive the fee.\n\nYou can file your papers one of these ways:\n\nOnline: You can file online through the court's e-filing system, eFileNV. There is a fee of $3.50 to upload your documents, in addition to the regular filing fee. You must register for an account, you must provide a valid email address, and you must be able to scan and upload your documents as separate pdfs. Do not upload one pdf with all of the forms included - this will significantly delay the processing. Each form needs to be filed as its own pdf, but you can upload all of them in one submission. Do not efile the order, it will be submitted later. Carefully follow the E-Filing Guide to avoid mistakes.\n\nE-Filing Guide\n\nIn person at the Family Courthouse (check our How to File page for hours and more information).\n\nBy Mail: (mail takes about 6-8 weeks to process) Mail your forms and the filing fee (with check or money order made out to Clerk of Court) to:\n\nFamily Courts and Services Center\n\nAttn: Clerk of Court\n\n601 North Pecos Road\n\nLas Vegas, NV 89101\n\n3. Serve the other parent\n\nAny living parent who still has parental rights to the child should be served with a copy of the Petition and the Notice of Petition. The way to serve the other parent depends on the following:\n\nIf you know or can find out where the other parent is located: The parent must be personally served with the Petition and the Notice of Petition. The parent filing for the name change cannot serve the other parent. Someone over the age of 18 who is not a party to the case must hand-deliver the documents to the parent. You can ask someone you know to serve the documents, or you can hire the sheriff or a private process service. Visit the Sheriffâ€™s Civil Process Section for more information on their fees and services.\n\nWhoever serves the other parent must fill out a Proof of Service form that says when, where, and how the other parent was served. Make sure this form is completed and filed at the family court.\n\nProof of Service (pdf) Proof of Service (pdf fillable)\n\nThe other parent can file an \"objection\" if they disagree with the name change. If they do, a hearing will be set for both parents to talk to the judge.\n\nIf you have had no contact with the other parent and do not know where to find him or her: You can ask the judge's permission to post a notice in a newspaper for three weeks instead of having the other parent served in person. You will have to fill out some forms explaining everything that was done to try and find the other parent to have them served. It will be up to the judge whether to allow you to publish the notice instead of having it served. Download the packet below and follow all of the included instructions to request permission to publish.\n\nRequest for Publication - Minor Name Change (pdf)\n\n4. Set a hearing with the judge\n\nThe judge usually requires a hearing before approving a child's name change without both parents' consent. The hearing is called a \"prove up\" or an \"uncontested\" hearing. This is a short hearing where the judge can ask you some questions before deciding whether to approve the child's name change.\n\nTo set a hearing, fill out an Uncontested Setting Slip and file it. A clerk will set a court date for you when you file the form. The judge cannot grant the name change until 10 days after the last date the notice was published. Make sure your hearing date is scheduled for at least 10 days after the final publication date.\n\nUncontested Setting Slip (pdf fillable)\n\nIf you did not already fill out the Order for Child's Name Change when you filled out your other paperwork, complete the form now. Complete all sections except for the signature line for the judge.\n\nOrder for Child's Name Change (pdf fillable)"
