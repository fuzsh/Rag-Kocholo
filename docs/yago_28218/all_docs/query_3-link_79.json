        "text": "Information for survivors and loved ones\n\nPlease accept our condolences on the loss of your loved one. The information provided below will help guide you through the process of reporting the death of a federal employee or retiree and applying for any potential death benefits that may be payable.\n\nHow to report the death of a Federal Employee/Retiree\n\nTo report a death, you can do one of the following:\n\nComplete an online Report of Death form.\n\nCall our Retirement Information Office at 888-767-6738 Monday through Friday during the hours of 7:40 am and 5:00 pm EST/EDT.\n\nWhat you need to report:\n\nRetiree/employee’s name.\n\nAny information you may have, such as the retiree/employee’s date of birth, social security number, claim number and address.\n\nNames and addresses of the survivors so that we may send out information regarding potential death benefits that might be payable.\n\nIf this is the death of a current federal employee, please contact the employing agency and report the death directly to them as well.\n\nAfter reporting the death\n\nRetirees\n\nOnce OPM is notified, our office will create a claim number for the deceased and send a packet to the survivors that includes:\n\nApplication for Death Benefits (Standard Form 3104 for FERS, Standard Form 2800 for CSRS) with a return pink envelope\n\nFE 6 – OFEGLI Claim for Death Benefits with a return blue envelope. If you have questions, or need help completing this form, call OFEGLI at 1-800-633-4542. Their Customer Service Center is open Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. EST/EDT.\n\nEmployees\n\nIf the deceased was an employee, the employing agency at the time of death will provide the survivors with an information packet and work with them to provide OPM with the necessary information.\n\nDocuments to include with your Application for Death Benefits\n\nTo process an Application for Death Benefits, OPM must receive certain documents from the applicant. Providing these documents with your application will help to prevent delays in processing your application. In addition to a complete application, you should submit the following:\n\nProof of death that shows the date and cause/manner of death. We cannot accept a pending death certificate.\n\nProof of termination of any marriage. Submit a copy of final divorce, annulment, or death certificate with your application.\n\nIf you are the widow/widower, include a copy of your marriage certificate.\n\nIf you are a child of the deceased, include a copy of your birth certificate showing both of your parents’ names.\n\nIf you are a court-appointed administrator, executor or other official of the estate of the deceased, include a copy of the appointment with a raised seal.\n\nAfter submitting your application\n\nOnce OPM has received a complete application, the claim will be assigned to a specialist for processing in the order in which it was received. If the claim involves the death of an employee, it will be assigned to a specialist once OPM has received the death package from the employing agency and payroll office. If additional information is needed to process the claim, the specialist will reach out directly to the survivor(s) and/or agency. Once the specialist has all documentation needed, they will process the claim accordingly.\n\nIf I’m eligible, how will I receive my payment?\n\nOn your application for death benefits, there is a section that asks you how you would like to receive your payment. If you are receiving a one-time lump sum benefit, payment may be sent via hard copy check or direct deposit. If you are receiving a monthly benefit, the Department of Treasury requires that federal payments be sent via electronic funds transfer (EFT). There are only three exemptions that would allow for a paper check: if the recipient is over 90 years old, if the recipient lives more than 50 miles from an ATM, or if recipients are unable to manage their own finances.\n\nTypes of Survivor Benefits that may be payable by OPM\n\nMonthly Annuity\n\nA monthly annuity may be payable to a current spouse, former spouse (if a retiree elects this benefit or if it is awarded by court order), a minor child, disabled dependent and/or student. Creditable service and length of marriage requirements must also be met.\n\nLump-Sum Credit\n\nIf there is not and will not be anyone eligible for a monthly survivor annuity, a lump-sum of any remaining retirement deductions may be payable. If an annuitant has exhausted all their retirement deductions, accrued annuity for the number of days they lived in the month they passed (minus any health benefit or life insurance premiums) may be payable.\n\nBasic Employee Death Benefit (FERS ONLY)\n\nIf an employee dies with at least 18 months of creditable service, a current spouse or former spouse (if awarded in a court order) may be entitled to the Basic Employee Death Benefit.\n\nAn employee is anyone who was still on the agency’s employment rolls at the time of death even if they had applied for disability retirement and their pay had already stopped.\n\nMonthly Survivor Annuity\n\nA monthly survivor annuity may be payable to the following:\n\nA spouse, if an employee who died in service is survived by a spouse who\n\nWas married to the employee for an aggregate of at least 9 months (the nine-month requirement does not apply if the death was accidental); or\n\nWas the parent of a child born of the marriage (including one born posthumously or out of wedlock if the parties later married) and the employee had\n\nUnder FERS, at least 10 years of creditable service (18 months of which must be civilian service); or\n\nUnder CSRS, at least 18 months of creditable civilian service.\n\nA former spouse, if a qualifying court order expressly awards a survivor annuity to the former spouse prior to the employee’s death.\n\nA child, if an employee with at least 18 months of creditable civilian service is survived by\n\nUnmarried dependent children up to age 18\n\nUnmarried dependent children from age 18 to 22 if attending an accredited educational institution full-time.\n\nUnmarried, disabled dependent children over the age of 18 (certified as such by the Social Security Administration) if the disability occurred before age 18.\n\nNote:\n\nThe combined benefit of all the children is reduced by the total amount of child insurance benefits that are payable under Title II of the Social Security Act for the same month to all children of the deceased based on the total earnings of the deceased. In many cases, FERS children’s benefits are reduced to $0.\n\nLump-Sum Benefit\n\nIf an employee dies and there is no possible survivor annuity payable based on their death, the retirement contributions remaining to the deceased person’s credit in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, plus any applicable interest, are payable. If a lump-sum benefit is payable, it is paid to the first person eligible under the following order of precedence:\n\nThe beneficiary designated by the deceased in writing which is signed and witnessed and received at their employing agency prior to death.\n\nThe spouse of the deceased employee.\n\nChildren of the deceased employee (or descendants of deceased children).\n\nParents of the deceased employee.\n\nCourt appointed executor or administrator of the deceased employee’s estate.\n\nNext of kin of the deceased according to the laws in the deceased person’s domicile at death\n\nBasic Employee Death Benefit (BEDB) – Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) Only\n\nPayable to a spouse if the employee who dies had at least 18 months of creditable civilian service and is survived by a spouse who—\n\nWas married to the deceased for an aggregate of at least 9 months (the nine-month requirement does not apply if the death was accidental); or\n\nIf the deceased federal employee was the parent of a child born of the marriage (including one born posthumously or out of wedlock if the parties later married).\n\nPayable to a former spouse, if a qualifying court order expressly awards the former spouse a survivor annuity benefit prior to the employee’s death, and the former spouse was married to the deceased for a total period of at least nine months and did not remarry before reaching age 55.\n\nThe BEDB is equal to 50% of the employee‘s final salary (or average salary, if higher), plus $15,000 (increased by Civil Service Retirement System cost-of-living adjustments beginning December 1, 1987). The $15,000 has increased to $37,055.54 for deaths after December 1, 2021.\n\nA retiree is anyone who had been separated from an agency’s employment rolls and has met all the requirements for retirement (including having filed an application for retirement benefits). An individual who was eligible for an immediate retirement when the individual separated from Federal service but postponed applying for benefits to avoid an age reduction, is deemed to have applied for retirement beginning the first of the month after death. Benefits due, in this instance, are those based on the death of a retiree.\n\nPlease be advised that you may receive a reclamation notice for payments received after death. The reclamation notice will provide you with instructions on how to proceed if necessary.\n\nMonthly Survivor Annuity\n\nMay be payable if a retiree dies who, at retirement, elected to provide a monthly survivor annuity for:\n\nTheir surviving spouse and/or former spouse.\n\nA person having an insurable interest in the retiree.\n\nA spouse acquired after retirement.\n\nA former spouse for which a qualifying court order expressly awards a survivor annuity.\n\nMay be payable to a child if the retiree is survived by:\n\nUnmarried dependent children up to age 18.\n\nUnmarried dependent children from age 18 to 22 if attending an accredited educational institution full-time.\n\nUnmarried, disabled dependent children over the age of 18 (certified as such by the Social Security Administration) if the disability occurred before age 18.\n\nNote:\n\nThe combined benefit of all the children is reduced by the total amount of child’s insurance benefits that are payable under Title II of the Social Security Act for the same month to all children of the deceased based on the total earnings of the deceased. In many cases, FERS children’s benefits is reduced to $0.\n\nLump-Sum Benefit\n\nIf a retiree dies, a lump-sum benefit equal to the annuity due the deceased but not paid before death may be payable.\n\nIf no survivor annuity is payable based on the retiree’s death, the balance of any retirement deductions remaining to the deceased retiree’s credit in the Fund, plus any applicable interest, is payable. o If a lump-sum benefit is payable, it is paid to the first person eligible under the following order of precedence:\n\nThe beneficiary designated by the deceased in writing which is signed and witnessed and received at their employing agency or OPM prior to death.\n\nThe spouse of the deceased.\n\nChildren of the deceased (or descendants of deceased children).\n\nParents of the deceased.\n\nCourt appointed executor or administrator of the deceased person’s estate.\n\nNext of kin of the deceased according to the laws in the deceased person’s state of domicile at death"
