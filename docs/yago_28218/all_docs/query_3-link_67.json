        "text": "What Is Narcissistic Personality Disorder?\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is one of several personality disorders. People with this condition have an inflated idea of themselves, and they need a lot of attention from other people. They often struggle to understand other peopleâs feelings.\n\nPeople with NPD may not have high self-esteem. Their NPD may be more related to feelings of entitlement. A therapist can help get to the bottom of it.\n\nNarcissism vs. narcissistic personality disorder\n\nThereâs a difference between being self-absorbed (someone who's often called a narcissist) and having narcissistic personality disorder.\n\nExperts consider narcissism a trait. On the other hand, NPD is a mental illness. With NPD, a pattern of behavior affects all areas of a personâs life. You can have narcissistic traits but not meet the official criteria for NPD.\n\nHow common is narcissistic personality disorder?\n\nResearchers arenât sure exactly how many people have NPD. Part of the reason is many hide their narcissistic thoughts or behaviors. Some data suggests that about 0.5%-5% of people in the U.S. might have NPD. Up to 75% of these cases occur in people assigned male at birth (AMAB).\n\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder Symptoms\n\nPeople with narcissistic personality disorder might:\n\nUpset other people often\n\nStruggle to keep relationships\n\nPut themselves first\n\nHave an overblown sense of worth\n\nThink they know the ârightâ way\n\nThink about themselves most of the time and talk about themselves a lot\n\nCrave attention and admiration\n\nThink that they should interact only with those whom they consider worthy\n\nExaggerate their talents and achievements\n\nBrag about their success\n\nHold themself to irrationally high standards\n\nSet unrealistic goals\n\nHave wide, fast mood swings\n\nHave a hard time taking othersâ feelings seriously\n\nStrive to win, whatever it takes\n\nFantasize about unlimited success, money, intelligence, beauty, love, and power\n\nHave a delicate self-esteem\n\nCrave compliments\n\nBe self-critical\n\nGet angry when other people donât cater to them\n\nFeel jealous of othersâ success\n\nTake advantage of other people\n\nHave a fear of being vulnerable\n\nBe sensitive to criticism or rejection\n\nHave depression\n\nBe a perfectionist\n\nAvoid situations where they could fail\n\nNPD is a spectrum disorder, which means the signs may vary quite a bit in type and severity. For instance, a personâs symptoms can range from mild to pathological.\n\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder and Relationships\n\nNPD causes problems in many areas of life, including close relationships. These interpersonal issues, which are often driven by symptoms of NPD, include:\n\nBeing easily hurt\n\nOverreacting\n\nStruggling to take criticism\n\nMaking excuses for own flaws or failings\n\nRefusing to take responsibility\n\nAttempting to sway or manipulate others\n\nBeing hypercompetitive\n\nOnly associating with people deemed to be on âtheir levelâ\n\nReacting with rage\n\nShaming others\n\nBeing emotionally neglectful\n\nNot listening\n\nInterrupting often\n\nSomeone like this may appear to have high self-esteem, but sometimes the opposite is true. There may be a deep sense of insecurity underneath the grand exterior. Someone can be narcissistic and not have the disorder. They may be self-absorbed and hypercompetitive, but not to the extent that it disrupts their daily life.\n\nItâs proven that people are often drawn to narcissists and find them attractive, charismatic, and exciting. Confidence can be charming. Successful leaders often have narcissistic qualities.\n\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder Diagnosis\n\nPersonality disorders are longstanding, ingrained, dysfunctional patterns of thinking, behaving, and relating to other people. These signs can show up as early as age 8, when children start to become aware of how people react to them. People with narcissistic personality disorder tend not to perceive that they may have a mental health problem, which may make them less likely to seek evaluation or treatment.\n\nA recent study at Ohio State University says many people readily admit to being a narcissist. But while narcissism may be common, narcissistic personality disorder is rare.\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder test\n\nThere are no lab tests to confirm a mental disorder. Many professionals use the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, a list of 40 questions that measures things such as how much attention and power someone craves.\n\nDoctors also use the American Psychiatric AssociationâsÂ Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth EditionÂ (DSM-5) to make a diagnosis. This guide lists nine criteria for NPD. To get a diagnosis, you must have at least five of them.\n\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder Causes\n\nThe exact cause is not known. Like most mental and personality disorders, itâs likely due to a complex combination of factors including:\n\nGenes. People with NPD are more likely to have family members with it.\n\nEnvironment including parent-child relationships. Kids often imitate the behaviors they observe in their parents. Overprotective parenting styles may also foster habits that can lead to NPD.\n\nNeurobiology (the connection between your behavior and your nervous system).Research suggests people with NPD may have small differences in their brain structure.\n\nCulture. NPD seems to be more common in people who grow up in cultures that value personal independence. The disorder is less likely to affect those who live in cultures that stress the importance of community.\n\nPeople whose parents put them on a pedestal and shower them with endless praise may be at higher risk for NPD, a recent study found. Then again, the opposite is true, too. Children who are ignored or abused may develop NPD almost as a survival instinct. They may feel that they need to look out for themselves because no one else will.\n\nNPD happens more in males than females. It usually shows up in teens or young adults. Keep in mind that children -- and really anyone -- can act in ways that seem narcissistic at times. This doesnât usually mean they have NPD or will develop it later.\n\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder Treatment\n\nThere is no cure, but therapy can help. The goal is to build up the personâs poor self-esteem and foster more realistic expectations of others. Treatment usually centers on talk therapy. Sometimes people call this psychotherapy.\n\nTalk therapy can help a person with NPD relate to other people better and understand their feelings and behaviors. Talk therapy can help a person with NPD to:\n\nAccept and maintain relationships with other people, including coworkers\n\nRecognize their own strengths and weaknesses\n\nLearn to accept criticism or failures\n\nDevelop more realistic goals\n\nLet go of unrealistic goals and desires\n\nSome types of talk therapy are:\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT helps you identify and change your negative thoughts and behaviors.\n\nMetacognitive therapy. Itâs a type of CBT that specifically helps you stop unhealthy beliefs and thinking.\n\nDialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). DBT is a type of CBT thatâs especially beneficial if you struggle to manage your emotions.\n\nGroup therapy. With group therapy, multiple people meet at the same time for a session.\n\nCouples or family therapy. A therapy session that focuses on couples or a family unit is sometimes helpful.\n\nThere are no medicines specifically for NPD. But doctors may prescribe drugs that are usually used to treat related mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety. Some of these are:\n\nAntidepressants\n\nAnti-anxiety meds\n\nAntipsychotics\n\nAnticonvulsants\n\nRelaxation exercises, such as yoga or mindfulness meditation, might also be helpful if you have NPD.\n\nThere arenât drugs to treat this mental disorder, but depression and anxiety sometimes go hand in hand with narcissism, and there are helpful drugs for those conditions.\n\nIf the narcissist abuses alcohol or drugs (which is common), itâs important to get treatment for the addictions, too.\n\nWith children, experts suggest that parents who give too much praise cut back, while those who donât give enough attention should step up.\n\nNarcissists can learn how to relate to others in more positive ways, but it depends on how open they are to critical feedback and how willing they are to change.\n\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder Complications\n\nPeople with NPD often have other mental health conditions, such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, or other personality disorders. Theyâre also more likely to abuse drugs or alcohol.\n\nSome possible complications of NPD and the conditions that overlap are:\n\nTrouble at work or school\n\nRelationship issues\n\nPhysical health problems\n\nThoughts about suicide\n\nSuicidal behaviors\n\nLiving With Narcissistic Personality Disorder\n\nIf you have NPD, it may be tempting not to stick with treatment. Here are tips for seeing it through:\n\nKeep an open mind.\n\nFocus on your goals and the rewards of treatment.\n\nKeep your appointments and follow your doctorâs advice.\n\nGet help for any addictions or other mental health problems.\n\nIf you are living with or in a close relationship with a person with NPD, here are tips for taking care of yourself:\n\nSet boundaries. Tell them what is and isnât acceptable to you.\n\nDonât get caught up in their way of viewing you.\n\nBe prepared for the relationship to change.\n\nDonât take it personally. People with NPD may try to get a reaction out of you, but itâs best if you donât respond.\n\nLet go of any need for approval from the person with NPD.\n\nLook for other people who will support you.\n\nLook for other sources of meaning and fulfillment in your life.\n\nRealize that you canât change someone with NPD.\n\nProtect yourself. Donât let the person with NPD convince you that their behavior is your fault.\n\nTake care of your own mental health. You may want to see a therapist who can help you work through your emotions.\n\nDonât overlook warning signs of suicide or self-harm. Call 911 if you think the person with NPD is in danger.\n\nTakeawaysÂ\n\nNPD is a mental health disorder that can negatively affect your relationship with yourself and others. If you struggle with NPD symptoms, therapy, medications, and relaxation strategies can help. Talk to a doctor or therapist if you think you have NPD.\n\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder FAQs\n\nWhat qualifies as narcissistic abuse?\n\nNarcissistic abuse is a type of emotional abuse thatâs caused by narcissistic behaviors. The person with narcissism may threaten, insult, criticize, mistreat, or manipulate you.\n\nWhat is the best treatment for a narcissist?\n\nTherapy can be an effective treatment option for someone who struggles with narcissistic thoughts or behaviors. Sometimes, doctors might also prescribe medicines or suggest relaxation methods.\n\nCan narcissists live a happy life?\n\nNot all narcissists are unhappy or stressed. Some people just have mild narcissistic traits. But if their thoughts or behaviors are severe, they may disrupt a personâs life. Treatment can help a person with NPD manage their symptoms and improve relationships with others."
