        "text": "“When I qualified in 1978, the expense of a family visit to London for an admissions ceremony was too much. “Being able to attend a ceremony in Cardiff, 46 years after I received my original admissions certificate signed by the master of rolls at the time, Lord Denning, means a great deal to me.” 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿✨ Huw Williams, chief legal advisor at the Senedd Cymru, celebrated his success at our Cardiff admissions ceremony, 46 years after being admitted to the roll of solicitors. ⚖️ Having brought along his original certificate, Huw was presented with another admissions certificate by our president, Nick Emmerson. 👏 Speaking on the day, Huw said: “I found it moving to share the occasion with a such a diverse group of solicitors and to hear about their journeys into the law. “On a personal note, it was a joy to attend the ceremony alongside Nicola Harries, from the legal department of the Welsh government, who the last NQ solicitor I mentored in private practice. “I would encourage other senior lawyers who didn't attend a ceremony when they were originally admitted and to take the opportunity to do so now.” 🌟 Whether you qualified years – or even decades – ago, it’s never too late to celebrate your success at an admissions ceremony! Mark the occasion with the friends and family who have supported you along the way. 🥳 Book your admissions ceremony: https://ow.ly/TxR650T4JIu\n\nFrom winning an Olympic gold medal to commercial sports law at Bird & Bird, Georgie Twigg MBE is the gold standard 🥇 Here’s more on Georgie’s unconventional yet accomplished legal journey, which started whilst studying law at Bristol University 🔽 “During my second year, I got an unexpected call from the GB women’s (hockey) head coach asking me to come and trial with the senior team. “I didn’t want to waste my degree, but this opportunity was too big to turn down. The university suggested I spread my final year across two years. “Training days could be quite jam-packed, and I would just have to fit my studies in around my training schedule. “Some people said I was mad trying to finish a law degree while training for the Olympics. “I graduated and competed in my first Olympics in the same summer.” Georgie went on to win bronze at London 2012, and gold at Rio 2016 👏 “I started my training contract a week after returning from Rio, which was certainly a bit of a shock to the system. Now, Georgie works predominantly on sports-related commercial matters. She reflects on her experience in hockey serving her well in law: “You learn to work in a team, develop leadership skills, manage conflict and know how to take criticism. Having an athlete’s perspective is sometimes helpful with my legal practice... “I feel lucky to have experienced so much and I’m very proud of what I’ve accomplished in both sport and law.” Read more about Georgie’s amazing sports to solicitor story here: https://ow.ly/wygB50T0ZEM Photo credits: Ady Kerry QEP (left), Bird & Bird (right)\n\n“At school, a teacher told me that I shouldn’t even try for a career in law as it was meant for other people.” Despite facing prejudice, Rudi Ramdarshan’s career into law was driven by his strong sense of justice. Now, Rudi sits as a partner at Ronald Fletcher Baker LLP ⚖️ Here are some memorable career highlights that have been led by his sense of justice ⬇️ “Being at a small firm was the best training I could have hoped for. I had to learn and hone my skills quickly to deal with complex cases with serious consequences... “My sense of justice and fairness gained from that work continued when I moved seats to litigation working alongside Mr Stanley Saffer.” After this experience, Rudi qualified in litigation and not long after was made a partner. “I am particularly proud of helping the Bloomsbury Institute in its challenge against the Office for Students. Many of its students are from disadvantaged backgrounds. Refusal of registration would have effectively closed the institution. \"I was able to obtain a decision-making guidance document that the Court of Appeal had found was unlawful, reversing the decision and rescuing the Institute. “Helping the Ahmeds in the Supreme Court (Lifestyle Equities v Ahmed) was the highlight of my career. It meant unpacking 150 years’ worth of settled case law. The case was a special moment for me as it was an expression of the ‘network of teams’ approach between the clients, silks, junior barristers, and the partners and solicitors in my department. “Faced with a century of case law against you, sometimes the correct approach is to simply say ‘let’s go for it’.” 👏 Read his full story in the Law Society Gazette here: https://ow.ly/VPf250SZpbk\n\n“The best advice I can offer those aspiring to become a King’s Counsel (KC), is to take every available opportunity for advocacy.” ⚖️ Hussein Haeri KC, partner and co-head of international arbitration at Withers LLP, was the only solicitor-advocate appointed as a KC in 2024, out of seven who applied. Discover his story ⬇️ “Having grown up across three continents – working in international dispute resolution at an international law firm in London was an appealing course to pursue. After qualification, I joined an American firm in London where disputes lawyers regularly do their own advocacy. \"This meant I gained experience as an advocate coming up against senior opposing counsel in major international courts at a relatively early stage in my career. “It was only recently that I seriously considered applying for silk. I had just completed a hearing as co-counsel with a leading KC and he encouraged me to apply. “Based on my experience of working with and against many advocates from around the world, I have long considered the appointment of KC a hallmark of the highest standard of excellence for advocacy, so it was something I aspired to. “I started looking into the requirements and saw that I needed 12 recent cases where I had conducted substantial advocacy to meet the initial application threshold. I realised I had exactly 12 cases, from which 30 referees were required. “It can be more challenging for solicitors to meet the experience criteria. Barristers are focused on being in the courts and before tribunals, whereas solicitor-advocates additionally have to dedicate substantial time to the management of clients, teams and projects. “My advice for applying is to get as much advocacy experience as you can, as early as you can, even as a student - whether it’s in mooting, debating, declamations or other forms of public speaking. “Over the course of your career seek out and gain the experience, whether with submissions, rebuttals or examinations and cross-examinations. \"It is primarily in the furnace of hearings where your advocacy skills can be developed and honed to the highest level. “If advocacy is your priority, think about the areas of law you want to focus on, as some can allow for more experience and opportunities in practice. “Advocacy is ultimately the art of persuasion; it’s about identifying what is going to matter and then honing and calibrating in real time – skills you will need to display as a KC.\" Being a KC reflects that you are an elite advocate, equipped to deal with the most complex cases and are considered a leader in your field. 👏 Explore our resources on how you can become a KC: https://ow.ly/fn3M50SXGll\n\nLanguage has real impact. As lawyers, we are taught early in our training that a slight change of wording can fundamentally change how a statement is perceived, and the actions that follow. For years, we have defended our members working in immigration law as they were subject to questionable language in the media, in political debates, and in online conversations. As we reflect on the riots that took place last week, it is deeply saddening to see that these conversations, which have been misleading, derogatory, and inflammatory, have manifested into threats of physical violence. Lawyers who represent their clients are not only doing nothing wrong, but they are also doing exactly what they are supposed to do in playing their part in ensuring that the rule of law is upheld. Language and actions that unfairly undermine confidence in the independence of the legal profession, and potentially risk the safety of lawyers, ultimately undermines confidence in our entire justice system and the rule of law. No lawyer should be attacked for doing their job.\n\n“Solicitors have such a huge impact on the community, but when you’re an individual working away, sometimes you lose the perspective that you’re actually helping people. “To take a moment to recognise and reflect on our collective efforts is really important, not just to thank ourselves, but to inspire others.” 👏 Meet Jonathan Lafferty, one of our 2023 Legal Heroes winners! 🌟 Nominated for his work for a charity, set up to help those representing themselves in court, Jonathan was recognised for repeatedly putting himself on the front line to defend those who, without his help, would not be able to access proper legal support. Speaking on why he became a solicitor, Jonathan said: “I thought it would be a very intellectually challenging job, which it is, but I was also attracted to the advocacy aspect of it, which I’ve been grateful to pursue in my career. “A lot of my pro bono work focuses on being an advocate, standing up, speaking out and helping people.” Jonathan was just one of our brilliant 2023 winners, recognised for their lasting and tangible impact on the lives of others, their local communities and society. 💫 🏆 Our 2024 Legal Heroes will be announced this September!
