        "text": "Overview\n\nPLEASE ADVISE THE CLERK IF YOU ARE EXEMPT UNDER\n\nFLORIDA STATUTE 119.071\n\nWhen applying for a marriage license, both parties, age 18 and over, must be present.\n\nA Florida marriage license allows a couple to get married anywhere in Florida, regardless of the county the license was purchased from. If you are getting married outside of Florida, obtain the marriage license from the state where you will be married.\n\nState of Florida residents have the option of attending a premarital course from a registered provider, or waiting a 3-day mandatory time period before the marriage license becomes effective. An Online Premarital Course Provider Directory is available to assist you in locating a premarital course provider (see clerk for certificate requirements), or you will find a copy of this registry at any marriage service location. Non-Florida residents are exempt from any marriage license waiting period.\n\nMarriage License Identification Requirements:\n\nA valid federal or state government photo identification card is required and must provide the correct legal name, date of birth and signature of the applicant.\n\nTypes of photo identification cards accepted are:\n\nDriver License (U.S. State or Government)\n\nPassport\n\nU.S. Military identification\n\nState Identification Card (U.S. State or Government)\n\nAlien Registration Card\n\nIn accordance with State of Florida Statute, any person who has been issued a Social Security number shall provide their social security number during the marriage license application process. [Copies of the social security card are not needed, only the social security card number.] Any person who is not a citizen of the U.S. may provide either a Social Security number or an Alien Registration number, if one has been issued. If neither has been issued, another form of ID may be required.\n\nOther helpful information:\n\nBlood tests are not required.\n\nYou do not need to be a resident of this county or the State of Florida to obtain a Marriage license.\n\nMarriage licenses are for use within the State of Florida for sixty (60) days from the effective date.\n\nPrior to obtaining a marriage license, both parties must sign an affidavit indicating they have read the Family Law Handbook, which is available as an online resource through The Florida Bar Family Law Section in either English or Spanish. The Family Law Handbook is also available for viewing in the Clerk of Courts Marriage and One-Stop courthouse service locations.\n\nIf either applicant has been previously married, the exact date of the last divorce, death, or annulment must be provided.\n\nIf you have one, or more child(ren) together, who were born in the State of Florida, you must complete the Affirmation of Common Child(ren) Born in Florida form.\n\nTo expedite the Marriage License application process, complete, print, and bring the Marriage License Online Pre-Application, to any Broward County Marriage License office location listed on this page.\n\nRequirements for under-aged marriage license applicants\n\nApplicants who are at least 17 years of age:\n\nIn addition to the above listed requirements, the following documents must be presented when one or both of the applicants are within this age bracket:\n\nAny applicant under the age of eighteen (18) and at least seventeen (17) years of age must have the consent of both parents, or a legal guardian. If custody of such minor has been granted to one parent, original proof must be provided. You may obtain consent forms from this office. If one parent is deceased, a certified copy of the death certificate is required. Proof of age and parents identity is required. This may be done with a certified copy of the personâ€™s birth certificate. If the parent's names do not match, additional proof may be required.\n\nAdditionally, a person that is at least 17 years of age may marry only if the other party is no more than two years older.\n\nApplicants under 17 years of age: Per F.S. 741.04, Issuance of Marriage License we are prohibited from issuing a license to any person under 17 years of age."
