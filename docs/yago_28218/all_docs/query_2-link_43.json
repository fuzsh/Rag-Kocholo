        "text": "Kurt Brian Orr, 62, of New Lenox, Illinois, passed away suddenly on June 18, 2024 surrounded by loving family members. Born in Green Bay, Wisconsin on March 30, 1962, Kurt is the youngest child of parents, Meredith Kay Orr and Eula Gray Galford Orr. Two years later the family moved to Park Forest, Illinois, where Kurt grew up. In 1980, he graduated from Rich South High School, and went to college at Northern Illinois, graduating in 1984 with a Marketing degree. He also earned an MBA at DePaul, attending night school after starting work.\n\nIn December, 1988 Kurt married his former wife, Jody Gryczewski, and had three children: twins, Emmett and Abbie (1996) and Ninah (1998). \"Dad” was Kurt’s most cherished title, and he always strove to be the best father possible. Kurt was happy to see each now discovering their own way in the world. Kurt’s first job at IRI, a pioneer company in data-driven research, set the course for his career. He also used his marketing analytic skills at The Quaker Oats Company, The Zyman Group, Orbitz and Wilton Brands.\n\nHe developed a love for sports as a young boy. He bowled 200 in fifth grade and his sixth-grade team bowled one of the highest scores in the nation. The same year he competed in the local Little League baseball finals. Kurt also became a very good tennis player, winning the conference doubles event helping his high school team win the title, and also made the high school golf team. Kurt became a superfan of his Green Bay Packers and Chicago White Sox, regularly traveling across the country to see their games.\n\nFrom an early age Kurt was a happy soul, quick to launch the biggest smile you've ever seen and make close friends. Beginning with elementary school and team sports, then all-night poker games, regular golf trips and on-line poker games, those he’s known the longest became his best friends. Their bond and shared love were broken by neither time nor distance between them.\n\nKurt successfully survived brain cancer for over 13 years, never becoming a victim of his illness, but he was instead an active participant in life. Music continued to be a source of great pleasure to Kurt, and his relationships with friends and family remained healthy and vigorous. In the first years after diagnosis, Nikki Chura came into Kurt’s life and never left. Her love for Kurt was unconditional, providing needed emotional support and trusted counsel. They shared the family’s love for pets, particularly boxers, and together became avid birdwatchers with 8 backyard feeders. After 11 years together, they happily married April 1, 2023.\n\nKurt was preceded in death by his parents, and survived by his wife Nikki; children Abbie, Emmett and Ninah; sister Deborah Orr (Lakeland, Fla); brother, Bruce, wife Carol (Dallas, Tx); brother-in-law Andrew Chura, wife Tess, and their sons Jamie (Kelley) and Elliott (Homewood, Ill).\n\nServices are private. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in support of Kurt to the American Brain Tumor Association: https://www.abta.org/?campaign=470869\n\nArrangements entrusted to Chicagoland Cremation Options of Schiller Park, IL."
