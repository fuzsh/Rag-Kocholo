        "text": "The procedures to register a vehicle that has more than one owner or registrant (the person who the vehicle is or will be registered) are generally the same as registering (and title) a vehicle that has a single owner or registrant. You can find special instructions below.\n\nThe names on the vehicle registration and title can differ if\n\nthe registration and title show two different names, the owner (the name on the title certificate) must authorize the other person to register the vehicle by completing box 3 on the Vehicle Registration/Title Application (PDF) (MV-82) form.\n\nthe proof of ownership is a New York State title certificate in the name of the current owner, the title certificate is examined and returned to you at the DMV office.\n\nthe proof isn’t a New York State title certificate in the name of the current owner, we keep the proofs and mail a New York State title certificate to the owner within 90 days.\n\nThe required liability insurance and New York State Insurance ID card must display the name of the registrant, not the name of the owner.\n\nEither the registrant or the owner can bring the registration and title application to a local DMV office. The person who applies must show the original proofs of identity and date of birth for both the registrant and the owner.\n\nThere can be one or more owners. If there are more than two owners for a vehicle, you must complete Statement of Partnership or Joint Ownership (PDF) (MV-83T). Only the first two owners will appear on the title, and the third owner and beyond will be retained in our electronic records.\n\nYou can’t add a name to a current registration. You must apply for new registration and new vehicle plates in the two names.\n\nIf there is more than one name on the registration, you can apply for a registration amendment to remove one or more names from the registration. Complete the Vehicle Registration/Title Application (PDF) (MV-82) with the names of the registrants that remain, and show proofs of identity and date of birth. The fee is $3.\n\nMore than one person can own a vehicle, but to transfer ownership, only one of the owners is required to sign the title certificate.\n\nYou can’t add a name to a current title certificate. You must apply for a new title certificate that displays the two names. The current owner signs the title certificate to transfer the ownership to the two persons. The two persons must apply for a new title certificate."
