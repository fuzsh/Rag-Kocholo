        "text": "Margot Robbie and British film producer Tom Ackerley are going to be parents!\n\nIn July 2024, several sources confirmed to PEOPLE that the couple, who quietly married in 2016, are expecting their first child.\n\nAckerley and Robbie first met in 2013 on the set of the World War II drama Suite Française, where he was an assistant director and she was in front of the camera. They began dating the following year.\n\nIn 2014, the pair co-founded a production company alongside friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr. LuckyChap Entertainment has produced several films and television series, including I, Tonya, Birds of Prey and Barbie — all of which starred Robbie.\n\n\"[We spend] 24 hours a day [together],\" Ackerley told The Sunday Times in June 2024 when discussing how he and Robbie balance their personal and professional lives. \"It’s seamless. We don’t have a toggle on, toggle off. It’s all become one thing.\"\n\nSo, who is the Oscar-winning actress' husband? Here's everything to know about Tom Ackerley and his relationship with Margot Robbie.\n\nHe got his start on the set of Harry Potter\n\nBefore he started working behind the scenes on film sets, Ackerley got his start in the industry working as an extra in the first three installments of the Harry Potter films.\n\nRobbie is a \"massive\" fan of the series and spent her 13th birthday sipping tea and reading one of the novels. In an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel shared what Robbie called her \"most embarrassing photo.\"\n\n\"I'm drinking a cup of tea. I'm in bed. I'm clearly really enjoying myself, reading Harry Potter,\" she told Kimmel of the photo.\n\nThe actress also spoke about her husband's involvement in the films during a 2020 appearance on The Graham Norton Show. \"My husband is in the Harry Potter movies. I know, I was like, 'Had you told me sooner we would've been married very quickly,' \" Robbie joked. \"But he was an extra when he was a little kid — he was one of the Slytherin extras when Draco pushes some kids out of the way to see Buckbeak in the third book. He pushes my husband out of the way.\"\n\nHe works in the film industry\n\nFollowing his short stint in front of the camera, Ackerley went on to study at Godalming College in the U.K. and later entered the film industry behind the scenes.\n\nHe began his career working as a floor runner and set production assistant, before later working as an assistant director, according to the British Film Institute.\n\nHe met Robbie on set\n\nAckerley met his future wife in 2013 on the set of Suite Française, where he was working as a third assistant director. Robbie starred in the war-romance film alongside Michelle Williams. At the time, Robbie was not looking for a relationship when \"the best-looking guy in London\" caught her eye, as she recalled to Vogue in 2016.\n\n\"I was the ultimate single gal. The idea of relationships made me want to vomit,\" she said. \"And then this crept up on me. We were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, Oh, he would never love me back. Don't make it weird, Margot. Don't be stupid and tell him that you like him. And then it happened, and I was like, Of course we're together. This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before.\"\n\nThey got married in secret\n\nIn December 2016, Robbie and Ackerley tied the knot in a private ceremony on Australia's Gold Coast. The couple didn't publicly announce their engagement prior to the wedding.\n\nShortly after rumors swirled that the couple had exchanged vows, The Wolf of Wall Street star confirmed the news with a cheeky Instagram post giving her husband a kiss and showing off a ring on her finger.\n\nHe co-founded a production company with Robbie\n\nThe same year that Ackerley and Robbie began dating, they also went into business together. The couple were joined by Robbie's childhood friend Sophia Kerr and Ackerley's industry colleague Josey McNamara to create LuckyChap Entertainment in 2014.\n\nThe foursome all lived together in a London apartment during the early days of their company, which has gone on to produce award-winning movies including I, Tonya, Promising Young Woman and Barbie.\n\nAckerley opened up to MovieMaker magazine in 2020 about their goal to make female-focused films and amplify new voices. \"If we can be a company that curates new and emerging talent, and can bring them through and provide that platform to do bigger movies and studio movies, that's ideally what we want to do,\" he said.\n\nRobbie added: \"It's nice to be in business with people where I already know we're going to do life together anyway.\"\n\nIn November 2023, LuckyChap via Robbie was awarded producer of the year at Variety’s 2023 Power of Women gala. The actress, who had lost her voice, asked Ackerley and McNamara to read her acceptance speech to the audience. Unbeknownst to them, Robbie wrote some hilarious anecdotes.\n\n\"The three of us met on a film set in Belgium 10 years ago,\" Ackerley said. \"I was the third AD, Josey was the second AD and Margot had a small supporting role.\" McNamara chimed in: \"And a hideous wig.\"\n\n\"Yep. That wig was awful. She's lucky I ended up marrying her,\" Ackerley said with a laugh.\n\nThey postponed their honeymoon to work on I, Tonya\n\nInstead of going on a honeymoon after their wedding, the newly married couple went straight to work on I, Tonya.\n\n\"We did this film instead of our honeymoon. There were times we were sitting in a car parked in Atlanta freezing cold being like, 'We should be on a beach right now. We should be on a honeymoon. What are we doing?!' Following our dream,\" Robbie explained to Extra in 2017.\n\nOnce the movie wrapped, they did have time for a getaway together. \"We did it after we finished shooting. It was great,\" she said of their honeymoon in Tahiti.\n\nRobbie later discussed their trip during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2018, as the newlyweds had actually run into Degeneres and her wife Portia de Rossi in Tahiti — along with former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe actress recounted the hilarious interaction, explaining that during a rainy day, she and Ackerley decided to head to the hotel's gym, and Ackerley threw on a pair of somewhat revealing shorts. \"I was like, 'You cannot wear those shorts! They're like… you know, I can see everything,' \" Robbie recalled.\n\nThe pair thought the shorts would go unnoticed in the quiet gym — until they came across Degeneres, de Rossi and the former president.\n\n\"We then had to do this whole like stretching class, but Tom meanwhile is trying to like, not reveal anything, and he's dying,\" Robbie said. \"The gym instructor keeps saying to Tom, 'Tom, lunge! Lunge! You're not lunging!' and Tom's trying to lunge cross-legged.\"\n\nHe helps Robbie cope with nerves\n\nDespite receiving countless award nominations and plenty of praise from critics, the Australian actress still deals with self-doubt from time to time and turns to her husband for a confidence boost.\n\n\"I'm always nervous to start any job. I have this complete crisis of faith and think, 'Oh my gosh, I'm not even good at acting and I can't do this,' \" she told the Daily Mirror in 2021. \"Every time I do a movie, I turn to my husband and I'm like, 'I don't think I can do this'. He says something like, 'You do this every time. You'll be fine.' \"\n\nHe's afraid of snakes\n\nAckerley might be able to help his wife with the jitters, but when it comes to things like wildlife, he turns to her for support.\n\nGrowing up in Australia, the Bombshell actress is used to wildlife being around her house, but her English husband doesn't exactly share her ability to keep calm in a similar situation. During an appearance on The Late Late Show With James Corden, she explained, \"My husband hates snakes. He's English. You guys don't have them, obviously, at all in England, I guess.\"\n\nThe actress continued, \"I'm living in L.A. and there was a two-meter snake … just outside the kitchen, just in the garden the other day. [Ackerley] almost had a coronary. He was like, 'What do we do?! Do we kill it?!' And I was like, 'F--- no, we don't kill it. Just gently tell it to go somewhere else.' \"\n\nHe accompanied Robbie on the Barbie press tour\n\nIn June 2023, the cast of Barbie traveled around the globe to promote the film. Ackerley, a producer of the movie, appeared on the red carpet with Robbie in Korea, Australia and Los Angeles.\n\nHe walked the red carpet with Robbie at the Barbie premiere in July 2023\n\nThe couple were all smiles as they walked the red carpet at the world premiere of the Barbie movie in Los Angeles. Robbie channeled 1960s Barbie in a black strapless gown and shoulder-length gloves, and Ackerley looked like a modern-day Ken doll in a black tuxedo.\n\nHe and Robbie are going to be parents"
