RIP Deborah.\"\n\nKatharine Viner, editor-in-chief of the Guardian, said Orr was \"a brilliant, clever, funny writer and editor whose uncompromising and insightful approach to her work brought powerful journalism to the Guardian over many years.\"\n\nJournalist and broadcaster Mariella Frostrup noted how Orr had been making plans for a future she knew she probably wouldn't see.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .
