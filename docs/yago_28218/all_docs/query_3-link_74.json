When joining, have your valid IDs and debit or credit card payment ready.

Sign the document and send it back via mail, or use the Clerk and Recorder drop box in front of the Webb Municipal Building (near 15th St and Court Pl). This drop box is checked daily during normal business hours.\n\nPlan ahead: You must sign the license in Colorado within 35 days from the date of issue. The license must be returned for recording within 63 days of marriage to avoid extra fees. For more information, please check the instructions in the packet you receive during your appointment.\n\nYou may marry in front of a judge, through a religious ceremony, or by self-solemnizing (signing the certificate yourselves).\n\nThe certificate must be signed in Colorado within 35 days from the date the license was issued.\n\nThe completed marriage certificate (and attached license) must be returned to the Clerk and Recorder for recording within 63 days after solemnization. After that date, late fees will apply.\n\nBlood tests are not required in Colorado, and there is no waiting period.\n\nApplicants need not be Colorado residents. However, couples obtaining a marriage license online must have a Colorado address to receive their application and license via mail.\n\nPaw prints are not allowed on marriage licenses.\n\nQuestions you will be asked:\n\nThe date that you are getting married\n\nWhere you are marrying (license only valid in Colorado)\n\nThe exact date and location of your divorce or previous spouse's death, if applicable. Both parties must be able to provide this information. If you were previously in a civil union and are marrying someone else, you must provide the name of your partner in the civil union.\n\nYour relationship if related by blood\n\nThe city and state where parents of both parties were born\n\nBoth you and your intended spouse must present one of these valid forms of identification:\n\nU.S. state-issued driver's license or permit\n\nU.S. state-issued ID\n\nU.S. military ID\n\nPassport that includes the English language, or passport with a certified English language translation\n\nThe name on the license will appear exactly as it is on the identification provided to us.\n\nYou are required to provide a Social Security Number if you have one. If one of the parties does not have a Social Security Number, they are not required to have one to get married.\n\nBirth certificates, baptismal certificates and Foreign Consular IDs are not acceptable forms of identification for marriage or civil union licenses. A birth certificate may be used to confirm date of birth when presented along with one of the valid forms of identification listed above.\n\nSolemnization by an Officiant\n\nYour marriage must be solemnized, then the marriage application and certificate must be recorded.\n\nA marriage may be solemnized by an officiant who has been ordained or recognized by a religious denomination, a judge of a court, a retired judge, a court magistrate, a public official whose powers include solemnization of marriages, a Native American tribal official or a friend or relative who is ordained.\n\nClergy ordained out of state do not need to be registered in Colorado to perform a wedding.\n\nDenver County Court maintains a list of judges(PDF, 169KB) who perform weddings during the week, on weekends, and in the evenings.\n\nThe solemnizing official will complete your marriage certificate.\n\nSelf-Solemnization\n\nYou and your intended spouse may solemnize your own marriage. Neither witnesses nor officiant are required for a valid self-solemnization. Proxy marriages may not be self solemnized.\n\nOther Important Information\n\nThe marriage license and marriage certificate are two distinct instruments that appear on the single form. Please do not separate them. The marriage certificate must be recorded no later than 63 days from the date of solemnization, or late fees will apply.\n\nUse our instruction sheet as a guide for completing the marriage certificate:\n\nMarriage Certificate Instructions(PDF, 500KB)\n\n( en espa√±ol(PDF, 475KB))\n\nIf you are widowed, divorced, or your civil union has been dissolved, and you wish to apply for a new marriage license, you must provide the exact date (month, day and year) and location of your divorce or spouse's/partner's death. If you were in a civil union with another person, you must have dissolved that civil union to marry a different person. You will need to provide the name of your previous partner on the marriage application.\n\nIf you are divorced, you also must provide:\n\nthe location (city and state) of your divorce;\n\nthe type (district, superior, circuit, etc.) of court in which your divorce proceeding occurred; and\n\na certified copy of your divorce decree if your divorce was final within 30 days preceding the date you apply for a marriage license.\n\nA certified verification of your divorce can be obtained at the Office of Vital Record or the Denver District Court.\n\nNote: If you obtained a civil union license and wish to be married, you must apply for a marriage license, complete the process, and pay the $30 license fee. The civil union does not need to be dissolved if you are marrying the same person. If you wish to marry a different person, the civil union must first be dissolved before the marriage can take place.\n\nThe Office of the Clerk and Recorder does not process dissolutions of marriages or civil unions and does not keep records of these events. Contact the Denver District Court for information about divorces.\n\nFor information about dissolutions of committed partnerships, see our Frequently Asked Questions."
