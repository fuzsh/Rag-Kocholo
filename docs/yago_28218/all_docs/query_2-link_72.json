        "text": "Journalist Deborah Orr was born and bred in the Scottish steel town of Motherwell, in the west of Scotland.\n\nGrowing up the product of a mixed marriage, with an English mother and a Scottish father, she was often a child on the edge of her working class community, a 'weird child', who found solace in books, nature and in her mother's company.\n\nBut her mother's shadow was long and often controlling - Deborah was not always mothered well.\n\nIn her powerful and poignant memoir, she explores the effects of her strict parenting and her own strong desire for independence and autonomy which led her to flee her roots, first to St Andrews University, with mixed results, and then to her hugely successful career as a journalist and writer in London.\n\nDeborah also paints a vivid portrait of the place and the community around the steel works of Ravenscraig - the hub of her world in the sixties and seventies.\n\nOmnibus of five parts abridged by Julian Wilkinson.\n\nRead by Siobhan Redmond.\n\nProducers:: Karen Holden & Di Speirs\n\nFirst broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in January 2020."
