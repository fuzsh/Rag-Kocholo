        "text": "I don't know if you saw The Observer last weekend, but there were the most gorgeous photos in the colour supplement of Will Self, his three children and his wife, the journalist Deborah Orr. Taking a tip from Tony Blair, perhaps, this was a serious re-branding: no more the junkie stud, instead the funky dad. Rugged Will, blonde Debs, sun-kissed boy and girl kiddies, and gorgeous, bouncing baby - they resembled what an advert for Sunny Delight might look like if Sunny Delight decided to aim itself at people who holiday in Kerala and know what \"frottage\" means.\n\nI felt there was something odd about these photos, and I kept gazing at them looking for clues. It took two days of puzzling over them before I tumbled: though he looked as certifiably, teeth-grindingly sexy as ever, I was free. For the first time in 10 years, I didn't fancy Will Self!\n\nTo get the full clout of this, you've got to understand what Will Self represented, sexually, in the 90s. Despite his drug and alcohol intake, to us London media babes he was a sexual icon packing the oomph of Jimi Hendrix, Robbie Williams and Gordon Brown all rolled into one. Every man wanted to be him and every woman wanted to have him. They usually did, too. At one time, I had three different friends whom he slept with for the first time on the same day. To add insult to injury, they all then proceeded to ring me up and tell me that they were having a passionate affair with him, he was The One, it was true love - the whole works. I soon put those bitches right, let me tell you - in a caring way, of course, as Dame Edna would say.\n\nSo it was horribly vulgar and predictable for me to fall for Will, like saying your favourite film is Casablanca or your favourite Opal Fruit is strawberry. For years, I just looked at him across crowded rooms - you couldn't miss him; he was so tall and prehistoric-looking - until one night he followed my husband and I home, and showed us how to smoke crack. I'll never forget what a thrill it was being bossed about by him - now cut a hole in the Evian bottle, now stick the straw in there; like some depraved Blue Peter presenter - and I'll never forget how he looked when it hit him: slumped on my black leather sofa, with just one big juicy tear coursing down his left cheekbone. I was lost.\n\nSad, sad, sad; I took to calling his home when I knew he was out, just to hear his voice on the answerphone - sometimes, and this is really weird, I'd call his answerphone from my bedroom when he was sitting drinking vodka in my front room. The reality of him seemed too much to grasp; I was happier with the unreal thing. I was so chronically embarrassed by the predictability of my crush that I even took to inventing false crushes to put people off the trail. But I'm sure I didn't convince anyone. It's the name-dropping that does it, I always think. The search-engine of my mind was primed, and from that moment any word typed in, from AZTEC to ZEBRA, would have come up with one answer: WILL SELF. I had a truly amazing capability to turn any subject of conversation around to him - even with my parents, who, of course, didn't know him from Adam. My mum would be talking about the dog's flatulence problem - and I could turn it on a sixpence right round to Will. No problem.\n\nAfter a couple of years, I felt I had to tell someone, so I went to my best friend's school at 10 in the morning, saying that I was her aunt and that there had been a death in the family. I dragged her to the Groucho, and told her everything while she sat there in her school uniform with her mouth open, the two of us looking like some corny Hogarthian print about innocence and corruption, as Jeffrey Bernard told me later. Three hours later, I staggered from the bar into the foyer where I walked slap-bang into Will, who gave me the biggest hug and the saddest smile I've ever seen. Somehow, I walked out the door and round the corner into Old Compton Street, where I fainted, and I'm not the type who faints. When I woke up, I burst into tears. In the taxi on the way home, I realised I was becoming a mentalist. Truly, this is the nearest I think I've ever been to going nuts.\n\nSo perhaps a life without crushes won't be such a bad thing, and no one can say that it's not about time. I did notice while on holiday with my boyfriend's mum last month that, though the Corsican men were well fit, I wasn't interested in any of them. I thought this was really good of me, and I told Mrs Raven about my lack of reaction, thinking I'd get praise. Instead, she laughed scornfully and said, \"I should hope not, at your age!\" That hurt. So at least I'll be able to do dignified now. But, on the other hand, being a crushee is one of the few ways I can access my essential self, and it's not as if there are so many that I can afford to lose them.\n\nI've always had crushes on people, really big bastards of crushes. I still remember the first crush I had, when I was four, on my friend Joy (an unexceptional lump, as I recall, whose miserable aspect chronically contradicted her given name), who I would prevent from leaving my house by lying across the threshold and crying. When I was 10, I had to stop watching Dad's Army because I had crushes on three of them - the spiv, the toff and the virgin - and found it too confusing. One reason I've always enjoyed the prospect of falling in love and getting married is because the dull routine of marriage lends itself so perfectly to the agony of the illicit crush. I got through the sexual side of my first marriage - for six years! - by pretending that my husband was my friend Peter York. And people say I don't have any imagination! For those of you outside the slimy boundaries of Mediaville, who can't conjure up either image, let's just say it was a lot like pretending Arthur Mullard was George Sanders.\n\nMy second husband was a really popular guy - which was great, because he had loads of friends who I could conceive huge crushes on. And often they had lovely girlfriends, who I could get gay crushes on, too! The Modern Review, my little magazine, provided endless crush fodder in the shape of young would-be writers - most of whom thought I was a stuck-up bitch because I wouldn't speak to them from one year to the next, lest my crush be detected. But still, Will loomed over my second marriage, lurked throughout my very enjoyable six months of lesbianism, and has seen considerable active service in my rich and strange inner life over the years since then.\n\nAnd now? Nothing. I know it's a good thing, growing up, but I shall miss being crushed. Still, like Will himself, I'm taking it one day at a time."
