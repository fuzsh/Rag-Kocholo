        "text": "The complaint is reviewed for possible violations of the licenseeâ€™s practice act. If a violation may have occurred it is investigated and referred to the Prosecution Services Unit for a determination of probable cause. If probable cause is found, the case is referred to the board for disciplinary action; 10 days after an administrative complaint is filed the case becomes public. If probable cause is not found, the case is closed and remains confidential.\n\nComplaints can be filed against any health care practitioner or facility licensed by the Department of Health. Complaints can also be filed against any individual or facility providing health care services without a valid Florida license. Information on Regulated Professions\n\nComplaints remain confidential until 10 days after probable cause is found. If probable cause is not found, the case will remain confidential. Patient identity and patient records always remain confidential.\n\nComplaints against licensed practitioners or facilities cannot be filed over the phone. Florida law requires the complaint be signed. However, you may file an unlicensed activity complaint over the phone by calling 1-877-HALT-ULA.\n\nYes, generally the statute of limitations (SOL) is six years from the last date of treatment.

For more information regarding statute of limitations, section 456.073(13), FS., please visit this site: 456.073(13)\n\nIf the licensee is disciplined, the department or regulatory board may impose one or more of the following penalties:\n\nreprimand\n\nfine\n\nrestriction of practice\n\ncontinuing education probation\n\nsuspension\n\nrevocation\n\nThe department may enter into an alternative to discipline action which includes mediation or citation.\n\nThe person filing the complaint and the health care practitioner will be notified periodically, in writing, of the status of the complaint. (It is important the department be advised of any address change.)\n\nYes. However, if we do not receive enough information to move forward with an investigation, the complaint will be closed. Also, you cannot be updated as to the status of the complaint.\n\nBefore filing a complaint with the department, please send a certified letter to your doctor requesting your medical records. The signed green card will be your proof of requesting your medical records. If you have not received the requested records after 30 business days, please file a complaint and include a copy of the letter and a copy of the signed green card to our office. Be sure to keep a copy of everything for your records."
