        "text": "Deborah Rae (Hutchison) Orr\n\nDec 30, 1954-March 07, 2017\n\nBorn in Downey, California; Debbie spent her youth and most of her early adult life in her childhood home. The youngest of William Stewart and Elnore Marie Hutchison, she was a free-spirited child. She loved music and learned to play the accordion at a young age. She had her 3 children by the time she was 20 and at 23, she met the love of her life, Tim Orr. They were married in June of 1981 and lived nearly 36 wonderful years together.\n\nThe majority of their life was spent in Southern California raising her 3 children, Christine Marie, Charles Wade and Lesley Lynne. Tim and Debbie loved going to the beach, sailing on their boat, and helping raise their first grandchild. She also loved going to Disneyland. She had such a child-like spirit and found joy in simple things.\n\nDebbie was a Jill of all trades. She had many different jobs that ranged from a nursing assistant, to an engineer, microwave repairman, manager and assembly worker. She retired at 51 when she and her husband moved to Bastrop, TX.\n\nShe found her home in her senior community. She was very active in the Bastrop Senior Center where she was on the board as the Activities Director. She spent most of her days volunteering at the center, serving lunches, planning fun activities and she made the Veteran's Wall, a memorial to all the seniors who served our country.\n\nShe loved to craft. She was very creative and found joy in making all kinds of things: wreaths, crochet, working in plastic canvas, and sewing. She had a talent for making everything larger-than-life. She added bling to anything she did and her creations were one-of-a-kind.\n\nHer volunteer work in her community was impressive. In addition to all her Senior Center work, she also gave her time to Pink Santa, an organization that collected and distributed toys to needy children in her community. She was also part of an outreach program that made clothing for poor children in other countries, spending countless hours at the sewing machine.\n\nShe was an avid Red Hatter. She loved being larger-than-life and this was a perfect outlet for her. She attended teas, parties, Bridge-Spitting ceremonies, and was Queen Debbie-Do of her own chapter. She had an entire room devoted to her hats and she had a different one for every occasion.\n\nTim and Debbie had so many plans for the future which included a beach life, spending more time with their grandchildren and helping to raise their new great-grandchild. She was stolen away too soon. And she will be missed more than words can ever express.\n\nDebbie is survived by her husband of nearly 36 years, Tim Orr; 2 older sisters, Carolle and Patti; Christine Sheets (daughter), Charles Wade Sheets (son), Jennifer Sheets (daughter-in-law), Lesley Schell (daughter) and Steve Schell (son-in-law); 10 grandchildren, Scott Polsley, Andrew Pereira, Stephen Thomas Schell, Katlyn Sheets, Matthew Schell, Beth Schell, Timmy Schell, Olivia Sheets, Josh Schell and Jacob Schell; and a great-grandchild, Greyson Polsley. She is also survived by a great extended family and many friends who love and miss her dearly.\n\n~Gone But Never Forgotten~"
