        "text": "What is factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA)?\n\nWhen someone has this mental illness, they might act as though their child or dependent has a medical condition that needs attention. However, the child or dependent person isn’t sick. People with factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA) lie about an illness in another person. This other person is usually someone in their care — often a child under the age of 6. In some cases, the dependent person can be another adult, disabled person or an elderly person.\n\nPreviously called Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy, factitious disorder imposed on another is one type of factitious disorder. Another type of factitious disorder involves making up false medical conditions about yourself. Factitious disorders are considered mental illnesses because they’re associated with severe emotional difficulties.\n\nWhether the false medical claims are about someone else or yourself, this condition can be dangerous. It can lead to unnecessary medical tests and even procedures while the healthcare team tries to figure out what’s wrong with the patient. When a child is involved, FDIA is considered a form of child abuse by the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat is the motivation behind factitious disorder imposed on another?\n\nThere may be many different reasons why someone with factitious disorder imposed on another might seek unnecessary medical treatment for a child or dependent. Often, people with FDIA have an inner need for their child (or other dependent person) to be seen as ill or injured. This isn’t done to achieve a concrete benefit, like financial gain. It’s is often done in order to gain the sympathy and special attention given to people who are truly ill and their families.\n\nWho is most likely to have factitious disorder imposed on anther (FDIA)?\n\nFDIA is most often see in mothers — although it can also happen with fathers — who intentionally harm or describe non-existent symptoms in their children to get the attention given to the family of someone who is sick. A person with FDIA uses the many hospitalizations as a way to earn praise from others for their devotion to the child's care, often using the sick child as a means for developing a relationship with the doctor or other healthcare provider.\n\nThere are certain characteristics that are common in a person with FDIA, including:\n\nBeing a parent, usually a mother, but the person can also be the adult child of an elderly patient, spouse or caretaker of a disabled adult.\n\nSometimes being a healthcare professional or having medical knowledge.\n\nBeing very friendly and cooperative with the healthcare providers.\n\nAppearing to be quite concerned — some might seem overly concerned — about their child or designated patient.\n\nPossibly also suffering from factitious disorder imposed on self. This is a related disorder in which the caregiver repeatedly acts as if he or she has a physical or mental illness when he or she has caused the symptoms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow common is factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA)?\n\nThere are no reliable statistics regarding the number of people in the United States who suffer from FDIA, and it is difficult to assess how common the disorder is because many cases go undetected. However, estimates suggest that about 1,000 of the 2.5 million cases of child abuse reported annually are related to FDIA.\n\nIn general, FDIA occurs more often in women than in men.\n\nWas factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA) previously called Munchausen syndrome by proxy?\n\nYes. In the past, factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA) was called Munchausen syndrome by proxy. This name referred to a figure named Baron Munchausen who was known for exaggerated stories. The change from Munchausen syndrome by proxy to factitious disorder imposed on another provides a more accurate description of a person’s behavior. This new name is more specific.\n\nFDIA is a type of factitious disorder — a mental health condition where the person lies about either their own medical conditions or those of someone they care for in order to earn praise and attention. There are two main types of factious disorders:\n\nFactitious disorder imposed on self.\n\nFactitious disorder imposed on another.\n\nWhat causes factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA)?\n\nThe exact cause of FDIA isn’t known, but researchers believe both biological and psychological factors play a role in the development of this disorder. Some theories suggest that a history of abuse or neglect as a child or the early loss of a parent might be factors in its development. Some evidence suggests that major stress, such as marital problems, can trigger an FDIA episode.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA)?\n\nAn adult with FDIA often will not leave the bedside of their child or person they’re caring for. They’ll also discuss in detail the symptoms and care that’s been provided. This is typically used as evidence that he or she is a good caretaker and is doing a thorough job. If the symptoms go away when the patient is in the hospital, they’ll likely return when the caretaker with FDIA is alone with the child at home.\n\nSome other possible warning signs of FDIA can include:\n\nThe child or dependent person having a history of many hospitalizations. Often, there will also be a strange set of symptoms.\n\nThe child or dependent person’s symptoms generally being reported by the mother (or other caretaker with FDIA) and not being witnessed by hospital staff.\n\nThe child or dependent person’s condition and symptoms not matching the results of diagnostic tests.\n\nThe child or dependent person’s condition improving in the hospital, but the symptoms recurring once they go home.\n\nBlood in lab samples not matching the blood of the child or dependent person.\n\nThe child or dependent person possibly having signs of chemicals in the blood, stool or urine.\n\nThere might also be a history of one or more unusual illnesses or deaths of children in the family.\n\nHow is factitious disorder imposed on another diagnosed?\n\nDiagnosing FDIA is very difficult because of the dishonesty that’s involved. Healthcare provider’s must rule out any possible physical illness as the cause of the child's symptoms, and often use a variety of diagnostic tests and procedures before considering a diagnosis of FDIA in the adult caregiver.\n\nIf a physical cause of the symptoms is not found, a thorough review of the child's medical history, as well as a review of the family history and the caregiver’s medical history (many have factitious disorder imposed on self) might provide clues to suggest FDIA. Often, the individual with FDIA may have other comorbid psychiatric disorders.\n\nRemember, it’s the adult, not the child, who is diagnosed with FDIA. The most important or helpful part of the workup is the review of all old records that can be obtained. Unfortunately, this time-consuming but critical task is often forgotten and the diagnosis is missed. Healthcare providers will ask Child Protective Services, and the Legal Department for help reviewing the facts.\n\nHow is factitious disorder imposed on another treated?\n\nOne of the biggest concerns in cases of FDIA is the safety of the child or dependent person. Ensuring their safety is important and this often involves placing them in the care of someone else. This can take a team of people to accomplish, including:\n\nSocial workers.\n\nFoster care organizations.\n\nLaw enforcement.\n\nHealthcare providers.\n\nIt’s difficult to successfully treat people with FDIA because they often deny that there’s a problem. Success can be dependent on catching the person in the act or the person telling the truth. However, people with FDIA tend to be such accomplished liars that they start to have trouble telling fact from fiction.\n\nOne type of treatment is psychotherapy. A type of counseling, psychotherapy focuses on changing the thinking and behavior of the individual with the disorder (cognitive-behavioral therapy). The goal of therapy for FDIA is to help the person identify the thoughts and feelings that are contributing to the behavior, and to learn to form relationships that are not associated with being ill.\n\nWhat are the complications of factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA)?\n\nFactitious disorder imposed on another can lead to serious short- and long-term complications, including:\n\nContinued abuse.\n\nMultiple hospitalizations.\n\nDeath of the victim.\n\nResearch suggests that the death rate for victims of FDIA is about 10%. In some cases, a child victim of FDIA learns to associate getting attention to being sick and develops factitious disorder imposed on self.\n\nConsidered a form of child abuse, FDIA is a criminal offense."
