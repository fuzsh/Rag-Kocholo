        "text": "Annulment basics\n\nYou must give a reason why your marriage wasn't legal from the start\n\nA judge can only annul a marriage for a specific legal reason. A few examples\n\nOne of the spouses is married to another person (bigamy)\n\nYou got married when you were under 18 and it wasn't legal to do so\n\nYour spouse tricked you to get you to agree to marry them\n\nA very short marriage is not a legal reason for an annulment. There are at least 8 legal reasons a judge can annul a marriage.\n\nEven if you and your spouse agree to the annulment, you will have to go in front of a judge to explain why your marriage was never legal to begin with.\n\nIn an annulment, you may not be able to get spousal support or divide your property. Talk to a lawyer or get more information from your court's Self-Help Center.\n\nA judge can only divide your property or order spousal support if one of you thought your marriage was legal\n\nUnlike in a divorce or legal separation, in an annulment a judge can't always divide your property and debts or order spousal support.\n\nA judge can only do this if they find that one of you is a putative spouse. A putative spouse is someone who in good faith believed their marriage was legal.\n\nIf you can prove you are a putative spouse, you can ask the judge to divide your property and debts, and order spousal support. The person who isn't a putative spouse can't ask the judge to do either.\n\nIn an annulment, if there's no putative spouse, a judge can't divide your property and debts or order spousal support. If you need either, talk to a lawyer who can offer advice on what's best for your situation.\n\nYou can get orders about the care and support of your children\n\nIf you have children together, you may need to establish that the other person is your child's legal parent (called establishing parentage). Then, the judge can make orders about child custody, visitation (parenting time), and support.\n\nYou don't need to meet the divorce residency requirement or have a waiting period\n\nNo 6-month residency requirement: You do not need to have lived in California for 6 months and 3 months in the county where you file to start the process. You just need to live in California when you file."
