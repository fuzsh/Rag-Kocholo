        "text": "Deborah Orr, who has died of cancer aged 57, was an award-winning radical journalist who inspired, and was greatly admired by, her friends and colleagues in the press.\n\nAs a columnist, mainly for The Guardian and The Independent, she was a fierce campaigner for social justice, protesting in a typically forthright article in 2017 at the way in which, “mesmerised” by the continuing Brexit saga, Britain had become oblivious to problems on its own doorstep and the government had become gripped by a “terrible paralysis”.\n\n“Homeless people are stuck in the streets once again,” she wrote. “The services of food banks have never been more in demand. People with mental and physical illnesses or disabilities are dying for want of care, or even heat. The National Health Service has been plunged into a financial and staffing crisis … ”\n\nShe often drew on her own experience. In 2001 she recounted (in an Independent article also published in The Daily Telegraph) a violent tussle with a hooded female intruder and its aftermath: “I feel sad for her, but I’m glad we caught her … I want to meet her, try to get her to understand how it feels to have such a violation visited on one’s home and one’s children …\n\n“Almost certainly, she needs to do herself two favours. She must get off drugs and she must brush up her English. How good it would be to believe that in our penal system these things are easily arranged. But they’re not.”\n\nDeborah Orr had not had the easiest of lives. In a memoir, Motherwell; a Girlhood, to be published next year, she described her struggles to escape the confines of her working-class upbringing. More recently, she laid bare the details of her private battles with metastatic breast cancer, and with her estranged husband, the novelist Will Self, in a series of sad but funny tweets that won her a loyal following on Twitter. When writing about herself, however, her ruthless honesty was always alleviated by self-deprecating humour.\n\nDeborah Jane Orr was born at Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, on September 23 1962, to a Scottish father and English mother, parents who, as she put it, made “so many self-centred demands … during their lives that I have literally written a book about it. (Motherwell, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, all good bookshops, March 2020.)”\n\nDuring the 1950s her father, John, had moved to England, where he worked as a postman and met and married “a bright and beautiful girl from rural Essex”, Win, née Avis. But he could not adapt to southern ways and by the time that Deborah, the elder of their two children, was born, they had returned to Motherwell, where John found a job with Anderson Boyes, manufacturers of machinery for the coal industry.\n\nDeborah did not hate their home, a tenement flat, but hated “the glass-strewn play area, where you had to check the slide in case other kids had smeared the innards of blown-up frogs – or worse – on it” and “the constant threat of intimidation from older, tougher kids”: “If there was one building, during my childhood, that I truly adored, it was Motherwell Library,” she recalled. “For me, its very walls were suffused with all the grandest ideals that civilisation cherished.”\n\nWhen Deborah was 11 the tenement block was demolished and the family moved into a new high-rise “scheme”. Deborah was sent to be educated at Garrion Academy, Wishaw, where she was berated for the “unbearable pretension” of her English accent.\n\nThough she did well at school, her mother continually undermined her attempts to assert her own identity. Deborah’s solution was to keep secret those aspects of her life which she knew would not gain approval, but her defiance came at great emotional cost in feelings of guilt and in the yawning gap between her and her parents that could never be bridged.\n\nShe began her career writing for the New Statesman and for City Limits magazine, a London listings title set up as a workers’ cooperative in 1981 in opposition to Time Out, and where she became deputy editor. But she found it seethed with “victimhood, resentment, factionalism, incompetence and silliness” and resigned in 1990 to join the Guardian.\n\nIn 1993 she became the first female editor of its Weekend magazine and later its literary editor. In 1999 she moved to The Independent as a columnist, but returned to The Guardian in 2009, writing a column for the paper for nearly a decade. In 2018 she joined the i newspaper.\n\nShe also co-created the play Enquirer, which was shortlisted in 2012 for New Play of the Year in the Critics’ Awards for Theatre in Scotland.\n\nDeborah Orr could be somewhat forbidding, but one of her editors has recalled that while she was “slightly terrifying to commission”, it was worth it for the “joy of getting her scintillating copy back”."
