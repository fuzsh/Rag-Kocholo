This determination is contingent upon you submitting any required documentation and passing validation of the information you provide.\n\nIf you do not submit required documentation before the 25-day deadline, your residency status changes from resident to non-resident.\n\nRDS validates information you provide with federal and state agencies. Should the information you provide not validate, your residency status changes from resident to non-resident.\n\nIn addition to your residency determination status, RDS provides you a Residency Certification Number (RCN) and a summary of the information you enter.\n\nFor reconsideration and appeal requests, RDS staff must review the request in full before providing a residency status. RDS can review your request only after you provide all your required documents. If your required documents are not submitted before the 25-day deadline, your request is cancelled and your residency status remains non-resident.\n\nYou can get help within the RDS online interview by looking for the \"?\" within the blue circle beside each question for an additional explanation of what information is needed or how to proceed from that point within the RDS online interview. If you are having technical difficulties, or cannot find an answer online, you may call the toll free number at 844.319.3640 or the local number at 919.835.2290 to speak with an RDS customer service representative. The customer service hours are Monday - Thursday from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM and Fridays from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM.\n\nIn most cases, no, an annual review is not necessary. If you are admitted as a resident and charged in-state tuition by any North Carolina college, it is likely that you will maintain that tuition status unless there is change of circumstances which may be reason for an updated review. When there is a change of circumstance, for example, if your parents move to another state, students in this situation may qualify for a \"grace period\" for tuition during which the in-state rate will still be applicable even though the student is no longer a legal resident of North Carolina. The grace period can apply under certain circumstances both to currently enrolled students as well as to students who are no longer enrolled or who have graduated. The grace period does not apply to state funded financial aid. Grace periods are handled at the campus level.\n\nAs a high school student seeking CCP admission to a community college, you do not need a residency determination. When you graduate from high school and apply to college, you need to have an RDS residency determination. If you graduate from high school and college at the same time as a CCP student, you do not need an RDS residency determination unless you continue your education by seeking another community college degree or certification, or a bachelor's degree at another public college or university.\n\nWe value your trust and understand handling your confidential information with care is of utmost importance. As a result, RDS takes the security of your information very seriously. RDS utilizes advanced technology to ensure any data received and stored is safe, secure and available to only authorized users.\n\nHosted in a secure server environment, RDS uses firewalls and other advanced technologies to prevent interference or access from outside intruders, including:\n\nComputer anti-virus software that detects and prevents viruses from entering the computer network systems\n\nDefense in Depth technology such as firewalls that block unauthorized access by individuals or networks\n\nEncryption software such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to protect the data you input from unauthorized access by third parties when in route between your browser and the RDS servers and when in route between the RDS servers and some other browser or server\n\nPassword protection to ensure that access is provided only to you, anyone to whom you entrust the password and those RDS staff who require such access to administer the Service, and\n\nExternal security assessments and vulnerability scans used to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities within the system\n\nData destruction procedures to ensure your information is removed from our systems as soon as possible according to the RDS Data Destruction Policy\n\nFor more information about the information security practices associated with RDS, please read the Privacy Policy & Terms of Use accessible via the link provided at the bottom of each page of the website.\n\nIf you or your parents cannot provide a SSN, ITIN, I-94, ARN, or USCIS identification number, you will be considered a nonresident as part of your initial consideration. If you are unable to provide one of these identification numbers, RDS is unable to validate your information with federal and state agencies and you are considered a nonresident for tuition purposes. All students have the ability to appeal a nonresident decision and the ability to provide additional information to support their North Carolina residency.\n\nDuring an appeal, RDS will consider information pertaining to the student and parent(s). All students must have legal capacity to be determined a resident for North Carolina tuition and state grant purposes. In addition, RDS will require the student (if the student is self-sufficient) and parent(s) (if the student is not self-sufficient) to prove North Carolina domiciliary acts.\n\nYou may request an Appeal if you believe that the RDS process has failed to accurately consider important information regarding your residency claim. There are two types of appeal:\n\nRDS Appeal - the RDS Appeal is for students who believe their active residency determination is incorrect - either from an initial consideration or a reconsideration. Students have the ability to request the RDS Appeal online, submit additional information and documentation to support their claim, and meet face-to-face (or via technology) to review their appeal.\n\nSEAA Appeal - the SEAA Appeal is the final administrative step in the residency process. The appeal is conducted by a statewide committee comprised of representatives from the North Carolina Community College System, North Carolina Independent Colleges and Universities, State Education Assistance Authority, and The University of North Carolina System. No additional documentation or information is permitted by RDS or the student in this appeal.\n\nBoth the RDS Appeal and SEAA Appeal require submitting a notification to appeal within 10 calendar days of the determination the student is appealing. Requests for appeal after 10 calendar days are not permitted. Go to the Residency Guidelines section of the website to learn more about Appeals.\n\nYes. A legal resident is someone who comes to North Carolina and has physical presence for at least one day, with the intent to make North Carolina a permanent home indefinitely.\n\nA resident for tuition purposes or for eligibility for state grant determination is governed by Article 14 of Chapter 116 of the North Carolina General Statutes. Many people who live in (or are residents of) North Carolina may not qualify under the statute. Under this law, to qualify for in-state tuition a student must prove they have established and continuously maintained legal residence in North Carolina for 12 months before they claim residency. A student must also prove you came to North Carolina for reasons other than attending college.\n\nThere is not a \"list\" of things a student can do to guarantee a determination of in-state residency. Rather, a student must show their intent to maintain legal residence in North Carolina. If a student permanently relocates to North Carolina, the student performs certain residentiary actions that tie you to North Carolina. However, performing residentiary acts, like obtaining a North Carolina driver's license, obtaining a job in North Carolina or even paying taxes in North Carolina, does not guarantee in-state residency. RDS considers numerous factors in determining whether or not a student is a resident for tuition purposes or if you are eligible for state grant determination.\n\nDomicile is a legal term defined as the place where a person intends to remain and live permanently, and the place the person intends to return to after any absence. Permanency is the key. For example, a person who lives in a place for a temporary purpose such as to attend college, and who intends to live elsewhere when that purpose is accomplished, has not established domicile in that place. In NC such a person is not a resident for tuition purposes.\n\nThe law presumes your residence is the same as that of your parent(s) or legal guardian, unless you show conclusively that you support yourself (your parents do not support you with funds, loans, gifts or by paying for your residence) and that you support your own residence and domicile in North Carolina. Unless you show that you are NOT supported by your parents, then residency determination for tuition purposes is, by law, always based on your parent(s)/guardian(s) information.\n\nYou are the only one who knows your true intent so you have the burden of proving your residency for tuition purposes. RDS must determine that your actions, taken as a whole, demonstrate your intent to make North Carolina your permanent dwelling place, rather than your residence in the state only for the purpose of attending college. This determination does not come from any single action, but from a cluster of events, which clearly show that at least 12 months before you claim residency the greater part of information about you points to North Carolina as your domicile. In other words, you have done the kinds of things that a permanent resident does, and have not been acting like a temporary visitor. There is no set checklist of items which guarantee a determination as a resident for tuition purposes.\n\nRDS may ask you some of these important questions:\n\nDo you live in the home of your parent(s)?\n\nDid you or your parents file a North Carolina income tax return indicating that you were a resident during the last tax year?\n\nIs your vehicle registered in North Carolina?\n\nDo you have a current North Carolina driver license?\n\nAre you registered to vote in North Carolina?\n\nWhere and when did you last vote?\n\nWhat is your financial capacity?\n\nWhat is the source(s) of your financial capacity?\n\nDo you own real estate in North Carolina?\n\nWhere are you, or were you, employed or working and earning income?\n\nWhere did you last attend, or graduate from, high school?\n\nIf you or your parents cannot provide a SSN, ITIN, ARN, I-94, or USCIS identification number, you will be considered a nonresident as part of your initial consideration. If you are unable to provide one of these identification numbers, RDS is unable to validate your information with federal and state agencies and you are considered a nonresident for tuition purposes. All students have the ability to appeal a nonresident decision and the ability to provide additional information to support their North Carolina residency.\n\nDuring an appeal, RDS will consider information pertaining to the student and parent(s). All students must have legal capacity to be determined a resident for North Carolina tuition and state grant purposes. In addition, RDS will require the student (if the student is self-sufficient) and parent(s) (if the student is not self-sufficient) to prove North Carolina domiciliary acts.\n\nNorth Carolina law affords in-state tuition rate benefits to certain military personnel and their dependents. Active duty members of the Armed Services living in North Carolina may be charged the in-state tuition rate. The dependents of certain members of the Armed Services who are stationed on active duty in North Carolina may qualify for the in-state tuition rate while sharing a home with the active duty service member.\n\nWhen a qualifying active duty military member is reassigned outside of North Carolina while the member or dependent is enrolled in college, the military member or dependent relative remains eligible for the in-state tuition rate as long as he or she experiences no break in enrollment in the degree or other program in which he or she was enrolled at the time of the reassignment. Summer terms are not included in this sequential enrollment requirement. Qualifying members and dependents also remain eligible to pay in-state tuition if the active duty member receives an Honorable Discharge, so long as the member or dependent establishes legal residence in North Carolina within thirty days and meets the sequential enrollment requirement noted above, i.e. remains sequentially enrolled in the degree or other program in which he or she was enrolled at the time of the Honorable Discharge.\n\nAdditionally, any non-resident North Carolina National Guard Members in reserve or active duty status are eligible for the in-state tuition rate and all applicable mandatory fees. Application for this benefit must be made before first day of classes of the first enrolled term for which the benefit is sought. The person applying for this benefit has the burden of proving entitlement.\n\nGo to the Tuition Benefits section of the website to learn more about Military Benefits and Residency.\n\nIf a student is under age 18, the law considers the student's domicile to be the same as the parents' domicile because, as a minor, a student is not legally capable of establishing an independent domicile unless the student is married or an emancipated minor.\n\nIf the student is over age 18, RDS bases the claim of residency on the parent's information unless the student can prove that the student is:\n\nindependent of their parent(s)\n\n\"financially self-sufficient\"\n\nUnless a student clearly demonstrates both, regardless of age, RDS determines the claim of residency based on the parent's information.\n\nThe RDS Guidebook has additional information on age and residency status.\n\nNo - Even if you have lived in North Carolina as a resident alien and have paid taxes, you must satisfy the 12-month waiting period from the date your permanent resident status was issued. The only exception is if you are a green card holder and are married to a qualified North Carolina resident who is a citizen, in which case you may use your spouse's duration in North Carolina to satisfy the 12-month requirement.\n\nNot necessarily - there is more involved than just physical presence. You must prove that you have established legal residence (or domicile) in North Carolina for at least 12 consecutive months before you claim residency for tuition purposes. It must be clear that your intent is to make North Carolina your home indefinitely and that you did not come to North Carolina only to attend college.\n\nTo qualify for in-state tuition, you or your parent(s)/guardian(s) must demonstrate capacity, presence, intent, and duration:\n\nCapacity: the ability to make North Carolina your permanent home legally and financially and remain in NC permanently\n\nto claim residency on your own (separate from your parent(s)/guardian(s) you must demonstrate capacity based on your own financial resources, not through support from your parent(s) or through gifts from someone else\n\nPresence: be physically present in and reside in North Carolina\n\nIntent: perform various actions as evidence of making North Carolina your permanent home (domicile) rather than residing in the state for the purpose of attending college\n\nDuration: maintain a domicile continuously for at least 12 full months before you claim residency\n\nGenerally speaking, yes. No exceptions to this requirement are provided for students attending UNC system schools. However, if you plan to attend a NC community college, the college can qualify you for in-state tuition on the basis of your parent's employment-related move to NC. This exception is limited to 1% of the college's total out-of-state enrollment, which varies by college, so you will need to verify your eligibility with the college prior to enrollment. Also, if your NC employer is paying your tuition, any NC community college can charge your employer the in-state rate for your tuition; this exception does not have any limitations.\n\nIf you were classified as a resident for tuition purposes at a North Carolina college at the time you left school, or graduated and moved out of state, you do not lose your residence status if you move back to North Carolina and re-establish residency within 12 months of leaving. You may re-enroll at a North Carolina college as a resident without having to meet the 12 months durational requirement. You may only take advantage of this statutory provision once in your lifetime."
