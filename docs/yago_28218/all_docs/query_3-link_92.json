        "text": "Data on award of child support payments were collected from people 15 years or older with children under 21 years of age whose other parent was not living in the household. Information on recipiency and amount of payments was obtained from people who reported that they were awarded or had agreements to receive child support payments.\n\n>Reason for nonaward of child support.\n\nFinal agreement pending: A child support agreement was awaiting final court, magisterial, or legal action before becoming final, and/or a voluntary written agreement was not yet final.\n\nJoint custody granted: Housing, care, and support of the child(ren) was shared by both parents; therefore, no money or other support was exchanged.\n\nDid not want child support: The custodial parent indicated he/she did not want child support for own child(ren).\n\nUnable to locate other parent: Child support was desired, but the child(ren)’s noncustodial parent could not be located.\n\nUnable to establish paternity: Child support arrangements could not be made because the child(ren)’s paternity could not be established.\n\nSome other reason: The custodial parent wanted child support, and the reason for nonaward did not fit any of the reasons listed above.\n\nInclusion of health insurance in child support award.\n\nThis item refers to whether the child(ren)’s noncustodial parent had made health insurance arrangements for his/her child(ren) as part of the child support award. Arrangements for health insurance could have been made by the noncustodial parent purchasing a separate policy for the child(ren) or including the child(ren) under the health insurance provided by his/her employer. In either event, the purchase of, or inclusion of, health insurance must be part of the child support agreement. Insurance taken out by the custodial parent but paid for from child support payment by the noncustodial parent is not included.\n\nType of child support arrangement.\n\nVoluntary written agreement: Voluntary written agreements between the parties. This agreement may or may not have been recognized by the courts as part of the divorce or separation proceedings. This type of agreement was not ordered by the courts.\n\nCourt ordered: Payments ordered by the court. Court-ordered payments usually take place when a mutually acceptable agreement cannot be worked out between the parties.\n\nOther: Arrangements not within either of the two cases above. This category includes informal verbal agreements.\n\nThe term \"children,\" as used in tables on living arrangements of children under 18, are all persons under 18 years, excluding people who maintain households, families, or subfamilies as a reference person or spouse.\n\nOwn children in a family are sons and daughters, including stepchildren and adopted children, of the householder. Similarly, \"own\" children in a subfamily are sons and daughters of the married couple or parent in the subfamily. (All children shown as members of related subfamilies are own children of the person(s) maintaining the subfamily.) For each type of family unit identified in the CPS, the count of \"own children under 18 years old\" is limited to never-married children; however, \"own children under 25\" and \"own children of any age,\" as the terms are used here, include all children regardless of marital status. The counts include never-married children living away from home in college dormitories.\n\nRelated children in a family include own children and all other children under 18 years old in the household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. The count of related children in families was formerly restricted to never-married children. However, beginning with data for 1968 the Bureau of the Census includes ever-married children under the category of related children. This change added approximately 20,000 children to the category of related children in March 1968.\n\nThe college enrollment statistics are based on replies to the interviewer’s inquiry as to whether the person was attending or enrolled in school and the grade or school or year of college. Interviewers were instructed to count as enrolled anyone who had been enrolled at any time during the current term or school year, except those who have left for the remainder of the term. Thus, regular college enrollment includes those people attending a 4-year or 2-year college, university, or professional school (such as medical or law school) in courses that may advance the student toward a recognized college or university degree (e.g., BA or MA). Attendance may be either full time or part time, during the day or night. The college student need not be working toward a degree, but he/she must be enrolled in a class for which credit would be applied toward a degree. (see \"school enrollment\"). Students are classified by year of college, based on the academic year (not calendar year) they are attending. Undergraduate years are the 1st through 4th year, or freshman through senior. Graduate or professional school years include the 5th year and higher.\n\nTwo-year and four-year colleges: College students were asked to report whether the college in which they were enrolled was a 2-year college (junior or community college) or a 4-year college or university. Students enrolled in the first 4 years (undergraduates) were classified by the type of college they reported. Graduate students are shown as a separate group.\n\nAttendance, full-time and part-time. College students were classified according to whether they were attending school on a full-time or part-time basis. A student was regarded as attending college full time if he/she was taking 12 or more hours of classes during the average school week, and part time if he/she was taking less than 12 hours of classes during the average school week.\n\nThere are five categories of citizenship status: 1) Born in the United States; 2) Born in Puerto Rico or another outlying area of the U.S.; 3) Born abroad of U.S. citizen parent or parents; 4) Naturalized citizen; 5) Not a U.S. citizen. Place of birth was asked for every household member in the CPS sample and for the parents of every household member. People born in the U.S. or Outlying Areas or whose parents were born in the U.S. or Outlying Areas were not asked citizenship questions. Citizenship status (1), (2), or (3) was assigned during the editing phase of data preparation based on the place of birth of the household member or the place of birth of his or her parents. People born outside the U.S. and Outlying Areas to parents also born outside the U.S. and Outlying Areas were asked, \"Are you a citizen of the United States?\" ''Yes\" answers were assigned to the naturalized citizen category (4) and \"No\" answers were assigned to the \"Not a citizen\" category (5) during the editing process. People for whom no birthplace was provided were assigned a citizenship status during the editing process. For example, the citizenship status of a child might have been assigned based on the citizenship status of the child’s mother or father.\n\nThe householder refers to the person (or one of the people) in whose name the housing unit is owned or rented (maintained) or, if there is no such person, any adult member, excluding roomers, boarders, or paid employees. If the house is owned or rented jointly by a married couple, the householder may be either the husband or the wife. The person designated as the householder is the \"reference person\" to whom the relationship of all other household members, if any, is recorded.\n\nThe number of householders is equal to the number of households. Also, the number of family householders is equal to the number of families.\n\nHead versus householder. Beginning with the 1980 CPS, the Bureau of the Census discontinued the use of the terms \"head of household\" and \"head of family.\" Instead, the terms \"householder\" and \"family householder\" are used. Recent social changes have resulted in greater sharing of household responsibilities among the adult members and, therefore, have made the term \"head\" increasingly inappropriate in the analysis of household and family data. Specifically, beginning in 1980, the Census Bureau discontinued its longtime practice of always classifying the husband as the reference person (head) when he and his wife are living together.\n\nFor each person in the sample 15 years old and over, the CPS asks questions on the amount of money income received in the preceding calendar year from each of the following sources:\n\nEarnings\n\nUnemployment compensation\n\nWorkers’ compensation\n\nSocial security\n\nSupplemental security income\n\nPublic assistance\n\nVeterans’ payments\n\nSurvivor benefits\n\nDisability benefits\n\nPension or retirement income\n\nInterest\n\nDividends\n\nRents, royalties, and estates and trusts\n\nEducational assistance\n\nAlimony\n\nChild support\n\nFinancial assistance from outside of the household\n\nOther income\n\nIt should be noted that although the income statistics refer to receipts during the preceding calendar year, the demographic characteristics, such as age, labor force status, and family or household composition, are as of the survey date. The income of the family/household does not include amounts received by people who were members during all or part of the income year if these people no longer resided in the family/household at the time of interview. However, the CPS collects income data for people who are current residents but did not reside in the household during the income year.\n\nData on consumer income collected in the CPS by the Census Bureau cover money income received (exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains) before payments for personal income taxes, social security, union dues, medicare deductions, etc. Therefore, money income does not reflect the fact that some families receive part of their income in the form of noncash benefits, such as food stamps, health benefits, rent-free housing, and goods produced and consumed on the farm. In addition, money income does not reflect the fact that noncash benefits are also received by some nonfarm residents which often take the form of the use of business transportation and facilities, full or partial payments by business for retirement programs, medical and educational expenses, etc. Data users should consider these elements when comparing income levels. Moreover, readers should be aware that for many different reasons there is a tendency in household surveys for respondents to underreport their income. Based on an analysis of independently derived income estimates, the Census Bureau determined that respondents report income earned from wages or salaries much better than other sources of income and that the reported wage and salary income is nearly equal to independent estimates of aggregate income.\n\nFor more information and the definitions of the source incomes, please refer to Appendix A, Definitions and Explanations, from the Current Population Reports, Consumer Income, P60-200 [PDF - 30K] .\n\nThe marital status classification identifies four major categories: never married, married, widowed, and divorced. These terms refer to the marital status at the time of the enumeration.\n\nThe category \"married\" is further divided into \"married, spouse present,\" \"separated,\" and \"other married, spouse absent.\" A person was classified as \"married, spouse present\" if the husband or wife was reported as a member of the household, even though he or she may have been temporarily absent on business or on vacation, visiting, in a hospital, etc., at the time of the enumeration. People reported as separated included those with legal separations, those living apart with intentions of obtaining a divorce, and other people permanently or temporarily separated because of marital discord. The group \"other married, spouse absent\" includes married people living apart because either the husband or wife was employed and living at a considerable distance from home, was serving away from home in the Armed Forces, had moved to another area, or had a different place of residence for any other reason except separation as defined above.\n\nSingle, when used as a marital status category, is the sum of never-married, widowed, and divorced people. \"Single,\" when used in the context of \"single-parent family/household,\" means only one parent is present in the home. The parent may be never-married, widowed, divorced, or married, spouse absent.\n\nThe general concept of a metropolitan area (MA) is one of a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. Some MA’s are defined around two or more nuclei.\n\nThe MA classification is a statistical standard, developed for use by Federal agencies in the production, analysis, and publication of data on MA’s. The MA’s are designated and defined by the Federal Office of Management and Budget, following a set of official published standards. These standards were developed by the interagency Federal Executive Committee on Metropolitan Areas, with the aim of producing definitions that are as consistent as possible for all MA’s nationwide.\n\nEach MA must contain either a place with a minimum population of 50,000 or a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area and a total MA population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). An MA is comprised of one or more central counties, and an MA may also include one or more outlying counties that have closed economic and social relationships with the central county. An outlying county must have a specified level of commuting to the central counties and also must meet certain standards regarding metropolitan character, such as population density, urban population, and population growth. In New England, MA’s are composed of cities and towns rather than whole counties.\n\nThe territory, population, and housing units in MA’s are referred to as \"metropolitan.\" The metropolitan category is subdivided into \"inside central city\" and \"outside central city.\" The territory, population, and housing units located outside MA’s are referred to as \"nonmetropolitan.\"\n\nTo meet the needs of various users, the standards provide for a flexible structure of metropolitan definitions that classify an MA either as a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or as a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA) that is divided into primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSA’s). Documentation of the MA standards and how they are applied is available from the Secretary, Federal Executive Committee on Metropolitan Areas, Population Division, U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233.\n\nCentral city. In each MSA and CMSA, the largest place and, in some cases, additional places are designated as \"central cities\" under the official standards. A few PMSA’s do not have central cities. The largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities are included in the title of the MA; there are also central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that city that extends outside the MA boundary.\n\nConsolidated and primary metropolitan statistical area. If an area that qualifies as an MA has more than one million people, primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSA’s) may be defined within it. PMSA’s consist of a large urbanized county or cluster of counties that demonstrates very strong internal economic and social links, in addition to close ties to other portions of the larger area. When PMSA’s are established, the larger area of which they are component parts is designated a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA).\n\nMetropolitan statistical area. Metropolitan statistical areas are relatively freestanding MA’s and are not closely associated with other MA’s. These areas are typically surrounded by nonmetropolitan counties.\n\nReasons for moving are collected for movers over the past year (one-year migration data only; not collected for five-year migration data). Persons who moved with the householder are assigned the reason of the householder. For cases selecting one of the four “other” categories (other family-related reason, other employment-related reason, other housing reason, and other reasons) write-ins are collected, allowing them to be potentially be recoded.\n\nReasons for moving.\n\nFamily-related reasons:\n\nChange in marital status: Moved because of family formation or dissolution resulting in a change in legal marital status classification to one of the following categories: married, widowed, separated or divorced.\n\nTo establish own household: Moved out of an existing household in order to establish a separate one.\n\nOther family reason (specify): All other reasons not listed above that are family-related.\n\nEmployment-related reasons:\n\nNew job or job transfer: Moved because of a new job or location of existing job moved. This includes military transfers.\n\nTo look for work or lost job: Moved in order to find work or due to a loss of employment.\n\nTo be closer to work/easier commute: Moved to be closer to their work and/or reduce their commuting time or effort.\n\nRetired: Moved after retirement from a job.\n\nOther job related reason (specify): All other reasons not listed above that are employment-related.\n\nHousing-related reasons:\n\nWanted to own home, not rent: Moved because wanted to own their home and not rent a house or apartment.\n\nWanted newer/better/larger house or apartment: Moved because they wanted a newer/better/larger house or apartment.\n\nWanted better neighborhood/less crime: Moved to a better neighborhood and/or moved to an area with less crime.\n\nWanted cheaper housing: Moved to a cheaper/less expensive house or apartment.\n\nForeclosure/eviction: Moved due to a foreclosure or eviction.\n\nOther housing reason (specify): All other reasons not listed above that are housing-related.\n\nOther reasons:\n\nRelationship with unmarried partner (boy/girlfriend, fiancé, etc.): Moved to be with an unmarried partner or for other reasons related to an unmarried partner.\n\nTo attend or leave college: Moved to a different place of residence to attend college, or left their college residence to return to a previous place of residence or move elsewhere.\n\nChange of climate: Moved to a more preferable climate (i.e., weather patterns).\n\nHealth reasons: Moved based on one’s own health or that of another person (e.g., spouse).\n\nNatural disaster (hurricane, tornado, etc.): Moved due to a natural disaster.\n\nOther reason (specify): All other reasons not listed.\n\nFollowing the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) Directive 14, the Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to detect who is poor. If a family’s total income is less than that family’s threshold, then that family, and every individual in it, is considered poor. The poverty thresholds do not vary geographically, but they are updated annually for inflation with the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The official poverty definition counts money income before taxes and excludes capital gains and noncash benefits (such as public housing, medicaid, and food stamps).\n\nPoverty statistics are based on a definition developed by Mollie Orshansky of the Social Security Administration (SSA)in 1964 1 For a detailed discussion of the original SSA poverty thresholds, see Mollie Orshansky, Counting the Poor: Another Look at the Poverty Profile, Social Security Bulletin, vol. 28, no. 1, January 1965, pp. 3-29 (reprinted in Social Security Bulletin, vol. 51, no. 10, October 1988, pp. 25-51); and Who’s Who Among the Poor: A Demographic View of Poverty, Social Security Bulletin, vol. 28, no. 7, July 1965, pp. 3-32. and revised in 1969 and 1981 by interagency committees. This definition was established as the official definition of poverty for statistical use in all Executive departments by the Bureau of the Budget (BoB) in 1969 (in Circular No. A-46); after BoB became The Office of Management and Budget, this was reconfirmed in Statistical Policy Directive No. 14.\n\nThe original poverty definition provided a range of income cutoffs or thresholds adjusted by such factors as family size, sex of the family head, number of children under 18 years old, and farm-nonfarm residence. At the core of this definition of poverty was the economy food plan, the least costly of four nutritionally adequate food plans designed by the Department of Agriculture. It was determined from the Department of Agriculture’s 1955 Household Food Consumption Survey that families of three or more people spent approximately one-third of their after-tax money income on food; accordingly, poverty thresholds for families of three or more people were set at three times the cost of the economy food plan. Different procedures were used to calculate poverty thresholds for two-person families and people living alone in order to compensate for the relatively larger fixed expenses of these smaller units. For two-person families, the cost of the economy food plan was multiplied by a factor of 3.7 (also derived from the 1955 survey). For unrelated individuals (one-person units), no multiplier was used; poverty thresholds were instead calculated as a fixed proportion of the corresponding thresholds for two-person units. Annual updates of these SSA poverty thresholds were based on price changes of the items in the economy food plan.\n\nAs a result of deliberations of a Federal interagency committee in 1969, the following two modifications to the original SSA definition of poverty were adopted:\n\n2 Poverty thresholds for 1959-1967 were recalculated on this basis, and revised poverty population figures for those years were tabulated using the revised thresholds. These revised 1959-1967 poverty population figures have been published in Census Bureau reports issued since August 1969 (including the present report). Because of this revision, poverty statistics from documents dated before August 1969 are not comparable with current poverty statistics.\n\nThe SSA thresholds for nonfarm families were retained for the base year 1963, but annual adjustments in the levels were based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rather than on changes in the cost of foods in the economy food plan.\n\nThe farm thresholds were raised from 70 to 85 percent of the corresponding nonfarm levels. The combined impact of these two modifications resulted in an increase in the tabulated totals for 1967 of 360,000 poor families and 1.6 million poor people.\n\nIn 1981, three additional modifications in the poverty definition recommended by another interagency committee were adopted for implementation in the March 1982 CPS as well as the 1980 census:\n\nElimination of separate thresholds for farm families.\n\nElimination (by averaging) of separate thresholds for female-householder families and \"all other\" families (earlier termed \"male-headed\" families).\n\nExtension of the detailed poverty threshold matrix to make the largest family size category \"nine people or more\".\n\nFor further details, see the section, \"Changes in the Definition of Poverty,\" in Current Population Reports, Series P-60, No. 133.\n\nThe poverty thresholds are increased each year by the same percentage as the annual average Consumer Price Index (CPI). The poverty thresholds are currently adjusted using the annual average CPI-U (1982-84 = 100). This base year has been used since 1988. From 1980 through 1987, the thresholds were adjusted using the CPI-U (1967 = 100). The CPI (1963 = 100) was used to adjust thresholds prior to 1980.\n\nFor further information on how the poverty thresholds were developed and subsequent changes in them, see Gordon M. Fisher, \"The Development and History of the Poverty Thresholds,\" Social Security Bulletin, vol.55, no.4, Winter 1992, pp. 3-14.\n\nThe annual high school dropout rate is an estimate of the proportion of students who drop out of school in a single year. This section briefly explains how the annual dropout rate is calculated; for further explanation and details of its derivation see Current Population Report, Series P-20, No. 413, \"School Enrollment--Social and Economic Characteristics of Students: October 1983.\"\n\nAnnual dropout rates for a single grade (x) are estimated as the ratio of the number of people who were enrolled in grade (x) in the year preceding the survey and who did not complete grade (x) and are not currently enrolled, to the number enrolled in grade (x) at the start of the year preceding this survey. People reported as enrolled last year but not currently enrolled are presented in table 8 of Current Population Reports on school enrollment, by the highest grade completed and are presumed to have dropped out of the succeeding grade (except those who graduated this year). Thus, individuals counted as 10th grade dropouts are those not enrolled in school whose highest grade completed is the 9th grade. (They include not only those people who were enrolled in the 10th grade in the fall of the year preceding the survey and left school without completing the year, but also those people who finished the 9th grade in the spring preceding the survey and were not enrolled at the survey date.) These estimates form the numerator of estimates of the annual grade specific dropout rate.\n\nPeople currently enrolled in high school are presumed to have successfully completed and been enrolled in the preceding grade in the preceding year. Thus, those who have successfully completed the 10th grade are enrolled in the 11th grade. Along with the people who dropped out of that grade, they comprise the denominator of the estimate of the annual grade-specific dropout rate.\n\nSince people who complete the 12th grade cannot be presumed to enroll in college, the estimate of the number of people enrolled in the 12th grade one year prior to the survey is constructed as the sum of the number of people reported as having graduated from high school \"this year\" (both those enrolled in the first year of college and people not currently enrolled whose highest grade completed is the 12th grade) and those people not currently enrolled who were enrolled last year and whose highest grade completed is the 11th grade (dropouts). The annual dropout rate for all grades during one year can be obtained by summing the components of the rates for the individual grades. In other words, those people who were enrolled in the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grade last year and who are not currently enrolled and do not have a diploma.\n\nIn addition to the annual rate, two other estimates of dropouts are frequently used. The annual dropout rate is different from a \"pool\" (or status) measure such as the proportion of an age group who are high school dropouts (not enrolled in school, not high school graduates, which does not depend on when the individuals dropped out. A third measure of dropouts is the cohort measure, most commonly from a longitudinal study, in which one calculates the proportion of a specific group of people enrolled in a specific year, who had not received diplomas (and who were no longer in school) some years later. For example, the proportion of a cohort enrolled in ninth grade in year X, who were not enrolled and had not received a diploma by year X=4.\n\nThe school enrollment statistics from the CPS are based on replies to the interviewer’s inquiry whether the person was enrolled in regular school. Interviewers were instructed to count as enrolled anyone who had been enrolled at any time during the current term or school year in any type of public, parochial, or other private school in the regular school system. Such schools include nursery schools, kindergartens, elementary schools, high schools, colleges, universities, and professional schools. Attendance may be on either a full-time, or part-time basis and during the day or night. Regular schooling is that which may advance a person toward an elementary or high school diploma, a college, university, or professional school degree. Children enrolled in nursery schools and kindergarten are included in the enrollment figures for regular schools and are also shown separately.\n\nEnrollment in schools which are not in the regular school system, such as trade schools, business colleges, and schools for the mentally handicapped, which do not advance students to regular school degrees, is not included.\n\nPeople enrolled in classes which do not require physical presence in school, such as correspondence courses or other courses of independent study, and in training courses given directly on the job, are also excluded from the count of those enrolled in school, unless such courses are being counted for credit at a regular school.\n\nSchool enrollment in year preceding current survey: An inquiry on enrollment in regular school or college in October of the preceding year was asked for all people (enrolled and not enrolled). In years before 1988, the question was asked only of people who were not currently attending regular school or were enrolled in college. In the tabulations of people enrolled in secondary school in the previous year, people currently enrolled in high school were assumed to have been enrolled the previous year.\n\nComparability of enrollment data in previous years: Changes in the edit and tabulation packages used in processing the October CPS school enrollment supplement caused some minor revisions in the estimates. The current edit and tabulation package began with 1987 data. The 1986 data which were published in Current Population Report, Series P-20 No. 429, were reprocessed with the rewritten programs in order to clarify comparability. Time series tables usually show only the revised estimates for 1986. The previous edit and tabulation package was used from 1967 to 1986.\n\nMajor changes in the data due to the 1987 edit revisions were: (1) Among 14- and 15-year-olds, an edit improvement allowed people with enrollment data not reported, who were previously automatically imputed \"not enrolled,\" to be enrolled; (2) Revisions in tabulation of enrollment in the previous year simplifies calculation of an annual high school dropout rate; (3) Edit improvements caused increases in college enrollment estimates, most notably above age 24; this age group was largely ignored in earlier edits; (4) Type of college is fully allocated (discussed earlier); (5) Tabulations of type of college (2-year,4-year) are available by race; (6) Dependent family member is defined consistently; (7) New tabulations of employment status, vocational course enrollment, college retention and re-entry, and families with children enrolled in public and private school were available beginning in 1987.\n\nIn the series of reports on school enrollment for 1987 to 1992, race and Hispanic origin were erroneously tabulated for a small percentage of children 3 to 14 years old. Race and Hispanic origin of an adult in the household were attributed to the child, rather than using the child’s reported characteristics. In the vast majority of cases these characteristics were the same for family members, but for a small percentage of children, they were different. The correction made the following proportional changes in the numbers of children in each group: White (-0.5 percent), Black (+3.1 percent), Hispanic origin (-4.6 percent).\n\nPublished data on enrollment from the October CPS for 1981 to 1993 used population controls based on the 1980 census. Beginning in 1994 estimates were based on 1990 census population controls, including adjustment for undercount. Time series tables show two sets of data for 1993; the data labeled 1993r were processed using population controls based on the 1990 census, adjusted for undercount. The change in 1994 from a paper and pencil survey to a computer assisted survey had some affect on the data. Most notable, the enrollment question for children 3 to 5 years old was different from the question for older children--it included a reference to nursery school. In 1994 reported nursery school enrollment was significantly higher than in earlier years.\n\nA subfamily is a married couple with or without children, or a single parent with one or more own never-married children under 18 years old. A subfamily does not maintain their own household, but lives in the home of someone else.\n\nRelated subfamily. A related subfamily is a married couple with or without children, or one parent with one or more own never married children under 18 years old, living in a household and related to, but not including, the person or couple who maintains the household. One example of a related subfamily is a young married couple sharing the home of the husband’s or wife’s parents. The number of related subfamilies is not included in the count of families.\n\nUnrelated subfamily. An unrelated subfamily (formerly called a secondary family) is a married couple with or without children, or a single parent with one or more own never-married children under 18 years old living in a household. Unrelated subfamily members are not related to the householder. An unrelated subfamily may include people such as guests, partners, roommates, or resident employees and their spouses and/or children. The number of unrelated subfamily members is included in the total number of household members, but is not included in the count of family members.\n\nBeginning in 1989, any person(s) who is not related to the householder and who is not the husband, wife, parent, or child in an unrelated subfamily is counted as an unrelated individual.\n\nThe population of voting age includes a considerable number of people who meet the age requirement but cannot register and vote. People who are not citizens are not eligible to vote. Among citizens of voting age, some people are not permitted to vote because they have been committed to penal institutions, mental hospitals, or other institutions, or because they fail to meet state and local resident requirements for various reasons. The eligibility to register is governed by state laws which differ in many respects.\n\nRegistration is the act of qualifying to vote by formally enrolling on a list of voters. People who have moved to another election district must take steps to have their names placed on the voting rolls in their new place of residence.\n\nIn a few states or parts of states, no formal registration is required. Voters merely present themselves at the polling place on election day with proof that they are of age and have met the appropriate residence requirements. Therefore, in these areas people who are citizens and of voting age, and who meet the residence requirement, would be considered as being registered."
