        "text": "This page contains information about changing a child's name through a court order. For name changes through adoption, see Name Changes Through Adoption.\n\nTexas Law\n\nA child's name is not automatically changed when a parent changes their legal name. If a parent gets married or divorced and wants to change their child's name, they will have to apply for a court order. Texas Family Code Chapter 45 establishes the formal process for changing a child's legal name through the courts.\n\nYou can apply to change the name of a child for any reason, but the judge will only approve the request if \"the change is in the best interest of the child.\" If it is, the court will issue a court order changing the child's legal name. This law is in Subsection 45.004(1).\n\nFor children with certain types of criminal history, additional requirements will apply. See Subsection 45.004(2) for more information.\n\nOverview\n\nThe process starts by filing a petition to change your child's legal name. This is usually done in a district clerk's office in the county where the child lives. Some counties may accept online applications. The exact process will vary from court to court, but common steps include:\n\nfiling a petition and other required forms;\n\nsubmitting supporting documents, including child's written consent if the child is 10 years or older;\n\npaying an application fee or filing an inability-to-pay form;\n\nextra steps if the other parent did not cosign the petition; and\n\nattending a virtual or an in-person court hearing (in some counties).\n\nResources in the \"Understanding the Law\" section below provide more in-depth information. Contact your district clerk's office if you have questions about the filing process.\n\nOnline Forms\n\nNote As librarians and not attorneys, we cannot determine which forms, if any, are right for you to use. The links are for reference purposes only and are not a substitute for legal advice.\n\nThe district clerk's website for a specific county may have online forms for use in that county.\n\nResources that contain general Texas name change forms are listed below. You may access library e-books with a free library account or contact us for help.\n\nPrinted Forms\n\nNote As librarians and not attorneys, we cannot determine which forms, if any, are right for you to use. The links are for reference purposes only and are not a substitute for legal advice.\n\nThe district clerk's office for a specific county may have printed forms for use in that county. If your county has a public law library, it may also have forms. Contact them directly for more information.\n\nPrint resources that contain general Texas name change forms are listed below. These titles may be accessed at the library."
