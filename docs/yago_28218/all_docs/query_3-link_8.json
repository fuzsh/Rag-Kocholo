        "text": "If youâre married or planning to tie the knot and are thinking of buying a house, youâd usually combine your income and credit scores when applying for a mortgage. But you may be wondering if you can buy a house with only one partnerâs name on the mortgage.\n\nThe short answer is yes. A married couple can apply for a mortgage under only one name. If youâre planning to get a mortgage without your spouse or wondering why a couple would consider this approach, weâve got answers.\n\nWhy Would A Married Couple Buy A House Under Only One Name?\n\nYou may decide to leave your spouse off the mortgage for several reasons. Letâs take a look at a few.\n\nOne Spouse Has A Low Credit Score\n\nWhen you buy a house with someone else, mortgage lenders typically use the average credit score of both borrowers.\n\nFor example, letâs say youâre applying for a conventional loan. If you have a 700 credit score and your partner has a 500 credit score, the average credit score will be 600. Because conventional loans generally require a 620 credit score to qualify, you may leave your spouse off the mortgage because your combined average puts you below the qualifying 620 credit score mark.\n\nOne Spouse Is Carrying A Lot Of Debt\n\nTo help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage, a lender will look at your debt-to-income ratio (DTI), the percentage of your gross monthly income dedicated to your fixed monthly debt. DTI can have a huge impact on a home loan. If one spouse has a lot of debt, you may leave them off the mortgage to decrease the DTI.\n\nOne Spouseâs Income Doesnât Meet Requirements\n\nLenders will need proof of income from both borrowers. Many lenders use the 2/2/2 rule to evaluate loan eligibility, which typically requires:\n\nIf your spouse is self-employed, they may need 2 years of business returns or 1 year of W-2s from previous work in a similar field. Leaving your spouse off the loan if they canât produce this documentation may make sense for you.\n\nOne Spouse Wants To Simplify Estate Planning\n\nIf you want to leave your house to someone besides your spouse, such as children from a previous marriage, buying a house in your name can simplify the estate planning process. This is especially important if you live in a community property state where all assets and debt belong to both spouses. Right now, there are nine community property states in the U.S.:\n\nCan You Buy A House Without Your Spouse? Things To Consider\n\nSo if youâre the only one on the mortgage, you may be thinking that you shouldnât have any problem getting a mortgage. Unfortunately, itâs not always that simple. Here are a few things to know if youâre getting a mortgage without your spouse.\n\nYou May Qualify For A Smaller Loan With One Income\n\nIf youâre part of a two-income household, getting a mortgage together usually means you can qualify for a larger home loan. However, if your spouse isnât on the loan with you, your lender wonât consider your spouseâs income when determining how much youâll qualify for. You may have to buy a home with a smaller loan.\n\nThe exception would be a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan, which considers the income of all household members for loan qualification, whether or not theyâre on the loan. To meet the loanâs income eligibility requirement, your combined household income must fall within a certain percentage of the area median income where youâre buying a property.\n\nYour Spouseâs Debts May Still Affect Mortgage Qualification\n\nIf the home you want to purchase is in a community property state and youâre applying for a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan, your debt and your spouseâs debt will be taken into consideration, even if only one spouse is on the mortgage.\n\nYou May Also Want To Keep Your Spouseâs Name Off The Title\n\nIf you live in a common-law state, you can leave your spouseâs name off the house title. A title and a mortgage are different aspects of homeownership. The name on the title proves who owns the property, and the name on the mortgage represents whoâs responsible for paying back the loan.\n\nSome spouses donât include their partnerâs name on the house title to keep their finances separate, personally manage their life estate or protect their home from creditors because their spouse has a poor credit history.\n\nFAQ\n\nAs you can see, thereâs plenty to think about when buying property without your spouse, and you may still have more questions. You can find the answers to a few of the most common questions on this topic below.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nLeaving your spouseâs name off of your mortgage or title is not a reflection of the quality of your marriage, and in many cases it can be the best choice for both of you to get the house you both want. It could also ensure that you get the best home loan terms."
