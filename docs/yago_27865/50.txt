Alexandra (born Dec. 1, 1844, Copenhagen, Den.—died Nov. 20, 1925, Sandringham, Norfolk, Eng.) was the queen consort of King Edward VII of Great Britain.

The eldest daughter of Christian IX of Denmark, Alexandra was married to Edward (then Albert Edward, prince of Wales) in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor, on March 10, 1863. The exceptional beauty and graceful manner of the princess made her an immediate and lasting favourite with the British public. She had six children: Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence; George, Duke of York, afterward King George V; Louise, afterward Duchess of Fife; Victoria; Maud, afterward queen of Norway; and John, who died in infancy.
