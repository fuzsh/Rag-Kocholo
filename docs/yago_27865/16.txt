10 March marks the anniversary of the marriage in 1863 between Prince Edward, later King Edward VII, and Princess Alexandra of Denmark.

Born Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia in 1844, Princess Alexandra was 16 when she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales and heir to Queen Victoria. They married eighteen months later. She was popular with the British public during her time as Princess of Wales and became Queen Consort when Edward became king in 1901.

Following Edwardâ€™s death in 1910, Alexandra became Queen Mother during the reign of her son, George V. She died in 1925, aged 80.
