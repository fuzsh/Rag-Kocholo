Queen Mother[]

During her later years as Queen Mother, she paid a great influence to her favourite great-grandson, the current King George VII. She is the main influencer to tell King George VII and her great-grandsons never took a mistress, as they have experienced her loneliness and her hardship for Edward VII’s mistresses and George V’s struggle to paid the pensions for his father’s mistress.
