        "text": "On 10th March 1863, Prince Albert Edward, later King Edward VII, eldest son of Queen Victoria, married Princess Alexandra of Denmark at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor.\n\nBefore his marriage, Queen Victoria’s eldest son, Prince Albert Edward, had gained himself a reputation as a playboy. In 1858 The Queen and Prince Albert began looking for a bride for their eldest son, with the aim of stopping his affairs and preventing scandal. After making a list of potential suitors, Princess Victoria, Bertie’s elder sister, suggested the seventeen-year-old Princess Alexandra of Denmark. Although she wasn’t first choice, Prince Albert soon agreed to the match.\n\nPrincess Victoria arranged for the two to meet on 24th September 1861 at Speyer Cathedral, Germany. They became engaged a year later, on 9th September 1862, at the Royal Castle of Laeken in Belgium. A few months later, Alexandra travelled from Denmark to Britain aboard the royal yacht Victoria and Albert and arrived in Gravesend, Kent, on 7th March 1863.\n\nThomas Longley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, married the couple on 10th March 1863 at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The venue had been chosen by Queen Victoria, who wanted a smaller ceremony than many expected. This caused much criticism from press as royal weddings usually took place in London. Many expectant guests were disappointed not to get an invite, including the Danes as only Alexandra’s closest relations had been invited. The British court was still in mourning for Prince Albert, so ladies were restricted to wearing grey, lilac, or mauve.\n\nThe carriage procession began from Windsor Castle to St George’s Chapel, with the Danish royal family in the first carriage, followed by members of the British royal family. The Prince of Wales and his entourage were in the next-to-last carriage, with the bride coming last. Queen Victoria was not part of the procession, being taken to the chapel privately. She was escorted by her brother-in-law, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Victoria was dressed in mourning, and viewed the ceremony from above and out of view of the other guests.\n\nPrincess Alexandra was attended by eight bridesmaids: Lady Diana Beauclerk, Victoria Montagu-Douglas-Scott, Victoria Howard, Elma Bruce, Agneta Yorke, Emily Villiers (filling in for Hariot Georgina Hamilton-Rowan who was indisposed that day), Eleanor Hare and Feodorowna Wellesley. She was supported by her father, Prince Christian and the Duke of Cambridge. The Prince of Wales was supported by his uncle, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and brother-in-law, the Crown Prince of Prussia.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the Prince and Princess of Wales returned to Windsor Castle along with the other guests. Many of the royal guests served as witnesses, with Queen Victoria, the Prince of Wales’s siblings and their spouses, Princess Alexandra’s family, as well as the Danish and British ministers and Lord Chancellor signing the marriage register. A banquet was held in the State Dining Room for the royal guests and in St. George’s Hall for household members, and other guests.\n\nAs the couple left Windsor for their honeymoon at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, they were cheered by the schoolboys of neighbouring Eton College, including Lord Randolph Churchill.\n\nThe couple used Marlborough House as their London residence and Sandringham House in Norfolk as their country retreat. Alexandra gave birth to their first child, Prince Albert Victor, on 8th January 1864. Over the next seven years she would go on to have a total of six children.\n\nTheir marriage and lifestyle was controversial. They hosted lavish parties and Bertie continued to have affairs. Despite this, Alexandra remained devoted to her husband until his death in 1910.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed today’s blog.
