        "text": "Today's monarch of England is one of my absolute favorites, even though he is often glossed over, forgotten, or laughed at. Not every monarch can be a genius. Not every monarch can be pure. But every monarch can be a hero, if they work hard. Today we have a lesson in patience from one of the most conflicted and sometimes tragic of the British Monarchs, Edward VII, AKA \"Bertie.\"\n\n- Was born in 1841, the second child and eldest son of Victoria and Albert. He was not considered a \"Hanoverian\" prince, as he didn't stand in line to gain the Hanoverian crown. (Victoria's father's younger brother wound up with that honor, and it passed down to his children.) Instead, his family name was Albert Edward Saxe-Coburg Gothe. Quite German, all things told.\n\n- Like the other royal children, he spoke with a very slight German accent, especially with his family, although English was his first language.\n\n- Was nicknamed \"Bertie\" by his parents, and rarely went by the name \"Edward\" until he became King. To differentiate him from his father, he was called \"Bertie\" or \"Albert Edward.\"\n\n- Was a stunning disappointment in his youth. His overly strict parents expected him to know the gravity of his position from day one. Bertie, however, was a constant fidgeter and horrible student. In today's world, he would have most likely been diagnosed with ADHD. He threw things at his teachers, smashed windows out of boredom, rarely did homework, and was a constant source of worry for his parents. Tutors quit their post out of frustration at Bertie's behavior. His mother wrote, despairing, that Bertie was the most terrible of children she could have been cursed with.\n\n- He always hated the strict regiment his father forced him to follow. He hated learning 8-9 hours a day. He hated working in the garden at Osborne House. He hated being told every day that he must be like his father.\n\n- Though he was passable in English and Mathematics, he was truly awful at Science and History. By the time he was a teenager, Bertie was in full rebellion mode. Still, he managed to scrape by in his studies, eager to either make his parents proud, or at least get them off of his back. He studied at Edinburgh and Oxford in 1859, and performed a bit above average. His parents allowed him to then choose his school, and he went off to Cambridge.\n\n-At Trinity college in Cambridge, Bertie was allowed to have a bit more freedom, though he was forced to have private quarters away from campus, under the watchful eyes of chaperons. Bertie, now 18, became an expert at giving his minders the slip. He fell in with some other wealthy university lads, and for the first time, Bertie got to truly be free of his father's iron grip. He partied, drank, smoked cigars, and gambled for the first time. He loved it, and his grades suddenly improved. Bertie had found that he was happiest when he was surrounded by friends, just talking and laughing the night away. But, it became apparent to his mates that Bertie was still sheltered and a bit socially awkward. He was casually arrogant and cruel... a bit of a bully at times. He simply didn't seem to understand the feelings of others. He was, however, charming, and a lot of fun to be around, so they chalked that up to his sheltered upbringing.\n\n- Bertie finally found professors he could understand and appreciate. His grades continued to improve, especially in the social studies such as history, speech, and etiquette. His professors noted that he had a flair for charm and gregariousness.\n\n- In 1860, Victoria and Albert decided to give Bertie his first real chance at being the \"perfect prince\" they desired. Victoria was scheduled to make a tour of the United States, but thought that this was the perfect opportunity for Bertie to make his way. Half a world away from mom and dad, and 18 years old, Bertie was an instant success. The Americans loved his easy wit, charming manner, and occasional bawdy jokes.\n\n- In America, Bertie was overwhelmed by the public. Crowds gathered to see him, prayers were said for the royal family in New York for the first time since the Revolutionary War. Hunting trips, ribbon cuttings, state visits, and of course lavish parties were arranged for him. President Buchanan invited Bertie to stay at the White House for days. Bertie was overheard saying \"I cannot believe it. All this, just for me?\"\n\n- The trip was an overwhelming success. American/British relations enjoyed an all new closeness, Bertie was now cheered by the Americans, and he now had confidence and self worth which he never had before.... until he got home.\n\n- Albert and Victoria were not pleased at all. To them, the LAST thing they wanted him to do was party, dance, smoke cigars, and act like a commoner. They expected him to be aloof, regal, and princely. Although they acknowledged his work, they also gave Bertie stern lectures about his behavior. Bertie was frustrated and angry.\n\n- Albert Edward asked for a military appointment. Albert wasn't against it, but Victoria was. Albert made sure that Bertie was vetted to the top quickly, so as to avoid active duty. This didn't work at all for Bertie, who felt (rightly) that he hadn't earned the rank of Colonel, and wanted to go through the process like any other man. He was reminded that he was NOT just \"any other man,\" and that he would never be in active duty. Instead, Albert and Victoria offered to let the prince visit his elder sister in Germany. Eager to once again get away from home and school, Bertie agreed.\n\n- This trip was actually a ruse. Victoria had contacted Princess Vicky months before and told Vicky to find Bertie a wife. They had narrowed the candidates down to one girl, Princess Alexandra of Denmark. She was a pretty, quiet girl, raised in a very sheltered environment, like Bertie. Vicky and Victoria liked her, and she was put in the path of Bertie.\n\n- Bertie wasn't stupid, despite what his mother thought, and knew all this would happen. He did his duty. It helped that he liked \"Alex\" and they got on well. He rather awkwardly proposed to her, and of course, she accepted.\n\n- Now having satisfied his parents, Bertie asked to go see military maneuvers in Ireland. His parents reluctantly accepted, hoping this would end his desire to be an active soldier. It would wind up being a huge mistake.\n\n- Unlike his college chums, the soldiers in Ireland had a much more adult sense of humor. One night, after a night of drinking and partying, the \"lads\" snuck a prostitute, Nellie Clifden, into Bertie's bedroom. They thought it would be a laugh, as Bertie was shy around girls. Instead, Bertie fell in love, and spent a few days in the arms of a notorious prostitute.\n\n- This all became known to Victoria and Albert. They were absolutely shocked and appalled. Bertie had let them down once again, and this time, he had dragged his honor through the mud. If this became public, Albert's great show of a morally upright royal family would be shattered! Victoria refused to talk to Bertie... but Albert was FAR more upset. He decided to head up to Cambridge and put his wayward son straight.\n\n- The meeting with his father was tense and cold. Albert told Bertie that he would leave Cambridge, come home, and marry Princess Alexandra. He would then be watched closely by his parents until such time as he grew up and became a morally upright husband and son. Bertie agreed, and regretfully started to finish up his semester at Cambridge.\n\n- 2 weeks later, his father was dead. Victoria blamed Bertie for the whole affair, including his father's death. She would never forgive him. (Literally.) Bertie himself believed his mother, and thought of himself as the murderer of his own father until the day he died. He immediately returned home, dropping out of Cambridge. His mother refused to be in the same room as him, ordering her attendants to warn her if he was approaching, and to hold him in the next room until she was able to leave.\n\n- Victoria sent Bertie away to the Middle East and Egypt. Once again, Bertie did well, charming his way through the tour and securing Egypt's hold of the Suez Canal against France. None of this would matter to Victoria, though. As soon as he returned, he was ordered to marry Alexandra and move into his own house, away from Victoria. Bertie couldn't get out the door fast enough for either Victoria... or himself.\n\n- So, in 1863, Albert Edward married Alexandra of Denmark, and they moved into Marlborough House. Finally, the 21 year old Bertie and the 18 year old \"Alex\" were free from their controlling families, with no one to tell them what to do, where to go, how to dress, or who to talk to. They immediately became the social center of England's high society.\n\n- The Prince and Princess of Wales spared no expense in partying all day, every day. Marlborough house was THE destination for the elite. Since Victoria was busy mourning, more and more of the powerful and influential became part of Bertie's court. Bertie, more like his grand-uncle George IV than his stodgy father, entertained poets, actors, free-thinkers, and even radicals. He developed a taste for expensive cigars, brandy, and of course... women. Soon, he was taking mistresses. This didn't seem to bother Alex over much, whom it seems was truly in love with Albert Edward. In the first 3 years of their marriage, they had 2 children. Victoria had tried to tell Bertie what to name his own children. Bertie conceded, on the condition that it only be his first child that would be so named. So, the first son was named \"Albert Victor,\" according to the queen's rather selfish wishes. The second would be named \"George Frederick\" much to the consternation of Victoria, who hated her uncles. The Hanoverian curse had come to mother and son... petty squabbles, rival courts, and all.\n\n- Now, Albert Edward just gave in to his base impulses. He decided to become everything his mother hated. He drank excessively. He smoked excessively. He had sex with mistresses excessively. He gambled excessively. Though he and Alex would have three more children, Louise in 1867, Victoria in 1868, and Maud in 1869, Bertie was neglectful, often spending days or weeks away from home, often in the arms of other women. It was said that \"Long ago we had Edward the Confessor... now we have Edward the Caress-er!\"\n\n- And what women they were! Bertie was always attracted to strong women. (Mommie issues? You betcha!) Strong women were not... proper... in Victorian times. He bedded outspoken women, notorious prostitutes, and unhappy housewives. To most of his subjects, the Prince of Wales was just another George IV... a decadent playboy without a brain in his head. This wasn't the case. Bertie wasn't stupid, he just craved the attention. He hated being idle. But his mother made sure he stayed idle, out of her disgust of him.\n\n- The Queen and her husband had always worked on royal affairs together, as a team. When Albert died, she took all the work on herself. Bertie offered to help his mother time and again, asking to be allowed a key to the royal documents cabinet. She flat out refused, saying that the prince was not discreet, intelligent, or trustworthy enough to hold such a responsibility. This only further frustrated Bertie, who then sank deeper into his excessive lifestyle... and the cycle continued to repeat itself.\n\n- Bertie's affairs became the stuff of legend. It is unknown how many women he had, but he was known to have had an affair with Lily Langtree, the world renowned actress, singer Hortense Schneider, various noble divorcees and widows, a notorious prostitute named \"La Barucci,\" a rather naughty girl named Jenny Jerome... (who would marry Randolph Churchill and have a son named Winston,) and another woman named Alice Keppel, whose great granddaughter would be named Camilla Parker Bowles... who is of course currently married to the current Prince of Wales... after being his mistress.\n\n- In 1869, Bertie's lifestyle finally came to bite him in the arse. He had fallen for a young girl named Sarah Mordaunt, a giddy and talkative young girl who also happened to be married to a member of Parliament, Sir Charles Mordaunt. Charles was an old man, who enjoyed hunting and fishing. His wife enjoyed talking, men, parties, men, and occasionally men, as well. Charles was smitten with his pretty, young-enough-to-be-his-daughter wife, and bought her two beautiful horses from the royal family as a gift. People warned him that his wife and the Prince of Wales were flirting, but he wasn't hearing it. So, he bought the horses, but the Prince waited until Charles went to Sweden on a fishing trip to deliver the horses. (Wink... wink...) So, there's Bertie, still flush after a little \"alone time\" with Mrs. Mordaunt, smoking on the patio. Sarah is showing off her beloved horses, when who should come home early? Yup, Charles. See, the fishing was bad in Scandinavia because of a heat wave... so he had returned home. Charles flew into a complete rage. Prince Edward beat a hasty retreat. Charles dragged the two horses out, and made his wife watch while he literally shot both horses point blank in the head. But it didn't end there.\n\n- 9 months later, Sarah was pregnant. By then, Charles had at least let himself believe that Sarah had \"just talked\" with the Prince. But then, Sarah dropped a bombshell... the baby wasn't only not his, it could actually have been four or five different men who had fathered the child. Charles was done. He filed for divorce. He named, as a second respondent to the divorce proceedings.... the Prince of Wales, heir to the throne of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. The scandal made the front page news.\n\n- Bertie didn't know what to do.... he was to be dragged before a court of law, something that hadn't happened to a royal since Charles I.... and not done by a legal government since Catherine Howard, Henry VIII's fifth wife. Victoria was beyond angry... but she at least knew what to do. She set up a legal defense, pointing out that insane people couldn't be divorced, by law. So, Bertie went to court, not to prove his innocence, but to prove Sarah's insanity.\n\n- This trick worked. It also helped that rather than stand before the judge, Bertie got to sit next to the judge and whisper in his ear. The whole thing was an obvious sham. Sir Charles was forced to sit and watch as the smug prince denied ever having sex with Sarah. Sarah had to watch helplessly as Bertie was exonerated without counter-examination, and she was declared mentally insane. Charles could now not divorce her, and she spent the rest of her life in an insane asylum... but Bertie had gotten away with it.... at least... in the eyes of the court. The people of England were not so forgiving, nor was the press, and least of all, the Queen. The only one that forgave him was his wife, ever quietly at his side.\n\n- This was the final straw for most people. Bertie was an adulterer, no matter what the courts said. The Queen was absent from all public functions. The people had had enough... republicanism suddenly became a real threat. Mobs were forming in Trafalgar Square. The monarchy was a hair's breadth from being overthrown... then... a miracle happened.\n\n- The prince suddenly developed typhoid fever... the same disease that had killed his father, (allegedly.) The queen, suddenly overcome with fear of losing her son, threw herself into his care. Photos of the sick prince being cared for by a weeping mother made it to the newspapers... the hatred and anger of the people melted away.... somehow, the thought of the prince laid low, possibly dying, sent shivers down the spines of the masses. How would the poor old queen survive such a terrible blow? The whole country held its breath, waiting for reports. On the anniversary of his father's death, Bertie's health suddenly became much worse. The doctors said he wouldn't survive... then somehow... he pulled through. Within a couple weeks, he was walking again... as soon as he was able, he and his mother went to church together, publicly thanking the country for their support and love. The people ate it up... and Bertie, suddenly a bit more sober from his brush with death, went back home to his wife.\n\n- Had Victoria given her son more responsibility, he might have stayed with his wife... but this was not to be. Victoria continued to deny him access to important documents. However, she did let him work on charitable projects. Prince Edward redefined the way a royal acts, throwing himself into charitable works. Ribbon cuttings, donations, public appearances and world tours became his meat and potatoes. This tradition continues today. It made Bertie incredibly popular, at a time when his mother was still sequestering herself behind locked doors.\n\n- Bertie particularly loved going to Paris. He made a month long trip there every year. Why? Prostitution was legal there, of course. Bertie was soon back to his voracious ways, often buying three or four prostitutes a night. At one brothel, he had his own golden tub, often filled with champagne, and a specially built love seat that would allow him to receive sex from a couple women at once. He was there so often that they simply reserved a room for him at all times. He continued to have mistresses at home, too... but in this, he was far more discreet. His wife simply came to accept this as a truth about her husband. She did not complain.\n\n- In 1875, Bertie was sent by his mother to India, to begin a tour there. In the beginning, he spent his time murdering the local wildlife, as was customary for men in those days. But, while there, he became unnerved by the desperate poverty that Indians lived in. He was appalled at the way most British lived in splendor while the Indians barely scraped by. He famously said, \"Because a man has a black face and a different religion from our own, there is no reason why he should be treated as a brute.\" He would spend the rest of his life fighting against racism, which he saw as a disgusting practice.\n\n- When he returned, very proud of the work he had done there, he found out his mother had declared herself Empress of India... once again, he had been used by his mother as a popularity gauge, and this time, she had used HIS popularity to promote herself. Bertie was furious, once again feeling like the infant boy sent to \"go play\" by mommy. Relations between the two soured once again.\n\n- Edward worked hard to renew himself as the center of social life. In doing so, he reinvented fashion and culture in England. The pull-up, fold down collar was his invention, as was the habit of leaving the bottom button of the shirt unbuttoned. (He was quite fat by then.) In addition, Edward's favorite Sunday meal of roast beef, potatoes, horseradish sauce, and Yorkshire pudding became first a fad, then a Sunday staple, and is now simply tradition in England as \"Sunday Dinner.\" Bertie was a stickler for proper etiquette and fashion. He was known to admonish people who didn't wear proper dress in his home. He was very strict towards his children on how they dressed, and was NEVER seen in public with dirty or disheveled clothes.\n\n- In the field of art and science, Prince Edward was an avid believer that class should not restrict access to learning. He encouraged universities to let poor people attend. When that didn't work, he actually PAID for poor people to attend university by the droves. This led to easier schooling such as more relaxed uniform standards, more comprehensive testing, and lower tuition fees. No longer would education only be the realm of the nobility and high society.\n\n- As the prince grew into an old man, his temper grew worse. He was known to lash out at guests, but was also known to calm down just as quickly. He often felt guilty for his temper, treating people extra nicely afterwards... However, he never stopped gambling, drinking, or whoring.... and it would again come back to haunt him.\n\n- In 1891, the prince played one of his notorious baccarat games with several of his friends. Baccarat was illegal in England, but no one cared... they were rich, and above the law... and besides, no one would ever tell about being at a game, as it would incriminate themselves. But... at this particular game, a man was accused of cheating. He was forced to sign a document saying he'd never play cards again, and that would have been the end of it, if someone, (Bertie,) hadn't have told his mistress about the whole thing...\n\n- Daisy Greville, (the girl from the song \"Daisy, Daisy\") was the current and longest running mistress of the prince. She was gorgeous, charming, and bubbly. Unfortunately, she was also known as \"The Babbling Brooke,\" because she could never keep a secret. Once Bertie had told her about the cheater, it was suddenly all over every circle of High Society. The man, shamed by everyone around him, fought back by suing everyone at the game for slander... including the prince. Once again, Bertie was dragged into court. Soon after, Bertie and Daisy had a fight... and another man came along to woo her... Bertie stopped that immediately, and the man threatened to make Bertie's private life public. The two men hated each other for the rest of their lives, though Bertie and Daisy reconciled.\n\n- In order to repair the royal family's image, the Prince decided to get his son and future heir, Albert Victor, a wife. Albert Victor was engaged to Mary of Teck. Albert Victor had had his own share of scandals.... \"Prince Eddie\" had been accused of soliciting male prostitutes, which was punishable by death in those days. Although he was cleared of the charges, the stigma still hung over him. In addition, the \"Jack the Ripper\" murders were in full swing... and some even began to suggest that \"Prince Eddie\" was the culprit! A royal marriage was just what the world needed.... but instead, a royal tragedy would once again repair Bertie's image.\n\n- The influenza epidemic hit London like a train wreck. Prince Eddie caught the flu, which turned into pneumonia, and died within a week. Albert Edward was heartbroken. The whole nation mourned with him. Mary of Teck was instead engaged to George Frederick, the second son... and now, socially awkward, serious George was in line for the throne... much to his frustration.\n\n- In 1901, Victoria finally died. Prince Albert Edward became King Edward VII at the age of 60. He refused to be King Albert I, saying that his father's name should stand alone, as no one could possibly live up to it. The first thing he did was to donate the Osborne House to the country. He detested it, though his mother had adored it. It was converted into a museum.\n\n- His coronation had to be delayed. Feeling ill, he still trudged on to make his coronation a HUGE affair, full of pomp and circumstance. He reasoned that England NEEDED show and ceremony after the dreary mourning his mother had preferred. Getting sicker, he refused to lay down.... then, it was found out that he had appendicitis. He demanded that he be carried to his coronation, but the doctors refused. The whole country held its breath once again... would the king die before his coronation? The answer was, \"NO.\" Bertie pulled through again, and his coronation was HUGE!\n\n- Edward VII was determined to make the royal family as showy as possible. The people needed something to take pride in, he reasoned, and majesty was one way for England to shine. The people ate it up, and it has become the standard of the royal family ever since. While other royals have become regular folks living in big, but normal looking homes, the English royals still cart around in golden carts led by teams of horses...they lead parades... they dress in regalia... and the English somehow still love it.\n\n- For the first time, England's king had good credit. His mother had been frugal, and though Edward VII was a partier, he also surrounded himself with businessmen, Jewish investors and bankers, and men of finance. The monarchy was actually MAKING money, which of course could not be taxed.\n\n- Surprisingly, Edward turned out to be an excellent king. He was popular, he constantly made appearances in public, often just talking to people and laughing along with them. He ate with commoners, smoked cigars at the race track, cut ribbons at universities he helped fund, and generally devoted his life to making England a better, less racist, and fairer place.\n\n- But now, a new threat raised its head. The king's nephew, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, had grown into a hot headed, rude, nasty piece of work. Edward VII hated him, and the feeling was mutual. It was clear to Edward, who had always been good at judging people, that England had to break its ties to ancestral Germany... and find a new friend. And for that, he would turn to England's most hated rival of all time.\n\n- Edward VII was called the \"Uncle of Europe,\" and with good reason. He was the uncle by marriage of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, the uncle of Wilhelm II of Germany; Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, Crown Princess Marie of Romania, Crown Princess Sophia of Greece, and Empress Alexandra of Russia were his nieces; Haakon VII of Norway was both his nephew by marriage and his son-in-law; Frederick VIII of Denmark and George I of Greece were his brothers-in-law; Albert I of Belgium, Ferdinand of Bulgaria, and Charles I and Manuel II of Portugal were his second cousins.... he knew that if Europe was to know peace, it would be by his hand. He decided to head into Europe.\n\n- Edward VII's publicity tour was a HUGE success. Russia, Scandinavia, Greece, and Portugal were now staunch allies of England... and he ended his trip in France. His advisers warned him, France was furious at England over the Boer Wars and many other conflicts. He was actually booed when he stepped off the train.\n\n- Edward VII didn't let the boos get to him... he smiled, waved, and called France his \"Home away from home,\" and the \"Only place he was truly comfortable.\" This was all true, of course... he knew every bar, club, brothel, and coffee house in Paris. The French loved him for it. By the time he left, the French were celebrating him in magazines, newspapers, and even song. Edward VII proposed an alliance... an \"Entente Cordiale,\" to be signed between France and England. The English government was furious, the people were stunned. France? FRANCE? How could he propose such a thing? But Edward VII laid it out for everyone. Germany was an issue, and England would soon need all the help it could get... as would France. Put aside Napoleon, the 100 years' war, and all the hate. Learn to talk before killing. The people loved it. France loved it... and the \"Triple Entente\" was soon created with Russia and France, to solidify the deal.\n\n- Edward VII steered England into alliances and friendships all over the world. He reformed the army after the disastrous Boer wars, and dedicated his life to improving the lot of the poor and minorities. He said that the use of the word \"nigger\" was to be ended, as it was a \"disgusting and vile word.\" In a famous meeting of nations, Wilhelm II went on about the \"Yellow Menace\" of Japan, and admonished Edward VII for supporting the Japanese, even going so far as saying Edward had committed \"Race Treason.\" Edward said, \"I can not see it. The Japanese are an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilized as the Europeans, from whom they only differ by the pigmentation of their skin.\"\n\n- In the last year of his life, Parliament was imploding... The Lords and the Commons were at it again, this time over the budget. Huge names like Churchill, Lloyd-George, and Balfour were becoming big. Edward VII detested the politics, and tried to let them all get on with it. However, he was eventually forced to come in and break a deadlock. In the end, the Lords were denied their right to ever veto a money bill again. Edward wasn't happy with the result, but by then his health was failing.\n\n- All the years of dissolute living finally caught up to him in 1910. He had smoked 12 cigars and 20 cigarettes a day. He drank constantly. He ate whatever he wanted. Now, he had diabetes, cancer, and chronic bronchitis. Yet, like his father, he refused to sit still or slow down. After a series of heart attacks, it was apparent he was not long for this world. Even still, he refused to lie down, working at his desk until he fell unconscious. That night, his son, George, came in to tell him that his horse had won at a local race. The king said, \"Yes, I have heard of it. I am very glad.\" He then went to sleep for the last time, and died peacefully at 11:30 pm.j At his side were his wife, his longtime mistress Daisy, his children, and his pets. He was finally at peace.\n\n- Edward VII was an oddity... a dissolute and boisterous king who lacked real intelligence... but in a world where the Parliament does the hard work... England found out that charm, charisma, and a healthy sense of humor would serve the royals more than power... England would soon need a really powerful monarch... could Edward's quiet son, George V, be that monarch?\n\nTune in next time!"
