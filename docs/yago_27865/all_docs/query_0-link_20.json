        "text": "Albert Edward, Prince of Wales married Princess Alexandra of Denmark on 10 March 1863 at Windsor Castle. The Prince and Princess of Wales, Bertie and Alix, as they were known, went on to have six children, five surviving to adulthood.\n\nThe nine children of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert married into many European royal households and subsequently, King Edward VII was known as the uncle of Europe. His sister Victoria married Prince Frederick William of Prussia, making Bertie the uncle of the German Kaiser, Willhelm II.\n\nAlix’s younger sister Dagmar was the wife of Tsar Alexander III and the mother of Tsar Nicholas II. This makes Edward VII the uncle of Tsar Nicholas II via marriage and the uncle of Nicholas’ wife, another Alexandra (of Hesse and the Rhine) through her mother and Edward VII’s sister, Princess Alice of Hesse.\n\nPrince Albert Victor Christian Edward, Duke of Clarence and Avondale\n\nHe was born prematurely on 8 January 1864 and died on 14 January 1892\n\nI’ve discussed Prince Albert Victor in other posts. He was posthumously accused of being Jack the Ripper and was engaged to Princess May of Teck but died of influenza before they could marry. She later became engaged to his brother, Prince George, the Duke of York. Eddy, as he was known, was considered educationally subnormal by his tutors and today would probably be diagnosed with ADHD or similar. It was a trait that echoed his father’s schoolroom career, his early death denied him the opportunity of proving his doubters wrong.\n\nPrince George Frederick Ernest Albert, Duke of York. Married Princess May of Teck\n\nHe was born prematurely on 3 June 1865 and died on 20 January 1936\n\nHe succeeded his father to the throne, he reigned from 6 May 1910 to his death. You can read my Thoughts on George V here.\n\nPrincess Louise Victoria Alexandra Dagmar, later Princess Royal. Married Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife\n\nShe was born prematurely 20 February 1867 and died 4 January 1931\n\nPrincess Victoria Alexandra Olga Mary\n\nShe was born 6 July 1868 and died on 3 December 1935\n\nVictoria was her mother’s companion and never married. She spoke to her brother, the King, daily, and was once overheard saying to him, ‘Hello, you old fool’.\n\nPrincess Maud Charlotte Mary Victoria\n\nShe was born on 26 November 1869 and died 20 November 1938. Married Prince Carl of Denmark\n\nPrince Carl of Denmark was Maud’s cousin. He was elected King of Norway in 1905. Prince Carl became King Haakon VII and their son Crown Prince Olav. Carl and Maud were crowned King and Queen of Norway on 22 June 1906.\n\nPrince Alexander John Charles Albert\n\nHe was born 6 April 1871 and died 7 April 1871\n\nThis little prince was born prematurely and lived only 24 hours. He is buried at Sandringham.\n\nPhotos from Pinterest"
