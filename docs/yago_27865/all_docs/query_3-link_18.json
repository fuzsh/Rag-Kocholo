        "text": "by Susan Flantzer © Unofficial Royalty 2013\n\nThe eldest son and second of nine children of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, King Edward VII was born on November 9, 1841, at Buckingham Palace in London, England. He was given the names Albert Edward in honor of his father and his maternal grandfather Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and was called Bertie by his family. The infant prince was christened at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on January 25, 1842, by William Howley, Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nHis godparents were:\n\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia\n\nPrince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge (his great-uncle)\n\nPrince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (his great-uncle)\n\nThe Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (born Duchess Marie of Württemberg, his step-grandmother)\n\nThe Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (born Landgravine Karoline Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, his step-great-grandmother and the step-mother of Prince Albert’s mother)\n\nPrincess Sophia of the United Kingdom (his great-aunt)\n\nBertie had eight siblings:\n\nVictoria, Princess Royal (1840-1901) married Friedrich III, German Emperor and King of Prussia, had four sons and four daughters\n\nPrincess Alice (1843-1878) married Ludwig IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, had two sons and five daughters\n\nPrince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1844-1900) married Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia, had one son and four daughters\n\nPrincess Helena (1846-1923) married Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, had two sons and two daughters\n\nPrincess Louise (1848-1939) married John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, 9th Duke of Argyll, no children\n\nPrince Arthur, Duke of Connaught (1850-1942) married Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia, had one son and two daughters\n\nPrince Leopold, Duke of Albany (1853-1884) married Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont, had one son and one daughter\n\nPrincess Beatrice (1857-1944) married Prince Henry of Battenberg, had three sons and one daughter\n\nAs the eldest son of the British monarch, he was automatically Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay at birth. Through his father Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, he was also Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Duke of Saxony. When Bertie was one month old, he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester. Bertie’s parents were determined to give him an education that would prepare him for his future role, but he did not have the aptitude for studies. Instead, his strengths were his social skills.\n\nBertie’s father, Prince Albert, died on December 14, 1861. The month before, Prince Albert had been informed of rumors that Bertie was having an affair with an Irish actress while doing army service in Ireland. Already feeling ill, Prince Albert went to Ireland to discuss the affair with his son. For the rest of her life, Queen Victoria blamed Bertie for his father’s death.\n\nQueen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her husband Prince Albert had been seeking a bride for their eldest son, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, known in the family as Bertie. Victoria and Albert’s eldest daughter Victoria, Princess Royal, Crown Princess of Prussia, known as Vicky in the family, was enlisted to help with the search. Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel, had originally been fifth on the list of potential brides. However, Vicky thought Alix, as she was called in her family, would be the perfect match for Bertie and she sent back glowing reports of her to Victoria and Albert. Prince Albert concluded that Alix was “the only one to be chosen”. Vicky then arranged the first meeting between Alix and Bertie in Speyer Cathedral, then in the Kingdom of Prussia, now in Germany, on September 24, 1861. On September 9, 1862, after the death of his father in December 1861, Bertie proposed to Alix at the Royal Palace of Laeken, the home of his great-uncle King Leopold I of the Belgians. The couple was married at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle on March 10, 1863. Queen Victoria, in perpetual mourning for Prince Albert, watched the ceremony from Catherine of Aragon’s Closet overlooking the left side of the altar.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wedding of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and Princess Alexandra of Denmark\n\nBertie and Alix had six children:\n\nPrince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (1864 – 1892), unmarried\n\nKing George V (1865 – 1936), married 1893 Princess Mary of Teck; had children\n\nPrincess Louise, Princess Royal (1867 – 1931), married 1889 Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife, had children\n\nPrincess Victoria (1868 – 1935), unmarried\n\nPrincess Maud (1869 – 1938), married King Haakon VII of Norway; had one son\n\nPrince Alexander John (born and died 1871), lived one day\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales, Bertie and Alix, made their homes at Marlborough House near Buckingham Palace in London and Sandringham House in Norfolk, England, purchased by Queen Victoria for Bertie and Alix. It is still a privately owned residence of the British monarch.\n\nDuring his marriage, Bertie had quite many mistresses. Apparently, Alix knew about many of them and accepted them. Among the women, Bertie socialized with were: the actress Lillie Langtry; Lady Randolph Churchill (born Jennie Jerome in the USA, was the mother of Winston Churchill); Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; actress Sarah Bernhardt; and Alice Keppel, the great-grandmother of Queen Camilla.\n\nAfter waiting 59 years, Bertie became king upon the death of his mother on January 22, 1901. The coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra was held at Westminster Abbey on August 9, 1902. Originally scheduled for June 26, it had to be postponed because the new king developed appendicitis. Bertie and Alix began the practice of the royal family’s public appearances as we now know them during Queen Victoria’s withdrawal after her husband’s death, and they continued this during Bertie’s reign. The king had royal palaces repaired and reintroduced traditional ceremonies, such as the State Opening of Parliament, that Queen Victoria had not attended.\n\nKing Edward VII was known as “the Uncle of Europe” because he was related to many other royals:\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II of Germany was his nephew\n\nNicholas II, Emperor of All Russia was his nephew by marriage\n\nQueen Victoria Eugenie of Spain, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, Queen Marie of Romania, Queen Sophie of Greece, and Empress Alexandra of Russia were his nieces\n\nKing Haakon VII of Norway was both his nephew by marriage and his son-in-law\n\nKing George I of Greece and King Frederik VIII of Denmark were his brothers-in-law\n\nKing Albert I of the Belgians, Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria, and King Carlos I of Portugal, and King Manuel II of Portugal were his second cousins\n\nBertie’s habits did not keep him in the best of health. He ate too much and usually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day. He began to suffer from chronic bronchitis. In March 1910 while vacationing in Biarritz, France, Bertie collapsed and remained in Biarritz to recuperate. On April 27, 1910, he returned to Buckingham Palace. Queen Alexandra had also been away but started her return trip home as soon as she knew about her husband’s condition and arrived in London on May 5.\n\nOn May 6, 1910, Bertie insisted that his valet dress him in his frock coat and formal clothes before he received his private secretary Francis Knollys and his good friend Ernest Cassel. During the afternoon, the king suffered a series of heart attacks, but he refused to be put into bed, sitting instead in a chair. Alix sent for Alice Keppel, Bertie’s mistress, and arranged for her to see the king during one of his periods of consciousness. His son George, soon to be king, told him that his horse, Witch of the Air, had won at Kempton Park that afternoon. The king replied, “I am very glad,” his last words. After waiting 59 years to become king and reigning for nine years, King Edward VII lapsed into a coma and died peaceably just before midnight on May 6, 1910, at the age of 68.\n\nKing Edward VII was buried at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on May 20, 1910. Barbara Tuchman opens The Guns of August, her great book about World War I, a war that would cause the extinction of many European monarchies, with a description of Edward VII’s funeral:\n\n“So gorgeous was the spectacle in the May morning of 1910 when nine kings rode in the funeral of Edward VII of England that the crowd, waiting in hushed and black-clad awe, could not keep back gasps of admiration. In scarlet and blue and green and purple, three by three the sovereigns rode through the palace gates, with plumed helmets, gold braid, crimson sashes, and jeweled orders flashing in the sun. After them came five heirs apparent, seven queens – four dowagers and three regnant – and a scattering of special ambassadors from uncrowned countries. Together they represented seventy nations in the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and, of its kind, the last.”\n\nYouTube: Funeral of Edward VII\n\nThames Web: The Funeral of King Edward VII\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
