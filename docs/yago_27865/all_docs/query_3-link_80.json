        "text": "Menu dated 10th February 1904\n\n​\n\nRoyal Wedding Banquet, Windsor Castle, hosted by Their Majesties King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom for the marriage of Her Royal Highness Princess Alice of Albany to His Serene Highness Prince Alexander of Teck (the future Earl and Countess of Athlone).\n\n​\n\nSymbolically this wedding of Queen Victoria’s granddaughter, Princess Alice of Albany, took place in the same St. George’s Chapel at the same Windsor Castle on the same date that Queen Victoria herself was married in 1840.\n\nPrincess Alice was the niece of King Edward VII; her father being the King’s brother, Prince Leopold. However her father died prematurely 20 years earlier, so it was left to the King himself to give away the bride.\n\nOn this day, crowds gathered outside the royal chapel to witness the arrival of four magnificent processions: the first being the Queen of Württemberg followed by the Queen Mother of the Netherlands; then King Edward VII alongside Queen Alexandra; before the much anticipated arrival of the royal bride.\n\nFollowing the wedding ceremony, as The Times reported, the King gave a \"grand banquet at the Castle in honour of the bride and bridegroom and 8 o'clock\". that consisted of 14 courses in the St George’s Hall. The dinner, which started at 8:30pm, commenced with a bowl of turtle consommé garnished with quenelles shaped as turtle-eggs: a highly fashionable dish in royal courts of the day.\n\n​\n\n“The only special incident”, reported the New York Times in 1904, “was the arrest of an alleged lunatic, who, flourishing a swordstick, molested the guests arriving from London”."
