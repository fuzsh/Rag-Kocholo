As history affords no retakes, we appreciate what has been left to us. Please note that we do not computer enhance or alter the original image in any way, as we feel its eccentricities contribute to its historic character. Thank you for taking this into consideration before making your purchase.\n\nSepia tone is available as an alternative to black and white. Color prints are also available in either black and white or sepia. There is no additional charge for this service. If you would like a tone different from the one pictured, please contact us after placing your order. Your print will arrive in the tone pictured unless otherwise instructed."
