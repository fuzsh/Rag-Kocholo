Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlbert Edward, or Edward VII, was born on November 9, 1841, and he died on May 6, 1910. He was the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and he was also the Emperor of India. His reign started on January 22, 1901, and ended with his death in 1910.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the Edward VII or alternatively, you can download our 24-page Edward VII worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nEdward VII was born at Buckingham Palace, London, on November 9, 1841.\n\nEdward VII was the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nSince he was a royal child, he was related to royalty throughout Europe.\n\nAs the eldest son, Edward VII was automatically the heir apparent or the person in the first line of succession.\n\nHe held the title of the Prince of Wales.\n\nHe was automatically the Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay, being the eldest son of the British sovereign.\n\nEdward also held the titles of Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke of Saxony.\n\nOn December 8, 1841, he became the Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester. Furthermore, he became the Earl of Dublin on September 10, 1849; the Knight of Garter on November 9, 1858; and the Knight of Thistle on May 24, 1867.\n\nDuring Queen Victoria’s reign, Edward was politically powerless.\n\nNevertheless, he became the symbol or personification of the fashionable, leisurely elite.\n\nOn January 25, 1842, Edward was christened as Albert Edward at St. George Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nHis name, Albert, was derived from his father.\n\nThe name Edward, was given in honor of the Queen’s father, his maternal grandfather, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn.\n\nThroughout his life, the royal family called him Bertie.\n\nEdward travelled throughout Britain to perform ceremonial duties. He also visited abroad and represented Britain.\n\nHe renounced his succession rights to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in favor of Prince Alfred, his younger brother, in 1863.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nEdward received an education that would prepare him to be a constitutional monarch, given that he was the heir apparent of the British Sovereign.\n\nAn educational program was devised by Prince Albert and supervised by several tutors.\n\nHowever, Edward did not excel in his studies, unlike Victoria, his elder sister.\n\nNevertheless, Edward’s charm, though not found in his academic diligence, was found in his charisma, sociability, and tact.\n\nRobert Bruce, a personal governor, replaced Edward’s tutor after Edward completed his secondary-level studies.\n\nEdward took an educational trip to Rome in the first few months of 1859.\n\nIn the summer of 1859, Edward studied at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nHe then matriculated as an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford, in October 1859.\n\nDuring this time, Edward was released from the academic agendas imposed by his parents.\n\nHe enjoyed studying freely and performed well on exams. Edward transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1861.\n\nIt was in this college that he was tutored in history by Regius Professor of Modern History, Charles Kingsley.\n\nIt was because of Kingsley’s teaching efforts that the academic excellence of Edward was brought forth.\n\nADULTHOOD\n\nEdward toured North America in 1860 as the Prince of Wales.\n\nThe tour boosted his self-esteem and resulted in diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.\n\nEdward wanted to pursue a military career but was not supported by his parents.\n\nIn 1861, Edward was sent to Germany to meet with Princess Alexandra of Denmark.\n\nHis parents decided that they should marry.\n\nTheir meeting at Speyer on September 24th went well for both sides, and the marriage plans advanced. However, Edward was sort of a playboy.\n\nHe attended maneuvers in Ireland to get army experience, and during his stay, he spent three nights with Nellie Clifden, an actress who was hidden in the camp by fellow officers.\n\nAlbert, who was ill, reprimanded him. Albert died in December 1861.\n\nEdward and Alexandra married on March 10, 1863.\n\nACCESSION\n\nOn January 22, 1901, Queen Victoria died. Edward became King of the United Kingdom, Emperor of India, and King of British Dominions.\n\nEdward chose to reign under the name of Edward VII, as Albert Edward would undervalue the name of Albert, his father.\n\nEdward was crowned on August 9, 1902, at the Westminster Abbey.\n\nEdward VII was noted to have played a role in the modernization of the British Home Fleet.\n\nHe had the reputation of being a peacemaker for fostering good relations between Britain and other European countries.\n\nThe period in which Edward VII ruled was called the Edwardian era.\n\nDEATH\n\nKing Edward VII’s death was caused by diseases due to his habitual smoking.\n\nHe died on May 6, 1910. His final words were, “Yes, I have heard of it. I am very glad.” That was his reply when he was told that his horse had won at Kempton Park.\n\nEdward VII Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the Edward VII across 24 in-depth pages.
