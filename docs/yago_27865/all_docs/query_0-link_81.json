        "text": "There weren't a whole lot of candidates AFAIK.\n\nThe only ones that were ever under serious consideration were Alix of Denmark and Marie of the Netherlands. Marie even Victoria despaired of as being far too plain to hold Bertie's attention. As far as Alix was concerned, when it became clear she was the only suitable candidate, Victoria glanced at her portrait and said: \"What a pity she is who she is\". However, darling Albert was full-on in favor of the match, which meant Victoria went along with the idea full-steam ahead. However, that doesn't mean Victoria was thrilled, since when the future Frederik VIII was proposed for one of her daughters Helena or Louisa, she flat out refused, because one match with Denmark was (in her opinion) one match too many.\n\nAlbert became obsessed with marrying Bertie off quickly, which rather restricted the pool of candidates.\n\nIt was quite unusual for a prince to marry quite so young, in contrast his brother-in-law Fritz of Prussia was in his late 20s when he married the 17 year old Princess Royal.\n\nAlexandra proved to be something of the Royal Family's saving grace in the late 1860s and 1870s when Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales's popularity was often very low. She was often viewed as the most beloved member of the Royal Family as she was very committed to social causes, something which Victoria admired on the one hand but was irked by on the other. It helped of course that she was percieved as very beautiful by the standards of the time.\n\nIts interesting to speculate how a a replacement Princess of Wales would have managed.\n\nHad Alexandra and Bertie not married, she would have probably ended up as Tsarina of Russia or at the very least widow of the Tsarevich, assuming Grand Duke Nicholas still dies tragically young.\n\nTsar Alexander II was quite annoyed that Bertie had snagged Alexandra and made it clear to Christian IX that he wanted Dagmar and didn't want her to be matched with anyone else.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth of Wied was the daughter of Hermann, Prince of Wied. She became the spouse of King Carol I of Romania.\n\nPrincess Marie Gasparine of Saxe-Altenburg was the daughter of Prince Eduard of Saxe-Altenburg. She married Prince Charles Gonthier of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen.\n\nI've got the feeling that a heir to the British throne at that particular time would not marry a member of a relatively minor house such as the Saxe-Altenburgs (daughter of a 'mere' Reuss princess), and certainly not a member of a mere mediatized house just as the Wieds.\n\nThen again, Edward VII's heir did marry a morganaut, and some of the marriage of his younger siblings (to a Waldeck-Pyrmont and even to a Campbell) were not that prestigious either. But then again, theywere 'just' younger siblings.\n\nI've got the feeling that a heir to the British throne at that particular time would not marry a member of a relatively minor house such as the Saxe-Altenburgs (daughter of a 'mere' Reuss princess), and certainly not a member of a mere mediatized house just as the Wieds.\n\nThen again, Edward VII's heir did marry a morganaut, and some of the marriage of his younger siblings (to a Waldeck-Pyrmont and even to a Campbell) were not that prestigious either. But then again, theywere 'just' younger siblings.\n\nI don't know if Elisabeth of Wied was ever a serious candidate for Edward VII, but she was certainly a serious candidate for his brother Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nQueen Elisabeth of Romania liked to tell her niece by marriage and Duke Alfred's daughter, Queen Marie of Romania of the time in the 1860s when her father came to Wied to court her. Apparently Alfred was so frightened by Elisabeth's unusual behaviour, as well as her unorthodox family, he left as soon as he could.\n\nAlbert had political ambitions and believed these could be achieved through marriage. Victoria had lower standards for marriage than Prince Albert. Its fairly certain had he lived Helena, Louise and even Beatrice would have made far grander marriages but it suited Victoria's agenda to have them marry minor royals and even into the nobility to keep them close by. The Crown Princes of The Netherlands and Denmark were both keen on Helena and Louise but were rebuffed by Victoria.\n\nI've got the feeling that a heir to the British throne at that particular time would not marry a member of a relatively minor house such as the Saxe-Altenburgs (daughter of a 'mere' Reuss princess), and certainly not a member of a mere mediatized house just as the Wieds.\n\nThen again, Edward VII's heir did marry a morganaut, and some of the marriage of his younger siblings (to a Waldeck-Pyrmont and even to a Campbell) were not that prestigious either.

Whilst Royals would prefer higher born nobles it had no legal bearing on the type of nobility\n\nIt's worth noting that in the UK there is no such thing as morganatic marriages. Whilst Royals would prefer higher born nobles it had no legal bearing on the type of nobility\n\nI know. And even under the very strict Ebenb√ºrtigkeit rules the various German sovereign houses followed, a marriage with Saxe-Altenburg and a Wied would not be considered morganatic. But I still doubt it would be acceptable to Prince Albert, especially for a firstborn son."
