        "text": "It all starts in 1934 when a young and bold entrepreneur named Lucien De Puydt begins a Flemish technology company: the Belgian American Radio Corporation (BARCO).\n\nHis ambition is to produce and sell the most significant high-tech consumer product of that era, the radio, in Flanders and its surroundings.\n\nIn our first year, we assemble no less than 2,000 radios.\n\nThe radio market expands rapidly in the 1930s. Lucien De Puydt combines his technical knowhow with a creative import strategy that allows him to assemble radios at a low cost.\n\nDuring that time, radio ownership becomes a reality for more and more people who had only dreamed about it before.\n\nThis is reflected in our first slogan: ‘Your family’s indispensable friend’.\n\nWe successfully make the change to TV technology and launch the first TV prototypes three years ahead of other Belgian manufacturers.\n\nIn 1949, a receiver mast is installed near the office, which makes it possible to test different types of transmission signals from London and Lille.\n\nThis makes Barco TVs the only TVs that can accurately receive television programs from the RTF and the BBC.\n\nWe start to diversify by producing our own jukeboxes. Within a few months, the inventiveness of Barco technicians leads to the creation of the Barcobox. By using a patented I-franc system, café owners are able to install a relatively low-priced jukebox.\n\nThe success is huge, and we have to cope with imitations on a major scale, so that the advertising material always states: Do not be deceived by imitators: they will only cause you trouble.\n\nWe present the first Belgian television with printed circuit boards and semi-modular chassis to the public at the 1959 Brussels TV exhibition, two years ahead of other Belgian television producers.\n\nThe Galaxy, with its 110°; viewing angle tube and its thin, light cabinet, acts as a benchmark for all future generations of TVs.\n\nWe start to produce multi-standard television sets. From now on, our TVs can receive no less than five different transmission standards, which propels TV setmaking to higher levels.\n\nThe most striking aspect, however, is the fact that we are the first producer of universal TV sets with a wireless ultrasonic remote control.\n\nWe develop our own version of the bobbin sensor, which we sell to the blooming Kortrijk textile industry.\n\nOur textile department then proceeds to develop its own electronic loom control, the Stop Control IEI20.\n\nThis device enables users to increase the output of the loom by 10%.\n\nAutomation equipment, including sensors, continues to represent the lion's share of production.\n\nMeet the Traveller: the first portable multi-standard television. Its successor, the Mini Ranger, is a fully transistorized version and will turn out to be one of our greatest success stories.\n\nIt represents the three most important USPs of Barco at that time: multi-standard, transistorization, and a modular chassis.\n\nMaking a successful move into the color television market, we take over the Belgian market by storm.\n\nBarco color televisions were the only ones to receive both PAL and SECAM systems. In other words, multi-standard remains our key focus.\n\nIt allows us to compete with monostandard; giants such as Philips.\n\nIn conjunction with the BRT, the Belgian national radio and television broadcasting station, we develop the first professional CTVM I color studio monitor.\n\nThe product is unique at the time, given that the professional monitor market has not yet switched to color.\n\nThe technical perfection of these systems attracts customers from all over the world.\n\nThanks to our experience with computer technology, we are in a position to design a computer system that can interface with all textile machines.\n\nThe Sycotex system continually monitors textile operations, which results in a considerable rise in output.\n\nIn the years following, the Sycotex is known as the most complete system for quality, storage and planning control.\n\nWe start to focus on video projection in airplanes. One videotape, as opposed to film rolls, can serve various projectors on board an aircraft. This means the video projector has to be able to connect to multiple standards, which is exactly our expertise.\n\nIn addition, our in-flight projectors are able to work with color, while the competition can only generate black and white, or green, images.\n\nOur data projector is an answer to the growing demand for large-screen projectors that can project both sharp alphanumeric data as well as complex charts. We succeed in developing a projector that is able to generate a perfect image with virtually every connection.\n\nThanks to IBM orders, the Barco data projector becomes the de facto standard in the early 1980s.\n\nWe shift our emphasis to precision graphics and visual displays with the launch of the CDCT 5000.\n\nThe 1250-line screen generates an exceptionally detailed image with stable colors. The CDCT 5000 and its successors arouse the interest of IBM and we become the market leader in the area of image processing and, from 1987, also in the area of medical diagnosis.\n\nWe achieve a technological milestone when our new video monitor line, the Color Video Scope (CVS), is introduced.\n\nIt is recognized as the most versatile monitoring system for television studios and is crowned with an Emmy award in 1988.\n\nThe microprocessor is able to produce a uniform image via automatic calibration, a world first.\n\nOur medical displays are off to a flying start with the launch of a 10-inch monitor offering the sharpest image on the market.\n\nIt's how we become the market leader in the area of color monitors for echography and magnetic resonance.\n\nIn addition, we have an intervention-free calibration system, which make Barco displays technologically superior.\n\nAt the end of 1985, we develop the Producer. Aimed at providing productivity in 3D animation, the Producer fits the needs of the modern image production environment.\n\nTwo years later, we expand the Producer system with Creator, a new high resolution paint system, offering the world of reproduction houses, photo retouchers, and graphic designers creative possibilities hitherto unseen.\n\nFor reliable color reproduction in a prepress system a color accurate monitor is essential.\n\nOur Reference Calibrator can easily communicate with the world's most popular color management systems.\n\nIn the booming market for open systems, the Reference Calibrator is acknowledged to be the one and only reference for accurate color on the DTP work desk.\n\nOur rear-projection boardroom solutions make sure all projection and audio-visual equipment is hidden behind the screen, so there are less constraints with regard to room design.\n\nWhat's more, the presenter can stand in front of the image without casting shadows or being blinded by projected light.\n\nWe offer the total package: screen, mechanics, projector, interfacing, and switching.\n\nBuilding on its expertise in color critical video displays, Barco introduces groundbreaking large-scale LED displays for a fast-growing visualization market. The DLite series stood out because of their mechanical modularity design enabling flexibility and easy maintenance.\n\nAt the time, the DLite series were the only displays that were 100% waterproof, which made them the perfect fit for the rental & staging industry and outdoor applications.\n\nOrders for ISIS, the first true large screen LCD display for air traffic control, are booming.\n\nAs opposed to CRT displays, which are notorious for their low contrast, changing colors, and degrading image sharpness, the images represented on the ISIS display remain crisp and stable.\n\nThe special, square display will soon be used by over 20,000 air traffic controllers every day.\n\nPioneers in ultra-high resolution, we introduce the world's first three-chip DLP projectors with a native WUXGA resolution, which is a step up from the common Full HD format.\n\nOver the years, we'll develop a host of Galaxy projector models. They are the ideal solution for markets that require exact 3D data display, virtual prototyping and collaborative videoconferencing.\n\nThe RP-360, a 360° immersive dome for flight simulation, is the most realistic dome for flight training on the market. It is the only system to offer full 360° immersion with rear-projection.\n\nBefore, dome setups were front projected (from behind the pilot) because rear projection (from the outside) would require too many projectors to achieve the same screen resolution. With the RP-360, this limitation is no more.\n\nConnectivity is key in the operating theater. The surgical staff needs to rely on uncompressed, detailed images that are displayed with minimal latency. This helps surgeons to work with optimal hand-eye coordination, for example during minimally invasive surgery.\n\nNexxis is the first platform in the world for OR connectivity, built on the hospital's IP. It ensures fast connectivity of camera images to any display in the OR, without compression or quality loss. Nexxis requires minimal cabling, so the OR remains orderly and the surgical team can work without disturbances.\n\nTo expand the applicability of tiled LCD video walls, we develop the OBLX free-standing structure.\n\nFrom now on, LCD video walls can be mounted anywhere, in control rooms, meeting rooms, lobbies or emergency centers, without the need for wall support. And there is no limit to the horizontal extension!\n\nBarco raises the bar for cinema image quality with the introduction of its first commercially available 6P laser-illuminated projector.This laser projector is not only the most compact 60K lumen projector available at the time, it is also the first laser projector capable of showing 4K content at 60 fps and 3D movies in full 4K resolution.\n\nDermicus, previously known as Barco Demetra, is an intuitive, revolutionizing smart device, and our very first solution in dermatology.\n\nDeveloped with leading experts in the field, Dermicus is built to optimize the dermatologist’s workflow and facilitate the diagnosis of skin conditions.\n\nIt allows to take dermoscopic as well as clinical images and makes mapping, follow-up and comparison of skin lesions smoother and smarter – all in one handy device.\n\nWe claim a renewed focus in high-res indoor LED technology with the launch of the XT series and a strategic partnership with Chinese LED manufacturer Unilumin.\n\n9 XT models are designed to meet the variable needs in control rooms, television studios, lobbies and 3D visualization.\n\nWhenever image quality, reliability and ease-of-installation are key requirements, the XT series is the way to go.\n\nWe expand the ClickShare family with a revolutionary concept in collaborative solutions: wireless conferencing.\n\nEnabling BYOM (Bring Your Own Meeting), as it allows users to host video conferences from their own device in any meeting room.\n\nSeamlessly working with existing video conferencing platforms and AV USB-peripherals like soundbars or cameras, remote meetings are now as intuitive as face-to-face meetings.\n\nWe present MDPC-8127, our first medical grade display designed exclusively for the digital histopathology market.\n\nThe fast, 8MP, ultra-high-definition display receives regulatory clearance as a medical device, including use for primary diagnosis. A world’s first: it’s compatible with multiple whole slide imaging systems.\n\nAs pioneers in direct-view LED, we understand our customers' needs: seamless installation, excellent image quality, and uninterrupted performance.\n\nThese were the focus points of Barco’s development team when designing TruePix. This indoor LED video wall solution is tailored to the requirements of the critical control rooms market and is another leap forward in LED technology.\n\nBarco showcases its HDR Lightsteering during the Asian World Film Festival. The Lightsteering projection technology offers both brighter highlights and darker black levels, to enable a higher dynamic range in the image. It does this by making efficient use of laser-generated light through smart steering.\n\nWith overwhelmingly positive feedback, this demo marks a milestone confirming Barco’s Lightsteering to be the future reference in bringing premium quality to cinema auditoriums.\n\nClickShare CX-50 2nd generation is granted the CO2 Neutral Silver label by leading climate advisory organization CO2logic. The first Barco product to be awarded this label and one of the first carbon-neutral solutions in its market, ClickShare CX-50 2nd gen was designed with sustainability in mind and as a natural extension of Barco’s values and ambitious sustainability goals to lower its own environmental footprint and that of its customers.\n\nBarco's cinema team is honored with the most prestigious award in the film industry: the 2024 Scientific and Engineering Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nThis recognition celebrates their pioneering work in designing and developing cinema laser projection technology, highlighting Barco’s leadership in the cinema industry."
