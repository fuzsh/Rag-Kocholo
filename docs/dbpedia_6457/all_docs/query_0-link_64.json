Brady breaks a leg and while recuperating in Texas the gun shipment is stolen. Complicating matters further the wife of local army major Colton has designs on him, and the local Texas Ranger captain makes him a generous offer to come back to the states and join his outfit. After killing a man in self-defense, Brady slips back over the border and confronts Castro who is not only unhappy that Brady has lost his gun shipment but is about to join forces with Colton to battle the local raiding Apache Indians.",

        "text": "The most impressive aspect of The Wonderful Country is the location shooting in Mexico. At one point a festival is depicted and handheld camera is used among the crowds to impart a real sense of authenticity. I'm sure the photography is damn fine but yet again the print on Prime is cropped from the original ratio and muddy in resolution.\n\nI do find it crazy that in the 2020s we are still having to endure well sub-standard picture quality of classic cinema while everything else is accelerating towards UHD and for all I know UUHD. A proper copy of this film must exist - why not make that one available to us instead? It's not the 1980s anymore.\n\nI wouldâ€¦\n\nThe Wonderful Country is a film that feels like it was made in 1970, and not at the end of the 50s. Its greatest detriment? Mitchum attempting a Mexican accent, because it's not a good rendition. The film ends on an exhilarating final 15 minutes though, and Mitchum delivers on everything else. 1959 may be one of the greatest years for the western genre.\n\nOne of those westerns that was kind of drifting off into the mature themes beneath the action and scenic landscape. Robert Mitchum plays an American living in Mexico as a pistolero for a wealthy Mexican family doing a business deal involving a shimpment of rifles in a town in Texas across the Rio Grande when the wind blows a tumbleweed that spooks his horse which then falls on Mitchum's leg and breaks it. It's pretty awesome. There's a band of warlike Apaches plus a garrison of black cavalry soldiers that includes Satchel Paige led by Gary Merrill who's married to incredible Julie London. Charles McGraw is the doctor in the town that sets Mitchum's leg, and that's also kind of cool to see him in this movie. It has a subdued intensity throughout which works to bring out the characters' more subtle aspects.\n\nRobert Parrish did everything in Hollywood, editor/assistant director/actor, but his directorial efforts are not discussed very often.\n\nStill, if you look at his filmography, most people will point to THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY as his crowning echievement, and even then, it's a very quiet, longing film, filled with Robert Mitchum looking for something that he's never going to find. It isn't the kind of film that makes it to the top of lists because it's so small.\n\nParrish wrote two amazing books about his time in the industry, which inlcudes long passages about acting alongside Charlie Chaplin as a child and working with John Ford on a lot of major projects, so if you have any interest in stories from the Golden Age of The Movies (TM) I highly recommend finding used copies and giving them a read.\n\nOn both sides of the Rio Grande, United States and Mexico, what is the wonderful country?\n\nThe title is a bit misleading given that Mitchum is a disillusioned anti-hero, a homeless opportunist who is not tied to any land. The key to his change is love in a woman.\n\nMeditative pace that gives almost nothing to the action, preferring to favor the psychological design of the characters."
