        "text": "Scientology Network's DOCUMENTARY SHOWCASE, the weekly series providing a platform for independent filmmakers to air films on important social, cultural and environmental issues, presents award-winning documentary The Fantasy Makers, Friday, Nov. 22 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nDirected by Andrew Wall, The Fantasy Makers is a fascinating adventure into the lives of literary legends: George MacDonald, J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, founding fathers of the fantasy genre. From George R.R. Martin to J.K. Rowling, their work still influences the genre to this day.\n\nThis film tells interweaving stories through historical reenactments and interviews with leading scholars. Through visits to Oxford and Cambridge, we see where Tolkien and Lewis spent their academic careers and the South England town that inspired George MacDonald to pioneer this new type of story. It is a film that fans of fantasy won't want to miss. For this is where hobbits, world-building wardrobes and magic sparkled to life in modern-day literature.\n\nIn 2019, The Fantasy Makers claimed top honors for Best Documentary Feature at the International Screen Awards and WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival.\n\nABOUT ANDREW WALL\n\nDirector Andrew Wall stumbled into the world of documentary filmmaking through his part-time work making corporate videos.
