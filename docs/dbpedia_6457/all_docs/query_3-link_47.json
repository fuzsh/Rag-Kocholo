        "text": "“Wow,” Madonna murmured under her breath as she entered the Paris Theater auditorium to a hysterical herd of whooping, hollering fans. It takes a lot, one would imagine, to unsettle the reigning sovereign of shock, and clearly, her Madgesty was flustered. After all, the crowd had been waiting for nearly two hours (in the rain, no less) on Tuesday night for Dolce & Gabbana and the Cinema Society’s much-anticipated debut of Epix’s Madonna: The MDNA Tour, an operatic document of her record-breaking world tour. “Is she here? I haven’t seen her!” a giddy Jenna Lyons had squealed moments before taking her seat. “I feel like I’m sixteen again around Madonna. I remember the last day of school—Madonna’s ‘Holiday’ had just come out. We all had the rubber bracelets, the lace gloves, the whole nine yards.” Needless to say, J. Crew’s president and executive creative director has since traded in her eighties kitsch for the likes of the trim, tailored suit and trademark spectacles she sported at the premiere, but others, like pals Kelly Osbourne and Alison Mosshart, channeled Madonna’s signature bravado in punky leather Proenza Schouler and Rag & Bone getups replete with dip-dyed hair. “I mean, I’m a material girl,” Osbourne smiled, referring to her role as ambassador for Madonna and **Lourdes Leon’**s fashion line. “And once you’re a material girl, you’re always a material girl.” References to royalty were thrown about liberally on the red carpet when Madonna’s name was invoked, but Givenchy’s Riccardo Tisci had a succinct explanation: “What makes her an icon? She’s unreachable, but at the same, she’s very reachable. Everybody understands her.”\n\nCut back to the auditorium, where a marching band cued the ascendance of the queen herself to the stage for a post-screening Q&A session. “That was a load off my back! I can honestly say that now my tour is over,” Madonna exclaimed to rousing applause. She settled back in her director’s chair, adjusting her top hat—the crowning touch to a dapper three-piece Tom Ford suit (“This theater has historical meaning for me, because it opened in 1948, and Marlene Dietrich was here at the ribbon-cutting ceremony—hence my wardrobe!”). Questions flew, and Madonna fielded them with responses fit for the back cover of an autobiography. “I think it’s important for everybody to understand that they’re playing characters when they come into my realm,” she mused. “And we’re telling stories—stories that hopefully everyone can relate to. I take my ideas from everywhere—from things I see on the street, from art, from film. Our inspiration should come from life.” Leaning back in her chair, she smiled. “I can now put my legs up, have a drink, and feel like I finished my job!”\n\nSuch was the scene at Harlow, where material girls and boys alike convened for cocktails (including a potent DeLeón concoction named, simply, MDNA) and comfort foods like grilled cheese slices paired with tomato soup shots, steak sliders, and cones of golden frites wrapped in old editions of The New York Times. Madonna held court at a banquette alongside Tisci, but one got the sense that, as the music ramped up, she wouldn’t be sitting for long. The growing frenzy brought to mind a classic Madonna maxim from the evening: “In my book, if you don’t leave a pound of flesh on the stage every night, you’re not doing your job.” All hail the queen."
