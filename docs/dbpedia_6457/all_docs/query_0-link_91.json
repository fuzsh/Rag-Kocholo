        "text": "NORTH BY NORTHWEST\n\n1959\n\nAlfred Hitchcock’s classic thriller North By Northwest marks the first time The Plaza was prominently featured on the big screen. (By the year 2000, The Plaza had become New York’s most popular film site.) One of North By Northwest’s memorable scenes takes place in the Oak Bar, where Cary Grant gets kidnapped, but then quickly escapes through the fifty-ninth street entrance.\n\nTHE FRONT\n\n1976\n\nThe 1976 comedy about the Hollywood blacklist stars Woody Allen and Zero Mostel. The blacklist made many actors, writers and directors unemployable if they were accused of being in support of Communism. The Front takes place in the early 1950’s in New York City, and one of the scenes takes place in a suite at The Plaza .\n\nSLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE\n\n1993\n\nIn this classic romantic comedy, starring Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and Bill Pullman The Plaza is featured when Pullman (Walter) stays at the hotel after arriving in New York. In a famous scene, he reunites with his fiance Meg Ryan (Annie) in front of the Fifth Avenue entrance.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY\n\n2013\n\nThe film that was based on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s famous novel of the same name has it’s climactic scene set at The Plaza. The film was written and directed by Baz Luhrman and starred Leonardo Dicaprio as Jay Gatsby, and also included Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan.\n\nALFRED GWYNNE VANDERBILT IS THE FIRST GUEST\n\nOctober 1, 1907\n\nAfter two years of construction The Plaza opens to the public on October 1st, 1907. Just as the The Plaza first opened its doors at 9:00 AM, a carriage pulled up carrying the new hotel’s first guest- Alfred Gwyne Vanderbilt, the young millionaire sportsman and member of the famous Vanderbilt family.\n\nMRS. PATRICK CAMPBELL LIGHTS A CIGARETTE\n\nNovember 15, 1907\n\nThe British star known to her fans as “Mrs. Pat” sparked controversy while staying at The Plaza. After ordering dinner she lit up a perfumed Egyptian cigarette and proceeded to smoke it. This occurred in an age when such a thing was unheard-of, and soon the headwaiter appeared and insisted Mrs. Campbell put out the cigarette. She replied, “My good man, I understand this is a free country. I shall do nothing to change it.” The press got wind of the story and a debate started over the ills of smoking. Soon smoking was banned in New York City subways, a law which was said to have come about as a result of this incident.\n\nTHE DUKE OF WINDSOR CELEBRATES AN ANNIVERSARY\n\nDecember 11, 1946\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Windsor frequented The Plaza during their time in New York. In 1946, the Duke and Duchess attended the December Ball, a benefit for disabled veterans. It was a particularly special night because the day of the Ball coincided with the tenth anniversary of the duke’s abdication of the throne of England.\n\nPATRICIA KENNEDY WEDS PETER LAWFORD\n\nApril 24, 1954\n\nOver the years there have been the many famous weddings at The Plaza, but one of the most notable ones occurred when Patricia Kennedy, daughter of Joseph and Rose Kennedy, married British film star Peter Lawford. The lavish wedding reception at The Plaza’s Ballroom included Jack, Bobby, and Teddy Kennedy.\n\nMARILYN MONROE’S BROKEN SHOULDER STRAP\n\nFebruary 9th, 1956\n\nMarilyn Monroe arrived at the Terrace Room on February 9th, 1956 to promote her latest film, The Prince and the Showgirl. Marilyn was wearing a revealing black velvet dress with thin straps, and during the conference when the actress leaned forward one of the shoulder straps broke. The broken strap incident made the front pages across the country, however the event was hardly an incident. According to the designer of the dress, the strap breaking was arranged to break in advance!\n\nNORTH BY NORTHWEST\n\nAugust, 1958\n\nAlfred Hitchcock’s classic thriller North By Northwest marked the first time The Plaza was prominently featured on the big screen. (By the year 2000, The Plaza became New York’s most popular film site.) One of North By Northwest’s memorable scenes took place in the Oak Bar, where Cary Grant got kidnapped, but then quickly escaped through the Fifty-ninth Street entrance.\n\nJOHN AND JACKIE KENNEDY\n\nDecember 8th, 1959\n\nPoliticians have frequented the legendary hotel throughout the years, and every U.S. president since William Taft has made an appearance at The Plaza. On December 8th, 1959, Senator and Mrs. John F. Kennedy arrived in The Plaza’s Ballroom for the Wild West Ball benefitting a pet charity.\n\nTHE BEATLES ARRIVE\n\nFebruary 7th, 1964\n\nIn 1964, The Beatles conquered America. They spent five days living at The Plaza during which time they played two shows at Carnegie Hall and appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. On February 10th, 1964, The Beatles held a press conference in the Baroque Room where they were presented with gold records for their single “I Wanna Hold Your Hand” and their album “Meet The Beatles.”\n\nTHE BLACK AND WHITE BALL\n\nNovember 28th, 1966\n\nThe guest list of Truman Capote’s fabled party featured a who’s who of the era: Frank Sinatra, Norman Mailer, Rose Kennedy, and Andy Warhol, were some of the famous faces seen at what is considered by many to be the Party of the Century. All guests were required to wear masks, as Truman thought this would allow the guests to be more uninhibited. At midnight they removed the masks and the party continued!\n\nJULIE NIXON WEDS DAVID EISENHOWER\n\nDecember 22nd, 1968\n\nFirst Daughter-elect Julie Nixon’s wedding to David Dwight Eisenhower II was one of the most notable weddings at The Plaza. He was the grandson of U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, who unfortunately could not attend the event as he was being hospitalized at the time. Julie Nixon’s father Richard Nixon was able to attend his daughter’s big day, and so were other renowned politicians such as Spiro Agnew and Thomas Dewey.\n\nNOW STAGES A PROTEST\n\nFebruary 12th, 1969\n\nProtesting the Oak Room’s men-only policy at lunch, the National Organization for Women (more commonly known as NOW) staged a sit-in at The Plaza. The protest began at the Fifth Avenue entrance, and proceeded into the Oak Room where they sat down during lunch and waited to be served. After waiting for four hours and not being served, the group departed. The protest garnered significant press, and the incident proved to not be in vain, as four months later the Oak Room’s lunchtime men’s only policy was rescinded."
