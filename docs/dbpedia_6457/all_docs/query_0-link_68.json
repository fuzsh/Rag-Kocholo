Scott, \"Joel McCrea: A Ranch For the Star of Sullivan's Travels,\" in Architectural Digest (Los Angeles), April 1994.\n\n* * *\n\nOf the great American male film stars, Joel McCrea is arguably the most underrated. In a career that lasted over 30 years, his characters ranged from tuxedoed escorts for the likes of Kay Francis and Constance Bennett in Girls about Town and Bed of Roses to adventurers in The Most Dangerous Game and Bird of Paradise, from Western \"heroes\" in Colorado Territory and Ramrod to comic leading men in The Palm Beach Story and The More the Merrier. But in spite of his extraordinary filmography, it is unlikely that McCrea will ever become a screen icon of the order of a John Wayne or a Gary Cooper, since, among film heroes, he is one of the least prone to self-mythologizing—with the possible exception of his role in Peckinpah's Ride the High Country; and perhaps not coincidentally, he virtually retired after its completion. His search for adventure is seldom more than that and largely free of any sort of neurotic drives. It is this fundamental sanity of McCrea's that probably appealed to Gregory La Cava and Preston Sturges, and which forms the emotional center in the extraordinary series of films that McCrea collaborated on with these two directors. The dramatic tone of the La Cava and Sturges films could range from melodrama (Private Worlds) to comedy (The Palm Beach Story), or an audacious mixture of the two (Primrose Path, Sullivan's Travels), but in most of them McCrea remains an essentially passive male figure surrounded by chaos and insanity. The narratives tend to be controlled by either the female or the subsidiary male characters, and even when they are not, McCrea's attempts at control (as in Sullivan's Travels) generaly result in total disorder.\n\nWhile McCrea projects an obvious heterosexuality, it is so relaxed that, in fleeting moments, a film will eroticize him. He becomes the object of an aging widow's affections in Sullivan's Travels and she hopefully peers down at him from a second-story window as he chops wood for her, shirtless and sweating. His highly photogenic torso is also featured prominently in The More the Merrier as he takes a shower while beating his arms against his chest and barking like a seal, a primeval mating call that is answered in the film by a sexually unfulfilled Jean Arthur. And Bird of Paradise is one of the most erotic of the pre-Production Code films, in which McCrea and Dolores Del Rio set up an idyllic romance, largely unhampered by dress codes.\n\nMcCrea appeared in a few films after Ride the High Country but they are less than memorable and he seems to have done them more as a lark than anything else. Ultimately, these late films emerge as nothing more than postscripts in his career rather than presenting any sort of revisionist portraits of him. For those who traffic in puncturing the \"myths\" of popular culture, Joel McCrea was given precious little with which to work.\n\n—Joe McElhaney"
