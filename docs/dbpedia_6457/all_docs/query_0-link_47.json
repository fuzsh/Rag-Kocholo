        "text": "WARNING: Long post – get a cuppa and get comfy!\n\nIt’s getting to that time of year again. The carols are beginning to echo through the halls of cathedrals. The seemingly everlasting hits have been playing in coffee shops since mid-November. The chills are approaching, and so out come the jumpers. The world prepares for the commercial festivities of the season. The all important season. The season to be merry, and jolly, and full of cheer…\n\nYes, having recently been involved in some fantastic roast dinner meals, and partaken in a three-day nativity narrative play at my local church (a great success I might add), I’ve gotten into the spirit of Christmas. It’s a weird thing, but I’ve had to start celebrating in early December, at the end of the university term with all my university friends, and then stop for a week and a half, and start again. Otherwise, I never maintain the festive cheer all the way through the month!\n\nOf course, with celebrating Christmas, I spend a fair bit of time thinking about the person who’s name sits right in the middle of it. And after a carol service or two, with excellent evangelistic messages to accompany, thoughts about the birth of Jesus are resolutely stuck in my head. So I’ve spent a fair bit of time thinking about visual adaptations of Christ’s birth a lot. And therefore, that means I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the soundtracks of these films and TV programs, because I’m me and that’s what I’ll do! And there’s always one that pops back into my mind, one soundtrack that I keep coming back to. You probably looked at the title and thought “wait, ‘Christmas Special’?”, and I know it’s a bit of a tenuous link, because the film for which the music was written is not even a “Christmas” film like It’s a Wonderful Life, Home Alone or Die Hard (yes, I went there). However, it does feature as part of its narrative the birth of Christ, albeit alongside Christ’s sermon on the mount, crucifixion, and resurrection. And anyway, its music is just so astounding that I can’t stop myself from talking about it any longer. Remember the ‘Greatest Score of All Time’ series I did over the summer? Well, I think if there was one score I would add by way of personal insistence, it would be this one…\n\nThe 1959 film adaptation by William Wyler of General Lew Wallace’s 550 page novel Ben-Hur is the gold standard for the Hollywood epic film, and biblical epic as a sub-genre. The film was epic in every sense of the word, from its epic run-time of 3 hours and 32 minutes to its epic budget of $15 million to its epic sets (the largest and most expensive at the time) to its epic cast featuring over 5,000 extras. It featured Charlton Heston (the epitome of the Hollywood epic lead) as protagonist Judah Ben-Hur, and a narrative that spanned decades. That epicness extended to its score by Hungarian composer Miklós Rózsa, who composed over 3 hours of music (2 and a half of which would be used). These words summarise my sentiment towards the score better than I could:\n\n“This score is in my judgement the most thematically complex and melodically rich film score ever penned by the hand of man. The thematic interplay and sophisticated contrapuntal writing is extraordinary and sets Rózsa apart. In this grand effort the full spectrum of human emotions are captured, perfectly emoted, and expertly attenuated to the film’s imagery and narrative. This is a score you feel deeply, one that moves you, and ultimately, transforms you. I consider this score to be Miklós Rózsa’s Magnum Opus, one that I believe ensures his immortality.”\n\n– Craig Lysy, ‘BEN-HUR – Miklós Rózsa’, Movie Music UK, Sept. 17, 2017, https://moviemusicuk.us/2017/09/18/ben-hur-miklos-rozsa-2/#more-8015.\n\nHow does one explain and analyse a score with such a description as that in the space of one (not so) little blog post?? With extreme difficulty, is the answer. Which is why this review will not focus on the entirety of Rózsa’s score, and instead hone in on the musical selections recorded by the United Kingdom’s National Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus, conducted by the maestro himself, for Decca records in 1977. The selections on this CD, combining original compositions for the film and suites specifically arranged, feature a range of motifs composed by Rózsa for the film, the most popular motifs from the soundtrack, nicely condensing 3 hours into 47 minutes. Though the tracks are not chronologically arranged to fit the narrative of the film, the sound recording is of superb quality, especially since iTunes transferred the LP recording to digital file in 2010, making this album fully accessible to all listeners at an affordable price. For full enjoyment, I have formatted the blog so that you can play the track from a YouTube video and then read the description as it plays. So, without further ado, let us explore Rózsa’s Magnum Opus and, maybe, you will be transformed too.\n\nWe begin the CD with a powerful opening, the ‘Prelude to Fanfare’, which presents the primary motifs of the film in order of importance to the narrative. Roman trumpet fanfare triplets open the track, before a cymbal crash introduces the “Christ” theme, which serves as Jesus’ identity and appears throughout the film. Creating music for Jesus was for Rózsa the greatest challenge of scoring the film, yet he succeeded with this five note, major modal, triadic, warm and hopeful theme. The use of a pipe organ and brass in this initial statement is triumphant, glorious, and inspiring. From this appears a proud and rousing statement of the theme for Judah Ben-Hur, a masculine, confident and bold composition of three phrases – a strong A phrase, a noble and heroic B phrase, and a C phrase with an uncertain conclusion, all performed here on horns for a sense of vitality. After an impassioned ascent on violins with horn accompaniment, we are introduced to the primary “Love” theme, for the character of Esther. Evoking a sense of gentleness, the theme employs a classic ABA form, with its warm A phrase and its passionate B phrase emoted by sumptuous strings. A short statement of the A phrase from Judah’s theme precedes the conclusive and majestic rendition of the “Anno Domini” theme on brass with gong crashes, heralding a great tale but also alluding to the beginning of a new age, the Christian age. What an opening, defining the epic scale of the movie in a most magnificent manner!\n\nNow we have the tenuous link to this post appearing at Christmas time – the ‘Star of Bethlehem / Adoration of the Magi’ compositions, here following the ‘Fanfare to Prelude’ though chronologically they are heard in the film beforehand. This track features the beautiful theme for Balthazar and the wise men. A warm major modal A phrase on resplendent strings with angelic choir and a contrapuntal bass line is contrasted by an emotional B phrase carried on solo oboe and then strings and choir. This motif speaks of the nobility, humility, and kindness of the wise men, and its performance on this track is profoundly moving, culminating with grandeur as the titular star concludes its journey above a simple stable. From this, music kindred to Balthazar’s theme emerges as the Magi enter the stable and present their gifts. The simple melody, carried by soft choir and solo flute and accented by tremolo strings and glockenspiel, speaks to the forthright adoration of the magi. I especially like the two note musical portrayal of the cattle lowing in the stable at the conclusion of each statement of the melodic line, a nice touch by Rózsa. We conclude with a reprisal of Balthazar’s theme with a sense of wonder. This track is a favourite of mine because of its associations with Christ’s birth, and its frank and unashamed portrayal of the wondrous and celebratory nature of that event.\n\nThe third track on the album is titled ‘Friendship’, and presents, fittingly, the “Friendship” theme, which speaks to the boyhood bond between Judah Ben-Hur and the primary antagonist Messala. The theme is masculine in its articulation, carried by warm strings with contrapuntal horns, and Roman in its sensibilities. Though the theme is major modal, the shifting harmonies present a tinge of sadness and foreboding, speaking to the events of the film that will destroy this boyhood friendship. A brief statement of Messala’s dark, angry, biphrasic theme opens the cue, before smoothly segueing into the “Friendship” theme for a full ABA rendition on warm strings, with horns, and a solo oboe passage. Flourishes appear later on to match the spears throwing contest between the men (how manly) that shows their equal skill and strength. The cue ends with a gradually slowing tempo, heavy and with a twinge of sadness.\n\nThe next track on the album (chronologically out of order) is ‘The Burning Desert’, where Rózsa unleashes the full dissonant potential of the orchestra. A torturous seven note motif of suffering on horns, accompanied by free form falling woodwind lines and searing strings, and set to a steady, relentless drum beat, subtly changes key, tempo, and time signature continuously, to evoke a sense of ongoing, unstoppable agony. From this turbulence emerges Judah’s theme at 2:38 on brass and low strings, with an accompanying searing high string ostinato, before fading away into undulating strings, brass, and woodwind, seemingly from exhaustion. After a final dynamic hit at 3:11, the strings fade away, as on screen Judah collapses to the ground, denied water, pitifully crying out, “God, help me…”. And as it is said in Matthew 7:7, “Ask and it will be given to you.” At 3:19 we hear the first performance of the ethereal yet soothing and gentle arrangement of the Christ theme for pipe organ, celesta, vibraphone, plucked strings, and violins playing in harmonics. This plays as Jesus appears on screen, washing Judah’s face and quenching his thirst. At 4:01 we hear a far more upbeat and spirited rendition of Judah’s theme for strings counterpointed by the Christ theme on flute and celesta, to aurally confirm that Jesus has revitalised not just Judah’s body, but his spirit too. A string and brass segment swells up to a truly triumphant rendition of the full Christ theme on heroic brass and strings, concluding with a glorious flourish.\n\nContinuing with a lack of chronological sequencing, the next cue is, if I’m allowed to say this, a bit of an unusual one to include on such a compressed rendering of the Ben-Hur score. Nonetheless, ‘Arius’ Party’ does give us a a different musical texture to sample, and a light, brief rest from the heavy drama and pathos of the rest of the score. The music underscores a scene where Arius, general of the Roman Empire, announces the formal adoption of Judah into his house, in gratitude for helping save his life in a sea battle (more on that later). The writing is for a small ensemble, and gentile and intricate in its construction of two phrases. The A phrase melody is performed on flute and oboe with harps, clarinet, bassoon, light percussion rhythms, and sleigh bells as accompaniment. Meanwhile, the B phrase passes the melody between oboe and flute with English horn underneath. The cue is inoffensive, and provides an excellent example of Rózsa’s understanding of woodwinds, but remains by far the least excellent track on the album.\n\nThe next track (though chronologically speaking, precedent to the previous track), ‘Rowing of the Galley Slaves’, brings us right back to the action and excitement, as we aurally witness a Roman warship speeding up to ram an enemy vessel. A four note timpani ostinato begins the track, mimicking the beats of the drums on the Roman warships, setting the tempo. However, when the strings are introduced, playing a melodic ostinato on top of the timpani, the tempo gradually increases. As this happens, more strings are introduced, playing counter-melodies. At 0:35 the trumpets enter, adding a main A-phrase melodic line, beginning a call-and-response segment with the horns. However, this is quickly abandoned at 0:52 for a B-phrase brass and string melodic sequence, bringing snare drum rhythms into the mix. All the while, the tempo increases. At 1:09 we return to the A-phrase on trumpets, with the response taken up by strings instead of horns, which reaches higher and higher, building with greater dynamics and adding more layers of instrumentation, and continually increasing in tempo. The B-phrase then comes back in for a short while, before the A-phrase returns again, speeding up in the manner of an unstoppable vehicle, heading towards a crashing finish of a sudden silence, a sharp snare roll, and a final orchestral hit. This cue demonstrates Rózsa’s masterful ability to orchestrate tension and anticipation with flair.\n\nThe next cue, ‘Parade of the Charioteers’, has passed into legend as the definitive concert hall piece from the entire score. The music accompanies the procession of the charioteers before their big race, in a pivotal scene of the film; not only does Judah have the opportunity to exact vengeance on Massala for the pain of his slavery, representing the culmination of their narrative arc, the scene features the most impressive sets, costuming, and action of the entire motion picture. The actual race, which director Wyler wisely chose to leave unscored, is a pulse-pounding thrill ride of tension and anticipation. Thus, Rózsa’s music had to set the stage for the conflict while also be of the highest level to equal such production excellence, and he delivered in spades. Beginning with overlapping trumpet fanfares, we enter a glorious march rendered in AB form, fully supporting the pageantry of the event with cymbals, snare drums, and triumphal brass and strings. In a stroke of brilliance, a major modal version of Messala’s theme forms the melody of the A phrase, epitomising both the splendour of the Roman army and Messala’s certainty of victory, while Judah’s theme forms the melody of the B phrase, representing his determination to have revenge. Both phrases are briefly reprised at the end, before the cue concludes with a series of fanfares for trumpet and snare drum, and a final flourish.\n\nThe next cue (again, chronologically it would have been before ‘Parade of the Charioteers’), ‘The Mother’s Love’, presents one of the more emotionally beautiful compositions of the album, and parades Rózsa’s talent for emotional heights. Opening on soft tremolo high strings, we hear a lush full string rendition of the theme for Miriam, mother of Judah. Minor key in tone, yet full of warmth, this theme epitomises both Miriam’s tenderness and her Jewish heritage through a melodic link to the Judea theme (discussed later). That love and tenderness is especially apparent here, as the music underscores a scene in which Miriam and Tirzah, Judah’s sister, meet Esther after being released from jail. They have leprosy, and are about to leave for the valley of the lepers, but before they go they secure a promise from Esther that Judah must believe they are dead; Miriam’s love for Judah and wish to try and spare him further pain overcomes her desire to see him again. At 1:03 Esther’s theme (the “Love” theme) enters on lush strings to denote her presence but also emphasise Miriam’s love for Judah. An impassioned second rendition of Miriam’s theme on strings and brass leads to a diminuendo and minor key finish.\n\nFollowing this (though chronologically it takes place before ‘The Mother’s Love’), is ‘Return to Judea’, a minor track that serves to root us in the sentiments of ancient Judea, providing full renderings of the themes associated with Judea in ABA format. Rózsa’s Jewish themes are minor modal with a tinge of sadness, to contrast the major modal Christian themes; a musical affirmation of the major narrative themes of the film. Opening with a low string ostinato and woodwinds, we hear a lush string presentation of the “Judea” theme, serving as this track’s A phrase, featuring the turn of notes also present in Miriam’s theme. The B phrase is comprised of the theme for the House of Hur, the family and ancestral name of Judah, and it features classic orientalist string and oboe writing with triangle accents to ground the listener in Middle Eastern culture and aurally associate the theme to ancient Judea. A second rendition of the Judea theme leads to a relatively quiet finish.\n\nThe next album cue, titled ‘Ring for Freedom’, actually underscores a scene that chronologically appears before Judah’s arrest and enslavement, where Judah buys Esther’s freedom as an act of love; for our purposes, it provides a sumptuous rendition of the “love” theme for full orchestra. Beginning with a violin solo, we transition into the first rendering of the melody of the theme on violin, progressing through a gorgeous chord sequence, before the cello takes up the melodic line and we begin the actual “love” theme. Here Rózsa has a chance to explore his full romantic writing potential, writing almost exclusively for a full complement of strings and a harp, and using the classic Hollywood romantic formula of the tonic to half-diminished supertonic progression (which John Williams would use almost exclusively for his iconic love themes for Star Wars, Indiana Jones and others). At 1:11 we enter a bridge section of searching strings and harp lines, which leads to an even more impassioned statement of the “love” theme. This is the classic Hollywood sound of romance, and a testament to Rózsa’s ingenuity and longevity as a film composer.\n\nThe following cue, ‘Lepers’ Search for Christ’, is the antithesis to ‘Ring for Freedom’ in its emotional drive. The track presents us with Rózsa’s “leper” motif, truly grotesque in its horrific and dissonant articulation. A harsh declaration followed by a four-note descending line by grim low register strings and horns sow terror and cause us to recoil, especially when presented at the opening of this cue with dissonant horn effects and tremolo string accompaniment. The cue progresses, increasing anxious tension in the listener, before a secondary motif for low strings and horns emerges at 1:11, speaking to the pain of leprosy, while Judah’s theme joins at 1:42 in a minor key for impassioned strings to inform us of his pain at seeing his mother and sister the way they are. As strings begin an ascent with increasing drama to a cymbal crescendo at 2:17, we hear again the Anno Domini motif at 2:40, informing us of Jesus’ appearance at the beginning of his final journey…\n\nWe come to the emotional nadir of the narrative in ‘Procession to Calvary’. As Jesus, condemned by Pilate to crucifixion, begins his trek to Calvary, Rózsa introduces the first of his two “Passion” themes, a slow and heavy minor modal eleven-note theme that elicits unbearable sorrow and despair. The solemn cue opens as a grim funeral march with strings playing in their lowest register and a solitary drum beat of doom offset with an echo provided by tuba and trombones. As the opening eleven note theme progresses, the strings begin a gradual increase in tempo and sustained ascent in their register, yet instead of achieving a climax, the theme loses hope, slows, and we hear the strings descend in their register to begin another cycle of torment. This cyclic rise and fall creates a sense of despair, foretelling a tragic ending that cannot be stalled. As Jesus begins to stumble and fall at 2:17 the second “Passion” theme comes in, this one emphasising even more the failing and weakening body of Christ in its downward spiralling melody until finally, at 3:10, Jesus collapses under the weight of the cross, accented by stinging muted brass. The “Judea” theme comes in on forceful strings, reminding the listener of the Jewish condemnation of Christ. As Judah, who has been following the procession and breaks through the guards to give water to Christ, recognises him as the same man who gave him water all those years ago, the “Christ” theme gently plays with the same instrumentation as in ‘The Burning Desert’. But the cup is kicked away by a Roman soldier, and the first passion theme plays once more, before closing on a heavy and somber note.\n\nBut that is not the end of the story! Our final track, ‘Miracle and Finale’, presents the joyous conclusion of the film. Opening with a discordant first 20 seconds, which support Miriam and Tirzah’s lesions being cleansed by the power of Jesus’ love in the blessed rain spilled by Heaven following the crucifixion, Rózsa then provides us with a joyous and refulgent rendering of the choral supported “Christ” theme, which resounds as horns and bells join in a glorious celebratory statement. As we follow the travel of Christ’s blood as it joins flowing streams, the theme’s expression becomes transcendent, and glorious in its evocative power. At 2:07 a plaintive rendering of Judah’s theme carries him across his home’s courtyard. Soon follows a muted and restrained return of a now transformed “Anno Domini” theme, as he touches the mezuzah. When Esther greets him, the “love” theme appears on oboe, and then Miriam’s for a brief statement, before strings swell us even further upwards to a new and resplendent celebratory melody. At 4:18 the “love” theme bursts through on magnificent strings, brass, and choir, before we conclude with a grand and crowning statement of the “Christ” theme with choral “Alleluias” that resounds gloriously. The cue closes with a choral, brass, string, and timpani flourish, which heralds a new age.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, ultimately this review of Miklós Rózsa’s masterpiece has gone on far longer than I was expecting. But I do not apologise; for me, this score is the reason why I listen to film music. It explores the full range of human emotion. The technical brilliance of this score, admittedly still adhering to the cliches of Hollywood, is nonetheless astounding. It cements and completes the film, and without this music Ben-Hur would be half as epic. If you had listened to one track and had enough, clicked away before finishing, then fair enough. But if you have come with me right to this point, and are reading this now, having experienced 47 minutes of pure cinematic excellence, then I sincerely hope you have found something to enjoy. Maybe this has sparked an interest in historic film scores that will grow into appreciation, even love. If so, then my work is done. If not, it doesn’t matter; you will never stop me from adoring this music. As I conclude, I wish you all God’s blessing, a very Merry Christmas and a happy new year."
