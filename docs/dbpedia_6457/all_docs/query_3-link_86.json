        "text": "Regarded as one of the best British documentaries of the Second World War, Western Approaches pays tribute to the bravery of the Merchant Navy and the perils they faced during the Atlantic Convoys.\n\nDirected by Pat Jackson and brilliantly shot in Technicolor by acclaimed cinematographer Jack Cardiff (The Red Shoes, The African Queen), this dramatized Crown Film Unit retelling of an attempted U-Boat attack uses real merchant seamen to re-enact their roles. Both realistic and dramatic, the film carries a powerful authenticity, which is reinforced by its stunning colour imagery.\n\nA crowning achievement of the British Documentary Movement that flourished in the 1930s and 40s, this landmark film is presented in a new 2K restoration by Imperial War Museums."
