        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nEe it was never homogeneous; indeed, it is precisely the variety, and the internal tensions, that give the work its energy and its continuing interest. Already an experienced producer, Balcon set himself at Ealing to select and build, at a time when war was imminent, a team dedicated to making films that were ‘absolutely rooted in the soil of this country’. Many of his long-term producers and directors, such as Sidney Cole, Charles Frend, Charles Crichton and Robert Hamer, were recruited as editors and then promoted; Harry Watt and Alberto Cavalcanti were directors already, brought in from the government’s Crown Film Unit so that their expertise in documentary could enhance the realism of the studio’s war films. This policy paid off in films like Cavalcanti’s Went the Day Well? (1942), Watt’s Nine Men, and Frend and Hamer’s San Demetrio– London (1943). Ealing had, by then, made a number of comedies with George Formby, Tommy Trinder, and Will Hay, but it now concentrated increasingly on dramas, ranging from the Australian cattle-drive epic The Overlanders (1946) to Scott of the Antarctic (1948). Only with the release in 1949 of Whisky Galore!, Passport to Pimlico and Kind Hearts and Coronets did the concept of ‘Ealing Comedy’ become established, though there had been isolated predecessors such as Hue and Cry (1946). Comedies continued to constitute only a small proportion of the ouput; some of them flopped, but the best, such as The Ladykillers (1955), have proved more memorable than the dramas, with occasional exceptions like the police drama The Blue Lamp (1949) and the return to WW2 in The Cruel Sea (1952). Comedy was a fertile postwar genre for Ealing because it enabled topical issues, with which Balcon’s team had been conditioned to deal, to be dramatised not solemnly but in the liberating form of fantasy. In late 40s Britain, the austerity of wartime dragged on; the protagonists of the comedies are therapeutically released into the fulfilment of their desires. But the films are more complex than this simple wish-fulfilment model suggests. First, the nature of the release is limited; Passport to Pimlico ends up seeming positively nostalgic for the wartime world of controls and rationing. Second, there is a clear gulf between the two main sub-sets of Ealing comedy. Those scripted by Ealing’s most influential writer, T.E.B. Clarke, such as Passport to Pimlico, The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953), are indulgent to their characters, courting such descriptions as cosy and whimsical; those directed by Ealing’s main postwar recruit, Alexander Mackendrick, none of them written by Clarke, demonstrate a more ruthless analytical intelligence, and suggest that good intentions and goodwill are in themselves of limited value. Eady, David (b London, 1924). Director. Son of Sir Wilfrid Eady, Eady made several documentaries before being put under contract to London Films where he was an assistant cutter on The Third Man (1949) and edited Cry the Beloved Country (1952), before directing an episode of Three Cases of Murder (1955). Directed several unusual ‘B’ movies in the 50s: The Heart Within (1957), a racial-problem thriller; the engaging, wittily written The Man Who Liked Funerals (1958); and the oddly attractive Zoo Baby (1960, made 1957) about a small boy who steals a coatimundi from the zoo. Later career included further documentaries and children’s films. other british films include: (d, unless noted) Bridge of Time (1950, short, + sc), Edinburgh, The Road to Canterbury (1952, shorts, + sc), Malaga (1954, 2ud), In the Wake of a Stranger, The Crowning Touch (1959), Faces in the Dark (1960), The Verdict (1964), Operation Third Form (1966, + co-sc), Anoop and the Elephant, Hide and Seek (1972), The Laughing Girl Murder (1973), Where’s Johnny (1974, + co-p), The Hostages (1975), Night Ferry, Echo of the Badlands (co-d) (1976), Deep Waters, Play Safe (BAAn) (1978), Danger on Dartmoor (1980), The Perils of Easy (1986, short). Eady levy Named for Sir Wilfrid Eady, the Treasury official who devised the scheme. Introduced in 1950 as a temporary, voluntary measure to aid film production, then enshrined as a regular form of support for the film industry in the Cinematograph Films Act of 1957. It provided for a redistribution of revenue, achieved by an additional tax on boxoffice receipts. Part of its fruits was paid back to producers in proportion to the earnings of their films and part to the National Film Finance Corporation, the BFI and the..."
