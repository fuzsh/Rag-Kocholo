        "text": "NAACP Image Award-winning “Emancipation” star Will Smith and director Antoine Fuqua honored with the Beacon Award Academy Award-nominated “Causeway” star Brian Tyree Henry wins Best Supporting ActorCritics’ Choice and NAACP Image Award-winning “Sidney” wins Best Documentary Film\n\nThe African American Film Critics Association (AAFCA) celebrates Apple Original Films' “Emancipation” by awarding Will Smith and Antoine Fuqua with the Beacon Award in honor of their film about the triumphant true story of an enslaved man’s grueling journey through the swamps of Louisiana, as he relies on his wits, faith and dedication to his loved ones, to evade his captors and reunite with his family in freedom. Additionally, Academy Award-nominated Brian Tyree Henry, star of Apple's feature film “Causeway” earned Best Supporting Actor, while Apple’s documentary “Sidney” landed Best Documentary Film. The awards presented at the 14th Annual African American Film Critics Association Awards honor AAFCA’s mission to cultivate understanding, appreciation and advancement of the contributions of African-descended talent to cinematic and television culture — from the artistic and technical legends of the past to the still unimagined breakthroughs of future generations.\n\n“Emancipation” has received wide acclaim, as “a strong, fierce, heartfelt movie” (The Guardian), with a “piercing honesty and careful craftsmanship” that are “a crowning achievement of Fuqua’s long career” (Clayton Davis, Variety). “Emancipation” has been recently honored with an NAACP Image Award win for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture for star and producer Will Smith, in addition to receiving four NAACP Image Award nominations for Outstanding Motion Picture, Outstanding Ensemble Cast in a Motion Picture, Outstanding Directing in a Motion Picture and Outstanding Costume Design.\n\nBrian Tyree Henry’s Academy Award-nominated work in “Causeway” has been praised as a “genuinely fantastic” (The Playlist), and “absolutely phenomenal” (New York Magazine/Vulture) performance by “one of the finest actors around” (Deadline). Henry’s outstanding performance was also recently honored with Critics Choice Association's Celebration of Black Cinema & Television and Black Reel Awards wins, alongside nominations from the Critics’ Choice Awards, Gotham Awards, Film Independent Spirit Awards, the London Critics’ Circle and many more.\n\n“Sidney” has been hailed as a “warm and engaging insight to an extraordinary man” (The Daily Telegraph) and a “moving documentary” about a “remarkable and much-missed man” (Daily Mail). “Sidney” won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing in a Documentary for director Reginald Hudlin as well as Best Biographical Documentary from the Critics’ Choice Awards, and Best Documentary from the Black Reel Awards.\n\nThese honors mark Apple’s most recent recognition from the African American Film Critics Association following the inclusion of “Causeway,” “Emancipation” and “Sidney” in AAFCA's list of the 10 best films of 2022, and wins for “Swagger” and “Pachinko” at the AAFCA TV Honors. In 2021, “The Tragedy of Macbeth” was recognized in AAFCA’s annual list of the top 10 films of the year alongside a Best Supporting Actor win for Corey Hawkins’ performance in the film.\n\nApple Original Films were honored with AAFCA Awards including:\n\n\"Causeway”\n\nBest Supporting Actor — Brian Tyree Henry\n\n“Emancipation”\n\nThe Beacon Award — Will Smith and Antoine Fuqua\n\n“Sidney”\n\nBest Documentary Film\n\n“Causeway”\n\nIn “Causeway,” the new drama directed by Lila Neugebauer, Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence plays Lynsey, a military engineer who has returned to the States from Afghanistan with a debilitating brain injury after an IED explosion. It's a painful and slow recovery as she relearns to walk and retrains her memory, but when she returns home to New Orleans she has to face memories even more aching and formative than those she had in service — a reckoning with her childhood. When Lynsey’s truck breaks down, she meets mechanic James Aucoin (Brian Tyree Henry), and slowly they start to rely on each other for company and solace. These two damaged souls' budding friendship forms the center and the heart of Neugebauer's debut feature — a quiet but devastating, and ultimately uplifting, story about coming to terms and moving forward.\n\n“Emancipation”\n\nAntoine Fuqua’s “Emancipation” tells the triumphant story of Peter (Will Smith), a man who escapes from slavery, relying on his wits, unwavering faith and deep love for his family to evade cold-blooded hunters and the unforgiving swamps of Louisiana on his quest for freedom. The film is inspired by the 1863 photos of “Whipped Peter,” taken during a Union Army medical examination, that first appeared in Harper’s Weekly. One image, known as “The Scourged Back,” which shows Peter’s bare back mutilated by a whipping delivered by his enslavers, ultimately contributed to growing public opposition to slavery.\n\n“Sidney”\n\nFrom producers Oprah Winfrey and Derik Murray and directed by Reginald Hudlin, this revealing documentary honors the legendary Sidney Poitier and his legacy as an iconic actor, filmmaker and activist at the center of Hollywood and the civil rights movement. Featuring candid interviews with Denzel Washington, Halle Berry, Robert Redford, Lenny Kravitz, Barbra Streisand, Spike Lee and many more, in close collaboration with the Poitier family.\n\nAll films are currently streaming on Apple TV+.\n\nApple TV+ offers premium, compelling drama and comedy series, feature films, groundbreaking documentaries, and kids and family entertainment, and is available to watch across all your favorite screens.
