        "text": "This study endeavors to explore Lennon’s songs as an expression of rage and rebellion of the common Americans against the bitter realities of the contemporary American war politics of the 1960s and 70s and of the prevailing socio-economic and cultural injustices. It illumines a reality that alternative cultures like drugs, alcohol, homosexuality, nomadism and mystic vision, perceived reprehensible by the contemporary mainstream culture, were in fact manufactured out of harsh American socio-political context. By projecting the painful experiences of the victims during the time of war, the research engages with the extraction of themes like terror of the nuclear arms race and poverty, racism, prison and war, buried in Lennon’s compositions and thereby revealing Lennon’s association with such subcultures to counter and to subvert the mundane, the rationality and material hunger of the mainstream culture in the then America.\n\nYoko Ono on June 6, 2009 was awarded Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the 53rd Venice Biennale. Yoko Ono's legacy is both as a musician and an artist who was part of the Fluxus movement and since the Sixties, a 'peace activist' with her husband, ex-Beatle John Lennon. Dedicated to Lennon's memory, Ono's Imagine Peace Tower (2008) sends a column of light heavenward and is powered by geothermal energy on Vioey Island, Reykjavik, Iceland. Overtime, Ono translated ideas into objects or souvenirs of experience, things \"that collect dust\". Ephemeral materials -glass, light, text,etc - transformed cored 'idea-objects' Ono recycled and altered to reflect each new era's social realities. Works discussed: Imagine Peace Tower (2008) ; YES Yoko Ono retrospective works;Ceilingpainting (1966); Glass Keys (1967); Penal Colony (2004) in The Snow Show; Pointedness (1964/66)\n\nRemixing and mash-ups have become part of the regular new media arsenal for creating public political statements. They do not, however, get much scholarly attention of social media as avenues for political protest, or as vehicles for facilitating protest community expression, as have Twitter or Facebook as community building and expression tools in the Arab Spring uprisings or the #Occupy movements. This essay will explore the intersection of political protest and mash-up videos at the locus created by John Lennon’s “Imagine.” I locate Lennon’s song in his anti-war activities of the late 1960s and early 1970s. I further explore its application in the first decade of the 21st century through new media technologies using the legend of Lennon the activist. Because of this history, Imagine, and the remixes that build from it, are vehicles through which to explore the role remixing and mash-ups play in political movements in a social media world. I argue that this lack of attention comes partly from the requirement for technological sophistication on the part of remixers. Despite this lack of recognition, mash-ups and remixing can be quite successful at articulating specific issues and/or addressing particular constituencies as they are used by professionals who channel the views of the protest community. I explore such possibilities using the case study of CalTV and WaxAudio’s collaborative mashup “Imagine This,” and discuss ways that this use of “Imagine” has evolved in the years since “Imagine This” was publicly released in 2006."
