        "text": "Her granddaughter, Anne-Marie Royle, said: \"As a grandmother she'd give us her last penny.\"\n\nShe said Frances started drawing as a child and used her talent to raise thousands of pounds for charity.\n\nOne of her pieces raised Â£13,000 for Francis House Children's Hospice and this was a cause that was particularly close to her heart.\n\nShe said: \"She loved art and people inspired her more than anything and people's characters and the way that they moved. She was inspired by the silent movies and Felix the Cat. She loved cartoons.\"\n\nAnne-Marie said it was her granddad, Bill, who served as a fireman during the Blitz, who encouraged Frances to draw the characters they both encountered in their younger days.\n\nThese were captured in the artist's first book, A Trafford Childhood, which later became A Manchester Childhood. Frances was also the official artist for the 2002 Commonwealth Games and she captured her experiences in The Golden Games.\n\nAnne-Marie said Frances was raising the need to look after the environment long before it was fashionable in her fairytale themed collection Magic Is Evergreen.\n\nFrances had a strong Catholic faith and managed to get an audience with the Pope. She received the MBE for his services to art and to charity and Anne-Marie recalls her being deep in conversation with Prince Charles, who said he was an admirer of her work.\n\n\"She said to him, are you doing any? He said 'at the moment I'm not.' She said you'll have to get going on it.\"\n\nAnne-Marie said first and foremost, Frances was a mum and a grandma - \"a family person.\"\n\nShe added: \"She believed in her faith - she had a strong Catholic faith and she was a Christian at heart. She was very generous and I think she'd like to be remembered for her humanity. She always taught me things will come to pass and you must forgive. That's the best way forward.\"\n\nFrances died on January 24, at the age of 102, at St Joseph's Little Sisters of the Poor in Manchester.\n\nThe funeral takes place on Saturday (February 7) at Little Sisters of the Poor and later at Southern Cemetery."
