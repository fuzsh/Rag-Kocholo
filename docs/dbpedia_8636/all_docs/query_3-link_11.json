        "text": "When 11-year-old Julian visited John Lennon in the recording studio during the \"Walls and Bridges\" sessions, the two played an impromptu version of \"Ya Ya\", with John on piano and Julian on drums. John surprised Julian afterwards by revealing there'd been tape rolling--and their performance was going on the album. It turned out to be their only collaboration.\n\nAlong with receiving a birthday card every year from Paul McCartney, Julian also received a telegram from him when his first album was released in 1984: \"Good luck, old fruit.\"\n\nWhen Julian decided to pursue a music career, he submitted demo tapes to record companies without his name on them, wanting to be signed on the strength of his own talents, rather than the Lennon name. Charisma Records in the UK offered his band a recording contract, not knowing until the signing who the lead singer was.\n\nDad could talk about peace and love out loud to the world, but he could never show it to the people who supposedly meant the most to him: his wife and son. How can you talk about peace and love and have a family in bits and pieces - no communication, adultery, divorce? You can't do it, not if you're being true and honest with yourself.\n\nI love to sit on a mountain top and gaze. I don't think of anything but the people I care about and the view."
