        "text": "Career\n\nMany comparisons have been made between Lennon\"s work and that of fellow Stretfordian L. South. Lowry. Her paintings have been described as \"Lowry-esque, but with more humour\". She also began drawing cartoons for Punch Magazine.\n\nIn 1928 Mooney began work as a draughtsman\"s assistant at the Metropolitan-Vickers factory in Trafford Park.\n\nThey moved back to Stretford in 1943, after her husband\"s injuries during the Manchester Blitz forced her to return to work to support the family. She took a job with the Ministry of Defence as a draughtsman, drawing plans for new war planes.\n\nFThey remained in Stretford until the late 1970s, when they retired to Flixton, Greater Manchester. She released several books, including best-selling collections entitled A Trafford Childhood (1986) and A Manchester Childhood (2001).\n\nIn 2002 she was commissioned as the official artist for the Commonwealth Games and produced a special book of paintings relating to games and sports."
