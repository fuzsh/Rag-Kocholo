Vicki developed the Art and Wine event program for a corporate sponsor of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Wine and Literature event for the Raven Society of the Free Library of Philadelphia.

Traditional wine tastings, while offering more social interaction, don't provide the kind of useful information to make an informed wine selection. A Vinocity event combines the best of both worlds, as Vicki weaves the facts, figures and scientific aspects of winemaking into interesting short stories and anecdotes about wine history and culture.
