        "text": "If you've been around watches, no doubt you've seen this photo. It's collector catnip: John Lennon, one of the most famous people of all time, wearing a Patek Philippe ref. 2499 perpetual calendar chronograph, one of the most important watches ever. Just months after this photo, the former Beatle was murdered, and the watch hasn't been seen since.\n\nThanks to an ongoing lawsuit in Geneva, new information about the mythical Patek's history and current whereabouts has surfaced. But the lawsuit is only the beginning of a story of extortion, theft, and a stolen Patek that traveled from New York to Turkey to Germany to Geneva and, perhaps, back home, as well as the legacy Lennon left behind.\n\nBefore we get to the international intrigue, let's start by talking about what the Lennon 2499 is.\n\nAs Ben wrote in our Reference Points for Patek Perpetual Calendar Chronographs, \"The Patek 2499 is considered by many to be the ultimate Patek Philippe, capturing old-world charm with modern wearability. The 2499 is also probably the most studied and dissected of PP perpetual chronos.\"\n\nPatek made just 349 examples of the 2499 over its 35-year production run. It's complicated, rare, and collectible but also beautifully designed with modern proportions compared to its smaller predecessors.\n\nJust a couple of months ago, we wrote about some of the myth-making around the Lennon 2499, and the court case confirms some of those rumors are true: Yoko Ono bought the watch for Lennon's 40th birthday, just two months before he was murdered in New York City outside his and Ono's apartment. Ono purchased the yellow gold Patek 2499 at Tiffany & Co. in New York with the retailer's signature on the dial.\n\nLegal filings from Geneva reveal that the Lennon 2499 is the subject of an ongoing dispute between two parties, including Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono. Many personal details of the parties have been redacted, including the multiple people who have traded the watch since it was allegedly first stolen from Ono. But it's clear Ono is one party (described as a widow of Japanese nationality living in New York), while the party disputing Ono's claim of ownership is an Italian national living in Hong Kong (more on him in a moment). Now, it's time to fill in the missing details of the story.\n\nAfter Lennon died in 1980, his personal property was cataloged before becoming the property of Ono, including the Lennon 2499.\n\nThen, in 2017, evidence that Karsan had been stealing Lennon's property from Ono surfaced. Auctionata, a Berlin-based auction house, had just gone bankrupt, and when dispersing its assets, lawyers and police found 86 items of Lennon's personal property in Auctionata's storage, including eyeglasses and diaries. According to the auction house, a man identified as Erhan G. by German police (in Germany, it's customary not to release last names) had sold Auctionata these items, acquiring them from Karsan. While Erhan once held the Lennon 2499, it was not among these items â€“ here's what happened.\n\nAccording to the Geneva court filings, Karsan gave the Lennon 2499 to Erhan in 2010, also giving him the 86 other items he'd stolen around this period. Erhan reached out to Auctionata in 2013, eventually entering into a consignment agreement with Auctionata to sell the watch. Erhan noted in a separate letter that he could not guarantee his ownership or that Ono wouldn't make a claim to the Lennon 2499. This began to raise questions about the watch's actual ownership.\n\nShortly after, in an agreement signed in January 2014, Auctionata agreed to privately sell the watch to an Italian dealer, now living in Hong Kong, for â‚¬600,000 instead of bringing it to public auction. To those in the business, he's a dealer with a suspect reputation â€“ I'm told he was also on a board of advisors for Auctionata at the time, perhaps taking advantage of this access for his personal gain. In addition to the cash, the dealer also agreed to sell more than 40 vintage watches to Auctionata as part of the deal.\n\nA few months later, this Italian dealer took the watch to Christie's Geneva to inquire about selling it. After receiving the watch in June, Christie's contacted Ono's attorney in September 2014 to inquire about the watch. This surprised Ono. She replied that the watch must still be at her home, locked in a cupboard with other items from Lennon. After all, this was one of the last gifts she'd bought Lennon just two months before his death. But after looking through her cupboard, Ono discovered for the first time that the watch she'd bought Lennon 35 years prior was no longer there. According to Ono, Karsan was one of the few individuals given access to the room where she kept the watch and Lennon's other personal items.\n\nAfter this, the parties entered into a \"consignment-escrow agreement\" with Christie's, under which the Lennon 2499 would be held in escrow by a lawyer for the Italian dealer until ownership could be fully adjudicated. Since 2015, this has been the status of the Lennon 2499, sitting in legal limbo while the courts decide its ownership.\n\nThe Italian dealer is now the other party in this lawsuit, disputing ownership of the Lennon 2499 with Ono.\n\nIn its final report, German investigators found Erhan guilty of receiving stolen goods, ruling that he knew the watch might've been stolen, even having tried to sell it privately before bringing it to Auctionata. In August 2017, Ono registered the Lennon 2499 in the Stolen Property Register. Erhan was eventually sentenced to one year in prison, while Karsan went on the run, with the Berlin prosecutor and later Europol issuing a warrant for his arrest.\n\nFrom there, Ono and the Italian dealer made claims against each other, asserting their ownership of the Lennon 2499. The Italian dealer's claim was basically that Karsan had been given the watch by Ono (in her German testimony, Ono said she had given Karsan a cheap watch shortly after Lennon's death because she owned many, but in no way would it have ever been an item that meant so much to her), and that Ono had never reported it as stolen. Ono pointed out she didn't even know it'd been stolen until Christie's first contacted her in 2014, after which she quickly began trying to get the watch back. In 2022, the court held additional hearings on the case.\n\nAfter the hearing, the court affirmed a previous ruling that Yoko Ono is the rightful owner of the Lennon 2499, saying Karsan originally stole it. It found no evidence of Ono's intention to give the watch to her former driver, as claimed by the Italian dealer. The Swiss court also pointed to the German criminal investigation, which found that Lennon's 86 other items were stolen. The dealer also essentially tried to put forth what I'd call a \"finders keepers\" theory of his ownership, which the court quickly rejected. After being apart from the watch for over 40 years, it might soon be back in Ono's possession.\n\nThe dealer can appeal the case once more before the decision is final.\n\nShe retreated to a home that she and Lennon built in the Catskills, the latest move in her step back from public life due to deteriorating health in recent years. She's long been battling an illness that has left her in a wheelchair, reportedly requiring round-the-clock medical attention. There's reason to believe no monetary figure in the world could tempt Ono into selling such a sentimental item, much as some auctioneers might try â€“ especially since she's been trying to get the watch back for the better part of a decade. Meanwhile, Ono and Lennon's son, Sean Lennon, has had a successful music career in his own right, and it's possible he might also value the watch more than any amount of money.\n\nThe Geneva court case was first reported in French by the Swiss legal blog Gotham City and brought to the watch world by Arthur Touchot, an employee of Phillips. It's inside baseball, but I point this out because it's interesting that an employee at one of the most well-known auction houses would post about such a thing. To be clear, Phillips has no claim to the watch. Perhaps it's their way, led by auctioneer Aurel Bacs, who has sold the Paul Newman Paul Newman and other important wristwatches of the past 20 years (also including the Bao Dai and the steel 1518), of driving the narrative. Perhaps the hope is it'll lead to the consignment and sale of the Lennon 2499, a white whale for any auctioneer and a potential swan song for Bacs' storied career.\n\nIf that Italian dealer had somehow won this case, it seems Christie's would have had the first right to sell the watch via the consignment-escrow agreement it'd entered into with the parties in 2015 when the ownership dispute began. Some employees involved in that deal are no longer at Christie's (and some are now at Phillips), so perhaps that wouldn't have ended the dispute. But now the watch seems likely to end up in Ono's hands anyway. She's always had her way of doing things, so what she, or Sean, might do with the Lennon 2499 is anyone's guess.\n\nDuring the case, Ono presented evidence valuing the watch between $2 million and $4 million. According to most I spoke to, this is a conservative estimate.\n\n\"It's possibly the most valuable wristwatch on Earth,\" dealer Eric Wind told me. He said it could be a $40 million watch if the right messaging and marketing went into the Lennon 2499.\n\nMeanwhile, another former auction specialist I spoke to wasn't so sure. He pointed to Mel Blanc's 2499, which sold for about $700,000 in May. Mel Blanc was the voice of Bugs Bunny, no small claim to fame. The Lennon provenance is worth much more, but he said it was more like a $10 to $15 million watch than the astronomical, record-breaking numbers some have thrown around. Some experts speaking with Bloomberg about the Lennon 2499 agreed with this range.\n\nAnother comparison might be the platinum 2499 â€“ Philippe Stern had just two made in 1987, using remaining movements from the reference. Only one went to private hands (the other to the Patek Museum), first auctioned in 1989. Eventually, it made its way into mega-collector Eric Clapton's collection before Christie's sold it in 2012 for $3.6 million. It's just as rare and with similar rockstar provenance, which is why Ben called the platinum 2499 the \"Ultimate 2499\" in his Reference Points. But the Lennon 2499 might give it a run for that title. When I asked Ben about the auction potential of the Lennon 2499, he initially said he would've guessed $3 to $5 million, similar to the Clapton 2499, but because of the building narrative around the watch, it's hard to guess where it'd end up.\n\nOf course, the final comparison is to Paul Newman's Paul Newman, which sold for $17.7 million in 2017. But even here, the appeal is different. While the Paul Newman Daytona isn't a particularly rare watch, the name Paul Newman defined a sub-culture of watch collecting. Meanwhile, a Tiffany-signed 2499 is objectively rare, but it's not a watch identified with Lennon. The appeal of the Lennon 2499 lies more in the legend of Lennon himself, and with Ono giving it to him just two months before he died, it almost feels like the watch is a small part of that story. And when artists like Lennon leave us too soon, their legend only seems to grow with time.\n\nThe irony with these watches â€“ two of the most famous and valuable vintage wristwatches ever â€“ is that they come from two guys who seem like they couldn't have been bothered to care much at all. Perhaps that's part of their appeal. I've watched enough interviews of Lennon to know that he always seemed to have the perfectly flippant, witty, and insightful thing to say when asked a question. I know he'd have something similar to say about all this mess (a personal favorite Lennon ad-lib is when he forgets the lyrics to \"Don't Let Me Down\" during The Beatles' rooftop concert and has the other guys in stitches).\n\nAnd now that the long, winding story of the Lennon 2499 has come to light, its journey of theft, from Tiffany & Co. to Turkey to Geneva, and potential resurfacing might only add to its appeal (and price).\n\nBut even as the court case has surfaced new details of John Lennon's Patek 2499, it's still possible we might never see the watch. And that'd be fine, too.\n\nPostscript: One more fun detail: Look at that photo of Lennon wearing that 2499 again. See the American flag pin? I'm told that pin was also bought at Tiffany & Co. and engraved on the back to commemorate Lennon obtaining his Green Card in the United States. In the early '70s, Lennon increasingly caught the attention (and ire) of the U.S. government â€“ he became an anti-war advocate and opposed the reelection of Richard Nixon in 1972. This led to increased surveillance of Lennon and Ono by the government and CIA, culminating with the Nixon White House ordering his deportation. Dozens of high-profile supporters pleaded for Lennon to remain in the U.S., and in 1975, a panel of judges ruled in his favor. In 1976, Lennon obtained his Green Card. The story makes sense and also makes it all sound like it's a bit tongue-in-cheek by Lennon. After years of the U.S. government trying (and failing) to deport him, he got a couple of items from Tiffany & Co., that proud American jeweler: an American flag and an expensive watch with the jeweler's name on the dial. \"I'm here to stay,\" the items seemed to say. If only that could've been true."
