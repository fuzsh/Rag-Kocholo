        "text": "My unique musical journey began in 1994 on the small Caribbean island of Grenada. Born to a large family of artistically driven individuals, but in a country where opportunities and access for creatives are very limited, I found writing and singing to be a second language and ultimately a stepping stone to the artiste I am today.\n\nSince 2014, I have been professionally focused on making Afro-Caribbean Pop & R&B music. My songs chronicle and share my coping mechanisms for life while reinforcing my belief that the secret to happiness lies in remaining true to yourself and being grateful for everything in your life.\n\nThis mindset is what propels me in pursuit of my goal of global impact through my music. I take advantage of every possible opportunity to create music that is often described as spiritual, uplifting, joyful and effortlessly appealing. The overarching theme throughout my songs speaks to female independence, mental health and the shared experiences of hard working individuals reaching for success whatever the situation they may be in.\n\nAlthough quiet and controlled in demeanour, I am very adventurous and playful with my music. I draw from the array of musical influences I had growing up, and embrace and enjoy experimenting and incorporating different styles in my musical creations. This, I believe has led to an individual sound that is sure to forge its own distinctive path in the musical arena.\n\nSo far, I have released three bodies of work, ‘Think In Colour’, ‘I Feel’ a second album and an EP ‘Million Moments’. In 2019 my song ‘I Feel’ earned a finalist prize in the John Lennon Songwriting Competition. In 2020, I launched ‘Sabrina’s Treehouse Concerts’ series which has flourished since the first show and in 2021 toured Europe and the UK.\n\nIn 2022, I added four new single releases to my discography, including “Call Me”, produced by Nigerian producer extraordinaire ‘Mystro’, played at the prestigious Bush Hall Venue in London and closed the year alongside the grammy award winning Pentatonix and other creatives across the globe on a Disney+ special called ‘Pentatonix: Around the World for the Holidays’.\n\n2023 was equally intense. While maintaining monthly performances at the Tree House Concerts, I have in the first half of the year also added another two releases to my discography – “I Feel Amazing” and “Woman”. I have also completed a UK tour alongside a new offering of “Kitchen Concerts” and reintroduced my Wide Open Concert. Most significant however is my debut at the Royal Albert Hall as an opening act for Asa – the ‘soul-full’ Nigerian-French singer, songwriter and recording artist.\n\nThrough hard work and constant innovation, I remain in steady pursuit of the dream. Stay with me on the journey, there is so much more to come.\n\nMy unique musical journey began in 1994 on the small Caribbean island of Grenada.
