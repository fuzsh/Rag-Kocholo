        "text": "Billy said: \"I don't think my mother and father really believed what had happened when I told them, until I was actually packing my suitcase the next morning. Then my mum got a bit worried about me going off all on my own, but I convinced her it was the biggest chance I'd ever have.\"\n\nParnes reasoned that no one called Ronald Wycherley would become a rock star, so he renamed him Billy - after band leader Billy Cotton - and Fury, to compensate for the singer's shyness.\n\nBilly's first recording, Maybe Tomorrow (one of those he offered to Marty Wilde) went into the Top 20.\n\nWithin seven months, he had signed a seven year contract with Decca.\n\nHe made the Sound Of Fury 10-inch album, a rockabilly collection of self-penned numbers, which remains many fans' favourite recording. Every song was recorded during two, three hour sessions. Among the backing instrumentalists is Joe Brown, later to have a number 1 with Picture Of You, and still touring today. For backing vocals, Billy flew the Four Jays from Liverpool at his own expense. The drummer, Andy White, played drums on The Beatles' Love Me Do when Ringo was declared inadequate.\n\nOne of the groups that auditioned unsuccessfully to become Billy's backing group comprised Johnny Hutch (standing in for Tommy Moore on drums), Stu Sutcliffe, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison. For the first time, they called themselves The Silver Beetles. According to pop legend, they were offered the job at Â£20 a week each if the inexpert Stu Sutcliffe was dropped as bass guitarist, but John Lennon (who had earlier secured Billy's autograph) refused to desert his friend.\n\nIn the next year, Billy had four more hits, including Colette, on which one of the Vernons Girls sang harmony. Colette was an actress in a sub-titled French film, who so impressed Billy that he wrote the song on a cigarette packet that he found on the floor of the cinema.\n\nBilly once explained his song-writing method: \"I get an idea when I'm depressed, usually because one of my girls has let me down, and I scribble a lyric and sing the thing straight into a tape recorder. It never gets on to paper until someone at the music publisher puts it there. Then they send me back an arrangement, which I can't read, so I just record it the way I thought of it.\"\n\nBilly loved rock and roll, and he could belt out the real rocking numbers.\n\nHowever, Parnes re-invented him as a balladeer, and in the eyes of the public, Billy became identified with big production numbers.\n\nHis cover version of Tony Orlando's Halfway To Paradise went to number 3 in 1961, and to many people in the UK, Billy Fury and Paradise are inextricably linked. From 1995-7, listeners to Britain's most popular oldies station, Gem-AM, voted Halfway To Paradise the runner-up in their annual favourite oldies chart. (The winner each year was Unchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers.) Paradise finally reached number 1 in the vote in 1998.\n\nBilly fought his shyness and became a real presence on stage, with his typical hunched-shoulder stance, and the British public took him to their hearts.\n\nAlthough the hits continued to come, Billy never had a number 1.\n\nHe reached number 2 with Jealousy, and while When Will You Say I Love You was at number 3, the top spot was held by From Me To You, by the band that once failed an audition for the job of Billy's backing group.\n\nIn fact, in the 1960s, Billy had more top 20 hits in the UK than anyone except The Beatles, Cliff Richard and Elvis Presley.\n\nBilly's heart problems continued to plague him from the end of 1961. On some tour dates, he had to cut short his act, and on others he would be replaced at the last minute. At the time, fans were told that he was suffering from exhaustion or flu.\n\nHe was backed by some fine groups, including the Tornados, Georgie Fame And The Blue Flames, an early line-up of Mott The Hoople, and The Gamblers.\n\nBilly's good looks made him a natural for television. His first appearance was in a drama, Ted Willis's Strictly For The Sparrows, in which he sang one song. He made his debut in Jack Good's Oh Boy! in February, 1959, then he and Marty Wilde became two of the favourite performers on Jack Good's Boy Meets Girls, which ran from September, 1959 to March 1960.\n\nNext, Billy and Marty co-hosted Good's last regular TV series, Wham!, which lasted nine weeks in 1960.\n\nIn 1962, he made his film debut in Play It Cool, a low budget film that was Michael Winner's first major feature. Other films were I've Gotta Horse, and a guest appearance in That'll Be The Day - the album from this film reached no 1.\n\nThat May, amid much publicity, he and Parnes flew to Los Angeles to present Elvis Presley with gold and silver discs for UK sales. They met on the Paramount Pictures set of Girls, Girls, Girls.\n\nBilly recalled 20 years later: \"We didn't really say much at all. I was on the set all day watching him. All we really got to say to each other was: 'Hi'. He was one of the nicest people I ever met - he called everyone 'sir'.\"\n\nAs a result, Billy's last release of 1962 was Because Of Love, a ballad from the film.\n\nParnes had knocked a year off Billy's age, believing that this would make him more attractive to girl fans. So on his 22nd birthday, Billy had to pretend it was his 21st, and celebrate appropriately.\n\nSee Final Days."
