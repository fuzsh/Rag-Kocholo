        "text": "There are lives around Wyoming that are about to change. High school and college graduations have already begun, and many graduates' next phase of life is about to start.\n\nEven though it was nearly 30 years since I graduated, I can remember one piece of advice I received from my best friend's dad, Bob.\n\nLife will start to move faster now that you're out of school. Milestones will come and go; you have to start making tough decisions; you'll get a job, then maybe another, fall in love, get married, maybe divorced, retire, and die. Don't let all of those things get in the way of living life to its fullest; go on adventures, make mistakes, and enjoy it all.\n\nThrough the years, I've thought about those words as I moved to different places, camped in the mountains, hung out on a beach, fished on the ocean, worried about jobs and finances, made many mistakes, hunted elk, and married. I've tried my best to enjoy it all.\n\nI've been seeing people posting graduation pictures and ceremonies when I saw Jerry Seinfeld's speech to the graduates at Duke University. I wasn't sure how I felt about it initially, but his words were like what Bob told me long ago and could benefit new graduates.\n\nDon't think about having, think about becoming.\n\nCongratulations to the graduates who are about to embark on the next part of their journey through life.\n\n2024 graduates, I'm passing this same advice Bob gave me on to you. It's worked out great for me.\n\nLife will start to move faster now that you're out of school. Milestones will come and go; you have to start making tough decisions; you'll get a job, then maybe another, fall in love, get married, maybe divorced, retire, and die. Don't let all of those things get in the way of living life to its fullest; go on adventures, make mistakes, and enjoy it all.\n\nGood luck."
