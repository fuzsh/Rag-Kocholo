        "text": "Lennon History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nThere are many Irish surnames being used today in forms that are quite different than their original, ancient forms. Lennon originally appeared in Gaelic as Ã“ Leannain, which is possibly derived from the word leann, which denotes a cloak. Another possible derivation is from the word leanan, which means paramour.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Lennon family\n\nThe surname Lennon was first found in County Galway (Irish: Gaillimh) part of the province of Connacht, located on the west coast of the Island, where they held a family seat from ancient times.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Lennon family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Lennon research. Another 49 words (4 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Lennon History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nLennon Spelling Variations\n\nPronunciation, rather than spelling, guided scribes and church officials when recording names during the Middle Ages. This practice often resulted in one person's name being recorded under several different spellings. Numerous spelling variations of the surname Lennon are preserved in these old documents. The various spellings of the name that were found include Lennon, Lannin, Lannon, Linnane, O'Lennon, Lennane, Leonard, MacAlinion, O'Lennan and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Lennon family\n\nNotable amongst the family name at this time was\n\nJohn Brown Lennon, American Labour Movement\n\nLennon Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Lennon is the 4,111st most popular surname with an estimated 7,461 people with that name. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nLennon migration to the United States +\n\nDuring the 19th century thousands of impoverished Irish families made the long journey to British North America and the United States. These people were leaving a land that had become beset with poverty, lack of opportunity, and hunger. In North America, they hoped to find land, work, and political and religious freedoms. Although the majority of the immigrants that survived the long sea passage did make these discoveries, it was not without much perseverance and hard work: by the mid-19th century land suitable for agriculture was short supply, especially in British North America, in the east; the work available was generally low paying and physically taxing construction or factory work; and the English stereotypes concerning the Irish, although less frequent and vehement, were, nevertheless, present in the land of freedom, liberty, and equality for all men. The largest influx of Irish settlers occurred with Great Potato Famine during the late 1840s. Research into passenger and immigration lists has brought forth evidence of the early members of the Lennon family in North America:\n\nLennon Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nWilliam Lennon, who settled in Virginia in 1635\n\nPeirce Lennon, who arrived in Virginia in 1635 2\n\nPierce Lennon, who landed in Virginia in 1642 2\n\nEdmund Lennon, who landed in Virginia in 1642 2\n\nLennon Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nEdward Lennon, aged 28, who arrived in New York in 1812 2\n\nHenry Lennon, aged 17, who arrived in New York in 1812 2\n\nJames Lennon, aged 23, who arrived in New York in 1812 2\n\nMatthew Lennon, who arrived in Tippecanoe County, Ind in 1842 2\n\nMathew Lennon, who landed in Tippecanoe County, Ind in 1844 2\n\n...

By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life. Early immigrants include:\n\nLennon Settlers in New Zealand in the 19th Century\n\nMiss Elizabeth Lennon, (b. 1835), aged 27, British domestic servant travelling from London aboard the ship \"Queen of Mersey\" arriving in Lyttelton, Christchurch, Southland, South Island, New Zealand on 20th October 1862 10\n\nMiss Jane Lennon, (b. 1836), aged 28, Cornish dairy maid departing on 20th February 1864 aboard the ship \"Ivanhoe\" arriving in Lyttelton, Canterbury, New Zealand on 13th June 1864 11\n\nEdward Lennon, aged 24, a carpenter, who arrived in Auckland, New Zealand aboard the ship \"Maraval\" in 1879\n\nLennon migration to West Indies +\n\nThe British first settled the British West Indies around 1604. They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 12\n\nLennon Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nRichard Lennon, who settled in Barbados with his wife and servants in 1680\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Lennon (post 1700) +\n\nJohn Winston Ono Lennon MBE (1940-1980), English singer/songwriter, member of the Beatles, posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994\n\nCharlie Lennon (1938-2024), Irish musician, fiddler, composer and pianist\n\nBiddy White Lennon (1945-2017), Irish actress and food writer, known as a judge on The Great Irish Bake Off and for her appearance on The Riordans\n\nJoe Lennon (1935-2016), Irish Gaelic footballer, Down Senior Football Captain in 1968, All-Ireland Senior Football winning captain in 1968\n\nNeil Francis Lennon (b. 1971), Northern Irish former footballer\n\nGeorge Lennon (1900-1991), Irish officer during the Irish War Of Independence\n\nJames Lennon, Irish Diplomat\n\nCynthia Lennon (1939-2015), nÃ©e Powell, English first wife of musician John Lennon, and mother of Julian Lennon\n\nPatrick Orlando Lennon (b. 1968), American former Major League Baseball outfielder\n\nThomas Lennon (b. 1970), American actor, comedian and writer\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Prisco stirpe hibernico\n\nMotto Translation: Of an ancient Irish stock\n\nCitations +\n\n\"What are the 5,000 Most Common Last Names in the U.S.?\".
