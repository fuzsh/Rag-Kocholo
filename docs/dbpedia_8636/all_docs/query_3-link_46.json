        "text": "Walking Tour of Prague\n\nOn one of the first days of the program, participants go on a walking tour of the beautiful, historical city, including sites such as the grounds of Prague Castle, the narrow streets of Staré Město (Old Town), the statue of St. John of Nepomuk on the Charles Bridge and the world famous Prague Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square.\n\nBowling Night\n\nDuring EJI participants will gather at a local bowling alley to get to know each other and to exercise their bowling skills.\n\nAccommodation + Meals\n\nAs part of EJI, participants will stay in Zeitraum, (U Průhonu 1099/56, 170 00 Praha 7-Holešovice) a dormitory located in the Holešovice district. The double occupancy dorm rooms have a private bathroom, and the building includes a shared kitchen and high speed WiFi. TFAS staff will assign same-gender roommates from different countries to promote cross-cultural exchange.\n\nBreakfast and lunch will be provided on weekdays at AAU throughout the program. Every effort will be made to include alternatives for participants with special dietary requirements (kosher, vegetarian, etc.) due to religion and/or lifestyle. Participants are free for dinner to explore the abundance of local restaurants and cafes.\n\nTransportation\n\nParticipants are provided with a Prague Public Transportation Metro Pass. This pass is used on all forms of public transportation within the Prague city limits: trams, buses, and the metro. More details about the Prague Public Transportation system will be given to the participants prior to arriving to Prague.\n\nNeighborhood\n\nThe Holešovice district, also referred to as Prague 7, is considered among the top 10 of Europe’s coolest neighborhoods. The neighborhood surrounding the dorms has a variety of shops, restaurants, coffee houses, and pubs.\n\nBy taking the metro a few short stops, you could find yourself walking through the grounds of Prague Castle, strolling along the streets of Malá Strana (Lesser Town), crossing the Vlatava River on the famous Charles Bridge, exploring Staré Město (Old Town), gazing at the Prague Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square, or walking through Wenceslas Square, the site of historic protests during the Prague Spring of 1968 and the 1989 Velvet Revolution."
