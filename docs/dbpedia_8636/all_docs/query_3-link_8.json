        "text": "Before he was one of the world's most iconic musicians, John Lennonâwho was born in Liverpool on October 9, 1940âwas a choir boy and a Boy Scout. Let's take a look at some facts you might not have known about the leader and founding member of The Beatles.\n\n1. John Lennon grew up near Strawberry Field.\n\nBy the time he was 5 years old, John Lennon had been all but abandoned by his parents, so instead went to live with Mimi and George Smith, his aunt and uncle, in Woolton, England. He lived near a local Salvation Army orphanage, and loved to explore its garden, which was known as Strawberry Fields. In Barry Milesâ book Many Years From Now, Paul McCartney recalled how it was \"a secret garden. John's memory of it [was] â¦ There was a wall you could bunk over and it was a rather wild garden, it wasn't manicured at all, so it was easy to hide in.â\n\n2. John Lennon was a choir boy and a Boy Scout.\n\nYes, John Lennonâthe great rock 'n' roll rebel and iconoclastâwas once a choir boy and a Boy Scout. Lennon began his singing career as a choir boy at St. Peter's Church in Liverpool, England and was a member of the 3rd Allerton Boy Scout troop.\n\n3. John Lennonâs first instrument was the banjo.\n\nThe first song John Lennon learned to play as a teenage rock ânâ roll fan was Buddy Hollyâs âThatâll Be the Day.â But he didnât master the tune on any instrument you might pose with in front of the mirror. âMy mother Julia taught it to me on the banjo, sitting there with endless patience until I managed to work out all the chords,â Lennon once said. The infamous banjo went missing after Juliaâs death in 1958 and became the subject of the 2012 novel Juliaâs Banjo, which spawned the stage adaptation Lennonâs Banjo.\n\n4. John Lennon hated his own voice.\n\nIncredibly, one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music hated his own voice. Lennon did not like the sound of his voice and loved to double-track his records. He would often ask the band's producer, George Martin, to cover the sound of his voice: \"Can't you smother it with tomato ketchup or something?\"\n\n5. Songwriting was âtortureâ to John Lennon.\n\nLennon wrote some of the most indelible pop songs of the 20th centuryâand he apparently hated every minute of it. Speaking with just days before his death, Lennon revealed that songwriting was âabsolute tortureâ for him. âI always think thereâs nothing there, itâs sh*t, itâs no good, itâs not coming out, this is garbage ... and even if it does come out, I think, 'What the hell is it anyway?'\" he said. The only exceptions, he added, were the â10 or so songs the gods give you and that come out of nowhere.â\n\n6. \"Twist and Shout\" was not kind to John Lennon's vocal cords.\n\nOn February 11, 1963, The Beatles spent one very long day recording 10 songs that would appear on their debut album, Please Please Me. At the end of the 12-hour session, they tackled âTwist and Shout,â a song that required Lennonâwho was already hoarseâto shred what remained of his voice.\n\nâThe last song nearly killed me,â Lennon said of âTwist and Shoutâ in 1976. âMy voice wasnât the same for a long time after; every time I swallowed it was like sandpaper. I was always bitterly ashamed of it, because I could sing it better than that; but now it doesnât bother me. You can hear that Iâm just a frantic guy doing his best.â\n\n7. John Lennon was dissatisfied with all of The Beatles' records.\n\nWhile dining with his former producer, George Martin, one night years after the band had split up, Lennon revealed that he'd like to re-record every Beatles song. Completely amazed, Martin asked him, \"Even 'Strawberry Fields'?\" \"Especially 'Strawberry Fields,'\" answered Lennon.\n\n8. John Lennon was the only Beatle who didn't become a full-time vegetarian.\n\nGeorge Harrison was the first Beatle to go vegetarian; according to most sources, he officially became a vegetarian in 1965. Paul McCartney joined the \"veggie\" ranks a few years later. Ringo became a vegetarian not so much for spiritual reasons, like Paul and George, but because of health problems. Lennon had toyed with vegetarianism in the 1960s, but he always ended up eating meat, one way or another.\n\n9. John Lennonâs signature eyeglasses were far from trendy.\n\nWhile filming the 1967 black comedy How I Won the War, John Lennon took a liking to the round spectacles that were part of his soldier characterâs wardrobe. These werenât designer glasses, but rather the utilitarian handiwork of the UK's National Health Service. Lennon loved the ugly âgrannyâ frames so much that he made them his signature look for the rest of his life.\n\n10. John Lennon loved to play Monopoly.\n\nDuring his Beatles days, Lennon was a devout Monopoly player. He had his own Monopoly set and often played in his hotel room or on planes. He liked to stand up when he threw the dice, and he was crazy about the properties Boardwalk and Park Place. He didn't even care if he lost the game, as long as he had Boardwalk and Park Place in his possession.\n\n11. John Lennon was the first Beatle to get married.\n\nLennon wed Cynthia Powell, whom heâd met in art school, on August 23, 1962. The reason for their union: Cynthia was pregnant, and on April 8, 1963, she gave birth to the coupleâs only child, a son named Julian. Beatles manager Brian Epstein worked to keep Johnâs marriage a secret, but his efforts were futile. When the Fab Four performed on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964, a caption reading âSorry girls, heâs marriedâ appeared on screen when Lennon got his closeup during ââTill There Was You.â\n\n12. John Lennon was the last Beatle to learn how to drive.\n\nLennon got his driver's license at the age of 24 (on February 15, 1965). He was regarded as a terrible driver by all who knew him. He finally gave up driving after he totaled his Aston-Martin in 1969 on a trip to Scotland with his wife, Yoko Ono; his son, Julian; and Kyoko, Ono's daughter. Lennon needed 17 stitches after the accident.\n\nWhen they returned to England, Lennon and Ono mounted the wrecked car on a pillar at their home. From then on, Lennon always used a chauffeur or driver.\n\n13. Thereâs only one Beatles song featuring just John Lennon and Paul McCartney.\n\nIn 1969, while honeymooning in Paris with Yoko Ono, Lennon began writing a song about the controversy surrounding their recent marriage. When he got back to London, Lennon went over to McCartneyâs house to finish the composition, which he had already titled âThe Ballad of John and Yoko.â Lennon and McCartney then quickly booked a session at Abbey Road and recorded the song as a duo (Starr was filming The Magic Christian with Peter Sellers and Harrison was on vacation).\n\nâJohn was in an impatient mood so I was happy to help,â McCartney said. âItâs quite a good song; it has always surprised me how with just the two of us on it, it ended up sounding like The Beatles.\"\n\n14. John Lennon reportedly used to sleep in a coffin.\n\nAccording to Allan Williams, an early manager for The Beatles, Lennon liked to sleep in an old coffin. Williams had an old, abandoned coffin on the premises of his coffee bar, The Jacaranda. As a gag, Lennon would sometimes nap in it.\n\n15. John Lennon recorded one of popâs first diss tracks.\n\nEveryone remembers Lennonâs 1971 album Imagine for the utopian title track. But the LP also features âHow Do You Sleep,â a rather nasty attack on Paul McCartney. âThose freaks was right when they said you was dead,â Lennon sings in the opening verse, referencing the infamous âPaul Is Deadâ myth. Lennon later sings, âThe only thing you done was yesterday,â referring to the Paul-penned Beatle favorite âYesterday.â In fairness, Lennon was responding to a handful of subtler lyrical jabs on McCartneyâs 1971 album Ram.\n\n16. The last time John Lennon saw Paul McCartney was on April 24, 1976.\n\nMcCartney was visiting Lennon at his New York apartment. They were watching Saturday Night Live together when producer Lorne Michaels, as a gag, offered the Beatles $3000 to come on the show. Lennon and McCartney almost took a cab to the show as a joke, but decided against it, as they were just too tired. (Too bad! It would have been one of the great moments in television history.)\n\n17. John Lennon was supposed to sing lead on The Beatles' first single, 1962's \"Love Me Do.\"\n\nLennon sang lead on a great majority of the early Beatles songs, but Paul McCartney took the lead on their very first one. The lead was originally supposed to be Lennon, but because he had to play the harmonica, the lead was given to McCartney instead.\n\n18. John Lennon stole the harmonica heard on âLove Me Do.â\n\nLennon is known as the bad boy of The Beatles, and true to form, he added a bit of delinquency to the groupâs 1962 debut single, âLove Me Do.â The song is notable for Johnâs use of harmonica, and he reportedly played the signature riff on a mouth organ he swiped from a music shop in Arnhem, The Netherlands, in 1960. In terms of musicianship, Lennon didnât exactly commit thievery, but he based his harmonica lick on the one heard in Bruce Channelâs âHey! Babyâ\n\n19. \"All You Need Is Love\" was the best lyric John Lennon ever wrote.\n\nA friend once asked Lennon what was the best lyric he ever wrote. \"That's easy,\" replied Lennon, \"All you need is love.\"\n\n20. John Lennon wanted Jesus and Hitler for the cover of Sgt. Pepperâs Lonely Hearts Club Band.\n\nAfter British pop artist Peter Blake came up with the cover concept for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Bandâthe band surrounded by cardboard cutouts of famous figures from throughout historyâhe asked all four Beatles to make lists of people to include. One of Lennonâs picks was Jesus Christ, even though heâd recently gotten into a heap of trouble for saying The Beatles were âmore popularâ than the Christian messiah. Blakeâs team never actually made up a Jesus cutout, but they did create one for another of Johnâs controversial selections: Adolf Hitler. The FÃ¼hrer apparently made the final cover, but heâs behind the band, so you canât see him.\n\n21. John Lennon was the final Beatle to have a #1 solo hit in America.\n\nBy the time John Lennon released 1974âs Walls and Bridges, Paul McCartney had topped the Billboard Hot 100 three times. George Harrison and Ringo Starr (yes, Ringo) had each reached the summit twice. Among ex-Beatles, only Lennon had yet to notch a #1 single. That finally changed with âWhatever Gets You Thru the Night,â a jaunty dance number featuring Elton John on piano and backup vocals. It reached #1 on November 16, 1974, giving Lennon his firstâand onlyâU.S. chart-topper.\n\n22. John Lennon had a deep and abiding love of cats.\n\nThough Lennon did have a couple of dogs, he was absolutely crazy for cats. He had many of them over the years, each one holding a very special place in his heart. As a kid, he had a cat named Elvisânamed after Elvis Presleyâbut discovered that Elvis was a female when she gave birth to a litter of kittens. Still, the name stuck. More than a dozen feline friends would follow over the years.\n\n23. John Lennon made his final concert appearance after losing a bet.\n\nAfter helping Lennon record âWhatever Gets You Thru the Night,â Elton John bet the former Beatle that the single would reach #1 in America. A doubtful Lennon took the wager, agreeing to perform with John at Madison Square Garden if he lost. Sure enough, the song topped the Hot 100 on November 16, 1974, and 12 days laterâon Thanksgiving nightâLennon joined John for three songs, including the Beatles classics âLucy In the Sky with Diamondsâ and âI Saw Her Standing There.â It would be Lennonâs final proper concert appearance.\n\n24. John Lennon was into new wave and punk.\n\nOn December 6, 1980, two days before he was murdered, John Lennon sat for an interview with Andy Peebles of the BBC. During the chat, Lennon professed his admiration for punk provocateurs the Sex Pistols, English ska revivalists Madness, and American new-wave party-starters The B-52âs, among others. Lennon credited his assistant Fred Seaman with hipping him to these new artists, even though he was initially reluctant to listen.\n\n25. The last photographer to snap John Lennonâs picture was Paul Goresh.\n\nIronically (and sadly), Lennon was signing an album for the person who was to assassinate him a few hours later when he was snapped by amateur photographer Paul Goresh on December 8, 1980.\n\nLennon obligingly signed a copy of his latest album, Double Fantasy, for Mark David Chapman. Later that same day, Lennon returned from the recording studio and was gunned down by Chapman, the same person for whom he had so kindly signed his autograph.\n\nMorbidly, a photographer sneaked into the morgue and snapped a photo of Lennon's body before it was cremated the day after his assassination. Yoko Ono has never revealed the whereabouts of his ashes or what happened to them.\n\nThis post has been updated for 2020."
