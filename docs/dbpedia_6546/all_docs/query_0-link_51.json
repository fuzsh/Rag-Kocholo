        "text": "Football emerges in Biscay in the late 19th century as Bilbao and its surrounding areas experience a period of rapid industrial development. The sport was initially brought to Bilbao by British migrant workers and young Basques who had studied in Britain. The enthusiasm for this new sport inspires the birth of Athletic Club in 1898.\n\nAthletic Club play their games in Lamiako, Leioa. In 1902, Athletic wear their famous blue-and-white strip for the first time, make a foreign debut and win the first ever Alfonso XIII Coronation Cup. The Club inscribes its Statutes, integrates Bilbao FC and creates the Athletic Club Branch in Madrid.\n\nAthletic Club players turn out in red and white for the first time and the Club decides to compete without foreigners. The team leaves Lamiako and after a brief hiatus in Jolaseta (Getxo) they settle permanently in Bilbao in 1913. Their new home is San Mamés, which fans affectionately nickname ‘The Cathedral’. The Royal Spanish Football Federation is also officially founded in 1913.\n\nProfessionalism gradually seeps into the Athletic Club squad and we say goodbye to the last generation of amateur footballers such as Carmelo Goyenechea. Athletic are now part of a new 10-team domestic league competition called ‘La Liga’. The Club expands its sporting sections and in 1923 celebrates its Silver Anniversary.\n\nThis is the most successful period in Athletic Club’s history. There are numerous titles, international players and goal-scoring records which still stand to this day. But due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, all competitions are suspended between 1936-1939. The Club is hindered and the team disintegrates. These are years of strife and exile.\n\nThe effects of the Civil War weaken Athletic socially, economically and on the pitch. The club rebuilds and places its trust in youth. Led by a historic frontline, the youngsters form the base of the first side to be permanently awarded the League trophy and they also win a third Copa del Rey. The club celebrates its first 50-year anniversary.\n\nThis is the time of \"the eleven villagers\", symbols of Athletic and our youth academy. New titles see the club’s popularity grow, there’s a first European Cup appearance and the first Fan Clubs are formed. San Mamés changes its look: the new Main Stand and the Arch - an icon of industrial Bilbao - are built.\n\nBefore Spanish football incorporates foreign players, the club reinforces its commitment to youth. Athletic Under-18s (1960) and Bilbao Athletic (1964) are created. In addition, Lezama, the first purpose-built football academy in the country, is designed (1969). This new generation of Lions, with José Ángel Iribar as goalkeeper, end the decade with another Copa title.\n\nAthletic Club opens Lezama Academy, celebrates its 75th anniversary with another Copa title and holds the first Fan Clubs Congress (Bailén, Jaén). The team, strengthened by several signings, reaches a European final for the first time. After the political regime change, the Club asserts its democratic principles by stating, “one member, one vote”.\n\nAfter a long wait, the Lions win two La Liga titles and one Copa del Rey. Vast crowds line the riverbanks as Athletic’s players take to the River Nervión in La Gabarra (a small barge) to celebrate their victories; a true highlight in the history of Athletic Club and Biscay. San Mamés hosts the World Cup. The Club brings out an anthem and opens its headquarters: Ibaigane Palace.\n\nThis is the first decade without a trophy in Athletic’s history. After the Bosman ruling, the club must rise to the challenge in order to keep competing. Despite everything, the Zurigorri continues to play in Europe, finishes second in the league and qualifies for the Champions League. The club celebrates its first Centenary.\n\nIn the context of globalised football, the Lions are less competitive. Some seasons they only just manage to avoid relegation from La Liga, but in others they play in Europe, and they reach the Copa del Rey final for the first time in 24 years. The Club founds Athletic Club Women and the Lionesses win four league titles.\n\nAfter a century playing in the same ground, Athletic opens its new stadium in 2013: San Mamés, the new Cathedral. In this decade, Athletic Club are runners-up eight times. The Lions reach the Europa League final and the Copa del Rey final twice. The Lionesses are four-times runners-up in the League and twice in the Copa. The compensation comes in 2015-16 when the men’s team win the Spanish Super Cup - our first trophy in 30 years - and the women’s team take home the league title.\n\nFor Athletic, the outbreak of the pandemic at the beginning of 2020 had a decisive impact on the start of a promising decade. The football world in general suffered as a result of COVID-19, which left the stadiums without their essence: fans. In the midst of this uncertain panorama, 2021 began in style, the Lions beat Real Madrid and FC Barcelona on the way to Supercopa glory. What’s more, Athletic played two Copa del Rey finals in the space of two weeks (the postponed 2020 final against Real and the 2021 edition, against Barça)."
