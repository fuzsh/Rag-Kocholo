        "text": "ORLANDO (June 11, 2024) — The U.S. Men’s National Team’s final preparation match for the 2024 Copa América tournament sees the squad welcome five-time FIFA World Cup champions Brazil to Orlando’s Camping World Stadium for the Allstate Continental Clásico on Wednesday night.\n\nThe opening whistle is set to blow at 7 p.m. ET, with broadcast coverage available on TNT, Telemundo, truTV, and Universo, with streaming options on Max and Peacock, and additional coverage on FDP Radio. Alongside broadcast coverage, fans will also be able to follow the match via Facebook, Twitter @USMNT, Instagram @USMNT and the official U.S. Soccer App.\n\nFollowing Wednesday’s match, the USMNT will depart for Dallas where it will kick off its Copa América campaign in Group C against Bolivia on June 23, followed by matchups with Panama in Atlanta on June 27, and Uruguay in Kansas City, Mo. on July 1.\n\nDETAILED ROSTER BY POSITION (CLUB/COUNTRY; CAPS/GOALS)\n\nGOALKEEPERS (3): Ethan Horvath (Cardiff City/WAL; 9/0), Sean Johnson (Toronto FC/CAN; 13/0), Matt Turner (Nottingham Forest/ENG; 40/0)\n\nDEFENDERS (9): Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic/SCO; 17/0), Kristoffer Lund (Palermo/ITA; 3/0), Mark McKenzie (Genk/BEL; 13/0), Shaq Moore (Nashville SC; 18/1), Tim Ream (Fulham/ENG; 57/1), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/ENG; 17/1), Antonee Robinson (Fulham/ENG; 42/4), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati; 29/3), Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach/GER; 10/0)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (8): Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/ENG; 38/2), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/ESP; 12/0), Luca de la Torre (Celta Vigo/ESP; 21/0), Weston McKennie (Juventus/ITA; 52/11), Yunus Musah (AC Milan; ITA; 36/0), Gio Reyna (Nottingham Forest/ENG; 27/8), Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 11/0), Timmy Tillman (LAFC; 1/0)\n\nFORWARDS (7): Brenden Aaronson (Union Berlin/GER; 40/8), Folarin Balogun (Monaco/FRA; 11/3), Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 24/10), Christian Pulisic (AC Milan/ITA; 67/28), Josh Sargent (Norwich City/ENG; 23/5), Tim Weah (Juventus/ITA; 38/6), Haji Wright (Coventry City/ENG; 10/4)\n\nLAST TIME OUT\n\nThe USMNT comes into Wednesday’s meeting against Brazil after a Saturday night meeting with Colombia at Commanders Field in Landover, Md., at the Summer Showdown presented by Marriott Bonvoy.\n\nColombia – who entered the match riding a 21-match unbeaten streak – were on the front foot, scoring in the sixth and 19th minutes to gain an early 2-0 lead. USMNT forward Tim Weah pulled a goal back in the 58th minute – his sixth career international tally – but a late trio of goals from the visitors secured Colombia a 5-1 victory.\n\nPRIDE-THEMED NUMBERS\n\nAs part of U.S. Soccer’s partnership with the You Can Play Project, the Federation is celebrating and supporting the LGBTQ+ community during Pride Month in June.\n\nSpecial edition number packs will be worn at all four USMNT and USWNT matches in June that U.S. Soccer controls, which includes Saturday’s match against Colombia as well as Wednesday night’s clash with Brazil.\n\nU.S. Soccer will then auction off signed, player-issued Men’s and Women’s National Team jerseys with rainbow-themed numbers inspired by Pride, with all proceeds going to You Can Play to help promote a safe and inclusive environment for the LGBTQ+ community. Fans can bid now at ussoccer.com/youcanplay and the auction will run through June 30\n\nThe You Can Play Project is an organization dedicated to ensuring equality, respect and safety for all athletes, coaches and fans no matter their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.\n\nAGAINST BRAZIL\n\nOne of international soccer’s most successful teams, Brazil will provide a true test for the USA ahead of the 2024 Copa América. The USMNT is 1-18-0 against the Seleção all-time in a series dating back to 1930, the lone victory coming during the 1998 Concacaf Gold Cup, a 1-0 triumph as Brazil competed in the region’s continental championship as a guest nation. Goalkeeper Kasey Keller put in a legendary performance in Los Angeles, making 10 stops against Brazil’s vaunted attack while Preki netted the game-winning goal in the second half.\n\nThe nations last met on Sept. 7, 2018, a 2-0 loss for the U.S. in East Rutherford, N.J. sBrazil has won the Copa America nine times and was drawn into Group D alongside Colombia, Costa Rica and Paraguay.\n\nIN ORLANDO\n\nOrlando has served as a fortress for the USMNT in recent years, with the U.S. sporting a 7-2-0 record all-time in the city.\n\nWednesday’s match against Brazil will be the USMNT’s first match at Camping World Stadium since 1998, which saw a 1-0 win against Sweden on Jan. 28 of that year. The U.S. had only played two other matches prior at the stadium formerly known as the Citrus Bowl – a pair of 1-0 defeats to Russia and Australia in 1993. The team’s most recent six matches played in Orlando were held at INTER&Co Stadium.\n\nThe City Beautiful also played host for a key World Cup qualifying match against Panama on March 27, 2022, where a Christian Pulisic hat trick led the U.S. to a 5-1 win and the brink of clinching a berth to Qatar 2022.\n\nROSTER NOTES\n\nThe roster will have an average age of 25 years, 219 days as of matchday against Brazil on Wednesday, June 12.\n\nThe 27 players represent clubs in 10 different countries: England (8), Italy (5), USA (4), Netherlands (3), Germany (2), Spain (2), Belgium (1), France (1), Scotland (1), Wales (1).\n\nChristian Pulisic (67) is the leading cap-winner, followed by Tim Ream (57), Weston McKennie (52), Antonee Robinson (42), Matt Turner (40), Tyler Adams (39), Tim Weah (38) and Yunus Musah (36).\n\nIn returning to Orlando, goalkeeper Matt Turner will play in the same city where he made his USMNT debut, saving a penalty kick in the 7-0 win against Trinidad and Tobago on Jan. 31, 2021.\n\nDefender Miles Robinson also scored his first international goal in Orlando in the 2021 match against Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThe 27-player training camp roster is comprised of 18 players who were on the 2022 FIFA World Cup roster.\n\n2022 FIFA World Cup veterans Cameron Carter-Vickers, Luca de la Torre and Sean Johnson are in camp for the first time in 2024. Carter-Vickers and de la Torre appeared as second half substitutions against Colombia.\n\nShould they both appear against Brazil, Malik and Timmy Tillman would become the ninth set of brothers to play for the USMNT in the same match, and the first since Ken and Steve Snow against Costa Rica on June 14, 1988. The Tillmans became the 10th set of brothers to appear for the USMNT upon Timmy’s debut this past January against Slovenia. Malik came on as a second half substitution against Colombia on Saturday.\n\nUSA-BRAZIL NOTES\n\nThe U.S. has recorded a 1-18-0 mark against Brazil all-time.\n\nThe USMNT enter the contest with an 11-game losing streak against their South American foes, which dates back 26 years to 1998.\n\nIn their most recent encounter, Brazil defeated the U.S. 2-0 in an international friendly at MetLife Stadium on Sept. 7, 2018. Roberto Firmino (11th minute) and Neymar (44th minute penalty) were the goal scorers.\n\nFive players have appeared against Brazil: Tim Ream (Sept. 8, 2015); Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson, Tim Weah (Sept. 7, 2018).\n\nDefenders Danilo, the Brazil captain, and Bremer are teammates of Weston McKennie and Tim Weah at Juventus (Italy).\n\nMidfielder Andreas Pereira is a teammate of U.S. defenders Tim Ream and Antonee Robinson on Fulham.\n\nBRAZIL OF LATE\n\nAfter beginning its qualifying run for the 2026 FIFA World Cup unbeaten at 2-0-1, Brazil then dropped three games in a row, prompting the firing of manager Fernando Diniz in early January of this year.\n\nIn new head coach Dorival Junior's first game in charge against England at Wembley Stadium, on March 23, 2024, the Brazilians took home a 1-0 win on 17-year-old Endrick's 80th-minute goal. Three days later in Madrid, a back-and-forth contest with Spain ended with a Lucas Paqueta equalizer six minutes into stoppage time that earned the visitors a 3-3 come-from-behind draw.\n\nMost recently, Brazil defeated Mexico 3-2 this past weekend in a friendly in College Station, Texas. The South American side grabbed a two-goal advantage on goals by Andreas Pereira (fifth minute), his first international tally, and Martinelli (54th minute) before Mexico stormed back. Julian Quinones sliced the lead in half in the 73rd minute, and Guillermo Martinez knotted it up at 2-2 two minutes into injury time. That set up more late heroics, as Endrick netted the game-winner six minutes into added time.\n\nBrazil boasts some of the best attacking talent in all of world soccer, led by the Real Madrid pair of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo who recently won the 2024 UEFA Champions League title.\n\nAt the other end of the field, defenders Lucas Beraldo and Marquinhos captured the French Ligue 1 championship with Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nAT THE HELM\n\nDorival Júnior took over the coaching reins on Jan. 5 after Fernando Diniz was let go due to lackluster results in 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying.\n\nKnown as Junior during his playing days, Dorival Júnior enjoyed a 17-year career as a defensive midfielder for 13 clubs. His longest stints were with Palmeiras and Juventude in Brazilian Serie A. Junior never played with the National Team.\n\nIn a coaching career that began in 2002, Júnior has directed several important high-level teams in Brazil, including Sporting Recife, Coritiba, Vasco da Gama, Flamengo, Santos, Palmeiras, and Sao Paulo, among many others.\n\nJúnior, 62, has coached Brazil three times so far en route to a 2-0-1 record, with all of those matches having taken place on the road.\n\nBRAZIL ROSTER BY POSITION (CLUB; CAPS/GOALS)\n\nGOALKEEPERS (3): Bento (Athletico Paranaense; 2/0), Rafael (Sao Paulo; 0/0), Alisson (Liverpool/ENG; 64/0)\n\nDEFENDERS (9): Danilo (Juventus/ITA; 56/1), Yan Couto (Girona/ESP; 4/0), Guilherme Arana (Atletico Mineiro; 7/0), Wendell (Porto/POR; 2/0), Lucas Beraldo (Paris Saint-Germain/FRA; 2/0), Eder Militao (Real Madrid/ESP; 31/2), Gabriel Magalhaes (Arsenal/ENG; 6/1), Marquinhos (Paris Saint-Germain/FRA; 84/7), Bremer (Juventus/ITA; 5/0)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (7): Andreas Pereira (Fulham/ENG; 4/1), Joao Gomes (Wolverhampton/ENG; 3/0), Bruno Guimaraes (Newcastle/ENG; 21/1), Douglas Luiz (Aston Villa/ENG; 14/0), Lucas Paqueta (West Ham/ENG; 45/10), Ederson (Atalanta/ITA; 1/0); Pepe (Porto/POR; 2/0)"
