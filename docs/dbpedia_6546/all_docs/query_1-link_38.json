        "text": "How to get into football\n\nBBC Sport\n\nThe beautiful game. The national game. The world game.\n\nFootball is a phenomenon. Hundreds of millions of people across the globe live and breathe it, playing it with their friends and watching their heroes.\n\nBut don't be content to just watch it. Lace up your boots and get your foot on the ball to take part in perhaps the most easily accessible sport there is.\n\nFootball gives you an all-round workout. Players run, kick, dodge, sprint and jump, and constantly twisting and turning your body increases endurance, promotes agility and develops physical co-ordination.\n\nFootball also promotes teamwork on and off the pitch, as many teams socialise together.\n\nIf you don't fancy getting muddy, you could try five-a-side. Played on a smaller pitch, it's a good way to make sure you get on the ball more often - and run less! Click here to find out where you can play in England.\n\nFutsal is similar to five-a-side, only played with a smaller, heavier ball. It places greater emphasis on individual skill and ball control, and is popular in both Brazil and Mediterranean Europe.\n\nStruggle to get the joints moving? Walking Football could be the answer. Check it out here, and here.\n\nIf you're more interested in stepovers than Sunday league, then freestyle could be for you. The video above will show you what's possible at the very top, but to get started click here.\n\nIf you're worried about your weight - no problem! Sign up for the Man v Fat, program to help you shed those pounds and make some mates at the same time.\n\nFor more ways to get involved, including disability football and coaching, head over here."
