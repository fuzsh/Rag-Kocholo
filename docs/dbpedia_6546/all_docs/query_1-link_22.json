Dear Football Friends, On behalf of the Royal Belgian Football Association, I am very proud and honored to welcome you at this qualifying round for the UEFA European Championship Under-19 2017. Tournaments such as this give young players the opportunity to develop on international level, which will allow the participating players to gain a wealth of experience. We have been in charge of different qualifying rounds and elite rounds in the past, achieving great results. I am sure we will have another fantastic tournament ahead of us, here in the Province of Limburg. Every tournament needs a motivated delegation, performing on a high level. I can also count on all these persons. Nothing would have been possible without the fantastic effort of my organizational committee and our fantastic volunteers, so I would like to thank all of them. A special word also to the clubs of Patro Maasmechelen, Thes Sport Tessenderlo and the stadium of Beringen, for their hospitality and good conditions. To the clubs FC Veldwezelt, Spouwen- Mopertingen, KRC Genk and the hotels ‘Eurotel’ in Lanaken, ‘Stiemerheide’ and ‘M-hotel’ in Genk, I would also like to say thank you, for your kindness and warm welcome. There is no tournament without any teams, so I would like to welcome the Finnish, Kazakh and Russian team to our country, such as our referees and UEFA officials. We are sure that you will enjoy your stay in our country. The best of luck to everyone, and may the best team win ! Gilbert Timmermans Member of the Executive Committee of the Royal Belgian FA Tournament Director\n\n4.

TOURNAMENT REGULATIONS The UEFA European Under-19 Championship consists of three distinct stages: the qualifying round, the elite round and the final tournament. Qualifying round The qualifying round, played in autumn, is made up of 13 groups of four teams playing in one-venue mini-tournaments. The top two from each progress alongside the third-placed team with the best record against the top pair in their group. Elite round In the elite round, played in the spring, those 27 qualifiers join the top seed, given a bye, in seven mini-tournament groups of four. The group winners then join the hosts in the finals. Final tournament The seven qualifiers plus the hosts are split into two groups of four who play each other once, with the top two progressing to the semi-finals. The winners of those ties contest the final. Further details, including the criteria for separating teams that finish level on points in a group, or after extra time in a match, can be found on UEFA.com.\n\n6. HISTORY The UEFA European Under-19 Championship is the successor to the FIFA junior tournament, which began in 1948 as a U18 event and was taken over by UEFA seven years later. This International Youth Tournament was played in a number of different formats in the first 32 years of its existence, with England enjoying success on eight occasions while the Soviet Union triumphed in the competition four times and Bulgaria three. In 1980, the tournament was changed to the UEFA European Under-18 Championship, reflecting one of UEFA's main priorities, which is to promote youth football and to encourage the development of young footballers. The inaugural European U18 Championship was held in 1980/81, before the competition was changed to a U19 event ahead of the 2001/02 season because of changes in player eligibility dates. France were the most successful team in the European U18 Championship, lifting the trophy on four separate occasions, with Portugal and the Soviet Union each prevailing twice. The early years of the U19 event were dominated by Spain, winners in four of the first six editions with Italy triumphing in 2003 and France victorious two year later. The competition has also marked the first significant successes of a number of future stars, with England's victorious 1993 team featuring the likes of Gary Neville, Sol Campbell and Paul Scholes, all of whom went on to win well over 50 caps for the senior team.. A significant number of other players have starred in their team's triumphs at U18 and U19 level before going on to senior glory, with the victorious French side of 1996 featuring Mikaël Silvestre, William Gallas, Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet two years before the latter two were involved in the FIFA World Cup success. Italian trio Gianluigi Buffon, Francesco Totti and Andrea Pirlo, the Republic of Ireland's record goalscorer Robbie Keane and Spain's Fernando Torres, David Silva, Sergio Ramos and Gerard Piqué are just a few of the players who have figured in U18 and U19 finals in recent years.\n\n7.
