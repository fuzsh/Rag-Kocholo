        "text": "The European club season concludes on June 10 with the UEFA Champions League final between Manchester City and Inter Milan.\n\nLast year's showpiece between Real Madrid and Liverpool was staged at the Stade de France â€” the national stadium of France, situated just north of the capital Paris in the suburb of Saint-Denis.\n\nThere has been some shuffling of final venues by European governing body UEFA in recent years between the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. There was also speculation of a late change in 2023 due to political unrest.\n\nHowever, the date and venue for the 2023 final have been set and The Sporting News brings you all the details below.\n\nMORE: Teams qualified for the 2022-23 Champions League\n\nWhere is the UEFA Champions League final in 2023?\n\nThe 2023 UEFA Champions League final will be played at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey which seats nearly 77,000.\n\nThe game will bring to a climax the 68th edition of Europe's premier club tournament, and the 31st since the rebranding of the competition as the Champions League after being known for decades as the European Cup.\n\nIt will also be the second time the stadium has hosted the Champions League final, with the venue staging Liverpool's thrilling comeback and eventual penalty shootout win following a 3-3 draw against Italian giants Milan in 2005.\n\nThe 2023 final was initially scheduled for Wembley Stadium in London, England, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced a reshuffling of hosts for the matches in recent years.\n\nAtaturk Olympic Stadium, which opened in 2002, was originally scheduled to host the 2021 Champions League final, but two weeks before the final, it was moved to Porto's Estadio do Dragao because of COVID-19 health and safety matters.\n\nThe change had a domino effect, with the tournament final hosts for the following years all pushed back as a result.\n\nWhen is the UEFA Champions League final in 2023?\n\nThe 2023 UEFA Champions League final is on June 10, 2023 at Turkey's Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul.\n\nThe fixture for the final is outside the typical May window due to shifts in the football calendar caused by the stoppage to allow the 2022 FIFA World Cup to take place for the first time in November and December.\n\nThe game is set to kick off at 10 p.m. local time, which is 3 p.m. ET in the USA/Canada and 8 p.m. in the UK. If extra time and penalties are required, it would stretch the match deep into the wee hours of the night in Istanbul.\n\nMORE: Champions League prize money breakdown\n\nWhere are future Champions League finals being held?\n\nUEFA has already agreed the host cities for the next two editions of the Champions League final beyond 2023.\n\nThe 2022 Champions League final was originally scheduled for Saint Petersburg in Russia but was moved to France following the war in Ukraine.\n\nMatch Host 2023 UEFA Champions League final Ataturk Olympic Stadium (Istanbul, Turkey) 2024 UEFA Champions League final Wembley Stadium (London, England) 2025 UEFA Champions League final Allianz Arena (Munich, Germany)\n\nWhere have past Champions League finals been held?\n\nThe final has only ever been held once before in Turkey and the 2023 event will be the return trip for one of the biggest sporting events in the world.\n\nHere we look at the venues that have hosted the final in the past, including dating back to the period where the competition was known as the European Cup.\n\nMORE: Which cities have hosted the most Champions League finals?"
