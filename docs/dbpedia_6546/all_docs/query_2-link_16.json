        "text": "Well here I go again with another journey ‘Around The Football World’ – I really enjoyed writing my first installment of this series and I hope that those of you that read it found the piece both informative and enjoyable.\n\nMy Wife Jodie and Son Alfie helped me with the draw last night (16th June) at our South Shropshire HQ. This time, instead of picking one country from every Football Confederation, we put all of the countries into one pot and drew out six countries for me to write about – some interesting countries were drawn out as follows, in alphabetical order.\n\nALBANIA\n\n“The Flag of Albania” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nBULGARIA\n\n“The Flag of Bulgaria” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nIVORY COAST\n\n“The Flag of Ivory Coast” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nNAMIBIA\n\n“The Flag of Namibia” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nNETHERLANDS\n\n“The Flag of Netherlands” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nUNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS\n\n“The Flag of United States Virgin Islands” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nI really cannot wait to get into researching and writing about these countries and finding out about the football that is played in each country – without further ado lets start Part 2 of this series and travel to Albania from my end point of Part 1 in this series – Tuvalu, a distance of 9,702 miles!\n\nALBANIA\n\nAlbania is a country that is located in Southern Europe and on the Western section of the Balakan Peninsula. The country is bordered by Montenegro and Kosovo to the North, North Macedonia to the East and Greece to the South.\n\nNational Anthem – Himni i Flamurit (Hymn of the Flag)\n\nNational Motto – Ti Shqiperi me jep nder, me jep emrin shqipetar (You Albania, you give me honour, you give me the name Albanian)\n\nCapital City – Tirana\n\n“Tirana” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nLargest City – Tirana\n\nCountry Population – 2,876,591\n\nOfficial Language – Albanian\n\nOther Recognised Languages – Greek, Aromanian and Macedonian\n\nGovernment – Unitary Parliamentary Constitutional Republic\n\nPresident – Ilir Meta: Since July 2017\n\nPrime Minister – Edi Rama: Since September 2013\n\nCurrency – Lek (All)\n\nMost Popular Sport – Football\n\nFOOTBALL IN ALBANIA\n\nThe game of Football has been played in Albania for over 100 years and was introduced to the country by a priest of English and Maltese descent in 1908, his name – Gut Ruter. The first football club to be founded in Albania was, Indipendenca from Shkoder in 1912. The first ever recorded and conventional game of football to take place in Albania was in October 2013 between Indipendenca and a team representing the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The game resulted in a 2-1 defeat for the Albanian club, their only goal socred by the club’s founding Father – Paloke Nika.\n\nConfederation – UEFA (Europe)\n\nGoverning Body – Albanian Football Association\n\nHeadquarters – Tirana\n\nPresident of Association – Armand Duka\n\nLeague System – Four Tiers with Promotion and Relegation\n\nTop Division – The Albanian Superliga\n\nDomestic Cups – Albanian Cup\n\nAlbanian Supercup\n\nThe Albanian Football Association was founded 89 years ago on, 6th June 1930. The association gained affiliation to FIFA in 1932 and with UEFA in 1954. The association have their main headquarters in the Capitaly City of Tirana with regional offices in Durres and Shkoder. The current President of the Albanian Football Association, Armand Duka has been at the helm of the association since 2002.\n\nThe National Football Championship of Albania (Now the Albanian Superliga) was first held in 1930 and was won by KF Tirana. This was the first of three league titles in a row, KF Tirana are the most successful club in Albanian Football history with 51 recognised Albanian League and Cup titles to their name. KF Tirana play at the 9,500 capacity Selman Stermasi Stadium, pictured as follows:\n\n“The Selman Stermasi Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe 2018/2019 Albanian Superliga was dominated by FK Partizani – the Tirana based club won their 16th Albanian top flight league title by 13 points from runners-up FK Kukesi. By winning the title FK Partizani will enter next seasons UEFA Champions League at the first qualifying stage. FK Kukesi will enter next seasons UEFA Europa League first qualifying round as do KF Teuta Durres by virtue of their 3rd place league final position. The 9th place team in the Albanian Superliga, KS Kastrioi were relegated to the Albanian 1st Division – Group A. FC Kamza were expelled by the Albanian Football Association for incidents that occurred during their league game against KF Laci in March 2019 – their expulsion from the league means that they will compete in the Albanian 2nd division for the 2019/2020 season.\n\nThe Albanian Cup is the most important ‘knockout’ cup competition in Albanian football. The first edition of the competition was held in 1939, back then it was known as the Kings Cup, the first team to win the Kings Cup were – KF Tirana. Due to the outbreak of World War II the competition was suspended for several years and started again in 1948 it was then known as the Republic Cup. The winners of the 1948 competition were the winners of this seasons Albanian Superliga – FK Partizani. The name of the competition remained as the Republic Cup until 1991 when it was renamed for a third time and to what it is known as today – The Albanian Cup.\n\nGoing into the 2018/2019 Albanian Cup, KF Skenderbeu Korce were the defending champions having beaten Laci 1-0 in front of 3,000 spectators at the home of Albanian 1st Division Group B club, KF Elbasani – The 12,800 Capacity, Elbasen Arena.\n\n“The Elbasen Arena” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe 2018/2019 Albanian Cup consisted of 34 teams with a preliminary round, 1st Round, 2nd Round, Quarter Finals, Semi Finals and The Final. All of the games apart from the preliminary round and the Final were contested over two home and away legs. The final saw FK Kukesi take on KF Tirana at The Elbasen Arena, FK Kukesi lifted the trophy by beating KF Tirana by 2 goals to 1.\n\nThe Albanian Supercup is relatively new in Albanian Football when compared to the League and Albanian Cup, with it being played for in 1989 for the first time. The game is a one-off match usually played at the start of the season between the previous season’s Superliga winners and Albanian Cup winners. The first winners of the Albanian Supercup were Dinamo Tirana with the most winners of the Supercup, KF Skenderbeu Korce in 2018.\n\nThat concludes my brief introduction into domestic football in Albania, I will now take a look at the Albanian Men’s National Football Team.\n\nALBANIAN MEN’S NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM\n\nNational Stadium – Several stadiums used, the last stadium used for an international fixture was the Elbasen Arena on 11th June 2019.\n\nElbasen Arena Capacity – 12,800\n\nHead Coach – Edoardo Reja\n\n“Edoardo Reja” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nCaptain – Mergim Mavraj\n\nMost Caps – Lorik Cana (92) 2003-2016\n\n“Lorik Cana” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nTop Scorer – Erjon Bogdani (18)\n\nFirst International – Unofficial: Albania 5-0 Montenegro: 22nd August 1946\n\nOfficial: Albania 2-3 Yugoslavia: 7th October 1946\n\nBiggest Win – Albania 6-1 Cyprus: 12th August 2009\n\nBiggest Defeat – Hungary 12-0 Albania: 24th September 1950\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – 0\n\nEuropean Championships Appearances – 1: Best Performance – Group Stage 2016\n\n2018/2019 UEFA Nations League – Division C: Group 1: 3rd Position\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking – (66)\n\nTOURNAMENT PERFORMANCES\n\nBefore 2016 when Albania competed in the 2016 European Championships, going no further than the group stages, their best international performance was when they won the now defunct Balkans Cup in 1946 and the also now defunct Malta International Tournament in 2000. Before I talk about those two tournament wins I would like to share a very noteworthy result in Albanian football history.\n\nIn the 1968 European Championship Qualifiers, Albania held the mighty West Germany National team to a 0-0 draw. This draw meant that West Germany did not qualify for the 1968 European Championship held in Italy.\n\nThe 1946 Balkans Cup was the 8th edition of the competition, Albania lined up against three other teams, namely Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania. The competition was run as a round robin group with each team playing three games each. Albania were the host nation but started the tournament with a 2-3 defeat against Yugoslavia. Despite this setback they managed to win their next two games, 3-1 against Bulgaria and 1-0 against Romania. These results were just enough for them to win the tournament on goal difference with Yugoslavia in 2nd place, Romania 3rd and Bulgaria in 4th.\n\nThe Malta International Tournament started in 1986 and ran until 2008. The 2000 edition of the tournament saw Albania take on Malta, Andorra and Azerbaijan in a round robin group format. Albania were the dominent team throughout the tournament winning all three games and not conceding a goal in the process to lift the trophy, five points clear of runners-up Malta.\n\nALBANIAN PLAYERS\n\nAs mentioned in the list and pictured above, Lorik Cana holds the record for the most international caps for Albania. Cana won his first cap on 11th June 2003 at the age of 19, coming on as a substitute in the 2-3 defeat against Switzerland in a Euro 2004 Qualifying match. His last appearance for his country came as a substitute in Albania’s victory against Romania in Euro 2016.\n\nAlbania’s Top international Goal Scorer, Erjon Bogdani is now the manager of Albania’s under-19 team. Bogdani started his club career with FK Partizani in Albania and went onto play for several other clubs all over Europe, some of which included the likes of, Reginna and Chievo in Italy, Genclerbirligi S.K. in Turkey and NK Zagreb in Croatia.\n\nIn November 2003 to help with the celebrations of UEFA’s Jubilee, each country in UEFA selected a player who they considered to be their Golden Player of the past 50 years. The Albanian Football Association chose Panajot Pano as their Golden Player. Pano started his early playing days as a Goalkeeper for KF Tirana but soon reverted to a Goal Scoring Striker. In 1960 he joined FK Partizani and remained with the club until 1975, scoring 136 goals in 210 league games for the them. He won many honours with FK Partizani which included 4 Albanian Superliga Championships and 6 Albanian Cups. The Golden Player of Albania won 28 caps scoring 4 goals for his country.\n\n“Panajot Pano” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nWOMEN’S FOOTBALL IN ALBANIA\n\nThe Albanian National Football Championship for Women, the equivalent of the men’s Superliga is the highest level of domestic women’s football in the country.\n\nFootball was first played by women in Albania as recently as 2007 when the first ever national tournament was held in the Albanian coastal town of Sarande. The tournament was designed as a promotional event for the women’s game in the country. This was very much an amateur tournament with the teams comprising of players from Tirana, Shkodra, Korca and Rubik. The following two years after this initial event saw several other tournaments held, again these were also designed to help to promote women’s football in Albania.\n\nJanuary 2009 saw the first ever officially organised National Championship for Albanian women’s football. The tournament comprised of 8 teams with the format being a ‘knockout’ style cup competition. The eventual winners were Tirana AS who beat Juban Danja 4-0 in the final. Juban Danja are the oldest women’s Football Club in the country having been founded in 2005.\n\nThe 2018/2019 Albanian Women’s National Championship was the 10th time that the competition had been held. The championship was made up of 12 teams that played in a covential league format to decide the winners. KF Vllaznia Shkoder completely dominated the League Season, winning every game they played to lift their 6th consecutive Albanian League Title and by do so ensuring qualification for the 2019/2020 UEFA Women’s Champions League.\n\nALBANIAN WOMEN’S NATIONAL TEAM\n\nThe national team was formed in 2011 with the team’s first international game coming on 5th May 2011 against North Macedonia. Albania won that inaugural fixture 1-0 in the Albanian City of Pogradec. They played North Macedonia later in the same year and recorded their biggest victory to date, a 4-1 away win. The biggest defeat that the Women’s team has suffered thus far is an 11-0 home loss against Norway in 2014. At the time of writing Albania’s Women have yet to qualify for a World Cup or European Championship. Their current FIFA ranking as of March 2019 is 77th.\n\nThat concludes Part 1 of ‘Around the Football World” #2 – we now travel 485 miles across Europe and into Bulgaria for Part 2.\n\nBULGARIA\n\nBulgaria is a country that is located in Southeast Europe bordered by Romania to the North, Serbia and North Macedonia to the West and Greece and Turkey to the South.

The Swiss was in the country teaching and was appointed by the Varna Boy’s High School in May 1894. Georges de Regibus had brought his own football with him from Switzerland and in effect the first game of Football that was played in Bulgaria was at the Varna Boy’s High School between two teams of boys from the school selected by de Regibus.\n\nThe oldest active football club in Bulgaria is PFC Botev Plovdiv who were founded 107 years ago on 11th March 1912.\n\nConfederation – UEFA (Europe)\n\nGoverning Body – Bulgarian Football Union\n\nUnion Headquarters – Sofia\n\nPresident – Borislav Mikhailov\n\nLeague System – 5 Tiers with promotion and relegation\n\nTop Division – The First Professional Football League\n\nDomestic Cup Competitions – Bulgarian Cup\n\nBulgarian Supercup\n\nAFL Cup (For amateur football in Bulgaria)\n\nThe Bulgarian Football Union was founded in 1923 becoming a member of FIFA in 1924 and later a member of UEFA in 1954.\n\nThe Bulgarian League System is made up of four tiers, The First Professional League is the top league in the country followed by – The Second Professional League, The Third Amateur League (four regional groups – Northwest, Northeast, Southeast and Southwest) and the Bulgarian Regional Amateur Football Groups covering tiers four and five of Bulgarian football.\n\nThe first Bulgarian Football Championship was created in 1924, at that time the Championships were played as a Cup Knockout format. The competing teams for that first National Championship were – PFC Cherno More Varna, PFC Levski Sofia, FC Chernomorets Burgas, Pobeda Plovdiv, FC Minyor Pernik and POFC Botev Vratsa. The first semi-final ended with Pobeda Plovdiv beating POFC Botev Vratsa 5-0 with Plovdiv progressing to the final…………………………… or so they thought! The second semi-final between PFC Levski Sofia v PFC Cherno More Varna ended 0-0 with no extra-time possible due to the fading light. The match was ordered to be replayed the following day but Varna refused to travel to Sofia to fulfill the fixture. Much negotiating took place between the powers that be but a date could not be found and agreed upon by all parties for the game to take place, this resulted in the 1924 Bulgarian Championship to be abandoned, meaning their was no winner of the first ever Bulgarian Championship.\n\nThe top team in Bulgaria in terms of League Championship triumph’s are PFC CSKA Sofia. The club have won the title on 31 occasions and finished as runners-up 25 times. Their first title came in 1948 with their most recent title coming in 2008. CSKA Sofia play at the 22,995 capacity Balgarska Armia Stadium, pictured below.\n\n“The Balgarska Armia Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe 2018/2019 Bulgarain First Professional League was the 95th staging of the top division in Bulgaria. Fourteen clubs began the regular season playing a total of 26 games each. The top six clubs progressed to the Championship Round, those six clubs were as follows in their League finishing positions:\n\n1st PFC Ludogorets Razgrad (62 Pts)\n\n2nd PFC CSKA Sofia (57 Pts)\n\n3rd PFC Levski Sofia (54 Pts)\n\n4th PFC Botev Plovdiz (45 Pts)\n\n5th PFC Cherno More Varna (42 Pts)\n\n6th PFC Beroe Stara Zagora (42 Pts)\n\nThe clubs that finished from 7th to 14th position went into the Relegation Round. In both the Championship and Relegation rounds, points and goals were carried over from the regular season.\n\nCSKA Sofia managed to claw back some of the deficit from the regular season on Ludogorets but not quite enough as Ludogorets hung on and won the Bulgarian First Professional League by a solitary point. This was Ludogorets 8th title triumph in their history, all coming in this decade! Ludogorets play at the impressive 10,500 capacity Ludogorets Arena, pictured below.\n\n“The Ludogorets Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nLets now take a look at the most important cup competition in Bulgaria – The Bulgarian Cup.\n\nPFC Levski Sofia are the club who have appeared in the most Bulgarian Cup Finals, 37 to date. They hold the record for the most cup final wins (25) their first Bulgarian Cup Final victory coming in 1942 with their most recent success coming in 2007 when they beat PCF Litex lovech 1-0 in the final played at the home of PFC Beroe Stara Zagora, The Beroe Stadium.\n\n“The Beroe Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe 2018/2019 Bulgarian Cup saw 32 teams entering the competition at the First Round stage. This included the 14 clubs in The First Professional League, the 15 non-reserve clubs in The Second Professional League and 3 clubs that had won regional competitions.\n\nHaving looked at the results I noted that 2nd League Club, PFC Septemvri Sofia had a great run in the Bulgarian Cup, going all the way to the semi-finals. Unfortunately for them they came up against PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv, the First League club winning the semi-final 4-0 on aggregate. The other semi-final was a much tighter encounter, this all First League tie saw PFC Botev Plovdiv edging out CSKA Sofia 6-5 on aggregate. All this meant that the final would see PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv take on PFC Botev Plovdiv, the first ever Plovdiv Derby in the Bulgarian Cup Final. The final took place at the Vasil Levski National Stadium in Sofia, in front of a 20,500 crowd, Lokomotive Plovdiv were victorious beating their Plovdiv neighbours 1-0 and by doing so lifted their first Bulgarian Cup in their entire history.\n\n“The Vasil Levski National Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nBulgaria’s other professional cup is the Bulgarian Supercup – this match see’s the winner of the First Professional League take on the winners of The Bulgarian Cup. The match usually takes place the weekend before the start of the Bulgarian Football Season.\n\nThe first Bulgarian Supercup Final took place in 1989 and was won by CSKA Sofia by beating the now defunct FC Chernomorets Burgas 1-0, thanks to a goal by the great Hristo Stoichkov.\n\nThe 2018 final saw League Winners PFC Ludogorets Razgrad take on Bulgarian Cup winners PFC Slavia Sofia. Ludogorets won the game 1-0 thanks to a goal from the Romanian International, Claudiu Keseru.\n\nBulgaria’s Amateur Cup – The Cup of Bulgarian Amateur Football was established by the Bulgarian Football Union in 1994. The competiton is open to all officially registered amateur clubs in Bulgaraia. The 2019 final saw FC Balkan Botevgrad of the Southwest 3rd League take on FC Suvorovo of the Northeast 3rd League. Balkan Botevgrad won the final 3-1 played at the Ivalyo Stadium, a multi use stadium in the city of Veliko Tarnovo.\n\n“The Ivaylo Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nBULGARIA MEN’S NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM\n\nNational Stadium – Vasil Levski National Stadium: 44,000 Capacity\n\nHead Coach – Krasimir Balakov: Since 2019\n\n“Krasimir Balakov” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nCaptain – Ivelin Popov\n\nMost Caps – Stiliyan Petrov (105)\n\nTop Scorer – Dimitar Berbatov (48)\n\nHristo Bonev (48)\n\nFirst International – Bulgaria 0-0 Austria: 21st May 1924\n\nBiggest Win – Bulgaria 10-0 Ghana: 14th October 1968\n\nBiggest Defeat – Bulgaria 1-8 Spain: 22nd August 1933\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – (7) Best Result: Semi-Finals in USA 1994\n\nEuropean Championship Appearances – (3) Best Result: Quarter Finals in 1968 Italy\n\n2018/2019 UEFA Nations League – League C, Group 3: 2nd\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking – (57) June 2019\n\nTOURNAMENT PERFORMANCES\n\nWithout any doubt the best achievment by the Bulgarian Men’s team was when they reached the semi-finals of the 1994 World Cup in USA. On a personal note I have great memories of the 1994 World Cup and remember Bulgaria’s superb Quarter Finals victory against Germany by 2 goals to 1 vividly. Lothar Matthaus opened the scoring for Germany early into the 2nd half but goals by Hristo Stoichkov on 75 minutes and a superb header by Yordan Letchkov three minutes later gave Bulgaria a famous win. Bulgaria played Italy in the semi-final and were edged out of the tournament by 2 goals to 1.\n\nAs well as reaching the Quarter Finals of the 1968 European Championships in Italy, that same year, Bulgaria reached the Final of the 1968 Mexico Olympics. In thE Final they came up against Hungary, Bulgaria took the lead on 22 minutes but Hungary powered back and won the final 4-1.\n\nBulgaria have won the now defunct Balkans Cup on four occasions, the first of which came in 1931.\n\nPLAYERS\n\n“Hristo Stoichkov” [Image:Pinterest]\n\nHristo Stoichkov is not only one of the greatest Bulgarian footballers of all time but one of the greatest players that the World has ever seen. I am lucky enough to remember seeing him play and in my opinion Stoichkov must be right up there in the top 10-20 players of all time. Even the great Pele himself named Stoichkov in the FIFA 100 List of the greatest players of all time. Predominantly a left-footed player, Stoichkov was deceptively quick across the ground and possessed a superb football brain. He played 83 times for his country, scoring 37 goals in the process. Stoichkov began his club career with the Bulgarian Club FC Hebros who now play in the Bulgarian 4th tier.\n\n“FC Hebros Logo” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nIn 1984 Stoichkov joined CSKA Sofia and then moved to Barcelona where he was a member of the Johan Cruff “Barcelona Dream Team” spending five great seasons with the club. Hristo Stoichkov ended his career in 2003 whilst playing for D.C. United in the USA.\n\nWOMEN’S FOOTBALL IN BULGARIA\n\nBulgaria has one Women’s National League without any relegation, the league was founded in 1985/1986 with the first winners of the competition being Akademik (Sofia) The top team in Bulgarian Women’s Football is FC NSA Sofia with 14 league titles to date.

The stadium is based in Marcory, a suburb of Abidjan.\n\n“Stade Robert Champroux” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe top team in Ivorian football during the 1970’s were without a doubt, ASEC Mimosas. The club’s first Ligue 1 triumph came in 1963, winning 5 more titles in the 1970’s including four in a row – 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975. In 1980 ASEC Mimosas lifted their 7th Ligue 1 title then had to wait until 1990 for their 8th title, what followed was another period of dominence with 6 Ligue 1 titles in a row (including the title in 1990) the club are at the time of writing the top team in the Ivory Coast in term of Ligue 1 titles with 26 to their name. ASEC Mimosas have also tasted success in International Club competitions.

ASEC Mimosas did this with flying colours, winning 4 games, drawing 1 and only suffering 1 loss. This saw the club finish on 13 points, 3 points clear of nearest group challengers, Manning Rangers.\n\nIn the final they come up against Dynamos FC from Zimbabwe, the first leg in Zimbabwe, played at The National Sports Stadium in Harare ended as a 0-0 stalemate. The return leg was played at the home of ASEC Mimosas, The Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny, this multi-use stadium is also the home of the Ivory Coast National Football Team. Mimosas took the win by 4 goals to 2 on the day to win the 1998 CAF Champions League 4-2 on aggregate.\n\n“The Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nOther International Club Competitions that ASEC Mimosas have won include the following:\n\nThe 1999 CAF Super Cup (1)\n\nThe 1990 West African Club Championship (1)\n\nThe 2001 Peace Cup (1)\n\nASEC Mimosas have two affiliations in World Football, one with Charlton Athletic in England and the other with the West African Football Acadamy Club in Ghana.\n\nAnother of the top teams in Ivorian football is, Africa Sports d’Abidjan – the club to date have won 17 Ligue 1 titles. Their first title coming in 1967 with their most recent success coming in 2011. Africa Sports have also won the African Cup Winners Cup on 2 occasions – their first triumph in the compition was in 1992 when they beat Vital’O FC from Burundi 5-1 on aggregate. In 1999 they secured a brace of African Cup Winners Cup titles by beating Club Africain from Tunisia. This was a much tighter final than their win in 1992, African Sports came out on top by an aggregate score of 2-1, winning their home leg 1-0 and securing a 1-1 draw in Tunisia. Other International Club Competitons wins for the club are as follows:\n\nThe 1992 CAF Super Cup (1)\n\nThe West African Club Championship (3) 1985, 1986 and 1991\n\nThe 1958 French West African Cup (1)\n\nLets now take a look at the domestic club cup scene in The Ivory Coast.\n\nThe Cup de Cote d’Ivoire is the Premier Cup Competition in the country.

The team were in Group G alongside Brazil, Portugal and North Korea, they finished in 3rd place in the group just one point behind 2nd placed Portugal who qualified for the next stage along with Brazil.\n\nThe team have had great success in the Africa Cup of Nations over the years. They first qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations in 1965 in Tunisa, finishing 3rd out of 6 teams. The Ivorians beat Senegal 1-0 in the 3rd/4th place play-off match to secure 3rd position. They came 3rd again in the 1968 tournament which was held in Ethiopia. This tournament featured 8 teams, Ivory Coast secured 3rd place with a 1-0 win over the host nation in the 3rd/4th place play-off match at the Addis Abada Stadium. The Ivory Coast hosted the 1984 tournament but failed to progress past the group stages. This despite beating Togo 3-0 in their opening game, they went onto suffer defeats too Egypt and Cameroon respectively to leave them in 3rd place in the table, only the top 2 progressing to the semi-finals. Yet another 3rd place was secured in the 1986 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. This time securing 3rd place by beating Morocco 3-2 in the play-off game at the impressive Cairo International Stadium.\n\n“The Cairo International Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe 1992 tournament in Senegal saw 12 teams in the final stages of the Africa Cup of Nations for the first ever time. The teams were seperated into 4 groups of 3, Ivory Coast lined up against Congo and Algeria in Group C. The Ivorians beat Algeria 3-0 in their opening group game thanks to goals from Abdoulaye Traore, Youssouf Falikou Fofana and Joel Tiehi. In their second game against Congo they drew 0-0, these two results meant that they finished top of the group and qualified for the Quarter Finals. Ivory Coast came up against Zambia in the last 8 and won a very tight game 1-0 after extra time, the goal coming from Donald-Oliver Sie. Into the semi-finals they went, their opponents in the last 4 were Cameroon. The game finished goalless after extra time but the Ivory Coast held their nerve to win the Penalty Shootout 3-1 and marched into the final. If the semi-final was dramatic then I am not sure what word can be described for the final against Ghana. Again the game finished goalless after extra time, this time the Ivory Coast won an amazing penalty shootout by a score of 11-10 to lift the trophy in the final at the Stade Leopold Sedar Senghor in Dakar. History was made in the final, not only with Ivory Coast winning the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in their history, the penalty shootout will also go down in World Football history as it was the first time that every player on the pitch took a penalty! Quite astonishing! The Stade Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium where history was made in 1992 is shown below:\n\n“The Stade Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe reigning Champions went to the 1994 tournament in Tunisia looking to defend their crown. They made a very good attempt but could only manage a 3rd place finish.\n\nThe Ivorians went close to winning a second Africa Cup of Nations in 2012 which was jointly hosted by Equitorial Guinea and Gabon. The team went all the way to the final only to lose 8-7 on penalties too Zambia.\n\nThe 2015 tournament was hosted by Equitorial Guinea and featured 20 teams. The Ivory Coast claimed their second African Cup of Nations by beating Ghana 9-8 on penalties in the final.\n\nPLAYERS\n\nIn relatively recent times, The Ivory Coast have produced several top players who have played for some of the best teams in Europe. Some of these players include the likes of Yaya Toure, Kolo Toure and Didier Drogba. I enjoyed watching all of these players during their time in the England Premier League.\n\nWOMEN’S FOOTBALL IN IVORY COAST\n\nThe Ivorian Women’s National team played their first international match recognised by FIFA in 1988 at a Women’s FIFA invitational tournament in China. That first game for the team against The Netherlands which ended in 0-3 defeat for them. The team recorded thier biggest ever win on 26th May 2012 when they beat Mozambique 7-0 in Abidjan. In 2015 they qualified for their first ever World Cup Finals, the tournament in Canada saw them placed in the same group as Germany, Norway and Thailand. The team finished bottom of the group without winning a game.\n\nThe Women’s National team has qualified for the Africa Women’s Championships on two occasions. The first time was in 2012 when they failed to go past the group stage. They qualified for the second time in 2014 for the finals held in Namibia. This tournament featured 8 teams, Ivory Coast got all the way to the semi-finals where they narrowly lost 2-1 to Cameroon after extra-time. They secured a 3rd place finish by beating South Africa 1-0 thanks to a late goal by Ida Guehai pictured below.\n\n“Ida Guehai” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe team is currently ranked 62nd in the World in the FIFA rankings.\n\nThat marks the halfway stage of this World Football Blog – for part 4 we will stay in Africa and travel 4,456 miles to Namibia.\n\nNAMIBIA\n\nNamibia is situated in Southern Africa, the Atlantic Ocean lies to the west of the country.

It was under the South West African name that a football association was founded in 1976. In 1990, South West Africa gained independence as the Republic of Namibia in March 1990. In the same year the Namibia Football Association was founded.\n\nFootball in Namibia can be traced back until at least 1911 with Historians suggesting that the best football team in the country were MTV Usakos. During this time there was no league structure only a cup tournament and friendly matches.

The stadium is named after the first president of Namibia – Sam Nujoma.\n\n“The Sam Nujoma Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe first winners of the top league in Namibia following the countries independence were Eleven Arrows FC in 1991. They claimed the title by finishing 3 points clear of their nearest challengers, African Stars FC. This was Eleven Arrows only League Championship in their history to date.\n\nIncluding Eleven Arrows title in 1991, the first 6 years of the Championship saw 6 different winners:\n\n1992: Ramblers FC\n\n1993: Chief Santos FC\n\n1994: African Stars FC\n\n1995: Black Africa Sports Club.\n\n1996: Tunacor Blue Waters FC\n\nThere was no Championship held in 1997, the following two championships were won by Black Africa Sports Club\n\nToday Black Africa Sports Club are the top team in Namibia with regards to the number of League Titles won, currently with 10 to their name. Their latest triumph coming in the 2018/2019 season, the club won the title comfortably by 10 points from their nearest challengers – African Stars FC.\n\nBlack Africa Sports Club were founded in 1964 and are based in the township of Katatura. Like the United African Tigers Club, they play their home games at the Sam Nujoma Stadium.\n\nThe Club progressed to the 1996 CAF Champions League First Round. In the Preliminary Round they came up against Township Rollers from Botswana and won the tie 5-2 on aggregate. In the first round they were drawn against Athletico Petroleos de Luanda of Angola and despite drawing the 2nd leg 1-1 they were defeated 3-1 on aggregate. Black Africa Sports Club also appeared in the Preliminary Round of the 2014 CAF Champions League but went no further as they were beaten 4-1 on aggregate by Kaizer Chiefs from South Africa.\n\nLets now take a look at the domestic cup scene in Namibia.\n\nThe Namibia FA Cup was first held in 1990, that inaugural final was contested between Black Africa Sports Club v Orlando Pirates Sports Club. The game finished 1-1 after extra-time with Black Africa Sports Club coming out on top 4-2 in the subsequent penalty shootout.\n\nAfrican Stars FC are the team with the most Namibia FA Cup Final victories to their name, currently with 5 wins. Their first coming in 2007 with their latest triumph as recently as 2018. In that 2018 final they defeated Unam 1-0 at the Sam Nujoma Stadium.\n\nOther clubs with more than one cup final victory to their name are:\n\nChief Santos: (4)\n\nUnited Africa Tigers (3)\n\nOrlando Sports Club (3)\n\nBlack Africa Sports Club (3)\n\nFC Civics Windhoek (2)\n\nTheir is in an interesting story to be told about FC Civics as to how they were founded. The club were founded in 1983 by a group of school pupils who were following an initiative to come up with meaningful activities during none school hours. The club based in Katutura were orignally named as Bethlehem Boys after a street named Bethlehem Street in the locality. Players from the local area played for the club and that has continued to today with the majority of the squad coming from Katutura.\n\nThe other cup in Namibia is the Namibia Super Cup and is contested between the winners of the Namibia FA Cup and the winners of the Namibia Premier League.\n\nNAMIBIA MEN’S NATIONAL TEAM\n\nNational Stadium – Independence Stadium: Capacity 25,000\n\nHead Coach – Ricardo Mannetti\n\nCaptain – Ronald Ketjijere\n\nTop Goalscorer – Rudolf Bester (13) Still active\n\n“Rudolf Bester” [Image:twitter]\n\nMost Caps – Johannes Hindjou (69)\n\nFirst Inernational – Southwest Africa 0-1 Angola: 16th May 1989\n\nBiggest Win – Namibia 8-2 Benin: 15th July 2000\n\nBiggest Defeat: Egypt 7-1 Namibia: 8th November 1996\n\nEgypt 8-2 Namibia: 13th July 2001\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – (0)\n\nAfrica Cup of Nations Appearances – (3 – including forthcoming 2019 tournament: Best Result to date: Group Stage: 1998, 2008\n\nCOSAFA Cup Appearances – (0)\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking – (113) June 2019.\n\nTOURNAMENT PERFORMANCES\n\nNamibia’s first international fixture as an independent nation came only two days after gaining independence (21st March 1990) The game on 23rd March saw them take on neighbouring Zimbabwe in Namibia, the visitors that day winning 5-1.\n\nNamibia had to wait until 1994 to gain their first victory as an independent nation. That historic day came on 1st July 1994 with a 1-0 away win against Botswana. Four years later they played their first game outside of Africa, losing 2-1 in France against Saudi Arabia.\n\nNamibia qualified for their first ever Africa Cup of Nations in 1998 which was held in Burkina Faso. They found themselves in Group C along with Ivory Coast, Angola and South Africa. Despite not progressing from the group they faired very well in this, their first ever Africa Cup of Nations, especially in their first two games. In their first game at the Stade General Aboubacar Sangoule Lamizana stadium, they took on Ivory Coast and went down to a narrow 4-3 defeat. Eliphas Shivute will go down in Namibian football history as their first goal scorer in the finals of the Africa Cup of Nations, scoring on 46 minutes against Ivory Coast. In their second group game Namibia played Angola and managed to get a point from the game following a 3-3 draw. In their final group game they lost 4-1 too South Africa.\n\n“The Stade General Aboubacar Sangoule Lamizana Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nIn 2008, Namibia qualified for their second Africa Cup of Nations. The 2008 tournament was held in Ghana, Namibia were drawn in the same group as Ghana, Guinea and Morocco. Unfortunately they lost their first group game heavily, going down 5-1 against Morocco. A second defeat followed against hosts, Ghana – final score 0-1. To their credit they battled out a 1-1 draw in their final game against Guinea to claim 1 point from their 3 group games.\n\nThis years Africa Cup of Nations is being held in Egypt (21st June – 19th July) with Namibia finding themselves in the same group as – Morocco, Ivory Coast and South Africa.\n\nPLAYERS\n\nThe Namibia squad that has been selected for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations is primarily made up of players playing for clubs in Namibia (8 players) and South Africa (8 players) Some other members of the squad also play their club football on the African Continent for clubs in the likes of Zambia, Ethiopia and Egypt. Two members of their squad play for clubs in Europe, namely Ryan Nyambe (Blackburn Rovers in England) and attacking midfielder, Manfred Starke ( FC Carl Zeiss Jena in Germany) Starke has played all of his club football in Germany, starting off with FC Hansa Rostock before joining FC Carl Zeiss Jena in 2015.\n\n“Manfred Starke” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nWOMEN’S FOOTBALL IN NAMIBIA\n\nThe Namibia Women’s Super League is the top level of the Women’s game in Namibia. In 2006 the game was played at a very informal level with no real structure. Later in the same year FIFA gave Namibia the right to host a Football Seminar for Countries in the Southeast of Africa to discuss a way forward for the Women’s game in the region. Following this a National Championship was founded, this consisted of regional league matches concluding with play-offs to decide the outcome of the Championship.\n\nIn 2011 the first Super League was established, FIFA helped with this by sponsoring the league and training equipment. The first winners of the Super League were the Jacquline Shipanga Acadamy FC.\n\nNAMIBIA WOMEN’S NATIONAL TEAM\n\nThe National Team played their first ever international fixture on 25th October 2003, the game against South Africa in Pretoria ended in a 13-0 defeat which remains their record defeat to this day. On 22nd August 2006 Namibia recorded their biggest ever win, 6-0 against Swaziland in a game played in Lusaka, Zambia.\n\nNamibia’s Women’s team have yet to qualify for a World Cup but have qualified for one Africa Women Cup of Nations. This sole qualification came when they hosted the 2014 tournament. Namibia got off to a flying start in the competition by beating Zambia 2-0 in their opening group game but then suffered a 3-1 defeat too Ivory Coast and a further defeat too Nigeria to finish 3rd in the group. Unfortunately their 3rd palce finish was not enough to see them progress further in the competition.\n\nThis concludes Part 4, two more parts to go – we now leave Namibia and travel a distance of 7,630 miles to The Netherlands.\n\nTHE NETHERLANDS\n\nThe Netherlands is situated in Northwestern Europe – to the North and West of the Country is the North Sea, it is bordered by Germany to the East and Belgium to the South. The Country also has three island territories in the Caribbean Sea – Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba – together with The Netherlands itself, all of this forms the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nNational Anthem – Wilhemus van Nassouwe ( The William )\n\nNational Motto – Je Maintiendrai ( you keep going )\n\nCapital City – Amsterdam\n\n“The Rijksmuseum in Amserdam” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nLargest City – Amsterdam\n\nCountry Population – 17,308,133\n\nOfficial Language – Dutch ( 4 regional languages and 3 recognised languages)\n\nGovernment – Unitary Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchy\n\nMonarch – Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands: Since 2013\n\nPrime Minister – Mark Rutte: Since 2010\n\nCurrency – Euro & US dollar\n\nMost Popular Sport – Football\n\nFOOTBALL IN THE NETHERLANDS\n\nFootball has been played in the Netherlands since the 19th Century, the sport being introduced to the country by Pim Mulier who when aged only 14, founded in 1879 what is today the oldest club in the Netherlands – Koninklijke HFC in Harlem. The club currently plays in the Tweede Divisie, the 3rd tier of football in the country.\n\nToday the top clubs in the Netherlands are the likes of Amsterdamche FC Ajax, PSV Enidhoven and Feyenoord.\n\nConfederation – UEFA (Europe)\n\nGoverning Body – The Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB)\n\nAssociation Headquarters – Zeist\n\nPresident – Just Spee\n\nLeague System – 10 tiers with promotion and relegation\n\nTop Division – Eredivisie\n\nDomestic Cups – The KNVB Cup\n\nThe Johan Cruyff Shield\n\nThe Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) was founded in 1889 making it one of the oldest Football Associations in the World. The KNVB were also founding members of FIFA in 1904 along with the associations of France, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Switzerland and Sweden. Football was played at an amateur level in The Netherlands until 1954 when The Dutch Professional Football Association was established. History was made when the first ever professional game in the country took place on 14th August 1954 between AZ Alkmaar v VVV-Venlo.\n\nFootball in the Netherlands has got an excellent structure, the top division is the Eredivisie with The Eerste Division at tier two. Below that is a semi-professional third tier – The Tweede Divisie followed by tiers 4-10 being played on Saturday’s and Sundays’ at an amateur level and divided into several sub-sections of regional football.\n\nThe first winners of the top division of Dutch football were perhaps unsurprisingly the first club to be founded in the country, Koninklijke HFC in 1889/1890 season. Indeed the club were very successful in the early years of Dutch Football winning the Dutch title two more times in the 1893/1893 season and the 1894/1895 season.\n\nFrom 1898 until 1954 the winners of the Dutch Championship were decided through a play-off system between several clubs who had won various regional competitions.\n\nAs the Dutch game moved on into the 20th Century the top club in the country were undoubtedly HVV Den Haag. Their first championship was actually won in the 1890/1891 season, their 2nd and 3rd triumph’s were in the 1895/1896 and 1899/1900 seasons respectively. Then their real golden period came by winning a further seven championships prior to the outbreak of the First World War, the last of which coming in the 1913/1914 season. That success in the 1913/1914 season was their last top division Dutch title in their history to date. The club has played at the same ground since 1898, the 1,200 capacity De Diepput Stadium in The Hague.\n\n“The De Diepput Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nAnother of the top clubs during the early 1900’s were Sparta Rotterdam, nicknamed as ‘The Castle Lords’ – the club won their first Championship in the 1908/1909 season and again in the following seasons: 1910/1911, 1911/1912, 1912/1913, 1914/1915. The last of their 6 titles to date coming many years later in the 1958/1959 season. Sparta Rotterdam will play in next season’s Eredivisie having been promoted from the Eerste division last season. The Club play their home games at the superb looking Sparta Stadion.\n\n“The Sparta Stadion” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nMoving into more modern times and as already mentioned the top clubs in The Netherlands are Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord. I think it is fair to say that these three clubs have dominated football in the country winning many league titles each. Out of these three clubs, Ajax have the most titles to their name with 34 to date, their last one coming only last season when they beat nearest rivals PSV to the title by three points.\n\nThe number one cup competition in The Netherlands is the KNVB Cup. The competition was first contested in the 1898/1899 season, that final saw RAP Amsterdam beat opponents HVV Den Haag 1-0 in the final.\n\nThe 2018/2019 KNVB Cup started on 18th August 2018 and ended with the final on 5th May 2019. A total of 58 amateur teams qualified for the 1st Preliminary Round with 26 of these teams receiving a bye into the 2nd Preliminary Round. The 2nd Preliminary round also saw 12 teams from the Dutch third tier entering the competition.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of both preliminary rounds, the 1st round saw the professional teams from the two top leagues entering the competition. The 2nd round, the round of 16, the quarter-finals and semi-finals then followed. After all of these games the final two teams remaining were Willem II and Ajax who played in the final on 5th May 2019.\n\nThe final took place at the home ground of Feyenoord – De Kuip.\n\n“De Kuip” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nAfter a tight opening 30 minutes it was Ajax who bossed the game from then on, winning the final 4-0 thanks to goals from – Daley Blind, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Rasmus Nissen Kristensen. This victory secured Ajax’s 19th KNVB Cup, the most won by any club in the history of footall in The Netherlands.\n\nTHE NETHERLANDS MEN’S NATIONAL TEAM\n\nNational Stadium – Three Stadiums used:\n\nJohan Cruyff Arena: 54,990 Capacity\n\nDe Kuip: 51,117 Capacity\n\nPhillips Stadion: 35,000 Capacity\n\n“Phillips Stadion” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nHead Coach – Ronald Koeman\n\nCaptain – Virgil van Dijk\n\nMost Caps – Wesley Sneijder: (134)\n\n“Wesley Sneijder” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nTop Goalscorer – Robin van Persie: (50)\n\nFirst International – Belgium 1-4 Netherlands: 30th April 1905\n\nBiggest Win – Netherlands 11-0 San Marino: 2nd September 2011\n\nBiggest Defeat – England Amateurs 12-2 Netherlands: 21st December 1907\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – (10) Best Result: Runners-up 1974, 1978 and 2010\n\nEuropean Championship Appearances – (9) Best Results: Champions 1988\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking – (14) June 2019\n\nTOURNAMENT PERFORMANCES\n\nThe Netherlands first World Cup came in 1934 in Italy, losing in the round of 16 against Switzerland 2-3. They also went no further than the round of 16 in the 1938 tournament held in France. The Netherlands did not enter the first two World Cups following the conclusion of World War II and did not qualfiy for the four tournaments held from 1958 in Sweden to 1970 held in Mexico.\n\nThe Netherlands qualified for the 1974 tournament in West Germany and in the first round group stage were drawn against Sweden, Bulgaria and Uruguay. The Netherlands eased through the group by winning 2 and drawing 1 of their 3 games.\n\nEight teams qualified for the 2nd round with those eight teams being placed into 2 groups of 4. Netherlands found themselves in a group alongside Brazil, East Germany and Argentina. Again, like the first round the team easily qualfied for the final by winning all three of their games which included a resounding 4-0 victory over Argentina in a game played at the Parkstadion.\n\nIn the final they came up against the hosts West Germany, despite taking an early lead through a penalty by Johan Neeskens they went onto lose the final by 2 goals to 1.\n\nThe 1978 tournament was held in Argentina and like the 1974 edition the Netherlands again came runners-up, this time losing 3-1 too hosts Argentina in the final after extra time, the scorer of the Dutch goal was Dick Nanninga.\n\nThe team failed to qualify for the next two tournaments but did qualify for the 1994 World Cup in USA reaching the Quarter-Finals stage. A fourth place finish in 1998 in France followed but then more disapointment as they did not qualify for the 2002 tournament.\n\nIn 2006 the Netherlands were knocked out at the round of 16 stage before finishing as runners-up in South Africa 2010. The Netherlands met Spain in the final held at the Soccer City Stadium in Johannesburg and lost a rather forgetable final 1-0 after extra time.\n\n“The Soccer City Stadium venue of 2010 World Cup Final” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe team went close again in Brazil 2014, falling at the semi-finals after being defeated 4-2 on penalties against Argentina, the game after extra time finishing scoreless.\n\nDespite success in recent years, The Netherlands failed to qualify for last years World Cup in Russia.\n\nThe Netherlands were triumphant in the 1988 European Championships, held in West Germany. I myself was aged 7 years old at the time and can easily remember the team beating the Soviet Union 2-0 in the final courtesy of a goal by Ruud Gullit and another by Marco Van Basten. Van Basten will also be remembered for his goal against England in the group stages of the competiton – an amzing volley from an impossible angle past Peter Shilton.\n\nIn the 2018/2019 UEFA Nations League, the Netherlands finished as runners-up to Portugal.\n\nPLAYERS\n\nThe Netherlands have always been blessed with some amazing football players. I have already mentioned some in, Johan Neeskens, Ruud Gullit and Marco Van Basten. Others include – Johan Cruyff, Ruud Van Nistelrooy, Patrick Kluivert, Ruud Krol, Arjen Robben and my personal favourite Dennis Bergkamp. These names are just a few Dutch players to grace the beautiful game but there are many, many more.\n\n“Dennis Bergkamp” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nWOMEN’S FOOTBALL IN THE NETHERLANDS\n\nWomen in the Netherlands first started to play football around the same time as the men in the 1890’s but were banned by the KNVB. In 1896 Sparta Rotterdam tried to establish a women’s team but were stopped by the powers that be. During the 1950’s the Dutch Ladies Football Association was founded and the association formed a Women’s Football League, but yet again this was banned by the KNVB. Following this ban, Women’s football was played in the Netherlands at regional levels only. This all changed however in the 1970’s when UEFA declared that all member associations must invest in Women’s Football.\n\nIn the 1970’s the Hoodfdklasse was the top level of the Women’s game in the country with the winner being declared the National Champions. The first Champions were VV Reutum in the 1973/1974 season. The competition remained to be the top level until the 2006/2007 season with the final winners being Ter Leede. After the 2006/2007 season the Hoodfdklassee became the 2nd tier after being replaced by the professional Eredivisie. Today it sits at the 3rd tier after being replaced by the Topklasse at the start of the 2011/2012 season.\n\nThe first winners of the professional Eredivisie were AZ Alkmaar with the most recent winners FC Twente Vrowen who qualify for next season UEFA Women’s Champions League.\n\nNETHERLANDS WOMEN’S NATIONAL TEAM\n\nThe national team played their first international on 17th April 1971, a 4-0 defeat against France in Hazebrouck.\n\nThe team have appeared in two World Cups with their best perfromance coming in 2015 by reaching the round of 16.\n\nThey have qualifed for three European Champions and were crowned as Champions in 2017 (hosts) when they beat Denmark 4-2 in front of a crowd of 28,182 people at the home of FC Twente – the De Grolsch Veste.\n\n“The De Grolsch Veste where Netherlands beat Denmark 4-2 in the 2017 European Championships” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThis concludes part 5 of the blog, we now travel 4,386 miles to the U.S. Virgin Islands for the final part of Around the Football World #2\n\nTHE UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS\n\nGeographically the United States Virgin Islands or USVI are part of the Virgin Islands archipelago and are situated in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles.

In 1998 the Federation were affiliated to FIFA, the governing body on USVI organises the USVI Premier League which has been running since the 1998/1999 season.\n\nThe 2018/2019 season was the first time in the islands football history that teams from the two main islands – Saint Croix and Saint Thomas, competed together in the same league format. Before last season the teams on the two islands played in their own leagues with the top four teams from each island progressing too the play-offs to determine an overall winner.\n\nThe 8 teams that contested the USVI 2018/2019 Premier League were:\n\nTeams from Saint Croix\n\nHelenites Soccer Club\n\nPrankton United\n\nRovers FC\n\nUnique FC\n\nTeams from Saint Thomas\n\nLaraza\n\nNew Vibes\n\nRaymix Soccer Club\n\nUnited We Stand\n\nThe top four teams would progress from the regular season to the semi-final play-offs. The top 4 teams were as follows:\n\nUnique FC (23 Pts) Raymix Soccer Club (21 Pts) Helenites (20 Pts) United We Stand (19 Pts)\n\nBoth semi-finals were contested over two legs, the first semi-final saw Raymix SC take on Helenites with Helenites winning the tie 5-2 on aggregate. The second semi-final saw perhaps rather surprisingly after the regular season, United We Stand beating table toppers Unique FC 2-0 on aggregate.\n\nThe final took place on 17th February, a close encounter eventually saw Helenites win the USVI Premier League by beating United We Stand 2-1. This was the 5th time in their history that they had won the USVI Premier League, their first title coming in the 2006/2007 season. The club plays at the 1,000 Capacity Grove Place Park ground.\n\nBy winning the USVI Premier League, Helenites qualify for the 2020 Caribbean Club Shield. This competition is the second tier annual club competition in the Caribbean.\n\nUSVI MEN’S NATIONAL TEAM\n\nNational Stadium – Lionel Roberts Park: Capacity 9,000\n\n“Lionel Roberts Park” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nHead Coach – Marcelo Serrano\n\nCaptain – James “J.C.” Mack III\n\nMost Caps – Derrick Smith (13)\n\nFirst International – U.S. Virgin Islands 1-0 British Virgin Islands: 21st March 1998\n\nBiggest Win – Anguilla 0-3 U.S. Virgin Islands: 22nd March 2019\n\nBiggest Defeat – Saint Lucia 14-1 U.S. Virgin Islands: 14th April 2001\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – (0)\n\nGold Cup Appearances – (0)\n\nCaribbean Cup Appearances – (0)\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking – (199) June 2019\n\nThe first thing to note above USVI Football at a national level is that the team does not technically have a National Stadium. The Lionel Roberts Park (pictured above) is primarily used for Baseball. In the past the team have played at the 5,000 capacity Paul E. Joseph stadium on Saint Croix, a multi-use venue. Football in USVI is the third most popular sport and perhaps this was shown when the National Team had to play one of their 2018 World Cup Qualification games at the Addelita Cancryn Junior High School Ground which is primarily used for Cricket.\n\nThe team have never qualified for the final rounds of any competition however the team did record a 3-0 win against Anguilla in their last game in March 2019 which was a qualifer for the 2019/2020 CONCACAF Nations League. This was their final game in qualifying and they will be in League C for the 2019/2020 campaign.\n\nPLAYERS\n\nAfter studying the USVI squad members for their game against Anguilla I noted that the captain of the team, James “J.C.” Mack III currently plays professionally for Icelandic club Vikingur Reykjavik. “J.C.” has previously played club football in Finland, Thailand and the USA. The USVI Squad featured Asanti Herring who also plays club football in Europe for FC Stein in Germany. The remaining players in the squad play for clubs in the Caribbean and the USA.\n\nWOMEN’S FOOTBALL IN USVI\n\nI will admit that my research found very little in relation to Women’s football in USVI, if anybody out there reading this knows more then please feel free to contact me. What I have found out though is that the team lost 6-1 against Suriname (date unknown) in their first ever international. The team’s biggest win (date unknown) was an 8-1 victory over the British Virgin Islands.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nI am now at the end of Around the Football World #2 – just like the first installment that I wrote I have thoroughly enjoyed writing this second blog on the subject which incidentally is the longest blog that I have ever written (just over 10,000 words)\n\nLike always if anybody would like to leave feedback of any description it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI will look to write another World Football Blog in the coming weeks.\n\nGareth Thomas.\n\n25th June 2019.\n\nThis blog, although titled number one is in reality a continuation from my blog published last week (Friday 7th June 2019) on dream football destinations. To quickly recap on that blog, I asked a question on twitter which read – “if money and time was no object which three countries in the world would you like to go and watch football in” from the replies I received, the top three destinations were – Argentina, Faroe Islands and Iceland with many more countries suggested. I wrote a blog on the three previously mentioned countries with regards to football and also wrote about another country that intigued me – Greenland.\n\nI have to say that I received some positive feedback to the piece and I enjoyed writing the blog so much that it gave me a thirst for more with regards to World Football.\n\nOn the evening of Friday 7th June 2019, my Wife Jodie and I conducted a draw to decide which countries I should research and write about for this very blog post. We videoed the draw and published it on social media. The format of the draw was to use the six confederations of world football, using every nation across those confederations and pick out one nation from every confederation pot.

The Andorran Football Federation then becme affilliated to UEFA and FIFA in 1996 meaning that Andorran Football Clubs have now been competiting in UEFA Competitions for 23 years.\n\nAll of the competiting clubs in the Andorran League System play at grounds (5 in total) that are owned by The Andorran Football Federation. One such stadium is based in the Capital, Andorra la Vella and is called Estadi Comunal d’Andorra la Vella with a capacity of 1,300. This stadium was used as the Andorran National Team’s Stadium until the opening of Estadi Nacional in 2014.\n\n“The Estadi Comunal d’Andorra la Vella Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe only club playing in The Andorran League System to have their own ground is FC Encamp who play at Camp de Futbol d’Encamp.\n\n“The FC Encamp Club Emblem” [Image:FCENCAMP]\n\nOne of the major clubs in Andorra, namely FC Andorra, do not play in their own countries League System. The club plays in the Spanish League System and has done since 1948 the club has gained promotion from The Primera Catalana (Spanish 5th Tier) and will play in the Spanish 4th Tier for the 2019/2020 season.\n\nIn terms of the most Top Division Andorran League triumph’s since The Andorran Football Federation was founded, FC Santa Coloma are way out in front with 13 titles to their name. In second place we find CE Principat with 3 wins and in third place we have three clubs tied on two title wins each, namely UE Sant Julia, FC Lusitanos and FC Encamp.\n\nFor the 2018/2019 season, the eight clubs that contested the Liga Multisegur Insurance Championship were: FC Encamp, UE Engordany, FC Santa Coloma, Inter Club d’Escaldes, FC Lusitanos, FC Ordino, UE Sant Julia and UE Santa Coloma.\n\nThe first stage of the 2018/2019 Liga Multisegur Insurance Championship was a round robin group stage (Regular Season) that saw the top four teams advancing to the Championship Round, those four teams being:\n\nUE Sant Julia, FC Santa Coloma, Inter Club d’Escaldes and UE Engordany.\n\nThe bottom four clubs of the regular season were then placed into the Relegation Round, those four teams being:\n\nFC Ordino, UE Santa Coloma, FC Lusitanos and FC Encamp.\n\nBoth the Championship and Relegations rounds were also played as a round robin group stage. After all of the games had been played it was FC Encamp who finished bottom of the Relegation Round (8th Overall) meaning demotion to The Segona Divisio. The club that finished in 7th place overall, namely FC Lustianos played the runners-up from the Segona Divisio, namely Club Esportiu Carroi over two legs to see which club would compete in the Liga Multiesegur Insurance Championship for the 2019/2020 season. Club Esportiu Carroi won the first leg 1-0, FC Lusitanos won the second leg also by the same margin. Thirty minutes of extra time was played and the two teams could still not be separated meaning the Play-Off Final was decided by Penalty Kicks. Club Esportiu Carroi held their nerve and triumphed in the shootout 4-2 to secure a place in the Andorran top flight for the 2019/2020 season.\n\nOver in the Championship Round it was FC Santa Coloma who secured the title by a solitary point ahead of runners-up UE Sant Julia.

From the research I have carried out is appears that their first fixture came only five years ago on 1st July 2014, a 1-0 away victory against Gibralter. This remains their only victory to date.\n\nTheir are 6 Women’s Club sides in Andorra that do play in a League Championship and their is a big drive in the Country to try and promote Girl’s and Women’s Football.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed Part One of this Blog – Now lets travel 5,781 miles to South America and to Bolivia in particular for Part Two.\n\nBolivia\n\nNational Anthem – Himno Nacional de Bolivia (Also Known as – Bolivanos, el Hado Propicio: English – Bolivians, a most Favourable Destiny)\n\nCapital City – La Paz\n\nLargest City – Santa Cruz de la Sierra\n\nOfficial Languages – Spanish and 36 Indigenous Languages\n\nGovernment – Unitary Presidential Constitutional Republic\n\nPresident – Evo Morales: Since 2006\n\nCountry Population – 11,428,425\n\nCurrency – Boliviano (BOB)\n\nNational/Most Popular Sport – Football\n\nFootball in Bolivia\n\nGoverning Body – Bolivian Football Federation\n\nFederation Headquarters – La Paz\n\nFounded – 1925\n\nPresident – Cesar Salinas\n\nLeague Pyramid Structure – Four Tiers with promotion and relegation: Tier 3 Divided into 9 Regional Leagues, Tier 4 same as Tier 3 with a second division for each regional league\n\nTop Division – Division de Futbol Profesional\n\nDomestic Cup Competitions –0\n\nThe Beautiful Game is the most popular sport in Bolivia and has been played in the country since the late 19th Century. Historians state that the game was introduced to Bolivia by the introduction of British Sailors, Chileans, Peruvians and Argentines to the country.\n\nThe progression of the sport in Boliva was halted somewhat by the War of the Pacific from 1879 to 1884. As time moved on and with the arrival of the 20th Century, Football began to become more and more popular. Today Bolivia has more than 2,000 Football Clubs.\n\nThe oldest Football Club in Bolivia and indeed one of the oldest in South America is, Oruro Royal who were founded in 1896. The club currently competes in the Bolivian 3rd tier and play their home games at The Estadio Jesus Bermudez.\n\nThe earliest memory that I personally have of Bolivian Football goes back to the 1994 World Cup in the USA. I remember watching Bolivia play against Germany in the opening game of the tournament, the game ended as a 1-0 victory for Germany, but what has really stayed in my memory from that game was the sending off of Bolivia’s Marco Etcheverry. Etcheverry is considered to be one of the greatest Bolivian Footballers of all time. In that 1994 encounter with Germany, he came onto the field as a substitute and was sent off after only playing for 4 minutes for kicking Germany’s, Lothar Matthus. The sending off meant that he would be banned for the next two games meaning that he would play no further part in the 1994 World Cup.\n\nBack to domestic Bolivian Football – the Division de Futbol Profesional, the top level of League Football in the country has been contested since 1950. In 1950 the top league was called the Torneo Interdepartmental, the first ever winners were Bolivar who were also the 2019 winners taking their overall tally too 29 title wins. Bolivar are by far the most successful club in Bolivian Football History.\n\n“The Estadio Hernando Siles, home of Bolivar” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nBOLIVIA NATIONAL TEAM\n\nConfederation – CONMEBOL (South America)\n\nNational Stadium – Estadio Hernando Siles (Pictured Above)\n\nHead Coach – Eduardo Villegas\n\nCaptain – Ronald Raldes\n\nMost Caps – Ronald Raldes (102) Still Active\n\nTop scorer – Joaquin Botero (20)\n\n“Joaquin Botero” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nFirst International – Chile 7-1 Bolivia: 12th October 1926\n\nBiggest Win – Bolivia 7-0 Venezuela: 22nd August 1993\n\nBolivia 9-2 Haiti: 3rd March 2000\n\nBiggest Defeat – Uruguay 9-0 Bolivia: 6th November 1927\n\nBrazil 10-1 Bolivia: 10th April 1949\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – 3\n\nBest World Cup Result – Group Stages: 1930, 1950 and 1994\n\nConfederations Cup Appearances – 1\n\nBest Confederation Result – Group Stage: 1999\n\nCopa America Appearances – 26\n\nBest Copa America Result – Champions: 1963\n\nFIFA Ranking – 63 (April 2019)\n\nWOMEN’S FOOTBALL IN BOLIVIA\n\nThe Bolivian Women’s Football Championship was formed in 2005, the first winners of the championship were Enforma Santa Cruz who have 5 titles to their name to date. The 2018 champions were Deportivo ITA – clubs qualify for the championship by winning their respective Regional Leagues.\n\nThe Bolivan Women’s National Team played their first ever international fixture on 8th January 1995 which ended as an 11-0 victory for their opponents that day, Chile. To show how much the Women’s game had progressed in Bolivia from that first international, the Women’s National side recored their biggest ever victory in 2003 – 7-1 against Chile! Women’s football continues to rise in popularity which is a good sign of things to come in the future.\n\nThat concludes Part 2 of this World Football Blog – now, from Bolivia we will travel 8,009 miles to Kuwait for Part 3.\n\nKUWAIT\n\nNational Anthem – al-Nashid al-watani\n\nCapital City – Kuwait City\n\nLargest City – Kuwait City\n\nOfficial Language – Arabic\n\nGovernment – Unitary Parliamentary Monarchy\n\nEmir – Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah: since 2006\n\nPrime Minister – Sheikh Jaber Al-Murbarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah: Since 2011\n\nCountry Population – 4,621,638\n\nCurrency – Kuwaiti dinar (KWD)\n\nNational/Most Popular Sport – Football\n\nFOOTBALL IN KUWAIT\n\nGoverning Body – The Kuwait Football Association\n\nAssociation Headquarters – Adiliya\n\nFounded – 1952\n\nPresident – Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah\n\nLeague Pyramid Structure – Two tiers with promotion and relegation\n\nTop Division – The Kuwait Premier League also known as The VIVA Premier League\n\nDomestic Cup Competitions – Kuwait Emir Cup\n\nKuwait Crown Prince Cup\n\nKuwait Super Cup\n\nThe first official league championship in Kuwait (1961/1962 season) was contested by 8 teams, the League Champions for that inaguaral championship were, Al-Arabi SC who did not lose a single game and finished 7 points clear of their nearest challengers, namely, Qadsia SC. This was the first of Al-Arabi’s 16 Kuwaiti League Championships to date, their last one coming in the 2001/2002 season. Al-Arabi were to win the championship on 6 seperate occasions during the 1960’s, their last triumph of the decade coming in the 1969/1970 season. This 6th championship was to be their last until they lifted the title again in the 1979/1980 season\n\nThe 2018/2019 season saw 10 clubs contesting the VIVA Premier League, the defending champions were Kuwait SC.\n\nThe first thing to note from the VIVA Premier League 2018/2019 season was the ruling that all of the competitng clubs were restricted to a total of five players each in their respective squads. In my opinion this is a superb ruling and one that other countries should maybe think about following.\n\nThe ten competitng clubs were made up of players from 19 different countries (plus Kuwait based players) which included players from the likes of – Cameroon, Brazil and Australia. Only one club in the championship did not have any foreign players in their squad, that club was Al-Arabi SC.\n\nAfter each club had played 18 games, the eventual winners were last season champions, Kuwait SC. The club claimed the championship by finishing 6 points clear of runners-up Qadsia SC. By winning the championsip (3rd in a row) Kuwait SC qualify for next seasons AFC Champions League Preliminary Round. Runners-up, Qadsia SC qualify for next seasons group stages of the AFC Cup.\n\n“The Al Kuwait Sports Club Stadium, home of Kuwait SC” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe Kuwait Emir Cup is considered to be the most important cup in Kuwaiti football and is played towards the end of the season.\n\nThe Kuwait Emir Cup was first contested in 1962, the first winners being Al-Arabi SC who beat Qadsia SC 7-1 in the final.\n\nThis seasons competition was contested by 15 clubs who played in this knockout style tournament comprising of five stages including the final. The winners of the VIVA Premier League, Kuwait SC lifted the trophy by beating Qadsia SC in the final played at The 65,000 capacity, Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium.\n\n“The Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe Winners of the 2018/2019 season Kuwait Crown Prince Cup were, yes you have guessed it – Kuwait SC who beat, yes, again you have guessed it – Qadsia SC in the final by 1 goal to 0.

The first regional championships took place 101 years ago in 1918.\n\nFootball in the country is extremely popular and loved by children and adults alike.\n\nThe Libyan Premier League is a semi-professional competition although a number of the foreign players playing for the various teams are professional. The first league championship was won by Al-Ahli (Tripoli) in the 1963/1964 season. Al-Ahli are the second most successful club (12 League Titles) in Libyan Football History and play their home matches at the 88,000 capacity Tripoli International Stadium.\n\n“The Tripoli International Stadium” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe most successful club in the history of football in Libya are, Al-Ittihad Club (Triploi) with 16 League titles currently to their name. The club became the first club from Libya to reach the semi-final stage of the CAF (Confederation of African Football) Champions League in 2007, losing to the eventual winners that year – Al Ahly SC from Egypt. Al-Ittihad Club also play their home games at the Tripoli International Stadium.\n\nThe 2018/2019 Libyan Premier League was contested by a total of 24 teams. These 24 teams were placed into two groups of 12 depending on their geographical location in the country. The top two teams from each group would then qualify for the championship play-offs. The two teams to qualify from Group 1 were Al-Ahly (Benghazi) and Al-Nasr SC (Benghazi). The two bottom placed teams, Khaleej Sirte SC and Anwar Al-Abyar were relegated to division 1. Over in Group 2 the top two placed teams were, Al-Ittihad Club (Tripoli) and Asswehly SC. The relegated teams ended up as, Almahalla SC and Rafik Sorman.

The other stadium used in that tournament was the March 28 stadium in Benghazi. Libya progressed all the way to the 1982 final drawing the match 1-1 after extra time against their opponents, Ghana. Ghana won the penalty shoot-out 7-6 to win the 1982 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nThe Libyan Cup was first contested for in 1976 although between the years 1978-1986 it was only played for three times.

The country takes up 40% of the divided island of Saint Martin in the South while the remaining 60% in the North of the island comprises of the French overseas collectivity of Saint-Martin as shown in the image below.\n\n“Saint Martin” [Image:Wikipedia]\n\nThe mountainous island of Saint Martin is the smallest area of land in the World that is divided into two nations.\n\nHistorically, Sint-Maarten was part of the island territory of the Windward Islands. This all changed in 1983 when it became an island territory of the Dutch Antilles. Sint Maarten has only been a constitutional country of the kingdom of the Netherlands since October 2010. Sint Maarten is a very popular tourist destination for people who choose to holiday on their itself and day trippers from the large number of cruise liners that dock in the capital, Phillipsburg.\n\nFOOTBALL IN SINT MAARTEN\n\nGoverning Body – The Sint Maarten Soccer Association\n\nAssociation Headquarters – Philipsburg\n\nFounded – 1986\n\nPresident – Sudesh Singh\n\nLeague Structure – 1 Tier\n\nTop Division – SMSA (Sint Maarten Soccer Association Senior League)\n\nDomestic Cup Competitions – 0\n\nThe Sint Maarten Senior League was founded in 1975, eleven years before the Soccer Association in the country was founded. The 1975/1976 season was the first time that the competition was held and was won by PSV.\n\nThe 2018/2019 season was the 42nd season for the Sint Maarten Senior League. Ten clubs contested the title with the top 6 clubs progressing to a further stage of the competition, Kaya 6. I must confess that I do not know who the overall champions were for the 2018/2019 season were as my research as drawn a blank. What I can tell you though is that Reggae Lions were at the top of the standings after the regular season had finished with Flames United in 2nd place. *If anybody reading this could tell me one the Sint Maarten Senior League for the 2018/2019 season it would be greatly appreciated*\n\nFlames United were founded in 2010 and play their home games at the 3,000 capacity Raoul Illidge Sports Complex in Philipsburg. This stadium is also used by the national team for home fixtures.\n\n“The Raoul Illidge Sports Complex” [Image:DailyHerald]\n\nThe National Stadium is named after Raoul Illidge, a benefactor who lives in Sint Maarten. Mr Illidge helped with the planning and construction of the stadium by the way of contributing 800,000 Netherlands Antillean Guilders to the project. Sadly the stadium fell on hard times, fell into a state of disrepair and was duly closed in July 2013 to allow for reconstruction works to be carried out. The rebuilding and renovation works were funded by the Dutch Funding Agency (Usona) and the Sint Maarten governement. This superb multi use facility was officially re-opened by the then Sint Maarten Prime Minister, Sarah Wescot-Williams and the Minister of Eductaion, culture, Youth and Sports Affairs, Patricia Lourens-Phillip on 7th March 2014.\n\nSINT MAARTEN NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM\n\nConfederation – CONCACAF (North America, Central America and Caribbean)\n\nNational Stadium – The Raoul Illidge Sports Complex\n\nHead Coach – Elvis Albertus\n\nCaptain – Jovani Anthony\n\nMost Caps – Peter Large (9)\n\nTop Scorer – (Current Players Only – unable to find historical records)\n\nJoost Roben (2)\n\nJaeremi Drijvers (2)\n\nGerwin Lake (2)\n\nRemsley Boelijn (2)\n\nFirst International – Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 6-1 Sint Maarten: 23rd April 1989\n\nBiggest Win – Sint Maarten 4-0 Anguilla: 29th March 1996\n\nBiggest Defeat – Haiti 13-0 Sint Maarten: 10th September 2018\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – 0 (Not affiliated to FIFA at time of writing)\n\nCONCACAF Gold Cup Appearnces – 0\n\nCaribbean Cup Appearances – 1\n\nCaribbean Cup Best Result – Group Stage: 1993\n\nFIFA Ranking – N/A (Not affiliated to FIFA at the time of writing)\n\nAlthough the Sint Maarten National Football team are not affiliated to FIFA, they are members of CONCACAF (Since 2013) and the Caribbean Football Union (Since 1989) which enables the team to take part in competitions sanctioned by both organisations.\n\nBetween the years of 1992 – 2016, Sint Maarten had only played approximately 25 matches. The National team only played one unofficial game between 2000 – 2016, in August 2004 they played at home against Sint Eustatius. The game ended all square as a 2-2 draw. The team returned fully to International Football in 2016, taking part in the qualifying rounds of the 2017 Caribbean Cup.

The Ellice Islands became a British Protectorate in 1892 , in December 1974 a referendum was called in order to debate and determine if both The Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration. The results of the referendum were in favour of this and as such the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony discontinued in January 1976. With this, the seperate British Colonies – Kiribati and Tuvalu came into being. Full independence within the Commonwealth was obtained by Tuvalu in October 1978 and in September 2000 it became a member of the United Nations and at the time the 189th member.\n\nFOOTBALL IN TUVALU\n\nGoverning Body – Tuvalu National Football Association\n\nAssociation Headquarters – Funafuti\n\nFounded – 1979\n\nPresident – Toakai Puapua\n\nLeague Structure – Three Tiers\n\nTop Division – Tuvaluan A-Division also known as:\n\nThe National Provident Fund Championship League\n\nDomestic Cups – NBT Cup\n\nIndependence Cup\n\nChristmas Cup\n\nTuvalu Games\n\nIn November 2006 The Tuvalu National Football Association became an associate memeber of the Oceania Football Confederation.
