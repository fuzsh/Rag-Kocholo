        "text": "He is arguably the best left-footed player since Maradona (yes Messi is lefty but he is not a FK specialist) and without a doubt one if not the best goal-scoring AM in the past 20+ years.\n\nThis guy had vision (perhaps not his biggest forte) was fast, strong, superb dribbling skills, great passing skills, and was a great finisher. On top of that, he was a leader and a PK & FK specialist. So how come people tend to forget him? He didn’t even make GOAL’s. COM la liga team of the century (Figo, Ronaldinho, Zidane) were chosen over him. You may say well he was at his best from 98-00 and he left Barcelona in 02, uhm okay if that’s the case how come he wasn’t included in the team of the decade? Again you may say his best came before 00’! Well his 2002 WC performance alone overshadows anything Figo did in his career, that’s for sure. The best Ronaldinho wasn’t as devastating as prime Rivaldo! Prime Zizou wasn’t as dominating as prime Rivaldo either.\n\nYes he was very unfortunate to have played in the same era as Ronaldo and Zidane but this man wasn’t that much behind them. Many people don’t consider him a legend because he “only played” a few good seasons in Spain and his reign as the world’s best player didn’t last long enough. These people dismiss everything he did from Brazil to Deportivo. On top of that, people forget how superb this man performed in the world’s biggest stage: THE WORLD CUP. Made the all-star teams twice scored a total of 8 goals in two WC tournaments and had a total of 4 assists. Yes I’m aware he played as a SS in the 2002 and he did a magnificent job at it. I always thought this man was an absolute Barcelona legend and two years ago (or was it last year) there was a poll to determine Barcelona all-time dream team: Messi, Cruyff, Maradona, Ronaldinho were included in the midfield and Rivaldo was nowhere to be found in the starting line-up. Rivaldo won more than Cruyff and Maradona did at Barcelona and Rivaldo in his prime was better than Dinho and this current Messi. What a bloody insult!\n\nIt’s amazing how many people simply do not see him as a legend. Is it because he’s a modern-day legend? Players such as RIVELINO, RIVERA, GULLIT, RUMMENIGGE, etc. are held in a higher level than the great Rivaldo? WHY IS THAT?\n\nRivaldo won more than Rivelino did both at club level and international level. Both were lefty, both were free kick specialists, RIVALDO scored more goals, Rivelino had better vision probably but not by much…Rivaldo was stronger and faster, better dribbler, and a better finisher but NOooooo Rivelino gets the nod for some reason.\n\nRivaldo vs Rivera? Rivera probably won more at club level but not by much. Rivaldo eclipses Rivera at international level and overall talent.\n\nRivaldo vs Gullit? Gullit was a more complete player but never put-up Rivaldo like numbers, not even close. Again one was a better club player but the other shone at the International stage brighter than the other. IMHO, Rivaldo was a tad more gifted and had more technique than the Dutchman and was a better goal scorer as well.\n\nRivaldo vs Rummenigge…Both were wingers/LAM both could play as SS. Perhaps Rummenigge was a better finisher but Rivaldo was simply more gifted. In addition, Rivaldo has scored more career goals than Rummenigge!\n\nSo how come the aforementioned are considered legends among legends and poor RIVALDO time after time gets the cold shoulder? I think this next article sums it up nicely:\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/jun/19/barcelona.brazil\n\nI have always wondered what would have happened in 2006 if Rivaldo had been present, even as an option off the bench.\n\nRivaldo is not seen as pivotal to 2002 in the same way as Romario is still seen as pivotal to 1994 because Ronaldo scored more, including the 2 goals in the final. But in any case, there is a similarity with Romario: the last the world saw of Romario in the World Cup was of him lifting the trophy in glory in 1994. He avoided the 1998 tragedy. Likewise, the last the world saw of Rivaldo in the World Cup was of him celebrating with the trophy in Asia after the team defeated Germany. And he too avoided a fiasco, this time, in 2006."
