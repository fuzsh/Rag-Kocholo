        "text": "Persistent Japan ease past Thailand, name strong squad for Asian Cup\n\nJapan coach Hajime Moriyasu hailed his team's persistence after they warmed up for this month's Asian Cup with a 5-0 friendly win over Thailand in Tokyo on Monday.\n\nThe four-time Asian champions were held scoreless in the first half in front of a New Year's Day crowd of more than 60,000 before breaking Thailand's resistance after the interval.\n\nJapan will start as one of the favourites to win the Asian Cup in Qatar and Moriyasu warned that they will need to show the same spirit when the tournament kicks off on January 12.\n\n\"They weren't an easy team to break down but the players attacked with positivity,\" said Moriyasu, who named the injured Kaoru Mitoma in his 26-man Asian Cup squad.\n\n\"It didn't happen for us at first but we stuck to the task and kept attacking time and time again, and we got our reward with our goals in the end.\"\n\nMoriyasu fielded an inexperienced line-up missing several overseas-based players against a Thailand side that is also heading to the Asian Cup.\n\nAo Tanaka broke the deadlock five minutes into the second half before goals from Keito Nakamura, Takumu Kawamura, Takumi Minamino and a Thailand own goal gave the hosts a comfortable win.\n\nMoriyasu said his players had been proactive in attacking the opposition but urged them to keep improving.\n\n\"In order to win at the Asian Cup and to beat the very best teams in the world, we have to be dogged in defence and get better at winning the ball back from them,\" he said.\n\nJapan have been drawn in Group D at the Asian Cup and will face Indonesia, Iraq and Vietnam in the first round, with Moriyasu also picking a strong squad for the Asian Cup.\n\nLiverpool midfielder Wataru Endo and Arsenal defender Takehiro Tomiyasu were also selected, along with Real Sociedad attacking midfielder Takefusa Kubo.\n\nLazio's Daichi Kamada was left out as Japan look to win the Asian Cup for a record fifth time.\n\nCeltic's Daizen Maeda and Reo Hatate made the cut but club-mate Kyogo Furuhashi was not selected.\n\nThey lost 3-1 to Qatar in the final of the 2019 Asian Cup in the United Arab Emirates and they beat Australia 1-0 in the final the last time the tournament was held in Qatar, in 2011.\n\nJapan squad:\n\nGoalkeepers: Daiya Maekawa (Vissel Kobe), Zion Suzuki (Sint-Truiden/BEL), Taishi Brandon Nozawa (FC Tokyo)\n\nDefenders: Shogo Taniguchi (Al-Rayyan/QAT), Kou Itakura (Monchengladbach/GER), Tsuyoshi Watanabe (Gent/BEL), Yuta Nakayama (Huddersfield/ENG), Koki Machida (Union SG/BEL), Seiya Maikuma (Cerezo Osaka), Takehiro Tomiyasu (Arsenal/ENG), Hiroki Ito (Stuttgart/GER), Yukinari Sugawara (AZ/NED)\n\nMidfielders/forwards: Wataru Endo (Liverpool/ENG), Junya Ito (Reims/FRA), Takuma Asano (Bochum/GER), Takumi Minamino (Monaco/FRA), Hidemasa Morita (Sporting/POR), Kaoru Mitoma (Brighton/ENG), Daizen Maeda (Celtic/SCO), Reo Hatate (Celtic/SCO), Ritsu Doan (Freiburg/GER), Ayase Ueda (Feyenoord/NED), Keito Nakamura (Reims/FRA), Kaishu Sano (Kashima Antlers), Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad/ESP), Mao Hosoya (Kashiwa Reysol)\n\nRuud takes charge to steer Norway past Croatia at United Cup, Swiatek also powers Poland at same tourney\n\nA sharp Casper Ruud won his second straight singles match of the season on Monday before backing up in the mixed doubles to steer Norway past Croatia at the United Cup.\n\nWorld number 23 Donna Vekic ground past unheralded Malene Helgo 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 to give the Croats a winning start to the Group F tie at the mixed teams tournament in Sydney.\n\nBut three-time Grand Slam finalist Ruud swept past Borna Coric 6-4, 6-1 in just 89 minutes to level proceedings, then teamed with Ulrikke Eikeri to beat Vekic and Ivan Dodig 6-2, 3-6, 10-7.\n\nIt was a much-needed win for Norway who lost against the Netherlands at the weekend.\n\n\"I'm motivated for the new year, I'm fresh and I'm ready,\" said world number 11 Ruud.\n\n\"Another great singles match. I'm very happy to start the new year that way.\"\n\nIt followed a similarly dominant 6-3, 6-4 win over Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor on Saturday.\n\nRuud has dropped serve just once through the two matches, and was not broken on Monday.\n\nHe also won 12 of 13 net approaches and said he had been working hard to improve his volleys.\n\n\"I'll never be the guy who is all over the net, but I'm trying to come into the court a little more,\" he said.\n\nVekic needed two hours and 49 minutes to battle past Helgo, who played far better than her ranking of 539 suggested.\n\n\"She's a really good player and her ranking doesn't do her justice,\" said Vekic, a quarter-finalist at the Australian Open last year.\n\n\"Finally my serve showed up in the third set, which made it easier.\"\n\nVekic was put to the test in the first set, falling 5-2 behind before winning the next eight points to get back on serve and coming through 7-5.\n\nAt the same tournament, An irrepressible Iga Swiatek unleashed on Spain Monday as Poland booked a 2-1 win to move into the quarter-finals.\n\nThe world number one showed no mercy to Sara Sorribes Tormo in a 6-2, 6-1 singles victory before teaming with Hubert Hurkacz to clinch the tie with a 6-0, 6-0 mixed doubles thrashing in just 53 minutes.\n\nHurkacz was ambushed in the day's opening singles, losing 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.\n\nThe top-seeded Poles finished Group A play with a perfect 2-0 record and await a last-eight opponent.\n\nSwiatek, who has lost only seven games in two singles matches to start her countdown to the Australian Open, said playing mixed doubles was good experience.\n\n\"It's lessons for the future and great practice,\" the 22-year-old said.\n\n\"I hardly ever play mixed. You use different skills, it's about feeling the geometry of the court.\"\n\nHurkacz credited his teammate with doing most of the hard yards.\n\n\"She carried me throughout the whole match, in every game she was making amazing shots,\" the world number nine said.\n\n'Super nervous' Osaka wins comeback match at Brisbane international\n\nFormer world number one and new mother Naomi Osaka said Monday she was proud to have won her first match back after a long break, admitting she had been \"super nervous\".\n\nThe 26-year-old was on court at the Brisbane International for an hour and 47 minutes before finally seeing off gallant German Tamara Korpatsch 6-3, 7-6 (11/9) on Pat Rafter Arena.\n\n\"I was super nervous, but I was excited to be out there,\" said Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion who stepped away from tennis in September 2022, citing mental health concerns.\n\n\"I think it's better to have harder matches early because it will train me for what's to come.\n\n\"I know all the opponents I play aren't easy anyway, so it would be very 'out there' for me to think my first match would be a 6-1, 6-1 win.\n\n\"Looking back on the match now, honestly I'm very proud of myself. I feel like I played at a pretty good level.\"\n\nAfter giving birth to a baby girl in July, Osaka rediscovered her love of the game and decided to return for the 2024 season.\n\nIt looked like she had never been away when she broke Korpatsch to love in the opening game then broke once more to take the first set relatively comfortably.\n\nBut it was a different story in the second set as Korpatsch lifted and Osaka began to feel the pressure.\n\nKorpatsch broke Osaka's serve to start the second set and although the Japanese star broke straight back, she was no longer as settled against the tenacious German.\n\nOsaka did break once more and was serving for the match at 5-4, but she was broken again and it went to a tiebreak, where both players had their chances.\n\nOsaka squandered two match points and Korpatsch two set points before Osaka prevailed on her third opportunity with a powerful forehand down the line.\n\nShe said courtside that motherhood had changed her outlook on the game, and she had felt too isolated from fans and fellow players previously.\n\n\"The last couple of years that I played before I had my daughter I didn't return as much love as I was given,\" she said.\n\n\"So I really feel like that's what I want to do in this chapter. I just really appreciate people coming out and cheering for me.\n\n\"I would say she's (her daughter) helped me grow up so much so quickly,\" Osaka added.\n\n\"Off the court I'm more aware of people and I appreciate them a lot more, even my opponents and everything.\"\n\nNew mum Osaka's love for tennis rekindled as she makes comeback\n\nJapan's Naomi Osaka admitted Saturday she almost gave up tennis but had rekindled her love of the sport after becoming a mother earlier this year as she prepares for a return in Brisbane.\n\nOsaka, 26, stepped away from the game in September 2022, citing mental health concerns following her withdrawal from the second round of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo.\n\nIn her time away, she gave birth to daughter Shai, and did not watch any tennis until last year's Wimbledon.\n\nAlthough excited to be back, she conceded that retiring permanently had crossed her mind.\n\n\"I would say right after Tokyo for, like, a month maybe I was thinking about retirement because I felt like all my joy went away for the sport,\" she said at the season opening Brisbane International.\n\n\"I felt like it kind of wasn't fair, both for the people watching and myself.\n\n\"But then I thought, I've played tennis since I was three and there's so many more things that I want to do.\"\n\nOsaka said since giving birth her approach to tennis had changed.\n\n\"I think in the time I had away, I appreciated the sport a lot more,\" she said. \"I think definitely becoming a mum changed my mindset a lot.\"I think I'm a lot more open-minded, a lot more patient, but also I feel a lot stronger physically.\"\n\nThe four-time Grand Slam champion was awarded a wildcard to the Brisbane event in the lead-up to the Australian Open and will play Germany's 84th ranked Tamara Korpatsch in the first round.\n\n\"I feel definitely I'm nervous, I haven't played a match in a long time, but I'm competitive so I'm thinking I'm nervous and I want to win,\" Osaka said.\n\n\"There's a lot of things that are going on in my head.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is just walking onto the court and sort of absorbing all the energy and experiencing the atmosphere. For me that is something that I'm definitely going to treasure a lot.\"\n\n- AFP\n\nFormer Nepal cricket captain Lamichhane convicted of rape\n\nNepali cricket star Sandeep Lamichhane was on Friday convicted of rape after a repeatedly delayed trial that had left him free to continue his sporting career.\n\nLamichhane, 23, was once the poster boy for the rise of cricket in Nepal and the leg spinner's on-field success had boosted the sport's profile in the Himalayan republic.\n\nLast year he was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl in a Kathmandu hotel but was freed on bail in January and returned to the squad to compete in international tournaments.\n\nHis lawyer Saroj Ghimire told AFP that a court had convicted Lamichhane on Friday.\n\n\"His sentence will be decided in the next hearing,\" he added.\n\nDistrict court official Ramu Sharma confirmed the verdict to AFP.\n\n\"The event was not consensual,\" he said.\n\nWhen authorities issued an arrest warrant Lamichhane initially failed to return from Jamaica, where he was playing in the Caribbean Premier League.\n\nHe was dismissed as national captain and arrested last year but Nepal lifted his playing ban after he was freed on bail.\n\nThis allowed him to remain in the national team, including for the World Cup qualifiers and September's Asia Cup.\n\nLamichhane has consistently denied the charge against him and enjoyed strong public support despite the accusations.\n\n\"You are hero of Nepali cricket team be strong we can understand your problem take care of your self,\" one fan wrote on his official Facebook page in October.\n\nHundreds of cheering cricket fans welcomed him when he first returned to the field in February.\n\nBut his continued playing career has also sparked anger and caused numerous Nepalis to disavow the team.\n\nScotland's cricketers refused to shake hands with him after their matches during an international tournament in Dubai.\n\nThe case against Lamichhane took more than a year to conclude after repeated delays on procedural grounds.\n\nCricket does not enjoy the same adulation in mountainous Nepal as it does elsewhere in South Asia.\n\nBut it has been growing in popularity, with Nepal given one-day international status by the world governing body in 2018.\n\nLamichhane has been a major part of this rise as the most sought-after Nepali cricketer in lucrative leagues around the world.\n\nThe leg spinner's big break came when he was snapped up for the lucrative Indian Premier League, the world's richest cricket tournament, in 2018.\n\nAbout 2 300 rape cases were reported in Nepal in the 2021-22 fiscal year, according to police, but rights workers say many more assaults go unreported.\n\nOnly a handful of women in Nepal spoke out during the #MeToo movement, and those accused have faced little or no repercussions over the allegations.\n\n- AFP\n\nMan City's Grealish burgled during match\n\nManchester City winger Jack Grealish was burgled while the England star was playing in his club's Premier League match at Everton on Wednesday.\n\nGrealish's Cheshire mansion in north-west England was targeted by thieves as he was in action for the Premier League champions during their 3-1 victory on Merseyside.\n\nMembers of Grealish's family and his fiancée Sasha Atwood were watching the televised match at the house when they heard a disturbance, according to reports on Friday.\n\nAn alarm was raised and an emergency response was launched with a helicopter, police dogs and a number of officers sent to the property, but no suspects were detected.\n\nIt was reported the robbers made off with £1 million ($1.2 million) worth of jewellery and watches.\n\nGrealish, 28, was informed of the raid after City's match finished.\n\nA spokeswoman for Cheshire Constabulary said: \"At around 9.50pm on Wednesday 27 December police were called to reports of a burglary.\n\n\"The caller reported that a number of items had been stolen.\n\n\"Officers, supported by the police dogs and NPAS (National Police Air Service), were deployed and searches were conducted in the local area, but there was no trace of the suspects.\n\n\"No arrests have been made at this time and enquiries are ongoing.\"\n\nCity manager Pep Guardiola was relieved nobody was hurt in the incident, but did not confirm if Grealish would be available for Saturday's home game against Sheffield United.\n\n\"Fortunately nothing wrong happened where the family was inside,\" Guardiola told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"It is what it is today in the modern day, with many things happening.

Cummins grabbed his fifth wicket by bowling Hasan Ali for two before Lyon had Hamza stumped for the same score.\n\n- AFP\n\nGakpo backs Liverpool forwards to fill in for absent Salah\n\nLiverpool's Cody Gakpo believes his side have the forward firepower to cope without Mohamed Salah when the Egypt star departs for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nDarwin Nunez ended a run of 12 games without a goal, while Diogo Jota came off the bench to score after a month out injured in a 2-0 win over Burnley on Tuesday which took Liverpool to the top of the Premier League table.\n\nSalah has one more Liverpool game - at home to Newcastle on Sunday - before he departs for the African Nations Cup and the 16-goal winger is set to be away from Anfield on international duty for up to a month.\n\nThat makes Nunez and Jota's goals against Burnley all the more timely, with Gakpo having scored seven himself so far this season.\n\n\"For every attacking player who didn't score for a few games, it's always nice to get back on the scoresheet and Darwin did it with a very good goal,\" said Gakpo.\n\n\"For Diogo as well. When you are injured and you come back and score that's always nice and good for the confidence. So really happy.\n\n\"Mo is gone after the Newcastle game so we need the goals. Of course, I think I can contribute even more.\"\n\nLiverpool captain Virgil Van Dijk added: \"It's always important for the guys up front to score goals. I am delighted for Darwin. Diogo, it's the same story. It's good to see the boys back on the scoresheet.\n\n\"I also want to say that Cody was outstanding, in the first half especially. It's good to see. Everyone has to keep pushing each other. That's the only way we can get better,\" the Netherlands defender explained.\n\n\"Others have to step up anyway.

Today the boys played some good cricket and we got the result.\"\n\nShanto's contribution began with him winning the toss and inserting the Black Caps on a lush, bouncy surface which also offered sideways movement -- and his seamers responded.\n\nThree of them picked up three wickets as New Zealand were skittled for their lowest total in 45 ODIs between the teams.\n\nTanzim Hasan Sakib (3/14) and Soumya Sarkar (3/18) both bagged career-best figures while Shoriful Islam's 3/22 included the scalp of top-scoring Will Young, caught in the gully for 26.\n\nSakib said his methods were simple.\n\n\"I tried to bowl wicket to wicket and I tried to bowl line and length. The wicket did the rest of the work. It really helped me.\"\n\nYoung has been in superb touch in the series, scoring 105 and 89 in the wins in Dunedin and Nelson respectively.\n\nCaptain Tom Latham (21) put on 36 with Young for the third wicket but his dismissal, clean bowled by Islam, sparked a collapse which saw the last eight wickets fall for 40 runs, many of them to wayward shots.\n\nThere was an early blemish in the run chase when opening batter Sarkar, who scored 169 in a losing cause in Napier on Wednesday, was forced to retire hurt for four because of an eye problem.\n\nLoose New Zealand bowling meant there were few problems from that point, with Shanto (51 not out) putting on 69 with opener Anamul Haque, who was the only batsman dismissed when edging paceman William O'Rourke on 37.\n\nO'Rourke had earlier been struck for four successive boundaries by the free-hitting Shanto in the 11th over of the innings.\n\nNew Zealand had rested a number of senior players for the series and Latham said some of his newer squad members will have learned a lot.\n\n\"Obviously it was a very below-par performance,\" he said.\n\n\"Bangladesh found a way to bowl on that surface and managed to get plenty out of it. We weren't able to build any sort of pressure and put it back on them so it's pretty disappointing.\"\n\nThe teams will prepare for a three-match T20 international series, starting in Napier on Wednesday.\n\nSanderson elated as Premiership leaders Sale edge Saracens\n\nSale supremo Alex Sanderson was understandably delighted after the English Premiership leaders won 22-20 at home to fellow title contenders Saracens on Friday.\n\nThe match had been billed as a clash of two childhood friends in Sale's George Ford and fellow England fly-half Owen Farrell, who recently announced he would miss the Six Nations after deciding to take a break from international rugby \"to prioritise his and his family's mental wellbeing\".\n\nBut the fixture was about more than the two stand-offs, with northwest club Sale posting their 12th straight home league win thanks to tries from Agustin Creevy, Tom Roebuck and Luke Cowan-Dickie and seven points from the boot of Ford.\n\nSale are now four points clear at the top heading into the weekend's fixtures, with Sanderson saying: \"There is a sense of relief, but I'm so happy the lads made good of their intentions against a really good Saracens side.\n\n\"I suppose it makes Christmas that bit sweeter for us -- we'll all enjoy our Christmas morning now.\n\n\"Farrell kicked 10 points for Saracens but tries from Ivan van Zyl and Gareth Simpson were only enough for the London club to claim a losing bonus point as Saracens suffered successive Premiership defeats after going down to Northampton earlier this month.\n\n\"We knew it would be a difficult game away at a quality side like Sale,\" said Saracens chief Mark McCall.\n\n\"Having said that, I'm proud and pleased of the way we played throughout the 80 minutes.\n\n\"The players showed real energy and they kept fighting right until the end, and we almost clawed our way back to claim a victory.\n\n\"We're not too far away, we're getting there. We've got some really tough fixtures coming up, but also we've got a few players to come back into the reckoning over the next few weeks.\"\n\nBristol won 21-13 away to Newcastle in Friday's other Premiership match as the Falcons suffered a 12th straight defeat.\n\nKhawaja insists armband was not political, after ICC reprimand\n\nAustralia's Usman Khawaja said on Friday that a black armband he wore in the first Test against Pakistan was for a \"personal bereavement\" and not politically motivated, after the star batter was reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\nThe 36-year-old donned the armband during the team's 360-run victory in Perth, a move seen at the time as support for people in Gaza, where thousands have been killed.\n\nHe had wanted to wear shoes emblazoned with the hand-written slogans \"Freedom is a human right\" and \"All lives are equal\" during the match, saying he had been hit hard by the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nBut Khawaja, who is Muslim, was told that it flouted ICC rules on messages that relate to politics, religion or race.\n\nHe covered the messages with tape and wore the armband.\n\nKhawaja insisted he told the ICC during the match that it was for a personal bereavement and no hidden meaning.\n\nHowever, the ICC said it breached their clothing and equipment regulations.\n\n\"Usman displayed a personal message (armband) during the first Test match against Pakistan without seeking the prior approval of Cricket Australia and the ICC to display it, as required in the regulations for personal messages,\" the ICC said late on Thursday.\n\n\"This is a breach under the category of an 'other breach' and the sanction for a first offence is a reprimand.\"\n\nKhawaja said he would not wear an armband during the second Test in Melbourne next week, but remained defiant.\n\n\"No, I'm not wearing it again. As I said to the ICC, the armband was for a personal bereavement,\" he told reporters in Melbourne.\n\n\"The armband was different to my shoes. The shoes were very obvious. At the end of the day I didn't wear the shoes. I respected the rules and procedures and left it at that.\"\n\nHe added that being reprimanded for the armband \"makes no sense\" and pointed to other players who had previously put stickers on their bats and names on their shoes without approval and escaped punishment, urging the ICC to be more consistent.\n\n\"I will just be asking and contesting that they (ICC) make it fair for everyone and they have consistency in how they officiate. That's all I ask for, and from my point of view, that consistency hasn't been done yet,\" he said.\n\n- AFP\n\nAustralia recruit World Rugby stalwart to shake up Wallabies\n\nLong-serving World Rugby administrator Peter Horne was on Friday appointed as Australia's director of high-performance, with part of his brief to \"purpose-build a new Wallabies programme from scratch\".\n\nHorne, an Australian, spent nearly 14 years working for the sport's world governing body, most recently as its high-performance director after a stint as general manager at Saracens.\n\nHe was hired by Rugby Australia after the Wallabies' abysmal World Cup campaign under coach Eddie Jones, where they failed to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.\n\nJones has since quit and taken over at Japan, with a successor yet to be appointed.\n\nHorne's remit will cover coaching, strength-and-conditioning and player development among both men and women and the Sevens team.\n\nIn particular, he will help develop a new Wallabies staff, while aligning Super Rugby franchises to better prepare players for international duty.\n\n\"We have an opportunity to purpose-build a new Wallabies program from scratch,\" he said.\n\n\"And there is universal agreement across the Super Rugby clubs that the high-performance systems and pathways need a major overhaul to ensure everyone is pushing in the same direction;

I thought 160 would have been a decent score to try and defend. [Then] we needed wickets to try to win the game and I thought we did well to hang in as long as we did,\" he said.\n\n\"If we would have had a few more runs to play with, we could have put a bit more pressure on the opposition but I thought it was a really good effort with the ball,\" he added.\n\n- AFP\n\nWelbeck salvages draw for Brighton at Crystal Palace\n\nDanny Welbeck's late equaliser denied Crystal Palace a first Premier League win in seven games as Brighton salvaged a 1-1 draw at Selhurst Park on Thursday.\n\nJordan Ayew headed the Eagles into the lead in first half stoppage time as Palace pounced on Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen's poor clearance.\n\nHowever, the home side could not hold out as this fixture ended 1-1 at Selhurst Park for the fifth consecutive season.\n\nAfter a bright start to the season, Brighton have won just twice in their last 12 league games as a lengthy injury list and the club's first ever foray into European football has taken its toll.\n\nThe Seagulls have also now gone a club-record 22 successive league games without keeping a clean sheet.\n\nBut Robert De Zerbi's changes for the second half summoned a response from the visitors.\n\n\"I think we lost two points but if we lost two points it is because we made too many mistakes, especially in the first half,\" said De Zerbi.\n\n\"We played with more energy in the second half and found the chance to score.\"\n\nWelbeck's introduction was one of two half-time substitutions and the former England international's precise header into the top corner from Pascal Gross' cross levelled on 82 minutes.\n\nA point edges Brighton up to eighth in the table, while Palace move nine points clear of the relegation zone in 15th.\n\nRoy Hodgson's men have still won just once at home all season, but the former England manager admitted Brighton were worthy of at least a point after dominating the second half.\n\n\"I can't deny the quality of Brighton's second half performance, and they were worthy of their goal,\" said Hodgson.\n\n\"I think I've got to say that at the end of the day, with [it being] a derby game, I think we have to be satisfied with one point.\"\n\n- AFP\n\nUEFA court defeat revives battle with breakaway Super League\n\nThe promoters of a Super League announced plans for a new breakaway competition on Thursday after the EU's top court ruled that UEFA had used illegal tactics to stifle a previous project.\n\nThe European Court of Justice ruling did not constitute an endorsement of the Super League idea, which still faces furious opposition from many football fans and from Europe's existing national leagues.\n\nBut it marks a serious legal setback for UEFA and for soccer's world governing body FIFA, finding that their tactic of threatening to ban future Super League clubs and players from taking part in their competitions broke EU law.\n\nAnd it was seized upon by the promoters of the Super League project, A22 Sports Management, to promote their vision of a new 64-team tournament that would feature promotion and relegation and would be broadcast live for free \"on a new streaming platform\".\n\n\"The FIFA and UEFA rules making any new interclub football project subject to their prior approval, such as the Super League, and prohibiting clubs and players from playing in those competitions, are unlawful,\" the ECJ ruled.\n\nBecause UEFA operates as a monopoly in setting the rules, while also organising tournaments of its own such as the Champions League, its criteria for authorising rival competitions should be \"transparent, objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate\".\n\n\"However, the powers of FIFA and UEFA are not subject to any such criteria. FIFA and UEFA are, therefore, abusing a dominant position,\" the court ruled.\n\nThe planned Super League project has been mothballed since it collapsed in early 2021 amid fan fury at the threat it posed to national league competitions, but after the ruling the promoters claimed victory and promised rapid announcements.\n\n\"We have won the right to compete. The UEFA monopoly is over. Football is free,\" the firm's CEO Bernd Reichart declared in a social media post from the A22 account.\n\n\"Clubs are now free from the threat of sanction and free to determine their own futures.\"\n\nBut UEFA chose to emphasise a different part of the ECJ judgment, stressing that the ruling \"does not signify an endorsement or validation of\" the breakaway competition.\n\nUEFA went on: \"It rather underscores a pre-existing shortfall within UEFA's pre-authorisation framework, a technical aspect that has already been acknowledged and addressed in June 2022.\n\n\"UEFA is confident in the robustness of its new rules, and specifically that they comply with all relevant European laws and regulations.\"\n\nFans will 'fight it'\n\nMany football fans fear that a closed, US-style league with no promotion or relegation of clubs will destroy the hopes of glory for smaller teams and the prestige of beloved national competitions.\n\nFootball Supporters Europe (FSE), an umbrella lobby group also spoke out, saying \"since 2021, FSE and fans across Europe have stood firm against a breakaway super league time and time again, and repeatedly called for the greater protection of our game.\n\n\"Whatever comes next, the super league remains an ill-conceived project that endangers the future of European football. FSE, our members, and fans across Europe will continue to fight it.\"\n\nThe case goes back to April 2021, when 12 of Europe's biggest clubs announced they had signed up to the planned Super League, a direct competitor to UEFA's flagship competition the Champions League, which features the most successful clubs from Europe's various national leagues.\n\nThe upstart league quickly fell apart in the face of a strong backlash from supporters and both UEFA and the world body FIFA threatened to take disciplinary action against the clubs involved.\n\nEnglish fans in particular remained loyal to their traditional domestic league model and nine of the 12 rebel clubs - including six from the English Premier League - threw in the towel within 48 hours.\n\nTwo years on, only Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona have stood by the dormant project, with Italian giant Juventus withdrawing in July. Real Madrid's chairman Florentino Perez hailed Thursday's court decision, declaring that: \"European club football will no longer be a monopoly.\"\n\nBut the club's current parent league, La Liga, denounced the Super League idea as \"a selfish and elitist model\".\n\n- AFP\n\nLiverpool destroy West Ham to reach League Cup semi-finals\n\nLiverpool destroyed West Ham 5-1 on Wednesday to set up a League Cup semi-final against Fulham, easing the frustration of their weekend Premier League stalemate against Manchester United.\n\nCurtis Jones scored twice and Dominik Szoboszlai, Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah were also on the scoresheet for Jurgen Klopp's dominant team, who were trophyless last season.\n\nNo team have won more League Cups than Liverpool, who lifted the trophy for the ninth time in the 2021/22 season.\n\nThe Reds had 34 shots against United in Sunday's Premier League match without finding the net, failing to win at home for the first time this season to their intense frustration.\n\nManager Jurgen Klopp said he was delighted with his team's \"joyful football\" as they once again clicked in front of goal against West Ham.\n\n\"We were brave in our positioning, our second ball game was exceptional,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a really, really good performance from start to finish.\n\n\"It is really tough for all of us, there's a lot of games and the boys played a lot of football already.\"\n\nThe much-changed home side, with Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold on the bench and Alisson Becker rested completely, launched wave after wave of attacks, with West Ham struggling to lay a glove on their opponents.\n\nHarvey Elliott blasted over the bar in the 14th minute and Szoboszlai fired wide but the Hungary midfielder gave Liverpool the lead they deserved shortly before the half-hour mark.\n\nIt came after Said Benrahma lost the ball carelessly in midfield, squandering a chance for a rare West Ham break.\n\nJarell Quansah fed Szoboszlai on the right of the Liverpool attack and he let fly with powerful shot from outside the area that flew into the far corner, giving goalkeeper Alphonse Areola no chance.\n\nThe game continued in the same pattern, with West Ham forced to feed off scraps - a familiar feeling for a team who have won just once at Anfield since 1963.\n\nThe home side could have doubled their lead in the final moments of the opening period but Gakpo headed narrowly wide following a fine cross from Elliott.\n\nLiverpool had 11 shots in the first 45 minutes to West Ham's zero.\n\nThe London side also had a clutch of star names on the substitutes' bench, with the impressive Lucas Paqueta and James Ward-Prowse omitted from the starting line-up.\n\nThe second half unfolded in a similar way to the first, with Liverpool probing and David Moyes' men looking toothless.\n\nDarwin Nunez, who started the game without a goal in his past 10 games for Liverpool, got a shot away after wriggling clear in the box but Areola was equal to the task.\n\nHowever, Jones gave Liverpool a buffer in the 56th minute, firing the ball through Areola's legs at the near post.\n\nMoyes threw on Paqueta but Klopp countered by bringing on Salah, Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate.\n\nLiverpool made it 3-0 when Gakpo fired low inside Areola's right-hand post from the edge of the area following Konate's charge forward.\n\nJarrod Bowen pulled one back, cutting inside Quansah and producing a fine curling finish around Caoimhin Kelleher but worse was to come for the hapless visitors.\n\nSalah netted a breakaway goal from Alexander-Arnold's pass and Jones capped a fine night with his second after dancing through the Hammers defence.\n\nLiverpool, who host Premier League leaders Arsenal on Saturday with a chance to leapfrog the London side, will face Fulham in the first leg of the two-legged League Cup semi-final in the week beginning 8 January.\n\nMiddlesbrough will take on Chelsea in the other last-four tie.\n\n- AFP\n\nNottingham Forest appoint Nuno as new manager\n\nNuno Espirito Santo has been appointed as the new manager of Nottingham Forest, the Premier League club announced on Wednesday.\n\n\"Nottingham Forest can today confirm the appointment of Nuno Espirito Santo as first team head coach,\" said a club statement.\n\n\"Nuno joins the club on a two-and-a-half-year contract and will take charge of his first match on Saturday when Forest face Bournemouth at The City Ground.\"\n\nThe 49-year-old Portuguese coach succeeds Steve Cooper, sacked by Forest on Tuesday after a dismal run of one win in 13 Premier League games left the club just one place, and five points, above the relegation zone.\n\nNuno has been out of work since leaving Saudi Pro League club Al-Ittihad in November.\n\nBut he has now returned to English football following a two-year absence since his departure after an ill-fated four-month spell at Tottenham Hotspur which featured a mere 10 Premier League games.\n\nNuno also had four years in charge of Wolves, guiding the club to promotion from the Championship in his first season in charge.\n\nWolves enjoyed consecutive seventh-place finishes in the Premier League and a run to the Europa League quarter-finals under Nuno's leadership.\n\nCooper's exit from the City Ground came with Forest having lost five of their past six games.\n\nThe 44-year-old Welshman led Forest to promotion to the Premier League in 2022, ending a 23-year absence from the top flight for a club twice crowned champions of Europe under celebrated manager Brian Clough in 1979 and 1980.\n\nCooper had retained the support of Forest fans after taking them from the bottom of the Championship to Premier League survival last season.\n\nBut with Cooper's summer of heavy investment in new signings failing to deliver the required results, Forest's Greek owner Evangelos Marinakis finally lost patience with the former Swansea boss.\n\n\"Everyone at Nottingham Forest would like to thank Steve for his superb contribution to our football club. His achievement in guiding Forest back to the Premier League will undoubtedly remain an iconic moment in the club's history,\" Marinakis said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We thank Steve for his dedication and commitment during his time with us, as well as the incredible connection he forged with our supporters and the city of Nottingham.\n\n\"Steve will always remain a friend of the club and will forever be welcome at The City Ground.\"\n\n- AFP\n\nChelsea back from brink to reach League Cup semis\n\nChelsea came back from the brink to reach the League Cup semi-finals with a dramatic penalty shoot-out victory against Newcastle after Mykhailo Mudryk's last-gasp equaliser on Tuesday.\n\nMauricio Pochettino's side were joined in the semi-finals by Fulham, who beat Everton on penalties, and second-tier Middlesbrough, 3-0 winners against Port Vale.\n\nBeaten three times in their previous five games, a wretched run that started with their 4-1 loss at Newcastle, Chelsea showed some much needed fighting spirit to win the quarter-final 4-2 on penalties after a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.\n\nLanguishing in 10th place in the Premier League, Chelsea were two minutes from being knocked out before Ukraine winger Mudryk came to the rescue with the leveller that set the stage for the Blues' shoot-out success.\n\nPochettino's only silverware as a manager is a French league title and domestic cup with Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nChelsea's progress keeps the Argentine in contention for his first trophy in England after he lost the 2015 League Cup final during his time at Tottenham.\n\n\"We are so happy. The fans and the club deserve this sort of feeling. It's a big motivation,\" Pochettino said.\n\n\"We are so young. We are creating a very good bond. This type of result will help us.\"\n\nThe defeat was a painful blow for Newcastle, who failed in their attempt to avenge last season's League Cup final loss to Manchester United at Wembley.\n\nAfter crashing out of the Champions League group stage, Newcastle's exit was another setback for the Saudi-backed club in their bid to land a first major trophy since 1969.\n\n\"It hurts a lot. We defended really well but didn't get over the line,\" Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said.\n\n\"It's a very painful moment for us. We'll just have to accept it and digest it.\"\n\nNewcastle had been gifted the lead by Chelsea's shambolic defending in the 16th minute.\n\nCallum Wilson seized possession inside his own half and accelerated away from Thiago Silva as his lung-bursting run carried him into the Chelsea area.\n\nBenoit Badiashile should have snuffed out the danger, but the defender's woefully miscued attempt to clear allowed Wilson to fire home with ease.\n\nWith 20 minutes left, France forward Christopher Nkunku came on for his Chelsea debut after a prolonged injury absence since his close-season move from RB Leipzig.\n\nTwo minutes into stoppage time, Chelsea forced a shoot-out as Newcastle defender Kieran Trippier made a hash of dealing with a cross, misdirecting his header to Mudryk, who drilled into the bottom corner.\n\nTrippier's misery was compounded when he smashed Newcastle's second penalty wide in the shoot-out.\n\nNkunku converted Chelsea's third penalty in his first significant contribution for the club.\n\nDjordje Petrovic sealed Chelsea's victory as he dived to his left to make a brilliant save from Matt Ritchie's kick.\n\nFulham moved into the semi-finals for the first

first half in Dar es Salaam to inflict a third Group B loss in four matches on the three-time title-holders.\n\nWydad are last on three points with two rounds remaining, behind ASEC Mimosas (10) of the Ivory Coast, Simba (five) and Jwaneng Galaxy (four) of Botswana.\n\nASEC became the first qualifiers for the quarter-finals by beating Jwaneng 3-0 in Abidjan, and Simba will be join them if they can secure four more points.\n\nThe only realistic chance Wydad have of making the last eight is to win their remaining two matches and hope Simba lose one.\n\nSimba visit ASEC in February and host Jwaneng in March while Wydad are away to Jwaneng and at home to ASEC.\n\nWydad have been the second most successful Champions League club after Al Ahly of Egypt from 2016, reaching four finals, two of which they won, and never failing to make the knock-out stage.\n\nThe Casablanca club fired coach Adil Ramzi last weekend and brought back veteran Tunisian Faouzi Benzarti for a fourth spell in charge.\n\nBenzarti is the second most successful African coach in CAF club competitions with five titles - one less than currently unemployed South African Pitso Mosimane.\n\nDecisive ASEC\n\nASEC, whose lone Champions League title came 25 years ago, boast a nursery that has produced many players who went on to achieve fame in Europe, like the Toure brothers Yaya and Kolo.\n\nAmong the stars of the current side is Sankara Karamoko, who scored his fourth goal of the campaign to complete a decisive victory over Jwaneng, who stunned Wydad in matchday one.\n\nLeibe Avo gave the Abidjan outfit an early lead, Essis Aka scored on 80 minutes and Karamoko netted in added time.\n\nVictories for TP Mazembe from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa moved them three

Reds on Tuesday, despite missing the presence of Erling Haaland.\n\nMateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva struck after Marius Hoibraten's own goal opened the scoring as City set up a clash with South American champions Fluminense in Friday's final in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nCity have won only one of their last six Premier League matches and fallen behind Arsenal and Liverpool in the title race.\n\nBut they were never troubled as an unblemished record for European sides against Asian teams at the Club World Cup was extended to 14 games.\n\nHaaland sat out a third consecutive game due to a foot injury, with the Norwegian facing a race against time to be fit for the final.\n\nHowever, Haaland still provoked the biggest cheer of the night from a barely half-full King Abdullah Sports City Stadium when he offered the crowd a wave as he appeared on the big screens during the first half.\n\nKevin De Bruyne was also absent from the City squad despite making his return to training on Monday from a four-month layoff due to a hamstring injury.\n\nWithout their biggest goal threat and creative hub, City lacked penetration and punch for the first 45 minutes despite enjoying over 80 percent of possession against the Asian champions.\n\nUrawa had lost six of their previous 10 games but largely kept the European champions at bay before a self-inflicted blow opened the game up for City on the stroke of half-time.\n\nGuardiola made the surprise call to leave Julian Alvarez on the bench, leaving City without a natural striker in their starting 11.\n\nIt took the Champions League winners 30 minutes to even create a clear sight of goal as Matheus Nunes cut inside and blasted a shot goalwards that Shusaku Nishikawa tipped over.\n\nCity were slowing building momentum towards the break as Phil Foden was next to test Nishikawa from outside the box.\n\nBut they needed a slice of fortune to break the deadlock in first-half stoppage time.\n\nNunes fired a low cross into the box that Hoibraten turned into his own net under little pressure.\n\nAs Urawa tired from chasing the ball in the sweltering Saudi heat, City were then able to cut loose in the second half.\n\nKovacic drilled in his first City goal after racing onto Kyle Walker's pass that cut the Japanese defence wide open.\n\nBoth Kovacic and Nunes have struggled to make a meaningful impact since arriving at the treble winners in the summer transfer window.\n\nNunes should have followed the Croatian's lead by netting his first goal for the club when he headed a glorious chance wide from Jack Grealish's cross.\n\nA third goal for City did not take long to arrive as Hoibraten's bad luck continued when Silva's shot deflected in off the Norwegian defender.\n\nSilva warned of the heightened risk of injury put upon players by a \"crazy\" schedule after FIFA confirmed that the Club World Cup will expand to 32 teams and a month-long competition in 2025.\n\nA hugely one-sided contest did little to whet the appetite for many more matches between Europe's elite clubs and the rest of the world as the financial gulf between the two continues to grow.\n\nEuropean teams are now unbeaten in 21 Club World Cup matches stretching back to 2012.But a comfortable evening did at least offer Guardiola the chance to rest Silva, Foden, Manuel Akanji, Rodri and John Stones for the closing stages.\n\n- AFP\n\nAustralian quicks Cummins, Starc set salary records at IPL auction\n\nAustralian fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins became the most expensive players in Indian Premier League history Tuesday, with franchises dishing out millions of dollars for their services at the glitzy Twenty20 tournament.\n\nStarc, who last played in the IPL eight years ago, made a smashing comeback when he was snapped up by Kolkata Knight Riders for 247.5 million rupees ($2.98 million), setting an all-time IPL auction record.\n\n\"We won, Mr Starc!\" the franchise posted on X.\n\nStarc, 33, broke the record set by Cummins earlier in the day when Sunrisers Hyderabad paid 205 million rupees ($2.47 million) for the World Cup-winning skipper.\n\nBefore Tuesday, England all-rounder Sam Curran was the most expensive player after being bought for $2.23 million last year by Punjab Kings.\n\n\"Pumped to be joining SRH for the upcoming IPL season,\" Cummins, who skipped this year's IPL because of a packed calendar, said in a video posted by the franchise on social media.\n\n\"I have played in Hyderabad a few times and always loved it so can't wait to get started.\"\n\nHyderabad beat Royal Challengers Bangalore in a fervent bidding session for Cummins, to claps and cheers from other franchises participating in the auction, held this year in Dubai.\n\nBoth Australians were key members of the team that led Australia to ODI World Cup victory in November, beating hosts India in the final at Ahmedabad.\n\nCummins had silenced a crowd of nearly 100 000 when he bowled out star batsman Virat Kohli, and was widely lauded for leading Australia to the title.\n\nThe 30-year-old made a previous auction record of $2.17 million when he signed with the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2019.\n\nBoth Starc and Cummins had entered this auction with a base price of $240 000, the top tier at which players can start the bidding for their services.\n\nNew Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell was the third-top player at the auction, grabbed by Chennai Super Kings for $1.6 million.\n\nMitchell, 32, was also one of the breakout stars at the World Cup, scoring two centuries against India - in the group stage and in the semi-final.\n\nBumper salaries\n\nChennai coach Stephen Fleming said Mitchell's performances over the last 18-24 months had \"warranted this type of a price\".\n\n\"He is an unfashionable player, often goes under the radar. With his ability to play spin he is competitive, and he is also a handy bowler.\"\n\nWest Indies star Rovman Powell went to Rajasthan Royals for $890 000 and Travis Head of Australia will play alongside Cummins for Hyderabad after being sold for $818 000.\n\nSouth African paceman Gerald Coetzee was sold to Mumbai Indians for $602 000.\n\nBut up-and-coming New Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra failed to arouse much interest, with Chennai paying an underwhelming $216 000 for his services.\n\nFormer Australia skipper Steve Smith went unsold in the first round, along with fellow wicketkeeper Josh Inglis.\n\nMore than 300 players were up for grabs at Tuesday's auction for the cash-rich tournament, likely to be held from March next year.\n\nThe IPL is a huge earner for Indian cricket and the tournament makes more than $11 billion for the economy each year, according to pre-pandemic estimates.\n\nLast June, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) sold the broadcast rights for the next five IPL seasons to global media giants for an eye-watering $6.2 billion.\n\nMumbai Indians are the richest and most successful side in IPL history, with five titles to their name.\n\nAttracting some of world cricket's top stars with bumper salaries, the pioneering IPL helped make Twenty20 hugely popular, attracting hundreds of millions of viewers and spawning copycat

Percy Tau's Al Ahly to reach Club World Cup final\n\nFluminense advanced to the Club World Cup final after two goals in the final 20 minutes proved enough to beat a spirited Al Ahly 2-0 in Jeddah on Monday.\n\nJhon Arias' penalty broke the deadlock before John Kennedy secured victory over the Egyptian side in the final minute of the 90 in Saudi Arabia.The Brazilians will face either Champions League winners Manchester City or Japan's Urawa Reds in Friday's final.\n\nAl Ahly were left to rue a number of missed chances as the African champions failed to find a way past 43-year-old Fluminense goalkeeper Fabio.\n\nThe last 10 Club World Cups have been won by European sides.\n\nBut if the gulf is growing between Europe's elite and the rest of the world at club level, the gap between South America's best and the rest of the world has narrowed significantly.\n\nTwice in the past three years, the Copa Libertadores winners have failed to qualify for the final and Fluminense could easily have followed suit.\n\nAl Ahly had dumped out a star-studded Al-Ittihad featuring Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Fabinho on their home patch in the previous round.\n\nAnd roared on by thousands of travelling fans from just across the Red Sea, they were the more energetic and enterprising side throughout.\n\nBut Fluminense's wealth of experience saw them over the line.At the age of 40, Felipe Melo became the oldest outfield player in Club World Cup history, while former Real Madrid captain Marcelo won the decisive penalty.\n\nFluminense's best two efforts before half-time both came back off the woodwork from Arias.\n\nThe Colombian international's first sweet strike rebounded off the angle of post and bar before he hit the post from a well-worked corner.\n\nBut Al Ahly should have made their first half ascendency count when Kahraba headed a glorious chance straight at Fabio.\n\nThe chances continued to come and go for the Egyptians after the break.\n\nKahraba fired too close to Fabio before the veteran 'keeper denied Emam Ashour.Al Ahly were made to pay for that profligacy when a rare moment of quality from Marcelo lured Percy Tau into a mistimed challenge inside the box.\n\nMohamed Elshenawy saved a penalty from Benzema in the quarter-finals, but this time was beaten by Arias' accurate spot-kick into the bottom corner.\n\nTau had an immediate chance to make

goal.\n\nKennedy, whose goal won the Copa Libertadores final against Boca Juniors last month, then showed the poise Al Ahly had been missing in front of goal by coolly turning inside his marker and

last 16, from which the meeting of last season's runners-up Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid appears the standout tie.\n\nPep Guardiola's City, who are looking to retain the title they won in Istanbul last June, will be expected to comfortably get the better of the Danish side, who qualified from their group at the expense of Manchester United after beating the Red Devils 4-3 at home.\n\nInter, the Serie A leaders, were one of the teams to avoid after finishing second in their group and their meeting with Atletico will see Diego Simeone, the coach of the Spanish club, come up against a team with whom he spent two years as a player in the late 1990s.\n\nFrench champions Paris Saint-Germain, who have gone out in the last 16 in each of the last two seasons and in five of the last seven campaigns, were also braced for a tough draw having come second in their group behind Borussia Dortmund.\n\nThey will therefore be relieved at being handed a tie against Real Sociedad, who topped their section above Inter but are appearing in the Champions League last 16 for the first time since 2003/04, when they were knocked out by Lyon.\n\nBarcelona's meeting with Italian champions Napoli is another standout tie, while Arsenal will be expected to get the better of Porto.\n\nBayern Munich will be strong favourites against Lazio and record 14-time European champions Real Madrid will also be heavily fancied against RB Leipzig.\n\nThe other tie sees Dortmund come up against PSV Eindhoven, who are coached by former Borussia manager Peter Bosz and are through to the last 16 for the first time in eight years.\n\nThe first legs will take place in mid-February with the return matches in March.This season's Champions League final will be staged at Wembley in London on June 1.\n\nChampions

December events, the first competitive golf for the 15-time major winner since April ankle surgery.\n\nWoods, who turns 48 later this month, had not played since the Masters eight months ago before placing 18th of 20 in the Hero World Challenge two weeks ago.\n\n\"A lot of things are aching a lot more than my ankle, which is the way it goes,\" Woods said.\n\n\"I'll be able to walk and play. We've been working out hard, been able to recover.\"\n\nOn Sunday, he and 14-year-old son Charlie Woods combined to shoot 61 and grab a share of fifth at the PNC Championship in Orlando, Florida.\n\nThey finished on 19-under 125 in the parent-child pairs event to stand six strokes adrift of German winner Bernhard Langer and his son Jason.\n\nWoods had struggled to walk four rounds after severe leg injuries suffered in a 2021 car crash but has said he plans to compete once a month next year thanks to a strong fitness recovery.\n\n\"We've been training every day, which is great,\" Woods said. \"It has been nice to knock off a lot of the rust and some of the doubt I've had because quite frankly I haven't hit a shot that counted in a long time.\n\n\"So having to post a score and hit shots on the right number, hit shots with consequence, it has been nice.\"\n\nWoods says his surgically repaired right ankle, which once had him limping through rounds at majors, is no longer such an issue.\n\n\"The ankle was fine because it's now fused but other parts were definitely aching,\" Woods said.\n\n\"The fact we were able to train right away and get after it, and start hitting balls, it was encouraging.\"\n\nWoods is not exempt for next year's US Open, but the three-time US Open champion would likely receive an exemption.\n\n\"As of right now, no, I'm not in,\" Woods said. \"Whether or not I have to formally ask them or they invite me or give me an exemption or I have to go qualify, who knows? I don't know what the process is.\"\n\nWoods said his comeback events have boosted his confidence that he can still strike the golf ball competitively with the world's best.\n\n\"If I'm able to practice and do the things I know I can do, and prepare, I know I can still do it,\" Woods said.\n\n\"I can still hit the golf ball. It's just a matter of prepping and get enough reps in and get enough work in and being right physically, and endurance capability of it.\n\n\"I haven't had the leg good enough where I've been able to compete and play a lot of rounds.\"\n\n- AFP"
