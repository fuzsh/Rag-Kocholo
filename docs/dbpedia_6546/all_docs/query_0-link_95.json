        "text": "WORLD CUP winner Juninho still insists winning the League Cup with Middlesbrough meant more.\n\nAnd he still “adores” a baked bean as well as his beloved Boro as he prepares for an emotional return to England.\n\nWonderkid Osvaldo Giroldo Junior arrived on these shores in 1995 as a relative unknown.\n\nBut soon the 5ft 5in magician captured the hearts of not only the Riverside but the whole of the Premier League.\n\nAnd he fell for English football so much that he wishes he never left - hence why he came back to Boro TWICE!\n\nNow the 51-year-old has left his wife and daughter in order to return to his “second home” for the latest chapter in his love affair with Teesside with his 21-year-old son Lucas who was born there.\n\nThat will be when he appears at a special night-with-the-fans at Stockton Globe, hosted by The Red Radio, on Thursday - but not before a trip to the local James Cook hospital to show his 21-year-old son Lucas, who has accompanied him, where he was born.\n\nIt is a story that began 29 years ago after he had scored a Brazil-iant free-kick against England in the Umbro Cup at Wembley.\n\nBoro boss Bryan Robson, who was Three Lions No.2 to Terry Venables, knew instantly that he was watching something special.\n\nAnd he and chief executive Keith Lamb managed to shock the world by beating some of the biggest clubs in Europe to the then 22-year-old’s signature by splashing out £4.75m to Sao Paulo.\n\nOLYMPICS FREE BETS - SIGN UP OFFERS AND DEAL FOR PARIS 2024\n\nFollowing a Brazilian carnival at his official unveiling in front of thousands of supporters, an assist on his debut against Leeds ensured it was love at first sight for both fans and the star.\n\nBut Juninho had to put “newspaper inside my boots” to try and get them warm as he struggled to acclimatise to the North East weather initially while the food was another issue.\n\nHe soon started to, and still does, “adore baked beans,” admitting: “The food was very different. It was a different kind of cooking. But it was nothing that we could not adapt to.\n\n“I had my mum with me the first time and by the third time my wife was with me.\n\n“Everyone was at home and they were cooking so the food was not that much of a problem for me.\n\n“But it’s true, I really liked the baked beans. Especially on a breakfast.”\n\nAnd the Premier League soon had a real appetite for him.\n\nAside from his magic ball skills and despite his slight stature, Juninho showed a heart of a lion in duels with the likes of hardman Julian Dicks and an infamous finger-wagging stand-off with 6ft 3in Phillipe Albert in a Tyne-Tees derby against rivals Newcastle.\n\n“I was always very competitive on the field,” he told Sun Sport looking back on the row with the big Belgian.\n\n“To be honest, I can’t remember what had happened between us, it’s obviously been some argument. But, to be honest, I’ve never been afraid of anyone on the field.”\n\nHowever, just as the love affair was getting into full-swing, heartbreak was in store.\n\nThe 1996/97 season, in which he was voted Premier League Player of the Year, saw Boro relegated after being deducted three points for falling to play a game at Blackburn.\n\nAnd to rub even more salt in the wound, they suffered defeat in both the League Cup and FA Cup Finals.\n\nAnd after 17 goals in 74 games, Juninho departed to Spain to join Atletico Madrid in order to try and ensure he made Brazil’s World Cup squad the following summer.\n\nLiverpool contacted his father and Manchester United were also keen, but he says both deemed him “too expensive” as the numbers they offered were “much lower” than Atletico’s.\n\nHe joined Atletico for £13m - a decision he says he still regrets to this day.\n\n“I went to a big club in Atletico in Spain as I was worried about the 1998 World Cup in Brazil.\n\nMiddlesbrough had been relegated and I didn’t think that I would have much chance of being in this squad but I should have stayed in England to be honest.\n\n“I was in love with the country and English football and felt at home.\n\n“I should have maybe gone elsewhere in the Premier League and gone back to Boro the next season when they got promoted.\n\n“That’s nothing against Atletico, I had a good time there, but if I could choose today, then I’d have stayed in England.”\n\nJuninho suffered a broken leg that ultimately ruled him out of France ‘98 and, to help him return to top form, he made an emotional return to Boro on loan during the 1999-2000 season.\n\nBut it was two years later that he finally fulfilled every aspiring footballer’s dream - winning the World Cup.\n\nAnd he celebrated that triumph in Japan and Korea by rejoining Middlesbrough permanently under Steve McClaren for £6m.\n\nAlthough he never replicated the performances of his first stint, it proved to be third time a charm as he played a huge role in securing the club’s first, and so far only, trophy.\n\nJuninho claimed that lifting the 2004 League Cup, saying: “I always said this title means a lot to me, especially when you feel a real part of winning the title.\n\n“In the World Cup I played in four games then I was out and then I played the last few minutes in the final.\n\n“With the Middlesbrough title I could feel more involved in the games.”\n\nSo, does he still feel the same way two decades later - you betcha.\n\n“Yes,” he says without a pause. “It is most important to win titles but when you play a direct role in the success then it means a lot, just like in that League Cup.\n\n“That is what I came to Middlesbrough for - to win trophies. It means a lot to me. It was such a special achievement in my career.”\n\nHowever, he still has one major regret and still feels some resentment towards McClaren over not being able to complete one final goal at Boro.\n\nAt the start of the following season, Juninho was told that he no longer figured in the manager’s plans and he was eventually sold to Celtic before Boro had kicked off their Uefa Cup campaign.\n\nWhen asked if he still holds a grudge against the former England manager today, he replied: “Yes, I was very upset.\n\n“It was my dream to help Middlesbrough get to and then play in Europe as well as winning trophies.\n\n“But they put the pressure on me to leave. He told me that I wasn’t going to play every weekend. That’s when Celtic came in and I made my mind up to go there.\n\n“Nothing against Celtic, who are an absolutely huge club and where I had a good time, but I should have held on and fought to stay at Middlesbrough.”\n\nJuninho went on to return to Brazil and, after a season in Australia at Sydney FC, he retired at Ituano in 2010.\n\nBut his football journey was not over there as he became the latter’s president for the next decade.\n\nThe man affectionately known as the Little Fella then replaced Edu after his departure to Arsenal as the Brazil national team co-ordinator in 2019.\n\nHe held that position for four years but is now back at Ituano “to finish the job”."
