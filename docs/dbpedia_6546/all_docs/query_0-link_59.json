        "text": "4: Popular late 1980s-early 1990s player Perry Cotton earnt his All Whites call-up after a stint with English Fourth Division side Scunthorpe United. He was well-known for being on the end of teammates’ jokes, telling one 1992 match-day programme: “I don’t mind at all as long as it lifts the lads.”\n\n5: Goals scored by Phillip Hill in the side’s 11-0 hammering of Carterton in a first-round Chatham Cup clash in 1976. It was to be the club’s single-match scoring record in the Chatham Cup and league formats in the first 10 years of the club’s history.\n\n6: There were six months of deliberations until Napier City and Napier Rovers merged, creating the new club for the 1973 season. The club’s first decade history publication wrote: “It was immediately hailed as the best thing to have happened in Hawke’s Bay soccer. The advent of a ‘superteam’ would enhance Hawke’s Bay’s standings in central league and consequently lift soccer standards in the province’.”\n\n7: Seven top-flight British clubs chased the signature of future popular recruit David Jackson: Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Middlesborough, Crystal Palace, West Bromwich Albion, Bradford City and Manchester United. He eventually signed with Manchester United and played against Benfica as a teen. He signed with Napier City Rovers in 1983.\n\n8: In Harry Clarke’s first eight seasons for Napier City Rovers, the man nicknamed ‘H’ played a staggering 176 of the club’s 183 Central or National League fixtures.\n\n9: Nine records were set in the 1979 Central League Division Two; including successive wins (17), least goals conceded (5), biggest league winning margin (12 points), most wins in a row without conceding a goal (7).\n\n10: Napier City Rovers entered the big time, the National League in their 10th season. Pre-season, legendary coach Roger Wilkinson said “it would be a disaster for the Hawke’s Bay region” if the club was relegated after its first season. The side finished ninth out of 12 teams.\n\n11: The number of league wins secured in the 1975 season, when the club won the Central League Division Two, their first major triumph.\n\n12: Virginia-born JC Mack clocked up 12 games in his first season with Napier City Rovers in 2020. Two years earlier he had made his international debut for U.S Virgin Islands. He is still playing internationally for them and has also captained the side which is currently ranked 208 out of 211 Fifa-recognised nations.\n\n13: Napier City Rovers’ biggest Chatham Cup win in their first two decades was an impressive win, thumping fellow Napier-based club 13-0 in 1983. Their biggest cup loss was 9-1 to Gisborne in the same season.\n\n14: Paul Halford was Napier City Rovers’ top-scorer on their way to the 1993 Superclub national league final, with 14 goals.\n\n15: First-choice goalkeeper Oscar Mason was aged just 15 when he made his debut in 2020. Last year he earnt his 50th cap and also made the New Zealand Under-19 team that won the Oceania qualifying tournament for this year’s Under-20 World Cup.\n\n16: Lance Bauerfeind became a schoolboy sensation in his debut first-team match for Napier City Rovers in 1981. Aged just 16, he made his debut against Taradale after gaining a dispensation from his school Karamu High School and scored a hat-trick.\n\n17: In their 17th season, Napier City Rovers were crowned National League champions, winning the 1989 title. Then Napier mayor Alan Dick said it was “the most significant Hawke’s Bay sporting achievement since the Ranfurly Shield era”.\n\n18: Englishman Mark Morris joined Napier City Rovers aged just 18 in 1981. He had previously been an apprentice at Wimbledon. Morris later returned to the UK where he played more than 200 senior games for Wimbledon, including in all four divisions. He also played top-flight English football for Watford.\n\n19: The 1975 team – headed by player-coach John Roberts who hailed from Liverpool – conceded just 19 goals on their way to winning the Central League Division Two title. The team lost only one of their final 10 league games.\n\n20: All Whites star Shane Smeltz was in top goal-scoring form in 2002, being the National League top scorer with 20 goals. Napier City Rovers team-mate Chris McIvor was third in the National League golden boot stakes, scoring 12 goals.\n\n21: The playing number on the 1998 Scotland World Cup shirt proudly hanging in the Napier City Rovers clubrooms which had been issued to former Napier City Rovers player and coach, and Scotland goalkeeper, Jonathan Gould.\n\n22: Goals scored by the Mick Waitt-coached All Whites in the 2002 Oceania Nations Cup before they toppled the Socceroos 1-0 in the final. The Englishman had initially joined Napier City Rovers as a player in 1990, before then going on to being a highly successful and popular coach at the club.\n\n23: The number of players who scored hat-tricks in the first decade of the Napier City Rovers. The list includes Roy Stanger who has captained and coached the club, as well as now being on its board.\n\n24: What seemed like the initial decision to merge Napier City and Napier Rovers lasted just 24 hours. The merger was set to happen in June 1972 – under the new name Napier City United – but was shelved after the majority of Napier Rovers’ players revolted against it.\n\n25: Martin Akers’ senior career spanned 25 years, during which time he became the club’s highest-capped player, with more than 300 first-team games for Napier City Rovers. Akers played one full international for the All Whites and also played for Wellington Olympic, Central United and across the Tasman for Wollongong City.\n\n26: The 26th letter of the alphabet – Z was said to have temporarily “jinxed” Napier City Rovers in 1983. That year the club signed a $5000 deal with Suzuki – the club’s most lucrative at the time. But a string of poor home results, and injuries, led one Napier clairvoyant to claim the letter Z in the sponsors’ name had put a “hex” on the club.\n\n27: AFC Bournemouth scored 27 goals during their eight-match tour of New Zealand in 1982. Newly-promoted to England’s Third Division, the side managed just a 2-1 win over Napier City Rovers. The match was played at McLean Park and attracted a crowd of 5088.\n\n28: Life member Colin Stone wrote another chapter in Bluewater Stadium’s history when he got married on the playing pitch in 2018, 28 years after being appointed as the club’s general manager. He first arrived at the club in 1982 from his previous role as a promotion’s executive with English club Wimbledon FC.\n\n29: Longtime and popular player Terry Parkin had a double celebration when he turned 29 early in the 1983 National League. Not only did club mates toast his birthday, but they also celebrated with him his 150th first-team appearance.\n\n30: Almost three decades of service to the club saw Roy Stanger being made a life member in 2003. The club said in a match-day programme: “Your contribution, like all our life members in making Napier City Rovers the best club in New Zealand cannot be denied.”\n\n31: The whopping difference in goals scored by 1989 National League champions Napier City Rovers to bottom-placed team Papatoetoe was 31.\n\n32: Harry Clarke was aged 32 when he became Napier City Rovers’ highest-capped player in 1993, overtaking Terry Parkin’s previous record of 227 first-team matches. Clarke joined the club in 1984 and scored more than 20 league and Chatham Cup goals in his record-breaking season.\n\n33: The victorious 1985 Chatham Cup final was later dubbed ‘Greg Brown’s Final’. The match was one of the Englishman’s 33 matches in New Zealand – for both Napier City Rovers and Miramar Rangers. He went on to play for both the All Whites and later the Socceroos.\n\n34: English import Paul Fishenden was in the process of helping Crewe Alexandra to promotion in the old British Third Division 34 years ago. He played for Napier City Rovers in 1981, during a loan period during his 75-match, 1980-87, stint at Wimbledon FC.\n\n35: The path to the top of the table of the 1979 Central League Division Two title was near-perfect for Napier City Rovers. The team finished with 35 competition points – from 17 wins and one draw – out of a possible 36 had they won all 17 games.\n\n36: Hastings-born goalkeeper Mark Paston played 36 internationals for the All Whites between 1997-2013; including being the penalty-saving hero in the home and away 2010 World Cup qualification eliminator against Bahrain. Paston, who debuted for Napier City Rovers in 1997, played in all three of the All Whites’ eventual World Cup pool play draws.\n\n37: Gary Parker – number of goals scored by Scottish import in the 1986 Central League – which Rovers won by 15 points and a 57-goal for-against record. Parker later played rugby for Scotland A against the All Blacks, including scoring his side’s only try.\n\n38: Coach Bill Robertson donned his boots at the age of 38 in 2022 during the National League. A modern-day stalwart of the club, he has played more than 150 first-team matches and during his player-coach career guided Napier City Rovers to two Central League titles (2015 and 2018) and the 2019 Chatham Cup victory.\n\n39: New recruit and former Manchester City academy member Deri Corfe scored nine goals during his 39-game stint with FC Tucson in America’s third-tier USL League One. He previously played for New York Red Bulls II – the MLS side’s reserve team.\n\n40: It took just 40 seconds for the 1995 Mick Waitt-coached Rovers team to open the scoring in a Superclub triumph against Manawatū.
