        "text": "Euro 2024 reached its climax in thrilling fashion as Spain overcame England 2-1 with a late goal from Mikel Oyarzabal and a late goalline clearance from Dani Olmo to lift the trophy\n\nNico Williams gave Spain the lead early in the second half, before Cole Palmer equalised for England - after which Oyarzabal and Olmo's heroics ended Spain's 12-year wait for a major international trophy\n\nESPN's By The Numbers brings you best stats from all the Euro 2024 final:\n\nSpain 2-1 England\n\n4\n\nSpain won their fourth European Championship title - now the most by any nation, going past Germany (3). Spain have also now won 4 consecutive finals at major tournaments since losing to France in EURO 1984 (EURO 2024, EURO 2012, 2010 World Cup, EURO 2008)\n\n1\n\nEngland became the first team ever to finish runner-up in consecutive European Championships (lost in a penalty shootout to Italy in the last tournament).\n\n58\n\nEngland's ongoing 58-year title drought is by far the longest among former FIFA World Cup champions. The next-highest was Italy going 29 years without a major international trophy (1938 FIFA World Cup - 1968 Euros), followed by Argentina's 27-year drought (1993 Copa America - 2021 Copa America).\n\n7\n\nSpain extended their Euros win streak to a record 7 games - to become the first European team to go 7-0-0 at a major tournament. Spain are level with 1934-38 Italy (at the FIFA World Cup) for the longest win streak at a major tournament by a European team (only other teams to go 7-0-0 at a major tournament are 2002 Brazil men and 2019 USA women at their respective World Cups)\n\n15\n\nSpain scored 15 goals at this tournament, overtaking 1984 France for the most in a single tournament\n\n12\n\nDani Carvajal and Nacho join an elite club as players to have played in and won the UEFA Champions League Final and UEFA EURO Final in the same season. They are the 11th and 12th men have played in and won the title in both finals in the same year (must have appeared in both winning finals).\n\n1 and 4\n\nLamine Yamal became the first player to score or assist in Quarterfinals, Semifinals and Final of a single European Championship. He made four assists at the tournament, including 3 in the knockout stage. The assists in the KO stages of this EURO tie 2020 Dani Olmo and 2020 Luke Shaw for the most by a player at a single tournament since 1980 (availability of data).\n\n1\n\nYamal also became the youngest player (17y, 1d) to feature in the final of a FIFA World Cup or UEFA European Championship - breaking the record set by Pele in 1958 (17y 249d when playing in 1958 WC final against Sweden).\n\n20y 2d\n\nNico Williams (aged 20 years, 2 days) became the second-youngest player to score a goal in the European Championship final after Italy's Pietro Anastasi scored in 1968 at 20 years, 64 days\n\n2\n\nMikel Oyarzabal's 86th minute winner off the bench was the second-latest game-winner (regulation time) in EURO final history (after Horst Hrubesch for West Germany in 1980)\n\n1\n\nLuis de la Fuente became the first manager to win the Euros, U-19 Euros and U-21 Euros (Mikel Merino and Unai Sim√≥n have featured in all of those teams with de la Fuente)\n\n3\n\nHarry Kane finished as the joint-leading goalscorer in this Euros (3)\n\n0/5\n\nKane has failed to lift the trophy in all 5 finals he's played for club and country (0 goals, 0 assists, 1 shot on target in those games and no shots in each of his last 3 finals).\n\n1\n\nThis was the first time that Spain won a major title and a major tennis final (Carlos Alcaraz) on the same day. (Rafa Nadal also won Wimbledon in 2008 and 2010, when Spain won the EURO and WC)\n\n13\n\nSpain (12, now 13) and England (13, now over) entered the final on two of the four longest unbeaten streaks in European Championship history"
