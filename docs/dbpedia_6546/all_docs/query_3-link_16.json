        "text": "CHICAGO – U.S. Women’s National Team head coach Tom Sermanni has named 24 players to a training camp roster, including Red Stars forward Christen Press, for the USA’s upcoming matches against China PR on April 6 at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colo. (3 p.m. MT), and on April 10 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego (8 p.m. PT).\n\nPress, who was allocated to Chicago earlier this year, has been a member of U.S. Women’s National Team since April of 2012, and was an alternate for the 2012 Olympic Team. In 2013, Press became the first American to claim the Golden Boot award in Swedish league Damallsvenskan with 23 goals for club Tyresö FF.\n\nTickets for the U.S. match in Colorado are on sale through ussoccer.com, by phone at 1-866-461-6556 or 303-534-6119 (Monday-Saturday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. MT; Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. MT), at all Dick’s Sporting Goods locations in Metro Denver, at the Dick’s Sporting Goods Park ticket office (open Monday-Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.) and the Pepsi Center box office (open Monday-Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.).\n\nTickets for the match in San Diego are on sale through ussoccer.com, by phone at 1-800-745-3000 and at all Ticketmaster ticket centers throughout the San Diego area (including many Walmart stores). [Note: Tickets are not sold at Qualcomm Stadium except on the day of the event.]\n\nTwenty-two of the 24 players, including Press, were with the USA at the 2014 Algarve Cup in Portugal. Sermanni added forward Katie Stengel, a former Wake Forest star, who was a member of the USA’s 2012 FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup championship team. Stengel was most recently with the U.S. Under-23 WNT for the Six Nations Tournament in La Manga, Spain, where she scored against Norway in the final match to help the USA secure the title. She becomes the seventh player from the 2012 FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup champions to earn a call-up to the senior side.\n\nMidfielder Lauren Holiday, the 2013 National Women’s Soccer League MVP, returns to the roster after missing the Algarve Cup due to a family commitment, but forward Alex Morgan and defender Crystal Dunn are still not sufficiently recovered from ankle injuries.\n\nSermanni will name 18 players to suit up for each of the two matches that will be the final international games before the start of the second season of the NWSL, which kicks off April 12.\n\nU.S. Women’s National Team Roster – (Detailed Roster)\n\nGOALKEEPERS (3): Jill Loyden (Sky Blue FC), Alyssa Naeher (Boston Breakers), Hope Solo (Seattle Reign FC)\n\nDEFENDERS (9): Stephanie Cox (Seattle Reign FC), Whitney Engen (Tyresö), Meghan Klingenberg (Tyresö), Ali Krieger (Washington Spirit), Kristie Mewis (Boston Breakers), Kelley O’Hara (Sky Blue FC), Christie Rampone (Sky Blue FC), Becky Sauerbrunn (FC Kansas City), Rachel Van Hollebeke (Portland Thorns FC)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (7): Morgan Brian (Virginia), Tobin Heath (Pairs Saint-Germain), Lauren Holiday (FC Kansas City), Carli Lloyd (WNY Flash), Samantha Mewis (UCLA), Heather O’Reilly (Boston Breakers), Megan Rapinoe (Seattle Reign FC)\n\nFORWARDS (5): Sydney Leroux (Seattle Reign FC), Christen Press (Tyresö/Chicago Red Stars), Amy Rodriguez (FC Kansas City), Katie Stengel (LA Blues), Abby Wambach (WNY Flash)"
