        "text": "Polish Football Association is the largest and one of the oldest Polish sports associations. The founding convention of Polish FA took place on 20 and 21 December 1919 in Warsaw. During the meeting, the Statute of the association was created and approved. Its authors were Józef Lustgarten, Jan Polakiewicz and Jan Weyssenhoff. The first president of the Association was Dr. Edward Cetnarowski, a famous Cracovia activist, and the first headquarters of the Polish Football Association was located in Cracow. Year later, regional football associations began to form.\n\nIn 1920, there were already four regional associations: in Cracow, Lviv, Poznan and Lodz. Football was becoming increasingly popular in the country by the Vistula River.\n\nAfter the success of Polish clubs, the time has come for the national team. The Bialo-czerwoni, led by Kazimierz Górski, won the Olympic gold medal in Munich (1972), silver medal in Montreal (1976) and a medal for third place in the finals of the World Cup in Germany (1974). Tomaszewski, Deyna, Gadocha, Lato, Szarmach, Kasperczak, Gorgoń - those names were known all the world! This success was not properly exploited. The silver medal of coach Górski’s team in 1976 in Montreal was considered as a failure, and the distinguished coach gave way to Jacek Gmoch. To this day, football supporters wonder why the Bialo-czerwoni did not succeed at the World Championships in Argentina in 1978, having - seemingly - the strongest lineup in the history of Polish football. This year was not successful, not only because of the failure of the national team. The Polish Football Association president Edward Sznajder died in a car accident. The football by the Vistula River sank deep into crisis.\n\nIn the least expected moment, when the country was under the martial law, the national team, under the leadership of Antoni Piechniczek, bounced back and brought the bronze medal from the Spanish World Cup. The Polish squad went to the next World Cup, but a positive result was out of reach, and afterwards, according to the \"curse\" by Zbigniew Boniek – the Poles would not be taking part in the finals of the biggest football event for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1988, Polish FA announced further reforms in the league. The Ekstraklasa was supposed to include 14 teams, the second league – 18 teams, and the third league - 64 (divided into four groups).\n\nOn the 8th of June 2012 Poland drew with Greece 1:1 in the inaugural game of the UEFA Euro 2012. Robert Lewandowski scored the only goal for the white-and-reds. On June 12, Poland drew with Russia 1:1 in the second match of Euro with Jakub Błaszczykowski, team’s captain, netting for Polish side. In the last game, which was to decide on the qualification for the quarter-finals, Polish National Team lost to Czech Republic 0:1 in Wroclaw.\n\nOn the 10th of July 2012 the board of the Polish Football Association selected a new Polish National Team head coach. Franciszek Smuda was replaced by Waldemar Fornalik, former coach of Ruch Chorzów.\n\n25th of September 2012 president Grzegorz Lato stated that he will no longer be a candidate for reelection. “Everybody expected changes so they should be happy to hear my decision. I believe that what I am doing is for the best for the PFA, as well as for Polish football.”\n\nAnother major football event will take place in Poland! Tuesday's UEFA Executive Committee meeting officially endorsed the candidature of the PGE Narodowy stadium in Warsaw as the venue for the UEFA Super Cup match. The winner of the Champions League will face the victor of the Europa League for the prestigious trophy in Poland in 2024.\n\nThis is proof of the great trust that UEFA has placed in us. We are a reliable and proven partner for the entire European football community. We are very pleased that in 2024 we will be able to organise another final of such a prestigious competition in Poland. The whole world will be watching the clash between the winner of the Champions League and the winner of the Europa League. This is certainly a great success for the Polish association. The organisation of such events is one of our goals, which we consistently pursue, said Cezary Kulesza, President of the Polish Football Association.\n\nIn the past, Polish stadiums have twice hosted competitors in the UEFA Europa League final. The first of these took place in 2015 at the PGE Narodowy in Warsaw. Back then, LaLiga team Sevilla FC beat Ukrainian club Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk 3:2 after a thrilling match. The scorer of one of the goals was Grzegorz Krychowiak.\n\nIn 2021, the European cups arrived in Poland again. The UEFA Europa League final took place at the Polsat Plus Arena in Gdańsk, with Villarreal CF competing against Manchester United. There was no shortage of emotions - after regulation time and extra time, the score was 1:1, and everything had to be decided in penalty shoot-out. The Spaniards were more effective shooting from the 12 yard spot, winning against the English 11:10.\n\nLet us recall that in the 2024/2025 season, another Polish stadium will also host the European cup final. In June 2023, the UEFA Executive Committee decided that the Tarczyński Arena in Wrocław will host the final match of the Europa Conference League. – This is a very good period for us. The European Under-21 Championship and the U-20 World Cup are over, and still, in addition to the European Conference League final and the UEFA Super Cup match, the European Women's Under-19 Championship awaits us. It is rare that the organisation of so many international events is entrusted to the same association. This makes us prourd, added Łukasz Wachowski, Secretary General of the Polish Football Association."
