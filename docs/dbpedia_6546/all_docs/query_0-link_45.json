Onuoha went off injured after the three substitutions had been made, leaving England to play with only nine fit men for the last twenty minutes of extra time, with Taylor limping through the remainder of the game and even scoring in the shootout which, at 32 kicks, was the longest ever in a UEFA competition. Because England ended the match with ten players, six players from each side were required to take two penalties each, but both goalkeepers opted to take one.
