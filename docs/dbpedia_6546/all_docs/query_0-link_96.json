        "text": "Everything you need to know about Nigeria’s rising track star Favour Ofili, including her Age, Height, Olympic Games record, Medals, Accomplishments, Personal Bests and How Rich she is in 2024.\n\nFavour Ofili background\n\nFavour Ofili is a promising young Nigerian sprinter who has quickly risen through the ranks in the 100m and 200m events.\n\nKnown for her exceptional speed and potential, she has already made a significant impact on the global athletics stage, with a key highlight of her career being the bronze medal she won at the 2021 World Under-20 Championships in the 200m.\n\nAdditionally, she holds the African record for the indoor 200m and the Nigerian record at the U20 level and the Nigerian’s potential was further showcased when she became the first female National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) athlete to run sub-11s with a time of 10.93 in April 2022.\n\nOfili represented Nigeria at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nFavour Ofili Profile\n\nFull name: Favour Chukwuka Ofili\n\nBirth date: December 31, 2002\n\nNationality: Nigerian\n\nPlace of Birth: Port Harcourt, Rivers, Nigeria\n\nState of Origin: Delta\n\nAge: 21 years old (As of August 2024)\n\nPersonal Bests: 10.93 (100m), 21.96 (200m) — Indoors: 7.15 (60m), 22.11 (200m)\n\nCollege: University of Port Harcourt, Louisiana State University\n\nNet worth: $900,000\n\nInstagram: @ofili.fa\n\nX: @FavOfili\n\nHow old is Favour Ofili (Favour Ofili Age)\n\nFavour Ofili was born on December 31, 2002. She is 21 years old as of August 2024.\n\nFavour Ofili Height\n\nFavour Ofili is 5 feet 7 inches tall. In centimetres, the Nigerian is 170cm tall.\n\nFavour Ofili State of Origin\n\nFavour Ofili may have been born in Port Harcourt but is from Delta State.\n\nFavour Ofili 100m\n\nWhile Favour Ofili has typically shone in the 200m, her 100m feats are also admirable.\n\nThe Nigerian’s 10.93 personal best in the distance came in 2022, and while the rising star stormed to a 10.78 time at an LSU Invitational in April 2024, threatening Blessing Okagbare's national record of 10.79s, an excessive wind reading meant her 2022 time remains her official best.\n\nFavour Ofili 200m\n\nDespite showing excellence in the 100m and 400m, the 200m brings out the best in Favour Ofili.\n\nThe burgeoning athlete not only won gold medals in the 400m distance at the African Youth Games in 2018 and African Youth Championships in 2019, but she has flourished in the 200m as well, underscored by a gold medal in the 2019 Youth Championships in Abidjan and claiming a bronze medal in the 2021 World Athletics U20 Championships in Nairobi.\n\nThe Nigerian’s 22.23 time, which claimed bronze behind Namibian pair Christine Mboma (21.84) and Beatrice Masilingi (22.18), was the third-fastest ever by a U20 runner in the world.\n\nSince the 2021 Championships in Nairobi, Ofili has run a career-best 21.96 in the 200m in April 2022 — eclipsing Blessing Okagbare's 14-year record and becoming the first female NCAA athlete to run under 22 seconds in the 200m in a collegiate season — and claimed a silver medal at the Commonwealth Games in August 2022 after finishing behind Jamaica's Elaine Thompson-Herah (22.02).\n\nHowever, Ofili (22.51) notably pipped Mboma (22.80) a year after the Namibian got the better of her at the World Youth Championships in Nairobi.\n\nAfter Olympic disappointment in Tokyo, Ofili ran a season-best 22.03 time in her semi-final heat at the Paris 2024 Games to advance to the 200m final and give Nigeria her best shot at clinching a medal since Mary Onyali claimed bronze in the 200m event at Atlanta 1996.\n\nUnfortunately, the talented sprinter could not circumvent being placed in the ninth lane, as she ended sixth, leaving her distraught afterwards.\n\nDespite the disheartening climax, the youngest competitor in the final being .04 seconds away from a podium finish suggests that the rising star's best is yet to come.\n\nFavour Ofili Olympics\n\nA teenage Favour Ofili should have competed at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in 2021, only for that dream to be crushed after 10 of Team Nigeria's 23 athletes did not meet minimum testing requirements.\n\nThree years later in Paris, another blunder threatened to undermine Ofili's debut at the Games, as the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) did not register the rising star for the 100m event, leading to the Nigerian’s impassioned post across her social media accounts.\n\n“It is with great regret that I have just been told I will not be competing in the 100 meters at this Olympic Games,” read Ofili’s post. “I qualified, but those with the AFN and NOC failed to enter my name.\n\n“I have worked for 4 years to earn this opportunity. For what….to not be entered and compete at the Olympic Games because the responsible organisation failed to enter me?\n\n\"Please remember, in the last Olympic Games I was not able to compete because AFN, NADC and NOC failed to release funds for athletes in the USA to be tested, which made 14 Nigeria athletes that qualified not compete. Now THIS……..If those responsible are NOT held accountable for taking this opportunity from me, neither organisation can EVER be trusted in the future!”\n\nDespite fears over her participation in the 200m, Ofili competed and advanced to the final where she had a shot of clinching Nigeria's first medal at the 200m event in 28 years but finished outside the podium places in sixth.\n\nShe will compete in the 4x100m relay event.\n\nFavour Ofili Medals and Accomplishments\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nBirmingham 2022\n\nSilver (200m)\n\nAfrican Games\n\nRabat 2019\n\nGold (4x400m relay), Silver (400m)\n\nWorld Athletics U20 Championships\n\nNairobi 2021\n\nGold (4x400m relay), Bronze (200m, 4x100m relay)\n\nAfrican Youth Championships\n\nAbidjan 2019\n\nGold (200m, 400m)\n\nAfrican Youth Games\n\nAlgiers 2018\n\nGold (400m)\n\nFavour Ofili Personal Bests\n\nIndividual\n\n60m: 7.14\n\n100m: 10.93\n\n200m: 21.96, 22.11 (Short Track)\n\n300m: 35.99\n\n400m: 51.49\n\nTeam\n\n4x100m Relay: 42.22\n\n4x400m Relay: 3:28:84, 3:29.69 (Short Track).\n\n4x400m Mixed Relay: 3:24:28\n\nFavour Ofili Net Worth\n\nAccording to sources, Favour Ofili has an estimated net worth of $900,000, reflecting her embryonic career earnings as an athlete.\n\nFavour Ofili Social Media\n\nFavour Ofili runs active Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) accounts and is active on both.\n\nThe Nigerian sprinter has 44,200 followers on Instagram and a follower count of 14,600 on X as of August 2024."
