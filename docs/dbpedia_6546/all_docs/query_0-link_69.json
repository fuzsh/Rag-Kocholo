        "text": "TF-Images/Getty Images\n\nIf there's one club not short on history, memories and great moments in the UEFA Champions League, it's Real Madrid.\n\nThey have won more European Cups than any other side, and factoring in just the Champions League era they are the current team to beat, with three titles in the last four seasons and becoming the only team to retain the trophy.\n\nThe finals come on neutral venues, but along the paths to success there have been some incredible nights played out at the Santiago Bernabeu; matches that left the fans jubilant, confident and proud of their team.\n\nHere we run down the 10 most memorable nights under the lights in Spain's capital city, with Real Madrid's best Champions League-era moments on home soil.\n\n10. 2-0 vs. Grasshopper Club Zurich, 1995\n\nDenis Doyle/Associated Press\n\nThe first Champions League victory should always hold a special place in the memory banks, and for Real Madrid that perhaps means even more since they weren't in the first tournaments after the changed format.\n\nA victory over Swiss side Grasshopper Club Zurich came courtesy of an Ivan Zamorano brace and welcomed Champions League football to the Bernabeu in style.\n\nThis was the first home group-stage game the stadium had hosted, as only one side per nation entered at the time, and Barcelona had been the dominant force in Spain.\n\n9. 3-0 vs. Galatasaray, 2001\n\nMARC ALEX/Getty Images\n\nIn 2000/01, the format was still a case of group stage and then straight to the quarter-finals—and Real Madrid were struggling against Galatasaray, 3-2 down after the first leg despite having originally worked a two-goal lead.\n\nBack on home soil, fans got to witness a memorable comeback, the sort of story which can live long after the event, as Real swarmed all over their Turkish opponents and emerged with a 3-0 victory.\n\nRaul scored twice and Ivan Helguera grabbed another, and Real Madrid marched on.\n\n8. 2-0 vs. Borussia Dortmund, 1998\n\nClive Mason/Getty Images\n\nSemi-finals can be tense, nervous affairs, but they are also extremely exciting for supporters with the sense of anticipation and buildup.\n\nThe first leg against Borussia Dortmund in 1998 was everything Real could have hoped for; cagey but with quality and end product on their side, resulting in a 2-0 victory over their German rivals.\n\nFernando Morientes and Christian Karembeu did the damage, before a 0-0 draw in the return saw Real through to the final where they beat Juventus.\n\n7. 4-0 vs. Tottenham Hotspur, 2011\n\nJasper Juinen/Getty Images\n\nHaving suffered a lean period in the previous campaigns when they were beaten by the likes of Roma, Lyon and Liverpool to miss out on the quarter-finals, they finally made it back to the last eight and faced an exciting Tottenham Hotspur side that had vanquished AC Milan in the previous round.\n\nThe Bernabeu had long demanded improvement by this point, but here they finally got it: a walloping 4-0 win, all but guaranteeing passage to the semi-finals at the halfway point in the tie.\n\nEmmanuel Adebayor's early goal set the tone, and the Togolese striker scored another before Angel Di Maria and Cristiano Ronaldo wrapped things up.\n\n6. 3-1 vs. Manchester United, 2003\n\nPAUL WHITE/Associated Press\n\nOne of the most memorable ties in Champions League history, Manchester United came to the Bernabeu as one of the more feared sides in Europe in the early 2000s.\n\nReal Madrid promptly tore them apart.\n\nThe quarter-final first leg ended up 3-1 to Los Blancos, Luis Figo and a Raul brace hitting the goals, and the home fans were delighted in the panache and exuberance shown by their Galacticos—setting up a tremendous second leg that ended 4-3 to United, and 6-5 to Real on aggregate.\n\n5. 2-0 vs. Bayern Munich, 2000\n\nRoss Kinnaird/Getty Images\n\nAnother semi-final for Real Madrid, and once more it was German opposition who blocked their path to the final.\n\nBayern Munich couldn't hold back the white tide, though, and the Bernabeu witnessed a redemption of sorts for Nicolas Anelka, troubled all season long but scorer of the opening goal just a few minutes in, before a Jens Jeremies own goal doubled the lead.\n\nTravelling back to Bavaria for the second leg was never going to be easy, but Real fans left the Bernabeu in high spirits, full of confidence after the clean sheet—and so it proved, as the team went through 3-2 on aggregate before beating Valencia in the final.\n\n4. 3-0 vs. Borussia Dortmund, 2014\n\nDenis Doyle/Getty Images\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's side had impressed throughout the competition in 2013/14, but Dortmund were the first big test of the knockout stage with their fast-paced football and talented attack.\n\nReal Madrid were pretty good too, though, and wiped the floor with BVB thanks to strikes from Gareth Bale, Isco and Ronaldo.\n\nThe three-goal cushion proved necessary as Dortmund mounted a spirited comeback in the second leg, but Real held out and went on to the semis and final, where they beat Atletico Madrid in Lisbon.\n\n3. 3-0 vs. Wolfsburg, 2016\n\nMike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nNow under Zinedine Zidane's rule, Madrid were expected to cruise past Wolfsburg in the quarter-finals but suffered a shock 2-0 defeat in the first leg in Germany. In truth, it could have been far worse.\n\nLos Blancos rallied at home for the second leg, though, spurred on by a Ronaldo brace inside 20 minutes—the deficit was wiped out and Real were back on level terms.\n\nThe fans believed the improbable could happen, and it duly did: Ronaldo completed his hat-trick 15 minutes from time and Real strode on to the last four, where they saw off Manchester City to meet, and beat, Atletico in the final for the second time in three seasons.\n\n2. 2-0 vs. Bayern Munich, 2002\n\nShaun Botterill/Getty Images\n\nOne year earlier, Bayern had knocked holders Real Madrid out of the Champions League. Die Roten went on to win the tournament—and now Los Blancos faced them again.\n\nIf revenge was on the cards, the late stages of the first leg would have left Real feeling cold; two late Bayern strikes meant they led 2-1 heading back to the Bernabeu.\n\n1. 1-1 vs. Barcelona, 2002\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nReaching the final would have been sweet enough, but to deny your greatest rivals at the same time? That is priceless.\n\nTwitter.com/karlmatchett"
