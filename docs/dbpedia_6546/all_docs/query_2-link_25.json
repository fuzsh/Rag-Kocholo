        "text": "Women's football is flourishing off the pitch as much as on the pitch.\n\nIn 2018, Visa became the first ever UEFA sponsor dedicated to women's football, following the unbundling by UEFA of sponsorship rights from the men's game.\n\nThe sponsorship offers an exciting platform to champion diversity and inclusion and underlines Visa's commitment to celebrating and supporting women's football at all levels.\n\nThe partnership with UEFA also demonstrates Visa’s ongoing global commitment to enabling powerful sporting moments as shown by our long-term partnerships with FIFA, the Olympics and more recently the Confédération Africaine de Football (CAF).\n\nAs women's football continues to thrive, Visa's partnership with UEFA supports efforts to change the image of the women's game and make football the No. 1 sport among girls and women in Europe.\n\nVisa encourages worldwide advocacy for equality in sports\n\nAs a brand and a business, Visa stands for making a positive and transformational impact on the world.\n\nThe long-term goal is to make women's football accepted equally, everywhere. This means that there is such a balance in coverage, empowerment and training that the game becomes a level playing field.\n\nAcceptance does not start or stop with gender - it's diverse, equal and inclusive. Visa is advocating for the widest sense of acceptance - from the field to the boardroom - because we believe that when more of us play, all of us win.\n\nWe want women's football to inspire a cultural shift - one that better accepts, supports and praises equality, throughout Europe. For both the current, and next generation of women.\n\nVisa is proud to be a seven-year long sponsor of UEFA Women's Football, which allows us to further our contributions to the movement for equality, diversity and inclusion."
