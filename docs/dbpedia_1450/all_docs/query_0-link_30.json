        "text": "It’s hard to have sympathy for the modern day Premier League footballer. Brash, cosseted, occasionally removed from both the average football fan and indeed reality, and of course overpaid.\n\nIn a recent article for the Football Pink, Harry Dunford made a cogent argument that modern footballers are absolutely overpaid and that the notion that any top level footballer should automatically be a millionaire and are worth such inflated salaries is a myth. As he noted “In the Premier League alone, where the average wage is around £30,000 per week, how many players really put in a performance week in week out that demands that salary?”\n\nHe goes on to add that “This is of course scandalous, a player such as Glenn Whelan, for example, shouldn’t be paid £50,000 per week just because the state of football says the top talent are paid £100,000.” He’s not alone in holding this viewpoint. In fact, Irish football pundit Eamon Dunphy was moved to comment on Glenn Whelan’s earning prowess, sneering of Whelan that “He drives two Ferraris; I think he’s a very lucky lad to have 50 caps for Ireland,” Dunphy would later climb down on his pronouncements after Glenn Whelan went on to challenge Dunphy’s remaks by comparing his career to that of the former Millwall man saying:\n\nI have played 50 times for my country, played at the European Championship finals, played in the Premier League for a long time, played in Europe for two clubs, played in an FA Cup final.\n\nAnd in fairness to Whelan he has a point, he’s played over 200 games at Premier League level and played in Europe. He’s maintained a first team place under a number of disparate managers when many more overtly talented players have failed to hold down a starting place in the Stoke first XI yet, doesn’t it still seem strange that such an unglamorous footballer should own a Ferrari? Surely such cars are the preserve of continental superstars and not just a midfield workhorse in the Potteries.\n\nYet if BT and Sky are willing to pay £5.1billion to secure Premier League TV rights then who should share in this wealth? Harry suggests in his piece, not unreasonably that we all collectively drank the Sky TV Kool-Aid and have been “conned into paying for television subscriptions” which in turn funds the bloated salaries of average footballers. While we could collectively cancel Sky TV subscriptions this, however, ignores a crucial point, that while a British (or indeed Irish) Premier League fan may become turned off from “The best league in the world TM” football is now a truly globalised game, the overseas TV rights for the Premier League have now risen to almost £3billion. For every disillusioned fan in Manchester or Birmingham there are a legion of willing subscribers in other countries.\n\nThe viewership of the Premier League (and to a growing but still lesser extent La Liga, Bundesliga and other major leagues) is now global and so is the breadth of sporting talent that the Premier League can call upon – so are these players worth their wages? While Glenn Whelan may not be a marquee name he’s remained playing at a consistent level for a number of years in one of the most viciously competitive sporting meritocracies on the planet. Harry states that “players much further down the talent spectrum within the Premier League are still paid ridiculous amounts of money in relation to their talent” which put me in mind of Nick Hornby’s musings about the hapless Arsenal player Gus Caesar: “To get where he did, Gus Caesar clearly had more talent than nearly everyone of his generation… and it still wasn’t quite enough”. Gus Caesar turned out for Arsenal in the 80s when the majority of the players in the English top flight were British with a few Irish and the odd Dane or Dutchman thrown in. Today, because of the massive scouting networks pioneered in part by the likes of Arsenal and the huge wealth available to Premier League clubs, the talent net can be cast ever wider. Gus Caesar never had to compete against the best talent scouted in Africa, South American and Asia, not to mention all of continental Europe to get an Arsenal squad place, nor were Arsenal at the time richer than the likes of Juventus and AC Milan as they are now. But Glenn Whelan does have to compete in this modern reality, Stoke are signing players from Barcelona for God’s sake. There is an argument that even getting a squad place in a Premier League side has never been as difficult or competitive.\n\nWhen one thinks of a league so financially dominant one might think of Serie A in the 80s and 90s, yet even that league’s great era didn’t dominate as extensively. There was still greater wage parity between leagues at the time, for example the stars of Brazil’s great 1982 side, Zico, Socrates and Falcao did end up playing in Italy but as mature players who made a decision to leave their domestic game. Today such talent would have been snatched up after a season or two in the Brasileirao. The same is true of European league hierarchies; today a team like Newcastle United, who finished in fifteenth place last year, can snap up a player like Georginio Wijnaldum from PSV. That’s former European Cup winners PSV, Dutch champions who had the opportunity to play Champions League football this year but were out-muscled by a club that in recent years have more experience flirting with relegation than the Champions League. Thus, if even non-elite teams can afford to compile such an array of talent then shouldn’t the players should be recompensed accordingly?\n\nThe other main point is that if the players are not to be paid the “millionaire wages”, then where does or should the billions generated by TV deals and sponsorship go?\n\nShould Roman Abramovich just start adding to his art collection? Should Real Madrid, rather than pay huge salaries to Ronaldo, Benzema, Ramos and Co. plan to build more theme parks in Abu Dhabi? Simply put, as football becomes more global in appeal and the elite clubs and leagues become better at generating revenue, then where does this money end up? From a personal point of view I would rather it would go to the athletes on the field who do the most to popularise the game rather than into the pockets of directors, shareholders or oligarchs. Football has always been a game of the masses and in particular the working classes which is where the majority of players still come from. For young boys and men growing up in areas of disadvantage, football offers the chance (albeit a very slim one) of reward and financial security. In a classist society where further education can still seem to be the preserve of the elite, professional football seems one of the only routes of class mobility, one of the only opportunities available to have both the esteem of a community and financial wealth.\n\nWhen English football had a maximum wage up to 1961 it did not result in great investments or improvements elsewhere in football. The stadium disasters of the 1980’s at Valley Parade and Hillsborough both bear witness to a legacy of massive underinvestment in stadiums in those previous decades, club chairman certainly never gave any great thought to fan comfort or safety when they were paying their players £20 a week but still getting tens of thousands through the turnstiles.\n\nIn his piece Harry makes the point that while players like Messi and Ronaldo through their exceptional talent may be somewhat more justified in their massive salaries, but that this raises the bar so that other, lesser players expect far more commensurately. To go back again to the pre-1961 era just look at the example of Fulham’s entertainer chairman Tommy Trinder who publicly proclaimed that star player Johnny Haynes was worth £100 per week. Never adverse to some free publicity, when the maximum wage was abolished, Trinder duly gave Haynes a contract worth £100 a week. However, when teammates like Maurice Cook and Alan Mullery looked for improved deals they were told they could leave the club if they weren’t happy with the contracts that were a fraction of what Haynes would earn. Lest we forget football is a team sport, while stars like Messi gain the plaudits he doesn’t win trophies alone and it would hardly be fair if he earned several multiples of the salary of say Jordi Alba or Ivan Rakitic.\n\nPerhaps the focus should be less on the well paid, mostly working class young men of football, but on how, despite their massive increase in revenue English football clubs in particular have failed to reduce ticket prices, or to improve pay for other workers at their clubs, perhaps issues like these are the more worthy targets of fan frustration. From my point of view, as a football supporter in a country with a much smaller league where many players are part-time and even the very few well paid professionals would not earn more than €2,000 per week, my concern is the ever-growing, cavernous wealth disparity between leagues. I read an article recently that referred to Anderlecht as “minnows” and had a friend’s brother ask me who Club Brugge were when they played Manchester United recently. I would never have traditionally viewed these clubs (who have competed in and indeed won trophies at high levels in Europe) as “minnows”. That is to say nothing of the likes of PSV and Ajax having the cream of their talent picked off by middling teams from wealthier leagues. In the last Forbes football rich list, West Ham and Newcastle were both in the top 20 richest clubs in the world but previous European Cup winners like Benfica or FC Porto weren’t anywhere to be seen.\n\nFor me that small minority of well-paid players who play in that small minority of super wealthy leagues deserve to share in the wealth that their endeavour creates. Their position in the game can still be tenuous with injury, capricious managers and the sheer level of unending competition from players around the world who want to take their place. Achieving a fairness and balance in the game is about a lot more than how much Glenn Whelan gets paid.\n\nOriginally poster on the Football Pink – August 2015\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLast year’s World Cup in Brazil conjured up images in the imagination of the European football fan of head-tennis on Copacabana beach, the voluminous bowl of the Maracana, the glorious canary yellow jerseys of the Seleção. The ideas and notions we hold about South American football help create comforting stereotypes of the Brazilian jogo bonito, Argentinians being fabulously unpredictable in their dribbling and their temperament, all spinning in that interior mental carousel of sun-drenched blues, whites and yellows blanched in the Mexican heat of 1970 or 86, Carlos Alberto’s fourth against Italy, Maradona’s hand of god.\n\nThese idealised, mythologised notions of South American football that tend to dwell the minds of British and Irish fans did not begin, however, with the World Cup of 1970 but long before, initial interest being piqued by the exceptional displays of the great Uruguayan sides of the 1920s and ’30s. The first chance, however, that British and Irish fans got to see of South American footballers in the flesh was way back in 1933. It was the first time that a South American side had ever visited Ireland or Britain – they came from the land of the Andes and the Pacific. This is an attempt at their story, and the story of the team they would encounter on an October afternoon on the north side of Dublin City.\n\nThe side that was to visit Ireland was a select squad made up, not of Brazilians, Argentinians or Uruguayans but of players from the Peruvian and Chilean leagues. With the squad being dominated by players from the Lima based Universitario side, with reinforcements from Alianza Lima (the Peruvian champions at the time), Atlético Chalaco also of Peru, and Chilean side Colo-Colo. The team went by a number of names such as the Combinado del Pacífico and the less evocative Peru-Chile XI.\n\nColo-Colo were among the first sides who had embarked on a European tour a few years earlier in 1927 which was funded by the Chilean Department of Education as part a diplomatic and educational exercise that saw them take on Spanish sides, Atletico Madrid, Real Union and Barcelona. The tour would end in tragedy as Colo-Colo’s star player and club founder David Arellano died from peritonitis brought on by a rough challenge he received during a game. With this in mind it is perhaps understandable that only three Colo-Colo players would travel as part of the Combinado side. Much like Colo-Colo had done in 1927 the Combinado would also journey to Spain, however their first port of call for a game on this side of the Atlantic was Dublin and Dalymount Park, and their rivals would be Bohemian Football Club.\n\nBohemians were at the time strictly amateur and would remain so for another 40 years. The Combinado were titular amateurs back in South America but were provided with “tips”, sinecures and other payments (for example a teenage Lolo Fernández’s first contract was worth 120 soles a month, approximately €450 by modern values), they were however officially paid to take part in their European tour, and paid with good reason. Although teams like Colo-Colo, Nacional, Boca Juniors and others had previously toured Europe, the Combinado’s itinerary was truly immense by comparison with any earlier visiting side.\n\nTheir journey began in Panama with a win over local side Colón, then a trip to the idyllic Caribbean island of Curaçao and a comfortable 7-0 win in September of 1933 before departing for Europe, where, in total they would play games in Ireland, Scotland, England, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Germany, France, Italy and Spain with the players finally returning home in the Spring of 1934. The results of the Combinado were mixed to say the least, there were victories over the likes of OGC Nice, Sparta Rotterdam and a selection of smaller Spanish sides and credible draws with Slavia Prague, Saint Etienne, Italy’s Pro Vercelli and West Ham.\n\nThere were however defeats to the likes of Celtic, Newcastle United, Bayern Munich and a 10-1 drubbing at the hands of a Madrid XI. In fairness to the Combinado this defeat in Madrid wasn’t helped by the fact that on the same day, half the squad, under the name “Chile-Peru” were losing 4-1 to Barcelona in their Les Corts stadium, while the remainder, playing under the title “All Pacific” were playing a combined Madrid side in the Chamartín arena. This was a Madrid side that featured the legendary keeper Ricardo Zamora of Real Madrid, while Atletico Madrid’s Julio Antonio Elícegui grabbed a hat-trick against the unfortunate South Americans.\n\nAlthough the touring sides’ fortunes varied there is no doubt that there were players of genuine quality in their ranks. In goal was Alianza Lima’s Juan Humberto Valdivieso, the Peruvian national team goalkeeper at the 1930 World Cup, 1936 Olympics and 1939 Copa America. Nicknamed “El Mago” (the magician) he was renowned for his speciality at saving penalties, while during a game for Alianza after star forward Villanueva went off injured, Valdivieso took his place in the attack and proceeded to score seven goals in an 8-1 victory over Sporting Union.\n\nContemporary reports would describe him as one of best goalkeepers in all of South America and Valdivieso’s exceptionalism would continue through the generations; his son Luis is the current Peruvian Finance Minister while his grandson, a swimmer also named Juan Valdivieso followed in his grandfathers’ footsteps and competed at a Summer Olympics in both 2000 and 2004, something the grand old goalkeeper lived long enough to witness. Valdivieso’s Alianza club-mate on the tour was Alejandro Villanueva, who was nicknamed “Manguera” (Fire-hose) in recognition of his many outrageous moves on the pitch, indeed so well-known was he for his bicycle kicks that he was apocryphally attributed with the creation of that move. Rather than “Fire-hose” The Irish Independent preferred to give him the sobriquet of the “Peruvian Dixie Dean”. A veteran of two Copa Americas, one World Cup and the 1936 Olympics, Villanueva did not enjoy his erstwhile team-mates longevity, dying of tuberculosis in 1944 at the age of just 35. In testament to his enduring popularity and scoring exploits Alianza rechristened their stadium in 2000 as the Estadio Alejandro Villanueva almost 60 years after his death.\n\nThe Bohemians line-up from a 1932 trip to France\n\nAlthough Alianza were represented by these two stars the majority of the squad as mentioned were from Universitario, to date Peru’s most successful club, winning 26 league titles and coming runners-up in the Copa Libertadores in 1972. Brightest among their firmament of stars was the young striker Teodoro “Lolo” Fernández. The famous Chilean sports journalist Renato González Moraga would praise the completeness of his game calling it as both “functional and beautiful” and describing Fernández as capable of striking a ball with ferocious power with both feet, being dangerous in the air, and capable of hitting precise long range passes to split open defences. History would know him as Universitario’s record goalscorer, a distinction he held for the Peruvian national team (with 24 goals) for over 30 years until his record was beaten by the current holder Teófilo Cubillas.\n\nHe would be the star player six years after his Dublin visit when he inspired Peru to their maiden victory in the Copa America in 1939; “Lolo” would end the tournament with the best player award and as the top scorer with 7 goals. Like Villanueva he was honoured by his club who played their home games in the Teodoro Lolo Fernández stadium from the 1950s all the way up to 2000. Although at the time of his visit to Dublin, The Irish Press’ correspondent, going under the bye-line of “Socaro” merely described the young striker as “a newcomer to big matches” but a “player of great promise”. He would be joined on the tour by his older brother and fellow Peru international Arturo.\n\nMany of the touring players were young men like Lolo Fernández, players in their early 20s who were only developing the reputations that would later bring them fame. There were, however a handful of more seasoned players, nine of the squad including Valdivieso, Villanueva and Arturo Fernández had been part of Peru’s 1930 World Cup squad, as had midfielder Plácido Galindo who had the dubious distinction of being the first player ever sent off in a World Cup finals. Several of the younger members of the squad would form the core of the Peruvian team that would journey to Berlin to compete in the 1936 Olympics, while the Fernández brothers, Valdivieso and midfielder Carlos Tovar would be part of the Peru squad that would lift the Copa America in 1939.\n\nDespite the obvious talents available to the Combinado and the interest created by this exotic side Bohemians were certainly not to be underestimated as opponents. The Bohs were in the middle of one of their most dominant eras, twice champions in the late 20′s the 1933-34 season would yield yet another league title under the shrewd tutelage of Bill Lacey, a versatile former player of both Everton and Liverpool. Lacey had won two league titles with Liverpool in the 20′s and had been part of the pre-partition Irish side that had won the Home Nations Championship in 1914. After his playing days he moved into coaching at Bohemians and also coached the National team of the Irish Free State on a number of occasions throughout the 30s, including a 5-2 victory over Germans in 1936. Bohs had also had some success on European tours of their own; they had won the Acieries d’Angluer tournament in Belgium which included the likes of Standard Liege in 1929, while also playing regular challenge matches in Dublin which included a draw with French side Stade Francais a matter of months before the visit of the Combinado.\n\nBohemians also included in their ranks a number of Irish internationals such as Fred Horlacher, Jack McCarthy, goalkeeper Harry Cannon and others such as Paddy O’Kane, Billy Jordan and Plev Ellis who would receive their debut caps within the following couple of years. Horlacher, the son of a German immigrant, Pork-butcher, bore some comparisons with his Peruvian counterpart Villanueva. Like Villanueva he was an exciting, versatile attacker, he was also a talented all-round sportsman, representing Ireland at Olympic level in Water Polo and was a fine amateur tennis player and golfer.\n\nSadly also like Villanueva he would pass away prematurely, dying a year before the Peruvian in 1943 only a month after finishing his career with Bohemians. A reminder that life in 1930s and 40s, even away from combat could be still be brutally short even for the fit, young sportsmen. Another member of the Bohemian side who had won representative honours was Johnny McMahon, born in Derry he was defender who also had an eye for goal, and was the last Bohemian player to be capped by the IFA when he was selected for a game against Scotland in Glasgow earlier in 1933. A league winner with Bohs in 1927-28 and 1929-30 the game against the Combinado would be one of his last for Bohemians after injuring his knee in that same match.\n\nThe game itself took place on Sunday October 1st 1933 in front of a full house of over 30,000 at Dalymount Park. The build-up to the game had seen the press tout the Combinado as clear favourites; with The Irish Times noting ominously that “It would be too much to expect Bohemians to overcome them”. Most contemporary reports at the time had been much taken with Uruguay’s earlier footballing successes in the 1924 and 28 Olympics, as well as their World Cup win in 1930 and the image of the skillful and exciting South American footballer was gaining a foothold in the popular imagination.\n\nAn example of this attitude can be seen in The Irish Times in one of its previews of the game. It would highlight the significance of the encounter and go as far as to call the match:\n\nThe principal event in Free State [now Republic of Ireland] football during the first half of the season…[and that] The South American Republics have taken to Association football as a duck takes to water, and their game now is obviously of a very high standard, since Uruguay has come through very strong opposition to win the last two Olympic tournaments.\n\nThis is the first visit of a South American team to the British Isles, and intense interest centres on it, since Spain and Austria have shown themselves capable of challenging English and Scottish supremacy at the game. The visitors are setting out to demonstrate that football in South America is of as high a standard as it is anywhere else.\n\nOur friend “Socaro” in The Irish Press indulged himself so far as to say that the match was “of world-wide interest”, a most uncommon situation for a football match taking place in Dublin at the time. He further stated that the travelling side “must at least consider that they can teach us a thing or two of the art of football”. It’s clear from the reports that the match had created quite a stir, with the main papers devoting significant column space to previews of the match, including pen-pics of all 21 South American players who would make up the Combinado squad, with special mention of Valdivieso, Villanueva and Chilean international Eduardo Schneeberger, of whom much was expected.\n\nThe sole negative note in the coverage of the South American’s visit was The Irish Independent’s decision to reprint a cartoon caricature of the Alianza player Villanueva; the black striker is depicted with all the stylized grotesquery one might associate with 1930′s representations of people of colour. To further enforce the significance of their visit the South American party were afforded a Civic welcome from the Lord Mayor of Dublin, while it was noted that “Many public men, including Foreign Consuls have intimated their intention of being present” at the game. A band had been booked to play as a warm-up act for an hour before kick-off and “in order to follow the game with greater interest an official programme” was to be put on sale.\n\nThe teams lined out as follows: Bohemian F.C: Harry. Cannon (gk), Aloysius Morris, Jack. McCarthy, Paddy O’Kane, Johnny McMahon, Fred Horlacher, Plev Ellis, William Dennis, Ray Rogers, Billy Jordan, John O’Dempsey\n\nPeru-Chile: Juan Valdivieso (gk Alianza Lima), Alfonso Saldarriaga, Antonio Maquilón (both Atlético Chalaco) Alberto Denegri, Vicente Arce, Eduardo Astengo (all Universitario) Roberto Luco (Colo-Colo), Lolo Fernández (Universitario) Alejandro Villanueva (Alianza Lima) Carlos Tovar (Universitario), Eduardo Schneeberger (Colo-Colo).\n\nThe media had predicted a convincing win for the Combinado and it was the South Americans who duly struck first after “twenty five minutes of even play Denegri sent Luco away”, the pace of the Chilean getting beyond the Bohemian defence and though his shot was blocked it fell into the path of 20 year old Carlos Tovar who had an easy finish. Their lead, however would only last ten minutes, Bohemians’ Plev Ellis upon receiving the ball, cut inside his man and was able to fire in a cross, Valdivieso who would pull off a string of miraculous saves throughout the game missed the ball which fell kindly for Billy Jordan who tapped it into the empty net.\n\nIn the second half Bohemians attacked strongly but were somewhat hamstrung by the serious injury to defender Johnny McMahon about twenty minutes from time. This injury, which as stated would ultimately cause the premature end of McMahon’s career, forced a reshuffle, with Ellis moving back to right-half and Paddy O’Kane going in at centre-half. In a time before substitutions McMahon was compelled to hobble about out on the wing for the remainder of the game. As Bohs attacked more Valdivieso was forced into a number of saves and Eduardo Astengo had to clear from the goal-line on one occasion, though great praise was also reserved for the efforts of Harry Cannon in the Bohemian goal. Nevertheless, in the closing minutes the Combinado were presented with a chance to win the match but Villanueva shot wide from 6 yards out with only Cannon to beat.\n\nThe “interesting and exciting” game would finish 1-1 and Bohemians could reflect positively on their result in front of the bumper crowd who had just gained their first glimpse of South American footballers in the flesh.\n\nVillanueva of all those on show provoked most comment, as a centre forward he was described as a “different conception of that position from British players. Instead of waiting well up the field for the ball to come to him he chases it all over the field”, he is several times described dropping deep and “feeding the wings with skill and precision”. Such descriptions would put one in mind of the type of role, variously described in the modern game as a deep-lying forward or False nine but being executed decades before the likes of Hungary’s Nándor Hidegkuti or even Man City’s Don Revie would popularise the position.\n\nPathé newsreel footage of the game can be found here.\n\nVillanueva’s performance was somewhat representative of the teams’ style of play; while the reporters watching the game could not fathom his roaming about the pitch similarly they struggled to describe the style of play of the South Americans in general. “Socaro” noticed that they preferred to use their toe when playing as opposed to their instep and that though the Combinado were “adepts in controlling the ball…and with a fine sense of positional play [they]…failed badly in the matter of scoring goals” and that the “fine movements” and build-up play were wasted by their seeming reluctance or inability to finish off such pretty moves. The Irish Times correspondent concurred to an extent stating “they have speed and control the ball well, but… the forwards had not sufficient fire and dash near goal”. Bohemians for their part seemed to have set themselves up to play a counter-attacking game, sitting deep and trying to break quickly on the counter early on, while attacking with more confidence in the second half. “Socaro” despaired of this tactic which he dubbed disparagingly the “Wait and See” approach and went on to bemoan the “little or no charging” in the game.\n\nThis view of Peruvians as being a tad too elaborate in their play was not solely the view of the Irish media but one with more common currency. Uruguayan writer and journalist Andreas Campomar described how the sociologist Aldo Panfichi referred to the footballing neurosis of Peru as being the “history of near misses” with Peru producing great players and displays but being undone by individual overindulgence or by refereeing or bureaucratic interference.\n\nIn either case the Peruvian public could console itself that the team had played well, deserved to win but had been undone by others. In other words, the moral victory that so many Bohemians fans will be familiar with. Perhaps the most famous example of this neurosis in Peruvian footballing history would occur just three years after the match with Bohemians and featured many of the same players.\n\nThe Peruvians went into the 1936 Berlin Olympics with high hopes for victory, which were enhanced after they comfortably dispatched Finland 7-3 in the opening match, Fernández getting 5 of the goals.\n\nIn the following game versus Austria, Peru would go two goals down before rallying and drawing level to take the game to extra time. Although the Peruvians had the ball in the back of the net five times in the course of extra time the Norwegian referee only awarded two of them. But for Peru that seemed to be enough. They left the field believing themselves to be 4-2 winners. Austria however protested, arguing that the game had been unlawfully interrupted after spectators had come onto the field during extra time to celebrate one of the Peruvian goals; one such spectator was even reputed to have carried a pistol onto the field of play. The Austrians further alleged that one of the spectators had kicked one of their players and that these events caused a “decrease of the fighting energies of the team”. A rematch, which was due to be played behind the closed doors, was ordered but the Peruvians refused to turn up which resulted in a walkover victory for Austria.\n\nJuan Valdivieso in action for Peru against Austria in the 1936 Olympic Games\n\nThe whole Peruvian Olympic team withdrew from the Games in protest, Colombia did likewise as a gesture of fraternity with their neighbours while other Central and South American nations expressed their solidarity with the Andean Republic. Austria would end up going through to the final but would only collect the silver as they were defeated 2-1 by Italy. Back in Lima the German consulate had its windows smashed while the general population of Peru convinced themselves (with no supporting evidence) that Nazi Germany, sympathetic to Austria had rigged the Olympics to deny Peru the gold medal that was destined to be theirs.\n\nThat the touring South Americans should have chosen Dublin as the venue of their first game in Europe might seem a mite strange to modern readers there are a number of reasons as to why this might not be as unusual as it first appears. There was a strong appetite from both Ireland and Peru to test themselves in International competition. Mountainous Peru on the shores of the Pacific was far more geographically isolated that than Brazil or the nations of the River Plate. Apart from the Chileans football in neighbouring states like Columbia and Bolivia was still developing, and despite the tragedy of David Arellano’s death the tour to Spain by Colo-Colo had help put football in this part South American on map.\n\nIt was obvious that competitive games against European opposition could provide Peru and Chile with quality opposition as well as boosting the image of the nations abroad. This was similarly the case for the Irish Free State. As The Irish Times noted at the time the “Free State football season suffers from a lack of representative matches, which makes it difficult to assess the true value of the play seen here” which showed how the nascent Free State association faced the same type of challenges as their South American counterparts.\n\nThere was of course the still raw topic of the 1921 split of the Dublin-based Football Association of the Irish Free State (which would later become the FAI) from the Belfast based IFA, credibility on a global stage was something that the fledgling organisation craved and was something that the touring South Americans could offer. As well as being the home of Bohemians, Dalymount Park was also home to the Irish Free State’s national team and staging the first game of the tour in Dublin was quite a coup for both Bohemians and for FAI General Secretary Jack Ryder.\n\nIt is also worthy to note that sports fans of 1930s Dublin were as big a bunch of event junkies as their modern counterparts. A glamorous touring side in a gala friendly could put bums on seats, over 30,000 of them in Dalymount Park; an attractive venue, and at the time one of the best stadiums in Ireland which had recently been upgraded by the famous stadium architect Archibald Leitch. Such were the crowds in attendance that surviving newsreel footage shows some hardy souls standing on the roof of Dalymount’s main stand to gain a better view. The gate receipts for the Dublin game were a very healthy £900 compared to the £250 taken in Belfast when Glentoran F.C. hosted the Combinado the following day.\n\nFinally there was also an odd Irish connection with the Combinado that may have secured Dublin as the first venue for a game in Europe. The tour organiser/manager was one Jack Gubbins (or John Alejandro Gubbins Pastor) to give him his full name, a Peruvian businessman who along with Colo-Colo president Waldo Sanhueza helped to organise and finance the venture. Mr. Gubbins could trace his family back to Woodstown, County Limerick where his ancestor Joseph Gubbins had settled after arriving in Ireland as a Captain in Oliver Cromwell’s New Model Army. Generations later it was from Limerick that Jack’s father had departed for Peru where the Gubbins family thrived upon their arrival, being especially successful in the rubber industry. An uncle of Jack’s; a John Russell Gubbins had been a director of the Peruvian Amazon Company, rubber manufacturers who had been castigated in the early part of the 20th Century by none other than Sir Roger Casement due to their barbarous practices towards the native Putumayo Indians who worked for the company.\n\nAs Casement commented about the Indians plight:\n\nWhole families … were imprisoned-fathers, mothers, and children, and many cases were reported of parents dying thus, either from starvation or from wounds caused by flogging, while their offspring were attached alongside of them to watch in misery themselves the dying agonies of their parents.\n\nJack was not the only Gubbins to turn up in Ireland either, his brother Reginald (or Reynaldo) also arrived in Dublin, announcing himself as a candidate in Peru’s upcoming Presidential elections. Reginald was a close ally of Augusto Leguia, the recently deposed President. Leguia, (who had once appeared on the cover of Time magazine) was a businessman with experience in the Insurance industry, he had sought to revolutionise Peru’s outdated industrial sector, and set about ambitious infrastructural plans for drainage and health care.\n\nHis second term as President came though a Coup d’état and this term would take on a far more dictatorial style, with Leguia oppressing dissenting voices within the political opposition. With the onset of the Great depression and falling demands for Peruvian goods and raw materials his government was overthrown. Leguia’s eventual successor, Luis Sanchez Cerro had been assassinated only months before the Combinado’s departure for Dublin and Reginald Gubbins saw himself as the man to lead the country back to prosperity. He was not to be successful in his campaign however, and Óscar Benavides would become Peruvian president. Sometime later Gubbins’ company would be blacklisted for selling cotton to Nazi Germany in contravention of orders to refrain from trade with Axis powers during the Second World War, a blacklist from which the U.S. House of Representatives would later absolve the company. Such were the colourful Hiberno-Peruvian Gubbins family who surrounded the Combinado tour.\n\nIreland at the time was not without its own political worries and was wound up with its own paranoia about possible coups. There had been genuine, though unfounded fears earlier in the year that the Cumann na nGaedheal political party would refuse to relinquish power to the incumbent Fianna Fáil party of Éamon DeValera who had triumphed in the recent elections. While only a month before the Bohemian – Combinado game a planned march by the right-wing, quasi-fascist Blueshirts group, led by former Civil War General and Police Commissioner Eoin O’Duffy, had been banned over fears that any such march was intended to as a ploy to overthrow the government in a similar fashion to Mussolini’s infamous March on Rome.\n\nBy the end of 1933 the Blueshirts would be banned completely and by 1936 O’Duffy would be leading 700 members of an Irish Brigade to fight for Franco in the Spanish Civil War. It was against this backdrop of national tension and Europe’s gathering storm clouds that this game would take place. Yet despite the proximity of these events, the civil disturbances in Peru or Ireland seem to have had little effect on the sportsmen of the Bohemians or the Combinado. Bohemians would be champions that season and again in 1935-36 while developing numerous players for the National side. Peru would go to the Berlin Olympics and experience joy, sorrow and bitter regret before players like Valdivieso and Lolo Fernández would write their names in their nation’s football history as victors in the 1939 Copa America and enduring icons for their clubs.\n\nOriginal version published on the official Bohemian FC website in 2014.

Many supporters may imagine this to be some sort of pre-Hanot era version of a European trophy, to be classified with the likes of the Mitropa Cup or Latin Cup which existed before the emergence of the European Cup in the 1950s. Unlike those other competitions, however, there is precious little information immediately available about the Aciéries d’Angleur, so for the benefit of the Bohs faithful, I offer this short account.\n\nThe Aciéries d’Angleur was a trophy contested by teams in and around Liege and Brussels, the term ‘Aciéries d’Angleur’ referred to the steel mills (aciéries) of the Angleur region around Liege, an area that had become heavily industrialised from the early 19th century onwards. Bohemians were invited to participate as a guest team in a competition involving , Standard Liege and Royal Tilleur FC but also played matches against a Royal Flemish XI and Charleroi Sporting Club as part of a wider tour of Belgium.\n\nAt the time, the national team of the Irish Free State was in its nascent phase. There had been an acrimonious spilt from the Belfast-based Irish Football Association (IFA), and the Football Association of the Irish Free State (FAIFS) had sought recognition from FIFA in order to compete on the international stage.\n\nThey knew that this recognition was unlikely to come from the “Home Nation” associations of the UK, whose official line was to recognise the IFA as football’s governing body for the whole island. Though the FAIFS had split from the IFA in 1921 and had been recognised by FIFA in 1923, it would not be until 1924 that a team would take to the pitch under the Free State banner when they competed in that year’s Olympic Games. It would be a further two years before a full international match would take place, this time against Italy in Turin. The Italians would then send a strong side for a return fixture in Dublin, playing in Lansdowne Road in 1927.\n\nThe two fixtures against the Italians both ended in defeat – the next international games were against Belgium and were both somewhat more successful. The first game, in February 1928, took place in Liege, with the Free State XI gaining a win with a very credible 4-2 victory in a game that featured Bohs’ Jack McCarthy as captain, Jimmy White grabbing two goals, Jeremiah (Sam) Robinson on the wing and Harry Cannon in goal. The return fixture was held in Dalymount Park a year later with the Irish running out 4-0 winners, thanks in no small part to a hat-trick by John Joe Flood of Shamrock Rovers in a game that also featured Bohs winger Jimmy Bermingham on the right.\n\nSome IFA observers north of the border saw this Free State side as a rump team, playing these early fixtures against other “Catholic” nations and excluded from the Home Nations championship which they viewed, somewhat arrogantly, as the true competitive measure of an international side. However, returning to Bohs, with the Belgian national team having twice played against Ireland, once in Dalymount, it should not perhaps seem so strange that Bohemians – Irish champions in the 1927-28 season – should be invited to compete for the Aciéries d’Angleur trophy.\n\nThe tournament was held as a pre-season competition before the beginning of the 1929-30 season, a campaign that would see Bohs again crowned as league champions as they reclaimed their title from rivals Shelbourne. It was contested by teams from the region around Liege and often featured a foreign invitee, the famous amateur English club Dulwich Hamlet had previously taken part, as had PSV Eindhoven.\n\nThe fixtures took place in August 1929, with the first match being against Charleroi on August 15th. A crowd of 15,000 was estimated to have attended, with the Bohemians players given a “splendid reception” on what was described as a day “too warm indeed, for football”. Although it was noted by Irish diplomat PJ O’Byrne (a Papal Count from his time as Irish Envoy to Rome) that the Bohemian party were warmly welcomed by the British Consul in Charleroi, there was an incident which caused a bit of a stir.\n\nAs Count O’Byrne noted:\n\n“Proceedings were marred somewhat – from our point of view – by the heralding of the Bohemian team on the field under the colours of the Union Jack, which, apparently, was the cause of some manifestation by a section of the crowd, probably British ex-Service Men.”\n\nIf the Union Flag incident affected the Bohs players, it didn’t show in their performance, as they ran out 2-1 winners, with goals from a pair of Bills – Bill Cleary and the English-born Bill Dennis. The matches came thick and fast, with another game the following day (Friday 16th) against Royal Flemish select in Brussels with Bohemians winning 1-0 according to a report in the Irish Times.\n\nThere is very little information about this game or about who made up the Royal Flemish side but later that same day the Bohemian Football Club party met with Count O’Byrne and arranged to lay a wreath at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier to honour the Irish dead of the First World War. The Free State international side had performed this same ritual the year before with some diplomatic assistance from the impressively named Count Gerald Edward O’Kelly de Gallagh et Tycooly, who had since relocated to Paris.\n\nThis simple ceremony, the laying of a wreath, which was a large floral harp in the Saorstát colours, was preceded by a short speech from Joe Wickham, secretary of Bohemians (and later to be General Secretary of the FAI). The diplomatic Free State flag was given to the team for the rest of the tour, so that it could be displayed in the stadium on match days and avoid any further incidents like the one in Charleroi. The wreath-laying ceremony had added significance for Bohemians, as the club had, according to one source, lost up to 40 playing members to the military during the Great War. One such Bohemian who would not return was the club’s early star forward Harold Sloan, who was killed in action on the Western Front in 1917.\n\nOn Saturday 17th the third game of the tour took place against Royal Tilleur FC. Royal Tilleur were a moderate side from Liege who had been relegated from the Belgian top flight the previous season. The club went through several mergers, and now exists as part of RFC de Liege, a club most famous for its refusal to release Jean Marc Bosman once his contract had expired and allow him to join French team Dunkerque. Again Bohemians ran out 1-0 winners, and once again Cleary was on the scoresheet.\n\nThe final game of the competition was against Standard Liege, to win what the Irish Independent referred to as the Royal Angleur Cup. The match was hard-fought, with the sides level at half-time at one apiece, Bermingham getting the first strike for Bohs. The Gypsies got on top in the second half, finishing as 3-2 winners, with Bill Dennis and Johnny McMahon getting the crucial goals. From there it was swiftly off to Ostend to catch the boat to London, and then back to Dublin to finish preparations for the new season.\n\nJust over two weeks after the return of the triumphant Bohemian side, there was a meeting of the FAIFS Council. At this meeting, PJ Casey of Dundalk FC paid tribute to Bohs on account of their successes in Belgium. The Association agreed to officially record these achievements, and this motion was supported by “various members” of the Council. It was further agreed at this meeting that the Association should endeavour to arrange another match against Belgium (and others against Holland, Germany, Sweden, Italy and Spain).\n\nThe game with Belgium was duly arranged for May 1930, and heralded another victory for the Irish, this time a 3-1 win in a game that featured the final international appearance of Bohemians defender Jack McCarthy (then 32), and the debut of 20-year-old forward Fred Horlacher, who was beginning his journey to becoming a club legend.\n\nWe often think of European club football as being insular in the years before the European Cup, especially in Ireland of the 1920s and 30s, where the association game was restricted to the hotbeds of Dublin and Cork, separated from the major clubs in the Belfast area, and effectively ostracised by the “Home Nations”.\n\nThe Aciéries d’Angleur however, showed that a team like Bohemians, true to their name, were more connected to mainland Europe than one might expect. The journey to Belgium was in its own small way an important step to identify the Free State, its Football Association, and clubs as separate and distinct entities, capable of competing in the international arena.\n\nThe issues around the Free State flag and the visit to the grave of the Unknown Soldier show that Bohemian Football Club, in a minor way, did its part to acknowledge the past (such as the contribution of Irish soldiers during the Great War) and herald the future of a small nation in flying the flag of the Free State. It is not far-fetched to assume that many of those attending the matches in Belgium would never have seen the Irish tricolour flown before, or perhaps even been aware of the emergence of this new state.\n\nThis was not to be the last engagement between Bohemians and teams from other nations. It is noteworthy that throughout the 1920s and 30s, long before official UEFA club competitions, Bohemians were competing against sides from all over the world. Although the Free State national teams’ victories over Belgium show that Belgian sides were perhaps not world beaters, it is worth remembering that they had been Olympic Champions on home soil in 1920, and players from that victorious side were still featuring against the Irish in 1928.\n\nBohemians, as a completely amateur side, also had to undertake a boat journey to Belgium via Britain, and play games on consecutive dates in blistering August weather against the local sides and in front of partisan crowds. Their victory is still worthy of respect from the Bohemian faithful to this day, even if the tournament may seem obscure and archaic to modern fans.\n\nMany will already know about Bohs’ historical victories in Europe against Rangers, Aberdeen, Kaiserslautern or BATE Borisov, though some may not be familiar with these earlier games in Belgium or indeed against sides from as far afield as South America, but then that’s a story for another day.\n\nOriginally posted on the official Bohemian FC website in 2014 and with special thanks to Simon Alcock for the imagery.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nJimmy Dunne stood on the pitch at the Weser Stadium, Bremen, May 1939, as the German anthem, complete with Deutschland über alles verses, echoed around the arena. The Swastika fluttered next to the Irish tricolour. Dunne was captaining Ireland that day and as a committed socialist, as a Republican who had been interned as a teenager, the fact that he has been told by his Association to give the Nazi salute grated deeply.\n\nHis teammate Joe O’Reilly recalled Dunne shouting to the rest of the side “Remember Aughrim, Remember 1916!” as they raised their arm. The packed stadium had heard a full two hour programme of stirring music and political speeches and were whipped into the appropriate delirious ferment. Further along the Irish team line, giving an awkward salute stood 20-year-old Dubliner, Johnny Carey of Manchester United.\n\nWithin months Carey had joined the British army and would be at combat against the Axis powers. As part of the Queen’s Royal Hussars he would see active duty in the Middle East and Italy. On his decision to enlist he stated that “a country that gives me my living is worth fighting for”. The match against Ireland was to be the last match that Germany would play before the outbreak of World War II less than four months later.\n\nSo as Ireland prepare for their daunting challenge against the reigning World Champions in Gelsenkirchen let us remember this game that brought Ireland both praise and shame.\n\nFirst it is important to note that the side that took on Ireland was not just a German team in the modern sense, as since the Anschluss of Austria the previous year that nations’ players were also called on to represent Germany. Among those in the German side that day was Wilhelm Hahnemann, born in Vienna he represented SK Admira a popular club in that city.\n\nThe FAI at the time were still in dispute with the IFA over the selection of players with both Associations selecting players from the whole island which in this case included Northerners like Sheffield Wednesday’s Willie Fallon born in Larne and Dundalk’s Mick Hoy from Tandragee lining out for the Free State.\n\nThe match in Bremen was to be the third that Ireland would play against German opposition in just four years. The Free State Association, still effectively ostracised by the Football Associations of the United Kingdom had to look to further shores in search of quality opposition, and this was regularly provided by the Germans.\n\nIn fact, given the massive political upheaval that took place throughout Europe during the 20s and 30s, it was not surprising that Ireland would find themselves competing against nations with far right and fascist governments. The Free State’s earliest games took place against Italy when they were under the rule of Mussolini, while the two games that preceded the game in Bremen were home and away fixtures against a talented Hungarian side; Hungary at the time was ruled by Miklós Horthy and his right-wing parliament which increasingly featured prominent anti-Semites.\n\nWhen the Germans had last played against Ireland, in 1936 in Dalymount Park they had been well beaten. The Free State select running out comfortable 5-2 winners, with Oldham’s Tom Davis scoring a brace on his debut. On that occasion the Germany side had made the fascist salute and were joined by what can best be described as misguided members of the Irish sporting public (or perhaps some ex-pat Germans?) who appear to have made the same gesture as a confused mark of respect to the visiting side.\n\nBy that stage there were already reports of the persecution taking place in Hitler’s regime but many felt that such reports were of dubious origin. Many Irish people remembered the fictional atrocities hyped by the British press that were attributed to German soldiers during the First World War and used as a recruiting tool in Ireland to get men to enlist. This was also the year of that grand Nazi propaganda exercise the Berlin Olympic Games; the view of the majority of the world seemed to be that sport should be wholly separate from politics. All the while Hitler wielded the global profile of the Games as a colossal example of Nazi soft power.\n\nTheodor Lewald, a German protestant but one with well-known Jewish ancestry had been a key man in preparing Berlin for the Olympic Games. He had been head of the organising committee well before the Nazis cottoned on to the idea that the Games could be a great propaganda coup. When they decided to support the games with massive financial backing, Lewald’s Jewish ancestry became a useful defence to calls for boycotts of the games on the grounds of Germany’s discriminatory practices, even so he was eventually forced to step down from his role.\n\nAvery Brundage, the head of the American delegation and later President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), had strongly objected to any boycott stating that he had been “given positive assurance in writing … that there will be no discrimination against Jews. You can’t ask more than that and I think the guarantee will be fulfilled”.\n\nOnly Spain (then on the brink of Civil War) and the Soviet Union (who had never participated up to that point anyway) would boycott the Games. Ireland, due to complex wrangling over the border issue could not field a team at the 1936 games. In this context it is perhaps somewhat understandable that Ireland would be so happy to play Germany in 1936.\n\nHowever, by 1939, with Europe on the brink of war, and Germany being slowly ostracised after its 1938 conquest of Austria and the Sudetenland it is more difficult to ignore the political dimensions of the decision to play Germany and offer the Nazi salute.\n\nIn his official report to the FAI Council the General Secretary Joe Wickham noted:\n\nIn Bremen our flags were flown though, of course, well outnumbered by the Swastika. We also, as a compliment, gave the German salute to their Anthem, standing to attention for our own. We were informed this would be much appreciated by their public which it undoubtedly was.\n\nThe German Sports Minister [Reichssportführer Hans von Tschammer und Osten] at the Banquet paid special tribute to our playing the match as arranged despite what he described as untrue press reports regarding the position in Germany and their intentions.\n\nThe Football Association were not the only ones to view the stories of German abuses with a certain measure of scepticism. The Irish Government held certain doubts as well, inherently distrustful as they were of British media reports, they were also being fed misinformation and racially motivated lies by their man in Germany, Charles Bewley.\n\nBorn into the famous Bewley coffee family whose iconic Grafton Street café still trades today, Charles was raised as a Quaker. However as a young man he went against his illustrious family and converted to Catholicism and became involved in politics, standing unsuccessfully for Sinn Féin in 1918.\n\nBy 1933 he had been appointed as Irish envoy to Berlin where he became an outspoken admirer of National Socialism and Adolf Hitler. He regularly reported back to Taoiseach Éamon de Valera that Jews in Berlin were not under threat but instead libelled the Berlin Jewish community, accusing them of all manner of vices.\n\nBewley’s actions also meant that those German Jews seeking a visa to come to the Irish Free State in order to escape the Nazi regime were generally refused, with fewer than one hundred Jews being granted visas during his time in Germany. De Valera finally dismissed Bewley in August 1939 but by then it was too late for many to escape.\n\nThe actions of men like Bewley can go some way to explain the certain level of scepticism which some in Ireland viewed reports of Nazi outrages. Joe Wickham as noted above seemed more concerned with showing due courtesy to their German hosts and was happy to repeat the line about the “untrue press reports” at the following Council meeting.\n\nThere is perhaps a certain obsequies Irishness evident here. With few international games available for the Free State association, matches against a significant team like German were important for the Irish side and also for the association’s finances. A small, still fledgling association like Wickham’s was too beholden to the German.\n\nIt is also worth remembering that England playing in Berlin only a year earlier had given a Nazi salute before the game, although this was done under protest from the players, especially from Eddie Hapgood of Arsenal who was England captain at the time. The English players only agreed when the British Ambassador to Germany Sir Neville Henderson informed them that a refusal to perform the salute could be the “spark to set Europe alight”. Interestingly Aston Villa, touring in Germany at the same time, refused to give the salute prior to their game against a German XI.\n\nWhile England would go on to win their game 6-3 the game against Ireland would end as a one all draw. The Irish lined out with Southend’s George McKenzie in goal and a standard WM formation with a back line featuring William O’Neill, Mick Hoy (both Dundalk), Joe O’Reilly (St. James’s Gate), Matt O’Mahoney (Bristol Rovers), Ned Weir (Clyde) and a front five of Kevin O’Flanagan (Bohemians), Willie Fallon (Sheffield Wednesday), Jimmy Dunne (Shamrock Rovers), Johnny Carey (Manchester United) and Paddy Bradshaw of St. James’s Gate at centre forward.\n\nThe Germans apart from having the Austrian, Hahnemann in their ranks also featured world class players like their captain Paul Janes, rated as one of the world’s finest defenders, prolific goal-scorer Ernst Lehner was part of the forward line along with the man who would coach Germany to the 1974 World Cup, Helmut Schön. Organising things from the touchline was that legendary manager and creator of bon mots Sepp Herberger, who would eventually lead Germany to World Cup victory in 1954.\n\nAs described above over 35,000 people had crammed into the Weser Stadium from early on for the pre-match “entertainment” and had been suitably roused for the forthcoming match. While the German anthem and various martial airs had been blared out, the band present on the day had no sheet music for the Irish Anthem, according to journalist Peter Byrne, it was Joe O’Reilly who had once been a member of the Irish Army Band who stepped into the breach and sketched down the music for Amhrán na bhFiann from memory. The crowd was a then record attendance for the stadium and their enthusiasm seemed to have had the desired impact with Germany hitting the post through Hahnemann early on.\n\nIreland responded with some good play of their own as their “accurate passes and their head-work aroused the admiration of the crowd”, Dunne and Bradshaw were combining well and both forced good saves from keeper Hans Jakob. Disaster would strike though in the 34th minute, Jimmy Dunne, Irish captain and record goalscorer, was injured in a collision with defender Hans Rohde and had to be carried from the pitch. This misfortune was compounded only four minutes later when Helmut Schön scored the opening goal.\n\nIreland trailed one nil at the break and were forced to begin the second half with only ten men (still no substitutes in those days) and the Germans nearly grabbed a second goal through TuS Neuendorf forward Gauchel. On the 55th minute Jimmy Dunne returned to the fray, going in at outside right meaning a move to centre forward for Kevin O’Flanagan, the 19-year-old was studying medicine in UCD and playing as an amateur for Bohemians, and was remembered as possessing one of the hardest shots in football , this move also allowed Paddy Bradshaw to withdraw to inside right.\n\nThe return of Dunne and the reshuffle in the forward line seemed to throw the Germans and the Irish improved in the volume and quality of their attacks, Carey came close to scoring before Bradshaw restored parity in the 60th minute with a powerful header from a Fallon cross. For the remaining half hour it was Jakob in the German goal who was the busier of the two keepers as the Irish pressed for the winner. The influential Kicker magazine stated “from a competitive point of view, there was no weak point in the Irish team, their only deficiency being a lack of precision in passing”.\n\nA more than credible draw for the Irish in ominous circumstances, they were feted after their game by the German public, obviously impressed by the Irish play, and they were received by Nazi top brass at a banquet that night. The result would mark the best ever season of results in the short history of the Free State side and strange as it may seem they would probably have been looking forward to the following year’s fixtures.\n\nJoe Wickham, flushed with the success of the Irish tour to Hungary and Germany was keen to organise fixtures for the coming seasons including matches against Spain, Italy and Romania. Of course war was to intervene and while the League of Ireland would continue the Free State would not play another international for seven years.\n\nYoung men like Carey and O’Flanagan would return for Ireland in the 1940s but the other nine men who took the field would never wear the green again. The greatest of these was Dunne, captain on the day and he had defied injury to finish the German game, his goalscoring record of 13 would stand for nearly 30 years. On the return journey to Ireland he was greeted in the port of Southampton and given a rousing salute from that city’s dockworkers, Dunne had played for Southampton for a year and his goals had saved them from relegation. Not something quickly forgotten by the working men of that town.\n\nBecause of those careers cut short, the ignominy of being required to make the salute, Johnny Carey’s desire to fight and the intermittently dangerous power of sport as propaganda do spare a thought for those men in Bremen when Martin O’Neill’s side line out in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nOriginally posted on backpagefootball.com in 2014\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt was on a still, sunny November afternoon last year on the approach to the Aviva Stadium (Lansdowne Road as was) that I spotted Paul McGrath. Paul was, like the rest of the crowd, on his way to the FAI Cup final between Derry City and his former club, St. Patrick’s Athletic. He is of course no stranger to the old ground; he strode its turf with gazelle-like grace over the course of his 12 year international career, and it was his performances in a green shirt that have ensured his status as a sporting legend in Ireland. Despite his much publicised personal problems, or perhaps because of them, Paul is not only respected by the Irish public, but genuinely loved. It is that hint of vulnerability that was so at odds with his commanding, assured performances, that has struck such a chord with football fans.\n\nHe was my footballing hero growing up, my early childhood helpfully coinciding with an unprecedented level of success for the Irish national team. Paul was of course a key part of that success, a national talisman, and a rock during the nations’ first tournament involvement; Euro 88, Italia 90, where the team reached the quarter-finals, and USA 94. For many, the opening game in World Cup 94 was Paul’s defining moment in a green shirt, when an ageing McGrath, dodgy knees, painkilling injection in his shoulder, dominated an Italian attack featuring Giuseppe Signori and Roberto Baggio. If the World Cups were the peak of his career, then his presence at Lansdowne Road last November was a reminder of his more humble beginnings as a professional footballer.\n\nDespite playing only a single season for St. Pat’s (1981-82), Paul remains a legend at the club based in the South Dublin suburb of Inchicore. It was pleasing to see by his attendance at the final that Paul hadn’t forgotten his roots. Such was his popularity with the Pat’s faithful that Paul became known as “The Black Pearl of Inchicore”, a reference to Benfica legend Eusebio. Paul was the first player to be given that moniker by the Pat’s fans, but not the last, as both Curtis Fleming (later of Middlesboro and Crystal Palace) and Paul Osam were sometimes given the “Black Pearl” sobriquet.\n\nThough perhaps the most prominent person of colour to play for the national team, Paul was not the first. The first mixed race player to don the green jersey in a senior international was Spurs’ Chris Hughton back in 1979, six years before Paul’s debut. Like Paul he would also feature in Euro 88 and World Cup 90. As for the first player of colour in the League of Ireland? Well we have to go back a little further…\n\nIn fact we’ll have to go back to May 1961, back to the FAI Cup final, this time held in Dalymount Park, and as in 2014 St. Patrick’s Athletic are one of the teams in action. Pat’s would win the final in 2014, as they would also triumph in 1961 though in the intervening 53 years, the Saints would contest seven cup finals and lose them all. One other thing that the finals of 2014 and 1961 had in common was that my father was in attendance at both. We sat together in the south stand in 2014, but back in 1961 he was in Dalymount Park as a member of Drumcondra F.C.’s under-18 team watching their senior counterparts lose 2-1 to St. Pats. As an outside-right he would have been paying special attention to the senior player in his position, a 21 year old full of skill and trickery named Ray Keogh.\n\nRay, as far as any League of Ireland historian or statistician can confirm was the first black player in the League of Ireland. British football has, in recent years started to pay attention to the contribution made by players of colour in the early years of football’s development. Men like Andrew Watson, Walter Tull and Arthur Wharton have begun to have their input to the game recognised, and there is a growing understanding that the early decades of British football were not as white and homogenous as once portrayed. However in Ireland there has been little discussion on similar subjects. In the absence of any earlier players being mentioned I’d like to talk a little about Ray’s career in the League of Ireland.\n\nRay was raised in a white family in the Dublin suburb of Milltown in the 1940s. The area was in close proximity to Glenmalure Park, the then home of Shamrock Rovers, one of the country’s biggest clubs. Ray joined them as a teenager after playing schoolboy football with Castleville and the famous Home Farm club, and made appearances for the Rovers’ reserve side in 1958 before making his first team debut a year later. Some reports incorrectly stated that Ray was part of the Rovers team in 1957 that took on Busby Babes era Manchester United early in their tragic European Cup campaign, mistaking a 17 year old Ray for the similarly named Shay Keogh. Despite his talent and versatility, primarily as an outside right (though he played in a variety of positions), first team opportunities at Rovers were limited for Ray. They had been League Champions in the 56-57 and 58-59 seasons, and their forward line was full of Irish internationals such as Paddy Ambrose, Liam Tuohy, Tommy Hamilton, “Maxie” McCann and experienced player-manager Paddy Coad.\n\nA move was needed and initially it was a trip north-west to Longford Town in the 59-60 season. Longford were a “B” division side at the time playing against reserve sides of the likes of Shamrock Rovers and other smaller and regional sides. His stay with Longford was brief, however, as he moved back to the top-flight of Irish football and to Drumcondra F.C. Based in the north Dublin suburb of the same name, “Drums” had been Shamrock Rovers’ great rivals throughout the 50’s. The club had been home to players of the highest quality such as Alan Kelly Sr. (a Preston North End legend with a stand named after him at Deepdale) as well as League of Ireland stars like Jimmy Morrissey and Christy “Bunny” Fullam.\n\nDrumcondra FC before the 1961 FAI Cup final. Ray Keogh is bottom left. (source http://drumcondrafc.com/)\n\nWhile Drums lost out in that 1961 final, they qualified for the European Cup as League Champions for 1960-61, which was Ray’s first full season with the side. Ray would feature in the European Cup defeat at the hands of German champions FC Nurnberg in the first round, but would fare better the following year in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, when Drumcondra made football history by becoming the first Irish side to win a European game on aggregate, defeating Danish side Odense 6-5 over two legs, with Ray playing both games. They were drawn against Bayern Munich in the following round. Ray didn’t feature in the heavy 6-0 defeat in Munich, however he did return to the starting line-up for the home leg and helped restore some pride as Drums beat Bayern 1-0.\n\nHe would also win representative honours representing the League of Ireland selection on a number of occasions. Inter-league games were usually against British and occasionally mainland European league sides, and were considered to be highly prestigious at the time. The fact that Ray, on several occasions, was judged to be among the best players in the league and worthy of selection is testament to his ability. He made his debut in 1961 against a Scottish XI in a 1-1 draw and would make several appearances for the league before a move to his next club, Ards based in the County Down town of Newtownards in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Northern Irish league was traditionally dominated by the bigger Belfast sides like Linfield and Glentoran, though Ards had enjoyed a league title success in the 1957-58 season. Though signed by Johnny Neilson the manager for the majority of Ray’s stay north of the border was George Eastham Sr., a former Bolton Wanderers player and father to Arsenal and Newcastle star George Eastham Jr. The town of Newtownards was overwhelmingly Protestant and it must have been somewhat daunting for a black, Catholic Dubliner venturing over the border in 1964. Although the horrific violence of “the Troubles” was still a few years off it was still a time of tension in Northern Ireland. The IRA’s ill-fated border campaign, which led to the use of internment on both sides of the border had only ended two years previously, while the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement would soon be heard in the city of Derry. Ray would spend two seasons with Ards with the team itself struggling at the lower end of the Irish League table as well as brief unhappy spell with Portadown.\n\nHis next move would take him to the other end of the island, moving almost 700km south to Cork, where he would spend a season lining out for Cork Hibernians before moving again after the arrival of former Irish international Amby Fogarty as player-manager. This move was to Drogheda F.C. During his time with Drogheda, Ray worked with some notable managers, first former Middlesboro player Arthur Fitzsimons who had previously coached the Libyan national team, and later, player-manager Mick Meagan; the tireless former Everton defender who combined these roles with his position as manager of Republic of Ireland national team. Meagan would bring in other experienced players such as Ronnie Whelan Sr. to add to the emerging young stars at the club such as Mick Fairclough. Despite the talent at the Lourdes Stadium, the best that Drogheda would achieve during Ray’s stay would be a 5th place league finish in 1967-68. They would make it to the Cup final of 1970-71, but by that stage Ray had moved on to pastures new.\n\nBy then on the wrong side of 30, Ray would drop out of senior football and move into coaching, first with Tullamore Town where as player-manager he would win the Intermediate Cup and the League of Ireland “B” division, and then on to Parkvilla F.C. based in Navan. Despite the drop down from senior football ranks, Ray, as both player and manager would still encounter players of real quality. In the FAI Cup they would come close to a giant-killing, forcing a replay against Shamrock Rovers. While Parkvilla’s title rivals Pegasus featured a young defender, one Kevin Moran, who would go on to make his name at Manchester United. Another rival side were Dalkey United who featured a young full back by the name of Paul McGrath. Dalkey is a well-healed south-Dublin coastal town that also happened to be home to one of the orphanages where Paul grew up. It is tempting to see Parkvilla versus Dalkey United, an unglamorous amateur tie probably watched by a couple of dozen spectators, as somehow significant: Ray, a trailblazer in his own way but now in his late 30s, encountering an 18 year Paul McGrath at a point before his career took off. Two black Dubliners who would help to change the perception of what the traditional, homogenous view of what it means to be Irish at a time when to be Irish seemed to be synonymous with words like white and Catholic, denying the pluralism (albeit stifled and hidden) that has always existed in Irish society.\n\nSo what sort of player was Ray and how was he treated by spectators of the day? From talking to those who watched him and who played alongside him, his main attributes were his passing ability and dribbling, fast without being lightning quick he was also excellent on set-pieces. Newspaper reports are full of descriptions of him humiliating fullbacks, constantly beating his man and delivering excellent crosses. While usually employed as an old-fashioned, chalk-on-your-boots right winger, Ray was versatile playing across all of the old front five positions, his awareness and passing ability assisting his role as an inside forward, reports referring to him as a “delightful ball player”. He also played centre forward with some success, no small feat for a man described as “diminutive” even by the standards of the day and he also played as a sweeper during his later years as a player-manager. The fact that he was black didn’t seem to cause much comment either, a few early reports noted the talents of the young “coloured” player and while at Longford he was referred to as “Nigerian forward Ray Keogh”. He did attract some bizarre and offensive nicknames such as “Darky” Keogh and the more esoteric “Blessed Martin” after Saint Martin de Porres, the 16th Century Peruvian monk who was the mixed-race son of a Spanish nobleman and a freed Panamanian slave.\n\nRay’s senior playing career coincided with the golden age of the League of Ireland, the 50’s and 60’s were an era of big crowds, bigger clubs often having gates of over 20,000 while cup finals could see over 40,000 in attendance. The League was also able to keep more of the better quality Irish players in the country. The maximum wage remained in place in England until 1961, and even after the limit was lifted it was still often more financially beneficial for a player to stay in Ireland than to go to England. Domestic players were truly local heroes, especially at clubs like Shamrock Rovers and Drumcondra, who enjoyed a great popular sporting rivalry through the 50s and 60s. Ray got to play in front of big crowds, win league titles, compete in cup finals, play in Europe against the likes of Bayern Munich, and represent his league in prestigious games. He was a local icon but because of the era he played in, the strange role that domestic football played in Irish society at the time, and the lack of surviving TV footage, Ray is mainly remembered these days by groups of ageing Drumcondra fans who hold on to memories of a club that disappeared from senior league football back in 1972.\n\nWhen the Irish national team enjoyed its own golden age, reaching its peak at Italia 90, players like Chris Hughton and Paul McGrath were household names. The constant replaying of the penalty shoot-out against Romania, Kevin Sheedy’s equaliser against England and the pain of Bonner’s parry and Schillaci’s finish means that the players of that era are never likely to be forgotten. Nor will the way that Jack Charlton’s side helped that process of redefining Irishness. That men from Dublin, Cork and Donegal could line up alongside men from Glasgow, London and Manchester, be they black or white, Catholic or Protestant and still represent Ireland and the green jersey with pride had a profound effect on how we viewed our nation and diaspora. And in a small way we should remember the contribution of a man named Ray Keogh to that process.\n\nThis article was first published in edition 8 of The Football Pink magazine.
