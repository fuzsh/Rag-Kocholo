        "text": "A rising of Ladies Football, among the Farney Hills\n\nA statistical account for the development and successes of An Cumann Peil Gael Na mBan in Co Monaghan\n\n1991 – 2004\n\nFootball arrived to County Monaghan, when on the 13th January 1991 Magheracloone affiliated to Cumann Peile Gael na mBan. By then on the 12 – 3 – 91 with plenty of enthusiasm and expertise from Pat Quill, Peter Rice, Helen O’Rourke and Christy Byrne from Central Council the first Ladies County Board was formed with representatives from two clubs; namely Magheracloone, and Monaghan Harps. Elected on that night in the Riverdale Hotel, Ballybay were Chairman Philip Kelly Magheracloone. The meeting elected Secretary Eileen McElvaney Monaghan Harps, Treasurer Elizabeth Martin Magheracloone. At a subsequent meeting on the 26 – 3 – 91 to the above list were added Vice-Chair Oliver Gavan Aghabog, Youth Officer Paddy Flood Aghabog and P.R.O. Damien Morgan Monaghan Harps.\n\nThis meeting was to be the beginning of a phenomenal rise of Ladies football – not only in Monaghan but also in Ulster as in 1992 counties Armagh, Tyrone and Donegal followed Monaghan’s lead. In 1993 Fermanagh joined the ranks and by the Spring of 1994 seven third level colleges/universities were active in competitions.\n\nThe ladies from Monaghan were so enthusiastic about this new found sport, that in 1992 – at only their second attempt they were to become All-Ireland Junior Champions capturing the John Timmins Cup at Croke Park on the 3 – 10 – 1992 defeating London by two points.\n\nEarly Days\n\nIn 1975 pictures and reports in the “Northern Standard” give accounts of Monaghan Ladies Competing against St. Brigid’s Ardee in the Psychiatric hospitals competitions. The report reads –\n\nLadies match:\n\nThe curtain raiser on the football programme was a ladies match between St Davnet’s nurses and St Brigid’s Louth St Davnet’s Monaghan – were victors by 2 – 2 to 1 – 0. After falling behind through conceding an early goal, the St Davnet’s girls were rampant in the second half. Scorers for St Davnet’s were R. Connolly 1- 1, E. Treanor 0 – 1, J. Murray 1- 0, St. Brigid’s scorer was M. Martin 1- 0.\n\nAnother photograph taken in 1979 protrays a South Monaghan team from Magheracloone, known as the “Red Devils” after competing at sports against a team from Fyans town county Meath.\n\nAnother very important match for ladies football in Ulster could have been the meeting of Aghabog and Magheracloone on the 14th October 1990 when Aghabog scored 4 – 8 to Magheracloone’s 2 – 6.\n\n1991 – on\n\nAfter the inaugural setting up of Monaghan’s first County Board on the 12 – 3 – 91 and the further meeting on the 26 – 3 – 91 Pat Quill again returned to the Riverdale Hotel, Ballybay on the 31 – 3 – 91 where four clubs had approximately 50 people present namely Magheracloone 19, Aghabog 16, Monaghan Harps 8, Corduff 7 and Brenda Macklin from Ballybay.\n\nLadies football in Monaghan was up an running, to such an extent that at Donaghmoyne on 14 – 4 – 91 the first ever Monaghan Ladies county team took to the field with Longford as their opposition and lining out for Monaghan were: Blathnaid Carolan Aghabog, Jennifer Treanor Mon Harps, Mairead Kelly Aghabog, Celia Marron Magheracloone, Aoife Murphy Mon Harps, Brenda Macklin Mon Harps, Aisling Smith Aghabog, Linda Farrelly Magheracloone, Susan Maxwell Magheracloone, Rosemary McCabe M’cloone, Jennifer Greenan Aghabog, Eileen McElvaney Mon Harps, Anne Gavan Aghabog, Margaret Kierans Aghabog, Cora Jones Magheracloone, Subs used Catherine Finnegan, Marie Gargan and Karen Kelly all Magheracloone also Seanine McConnell Mon Harps, Patricia Goodman, Elizabeth Martin Magheracloone, Eilish Ní Mhurchũ & Michelle McKenna Mon Harps, Amanda Moloney Aghabog.\n\nManager: Paddy Flood Aghabog, Selectors: Philip Kelly & Maurice Kindlow Magheracloone, Oliver Gavan Aghabog. The final score of the above historic encounter was Monaghan 1 – 4 Longford 3 – 5. Monaghan scorers were Jennifer Greenan 0 – 2, Margaret Kierans 0 – 1, Ann Gavan\n\n0 – 1, and Marie Gargan 1- 0.\n\nBy the end of their league campaign Monaghan were in possession of ten points from a possible twelve, some however were awarded by default, for various reasons and important subsequent results for 1991 were as follows:\n\nU16 All-Ireland Semi final: Roscommon 3 – 5, Monaghan 0 – 4.\n\nU18 All-Ireland Semi final: Roscommon 0 – 8 Monaghan 2 – 2.\n\nReplay: Monaghan 2 – 5, Roscommon 2 – 6.\n\nNational Junior Championship Quarter Final: Monaghan 0 – 5, Clare 5-18.\n\nAll-Ireland 7 – A – Side Shield Final Monaghan Harps 2 – 3, St Fintan’s Wexford 6 – 6.\n\nClub Competitions in Monaghan in 1991.\n\nClubs participating:\n\nDonaghmoyne, Carrickmacross, Magheracloone, Inniskeen, Corduff, Aghabog, Monaghan Harps, Doohamlet, Aughnamullen and Tyholland.\n\nU14 Community Games Final: Kilmore Drumsnatt 5 – 5, Clontibret 1- 0.\n\nU14 County League Final: Aghabog 3 – 4, Kilmore Drumsnatt 3 – 3, played at Aughnamullen on the 11 – 7 – 91 with Aghabog captained by Jennifer Greenan.\n\nU16 final: Aghabog 3 – 2, Donaghmoyne 0 – 7.\n\nMinor final: Aghabog 4 – 4, Monaghan Harps 1- 4. 28/11/91\n\nAll County League Semi – finals\n\nMon Harps 4 – 7 Donaghmoyne 1 – 6 & Aghabog 2 – 10 Carrickmacross\n\n2 – 2.\n\nCounty final: 26 – 9 – 91 Aghabog 4 – 6 Monaghan Harps 1- 4.\n\nAll Ireland Club Championship Quarter final\n\nAghabog 1-1 Rochfortbridge – Westmeath 3 – 8\n\nVocational Schools final\n\nInver College Carrickmacross 5 – 6 Castleblayney 0 – 0.\n\n1992\n\nThe final act of 1991 was the County Convention in the Riverdale Hotel, Ballybay and with Oliver Gavan as acting Chairman the following officers were elected to serve for what was to be an historic 1992 –\n\nChairman – Mr P.J. Finnegan Magheracloone,\n\nVice Chair – Mr Oliver Gavan Aghabog,\n\nSecretary – Mrs Anita Finnegan Aughnamullen,\n\nAss Sec – Ms Brenda Macklin Aughnamullen,\n\nTreasurer – Mrs Mary McCabe Kilmore/Drumswann,\n\nDevelopment Officer – Philip Kelly Magheracloone,\n\nYouth Officer – Mrs Suzanne Murphy Donaghmoyne,\n\nRegistrar – Paddy Clerkin Kilmore/Drumsnatt,\n\nPRO – Owen McNally\n\nCentral Council Delegates – Maurice Kindlon Magheracloone, and Mrs Anita Finnegan Aughnamullen.\n\nPath to All-Ireland title 1992\n\nMonaghan’s second year in Cumann Peile Gael na mBan saw Margaret Kierans collect the All-Ireland Junior Championship – John Timmins Cup – from President Mr Peter Rice from Wexford and lose the Junior league final in a replay to Cork.\n\nMonaghan’s Title Trail\n\nUlster Semi-Final: St. Enda’s Omagh: Monaghan 1 – 12, Tyrone 2 – 0.\n\nUlster Final: Castleblayney: Monaghan 3 – 13, Armagh 2 – 7.\n\nAll-Ireland Junior Semi-Final: Kiltormer: Galway 0 – 1, Monaghan\n\n2 – 7.\n\nAll-Ireland Junior Final: Croke Park: Monaghan 2 – 8, London 2 – 6.\n\nMONAGHAN’S FIRST TASTE OF\n\nALL-IRELAND SUCCESS 1992\n\nMonaghan Co Board had a rapid growth in clubs, and interest in ladies football. On the county football scene Monaghan played Longford in the league at Donaghmoyne giving the Leinster team a good run losing by 3-5 to 1-4 with late scores by the more experienced midlanders the difference at the finish of an historic occasion for the Farney girls.\n\nIn the junior All-Ireland championships, Monaghan entered as Ulster representatives but were heavenly defeated by Clare in the All-Ireland semi-final by 6-17 to 0 –5. The county also entered a team in the U-16 competition but were trounced by Roscommon by 2-5 to 0-4. However in the Minor Championship they played with a Roscommon team on the score Roscommon 0-8 Monaghan 2-2. Replay Ros 2-6 to Mon’s 2-5 at Rockcorry.\n\nIn the following year Monaghan were more battle hardened and experienced and with more preparation they embarked on the first Ulster championship with new affiliations Tyrone and Armagh and Donegal. Monaghan took on Armagh at Castleblayney and lifted the first official title winning by 3-13 to 2-7 in a closer final than the score line suggests. In the All-Ireland semi-final Monaghan made the long journey to Kiltormer in Galway to take on the home county in the All-Ireland semi-final winning by 2-7 to 0-1.\n\nLondon were their opponents in the final and the exiles were fast becoming bridesmaids having lost two previous finals, and were hot favourites to see Monaghan challenge, however the Farney ladies had other ideas and after a great final at Croke Park before a tremendous support from home Monaghan did the county proud and emulated their men who won the junior title in 1956 when they defeated London by 208 to 2-6. What an occasion for captain Margaret Kierans the President Peter Rice handed her the Timmins cup, amidst a sea of blue and white and delirious supporters.\n\nIn the league Monaghan had a tremendous run of victories with huge victories over Meath by 9-14 to 0-1, Leitrim by 2-13 to 1-2, Roscommon by 2-8 to 1-6 Tyrone by 7-16 to 0-2, Armagh 4-12 to 2-3, Offaly by 7-12 to 1-1. In the league semi-final Dublin gave Monaghan a great game with Monaghan winning by a brace of goals at Rockcorry by 2-16 to 4-4.\n\nIn the final at Portlaoise, Cork and Monaghan played a thrilling draw Monaghan scoring 2-10 to 3-7 and few miles nearer home for Monaghan at Mountmeelic Cork shattered Monaghan’s dream of a double winning by 1-7 to 0-8, in the replay with a lesson not to take titles for granted until the cup is on the mantelpiece.\n\nLadies Gaelic Football was developing fast in the county but the amazing strides forward made by this relatively new sporting activity, are unequalled in any other county in the country. In 1993, there were no less than one hundred club games played in the county, there were over eight hundred players registered last year. Phenomenal is about the only word that could describe such an amazing growth. Great credit is surely due to the organisers, and to what surely must be one of the most progressive County Boards in the entire county.\n\nAnd it all stemmed from a little school team up in Aghabog and a great enthusiast named Oliver Gavan from that club.\n\nDuring 1993 Monaghan competed in Senior, Minor, Under 16 and Under 14 levels in the Ulster 14 levels in the Ulster and All-Ireland series, and all four teams gave tremendously good accounts of themselves. The premier team was graded Senior because they won the All-Ireland Junior Championship in 1992 when they defeated London in Croke Park. They also moved up from Division 3 in 1992 to division 2 in 1993 where they ended up in second position. Taking the Championship first, however, they had a clear run through Ulster as the other four counties were in a different category, so they met Kerry in the All-Ireland Senior semi-final at Austin Stack Park in Tralee, but were well beaten. This was no disgrace, however, as Kerry had previously been dethroned the previous All-Ireland final. That puts Monaghan’s performance into perspective.\n\nIn the league, Monaghan’s opening game was against Dublin but defeat was their lot. Despite that reverse, they scored a marvellous win over Galway in the next game, which also marked the official opening of the new pitch at Tyholland. This was followed by another tremendous win over Clare and the Monaghan girls were really beginning to attract the notice of the media. In all, six games were played with Monaghan finishing in second place with nine points from the six games played. This put them into the semi-finals of the League in which they were pitted against Laois and what a marathon that turned out to be. The first game ended all square and the sides were still on level terms after extra time. The second game also ended all square and again it went to extra tine, but this time the Laois ladies eventually came out on top.\n\nThese Monaghan displays should also be put in proper perspective as Laois had reached the final of the All-Ireland Championship when they lost out to Kerry, but then they took the league title. In other words, their toughest opponents in the entire campaign was Monaghan.\n\nThis was a top class Monaghan team with Ann Gavan of Aghabog in goals, a girl who also won a place on the All-Stars selection. Mary B Hamill of Aughnamullen was a sound fullback, with Catherine Finnegan of Magheracloone in one corner and Monaghan Harps player Jennifer Treanor in the other.\n\nIn front of them were exceptional half-backs in Mairead Kelly of Aghabog, Seanine McConnell of Monaghan Harps and Aisling Swift of Aghabog, a trio that was seldom beaten. Midfield was staunchly held by Jennifer Greenan of Aghabog and Linda Farrelly of Carrickmacross, who captained the side and was also elected ‘Player of the Year’ for the previous year.\n\nIn attack, Monaghan had some really outstanding forwards with Brenda Macklin of Monaghan Harps, her club mate Eileen McElvaney, and Orla Gartlan from Carrickmacross forming the three quarters line.\n\nIn front of them were chief score-getters Voreen Quigley from Inniskeen, Angela Larkin from Corduff and Margaret Kierans from Aghabog. Always waiting on the bench and ready, if called upon, were Yvonne Quigley, Mary O’Callaghan and Pauline Woods (Inniskeen), Audrey O’Reilly (Monaghan Harps), Anita Finnegan and Mary Connolly (Aughnamullen), and Caroline Tierney and Lorraine Connolly (Kilmore/Drumsnatt).\n\nThe Co Board had the option of fielding a junior team also, but they wisely felt that this would be stretching their resources too much. At minor level (Under 18), the county selection also did us proud by defeating Tyrone in the Ulster semi-final. In the All-Ireland semi-final Monaghan lost to visiting Waterford at Rockcorry. Outstanding on the Minor squad were Ann Gavan in goals, Catherine Finnegan, Angela Larkin, Siobhan Smith, Teresa Geoghegan, Anita O’Reilly, Jennifer Greenan, Yvonne Quigley, Caroline Tierney and others, in one of the largest panels any Ulster county could possibly boast. Winning the Ulster Minor Championship at the first year of trying was a tremendous achievement.\n\nAt under 16 level Monaghan overcame Tyrone but then lost to Donegal in the Ulster Final, while at Under 14 level Monaghan also represented Ulster but lost to Kerry in the All-Ireland series. Despite defeat, this was great experience for these youngsters and these are the girls who will be carrying Monaghan hopes at adult level in the years ahead. They have come through a baptism of fire, but the experience gained by them should stand them in good stead in future competitions.\n\nOn the domestic scene, for the first time, there were two divisions splitting seniors and Juniors, with all seventeen teams taking part in a knockout county championship. Inniskeen and Monaghan Harps won their first respective ways to the county final and finished all square in their first meeting, but in the replay, Inniskeen came out on top. The Leagues also proved a huge success with Donaghmoyne, Monaghan Harps, Aghabog and Inniskeen reaching the semi-finals of Division One and Rockcorry, Kilmore/Drumsnatt, Corduff and Clones qualifying for the semi-final stages of Division Two. Because there were so many games these later stages were only reached at the end of the season.\n\nThe minor competition also had a successful run, with Donaghmoyne, Kilmore/Drumsnatt, Aughnamullen and Magheracloone reaching the semi-final knockout stages. At Under 16 there was also a very successful campaign with Donaghmoyne overcoming Kilmore/Drumsnatt in the first of the semi-finals and Magheracloone defeating Tyholland by 2-6 to 2-0 in the second semi. Its interesting to note the four teams that played in those two semi-finals will form the nucleus of next years county minor side:\n\nKilmore/Drumsnatt: Faye Murphy, Jacinta Keenan, Michelle Rattigan, Siobhan Sheridan, Emma Brady, Claire McCullagh, Concepta McCabe, Louise McMahon, Lorraine Connolly, Ann Marie McCaul, Olivia Connolly, Michelle McElvaney, Danielle Mallen, Aisling Larkin and Christina Reilly.\n\nDonaghmoyne: Carmel McEneaney, Cathy Hall, Lisa Finnegan, Zita McBride, Joanne Martin, A.

Board was the first County in Ulster since 1984 to take part in official competition at Club/County/and National levels and went on to become the most successful county in the providence.\n\nIn the first year of existence within the County we had 11 clubs taking part in official competitions for U/14, U/16, U/18 and senior teams. Also a County junior team winning 1 game/drew 1/and losing about 6 games in the first year. This proved to be a new beginning for Monaghan football that had been starved of success within the GAA code.\n\nFeile Gael Na mBan in Monaghan was soon to become widely known for their talents and exploits on the football field.\n\nThe first major success was in 1992 when they beat Armagh in the Ulster Junior Championship played in Castleblayney and went on to win the Junior All-Ireland by defeating London in Croke Park. In 1993 the County team was promoted to senior ranks with no success.\n\nIn 1994 and 1995 the tide was turning for the girls in senior ranks with the Monaghan girls playing in the All-Ireland finals and suffered defeats on both occasions.\n\nIn 1996 Monaghan success story was about to unfold once again.\n\nFollowing list of titles won at National level:\n\n1992 – All Ireland Junior\n\n1996/1997 All Ireland Senior\n\n1995/1997 All Ireland U/14\n\n1994/1998/1999 All Ireland Minor\n\n1994/1996/1997/1999/2001 National League\n\nRunner-Up:\n\n1992 Junior League\n\n1993/1995 All Ireland Senior\n\n1996/ All Ireland U14\n\n1995/1997 All Ireland U/16\n\n2002 All Ireland U/18\n\n2002 National League\n\nA number of Monaghan players have figured on the Inter-provincial team dating back to 1992-2002, and a number of girls have played on successful Inter-provincial teams of 1999 and 2002.\n\nA number of girls have received All Star awards.\n\nWe hope all associated in Cumann Peile Gael Na mBan that Monaghan success story will continue to flourish in many years to come.\n\nNo Clubs registered 2003.\n\nAdult – 16\n\nSenior – 5\n\nIntermediate – 5\n\nJunior – 6\n\nUnder age – 22\n\nMORE LADIES GAA PUBLICITY – RICE\n\nPublicity of Ladies Gaelic Football was strongly challenged at the Annual Ladies’ Congress in Monaghan Four Seasons Hotel in 1993.\n\nMr Peter Rice, President of the Association, told the 70-odd delegates representing all Counties in Ireland: “Vitally important to the development of our game is publicity, an area in which efforts need to be improved”.\n\nThe President said that the National Newspapers gave good coverage to the All-Ireland finals but had given little else over the year\n\nHe said he was not satisfied with the coverage RTE television gave to the Association in the past year.\n\n“The finals were shown on Sports night on RTE”, he said. “But the television coverage would not have been possible if this Association hadn’t paid a large sum to have a camera made available to record the game for RTE”.\n\nMr. Rice felt that this was not very fair to an Association which is struggling to make “ends meet”. He said the “time has come to broadcast a live radio commentary of a Senior final and, in addition, called on RTE to treat the Ladies’ Gaelic Football Association fairly and give much needed publicity to the game.\n\nMr. Rice also felt that ladies football results should be included in all results programmes on television and radio on Sunday evenings.\n\nAll P.RO.’s he said, At Club, County, Provincial and National level should work hard to ensure that publicity is given the priority it deserves.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Rice said he was satisfied with the development of the Association in the past year, saying, “Donegal, Tyrone, Armagh and Limerick had entered competition for the first time and in the past month, County Boards have been formed in Tipperary, Louth and Fermanagh.\n\nThe delegates heard of the development of new ties with the Ontario Ladies Football Association which led to the Canadian side undertaking a very successful tour of Ireland in the summer. Mr. Rice also pointed out that a very successful Championship was run in the United States of America and that a North American Championship was in the pipeline. He said another good area for development was in schools at all levels.\n\nThe Annual Congress was attended by Maureen Looney of Toronto, representing the Ontario Ladies Football Association. Other distinguished persons present were Monaghan County Board Chairman, Mr. Aidan Quigley and delegates from London.\n\nPresident praises Monaghan girls:\n\nHappy memories of Ladies Gaelic Football last season in Monaghan were revived for Monaghan at the Annual Ladies Congress in the Four Seasons Hotel last weekend.\n\nFor Monaghan it marked another famous achievement in being selected as the first-ever Ulster County to host the Ladies Congress following their sensational Junior All-Ireland Triumph in Croke Park.\n\nPresident of the Association Mr. Peter Rice revealed Saturday that the Presidents of the Camogie Association and the G.A.A. were at the Ladies’ All-Ireland Final Day in Croke Park. “They had gained good first impressions of ladies football – he said. “And as a result congratulions must go to the teams who took part for the high level of skills, displayed”.\n\nThe President also praised the Committee at Kilmacud Croke’s grounds for their assistance in running the very successful Seven-a-side Competition the same All-Ireland weekend. Also Sponsors A.I.B.\n\nHe went on to say:” I would like to thank my fellow officers on Central Council, all of them forming part of a hard working group. I would further like to thank anyone who has helped with the promotion of the game – the referees, G.A.A. Clubs and County Boards for the use of their grounds and our sponsors.\n\nI wish all of you success in your ambitions for sporting honours in the coming season and I hope for successful competition in 1993. We should all realise that Ladies football is a rapidly growing sport. It is a great game and we should all be proud of the progress made in promoting the game”, Mr. Rice said.\n\n‘Should be full co-operation between men and ladies’ Association – Quigley\n\nThe G.A.A. is open to everyone, says Monaghan County Board Chairman Mr Aidan Quigley. Speaking at last weekends Ladies’ Congress in the Four Seasons Hotel, Quigley said he supported the idea that there should be full co-operation between the men and Ladies’ Associations.\n\n“I would certainly welcome good co-operation between the two Associations which would enhance the sport for everyone.\n\nHe also congratulated Mr. Oliver Gavan (Aghabog) on his appointment to Ulster President and also welcomed the appointment of Mr. Paddy Clerkin to the position of Chairman of the Monaghan Ladies Association.\n\nAt Congress, Mr. Hughie McElvaney of Elco Oils, who helped the Monaghan Ladies Association financially last season, said they will continue to sponsor the Ladies game.\n\nIn his Opening Address, the Chairman of the Monaghan Ladies Board, Mr. Paddy Clerkin, said that Monaghan were honoured to host the 1993 Annual Congress on behalf of Ulster.\n\nHighlight of last years season for Monaghan was the winning of a Junior All-Ireland League title and finishing runners-up in the National League.\n\n“With ladies football only in its infancy in Monaghan our achievements should serve as an example to other Counties in proving that hard work, determination and a little luck will reap its rewards”, Clerkin said.\n\nUlster President Mr. Oliver Gavan, in his address, said that the introduction of ladies’ football to the six counties was warmly welcomed, pointing out that 52 per cent of the total population are female.\n\nMONAGHAN LADIES MAKE FOOTBALL HISTORY\n\nAlways the most vocal, guaranteed to be the best turned-out breed in attendance and certain to add colour to the most dismal of occasions, your average lady Gaelic football supporter is something special to the G.A.A. Always has been and no more so than in County Monaghan where little in the way of cricket, rugby or soccer has ever been known to titillate the fancy of the fair sex in the same invigorating fashion.\n\nIn modern times, interest among the ladies in football in the Farney County probably reached its crescendo back in 1979 when the Ulster provincial Championship football title was scooped after many barren years in the competitive wilderness. From then onwards, the popularity of the game snowballed, united the sexes in the border county like never before and begun a mini-football mania within the confines of primary schools from Truagh of Kilanny and from Clontibret to Aghabog.\n\nFive years before Monaghan’s aforementioned title success, the Ladies Gaelic Association was founded. Primarily bolstered by Counties south of Athlone, the northern counties of Ulster didn’t get to grip with the structures of the new organisation and it wasn’t until the Spring of 1991 that Magheracloone clubman Philip Kelly inspired the setting up of Ladies Football in County Monaghan.\n\nPhilip Kelly was elected to serve as the Boards first Chairman, while also elected were Oliver Gavan, Vice-Chairman Secretary: Eileen McElvaney; treasurer: Elizabeth Martin: Owen Martin P.R.O: Paddy Flood Youth Officer: Assistant Treasurer Anita Finnegan and Assistant Treasurer Brenda Macklin. The fledgling lady stars on the Monaghan football scene had now their own governing body in site and more importantly had the necessary backing to drive a coach and six through the ranking system headed by teams such as Kerry, Waterford and Clare.\n\nContrary to what was later to transpire Monaghan’s crusade to gain a distant foothold in Ladies Football, was, at first, a wee bit disconcerting. As one of the few Ulster teams affiliated to the Association, wreaking the power base of the Munster Counties was never going to be easy but the rise and rise of club football in Monaghan suggested that the core of talent and support was there to shake the status quo.\n\nVictories over relative newcomers Meath and Roscommon heralded an unbeaten run by the County Junior team in the 1992 division three league. Other wins over Armagh and Tyrone gained Monaghan a top-of-the-table spot and a home tie against Dublin in Rockcorry some seven weeks ago. A four point win for Monaghan thus set up the County for magnificently appetising decider against Cork in less than a weeks time (an October 18th date has been provisionally fixed with possibly Portlaoise playing host).\n\nWith a brilliant League run under their belts Monaghan’s effort was stepped up for this years Junior Championship campaign. The players response to the cause was unwavering and with Tyholland clubman Owen McNally assuming the trainers mantle, competition for places among upwards on fifty players was immense.\n\nWith Paddy Flood’s own Aghabog club youngsters forming the backbone of the County panel, the Monaghan camp had the look of a familiar parish team. United, cohesive and spirited, a winning formula in fact.\n\nMeeting the winners of the Armagh versus Tyrone Championship tie rep-presented Monaghan’s first big challenge. Eventually it was the girls from the County Armagh who confronted the would be champs. In the quarter-final at Castleblayney, the home side provided several glimpses of their potential when cruising to an eight point victory.\n\nA semi-final duel with Connacht Supremos Galway loomed on the horizon and the training was stepped up by team selectors Philip Kelly, Ray Finnegan, Owen McNally, Bernadette Beggan and Michael Morgan. The training at Aughnamullen may have been the inspiration for some pains and aches but the hard work reaped huge dividends as Galway were handed a 2-7 to 0-1 trouncing. The celebrations erupted, Monaghan had reached the All-Ireland but the champagne remained on ice, for the time being at least!\n\nFaced with the prospect of meeting hot favourites London in the October the 4th final date, the Monaghan team-management strengthened their hand by enlisting the services of former Monaghan County player Gerry McCarville and Castleblayney Faugh’s team manager Gerry Fitzpatrick as advisors. The combination according to County Board Vice-Chairman Oliver Gavan were ‘inspirational’ figures and were a big help to the ladies. We were fortunate to have been able to call on men of their calibre for assistance”.\n\nLondon. Making their fourth appearance in an All-Ireland final since 1988, were the more experienced squad but it was newcomers Monaghan who made the early running, going ahead by 1-3 to 0-2 after thirteen minutes of play, in the Croke Park showdown. Despite going in at the break level at 1-4 a piece, it was the England based team who forced the pace as the second half gathered ground and they looked in the driving seat when leading by 2-6 to 1-7 with just over one minute remaining.\n\nIt was then that the Blue & Whites dug deepest. Knowing that only a goal could lift them out of hells fire, the Ulster side threw everything forward and a foul in the square on full forward Angela Larkin prompted a thunderous sigh of relief from hordes of Monaghan fans.\n\nMairead Kelly’s subsequent, successful spot kick and Angela Larkin’s insurance point immediately afterwards made the earlier roar sound like a half-hearted effort as Monaghan clinched victory on a 2-8 to 2-6 score line. A brilliantly spirited victory, due reward for all 24 panel members and mentors and a place in Ladies Football history for Monaghan.\n\nIn particular, the laurels go to the eighteen girls who pulled the game out of the fire to clinch the title in such dramatic fashion.\n\nAnne Gavan: Although an ace attacker with her club Aghabog, Anne possesses the safest pair of hands in Ladies football by virtue of her consistent performances all season, a product of mini-sevens 88-89.\n\nCatherine Finnegan: A Magheracloone lass who specialises in tackling hard but fairly. Never allows her concentration to lapse during a game.\n\nMary Hamill: A very strong defender, the Aughnamullen stalwart cleared the danger on several occasions during the final with tremendous lengthy deliveries.\n\nJennifer Treanor: A tigerish corner back who hails from the Monaghan Harps club, Jennifer is one of the best tacklers in the game.\n\nMairead Kelly: One of the products of the INTO G.A.A. Mini Sevens experiment, the Aghabog wing half back seldom allows her opponent much room to operate or manoeuvre.\n\nAisling Smyth: Aisling does a lot of unseen work for the team and is perfect Lynchpin for the Aghabog and County teams.\n\nJennifer Greenan: Played in the INTO G.A.A games on All-Ireland final day in ’88 and has continued to delight with her superb ball control.\n\nLinda Farrelly: A tailor-made midfielder with a good pair of hands, Linda looks set for a lengthy spell in a top-class football.\n\nBrenda McAnespie: One of the best known players on the team and a born leader. Brenda’s experience and running of the ball sets her out as one of the games top stars.\n\nMargaret Kierans: Another Aghabog ace whose stamina and eye for scores has played a major part in Monaghan’s trail of glory. Team Captain and inspirational figure.\n\nEileen McElvaney: a real terrier-like player who never stops hunting for possession. Can take her score and is stylish in possession.\n\nOrla Gartlan: a tireless member of the team from the Carrickmacross club. Orla possesses a great right foot and can often be seen helping out around midfield.\n\nMichelle Murphy: one of the fittest players on the team. Michelle is an opportunist attacker whose enthusiasm for the game is positively catching.\n\nAngela Larkin: Find of the Year, Angela did Corduff proud by her display in the All-Ireland final. Fouled for the vital last-minute penalty and clipped over the insurance point for good measure.\n\nMary O’Callaghan: Scored Monaghan’s opening goal with a brave fisted effort which provided her side with a tremendous launching pad and much needed confidence. A sterling performer.\n\nMairead Sheridan: A valuable member of the panel and one of the leading lights of the progressive Rockcorry club. An exciting prospect.\n\nBrenda Macklin: a member of the ’91 Monaghan squad also, Brenda played very well when brought on in the second half and showed no signs of nerves whatsoever.\n\nPauline Woods: Speedy and a quality player to have in reserve, Pauline’s camogie experience certainly helped her adapt to the Croke Park atmosphere when introduced in the final.\n\nTo complete the Underage competition for 1994, Magheracloone took the Under 14 title. All competitions were very capably run by the County Board with Paddy Clerkin of Kilmore/Drumsnatt as chairman: Susanne Murphy and later Phoebe Carroll of Rockcorry as vice-chairperson; Brenda Macklin of Monaghan as secretary, and Phoebe Carroll as treasurer. Owen McNally of Tyholland was an excellent PRO. Other officers were Paul Swift, Mary Connolly, Fiona Carolan, Johnnie Kelly, Joe Sherry, Maurice Kindlon, Mary Foy, Brenda McAnespie and the Ulster President, Oliver Gavan.\n\nTeam managements were: Brendan Finnegan (Donaghmoyne), Mary Foy (Carrickmacross) and Martin Connolly (Clones) for the senior team:\n\nMichael Morgan (Monaghan), Kevin O’Callaghan (Inniskeen) and Paddy Clerkin (Kilmore/Drumsnatt) for the Under 16 team; and Mary Foy (Carrickmacross), Anita Finnegan (Aughnamullen) and Tina Rooney (Rockcorry) for the U14 team.\n\nA brief history of Ladies Football in Co. Monaghan, the first County Board was formed in 1991 in the Riverdale Hotel, Ballybay to become the first county in Ulster since 1977 to take part in official competitions at club, county and National level and went on to become the most successful county in the province in modern time. There were 11 clubs taking part in official competitions within the county for U-14, U-16, minor, senior and a county junior team. The following officers elected were:\n\nChairman: Philip Kelly (Magheracloone)\n\nVice Chairman: Oliver Gavan (Aghabog)\n\nSecretary: Eileen McElvaney (Monaghan Harps)\n\nAsst Secretary: Brenda Macklin (Aughnamullen)\n\nTreasurer: Elizabeth Martin (Magheracloone)\n\nAsst Treasurer: Anita Finnegan (Aughnamullen)\n\nRegistrar: Marie Gargan (Magheracloone)\n\nAlso present were the President of Peil Gael Na mBan Peter Rice (Wexford) Secretary Christy Byrne (Westmeath), P.R.O. Helen O’Rourke (Dublin).\n\nOne problem which multiplies each year is a difficulty in finding sufficient officers who are willing to devote their free time to any organisation so that ladies are no different, the ever popular Anita Finnegan moved to secretary other to secretary other position filled were Dev officer Paddy Flood N.T (Aghabog), P.R.O. Owen McNally. Vice chairman took over the roll as acting chairman and had the honour of steering the county through its first year. All the competitions were won by Aghabog and also became the first club to represent the county and province in the club championship. The county junior team took part in the National League winning one, drew one and lost six.\n\nThe full fixtures for ’91 elsewhere, all in all the first year were quite a success. In 1992 P. J Finnegan (Magheracloone) was elected chairman and the girls of Monaghan were to become widely known for their exploits and talent on the talent on the football field with the first major success coming when the county junior team beat Armagh in the Ulster Championship final played in Castleblayney referee Liam Ford (Galway). They went on to win the All-Ireland title in Croke Park. The Monaghan success story was about to unfold. In 1993 the county team was promoted to senior ranks and had a poor season in the higher grade but in 1994 the tide was turning with the senior winning the senior National league for the first time captained by Linda Farley (Carrickmacross) this victory was history making with the vice president of central council. Monaghan man Oliver Gavan presenting the cup to the Monaghan captain also the county minor team winning their first All-Ireland at underage captained by Ann Gavan (Aghabog) who also was vice captain of the senior team, in 94 – 95 they suffered defeats on both occasions by Waterford but the U-14 won the All-Ireland. In 1996 success came in a big way under Des Patton as manager of the county team when they won the All-Ireland for the first time captained by Margaret Kierans (Aghabog) who also captained the ’92 All-Ireland junior team. They went on to win back-to-back titles in league as well.\n\nThe 1997 team was captained by Angela Larkin (Corduff). In 1998 they failed to old rivals Waterford and failed to appear in Croke Park until 2002. The 2002 season proved successful winning four Ulster titles out of five and finally loosing out to Mayo by one point. From 1991 – 2002 many clubs went on to compete in All-Ireland club championship semi-finals and finals with All-Ireland titles going to Monaghan Harps and Tyholland great credit must go to both clubs. The full Monaghan story is taken from the Monaghan yearbook.\n\nJunior League Round VI\n\nRound 1 Galway (H) v Offaly 02-06-91\n\nMonaghan (H) v Longford 14-04-91 G Wrynn Limerick (H) v Monaghan 02-06-91\n\nCarlow (H) Offaly 14-05-91 C Maher Kerry (H) v Carlow 02-06-91\n\nMayo (H) v Galway 14-04-91 R Burke Longford (H) v Clare 02-06-91\n\nLimerick Bye 14-04-91 L Forde (Midweek) Mayo Bye\n\nRound II Round VII\n\nLongford (H) v Mayo 21-04-91 C Byrne Clare (H) v Carlow 23-06-91\n\nLimerick (H) v Carlow 28-04-91 K Greene Offaly (H) v Longford 23-06-91\n\nOffaly (H) v Monaghan 28-04-91 M Hopkins Monaghan (H) v Kerry 23-06-91 Dublin venue\n\nKerry (H) v Galway 28-04-91 J Hayes Limerick (H) v Mayo 23-06-91\n\nClare Bye Galway Bye\n\nRound III Round VIII\n\nGalway (H) v Longford 05-05-91 C Byrne Kerry (H) v Offaly 30-06-91\n\nLimerick (H) v Clare 05-05-91 L Forde Mayo (H) v Clare 30-06-91\n\nMayo (H) v Kerry 05-05-91 R Burke Monaghan (H) v Galway 30-06-91\n\nMonaghan (H) v Carlow 05-05-91 S O’Rourke Longford (H) v Limerick 30-06-91\n\nOffaly Bye Carlow Bye\n\nRound IV Round IX\n\nClare (H) v Offaly 19-05-91 Longford (H) v Kerry 21-07-91 Westmeath venue\n\nMayo (H) v Monaghan 19-05-91 Carlow (H) v Mayo 21-07-91\n\nGalway (H) v Limerick 19-05-91 Galway (H) v Clare 21-07-91\n\nCarlow (H) v Longford 19-05-91 Offaly (H) v Limerick 21-07-91\n\nKerry Bye Monaghan Bye\n\nRound V\n\nKerry (H) v Limerick 26-05-91\n\nClare (H) v Monaghan 26-05-91\n\nOffaly (H) v Mayo 26-05-91\n\nCarlow (H) v Galway 26-05-91\n\nLongford Bye\n\nDOUBLE DOUBLE GLORY\n\nFOR MONAGHAN LADIES\n\nIt was roses, roses all the way might well some up the fortunes of Monaghan’ senior ladies team in 1997 reaching unprecedented heights as they put national league and All-Ireland titles back to back, double glory for these trail blazers who have set a standard that others will seek to emulate in the years ahead. In the league Monaghan ground out result after result in an effort to retain their title but they had to dig very deep as the final went to a replay and old rivals Waterford proved tough nuts to crack. In retrospect it was game in which Monaghan were fortunate enough to get another crack at the title cause they were outscored on the day, Waterford hitting sixteen scores while Monaghan registered ten but significantly four of that ten were goals. But the championship was the one that Monaghan wanted to retain and games like the league final and its replay were the perfect preparation for what turned out to be a hectic series.\n\nThe driving force for the team was to play and beat Waterford in Croke Park, as the Decies county had inflicted two defeats on Monaghan in championship finals at headquarters. Laois had been dispatched in the 1996 final but everyone wanted Waterford in ’97 and they were not disappointed. But such thoughts were a long way off when the season started and Monaghan had a tough league campaign to get through first. But from the start there was a unity of purpose in the squad and a great atmosphere of camaraderie. Mind you these things are helped by having on the panel members of the same families and players being related to each other. There are two sets of sisters on the panel, Michelle and Mairead Murphy and Jennifer and Alison Treanor, Audrey and Orla O’Reilly are sisters-in-law while Margaret Kierans who captained the team in 1996 and Eileen McElvaney are cousins. Four of the successful U16 team and seven of the minor team all played their way on to the senior team for this year’s competition giving Monaghan a squad with one of the lowest average ages in the country.\n\nPreparations were very thorough right from the start of the season with training in Rossmore Park and a number of GAA club grounds gradually building and moulding this squad into a very fit cohesive unit.\n\nThe terrain in Rossmore was particularly suited to the type of varied physical training the mentors wanted given that they could work on stamina and all the other aspects that have to be addressed as a team faces a long demanding campaign. It was a recipe that worked as Monaghan eased their way through the preliminary rounds and qualified for the league quarterfinals. It was in the mantle of a championship, there was no room for slip-ups at this crucial stage, mistakes at this level cost titles and Monaghan’s was on the line. Monaghan had to make the long journey to Hollymount to take on Wexford in the quarter final and showed that they were going to be the team to be reckoned with as they put on a show that Wexford simply could not match. They led from the start and never allowed Wexford to muster any response. Diane Dempsey was scorer in chief with 1-6 and gave a display that showed her to have great talent especially if she got the right possession. She was a nightmare to mark for the Wexford defenders and they were the only ones to suffer from her ability to carry the ball at speed at defences and having caused havoc then finish clinically.\n\nLater in the season she was being compared with Maurice Fitzgerald for her ability to make space and create scores and it is a comparison that the Kerry great should take as a compliment. Monaghan led to half time by eight points to three and Dempsey was on target to extend that lead seconds after the restart. Wexford now trailed by nine points and any chance they might have had was killed off minutes later, again Diane Dempsey was the executioner as she got a touch of a bouncing ball to gently deflect it past the hapless Wexford keeper. It was a score that effectively killed off the Slaney girls, Monaghan wrapping up a comfortable result with a series of six unanswered points to book a place in the semi-final against Clare.\n\nDespite home advantage in this one the Banner girls carried the game to Monaghan and for long spells it looked as if they might cause an upset. Clare came with a game plan, restrict the space available to the Monaghan attack and capitalise on quick breaks. They did this to good effect with Majella Griffith causing all sorts of problems with her long penetrating runs but in the end Monaghan came good and goal injury time saw them through. It was not the fast exciting fare that Monaghan usually produce but conditions mitigated against that and at times the fare on offer was not of a very high standard. Clare led by 0-4 to 0-1 having had slightly the better of the exchanges for quite some time in the first half but just when it looked as if they would go in for the break with that deficit Monaghan struck for a great goal, Niamh Kindlon fielding Jenny Grennan’s forty five and slamming to the net to level matters and give Monaghan a great boast at that vital time. Clare opened the scoring with a point but Monaghan replied almost immediately with a great goal when Diane Dempsey pounced on a loose ball to fist to the Clare net to put Monaghan in front for the first time. Buoyed up by this Monaghan exerted further pressure and they extended their lead with three unanswered points, which saw them ahead by six. But it wasn’t all one way traffic as Clare responded but Monaghan felt hard done by when Linda Farrelly picked up a nasty shoulder injury but did not get the free they expected while Clare capitalised on this momentary lapse to slam in a goal that brought them right back into the game. It was now all up for grabs and Clare sensing that they could pull it off attacked relentlessly and were rewarded with two points from Clare Daly and that scourge of Monaghan Majella Griffin to leave just the minimum between them with time almost up. Angela Larkin bought a little respite for Monaghan with a point but as the game went into injury time Clare roared back with equalising scores from who else, Majella Griffin and the second from Carmel Eustace.\n\nDeep in injury time the next score would win it that it would be Monaghan as Doohamlet’s Rosie Hughes earned for herself a little bit of glory when she won possession out in the corner and lobbed the ball across only to see her shot dip and elude everyone as it sailed under the bar for the match winning goal. A lucky let-off, a master stroke, call it what you will but it meant that Monaghan were still league champions and a date with Waterford to see where the 1997 league title would rest.\n\nThe first meeting proved inconclusive with the sides finishing level after an excellent game in which fortunes ebbed and flowed. Goals again did the trick for Monaghan with senior debutant Edel Byrne bursting onto the scene with an excellent goal that she made and took herself, winning possession and running at the defence before hitting a screamer into the roof of the net for a score that has become hallmark of her play.\n\nWaterford continued to pick off points and it took another goal this time finished by Niamh Kindlon after a sweeping move to bring Monaghan to within a point of Waterford at half time when the score stood at Waterford 0-9, Monaghan 2-2. The third quarter was mostly Waterford as they opened a six point gap and things looked a little ominous for the league champions. But Monaghan were not going to surrender their title as easily as that they hit back with a series of scores before taking the lead four minutes with a second goal from Edel Byrne. Waterford though did not panic and came back to level the issue and take the final to a replay. Final score Monaghan 4-6, Waterford 1-15.\n\nSo it was back to Ballinasloe for the replay and what a day for Monaghan football as not only did the seniors retain their league crown but the U14 squad also took home the silverware when they accounted for a very fancied Kerry side. In the senior game Monaghan served notice on all and sundry that they are the team to beat and anyone with eyes on their titles will have to fight very hard to unseat them. Monaghan laid the foundations for this great victory in a blistering first half that saw them overrun Waterford and go in at halftime with an eighteen point advantage, another special from Edel Byrne started the goal rush that say Monaghan hit three in a purple twenty minute patch, Anita O’Reilly notching two with great opportunism as Waterford could only wonder just what had happened. As well as those three specials Monaghan also registered eleven points in the entire first half.\n\nNo one was under any illusion though that the game was over at this stage and they would have been foolish to have written a team like Waterford off so easily. Back they came with a flourish and pinned Monaghan back in their own half for long periods. The pressure was unbelievable and led to a series of points but Monaghan fought like the tigers with Martina Grey playing her part with a number of good saves, one from a hotly dispute penalty but Waterford hit two good goals and series of points to reduce Monaghan’s lead to a very manageable level. Monaghan to their credit did not panic but with astute switching they were able to come to grips with the Waterford storm and hit a couple of points that kept their noses in front. An Aine Wall goal entering the final minutes however put a very different complexion on the situation with Monaghan now dangerously only three points in front but salvation was at hand and who better to deliver it than the wonder kid from Magheracloone, Edel Byrne picked up a loose ball and in the words of one witness buried it in the back of the Waterford net for the killer score.\n\nA golden goal from the golden girl and while Waterford threw everything at Monaghan in the dying minutes and seconds they could only manage a point leaving Monaghan still senior league champions at the end of what had been a breathtaking final. Final score Monaghan 4-15, Waterford 3-13.\n\nMonaghan’s Run to Glory:\n\nQuarter Final: 1-17 Wexford 0-6.\n\nMartina Grey, Audrey O’Reilly, Mairead Kelly, Eileen McElvaney, Niamh Kindlon, Brenda McAnespie, Cathriona Brady, Anita O’Reilly 0-1, Linda Farrelly 0-1, Michelle Murphy, Angela Larkin 0-5, Brenda Swift 0-1, Margaret Kierans 0-2, Diane Dempsey 1-6, Orla Kelly.\n\nSubs: Catherine Finnegan, Mairead Murphy, Carmel McMahon 0-1, Davina McCaffrey, Aine Gilsenan.\n\nSemi Final: Monaghan 3-6 Clare 1-9.\n\nMartina Grey, Anita Reilly, Mairead Kelly, Eileen McElvaney, Catriona Brady, Brenda McAnespie, Niamh Kindlon 1-0, Linda Farrelly, Jenny Greenan, Brenda Swift 0-1, Angela Larkin 0-5, Audrey O’Reilly, Michelle Murphy, Diane Dempsey 1-0, Orla Reilly.\n\nSubs used: Rosie Hughes 1-0, Margaret Kierans.\n\nNational League Final: Monaghan 4-6 Waterford 1-15\n\nMartina Grey, Eileen McElvaney, Mairead Kelly, Audrey O’Reilly, Michelle Murphy, Brenda McAnespie, Catriona Brady, Linda Farrelly, Jenny Grennan, Brenda Swift, Angela Larkin 0-4, Niamh Kindlon 2-1, Diane Dempsey, Margaret Kierans, Edel Byrne 2-1.\n\nSub used: Anita O’Reilly\n\nReplay: Monaghan 4-15 Waterford 3-13\n\nMartina Grey, Michelle Murphy, Mairead Kelly, Anita O’Reilly, Eileen McElvaney 0-1, Brenda McAnespie, Catriona Brady, Linda Farrelly, Jenny Grennan 0-2, Niamh Kindlon, Angela Larkin 0-3, Audrey O’Reilly 2-1, Edel Byrne 2-3, Diane Dempsey 0-4, Margaret Kierans 0-1.\n\nSub used: Brenda Swift\n\nDouble Glory\n\nThe league title had been retaining the double. Doubles in any competition are not easily retained so Monaghan faced a stiff challenge. With no senior championship in Ulster Monaghan were automatically through to the All-Ireland semi-final where they met Mayo and it wasn’t until the second half that they imposed themselves on the game. Mayo got off to a good start and with Cora Staunton causing all sorts of problems they took an early lead with Monaghan not getting on the scoresheet until the 12th minute when Edel Byrne converted from play. Monaghan settled a little bit better now and actually took the lead but Mayo rallied and the sides went in level at halftime when the score stood at 1-4 apiece. In the second half Monaghan moved up a gear and goals by Diane Dempsey (2) along with a series of points from a much more fluid forward line had the result wrapped up long before the final whistle.\n\nSo it was back to Croke Park and another bout with the auld enemy, Waterford. They had never the dominant team in ladies football. They had played five finals in Croke Park and won all five starting with the junior championship back in 1986 and then four senior titles in 1991, ’92, ’94 and ’95. On their path to the final they had beaten Kerry, Clare and Meath and amassed a total of twelve goals and twenty nine points in the process while conceding a measly three goals and fifteen points. An experienced team bent on taking back their All-Ireland title avenging their league final defeat earlier in the season. Sunday October 12th was D Day in Croke Park and what a dramatic day it turned out to be. A game that had all the passion, skill and artistry that one could expect and a game too that saw people experience the complete range of emotions from sheer elation to being broken-hearted. The thrills and spills, the scores, the near misses, the taste of victory, the scent of defeat, they were all there as Monaghan retained their All Ireland crown but not before Waterford had put them through the wringer in heart stopping second half.\n\nAs in the league final the first half belonged to Monaghan and they played some magnificent football, good handling, quick precise passing and a combination of speed and skill in setting up moves that had Waterford trailing in their wake. Golden girl Edel Byrne again showed the way with Diane Dempsey and Niamh Kindlon also doing great work. Dempsey with her speed and ball carrying ability down the left and Kindlon with a goal that will rank with the best from any competition this year as she unleashed a screamer from about twenty metres out that the Waterford keeper could do absolutely nothing about. In defence Monaghan had stars aplenty with Brenda McAnespie holding the middle and her fellow defenders all doing their jobs and restricting Waterford to crumbs as they swept up everything that the Decies county could muster that Kindlon goal restored Monaghan’s superiority after Waterford had plundered a three pointer against the run of play and they finished the half with a flourish hitting three unanswered points to go 2-9 to 1-3 up at half time.\n\nEven though Monaghan were nine points in front they knew this game wasn’t won and in the dressing room at halftime they prepared themselves for the onslaught they knew would come. Edel Byrne described the Monaghan camp at the interval as “very quiet, there was silence in the dressing room, we knew that Waterford would come back at us and we had to steel ourselves to keep up our work rate. We had a good lead but we had to concentrate so that Waterford would not get into the game”. Despite the best intentions however that is exactly what Waterford did as they hit Monaghan like a whirlwind right from the throw-in for the second half. They exerted increasing pressure and hit six points inside nine minutes to reduce Monaghan’s lead to a mere three points. Monaghan were working extremely hard to contain this initiative and Diane Dempsey bought a little respite with a point but immediately Waterford were again on the offensive for six more that took them two point clear of the champions. Waterford’s record now began to edge its way into people’s minds, Monaghan were entering dangerous territory and time was running out. The pace and competitiveness of the game was taking its toll and a number of Monaghan players had to receive treatment for cramp with a resulting number of stoppages in play. It was something that was eventually to work in Monaghan’s favour as it was in that extra time that they engineered the recovery that saw them snatch a dramatic victory. Two minutes from time Monaghan were back level. A minute from time Waterford were in front again and as injury time mounted Monaghan levelled and then took a dramatic lead when Edel Byrne sent over the bar.\n\nIt was a slender lead and still the injury time mounted. Monaghan earned a free and up stepped Edel Byrne to take what was a pressure kick a point would put Monaghan two up, a short free could give the ball back to Waterford and it was too close to say that a wide was as good as a point. No one need have feared as Edel steeled herself with thoughts of how she and her fellow U16’s were denied by this same county and inspired by that she dispatched the ball for a match winning score. Unbelievable scenes greeted the final whistle as the huge Monaghan contingent invaded Croke Park to acclaim their heroes. Honour has been satisfied, Monaghan had proved they were no one year wonders, they had retained their league and championship double and while they had been put under severe pressure by Waterford in both finals they had shown themselves to be a team of character who could dig deep when the occasion demanded. Rarely has a team dug deeper that the Monaghan ladies on that Sunday in October. Golden girl Edel Byrne summed it up “it was nerve wrecking stuff it was touch and go right to the end.\n\nThe Decies were brilliant in the second half and at one stage it looked like we were going to get nothing out of the game which would have been grossly unfair after the tremendous teamwork we had put in. We are now the best team in Ireland. When we won last year it wasn’t rated that highly by some people but we have now won it by beating Waterford in Croke Park and we’ve proved we’re the best in Ireland. “. And who can argue with that? After the game Aghabog’s Jenny Greenan was named as AIB Player of the match and while Edel Byrne was certainly in contention for that honour and was given awards afterwards Greenan’s overall contribution warranted such recognition. Her leadership on the field was inspirational and when the going got tough, well she proved the old adage, the tough got going and she rallied Monaghan at that vital time and struck for a vital score when things were very delicately balanced at the end. A true star among a galaxy of stars and a performance that will inspire others as this ladies game sweeps the land “like a prairie fire”. The best is yet to come. The full Monaghan panel that worked so hard to bring honour and glory to the county: Jenny Greenan, Margaret Kierans, Cathriona Brady, Mairead Kelly, Anne Gavan, Eileen McElvaney, Michelle Murphy, Anita O’Reilly, Alison Treanor, Brenda McAnespie, Brenda Swift, Jennifer Treanor, Mairead Murphy, Carmel McMahon, Aine Gilsenan, Audrey O’Reilly, Linda Farrelly, Orla O’Reilly, Angela Larkin, Davina McCaffrey, Louise McMahon, Martina Grey, Edel Byrne, Niamh Kindlon, Rosie Hughes, Linda Gartland, Diane Dempsey.\n\nAll Ireland Final: Monaghan 2-15 Waterford 1-16\n\nAnd on the day Monaghan lined out as follows:\n\nMartina Grey, Anita O’Reilly, Mairead Kelly, Audrey O’Reilly, Eileen McElvaney, Brenda McAnespie, Cathriona Brady, Jenny Greenan 0-3, Linda Farrelly, Niamh Kindlon 1-0, Angela Larkin 0-3, Edel Byrne 1-4, Linda Garland, Margaret Kierans 0-1, Diane Dempsey 0-4.\n\nSubs: Michelle Murphy for Audrey O’Reilly, Jennifer Treanor for Linda Gartland, Orla O’Reilly for Anita O’Reilly.\n\nMONAGHAN’S GREAT EFFORT\n\nDESERVED BETTER LUCK\n\n(1998)\n\nThe 1998 ladies All-Ireland football and replay have surely gone down in GAA history as two of the most exciting and thrilling games ever seen at Croke Park. Two highly exciting and nail-biting matches that had the record attendances absolutely enthralled, not to mention the huge television audiences that were glued to their television screens earned the plaudits of the nation and the admiration of even the severest of sceptics and critics.\n\nNo longer is Ladies Gaelic football something of a novelty or something to be sneered at, as thousands upon thousands of previously disinterested sports fans have suddenly found a new sport that threatens to put the men’s game in the shade, for its sheer skill, sportsmanship and freedom from aggro and dirt. Monaghan and Waterford, between them, have scored a tremendous victory for women, and for the good of sport … and Gaelic sport at that.\n\nWhat a pity there had to be a loser in this clash of the giants of the ladies game, as neither team deserved to lose. Monaghan, even more so perhaps, as they gained the hearts of everyone for their thrilling and courageous comeback in the drawn game and then their hard luck story in the closing stages of replay, when a draw should have been the least reward for them. As it was, they had finally to concede victory to yet another great team in Waterford, and failed in their great ambition to win three All-Ireland senior football titles in succession, but this team will be back, and in a very short time too.\n\nThe Drawn Game\n\nLouth and Roscommon provided the entertainment in the curtain raiser for the first game on Sunday 4th October, but Monaghan support in the near 17,000 attendance far outnumbered the combined attendances of the other three counties Monaghan lined out for the final as follows: Brenda McAnespie, Anita O’Reilly, Catriona Brady, Audrey O’Reilly, Mairead Kelly, Eileen McElvaney, Niamh Kindlon, Jenny Greenan (Capt), Linda Farrelly, Margaret Kierans, Edel Byrne, Jennifer Treanor, Angela Larkin, Brenda Swift and Diane Dempsey. Ciara McGuinness came on as a substitute in the 50th minute.\n\nMonaghan really ‘went to town’ in the opening half, sweeping the Waterford opposition aside as if they were a set of juveniles. Jenny Greenan and Company simply looked superb, and the favourites from Munster, who had been tipped by all the Dublin scribes, were made to look amateurish. The first of Monaghan’s four great goals came in the 8th minute when Diane Dempsey made the net bulge following some great work by Angela Larkin and Brenda Swift. Monaghan then ran into a 1-3 to 0-1 lead and seemed to be coasting to an easy win.\n\nThe Waterford defence looked dreadfully porous as Monaghan would sweep through for two more goals in this opening thirty minutes; Niamh Kindlon firing home the second in the fourteenth minute and Jennifer Greenan getting the third after the Munster champions had made something of a comeback with some well taken points.\n\nIt was significant that Monaghan also crashed the ball off the woodwork on no less than three occasions in the half, two of them should surely have been in the net, had the Ulster girls been blessed with any sort of luck. Edel Byrne had particularly cruel luck when her superb shot came off the lower part of the upright. Half time arrived with Monaghan comfortably in front by six points on a score line of 3-4 to 0-7.\n\nSuch a lead might have been a happy omen for any team, but Monaghan remembered the 1997 final when they were also six points in front at the interval but Waterford had come back at them in the third quarter and Monaghan had to come from behind to win the title in injury time. Sure enough the pattern was repeated in the 1998 final as Waterford came back with a string of points in the third quarter that sent alarm bells ringing in the Monaghan camp. Despite Maggie Kearns opening point, Waterford’s superb marksmanship gradually reduced the lead, and eventually they went in front, so that midway through the half, Monaghan found themselves trailing 1-1 to 3-5.\n\nThings seemed to be slipping away from Monaghan but spectators had not bargained for their tremendous fighting spirit which would again bring them from behind. Edel Byrne had a point, but Waterford again came with superb points to lead by 1-16 to 3-6, a four points advantage. It was then that the Monaghan mentors sprang Ciara McGuinness from the substitutes bench, and what a transformation the 16 years old Magheracloone start made on this game. Only six minutes on the field and she scored a superb goal that sent the Monaghan supporters into ecstasies. What a comeback, and it was followed only minutes later by an equally superb point from Edel Byrne … the score that levelled matters for Monaghan and put the game to a replay on a date to be arranged.\n\nThe rave reports that appeared in the following days and newspapers were well and truly deserved by the young ladies of both counties and people who had never before witnessed ladies football were loud in their praises of the skills and sportsmanship of both teams.\n\nThe Replay\n\nThe international series with Australia then intervened and meant that the replay could not be held until the last Sunday in October. Many had suggested that it should be played before the Australia games, but this would have been an injustice to these thirty participants. The delay might be long, but there was widespread acclamation when RTE announced the replay would also be televised live … a marvellous tribute to the ladies, and one that paid dividends, as the second meeting provided yet another thriller.\n\nFor the replay, Monaghan started with exactly the same fifteen players, but with quite a bit of reshuffling in both defence and attack. Mairead Kelly moved to full-back where she would mark the dangerous Geraldine O’Ryan.\n\nJennifer Treanor and Niamh Kindlon swapped positions on the left wing, and Edel Byrne moved into the corner of attack. Dublin and Westmeath provided the entertainment in the curtain raiser for this replay.\n\nThis time, however it would be Waterford who would dominate the opening half, as they went about their task in a truly business-like fashion that had Monaghan ruffled for long periods of that first thirty minutes. Angela Larkin opened the scoring with a Monaghan point, but that score seemed to spur the Waterford side into action, and they pressed forward for a series of well-taken points. Monaghan were again in hard luck, with the woodwork coming to Waterford’s rescue, while the Waterford goal was something of a ‘freak’ as the high dipping ball found Brenda McAnespie totally blinded by the strong October sun and dropped into the net behind her for a totally unmerited score. At least three goals were also missed by Monaghan through sheer bad luck in this half, and they found themselves six points in arrears when the interval arrived, exactly the reserve position from the drawn game … Waterford 1-8 Monaghan 0-5.\n\nThe near 14,000 attendance, however, was in for a real thriller in the second period. This time it was Monaghan who came from behind, but not before they had let Waterford take a huge lead of no less than ten points at one stage. That lead was again built up by Waterford’s deadly accuracy; their two corner forwards seeming unable to send the ball anywhere but between the uprights. The ultimate winners would score 1-6 in this half, but would still be out-scored by Monaghan, who had 3-3 to their credit, the three goals coming in a pulsating finish that had the crowd on their toes in absolute breathless excitement.\n\nWaterford were leading by ten points 2-11 to 0-7, when Monaghan suddenly sprang to life and showed what champions are truly made off. Linda Farrelly had the first of the three goals and Maggie Kearns added a point. Diane Dempsey scored goal number two, and now there was only a goal between them. Waterford had a point but Niamh Kindlon had goal number three and now there was only a point between them. Ciara McGuinness came on as in the drawn game. Waterford came back for two more points, but Monaghan again put on the pressure and only a brilliant save by the Waterford goalkeeper and then the Waterford woodwork, denied them the goal they so richly deserved that would have given them a draw and put the game into extra time. That was the least that Monaghan deserved, considering that they had again struck the opposition’s posts on no less than five occasions in this second half. Final Score: Waterford 2-14 Monaghan 3-8.\n\nThe title was lost, but certainly not the honour. Monaghan Ladies had provided football entertainment second to none, and proof they were true and deserving champions for the two previous years. The three-in-a-row just was not to be, but they were still the heroines of Co. Monaghan and deservedly acclaimed a such when they returned home to a truly warm reception.\n\nMonaghan had lined out: Martina Grey (Scotstown), Una McNally (Tyholland), Anita O’Reilly (Monaghan Harps), Catherine McCarville (Scotstown), Michelle Lavelle (Monaghan Harps), Jenny Greenan (Aghabog), Mary Croarkin (Aghabog), Catriona Brady (Captain Aghabog), Aisling Tierney (Clones), Lavina Connolly (Latton), Niamh Kindlon (Magheracloone), Aisling Smith (Aghabog),\n\nLorraine Freeman (Magheracloone), Diane Dempsey (Latton) and Slainey Murray (Monaghan Harps).\n\nSubs used: Pamela Treanor (Tyholland)\n\nMonaghan fortunes in the league were also of the very unlucky variety. Competing in Division One, they score a magnificent early 2-8 to 1-7 win over Mayo, the reigning All-Ireland champions on Sunday 11th February, when the scorers were Diana Dempsey 1-0, Breda McGinn 1-0, Jenny Greenan 0-2, Orla Callan 0-2, Aisling Tierney 0-2, Una McNally 0-1 and Anita O’Reilly 0-1. On Sunday 18th February they met Waterford in Dublin and again put on a super show to win by 4-12 to 1-8, to prove beyond doubt that they were the best team in the country – defeating the successive All-Ireland champions of the three previous years. Unfortunately they fell to Clare by 4-6 to 1-8 in the next outing at Mullingar but they still led the league table with six points from four games.\n\nThey made up for the lapse with a decisive 1-9 to 0-6 win over Longford at Longford on Sunday 8th April, to maintain the top position. The good form was maintained even though there was a slip up to Tyrone, losing by 1-10 to 0-9 at Augher on Sunday 20th May. Despite this they were guaranteed a semi-final spot and in this, they defeated Tyrone again at Latton on Saturday 2nd June on a very impressive score line of Monaghan 5-9 Tyrone 1-5, the scores coming from Niamh Kindlon (2-3), Orla Callan (2-1), Jenny Greenan (1-1), Diane Dempsey (0-2), Lavina Connolly (0-1).\n\nThe league final was played at Mullingar on Sunday 24th June with Monaghan looking for their fifth National League title in eight years. Unfortunately they ran up against Clare, who emerged narrow winners by 2-10 to 1-10. It was a very closely contested game and Clare just about shaded the issue. Monaghan lined out as follows: Martina Grey, Donna Toal, Anita O’Reilly, Michelle Lavelle, Una McNally, Jenny Greenan, Mary Croarkin, Catriona Brady, Ciara Mulligan, Lavina Connolly, Niamh Kindlon, Aisling Smith, Aisling Tierney, Diane Dempsey and Orla Callen.\n\nSubs used: Slainey Murray and Breda McGinn.\n\nJuniors Fall to Armagh\n\nNor did Lady Luck favour Monaghan in the Ulster Junior Championship. In the semi-final at Gavan Duffy Park, Monaghan, on Sunday 22nd July the junior squad fell heavily to Armagh, who triumphed on a final score-line of Armagh 5-10, Monaghan 2-6. It was a disappointing day for the home side but tremendous whole hearted performance were still given by Orla McKeown, Leone Callan, Amanda Beggan and Voreen Quigley in a side which lined out as follows:\n\nAlison Treanor, Leone McCallan, Orla McKeown, Martina Sullivan, Deirdre Patton, Davina McCaffrey, Lorraine Connolly, Elaine Greenan, Fiona Kindlon, Aileen Duffy, Marie Doogan, Seannie McConnell, Amanda Beggan, Voreen Quigley and Mary Connolly.\n\nSubs used: Edel Kearns, Nicola Leonard, Mairead Kelly, Emma McGinnity and Janette Newell. The scorers were: Amanda Beggan 0-5, Voreen Quigley 0-2 and Mary Connolly 1-0.\n\nDAME FORTUNE DESERTS\n\nIf ever Monaghan Ladies football had an unlucky year, 2001 must surely have been it. Despite the fact that they were still contenders for the Ulster title as well as being potential candidates for All-Ireland honours, they find themselves ending the year empty handed of an Ulster adult title, writes Seamus McCluskey.\n\nPrior to 2000 Monaghan had represented Ulster in the All-Ireland series as they were the only senior side in county and province with pride and took two All-Ireland Senior Championships to prove the fact.\n\nFollowing their Junior All-Ireland win in 1999 Tyrone stepped up to senior level in 2000 and met Monaghan in the first ever Ulster Senior Final, with the result going against the Monaghan cailini. Then Down arrived on the scene for 2001, having won Junior honours the previous year, and this guaranteed a three way contest for Ulster senior title. Ulster Council paired Monaghan and Down for the semi-final with the losers to meet champions Tyrone in a second semi-final.\n\nThe Monaghan semi-final with Down took place at Crossmaglen on Sunday 1st July and resulted in facile win for Monaghan over the All-Ireland junior champions. The final score line for Monaghan 4-21, Down 1-12, did not even fully represent the dominance of the Monaghan ladies. Four first half goals really settled the issue on this occasion and Monaghan were very much in command, even by the half way stage when they led by 4-10 to 0-8, the four majors coming from different players – Orla Callen, Catriona Brady, Niamh Kindlon and Aisling Tierney.\n\nMonaghan lined out as follows: Martina Grey, Una McNally, Anita O’Reilly, Donna Toal, Michelle Lavelle, Jennifer Greenan, Mary Croarkin, Aisling Tierney, Catriona Brady, Lavina Connolly, Niamh Kindlon, Aisling Smith, Orla Callan, Diane Dempsey and Ciara Mulligan.\n\nSubs used: Catherine McCarville, Pamela Treanor, Lorraine Freeman, Cathy McManus and Eileen McElvaney.\n\nTyrone’s victory over Down in the second semi-final meant that the 2001 Ulster final would be a repeat of the 2000 decider. Sunday 12th August was the date and Clones was again the venue. This time Monaghan were going out for revenge and played with a determination seldom seen in their previous outings during the year. They looked the better of the two sides all through and when they led by three points, with time running out, it looked as if the title was on its way back to Monaghan. Time keeping, however, was to play a vital role in this final and when Tyrone scored a goal to level matters, and then had a point deep in injury time, it was curtains for dreadfully disappointed Monaghan team that deserved better.\n\nDespite it being August, the conditions were dreadful for the game, with rain falling throughout. Niamh Kindlon had Monaghan’s early points and scores were level on three occasions during the first quarter. Further points from Kindlon and Jenny Greenan saw Monaghan hold an interval lead of two points, 0-5 to 0-3. Catriona Brady, Aisling Tierney and Niamh Kindlon had further points in the second half to put Monaghan well ahead, 0-8 to 0-3.\n\nBrilliant saves by the Tyrone goalkeeper also prevented Monaghan from going much further ahead but they still looked good, leading by 0-9 to 0-6 with time up. It was then that Tyrone scored the goal that really devastated Monaghan and when they had the winner well into injury time and after the scorer had taken a remarkable number of steps, the house fell in on the Monaghan girls. The final score of Tyrone 1-7, Monaghan 0-9, really did not do justice to Monaghan’s performance and they were at least deserving of a draw. The atmosphere in the Monaghan dressing room after the game summed it all up.\n\nALL-IRELAND JOY FOR MINOR LADIES\n\nA minor team comprised of girls from over the county brought national glory home this year.\n\nWhat a year it was for the Ladies football minor team of Co. Monaghan. All-Ireland champions, and a place in the GAA History books of the county. Fielding a team extremely representative of the county, with clubs as far apart as Magheracloone and Emyvale, these young ladies did the county proud and gave a lead to their senior counterparts and, even more importantly, to the male footballers of the county.\n\nThe March meeting of the County Board appointed Mary Fox (Carrickmacross), Brendan Finnegan (Aughnamullen) and Owen McNally (Tyholland) to take charge of this magnificent squad and they were to be assisted by the senior team management of Michael Morgan, Paul Swift and Cathal Hand; all of them seasoned campaigners and people who could be depended upon to get the very best out of their young charges. The trust placed in them at such an early stage of the year was certainly vindicated by events and results later in the season.\n\nFor the opening round of the Ulster Minor Championship, Monaghan were drawn to meet Donegal, but this proved to be a “bloodless” victory, as Donegal were unable to field a team for that quarter final clash at Ballybofey at the end of June, this despite the fact that they would have had “home” advantage.\n\nAlso in June, senior team manager, Michael Morgan, fielded an under strength senior team against Tyrone in a friendly game in preparation for his sides appearance in the All-Ireland semi-final stages later in the year. Monaghan won that one 6-10 to 4-12, but with several leading members absent, Morgan took the opportunity to try out some younger players and these included a few of the minor squad. The manager was obviously very happy with the result and was afterwards quoted as saying that the performance of two minors had prompted predictions of a call up to the senior side.\n\n“Ciara McGuinness showed she could live with the best of them as she very cleverly scored Monaghan’s fifth goal”, he said, “And Breda McGinn … without doubt one of the quickest forwards around, will make the breakthrough with sheer hard graft.\n\nCiara McGuinness and Louise McMahon were also two of the most prominent Monaghan players on the county junior team, which lost to Donegal in the Ulster Junior Championship, also at the end of June. Louise had scored 1-4 in that game which Monaghan lost by 1-8 to 2-13.\n\nSome of the younger members of the minor squad were also back boning the county U16 team and hammered Fermanagh in the U16 final at Roslea on 2nd July. These included Ciara Mulligan, Donna Mulligan, Ciara McGuinness (who scored 1-5 in that one), Catherine McCarville (who had 2-3 to her credit) Breda McGinn and Lorraine Freeman. These girls were obviously getting plenty of football, playing in so many different grades, and this would certainly stand to them in the Minor Championship.\n\nThe Minors next met Fermanagh in the Ulster Championship semi-final and had the following squad to pick from:\n\nMartina Grey, Kerry Quigley, Niamh Kindlon, Louise McMahon, Donna Mulligan, Una Rooney, Mary Croarkin, Edel Byrne, Isobel Kierans, Sharon Doogan, Emma O’Donoghue, Amanda Beggan, Catherine McCarville, Lisa Morgan, Patricia McCabe, Ciara McGuinness, Lorraine Freeman, Breda McGinn, Ciara Mulligan, Michelle Lavelle, Emma McGinnity, Taine King, Aine Gilsenan, Aoife McMahon, Orla McMahon, Rosie Hughes and Aisling Tierney.\n\nFermanagh were swept aside as the Monaghan girls triumphed by 4-15 to 1-1, after leading by 2-7 to 0-1 at the interval. Half backs Mary Croarkin, Catherine McCarville and Ciara Mulligan proved the rock on which every Fermanagh attack collapsed, while midfielder Una Rooney was also in superb form, and full forward Edel Byrne topped the scoring with 2-6 to her credit. The team had lined out as follows:\n\nEmma O’Donoghue, Sharon Doogan, Isobel Kierans, Lisa Morgan, Mary Croarkin, Catherine McCarville, Ciara Mulligan, Niamh Kindlon (0-2), Una Rooney (1-1), Ciara McGuinness (0-1), Louise McMahon (0-2), Emma McGinnity, Amanda Beggan, Edel Byrne (2-6), Breda McGinn. Subs used: Rosie Hughes, Orla McMahon (1-3), Donna Toal, Michelle Lavelle and Patricia McCabe.\n\nThey next met Tyrone in the Ulster final and this was played at Scotstown in the first week of August. The final score of Monaghan 4-8, Tyrone 1-13, gave Monaghan the minor title to add to the U16 title captured only the previous week. Looking a defeated side early on, Monaghan eventually came out on top with superb displays from Mary Croarkin, (who also scored the winning goal after taking a superb centre by Ciara McGuinness, Lisa Morgan, Isobel King, Niamh Kindlon, Una Rooney, Ciara McGuinness, Edel Byrne and Breda McGinn. Despite facing the stiff breeze in the opening half, Monaghan had drawn level by the interval, 3-0 to 1-9 and the team lined out as follows:-\n\nMartina Grey, Michelle Lavelle, Isobel Kierans, Lisa Morgan, Mary Croarkin (1-0), Catherine McCarville (1-0), Ciara Mulligan, Niamh Kindlon, Una Rooney, Ciara McGuinness (0-2), Louise McMahon, Breda McGinn, Orla McMahon (1-0), Edel Byrne (1-6) and Amanda Beggan. Subs used: Donna Mulligan, Rosie Hughes, Donna Toal and L. McMahon.\n\nThere were tremendous scenes of enthusiasm at the conclusion when the minor U18 championship trophy was presented to the Monaghan captain, Louise McMahon, by Philip O’Hare, the Ulster President who warmly congratulated the Monaghan cailini on their magnificent success and wished them the very best of luck in the All-Ireland series, but he knew that they would certainly not let Ulster down. How true those words turned out to be.\n\nIn the All-Ireland semi-final Monaghan were pitted against old rivals, Laois, the Leinster champions. Fixed for Mullingar on Saturday 22nd August, the Monaghan selectors had to select from an impressive panel:-\n\nMartina Grey, Michelle Lavelle, Isobel Kierans, Lisa Morgan, Mary Croarkin, Catherine McCarville, Ciara Mulligan, Niamh Kindlon, Una Rooney, Ciara McGuinness, Louise McMahon, Breda McGinn, Orla McMahon, Edel Byrne, Amanda Beggan, Emma O’Donoghue, Donna Mulligan, Rosie Hughes, Donna Toal, Lorraine Freeman, Sharon Doogan, Patricia McCabe, Emma McCague and Emma McGinnity.\n\nAs expected, Laois proved no pushover, and Monaghan were put to the pins of their proverbial collars to overcome the midlanders, but this they duly did and qualified for an All-Ireland spot against another of their old rivals of recent years, Mayo. This game was fixed for St. Mel’s Park in Longford on Saturday 12th September and would prove to be a red letter day in the history of Monaghan Ladies Gaelic Football.\n\nMonaghan followers flocked in their hundreds to this one, even though the weather at the time was most unfavourable, but hopes were high that, where the under 14s and under 16s had failed, this minor team would salvage Monaghan’s honour and bring a much deserved underage All-Ireland title to the county. They were not to be disappointed.\n\nStar of the show on this final occasion was, unquestionably, Edel Byrne of Magheracloone. Not only had she scored four points against Laois in the semi-final a couple of weeks earlier but she doubled that on this occasion, scoring 2-2 to see her county through to a well deserved All- Ireland title, both of her goals coming in the second half of a tremendous game.\n\nThe first half was extremely close but Monaghan still managed to end the half in front, if only by a minimum of margins 0-4 to 0-3. Mayo had opened the scoring but Louise McMahon equalised for Monaghan and then Ciara McGuinness put Monaghan in front for the first time. Mayo equalised again but Edel Byrne quickly put Monaghan back in the driving seat. Mary Croarkin set up Catherine McCarville for a nice point just before the interval.\n\nMonaghan fell behind at an early stage of the second period and were in arrears, 0-4 to 1-4, midway through this half, but they then turned on the style and Mayo’s last two goals came in the dying seconds when the title was already well and truly on its way to Monaghan.\n\nSelectors Michael Morgan and Paul Swift had spotted where the weaknesses were and made astute changes that swung the game very much in Monaghan’s favour.\n\nCiara Mulligan had a superb point, and then Una Rooney and Catherine McCarville combined magnificently to set Edel Byrne up for the first of her two goals. Now Monaghan were 1-5 to 1-4 in front and looking good. Rosie Hughes then came with three unanswered points in quick succession while Lorraine Freeman suddenly began to create all sorts of problems for the western defence.\n\nEdel Byrne, Ciara McGuinness and Isobel Kearns added three more Monaghan points and then, after Edel Byrne has scored her second goal, Mayo finally found the Monaghan net, but at that point it didn’t really matter. It finished Monaghan 2-11, Mayo 3-4 and the celebrations that followed had to be seen to be believed. Disappointment may have followed the U14s defeat by Meath in the semi-final and the U16s defeat by Waterford in the final, but this was Monaghan’s day and the minor title was safely in their keeping.\n\nThe history making team had lined out as follows:\n\nMartina Grey (Scotstown), Christine Reilly (Magheracloone), Isobel Kierans, (Inniskeen), Lisa Morgan (Scotstown), Mary Croarkin (Eire Og? Aghabog), Niamh Kindlon (Magheracloone), Una Rooney (Monaghan Harps), Ciara Mulligan (Aughnamullan), Edel Byrne (Magheracloone), Rosie Hughes (Doohamlet), Ciara McGuinness (Magheracloone), Breda McGinn (Emyvale), Orla McMahon (Aughnamullen), Lorraine Freeman (Magheracloone) and Louise McMahon (Sean McDermott’s).\n\nSubs used: Michelle Lavelle (Monaghan Harps), Catherine McCarville (Scotstown), and Donna Mulligan (Aughnamullen).\n\nOthers on that magnificent panel were: Amanda Beggan (Scotstown), Emma O’Donoghue (Aghabog), Patricia McCabe (Doohamlet), Emma McGinnity (Aughnamullen), Donna Mulligan (Aughnamullen), Donna Toal (Monaghan Harps), Sharon Doogan (Magheracloone), Emma McCague (Scotstown) and Frances Patton (Carrickmacross).\n\nAt the conclusion the Douglas Cup was presented to the captain of the winning team, Louise McMahon, by Mr. Noel Murray, President of the Ladies Association, amid Monaghan cheering that could have been heard in Ballybay.\n\nThe delight of the clubs of the county at the success of the minors was obvious from the many congratulations extended to them by the various PRO’s in their ‘club notes’ in a local newspaper of the following weekend. A sample of several congratulatory messages was the following:\n\nSean McDermott – Congratulations to our own Louise McMahon who captained the successful Monaghan Ladies Minor team last weekend. Well done Louise, a great honour for yourself and hopefully you will experience many more days like this.\n\nMonaghan Harps: Congratulations to the Co. Monaghan Ladies Minor team on defeating Mayo in the All-Ireland final.\n\nAghabog – Congratulations to Monaghan Ladies minor team who won the All-Ireland final last Saturday.\n\nInniskeen – Well done to Isobel Kierans who played fullback for the winning All-Ireland minor team on Saturday last. A great achievement, Isobel.\n\nScotstown – Congratulations to Martina Grey, Lisa Morgan, Amanda Beggan and Catherine McCarville, who were members of the victorious County Minor team in the All-Ireland final.\n\nWith such a success rate at the underage levels, especially minor, it was inevitable that several of the newly crowned All-Ireland champions would be drafted onto the senior team for their vital All-Ireland series. Michael Morgan has already tried out a few of the panel in the earlier challenge game with Tyrone but now a few more names were added to his list, and deservedly so.\n\nNiamh Kindlon played at left half back and Edel Byrne at centre half forward on the Monaghan senior team that defeated Meath by 0-13 to 1-8 in the All-Ireland senior semi-final at Summerhill, Co. Meath on Sunday 6th September, while Ciara McGuinness also came on as a sub in that game.\n\nIn fact, it was this Magheracloone trio that brought Monaghan back into the game, and who notched up the scores that eventually gave them their two points victory. Edel Byrne scored five points, fifteen years old Ciara McGuinness and Niamh Kindlon had a point each. Others of the minor squad who were on the substitutes bench that same day were Martina Grey (sub goal-keeper), Una Rooney, Ciara Mulligan, Breda McGinn, Mary Croarkin and Donna Mulligan.\n\nThe same squad formed part of the Monaghan panel that met Waterford in the 1998 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final at Croke Park on the first Sunday in October last and was the first Ladies Football All-Ireland Final to be televised live, but all about that in a separate article.\n\nSuffice it to say that these minors are in a class apart and have assured Monaghan followers that Ladies football is very much in the ascendancy in Co. Monaghan and that further honours must surely follow in the years ahead.\n\nMinors go out to Tyrone:\n\nIn the semi-final Monaghan had an easy 6-9 to 1-5 win over Derry at Clones in June, but once again it was Tyrone who proved to be Monaghan’s stumbling block in the Ulster Minor championship when the sides met at Carrickmore at the end of June. Lavina Connolly had Monaghan’s opening point and Orla Callen the second. Aisling Tierney followed with a great goal but Tyrone still led by 1-6 to 1-2 at the interval. Aisling had an early second half point for Monaghan and Cathy McManus had their second goal in a well contested second period, but Tyrone still finished the stronger on a score line of Tyrone 3-9, Monaghan 2-5.\n\nThe Monaghan team was: Emma O’Harte, Una McNally, Pamela Treanor, Maggie Deary, Donna Toal, Orla McKeown, Joanne Courtney, Rosie King, Cathy McManus, Lavina Connolly, Aisling Tierney, Lisa Kingham, Danielle McGorman, Orla Callen and Breda McGinn.\n\nSubs used: Christina Reilly, Paula Moyna, Therese McNally, Aoife McDonald.\n\nThis, unfortunately, ended Monaghan’s hopes of a provincial minor title in 2001.\n\nUnder 14s do Monaghan proud:\n\nMonaghan’s great achievement during 2001 was gained by the County’s Under 14 brigade who retained their Ulster title and went on to contest the All-Ireland final. In the opening round they disposed of Tyrone by 4-6 to 2-7 at Ballybay on Saturday 19th May, and followed this up with a decisive 7-11 to 2-7 win over Donegal in the semi-final played at Cremartin on Saturday 26th May. In the Ulster final at Tyholland on Saturday 2nd June they defeated Cavan 3-10 to 4-6 to retain their Ulster crown.\n\nIn the All-Ireland semi-final they had a great 5-7 to 3-5 win over Dublin at Drumbaragh, Co. Meath on Saturday 9th June to qualify for the final. Here, however, they were well beaten by Cork at Portlaoise on Saturday 23rd June.\n\nDespite defeat, this was a great year for the U14s and the team in the final was:\n\nAmy Duffy, Rona Newell, Lorraine Duffy, Sharon Courtney, Louise Cunningham, Yvonne Connell, Grainne McNally, Lisa Sherry, Niamh Kerr, Rachel McNally, Marie McNally, Aoife Hagan, Danica Tavey, Caroline McAree and Grainne Treanor.\n\nSubs used: Aine Mulligan, Grace Mullen, Eimear Mulligan, Linda Martin and Mairead McGeough.\n\nIt may have been a heartbreaking year for Monaghan who could surely have done with even a little smile from Dame Fortune, but with Juveniles of the calibre of the current U14 and U16 sides coming up, Monaghan’s hopes for the future are indeed bright. And having been the victims of misfortune in 2001, they show all the signs of again becoming supreme in Ulster in the year ahead.\n\nSENIOR LADIES AGAIN DO MONAGHAN PROUD\n\nDespite losing to old rivals Waterford in the All-Ireland Semi-final at Parnell Park in August, Monaghan Senior Ladies once again did their county proud in winning NFL, writes John Graham.\n\nThe failure to Waterford was never a pointer to the excellent form shown by the team throughout the year, and their winning of the national football league over the same opposition earlier in the year was a much more accurate indication of their real class.\n\nTheir was surprise at the beginning of the year when Michael Morgan was not chosen to take charge of the senior team, being replaced by Michael McKeown at the annual convention held in Ballybay on Sunday the 10th January. Assisted by Des Patton, Tony Keenan, Phoebe Carroll and Mary Callaghan, the new manager arranged a series of trial matches for the panel of the previous year and some new faces including Donna Mulligan, Ann Gavan, Mary Croarkin, Siobhan McFarland, Genevieve Campbell, Sharon Cunningham, Ann McKenna, Laura Murphy, Amanda Beggan, Fiona Kindlon, Christina O’Reilly, Kerry Quigley, Majella Woods, Aine Gilsenan, Maura Stokes, Emma McGinnity, Rosie Hughes, Donna Toal and Voreen Quigley.\n\nA challenge game for the fringe players was held against Tyrone at Kilmore in February an these showed up well despite defeat. Another challenge was played the following Sunday against Fermanagh and this time they won by 2-6 to 1-3 on a bitterly cold day. Eventually the county senior panel was named:\n\nAnn Gavan, Mary Croarkin, Donna Mulligan, Jennifer Greenan, Margaret Kierans, Cathriona Brady (Aghabog), Marie Stokes, Ciara Mulligan (Aughnamullen), Audrey O’Reilly, Orla O’Reilly, Angela Larkin (Carrickmacross), Sharon Cunningham (Clones), Majella Woods (Donaghmoyne), Rosie Hughes (Doohamlet), Breda McGinn (Emyvale), Voreen Quigley, Isobel Kierans (Inniskeen), Donna Toal, Brenda Swift, Eileen McElvaney, Anita O’Reilly, Brenda McAnespie, Jennifer Treanor, Una Rooney (Monaghan Harps), Edel Byrne, Niamh Kindlon, Ciara McGuinness (Magheracloone), Diane Dempsey (Rockcorry), Davina McCaffrey (Sean McDermott’s), Martina Grey (Scotstown).\n\nThe national league then resumed and Monaghan scored a decisive 6-15 to 2-6 win over Laois with this side: Ann Gavan, Isobel Kierans, Brenda McAnespie, Mary Croarkin, Marie Stokes, Eileen McElvaney, Niamh Kindlon, Jennifer Greenan (0-2), Edel Byrne (0-1), Donna Mulligan (0-1), Angela Larkin (1-3), Sharon Cunningham, Brenda Swift (1-3), Diane Dempsey (1-2), Margaret Kierans (2-2).\n\nSubs used: Ciara McGuinness (1-1), Orla Reilly, Davina McCaffrey, Rosie Hughes and Audrey O’Reilly.\n\nNext outing was against old rivals Waterford at O’Toole Park, Dublin but this time Monaghan were well beaten 3-14 to 1-9, the scores coming from Angela Larkin (1-4), Jennifer Greenan, Niamh Kindlon, Margaret Kierans and Brenda Swift (0-1) each. It was a mediocre performance by the Monaghan girls. An away game to Wexford was to follow the next Sunday but this failed to materialise when the team refused to travel and Wexford got a walkover. Manager Michael McKeown resigned the following week and Michael Morgan was brought back as senior team manager.\n\nClare were the next opponents at Mullingar on Sunday 11th April and Monaghan got back on the winning trail with a convincing 3-13 to 1-5 victory, under caretaker manager Declan Moen. Monaghan lined out as follows: Ann Gavan, Mary Croarkin, Anita O’Reilly, Audrey O’Reilly, Eileen McElvaney, Brenda McAnespie, Cathriona Brady, Jennifer Greenan, Donna Mulligan, Niamh Kindlon, Angela Larkin, Brenda Swift, Ciara McGuinness, Diane Dempsey and Margaret Kierans.\n\nSubs used: Voreen Quigley, Rosie Hughes, Maura Stokes and Jennifer Treanor. The scores came from Ciara McGuinness (2-2), Angela Larkin (0-6), Diane Dempsey (1-0), Jennifer Greenan (0-2), Margaret Kierans (0-2), and Niamh Kindlon (0-1). It was a superb performance by all involved.\n\nMichael Morgan again took over the following week and Monaghan met Meath at Aghabog on Sunday 18th April. An improved approach resulted in a heart warming 4-14 to 1-6 victory over the Meath girls. Angela Larkin (2-1), Diane Dempsey (1-4), Margaret Kierans (1-2), Jennifer Greenan (0-4) and Donna Mulligan (0-3) were the scorers with superb performances being turned in by Angela Larkin, Diane Dempsey, Catriona Brady, Jennie Greenan, Niamh Kindlon and Margaret Kierans.\n\nThe final game of the league series was against Longford at Gavan Duffy Park, Monaghan. The final score line of Monaghan 2-20 Longford 0-9, gave a clear indication of Monaghan’s superiority throughout the field. Two goals and a point from Diane Dempsey and seven points from Angela Larkin shattered the visiting Longford side, and the remaining scores came from Donna Mulligan (0-3), Margaret Kierans (0-3), Jennifer Greenan (0-2), Brenda Swift (0-2), Ciara McGuinness (0-1). It really was never a test for the Monaghan cailini who lined out as follows:\n\nAnn Gavan, Mary Croarkin, Anita O’Reilly, Audrey O’Reilly, Maura Stokes, Brenda McAnespie, Catriona Brady, Niamh Kindlon, Jennifer Greenan, Donna Mulligan, Angela Larkin, Jennifer Treanor, Margaret Kierans, Diane Dempsey and Ciara McGuinness.\n\nSubs used: Una Rooney, Martina Grey, Eileen McElvaney, Breda Swift and Orla O’Reilly. Monaghan had now finished second in the league table and were drawn against Meath in the league semi-final.\n\nThe inter-provincial series followed, and with Monaghan players back boning the northern lineout, the title came north. Diane Dempsey played a star role in the final in Monaghan, where Ulster beat Connacht by 2-15 to 2-10. Ulster had not lost a single match in the round-robin system of this series.\n\nThe semi-final with Meath took place at Summerhill, Co. Meath on Sunday 23rd May and proved a much tougher task than Monaghan had experienced in their provincial outing against the Meath girls. Eventually they overcame the stiff opposition and ended victorious by five points on score line of Monaghan 3-9 Meath 0-13. Anita O’Reilly was the star of the Monaghan defence and Diane Dempsey gave them a great goal very early in the game. At half time Monaghan led by 1-5 to 0-6 and they got a great to the second half with points from Angela Larkin and Donna Mulligan and a goal from Ciara McGuinness. Meath came back to narrow the gap but Monaghan survived.\n\nTeam: Martina Grey, Mary Croarkin, Anita O’Reilly, Una Rooney, Maura Stokes, Catriona Brady, Jennifer Treanor, Jennifer Greenan, Brenda McAnespie, Donna Mulligan (0-2), Angela Larkin (1-3), Margaret Kierans, Brenda Swift (0-1), Niamh Kindlon and Diane Dempsey (1-2).\n\nSubs used: Ciara McGuinness (1-0), Lorraine Freeman (0-1), Orla O’Reilly and Rosie Hughes.\n\nEverything was now set for a league final showdown with arch rivals Waterford, but there was disappointment when leading player Catriona Brady emigrated to America in June. A challenge game with Tyrone was played at Gavan Duffy Park on Sunday 13th June which Monaghan lost by 2-10 to 3-10. Several of the leading players were rested for this one, but Ciara McGuinness (1-1), Edel Byrne (0-3), Brenda Swift (0-2), Una Rooney (1-0), Margaret Kierans (0-2) and Diane Dempsey (0-2) showed that the old reliables were still very much to the fore.\n\nThe League Final\n\nEverything was now set for the final with Waterford and when it was announced that it would be played at Parnell Park in Dublin, arrangement began all over the county for transport to the capital on Sunday 27th June. The curtain raiser saw Tyrone convincingly overcome Dublin in the junior league final and the scene was set for an “Ulster Double” – hopefully.\n\nThe Monaghan side were mindful of the previous years championship final when they were piped at the post by Waterford and approached this game in a really determined frame of mind. Brenda McAnespie led the team onto the field and played a real captains part in the Monaghan defence, leading by example. The first half featured three tremendous goals by Monaghan and they led at the interval by 3-2 to 0-5. Martina Grey brought off some superb saves in the Monaghan goal and when Monaghan had a fourth goal in the second period, the title was on its way northwards.\n\nWaterford had started well, with a point, but Jennifer Greenan equalised. Waterford went ahead but then Monaghan struck after twelve minutes when Niamh Kindlon sent in a high ball which Donna Mulligan collected and parted to Diane Dempsey, who then passed to Angela Larkin the last named sending to the Waterford net.\n\nCiara McGuinness added the second goal minutes later, after taking a pass from Diane Dempsey. A Waterford point was followed by Monaghan’s third goal, Edel Byrne sending in a rasper which the goalkeeper had no chance of stopping. Monaghan now had their tails up and Diane Dempsey added another point before the interval.\n\nThe rain came on in the second half but failed to damp Monaghan’s enthusiasm, and further points came from Angela Larkin and Diane Dempsey. Waterford had points but then Monaghan had the best goal of the game when Edel Byrne soloed for forty yards and finished with a superb shot to the net … and the title was on its way to Monaghan with the score now at 4-4 to 0-5.\n\nWaterford proved they were not All-Irelan"
