        "text": "Shea the boston terrier was a fan of Arsenal and the New York Mets and the best friend anyone could ask for\n\nIt’s been almost three weeks since I was faced with the reality that my beloved companion Shea was dying and the only humane choice was to put her to sleep. It will forever be one of the most agonizing and painful experiences of my life. Shea had been battling cancer for about five months and had already gone through four rounds of chemotherapy. She seemed to be doing well and acted as if she hadn’t had any treatment at all. I had read all about the type of cancer that Shea had and how deadly it was, but I tried to look at the positive results which explained that dogs could live an additional 12-24 months after diagnosis. So, when I first got the news and fell apart, I decided to think positively and look at it as if Shea was LIVING with cancer rather than dying of cancer. Unfortunately, my deceptive positive thinking didn’t pan out.\n\nShea used to jump up on my bed and couch with no problem. In recent months, she needed help to get up on the bed. I would pick her up and lift her up to the bed. She was still able to jump onto the couch.\n\nI did start to see subtle changes, but tried to convince myself that they were nothing. She seemed to have trouble pooping, she didn’t like to go for walks anymore and she appeared to be much more lethargic. When she stopped taking some of the treats that she regularly loved, I had to accept the fact that something was wrong.\n\nMy wonderful neighbors would help me out with Shea when I was out of town or at work. I received a call on Tuesday, May 3rd late in the afternoon at work and was told that Shea had collapsed while out for a walk. In fact, a total stranger gave my neighbor and Shea a ride back to our building. I left work immediately to see what was going on. It was obvious that Shea had taken a turn for the worse. She got up to greet me, but collapsed along the way. It killed me to admit it, but I knew that we had to take Shea to the Emergency Department at the Animal Medical Center. One of the workers in my building, George, held her in his arms as we loaded Shea into my neighbor’s car for the short ride to AMC. Upon our arrival, an attendant at the hospital carried Shea inside and we went up to the Emergency Room on the second floor.\n\nI was a complete mess. I couldn’t stop crying and was pretty much in a state of shock. They took Shea into an examination room while myself and my neighbor Marcia waited in the waiting room. It was agonizing. Eventually, we were called in to a room where a doctor told us just how sick Shea was and that her cancer had spread to the point that there was nothing more that could be done for her. He was a very kind doctor, but told us that Shea was very sick and very tired. When I asked about putting her to sleep, he sadly told me that that would be the most humane thing to do. I couldn’t believe the reality that I was facing. Of course, I had to do what was best for Shea, but to say it sucked would be an understatement. I couldn’t and still can’t imagine what my life would be like without my best friend. I held her in my arms, gave her some kisses and they administered the drugs to peacefully put her to sleep. She literally died in my arms and I still can’t get that image out of my mind. It’s the worst thing that I have ever experienced in my life.\n\nI have been crying, numb and in denial ever since that moment. I feel guilty, sad, angry and many other emotions all mixed together. I seriously couldn’t and still can’t imagine a life without my Shea.\n\nMy apartment seems empty without her and everything here reminds me of her. I literally find myself unable to breathe at times. I just feel so alone and as if a part of me is missing.\n\nShea was truly my best friend. We did everything together. She constantly made me laugh and had a wonderful disposition. She was totally chilled out. She barely barked, she wouldn’t run away if off the leash and she loved to play. Of course, as she got older she spent more time on the benches at the dog park rather than playing with the other dogs, but she would mingle and enjoy checking out the scene.\n\nI had always wanted a dog as a kid, but my requests for a dog went unanswered and my love for animals had to take place in other people’s homes.\n\nMy first dog came to me by accident. Sorcha was a five-year-old Boston Terrier whose owners were moving to Ireland and couldn’t go with them due to quarantine rules. I said I would watch her and in the end, she never left. I had her for five more years and when she passed at the age of ten I experienced the pain of loss like I never had before. To say I was distraught at the loss of Sorcha would be an understatement. I truly thought that I would have to be hospitalized as my pain was so strong and I could barely function without crying.\n\nWhile not ideal timing, a friend of mine saw my grief and without me knowing it sought out a breeder for me that had puppies ready for adoption.\n\nTwo weeks after Sorcha had passed, on June 26th, 2011 my friend drove me up to Dutchess County and that’s where I met the best friend I’ve ever had in my life. All I can remember about this place is that there were dogs everywhere. Most of them were Frenchies and the place was a bit strange.\n\nArsenal just blew the chance to finish in a position that would have benefited the team greatly next season. I was bummed big time when they failed to achieve their goal. Normally I would brood over it and it would ruin my mood.\n\nOf course the Mets have failed me so many times over the years that their failures would feel like torture.\n\nLosing Shea has made me realize that the relationship I have with the teams that I follow is completely one sided. While I might profess to \"love\" my teams, Arsenal and the Mets are not reaching back to me with gifts and tokens of affection. While I root for Pete Alonso to hit home runs, he isn't worrying about my day to day. Likewise, my admiration for Arsenal runs deep. However, the Arsenal team is totally unaware of my everyday life and the problems with which I am faced. So while I support my teams and stick with them through thick and thin, I realize that love is a bit of a misguided word to express my connection to them. I am a fan; they offer me a diversion and enjoyment and perhaps a sense of belonging.\n\nShea’s loss makes these sports failures seem totally inconsequential and irrelevant. Shea was my best friend and greatest companion. She gave me the greatest gift anyone can ever receive, unconditional love. No matter what the day would bring or if I came home feeling as if the world had beaten me up, there was Shea rushing to greet me, kiss me, and jumping around with crazy excitement at my arrival. The love and companionship that I got from Shea were the greatest gifts I have ever received. Her passing has left me devastated, lost, and completely broken-hearted.\n\nI am having difficulty coming to grips with the loss of Shea. However, the memories that I have of the time that I spent with her and the unconditional love that she gave to me are comforting me at this time of sorrow.\n\nI will always remember you Shea and love you forever. I know that you are in doggy heaven cheering on Arsenal and the New York Mets and being the cool dog that you are.\n\nThis is not Russia’s first time invading Ukraine. Eight years ago Putin’s regime annexed Crimea. It appears now that Putin is going back in to try and finish what he started back in 2014.\n\nIt had an effect on Ukrainian soccer back then when Crimea-based football clubs PFC Sevastopol and FC Tavriya were cut from the Ukrainian Premier League.\n\nThis week Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy suspended play in the country’s domestic league.\n\nBack in 2012, Ukraine co-hosted the European Championships along with neighboring Poland. It was meant to herald a new era, not only for Ukrainian football but for the nation itself, as it prepared to join the European Union.\n\nA great example of how much Russia’s aggression in Ukraine has affected the game is the fate of the Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk. Due to Russia’s invasion of Crimea, the club has been displaced from its home base for eight years.\n\nIn 2014 the club was forced to move to Lviv which is 750 miles from the team’s hometown of Donetsk. They then moved their base to Kharkiv from 2017–2020. While closer to Donetsk, the club was still 187 miles from home. Since 2020, Shakhtar has played its home matches at the NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kyiv; 450 miles from Donetsk. Despite all the upheaval, Shaktar Donetsk has continued to be one of Ukraine’s most successful clubs.\n\nSince Russia’s new invasion of Ukraine, the world of football has been affected in many ways. Here are some of the events that have happened due to Putin’s aggression.\n\nFIFA and UEFA announced that the Russian national and club teams have been banned from all competitions “until further notice.” Russia had been scheduled to take part in World Cup qualifying playoffs in three weeks (FIFA and UEFA are both corrupt and probably did this because they had to. Keep in mind FIFA and Sep Blatter controversially awarded the 2018 World Cup to Russia. They should also be investigated for Qatar’s hosting of this year’s World Cup as the tiny gulf nation has been using modern slavery to build its stadiums.)\n\nSpartak Moscow was scheduled to meet Leipzig in a two-leg playoff beginning next week, but the Russian club has been disqualified and Leipzig will automatically advance to the quarterfinals.\n\nPoland, Sweden and the Czech Republic declared they would not play Russia, possibly forfeiting a World Cup berth since they’re all matched in the same four-team playoff pool with Russia.’\n\nPolish Bayern Munich player Robert Lewandowski put it best, “I can’t imagine playing a match with the Russian national team in a situation when armed aggression in Ukraine continues. Russian footballers and fans are not responsible for this, but we can’t pretend that nothing is happening.”\n\nThe soccer federations in the U.S., Ireland, England, and Wales announced they would not play Russia as long as it remains in Ukraine.\n\nGerman soccer club Schalke removed the logo of Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, from the front of its jersey while Manchester United canceled a sponsorship deal with Aeroflot, Russia’s state airline.\n\nMLS sides LAGalaxy and LAFC held a moment of silence for the people of Ukraine while displaying the country’s blue-and-yellow flag on the scoreboard before their season openers.\n\nIn Lisbon, Benfica player Roman Yaremchuk came on as a second-half sub and the crowd of 39,846 rose to its feet, some waving signs or Ukrainian flags."
