Talk of McGeeney, Gallagher and Malachy Rourke is madness, we’re a division 3 Tailteann Cup team,.\n\nWe're only there because of the current management!!! O connor had Kildare in division 1 when he left.\n\nWe are in the Tailteann because of the current management.\n\nIn his interview Ryan said the 3 in the county board didn't even ask him questions.\n\nNow that says it all.\n\nThe only way forward is outside to lift the whole thing and no penny pinching.\n\nSyl Merrins hopefully will be more visionary than some on here with different agenda.\n\nLosing to Laois in that manner back to back relegations.\n\nIt's a relief the hunt for a decent managment team starts today.\n\nThe only way is up.\n\nLast edited by Thelillywhites on Mon Jun 17, 2024 2:06 am; edited 1 time in total\n\nFionnMcCool wrote:\n\nI'm going to echo that unfortunately for Flanagan and Burke is that an outside appointment is the only only way to go here.\n\nThis may not be a popular suggestion.\n\nBut i honestly believe that Rory Gallagher is the man foe the job. Absolutely no nonsense disciplined approach is needed with no pre conceived ideas and any player in the county\n\nI'd rather Glenn for another 10 years than touch that excuse of a human..\n\nThe least Glen could have done is hang around till current chairman is gone so he'd have nothing to do with selecting the next management..\n\nIt wasn't being arrogant thinking we could beat Laois BUT I was fooling myself.\n\nThe wheels come off at the slightest bump in the road.\n\nFeely was targeted because he's the only one worth targeting.\n\nFarrell looked more like a seasoned player than lads playing years.\n\nBrian Byrne looked like he was trying to organise since he came in but it's a mess.\n\nKirwan has been honest in this competition but he went back to type of taking it into traffic today.\n\nLook at the lightness of so many players too.

Lads being stiff armed easily.\n\nWhoever comes in needs time but it needs locking down ASAP.\n\nThey need to watching club games.\n\nBrian Byrne could organise when playing Waterford or Longford. Out of his depth today and is miles off a county center back. Kirwan has actually gone backwards hopefully a new manager might give him a bit of confidence. There were at least 5 playing today who aren't within an arses roar of being county players. Clean out is needed\n\nThere’s been 5 / 6 / 7 goal hammerings to Dublin and Kerry that were less pathetic than what was on display today.\n\nHandpassing directly to the opposition and standing hands on hips watching as a forward runs in on goal, kicking the ball over the sideline when the person you were trying to pass to is standing 10 yards to the left and less than 20 yards from you in the first place, passing the ball along the ground directly to a Laois forward.\n\nThe bench today was never going to have a match winner or forward capable of kicking 3 or 4 scores sprung from it but it’s alright we’ll bring on a centre back who has spent the last 18 months marking space on to help get back into it.\n\nShane Farrell was limping for a good 2-3 minutes before a sub even started warming up to replace him. The biggest worry for him over the next few years is that he becomes the next Kevin Feeley, and we rely on him to drag us through the shit when nobody else can be bother their arse to try.\n\nThis management team could take over Dublin and make Leinster a competitive province again. No tactics, no kickout strategy, poor in game management and no improvements in individual players over 3 years.\n\nOur own senior intercounty side would struggle to make the last 4 of our own senior club championship.\n\nIf today is the last we see of Feeley in a Kildare jersey then it’s a sad way for him to go after some performances and big moments over the years.\n\nIf today is the last we see of about 7 or 8 others that played today then I’ll be a little bit more positive about things come January and the league next year.\n\nNew York will be left wondering “what if” as based on today they would have beaten us just as easily after running Laois close."
