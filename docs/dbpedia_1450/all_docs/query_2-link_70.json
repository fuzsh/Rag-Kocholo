        "text": "The Club was founded by the rector of Hamilton Academy, James Blacklock sometime in 1874, as yet, the actual date has not been established.\n\nThe first record of a football team in Hamilton was when Hamilton Thistle Cricket and Football Club was formed in 1862. It was to be another thirteen years before a football match was recorded, on 27th November 1875 when a Captains side met the Vice Captains selection. In 1897 a 13 man committee was elected. The Football Captain was G. Watson while R. Smellie was named as Secretary. The SFA Handbook for 1897-80 gives Robert Smellie, Ramage Buildings as Match Secretary of Hamilton Academicals.\n\nFootball was played in the town in 1869 by a team called Hamilton Gymnasium who met Queen’s Park on 29th May of that year in Hamilton, at the Recreation Grounds and lost 4-0. Seven months later the two sides met again in a return match and the Glasgow club were again successful, this time by 2-0. A year later they met on another two occasions with Queen’s Park again being the victors. The last mention found of the Gymnasium club was in April 1872.\n\nPrior to James Blacklock’s vision yet another club were playing in the burgh, Hamilton Football Club. Scottish Cup records show that Hamilton were drawn away against a club calling themselves, Rovers and the local side withdrew from the competition. This was in season 1874-75. The following season Hamilton again entered and this time received a home tie against Airdrie, not the current club, and they went on to the next round after winning 1-0. On November 13th 1875 they lost 3-0 away to Levern, probably a Glasgow eleven. The next year’s games saw both Hamilton FC and Hamilton Academicals participate, the former getting as far as the fourth round only to lose to Lancefield by 2-0.\n\nThere has been speculation the players and officials of Hamilton FC joined the new club sometime in 1874 as a few of the names under the old club reappear when the Academicals come on the scene.\n\nThe following information gives a picture of the history of the club as it has progressed through the past one hundred and twenty eight years, thus being one of Scotland’s oldest clubs. It should be noted that the club name was originally Hamilton Academical and as time wore on it changed to Academicals and therefore they were known as the Acas. In recent years the “s” has been dropped and also Acas has become Accies. Hence the reason for the differences in the text.\n\n12th December 1874\n\nThe first recorded game played by the club when a match was arranged against the Second XI of Hamilton FC. John Kerr scored the goal in a 2-1 defeat.\n\n16th January 1875.\n\nMatch played against 23rd Renfrewshire Rifle Volunteers at South Avenue.\n\n24th February 1875\n\nThe AGM of Hamilton Academical Cricket and Football Club was held.\n\nPresident; William J.

Accies were represented by R. Wilson; J. Torrance; K. Sage; C. Mackie; G. Smith; J. McLay; W. McGhie; A. Cassels; J. Lightbody and A. Ross. Therefore they were a man short.\n\n18th November 1875.\n\nThe first XI met Third Lanark at Cathkin Park while the Second XI had Third Lanark Reserves as their opponents at South Haugh with a 4pm kick-off.\n\n18th December1875.\n\nThe first XI met Thistle at home and won 6-0.
