        "text": "My guest in this episode is Mark Dempsey who comes to Music Talks via my dear friend Jesse Jackson at the great Podcast â€˜SetLustingBruceâ€™.\n\nLike all Springsteen fans Mark is passionate about Bruceâ€™s music but the joy of this episode is how much passion Mark has for all his song choices. If any of them are new to you Iâ€™m certain you will be seeking them out after having heard Mark talk about them and they are great choices:\n\n70â€™s - Three Steps To Heaven Showaddywaddy\n\n80â€™s - Dancing In The Dark Bruce Springsteen\n\n90â€™s - Polaroids Shawn Colvin\n\n00â€™s - Stuck Between Stations The Hold Steady\n\n10â€™s - The Ceiling The Wild Feathers\n\n20â€™s - No Mercy Nils Lofgren\n\nBristol born and bred Mark celebrated his 50th birthday at the end of 2023 and so doing Music Talks was a good opportunity to look back and reflect. He has lived most of his life in the South West of England but for five years between 2011 and 2016 he and his wife Catherine lived in Toronto.\n\nWith the same passion and enthusiasm he shows for music, Mark talks us through the delight of moving from â€˜sleepy Wiltshireâ€™ to the most multicultural and multiracial city in the world. As you would expect that experience also informs his song choice for the 2010's.\n\nIn 94 episodes of Music Talks there have been many great stories, but Markâ€™s closing story in â€˜Final Thoughtsâ€™ is one of my absolute favourites. Itâ€™s also where the title of the episode comes from but thatâ€™s all im going to say â€¦â€¦â€¦.\n\nEnjoy ðŸ˜Š"
