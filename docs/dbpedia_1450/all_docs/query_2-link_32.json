        "text": "Donald Duford '71 - Don was the typical athlete that St Joes athletics thrived on in the early days. He was a hardworking, three-sport athlete earning a combined 8 varsity letters competing in Football, Basketball and Track.

In addition to basketball, he played baseball in his first year, again moving into a starting role on the varsity team at First Base. As a sophomore, Dan played a pivotal role in the basketball team’s historical season. They brought home the first ever State Championship banner to St. Joes by winning the Class S State Championship Basketball Title. The historic victory came down to a foul shot with one second remaining on the clock and a tie score. Following a timeout, Dan calmly stepped to the foul line, completed his foul shot routine, and cleanly swished through the winning shot. As a junior in basketball, Dan earned first team All-State Honors, All MBIAC, and All Daily News Honors. The team went all the way to the Class S State Championship final only to fall short by 1 point. Despite his team’s loss, Dan was recognized as the game’s Most Valuable Player. Returning to the baseball diamond again as a junior first baseman, Dan played a key part of a very special team. The 1976 baseball team for St. Joe’s won the Class S State Championship. He had 32 hits that season, which tied the school record at that time. Senior year, Dan was named All-State, All MBIAC and All Daily News. He was the team Captain and the basketball team won another Class S State Championship. He and his brother combined for 36 total points in that final game.

Boyle Memorial Award winner and the John Gilbride Memorial Award winner. As a two-year starter at Quarterback, Bill held nearly all of the school’s passing records upon graduation. Against Bridgeport Central High School, Bill passed for 255 yards on 15 for 17 passing, that latter being a completion percentage of 88.2% which still stands as a school record. As the starting Quarterback, Bill led his team to a two-year record of 20-3. On the baseball diamond, Billy was a two-year starter at shortstop. He was an honorable mention All MBIAC selection as a junior. His senior year was cut short due to a broken wrist suffered in the fourth game of the season in an attempted base steal of home plate.

Billy had two hits in the inning with a broken wrist before leaving for the hospital.\n\nAlbert Tolomeo '86 - As a freshman, Al lettered in both baseball and basketball. By the middle of his freshman baseball season Coach McCarthy made Al the starting varsity catcher. Al was also in the rotation on the basketball court for Coach Vito Montelli. His sophomore year Al found himself as a key contributor on the basketball court. On the diamond, Al led the team in batting average and was selected first team All-MBIAC. Al’s junior year was one of great personal and team accomplishments. The baseball team, now under the leadership of Coach Jim Luchansky, won a Class M State Championship. He was selected to the first team All-MBIAC baseball team as well as being selected first team All-State. Al set many individual batting records that season, including batting average (.486).

In hockey, Patrick was a first line forward as a sophomore on St. Joseph’s first hockey state championship team when St. Joe’s defeated Staples/Weston, 3-2, in the 2009 Division III championship game. The following season, even though St. Joe’s moved up to Division II, Patrick led the program to its second consecutive state championship game. As a junior, Patrick was the leading goal scorer in the State of CT with 50 goals (to go along with 30 assists). Patrick was named First Team All-FCIAC; New Haven Register All State; CHSCA Division II First Team All State; and was selected to the Connecticut Post All Star Team. In 2010-2011, St. Joe’s again moved up a level and joined Division I. As a senior co-captain, Patrick led the team to its third consecutive state championship game. No other Connecticut high school team had ever moved up divisions in three consecutive seasons and made the state championship game each year. And no Connecticut high school team will likely ever do this again. Patrick was again named First Team All-FCIAC; New Haven Register All State Team; New Haven Register All Area Team; and the Connecticut Post All Star Team. He finished his St. Joe’s ice hockey career holding school records for goals in a game (6 goals), goals in a season (50), and points in a season (80), and was second in career points with 200. Patrick was equally dominant in lacrosse, leading the team to three consecutive state championship games. As a sophomore, Patrick was a key midfielder on St. Joseph’s first lacrosse state championship team which defeated Weston, 12-11, in the 2009 Class S championship game. In 2010, Patrick and the Cadets made it to the FCIAC semifinals for the first time after defeating an undefeated Staples team in the FCIAC quarterfinals. Patrick again led the team to the Class S championship game where they dropped a tight 7-6 heartbreaker to Weston. Patrick was named CHSCA Class S First Team All State and made the Connecticut Super Juniors Team. As a senior, Patrick avenged the prior year’s championship game loss by scoring four second half goals to lead an upset of Weston in the playoffs. This playoff win was the springboard to another run to the state championship game where St. Joe’s defeated Barlow High School (Redding/Easton), 6-5, for the school’s second lacrosse state championship. He again was named CHSCA Class S First Team All State. He was also named to the Connecticut Post All Star Team as well as All-FCIAC Honorable Mention. Finally, he was the recipient of the Western Connecticut Lacrosse Officials Association Scholar-Athlete of the Year Award.\n\n1990 Football Team - The memories for some of the players from the 1990 Football Team are crystal clear and for others it is a blur with pockets of, “oh yeah…I remember that.” What is clear in everyone’s memory is playing football wasn’t just something you did at St. Joseph, it was more like a rite of passage. The 1990 Football Team did its job to uphold the State Championship tradition that started a decade earlier. The seniors on this team won three straight State Championships. While most did not play varsity as freshman, their four-year career record was 36-5-2. The 1990 team was loaded with a balance of size on the line and speed in the backfield. In compiling a record of 10-1, the defense recorded five shutouts and only surrendered an average of 7.3 points per game. The team was ranked No. 1 in the State for most of the year until a hard-fought loss to a well-coached West Haven High School team on Thanksgiving Day. Despite this loss, the team still had its main goal intact of winning a State Championship. In the Class M State Championship game, SJ defeated a very spirited Middletown High School team, whom The Hogs dominated a few weeks earlier by a score of 42-13. The Championship game was much the same. In front of a crowd of 4,500, the Cadets controlled the game with a punishing running attack, amassing 238 yards rushing, while holding Middletown to only 99 total yards of offense. By scoring a touchdown in each quarter, the final score was 26-0, and the victory notched the football program’s third straight State Championship and its 8th State title overall. The 1990 Team finished ranked #2 in both the media and coaches voting poll. One of the things that Head Coach Christy Hayes preached all season was tradition. It was the job of the 1990 Football Team to keep up the tradition of “Hogs” football and continue what their predecessors had achieved, and this was taken to heart.\n\nATHLETES\n\nMr Walt Trojanowski '72\n\nMr Trojanowski may better be known as the very first football player in SJ history to be named First Team All-State.

The 21 wins is a school record (tied with the 2011 team), and the 5 losses were each by one run. The team’s pitching staff was arguably its strength.
