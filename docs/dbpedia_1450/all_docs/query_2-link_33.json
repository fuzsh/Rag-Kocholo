        "text": "I had the huge pleasure of seeing 1980s icons Soft Cell at Hampton Court Palace this week. And what a joy it was. Marc Almond in magnificent voice exuding energy and charisma in abundance, Dave Ball (performing in a wheelchair following his fractured vertebrae last year) in every sense the straight man. From classics like Torch, Bedsitter, Say Hello Wave Goodbye and of course Tainted Love to newer material like Nostalgia Machine and rousing encore Purple Zone, the band soon had its somewhat ageing fan base on their feet and singing along. I thought they were the best band around in the 1980s – and hindsight hasn’t changed my mind. They are retrospectively so underrated it’s a crime.\n\nWe all lionise the music of the era we grew up in. It relates automatically due to being the sound of our formative years; we heard it when it was new and fresh. But when I try to look back dispassionately on my teenage years, I think the early 1980s (up to 85) does stand the test of time. ,\n\nThe New Romantic/new wave/electronic scene in the UK spawned some truly great bands. The Human League and Duran Duran competed at the top of the charts, while the likes of Echo and the Bunnymen, Visage, Japan, OMD, Tears For Fears Heaven 17, The Teardrop Explodes, Yazoo and ABC were all churning out distinctive sounds. The Cure built on their late 70s emergence, Joy Division became New Order. David Bowie – the godfather of it all via Low and Scary Monsters – teamed up with Nile Rodgers to produce his most successful album yet. The Smiths emerged towards the end of the era, changing indie music forever. The late 80s feels less glorious, though a special mention for The The for producing the best albums of that period. But that early 80s period remains definitive – and Soft Cell were a huge part of it.\n\nEveryone remembers Soft Cell for their massive pop hit, Tainted Love – and those who were there remember even more fondly the extended version which segues into a relentless Where Did Our Love Go? But they were so much more than that one song.\n\nTheir debut album Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret is ground-breaking – it redefined what synth pop could be. I bought it on the strength of three magnificent singles – Tainted Love, Bedsitter and the devastating Say Hello Wave Goodbye (one of the truly great break up songs), but there was so much more to enjoy – Sex Dwarf, Secret Life, and Chips On My Shoulder among the best. The whole album evokes a sleazy underworld where pimps and perversions lurk around dark corners as a neon-lit nightlife unfolds. It’s dark but tongue in cheek; there’s a kitsch enthusiasm to the whole production (which was allegedly recorded on ecstasy). Soft Cell felt wonderfully transgressive and distinct: nobody else was like them. When non-album single Torch and a cover of the 1960s song What provided took them to five successive top 5 hits, they were also, briefly, a massive mainstream success.\n\nThere followed the mini-album Non-Stop Ecstatic Dancing – mainly remixes of earlier material, including their iconic (but unsuccessful) early dance-based single, Memorabilia, and the afore-mentioned Tainted Love/Where Did Our Love Go hybrid along with the What cover. It kept them firmly in the public eye ahead of their second full album.\n\nThe Art of Falling Apart is smoother and less danceable while exploring similar themes; Almond said at the time he was fascinated by “filth” and his lyrics continued to explore the seediness beneath the surface of shiny bars and nightclubs, while also painting pictures of the mundanity of suburban life: tensions with parents in Where The Heart Is and the dullness of a routine, meaningless existence in Forever The Same (a theme previously explored in debut album opener Frustration). The gorgeous Loving You Hating Me was somehow never a single; it may have reversed a trend whereby the band’s chart success never again hit the dizzy heights of those first five singles.\n\nTheir third album This Last Night In Sodom was something of a departure: the themes remained similar but the music was more experimental. It was wrongly seen at the time as one for the diehards: the reality is that it’s as underrated as the band are. Down In The Subway is a great cover; Soul Inside, Little Rough Rhinestone and L’Esqualita (which foreshadows the Spanish/Latin influences on some of Almond’s solo material) are all magnificent; album closer Where Was Your Heart (When You Needed It Most) is a great sign off for a band who had already announced they would be parting after this recording. It is even darker, more raucous and possibly slightly less cohesive than the first two albums, but it felt like a very fitting end to the Soft Cell story arc.\n\nExcept the story wasn’t over. After the pair went their separate ways and pursued different projects – Almond has had a successful solo career including a number one hit with Gene Pitney – they suddenly reunited for a fourth studio album in 2002. Cruelty Without Beauty was largely unheralded but very good, notably the cover of Frankie Valli’s The Night and new songs like Monoculture, Last Chance and the magnificent Darker Times. The songs are definitively and unmistakeably Soft Cell, but with all the advantages of 21st century production.\n\nAnother long hiatus followed, then last year Happiness Not Included appeared: it’s not just a great Soft Cell album, it was honestly as good as anything that anyone did in 2022. Purple Zone, their collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys, saw them back in the singles charts, and the album generally has so much to recommend it: Bruises On All My Illusions, Happy Happy Happy and New Eden among the standouts. Some of the themes are similar, others are new, reflecting on ageing, the disappointments of technology and unfulfilled dreams. The album’s a triumph: Soft Cell didn’t need it to confirm their status as my favourite 80s band, but it was great that they could also be my favourite band of 2022.\n\nSoft Cell’s influence on electronic music was huge: they brought fun and debauchery to the mix in a way others had not thought of. Bands as diverse as Nine Inch Nails and the Pet Shop Boys cite them as a major influence: indeed, as good as they are, it’s sometimes tempting to see the Pet Shop Boys as a sanitised, poppy stab at being Soft Cell.\n\nThe band have hardly been prolific as a duo: they produced three albums and a mini-album and then disappeared until 2002, then again until 2022. But they were consistently brilliant, ground breaking and distinct: Almond’s voice and lyrics over the backdrop of Ball’s synthesisers sounds as great in 2023 as it did in the early 80s. There were lots of great electronic bands around then; for me Soft Cell top them all.\n\n“Hello. I’m Zig from the planet Zog. I’ve been set on a scouting mission to understand your planet and how it works. I’ve basically been hiding in plain sight, you probably walk past me every day. One of the first things I noticed about humans is that they don’t notice much. Especially not the most obvious things.”\n\n“Hi Zig. Welcome. I’m not sure how much you’ll learn in the United Kingdom of 2023, but hey ho.”\n\n“You’d be surprised. And anyway, there’s a Zig equivalent in every country in your world. All of us just quietly observing your customs and ways,”\n\n“All part of an invasion plot I guess?”\n\n“FFS, I’m not an extra from an HG Wells novel! Why do you humans always assume that the first plan of any alien civilisation is to make war with you?”\n\n“Um, dunno. I guess because that’s what we always do with each other?”\n\n“We noticed that. Be better, humans!.”\n\n“So what’s so interesting to you about Britain in May 2023?”\n\n“The flags?”\n\n“Flags? Oh yes, we have the coronation coming up.”\n\n“What’s a coronation?”\n\n“The crowning of our new king. King Charles III.”\n\n“Crowning?”\n\n“Yes. It’s like a ceremony where we put a hat made of gold and jewels on his head to pronounce him our king.”\n\n“I see. And what is a king? Is he like in charge?”\n\n“Sort of. I mean, technically he is the head of state. But the Prime Minister is in charge of the government.”\n\n“Sounds complicated. “\n\n“Not really. The Prime Minister is elected by the population, along with lots of other people. We call them Members of Parliament, MPs for short. The Prime Minister is the MP who can command a majority of votes in the House of Commons, where we make our laws.”\n\n“Yes, that sounds similar to Zog. We elect wise people to make the rules and if they let us down, we vote them out.”\n\n“That is similar, apart from the ‘wise’ bit maybe…”\n\n“So this king is then voted in by your House of Commons? Not by your people, but by their elected representatives?”\n\n“Um, no. He’s not elected at all. He is the King because his late mother was the Queen.”\n\n“Queen?”\n\n“Queen is just the female version of king.”\n\n“So she was elected and he – inherits her job?”\n\n“No, no, no. The King or Queen has never been elected.”\n\n“So how are they the head of state if nobody voted for them?”\n\n“Well, it’s about tradition, you see. It all goes back centuries.”\n\n“It’s a tradition for one family to be in charge?”\n\n“Well, like I say, not really in charge, it’s more sort of ceremonial.”\n\n“When did this ceremonial tradition start?”\n\n“Oh, centuries ago. There were wars and all sorts for the right to be king or queen. It even changed hands between different families a few times.”\n\n“So the people who won the wars became the kings and queens?”\n\n“Yes, though it was all years ago.”\n\n“So let me get this – they are in charge because their ancestors – killed yours?”\n\n“Well, it was all a long time ago. And you keep saying they’re in charge, when they’re not really…”\n\n“I’m sure you can’t blame them for their ancestors’ behaviour, but it’s curious you allow them to be in charge on that basis?”\n\n“As I keep saying, they’re not in charge!”\n\n“Touchy. So this Prime Minister is in charge? He has no crown or coronation, but he makes the laws?”\n\n“Not on his own. Members of Parliament have to vote for them.”\n\n“Like on Zog. So he is like a president?”\n\n“No, no. A president is a head of state. Like our king, but voted in by the people. The Prime Minister is technically His Majesty’s Prime Minister.”\n\n“His what?”\n\n“His majesty. That’s what we call our king. Or if we are speaking to him, we call him ‘Your Majesty’ or ‘Your Highness'”\n\n“Hahahaha, you humans and your sense of humour! You’ve been winding me up!”\n\n“Erm, no?? That’s what we call him!”\n\n“Come now, Human! I have seen your Monty Python, your satirical surrealism. It’s old hat even to me in 2023! Your highness! His majesty! Hahahahaha!”\n\n“Look, it’s just a tradition, ok?!”\n\n“You’re serious? You call a man “Your Highness” because his ancestors won a fight against yours centuries ago?”\n\n“When you put it like that, I can see it sounds strange, but it’s just a tradition, you know?”\n\n“I am confused by this tradition. It seems very odd and not in your interests.”\n\n“It’s something to celebrate. There’ll be a load of parties celebrating the coronation.”\n\n“You hold parties to celebrate this man having an ostentatious hat put on his head?”\n\n“We’re celebrating centuries of tradition and our new king! If you don’t like it, go back to Zog!”\n\n“Centuries of tradition? We’re back at his ancestors killing people so they could be in charge, aren’t we?”\n\n“Look, that was all ages ago. And the monarchy – our system of government – and all the pageantry that surrounds it – is just part of being British.”\n\n“Pageantry? Is that all the flags and stuff?”\n\n“Much more than that. This will be a massive event with thousands of people involved; it will be spectacular, colourful and utterly glorious. Long live the king!”\n\n“So this must be quite expensive?”\n\n“About a hundred million quid. But worth it.”\n\n“A hundred million sounds a lot. Is this king able to afford that much?”\n\n“Oh, he isn’t paying for it! Haha! As if!”\n\n“So who pays?”\n\n“Well, the government. The taxpayer. In effect, all of us.”\n\n“I see. That is curious. You have people with nowhere to live. Your essential workers are refusing to do their jobs because your government says they cannot afford to pay them enough to afford the cost of living. You have working people going to your British food banks because they are unable to feed their families. You are short of people to make the sick well and people to make sure your people are safe. All of these things, you are told you cannot afford. But you will pay £100 million to watch a man have a hat put on his head, while calling him “Your Majesty” or “Your Highness” or whatever, because his family won some wars hundreds of years ago?”\n\n“Like I say, if you don’t like it, go back to Zog!”\n\n“Yes, I think I will.”\n\n“Long live the king!”\n\n“If every new one costs your people a hundred million pounds, then let’s hope so.”\n\nThere’s not many footballers I love more than Jordan Henderson. I’ve just finished reading his autobiography and it cemented my admiration for him as a player and a person. As the book almost recognises, he seems destined to be one of those football players who never quite gets the credit he deserves from the football public. But those who have watched him lead a fantastic Liverpool side over the last few years – and seen his vast contribution to their success – know better.\n\nHenderson isn’t a glamorous player. The average fan tends to value the silky skills of a Messi, a Saka or a Salah more than the attributes Jordan Henderson offers. And I’m not for a minute saying he’s better than any of those three. But nor is it as simple as ‘Hendo’ being the player you want to lead a team, lead its pressing and work tirelessly for the cause; leaving the silkier moments to his colleagues. Henderson is a fine passer of the ball, often first time, he can put in great deliveries and he’s scored a few spectacular goals. All of this gets lost because not only is he surrounded by players who are easier on the eye, but also his main job as part of a Jurgen Klopp midfield is to bring energy and drive to the play.\n\nThere was one game in the World Cup, I think against Wales, where Henderson had one of his rare stinkers; he gave the ball away a lot and his touch seemed non-existent. Of course this was quickly compiled into the reverse of a YouTube highlights reel by one of those observers who fails to see his merits. He went on to have a great tournament, combining brilliantly with Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham in what is still England’s best midfield three. But in this game, having been out of action for a while and playing in a team whose style is often the antithesis of Klopp’s Liverpool, he misfired, as every player occasionally does.\n\nThe thing is, when Henderson misfires, there are always going to be plenty detractors ready to make the make the most of it. Most ‘neutrals’ tend not to admire the boring but important players – have a look at the unbalanced world elevens most people pick. With Henderson, there is also the fact that when he plays badly, Liverpool tend to as well – and for that first half against Wales, England were also pretty poor. His style – often about being first to the ball and playing it quickly – lends itself particularly badly to an off day. The old trope about backwards passing will usually be brought up too – but his job at Liverpool is to recycle possession and move the ball quickly, as well as leading the press. He can play defence-splitting passes with the best of them, but often he gets the ball in a position where that option is not available. Playing in midfield for Jurgen Klopp is not a glamorous task, but it’s crucial to how the team operates.\n\nWhile Henderson struggled a little in his early years at Liverpool, he was integral to the near miss Premier League title bid in 2014: his red card against Man City with three games left was cited by many as the reason Liverpool didn’t prevail. This is not so far-fetched when you consider how that title was lost: Henderson was largely Gerrard’s legs in his predecessor’s last days, and it’s by no means certain events at Chelsea and against Crystal Palace would have panned out the same way had he been on the pitch. Since then, he has established himself as the captain in succession to Steven Gerrard and led the club to a period of success that was not widely foreseen when he joined them.\n\nHenderson is technically way better than he gets the credit for. He can do everything that is required of a midfielder: he can pass and tackle, win aerial challenges, go past people and he’ll run forever. He can play as a defensive midfielder, but is actually better in the role he played at the World Cup, breaking forward, leading the press and getting into attacking positions where he can provide a threat. His leadership really came to the fore in that strange Covid period of empty grounds; it became clear that he talked and led his team mates through every 90 minutes. Klopp and others have also praised his influence off the pitch: in Liverpool’s most successful period for decades, his captaincy has been crucial.\n\nSpeaking of off the pitch, his values are also exemplary: he led the #playerstogether fundraising efforts to support the wellbeing of health workers during the pandemic, he has spoken out against racism and homophobia and he recently led the move by Premier League captains and players to support Gary Lineker when he was suspended by the BBC. Like Marcus Rashford and many other modern footballers, Henderson takes a real interest in issues of social justice and fairness. It is easy to say that he does so from a position of privilege – equally easy to counter that he has no need whatsoever to get involved in any of it, but chooses to do so of his own volition.\n\nReading his book, you get the impression his whole career has been a fight against the odds, against the critics who said he’d never become what he has. From Alex Ferguson criticising his running style to Brendan Rodgers trying to swap him for the mediocre Clint Dempsey – via a whole load of snide social media posts, some from people purporting to be Liverpool fans – it’s been a challenge to prove people wrong. He’s done it in style: he was Footballer of the Year the season Liverpool ended their 30-year title drought and he has won every club trophy he has competed for over the last few years.\n\nHenderson himself says with typical modesty that Liverpool would have won all of those trophies without him. I actually doubt that. Not only has he been a key player, his leadership and will to win have been critical components of the whole thing. Van Dijk, Salah, Alisson and Mane may have made more spectacular impacts, but Liverpool’s record has consistently been better with Henderson in the team than without him. Damien Comolli, who helped sign him for the club, does not think they would have won what they have without him. https://www.sportbible.com/football/liverpool-would-not-have-won-premier-league-without-jordan-henderson-20220306\n\nLike Jamie Carragher before him, Henderson is one of those players who has maximised his talents to such a degree that he made himself indispensable to a side packed with more generational players. It might well be that at 32, and with a playing style based on boundless energy, his days as an automatic starter are at an end – and we can already see the challenges that is presenting to a Liverpool team suddenly lacking that ‘heavy metal’ identity. There will be a rebuild and Henderson’s future role may be more of a bit part one like that now played by James Milner. But what nobody should doubt is his vast contribution over the last decade – or how difficult he will be to replace.\n\nHistorically, Oasis are underrated. I can hear the music snobs and try-hards laugh aloud at that. I accept many of the criticisms of the Oasis as a band: they were derivative, increasingly samey and over-hyped. But that doesn’t mean they weren’t brilliant.\n\nThere was a period around 1995/6 when it seemed there was a consensus: everyone loved Oasis, they’d triumphed conclusively in the battle of Britpop with Blur, they were very briefly part of the zeitgeist. The Gallagher brothers had a star quality that had been missing in British pop music for ages: Liam had an amazing voice and presence, Noel wrote songs that everyone wanted to sing. The consensus started to fracture with the launch of Be Here Now, maybe the most hyped album release ever and really fell apart with 90s lad culture as Britain became a slightly different place following the death of Diana and the hegemony of New Labour. But for that time – and for their first two albums in particular – Oasis rode a wave of popular admiration that only a few seemed to dissent from.\n\nSo where did it all go wrong? Well, I’m not entirely sure it did. They continued to churn out good albums – five more of them, all with good songs on, though not with the pomp and consistency of Definitely Maybe or (What’s The Story?) Morning Glory? But it wasn’t trendy to like Oasis after about 1997; look at any article relating to the Gallaghers on the more painfully cool music sites – from Pitchfork to The Guardian’s music section – and the snide dismissals come rolling in. It is as if some people feel they were tricked for a while in the 90s, but they have maybe forgotten just how explosive Oasis were when they first arrived on the scene.\n\nDefinitely Maybe is a near perfect debut – it has a case for being the greatest of all debut albums. There was certainly hype around it, but it absolutely roared along, from Rock n Roll Star to Live Forever to Supersonic, Cigarattes and Alcohol and Slide Away. One storming, life affirming anthem after another. Songs that sounded like they’d always been there, or should be – cue jokes about that being because they were largely stolen. But here’s one reason the lazy ‘bootleg Beatles’ narrative just doesn’t stack up: Noel Gallagher stole from many more than the Fab Four. A riff here, a snatch of melody there – bits of glam rock, bits of The Smiths, Stone Roses and The Jam (and later The Velvet Underground, The Stones and The Kinks). Oasis made an absolute triumph of being magpies: their songs sounded like older songs but with new twists. The production was blinding: everything felt turned up to 10: and the attitude, the old school rock n roll swagger with a dash of 90s irony, just carried the whole thing along. with aplomb.\n\nMorning Glory was equally good; and a progession whatever people say, –Definitely Maybe never really promised songs like Wonderwall, Don’t Look Back In Anger or Champagne Supernova. At this point, even the B-sides are stonking– Round Are Way, The Masterplan and their riotous Slade cover Cum On Feel The Noise all became Oasis classics. The legendary Knebworth gig followed as Oasis cemented their place as the biggest band in the UK for years – and one of the biggest in the world.\n\nThe backlash started not long after – we have a weird British tradition of building things up to knock them down. Later albums didn’t have the glorious pomp and assurance of the first two, but they all had stand out songs – and the band remained a magnificent live act. It doesn’t matter anyway. Those first two were the albums that defined the band and the era – and there’s not a lot that retrospective whining can do to change that.\n\n“The lyrics were shit” is the other moan – it might be true that there was an overuse of ‘shine’ and ‘star’ and ‘better day’ as the years went on, but the early stuff has some great words – Round Are Way, Supersonic, Live Forever for example. And as over-played as it is, that line “I don’t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now” has a gorgeousness and wistfulness that we now probably look past. Noel isn’t a great lyricist, but he is often a good one – and a wonderful tunesmith. Liam’s lyrics… well, they got a bit better after Little James\n\nIt’s when you hear teenagers at Glastonbury – or indeed, my living room – singing along to Noel’s Oasis hits with gusto, that you realise the new generation has little truck with the naysayers. Oasis songs defined a generation and even in an era where people no longer hear the same music as each other, they’ve crossed over into being pretty universally familiar.\n\nI can accept that there was hype, there was minimal innovation, there was plenty of cheeky theft. I could at one stage have accepted the ‘overrated’ tag – Oasis certainly weren’t Bowie or the Beatles (but who is, apart from Bowie or The Beatles!) But the kids loving Oasis are the backlash to the backlash. The sneering, the sometimes transparent classism and the determination to dismiss the entire catalogue of a band who dominated an era in the way few have, ends up doubling back on itself: Oasis in some quarters, incredibly, are now under rated.\n\nI know this blog will annoy some friends and I’m sure it will undermine any aspirations to being seen as a cool and discerning music fan, so it’s good that I don’t have any. My tastes are wide and eclectic, but will always have space for stomping, swaying anthems you can sing when you’re drunk; for bands with attitude and presence and for melodies that stay with you until they are passed on to your kids. Like it or not, Oasis will live forever.\n\nWhen I was young, I was convinced that in later life, I’d live in Liverpool and have a season ticket for Anfield. As a boy, my Dad would take me to games, but money being tight, it was nowhere near as often as I wanted to go. When I’m grown up, I told myself again and again, getting a season ticket will be my ultimate goal. In some ways, maybe it still is a goal. But in the last few years, my pilgrimages to Anfield have been ever less frequent, I have a Sky and BT subscription and listen to the dwindling number of non-televised Liverpool games on the club website. I care as much as I ever did about the team’s results. But I am, in pretty much every sense, now an armchair football fan.\n\nBeing not just an armchair fan but a Liverpool football fan who was not born in the city invites inevitable criticism. For one thing, I’m by no means alone. Liverpool’s global fanbase is huge and its UK ‘supporters’ can be found in every town and city – a good number of those rarely if ever ‘go the game’. (Part of that is because it’s bloody hard to get tickets for a ground that sells out out all the time, but still.) The ‘glory hunter’ jibes are never far away. Why does someone like me, born in West Yorkshire, support Liverpool FC anyway?\n\nThere is at least a simple answer to that. I support Liverpool because my Dad did. He was Irish, had spent time in the city and had a lot of time for Liverpudlians and LFC as a club. Many Irish people have a strong affection for Liverpool or Manchester United. While he was more of a rugby fan, hmy Dad strongly encouraged me to support Liverpool – even if he then spent every game playing “devil’s advocate” against them to annoy me (he was like that). We had some great days out at Anfield and everything about it felt special to me as a boy.\n\nI had no idea when I first supported Liverpool – cheering them to defeat on my Gran’s telly in the 1971 FA Cup Final – that they were about to embark on an era of unprecedented success. There is no question that such success attracts new fans, but I definitively wasn’t one of them. I knew nothing at all about football when I inherited Liverpool as my team. Some might say that is still the case, but those visits to Anfield fed an obsession that I have never been able to shake. It became part of my identity from a young age and I sometimes wish I didn’t care so much about a silly game now played by a team of millionaires from all over the world. There is little point in calling me out on it: for me, it just is.\n\nWhy didn’t I support my local team? I did, sometimes – but watching Halifax at The Shay was a radically different experience. I found myself not caring that much about the result – which was usually a defeat – and distracted by what might be going on at Anfield. In some eyes, that might make me even more of a glory hunter: looking to the glamour (well, sort of) of what was then the First Division, rather than mustering enthusiasm for the local club. But what you feel is what you feel.\n\nWhen I went to Anfield, to quote Roy Evans, I loved the bones of the place. I loved the green of the pitch, the jokes on the Kop, the camaraderie of the whole experience. We had to travel through Manchester to get there, which led to some unpleasant exchanges on occasion, but for whatever reason, Anfield felt like part of me from my very first visit. I liked the whole ethos of the club – the socialism of Bill Shankly that became a playing style and a whole philosophy. That may feel long gone in an era when corrupt states are buying Premier League clubs, but it’s not entirely.\n\nIf Liverpool is sold to such an enterprise, there are plenty fans who will walk away – shiny new players aren’t the most important thing in the world to many of us. In fact, social media increasingly plays out this conflict to people who go to games regularly and those who watch on TV, with the latter far more relaxed about a potentially dubious takeover if it means a huge transfer budget. The fan group Spirit of Shankly calling on the Premier League to act to stop unsuitable takeovers has infuriated some Twitter fans with weird dreams of a human right abusing state at the helm – but most of them have never been to Anfield.\n\nSo here am I, a semi if not entirely retired attendee, lecturing fellow armchair fans on the future of Liverpool FC. But as with the World Cup, we need to recognise that football is just a game; human lives matter way more then who wins the league. My sense is that most Anfield regulars – having been through tragedies and injustices of their own – still do.\n\nSo look, I totally understand criticism of armchair fans. I’d much rather go to games than watch on telly. But it is easy to overlook how a football team can become part of your identity from a very young age – I’d venture to suggest that might even be true of people who have never been to a live match (though I think they are severely missing out – and my own experience of going was what really stuck with me). The bottom line is that I don’t care what other people think, the fortunes of a football club several miles away from where I now live continue to matter hugely and deeply to me. It’s not something I can turn off, though I often wish it was.\n\nWatching on TV is a different experience. You get replays of almost every moment, you get sometimes inane hype and hysteria from pundits and you get weird cut-aways to Jurgen Klopp or someone in the crowd so you don’t know what is happening on the pitch. You get often lazy comments from people who don’t watch your team every week. In the modern era, you get VAR – you can make up your own mind while Peter Walton agrees with the referee. VAR really belongs in a box with the proposed European Super League, expanded World Cups and Champions Leagues and £100 million transfer fees as an encapsulation of what modern football has become: a TV spectacle, funded through broadcasters for armchair viewers. Fans who actually go to the game are treated appallingly, whether it’s ludicrous kick off times, long waits for VAR decisions they have no clue about or World Cups hosted by people who won’t welcome many of their number.\n\nFootball is a remarkable and brilliant game: it’s little surprise it has such a huge place in the culture of nearly every country. But since the 1990s, that has been monetised in a way that has seen the ‘real’ fans who go to matches sacrificed for global TV viewers. Huge revenues have led to huge salaries and moved those playing the game further and further from those paying to watch. Yes, I can pay a monthly subscription and watch probably 80% of Liverpool games from my armchair – and yes, given Anfield is pretty much always over-subscribed and millions actually want to watch the match, this makes commercial sense. But it should never have come at such cost to those who follow their teams home and away; supporters are way more than a backdrop for a TV extravaganza.\n\nSo I’m in many ways a reluctant armchair fan, and about to join the waiting list again for a season ticket at Anfield (I gave up last time, but the stadium is being extended) – but an armchair fan I am. I do think people who actually go to games should have more of a say in how their club is run than I should. I do sympathise with some of the tropes about glory hunters – though the ‘support your local team’ one is a tad tiresome: at the end of the day, people will like what they like. Global fanbases pour money in to big clubs, for good or ill, and care about the results – and many of them will rarely if ever have the opportunity to go to live games. Nobody can stop them caring, or having opinions or declaring themselves a fan of something that is far removed from their daily lives.\n\nMaybe that’s the difference – I was once a supporter, I’m now a fan. But no-one, least of all me, can stop the damn club mattering hugely to me – or longing to be there every time I tune in on TV.\n\nIn the midst of the World Cup, with a daily diet of football and football chat, it probably sucks to not like the game. I can understand, indeed empathise with, people in that position. I don’t watch Strictly or Game of Thrones and I never got into Line of Duty, though I may well well have liked it if I had. When everyone else on social media or at work or at family gatherings is talking at length about something that is of no interest to you, it can be a bit excluding, even bewildering.\n\nBut here’s the thing: why do people who don’t like football in particular feel compelled to announce it to the world? I don’t spend my time complaining when people talk about or get excited by any of the above. I could name a hundred things that are popular that hold no interest for me – and I could probably explain why if you asked me. But I don’t feel the need to go around moaning about every conversation I’m (by choice) not part of.\n\nThe anti-football crew are odd. They’re odd in my eyes partly because they don’t like football, but that’s subjective. It’s their desire to broadcast their dislike at every opportunity that confounds me.\n\nIt comes in a number of forms. There’s the straight up, honest ‘bloody football!’ moans reflecting resentment at the game’s ubiquity in the news and in the national psyche – which may indeed be overblown, but does reflect something that seems to matter to an awful lot of people. There’s the ‘overpaid millionaires’ and ‘injury fakers’ whinges, which some football fans might also sympathise with – though if an activity generates millions because it is so popular (like, say, pop music), it is probably better that the cash ends up in the hands of the people with the talent rather than the often dubious people who run it. There’s the tired ‘oh, is there a kick-ball game on?’ quips, which reflect a remarkable banality for people trying to imply they operate on a higher plane. Then there’s the anti-England jibes – either from people who object to nationalism/jingoism or, perhaps more commonly, from those who just don’t want the national team to succeed because those who like the game and support England might be happy.\n\nAll those people who never watch football yet feel qualified to pontificate on how rubbish their national team is! In fairness, they’re not Brazil, Germany or Italy in terms of titles won, but few teams are. England are one of only a handful of nations to ever taste international success and they more often than not make the latter stages of tournaments – in their last two, they were finalists and semi-finalists. The chances of actually winning a World Cup are slim, but having a team that is at least among the contenders should be seen as a good thing. Terry Venables once said people tend to think England are the best team in the world or the worst, when in fact they are neither. But for the haters, the idea of them being over-hyped, overpaid and utterly useless is presumably a great stick to try to beat the national game – and those who like it – with.\n\nIn recent years, this has been exemplified by what seems a wilful misunderstanding of the clever Three Lions tune – which has become as ubiquitous during international tournaments as Slade at Christmas. As David Baddiel, who co-wrote and sang it, has explained a million times, it’s a song about losing. It reflects the hope over expectation experience of following the England team perfectly, with self-deprecating wit and pathos. Of course, “it’s coming home” has taken on a different meaning to the original one – about Euro 96 taking place in England, where association football was invented. It’s become a chorus of hope, even delusion at times – but you can only miss the irony and cleverness of the song if you haven’t really listened to it. The salty “football’s not coming home, England are” again misses the point: most fans just enjoy the journey and the brief flurries of hope.\n\nOf course, this year’s World Cup being staged in Qatar – an appalling decision by FIFA – has given the naysayers a new weapon. England apparently should not have gone, even though everyone else did. Their players should even have accepted being booked and banned from games by wearing a rainbow armband after FIFA warned of the consequences. I absolutely recognise that for some people, including some fans, a World Cup in Qatar was unacceptable and something they did not want to engage in. But for many of those complaining, a World Cup anywhere is the problem – and this is just a convenient attack line against players who have often shown themselves to have a social conscience. The same people piled on at the start of Covid, asking Premier League footballers to do more – though this was never asked of pop or film stars. And when the players actually did what they could to help – led by the admirable Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson – that particular avenue of moaning quietly died.\n\nWhether it’s bashing the national team or complaining about the huge popularity of the world’s most popular sport, the moaners are out in full force again. Guys, calm down. Watch Netflix and chill, read a book, talk about something else. If you don’t like something that other people do, that’s fine. You don’t need to keep telling us, you don’t need to wear your disapproval like some weird badge of honour. Just do what I do when Strictly Come Dancing comes on: let the people who like it enjoy it.\n\nIs this the least anticipated World Cup ever? Every football fan I talk to thinks so. Qatar should never have been awarded it given its vile human rights record – staging it there feels like a new low in attempted sports washing. Cheering on football teams in stadia migrant workers died building, in a country where it’s illegal to be gay, doesn’t really summon up the joy of the beautiful game. I feel slightly queasy about it at best and I understand those who want no part of it. Factor in the ludicrous decision to move the tournament to mid-season in most countries because Qatar was basically unsuitable to host the summer World Cup they had bid for, and it really does feel like the whole project has been ill-conceived.\n\nBut I will watch it and take an interest in the football, just as I’d probably buy a ticket for a Man City or Newcastle match if they were playing my team. As Jurgen Klopp says, none of this is the fault of the players. Many of them have spoken out against the Qatari regime and there are sure to be gestures and protests making clear that watching the football is not in any way an endorsement of its record.\n\nAnd if this does turn out to be the least celebrated World Cup ever, I will still have a treasure trove of memories of the best ones. The first one I watched properly was 1978 (we had no telly in 1974) – and below is my reverse ranking of all 11 World Cups I’ve watched, replete with England bias and perspective.\n\n11. 1994 (USA). Much to my late father’s annoyance, I support England when it comes to international football because (1) I was born there and (2) they had lots of Liverpool players in the team when I was a kid. They weren’t there in 1994 so I lent my support to Ireland, a team full of players who mostly wouldn’t make the England side and who were never going to win it. Not going to packed pubs full of the familiar hope over expectation atmosphere took away a fair bit from the tournament and aside from a thriller between Brazil and the Netherlands, the tournament had few memorable games. It culminated in a goalless final decided on penalties in favour of Brazil over Italy.\n\n10. 2002 Japan/South Korea. Lunchtime and early morning kick offs derailed some of this tournament for me and there were few great memories. Senegal beating France was a promising start, but South Korea and USA making the semi finals illustrate the standard of the football, which was largely a triumph of organisation over flair. England went out to a moment of Ronaldinho genius or a David Seaman howler, depending on your perspective. Brazil deservedly won, beating Germany in the final, but it wasn’t a tournament to remember.\n\n9. 2018 (Russia). A tournament where many of the best teams, with the exceptions of winner France, seemed to under-perform. England got the luck of the draw and played pretty well to join the French, Croatia and Belgium in the last four. Germany and Portugal crashed out early and classic matches were few and far between. The looming presence of Putin in the background didn’t help – while England fans enjoyed their progress in the easy half of the draw, it wasn’t a tournament that ever really took off.\n\n8. 2014 (Brazil). A World Cup in Brazil should have had us all salivating, but that wasn’t easy in England. Roy Hodgson managing England was always going to end in the curmudgeonly old sod moaning after being outplayed by a supposedly lesser team. While there may have been an inkling of satisfaction in rival fans who had bizarrely thought Liverpool’s dismissal of him harsh getting the full Hodgson experience, his pre-tournament management of expectations was such that it was hard to summon up any excitement about the finals. Some memorable goals from James Rodriguez and Germany’s 7-1 thrashing of Brazil weren’t enough to save the tournament from mediocrity, including a dull final where Germany beat Argentina in extra time.\n\n7. 2010 (South Africa). Most memorable for the remarkable Spain team who won it, elevating tiki-taka to the biggest competition in the game. (These were the days when it was played with energy and flair rather than endless backwards passes and pointless triangles.) There was great drama in the quarter-finals with Luis Suarez’s handball denying Ghana, the Germans grabbing three late goals to beat Argentina and Brazil going out to the Netherlands. The Dutch side were something of a disgrace in the final though, trying to kick their way to victory over a vastly superior Spain. Last call for England’s golden generation, smashed by Germany in the second round.\n\n6. 2006 (Germany). Very few shocks in this one, though the unfancied hosts did better than expected in making the semis and Portugal exceeded expectations doing the same. It felt all along like a tournament lots of teams could win, which is always a positive. The likes of Henry, Ronaldo and Messi had good moments while the world’s best player, Zidane, was outstanding until he lost his head – or used it to butt Matterazzi – in another disappointing final settled on penalties in Italy’s favour. Ronaldo got club mate Wayne Rooney dismissed as England went out on penalties in the quarters, in what was now time-honoured tradition.\n\n5. 1998 (France). That Michael Owen goal against Argentina will live long in the memory, as indeed will the 17 year old’s explosion on to the scene in this tournament. The same thrilling game saw Beckham’s dismissal after an encounter with Diego Simeone (as loveable then as now) and another penalty exit for the English. Elsewhere, Denis Bergkamp’s brilliant goal against Argentina remains one of the best seen on this stage, Nigeria burned brightly in the group stage before crashing out to Denmark and the original Ronaldo won the Golden Ball before playing very poorly through illness in the final . Brazil were red hot favourites that day, but in a memorable match France spanked them 3-0, with Zidane the star of the show as he was the tournament.\n\n4. 1986 (Mexico). This was 100% Maradona’s World Cup. The greatest player of all time dominated the tournament in a way arguably nobody has, scoring incredible solo goals and just looking head and shoulders above anyone else in the competition – and pretty much anyone we’d ever seen. England fans whine about the Hand of God goal, but the chutzpah of it honestly deserved admiration too. Gary Linker had a great tournament and came as close as anyone to denying Argentina in a thrilling quarter final, but it was a World Cup where the two best teams – Argentina and West Germany – contested the final and the best of the two won a great game 3-2, with Maradona assisting the late winner.\n\n3. 1990 (Italy). I am pretty certain there is an England bias in this choice, but there seemed much to love about Italia 90 beyond England’s Gazza and Lineker inspired run to the last four. Roger Milla and the exciting Cameroon side who beat champions Argentina in the group stages before exiting in a last 8 thriller against England; Jack Charlton’s Ireland storming to the quarter-finals, Romario, Baggio, Baresi, Van Basten, Gullit and Matthaus. Maradona not quite what he was but still remarkable, running screaming at the camera after scoring a goal. The Pavarotti soundtrack and again, that feeling that there was no clear favourite. But above all for me, love had the world in motion. After a shaky start, England came through their group, then beat Belgium in the last minute of extra time – a moment captured in the Three Lions songs but also memorable for me leaping so high in to the air that I broke my mum’s sofa when I landed. This was the brief period when Paul Gascoigne threatened to be a truly great player, a youngster who didn’t start the tournament as first choice but became central to England’s surge – along with Gary Lineker and David Platt. The thriller against Cameroon was followed by another penalty exit after a semi final in which they largely outplayed Germany, who went on to beat Argentina in an ill-tempered final.\n\n2. 1982 (Spain). This was a great tournament from start to finish – Algeria’s shock win over West Germany, who would bounce back led by the talismanic Karl-Heinz Rummenigge to contest the final, Northern Ireland stunning the hosts, Bryan Robson inspiring England through the group stages before going out in a three-team second phase without conceding a goal. But above all, I remember this World Cup for the fantastic Brazil side on Socrates, Falcao, Eder, Zico and Junior. They looked unbeatable and imperious at the outset, memorably swatting aside a Scotland team who had the temerity to take an early lead. Then somehow they went out to Italy in a game for the ages, Paulo Rossi scoring a hat trick in an incredible 3-2 win. Another classic followed in the Germany-France semi final – 3-3 after extra time, with the German keeper somehow getting away with an assault on Patrick Battiston – before emerging the hero in the penalty shoot out. Italy – now playing the handbrake off after years of negativity – deservedly won a pulsating final 3-1.\n\n1. 1978 (Argentina). I may be biased again here as it was the first one I saw. I was only dimly aware of my Dad’s rants about the Argentinian military junta. and only later understood the controversies around some of the results. Everything felt exotic, from the ‘Argentinian welcome’ to the ‘down the line’ commentary to the sudden preponderance of long range goals. Argentina, in their iconic strip, fascinated and beguiled me – Kempes, Luque, Passarella, Ardiles and the keeper, Fillol . To my father’s alarm, I adopted them over the Netherlands after the Scots went out. Yes, this was another tournament England didn’t make, but I didn’t care at that age – I was happy to support the Scotland of Dalglish, Souness and Hansen. The tragicomic story of Ally’s Army will live long in the memory – the stunning defeat against Cubillas-inspired Peru, Willie Johnstone sent home in disgrace, then that never to be forgotten game against the Netherlands where we actually thought Archie Gemmill’s brilliant goal was going to help them pull off the impossible. Alongside Italy’s group stage win v the hosts, it was probably the game of the tournament. Scotland aside, it was a tournament full of amazing players and characters that you didn’t see week in week out as we do now . Not just the Argentinians, but Rensenbrink, Neeskens and Rep of the Netherlands, Bettega, Zoff and the hilariously misnamed Gentile of Italy, Quiroga, the ultimate eccentic keeper of Peru. Argentina beat the Netherlands 3-1 in a terrific final, though their 6-0 win over Peru to get there on goal difference and a number of decisions in their favour throughout the tournament raised questions. As a boy, I wasn’t interested; I just thought their football was glorious. I still can’t move this World Cup down the rankings even one place; I loved it.\n\nSteven Gerrard’s dismissal from Aston Villa was no surprise in the end, after an abysmal start to the 2022//3 season. Once again, a manager who swept to Scottish titles with one of the two Glasgow clubs has come up short on the much harsher terrain of the Premier League. While it is way too early in Gerrard’s managerial career for obituaries, speculation about a future return to Liverpool as successor to Jurgen Klopp looks more of a pipe dream than ever.\n\nGerrard’s reputation may yet recover, but it is striking how many top players – especially those lauded as leaders on the pitch – never quite cut it as managers. English pundits and journalists have a terrible tendency to hype certain types of ex players as the men to ‘sort out’ a club in difficulty. The original Captain Fantastic, Bryan Robson, has many heirs in great players who were not great coaches – Roy Keane, Alan Shearer, Tony Adams and Stuart Pearce among them. Graeme Souness, like Gerrard, was a huge success at Rangers before failing spectacularly on his own return to Anfield and going on to become a middling Premier League manager. Frank Lampard might have ‘got’ Chelsea but he couldn’t get them winning much. Like Gerrard, Lampard may go on to better things – but the early signs at Everton and his previous efforts at Derby are hardly Earth shattering.\n\nIt’s not completely clear why punditry reverts to the stereotype of the great influencer on the pitch being as effective off it. Modern football coaching is not about shouting at players and telling them to get their act together – if indeed coaching was ever about that. Alex Ferguson may be the last ‘old style’ manager with a disciplinarian streak to taste success, but his management incorporated kidology, bravado and inspirational coaching as much as hairdryers. Remember how people mocked the seemingly taciturn football intellectual Arsene Wenger before he led Arsenal to an era of unprecedented success – how would this man control a dressing room with the likes of Adams in it? With great aplomb, as it turned out.\n\nSo much football coverage still revolves around “man’s game” cliches. Every week, Roy Keane opines about players in whichever team he has just seen losing not trying hard enough. Souness is cut from the same cloth. Listening to them as pundits – while their analysis is entertaining – you can start to see why maybe they weren’t top managers. Modern players are a different breed, with different needs and expectations of their coaching staff – so even if the “get out and there and play” approach ever worked, it’s unlikely to do so now.\n\nI’m not saying for a minute that that is the approach of Gerrard and others. But is is implicit in what some pundits and reporters say that that is all that is required. And of course it is way easier to talk about football with passion and than it is to manage an actual team, as I’m sure Gary Neville would testify.\n\nThere is nothing that any of the great on-pitch leaders above have done as managers that marks them out as special – in most cases, they have been unsuccessful. It may even be that great players do not often make great coaches, as so much came so easily to them as footballers. But pundits need to stop hyping particular types of footballer – usually English – as the next superstar coach. If Gerrard had led Villa to the Champions League places, he might have been a contender for the Anfield hot seat. Beyond that, his only qualification was having been a great player there – much like Souness before him.\n\n“I’ve always said Kevin Keegan is overrated,” my father once said, as my MUFC-supporting neighbour predicted his departure would see Liverpool decline. Both were wrong: Liverpool brought in Kenny Dalglish and rose to new heights; Keegan was twice European Footballer of the Year and is if anything historically underrated.\n\nI have written before about my Dad’s strange sporting biases – a supposed Liverpool fan who seemed to advocate against them in most games we watched together. Ian Rush, Alan Hansen, Phil Neal and even Graeme Souness were among other LFC legends he declared not as good as others claimed. Strangely, Irish internationals Steve Heighway, Ronnie Whelan and Mark Lawrenson were the main men (though even he had to acknowledge Dalglish’s brilliance). Given that these were the views of a man who had fiercely declared that “if you put those two Irish teams together, you’d have a team that would take on the world” – I think there is at least consistency of view. (I’m sure Maradona, Socrates, Platini, Rummenigge et al would have been terrified at the the thought of a team containing both Noel Brotherston and Kevin Moran.)\n\nBut just looking at those names in the paragraph above, I realise I remember all of them as incredible footballers mostly better than what the Premier League of today has to offer (ok, probably not the last two). There is no doubt that the Premier League has taken football hype to previously unseen levels: its hyperventilating promoters tend to see its launch as a kind of football year zero where records began (it was just a rebrand, lads). It’s also the case that people who attack Souness for criticising Paul Pogba on the basis that Souness was a lesser player are barking mad – he was twice the footballer Pogba is. But does that classic ‘year zero’ ignorance have a reverse? Do we in fact remember the footballers of our own youth over fondly, just as we criticise younger fans for believing the hype about the current generation of players?\n\nIn other areas of life, we definitely have a tendency to do this. Most people seem to regard the music of their teens and twenties as a kind of golden age. We often hear “they don’t make ’em like that anymore” praise for old TV shows. And there’s even a weird nostalgia for politicians of the past in some circles, though that may genuinely reflect how far standards have fallen.\n\nFalling standards, you see, is where it’s at. As we get older, we often seem to think things are getting worse, or at least that they are not as good as they were when we were younger – and presumably happier and less stressed. We deride mobile phones, social media, You Tube and even the ease with which kids can find things on Google. It could be argued that these advances have not all universally improved the human experience, but the “not in my day” perspective can skew world views in the strangest ways.\n\nSo to football. I do (of course) think that all of the Liverpool players on that list – including my Dad’s picks – were exceptional. Many, like Keegan, are underrated historically. And the four superstar names at the end would have been giants in any football period. I also recognise it is difficult to compare athletes across eras in which technology, training, diet and facilities have changed vastly. But there are other players I look back on as remarkable who probably weren’t. Was Joe Corrigan really a shoo-in to be England goalie in any era apart from the Clemence and Shilton one? Was Alan Kennedy – who was kept out of the England team by Mick Mills of Ipswich – really a great full back or did he just score some huge goals? Were the likes of Mills, Steve Perryman, Bob Latchford, Tony Woodcock and (sorry, Dad) Norman Whiteside any more than pretty good players?\n\nIt is easy to forget the reverse effect of the hype: ex players were not subjected to anything like the same scrutiny. We didn’t see all their games – and mistakes – on TV every week. We didn’t have whole TV shows, websites and internet channels dedicated to analysing every last detail of every game and player. Everything was viewed through the cosy Match of the Day highlights reels, with a little bit of comment but nothing like the industry of opinion and hot takes modern players have to deal with. And that’s before we get on to players being criticised in person on social media (often by people who have never set foot inside the club they claim to support). If you look at the recent struggles of, say, Harry Maguire or Trent Alexander Arnold, it’s impossible not to recognise the impact of media and social media, the narrative being shared daily with the player himself. One day Trent has revolutionised his position and is the best current English footballer; the next he should be dropped.\n\nAnother word from my Dad at this point. “You see Bobby Charlton goals and say what an amazing player. Actually, he tried those shots about ten times a game and most of them went 30 yards over the bar.” This may be typically harsh and biased – Charlton was known not to get along with George Best (who of course my father regarded as the greatest footballer ever, bar none). But the claim is illustrative, even if my Dad himself would only rarely have seen Charlton play 90 minutes. Highlights reels, big live games and above all rose-tinted memories definitely play a part in our memories of former players – even if industrial-level hype might inflate opinions of the current crop.\n\nThere are two sides to the story. We may well remember some players as better than they were, aiding our perception that current players (and the current game) are overstated. Equally, that perception is itself accurate, as broadcasters and other media continue to sell the Premier League as if it were the start of football rather than a new name. As in other areas of life, the reality is somewhere in between: every era has its share of brilliance and mediocrity – and people will often argue for their own halcyon days and figures as the best ones.\n\nSo it looks like Liverpool and Manchester United will be fighting to stay in the Premier League this season. West Ham are gone already. And it’s three titles in a row for mighty Manchester City and their lovely paymasters.\n\nThat’s what football social media half suggests, anyway. Regardless of the fact that each team has played a grand total of three games, sweeping conclusions are being leapt to everywhere. Historically, we didn’t even see league tables at this point of the year (and in most years, the season was only just beginning.) We have a ridiculously compressed calendar because of a moronic, money-motivated decision to play the World Cup in Qatar in winter. Even as a fan, I wasn’t quite ready to pitch back in to the hype and madness that is the English Premier League; I am sure players used to easing their way back from the beach about now wish they were still sunbathing.\n\nFootball and social media are a terrible combination. Social media requires binary views and simplistic, tribal arguments. Football is basically built on the latter and is increasingly driven by its marketeers towards the former. Messi or Ronaldo? Gerrard or Lampard? Pep or Klopp? The pointless arguments rage to the point where the one you prefer is brilliant beyond reproach and the other a comically overrated spoofer.\n\nSky Sports remains the premier pusher of the Premier League. In many ways, what they do is brilliant and the likes of BT, the BBC and Johnny-come-latelys Amazon have been left in the dust. Sky has by far the best pundits – Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher remain the prime movers – but has anyone else noticed how shouty they have all become lately? Like every other broadcaster, Sky Sports knows controversy means clicks and clicks may attract new audiences.\n\nSo we have the bizarre spectacle of Jamie “look at me when I’m talking to you” Redknapp facing off against Gary Neville over the blame for Man United’s lost decade. We have Roy Keane rants about players being worried about their hairstyles; Graeme Souness telling Emma Carney and others it’s a “man’s game”. All this replayed for clicks and comments on socials. Everyone has to take a side: players and teams are either the best of all time or overpaid flops. This feverish hype generates your social media traffic; you can leave the tiresome “bantz” and tribalism between rival fans to raise the pitch to screeching point.\n\nLast week, Manchester United were down and out after two games, their new manager had failed, or the owners had, or the players had, or something. Argue that out among yourselves, as loudly as possible please. This week, Manchester United beat Liverpool. Now it is Liverpool – who a matter of weeks ago were being lauded as one of the greatest teams of all time – who are in ‘crisis’. Three games, no wins. There is no way they will make up a gargantuan 7-point gap from the remaining 105 points available. Liverpool’s defeat and two draws have taken the heat off not just Man United, but also Chelsea, who slumped to a shock 3-0 at Leeds. Should Liverpool win their next game and Chelsea lose theirs, the knees will jerk towards the Blues. “Fundamental questions” will suddenly need to be asked about what has gone wrong at Stamford Bridge.\n\nFor this bonkers agenda to take hold, and for Sky and the many media outlets to maximise interest in their product, every game has to be life or death, critical and consequential. Had VAR done its job at Old Trafford, the second goal may not have counted and the story may be different: how could United turn these improved performances into wins? Questions about Liverpool would remain, partly due to the ridiculous standards they and Man City have set in recent seasons, where the occasional draw has felt akin to a defeat. But the narrative changes with each result. Everything is based on what happened yesterday. Neville is an admirable pundit, but the number of times he has seen the green shoots of recovery at Old Trafford only to denounce the club as falling apart within weeks is extraordinary. Except it’s not, because that is how modern football punditry works – it is all about the last game, the newest signing or the latest social media-friendly rant.\n\nSo as heads fall off all over the place, perhaps we’re just better to remember what’s great about football: it’s unpredictable. Sports washing empires and too much money may have made it less so this century, but football is unlike almost any other sport in its capacity to produce surprise results. The best team won’t always win, the best players won’t always perform. Moments of magic, mistakes and madness will continue to impact the outcome. Good footballers won’t become bad and poor football teams won’t become good overnight.\n\nIt is not actually possible, in the early stages of a disrupted season, to draw any conclusions about anything (at a similar stage last year, Man City were faltering and Man United were supposedly an emerging force). If everyone could just calm down, wait and see and start to assess the situation around the time we break for this stupidly-timed World Cup, we’d all be better for it – except, perhaps, those whose audiences depend on the whole enterprise being conducted on the edge of hysteria.\n\n*Photo – Daily Mirror"
