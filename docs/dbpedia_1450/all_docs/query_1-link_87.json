        "text": "Jack Dempsey (born June 24, 1895, Manassa, Colorado, U.S.—died May 31, 1983, New York, New York) was an American world heavyweight boxing champion, regarded by many as the epitome of the professional fighter. He held the title from July 4, 1919, when he knocked out Jess Willard in three rounds in Toledo, Ohio, until September 23, 1926, when he lost a 10-round decision to Gene Tunney in Philadelphia. Dempsey fought 84 bouts, winning 62, 51 of which were by knockout.\n\n(Read Gene Tunney’s 1929 Britannica essay on boxing.)\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nDempsey started boxing in 1914 under the name Kid Blackie. In 1918 and early 1919 he compiled an impressive number of knockouts, most in the first round, to earn a fight with Willard. The 37-year-old champion proved no match for young Dempsey, who attacked ferociously from the starting bell and knocked Willard to the floor seven times in the first round. Even more primitive in its intensity was Dempsey’s title defense against Argentine heavyweight Luis Angel Firpo in New York City on September 14, 1923. After being knocked out of the ring in the first round, Dempsey battered Firpo into defeat in the second.\n\nDuring the next three years Dempsey fought only exhibition matches, and at the age of 31 he found that he had aged too much to deal with the carefully trained Tunney in their first fight. On September 22, 1927, in Chicago, they met again in the famous “Battle of the Long Count,” in which Dempsey forfeited his chance for a seventh-round knockout by standing over the fallen Tunney rather than going to a neutral corner of the ring. Tunney recovered to win another 10-round decision.\n\nIn his boxing style Dempsey kept on the offensive almost continuously, bobbing up and down and moving from side to side as he delivered short swinging blows out of a crouch. His constant movement and the speed of his attack constituted his defense."
