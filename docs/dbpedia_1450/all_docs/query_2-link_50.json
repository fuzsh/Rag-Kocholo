        "text": "To echo what has been said by Alex Toolis, Super Series has served as a much needed bridge between the professional and club game, as was its intended purpose. As a nation with only 2 pro teams, a semi-pro league was an excellent way of developing talent in a limited pool. Many players within the league started at U20 age and have either just progressed or have only just graduated from U20 level, and so perhaps the impact of Super Series has not yet been fully realised? On a similar note as mentioned by Alex, several Scottish Qualified players have came into Boroughmuir Bears and exited to a higher standard of game, whether that be 7's, Pro contracts, or the English Champ. From a coaching perspective, this has of massive value in enhancing my skill-set and knowledge base as a practitioner, and was my first role in S&C. It also highlighted to me that outside of regional academies, very few players had any structured S&C input, which is pivotal to player development. The focus of the Bears was always to develop players, and we branded ourselves around evolution, winning games was a nice bonus. The Bears served as an aspiration for kids coming into Boroughmuir, and served as an achievable stepping stone into the pro game. Super Series definitely had room for improvement, had these areas been addressed it would've been great to see where another 5yrs would take the game. I will personally be sad to see this competition end. #rugbyunion #scottishrugby #strengthandconditioning\n\nIts a almost six months since i posted anything on here about Premier League Security. Why? during that time i have been working as DOR (in a department of 1 including myself) to bring rugby back to Ambleside Centurions RUFC in the South Lakes. In that time we have played 14 and won 4, losing five matches by 3 points or less, and going from a group of players running around on a bit of grass to a very good team playing structured and hard rugby as we proved on Saturday when we played away at Burnley and went down 17-15 missing a conversion at the death to tie the game. Over the last 6 months we have attracted over SIXTY young and old men to the club, and i even put my boots on for the very last time playing in a 20-10 victory away at Wigton. The committee has changed massively by almost 70% bringing in fresh blood with bags of enthusiasm to drive the club forward and back into the league next season. The village has got behind us as its the clubs 150th anniversary next season which i am sure will be an amazing success given all we have achieved this season. SO what has all this got to do with work and business? Apart from the obvious answer which is team work its how one person an energy giver can spark a change in a team environment that becomes something unstoppable. A young man called Nathan inspired me with his enthusiasm, passion, and positive energy to get back involved in grass roots rugby when the club was one game away from folding. I inspired our new head coach to join us, he inspired a physio and two assistant coaches to join him at the club and so it went on. The result was within six months we had been fully accredited and recognised by the RFU, played more games in a season than we had for many years, fulfilled all of our fixtures with a full team, hosted a tournament, sportsmen's dinner and player awards evening and even had time to fit in a team visit to watch Sale Sharks. All of the above reminded me that in sport and business it is essential that you only fill your team with energy givers to create the right team environment for everyone to flourish and to form a bond as a team that tight that it is very hard to break. Anyway the seasons over and i need to focus on Premier League Security now but it has been great to have a break and at the same time remind myself of a number of valuable lessons that apply in sport, business and life. PHOTO, Ex-British and Irish Lion John \"Bentos\" Bentley presented our Player of the Year and Players Player of the Year with their trophies at our awards dinner last Saturday night. Bentos was on top form and i would recommend anyone who has not heard him speak to book him for entertainment at your club or motivation at your business as he was in sparkling form the other night inspiring a new generation of young rugby players with some riving stories of rugby and life.\n\nFollowing on from my last post and refreshed interest in rugby, today I went and listened to Richie McCaw at the Carterton Events Centre. The event was free, and organised by the Wairarapa Rural Trust and Westpac. The theme was leadership and resilience. The event was booked out as soon as it was advertised. The Events Centre was full to capacity with a total mix of my community. There was something quite special about the event and knowing that everyone attending wanted not just to see Richie McCaw but listen to his thoughts on leadership and resilience. I was actually a bit ambivalent about going because sometimes the word resilience seems to me a word bandied about by those fortunate not to have faced certain challenges. I’ve learnt though everyone has their own challenges and it is good to talk about how to use positive strategies to cope.My only regret is I didn’t get a pic afterwards. The guy deserves his knighthood just for his patience at the photo shoots after the event. There was so much packed into the live “podcast”. Most of it was familiar. The point of difference was the way Richie McCaw authentically talked about how he led himself and teams and has learned how to be resilient. A few things that resonated: 1. Be consistent 2. Don’t look over your shoulder- it’s not about other up and coming players - it’s about being as good as you can be and to work on that every day. They may overtake you eventually, but your focus should be on moving forward and you can’t do that looking over your shoulder. 3. Be uncomfortable with being comfortable - or get uncomfortable to progress and grow 4. Breathe and keep your head up. He highlighted this wasn’t just a metaphor but a practical tactic to success on the rugby field. 5. You can be be the best rugby player in the world but you have to be able to deliver on game day. You don’t just turn up, you prepare, practice and work on your physical and mental strengths. If you get the chance to hear Richie McCaw speak in your town or city I highly recommend you go. You might not get the free venison burgers on offer today, but you will get some inspiration. I was in the second row so managed to get this pic of a great New Zealand rugby player.\n\nAll Blacks rugby legend Sir Colin Meads once suggested that, ‘leadership is within the team’. He elaborated by highlighting how everyone has a role in leadership's construction. We could extend this sentiment further to, ‘leadership is within the club’. Specifically, leadership is not simply something that reflects the players or coaches, but everyone involved in the club can demonstrate leadership in some way. For example, within elite rugby, multi-disciplinary teams play a huge part in how leadership is expressed. Physiotherapists, medics, strength and conditioning (S&C) staff, psychology, nutrition etc. working with the players and coaches to innovate accordingly. I often recall within rugby, and wider elite sports, how support staff would work extremely hard to develop a bespoke rehabilitation strategy for an injured player. Often the injury might present some form of ‘wicked problem’, without an obvious solution, and physios, medics, S&C and others would need to work hard to devise something that met the needs of that player within that context. We know that leadership is ‘plural’ in how it operates i.e. done between people AND in various different forms of practice. Although collective leadership in rugby may have originated in the ‘back seat of the bus’ with senior players, within most modern elite settings the locus of leading has now spread out further. All players, coaches and staff may at times lead based off the need and problem that is in front of them. In my fourth infographic around leadership in rugby, I therefore reflect on the ways leadership is fostered across the entire club. I hope you find it useful :) Denis, J., A. Langley and V.

In the summer, I was Geoffrey Boycott, stoically blocking ball after ball for hours on end. I was proud to finish 27 not out after 3 hours batting. \"At probably twelve or thirteen I realised I would not be lining up in the future for Leeds United or batting for Yorkshire. The short reason, I didn’t have the sporting talent required. The long answer, well that’s a different story! \"I work for LAPS: Life After Professional Sport and I help sports professionals transition from their sport into their next career. What I’ve noticed over the years is that sports professionals have enhanced soft skills that alongside their undoubted talent help them achieve their sporting goals. \"They are focussed on the end result, their professional goal to achieve. They are driven, determined and resilient. A little example of this. I referred a sports professional for a sales role with one of our clients. They asked for an example of resilience. The response was, 'I prepared for four years to go to the Olympics, at the final trial I missed out on selection by 0.2 seconds. That was the end of my dream after four years of blood, sweat and tears! What did I do? I was back in training the next day, preparing for competition, and planning for the World Championships. I just went again and used that disappointment to drive me on for the next challenge.' \"Let me go back to the young me who dreamed of playing football and cricket professionally. \"I didn't have the sporting skill, but I also didn’t have an innate drive to succeed. The determination and resilience to overcome all obstacles. The ability to listen, learn and put lessons into practice. In short, I wasn’t coachable, I didn’t have sufficient discipline, I didn’t have leadership qualities. I didn’t have the talent; but I also didn’t have all the other skills needed to be successful. What I have learnt over the years working with sports professionals is that the talent is not enough. \"Why am I putting this in writing today? \"I want you all to know that sports professionals are brilliant additions to any business. What they lack in work experience pales into insignificance when you consider what they bring. If you want to invigorate your workforce, add the drive to be successful and overcome all obstacles, I suggest you seriously think about recruiting an elite athlete. \"For me, if you can’t be a sports professional, the next best thing is to work alongside them! I’m lucky to do that. If you are a business recruiting, try looking beyond work experience and look at the traits and skills this group can bring, you will not be disappointed.\"\n\n🏉🌍 Fair Play Showdown: New Zealand vs. Ireland 🇳🇿🇮🇪 In the world of rugby, some of the most epic battles have been waged between the giants of New Zealand and the spirited warriors of Ireland. Yet, beyond the fierce competition on the field, there's a lesson here for both sports and business enthusiasts alike – the power of fair play and strategic resilience. 🇳🇿 New Zealand, a nation known for its rugby prowess, has consistently showcased a commitment to the highest standards of sportsmanship. Despite being a relatively small island nation, they've conquered the rugby world stage with their unwavering dedication, skill, and respect for their opponents. They bring to the table not only a fierce determination to win but a sense of fair play that's emblematic of their national character. As we delve into this showdown of fair play and strategic brilliance between New Zealand and Ireland, we'll uncover valuable insights for businesses striving to thrive in a competitive world. Stay tuned for a riveting exploration of how these nations have harnessed the spirit of the game to achieve greatness, both in rugby and in their respective global endeavors. 🏉🤝🌏 🏉📈 Making Business Resilient: A Lesson from Rugby 🌏 In the world of sports, football and rugby represent two distinct styles of play. Similarly, in the business world, organizations can draw valuable lessons from these games. 🏟️ ⚽️ Football often relies on short bursts of intense teamwork, mirroring some businesses' short-term focus. But let's take a page from the rugby playbook. 🏉 🧠 Resilience & Strategy: Rugby teams exhibit unwavering resilience and strategic thinking, setting them up for long-term sustainability. Business leaders, take note! 🌱 🌏 Just like New Zealand Rugby, it's not about the size but how you operate. New Zealand, not the biggest island, possesses some of the smartest strategic plays, akin to an elite corporate entity. 🤝 🇮🇪 Ireland, with a population just over 5 million, mirrors this concept. They prove that size doesn't dictate success. Their commitment to fair play and strategic thinking makes them a formidable competitor in rugby and a model for businesses to follow. 🍀 🌿 In countries like New Zealand and Ireland, where the wildlife isn't abundant, they've cultivated a powerful culture within their rugby teams. This culture, deeply rooted in their nation's values, exemplifies how culture can be a potent force in business. 🇳🇿🍀 🔗 As we journey toward Net Zero, remember that it's not just about the destination but how we get there. Cultivate resilience, strategy, a unifying culture, and a commitment to fair play. That's the path to lasting success in both sports and business. 💼 Let's embrace the New Zealand and Irish Rugby way – size doesn't matter; it's all about how we play the game and the culture we create. 🌟 #BusinessStrategy #Resilience #NetZero #NewZealandRugby #IrelandRugby #CultureMatters #FairPlay #Sustainability\n\nAs I work from home on this snowy day, I watch my son bundle up to go shovel through the neighborhood to make some cash. While I would love to take the credit for his work ethic, I know that it was learned by playing team sports. Even though it is often tough balancing work and home life, organized sports help create the next generation of winners that will replace us all. If you know any athletes looking for a career in sales send them my way! Cheers! 1.Show Respect Respect has all but vanished from everyday life, yet out on the rugby field it still remains as important as ever. Whether it be the referee, your team mate or your opposite number, rugby teaches you to show them respect without becoming a mindless lackey. 2.You’ve Got To Play Through The Pain Much like in the rest of life, whining on the rugby field gets you nowhere. Rugby teaches players that the best way to deal with pain is to get straight back on your feet and try again. You’re sure as hell not going to learn your lesson if you keep getting pandered to over the slightest cut or bruise. 3.Life’s Better When You Stick Together Rugby is one of the most team oriented sports in the world where the only way to win is to work together as a unit to overcome any obstacles put in your way. Rugby teaches you how to effectively work with others and that achieving your goals as part of a team is much more rewarding than doing so as an individual. 4.Good Things Come To Those Who Wait The guys at Guinness were spot on with this quote. Rugby teaches you that if you spend the whole game running around trying to get involved you’re going to end up dead on your feet and become ineffective. Instead wait for the perfect opportunity to make your move and trust those around you to do their jobs. 5.The Little Things Are What Really Count Whilst it may be the tries and big hits that take the headlines, anyone who has been around rugby for a whilst will know that these are mere window dressings. It is the disruptions at the ruck or the covering drift defence that win you games. Rugby helps you appreciate the little things in life that little bit more. 6.Life Doesn’t Come With A Safety Manual In rugby players have little to no protection despite engaging in some of the most physical contests in the sporting world. Much like in life there is no cushion to protect you from heavy blows, instead you are reliant on your own resilience to get you through. 7.Passion & Commitment Are Everything Anyone doing something in life, much like in rugby will never reach the best of their abilities unless they dive in with their heart and soul. As in life, with rugby if you make a run or attempt a tackle without fully committing you’re never going to come off as well as if you put everything into it.\n\nHeading North: Why Scandinavia is a Great Move for Australian Footballers In recent years, a new trend has emerged in the world of Australian football - an increasing number of players are setting their sights on Scandinavia as an enticing destination for their professional careers. While traditional footballing powerhouses like England, Spain, and Germany have long been the preferred choices, a growing recognition of the unique opportunities in Scandinavian leagues is reshaping the narrative. A recent visit to Melbourne by Erik Nevland Sporting Director of Viking Fotball and former Fulham Football Club colleague, shed light on the mutual appreciation between Australian talent and Scandinavian football. As Nevland scouted for potential talent, our conversation delved into the qualities that make Australian players an attractive option. With Nick D’Agostino, Patrick Yezbeck, and Gianni Stensness already making waves at Viking FK, Nevland's interest serves as a testament to the value he sees in the Australian football market. Insights from my time at AaB A/S Drawing from my experiences during my time at Aalborg BK in Denmark, we explore the key reasons why Scandinavia has become a magnet for Australian footballers. Competitive Leagues with a Strong Footballing Culture: - The Scandinavian countries, including Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, boast highly competitive football leagues. - During my tenure at Aalborg BK, the intensity of the Scandinavian leagues provided a unique blend of physicality and tactical sophistication, pushing players to elevate their skills. High-Quality Facilities and Infrastructure: - Scandinavia's reputation for high quality sports infrastructure was evident in Aalborg BK's commitment to modern training facilities. - The structured organisation of leagues and competitions creates a professional framework, fostering stability and growth. Gateway to Broader European Markets: - Playing in Scandinavia offers a strategic advantage as a gateway to broader European markets. - Scandinavian leagues are increasingly recognised as talent pools, providing a stepping stone for Australian players to showcase their skills on a larger stage. Cultural Similarities and Quality of Life: - Scandinavia provides a cultural fit for Australian players, with shared values in work ethic, teamwork, and player welfare. Final Thoughts: As more Australian footballers make the leap to Scandinavia, the global footballing landscape is undergoing a shift. The combination of competitive football, world-class infrastructure, strategic opportunities, and cultural alignment is making Scandinavia an increasingly popular choice for Australian talents seeking international success. The transition of players from the A-League to Scandinavia adds weight to the notion that this region is not just a destination but a springboard for emerging Australian footballing talent. #football #footballplayer #highperformance\n\nReflection time. Last night, the #rugby team I #coach, Consett Rugby Club, faced defeat in the Men's Durham County Senior Cup by Durham City Rugby. As I pondered the reasons behind our loss – whether it was skill levels, player performance, decision-making, or coaching strategies, of which I think a lot comes down to the coach – I couldn't help but draw parallels between the world of rugby and the dynamics of the business world. In coaching rugby at an amateur level, our approach mirrors that of nurturing talent within a business. Each week, we see players turning up for training, committed to honing their skills. We invest time in refining techniques, drilling repetitive exercises to instil muscle memory, and meticulously analyse past games to inform our coaching strategies moving forward. Similarly, in the business arena, success hinges on fostering a positive environment that encourages innovation and growth. Just as a rugby team rallies around a shared goal, in #business, a cohesive team spirit is essential for achieving collective success. It's the 'one for all and all for one' attitude that epitomises teamwork, making the dream work. Moreover, at Consett, we're building something truly special. It's not just about the first team; it's about how the community adopts rugby and the rugby club as a whole. We're striving to embed the ethos of the rugby club across all levels – from social gatherings to community events. Our aim is to foster a sense of unity and purpose, driving towards shared goals both on and off the field. The idea of localism within business is proven to be successful, and we're eager to bring this concept to the forefront of the community within rugby. By providing a platform for young men and women, children, and adults to engage with the sport in various capacities – whether playing, socialising, or simply meeting up – we aim to create a vibrant hub where individuals can connect, compete, and grow. Through rugby, we not only instil fundamental skills but also provide people with a sense of purpose. Whether it's on the pitch or within the clubhouse, our goal is to nurture a community where everyone feels valued and empowered to succeed. As a coach, I believe it's important to take the burden of the loss. While we acknowledge there's work to be done, we're confident that we're moving in the right direction. In both rugby and business, the achievement of small goals leads to a positive mindset, building confidence that anything is achievable. We want the team involved with Consett to embrace this mindset – it's okay to strive for improvement, but we need to do it together. If anyone is keen to come on this journey with us, please let me know. Your support and enthusiasm would be greatly appreciated as we work towards our shared goals. 🤔 Thanks for all the support David Trott Ian McGeorge Ian Jackson Glyn Howatson\n\nOver the weekend, I proudly became a founding member of the Tasmania Devils Football team. While I may have joined a bit late, I was swept up in the excitement. For those unfamiliar with Australian Rules Football, particularly in Tasmania, the state team had previously applied to the prestigious AFL Australian Football League and was unfortunately rejected. However, the tide has turned, and the Tasmania Devils have been accepted into the AFL. They are set to join the AFL pre-season 2028 and play their inaugural game in 2028. In March 2024, the AFL announced that the new team would be called the Tasmania Devils. The Devils Board immediately invited anyone to sign up as a Founding Member for only $10. They receive a Tasmania Devil sticker and the chance to buy other items. One of the most compelling aspects of this opportunity is that founding members will forever hold that distinction. This unique privilege adds a special touch to the membership experience. Within a mere week of the membership announcement, an astounding 150,000 members had already signed up, surpassing the membership numbers of some well-established AFL Football clubs. This rapid growth is a testament to the power of strategic planning and community engagement. The Tasmania Devils' board has been brilliant and strategic in recruiting and growing their membership base. Here are just some of my observations that you can apply yourself. 😎 They quickly acknowledged the shared frustration within the Tasmanian football community. It was always a moment of unity when some of Australia's greatest AFL football players came from Tasmania, and this was the spirit they tapped into. 😎 They provided an entry-level membership of $10.00, which included digital benefits and a sticker. In the first week, the membership numbers went from zero to over 150,000, with an estimated revenue of $1.5 million. Revenue was one of many immediate benefits. Tassie Devils football jumpers and car stickers were worn at key AFL matches promoting the brand. From my years of experience with membership, I have never witnessed this massive growth of any NFP organisation. However, there is nothing to stop taking a similar approach, so here are some ideas you may want to consider 😎 How many members of your community are members of your organisation? For example, one business industry association we consult has only 160 members. Yes, the potential membership is 6,000. So, what incentive would you offer new entry members to join this organisation? 😎 Suppose you offer professional accreditation as part of your membership offering, which relies on examinations to achieve that status. Do you have a grandfather clause that recognises previous experience or qualifications? Good luck, Tasmania Devils. #associations #association #membership"
