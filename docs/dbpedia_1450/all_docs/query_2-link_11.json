        "text": "McGregor, Mourinho, Özil, Naismith, Tottenham, Winter Break, Ireland’s European Championship group.\n\nA few things have stood out for me as the main factors that caused Chelsea’s seemingly unstoppable negative run of results. The Dr Eva Caneiro issue, Mourinho’s ex close and early mentor Louis Van Gaal entering the same sphere, failing to sign John Stones so publicly, returning to pre-season later than other teams, signing of a four year deal in the summer and inheriting some of his squad.\n\nThere has been an air of apprehension that creeped into the players and their performances. Everywhere they looked their feeling was supported by reports, pundits and the footballing public which was ultimately to great a force to turn around.\n\nThis apprehension and negativity was justified. Dr. Eva Caneiro began her role on the bench with Roberto Di Matteo and any criticism of a female doctor being at the heart of a male squad could never have been entertained or accepted as the team went on to win the UEFA Champions League. The reason for her dismissal given by Mr. Mourinho was not her gender it was his view that she did not understand football after entering the field of play in the final minutes of the tight 2-2 game against Swansea. The general consensus by football followers from the outside seemed to agree that this incident was unfair. Carneiro was admired by Chelsea supporters and she had established her position and had made progress for women in football which was widely recognised and supported. An awkward incident Mourinho usually doesn’t come out on the wrong side of and it continues with legal action. Chelsea have lost half of their games since.\n\nReturning to pre-season later was a gamble, it was scrutinized by all which their performances and results on tour to USA didn’t negate. I was hopeful and confident Radamael Falcao would find great form again signing for Chelsea but that did not happen and was another lost gamble.\n\nAttempting to sign John Stones so publicly and urgently was a clear signal that confidence in John Terry as a dominant, regular, fortress was not so high which was continuously supported by substituting him at half time, leaving him out, being sending off and playing Kurt Zouma. Yes John Terry is 35, it is normal to find a replacement but it wasn’t sorted.\n\nPaul Lambert signed a four year contract at the end of last season with Aston Villa and the following season saw poor run results and he lost his job. José Mourinho signed a four year contract in the summer. Does that breed a sense of less urgency, an urgency that is needed to get the edge in the Premier League to get results.\n\nLikewise Arsenal have been able to raise their level this season and it may be put down to Arsène Wenger feeling his position as being most under threat in years after a lot of pressure and spotlight was put on him by many including Mourinho. Jamie Vardy’s super record aside, last month saw Mesut Özil broke the Premier League record for assists, achieving assists in seven consecutive games, two phenomenal records.\n\nConor McGregor has given a lot of people a big boost. I haven’t heard a lot of negativity about him, a little but not a lot. I never was into the sport, the Rockhold -v- Wiedman fight was nasty, but it is the best to see a Dubliner doing so well, enjoying what he is doing, confident, being positive and bringing a lot of enjoyment for everyone else. It must have been a big gamble to put all his time, energy and commitment into UFC as a complete unknown and he has achieved success, a great story. If my young brother is anything to go there are lots of big brothers out there now getting battered and guillotined. There should be no hesitation whatsoever for a homecoming. He has already given €50,000 to homeless charity.\n\nEverton’s Steven Naismith paying for Christmas Dinner for a homeless group in Glasgow through Loaves and Fishes charity was a great act. I think he has been doing a lot of charity work for homeless over the years and it is very good to see them stories appearing.\n\nTottenham receiving planning permission for their new stadium will please all Spurs fans of course, staying in the same location the team have played in since 1899. Planning for a capacity of 61,000 seats 1,000 more than Arsenal at the Emirates at 60,000 is a hilarious tactic.\n\nThis weekend is the final weekend in the Bundesliga until Friday January 22 as the league takes it’s winter break. La Liga take only a ten day break over Christmas this year with the European Championships in mind. All leaving the way clear for the Premier League to dominate with the traditional heavy Christmas and the New Year schedule. Clearly this is one of its big attractions globally and one of the reasons why it stands out as the leader attracting the richest TV deals at £8.5 billion.\n\nIreland’s European Championship group will of course be tough. In a way I think it matters little who a team draws the attitude has to be more or less the same to be ready to give everything over the three games in nine days. Chris Coleman made it very clear before the draw that he did not want to draw England which he really did not need to say and of course Wales drew England. Aaron Ramsey attempted to restore some fight saying he was excited and looking forward to taking them on. All teams at the tournament will share €301 million with the winners collecting €27 million, up from €23.5 million in 2012.\n\nDundalk’s league, FAI cup and European performances along with UCD, Sheriff YC and Ireland Regions Cup team all making history and Ireland’s play off performances stand out as my Irish inspiring footballing moments this year.\n\nThe league of Ireland launching the u-17 and u-19 leagues has now made a very clear path for the abundant of talented young kids we always have produced which will hopefully help guiding more players at the crucial ages between 14 to 17 into a more enjoyable and fruitful footballing experience in Ireland.\n\nDundalk’s consistent high level performances were a pleasure to watch. Many have said their fitness levels and condition were at the highest level aided by Graham Byrne the team’s strength and conditioning coach. The hunger and desire to play well and to reach high performances was very clear to see and it was extremely attractive. The stat in their league win in 2014 of using 15 starters all season, a goalkeeper who played ever game and three outfield substitutes continued into 2015 and came across as such a clear and positive footballing signal. The Champions League performance was almost enough to get bast BATE Borisov who then entered Group E with Barcelona, AS Roma and Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nHaving the games more available on Setanta Sports and RTE has also been a big plus for the SSE Airtricity League. Seeing Bohemians performance against Shamrock Rovers in Dalymount on June 12 was inspiring. The crowd were truly exhilarated by the spirit of the performance and the feeling was infectious clearly all the way to the viewer at home, a brilliant summer football game in the top 5 games I have seen all year. The ‘Copa90’ 10 minute documentary covering this derby was superb. The ‘TrackChamp’ agreement to offer every SSE Airtricity League game streamed online, if easily accessible, from an Irish football supporter’s view, is good news.\n\nIn that category of 5 was definitely the home play off performance by Ireland against Bosnia. Personally I did not enjoy the home German victory as much as how everyone else afterwards seemed to. I felt we were completely dominated that day, it was quite uncomfortable and came away with a shock result which was clearly a massive boost. There have been many slow, cold, quiet loyal nights in the Aviva stadium over the last ten years but my thought was that the 2-0 victory over Bosnia was the best night I have experienced there, atmosphere, importance, performance, confidence and one of the first European stadium games after the chaos in Paris three nights previous.\n\nThe UEFA Play-off format was particular good viewing with highly important games being shown on TV each night particularly including two excellent ties between Denmark and Sweden as well as Hungary and Norway. Northern Ireland, Wales and England all qualifying too will make for more interesting viewing for Premier League and Irish supporters.\n\nIn Waterford Ireland u-21s beat Lithuania 3-0 in October. The performance was great and it was live on Setanta Sports and with a large attendance. Josh Cullen at West Ham, Callum O’Dowda at Oxford, Jack Byrne at SC Cambuur, Conor Wilkinson at Barnsley, Jack Connors at Dagenham and Redbridge, Tommie Hoban at Watford, Alan Browne at Preston, Lenihan, Griffin, Browne, Kavanagh, Grego-Cox, Connolly, Rea and Rogers have looked like very good performers from the games I have seen. It is a tough group with Italy, Serbia and Slovenia in contention with games resuming in March. Ireland u17 qualified for their EURO Elite group in Poland next year.\n\nUCD made extraordinary history in their European games. Excellent to see the Bowl so full and all attention on the club and team. The relegation-promotion playoffs at the end of the season saw a clear impressive burst of support in Limerick F.C. and Donegal for Finn Harps. It was very pleasing also to see an old team mate James Chambers in the League’s team of the Year.\n\nSheriff Y.C. reaching the Irish Daily Mail FAI Cup quarter final was brilliant endorsement of Junior football in Ireland which many are of the opinion that contains a large portion of the best talent that appeared at schoolboy ages. Junior football has always served as the most convenient footballing outlet and choice for many beside work commitments and being close to family. Liffey Wanderers won the FAI Junior Cup in extra time getting past Sheriff Y.C. in the exciting final.\n\nThe victory in the UEFA Regions Cup was another big positive moment for Irish football this year. Achieving a UEFA trophy for Ireland created a special sight and celebration in Tallaght Stadium on July 4.\n\nThe Womens’ World Cup in Canada was a very enjoyable watch in June, a competitive and entertaining tournament. England progressing to the semi-final attracted all the media’s attention, with USA and Germany reaching the semi-finals with Japan, made for positive news for all of Europe with two UEFA teams half of the final four teams. Ireland players Niamh Fahey, a 2015 FA Women’s Super League winner, 2015 SSE Women’s FA Cup winner, last 16 finalist of UEFA’s 2015 Women’s Champions League with Chelsea, and Emma Byrne, Arsenal Ladies goalkeeper and Eurosport analyst, will no doubt benefit from the excitement and competing among the English ladies and league since their return. Irish player Megan Connolly playing with Florida State University was named a First-Team All-American for 2015 by the National Soccer Coaches Association in December, an outstanding achievement and also as a freshman.\n\nIreland Women’s team achieved a superb 2-1 victory away to Portugal in their EURO 2017 qualifier. Setanta Sports having showed the two home fixtures versus Finland and Spain is an all round positive development and brings the Women’s game onto a par with all other footballing TV options. It was just announced Ireland will face World Champions USA on January 23 in San Diego.\n\nFormer Women’s football player Katie Taylor achieved gold at the Baku games in June. Former player Mary Waldron also made history qualifying this month for the Women’s Cricket World Cup in India.\n\nThe Women’s FAI Continental Tyres Senior Cup was won on penalties by Wexford Youths over Shelbourne in another exciting game in the Aviva Stadium in November. Willie Doyle, Wexford’s coach is making great progress with his team and they are proving to be very hard to beat and impressed in their league win over UCD Waves in Wayside Celtic I was at in September. It was also exciting to see the fourth official, my sister Deirdre, on Cup Final duty for her second year. A further great development was the amalgamation of Raheny with Shelbourne F.C that is a positive move which strengthens players and brings more excitement to Tolka Park and Shelbourne F.C.\n\nThis week saw the floods hit Ireland through Storm Desmond and in Cumbria towns were severely damaged. How great it was to see Irish player Gary Dicker, playing with Carlisle United, help out with his teammates, all those who needed assistance around the area of Carlisle.\n\nThe Irish Defence Forces team defeated England 4-1 in St.George’s Park with an excellent old team mate Keith Arnold an important part of the team. The Irish Paralympic team are beginning their road to Rio after finishing 6th in Cerebral Palsy World Cup in June. The Irish Amputee Football Association ran a FootGolf Classic in September and came second at the Podhale Amp Futbol Cup in Poland after defeating Netherlands and Ukraine. The FIFA Futsal World Cup is taking place this month without Ireland but the interest and participation of the game is attracting players. The World Student games took place in Korea this July with the Men’s team finishing 5th and the Women’s team 13th.\n\nThis winter I have enrolled on six FAI Coach Education Courses, Kick Start 1 and 2, a Strength and Conditioning workshop, 4×4 workshop, 7×7 workshop and the Youth Certificate. All have been very enjoyable, full of information and given by very good tutors Ian Hill, Jamie Wilson, Paul Whelan, Harry McCue, Johnny Morris Burke and Nigel Keady. It was also great to get a month of training with UCD’s Leinster Senior League squad in September with Diarmuid McNally and Tony Sheridan with the team doing well in the top division. At the end of the summer I spoke with two clubs about Performance Analysis Positions, one at Wolverhampton Wanderers in conjunction with a Masters course at Worcester University and the second was with Birmingham City F.C although didn’t work out but it is an interesting area and one that seems to be growing for Football Clubs. I am continuing to work with people in Madrid online, continuing to use DCU and UCD through alumni access and considering more teaching in Dublin in the new year and ideas for football related language work in the future with Spanish, Italian, French players in Spain and England.\n\ntwitter.com/2brianking\n\nfacebook.com/brian.king.3950\n\nIn my Leaving Certificate year, my father Noel became manager of Finn Harps in 2003, I was 17. Obviously a big distraction from studying for me as I shared a passion for football and League of Ireland football, but it was a dream distraction.\n\nDespite three and a half hours car time to get to Ballybofey or Finn Valley for either training or a match day, a twice weekly commitment as a schoolboy with Stella Maris FC with a game at the weekend and also Leaving Certificate commitments the biggest thrill for me at that time was Finn Harps.\n\nMy first visit to Ballybofey was with Shelbourne when Noel was coaching there in the 2001/02 season. It was an FAI Cup third round game and Harps won 2-1 on a cold January night in 2002. Shelbourne had been in good form that year and many of their players such as Richie and Dessie Baker, Jim Gannon, Steve Williams, Davy Byrne, Jim Crawford, Pat Fenlon, Peter Hutton, Tony Mc Carthy, Stephen Geoghegan and Owen Heary were top performers in the League over those seasons. I would have been 16, familiar with many of the Dublin League of Ireland venues but I remember the noise, the large crowd, the packed shed, the superb atmosphere, a tense but exciting game and the spectacular winning goal by Kevin McHugh to give the win to Harps and an ecstatic reaction. I knew then that football and Finn Harps was a special combination.\n\nIn 2003 when Noel joined, some of the squad consisted of Jonathan Minnock, Paddy McGrenaghan, Damien Whitehead, Shane Bradley, Declan Boyle, Donal O’Brien, Tom Mohan, Kevin McHugh, Shaun McGowan, Chris Breen, Niall Bonner, Eloka Asokuh, Trevor Scanlon, James Gallagher and Gary Crossan. An impressive group of players and during that season I remember clearly Minnock’s ease and talent on the ball, Paddy McGrenaghan’s dangerous runs with the ball down the wing, Niall Bonner’s speed on the other side, the solid partnership of Shane Bradley and Declan Boyle at centre back, Donal O’Brien dominating midfield with the perfect partner Tom Mohan driving forward and inspiring, Damian Whitehead’s goals, Kevin Mc Hugh’s incredible goals and performances, Eloka’s athleticism and Chris Breen and Shaun McGowan breaking into the team. A strong group, physical, fit, determined and competitive senior men many over 6ft. As well as a great group, Sean McGowan senior, Terrence and Mickey McGlynn created a great spirit and it was a pleasure to be around Finn Park and the squad then.As was common when I was able to travel with Noel, he would put me into the training and I remember some tough but enjoyable games and sessions with this group, tough tackling and very sharp 5 a sides in Finn Valley or on Finn Park itself.\n\nThe climax of that 2003 season was unforgettable. A tough play off system really tests the mentality of players, the club and supporters because there is so much to play for and usually all teams involved are totally committed to win whatever it takes. Finn Harps played Bray in the semi-final 1st leg winning one nil and then pushing on to win 2-1 in a tense Carlisle Ground with minds then focusing immediately on the other tie and the play off final with Derry City who defeated Limerick. At this point with both clubs with no second chance, everything was on the line for this final. This inevitably produced a great buildup in Donegal, in Derry and for League of Ireland followers.\n\nMy memory of the first tie in Ballybofey was seeing one of the largest crowds there, it was cagey knowing there was another day to play, Finn Harps were happy they performed very well while Derry were happy to go into the second game 0-0. The second leg obviously had a final feeling to it. There was no going back and the winner would take their position in the Premier Division. I remember a focused group then, avoiding as much as possible the excitement outside. Derry took a 1-0 lead but the equalizing goal by Kevin McHugh was sensational. First it was of the highest importance to bring Finn Harps back into the game, second it was an impulsive precise strike and third it was at the most critical moment. I remember the reaction in the ground, Derry supporters obviously gutted that the game would not finish 1-0 and the Finn Harps supporters euphoric. Extra time was a bit desperate, both sides drained but daring to try to win. A goal came from Liam Coyle that brought Derry securely to their Premier Division position. It was a romantic footballing year, one that put my Leaving Certificate worries to one side and saw a club and team gather momentum, support from its county and climax with every effort given consistently with the last kick of the ball.\n\nThe following season Noel began with the team, the massive weekly travel commitment, three to four times return, was not going to be good for anybody and the team continued without Noel wining the division and guaranteeing their position in the Premier Division for the following season. It was in early pre season of Noel’s last year when I was thrown onto the pitch late as a substitute, against Shelbourne in Oriel Park, in a friendly to make a somewhat official Senior debut. I was proud of course, got one or two touches of the ball but a footnote in a romantic footballing season.\n\nBrian King\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/2brianking\n\n(Photo: http://www.donegalnews.com)\n\nI was fortunate to play a few times in the famous Brandywell ground. On the first few occasions it would have been for UCD, clear underdogs every time and when Derry were in good form you could certainly feel the danger they posed, the second batch of games would have been as a Drogheda United player.\n\nAlways Derry’s support was strong. In The Belfield Bowl, the atmosphere would be among the top two or three noisiest and most passionate games there per season, despite the distance supporters had to travel. At United Park, Drogheda’s equally keen support would make for great nights when Derry visited. Derry always had players in their squad with talented reputations and over a five year period of games I came up against them, dominant players were Ciarán Martyn, Clive Delaney, Eddie McCallion, Patrick Jennings, Steven Gray, Peter Hutton, Barry Molloy, Kevin Deery, Ruairi Higgins, Paddy McCourt, Kevin McHugh, Niall McGinn and Mark Farren, a great recognition to play against. In this period Stephen Kenny was in charge from the end of 2007 to the end of 2011 and you knew your game would have to be high to compete against them.\n\nThe noise and the commitment from the fans in Brandywell was obvious and as a result it was exciting and a pleasure to play there. My father Noel played for and managed the club from 1985 to 1987 a period in which I was born in the Altnegalvin in 1986 so clearly it was a club I was always aware of, making it extra special when I had the opportunity to play there competitively.\n\nFriday July 10 would certainly be my personal highlight of games against Derry. We, Drogheda, traveled up to The Brandywell needing results as we were in a battle among the bottom four or five teams, it was a tough game but fortunately we stayed in the game, did well and in the 88th minute I finished an opportunity that came to me 8 yards out from a cross, that we went on to win. Noel I think was away with an FAI team for that game but he would have found out the result and how it went after the game. It was great of course to have that memory and it is one of my fondest given the connections and that we needed it as a team.\n\nRecently there have been proud nights for the league when Derry competed against Paris Saint Germain, Gretna and Goteborg, great FAI Cup runs and the continued attacking style that has been demanded.\n\nIn another League of Ireland twist it was the relegation-promotion play off in 2003 which was memorable. I was fortunate to see the return leg in The Brandywell from the bench, I was 15, I was not on any of the official documents allowing me a place on the bench and it was clear on an intense night like that, this issue was brought up and I was asked to leave and go among the large home support. Noel, though, sensing the fierce mood behind in the old ‘jungle’ was able to work it out with the fourth official, clearly keeping my head down thereafter. The two legs were superb occasions, two neighboring teams having the opportunity to compete for a significant prize and both teams containing senior men and established players really committed combined with the two sets of fans to make it a special tie, appropriate then that Liam Coyle found the winning goal in extra time.\n\nWith luck I will get to a game in The Brandywell to experience the ground on a match day and sitting in the famous stand to watch a game would bring full circle many experiences I have been lucky to have there as a younger lad and then as an opposition player. It’s good to see Peter Hutton responsible for the team now and hopefully all will go well for him, the team, the club and for the supporters.\n\nBrian King\n\ntwitter.com/2brianking.\n\nWhile spending time training with Stockport County in the winter of 2008 I had a phone call with Alan Matthews which subsequently brought me to Drogheda as a player for the following season. I knew Alan from when I was 15 or 16 training with Shelbourne and I was exciting to join him and the players he had gathered and was proud knowing I would be playing with Drogheda one of the leagues most established and well known clubs. I had just finished three seasons with UCD, had a further great experience training with Hamilton Academical with an ex Drogheda United player Stuart Taylor, then assistant at Hamilton Academical, now working with Aston Villa’s reserve team and it felt like the right commitment to make.\n\nMy first trip to United Park would have been with my father Noel in 1998 when he was coaching at UCD, I was 12 and a match threatening fog was on the pitch before the game. Stronger memories exist from the 2002 period with Harry McCue as manager when Noel also was involved coaching for a stint. Training with some of the lads took place in ALSAA near to Dublin Airport on dark winter evenings but then later full time training in St.Joseph’s School for the deaf on the Navan Road in Dublin with lads such as Gary Rogers, Danny O’Connor, Brian Kelly, Gary Cronin, Don Tierney, Declan O’Brien, Robbie Dunne, Mark Quinless, Steven Gray, Chris Todd, Pat Scully, Aidan Lynch, Mark Dempsey, Stuart Taylor, Andy Myler and Ciaran Quinn.\n\nIt was this season that saw one of the most dramatic relegation-promotion play offs in recent League of Ireland times. Galway United came to United Park for the second leg with a two goal advantage but Drogheda are today the only team to have turned around a two goal deficit in this play off game when they won 3-2 on a dramatic and thrilling night. I watched with Noel from the stand and I remember such an excited atmosphere particularly as the game became most intense during extra time.\n\nIt was with this backdrop that gave me definite pride and honour personally playing for Drogheda United in 2009. We got together at United Park on one of our first nights and I with a new dressing room, including Ian Ryan, Gavin Whelan, Alan McNally, Conor Kenna, James Chambers, Guy Bates, Shane Barrett, Eric McGill, Jamie Duffy, Robbie Martin, Brendan McGill, Paul Skinner, Robbie Clarke, Eoghan Osborne, Paul Crowley, Paul Shields, Robbie Farrell, and Steve Williams. We had a tough task coming together late and we fought in a relegation battle, but we created a great bond from the beginning and along with a positive atmosphere in the dressing room I think that was the reason we came through a relegation-promotion play-off against Bray 2-0.\n\nTraining was good with Alan Matthews, Barry O’Connor, Seamus Kelly and with superb staff Jacko Smith, Danny Miller, Damien Kavanagh, Locky and Celine we had everything we needed and a great team. Our training bases were between Mosney in Julianstown and Westmanstown Sports Centre Dublin 15. The second season saw a few player changes but unfortunately we could not push ourselves up in the table after setting that as our goal.\n\nMy final appearance with the club was Friday May 14 2010 away in Sligo unfortunately we went down 6-0 and I think it confirmed that we could just not make progress which happens in football. In that game I received a red card just before half time, the only one I received including schoolboy days so personally I knew something wasn’t right. That season I had begun a job demanding an early 4am start, so combined with evening travelling to either Westmanstown or Julianstown to train as well as a Friday fixture and Sunday training it soon became clear it was too much. On the Monday after our Sligo defeat I made a call to Alan, explained my situation and said I needed to stop, I called the team captain Alan McNally shortly after and the Robbie Martin. It is something I wanted to do, I had been enjoying the work I was doing and I saw it as a new adventure and commitment.\n\nI consequently had the opportunity that September to travel with Noel as his under 17 Women’s team in FIFA’s U-17 World Cup in Trinidad and Tobago, followed by an opportunity to spend time in Atlanta, GA to do some coaching returning to do a Masters course in DCU graduating in 2013. After that I had the opportunity to work in and experience Madrid for two years which was beneficial in many aspects including a great opportunity to see Spanish people’s relationship with football, how it is part of their lives and the phenomenal rivalry between Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid that year culminating in the Champions League Final in Lisbon I traveled to and was fortunate to attend.\n\nIt has also been great to see Noel do well with the Ireland u-21 team, his time with the Senior team in Cologne in 2013 and in Dublin and now the current u-21 campaign. It has been great to get to and watch games with him. It has also been great to follow Drogheda since then, their cup successes and now the new positive era with John McDonnell. I would like to wish the current team very well, the club, staff and the fans. As well as former players and staff I would have played and worked with from 2009 to 2010 and to thank them, wish them well and good luck including the great support Drogheda United has.\n\nBrian King\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/2brianking\n\nIt was exciting to get the message from Kevin Doyle a few months before Christmas about the reunion event he and Michael Savage were behind organizing. The reunion of the Féile team of 2000.\n\nAt that time, it would have been my final year with the team as I then focused fully on playing football with my schoolboy club Stella Maris as combining the two at that age becomes nonsensical.\n\nSo the group had obviously had a few more years of memories battling together which was evident on the reunion day with Tiernan recounting a story to me that came to him from an u-16 game when a brawl broke out for the sake of defending a team mate who had been picked on.\n\nThe day was fantastic, December 27, 2014, certainly a sluggish day so close to the holidays and a bit difficult to get going for the actually game itself, as you never know what can happen in the heat of a game or how physical or competitive it might get but luckily it was a good run out.\n\nIt was a thrill to walk up to St.Vincent’s to meet for a game again and from the very beginning it was exciting to see Ian Fleming and Eamonn Byrne, both I hadn’t seen since 2000. After that, Rory Carolan, Éanna O’Malley, Michael and Kevin, Peter Woods, Rory Conlon, Declan Manning, Willie Lowry, Tony and Tiernan Diamond and brothers, Michael Leonard, followed by Stephen Loughlin, Cilian Murphy, Keith Connolly, Mark Slattery, Barry Reynolds, Stephen Groome, John Carroll and Brendan Canning. A lot of the lads I had gone to school with both in Scoil Mhuire and then in Ard Scoil Rís and almost all I had not seen since then.\n\nThe atmosphere and environment in St.Vincent’s was always friendly and superb and on this day too there was a great spirit. We got down to business, the team was named, the gear put on and out we went. A handful of us had not played Gaelic Football for 10 years or so, my last game would have been in 2004 at secondary school. You could tell, it was a bit tricky to get the hang of it again and Mr Leonard certainly spotted something from the sideline noting an obvious soccer player’s stance I had when kicking the ball, thanks Mick. You could see some of the lads were playing great but I think the talent was there from all, underneath, but the levels of rustiness and fitness were clearly mixed. It was a thrill to see Ollie Cahill on the pitch, he was flying fit but unfortunately on the opposition that day, a great League of Ireland football player and who looked out for me when we trained together at Shelbourne in 2005. It was also great to see my father Noel and brother Ciarán, now also playing with the club, come to see some of the action.\n\nThe reunion was a great idea, the best opportunity to catch up with all and after quite a bit of time without being around each other it was encouraging to get on great with everyone.\n\nIt has been admirable the success the St.Vincent’s teams have achieved over the last years. I have felt really great seeing this and the influence Diarmuid Connolly, Michael and Tiernan have had on the Dublin team but equally on this reunion day learning how the lads in this group have been, their stories, adventures and what they are doing has been motivating and encouraging and I wish everyone well and more luck.\n\nAt UCD AFC as a player over three years Dave Billings would have been in the Sports Centre, it was during the summer camps I became friendly with Neal who also worked on them and it is reassuring and heartening to see so many people say supportive and warm words over the last days and I would like to wish Neal, his family and the club well.\n\nMy sisters Louise, now 34, Deirdre, 33, Noel, father, and Maria, mother, were all involved in setting up a girls team St. Brendan’s playing out of McAuley Park in Dublin 5 probably close to 1993. I would have been 7 or 8 and this would be a big part of our lives and routines for the next years.\n\nAlong with friends from the beginning Fiona O’Rurke, Ciara Mc Kinney and Kim Fitzsimmons, Louise and Deirdre set about putting a team together. Over the years great memories were created, great success also and the team was a platform for excellent talent that came through achieving many individual representation honors, some of the team progressing to earn International appearances and it was a good focus for many.\n\nSonya Hughes was superb, she had the ability to score free kicks almost from the half way line, she was an intelligent footballer confident and secure passer, reliable and played in so many of the games. Michelle and Angelina Walsh were adept and strong players, Joyce Lloyd was a skilled left footed player, Leanne Bowler regularly traveled from Meath usually getting many goals and Emma Merrigan was a dependable goalkeeper for Ireland too.\n\nIt became a great social and positive past time for all, away trips to Belmullet were memorable for the distance but were among the most important All-Ireland and competitive games I can remember at that time. Regular, long, traffic-mad car journeys to the DWSL in Celbridge with player registration forms were not as fun though as a young back seat passenger. A trip to The Gaynor Cup, the University of Limerick, Indoor training in St. Brendan’s school, the hall in Glin Road, the collection of subs, the organizing, washing an preparing the kit were weekly housekeeping issues, while me, my sister Niamh and players’ younger siblings would be there always helping, playing and good bonds were formed.\n\nThe ultimate trip for the group took place in 1998 to Atlanta, Georgia for 10 days. A thanksgiving tournament, trips to Coca Cola, CNN, the Olympic Stadium and stays in host families. An opportunity that put me in contact with Patrick, an Atlantan of my age, a talented footballer, he was invited as a youth to spend time at Borussia Dortmund and Ajax, he guest appeared with my schoolboy team Stella Maris at the Foyle Cup, I guested with his team a year later. I have returned to stay on four or five occasions since and was part of his groom’s party for his wedding last year.\n\nLouise went on to play a game for Ireland and it was a great day and memory traveling to Belfast to see her on the pitch. The St.Brendan’s process over time saw Noel become more involved in Women’s football. During those years he would have been playing and coaching for Limerick City and likewise there were superb trips and memories as I was fortunate to go with him on many occasions, late train trips, car journeys and Rathbane. I remember one of his first training sessions with the women’s International group, in The Marino Institute of Education and quite soon as I was accustomed to as a 12 or 13 year old I was allowed do some of the training which I continued when I would accompany Noel, at Limerick, later at Finn Harps, UCD and at Shelbourne. It was great to always have been involved. Emma Byrne, Yvonne Tracy, Sonya, Ciara Grant, Maragret Saurin, Claire Scanlan, Elaine O’Connor, Caroline Thorpe, Michelle Kane, Olivia O’Toole, Sharon Boyle all the team over the years looked out for me. Sean Brodie, Frances Smith, Pauline Shaughnessy, Myles Kelly and Declan Hughes over the years also went out of their way for me.\n\nTraining at the AUL, a game in Reykjavik, a tour of old Highbury and the famous old entrance thanks to the Irish trio who were there, match days in Richmond Park, Belfield and later with the underage teams witnessing a FIFA underage World Cup in Trinidad and Tobago where Ciara Grant, Denise O’Sullivan, Shiobhan Killeen, Megan Campbell, Grace Maloney and Dora Gorman have now gone on to be Senior players, seeing Kate Taylor’s career and success develop, were all excellent memories I have had.\n\nInvolved in coaching one of the first Stella Maris girls teams was new and an enjoyable time when I was a bit older at 18, as Stella Maris was my schoolboy club. Tony Poutch, Tom Kavanagh, Thomas McGillivary all were involved and great talented players appeared, Aine O’Gorman now regularly playing for the Senior Ireland team.\n\nLike all of the footballing projects I have been brought up in, Stella Maris, Shelbourne, Finn Harps, Limerick, UCD, women’s football, St. Brendans and the Ireland Women’s panel have all produced many positive times, memories and opportunities for me, for Louise who keeps an interest and coached at Home Farm last year in a new girls development there, for Deirdre who has progressed in a refereeing role, follows the WNL, and for Niamh who grew in a similar surrounding enjoying the Stella Maris girls unit.\n\nThe journey continues and we have all been behind Noel in Cologne in 2014 and now for the Under 21 campaign. It was great to see the Women’s Cup Final in the Aviva Stadium and televised, I watched and enjoyed and it was superb to listen to Emma Byrne in the studio. It is also positive and encouraging to see Sue Ronan’s teams currently doing very well, Dave Connell’s great success with his teams, Rahen’y United’s success in Europe, the wider media interest for Stephanie Roche, the Irish girls performing in the FA’s Women’s Super League and in general the improved and growing position of female athletes and women’s sport.\n\n© Brian King T/A Ad Meliora\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/2brianking\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/1admeliora\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/admeliora1\n\nhttp://www.admelioraingles.com\n\nAs a Stella Maris schoolboy, growing up near to Drumcondra, Shelbourne have always been the local team. I would have seen occasional action there with Noel my father catching a second half but I was fortunate to have greater access and exposure to the team and club when Noel began to coach with Dermot Keely in 2001 and 2002.\n\nTraining was in Sportslink on midweek nights and there were occasions in Rosmini when it was full time training. I was 15 and it was a thrill to be among senior footballers, in that environment and I was regularly allowed to do some training.\n\nMick Neville looked after me many times, his under 21 team usually trained next to the first team in Sportslink so training with his players was also exciting. In the first team group there was Stephen Geoghegan, Dessie Baker, Declan Geoghegan, Tony Mc Carthy, Kevin Doherty, Owen Heary, Steve Williams, Richie Baker, Jim Crawford Pat Fenlon, Pat Scully, Davy Byrne, Jim Gannon and Wes Hoolahan. It was fast and competitive and the spirit was great with kitman Andy Byrne, physio Larry Byrne, Fred Davis and Dermot there. Summer football hadn’t arrived just yet and I remember well a snowy and cold morning training on Stephen’s Day obviously an old ritual current players are missing out on but there was a good spirit and sense of unity on those types of days.\n\nWhen full time training and in Rosmini, using the Tolka Park facilities as a base from my view was memorable. The narrow hallways from the referee’s room used by the coaches to the main changing rooms, the upstairs space and the large room and space downstairs only occupied by players and staff on training days gave a sense of exclusivity and perhaps a treat for footballers.\n\nOn match days there was an elevated sense was of importance, a serious calm before the storm, you knew the public and supporters were coming to the ground in an hour so there was no room for anything other than commitment. I enjoyed and tried to help in any way, the kit or any small job that there might be. At Limerick with Noel, and at UCD I was acquainted with this role. Closer to kick off I would be in the stand usually with a programme, drink and sweets from the dressing room and when Noel was watching from the stand too it was great. I remember a day in Dalymount Shels going 3-0 up very early against Bohemians with a sense of ‘that is it’, the team were never going to let Bohs back into it.\n\nIt was a privilege as a young schoolboy footballer to have such access and I have great memories of that group, and fondly remember simple moments, noting the sheer size of Kevin Doherty as he was walking down the stairs while I was standing there, Richie Baker presenting me with a pair of his boots on the bus returning from Ballybofey, the buzz of going into the dressing room at the end of games, overall it was a great group and I was treated great.\n\nIt was a few years later I would join the club as an Under 21 player with Frank O’Neill. Malcolm Slattery was club kitman and Mick was involved in the first team with Pat Fenlon. This period was the season of the Deportivo La Coruña game and full time training in Blanchardstown IT and in Rosmini. There were some player changes but Kevin, Jim, Owen, Steve Williams, Richie and Dessie, Tony Mc Carthy and Wes were there and some additions were Glen Crowe, David Crawley, Joseph Ndo, Ollie Cahill, Alan Cawley, Dave Rogers, Curtis Fleming, Ger Rowe, Gary O’Neill, Alan Moore, Jamie Harris and I was along with James Chambers, David Tyrell and Gary Deegan as the young quartet with Eamonn Collins creating dynamic sessions.\n\nIt was another great time for me and there was a significant atmosphere and feeling around that year everyone appreciating the level they were reaching. I had a university commitment doing a Bachelor’s degree (BA) in UCD which at times was a distraction and I was unable to commit as much as the other lads. I did have one opportunity to be on the bench at home to Finn Harps I was told by Pat but on the day I was struck with an aura migraine that brought me nowhere but my sick bed.\n\nPat gave importance to studying and there was a period that he tried to secure funding for university costs, scholarship fees, and he encouraged me and was a good supporter of me in what I was doing. Along with Gary we both joined Kilkenny for a season on loan. Gary continued training full time with Shelbourne and I freed up a lot more of my time to concentrate on the BA.\n\nI subsequently joined UCD AFC the following year. I had 2 great developing years there, another season and a half a Drogheda with Alan Matthews who had been with Shelbourne in 2001 with Dermot and Noel. That was an enjoyable period then decided to step back from a playing commitment as often players here do, continued studying achieving a Masters Degree (MA) in DCU then set up a small business teaching which brought me to Madrid for two years where I was able to follow two of last years best teams in Europe, Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid, finishing in a trip to Lisbon to attend the final, a satisfying two year footballing experience.\n\nIt is great to see Kevin Doherty now responsible for the first team. I wish him well because it is his first senor managing position and he has a long connection with Shelbourne so it will be extra important for him. Passing by Richmond Road the week before the start of this season, it was nice to see the ground being painted and you could sense some excitement. Good luck to Kevin.\n\n© Brian King T/A Ad Meliora\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/1admeliora\n\nhttp://www.admelioraingles.com\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/admeliora1\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/2brianking\n\nMy connection with UCD goes back to 1997/1998. Among the team of Jason Sherlock, Tony Mc Donnell, Robbie Mc Auley and co I was thrown. That team, for ‘the college’ enthusiasts who remember, included Ken Kilmurray, Ciarán Kavanagh, Mick O’Byrne, Robbie Dunne, Mick O’Donnell, Eoin Bennis, John Martin, Séamus Kelly, Wayne Fitzgerald, Clive Delaney, Ciarán Martyn. As well as being with the players, I remember the presence of Dr.Tony O’Neill, Theo Dunne, Alan O’Neill and kit man Larry Quinn.\n\nI would have been 11 and 12 at this time and it was with huge excitement I would be brought by my father Noel to the training sessions and to almost all of the match days. I had special access as a 12 year old, eager to collect the footballs, get the water for the lads and just delighted to be around, practicing free kicks on the hallowed Belfield Park pitch before and after games.\n\nThat period was special for me, the group treated me extremely well, I remember been given a pair of Dublin GAA shorts by Jason Sherlock on one occasion travelling on the team bus to an away game. I remember the long trip to Turner’s Cross which resulted in a 2-1 win. I also remember a miserable day losing 5-1 in Belfield. I remember the talent of the players, Ken Kilmurray’s strength, skill and ability, Ciáran Martyn’s midfield presence, runs and knack of scoring, Mick O’Byrne threat, formidable Séamus Kelly in goal and Clive Delaney in defence. Robbie McAuley and Mick O’Donnel’s left feet, Eoin Bennis’ speed, John Martyn’s dribbling and attacking. It was an exciting team, even thinking now after playing some years myself, that team had really great talent. I think Ken Kilmurray, Eoin Bennis and obviously Jason went on to be strong GAA performers. It was with great excitement and feeling of involvement that I was usually watching these lads play from the privileged position on the team bench, at the age of 12.\n\nAs is the nature of League of Ireland football, it is common for high seasonal changes of players and of your club so this was a precious experience at Belfield which gave massive importance to me when I returned to play for UCD at the age of 18.\n\nFrom Belfield in 1998 my journey obviously co-related with Noel’s which gave me similar precious experiences at Finn Harps, at Shelbourne and for some years with Ireland’s womens team all packed with superb memories and times.\n\nSo it was with great preparation when I began a competitive career myself. My schoolboy days were with Stella Maris, playing alongside Joe O’Brien (now West Ham United), Shaun Williams (now Milwall), Patrick Cregg (now Shamrock Rovers), David Elebert (ex Hamilton Academical, now Glenavon) and many other players who had superb talent and subsequently found other opportunities ahead of pursuing a football career. Our league contained Stephen Quinn (now Hull City), Gary Dicker (now Carlisle United), Paul Mc Shane (now Hull City), Andy Keogh (now Perth Glory) and again many other talented players so it was a competitive schoolboy experience and packed with excellent memories.\n\nThere were a few trips to English clubs, Leeds United (with Stephen Quinn and Shane Mc Faul -now KTP Finland), Manchester City (with Patrick Cregg) and Blackburn Rovers (with Gavin Peers -now Sligo Rovers and Eddie Nolan- now Scunthorpe) but after Stella Maris my trajectory took me to Shelbourne, with the Under 21 team and also among the first team squad training regularly with the full time group which contained Wes Hoolahan, Glen Crowe, Alan Moore, Ollie Cahill, Alan Cawley, Joseph Ndo, Richie and Dessie Baker, Jason Byrne and many others who were at the time by far the strongest group of players in the league, that competed against Deportivo La Coruña and Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League all of which was an exciting time to be involved with the club.\n\nLike anyone who has played football, it is with great interest and pride to see people you played with at any time, shared dressing rooms and time together, develop their careers, following and aware of all, in the case of many Irish players, developing careers and their lives in other professions and with many stories.\n\nA season loan was arranged for me to play with Kilkenny City at Buckley Park in the First Division along with Gary Deegan (now Southend United) who was also developing at Shelbourne full time at that time.\n\nAt 17 and having completed my Leaving Certificate, I entered UCD as an Arts student at the same time my footballing endeavors with Shelbourne and Kilkenny. It was a year of chaotic traveling, serious academic demands, an early morning to late night schedule, part time employment in a Champion Sports store and a League of Ireland season to play. A lifestyle that challenged me but probably with too many different paths, each beginning to rapidly develop on their own.\n\nIt was fortunate circumstances that saw me move to play for UCD AFC a year after I had entered the college separately. There was a large number of young guys at the club, there was the 1st team which contained players with more of a footballing career focus, an under 21 team with younger lads some away from their homes and combining study, usually Sports Management, with their football. There were also other teams, a Leinster Senior League team with lads usually studying more diverse subjects and focused on that and other professional areas, it was a mixed group but there was a large number of guys always around the Sports Centre in UCD and it was a interesting place to be.\n\nIt was probably this diversity that created other opportunities, other possible career paths and opened other avenues, ahead of a football career mindset that existed more in hardened professional football environments such as Shelbourne at that time and other League of Ireland clubs with lads determined and committed to get a successful professional contract and an opportunity with a bigger club in a more intense league as we know many of which exist in England, namely Conference football, the three football leagues and the current pinnacle of professional football the Premier League.\n\nAn Arts degree is at odds perhaps with the intense determination, desperation described and needed pursuing a professional football life and this was a conflict for me. At the beginning I treated my studies with a little disregard, I experienced the perhaps common notion of passing exams as being the ambition, which I did on the most minimal of levels. It was exciting, I loved the big matches we had at UCD, a night match away in The Brandywell to Derry City or a night match away to Shamrock Rovers in Tolka Park, battling, fighting, competing, the atmosphere, were fulfilling nights and full of satisfaction. Concurrenty I was enjoying University life. I graduated and completed my degree and I also thrived in the High Performance Unit in UCD which educated all of us at the time about Sports Science with really superb mentors John Barrie, Kyle and Lisa.\n\nMy final games with UCD brought me an opportunity to train with Hamilton Academicals and Stockport County for periods after the end of our season. It felt good to have opportunities to try to develop my football career, it would clearly be seen as progress. They were really good experiences in both clubs. Both reflected a similar environment to Shelbourne with lads who professional football was there main commitment. I reunited with David Elebert, James Mc Carthy (now Everton) was at Hamilton at this time, James McArthur (now Crystal Palace) and Alex Neil, now Norwich City’s 33 year old high flying manager and Stockport possessed many well established football league players and I was also alongside Gary Dicker and Jim Gannon who was previously at Shelbourne.\n\nAt that time I spoke with Alan Matthews who was assembling his team at Drogheda and I decided to join. We had a great year in Drogheda, despite commuting three to four times a week to either United Park or training at the old ghost Mosney facility which is now a temporary home for refugees who have come to Ireland, or a Friday away trip, it was an enjoyable year. The atmosphere in my two years with Alan at Drogheda was always good, the lads were all comfortable with Alan and we were good with each other, however, we did not collect too many points, a relegation/promotion play off was by far the highlight winning 2-0 and I scored the second. The second season was fine, I was 23, I began working a job which had me rising at 3:00am 6 days a week, I loved the job, I knew I wasn’t going to commit to a full time football playing job at that time as they were also hard to find, unless you moved away. On the 14th of May 2014, in The Showgrounds away to Sligo Rovers, I got two bookings, sent off for my first time including as a schoolboy we were beaten 6-0, it was my last game, I knew it had been coming for months so it was the perfect clean break, I phoned Alan on Monday and subsequently he also had come to the end of his time at Drogheda later that day also and departed.\n\nFor me it was great, I concentrated on the job I was doing for the following months, I took an amazing trip to Trinidad and Tobago to support Noel’s team in the Under 17 Womens World Cup. I traveled onto an old friend in Atlanta Georgia for a few weeks, New York, Kansas City, Lyon, returned and completed a MA in DCU in International Relations, got a TEFL qualification, began teaching, traveled and lived in Madrid for two years, followed Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid in Atlético’s amazing league winning year, saw the party in the city and I made the trip to Lisbon for the final. So it has been positive and good and UCD has given me a lot through the University itself and also through my time at UCD AFC both have given me a great base. It was a also a great opportunity in October 2014 to travel to Cologne to support Ireland v Germany and see a one time UCD AFC coach Noel as Ireland coach that day supporting and with the same excitement and passion as the Belfield Park days in 1998.\n\n© Brian King T/A Ad Meliora\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/2brianking\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/1admeliora\n\nhttp://www.admelioraingles.com\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/admeliora1"
