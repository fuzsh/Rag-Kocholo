        "text": "Words alone cannot describe what it means to be a football fan.\n\nThe excitement, elation, and, well, the disappointment that engulfs us every single week makes travelling miles in the freezing cold to watch XI men in your colours so worth it - most of the time.\n\nOf course, clubs are nothing without their fans. Managers, players and everyone else associated with a team come and go. But that doesn't mean to say certain players don't make an impression on us during their time representing our clubs.\n\nBelow, the Mirror Football writers have taken a closer look at their own teams and come up with a 'living memory legends XI'.\n\nThe line-ups aren't necessarily an ultimate XI comprised of the greatest players to ever represent the club, rather an XI comprised of the players who have had the biggest impact on their lives. We're talking the match-winners, the fan favourites, the cult heroes and the players you cannot believe ever played for your club.\n\nSo without further ado, here are our footballing heroes.\n\nMatt Lawless - West Ham\n\nFirst XI: Green, Repka, R Ferdinand, Bilic, Dicks, Sinclair, Carrick, Lampard, J Cole, Di Canio, Tevez.\n\nSubs: Miklosko, Gabiddon, S Pearce, Nolan, Etherington, Ashton, C Cole.\n\nHang on. Where's Bonds, Brooking, Devonshire, Martin, Hurst... Christian Dailly? I've picked a team who made me fall in love with West Ham as a youngster.\n\nAll entertainers in their own right. All, in my opinion, among the finest to wear the claret and blue. Living 'legends'.\n\nMark Jones - Liverpool\n\nFirst XI: Reina, Babbel, Carragher, Hyypia, Riise, Mascherano, Alonso, Gerrard, McManaman, Torres, Fowler.\n\nSubs: Dudek, Finnan, Henchoz, Garcia, Kuyt, Owen, Suarez.\n\nThis side would obviously look a lot different had I been born a few years earlier, but despite this generation of Liverpool players not being as successful as those that went before them there's still some pretty special talents in there.\n\nGerard Houllier's 2000/01 side that won three trophies makes up the bulk of it, as that paved the way for the Champions League success in 2005 under Rafael Benitez.\n\nI'd say that those two could be joint managers, but then hasn't exactly worked for Liverpool in the past.\n\nThomas Bristow - Man United\n\nFirst XI: Schmeichel, G. Neville, Pallister, Bruce, Irwin, Beckham, Keane, Scholes, Giggs, Cantona, Rooney.\n\nSubs: Van der Sar, Vidic, Ferdinand, Van Nistelrooy, Ronaldo, Cole, Yorke.\n\nYou may deem some of the choices in here controversial but growing up these guys were heroes for me.\n\nSchmeichel with his save against Rapid Vienna, Irwin with his lung-busting runs up the left, Neville with his chips and runs, and Pallister and Bruce with their towering strength in defence.\n\nIt may not have been pretty or technically great, but these players built the foundations for the likes of Vidic, Ferdinand and Ronaldo.\n\nKeane was everything you could ask for in a captain and more while Beckham, Scholes and Giggs brought us the very best from the class of '92.\n\nCantona was capable of producing moments of undiluted magic while Rooney is United's all-time top goalscorer.\n\nIbrahim Mustapha - Arsenal\n\nFirst XI: Seaman, Dixon, Adams, Campbell, A Cole, Ljungberg, Vieira, Fabregas, Pires, Henry, Wright\n\nSubs: Lehmann, Winterburn, Toure, Gilberto, Merson, Bergkamp, Sanchez\n\nThat's a team of serial winners. A few of these maybe tarnish their 'legend' status because of how they left the club or are perceived in their respective post-Gunners careers.\n\nWhile at the club however, they all made significant contributions to varying successes and should be remembered - and lauded - for what they achieved with the Cannon on their chest.\n\nAaron Flanagan - Man City\n\nFirst XI: Weaver; Zabaleta, Kompany, Dunne; Horlock, Kinkladze, Bernarbia, Silva, Berkovic; Goater, Aguero\n\nSubs: Distin, Jihai, Richards, De Jong, Wright-Phillips, Dickov, Glauber Berti\n\nThere won't be many of my midfield five tracking back and helping out the defence, but it is composed of some of my favourite footballers of all time.\n\nGeorgi Kinkladze was my first true footballing icon, with the likes of Ali Bernarbia and Eyal Berkovic following in the years after.\n\nThere's a bit of representation for the 1999 play-off winning team in there, which was one of my favourite-ever football days, as I'm sure any Manchester City fan will agree with.\n\nDavid Silva is City's greatest-ever player and gets the nod for the team alongside other current players in Vincent Kompany and Sergio Aguero, who rightly have spots in City's history.\n\nOh, and 'The Invisible Man' Glauber Berti has to make the bench, of course.\n\nJack Rathborn - Chelsea\n\nFirst XI: Cech, Ivanovic, Carvalho, Terry, A Cole, Kante, Wise, Lampard, Zola, Hasselbaink, Drogba\n\nSubs: De Goey, Desailly, Bridge, Di Matteo, Essien, Makelele, Hazard\n\nWhen a club is fortunate enough to be taken over by a billionaire, naturally it distorts what a club's \"legends XI\" should look like, with the last decade's worth of talent likely exceeding that of the previous 100 years - including, perhaps, Gianfranco Zola.\n\nThe little magician works his way in due to the way he inspired sides, daring to pull of the spectacular and unconventional. Eden Hazard, for technique, can probably consider himself the Blues' most outstanding player, but behind Zola and in a diamond formation, he's squeezed out.\n\nJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink didn't achieve as much as Didier Drogba, but the pair's power and ruthless streak would have been fascinating to witness.\n\nClaude Makelele is nudged out of the XI by Dennis Wise for his leadership and legacy of winning titles long before the Russian money meant silverware was expected.\n\nThe last contentious call for me was N'Golo Kante on the right of a three, but his infectious personality puts him in already and as we are witnessing already, he has far more to his game than being merely a destroyer - a debate as to who was the superior midfielder between himself and Michael Essien could rumble on for days.\n\nConor Mummery - Tottenham\n\nFirst XI: Lloris, Walker, Alderweireld, King, Rose, Dembele, Modric, Bale, Eriksen, Ginola, Kane\n\nSubs: Robinson, Vertonghen, Lennon, Davids, Van der Vaart, Berbatov, Keane\n\nYou'll notice these are mostly current players, for one reason. Tottenham were s*** from 1992 until around 2004. We had a few shining lights in that time; Ginola, King, Keane.\n\nPochettino's current incarnate are by far the best Spurs side in the last quarter of a century, add the likes of Modric and Bale to that and any club will do well to better it.\n\nJon Livesey - Everton\n\nFirst XI: Southall, Coleman, Jagielka, Distin, Baines, Speed, Arteta, Pienaar, Kanchelskis, Cahill, Ferguson\n\nSubs: Martyn, Watson, Barry, Gravesen, Stuart, Rooney, Campbell\n\nCult heroes and great servants may capture hearts, but I prefer players with ability and impact. For that reason, the likes of Hibbert, Unsworth and Amokachi don't make the cut.\n\nArguably, Lukaku deserves a place up top, but Ferguson - a cult hero with ability and impact - was my hero growing up. Largely, it's a David Moyes team, with a few big-hitters from either side of the Scot's reign. What I wouldn't give to see players of this calibre in the royal blue now...\n\nLiam Prenderville - Leicester City\n\nFirst XI: Schmeichel, Elliott, Morgan, Walsh, Mahrez, Savage, Kante, Izzet, Guppy, Vardy, Heskey\n\nSubs: Keller, Fuchs, Taggart, Cambiasso, Lennon, Dickov, Marshall\n\nIt was hard not to go with all of the 2015 title winning side but club legends Steve Walsh, Matt Elliott, Muzzy Izzet and Emile Heskey can't be ignored.\n\nPlenty of skill and pace going forward with some real grafters in the middle of the park.\n\nJames Whaling - Sheffield Wednesday\n\nFirst XI: Bywater, Simek, Bullen, Llera, R Johnson, J Johnson, Semedo, Hutchinson, Brunt, Forestieri, Tudgay\n\nSubs: Weaver, Bougherra, McGovern, Whelan, Antonio, Hooper, Burton\n\nI've deliberately steered clear of the likes of Di Canio and Carbone and earlier Waddle and Hirst - wonderful players but ones I wasn't old enough to fully appreciate.\n\nInstead I've gone for those that have given me moments of pure, unadulterated joy in a largely miserable post-Premier League era at Hillsborough.\n\nIt's an eclectic mix of cult heroes such as Jose Semedo and Reda Johnson, coupled with some genuine quality in the likes of Chris Brunt and Fernando Forestieri.\n\nStephen Bywater just gets the nod in goal for pretending to have never heard of Sheffield United live on the radio. Sorry, Mark Crossley, but I did go ballistic at your equaliser against Southampton that time.\n\nJake Polden - Fulham\n\nFirst XI: Van der Sar, Finnan, Hangeland, Coleman, Brevett, Boa Morte, Murphy, Dembele, Dempsey, McBride, Saha\n\nSubs: Schwarzer, Morgan, Konchesky, Davis, Malbranque, Duff, Hayles\n\nMy Fulham team - for the most part - comprises the squads from the two greatest periods of my life as a fan: promotion from the old Division One in 2002 and our run to the Europa League final eights years later.\n\nTo think we had the likes of Steve Finnan, Luis Boa Morte, Sean Davis, and Louis Saha in the second tier is madness.\n\nTo think we then signed Champions League winner Van der Sar a year later, before he'd go on to win the trophy again with Man United, is madness, and believe it or not, Chris Coleman dropping TWO divisions to play for us in the old Division Two, was madness.\n\nClint Dempsey and Brian McBride weren't part of the aforementioned great periods in Fulham's history, but the American duo certainly made supporting my club a lot more enjoyable over the years.\n\nJake Murtagh - Brentford\n\nFirst XI: Szczesny, O'Connor, Bates, Hreidarsson, Anderson, Judge, Evans, Tabb, Gayle, Taylor, Owusu\n\nSubs: Smith, Turner, Craig, Douglas, Hurlock, Saunders, Donaldson\n\nThe Bees team comprises of their most-recent promotion-winning sides from the past three decades.\n\nHe was only a loanee but Wojciech Szczesny was head and shoulders above the rest, so starts between the sticks.\n\nAndy Gilpin - Wrexham\n\nFirst XI: Marriott, C Edwards, Carey, J Jones, Hardy, Thomas, Ferguson, Ward, Connolly, Bennett, Trundle.\n\nSubs: Foster, Ugarte, Lawrence, Morrell, Russell, Ashton\n\nNon league clubs have a voice too you know. In fairness most of these are league players from when the mighty Dragons (nee Robins) were in the heady heights of League One.\n\nWe long for those days now, but that front three would grace any Premier League strugglers' bench. And for some reason there are a LOT of left-footers in this side so that imaginary right-back is in for a roasting..."
