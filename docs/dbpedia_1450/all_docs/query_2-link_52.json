        "text": "A MIXED year with a few highs and a fairly innocuous ending has ended and will result in a lot of soul searching in the Offaly football family over the coming months.\n\nThe undoubted highlight was the Leinster Senior Football Championship quarter-final win over Meath while Offaly went agonisingly close to taking Louth in the semi-final.\n\nThey also competed well in Division 3 of the National Football League and while it would be stretching things to suggest that they should have been promoted, they were not that far away.\n\nThe low point was a Tailteann Cup campaign where Offaly showed little appetite for prolonging their season, the body language of players suggested that they had enough of county football almost from the word go and they ran completely into empty for their last game against Cavan.\n\nThe name of Liam Kearns permeates any discussion on the Offaly football season. The Kerry man had been clearly doing good work after his surprise appointment, he had got the team motoring well and the players were responding very positively to them. His sudden death during the league was shockingly sad and had a huge impact on everyone who had worked with him.\n\nOne of his selectors Martin Murphy stepped up as manager and Offaly continued the good work for the remainder of the National Football League and into the Leinster champinship, before the wheels came off in the Tailteann Cup.\n\nNo one can quantify the impact that Kearns' death had on the players and his fellow management members. It was unique, uncharted waters for a county team and his name remains entrenched on the 2023 season.\n\nAny analysis of the team, players and management comes with a caveat and they all deserve a break. It was a very challenging emotional year, apart from the usual tests of the high intensity, high stakes intercounty game in the modern era – it has got even more intense since the introduction of the split season with scarcely room to breath from January through to June.\n\nAll of this was certainly a factor in Offaly's Tailteann Cup malfunction but it does not dilute the need for some serious reflection and soul searching.\n\nThe first big decision to be made is one for Martin Murphy and the County Board? Do they give the Gracefield man a full year in charge, the opportunity to stamp his own imprint on the team? Or do they go with a new appointment and start again?\n\nIt is a big call. Firstly Murphy has to decide if he wants the job and then Michael Duignan and the County Board have to decide if he is the right man for it.\n\nIt is a call for the County Board and Murphy and outside of the officers and those in the squad, no outside observer is qualified to make it. Supporters can have their opinions, based on results and performances, but only those at the coalface truly know.\n\nWe can make a couple of statements, however. After the Leinster championship campaign, Murphy was on solid ground and it would have been effectively his decision over whether to give it another year or not. The Tailteann Cup campaign has muddied the waters and it is all very much up in the air now.\n\nWithout the tragedy of Liam Kearns' passing, Martin Murphy may not have ended up as the Offaly senior football manager, even though his club record commands the utmost of respect and his passion and drive is not open to any question. Life, however, often presents those opportunities for peoople and the appointment of management for next year must be handled delicately and with real fairness. Fairness to all sides of the coin.\n\nHopefully, it will be a mutual decision. That Michael Duignan and Martin Murphy will have a very honest chat and arrive at an agreement about the best way forward: whether that is giving him another year or seeking new management. If they don't agree, then hard calls will be made but at the moment we have to give them the time to do their deliberations and wait and see what happens.\n\nIf the decision is to go for new management, then there is a powerful case to be made for Declan Kelly. His achievements in managing Offaly to the All-Ireland U-20 football title in 2021 have earned him the right to a tilt at the top job. Apart from that, many of those U-20 footballers now need to step up to the grade and make their mark at senior level. Not enough of them have done so yet and their development is crucial to the future of Offaly football. Declan Kelly has a connection with them, has shown he can get the best out of them and he has shown throughout his managerial career that he is not afraid of making tough decisions.\n\nIt is not clear if he wants it but at some stage, he has to decide he is either going to go for it or forget about it; and the County Board have to do the same. Even if it is not this time and Martin Murphy is given a full year, that day or reckoning is coming for both in the not too distant future.\n\nIt is a big decision and all involved have a lot of very serious thinking to do. The evidence of this year suggests that a shake up is needed with the squad.\n\nSome players are approaching their end as inter-county footballers – either Fr Time is catching up on them or some of the younger players on board will result in them naturally drifting away for the simple reason that they will be better.\n\nThe departure of two of those U-20 players, Rory Egan and Jack Bryant along with an older one, Bill Carroll, from the panel after the Leinster champinship defeat by Louth was damaging to the panel. They are young players, fully entitled to travel and make their own decisions. You will always have players dropping off panels, either from not fully committing or getting disgruntled at not getting an opportunity. It happened with Offaly U-20 hurlers this year, it happened the senior footballers late on and players leaving is a fact of life for every county panel at every grade.\n\nThis one, however, struck a nerve with people. Offaly football has loads of experience with players leaving for the USA before the championship season was over in the past and it was one of the big problems that the county squad faced for years. It had looked like these days were over and that is why their departure has come under scrutiny. If players want to travel and experience what the world has to offer, then they must do that but it must be a fundamental requirement of anyone joining a county panel that you stay for the full season – this is a different issue than the above mentioned wastage that will always occur.\n\nDespite that Rory Egan, Jack Bryant and Bill Carroll must be welcomed back with open arms. Rory Egan was outstanding for most of the season and him and Bryant are two of the best young footballers in Offaly. They have a big role to play and deserve the benefit of the doubt but the message now has to go out to everyone: if you don't want to or can't commit fully for the year, then don't come in and take the place of someone who will.\n\nOffaly were middle of the road in the National Football League, finishing joint fourth on eight points. They had huge wins over Antrim and Fermanagh in their first two games and they ensured that they stayed just above the relegation dogfight. They then lost, as expected to Westmeath and Cavan before edging out Longford by a point. Tragically, that was Liam Kearns' last game in charge and on an emotion filled afternoon in Thurles, Offaly beat Tipperary in their next game. A defeat by Down brought the curtain down on the campaign and overall, Offaly were happy to retain their Division 3 status.\n\nThey did very well in the Leinster championship, just getting the better of Longford again in Pearse Park. They produced their performance of the year with a win over Meath in Tullamore and rallied powerfully to almost beat Louth in Croke Park before falling away in extra time.\n\nIt was all downhill after this – Offaly beat London, came back from the dead to draw with Laois and were trounced by Cavan in the group stages of the Tailteann Cup before making a tame exit against Wexford.\n\nAlmost from the start, it was clear that Offaly did not have the heart for the second tier competition. They just didn't get up for it and by the end, it looked very much like they wanted the season to be over. And that was okay. They had given their all for over six months, competed as well as they posssibly could and gave supporters a terrific high against Meath. They were probably as well off to lose to Wexford and not prolong the season – they could have won the Tailteann Cup if they got their intensity back up to where it was for Meath and Louth but they were a country mile off that and were better off out of there and not facing a renewal against Meath.\n\nIt is, however, part of the conundrum now facing the County Board about management – do they judge them on the championship or the Tailteann Cup or a composite of both? Each one has a possible different outcome.\n\nThe following is a brief synopsis of how the Offaly players performed this year, based on the panel from the last game against Wexford and the players that played against Louth in the championship. Ratings are out of 10.\n\nIan Duffy:\n\nA very good year in goals. He had spells in games where he struggled with finding men from kickouts but that was generally down to a high press by opponents and limited options. He was excellent with his basic goalkeeping duties. Rating – 8.\n\nLee Pearson:\n\nA very steady year by Pearson. His enthusiasm did seem to wane in the Tailteann Cup but he was excellent before that, attacking very well and defending solidly. Rating – 8.\n\nDeclan Hogan:\n\nNow in the veteran stages of his career, Hogan's improvement in the last few years has been terrific to watch. He is a great example to young players. A man who lives the right lifestyle and has worked so hard to be the best he can be. The Offaly captain had another really good year. Rating – 9.\n\nDavid Dempsey:\n\nThe Ballycommon man gets through a mountain of work in every game. He rarely puts a foot wrong and does the simple thing very effectively. In a similar mould to Declan Hogan, he was very consistent once again. Rating – 8.\n\nCian Donohue:\n\nCian Donohue was on and off the team, playing in the league but only coming on as a sub against Longford and Meath before starting against Louth and in the Tailteann Cup. Hard working and honest, he was one of several players who went into empty at the end of the Tailteann Cup and looked to be carrying a leg in the defeat by Wexford. Rating – 6.\n\nPeter Cunningham:\n\nA strange year for Peter Cunningham, who was outstanding in some games and yet gave the ball away far more often than normal in others. He came back early from honeymoon for the Meath game and played in a new centre half back role for most of the games. He remains one of Offaly's most important, naturally gifted footballers. Rating – 7.\n\nCiaran Donnelly:\n\nThe Bracknagh man established himself on the Offaly team this year and will have learnt a lot from the season. Very good on the ball, he will be trying to raise the bar further next year. Rating – 6.\n\nJack McEvoy:\n\nVery athletic and with the ability to cover a lot of ground, Jack McEvoy played at midfield for the entire campaign. It was his first season on the team and he had a very good game in the win over Meath. He is also on a learning curve and midfield may not be his best position on a county team but he showed plenty of potential. Rating – 7.\n\nConor McNamee:\n\nOne of the problems facing Offaly this year was that they did not have a natural, powerful midfield. Jack McEvoy and Conor McNamee were asked to play this role and McNamee was so honest in everything he did. Again, midfield would not be his best position but he worked hard and did the simple thing well. Rating – 6.\n\nDylan Hyland:\n\nDylan Hyland was one of the big success stories this year as he came of age as an intercounty footballer. A gifted underage player, he spent some time in Australia before coming onto the senior county team in 2022. He really made his mark this year. His work rate was phenomenal and he was occasionally Offaly's sacrificial lamb as he was asked to fulfill a roving sweeping role. He did everything at pace and scored regularly with his trusty left foot. He got sent off in the Tailteann Cup game against Cavan and this shows that he still needs to keep an eye on his discipline but he was easily in Offaly's best three players and was arguably their best performer. Rating – 9.\n\nRuari McNamee:\n\nOne of the most natural and talented footballers in Offaly, Ruari McNamee was excellent in some games. Consistency was a problem but his composure on the ball created plenty of openings. Rating – 7.\n\nAnton Sullivan:\n\nThe veteran Rhode man is now approaching the end of game of his county career but he still performed at a high level in 2023. His energy brought a lot to the table and he did well in most games, with only a couple of quiet ones. Rating – 8.\n\nAaron Leavy:\n\nAaron Leavy was a late introduction into the panel, coming on as a sub against Louth and playing in the Tailteann Cup. One of the better players in the defeat by Wexford, Offaly will be hoping to get him on board for the full season next year and develop him as a midfield option. He has something to offer. Rating – 6.\n\nNigel Dunne:\n\nNigel Dunne's recall to the panel was one of Liam Kearns' big surprises as his county career looked over. It looked questionable at the time but Dunne did well. He took his scores from play and free, stayed in close to goals and did what was expected of him. A big plus with Dunne is that he is very aware of his limitations at this stage of his career – that he is not a 70 minute man, even if injuries resulted in him playing the full game against Meath, and that he has no business chasing down the field or holding up the ball. He did exactly what management wanted from him in 2023. Rating – 7.\n\nCian Farrell:\n\nCian Farrell returned to the team this year after a long lay off with a cruciate injury. He showed tantalising flashes of his old form, even if he was not back to where he was before he got his injury. He remains one of the most gifted forwards in Offaly, had some very good spells in games and hopefully this year will have helped rebuild his confidence. Rating – 6.\n\nJoe Maher:\n\nJoe Maher was on and off the team this year. He had some very good spells in games without nailing down a starting place in the attack. Rating – 6.\n\nNigel Bracken:\n\nAnother late call up to the panel, Nigel Bracken's late tour-de-force rescued a draw against Laois in the Tailteann Cup. Rating – 6.\n\nBernard Allen:\n\nOne of Offaly's longest serving footballers, he got a knee injury early after coming on against Meath but got back for the end of the Tailteann Cup. He remains a very good finisher and got a few important scores. Rating – 6.\n\nJamie Evans:\n\nStarted in the three Leinster championship games, showing good pace on the ball. Rating – 6.\n\nRory Egan:\n\nIt took Rory Egan a couple of games to get going but once he did, he showed his quality as an attacking wing back. Looks very comfortable at this level. Rating – 8.\n\nJack Bryant:\n\nOffaly needs Jack Bryant to establish himself in the coming couple of seasons. He got a few chances as a sub this year and showed glimpses of real potential. He was almost a match winner against Louth but it didn't quite happen for him. There is no doubting his ability. Rating – 6.\n\nMorgan Tynan:\n\nMorgan Tynan came on as a sub in the Tailteann Cup games and is one of the 2021 U-20s who now has to step up to the mark. Needs a chance to show his worth. Rating – 6.\n\nAaron Brazil:\n\nCame on as a sub in a couple of games but wasn't on long. Rating – 6.\n\nCormac Delaney:\n\nCormac Delaney came onto the panel for the Tailteann Cup and is another of the U-20s who now needs to transition to the higher level. Rating – 6.\n\nJordan Hayes:\n\nJordan Hayes was out of the country on army duty for most of the year. He came back during the Tailteann Cup and started against Wexford. He will be a very important player next year. Rating – 6.\n\nBill Carroll:\n\nThere is loads of football in Bill Carroll but he found himself on and off the team this year and it didn't quite happen for him, even if he looked very good at times. Rating – 6.\n\nShane Tierney:\n\nA surprise replacement against Meath, Shane Tierney also came onto the panel during the season. Got a limited chance. Rating – 6.\n\nJack O'Brien:\n\nJack O'Brien came on as a sub against Louth and will benefit from this year. Rating – 6.\n\nLuke Egan:\n\nLuke Egan came on as a sub in a handful of games this year but still has to establish himself at this level. Rating – 6.\n\nMark Abbott:\n\nWas on the extended panel for most of the year and didn't feature.\n\nShane O'Toole-Greene:\n\nShane O'Toole-Greene started the first league game against Antrim and came on as a sub against Louth. He is new at this level and needs to be patient. Rating – 6.\n\nCorey White:\n\nAs sub goalkeeper and with Ian Duffy having a firm grip on the number 1 jersey, Corey White got very little opportunity in competitive games and it would be unfair to rate him."
