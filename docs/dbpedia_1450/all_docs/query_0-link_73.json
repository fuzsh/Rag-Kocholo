        "text": "2022 has proven to be a wild year for all 3 forms of American football in Ireland, but none have been quite as unpredictable as the 2022 AFI Flag Football season. Beginning back on August 20th shortly after Shamrock Bowl XXXIV, 24 flag football teams have competed for the chance to be a part of this Saturday November 5th‘s playoffs at Dromore RFC, Co. Down. Alas, 8 remain, 4 each from Premier Division and Division 1.\n\n12:15 — Division 1 Semi-finals\n\n#1 Belfast Knights vs #4 Antrim Jets\n\n#2 Westmeath Minotaurs vs Cill Dara Crusaders\n\n13:30 — Premier Division Semi-finals\n\n#1 South Dublin Panthers vs #4 Donegal / Derry Vipers\n\n#2 Craigavon Cowboys vs #3 Dublin Bay Raptors\n\n14:45 — Division 1 final: Glas Bowl III\n\n16:00 — Premier Division final: Emerald Bowl VIII\n\nWith just a few more games to go before this year’s Emerald Bowl and Glas Bowl Champions are crowned, let’s take a look at each team’s path to the playoffs.\n\nPremier Division\n\n#1 South Dublin Panthers (10-0) — South\n\nThe Panthers came up from 2021’s Division 1 and utterly dominated the South group this year, going undefeated and putting up some truly elite performances on both sides of the ball. Scoring a country-high 411 points in their 10 games and also boasting the #1 defense (157 points), the Panthers came out with a screaming start by handily beating group-favourite Edenderry Eagles and Dublin Rebels. It should have come as no surprise that the Panthers have had as good a season as they’ve had — with the likes of Jo Buchanan, Sean Douglas and Ryan Eccles all making splash plays on offense and defense, as well as QB Joe Grey leading the charge for the South Dublin side.\n\n#2 Craigavon Cowboys (10-0) — North\n\n2021’s National Champions had themselves a perfect season of their own, going 10-0 in an otherwise very tight division. Also posting over 400 points, the Craigavon offense (and a certain QB Peter Loughran) is a juggernaut everyone around the league is very aware of. With potential national team members such as Neil Maxwell, Austin Ramsey and Scott Buchanan available though, Craigavon are more than just their well-renowned QB. With a defense that kept opposing offenses to 21 or less points in 6 out of 10 games, Craigavon have everything it takes to repeat their Emerald Bowl win from last season\n\n#3 Dublin Bay Raptors (7-3) — South\n\nPerhaps another surprise considering the preseason strength of the South group, the Raptors truly burst on to the scene by starting 4-0. Veteran QB Todd Zboyan led a young group of players after amalgamating with the Thomastown Tigers and crafted a team that put up more than 30 points in all but 1 game. While the likes of Jack Basquille and Jason Kolokithas will help fill the gap, the Raptors will be without standout piece on offense and defense Peadar O’Muiri. Still, the Raptors have shown to be the type of team to face big challenges head-on, and after coming 2 points short of upsetting the #1 seed, they may very well fancy themselves against the #2 seed.\n\n#4 Donegal / Derry Vipers (6-4) — North\n\nThe Vipers might be the true upset of this playoff schedule this season. Being promoted from 2021’s Division 1, Donegal / Derry had a tough task ahead of them to stay up in a group that includes the high-scoring Hurricanes, a Trojans team that specialises in tight games, an athletic Mavericks outfit and fellow promoted side Belfast City Lions. Not only did the Vipers achieve Premier Division status for next year, but they blew past every expectation put in front of them, and put on some fantastic games while they were at it. After a sputtering start that saw some wide scorelines, 4 of the Vipers last 6 games were decided by 10 or less points, including a thriller with Maynooth that saw QB Peter Hamilton connect with star receiver Chad Higgins with just 7 seconds left on the clock to both win the game and secure their spot in this weekend’s playoffs. The Vipers knack for coming through with big plays in clutch moments will be key in their push for the finals.\n\nDivision 1\n\n#1 Belfast Knights (9-1) — North\n\nRelegation can demoralise some teams and lead to some hitting the reset button and taking a few years before making true attempts to climb back up — the Knights aren’t some teams. With players like Jordan Clinton and John McCrystal to get the ball to, the Knights scored fairly consistently in the 30-35 point range, landing there in 6 of their 10 games. The series with the Jets is currently in the black and gold’s favour at 2-1, so the Knights will have even more of an incentive to progress to the Glas Bowl game.\n\n#2 Westmeath Minotaurs (8-2) — South\n\nThe Minotaurs have, for the last few years, been the team that has been *right* at playoff contention, only to have forfeits from earlier in the season to come back and haunt them. After putting a full season together, the Westmeath side put themselves on top of the South group, dropping points only to the Crusaders at the start of the season and the Rebels 2nds in their final gameweek. Scoring over 400 points this season — 1 of 3 teams in the country to do so — it seems the infusion of youth in their depths has pushed the Minotaurs to true players in the division, with the likes of Jack and Darragh Lynch, Peter Dempsey and Shaun Dalton all playing key roles.\n\n#3 Cill Dara Crusaders (7-3) — South\n\nThe Crusaders are a different side altogether with Jordan Farrell under center compared to last season. Improving drastically from their 1-5 finish in 2021, Cill Dara are just 2 games away from adding a flag football trophy to the club’s cabinet. Luke Carey and Ethan Bolger have added some versatility on offense that perhaps was previously missing, while defensively the Crusaders have been rock solid, boasting a unit that has conceded less than 17 points a game. Much like the Vipers in the Premier Division, the Crusaders waited right until the end of the season to lock this playoff position up, just getting in ahead of the Rebels 2nds after beating UCD 30-27. Morale and momentum in the Crusaders camp is high and, with a 50-20 victory over the Minotaurs under their belts from earlier in the season, could well be on their way to lifting the Glas Bowl on Saturday.\n\n#4 Antrim Jets (7-3) — North\n\nThe Jets are a curious team to preview. Relatively new to flag football (2021 debut season: 2-6 record), the Jets have performed past their expected goals for the season. With the highest scoring offense and 2nd best defense in the North group, their place in the playoffs was more than validated, especially considering they shutout the #1 seed in an amazing 32-0 performance and one loss was by a mere 2 points. With standouts like Jonny McCullough, Ryan Beckett and Scot McLean, the Jets can absolutely go on a run to the Glas Bowl.\n\nEntry to the playoff event this Saturday is FREE so come down and support your team! Make sure to follow along the games on our dedicated flag football website here to find live scores and full season standings. A live stream will also be available — link to follow on our social pages.\n\nTime flies and we are now in the final week of the regular season games for both the EBC and GBC 2019 seasons.\n\nThis being the penultimate preview of 2019 we thought we’d start with the inaugural GBC season. It all started with thirteen teams but only the top six will claim the right to compete in the playoff and maybe a shot at becoming Glas Bowl 1 champions.\n\nA few teams have already booked their ticket to the playoff although without a definitive position yet. The Cork City Outlaws (5-1) and the South Dublin Panthers (4-1-1) currently 1st and 2nd, will be going to the playoff on the 2nd of November. However, since they have no remaining fixtures, they will only have to wait and see to find out what seeding they will finishing at.\n\nOn their trail (although already playoff bound) and with two games left to play, the Craigavon Cowboys 2nd (4-0) and Louth Mavericks 2nd (4-0) are a in a good position to take the top seeds if they win both their games with the added bonus that their last game will be against each other (which is our pick for the GBC game of the week). Now, that being said if both teams failed to win their first game and tied their second or even tie both games, they would still be in the top four teams.\n\nThe real excitement will come from further down the table. The West Dublin Rhinos (3-2-1) will be on the edge of their seat hoping for the Maynooth Hurricanes (2-2) or Belfast Trojans 2nd (2-2) to lose at least one of their games which would then seal their playoff ticket. If both Hurricanes and Trojans were to win two games then both would go to the playoff.\n\nNow deeper in the table, the Ulster Elks (1-2-1), UCC Raiders 2nd (1-3) and Downpatrick Saints (1-3) could be giving us some upset. If the Hurricanes and Trojans were to loose both their games and the Elks were to win both their games then the Elks would go to the playoff as 5th or 6th seed (tie-breaker would apply against the Rhinos). If the Elks, the Hurricanes and Trojans were to lose both games and UCC were to win both their games then they would take the 6th seed. Same scenario for the Saints if all four teams currently above them were to loose both their games.\n\nAll in all, nothing is certain yet which should make for some great games this Saturday at the Dundalk IT Sports Grounds from 11am.\n\nNow for the EBC. The EBC is the Premier League of Flag Football in Ireland and as such we have some of the best teams and players in the country battling it out to claim the sought title of Emerald Bowl Champions or National Champions.\n\nJust like the GBC, it started with twelve teams, who were the top twelve teams from the EBC 2018 season. Just like the GBC, only the top six teams will be eligible to compete in the playoff with a shot at the championship at the Sport Ireland Campus on the 2nd of November. We would like to point out that even though this is the “premier league” of flag football, we did not go through the season unscathed as the season was plagued with a string of forfeits – which will be addressed at the end of the season.\n\nWith that out of the way – what’s cooking in the EBC?\n\nWell the season is basically over for UCD (2-5-1), Meath Bulldogs (0-8) and Dublin Rebels (0-8).\n\nCurrent National Champions Craigavon Cowboys (6-0) and Emerald Bowl 5 runners-up Louth Mavericks (6-0) are seating comfortably at 1st and 2nd and have already booked their ticket to the playoff although we do not yet know which will be topping the group. Mavericks have two tough fixtures against 3rd seed Edenderry Eagles (5-2) and 7th seed Trinity (3-3) with Trinity playing it all out to make the playoff a second year in a row. Some cracking games to watch there.\n\nThe Cowboys, being a competitive team, will try to keep they clean record and grab the highly sought after 8-0 perfect season against the 8th seed UCC Raiders and 9th seed Westmeath Minotaurs (also first ever Emerald Bowl champions in 2015). Both teams are on the hunt for a much needed 6th seed to make the playoff.\n\nThis is the Dublin Bay Raptors’ (4-2) second EBC appearance, and while they came very close to make the playoff last year for EBC 2018, they are now in a good position to reach the tops seeds if only they make sure to win two tough fixtures against Trinity and Belfast Trojans (4-3). The Raptors, Trojans and Knights are all on 12 points but the Knights have no fixtures left to play and while currently seating at 6th, are on the fence and will have to wait and hope that both Trinity and UCC lose both their games as one win would be enough for either Trinity or UCC to make the playoff as the Knights lost a game against both teams and would lose on head-to-head.\n\nSome exciting games ahead to look forward to kicking off at 11am at the Newbridge College sports ground.\n\nGood luck to all!!\n\nhad games of any kind before this season. Usually we know what to expect from teams and work on schemes based on that. This season we’ve worked on what we do best as opposed to our opponents. I think because of that our new guys and girls have learnt a lot quicker than past versions of this side have.\n\nIAFA: How has your team prepared for the upcoming season?\n\nJK: I genuinely believe we’re full of weapons on both sides of the ball. There are too many teams that focus on getting the ball to one guy to make plays – I have no problem letting teams know that we will be spreading the ball around because we have the talent to do that; and I have no problem letting teams know that everyone on our defence is capable of some special plays if you give them an opportunity to do so.\n\nIAFA: Who are your players to watch?\n\nJK: As a coach I’m thinking of things a little differently, sure, since there’s only a small handful of games to make playoffs. As president I’m thinking of things a little differently because it means travel works differently, and training work differently. As a player, I am (as I’m sure everyone else is) seeing six games of flag football that are played just like any other game of flag football.\n\nIAFA: What advice will you give your team before their first game?\n\nJK: Another cliche; have fun, above all else, then worry about winning. I think as teams we need to realise that sometimes we don’t play flag football for the right reasons – being blown out and running up the score can sometimes end up being as fun as each other. If we’re able to keep the banter levels the same before, during, and after game day, even with a 6-7 hour round trip, and regardless of results, then we’re playing for the right reasons. I want to make sure every Hurricane remembers that before heading down to Cork. Winning is always great, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of it being a chore either.\n\n6.2.5\n\nreal legitimacy to the sport and we hope it will help grow the sport. We competed against most of the same teams last year so we’re really just focused on playing our game.\n\nIAFA: You are currently positioned 3rd in the league with another four games to play. Have you changed your strategy since the start of the season?\n\nTZ: Our strategy hasn’t changed, we’re happy with the position we’re in at the moment and feel we’ve put ourselves on a good place to get a playoff spot this year.\n\nIAFA: Based on last season records, which of the other EBC 2019 teams do you think will give your team the biggest challenge this season?\n\nTZ: All the teams in the EBC have the potential to win games….”any given Sunday”. We had a particularly close game against the Cowboys last year and are looking forward to the rematch this week. We’ve had competitive games against UCD in the past, they’re always a fun team to play. And we’re looking forward to playing Trinity in week 5, as we haven’t played them before.\n\nIAFA: What would make your team have the edge over your other EBC competitors?\n\nTZ: The majority of our players have immense football knowledge and experience. This gives us an advantage coming up with a game plan and also being able to adapt that plan during the game to take advantage of the other teams strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIAFA: Who are your players to watch?\n\nTZ: I can’t really single any one player out, as we’ve really fostered a team first attitude with the Raptors. Everybody knows the job they need to do and isn’t afraid to ask for help if they’re struggling.\n\nIAFA: With the increased emphasis on having more women involved in playing or managing sport, what are you doing to recruit more female members into your club?\n\nTZ: Female participation is important for the growth of the sport. We’ve had at least one female player on the team since it’s inception and will continue to look for more females players.\n\nIAFA: With the newly revamped National programme kicking off for Flag Football this year, will your players’ focus be a little different than just winning the season this time?\n\nTZ: The National Programme starting up again is very exciting for the sport. We have a few players who played on the National Team a few years back and we’re able to draw on their experience to help the team. Our players focus is on making the playoff and winning the EBC. If they get selected for the Wolfhounds, that’s just icing on the cake.\n\nIAFA: What advice will you give your players before their first game?\n\nTZ: Same as always….play hard, play error free, do your job, and have fun.\n\n6.2.5\n\ninto the EBC and GBC has certainly made a difference in competitiveness. We knew that this year would be harder than last and our players understand that. We’re training harder, running more complex concepts and not taking any game for granted. With eight games this season as opposed to ten last year, there’s far less room for error. We are continuing to improve week on week. The great thing about the team is that we can be confident that if one person goes out, the next person in will be able to do the job as well if not better.\n\nIAFA: You are currently positioned 2nd in the league with another three games to go. Have you changed your strategy since the start of the season in order to assure you are in the top 6 teams by season end?\n\nKMC: We don’t really think about our league position at this stage. Just going to focus on one game at a time and play ours. If we do thatthen the wins will come.\n\nIAFA: Based on last season records, which of the other EBC 2019 teams do you think will give your team the biggest challenge this season?\n\nKMC: The Cowboys are the team to beat again this year. We came away with a draw against them last season and we’re hoping to get three points this time around.\n\nIAFA: What would make your team have the edge over your other EBC competitors?\n\nKMC: We’re a very adaptable team. If things aren’t working we can change very quickly to fix it. We also have incredible coaches at the helm who have been around this game longer than I’ve been born!\n\nIAFA: Who are your players to watch?\n\nKMC: It’s very hard to pick players to watch because they all have so much quality! I would say we have at least five players who are Wolfhounds material. If I had to name a couple though, I’d say watch Josh Davis. He’s been quietly racking up the touchdowns the last few games. Paul Crothers is a menace at DB in the kitted game and that has translated really well to flag. Michael Harland is a brilliant two-way player, having picked up interceptions and touchdowns throughout the season. Jordan Clinton has ridiculous speed and route running which has translated into a lot of points. Chris Muir is one of our new guys who has become an excellent tackle and blitzer. I believe he has three sacks on the season so far. We can’t underestimate the impact our female players have had either. Amber Perry and Lauren Purton both have experience in BAFA (British American Football Association) and are excellent on the defensive side.\n\nIAFA: With the increased emphasis on having more women involved in playing or managing sport, what are you doing to recruit more female members into your club?\n\nKMC: We were able to recruit a couple of female players from our Freshers Fair stall last year who have stayed with us this year. The hope is to continue to recruit female players and eventually get to the point where we can field an all-female squad in the near future.\n\nIAFA: With the newly revamped National programme kicking off for Flag Football this year, will your players’ focus be a little different than just winning the season this time?\n\nKMC: Our guys are very excited about the Nnational Team forming and I believe it is bringing out the best in them. It kind of works hand in hand. They play well on the field, they get noticed and we win games because of it. Like I said before, we have at least five or six guys and girls who I believe could be starters on the Wolfhounds Flag Football squads.\n\nIAFA: What advice will you give your players before their first game?\n\nKMC: Never underestimate the opponent. Flag Football can be a crazy sport and it’s important to treat every team as the toughest team in the league.\n\n6.2.5\n\nIAFA: You are currently positioned 7th in the league with another four games to play. Have you changed your strategy since the start of the season?\n\nRT: That would be telling!!\n\nIAFA: Based on last season records, which of the other EBC 2019 teams do you think will give your team the biggest challenge this season?\n\nRT: The cowboys are probably the biggest challenge so far. Lads play well and are extremely skill-full. And able to adapt to different roles. They’ll be the team to watch out for.\n\nIAFA: What would make your team have the edge over your other EBC competitors?\n\nRT: We don’t take the game too seriously and go out to enjoy it. Plus most of our players are well experienced in flag football. With several of us having gone to the jags tourney last year and finishing 3rd. We’ve got some good players\n\nIAFA: Who are your players to watch?\n\nRT: Pretty much all of them. Can’t count any of them to not be troublesome for the opposition.\n\nIAFA: With the increased emphasis on having more women involved in playing or managing sport, what are you doing to recruit more female members into your club?\n\nRT: We’ve reached out to local communities and have an open invitation to all players male and female. While there has been some interest it hasn’t really taken traction yet. This is something we hope to address for the next season.\n\nIAFA: With the newly revamped National programme kicking off for Flag Football this year, will your players’ focus be a little different than just winning the season this time?\n\nRT: We’re in a tough spot on the table at the moment but I can depend on the team to give 100%. The focus won’t change which is to compete, play fair and represent the team with pride.\n\nIAFA: What advice will you give your players before their first game?\n\nRT: Relax, smile, get that flag, get the TD. Most of all enjoy it.\n\n6.2.5\n\n6.2.5\n\n6.2.5\n\na sustainable rate. This also allows us to take the gloves off and put out our strongest team available in the EBC. We have a plethora of talent in the squad so we’re looking forward to pushing ourselves against the best.\n\nIAFA: Based on the EBC 2018 season, which of the other EBC 2019 teams do you think will give your team the biggest challenge this season?\n\nDH: We’ve got fixtures against current Champions, Cowboys, and EB IV Champions, Eagles, who are always going to be tough. We’re also looking forward to seeing the Raptors again as we’ve had a few good games with them over the last few years.\n\nIAFA: What would make your team have the edge over your other EBC competitors?\n\nDH: We definitely have an impressive level of camaraderie in the group. Every player on the squad is on the same page and everyone’s here to enjoy themselves whilst playing the sport.\n\nIAFA: Who are your players to watch?\n\nDH: Jahn Dasini is one of those players who’s a threat to score anytime they touch the ball, Jack Fagan is one of the top dual threat QBs in the country and James Hogan is really solid on both sides of the ball, they’d be our most prominent players but we’re really happy with the strength in depth that we have.\n\nIAFA: The International Federation of American Football, governing body for everything American football internationally, are increasing their focus on making flag football a bigger part of growing American Football on all continents, and therefore IFAF are spending more time and effort in international events and possibly creating a “champions league” of flag football. Would this be something your club would look forward to if you were to be champions this season?\n\nDH: Absolutely, it’d be an incredible experience and it’d be great to see the standards of play outside of Ireland.\n\nIAFA: With the increased emphasis on having more women involved in playing or managing sport, what are you doing to recruit more female members into your club?\n\nDH: We’ve had a strong female presence in the club since we started out three years ago, and we continue to recruit new members around campus and make them feel welcome on the squad at every available opportunity.\n\nIAFA: With the newly revamped National Programme kicking off for Flag Football this year, will your focus be a little different than just winning the season this time?\n\nDH: I don’t think so, as long as we’re wearing UCC jerseys, every member of the squad is playing for the team. We’ll definitely be encouraging our players to try out for the national program at the end of the season to get some fresh perspectives on the game and compete on a national level.\n\nIAFA: What advice will you give your players before their first game?\n\nDH: Know your job, do your job and enjoy the game.\n\n6.2.5\n\nbegin the year with so many new athletes that we have to teach the basics. We are confident that our young, hungry group of rookies will step up and support our established flag players in making a playoff push.\n\nIAFA: Based on last season records, which of the other EBC 2019 teams do you think will give your team the biggest challenge this season?\n\nSC: The Dublin Bay Raptors are always a fun team to play. Highly competitive and a great bunch of lads.\n\nIAFA: What would make your team have the edge over your other EBC competitors?\n\nSC: A new group of young hungry players.\n\nIAFA: Who are your players to watch?\n\nSC: Our players to watch would be our rookies, see how the perform and adapt to the sport. It is early at the minute but there are some young stars that are sure to emerge from the group.\n\nIAFA: The International Federation of American Football, governing body for everything American football internationally, are increasing their focus on making flag football a bigger part of growing American Football on all continents, and therefore IFAF are spending more time and effort in international events and possibly creating a “champions league” of flag football. Would this be something your club would look forward to if you were to be champions this season?\n\nSC: Of course we would be interested in a champions league. The idea of competing against the best of the best is an appeal to any athlete of any sport.\n\nIAFA: With the newly revamped National programme kicking off for Flag Football this year, will your focus be a little different than just winning the season this time?\n\nSC: Our emphasis is on developing sound football players so in that regard nothing will change. If they perform well enough I am sure selectors will take notice. These things tend to look after themselves.\n\nIAFA: What advice will you give your team before their first game?\n\nSC: Have fun, don’t be afraid to make mistake (what are a few flags anyway) and try your best. The rest will look after itself.\n\n6.2.5\n\nIAFA: Based on last season records, which of the other EBC 2019 teams do you think will give your team the biggest challenge this season?\n\nJQ: We want to compete against the best, and at the moment that’s the holders, the Craigavon Cowboys. They’re the top team that we’re yet to face off against, so that should be a fun matchup in a couple of weeks time.\n\nIAFA: What would make your team have the edge over your other EBC competitors?\n\nJQ: We have a great ball hawking defense. In the regular season last year we had more picks than TDs conceded, which is something we’re proud of.\n\nIAFA: Who are your players to watch?\n\nJQ: Offensively we’re looking forward to seeing how Franklin Ume Obiekwe and Jamie Bolger get on after successful full kit rookie seasons. On the defensive side of the ball, Ger O’Halloran has been top quality for years and is looking even better this year.\n\nIAFA: The International Federation of American Football, governing body for everything American football internationally, are increasing their focus on making flag football a bigger part of growing American Football on all continents, and therefore IFAF are spending more time and effort in international events and possibly creating a “champions league” of flag football. Would this be something your club would look forward to if you were to be champions this season?\n\nJQ: Absolutely. We were trying to participate in an European tournament over the summer but unfortunately it didn’t work out. A Champions League style tournament would be great for the sport and definitely something we’d be interested in.\n\nIAFA: With the increased emphasis on having more women involved in playing or managing sport, what are you doing to recruit more female members into your club?\n\nJQ: Most of our recruitment is done over the course of freshers week on campus, so this year was the first time there was an emphasis on recruiting both men and women into the club.\n\nIAFA: With the newly revamped National programme kicking off for Flag Football this year, will your focus be a little different than just winning the season this time?\n\nJQ: Our sole focus will be on winning each and every game. If we have some standout players who end up getting call ups – fantastic!\n\nIAFA: For any potential volunteers considering joining an American football team, what roles would you have available?\n\nJQ: We have few roles that we would like to fill such as director of social media and recruitment officer.\n\nIAFA: What advice will you give your team before their first game?\n\nJQ: Do your job.\n\n6.2.5\n\n6.2.5\n\n6.2.5\n\nthe country and our Defence comes up against the best Offence in country. I firmly believe that we are the best team in the league and come November 2nd, we’ll have proven that.\n\nIAFA: Based on the EBC 2018 season, which of the other EBC 2019 teams do you think will give your team the biggest challenge this season?\n\nRC: That’s an interesting question to ask. We’ve competed against and beat most of this seasons schedule before. The Edenderry Eagles will be an interesting team to come up against. We didn’t get the opportunity to play them last year but they got to the playoff and competed in the Jacksonville Jaguars 7’s tournament, so there must be something there. Aside from that, whoever we’ll meet in the final.\n\nIAFA: What would make your team have the edge over your other EBC competitors?\n\nRC: Our commitment towards excellence. Everyone is striving to be the best player and teammate they can be. We’ve established a culture where everyone is working for each other and for the common goal. We had genuine athletes with high levels of footballing intelligence. A quarterback who can throw end-zone to end-zone. Receivers who will win contested balls time and time again even in double coverage. A blitzer who will be in on quarterbacks in less than 2.5 seconds. Defensive backs who know what opposition players are going to do before they even know themselves.\n\nIAFA: Who are your players to watch?\n\nRC: Everyone. To select just a few would be a great disservice to the rest of the team. If you take your eyes off one player, they will burn you.\n\nIAFA: The International Federation of American Football, governing body for everything American football internationally, are increasing their focus on making flag football a bigger part of growing American Football on all continents, and therefore IFAF are spending more time and effort in international events and possibly creating a “champions league” of flag football. Would this be something your club would look forward to if you were to be champions this season?\n\nRC: Firstly, when we are champions this season. Absolutely! The opportunity to compete against and beat teams from around the world would be incredible. We’ve developed a style of play that is unrivalled and unique to ourselves. From what I’ve viewed on the international scene, I haven’t seen a team that could match us either. It would be another title that we’re more than happy to take home.\n\nIAFA: With the increased emphasis on having more women involved in playing or managing sport, what are you doing to recruit more female members into your club?\n\nRC: Increasing female participation in the sport is something that the club is committed to. Over the course of the preseason we had five female players. However, unfortunately due to work and other commitments we’re currently down to two. Really, there needs to be a multitude of things done which we are working on. This season we want to highlight the talented female players we have. By showcasing their talents, we would hope that they will help garner the interest of others to participate in the sport. Many of the players are actively trying to encourage the women in their lives to join our American footballing community. We’ve also been in contact with a number of female influencers in the region and are hoping to work closely with them in the future to help boost the profile of the sport.\n\nIAFA: With the newly revamped National Programme kicking off for Flag Football this year, will your focus be a little different than just winning the season this time?\n\nRC: It’s excellent that the National Programme is starting up again. However, winning will always be our main priority. When the national team comes recruiting, we know it’ll have a strong Mavericks presence.\n\nIAFA: For any potential volunteers considering joining an American football team, what roles would you have available?\n\nRC: A videographer and statistics analyst. I’m a big advocate of watching tape from training and games to go back over how everything went in order to see anywhere that that can be further improved. With the help of a videographer and statistics analyst, we’d be able to gather better quality videos and interpret more clearly the effect of each play and the opposing formations.\n\nIAFA: What advice will you give your players before their first game?\n\nRC: I genuinely can’t fully answer that due to the expletive laden and emotional nature of my pregame talks. However, it will generally focus on the greatness of them as a unit, how they have all the skills necessary to beat anyone and a bit of degradation about the opposition.\n\nfrom last season where we were met with a few forfeits. However, our team has improved immensely over the past 18 months. It’s not a fixture list we’ll shy away from – that’s what the EBC should be all about, the best competing against the best.\n\nIAFA: Based on last season records, which of the other EBC 2019 teams do you think will give your team the biggest challenge this season?\n\nIS: Louth Mavericks and UCC are both talented teams with a point to prove having narrowly missed out on Emerald Bowl 5 and playoff respectively. We had the opportunity to see UCD and Dublin Bay Raptors at a game-day last season and they looked dynamic and disciplined enough to give any team problems.\n\nIAFA: What would make your team have the edge over your other EBC competitors?\n\nIS: I can’t really speak for other programmes, but I know our coaching staff and off-field team are among the most committed and determined that I’ve ever had a chance to work alongside.\n\nIAFA: Who are your players to watch?\n\nIS: We have a lot of talented players on both sides of the ball. We are blessed to have Alex Kusmirek among our ranks, who is widely regarded as one of the best defensive backs in the country – particularly given his recent success as a Shamrock Bowl winner and with the Irish Wolfhounds.\n\nIAFA: The International Federation of American Football, governing body for everything American football internationally, are increasing their focus on making flag football a bigger part of growing American Football on all continents, and therefore IFAF are spending more time and effort in international events and possibly creating a “champions league” of flag football. Would this be something your club would look forward to if you were to be champions this season?\n\nIS: That’s a bridge we’ll cross when we get to it. Our focus has to be on winning the Bowl before anything that comes after it. That said, I have always been a big fan of the various “Champions Bowls” played across the continent as a way of growing the sport internationally.\n\nIAFA: With the increased emphasis on having more women involved in playing or managing sport, what are you doing to recruit more female members into your club?\n\nIS: We’re arranging some upcoming trial days for female players – keep an eye out on social media! This season has also seen the first ever female Trojan captain in Helen Smyth who is returning after an exciting rookie season. We have also added some new female players to our Trojans 2ndssquad.\n\nIAFA: With the newly revamped National programme kicking off for Flag Football this year, will your focus be a little different than just winning the season this time?\n\nIS: Our players’ focus will be on performing to the best of their ability on a game by game basis. That’s how they’ll be selected for the national team. I’m looking forward to seeing the revamped National Team and think it’s exactly what the sport needs in order to progress to that next level.\n\nIAFA: For any potential volunteers considering joining an American football team, what roles would you have available?\n\nIS: A little bit of anything and everything! Stats takers on gamedays, referees, film crew for recording sessions or even coaching roles within our squads. The only requirement is a love of the game.\n\nIAFA: What advice will you give your team before their first game?\n\nIS: Remember what brought us this far. This is our chance to do something special.\n\n6.2.5\n\nphysical aspects of the game and are keen to see what the other teams can do. We know our strengths, but we will not miss out on the opportunity to learn an integrate effective styles of play from any opponent.\n\nIAFA: Based on last season records, which of the other EBC 2019 teams do you think will give your team the biggest challenge this season?\n\nGS: It is really difficult to say, both Trinity College and West Meath Minotaurs were exceedingly tough opponents. I’m sure each and every team on the roster whether competing again or just starting up have been busy preparing and improving so it is hard to call who will be team to watch this year.\n\nIAFA: What would make your team have the edge over your other EBC competitors?\n\nGS: Again, it would be tough to decide as we haven’t yet seen what the other teams have to offer. But I believe we have a versatile squad of talented players able to play on multiple positions both sides of the ball.\n\nIAFA: Who are your players to watch?\n\nGS: We have made some changes to the line-up since last year with our QB stepping away from the game, Andy Lynch will be filling that position so we’re looking forward to seeing how he holds up. Matthew Clarke and Darragh Hogan have proven themselves as capable receivers on the kitted team so you should keep an eye out for them as well.\n\nIAFA: The International Federation of American Football, governing body for everything American football internationally, are increasing their focus on making flag football a bigger part of growing American Football on all continents, and therefore IFAF are spending more time and effort in international events and possibly creating a “champions league” of flag football. Would this be something your club would look forward to if you were to be champions this season?\n\nGS: Absolutely. Not sure what more to say other than that we would be thrilled to take part in a higher level competition.\n\nIAFA: With the increased emphasis on having more women involved in playing or managing sport, what are you doing to recruit more female members into your club?\n\nGS: Friends and family of the club for the moment. But we do have plans to reach out to clubs and schools to focus our recruitment drives towards female players.\n\nIAFA: With the newly revamped National programme kicking off for Flag Football this year, will your focus be a little different than just winning the season this time?\n\nGS: We are focusing on growing the team and establishing a stronger core of fundamentals.\n\nIAFA: For any potential volunteers considering joining an American football team, what roles would you have available?\n\nGS: We have few roles that we would like to fill such as director of social media and recruitment officer.\n\nIAFA: What advice will you give your team before their first game?\n\nGS: Discipline on both sides of the ball. Follow your assignment. Win or lose as a team.\n\n6.2.5"
