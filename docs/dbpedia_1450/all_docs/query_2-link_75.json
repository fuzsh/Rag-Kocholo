        "text": ", 1 January,\n\nPhil Jagielka has moved to take some of the pressure of his beleaguered manager by insisting that it's up to the Everton players to sort out their current run of dreadful form.\n\nThe Blues' skipper was asked whether it was time for Roberto Martinez's management to be questioned after the Blues' worst run of defeats in 10 seasons but he says there is enough experience in the ranks for the players to look at themselves rather than blame the boss.\n\n�We're massively behind him. I don't think it's come to that point ... things haven't gone from hero to zero in the space of nine games.\n\n�At the end of the day we go out there to play and if we don't pick up results, the manager will take a bit of the blame but the players have to go out there and perform. We've got a lot to answer for and the only way we can make it up to the fans is by winning games.\n\n\"We're not a bunch of kids. We've been in similar situations before.\n\n�The way we performed last season was so far removed from this that people have started to look upon it a little bit harder. We know we're not where we want or need to be and it's only us who can sort it out.�\n\nAdmitting that the Blues were hesitant coming into today's game at Hull, Jagielka is already looking forward to Tuesday's FA Cup Third Round tie against West Ham, the first of three consecutive home games, to start building team morale.\n\n�We lacked confidence going into [Hull] and then conceding twice, the second just before half time, sort of took the wind out of our sails.\n\n�We tried to change things around second half, possibly improved our performance, but got nothing out of it. There's a lot of things to sort out but hopefully we can get a result in the FA Cup next week and that can give us a bit of confidence and in turn we can start getting some points in the league.�\n\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.
