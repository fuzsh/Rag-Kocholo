        "text": "George Timothy Clooney was born on May 6, 1961, in Lexington, Kentucky, to Nina Bruce (née Warren), a former beauty pageant queen, and Nick Clooney, a former anchorman and television host (who was also the brother of singer Rosemary Clooney). He has Irish, English, and German ancestry. Clooney spent most of his youth in Ohio and Kentucky, and graduated from Augusta High School. He was very active in sports such as basketball and baseball, and tried out for the Cincinnati Reds, but was not offered a contract.\n\nAfter his cousin, Miguel Ferrer, got him a small role in a feature film, Clooney began to pursue acting. His first major role was on the sitcom E/R (1984) as Ace. More roles soon followed, including George Burnett, the handsome handyman on The Facts of Life (1979); Booker Brooks, a supervisor on Roseanne (1988); and Detective James Falconer on Ein Strauß Töchter (1991). Clooney had his breakthrough when he was cast as Dr. Doug Ross on the award-winning drama series Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994), opposite Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle and Julianna Margulies.\n\nWhile filming \"ER\" (1994), Clooney starred in a number of high profile film roles, such as Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), and Tage wie dieser... (1996), opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. In 1997, Clooney took on the role of Batman in Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin (1997). The film was a moderate success in the box office, but was slammed by critics, notably for the nipple-laden Batsuit. Clooney went on to star in Steven Soderbergh's Out of Sight (1998), Terrence Malick's Der schmale Grat (1998), and David O. Russell's Three Kings - Es ist schön König zu sein (1999).\n\nIn 1999, Clooney left \"ER\" (1994) (though he would return for the season finale) and appeared in a number of films, including O Brother, Where Art Thou? - Eine Mississippi-Odyssee (2000), Der Sturm (2000) and Ocean's Eleven (2001). Collaborating once again with Steven Soderbergh, Ocean's Eleven (2001) received critical acclaim, earned more than $450 million at the box office, and spawned two sequels: Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's 13 (2007).\n\nIn 2002, Clooney made his directorial debut with Geständnisse - Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), an adaptation of TV producer Chuck Barris' autobiography. This was the first film under the banner of Section Eight Productions, a production company he founded with Steven Soderbergh. The company also produced many acclaimed films, including Dem Himmel so fern (2002), Syriana (2005), A Scanner Darkly - Der dunkle Schirm (2006) and Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005). Clooney won his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Syriana (2005), and was nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005).\n\nIn 2006, Section Eight Productions was shut down so that Soderbergh could concentrate on directing, and Clooney founded a new production company, Smokehouse Productions, with his friend and longtime business partner, Grant Heslov.\n\nClooney went on to produce and star in Michael Clayton (2007) (which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor), directed and starred in Ein verlockendes Spiel (2008), and took leading roles in Burn After Reading (2008), Männer, die auf Ziegen starren (2009), Der fantastische Mr. Fox (2009), and Jason Reitman's Up in the Air (2009). Clooney received critical acclaim for his performance in Up in the Air (2009) and was nominated for several awards, including a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award. He didn't win that year, but took home both Best Actor awards (as well as countless nominations) for his role as a father who finds out his wife was unfaithful as she lays in a coma in Alexander Payne's The Descendants - Familie und andere Angelegenheiten (2011). Through his career, Clooney has been heralded for his political activism and humanitarian work. He has served as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace since 2008, has been an advocate for the Darfur conflict, and organized the Hope for Haiti telethon, to raise money for the victims of the 2010 earthquake. In March 2012, Clooney was arrested for civil disobedience while protesting at the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\nClooney was married to actress Talia Balsam, from 1989 until 1993. After their divorce, he swore he would never marry again. Michelle Pfeiffer and Nicole Kidman bet him $10,000 that he would have children by the age of 40, and sent him a check shortly after his birthday. Clooney returned the funds and bet double or nothing he wouldn't have children by the age of 50. Although he has remained a consummate bachelor, Clooney has had many highly publicized relationships, including with former WWE wrestler Stacy Keibler. In 2014, he married lawyer and activist Amal Clooney, with whom he has two children, twins.\n\nJudy Sheindlin (born under the name Judith Susan Blum) is an American court show arbitrator and television producer from Brooklyn, New York City. She is also a former prosecutor and family court judge. She presided over the long-running court show \"Judge Judy\" (1996-2021), which \"adjudicated real-life small-claims disputes within a simulated courtroom set\". It was the highest Nielsen-rated court show for 25 years. She subsequently presided over \"Judy Justice\" (2021-), the first standard courtroom series to broadcast new episodes exclusively through a streaming service.\n\nIn 1942, Sheindlin was born in Brooklyn to a Jewish family. Her ancestors were primarily German Jews and Russian Jews. Her father was the dentist Murray Blum. Her mother, Ethel, worked as an office manager. Sheindlin received her secondary education at the James Madison High School, an elite public high school located in the Madison subsection of the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn. The high school offers students an education in the workings of American legal institutions. Sheindlin graduated in 1960.\n\nSheindlin started her college education at the American University, a private research university which was located in Washington, D.C. The university has been affiliated with the United Methodist Church since its foundation, but religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission. Sheindlin graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in government.\n\nSheindlin finished her law school education at the New York Law School, a private law school located in Tribeca, New York City. She earned her Juris Doctor degree in 1965, and passed the New York state bar examination within the same year. She was soon hired as as a corporate lawyer by a cosmetics firm. She worked for them until 1967.\n\nIn 1964, Sheindlin had married her first husband Ronald Levy. Levy later became a prosecutor in juvenile court. They had two children within the first years of their marriage. In 1967, Sheindlin resigned from her job to focus for a while in the upbringing of her young children. This marriage lasted until 1976, and ended in a divorce.\n\nIn 1972, Sheindlin became a prosecutor in the New York family court system. In her role as a lawyer, Sheindlin prosecuted child abuse cases, domestic violence and juvenile crime. She acquired a reputation for her \"no-nonsense\" attitude. In 1977, she married the judge Jerry Sheindlin. She helped raise her three stepchildren, two of which pursued legal careers of their own.\n\nIn 1982, Sheindlin was appointed as a criminal court judge by Ed Koch, the Mayor of New York City (1924-2013, term 1978-1989). In 1986, she was promoted to the rank of the supervising judge in the family court's Manhattan division. She acquired a reputation for toughness and harshness in her new role. In 1993, Sheindlin was the subject of an article in the \"Los Angeles Times\". This helped her gain celebrity status. She was soon featured in a segment on \"60 Minutes\". She started work on her first book: \"Don't Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It's Raining\" (1996).\n\nSheindlin retired as a judge in 1996. She had reportedly heard more than 20,000 cases in her career. She accepted an offer to preside in a new reality courtroom series, which became the ratings hit \"Judge Judy\". Her viewers reportedly liked to see \"wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure\". Sheindlin won several awards and honors over the following two decades. In 2006, she received her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nIn March 2011, Sheindlin was hospitalized after suffering a a mini-stroke. This did not prevent her from renewing her contract, or from negotiating an annual salary increase. She signed her new contract in May 2011. In August 2017, she renewed her contract for \"Judge Judy\" for the final time. By 2020, Sheindlin had decided that she would end her show at the time of its 25th season anniversary. The decision was motivated in part by her increasingly poor relationship with the conglomerate ViacomCBS, and by legal disputes with the talent agency Rebel Entertainment.\n\n\"Judge Judy\" broadcast its final episode in July 2021. By that time, Sheindlin had started work in the production of her new show, \"Judy Justice\". Its first episode was broadcast in November 2021. The program aired its first-run episodes through the streaming service Amazon Freevee. Sheindlin credited her young adult granddaughter with providing input for this show's format. A second season was scheduled to appear in November 2022.\n\nBy 2022, Sheindlin was 80-years-old. Though she has considered retirement from television at various point, she has been reluctant to follow through with her retirement plans. She has admitted in past interviews that she feels engaged by her work, and that she considers herself able to still reach an audience. After a show business career of 26 years, she has become one of the most acclaimed figures in American television.\n\nU2 has been perhaps the biggest music act in the world since the late 1980s to the current day. They take prominent stands on human rights issues, expressed through their lyrics and other public statements and actions. The band's lead singer, Bono, has become quite prominent in charity movements and has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. The band consists of Bono, lead singer and songwriter; The Edge, lead guitar, keyboards, vocals; Adam Clayton, bass guitar; Larry Mullen Jr., drums. Their manager is Paul McGuinness (1978-2013).\n\nThe band formed in Dublin, Ireland, in 1976. The three members who strongly identified themselves as Christians (all except Clayton) decided to pursue and promote the band's career in a manner that would be consistent with their religious beliefs, which are heavy on social action. Theology professor Eugene Peterson says the band has \"little patience with media-driven aspects of the Christian religion and a church and culture that shows little concern for justice and poverty and sickness\".\n\nThe band's popular 1983 song \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" commemorated the slaughter of innocent civilians during the Irish troubles. It called for a renunciation of violence, a sentiment that resonated greatly with the people of Ireland. Throughout the 1980s, the band used this song to campaign against the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) efforts to raise money to fuel continued armed conflict. The IRA sent a threat to U2 that if they continued their campaign, they would be kidnapped. The band continued anyway. The band's 1984 album \"Unforgettable Fire\" was named after paintings made by the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs. The album's songs \"Pride\" and \"MLK\" were both tributes to the modern-day leader they most admire, Martin Luther King. Another song, \"Bad\", was about heroin addiction, which was a serious problem in their hometown of Dublin at that time.\n\nU2 were major participants in the historic and seminal \"Live Aid\" concert of 1985, which raised funds for relief from a severe drought in Ethiopia. The band was seen by many of the 1.5 billion people who viewed the concert on live television, and Bono's unscripted leap into the crowd captured the imagination of all. The more than 75 performing groups raised some $250 million for the charity. In the months following the concert, U2's record sales skyrocketed and have never come back down. In 1986, the band headlined a promotional tour to support Amnesty International, and the effort reportedly tripled the organization's membership.\n\nIn the 1990s, the band's music and concerts mocked the excesses of commercialism. Some critics failed to understand that Bono's exaggerated on-stage personas during the \"Zoo TV\" tour were parodies, and thus concluded that the band had given in to what they in fact were criticizing. In the early 2000s, U2 shifted from stadium extravaganzas to performing in smaller arenas where they were closer to their audiences. In 2004, the band teamed up with iPod for an innovative promotional campaign.\n\nU2 continues their work for charity and social action. They promoted the Northern Ireland Peace Accords, raised money for the survivors of the Omagh bombing, played in devastated Sarajevo following the war there, helped bolster the shaky economy of New York City by playing there following the September 11 terrorist attacks, participated in the Live 8 series of concerts to relieve Third World debt, and continue to promote the Make Poverty History campaign. Bono has become prominent in efforts to end poverty and seek relief from AIDS and promote trade for Africa. He has become quite celebrated for these efforts apart from his music and he often finds himself publicly hobnobbing with presidents and finance ministers to promote these charitable ends.\n\nU2 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. By that year, they had won 22 Grammy awards, a historic record surpassed only by Stevie Wonder.\n\nColdplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1996. They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey. They met at University College London and began playing music together from 1996 to 1998, first calling themselves Pectoralz and then Starfish.\n\nAfter independently releasing an extended play, Safety (1998), the band signed with Parlophone in 1999. Their debut album, Parachutes (2000), included their breakthrough single \"Yellow\" and received a Brit Award for British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and a Mercury Prize nomination. Their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), won the same accolades and included the singles \"The Scientist\" and \"Clocks\", with the latter winning a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Troubled production of the band's third album, X&Y (2005), saw them explore new musical territory with their fourth album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008); both were the best-selling albums of the year worldwide in 2005 and 2008 respectively, topping the charts in over 30 countries. Viva la Vida also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album and the band's first Album of the Year nomination, while its title track became the first single by a British group to top the charts in both the United Kingdom and United States in the 21st century.\n\nSince then, Coldplay further diversified their sound with the subsequent releases Mylo Xyloto (2011), Ghost Stories (2014), A Head Full of Dreams (2015), Everyday Life (2019) and Music of the Spheres (2021). Each album presented a unique theme and added new musical styles to the band's original repertoire, including electronica, ambient, pop, R&B, funk, classical, jazz fusion, and progressive rock. They are also known for \"euphoric\" live performances, with critics stating are when the band \"make the most sense\". To celebrate their 20th anniversary in 2018, a career-spanning documentary directed by Mat Whitecross was premiered at selected cinemas, featuring previously unseen behind-the-scenes footage.\n\nWith 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay are the most successful band of the 21st century and one of the best-selling music acts of all time. According to Fuse, they are also the sixth-most awarded group in history. Other notable achievements include the sixth-highest-grossing tour of all time, three of the 50 highest-selling albums ever in the United Kingdom, the most number-one records in the country without ever missing the top, most nominations and wins for a band in Brit Awards history, and becoming the first British group to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. Coldplay are considered one of the most influential bands of the 21st century as well, with Forbes describing them as the standard for the current alternative scene. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included A Rush of Blood to the Head on their \"200 Definitive Albums\" list and the single \"Yellow\" is part of their \"Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\" exhibition for being one of the most successful and important recordings in the industry. In spite of their popularity and impact, Coldplay have earned a reputation as polarizing music icons.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on February 5, 1985, in Madeira, Portugal to Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro and José Diniz Aveiro. Cristiano has an elder brother, Hugo and two elder sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia. His name was inspired by the former US-president, Ronald Reagan, whom his father was influenced by.\n\nThe island of Madeira was also the place where Cristiano first learned to master his skills as a footballer. He spent his early years playing for his local team, Nacional, and by the time he turned 12 years old, he already made his name for himself as one of Madeira's top footballers . It wasn't long before he started to catch the attention of other big Portuguese clubs. Among Sporting was Benfica, a team Cristiano and his father followed as a young boy. However he eventually chose to play for Sporting which was a team his mother loved and followed as she was growing up, to play with the likes of Figo was the dream for her son.\n\nHe was then spotted by former Liverpool manager, Gerard Houllier at the age of sixteen but Liverpool had no intentions to sign him at that time because they thought he was too young and he needed more time to develop his skills. However, in the summer of 2003, when Sporting played against Manchester United and defeated them, Cristiano caught the attention of Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nRonaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player. Initially, he requested for the number 28 as his jersey number because he didn't feel that he could live up to the pressure of previous players such as George Best and David Beckham who wore the number 7 jersey.\n\nThe year 2006 to 2008 proved to be a rather controversial year for the star. In the 2006 World Cup, Cristiano faced accusations regarding his sportsmanship. In a quarter-final match against England, he was heavily criticized for sending of his club team mate, Wayne Rooney who was playing for the England team. It wasn't too long until fans started accepting Cristiano again. In 2007, he won PFA Young Player of the Year, PFA Player of the Year, PFA Fans' Player of the Year, Portuguese Footballer of the Year, FWA Footballer of the Year, Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year and Manchester United's Players' Player of the Year. The year 2008 also saw him taking back the PFA Player Of The Year Award for the second time running. That same year, Ronaldo also had to deal with controversies regarding his club transfer to Spanish giants, Real Madrid. He eventually chose to stay with Manchester United and stressed to the public that he had no intentions of leaving the club.\n\nCristiano now lives with his cousin, Nuno and his brother in law Ze. When he is not on the field, he is a very family oriented person. Growing up, when he was about to choose football as his career, he said that it was very difficult for him as that would mean lesser time with his family, especially his mother, whom he says play a major role in his life.\n\nDuring his free time, Cristiano enjoys cooking. He mentioned in an interview that he usually cooks before he leaves for his soccer practice. Because he is constantly training, Cristiano rarely has time to watch TV. If he does get the time to watch, he says he loves watching one of the local Portuguese game show which is mostly about trivia questions. Cristiano is an avid learner and he takes interest in learning new things everyday. Among Cristiano's biggest pet peeves are smoking, people who don't make an effort and dishonesty.\n\nWhen the tsunami hit South East Asia, Cristiano flew to Indonesia to help those in need.

Robert's father is of half Lithuanian Jewish, one quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one quarter Irish, descent, while Robert's mother was of English, Scottish, German, and Swiss-German ancestry. Robert and his sister, Allyson Downey, were immersed in film and the performing arts from a very young age, leading Downey Jr. to study at the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York, before moving to California with his father following his parents' 1978 divorce. In 1982, he dropped out of Santa Monica High School to pursue acting full time. Downey Sr., himself a drug addict, exposed his son to drugs at a very early age, and Downey Jr. would go on to struggle with abuse for decades.\n\nDowney Jr. made his debut as an actor at the age of five in the film Pound (1970), written and directed by his father, Robert Downey Sr.. He built his film repertoire throughout the 1980s and 1990s with roles in Love-Fighters - Tuff Turf (1985), L.I.S.A. - Der helle Wahnsinn (1985), Das dreckige Spiel (1989), and Die Wonder Boys (2000) among many others.
