        "text": "This blogger Artur Yanturin of Russia copied many of my blog teams. This blog was one of them. It was my Russia All-Time Team here. His team was written in 2020, but mine was uploaded in 2014. This entry of his was written in October 21, 2020, but mine was uploaded in a few weeks before his 2020. Another entry of his was written in October 2020, but mine was uploaded in 2017. His entry of the Dutch-German rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona was written in 2020, but mine was uploaded in 2014. He also copied many many of my blog entries.\n\nHis Facebook and Instagram\n\nIreland vs Northern Ireland 1978\n\nPlease also see my All-Time World Cup Team Index.\n\nI have also create all-time teams for both Ireland and Northern Ireland. My all-timeteam for the United kingdom is here.\n\nEnglish-born players capped by other national teams Ireland/Northern Ireland Combined Team 1986 World Cup\n\nFrom 1882 to 1950, the name Ireland national team was used by the Irish Football Association (IFA). It consisted of players from the entire Ireland. After the partition of Ireland in the 1920s, another team was organized by Football Association of Ireland (FAI). They also competed with the name Ireland from 1937 and 1952. So two different team was playing as Ireland in the period and some players were playing for both teams. In 1953, the FAI was officially recognized as Ireland while the national team by IFA became Northern Ireland. Due to the complexity of Irish question, players who played for any of the Ireland national team are eligible to be on this team.\n\nI do not know enough about Irish politics and the football world to see if it is possible to have a combined team for the Island of Ireland, but George Best famously called for an unified team throughout his career. Meanwhile, Irish Rugby Football Union and Hockey Ireland have created combined national teams for their sports without any problem.\n\nN.Ireland vs Ireland\n\nThis is my selection of the Republic of Ireland/Northern Ireland Combined team.
