I am the night. I am Batman.\" From the Golden Age (1939-1960s) to the Rebirth Era (2016-present), Bat-Man's profoundly human, all too human evolution has captured the popular imagination like no other superhero. The Avenger of the Night exemplifies the complexity of the human spirit in a manner unparalleled in the world of comics. This course examines the philosophical dimensions of the Dark Knight's graphic novels. We explore the fear and loathing that both plagues Gotham and gives birth to the World's Greatest Detective. Additionally, we venture into the rich cultural iconography of the Caped Crusader in television, film, and the animated series. This course offers students a unique opportunity to sharpen their skills in public speaking, literary and philosophical analysis, creative expression, and multimedia presentation. Some of the key questions we answer include: What is Batman's ethical code? What do Batman's villains tell us about the human condition? How did the death of Batman's parents move him towards fighting crime rather than becoming a criminal himself? Unmask the philosophy behind the hero and gain a deeper understanding of the multifaceted world of the Gotham Guardian.\n\nPOLS 243: Fake News, Free Speech\n\n(Fake News, Free Speech and Foreign Influence in American Democracy.)

In this course, we examine this phenomenon thoroughly and critically via an interdisciplinary approach. While our focus is largely on the contemporary United States, we also engage with analogous international cases. While we approach this topic historically, empirically, and theoretically, our main goal is to assess what kinds of identity-based claims (if any) are best suited for the healthy functioning of a liberal and diverse democracy. Prerequisite: POLS 120. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.)\n\nRELG 224: Islam and Science\n\nAs an introduction to the relationship between Islam and science from both historical and contemporary perspectives, this course examines the major contributions of medieval Muslim scientists and their influence on modern science. Muslim medieval inventions and advances have shaped Western science for hundreds of years. Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Al-Haitham (Alhazen), al-Khawarizmi (Algorithmi), and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) were among the many Muslim scientists and philosophers who developed existing disciplines in astronomy, medicine, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and transferred ancient knowledge from the Middle East, Greece, China, and India to European cultures. The course explores various scientific attempts at an interpretation of the Qur'an and how those attempts shaped the Muslim perception of science in general. The course also touches upon modern debates within Islamic and applied science, particularly in the field of bioethics. Focusing on contemporary controversies, the course examines, for example, attempts by contemporary Muslim scientists and religious scholars to reconcile or disprove the theory of evolution. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements.)\n\ncross listed: ISLM 224\n\nSOAN 240: Deviance\n\nHow society defines deviants - its outcasts and outsiders - and how the people so defined respond to this categorization; the nature of normal and abnormal, legal and illegal. Do these categories have absolute moral meaning, or do they always depend on the particular society and era in which they are defined? Topics to be addressed include stigma and stereotyping, cross-cultural variations in gender roles, the status of the inmate, deviance as blocked opportunity, and the political mobilization of outsiders. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences and Domestic Pluralism requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science and Cultural Diversity requirements.)\n\nCOLL 150 (0.5 cr): Data Analytics using Excel\n\nIn this course, students learn basic and intermediate Microsoft Excel skills to help them analyze data and model outcomes.

(Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Quantitative Reasoning requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.)\n\nNEUR 118: Our Amazing Brain\n\nThis course will introduce students to the science behind how a human brain functions and produces behaviors. This amazing organ is composed of billions of neurons that form trillions of connections with each other. These neurons allow us to sense and perceive the world around us, integrate new experiences with old ones, form thoughts and actions, and develop consciousness and personality. In this course, students will discover how brain dysfunction is the root cause of many illnesses, including addiction, schizophrenia, depression, cancer, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. Students will also have the opportunity to work with preserved brains. No prior experience with science is required to succeed in this course. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences requirement.

This course is about the changing nature of warfare conducted by the U.S. government and other state actors in the 21st Century. We review international law as it relates to conventional warfare and non-kinetic hostilities such as cybernetic actions between states, along with the political responses. We investigate the history and development of the U.S. military forces after 1940, in conjunction with the development of communication, computational and autonomous technologies. We examine the justification of the use of military force by political speakers and analyze them within a legal and ethical framework. This course integrates international law, international norms and analysis of public policies of the U.S. and other states to provide a framework for the use of military force in the 21st Century. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences and Speaking requirements.)\n\nPOLS 281: American Democracy Today: Crisis and Reform\n\nThe United States is one of the least democratic republics in the world today. Anti-majoritarian institutions – such as the U.S. Senate, which assigns two seats to each state regardless of population, the Senate filibuster and cloture rules, the Electoral College, extreme political gerrymandering, and the country's first-past-the-post, winner-take-all election system – impede majority rule. Democratic theorists agree that certain limits on majority rule are necessary to protect the rights of the minority and prevent the \"tyranny of the majority.\" The problem with America's anti-majoritarian institutions is that they entrench minority rule, which makes it very difficult for majorities to advance their shared political interests democratically. This \"tyranny of the minority\" is dangerous because it undermines the legitimacy of the American system of government. This course investigates the causes and consequences of America's democracy deficit and offers remedies for forging a more perfect Union in the form of a majoritarian political system for the 21st century. No Prerequisites.\n\nPSYC 150: Foundations of Experimental Psych\n\n(Foundations of Experimental Psychology.) Foundations of Experimental Psychology is designed to develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of experimental research in psychology. In this course, students gain experience with reviewing primary research articles, identifying the fundamental components of experimental design, replicating classic experiments, completing descriptive and inferential statistical analyses using SPSS, and communicating scientific research. This course is delivered via an online platform with video tutorials, readings, practice activities, quizzes, and a final exam. The course is self-paced and requires regular, independent work by the student. The instructor hosts several office hours to provide support for students as needed. The course is intended to be a skills-building and preparatory course for subsequent enrollment into PSYC 221L (Research Methods & Statistics I), particularly for students who have not completed a laboratory-based introduction to psychological science course. Students who have taken PSYC 110L will not receive credit for this course. This 0.25-credit course is graded Pass-Fail and has no prerequisites."
