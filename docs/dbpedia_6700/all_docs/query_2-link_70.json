        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarlin and Nemo are both clownfish. They each have three white stripes outlined in black and look like carbon copies of each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are 30 recognized species of clownfish. Marlin and Nemo are Ocellaris clownfish, a type of orange clownfish that live in sea anemones, just like in the movie.\n\nThis type of clownfish is typically 3 to 4 inches long with bright orange coloring and white stripes outlined in black.\n\nClownfish are covered in a thin layer of mucus, making them immune to the sting of their anemone homes (a habitat, in the definition of a symbiotic relationship, the clownfish cannot survive without). The tiny fish eat the algae off the anemone and provide nutrients through waste, while the anemone provides natural protection for the clownfish against predators with its stinging tentacles.\n\nClownfish are also considered native to the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoral, Nemo's mother, and Marlin had over 400 baby fish eggs they were protecting in the beginning of the movie.\n\nMarlin and Coral lay their eggs near the sea anemone they call home. Before a barracuda attack kills Coral and all of their eggs except one, Marlin and Coral joke about naming all of their children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn average, clownfish can lay up to 1,000 eggs.\n\nOn average, clownfish can lay between 100 and 1,000 eggs, according to LiveScience, so Marlin and Coral's egg number is on the lower side.\n\nThat said, clownfish do lay their eggs near their sea anemone or coral habitats in batches, just like in \"Finding Nemo.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruce, a great white shark, has several rows of animated teeth in the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost shark species have several rows of teeth.\n\nIn the movie, Bruce is a great white shark, which typically has around 300 teeth. Sharks are constantly shedding and growing new teeth.\n\nBruce's supposedly fish-tolerant shark friends, Chum and Anchor, are a mako shark and a hammerhead shark, respectively. It's worth pointing out that most sharks hunt alone, so Chum, Anchor, and Bruce would probably not be hanging out together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Finding Nemo,\" Dory becomes fascinated by a glowing light that belongs to an anglerfish.\n\nDory becomes fascinated by the light (her \"squishy\") and follows it until she realizes it's on the end of the dorsal fin of a very terrifying anglerfish trying to eat her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anglerfish's glowing \"lure\" has a bewitching effect on fish.\n\nAnglerfish use their signature and natural lure to hook tasty pray into their orbit. The lure is a piece of dorsal spine that hovers above females and appears similar to a fishing hook with a juicy, glowing worm at the end.\n\nThe male anglerfish, on the other hand, assumes an appearance quite different than the female. Generally, the male anglerfish is much smaller and goes without the female's captivating appendage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarlin and Dory must swim through a trench in the ocean to get to Sydney, Australia.\n\nDory and Marlin are told by a school of moonfish to go through the trench to reach Sydney, Australia. They say not to go over because of the jellyfish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrenches and canyons are common on the ocean floor.\n\nTrenches, which are steep-sided structures formed by the Earth's shifting tectonic plates, are very much what they look like in \"Finding Nemo\": extremely dark and deep.\n\nThese depressions in the oceanic floor can occur as far down as 24,000 feet to 36,000 feet from the water's surface.\n\nThe one Marlin and Dory swam through was likely a submarine canyon, and not quite as deep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarlin must get through a sea of jellyfish in the film to save Dory.\n\nHe makes it through even though he appears to get stung multiple times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Marlin was pretty well prepared to take on jellyfish as a clownfish.\n\nThe sting of a jellyfish can be deadly — but maybe not for a prepared clownfish.\n\nJellyfish are in the same phylum as sea anemones, where clownfish make their home. Both jellyfish and sea anemones are cnidarians, classified as an organism with an opening with a ring of tentacles surrounding it.\n\nIf you want to get technical, jellyfish are in the medusa phase (a free-swimming structure) while anemones are in the polyp phase (an attaching structure).\n\nThe layer of mucus on a clownfish that protects them from sea anemones could be what protected Marlin in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDory and Marlin meet friendly sea turtles and take the East Australian Current as a sort of underwater highway.\n\nCrush the sea turtle tells Marlin and Dory that the EAC will help them reach Sydney faster. In the movie, it looks like a type of warp-speed highway for aquatic life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe East Australian Current is real and actually traveled by fish in the summer.\n\nThe East Australian Current, or EAC, is a very real thing, according to The Conversation. The current on the east side of the Australian coast that flows in a southward direction from the Great Barrier Reef. EAC transports more than 40 million cubic meters of water each second.\n\nAs for fish \"riding\" the EAC the way they do in the movie, some scientists say they have seen tropical fish \"hitching a ride\" on the current, though it is not quite as fast as it appears in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDory speaks whale in \"Finding Nemo.\"\n\nIn one of the most famous scenes from the movie, Dory says she is able to speak whale, oscillating her tones to mimic a whale's sonar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhales and fish do communicate by speaking their own language, of sorts. (Though Dory's version is definitely played up for laughs.)\n\nA (somewhat) accurate fact, whales communicate by using sonar waves, which is part of their echolocation abilities, or using distinct sounds to discern surroundings. Sperm whales, one study says, could have their own language that varies by each clan.\n\nFish also communicate through specific sounds, most commonly fish and invertebrates communicate via clicks and rhythmic noises — including grunts, croaks, and snaps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScuba divers like Dr. Sherman who capture marine life for sport are doing a disservice to these habitats.\n\nPoaching, which is different than mere recreational diving, can be a scourge to marine life, especially in the endangered Great Barrier Reef.\n\nLike the Aussie dentist, Dr. Sherman, poachers and divers who usurp marine life for their own purposes can severely damage the thriving ecosystem that is the Reef, notably by bringing in foreign influences and disturbing the natural state of the environment.\n\nJust like Dr. Sherman didn't realize he was separating Marlin and Nemo, humans may not realize we're damaging aquatic wildlife.\n\nRead the original article on INSIDER.
