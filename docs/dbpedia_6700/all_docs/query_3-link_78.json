Important figures spanned both centuries, and the genres, literary groups, and methods of criticism they established in the 19th century continued into the 20th. For example, Junimea (“Youth”), the literary circle Titu Maiorescu founded in 1863, reacted against the prevailing interest in literary form at the expense of content and pointed toward a later reassessment of the uses of literature. Playwright Ion Luca Caragiale died in 1912 but was relevant to the 20th century as the creator of Romanian social comedy. His satirical sketches are more",

        "text": "Between the wars\n\nIn the period of national unity following World War I, the novel began to compete with lyrical poetry. Writers took inspiration from society or recent events, principally the war. Liviu Rebreanu wrote about the peasants’ difficult lot and the need for the redistribution of land; Răscoala (1932; The Uprising) described the Romanian peasant uprising of 1907. His best work, Pădurea spînzuraƫilor (1922; The Forest of the Hanged), was inspired by his brother’s fate during World War I. In it, he describes the tragedy of a Romanian soldier forced to turn against his own people as a member of the Austro-Hungarian army. He tries to flee but is caught and hanged as a deserter.\n\nThis relationship between war and the individual, as well as the struggle of intellectuals caught up in the pressure of historical events, provides the material for Camil Petrescu’s great novel Ultima noapte de dragoste, întîia noapte de război (1930; “The Last Night of Love, the First Night of War”), as well as for a number of Cezar Petrescu’s novels and even some of Ion Minulescu’s poems. Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu’s trilogy of novels (Fecioarele despletite [1926; “Disheveled Virgins”], Concert din muzică de Bach [1927; “A Bach Concert”], and Drumul ascuns [1933; “The Hidden Way”]) is a document of changing lifestyles and urbanization, similar to the writings of novelist Ionel Teodoreanu. Victor Popa wrote about rural subjects, while G.M. Zamfirescu’s protagonists were typical Bucharest citizens, and D.D. Pătrăscanu wittily described political life.\n\nThe leading writer of this period was Mihail Sadoveanu, who, together with I.A. Brătescu-Voineşti, represented a link with the older generation of Romanian authors. Sadoveanu wrote about the historical role of the peasantry and an almost mythologized village life, as well as about the peasants’ adoption of a modern lifestyle. He remains arguably the most important Romanian historical novelist of the 20th century.\n\nScholars, philosophers, critics, and translators also made contributions to the literary and intellectual life of the period. The archaeologist Vasile Pârvan commemorated the sacrifices of the war generation in Parentalia (1922); the historian and politician Nicolae Iorga founded literary periodicals and a people’s university (an adult education centre unaffiliated with the Romanian general educational system), wrote literary works, and was a great influence on the development of a national identity; the geographer Simion Mehedinƫi edited a journal and published bucolic short stories; and Dimitrie Gusti established a school of sociology that had a decidedly nationalistic and village-centred disposition. Poet and essayist Lucian Blaga attempted to provide a philosophical foundation for the description of Romanian national characteristics, partly determined by geographical conditions, while Gala Galaction translated the Bible and wrote novels on biblical subjects.\n\nLyrical poetry of a considerable stylistic variety became the leading genre in Romanian literature after World War I. The diversity of styles can be illustrated by Nichifor Crainic’s religious traditionalist tendency, the programmatic esoterica of Ion Barbu (who was also an internationally renowned mathematician), the influence of French and German lyric poetry on Ion Pillat, and the bitter Symbolist poetry of George Bacovia. After Eminescu, who remained influential throughout the 20th century, it was Tudor Arghezi who brought about a real rejuvenation in Romanian lyric poetry. In his poems language acquires an exceptional expressiveness and harmony, and the traits of Symbolism and philosophical aspirations reach their high point. Of his volumes of poetry, Cuvinte potrivite (1927; “Suitable Words”), Flori de mucigai (1931; “Flowers of Mold”), and Cărticică de Seară (1935; “Booklet for the Evening”) are especially notable."
