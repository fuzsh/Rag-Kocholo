It was a pivotal moment for the studio, with the film marking many firsts and a few lasts. The first “last” to note about this one is rather sad; it was the last animated film to involve Walt, as he died of lung cancer late in the production on December 15th, 1966. Due to the disappointing reception of his previous feature, The Sword in the Stone, Walt was much more involved with the creation of this one than he had been for a long time – considering that, it’s such a shame he didn’t get to witness the success it enjoyed upon release. He purchased the rights to the original Kipling stories in 1963 and after some difficulties with the plotting and music (detailed below), the film was finally finished and released in 1967, their last release of the decade.\n\nThis marks the first time the Disney Company ventured into Asia in one of their stories – in fact, it was their first film to be set somewhere other than a western country or fantasy world since The Three Caballeros twenty-three years earlier. It was a refreshing change from the anglophile themes running through many of their recent features (think Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, One Hundred and One Dalmatians, The Sword in the Stone…), but it would also be their last film set outside of their favoured westernised/fantasy settings until Aladdin in 1992, so we’d better make the most of this change of cultural pace.\n\nThe Jungle Book also marks a personal milestone for me, as this was the oldest of the Disney classics that I actually grew up watching on VHS. For whatever reason, I didn’t see many Disney films as a kid, but I had this one from the beginning and loved it back then. I’m excited to explore this one as it really is one of the strongest of the Xerox-era films, so let’s get started!\n\nCharacters and Vocal Performances\n\nThe Jungle Book was unusual for an animated film of its time because it boasted a surprisingly star-studded cast of voice actors (it was also the first Disney film to list these voice actors with specific roles in the opening credits). For the first time, the performances of these actors also greatly influenced the character designs, a choice which some critics considered lazy, but it works so brilliantly here that this was clearly not the case. Thankfully, the filmmakers kept the original Kipling names for the characters, thus adding a small touch of culture to the film as many of the names are the Hindi words for the characters’ species, a technique also used later in The Lion King with its Swahili names. It is perhaps a little odd that none of the characters have Indian accents, but at least some of them having British ones does make sense as it fits the colonial time period (perhaps they avoided using Indian accents in order to avoid offensive stereotyping).\n\nOur lead here is a young boy named Mowgli, one of the many “every-boy” characters so beloved by Disney (Pinocchio, Arthur, Taran) and our first non-white lead – a pretty good milestone for 1967! Originally set to be played by David Alan Bailey, he was recast with another of director Reitherman’s sons (just one, this time) after Bailey’s voice broke – this is precisely what they should have done with Arthur in The Sword in the Stone, so it’s good to see they’d learned their lesson. Bruce Reitherman actually went on to a very nature-oriented career, with stints as a river guide, a field biologist, a naturalist, an expedition leader and a biological consultant, but is perhaps best known as a nature documentarian; perhaps his appearance in this film inspired this love of nature as an adult!\n\nMowgli is less of a cipher than the typical Disney protagonist of the time, with some complexity and depth to him which makes him a huge improvement over the last boy lead. His arc is that he is having a bit of an identity crisis as he tries to find his place in life; after being raised by wolves, he is aware that he’s different from the other denizens of the jungle, but having never met another human he’s at a loss as to what he actually is. Over the course of the film, he briefly tries life as a wolf, a panther, an elephant, a bear, an ape and even a vulture, demonstrating a tendency to latch onto each character he meets and imitating them in an “experimental” way as he tries to find his niche, until eventually he meets the girl at the end (imitating her too until he falls for her).\n\nMuch like the young Tarzan decades later, Mowgli has a lot of pluck and bravery; his response to being challenged by creatures as fearsome as elephants and tigers is mere annoyance! However, this bravery seems to stem from an innate naïveté, which runs almost to the point of stupidity at times – seriously, what chance does he think he has against a tiger, unarmed? Still, the great thing about Mowgli is that he’s relatable and sympathetic in a way that Arthur never was (seriously, that character was so poorly done) – you really care about him and can understand his hurt and confusion as various characters push him around and make decisions for him. It’s easy to feel sorry for him as he keeps ending up lost and alone, his gullibility making him vulnerable in a very real, childlike way, but you can also root for him because of the strength of character he demonstrates elsewhere: he’s strong, brave and stubborn, making him an engaging protagonist and a good focal point for the audience amidst the madness. Being animated largely by Ollie Johnston probably helped a great deal!\n\nJohnston was also responsible for much of Baloo’s animation and I think we can all agree on what a fantastic job he did. Baloo, a sloth bear (a very apt species for this guy), becomes Mowgli’s best friend over the course of the film and is easily one of the best characters here. The idea of casting Phil Harris in the role was Walt’s idea; he decided he’d be perfect for the fun-loving chap after hearing him performing at a Palm Springs benefit. At first the animators thought Walt’s idea was ridiculous and couldn’t imagine Harris as Baloo at all, but of course, they soon warmed up after hearing Harris’s hilarious improvisations during recording (that reminds me of Robin Williams and his similar treatment of the comic relief character in Aladdin decades later).\n\nBaloo is a marvellously compelling character, with a warm voice and strong, expressive animation all enhancing his screen presence from his first scene to his last. Unusually for a comic character, he even gets his own story arc, as he has to learn to become more responsible and selfless in order to allow Mowgli the best chance in life. This depth is what really makes Baloo so memorable; we all love his goofy antics, but he’s capable of carrying more serious scenes as well, lending him a sense of weight as we see him struggling with his emotions and making difficult decisions. Of course, it’s the fun side of him that we all love; he’s truly at his funniest during the palace rescue scenes as he’s quickly “infected” by the beat of Louie’s jazz, barging into the party disguised as (what I assume is) a female ape and joining a delighted Louie in a wacky dance routine before being revealed. I also love his random scratching scene in the middle of the Bare Necessities sequence; it adds nothing to the plot but is a whole lot of fun (even if the voice acting makes it sound hilariously sexual out of context; seriously, listen to that scene with your eyes shut, it’s so funny).\n\nOne other aspect that makes Baloo so enjoyable is his relationship with Bagheera, the third member of their little trio. These two have some excellent chemistry; an overzealous fan might even suggest that there’s a bit of gay subtext with them as their pairing parallels modern two-father families, bickering like an old married couple about what’s best for “their” child. Despite their clashing personalities, they clearly do care about one another, a point beautifully emphasised with the eulogy scene where Bagheera and Mowgli mourn the “loss” of their dear friend (who is secretly wide awake and revelling in Baggy’s fond words). They complement each other so well; Baloo is fun where Bagheera is a stick-in-the-mud, but Bagheera is responsible where Baloo is reckless and carefree.\n\nBagheera, voiced with aplomb by Sebastian Cabot, is a black panther (i.e. a melanistic leopard) who is perhaps Mowgli’s oldest friend, having been the one to first find him as a baby and ensuring his survival by taking him to the wolf pack. Bagheera is introduced to us as our narrator – he is the film’s voice of reason, the only sane “man” in a world of nutty characters. He’s is the polar opposite of Baloo in many ways; he is unselfish and practical but also rather grouchy and moody, acting as a kind of straight man to offset Baloo’s zaniness. Yet despite his rather inflexible character, he isn’t immune from the film’s comedy; when he’s forced to step out of his comfort zone (such as during the palace rescue), it’s all the funnier because of the sheer contrast with how he usually is. Like Baloo, he has greater depth to him than appears on the surface; for all of his bluster, we know that he is a loyal and reliable friend, as he is always quick to rush to Mowgli’s defence (except, strangely, during the final fight with Shere Khan) and deeply cares about his friends (again, look to the eulogy scene). Although he can come across as a bit of a buzzkill, he’s still a likeable bloke because he’s got clear motivations and feelings – and he’s a welcome piece of normality in such a crazy film.\n\nAfter the casting of Phil Harris, then-president of Disneyland Records Jimmy Johnson apparently suggested they cast Louis Prima as King Louie, as he “felt that Louis would be great as a foil.” King Louie is the only major character here not taken from the Kipling stories, instead being a creation of Disney’s entirely for the film. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he is also the only animal not to be native to the Indian subcontinent; he is an orangutan (presumably a Bornean one as they tend to be heftier) from the islands of Indonesia across the Bay of Bengal, which raises questions about how he ever came to be in this jungle at all. My guess is that he’s an escapee from captivity, perhaps the pampered pet of a maharajah, which would explain how he was imported across to India and why he seems to know so much about man and longs to live like them.\n\nAs a character, he’s enjoyable but not especially likeable, coming across as the sort of smooth-talker who you know is not to be trusted; as he sells his “pitch” to Mowgli about being human, complete with bananas as cigar stand-ins, there’s a hint of menace in his expressions and voice which make you wonder what’s in store for the man-cub should he fail to provide Louie with fire. I have to say, he reminds me a lot of Ariel – it’s a comparison I never expected to make, but watching the film again I was struck by the resemblance; two Disney redheads who long to be human, but with very different methods of achieving their goal. (Incidentally, please don’t Google “King Louie and Ariel,” there’s a whole weird mess of slavery fetish art with the pair of them… yeesh, some fans!). He has some fun interactions with his many monkey minions, especially the one with the palm frond (named Flunkey Monkey officially) who is feisty and spirited and won’t let Louie quash his “performance,” but the monkeys as a whole are not especially interesting. They serve their basic function; capturing Mowgli and then adding to the drama of the rescue later on.\n\nI suppose I can’t discuss King Louie without referring to the “racism” controversy, but just like the crows in Dumbo, this is another occasion where I really think people are reading too much into the situation on screen. When I think of racism in Disney films – and it does exist in some of them – I think of Sunflower from Fantasia, or the Indians from Peter Pan. Characters like those are nothing more than blatant, offensive stereotypes which are clear and unfortunate products of their time, representing the ingrained social racism that was so prevalent in pre-Civil Rights days. But King Louie? People seem to like drawing comparisons between him and black jazz legend Louis Armstrong, who was rumoured to have been the original choice to play him (it’s said that Walt avoided this casting choice precisely because of the potential racism claims). As it is, though, he is played by an Italian-American white man, Louis Prima, so there’s no argument for the people who think that black actors were relegated to the part of apes; I mean, they weren’t present in the film at all, but that’s another issue. Prima is the clear influence in the character, as were most of the voice actors for the rest of the cast; King Louie doesn’t sound like he’s meant to be imitating any particular race, he’s just an energetic scat-man like Prima.\n\nNevertheless, the character has been widely criticised for functioning as Disney’s “commentary” on the Civil Rights movement of the time, with the ape being portrayed mockingly for his desire to step “above his place,” but I don’t see it that way at all. As I’ve already mentioned, I see Louie as a lot like Ariel – he’s not a black man being mocked for his desire for equality, he’s simply a delusional ape being mocked for the manipulative way he goes about trying to make himself human (Ariel is presented more sympathetically because her actions don’t involve threatening anyone to get what she wants). If you take the idea of him being a former pet into consideration, his desire to be human could even be read as extreme laziness; he’s so used to being spoiled by humans that he sees becoming one as a ticket back to the good life. I think the people who are reading the apes and monkeys in The Jungle Book as oppressed minorities are simply too eager to find fault with Disney films, to be honest. Racism in Disney does exist, but I don’t think it exists in this particular film – now sexism on the other hand, well, we’ll get to that soon…\n\nOne of the other less savoury characters Mowgli meets on his travels is Kaa, an Indian python (although he looks more like a reticulated python crossed with an anaconda, judging from his size) whose primary goal is to make a meal of the man cub. This role marked the return of Disney stalwart Sterling Holloway (yay!) in his first Disney film for over a decade (his last being the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland) as well as being his first time playing a villain in one. In the original stories, Kaa was a more complex character, acting as a mentor to Mowgli and even rescuing him from the monkey temple, but Walt felt that audiences wouldn’t accept a snake character on the “good” side and made him more overtly villainous; he also effectively replaces Tabaqui the Cowardly Jackal as the story’s secondary antagonist, after Shere Khan. Thanks to Holloway’s voice, he manages to be both sympathetic and sinister at the same time; he generally sounds rather sweet and even vulnerable, moaning like a hypochondriac about his s-s-s-sinuses and his “sacroiliac” (a joint in the hip; as a fun fact, boas and pythons, which are among the most primitive types of snake, actually do have remnants of hip bones called pelvic spurs).\n\nHowever, he’s also effectively menacing when he needs to be and it’s actually quite disturbing to hear the usually mild Holloway getting the occasional growl or snap into his voice here, showing more range than his usual roles allow. It’s worth noting that, of course, real pythons have no such hypnotic abilities – this probably stemmed from the idea of snake-charmers “hypnotising” their snakes – but it’s a fun piece of Kaa’s character all the same, making him less like a snake and more like a basilisk (any Harry Potter fans out there?).\n\nKaa was obviously a favourite with the animators as they could have a lot of fun with his shape, perhaps explaining why he gets two extended scenes with him attempting to eat Mowgli (you have to give the guy props; he comes closer to it than Shere Khan does). He’s quite a competent villain when you think about it, almost killing both Mowgli and Bagheera and only being “defeated” by the boy because he ends up getting distracted by another character both times. I find it fun to picture Winnie-the-Pooh (also voiced by Holloway) speaking Kaa’s lines when I watch this one; the two are so different from one another, yet Holloway was apparently recording dialogue for both characters at the same time! It’s also kind of creepy how paedophilic the character sounds out of context – just think of Kaa saying “Yes… a poor little helpless boy…” with that little grin on his face, then imagine him as a human. Brrr!\n\nShere Khan is our main antagonist of the piece, a suave and debonair Bengal tiger who aims to stamp Mowgli out before he’s old enough to become a threat to him. (I’m glad Disney chose to keep him as a tiger instead of turning him into an Asiatic Lion, as they so easily could have due to the “king of the jungle” stereotypes and the lion’s presence in India). He was voiced exceptionally by George Sanders (who was apparently the first Oscar-winning actor to voice a Disney character) and animated equally well by the legendary Milt Kahl. In a similar manner to the Queen of Hearts, he is introduced quite late in the picture, but there’s a crucial difference in the way these two are set-up – the Queen of Hearts isn’t even mentioned until about five minutes before she arrives, whereas Shere Khan is set up like the shark from Jaws with lots of fearful references and dark looks between the characters, establishing a strong presence before he even gets onto the screen. When he does, he manages to live up to that presence (not always easy to do) with his smooth charm and silkily dangerous voice, always calm and controlled and utterly confident in his ability to carry out his plan.\n\nAs with most of the characters in this film, it is the voice acting which really sells him; Sanders struck just the right balance between an affected English gentleman and a threatening man-eater, lending Shere Khan a level of sophistication that we haven’t really seen since Maleficent. He needs no henchmen, sidekicks, tricks or gimmicks to aid him; indeed, the very sight of his unsheathed claws is enough to strike terror into all but Mowgli, and his confidence is such that he is genuinely shocked when Mowgli stands up to him (I love the look on his face when the kid asks “Why should I run?”).\n\nIf I had to fault this fancy feline for anything, it would be that he is rather too easily defeated at the end. The filmmakers did have quite a task on their hands, admittedly; how does an unarmed child win a face-off with a freaking tiger? They introduce Baloo to the scene so Shere Khan can pick on someone his own size, but even this wasn’t enough as Baloo is obviously no fighter – in fact, he’s nearly taken down by the cat in one of the most frightening death fake-outs we’ve yet seen. In the end, Disney stuck with the novel’s original idea of the tiger having severe pyrophobia; he is apparently so scared of fire that simply tying a flaming tree branch to his tail is enough to send him packing, yet this feels at odds with his usual powerful persona. I suppose it is quite funny to see such a dignified villain fleeing like a timid little tabby, but it does take away somewhat from his overall impact.\n\nAmong the secondary characters, the most significant are the elephants and the vultures. The lead elephant is Colonel Hathi, a distinguished and pompous old war veteran who was apparently a member of the “Maharaja’s Fifth Pachyderm Brigade,” whatever that was. (He also states that he received the Victoria Cross, but no real animal ever has; the closest equivalent award is the Dickin Medal, sometimes known as the “animal’s Victoria Cross,” but that’s only been won by horses, dogs, pigeons and, once, a cat). Voiced with wonderful Britishness by J. Pat O’Malley (another Disney favourite by this time), he’s given a gruff and blustery demeanour which rivals even Bagheera’s, coming across as the stereotypical stubborn old man, set in his ways and confident in his position as leader of his herd. The joke with Hathi, of course, is that he’s a forgetful elephant – you know, an elephant never forgets and all that? While I do like his ramblings and mumblings to a point, I do find this character a bit of a nuisance after a while, especially since he gets several lengthy scenes which probably could have been shortened.\n\nI prefer his family, which includes the young elephant who is supposedly named “Junior” according to Disney, although he’s never referred to by this name on screen or in the credits. Little Junior has a limited role, serving mainly as Mowgli’s guide during the latter’s brief stint as an “elephant”; he instructs the man cub in how to act and Mowgli is somehow able to “disguise” himself well enough on the strength of Junior’s advice to avoid detection until Hathi is literally staring him in the face. For a minor character, Junior is an enjoyable presence, and even plays a small role in the plot when he manages to convince his father to help look for the missing Mowgli later on. I’m glad the filmmakers didn’t just make him a cheap copy of Dumbo, as it would have been so easy to do.\n\nOf the other elephants, the most notable is Junior’s mother and Hathi’s wife, Winifred, who is played by Verna Felton in her last Disney appearance before her death (which was the day before Walt’s passing, on December 14th, 1966). I love Verna Felton’s performances, and it’s rather fitting that this, her last, was as an elephant, because her first Disney character was the Matriarch, another grouchy elephant from Dumbo (although Winifred has a kinder heart). Winifred is the most significant female character in this whole film and the only named one, which says something about the representation of women here as she gets all of two scenes and perhaps a dozen lines. Her standout moment comes when she sticks up for Mowgli as her husband is prattling on about leaving him lost, pointing out to the old blowhard that the man cub is no different than their own child and that he has a responsibility to help find him. It’s interesting to point out that in real life, elephant herds have a matriarchal structure while males generally live alone, so despite Hathi’s indignation at the idea, Winifred really should be leading the herd!\n\nThe vultures, as I’m sure you’ve heard, were originally going to be played by the Beatles! However, John Lennon squashed this plan as he apparently disliked the idea of appearing in an animated film (even sarcastically suggesting Disney try asking Elvis as an alternative). Despite this, the group appeared in the animated Yellow Submarine the very next year; coincidentally, that was also the year of their big tour of India. Disney still managed to get a bit of that “British invasion” flavour in there, though, by casting Chad Stuart from the folk rock duo Chad and Jeremy as one of the vultures. On a sad note, in real life, the vultures of India have been undergoing what has become known as the “Indian vulture crisis” since about the 1980s, with a massive crash in the populations of all vulture species present in India due to poisoning from the consumption of the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, which is sometimes present in animal carcasses that have been treated with it.\n\nThese characters function as a collective group – it’s not that they don’t have their own personalities, but they never do anything in their scenes alone. Buzzie is the bald one who looks like the oldest, and he is the most proactive in trying to include Mowgli and make him feel welcome; he has the air of a kindly uncle, or perhaps that bloke from the pub who’ll help you get home when you’re drunk off your ass, while everyone else is hysterical at the sight of you. Dizzy, the leggy one with the moppiest mop of all the mop-tops in the film, is rather gloomy and seems to lack a sense of humour, but he does still take part in the big musical number and seems to relate to Mowgli more than the rest; it is he who points out that nobody wants the vultures around, either. Flaps (Chad Stuart) is the blonde, northern-sounding one who I assume is meant to be the youngest – his most notable trait is not being very bright, as we see when he engages in the back-and-forth with Buzzie over what the gang should do, putting forth no suggestions. Ziggy, the lively brown-haired one, does at least have a few suggestions which are all shot down by his more laconic friends, and it is he who first pushes them to approach Mowgli. Taken as a group, the vultures are essentially the same characters as the band of crows from Dumbo, initially attempting to joke with the downcast young hero before calming down enough to help him deal with his problems. They’re also distinctly different from the previous Disney vultures like those from Snow White, thank goodness! The vultures demonstrate the effectiveness of the film’s characterisation; even the most minor are given something to do and without the vultures’ help, Mowgli might never have overcome Shere Khan.\n\n(I also just want to make a quick mention here of a cut character who was supposed to appear in the vulture scenes, called Rocky the Rhino. He was to be voiced by Frank Fontaine and was going to be a sort of dumb jock character who the vultures would set against Mowgli for fun, but he ended up being cut for pacing reasons – probably for the best, as I think it might have made the vultures look a bit unsympathetic).\n\nMention should also be made of the wolves, but they play a drastically smaller part here than in the books. The only named ones are Rama and Akela, Mowgli’s father and pack leader respectively, but they really aren’t given much to do. Rama’s wife (who is named Raksha in the books but has no name or lines here at all) is nothing more than a standard loving mother figure – we see no more of her character than that in her one scene. It’s such a pity; she’s one of only three female characters in the film, after all. Rama himself is set up as though he’s going to be problematic (like Kerchak will be in Tarzan), but one look at baby Mowgli’s little face is enough to melt his canine heart. Rama and Akela then share a well-staged scene together with the rest of the pack where they discuss Mowgli’s future (without the boy himself even being present). The acting – both vocally and artistically – is nicely done here, but unfortunately once the scene ends the wolves are neither seen nor mentioned again, not once. These characters really needed better development; it’s one thing I think the 2016 remake did much better.\n\nThe final “character,” if she warrants that title, is the unnamed girl who finally succeeds in luring Mowgli into the man village at the end of the film. Darleen Carr (sometimes spelled Darlene) was supposedly cast on the strength of a demo recording she did of My Own Home; it’s just as well they liked her performance, because the girl’s lines consist solely of the song’s lyrics. She never speaks a word, interacting with Mowgli only through her music and her… well, allure. Seriously, why is a girl of this age being portrayed so seductively? She’s literally giving Mowgli bedroom eyes and they’re like, what, ten? There’s not much to be said here other than that I’m very frustrated that Disney were still limiting female characters to such narrow roles as this, even in the late 1960s as women’s liberation movements were blossoming. Why couldn’t the girl (who really needs a name – say what you will about the sequel, at least she becomes “Shanti” there) have a conversation with Mowgli, in the way that Jane does with Tarzan? The most positive thing I can say about her, and I’m really stretching here, is that she offers the only tiny glimpse of actual human culture (and thus, the only glimpse of Indian culture) in the whole film; for instance, I like the detail of the bindi dot on her forehead, which is a religious mark traditionally worn by Hindu women. Sadly, this would be the first and only look at this fascinating culture for many, many decades – not until 2015’s Sanjay’s Super Team from Pixar would we see the Disney Company taking a proper look at Hinduism in an animated work again.\n\nAnimation\n\nAlthough it became common for later Disney features to have individual animators working on individual characters, in The Jungle Book the animation was mainly done by sequence, with one animator handling all the characters who happened to be in a particular scene. As with the previous two films, the xerography process was used again, with Ken Anderson’s character designs employing rough, artistic edges that stand out a lot when you compare them with earlier Disney animals, like those in Dumbo. Milt Kahl based his animation of Bagheera and Shere Khan on real footage of live-action felines, which he viewed in two earlier Disney films called A Tiger Walks (1964) and the “Jungle Cat” episode (1960) of the True-Life Adventures series. Apparently, Shere Khan’s stripes proved to be a nightmare to animate, although presumably the xerography made it easier – once again, I have to give them credit for not turning him into a plainer Asiatic lion! In this film, though, the xerography was further refined in an attempt to bring greater artistry to the rather harsh style, by combining both Xeroxed cels with hand-inked ones. The animation of the girl in the final scenes, for instance, was largely Xeroxed, but her mouth was inked by hand (I don’t know why that specific part of her face received this honour, but still).\n\nThe character animation in this film is truly excellent, some of the best we’ve seen from Disney up to this point (and honestly some of the best they’ve ever produced). It’s all in the little details, like the facial expressions – pay attention to the characters’ eyes in particular; they get across a lot of different moods and emotions with the subtlest changes in the expression of the eyes. Imitation is a subtle theme running through the whole thing; Mowgli, as discussed above, has a habit of mimicking every animal he meets (except Shere Khan, for obvious reasons), even sticking his tongue out in childish imitation of Kaa when he first meets him, and one of the monkeys who kidnaps Mowgli has a great moment where he wiggles his snout in imitation of Baloo as the bear tries to shift an irksome fly. Small moments like these add a lot to the impression of the characters over the course of the film, which is a big part of what makes them so memorable after you finish watching.\n\nThis being the Xerox era, however, there is of course a lot of recycling going on (we’ll just have to learn to like it until we reach the Renaissance). Shere Khan seems to be hunting none other than Bambi’s mother in his first scene, and the staging of the rescue of Mowgli at Louie’s palace is practically identical to the Toad Hall scenes in The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949). That said, this rescue scene is probably the highlight of the animation, along with any scene involving Kaa, who was clearly a popular one with the animators due to the endless possibilities afforded by his shape. One small detail that stuck out to me was the jaunty four-legged “elephant” walk Mowgli does when he’s trying to copy Junior; how on earth is he doing it without breaking his back? He’s twisted up like a contortionist, it looks so painful – there’s a reason humans don’t walk on all fours today, we’re simply not built to (young Tarzan demonstrates a similar anatomical problem with his knuckle-walking).\n\nPlot\n\nThere was a bit of drama behind the scenes when it came to the film’s story, as Walt originally commissioned Bill Peet (who you may remember from The Sword in the Stone) to create it. As it turned out, Walt found Peet’s material too dark to use; he had stuck very closely to the original stories and the two argued over what approach to take, leading to Peet leaving Disney entirely in January 1964.\n\nAn alternate ending was planned which followed a plotline from one of the original stories, in which a man from the village named Buldeo would force Mowgli to lead him back to the ruins of Louie’s palace in search of treasure, culminating in a last fight with Shere Khan in which the tiger kills Buldeo and then Mowgli kills Shere Khan, but this was ultimately scrapped, presumably for being both too dark and too complicated. Walt specifically wanted to avoid getting too “bogged down” in the story this time around, wisely choosing to focus more on the characters to drive the action. (I imagine after his earlier attempts at adapting classic literature were panned that he’d simply had enough by this point and decided to throw caution to the wind).\n\nDisney assigned Larry Clemmons as the head of the new four-man story writing team, and after giving him a copy of the Kipling book, told him, “The first thing I want you to do is not to read it.” Clemmons did still look at it, though, and considered it too disjoined and episodic, in need of continuity in order to fit a film script. For the first time in forever (yes, that was a Frozen pun), Walt actually got very involved with the story meetings and went back to his old habit of acting out each role to help explore the emotions of the characters, helping to create gags and developing sequences. He was said to greatly enjoy the experience, which is nice to hear as it would end up being his last chance to do this. One idea that Walt liked especially was the ending with the girl enticing Mowgli into the village, but animator Ollie Johnston initially hated it because he felt it was lazy and tacked on (honestly, I’m inclined to agree to some extent). However, the more he worked on the scene, the more he began to feel like it was the right was to go; in the end, Johnston said that he was glad Walt didn’t listen to his argument to have it cut.\n\nThe plot is indeed episodic, but it’s done much better than in The Sword in the Stone because the film doesn’t lose track of its underlying plotline – getting Mowgli to the village – which is what drives the whole thing forwards. That said, the pacing can sometimes be a little… strange. During the talk between Bagheera and Baloo, it goes from late night to dawn in a matter of moments, so suddenly that even Baloo looks surprised – I know tropical dawns and dusks don’t last as long as temperate ones, but seriously, it looks like someone’s just turned the lights up on a set. Later, after the big fight with Shere Khan (which is clearly taking place on a sort of grassy plain), we find that it was all happening within sight of the man village, as Mowgli spots it over Baloo’s shoulder without either of them moving far from the point where he fell. This doesn’t make sense; the scenery doesn’t match up at all. The village is clearly somewhere deep in the jungle, yet we’re supposed to believe that the fight was happening right near it despite clearly being out in the open… Maybe the jungle (and the village) was behind the fourth wall?\n\nI also wish that the writers hadn’t skipped over the wolves’ parts so quickly, as they formed a much more integral part of the plot in the original stories and it’s jarring to see how quickly Mowgli forgets them after he leaves with Bagheera. I didn’t love the 2016 remake, but at least there Mowgli continues to think of his “foster family” over the course of the film; he even ends up re-joining them in the end instead of going off to the village. Whether that is an improvement or not is a genuinely debatable matter… personally, I can’t decide. It’s nice that the remake subverts the idea of everyone having to “be with their own people,” instead using an idea of inclusion which allows Mowgli to be accepted by his jungle brethren despite his differences. That said, there’s an undeniable logic to having Mowgli live with humans; it really isn’t healthy for a person to spend their entire lives cut off from human contact and however Disneyfied these animals are, they ain’t humans.\n\nMy favourite aspect of the plot here is probably the scene where Baloo struggles to tell Mowgli that he must take him to the village. It functions as a subversion of the “Cannot Spit it Out” trope, where a character (in this case Baloo) fails to tell another one (Mowgli) something important (he must go to the village) because said character (Mowgli) is too upbeat and they can’t bear to upset them. Although it’s clearly hard for him to do, Baloo does tell him, despite knowing it could wreck their relationship – it’s a subtle but bold move and I appreciate that they didn’t go with the more clichéd “misunderstanding” mess that a modern film might have.\n\nCinematography\n\nThe film boasts some more interesting artistic influences than The Sword in the Stone, with works by Disney favourites like Doré, Daumier and Heinrich Kley all playing a part in the film’s design. For this film, the art of Henri Rousseau (one of my favourite artists) was also consulted – Rousseau was part of the primitivism movement alongside artists like Paul Gauguin, and the tone of his striking, angular jungles can be discerned in some of the backgrounds here. According to IMDB, some Disney artists actually visited India on a research trip for inspiration, but I can’t find any other sources which back this up. Whether or not they did, it’s pretty clear where the inspiration for Louie’s palace came from; it looks very much like the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, which was first constructed in the 1100s as a Hindu site for the Khmer Empire before becoming a Buddhist site later.\n\nThe backgrounds here moved back towards the more traditional look of the earlier films and were hand-painted (with the exception of the waterfall, which apparently used footage of Venezuela’s Angel Falls, the world’s highest waterfall), with foliage and rocks placed in both the foreground and the bottom of the screen in some scenes to create an illusion of depth. The scenery here is gorgeous, with the opening credits standing out for their excellent vistas of Mowgli’s steamy tropical home, but the backgrounds remain lush and delicious throughout the film and make this one of the prettiest ones of the Xerox era. Some individual shots, like the one of the moonlit lake which we see twice, are incredibly atmospheric, and there’s some occasional variation in the camerawork such as in the scene where Baloo tells Mowgli he must take him to the man village and the camera does a rotated zoom on the boy’s face, as if to echo Mowgli’s shaken feeling. There are only a few trifling details which date the film a little such as Kaa’s hypnotic swirly eyes, which look very “psychedelic” and seem to reflect the influence of the booming drug culture on the art of the time (the phrase “Disney acid sequence” exists for a reason…)\n\nIn an interesting stylistic choice, most of the film’s more “serious” scenes seem to take place at night. The council of the wolves where Mowgli’s fate is decided, the boy’s near-death experience during his first meeting with Kaa, the conversation between Baloo and Bagheera and the climactic face-off with Shere Khan… all in darkness. It’s an example of pathetic fallacy, a storytelling technique where the environment is used to reflect the feelings of the characters in a scene – I appreciated its use here, as I agree that a lot of life’s most “serious” thoughts seem to strike at night (anyone else have trouble sleeping because your mind decides to go over every mistake you’ve ever made at three AM?). The final fight with Shere Khan is another highlight of cinematography, with the lighting, camera angles and music all working perfectly to convey the appropriate tone in the scene – the following eulogy scene and then the ones with the girl are equally well staged and performed.\n\nFor film buffs, it might be interesting to compare this film with the 1942 Jungle Book, directed by Zoltan Korda and starring Sabu Dastagir – I haven’t seen it myself, but it’s highly likely the Disney filmmakers drew inspiration from this when creating their version.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nMuch like the story, the soundtrack for the film also went through a few roadblocks on its way to becoming the amazing piece of work we know today. The original composer was Terry Gilkyson, but like Bill Peet, he too had his work dismissed as too “dark” for the film Disney were creating, so almost all of it was replaced with a new score by George Bruns (although one song was kept, which proved one of the best decisions they could have made). The songs of this film are among Disney’s most popular and best-known, largely thanks to the inspired lyrics of the Sherman Brothers, who were brought in to replace Gilkyson (although his one remaining song ended up being one of the most popular of all).\n\nOne of the earliest songs is Colonel Hathi’s March, which has the kind of strong beat you’d expect of a march, but it’s probably the weakest song from a lyrical standpoint. I don’t have a lot to say about it; it’s catchy enough but nothing amazing compared to the other pieces. Despite that, it crops up twice, so apparently the filmmakers liked it!\n\nBare Necessities is much, much better – this is Gilkyson’s sole remaining number and it’s a good thing it was left in, because it’s one of the film’s better songs and is a favourite of many Disney fans the world over. It serves a similar function to Hakuna Matata in The Lion King, another song sung by a couple of lazy loafers in the wild who try to convince a hero having an identity crisis to loosen up and unwind. The best thing about it is that it sets up Baloo’s personality so well; in this one song we learn all about his lifestyle and work ethic (or lack of it) while also seeing a little more of Bagheera and Mowgli’s mind-sets, giving us a whole lot of character exposition wrapped up in a jazzy beat accompanied with lively animation. Excellent.\n\nThe Sherman Brothers were often brought to the story sessions, where Walt asked them to “find scary places and write fun songs” for their compositions that would fit in with the story and advance the plot, instead of interrupting it. I don’t know about you, but I think they pulled it off admirably.\n\nI Wan’na Be Like You (yeah, it does have that little apostrophe in it apparently) was recorded by Phil Harris and Louis Prima separately due to their busy schedules, but it’s surprising considering how smoothly integrated their combined scatting is. This is my favourite piece, with lots of terrific jazz and a fun, danceable chorus that just about everybody knows; I especially enjoy the way Baloo just comes barging in and kicks things up a notch, having the time of his life (“Gettin’ maaaad, baby!”). Scat music might not be to everyone’s taste, but I can’t get enough of it and this is just about the only time Disney has ever included any in one of their songs.\n\nTrust in Me was originally created for Mary Poppins (1964) under the title Land of Sand, but as it was not used there it was rewritten for inclusion here – waste not, want not I suppose. It’s actually a very effective song (does it count as a villain song? I’m not sure), sounding like a sort of sinister lullaby which perfectly suits Holloway’s soft, wispy voice. As I mentioned when talking about him, it’s also really creepy out of context – that’s probably why it doesn’t tend to crop up much on Disney music albums, as it needs the visuals to support it (look how easily Scarlett Johansson made it sound sexy when she covered it for the 2016 remake).\n\nThe vultures get That’s What Friends Are For as their big number, with Bill Lee of the Mellomen stepping in to provide Shere Khan’s hilarious bass line after George Sanders refused to sing (look at his face as he sings it, it’s a scream). Given the very 1960s designs of the birds, you’d expect this to sound like a Beatles knock-off, so it’s pretty surprising when they suddenly bust out this awesome barbershop quartet thing – there are some great harmonies and Mowgli is soon up and dancing along with the audience as they get into their stride. I like the way it starts to fall apart near the end as they get too ambitious for their own good, with Buzzie struggling to sing and hold up the vulture-tower at the same time, and then Shere Khan cuts in with that finish and I’m just howling with laughter.\n\nKen Anderson was storyboarding the final scene at almost the same time that the Shermans were finishing My Own Home. It turned out that everything they had envisioned while writing the song was on Anderson’s storyboards and, when they brought him up to their office to play it for him for the first time, he immediately began to cry. I find that little anecdote kind of surprising from my modern perspective (the lyrics really haven’t aged well), but it does have a lovely melody which is woven into the score throughout the film before we hear it in full at the end. It’s the purest example of sexism in the whole film, with the girl singing almost wistfully about the day she’ll own her own home – naturally, she’ll spend all her time inside of it, cooking for her “handsome husband” while her own daughter collects water unsupervised just feet from the dangerous jungle, the same as she is doing now. What can you say at this point; this was a time when items as innocuous as men’s slacks were marketed by having adverts with a woman being mobbed by men wearing them. Objectification was rife, and this film was no exception.\n\nStill, that criticism aside, the general score is one of the more memorable of the post-war/pre-Renaissance scores, from the opening credits when that “ethnic” bass flute rhythm kicks in to the final jazzy strains as Baloo and Bagheera saunter off into the sunset. The boxing scene between Baloo and Mowgli is a highlight, with lots of comic percussion accentuating the action. The recycling that was affecting the animation also extended at times to the music; for instance, you might recognise Paul J. Smith’s organ theme from the funeral scene of Snow White playing in the background of Bagheera’s eulogy (it’s almost as if Disney were making fun of themselves a bit there).\n\nThe writing of the film is very good, especially in the scenes involving Baloo and Bagheera together. Bagheera’s eulogy for Baloo is touching (or at least it would be if we didn’t know that the bear is listening in with tearful pride) and the talk they share as Mowgli is sleeping accomplishes a lot in a short space of time, with not a word wasted. There are some amazing lines scattered about throughout the film, with most of them coming from Baloo; who could forget his famous drawl of “I’m gone, man, solid gone!” as he dances off to join Louie’s party, or the moment during his own eulogy where he sniffs, “I wish my mother could have heard this…” There’s also a repeated theme of triple-barrelled insults which I found hilarious, with Bagheera describing Baloo as “That shiftless, stupid, jungle bum!” and Baloo calling out to a kidnapping monkey, “WHY YOU FLAT-NOSED, LITTLE-EYED, FLAKY CREEP!” (That last one is especially funny because of the way he snaps out of his warm paternal tone and straight into hard-assed “street” Baloo).\n\nOne other note: after re-watching both the VHS and the DVD, I noticed that some of the dialogue between Bagheera and Hathi that is overheard by the eavesdropping Shere Khan is missing from the tape, but is present on the DVD. I don’t know why this is; it’s not deterioration or anything, I turned the volume right up on the tape and the lines clearly aren’t there at all. It detracts a little from the scene to hear Shere Khan reacting to unheard lines, so I’m glad that whatever the problem was, it was fixed for the DVD release.\n\nFinal Verdict –\n\nThere’s an anecdote that after a studio screening of the finished film in 1967, Ollie Johnston was approached by Walt’s personal nurse, Hazel George, who told him tearfully that the final shot with Bagheera and Baloo walking off into the sunset was perfect and was just the way that Walt himself had passed. (Who put these onions here… sniff…)\n\nSome copies of the film were released on a double-bill at the time with Charlie, the Lonesome Cougar, which has since been largely forgotten. The Jungle Book was generally well-received by critics and audiences alike, receiving praise from Life, Time and The New York Times, making this only their second animated success of the entire decade. It has been argued that part of this warm reception might have been due to nostalgia for the recently-deceased Walt and his works in general, but I don’t think that’s true; this film is strong enough in its own right to merit the praise it got. It’s really quite lucky that it did so well, or it’s likely the animation department would have been closed.\n\nThen-president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, actor Gregory Peck, even tried to get the film nominated for Best Picture as part of a series of changes he was implementing, but he was unsuccessful (twenty-four years later another Disney animated film actually was nominated); this was part of the reason Peck resigned in 1970. Interestingly, one person who disliked it at the time was Kipling’s daughter, Elsie Bambridge, who apparently never forgave Disney for the butchered pronunciation of Mowgli used in the film (no pleasing the literary fans).\n\nSome modern critics have come to view it more negatively, too: scholar Walidah Imarisha noted of the film’s context; “We have the women’s rights movement, women’s liberation movement, we have the beginnings of gay liberation movements, we obviously have third world, Black, Latino, Asian, Indigenous liberation movements happening here and globally, and The Jungle Book is actually a complete repudiation of all of that. And if you go through, what comes out so clearly when you watch The Jungle Book is … everyone has their place in a hierarchy, and it is once you step out of that place that everything falls apart… Society can’t function unless everyone is in their proper place.” Similar criticisms of the “pro-segregation” mentality have also been aimed at more recent films like The Lion King (1994) and they can’t be overlooked entirely, but I doubt that many modern children who watch these films are likely to make these connections – if you’re really worried about negative influences, a simple conversation with the child before viewing about what’s wrong with the film can prevent any misunderstandings.\n\nWhatever flaws it may have had, it did well enough to become the fourth highest-grossing film of the year, and garnered rereleases in the US in 1978, 1984 and 1990, along with several more in Europe throughout the 1980s. It also did particularly well in Germany (for some reason), placing behind only James Cameron’s two blockbuster epics Titanic (1997) and Avatar (2009) in overall gross there.\n\nThe first VHS release in the US came in 1991, with the British one following in 1993 (this is the one I have), and it received another VHS release in 1997 for its thirtieth anniversary. After a limited DVD release in 1999, it then got another in 2007 for its fortieth, followed by a Diamond edition Blu-ray/DVD combo in 2014.\n\nMuch of the animation from the film was reused, particularly in Robin Hood (1973) where whole scenes were rotoscoped and copied. The animators of Aladdin, The Lion King and Lilo & Stitch all took inspiration from the design and animation of the film, with director Bird and animators Andreas Deja, Glen Keane and Sergio Pablos all pointing to this film as a source of inspiration for their entering the business in the first place. Some of the characters made the usual cameos in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and almost appeared in the Kingdom Hearts video game series, but the world was cut due to its resemblance to the world of Tarzan. In 2010, British artist Banksy even created an £80,000 (over $100,000) piece of art called “Execution” for Greenpeace featuring the characters bound and awaiting the axe, which created considerable controversy.\n\nIn 1968, Disneyland Records released the album More Jungle Book, an unofficial sequel album written by screenwriter Larry Simmons, which continued the story of the film and included Phil Harris and Louis Prima reprising their film roles.\n\nThe film also led to two spin-off TV shows; TaleSpin (1990-1991), which was one of the nine original Disney Afternoon shows in the US, and Jungle Cubs (1996-1998), which featured the characters as children and friends – I actually saw this latter one and even had another VHS tape with some of the episodes on it. (Is it bad to admit that I liked it back then?)\n\nChuck Jones made a half-hour TV special called Mowgli’s Brothers in 1976 which served as his take on the story, and I even remember an anime (Jungle Book Shōnen Mowgli, 1989-1990), which I had another VHS tape of – I really made up for not having access to many Disney films by getting into absolutely everything related to this one!\n\nThere was a live-action remake back in 1994 directed by Stephen Sommers and featuring Jason Scott Lee, Cary Elwes and Sam Neill which was quite well-received, along with a direct-to-video live-action film called The Jungle Book: Mowgli’s Story in 1998. Then came the inevitable DTV animated sequel, The Jungle Book 2, in 2003 (there was even a Jungle Book 3 in early development around 2005, but it never got made). This sequel isn’t the worst of them – it does at least develop the unnamed girl a bit and it stars Haley Joel Osment of all people – but it’s still not a patch on the original.\n\nMost recently, of course, we got the highly-lauded live-action remake from Jon Favreau in 2016, starring Neel Sethi as Mowgli alongside such luminaries as Idris Elba, Scarlett Johansson, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walken and Lupita Nyong’o. I saw this in “D-Box,” which basically meant I was sat in a vibrating seat like you get in a simulator that kept rocking me about at random times and got very annoying very fast (I don’t know what I expected; a good film doesn’t need gimmicks to make it better). As far as the live-action remakes go this is one of the better ones, although once again there were some problems with miscasting – I couldn’t stand Bill Murray’s take on Baloo, and Christopher Walken was just a weird choice for King Louie (although not as weird as Helena Bonham Carter being Cinderella’s Fairy Godmother, admittedly). Young Neel Sethi did a good job considering he had mostly green screens to act against, so credit to him for his performance. Soleil Ho has said of it, “The film sidesteps Kipling’s original tale of transnational angst in favour of a more multiculturalist ‘our differences make us stronger’ bent,” because it chooses to keep Mowgli in the jungle at the end, which I think is at least as good of an ending as the original one, although not necessarily a better one. This is perhaps the first time that one of these remakes hasn’t butchered the story in attempting to update it for a modern audience, but that said I still don’t see why this had to be made in the first place as the original holds up very well.\n\nTo conclude, this is a fun, entertaining and visually appealing film, and I don’t think you can really ask any more of it than that. It might have some dubious morals here and there regarding women’s roles and stifling diversity (although I still don’t see the “racist” argument regarding the monkeys), but these are only very minor aspects of the production and aren’t glaring enough to detract from the overall experience. I don’t mean to make light of these issues of course – it’s just that I don’t see why a handful of “dated” scenes should spoil what is otherwise a fantastic film. It’s like the recent news story about the Golden Age classic Gone With the Wind (1939) being banned from a Memphis theatre, due to increased sensitivity over the handful of scenes depicting black actresses in uncomfortably demeaning positions (don’t even get me started on all that; this was the film which led to a black actress winning an Oscar for the first time, after all). I feel like this overly-PC culture is beginning to encroach too far into the world of art, which at the end of the day is subjective and a product of the time it was created in; just because an older film doesn’t perfectly align with modern sensibilities, that’s no reason to erase it from history. Acting like these works never existed doesn’t accomplish anything – as with any piece of history, we need instead to use these works to learn from the past, while also enjoying them for what they are. I would recommend checking this one out, as it’s one of the best Disney films from the Xerox period and is sure to provide you with plenty of laughs and some quality entertainment.\n\nMy Rating – 4/5\n\nReferences\n\nI consulted my own books to research for this review, as well as some standard web sources:\n\nThe Art of Walt Disney (2011 ed.) by Christopher Finch\n\nOnce Upon a Time: Walt Disney (2007) edited by Bruno Girveau\n\nEncyclopedia of Walt Disney’s Animated Characters (1998 ed.) by John Grant\n\nBy Source, Fair use, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15770836 – credit for the poster\n\nBy Ksuryawanshi – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=41321112 – credit for Angkor Wat image\n\nhttps://www.bitchmedia.org/article/racial-politics-disney-animals – source for Walidah Imarisha quote\n\nhttps://www.bitchmedia.org/article/jungle-books-again-again-relationship-imperialism-hearken – source for Soleil Ho quote\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Book_(1967_film) – wiki page"
