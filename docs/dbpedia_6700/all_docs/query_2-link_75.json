        "text": "One of the best streaming platforms for all things horror is Amazon Prime Video. Home to hundreds of scary titles from eras past and present, the Prime Video trove also manages to highlight films with lower budgets and less theatrical visibility. So if you want to make a cheap spooky flick with your pals, there’s a chance you could see the fruits of your labor on Prime Video someday.\n\nThat being said, there’s a lot of fodder to sort through to get to Prime Video’s really good horror movies, and it’s our job to do all the digging. We do our best to highlight horror films that were critically acclaimed, but we even try to throw a bone to the lesser-known pics that you shouldn’t miss.\n\nHere’s all the best horror movies on Prime Video you can look forward to streaming for July 2024!\n\nWant more Prime Video content? Check out the best movies on Prime Video right now. If you don’t see anything of note on Amazon Prime, we’ve also rounded up the best horror movies on Netflix and the best horror movies on Hulu.\n\nThe Woman in Black (2012)\n\n62%\n\n6.4/10\n\npg-13\n\n95m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Horror, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds, Janet McTeer\n\nDirected by\n\nJames Watkins\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nNot long after his famous Harry Potter gig, actor Daniel Radcliffe dipped his toes into Gothic horror with the 2012 film The Woman in Black. Radcliffe stars as Arthur Kipps, a lawyer grieving the loss of his spouse. When tasked with settling the estate of Alice Drablaw (Alisa Khazanova), Arthur’s arrival to the client’s removed hamlet and decrepit manor unearths a trove of terrifying secrets, along with the film’s titular ghoul. A delectable throwback to classic Victorian chillers like The Innocents, The Woman in Black leans more on atmosphere and slow dread than the typical jumpscare (though there are one or two throughout).\n\nThe Grudge (2004)\n\n49%\n\npg-13\n\n92m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Mystery, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Behr, Takako Fuji\n\nDirected by\n\nTakashi Shimizu\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nWe all know curses are very bad. Well, according to the lore of the 2004 film The Grudge (a remake of writer-director Takashi Shimizu’s 2002 film Ju-On: The Grudge), when a person dies in a state of rage or deep sadness, The Grudge (a super-curse) is born. Said Grudge then starts murdering people in a never-ending cycle of torment. Our story proper begins when an American family takes up residence in a Tokyo home that is occupied by a Grudge. Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen Davis, an exchange student who takes on an impromptu nursing job at the haunted domicile, this 2004 reworking of Shimizu’s original Japanese production delivers its fair share of scares (one in the form of a noise you won’t soon forget).\n\nRosemary's Baby (1968)\n\n96%\n\n8.0/10\n\nr\n\n138m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Horror, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nMia Farrow, John Cassavetes, Ruth Gordon\n\nDirected by\n\nRoman Polanski\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nAt the core of director Roman Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby lies a single frustrating question: Why will no one believe me? Our titular protagonist is played by Mia Farrow, a woman spending lots of time on her lonesome in a towering New York brownstone. One night, Rosemary has a terrifying nightmare (or at least she thinks it might be a dream), in which she is impregnated by the devil. Over the next few weeks, the people closest to Rosemary, including her husband, Guy (played by John Cassavetes), start acting strange. Rosemary starts to become convinced that the world is closing in on her. A riveting genre classic, Rosemary’s Baby has been a major influence on all types of horror and thriller films for several decades.\n\nThe Nightmare (2015)\n\n49%\n\n5.7/10\n\nr\n\n90m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Documentary\n\nStars\n\nForrest Borie, Korinne Wilson, Andrew Schwarz\n\nDirected by\n\nRodney Ascher\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nSleep paralysis is a horrific condition in which a person who is technically sleeping is awake enough to recognize some aspects of their reality. But not awake enough to keep demons, imps, and other shadow creatures at bay. The latter are manifestations of the mind, but for paralysis sufferers, it’s all too real. This bewildering, but fascinating sleep disorder is the subject of documentarian Rodney Ascher’s 2015 film The Nightmare. It’s a solid watch, combining talking head segments with well-staged reenactments. And when it’s over, we guarantee you’ll be sleeping with a night-light for weeks to come.\n\nThe Dead Zone (1983)\n\n69%\n\n7.2/10\n\nr\n\n103m\n\nGenre\n\nThriller, Horror, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nChristopher Walken, Brooke Adams, Tom Skerritt\n\nDirected by\n\nDavid Cronenberg\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nStephen King’s first decade of horror literature is arguably his best. And when it comes to cinematic adaptations of the author’s work, David Cronenberg knocked it out of the park with his rendition of The Dead Zone. It stars Christopher Walken as Johnny Smith, an English teacher who ends up in a horrific car crash. When Smith reawakens from a five-year coma, he discovers newfound psychokinetic abilities. When he touches a person, he can see their past and future! More a curse than a gift though, Smith’s powers are put to the test when a ruthless politician (Martin Sheen) enters the fray. While not an outright horror tale, there are a few choice scenes in The Dead Zone that keep the story anchored in a world of unspeakable terrors (one involves a pair of scissors).\n\nThe Breach (2022)\n\n4.9/10\n\nr\n\n93m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror\n\nStars\n\nAllan Hawco, Emily Alatalo, Wesley French\n\nDirected by\n\nRodrigo Gudiño\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn director Rodrigo Gudińo’s The Breach, Allan Hawco stars as Chief of Police John Hawkins. With just a few more days before he departs his lawman role, Hawkins’ policing powers are challenged one last time when a cadaver with bizarre wounds washes ashore. Taking inspiration from numerous genre classics, The Breach first presents itself as your typical alone-in-the-woods thriller, but quickly morphs into the kind of cosmic horror we rarely get to see these days.\n\nBones and All (2022)\n\n74%\n\n6.8/10\n\nr\n\n131m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Horror, Romance\n\nStars\n\nTaylor Russell, Timothée Chalamet, Mark Rylance\n\nDirected by\n\nLuca Guadagnino\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe latest effort from masterful filmmaker Luca Guadagnino, Bones and All reunites the director with Call Me By Your Name star Timothée Chalamet. Set in a modern world not too different from our own, the story follows Maren (played by Taylor Russell) and Lee (Chalamet). Star-crossed lovers, both youths are doing what they can to stay afloat on the road. Oh, and it just so happens that they both enjoy consuming human flesh. On its face, this bizarre blend of horror, drama, and romance may not seem like it would work, but thanks to some committed performances from its two leads, Bones and All is hard to look away from.\n\nPlay Dead (2022)\n\n4.0/10\n\nr\n\n106m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nBailee Madison, Jerry O'Connell, Anthony Turpel\n\nDirected by\n\nPatrick Lussier\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThere are some jobs that only certain people can do. Firefighters, police officers, and morticians are a few of these roles that come to mind. As for the latter, watching a movie like Play Dead will make you wish you knew even less about what lies beyond the doors of a morgue. It stars Bailee Madison as Chloe, a criminology student who decides to fake her death to get inside a local morgue. It turns out that wasn’t such a great idea, because the coroner (played by Jerry O’Connell) just so happens to be a twisted psychopath. Sometimes all you need is a classic setup that works, and director Patrick Lussier is a master at pushing the ball forward while delivering some surprising scares along the way.\n\nAbsentia (2011)\n\n59%\n\n5.8/10\n\nr\n\n92m\n\nGenre\n\nMystery, Horror, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nKatie Parker, Courtney Bell, Morgan Peter Brown\n\nDirected by\n\nMike Flanagan\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIt’s never a great idea to wander into dark and creepy places, especially when monsters that lurk inside are devouring your loved ones. In Absentia, Courtney Bell and Katie Parker play sisters Tricia and Callie. Seven years prior to when we’re introduced to the characters, Tricia’s husband, Daniel (Morgan Peter Brown), suddenly reappears, but all is not as it seems. Once Callie starts doing some research, it turns out that the neighborhood tunnel everyone’s so afraid of has a far more sordid past than anyone can imagine. Absentia hits a few potholes (mainly due to its scrappy budget), but it’s an otherwise brilliant film with some great performances and supernatural undertones that are still freaking us out.\n\nRenfield (2023)\n\n53%\n\n6.4/10\n\nr\n\n93m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Horror, Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nNicholas Hoult, Nicolas Cage, Awkwafina\n\nDirected by\n\nChris McKay\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nNicolas Cage continues to hone his B-movie schtick, bringing his prowess to yet another Dracula adaptation. Instead of focusing on the antagonistic night stalker though, Renfield focuses on the iconic count’s right-hand man. Starring Nicholas Hoult as the titular character and Cage as Dracula, our story takes place in modern times. After centuries of serving the demanding vampire, Renfield wants to break free from his master’s omnipotent grasp. There’s a whole world out there calling Renfield’s name, but as it turns out, breaking away from a vampiric overlord can be quite the challenge. A fun blend of horror, comedy, and action, the star attraction of Renfield is the hilarious and even charming dynamic between Hoult and Cage.\n\nAccording to the doomsday crew, if the family doesn’t sacrifice one of their own, a series of global tragedies will consume the world. It’s your typical nail-biting siege pic, with a bunch of characters stuck under one roof for a majority of the runtime, but Knock at the Cabin gets a big boost from its excellent cast, with Dave Bautista being an empathetic standout. Yes, he could kill you by looking at you for too long, but Mr. Brocht could also make you a shed a tear or two.[/dt_media]\n\nThere's Something Wrong with the Children (2023)\n\n53%\n\n4.9/10\n\nr\n\n92m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Mystery, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nZach Gilford, Alisha Wainwright, Amanda Crew\n\nDirected by\n\nRoxanne Benjamin\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nDirected by Roxanne Benjamin from a script by T.J. Cimfel and David White, There’s Something Wrong with the Children stars Alisha Wainwright and Zach Gilford as Margaret and Ben, a couple who take a trip into the wilderness with fellow adults Ellie and Thomas (Amanda Crew and Carlos Santos) and their two kids, Lucy (Briella Guiza) and Spencer (David Mattle). Everything is going peachy-keen until the dawn of a new day. After disappearing into the forest, Lucy and Spencer are acting quite strange upon their return.\n\nIs something supernatural afoot, or did the kids just have too many marshmallows? Cut from the same cloth as films like A24’s horror movie A Hole in the Ground and Amazon’s remake of Goodnight Mommy (swap the weird kids for a weird parent), There’s Something Wrong … isn’t bringing the most original premise to the table, but where this Blumhouse-produced entry truly succeeds is with its foreboding camera work, editing, and haunting score.\n\nThe Battery (2012)\n\n6.3/10\n\nr\n\n101m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Horror\n\nStars\n\nJeremy Gardner, Adam Cronheim, Niels Bolle\n\nDirected by\n\nJeremy Gardner\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nWritten, directed, produced, and starring Jeremy Gardner, The Battery follows the postapocalyptic day-to-day lives of two former baseball players, Ben (Gardner) and Mickey (Adam Cronheim). Constantly at each other’s throats, these two survivors of the undead takeover are forced to wander the desolate remains of New England. While searching an abandoned property, Ben and Mickey discover two walkie-talkies.\n\nWhile testing the radios, they stumble upon a transmission from a nearby group of survivors. Mickey wants to join the marauders, but Ben seems to have his doubts. Shot in just 15 days in Connecticut for only $6,000, The Battery is proof that you don’t need flashy CGI to tell a captivating, horrific, and inspiring story.\n\nJigsaw (2017)\n\n39%\n\n5.7/10\n\nr\n\n92m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Crime, Mystery, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nMatt Passmore, Tobin Bell, Callum Keith Rennie\n\nDirected by\n\nMichael Spierig, Peter Spierig\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe eight film in the still-ongoing Saw franchise, 2017’s Jigsaw plays to the typical Saw film formula: Unsuspecting victims are forced to participate in a series of deadly games curated by whatever notorious malcontent is calling themselves “Jigsaw” this time around.\n\nBut with the O.G. serial killer, John Kramer, dead in the ground for over a decade, who exactly is still willing and able to pull the murderous strings? Like the many lesser versions of the original film that came before it, Jigsaw doesn’t stray too far from the grisly visuals that the series is known for. That being said, it’s still a decent watch, especially for longtime fans of the saga.\n\nThe Taking of Deborah Logan (2014)\n\n6.0/10\n\nr\n\n90m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Mystery, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nJill Larson, Anne Ramsay, Michelle Ang\n\nDirected by\n\nAdam Robitel\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe directorial debut of Adam Robitel, The Taking of Deborah Logan follows a group of documentary filmmakers who are looking to produce a film about the crippling affects of Alzheimer’s disease. Their main subject is a woman named Deborah Logan (Jill Larson), a sufferer of dementia who begins experiencing erratic behavior. According to Deborah’s physicians, her behavior is par for the course, but when these eccentricities begin developing links to terrifying crimes and supernatural phenomena, the documentarians realize that their very lives are at stake. A found-footage gem that many fans of the sub-genre will enjoy, The Taking of Deborah Logan is a lesser-known horror entry that doesn’t get talked about as much as it should.\n\nSmile (2022)\n\nr\n\n115m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Mystery, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nSosie Bacon, Kyle Gallner, Caitlin Stasey\n\nDirected by\n\nParker Finn\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe feature film debut of writer-director Parker Finn, Smile stars Sosie Bacon as Dr. Rose Cotter, a psychiatrist who finds herself haunted by disturbing specters and other supernatural phenomena after one of her patients ends her life right in front of her. As the days and weeks go by, Rose starts losing her grip on reality, leading her to do a bit of investigating into her client’s demise.\n\nHer discovery: a morbid and long-spanning connect-the-dots of self-mutilation. Leaning on jump-scares (albeit some very good ones) and measured performances to spin its terror threads, Smile may feel familiar to many fans of the genre, but who said wearing your influences on your sleeve has to be a bad thing?\n\nCropsey (2009)\n\nr\n\n84m\n\nGenre\n\nMystery, Documentary, Horror, Crime\n\nStars\n\nJoshua Zeman, Barbara Brancaccio, Bill Ellis\n\nDirected by\n\nJoshua Zeman, Barbara Brancaccio\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nCropsey is the kind of documentary that has us wishing there were more documentaries just like it; and even if you’re a horror fan who never treads the waters of non-fiction, we highly recommend giving this one a go. Produced and directed by Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio, Cropsey explores the titular urban legend, a monster of a man who preyed upon five New York City children through the ‘70s and ‘80s.\n\nBut far more than a wandering wraith, the filmmakers discover that the horrible acts of convicted child kidnapper Andre Rand may be at the root of the decades-old myth. Profound and disturbing, Cropsey has gained quite the following over the last 15 years or so, and for good reason: it’s a sensational and disturbingly horrific doc that’s worth your time.\n\nThe Oak Room (2020)\n\n89m\n\nGenre\n\nThriller, Horror, Mystery\n\nStars\n\nRJ Mitte, Peter Outerbridge, Ari Millen\n\nDirected by\n\nCody Calahan\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nBased on the Peter Genoway play of the same name, director Cody Calahan’s The Oak Room stars Breaking Bad alum RJ Mitte and Peter Outerbridge as Steve and Paul. Hoping to settle a long-ago score, a homecoming Steve (Mitte) returns to a bar he once frequented, where he decides to trade harrowing stories with the miserly barkeep. It’s these chilling words that possess a greater part of the film, with the various vignettes delivering countless twists and turns throughout the runtime.\n\nMy Best Friend's Exorcism (2022)\n\n58%\n\n5.3/10\n\nr\n\n96m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nElsie Fisher, Amiah Miller, Rachel Ogechi Kanu\n\nDirected by\n\nDamon Thomas\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn My Best Friend’s Exorcism, Elsie Fisher and Amiah Miller star as best friends Abby and Gretchen, high-school pals who come into contact with a demonic entity that decides to take up residence in Gretchen’s body. As the evil within uses its new vessel for wrongdoing aplenty, it’s up to the teens to figure out a way to eradicate the monster before it’s too late. It’s silly in many ways, and not all of its narrative choices are worthwhile ones. But as an off-kilter horror comedy, My Best Friend’s Exorcism is an effective rumination on ’80s genre cinema that sticks its landing more than it doesn’t.\n\nGoodnight Mommy (2022)\n\n45%\n\n5.6/10\n\nr\n\n91m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Drama, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nNaomi Watts, Cameron Crovetti, Nicholas Crovetti\n\nDirected by\n\nMatt Sobel\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nA 2022 remake of the 2014 Austrian film of the same name, Goodnight Mommy stars Cameron and Nicholas Crovett as twin brothers Elias and Lukas. When the siblings are forced to stay with their mother (Naomi Watts), an actress covered in facial bandaging from a “cosmetic” surgery, the boys start to get a strange feeling that this woman is not their mother at all, but some kind of otherworldly imposter that means them harm. While not as captivating as the original film, Goodnight Mommy is still a decent Amazon horror flick that’s perfect to watch on a cold and gloomy night.\n\nThe Collector (2009)\n\n29%\n\n6.3/10\n\nr\n\n88m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nJosh Stewart, Juan Fernández, Michael Reilly Burke\n\nDirected by\n\nMarcus Dunstan\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe Collector takes all the mayhem and inventive murders of a film like Saw, removes any and all traces of relatable drama, and adds kerosene to the formula. The resulting conflagration is an exploitive mess that can be seen for miles, but we’ll be damned if we can’t turn away. Josh Stewart stars as ex-con Arkin, a man desperate to get some much-needed cash in the hands of his ex-wife, so he decides to rob a house. Not the best plan to begin with, but it just so happens that the targeted domicile has already been selected by a notorious madman who has rigged the residence with a series of inescapable death traps. During early development, The Collector was actually supposed to be a prequel to the Sawseries, which makes sense when you consider the narrative. It’s not groundbreaking genre cinema by any means, but if you need a good sister flick to the Saw canon, The Collector is bound to satiate.\n\nCandyman (2021)\n\n72%\n\n5.9/10\n\nr\n\n91m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror\n\nStars\n\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II, Teyonah Parris, Colman Domingo\n\nDirected by\n\nNia DaCosta\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nDare to speak his name? In the ghoulish tradition of urban legends like Bloody Mary, director Nia DaCosta’s 2021 film Candyman presents a decades-later sequel to the original 1992 Bernard Rose film of the same name. Starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Anthony McCoy, a Chicago-based painter seeking inspiration for his next set of works, the talented and curious craftsman dives deep into the lore of the infamous Candyman legend after a conversation with a Cabrini-Green resident (Colman Domingo) piques his interest in the man with a hooked hand. But as the bodies start piling up, the world of the paintbrush starts bleeding out into reality as the titular slasher returns once more. Candyman rocks a bold visual style with a kinetic story that comes to life through the film’s ensemble of players, particularly Mateen II as the manic artist who rapidly descends down a rabbit hole of disillusionment and decay.\n\nSaint Maud (2020)\n\n83%\n\n6.7/10\n\nr\n\n85m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Horror, Mystery\n\nStars\n\nMorfydd Clark, Jennifer Ehle, Lily Frazer\n\nDirected by\n\nRose Glass\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nReligious fervor meets breathtaking indie filmmaking in writer-director Rose Glass’ feature debut Saint Maud. Starring Morfydd Clark as the titular character, a hospice nurse with a devout born-again mentality, Maud is assigned to care for Amanda (Jennifer Ehle), an ailing American dancer living in London. But when Maud’s calling to save the soul of her patient reaches disturbing new heights, no one is safe from the perceived evils and resultant “cleansing.” A daring blend of drama and horror, Saint Maud is powerful cinema from a powerful, new auteur.\n\nMy Heart Can't Beat Unless You Tell It To (2021)\n\nr\n\n89m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Horror\n\nStars\n\nPatrick Fugit, Ingrid Sophie Schram, Owen Campbell\n\nDirected by\n\nJonathan Cuartas\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn writer-director Jonathan Cuartas’ My Heart Can’t Beat Unless You Tell It To, Patrick Fugit stars as Dwight, one of three siblings of a privately vampiric family. Dwight and his sister Jessie (Ingrid Sophie Schram) roam the desolate streets at night, seeking victims for their ailing younger brother, Thomas (Owen Campbell). But as the bodies continue piling, Dwight dreams of a new life — one unhindered by the bloodletting of innocents, perhaps. A bare-bones feature debut that matches moody atmospherics to a captivating plot revolving around the struggles of a family, My Heart Can’t Beat… is indie horror at its best.\n\nMadres (2021)\n\n43%\n\n4.8/10\n\nr\n\n83m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror\n\nStars\n\nAriana Guerra, Tenoch Huerta, Elpidia Carrillo\n\nDirected by\n\nRyan Zaragoza\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn Madres, an expectant Mexican-American couple retires to a farming community in 1970s California to have their first baby. But as a series of horrific visions begin plaguing the mother, the soon-to-be parents wonder if the myriad of disturbing images they’ve been seeing are due to the stresses of the forthcoming child, or maybe it has something to do with a sinister curse that has been stomping around the ranch the couple has been working on? Another great entry in the Welcome to the Blumhouse film series, Madres explores a number of important social issues under the banner of top-shelf horror.\n\nBlack as Night (2021)\n\n53%\n\n4.4/10\n\nr\n\n87m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nAsjha Cooper, Fabrizio Guido, Craig Tate\n\nDirected by\n\nMaritte Lee Go\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn Black of Night, Asjha Cooper stars as 15-year-old Shawna as a renegade vampire hunter living in New Orleans. When her mother falls victim to a band of vamps that has plagued the city since the travesty of Hurricane Katrina, Shawna teams up with three ragtag vigilantes to track down the leader of the vampires and put an end to their nighttime scheming once and for all. A fun blend of action, horror, teen melodrama, and social commentary, Black as Night borrows plenty from like-minded vampire flicks but dishes out enough of its own flavor to keep viewers glued to the screen.\n\nNocturne (2020)\n\n58%\n\n5.7/10\n\nr\n\n90m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Mystery, Thriller, Music\n\nStars\n\nSydney Sweeney, Madison Iseman, Jacques Colimon\n\nDirected by\n\nZu Quirke\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nNocturne stars Sydney Sweeney (Euphoria, White Lotus) and Madison Iseman (I Know What You Did Last Summer) as twin sisters Juliet and Vivian. Accomplished pianists attending a prestigious music school, Vivian’s abilities are near-virtuoso and always a step above Juliet’s hands. That is until Juliet comes into the possession of a music theory book from a student that had jumped to her death. As the tome begins granting Juliet newfound confidence and dedication to the piano, her inflated ego meshes with a series of supernatural events that threaten her own life and the safety of those around her.\n\nThe Manor (2021)\n\n59%\n\n5.3/10\n\nr\n\n81m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror\n\nStars\n\nBarbara Hershey, Nicholas Alexander, Bruce Davison\n\nDirected by\n\nAxelle Carolyn\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nJudith Albright (Barbara Hershey) isn’t who she used to be, not since her stroke at any rate. After moving into a prestigious nursing home, the ailing Judith begins experiencing horrific visions that lead her to believe something sinister is afoot at the sprawling estate. But with dementia running rampant through the halls, Judith’s insistence that something is not what it seems is easily dismissed by staff and family as an elderly case of “cried wolf.” But the truth, it turns out, is all too real. The Manor doesn’t reinvent the wheel when it comes to the genre, but writer-director Axelle Carolyn’s vision is a fun one to embrace — supplying the viewer with familiar motifs, ominous score, and plenty of seedlings that lead into third-act reveals.\n\nWe Are Still Here (2015)\n\n65%\n\n5.7/10\n\nr\n\n84m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror\n\nStars\n\nBarbara Crampton, Andrew Sensenig, Lisa Marie\n\nDirected by\n\nTed Geoghegan\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nAnne (Barbara Crampton) and Paul Sacchetti (Andrew Sensenig) are grieving parents that decide to relocate to a rural New England town, taking up residence in an 1800s rustic home. Upon moving in, the couple is warned by a concerned local that their home is an evil sanctum that they should vacate promptly. Undeterred by these provocations, Anne and Paul invite spiritualist pals May (Lisa Marie) and Jacob Lewis (Larry Fessenden) to their estate in hopes of contacting their deceased child — a supernatural leaning that quickly becomes the downfall of all involved, particularly when it turns out that their home may have a deviant mind of its own.\n\nBingo Hell (2021)\n\n55%\n\n4.3/10\n\nr\n\n85m\n\nGenre\n\nThriller\n\nStars\n\nAdriana Barraza, L. Scott Caldwell, Clayton Landey\n\nDirected by\n\nGigi Saúl Guerrero\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nLupita (Adriana Barraza) is a longtime resident of the Oak Springs retirement community. Living out her days in peace, a once-idyllic residence suddenly falls to darkness when the enigmatic Mr. Big (Richard Brake) becomes the new property manager. Sensing that evil is afoot, Lupita and her fellow retirees band together to take down the evildoer. But as the bodies start piling up, the senior citizens realize they may be entrenched in a hell they may not escape from. A splatterfest of camp, gore, and a cobbled narrative that ultimately satiates, Bingo Hell isn’t world-class cinema, but it’s perfect viewing for horror fanatics.\n\nHellraiser (1987)\n\n57%\n\n7.2/10\n\nr\n\n94m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror\n\nStars\n\nAshley Laurence, Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins\n\nDirected by\n\nClive Barker\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nStay away from ancient, evil puzzle boxes: A hard rule that all should follow.

Dragging Frank to their realm of pain and torture, his brother (Andrew Robinson) and his wife (Clare Higgins) move into Frank’s residence. When a drop of blood reawakens Frank, he tasks Julia, his brother’s spouse and Frank’s once-lover, with bringing him fresh victims to ultimately be reborn. Based on Clive Barker’s novel The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser combines graphic visual effects and an unrelenting narrative, resulting in a macabre masterpiece for the ages.\n\nBlack Box (2020)\n\n62%\n\n6.2/10\n\nr\n\n100m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Science Fiction, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nMamoudou Athie, Phylicia Rashād, Amanda Christine\n\nDirected by\n\nEmmanuel Osei-Kuffour, Jr.\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn the wake of a horrific car accident that killed his wife, Nolan (Mamoudou Athie) is left with crippling amnesia and a 10-year-old daughter to care for. After agreeing to undergo an experimental treatment to reclaim his lost faculties, the widowed father gets more than he bargained for when a series of disturbing hallucinations plague Nolan’s day-to-day. Hellbent on finding the cure for these manifestations, Nolan will soon discover that there’s a much darker side to his so-called recovery. A tactful and imaginative debut from director Emmanuel Osei-Kuffour, Jr., Black Box will keep you curled tight at the edge of your seat. We guarantee it.\n\nThe Neon Demon (2016)\n\n51%\n\n6.1/10\n\nr\n\n118m\n\nGenre\n\nThriller, Horror\n\nStars\n\nElle Fanning, Jena Malone, Desmond Harrington\n\nDirected by\n\nNicolas Winding Refn\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\n16-year-old Jesse (Elle Fanning) is an aspiring model who has recently relocated to Los Angeles. When she secures work with a prolific agency, the sky appears to be the limit for the fresh face. But as Jesse faces scrutiny and a series of uncomfortable exchanges with her older peers, mixed with a cycle of visceral and disturbing dreams and hallucinations, the veil of high fashion begins to peel back, revealing a strange and sordid underbelly for the youthful talent. A hypnotic tale of horror with a mighty sucker punch of an ending, The Neon Demon is as much an homage to ’70s foreign-language horror flicks as it is a fitting entry in the canon of writer-director Nicolas Winding Refn.\n\nThe Reef (2010)\n\n5.8/10\n\nr\n\n88m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Horror, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nDamian Walshe-Howling, Zoe Naylor, Adrienne Pickering\n\nDirected by\n\nAndrew Traucki\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nWhen four friends hit the high seas to deliver a yacht to a client in Indonesia, their voyage is quickly uprooted when their vessel capsizes in a coral reef. As the disparate foursome decides to swim to a nearby island with whatever supplies they can hang on to, a great white shark emerges from the depths and begins stalking them. While we’ve all seen our fair share of cheap shark-genre chillers, writer-director Andrew Traucki delivers his story through horrific slow burns, buttressed by the magnificent talents of the main ensemble. This is one of the better 90-minute oceanic horror films out there and a testament to the power of a good script and a director with a strong vision. Australian waters have never felt so foreboding.\n\nSuspiria (2018)\n\n64%\n\n6.7/10\n\nr\n\n152m\n\nGenre\n\nHorror, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nDakota Johnson, Tilda Swinton, Mia Goth\n\nDirected by\n\nLuca Guadagnino\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nHot off the success of his 2017 film, Call Me by Your Name, director Luca Guadagnino dove headfirst into the production of Suspiria, a remake of Dario Argento’s 1977 Technicolor nightmare about a prestigious German dance academy with a mysterious and sordid past. In Guadagnino’s rendition, Dakota Johnson plays Susie Bannion, the American newcomer to the foreign school, and what a wicked first day of classes she has. An expelled student, Patricia Hingle (Chloë Grace Moretz), is murdered, and not long after the ex-matriculate confessed to her therapist that the dance academy is run by evil witches.\n\nMovie images and data from:\n\nMichael Bizzaco has been writing about and working with consumer tech for well over a decade, writing about everything from A/V components and smart home devices to encryption software, cloud backup platforms, search engine tools, and more.
