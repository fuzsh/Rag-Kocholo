        "text": "Photo by Tadayuki Minamoto; Courtesy TAI Modern\n\nTradition and Innovation: Tanabe Chikuunsai IV and Apprentices\n\nJuly 26 – August 31, 2024\n\nOpening Reception: Friday, July 26, 5-7pm\n\nArtist Gallery Walkthrough: Saturday, July 27, 2pm\n\n1601 Paseo de Peralta, Santa Fe, NM\n\nTAI Modern is delighted to present Tradition and Innovation: Tanabe Chikuunsai IV and Apprentices. Led by master artist Tanabe Chikuunsai IV, this exhibition invites the viewer to glimpse the future of Japanese bamboo art. Driven to carry on the tradition of apprenticeship in Japan, Tanabe Chikuunsai IV’s studio currently hosts 10 apprentices, seven of whom have been invited to show at TAI Modern for the first time. They are Tashima Shiun, Nakamura Emika, Honda Yoko, Sano Kayoko, Hayashi Junpei, Ichikawa Yona, and Shimizu Yuki. As bamboo is always a family affair for the Tanabe family, Tradition and Innovation also features the work of Tanabe Mitsuko, Chikuunsai’s mother and bamboo master in her own right.\n\nThe Tanabe Chikuunsai lineage is the only surviving lineage of the great lineages in Japanese bamboo art, with a studio just outside of Osaka that is currently training its fifth generation of bamboo artists. From Tanabe Chikuunsai IV’s colossal installations at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at TAI Modern in 2019, to recent international exhibitions and an ongoing collaboration with the fine fashion house Loewe, Tanabe has emerged as a leader and representative for a younger generation of bamboo artists.\n\nThe exhibition promises to be a debut of the highest caliber, with the artists expressing ideas and feelings about childhood, time, and the visceral sense of being aware of one’s own organs. Tanabe’s Decayed Bamboo series will make its first US appearance. In these works, the bamboo twists and tangles with a feral energy, crowned with an abstracted handle made from a withered section of felled bamboo.\n\n“Each generation of Chikuunsai has enjoyed taking on new challenges while carrying on the tradition. Innovating tradition while carrying on tradition is a contradiction of terms and a very difficult task,” Tanabe states. “However, I believe that friendly competition with the younger generation and the discovery of new concepts will lead bamboo art to a new future.”\n\nTAI Modern will host Tanabe Chikuunsai IV and apprentices Hayashi Junpei, Ichikawa Yona, and Nakamura Emika at the opening reception this Friday evening, with an artists’ walkthrough the next day at their gallery in Sante Fe, NM. They hope you will be able to join them for this celebration of the future of bamboo art.\n\nTo learn more, click here.\n\nPhotography by @braydon_russell; Courtesy Alisan Fine Arts\n\nThemes and Variations\n\nOpening Reception & Live Performance: Thursday, July 25th from 6-8pm\n\nSecond Rotation: July 24 – August 23, 2024\n\n120 E 65th Street, NYC\n\nAlisan Fine Arts is pleased to introduce the second rotation of their current exhibition, Themes & Variations, on view from July 24th to August 23rd and cordially invite you to view these new pieces alongside a special performance by the talented ink artist Parin Heidari on July 25th.\n\nParin Heidari is a multidisciplinary artist known for her minimal art.

But how did this diversity in modern ceramics emerge?\n\nOn July 25th, Dai Ichi Arts, Ltd. opens Tales of Seto: An Exhibition of E-Seto Ceramics, an exhibition that explores the rich history of Seto ceramics, from the Edo to the Meiji and Showa periods, celebrating the evolution of “E-Seto (絵瀬戸),” which literally means “picture Seto.” This subcategory of Seto ceramics refers to a type of painted ceramic produced in Seto, Aichi Prefecture. The clay sourced from Seto possesses exceptional quality, consisting of kaolin and porcelain-type stone clay. When fired, this clay transforms into a brilliant white canvas, facilitating the creation of a vibrant palette of colored glazes. Experimentation with glazes and a variety of colors—black, white, green, iron red, ash, and blue and white porcelain—are hallmarks of Seto ceramics. Collectors and enthusiasts value E-Seto ceramics for their beauty, craftsmanship, and cultural heritage. Today, E-Seto ceramics continue to symbolize Japanese artistry, reflecting both traditional and contemporary influences.\n\nThey warmly welcome you to appreciate the origins of Seto pottery this summer!\n\nTo view their new online exhibition catalog, click here.\n\nTo learn more, click here.\n\nA Wedding Celebration, c. 1780, Tamil Nadu, Thanjavur, Company School, ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper\n\nThis week’s Gallery Spotlight shines upon San Francisco-based gallery, Art Passages. Founded in 2004, Art Passages specializes in Indian and Islamic paintings and works of art. Many of these fine pieces have been placed in significant private collections, as well as in major museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and Musee du Quai Branly in Paris.\n\nTheir recent show during Asia Week New York in March was an online presentation of Indian paintings exhibiting a wide array of schools and subject matter. Indian Paintings: Latest Acquisitions brought together works from Mughal portraiture to Company School, paintings that reflect the taste and interest of their patrons, such as Nobles, devotees, and English resident rulers of India. Among the highlights was Wedding Celebration, an exquisite Company School watercolor, circa 1788 seen above.\n\nAccompanying their exhibitions are in-depth scholarly catalogs that can all be viewed online here.\n\nInstallation view, Future Minded: New Works in the Collection, Special Exhibitions Gallery, Harvard Art Museums\n\nFuture Minded: New Works in the Collection\n\nClosing Sunday, July 21, 2024\n\n32 Quincy St, Cambridge, MA\n\nThis is the last week to view the Harvard Art Museums’ exhibition, Future Minded: New Works in the Collection, a selection of works acquired in recent years that exemplify their collecting vision and strategies. Nearly all are on display for the first time and staged across two adjacent galleries. This exhibition presents a range of drawings, photographs, prints, paintings, and sculptures spanning centuries and continents. The works are by roughly 30 artists, including Jean (Hans) Arp, Edward Mitchell Bannister, Willie Cole, Pietro Damini, Svenja Deininger, Jeffrey Gibson, Baldwin Lee, Ana Mendieta, Lucia Moholy, Toyin Ojih Odutola, Noriko Saitō, Melissa Shook, Jane Yang-D’Haene, and many others.\n\nThe museums are committed to acquiring art that expands the range of artists and cultures represented in the collections; that moves museum practice toward more nuanced understanding of both histories and contemporary issues; and that pushes boundaries and embraces experimentation. Many of the works on view are by living artists, an area of focused growth for the museums.\n\nThe galleries are free every day, so be sure to visit and view these newly acquired works before the show closes this Sunday.\n\nTo learn more, click here.\n\nCourtesy Fu Qiumeng Fine Art\n\nTranscultural Dialogues: The Journey of East Asian Art to the West\n\nOpening Reception: Thursday, July 18th, 5-8pm\n\nRotations: July 11-August 10 and August 13-September 14\n\nFu Qiumeng Fine Art is delighted to open Transcultural Dialogues: The Journey of East Asian Art to the West, a summer exhibition that explores the artistic evolution of East Asian traditions as they spread to the Western art milieu, focusing on the exchange and interaction of visual language and conceptual frameworks between traditional ink art and modern American art.\n\nPresented in two rotations, Transcultural Dialogues showcases works by more than 15 artists, including classical and modern masters Bada Shanren (1626-1705), Qi Baishi (1864-1957) and C.C. Wang (1907-2003), alongside contemporary artists such as Michael Cherney, whose artist language bridges the gap between tradition and the present offering reflections on identity, cultural exchange and the ongoing dialogue between East and West.\n\nThis exhibition is in collaboration with Hollis Taggart Gallery in Chelsea with each gallery presenting complimentary shows – one uptown and one downtown. While they will be showing Asian-American Abstraction: Historic to Contemporary, Fu Qiumeng is primarily focused on Chinese art spanning from the early 17th through the 20th centuries and into contemporary times, highlighting the early modernity and abstract quality of traditional ink masters alongside the reinterpretation of literati painting by diasporic Chinese artists who engaged with American Abstract Expressionism and explored notions of abstraction.\n\nThe exhibit is on view now, but be sure to join their reception next Thursday evening on July 18th!\n\nTo learn more, click here.\n\nPints and Prints: Hiroshige and Murakami Event; Utagawa Hiroshige.
