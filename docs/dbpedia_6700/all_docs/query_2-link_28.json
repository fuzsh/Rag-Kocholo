        "text": "The Hanging Cutscene occurs when the player “dies” in almost all circumstances, except for being killed by a shark, crocodile, or drowning.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nWhen the player loses health completely for the first time, they are dragged back to the main cannibal village and hung upside-down inside the cave. The player will wake up in a dark room, and can only see the lighter icon. Once the player lights their lighter, dramatic and intense music will play for a short time. The player looks up, then looks down. The player can then grab the plane axe from the ground and use it to cut themselves free.\n\nThe player will have severely low health at this stage though they will have all their items still in their backpack, nothing is lost from this cut scene except possibly pride.\n\nThe hanging cutscene does not advance time at all, they will wake up at the same time they were knocked unconscious.\n\nIf the player decides to not cut themselves free their stats will still lower and if they wait long enough once they cut themselves down they will instantly die.\n\nIf the player finds themselves in this situation again, it possible the player will die, the cannibals will eat the player instead of carrying them back.\n\nMultiplayer[]\n\nIn multiplayer, there is no hanging cutscene. Instead the player will drop down on all fours, they will be unable to move or speak using the walkie-talkie. The player can send messages via typing to call for aid. If the player does not reach help in time to be revived, the player will die. They will then respawn back at the plane as if they were starting the game again. They will be able to find their items and collect them. However, the players stats will be reset. This means strength and athleticism will be returned to their starting values. If the player wants to prevent this, it is recommended that they restart, whether they are a client or the host.\n\n[]"
