        "text": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino’s love letter to the golden age of cinema during the ‘60s. The film focuses on Rick Dalton, a washed-up actor, and his stunt double Cliff Booth as they try to reclaim their old success. Most of the runtime is dedicated to Rick and Cliff chasing opportunities, running into famous faces, and hanging out together. It’s only in the last twenty minutes that the film amps up the action, but Tarantino’s screenplay and the star power on display make for plenty of entertainment.\n\nSofia Coppola is known for bringing nuance to her work, and Lost in Translation is a perfect example. The film, set in Tokyo, follows an aging actor and a neglected young woman who form an unlikely friendship. Slow-paced and meditative, Coppola’s screenplay keeps its attention on the relationship and encounters between these two characters, relying on mood and emotion rather than any big twists or turns. It’s a simple story at its core, presented movingly and subtly.\n\nFilmed over twelve years, Boyhood follows the life of Mason from early childhood to college as he grows up before our eyes. The film is made of moments and encounters with Mason and his family, which shape his life and who he ultimately becomes. Besides that, not much else happens. It’s simply a time capsule that chronicles life's mundane yet pivotal parts. What makes Boyhood compelling for its nearly three-hour-runtime is the strong performances and authenticity of the script.\n\nPaterson follows a week in the life of the titular character, played by Adam Driver. He’s a bus driver who lives with his wife, follows the same daily routine, and writes poetry. While Paterson doesn’t sound like the most exciting movie, it works as a quiet observation of everyday life and the important little details that make it up. If viewers are willing to take a contemplative and philosophical journey, they’ll be rewarded. Plus, Driver is reliably compelling, as always.\n\nSet completely within the singular location of a car, Locke is a film where not a lot happens, yet so much does. Tom Hardy plays a construction worker who receives a phone call from a woman with whom he had a one-night stand, telling him she’s in labor. This threatens his reputation as a family man and his career ahead of a major project the next day. While the film is made up of Locke taking and making calls while driving, it's the urgency and stakes of the calls that will have viewers gripped.\n\nSet in the middle of nowhere with its offbeat humor and low-budget aesthetic, Napoleon Dynamite is a beloved cult classic. Awkward Napoleon lives in a small town where he decides to help his new friend win the class presidency. Dealing with the shenanigans of his steak-loving uncle, his chat-room-using brother, and his equally quirky classmates, Napoleon’s misadventures are monotonous and ordinary, yet delightfully bizarre and surprisingly crowd-pleasing.\n\nAs the 2021 winner of Best Picture at the Oscars, Nomadland was an unconventional choice, being the film with the least plot and action among the nominees. However, it offers a unique and therapeutic viewing experience that rewards viewers for their patience. Frances McDormand plays Fern, who decides to live as a nomad, traveling the country in her van. Predominately made up of conversations and scenic shots, the film offers an observant look at this specific lifestyle.\n\nDazed and Confused is much less of a movie than just a bunch of teens hanging out and getting stoned. Yet, that has cemented it as such a cult classic over the years. A group of senior students, led by Matthew McConaughey, celebrate their last day of high school by partying hard. Set within that day, it offers a slice-of-life portrait capturing the unique feeling of youth and uncertainty of the future. This is definitely a film about the vibes rather than an overarching structure.\n\nBefore Sunrise is a story about two strangers who spend a night together, knowing that they will probably never see each other again. Jesse, an American, meets Celine, who is French, as they cross paths in Europe before Jesse has to leave for the U.S. Despite not much happening, this romance film is never boring. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy’s chemistry and captivating dialogue help make Before Sunrise stand out in the genre and leave a profound impact afterward.\n\nFrom the Coen Brothers, The Big Lebowski follows The Dude, who is mistaken for a millionaire and gets himself caught up in a kidnapping case. Although the film has quite a convoluted plot, not much has actually happened or changed by its ending. The characters end up in the same position they were from the beginning. It’s a hangout movie centering on a bunch of slackers, with a crime caper on the side. Much like The Dude would do, viewers should simply abide.\n\nMovies don’t get more stripped-back and uneventful than Kevin Smith’s Clerks. The black-and-white film with a micro-budget follows a day in the life of two convenience store workers on the job. They talk about movies, deal with people who come into the store, lounge around, play hockey on the store roof, and hate their jobs. That’s pretty much it. Despite its lackluster plot, Clerks features authentic characters and witty dialogue that is effective due to the mundanity and relatability of it all.\n\nAnother film shot in black-and-white, Nebraska follows an elderly alcoholic man who embarks on a road trip with his estranged son to claim a lottery prize. Although his son and the film’s audience know this ticket is a scam, he travels with his stubborn father anyway. Despite the story ending with the pair driving back home empty-handed, it’s the content of their journey that has momentum. There’s a significant focus on this father-son relationship and the son’s struggle to connect to his father.\n\nAs one of the most beloved movies to come out of the ‘80s, The Breakfast Club is a film pretty much everybody has seen. Even though these characters, stuck in Saturday detention together, end the film as completely different people, they only physically stay in one place throughout its entirety. The events of The Breakfast Club are essentially confined to the school’s library, but the groundbreaking conversations and character development push the narrative forward.\n\nBefore Greta Gerwig directed Barbie, she starred in indie flick Frances Ha. Gerwig plays Frances, a dancer in her late twenties living in New York. She’s trying to deal with multiple things in her life, including finding a place to live, her career, and her relationships. While Frances’s experience is mostly mundane, it captures the basic struggle of trying to be an adult and figuring out life. Thanks to Gerwig’s performance and Noah Baumbach’s direction, it soars.\n\nA Ghost Story is a film that demands to be felt rather than simply watched. In an exploration of love, loss, and time, a deceased man reappears as a ghost and returns home to try to reconnect with his wife. It doesn’t follow a linear narrative and is more about atmosphere and mood than a concrete plot. The film comprises many long and quiet scenes, including a five-minute scene where Rooney Mara eats an entire pie as she mourns her husband.\n\nSet in the ruthless Australian outback, Walkabout follows two abandoned city children who learn to survive thanks to the help of an Aboriginal boy. While most of the film comprises these characters journeying through the quiet yet dangerous desert, the cinematography and unique editing make for a hypnotic and sensory viewing experience. Even though the story is quite simplistic and slow-paced, the images and filmmaking techniques build the stakes.\n\n20th Century Women takes a slow-burn approach to tell a layered coming-of-age story. Set during the ‘70s, the story follows a single mother who enlists the help of two other women, a free-spirited artist and her teenage neighbor, to help raise her adolescent son. There’s no major external conflict in this film. Still, the little moments of observation around motherhood, growing up, and the naturalistic occurrences in life make it so intriguing to watch.\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro is one of the most popular movies from Studio Ghibli, but it’s also the film with the lowest stakes. It follows two sisters who move to be closer to their sick mother, where they meet a forest spirit named Totoro and discover his magical world. There are no villains or major threats in the film, with much of the runtime dedicated to the girls exploring and playing with Totoro. However, its set-up demonstrates the power of wonder and fantasy during tough times.\n\nMid90s is a nostalgic and authentic portrait of youth and carefree summer days. Set in 1990s Los Angeles, the story follows thirteen-year-old Stevie, who befriends a group of older kids who skate like himself. The film is a reflective look at the ride of adolescence, including peer pressure, learning about the outside world, and finding your tribe. Stevie’s troubled home life adds some conflict, but it's the sentimental trip back to the ‘90s and simpler times that is most rewarding.\n\nShowcasing Will Ferrell in one of his more serious roles, Everything Must Go is about picking up the pieces in life. Ferrell plays Nick, an alcoholic who has just been fired and kicked out by his wife, with all his possessions on their front lawn. While simultaneously living on the front lawn, Nick holds a giant yard sale. The film moves at a slow pace and focuses on the unlikely friendships Nick forms at his lowest moments, with events predominately taking place on one street."
