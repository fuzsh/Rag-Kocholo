        "text": "There’s no doubt that following almost four months of lockdown, a big celebration party will be at the top of many people’s minds. Creative event themes are an amazing way to take any party to the next level – ensuring your guests have an awesome time and step away from a very memorable event.\n\nThe tricky part of your post-Covid event planning will be coming up with the perfect theme or party idea, and this is where Eventologists can add inspiration.

Was hope as you go through our list that you’ll feel inspired to get your own innovative ideas flowing.\n\nTop 75 Event Theme Ideas:\n\n2. Coachella Theme\n\nYou don’t need to feel the FOMO, grab your friends, and bring the party to you by hosting a Coachella-themed party to your garden. This festival is all about fashion, music and the arts so make sure that you set the BOHO themed dress code for your event with an epic playlist of the fave summer tracks. This arts and music festival should feature the compulsory larger-than-life sculptures to decorate your festival space – maybe over-sized butterflies, a Ferris wheel and flowers. Chill out on rugs and big cushions in tepees whilst sipping on colourful cocktails!\n\n4. Pop Art Theme\n\nWe’ve borrowed some inspiration from ‘Warhol’ to create this Pop Culture Theme that we love so much. There are so many great ideas to personalise this theme with Pop Art Style posters of attendees at the event, Bright Neon Colours, Silhouette Light Boxes dotted around the Room and even a bespoke dance floor to match the posters.\n\n7. 80’s Theme\n\nThe retro decade is a great era for a retro themed event, as it is connected to some of the most awesome pop, music, and fashion creations. 80’s theme events are just so much fun as we dance to our favourite soul music and practice those ‘Madonna Moves’. Slinky Ceiling Décor, Neon signage and Ghetto Blaster Boombox props transform spaces along with brightly coloured wall draping! Drop in some 80’s style posters and you’ve got one groovin’ party.\n\n8. 90’s Theme\n\nA 90’s theme so much fun and has grown in popularity as the generation as we see a comeback to some of our favourite shows such as Saved by The Bell and Friends. Guests dress up in their favourite characters for that extra authenticity. We can incorporate colourful 90’s decor such as paint Graffiti style backdrops, Iconic 90’s prop hire such as Giant Phones, CD’s, and Play Stations to create the atmosphere. Drop in that tribute boy band to create a night of nostalgia!\n\n9. Real Life Super Heroes Theme\n\nWe think this will be a popular theme because of so many superheroes that have impacted our lives during Covid. NHS heroes, Amazon delivery heroes, Joe Wicks, Captain Tom More – we think these people have inspired us and the world – there could even be a superhero within your organisation. A theme based around looking at the superhero within us or a living super hero theme will be a real feel good theme for people to enjoy! You could also make things more interesting by asking attendees to create their own superheroes and have a prize for the best one.\n\n10. Fictional Super Heroes Theme\n\nMarvel’s movie adaptation, Superhero films and many popular comics and stories, have always resonated with the child or the adult in us. A Super Heroes theme never fails to disappoint with endless choices of colour schemes, characters to dress up as and spaces to decorate such as a kryptonite cave for a bar, a sci-fi tunnel to walk through and even podiums with super hero props filling the space. There are so many options to create this into an immersive event with a storyline that runs throughout the event!\n\n11. Bubbles and Balloons Theme\n\nSuppliers such as Bubble Gum Balloons have inspired balloons to balloon installations, organic balloon displays that can create entrances, ceiling décor and balloon table centres. Link this all with bubble entertainers, bubbly at drinks reception and even bubble shaped chill out spaces making this a stunning celebratory theme after lockdown!\n\n12. Ibiza Chill Out Theme\n\nMissing your holiday fun? Ibiza is the holiday for party goers, so why not create a club style event or Café Del Mar style Beach Theme in an outdoor space, to replicate your holiday theme? Use Low white seating, white poseur tables, parasols lighting and lasers to set the scene. Throw in some sandpits, palm trees and some classic chilled Ibiza tracks to create the ambience!\n\n13. My 18-30 Holiday Theme\n\nEveryone remembers their first holiday away from their parents, sun, sea, sangria, and lots of memories of fun with friends. Our 18-30 Holiday Party Theme is as kitsch and cheesy as you want! The décor can be inflatable palm trees, beach chairs, beach umbrellas, pool floats, ball pools… entertainers serving tequila shots from empty pill bottles!\n\n14. A Night at the Drive-in Movies Theme\n\nCreate a drive-in experience or cinema theme whilst social distancing. You could go to town with this theme with movie props dotted around, cinema ticket invitations and ushers selling popcorn. Darken the lighting in the space and a giant screen could be dressed like the old-fashioned movies. Include movie look-alikes and Hollywood look-alike entertainers to create an immersive space to enjoy your presentation!\n\n15. Back to School Theme\n\nWe’ve all felt like kids during summer holidays during lockdown, so why not host a Back to School Event. Invite your attendees to dress up as school kids wearing old school uniforms and ties. Create a Tuck Shop for treats or drinks, create a school canteen style dining area. You could have the Stage backdrop as a graffiti wall. Everyone could self-distance on school desks and you could have digital graffiti walls for guests to leave their thoughts! Drinks Could be served from mini milk bottles and everyone will love the games that we set up in the playground as the bell rings!\n\n16. Hoedown Theme\n\nGo Wild West with barrels and hay bales with a country theme! Wild West style rustic décor could include rustic benches and tables, white or canvas bunting and string lights and a wooden a dance floor! For entertainment, how about some shoot-out games and a rodeo bull or for a totally interactive experience with guests!\n\n17. Game of Thrones Theme\n\nWho misses this most awesome epic box set – Game of Thrones hooked the world with its storyline and now hooks the Events Word with the endless possibilities for Game of Thrones Themed Events? If you’ve spent lockdown watching box sets then re-enacting your favourite TV series could be a great party theme. Dress your space to look like a cancel with castle walls, bridges, shields, that Game of Thrones tree. Get guests to dress as their favourite characters. Recreate the cities as ice palaces, go rustic with distressed décor like the north, or opulent like King’s Landing.\n\n18. Black & White Theme\n\nIf you missed a prom or a summer ball this year, an absolute classic event that works for Roaring 20’s, Hollywood – anything goes with Black and White Themed Events. It’s a classic that everyone attending can associate with as most people own black tuxedo’s or dresses. Black goes with everything so you can mix it up using other colour themes; some favourites include black and red at Valentines or for Moulin Rouge, black and gold for Glam and Glitz or 20s, Gold and White for Masquerade or even all white for Ibiza Theme. You can’t go wrong with this combination!\n\n19. Oktoberfest Theme\n\nIt looks like smaller events will return by Autumn. If you’re a pub chain, independent pub with a beer garden or a venue with an outdoor space, you could consider transporting guests to Munich in October with an Oktoberfest Themed Event! This German beer festival lends itself really well to an outdoor indoor theme, a marquee event or a rustic venue. Include picnic seats, rustic furniture hire of benches and tables. Colour palettes are often blue, white, browns and greens. You could include cool chandeliers, ribbon ceiling canopies and living walls for this theme!\n\n20. Harry Potter Theme\n\nKids and adults are missing their visit to Harry Potter Experience and even after over 20 years later – this book and film does not fail to disappoint as a live event? A Harry Potter themed Event could inspire you to include; Brick wall entrances with the 9 and ¾ sign, a game of Quidditch for team-building, spell book entrances, fire place props and rooms looking like libraries. Floating candles could create stunning ceiling décor and rustic benches and chairs can add the authenticity to your event for dining!\n\n21. Mardi Gras Theme\n\nWe’ve missed the Rio Carnival, Notting Hill Carnival and lots of Mardi Gras Celebrations this year, so it’s a great idea for a perfect pick-me-up party! Yellows, Greens and Purples, beads, butterflies and Mardi Gras masks are just what you need to recreate an elaborate Themed Party. Mardi Gras Table Centres in orange, pink or purple florals and feathers and get guests to arrive in home made parade floats for some fun! The vibrancy of this theme will make everything pop!\n\n22. Emerald City/Wizard of Oz Theme\n\nWho’s had a duvet day watching nostalgic films from their childhood this lockdown? Oz and The Emerald City with Dorothy and Friends is a classic that everyone turns to for a singsong and family viewing. Create the favourite film you’ve watched as a real life event for a party theme; The Emerald Palace, green up lighting, a forest tunnel that leads to a yellow brick road. We bring you characters from Oz to meet and greet guests or maybe they could do a virtual Wizard of Oz performance where everyone can have a sing song!\n\n23. Atlantis/Under The Sea Theme\n\nSplish Splash, our Mermaid bar and Underwater theme events are magical for those who miss exploring on their holidays. Our under the sea theme includes a magical see cave covered with coral and seaweed which guests walk through, blue lighting and underwater bars, as well as colourful floating tropical fish in the ceiling. You could also have hanging bubble balloons or jelly fish as chandeliers to truly make you believe that you are underwater. Finish off with balloon or coral underwater table centres for the finishing touches.\n\n24. An African Adventure Safari Theme\n\nWho doesn’t dream of being in the Masai Mara walking around like an explorer or travel photographer right now? This adventure takes you on holiday with the music and sound of The Lion King to uplift you! Décor ideas for an African Themed Event includes lots of animal print, African drums, African Shield props and lush flora and fauna of trees and hills and exotic floral table centres. The dress code could be animal print or safari guides! Guests could be greeted by animal stilt walkers, and then maybe African acrobatic troop could stun guests with their agility!\n\n25. Petting Zoo Theme\n\nBritain is all about UK farming and a day at the farm. We love this twist on a Great British Outdoors theme and the possibility of decor is endless here. Add rustic doors to the entrance of your farm that guests walk through. You can have barrels as poseur tables, hay bales for seating and green pastures where farm-yard props graze! This would suit indoor or outdoor events but don’t forget to hand out the wellies! Guests dress up as farmers and you could even bring the petting zoo to you for fun!\n\n26. Mindful Health Theme\n\nHere’s one that you can run virtually or as a live event even with smaller teams who return to work. A Healthy Body and Mind event theme that focuses on mindfulness, fitness, nutrition is great as there is so much evidence that this is correlated to productivity. You could create the outside inside with trees, grass and foliage as its proven that the outdoors is good for immunity. You could encourage attendees to attend in joggers or yoga wear and offer them bitesize workshops of things that they maynot have done before from high to low impact. You could offer a cooking class to help make better food selections by pointing out what food is good for different conditions. Smoothie or juice bars are popular and grazing stations with nuts, fruit and healthy snacks for throughout the day.\n\n27. Saturday Night Fever Theme\n\nEveryone knows the iconic 70’s tune that everyone dances to at parties. We love the 70’s era theme and all the glam that comes with it. We bring you mirror ball table centres, light up dance floors, glittery curtains and a host of 70’s themed décor. Imagine mirrors in the ceiling, light up letters and 70’s themed props! Guests could dress up with big hair, flared trousers and platform shoes to make it truly immersive.\n\n28. Alice In Wonderland and Mad Hatter Theme\n\nThis is one of our favourites as you can hold it inside or outside and make it totally yours with higgledy piggeldy touches. The book and movie was so out there so there are plenty of ideas to influence you to create a quirky event. Décor could be a large table in the middle of a the garden with lots of vintage crockery, interesting Alice table centres, foliage and floral centrepieces, living walls with a cheshire cat prop. You could have the rabbit leading everyone into the party through our hobbit hole entrance or play croquet with the Queen of Hearts. We could have upside down furniture and Mad Hatter Props from the ceiling and entertainers could re-enact the story as a Alice Themed cabaret show to make it even more magical!\n\n29. Midsummer Night’s Dream Theme\n\nThis is a magical theme for summer evening events and great as an outdoor or indoor event. This Shakespeare themed event can include influences from the play with Italian themed props, outdoor props but always with natural décor, artificial trees, pretty white flowers and lots of foliage décor. We love hanging birdcages centrepieces or twiggy blossom table centres the theme. We love the idea of alfresco dining, a Mediterranean dining experience with meat platters, fresh fruit and stunning displays of salads along with fresh summer cocktails!\n\n30. Diamonds are Forever Theme\n\nDiamonds are a girl’s best friend and totally oozes gorgeousness. We love bling themed events with shiny and sparkly decor that works so well as a theme for summer balls or charity events. We love crystal centrepieces and sparkly table centres along with luxurious tablecloths. We love using mirror tables, mirror dancefloors, mirror bar and contemporary furniture hire to reflect against the lighting. The colour options are endless with this theme, from black and silver, to white and silver or navy and silver to maximise this luxury event theme.\n\n31. Masquerade Theme\n\nVenetian themed events always have an element of mystery as people dress up in masks and stunning ball gowns. A masquerade theme is great for events where you want guests to dress up in formal wear. A general favourite for charity events and corporate events where décor could include venetian painted backdrops, Italian décor such as busts and roman pillars, giant mask props, fountains and water features, as well as masquerade mask centrepieces.\n\n32. James Bond/007 Theme\n\nWho’s watched a 007 film during lockdown? Everyone knows the line ‘Bond, James Bond!’ and we just love action, romance and excitement of a Bond Themed Event! Most people connect a 007 theme with a black tie event, always highly styled including a few 007 look-a-like characters and cabaret show! Decor can range from feather plume centrepieces to crystal centrepieces something with bond themed backdrops and the obligatory casino hire! and don’t forget to serve the signature drink: a martini, shaken not stirred.\n\n33. Medieval Banquet Theme\n\nKnights jousting, long table banquets, sword fights and tight corseted entertainers all say one thing – a Knights Ball or a Medieval Themed Event. Since Game of Thrones, this theme has been popular and works well for a large buffet on long rustic wood tables and benches. Incorporate other décor such as shields, coat of arms and thrones to complete the look.\n\n34. Hippy Theme\n\nThe summer of love only indicates one era – the 60’s! This groovy theme just makes everyone smile with tie dye costumes, peace sign props, flower power props, rainbow colour décor around camp-fires and on beaches! Include a VW camper van peep through or even a VW camper van street food cart to finish the look. We love this colourful theme and its ability to ignite the excitement in older guests as well as the young ones!\n\n35. Downton Abbey in the Roaring 20’s Theme\n\nLong summers and sophistication of the 20’s means that this is a popular theme for events for many. The era of flappers, prohibition, glamor and gangsters and vintage cars lends itself well for a dress up party. Choose a classic, black, white and claret color scheme with touches of gold and opulent table centres. It was the time of flappers so feather head-dresses and knee length fringe dresses would work well as fancy dress. And don’t forget plenty of spirits and martini glasses – it’s the era of prohibition where it’s all about the vintage theme bar! Use a champagne glass tower as a statement piece in the room, lots of chandeliers and tiffany lamp table centres and plenty of art deco props to finish the look!\n\n36. Hollywood Theme\n\nLights, Camera, Action! This red carpet theme is all about the glitz and glamour of black tie and ball gowns. Everyone loves a Hollywood A-list event with paparazzi photographers and the awards dinner. You can turn your awards dinner into an Oscar-themed event with golden statues and get winners to give speeches and have their photos against a winners backdrop. For a classic Hollywood theme night, there are so many Film themed props to choose from clapper boards, movie cameras, movie reels and film posters and silhouettes of your favourite stars!\n\n37. King of the Jungle Theme\n\nA Jungle theme is becoming ever more popular as an option for a Green Theme or a Sustainable Theme. Our interpretation of it involves foliage, vines, plants, trees, exotic animals, water features and animal print plus a throne for the King or Queen! An alternative fun option is a Jungle Book theme with all the characters and songs that make this Disney Film so Classic! A great option for corporate events, an “I’m an guest, get me out of here!” where we can give them a set of activities in teams during the event like blind tasting or feeling what’s in the jar! You could also include, meet and greet entertainers dressed up as stilt walking animals!\n\n38. Passport to Paradise Theme\n\nWho doesn’t want to travel to somewhere far and exotic? A travel theme will be really popular throughout the year especially now there are restrictions on travel. The Around the World Theme allows you to create zones of the best places around the world from a Far East Themed area, to a Paris Themed zone, a New York Themed entrance, to Mediterranean Themed Dining area. You could choose a destination as the full theme of the event like ‘come away with me to Vegas’ and base your event on that. In which case, think about the iconic sights of the country. We like a globe-trotting theme as it allows us to mix and match everything about our favourite countries. You could include a Giant Earth Globe in the middle, or a Capital Cities quiz, perhaps a globe centrepiece and themed backdrops for different countries. Entertainment could be from dancers representing world nations, so you could limbo in the Caribbean zone, whilst bhangra to the latest Bollywood beats of India.\n\n39. Outdoor BBQ Theme\n\nWho doesn’t think about Barbecues in the summer sun? But this theme works well in outdoor spaces, beer gardens and gardens, indoor venues a-like. For the ultimate summer fun, we love this summer inspired theme. Have a camp-fire prop in the middle of the space with a barbecue behind, include interesting garden-seating like deck chairs, sun loungers, hammocks and bean bags to create a chilled vibe. Serve drinks from an Aperol bar which is highly trendy right now. A barbecue themed event creates a really casual vibe whilst being great as a networking opportunity.\n\n40. Unicorn Themed Event\n\nAre they real? Are they magical? Unicorns are so popular but people always associate it with children’s parties but in light of many feeling really uplifted and happy, Unicorn Themed Parties are great idea as an unusual theme for an event. The Event Décor ideas for this theme lends itself to so much, pastel coloued seating, rainbows, pastel coloured unicorns, glitter face artists, clouds in the ceiling, balloons and organic balloon arches – the options are endless. And in stilt walking fairies for extra magic and this makes a really out-there idea for a party.\n\n41. Glamping Theme\n\nFor those of you who love the comforts of your hotel room and have nightmares of the thought of ever Camping, a Glamping Themed Event could be exactly what you need to change your mind about the camping. This could either be in real Glamping Tents Outdoors or we can bring a Glamping Experience to your venue with draped ceiling, festoon lights, a faux fire pit for toasted marshmallows and lots of outdoor games. Glamping makes a really great networking theme as it allows people to bond outside of normal corporate boundaries. Integrate team-building games and Scouts style challenges that really adds to the impressiveness of the event!\n\n42. Caribbean Nights Theme\n\nWe transport you to your favourite Caribbean Island with warm sandy beaches, sunsets, sun loungers, palm trees and cocktails served from coconuts – it’s the ultimate Caribbean themed Event! Steel drum entertainment, limbo games inflatables and a volleyball net. Chill at the tiki bar for a rum cocktail and then create a Jamaican dining experience with street food stalls serving the BEST Jerk Chicken in town. Finally onto the dancefloor to listen to those epic reggae tunes.\n\n43. Futuristic Theme\n\nFuturistic need not be a Space Theme or a Star Wars Theme. You can be as visionary as you want with this creative theme. You can choose to set the era, the tone and mould the event and décor to suit your event objectives. We love using contemporary table centres, out of the ordinary ideas, using mirror bars and contemporary white furniture. Alternatively, you could create an LED theme with Lit Table Centres, Stilt-walking robots, plenty of metallic and silver colour schemes, neon lighting and laser effects as well as some pyrotechnics. Create a story line around it, was it the start of a new virtual world – well we leave it to your imagination!\n\n44. Casino Themed Event\n\nChing-Ching, we’re in the money! Casino Hire is really popular for events with games such as roulette, blackjack, craps, poker and spin the wheel. It’s often integrated with a Vegas Themed Event as people love the excitement of Vegas. Include lots of Casino themed props such as giant dice, giant dollar sign props and Casino Themed Backdrops. Add in some gorgeous Casino themed table centres such as dollar sign centrepieces and playing card table centres for finishing touches!\n\n45. Outside Inside Theme\n\nThis is one of our favourites and never fails to delight! Bring nature inside to create a hidden garden, or an enchanted forest, somewhere dark in the woods! We create stunning living walls with plenty of foliage and flowers, artificial grass carpets covers venue carpets, a meandering tunnel with fairy lights welcomes guests into the room and a large swing makes a great photo opportunity for guests to take pictures. This is such an Instagrammable Theme and the opportunities to brand on products, showcase Sustainable Policies and talk about Green Matters is immense!\n\n46. Lockdown Outside Theme\n\nOften used for Mad Hatter style events and could be so popular after lockdown is creating the inside of your living room, dining room, bedroom in an outdoor event space. Guests could come in pyjamas and walk through wardrobe doors into a room of your choice! You could including wallpapered living walls, luxurious indoor furniture such as sofas and dressers, dining tables, rugs and carpets, side tables, tall lamps and walls with hanging mirrors. Add in a large screen that looks like a TV screen to present guests prizes for the most innovative lockdown activities.\n\n47. Olympic Theme\n\nWe all missed the Olympics this year, but you don’t have to wait for another Olympics Year to roll around – just incorporate it into your theme! People love sporting themed events in the summer or during worldwide events such as the World Cup. Sports Themed Events allow you to theme tables, display silhouettes of your favourite sports, include a winners podium with medals for the awards dinner and include interactive sports games after dinner!\n\n48. Up In The Air Theme\n\nLet’s all imagine our next holiday again as we take you to the skies with a blue sky themed event. This theme is packed with everything you imagine for your holiday abroad! You will be issued a boarding pass invitation which you present at security. You will walk through the security gates where you’ll be greeted by pilots and flight attendants serving drinks. Large Cloud Props and aeroplane props create great ceiling chandeliers. Create a First-Class Lounge as the outside area with seating. The bar could be the inside of an aeroplane. The sky’s the limit for this theme and you can transport guests to any destination you desire.\n\n49.

Once upon a Time Theme\n\nLet’s face it, we will all have a story or two to tell after Lockdown! A story theme is popular because it lends itself to corporate and private events! You can focus on one story or you blend lots of stories such as a Fairytale Theme or a Roald Dahl Theme, focusing on the author. Walk through a storybook style entrance through to a room with screens showcasing pages from the book. Include quirky props such as a book tree, library walls and book table centres to bring the event alive. Have entertainers, walking guests through the story. You could even do an Agatha Christie style, murder mystery event that completely engages guests!\n\n52. Bollywood Theme\n\nJai-Ho! Since the blockbuster film Slumdog Millionaire, a Bollywood Themed Party has been a popular choice for its music, dance, vibrant colors and most of all the food that lends itself to formal dining or street food. Everything is colourful with a Bollywood theme manages red, blues, pinks, purple and gold all work well in an Indian theme. Include mood lighting in these colours for added effect. We love including low seating, Indian rugs and colourful cushions in seating. Use Indian idol props and elephants statues as props, wall and ceiling draping work well to lower high ceilings. For entertainment, Dhol drummers, Bollywood dancers, henna artists work so well to create the theme. If its outside, why not get everyone to come in white and have a holi powder party!\n\n53.

Great Gatsby Theme\n\nWe’ve all missed wearing our posh frocks and partywear having spent months living in loungewear, so we think a Great Gatsby Party will be a very popular theme to hold anywhere. It’s always a popular theme idea for summer balls, gala dinners, weddings and black-tie events because of the endless possibilities for lavish décor in gold and black, glitz and glam props, stunning party entrances and extravagant table centres. However, a roaring 20’s theme or a Gatsby Party theme can be easily adapted to smaller events and lower budgets, by using a colour pallet of gold and black colour.\n\n57. Space Theme\n\nThe launch of SpaceX means that we’re all loving the idea of going into space so how about an evening event with a space theme? Choose dark colour palettes, or even an outdoor event which will be complemented by twinkly lights and stars. For an indoor event, use black star cloth hire, you could hang large planets in the ceiling, and maybe the moon centrepieces with black tablecloths, with space being the main theme. If you’re thinking of entertainment, how about having a speaker such as Sir Tim Peak or what about walk about space characters?\n\n58.
