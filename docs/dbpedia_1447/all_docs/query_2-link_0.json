Duryea, Jr. State Office Building In Suffolk County (Suffolk County)\n\nGovernor George E. Pataki today joined State and local officials at a ceremony officially designating the Perry B. Duryea, Jr. State Office Building on Veterans Memorial Highway in the Town of Islip, Suffolk County. The Governor signed legislation naming the building for the former Speaker of the Assembly in honor of his contributions and commitment to the people of Long Island and New York State.\n\n“Perry Duryea remains one of the most highly respected and admired Assembly Speakers in State history,” Governor Pataki said. “During his long and distinguished career in public service, Speaker Duryea dedicated his heart and soul to the people of New York, and especially the citizens of Long Island. It is fitting that this State Office Building should be named in his honor so that New Yorkers today, and in future generations, will remember his dedication and significant contributions to our great State.” Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno said, “Perry Duryea’s extraordinary leadership and many outstanding contributions had an immensely profound impact on New York State government. The State Office Building being named in his honor is a fitting tribute to Speaker Duryea’s legacy in serving the people of Long Island and New York.”\n\nAssembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said, “As both Assembly Speaker and Minority Leader, Perry Duryea distinguished himself as a true statesman and an extraordinary leader. His legacy is one of significant accomplishments and historical advances for the Legislature. He is widely credited for elevating the status of the Legislature – fighting for greater independence and professionalism throughout the institution. I congratulate him on this well-deserved honor and wish him and his family continued happiness.”\n\nAssembly Minority Leader Charles Nesbitt said, “Perry Duryea is one of our state’s greatest leaders who helped guide New York through some of the most challenging times in our history. His legacy has helped build a brighter future for generations of New Yorkers, but he always held Suffolk County first. It is a fitting tribute that the central state office building in Suffolk County is named in honor of its first son.”\n\nPerry Duryea, Jr. said, “I am deeply honored to receive this special recognition for my years of public service to the people of New York and Suffolk County. I have always appreciated the value of my experience in the Legislature, the friends and colleagues I met and enjoyed working with over the years and the wonderful opportunity I had to serve the people of New York as Speaker of the Assembly. I entered the public arena with the attitude that I could make a difference, and I sincerely hope that my time in some measure helped to address some of the challenging issues of the time.”\n\nSenator Kenneth LaValle said, “Assemblyman Perry Duryea, Jr.'s distinguished public service is truly worthy of this honor. Perry Duryea's contributions to Long Island communities and the state are extensive and impressive. His vision and leadership were significant to the shaping of legislation that continues to impact our daily lives. I am privileged to have had the opportunity to work with such a fine statesman and I continue to hold him in the highest regard.”\n\nAssemblyman Fred Thiele said, “Perry Duryea has given decades of distinguished service to Long Island and the State of New York. His work to develop and expand the state park system on eastern Long Island was the forerunner of current efforts to protect open spaces. His tenure in the State Assembly, particularly as Speaker and Minority Leader, is still respected in Albany today. This legislation is a fitting tribute to his career of public service.”\n\nPerry Duryea, Jr. began his career in public service as a member of the Montauk Public School Board of Education. Like his father, Perry B. Duryea, who served in the State Legislature as a State Senator from the 1st Senate District, Duryea was elected to the State Legislature as a State Assemblyman in 1960, representing the First Assembly District.\n\nDuring his nearly two decades in the Assembly, Duryea served 12 years as the top Republican leader. He was Speaker of the Assembly from 1969 to 1973 and served as Minority Leader from 1966 through 1968 and again from 1974 to 1978.\n\nDuryea also served as president of the Long Island State Park Commission, Bethpage Park Authority, and Jones Beach State Parkway Authority between 1963 and 1969. His leadership contributed significantly to the legacy of the park system and the preservation of open space on Long Island.\n\nDuryea continues to serve his community through his work with numerous public and private organizations, including Long Island Commercial Bank, where he is Chairman of the Board. He has been Chairman since the inception of the Bank in January of 1990. Duryea resides in Montauk, NY with his wife, Trace. He has two grown children, Perry and Lynn and two grandchildren.\n\nPerry B. Duryea, Jr., was born in Montauk, New York and graduated from East Hampton High School. After earning his BA from Colgate University in 1942, Duryea joined the U.S. Naval Air Transport Service where he attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He served in World War II as a plane commander flying four-engine seaplanes in the South Pacific theater. Following his service in WWII, Duryea ran his family’s seafood distribution business in Montauk.\n\nNew York owns and operates more than 40 state office buildings and complexes. Over the years, many have been named for prominent New Yorkers who have had a significant impact on their community and the state. Examples include the Eleanor Roosevelt State Office Building in Poughkeepsie, the Mayor Erastus Corning II Tower in Albany, and the Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. State Office Building in Harlem. The naming of state office buildings can be accomplished either through the passage of legislation or by Executive Order of the Governor.\n\n“As the caretaker of the State’s many public office buildings, OGS is proud to work with our Governor, the State Legislature and local communities to appropriately recognize the contributions of prominent New York leaders,” OGS Commissioner Ringler said. “The new Perry B. Duryea, Jr. State Office Building serves as a focal point for government and community activity in Suffolk County, and it is fitting that it should be named for someone whose leadership has had such a profound impact on the region and our State.” ###"
