        "text": "Matthew Sloane, principal at Middleburgh Jr/Sr High School, has been selected as the 2024 New York State Secondary School Principal of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given annually to a middle or high school principal who has set the pace, character, and quality of education for the students in his or her school. Nominees are administrators who are committed to students, parents, and the community and have shown exceptional contributions to the educational process.\n\nSloane will also represent New York State as the NASSP NYS Principal of the Year as sponsored by SAANYS’ national affiliate, the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP). NASSP will select the national principal of the year from all the state finalists.\n\nAmong his many accomplishments throughout his career, Sloane has been instrumental in overhauling the “entire culture of the building” at Middleburgh Jr/Sr High, a change which he says, “has been the most rewarding.” He explains that there were “significant social and emotional health issues” when he arrived as principal and he had many conversations with those involved, including students, staff, and community members.\n\nRealizing a change was necessary, he “approached the PEAR (Partnership in Education and Resiliency) Institute, a social and emotional research group, and together we began the work to overhauled the entire culture of the building. We focused on creating an environment of belonging, acceptance and collaboration.” He says the “results were immediate. There was a palpable difference in the way students interacted with staff, each other, how they approached their academics and the overall safety of the building.”\n\nSloane adds that, “As the initiative continued to grow, students began to develop trusting relationships with the school and feel ownership and belonging. We leveraged this trust during the current school year, where we made a unanimous decision to create a distraction free environment free of cell phones and devices.” Now, Sloane says, the students “feel that the school cares about them as individuals and we have seen a shift where students will share their needs with the understanding they will be heard and supported.”\n\nEstablishing a new culture, “an inclusive and empowering environment within the school and surrounding community” has been integral to Sloane’s work as principal as well as to the students’ success. He says that he is “constantly looking at equity through three lenses: academic, economic, and belonging.” In addition, he and his team emphasize “the importance of social and emotional well-being.” He explains that “By fostering an inclusive and empathetic environment, we addressed the unique challenges faced by students and staff, promoting emotional resilience and enhancing the overall well-being of the school community.” Sloane emphasizes that “It is our goal to make sure every student feels a sense of belonging.”\n\nAmy Irwin, Middleburgh Elementary School principal, notes that Sloane “encourages innovative thinking for his faculty and his students. He is always open to new ideas and fresh thinking when it comes to teaching and learning. He is an advocate for all students, keeping in constant communication with families through good times and difficult times.”\n\nMiddleburgh Central School District Superintendent of Schools, Mark Place, says that Sloane’s “knowledge, skills, and experience sets him apart from other principals.” Place adds that, as principal at Middleburgh Jr/Sr High, Sloane “has overseen the school’s transformation from a school under review to one in good standing. The school is now recognized as one of the Top 10 High Schools in the Capital Region as rated by US News and World Report. This designation has only been possible because of Mr. Sloane’s focus on continuous improvement and laser-like focus on evaluating our data and supporting our instructional staff.”\n\nSloane received his bachelor’s degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo, a master’s degree in secondary education from Suffolk University, a master’s degree in educational leadership from Emmanuel College, and a school district leadership certificate from the College of St. Rose.\n\nSloane and fellow 2024 award winners will be recognized at SAANYS’ annual awards celebration, taking place on May 3 at the Saratoga Hilton in Saratoga Springs, New York.\n\nSAANYS represents nearly 22,000 school administrators, supervisors, and retirees. As a professional association, SAANYS is committed to providing direction, service, and support to the membership in their efforts to improve the quality of education and leadership in New York State schools. SAANYS is affiliated with the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) and the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP).\n\nHunger Solutions New York has been selected as the recipient of the 2024 Friend of Education Award by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given to an individual, group, or organization that has consistently contributed to the support and advancement of outstanding public education and the students of New York State.\n\nHunger Solutions New York is a statewide nonprofit organization dedicated to alleviating hunger. The organization works to expand, improve, and maximize participation in federal nutrition assistance programs, including SNAP, WIC, school meals, summer meals, and meal programs for child care and afterschool programs. Through a combination of statewide outreach and education, community-based services, and legislative and policy advocacy, Hunger Solutions New York helps New Yorkers access the food they need.\n\nFor over 30 years, Hunger Solutions New York has worked to maximize access to school meals through outreach and individualized assistance to school districts across New York State, helping schools strengthen their meal programs to reach more children. They also advocate for federal and state policies to improve school meal programs, most recently co-leading the Healthy School Meals for All New York Kids coalition of more than 290 organizations – including SAANYS – advocating for statewide universal free school meals. Last year, the coalition helped secure a historic state investment that expanded free school meals to more than 347,000 additional students across the state.\n\nHunger Solutions New York is proud to work with SAANYS members who are passionate about alleviating hardship for their students and families. Through the years, they have provided school administrators with best practices, resources, and strategies to expand access to federal nutrition assistance programs.\n\n“We are honored to receive this recognition from our valued partners at SAANYS,” said Andrés Vives, Executive Director of Hunger Solutions New York. “School administrators are true anti-hunger champions. Over our many years of partnership, we have been inspired by your commitment to ensure children’s access to nutrition at school and beyond. We look forward to continuing our advocacy together to strengthen and expand access to school meal programs, while also ensuring families are connected with programs like SNAP and WIC to support food security at home. We – and New York’s school administrators – know the vital importance of nutrition for children’s health and academic success.”\n\nHunger Solutions New York and fellow 2024 award winners will be recognized at SAANYS’ annual awards celebration, taking place on May 3 at the Saratoga Hilton.\n\nSAANYS represents nearly 22,000 school administrators, supervisors, and retiree leaders. As a professional association, SAANYS is committed to providing direction, service, and support to the membership in their efforts to improve the quality of education and leadership in New York State schools.\n\nSAANYS is affiliated with the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) and the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP).\n\nFarid Johnson, principal at Siwanoy Elementary School in the Pelham Union Free School District, has been selected as the 2024 New York State Elementary Principal of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given to a SAANYS member who is committed to excellence, has programs designed to meet the academic and social needs of all students, and has firm ties to parents and the community.\n\nOne of Mr. Johnson’s most significant accomplishments as principal has been the Siwanoy CultureFEST. FEST is for Food, Entertainment, Stories, and Traditions. Mr. Johnson says, “the idea of CultureFEST was born out of the ideology of bringing everyone together to cultivate the idea that we are all different, and that is a beautiful thing!” He adds that “Cultural awareness, appreciation, and recognition are extremely important” to him as an educator and a father.\n\nThe Spring Festival is growing and brings together many individuals and families. Mr. Johnson explains that “Siwanoy did not have a cultural celebration to this magnitude before I became principal here, and if I ever leave, it is now a tradition that will always take place each spring. The impact on the community has been positive and overwhelmingly powerful.” He adds that “Understanding how culture affects us as a society and school community is embedded in everything I do as an educator.”\n\nBest practices for Mr. Johnson include “visibility” and “building relationships to increase flexible thinking.” He explains that a principal “should be seen throughout the school on a daily basis. Most of the time should be spent in classrooms. Spending time in classrooms with students helps you to build strong and positive relationships with the students and teachers alike.”\n\nMr. Johnson further explains that flexible thinking is critical for a school principal, who should “be able to live in the gray area. My job is to prepare students for the real world, and the real world is not black and white. There are nuances and many experiences that will need to be handled in a flexible manner. I believe building strong and positive relationships will help navigate the gray area when leading a school.”\n\nAt his previous school, Stony Point Elementary School in Rockland County, Mr. Johnson looked for a solution for a school that had undergone changes resulting in a large number of students being sent to the principal. He says, “one of my first goals was to change how behaviors were handled, and the focus was also on changing the behaviors at the onset.” Collaborating with his administrative team and a parent, he helped develop HEART (Honesty, Empathy, Attitude, Respect, Teamwork).\n\nThe team “developed a matrix to exemplify what HEART looked like in different areas such as hallways, lunch and recess, the school bus, the classroom, etc.” The initiative was successful as “extreme behaviors began to dissipate, students were sent to the office far less, and the school community was actually coming together to rally behind this initiative. Our test scores went up as well because the level of instruction rose, and students were coming to school feeling safe to now only focus on their learning. The HEART initiative at my former school is still something they use as the fabric of everything they do. It’s a huge legacy piece for me that they still use what I started.”\n\nMadeleine Mercer, Siwanoy PTA president-elect and parent, says, “Principal Johnson is an extremely creative, collaborative, and innovative principal. He is always willing to work with teachers, students, and parents to bring in exciting opportunities for students, and engage the entire school community.”\n\nAlice Bowman, Assistant Superintendent for Teaching and Learning of Pelham Public Schools, speaks highly of Farid Johnson, “I have had the privilege of working with Farid for the past two years, and I can attest to his unwavering commitment to student wellbeing. He exemplifies a student-centered approach, demonstrating a genuine affinity for people and fostering an environment where students feel secure. Farid effectively engages with students and parents alike, building and nurturing strong relationships between home and school. His innovative mindset has led to the development of pertinent discussion topics for parents, offering insights into how they can support their children at home. Notably, Farid is known for his candidness and honesty, qualities highly regarded in our team. He prioritizes the well-being of students, holding staff to high standards while providing unwavering support. Furthermore, Farid’s dedication to self-improvement is evident in his continual pursuit of knowledge and his commitment to becoming a better leader.”\n\nMr. Johnson has been active in education in the state of New York since 2004. He received his bachelor of science and master of science from Manhattanville College, received a master of science from Bank Street College, and is currently pursuing a doctorate of education at St. John Fisher.\n\nMr. Johnson and fellow 2024 award winners will be recognized at SAANYS’ annual awards celebration, taking place on May 3 at the Saratoga Hilton.\n\nSAANYS represents nearly 22,000 school administrators, supervisors, and retiree leaders. As a professional association, SAANYS is committed to providing direction, service, and support to the membership in their efforts to improve the quality of education and leadership in New York State schools. SAANYS is affiliated with the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) and the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP).\n\nDr. Joanne Lane, retired administrator from the Sullivan West Central School District, has been selected as the recipient of 2024 Irving Schwartz Distinguished Retiree Award by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). Irving Schwartz was a founding member of SAANYS. This award is given annually to a retired SAANYS member who, in retirement, has made significant contributions to the welfare of the association, education, and the greater community.\n\nLane has been active in education in the state of New York since 1978. She began her career as a certified speech-language pathologist in hospital, residential and public school settings, and retired as an assistant superintendent for student support services. She also served as an adjunct lecturer for SUNY New Paltz, from which she retired in 2022. Lane has held board positions in community and professional organizations, was vice president for community and affiliate relations for NYSASCD as well as the president of the Mid-Hudson affiliate of NYSASCD. Her programs have been recognized by NYSED as exhibiting best practices, and she has been a conference speaker at multiple professional organizations.\n\nConcerned about the “the lack of attention paid to special education training in principal preparation programs,” she recently researched and wrote, The Principal’s Special Education Calendar – A month by month roadmap to building consistency, equity, and compliance, which has been accepted for publication and is set to be released in the fall. Lane notes that the book addresses “a school leader’s special education responsibilities. It offers a pragmatic, ‘in the trenches’ roadmap for managing the spectrum of special education duties under their governance.”\n\nAmong her many notable accomplishments, Lane has been instrumental in equipping “parents with the information, tools, and confidence they need to understand and maneuver through the intricacies of special education, and to see them evolve into powerful advocates for their children.” She adds that, “This commitment to advocacy and inclusion is in line with the ethos of endorsing best educational practices and fostering continual development. Being able to meaningfully impact a child’s educational journey is the pinnacle of success in this field.”\n\nAs an adjunct lecturer, Dr. Lane says she “aimed to instill in principal candidates a pragmatic comprehension of special education and the critical role they would assume as future administrators, with an emphasis on social justice and educational leadership.” She notes that in retirement, she has “been able to consult and provide training in a variety of areas concerning special education, such as reflecting on one’s own practices for improvement, and focusing on student outcomes by examining Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) to ensure alignment with state standards, as IEPs play a decisive role in tailoring educational experiences to meet the unique needs of students with disabilities.”\n\nIn her tenure in the public school system in New York, Lane also served as a K-6 Principal, CPSE/CSE chairperson, and director of special education in rural and suburban school districts in Ulster and Dutchess Counties. Joyce Long, director of special education for the Mohonasen Central School District, says that, “Mrs. Lane has dedicated her career of over 37 years to children with special needs with a strong focus on programming and supporting the needs of all children in public schools.”\n\nLane received her Bachelor of Arts from Hunter College, Master of Science in education from SUNY Buffalo State, and her doctorate in education leadership from Seton Hall University.\n\nLane and fellow 2024 award winners will be recognized at SAANYS’ annual awards celebration, taking place on May 3 at the Saratoga Hilton.\n\nSAANYS represents nearly 22,000 school administrators, supervisors, and retiree leaders.

This award is given annually to a SAANYS member who has made outstanding contributions in New York State schools through public education, professional organizations, or research and/or writing in the field of education.\n\nBonanno serves on the NYS Blue Ribbon Commission on Graduation Measures, saying that her work “involves contributing my expertise to enhance educational standards, promote student success and shape policies that positively impact graduation rates.” She adds that serving on the commission “signifies a commitment to improving the educational setting and ensuring better outcomes for students.”\n\nIntegral to her accomplishments with improving student outcomes is her work with the Collective Efficacy initiative. Bonanno explains that collective efficacy is “a shared belief that the school’s staff can have a positive impact on student achievement, despite other influences in the students’ lives that challenge their success.” She adds that collective efficacy “is evident when teachers see themselves as part of a team working for their students.”\n\nRecently, the commissioner of the New York State Education Department, Dr. Betty Rosa, visited PS 60 and observed collective efficacy in action. She then asked Bonanno and the Alice Austen School community to be the first lab site in New York City. The NYS Education Department Chancellor, Dr. Lester Young, and Regent Christine Cea then visited PS 60 “to solidify our community as a lab site school and highlight collective efficacy.”\n\nBonanno says that “this initiative will allow school leaders to support rigorous curriculum, instruction, and assessment to embody high expectations for student learning. Students will have equitable access to learning opportunities, as well as academic and social supports for pursuits of greater knowledge.” Taking the collective efficacy initiative “beyond state, city, and district,” Bonanno presented at the 2023 ASCD Annual Conference in Colorado, speaking on “The Equity Project: Developing and Elevating Student Voice and Agency to Impact School Culture, Climate, and the Instructional Core.”\n\nBrigitte McCue, assistant principal for PS 60, the Alice Austen School, says that Bonanno’s work and accomplishments embody “the qualities of an outstanding educational leader. Her visionary approach to education has transformed our school into a thriving, inclusive, and nurturing environment for both students and staff. Under her leadership, our school has seen remarkable improvements in student achievement, parent and community engagement, and overall school culture.”\n\nMcCue adds that one of Bonanno’s “greatest strengths is her ability to foster a sense of unity and collaboration among teachers, staff, and students. Her open-door policy and willingness to listen to diverse perspectives have created a school environment where every voice is heard and valued. This sense of inclusivity has had a profound impact on our school community, resulting in improved student morale and a more harmonious learning atmosphere.”\n\nAdded Peter McNally, executive director of NYS Federation of School Administrators, “Donna has been a master educator and child advocate since her first year as a first grade teacher to the present as an Outstanding Principal.”\n\nBonanno has been active in education in the state of New York since 1999. She has served as principal for PS 60 since 2014. She received her bachelor’s degree from the College of Staten Island, her master’s degree from Hunter College, and an advanced studies diploma from the College of Saint Rose.\n\nBonanno and fellow 2024 award winners will be recognized at SAANYS’ annual awards celebration, taking place on May 3 at the Saratoga Hilton.\n\nSAANYS represents nearly 22,000 school administrators, supervisors, and retiree leaders.

The SAANYS Leadership and Support Award was established to recognize the outstanding leadership efforts of those members whose responsibilities require leadership through support services to educators and students across and between school buildings and/or districts.\n\nBrown’s leadership for the Town of Webb Union Free School District (UFSD) includes his work as assistant principal, special education director, and athletic director for grades K-12. He began his career with the New York education system as a special education teacher for the Central Square School District in 2006. He then served as a special education teacher for the Oswego City School District for 15 years. Brown joined the Town of Webb UFSD in 2021 and took on the additional position of special education director for K-12 in 2023.\n\nOf his work as a leader for the Town of Webb UFSD, Brown says that “As a school administrator, implementing Steven Covey’s principle of ‘Think Win-Win’ is paramount for fostering a positive and collaborative learning environment. This principle emphasizes seeking mutually beneficial solutions and outcomes in all interactions, ensuring that everyone involved feels valued and respected.”\n\nBrown also cites “”Put First Things First,” from Steven Covey’s “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,” as holding particular relevance for him as a school leader. He adds that it “provides a framework for school administrators to navigate their multifaceted roles with clarity and purpose. By prioritizing tasks based on their alignment with the school’s mission and values, delegating responsibilities effectively, and maintaining a focus on long-term goals, administrators can lead their schools towards greater success and fulfillment.”\n\nA member of the South Colonie Athletic Hall of Fame (class of 2023), Brown’s leadership skills have been evident in his years as a player and a coach. He was drafted by the New York Mets and played for their organization for two years. Transitioning to coaching, Brown led the Oswego State baseball team to the D3 College Baseball World Series twice.\n\nJohn Swick, Town of Webb UFSD principal, says that “Kyle has done an outstanding job as a new assistant principal in a small, rural, PK-12 district.” As the athletic director, Brown “has helped implement the new branding of our district as we changed our mascot this year.” Speaking to Brown’s leadership qualities, Swick adds that Brown “has taken on the role of special education director in addition to assistant principal and athletic director.”\n\nBrown received his bachelor of arts from LeMoyne College, his master of science from SUNY Oswego, and a certificate of advanced studies from the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts.\n\nBrown and fellow 2024 award winners will be recognized at SAANYS’ annual awards celebration, taking place on May 3 at the Saratoga Hilton in Saratoga Springs, New York.\n\nSAANYS represents nearly 22,000 school administrators, supervisors, and retirees.

The award recognizes a SAANYS member who has demonstrated exceptional, creative leadership in harnessing the potential of technology to further teaching and student achievement.\n\nTimothy recently led a transformative project aimed at modernizing decades-old technology in over 1700 PK-12 classrooms within the district. This comprehensive initiative was designed to equip students with cutting-edge classroom technology. This included the installation of modern SMARTBoards mounted on height-adjustable mounts, advanced document cameras, and ScreenBeams for wireless casting. Despite the immense scale of this project, Timothy was able to lead it to completion ahead of schedule and within budget constraints. He has also played a pivotal role in leading a district-wide transition to ensure all 23,000+ students have access to devices and internet connectivity.\n\nEmphasizing that a fundamental best practice in instructional technology is to start with clear learning objectives, Timothy says that specific learning goals and outcomes must be established before selecting and implementing technology tools. He adds that “educators should identify the need or driving force behind the selection of technology. This approach ensures that technology is used purposefully to enhance teaching and learning experiences, rather than for its own sake.”\n\nAmong his best practices, Timothy also says that “authenticity should be a cornerstone in our instructional design practices. Authentic learning involves crafting educational experiences that closely resemble real-world contexts, tasks, and challenges. By integrating instructional technology, educators can create captivating learning opportunities that foster deeper understanding and engagement among students.”\n\nDr. Steven Denaker, Director of Learning Management Systems, notes that, “Timothy Johnsen’s exceptional leadership, spanning sixteen years in the Rochester City School District, and his pivotal role in expanding the Virtual Academy of Rochester, coupled with his successful management of a 1 :1 Chromebook initiative for all students during the COVID-19 crisis, make him an outstanding recipient for the SAANYS Leader in Digital Education Award.”\n\nThe district’s Chief Technology Officer, Glen VanDerwater, says, “Tim holds a firm belief that technology is a tool that provides both students and staff the unique modality to connect with one another and the ability to deliver engaging instruction.” VanDerwater adds that, “Tim has implemented mission-critical systems that have proven to enhance Rochester’s graduation rate through our Virtual Academy of Rochester and student engagement using the Google suite along with other instructional software applications.”\n\nJennifer Coon, instructional technology teacher, says that “Mr. Johnsen’s propensity for innovative thinking and his unwavering dedication to advancing student and educator achievements, in conjunction with his profound commitment to his vocation and colleagues, are qualities that resonate deeply with all who have had the privilege of working alongside him.”\n\nTimothy has received the HEART Award from the HEART Coalition for a Drug-Free Rochester and the Association of Supervisors & Administrators of Rochester (ASAR) Hero Award. He has been a VITAL Educator Program Participant-NYSED since 2023.\n\nTimothy has been with the Rochester City School District since 2008. He was a science teacher and then a technology specialist for lntegrated Arts and Technology High School before moving to a position at central office. He has served as the district’s Director of Learning Management Systems since 2021 and presently serves as the Executive Director of Instructional Technology. He received his bachelor of arts degree from the State University of New York College at Geneseo, his master of science in Geoscience from Mississippi State University, and his master of science in Education Leadership from St. John Fisher University.\n\nTimothy and fellow 2024 award winners will be recognized at SAANYS’ annual awards celebration, taking place on May 3 at the Saratoga Hilton.\n\nSAANYS represents nearly 22,000 school administrators, supervisors, and retiree leaders.

SAANYS is affiliated with the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) and the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP).\n\nJohn Kolesar, assistant principal at North Rockland High School in the North Rockland Central School District, has been selected as the 2024 New York State Secondary School Assistant Principal of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given annually by SAANYS and the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) to a middle or high school assistant principal who has set the pace, character, and quality of education for the students in his or her school. Nominees are administrators who are committed to students, parents, and the community and have shown exceptional contributions to the educational process.\n\nTo meet all the challenges of the multi-faceted role of an assistant principal, Kolesar says he prioritizes several key strategies, including a student-centered culture, data-driven decision-making, inclusive practices, collaborative leadership, and parent and community engagement. His approach and dedication have earned him the respect of fellow administrators such as Dr. Michael Gill. “Mr. Kolesar’s leadership serves as a beacon for educational institutions aiming to create student-focused ecosystems that not only address diverse learning styles but also cultivate a culture of empathy and understanding,” reflected Gill.\n\nKolesar has also been praised by colleagues and teachers for “promoting positive behaviors and fostering a safe learning environment.” He has emphasized mindfulness, mental health, and open communication – helping to develop a school culture where students feel safe, secure, and ready to learn and thrive.\n\nCommented Rocky Adkins, a teacher at North Rockland High, “His leadership extends beyond traditional academics, incorporating valuable life lessons from programs like Rachel’s Challenge. Inspired by the tragic story of Rachel Scott, the program emphasizes kindness, empathy, and compassion, creating a culture of inclusivity and respect … Under his guidance, the school becomes a hub of not only academic excellence but also personal development, equipping learners with the skills and values necessary to thrive in an ever-evolving global landscape.”\n\nKolesar received his Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education from St. John’s University, his Masters of Science in Education from City College of New York, and his Certificate of Advanced Studies in Educational Administration from SUNY New Paltz.\n\nAs the New York State Secondary School Assistant Principal of the Year, Kolesar is now a candidate for the award of National Assistant Principal of the Year, an award sponsored by NASSP.\n\nRichard Keeler, principal at Central Valley Academy in the Central Valley Central School District, has been selected as the 2023 New York State Secondary School Principal of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given annually by SAANYS and the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) to a middle or high school principal who has set the pace, character, and quality of education for the students in his or her school. Nominees are administrators who are committed to students, parents, and the community and have shown exceptional contributions to the educational process.\n\nAmong his many accomplishments, Keeler has focused on fostering a supportive and empowering environment for all students, regardless of their future ambitions. In particular, he noticed the struggles that many freshmen experience during their transition to high school. Keeler established a Freshman Seminar program the purpose of which “is to help students develop a sense of belonging to the academic community and to foster the intellectual skills and self-confidence necessary for academic success through person relationships as well as self-actualization.” He also worked to increase course offerings that provided all students’ opportunities to take classes that were aligned with their future ambitions. Increasing AP and College Now offerings, adding a Health Science Pathway, a Navy National Defense Cadet Corps (NNDCC) program, as well as increasing opportunities for students to learn trades, are some of the ways CVA was able to accomplish this. Commented Aaron Carey, principal of Barringer Road Elementary, “Mr. Keeler is an outstanding leader who is highly respected within our school district and within the region. His dedication to the students, staff, and community are unparalleled.”\n\nStudent Emma Wheet, whose Advanced Placement Capstone project on therapy dogs was later implemented at the school, commented that, “Mr. Keeler helped me throughout my whole research project process for my AP Capstone project. He made my research paper become a reality that I never thought would take flight in our own district, but he supported me every step of the way.”\n\nCommented teacher Jonna Costin, “Mr. Keeler promotes equity in our building by modeling equity for his students. He gives our students a voice and will always listen to concerns and then try to find solutions.”\n\nAfter mourning the loss of two students to suicide in six years, Keeler realized he needed to place the mental health of students as a top priority at Central Valley Academy. He notes that “losing students to suicide makes you reevaluate and question everything you do as an administrator.” To that end, throughout the year, he has built in half days as mental health days and has worked to normalize conversations surrounding mental health. The school hosts an annual event in June known as the Mott Marathon where seniors raise money for a specific cause. In June 2022, the event was held in memory of the students lost to suicide and became a full-day event with over 25 different vendors providing mental health information to students, as well as a seminar by a teen mental health specialist. Parent Pattie Day commented, “While counselors were brought in, Mr. Keeler is the one who more students looked to for help, support, a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen, and a hug when needed, from someone they respect, who’s heart was broken along with theirs.”\n\nSuperintendent Jeremy Rich noted that “Mr. Keeler works hard to foster a family-oriented culture in his building that is built on trust, integrity, and honesty. The culture he has created is one that certainly fosters the emotional well-being of all involved.”\n\nKeeler received his Associate of Science from Herkimer County Community College, Bachelor of Science from Utica College of Syracuse University, and his Master of Science from the University at Albany.\n\nAs the NYS Secondary School Principal of the Year, Keeler is now a candidate for the award of National Principal of the Year, an award sponsored by NASSP.\n\nDr. Richard Mangeri, assistant principal at George W. Hewlett High School in the Hewlett-Woodmere Public Schools, has been selected as the 2023 New York State Secondary School Assistant Principal of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given annually by SAANYS and the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) to a middle or high school assistant principal who has set the pace, character, and quality of education for the students in his or her school. Nominees are administrators who are committed to students, parents, and the community and have shown exceptional contributions to the educational process.\n\nKnown as an administrator who works tirelessly to assure that all students feel comfortable and welcomed at G.W. Hewlett HS, Mangeri has implemented several initiatives to that end. He fosters safety at the school by offering assemblies on various topics such as the dangers of vaping and cyberbullying by the Nassau County Police Department; a scientific seminar by Dr. Stephen Dewey to educate the students and parents on the dangers of vaping; and a night program for 11th and 12th graders called Arrive Alive, highlighting the dangers of texting and drunk driving.\n\nMangeri prides himself on leading by example and will do whatever it takes for the school to run smoothly, whether it’s mopping the floors or covering a class. He empowers the staff and students by actively creating a culture of trust by encouraging open conversation and diversity of thought. He often asks students how they could have better handled certain situations with teachers or peers. He works with students to identify the pros and cons of their decisions, which allows them to make the best choices and develop problem-solving skills. Commented student, Nathaniel Redillo, “I always had support from Dr. Mangeri. He always ensured I felt safe and that I belonged. He was always there to provide guidance and insight.”\n\nHe also promotes equity within the school by offering professional development on the topic to teachers, including a faculty meeting to discuss conversations surrounding bias and supporting students, as well as bringing in an organization called Erase Racism to discuss bias and awareness. Discussions with students center around celebrating multicultural days to highlight and strengthen understanding of behaviors and values tied to cultures. The students organize multicultural music to be played during passing times once per week.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Mangeri has mentored several administrative candidates. The most important value he shared with his mentees was encouraging them to not be afraid to make mistakes and instead use mistakes as a learning opportunity. He also encourages the faculty to step out of their comfort zones and take a risk by trying something new in their classrooms. Commented teacher, Jared Pittelli, “Dr. Mangeri always supports his teachers and students alike to work to create an open dialogue where all parties feel respected and that they have a voice.” Bob Machado, department chairperson of business education, added, ” Dr. Mangeri has been a mentor and a colleague. He is easy to approach and his “big picture” view of education can help someone in any situation.”\n\nFormer principal of G.W. Hewlett HS, Dr. Theodore Fulton, commented that “Dr. Mangeri always makes the time to work with staff and students to identify areas of improvement within the school and empower stakeholders to actively partake in the decision-making process.”\n\nMangeri received his Bachelor of Arts, Master of Science, and Doctor of Education degrees from St. John’s University, and his Advanced Certification in Education Administration from The College of St. Rose.\n\nAs the NYS Secondary School Assistant Principal of the Year, Mangeri is now a candidate for the award of National Assistant Principal of the Year, an award sponsored by NASSP.\n\nMatthew Younghans, principal at Little Tor Elementary School in the Clarkstown Central School District, has been selected as the 2023 New York State Elementary Principal of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS) and the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP). This award is given annually to a member of SAANYS and NAESP who is clearly committed to excellence, has programs designed to meet the academic and social needs of all students, and has firm ties to parents and the community.\n\nTogether with the PTA, Younghans spearheaded the development and implementation of many STEAM programs including a STEAM lab called the “Innovation Lab” at Little Tor Elementary School. The lab now provides a space for students to explore, develop, cultivate, and grow their 21st century learning skills. The lab is well known around the school as a fun, creative space where the students feel comfortable making choices and taking risks through learning by doing. As a result, the students have showcased their new skills and projects by participating in the Clarkstown Schools Tech Showcase, STEM Day, Hour of Code, and Computer Science Education Week. Parent and PTA President Rebecca Coatti commented, “A parent once recommended creating an Innovation Lab for STEAM activities. Dr. Younghans worked hand-in-hand with the PTA to make this happen quickly. It was our honor to present him with the National PTA Life Achievement award for his dedication.”\n\nTeacher Jessica Kempkes notes that “he embraces innovation in every aspect of education. He leads us with support by always reassuring us that he will help us navigate any situation together.”\n\nBelieving that the goal of education is to develop the social-emotional well-being of students as well as developing students who are both educated and confident their abilities, Younghans successfully shifted Little Tor ES to a restorative practice model for discipline, rather than the traditional tiered approach. This approach focuses on assessing the social, emotional, and mental well-being of each individual student. As such, Younghans notes that, “this has created a culture of positivity and caring within the school building and an environment where students are known, accepted, and cared for deeply as individuals.”\n\nNoted Assistant Superintendent for Personnel and Instruction Jeff Sobel, “On a day-to-day basis, Dr. Younghans utilizes excellent leadership skills, including communication, organization, and a positive manner to ensure that children are provided a caring, nurturing experience. Parents have expressed appreciation for his handling of difficult, sensitive matters.”\n\nCommented Principal of West Nyack Elementary School Annie Streiff, “Matt has distinguished himself (for many years!) as a natural leader. He is a tremendous resource not only for his school community, but also for his district and colleagues. With a singular vision toward student success, Matt’s innovative leadership sets a very high bar for the rest of us. He leads with wisdom, practicality, a very healthy sense of humor, and most importantly, with a profound respect for each student.”\n\nSuperintendent Marc Baiocco commented, “I am impressed with Dr. Younghans’ leadership skills and the way in which he manages his building. I enjoy conversing with him and believe his problem-solving skills result in positive outcomes, in part due to his calm, poised, and confident demeanor.”\n\nYounghans received his Bachelor of Science in Education from the University of Hartford, Master of Science in Literacy from the College of New Rochelle, his Certificate of Advanced Study in School Leadership from SUNY New Paltz, and his Doctor of Education in K-12 Administration from Seton Hall University.\n\nEach year, NAESP convenes the State Elementary Principals of the Year in Washington, D.C. to be honored as NAESP National Distinguished Principals®.

McGuire was also a presenter at the 2021 SAANYS Annual Conference as well as the 2022 NAESP Conference, speaking on leading her school back from the COVID-19 pandemic. Commented former colleague Stephanie Rosman, “Ms. McGuire is a dedicated leader who actively participates within many different educational communities. She truly is a special person that I feel always goes above and beyond on city, state, and national levels. This is evident as she leads professional development, champions for funding and resources, and demonstrates tireless activism in the field of education.”\n\nBelieving that everyone at PS/IS 18 – The Park School should have a voice, McGuire has promoted a culture that encourages a collaborative model with administration, staff, and students, as well as partnerships with families – always striving to foster positive relationships. The students are encouraged to be kind and the school holds special days to show appreciation with activities designed to build character. Many guests have also been invited to the school as a way for the students to meet local role models, members of the community, and create opportunities for them to interact. McGuire notes that, “While it is important that educational leaders provide a strong academic foundation for students, it is equally important to provide the resources and tools for children to grow up to be able to be resourceful, caring, and responsible citizens. We need to remember that we are shaping our future community and we need to teach and model for students how to collaborate, be thoughtful, and that everyone has something to offer society.”\n\nAssistant Principal Patricia Gil commented, “Donna McGuire has a can-do attitude, serves with humility and grace, looks out for others, and wants to help. Donna is a true role model for everyone around her. She has been a trailblazer and a mentor to other assistant principals and staff. She knows how to connect people in-person and via technology and is happy to help other educators do the same.”\n\nCommented NYCDOE Community Superintendent Manuel Ramirez, “Ms. McGuire is a passionate educator who thrives on being a change-agent. Ms. McGuire always works with the highest level of professionalism, and has consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic, is a valued team player, an excellent communicator and listener, and is a creative problem solver.”\n\nMcGuire received her Bachelor of Science from SUNY Oneonta, Master of Science in Education from Fordham University, Master of Science in Education from Baruch College, and has completed coursework in doctoral studies at Fordham University.\n\nEach year, NAESP convenes the State Elementary Principals of the Year in Washington, D.C. to be honored as NAESP National Distinguished Principals®.

The SAANYS Leadership and Support Award was established to recognize the outstanding leadership efforts of those members whose responsibilities require leadership through support services to educators and students across and between school buildings and districts.\n\nPrior to transitioning to his current role in the central office, Svendsen served as principal of the Garden City Park School. He notes that “being a principal for 15 years has been one of my most significant accomplishments. ln a K-6 school, it is amazing to watch kindergartners grow into young people when they leave at the end of 6th grade. I feel like the impact of our K-6 time with students on student learning and development is important for their entire life.”\n\nSvendsen then took on the role of director of curriculum, instruction & technology, which then became his current position of director of curriculum and instruction. At around the same time that he moved into his new position, he says there were “four brand new principals opening up our four buildings.” Svendsen notes that he considers “working with and mentoring these new administrators as another accomplishment in my career.”\n\nIn addition, Svendsen’s leadership and support accomplishments have included co-authoring the Annual Professional Performance Review Plan, implementing a Fact Fluency Plan using FASTT Math and Fraction Nation for grades 2-6, and implementing a writing workshop for K-6 to support Common Core Learning Standards.

Mr. Svendsen worked with central office and building administrators to prepare for a safe school opening amidst COVID regulations.” She adds that he is “an educational leader who promotes the success of every student by acting with integrity, fairness, and in an ethical manner.”\n\nFabayo Mclntosh, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction for Valley Stream UFSD 13, says that Svendsen’s “skill set is impressive. Not many people are successful at both district and building leadership. The impact that his work, both directly and indirectly, will have and has had on the lives of young people is inspiring.” In addition, McIntosh says, Svendsen “has a wealth of knowledge and is always willing to share resources. I am a better leader because he is my mentor.”\n\nKim LaRegina, New Hyde Park Road School principal, says Svendsen’s “leadership and mentorship of new teachers and administrators have been a tremendous asset to the staff and community in the New Hyde Park-Garden City Park School District.” She adds that his “forward thinking has truly changed the landscape of the curriculum and instruction in the district.”\n\nSvendsen has been with the New Hyde Park-Garden City Park School District for 22 years and has been active in education in the state of New York since 1989. He received his bachelor of arts, master of science, and an advanced certificate in School Administration and Supervision from Brooklyn College.\n\nLaurie Guyon, coordinator for model schools for the Washington-Saratoga-Warren-Hamilton-Essex (WSWHE) BOCES, has been selected as the recipient of the 2023 Leader in Digital Education Award by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award recognizes a SAANYS member who has demonstrated exceptional, creative leadership in harnessing the potential of technology to further teaching and student achievement.\n\nIn addition to her work with the WSWHE BOCES, Guyon is a statewide trainer and Capital Region director for the New York State Association for Computers and Technologies in Education (NYSCATE) and an adjunct instructor at SUNY Plattsburgh. Since March 2020, Guyon has “hosted over 400 webinars and workshops to support educators in our region with BOCES and statewide with NYSCATE.”\n\nShe notes that she has “trained over 100 educators working towards their Google and ISTE certifications.” She has “created 14 self-paced courses for NYSCATE on the Computer Science and Digital Fluency (CS/DF) standards, tech tools, coding, and SEL in 2020, and just created another 10 on implementing the CS/DF standards and on improving student motivation.” In addition, she has spoken at conferences “about supporting how computer science and digital fluency can look in our classrooms.”\n\nGuyon’s expertise and ability to lead others has also resulted in her writing and publishing a book on technology integration, SMILE Learning: Leveraging the Power of Educational Technology, published in March 2023. She cites “Building Computational Thinking Practices into Instruction” and “Global Collaboration” as best practices that will help support student learning, particularly in the areas of cyberbullying, being safe online, ethical hacking, and being kind online, and to help students become better global citizens.\n\nDavid R. Ashdown, director of technology and instructional support programs, WSWHE BOCES, says “There are really too many qualifications to list for Laurie Guyon, who has become a household name in the area of digital leadership in our state.”\n\n“Laurie is our north star for the region with instructional technologies,” says Christine MacPherson, K-12 director of educational technology for Hudson Falls CSD. “She has elevated the conversations and implementation of #TechforGood for administrators, teachers, but most of all students!”\n\nGuyon received an award for Best Overall Implementation of Technology from Tech and Learning-New England in 2022, the Global Impactor Award from the Digital Citizenship Institute in 2022, the President’s Volunteer Service Award from ISTE in 2020 and 2021, and the Emerging EdTech Leader award from CoSN in 2020. She was also the BOCES Spotlight Award Winner in 2020 and an NYSCATE Volunteer Hall of Fame Inductee in 2017.\n\nGuyon has been with the WSWHE BOCES since 2018. She taught 6th grade at Schuylerville Middle School from 2008 to 2016 and was the tech integrator for Schuylerville CSD from 2016 to 2018. She received her bachelor of science, master of science, CAS-SBL, and CAS-SDL from SUNY Plattsburgh.\n\nJames Cameron, principal at Commack Road Elementary School in the Islip Union Free School District, has been selected for the 2023 Outstanding Educator Award by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given annually to a SAANYS member who has made outstanding contributions in New York State schools through public education, professional organizations, or research and/or writing in the field of education.\n\nCameron says he believes that everyone plays a role in educating students. “No role or person is superior to another. The students, parents, teachers, paraprofessionals, clerical, custodians, maintenance, food service workers, computer technicians, bus drivers, crossing guards, and administrators, must work together to create a synergistic atmosphere and environment that benefits all students and families!”\n\nIdentifying one of his best practices as addressing hierarchal cultures head on, Cameron adds that “ln order for success to be possible, we must all show up, stand up, and speak up if we want to stand out as a community. By being your best self and treating others as you would like to be treated, you will be a role model, set an example, be there for each other, and hold each other accountable to create the best environment for all!”\n\nCameron serves on the SAANYS Board of Directors, as advocacy chair for the Suffolk County Elementary Principals’ Association, as an officer of the lslip Association of School Administrators, and as a SAANYS representative on the NYSED Digital Learning Advisory Council.\n\n“Mr. Cameron is kind, caring, funny and helpful, and these are just a few of the millions of words that describe Mr. Cameron.” says Elizabeth Balsamo, a former student. She adds that “Mr. Cameron makes Commack Road Elementary a home.”\n\nLaura Rogacki, BOE Trustee, cites Cameron’s work in developing “programs and support systems to meet the diverse learning needs of all students at CRES.” She notes that she is “continually impressed by his broad knowledge and his ability to predict and respond to the needs of CRES families and students.” In a culturally diverse building, Cameron “has created an environment of understanding and inclusivity, making students, parents, and staff alike welcomed and part of the CRES Community.”\n\nCurtis Juengerkes, Islip Middle School assistant principal, says that Cameron “exudes leadership.” He adds that Cameron “has established district practice in support of the Islip children and families. Mr. Cameron, every day and always, can be observed supporting and serving the children and families who attend his building. He is a gifted and talented leader, which the district of lslip enjoys on a daily basis.”\n\n“Of the many educators who I have worked with across multiple districts and within leadership organizations,” Edward Kemnitzer, assistant superintendent for instruction and personnel for the East Williston Union Free School District, says, “James Cameron stands out with his transparent and collective leadership that continues to inspire teachers, students, parents, colleagues, and members of his professional learning network.”\n\nCameron began his career in education as a teaching assistant in 2003. He has served as principal of Commack Road Elementary School in Islip since 2017. He received his bachelor of science from Five Towns College, his master of science from the College of Mt Vincent, and a Post Master Advanced Certificate from Queens College.\n\nPierre A. Lehmuller, New York City Elementary School Principals Association (NYCESPA) executive director emeritus, has been selected as the recipient of the 2023 Irving Schwartz Distinguished Retiree Award by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given annually to a retired education leader who, in retirement, has made significant contributions to the welfare of associations, education, and the greater community.\n\nLehmuller has been active in education in the state of New York since 1957. He began his career as a social studies teacher and retired as a successful elementary school principal. Since retiring, he has served the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators (CSA) as conference chair and with NYCESPA as executive director. He transitioned to his current role as executive director emeritus in 2023.\n\nRestructuring the CSA conference to “highlight its purpose as a day of professional learning, networking, and celebration of the union identity of CSA’s members” is one of his greatest accomplishments, Lehmuller notes. The recent conference was host to 1,500 attendees.\n\nHe also cites the work he has done for NYCESPA, particularly “supporting the work of eleven presidents of the New York City Elementary School Principals Association, so that the organization and its members were seen as advocates and mentors at the local, state, and national levels.” Lehmuller adds that the “building of relationships among NYCESPA, SAANYS, and the NAESP is something of which I am particularly proud.”\n\nMark Brodsky, director of the Retiree Chapter, Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, says of Lehmuller’s work that he “has nurtured school leaders past and present and carried the banner of teaching and learning his entire career – on city, state, and federal levels.” Brodsky emphasizes that Lehmuller is “second to none in his commitment to the education of the students and teachers in New York.”\n\nSusan Rippe Hofmann, who succeeds Lehmuller as NYCESPA executive director, says that “There are so many whose impact has been shaped by Pierre’s knowledge, counsel, and example. I count myself as one of this large and lucky group.” She adds that “I can think of no other ‘retired educator’ who has been of greater service to other school leaders than Pierre Lehmuller.”\n\nDr. Liza Caraballo-Suarez, Principal PS120k and president-elect, National Association of Elementary School Principals, says that “Mr. Lehmuller is an exemplary educator and role model who has dedicated his entire career advocating to improve education throughout his career as well as in his retirement.” She adds that “As a champion of children he continues to fight for equity in schools across the nation and exemplifies the best of the best within education.”\n\nLehmuller received his bachelor of science degree and his master of science degree, and pursued post-graduate work at Fordham University.\n\nHappy Birthday Cha Cha Cha (HBCCC) in Pittsford, represented by Carrie Green, founder president, has been selected as the recipient of the 2023 Friend of Education Award by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given to an individual, group, or organization that has consistently contributed to the support and advancement of outstanding public education and the students of New York State.\n\nGreen feels passionately that “birthdays should be a chance for each child to feel especially loved and celebrated. But unfortunately, many children don’t experience anything special on their day.” And that’s where Happy Birthday Cha Cha Cha steps in. The idea was developed in January 2017, while Green was shopping for holiday clearance toys with the intention of donating them the following season, but wished there was an easier way to get them to the children sooner. Within a few weeks the program was up and running out of Green’s basement. Commented Monroe 2-Orleans BOCES Administrator Gary Manuse, “Carrie has an extraordinary heart and is a true example of what it means to give unconditionally and portray remarkable volunteer efforts on behalf of education.”\n\nHBCC works closely with the Rochester, Rome, and Buffalo city school districts to adopt classrooms where 90 percent of the students are living at or below the poverty line. The goal is that every single child in each classroom feels noticed and cared about on their birthday. In its first school year, HBCCC brought birthday joy to seven Rochester City School District classrooms and 129 children. In 2018, the number rose to 422 children, and in 2021 they celebrated 1,304 children in Rochester, 130 children in Rome, and opened their third chapter in Buffalo, providing for 75 children.\n\nJanivette Torres, special education teacher at Pinnacle School #35, noted, “As a teacher who has collaborated with Carrie for the last five years, I have personally seen her care and compassion firsthand. The students truly light up when receiving the beautiful gifts that Carrie prepares with her team.”\n\nCorey Hepburn, principal of Clara Barton School No. 02 in Rochester, commented, “Happy Birthday Cha Cha Cha, Inc. is more than an agency that celebrates birthdays and provides gifts for students. It connects people to people through an intentional and precise process that delivers hope for all.”\n\nPrincipal of RISE Community School #106 in Rochester, Kelly Lampman continued, “Seeing those green bags carried out to the bus loop by a student with a grin from ear to ear is remarkable. All students know what that green bag means and who it is from. Other students are now wishing that child a happy birthday! Again, allowing for that child to be special! The amount they have given to the RISE family is more than I could have ever hoped for.”\n\nMark Erlenwein, principal at Staten Island Technical High School, has been selected as the New York State Secondary School Principal of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given annually to recognize an outstanding principal who has succeeded in providing high-quality learning opportunities for students as well as demonstrating exemplary contributions to the profession.\n\nErlenwein will also represent New York State as the NASSP NYS Principal of the Year as sponsored by SAANYS’ national affiliate, the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP). NASSP will select a National Principal of the Year from all the state finalists.\n\nErlenwein has instilled a culture among the Staten Island Technical High School (SITHS) community that fosters the development of kind, intellectual, and creative lifelong learners. The school’s collective spirit enables their scholars to come together as passionate, talented, multi-skilled, and resilient global citizens supported through rigorous academics, balanced with mental and physical health and wellness practices, grounded in a desire and love for learning.\n\nThe SITHS approach cultivates curiosity, capacity, the courage to try, and the validation of “failure.” At SITHS, student efforts are applauded as they FAIL (First-Attempt-In-Learning), SAIL (Second-Attempt-in-Learning) and TAIL (Third-Attempt-in-Learning) success. Students are nurtured towards a gracious knowledge that learning and true development comes from the journey, which was, in fact, always the goal. This approach, says Erlenwein, is critical to prepare students for the challenges of the real world.\n\nSITHS Teacher and WBL Coordinator Jennifer Fitzpatrick commented, “Mr. Erlenwein empowers members of the SITHS community with leadership opportunities that support their learning, growing, and thriving. Mr. Erlenwein often reflects on our school’s collective work, experience, and journey, speaking openly and honestly about his approach, and gives all members the opportunity to share their assessments/feedback and impact future decisions.”\n\nSchool Administrator Joseph Manzo notes that “The SITHS community is led by a principal who is the embodiment of a great leader, who puts the well-being of the people in our SITHS community at the forefront of all decisions. He is a principal who remembers that there is more to education than just grades. Our school’s culture/tone is reflective of Mr. Erlenwein’s amazing spirit.” Manzo adds that “Respect, empathy, character, service, practice, fun are centerpieces for Mark’s recipe for successful learning. He has become a ‘go-to’ resource for our community partners, other schools in our District, and across New York City.”\n\nErlenwein has been the principal at Staten Island Technical High School for the past 9 years and has been in school administration for a total of 16 years. He received his bachelor’s and master’s degree in English Rhetoric from CUNY-The College of Staten Island and his Administrator’s Certificate from the College of St. Rose.\n\nDiane Fox, assistant principal at Hampton Bays Middle School in the Hampton Bays Union Free School District, has been selected as the 2022 New York State Secondary School Assistant Principal of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given annually by SAANYS and the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) to a middle or high school assistant principal who has set the pace, character, and quality of education for the students in his or her school. Nominees are administrators who are committed to students, parents, and the community and have shown exceptional contributions to the educational process.\n\nKnown as an administrator who works tirelessly to assure that all students feel comfortable and welcomed at Hampton Bays Middle School, Fox has implemented several initiatives to that end. The school has a 26% English language learner population and as a bilingual administrator, Fox takes pride in the responsibility of reaching out and communicating with the Latino families within the district. She notes that “Each new parent that I meet with will hear the same message from me, ‘I am here for you and your family. I will always be here to help you with whatever your child needs.’ Students especially know that I will drop whatever I am working on if a student needs to see me.” One of her welcoming initiatives is the “It Starts With Hello” program developed at Sandy Hook to combat bullying and school shootings. Parent Debra Williams commented, “She used it to welcome students back after the summer to begin on a positive note and even arranged for some students to stand at the entrance smiling and waving, greeting their classmates. It was beautiful; and when I told her how glad I was that the program was being introduced, she said, ‘We hope to work with our kids so that they always feel connected to the school and greater community. It’s so important that they know that each of them matters and are cared about.'” Another initiative is the creation of a student council supported by the NASSP Raising Student Voice & Participation (RSVP) program. Its goal is to design a student council that is focused on student voice and doesn’t limit participation to the few students who may not represent all of the student body.\n\nCommented Principal Dennis Schug, Jr., “As a Spanish-speaking school leader, she plays a vital role in sustaining a positive school-home partnership, working in close coordination with parents who are English-speaking, Spanish-speaking, and bilingual. Mrs. Fox models what relationships-matter leadership looks, sounds, and feels like, for students, families, and staff alike.”\n\nFox has also led several new initiatives that focus on 21st century learning. This past school year, Hampton Bays Public Schools was selected as a Lighthouse District by Stony Brook University for implementing a news literacy curriculum. Under Fox’s leadership, her school has also incorporated the Amazon Future Engineers Program to revamp its STEM curriculum. Commented teacher Scott Garofola, “Mrs. Fox embodies the idea that leaders don’t create followers, they create more leaders. She has been a constant supporter of those looking to try new ideas and initiatives, and in turn become leaders themselves.”\n\nCommented Superintendent of Schools Lars Clemensen, “The Hampton Bays Public Schools is so proud of our own Mrs. Diane Fox as the New York State Assistant Principal of the Year. As an educational leader, she prioritizes building positive relationships with students and families and supporting teachers in the hard work of reaching and teaching every one of our students. In Hampton Bays, we recognize real impact as being #HBStrong. Mrs. Fox is #HBStrong and we congratulate her on this tremendous honor.”\n\nFox received her BA in History from St. Joseph’s College and her MA in Public Policy and Advanced Graduate Certificate in School District and Building Leadership from Stony Brook University.\n\nAs the NYS Secondary School Assistant Principal of the Year, Fox is now a candidate for the award of National Assistant Principal of the Year, an award sponsored by NASSP.\n\nDavid Wright, assistant principal at Cornwall Central Middle School in the Cornwall Central School District, has been selected as the SAANYS and NAESP New York State Assistant Principal of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given annually to a member of SAANYS and NAESP (National Association of Elementary School Principals), promoting educational excellence for pre-kindergarten through eighth grade (PreK-8) schooling and calling attention to the fundamental importance of the assistant principal.\n\nAmong Wright’s many notable accomplishments has been the establishment of Google University for his staff. The district has a goal of being 1:1 with technology by the end of 2022, which means that every student will have their own computer. Wright realized that many of his staff members were not comfortable using the Google platform and that the school needed a long-term goal to help everyone grow as they moved toward that goal.\n\nWright established Google University, relying on his own expertise as a Google Level 1 and Level 2 certified teacher, as a way to help his staff grow. The course syllabus for each level of learning outlined what would be taught so teachers could participate in the appropriate level for what they needed. Those teachers who mastered the highest level then became “professors” and taught the course to others. Wright notes that through this process of professional development, the district will be a 1:1 district by the end of the school year and the teachers at Cornwall Central Middle School will all be prepared for the initiative.\n\nDuring the early months of the pandemic, when many schools were concerned about starting the year on time, Wright says he “looked at this as the greatest opportunity and challenge I may ever get to face in my career, with a goal of not only making sure my school opened on time but helping to make sure that a schedule would not impact any school in our district.” To prepare for the August 2020 opening, and to ensure that all students would remain safe and socially distant, Wright input all the student information into an Excel spreadsheet and laid out plans for students to remain six feet apart and to open on time in a safe environment.\n\nAssistant Principal Maria Azzone notes that under Wright’s leadership, “our school has become transformative. He is a learner alongside his staff, always providing feedback and support. He is passionate about teaching and learning and shows great commitment towards all students’ success. He is regularly visible to the entire school community and actively listens and communicates effectively. Overall, Mr. Wright’s exceptional leadership qualities and abilities have helped foster a positive and motivating school culture.”\n\nCornwall Central Middle School Principal Kathryn Polumbo says that Wright’s daily focus “is on our students and learning. He is approachable, friendly, bright, caring, and empathetic. His main goal, every day, is to make sure our students have the best possible learning environment and school experience. He uses every opportunity to learn about each one of our 1000 students.”\n\nWright received his Master of Science in Education Educational Leadership and his Master of Science in Teacher, Adolescent Education, from St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill, New York, and his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Western New England University in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nNicole Ey, principal at Ellenville Elementary School in the Ellenville Central School District, has been selected as the 2022 New York State Elementary Principal of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS) and the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP). This award is given annually to a member of SAANYS and NAESP who is clearly committed to excellence, has programs designed to meet the academic and social needs of all students, and has firm ties to parents and the community.\n\nEy has made mental health a priority in her school. To meet her students’ health and educational needs, she established a CORE team consisting of a behavior analyst, two school psychologists, two social workers, two guidance counselors, and building administrators. The team’s daily task is to make sure students’ basic needs are met, particularly access to food and social and emotional support, which are key for their health, education, and well-being. She and her team are all on call to compassionately address student social and emotional learning and discipline.\n\nLeaning on the collective wisdom of her staff, Ey worked to make the district’s response plan to the pandemic organized and understandable. Communication was already strong within the school and with students and parents. With the onset of the pandemic, the team moved to daily communications with every family to deal with the tension and alarm. Ey says her goal was to strengthen relationships with families so they would feel safe and engaged as everyone reshaped education in a digital mode.\n\nEy empowers her teachers and strives for a strong sense of community and resilience, which has been especially important throughout the past two years. As a result of her work, Ellenville Elementary was the first school in the district to open for in-person learning.\n\nA new literacy program, a curriculum review process for math, and professional development for teachers in technology are all accomplishments benefited by staff and students at Ellenville Elementary under Ey’s leadership. She has also implemented a shift to small group, personalized learning that has been critical in addressing academic needs resulting from instructional challenges during the pandemic.\n\nJessica Mataraza, director of special education for the Ellenville Central School District, says Ey “goes above and beyond on a daily basis to ensure that the needs of each individual student in her building are taken into consideration. She works diligently, long after the school day has come to a close, to plan, reflect, and prepare for whatever may be ahead.” Mataraza adds that Ey’s “ continuous generosity, through ongoing displays, emails, weekly newsletters, and more, demonstrates her appreciation for the school community well beyond anything I have ever experienced before.”\n\nMeredith Smith, Ellenville Elementary School’s Assistant Principal, refers to Ey as “principal extraordinaire.” Smith says that Ey “leads by example, exuding passion for excellence and learning, creativity that sparks imaginations, our very own cheerleader who always lifts us up.” Smith adds, “Mrs. Ey’s tireless energy and abiding dedication to everyone at Ellenville Elementary is the driving force of our lifeblood here and has deeply impacted staff, students, and families.”\n\nEy received an Advanced Certificate from LIU Post in Middletown, NY, her master of science in education from Mount Saint Mary College in Newburgh, NY, and her bachelor of science in education from Oswego State in Oswego, NY.\n\nSarah Trunfio, Supervisor of lnstructional Support Services & Mentoring for the Herkimer-Fulton-Hamilton-Otsego BOCES, has been selected as the 2022 recipient of the Leadership and Support Award by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). The SAANYS Leadership and Support Award was established to recognize the outstanding leadership efforts of those members whose responsibilities require leadership through support services to educators and students across and between school buildings and districts.\n\nTrunfio has been instrumental in impacting teacher retention, student literacy rates, and helping staff build better relationships with students while addressing social, emotional, and mental health. She created a BOCES-specific mentoring induction model, developed from research and best practices in mentoring, that has had a positive impact on teacher retention. The three-year induction model places an emphasis on teaching best practices and social and emotional learning wellness.\n\nTrunfio is also facilitating a culture and climate K-12 district-wide initiative developed from needs-based planning sessions with district leadership. Staff and leadership, including the district’s superintendent, are involved in this initiative. The professional development content is grounded in the work of Brené Brown and her book Daring Leadership.\n\nThe Science of Reading is another of Trunfio’s significant initiatives in the district. The program involves training on foundations and research behind teaching students to read. Her team is also working with the alternative high school to discover the root causes of reading barriers and to implement a Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) model to resolve them.\n\nRene M. Wilson, Ph.D., director of special education and elementary principal with Richfield Springs CSD, comments that “Sarah is a wealth of knowledge on so many topics pertinent to educational leadership, student learning, the art and science of teaching, and social-emotional learning. She always shows up as a student, teacher, or leader as her authentic self. She creates safe learning spaces where I can actually attach to the joy and struggle and messiness of growth because she is always professional, always kind, always empathetic, and brilliant.”\n\nDr. Wilson adds that “My school improvement plan has her mark all over it, and she is a steady presence in my building monthly, if not more. We engage in exploratory dialogue and she is a resource I always turn to, and if she doesn’t have the answer she researches and helps with solution-focused planning.”\n\nTrunfio has been with Herkimer-Fulton-Hamilton-Otsego BOCES for nine years and has worked as a special education teacher as well as a mentoring coordinator there. She received her School Building Leader (SBL) and School District Leader (SDL) certifications from Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, her master’s from SUNY Cortland, and her bachelor’s from Illinois College.\n\nGary Lambert, Director of 21st Century Learning for the Beekmantown Central School District, has been selected as the recipient of the 2022 Leader in Digital Education Award by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award recognizes a SAANYS member who has demonstrated exceptional, creative leadership in harnessing the potential of technology to further teaching and student achievement.\n\nLambert has not only been instrumental in moving the district forward in digital technology but has also had a significant impact on other districts across the state and across the country. He says that “being able to serve as a resource for others confirms my long-held belief that a rising tide lifts all ships.” He adds that he decided “that it was not enough to just put BCSD on the map, but also I wanted BCSD to become the map for others.”\n\nThe technology team, under Lambert’s direction, supports 2,400 users including students, faculty, staff, and administrators. Their work supports over 2,500 computers and mobile devices including Windows desktops and laptops, Chromebooks, and Chromebits.\n\nBeekmantown Central School District Superintendent of School Daniel Mannix reflects that “Mr. Lambert has been there every step of the way for Beekmantown CSD’s transformation from digital scavenger to a truly outstanding leader in 21st Century Teaching and Learning. Our innovative digital practices are second to none in large part (due) to the work and leadership of Director Lambert.”\n\nMannix adds that Lambert ensures “that our administrative team leads by example. He trains and demonstrates how new administrators will use the same digital tools we expect our teachers and students to use. This alignment is critical in communicating to others how much we value this continuity in digital programming.”\n\nChamplain Valley Educational Services Assistant Superintendent for Educational Services Amy Campbell notes that Lambert “truly exemplifies the characteristics of the SAANYS Leader in Digital Education Award.” She says, “While Gary has been instrumental in moving staff and students forward in digital education, his greatest contribution has been his willingness to share the lessons learned on the journey with other educators. From the beginning, Gary has spent countless hours sharing what he knows with educators from around the state, the country and even globally.”\n\nOf Lambert’s work beyond the district, Campbell says, “Gary has presented at national conferences, including the Future Educators of Technology Conference, to support schools in developing a student run help desk. This part of digital education provides students with real life work experience while supporting the use of devices in classrooms. It is this willingness to share what he has learned with others in the field that truly makes Gary deserving of an award targeted for leaders in digital education.”\n\nWillsboro Central School District Superintendent of Schools Justin Gardner comments, “I consider Mr. Lambert an expert both locally and nationally in the field of instructional technology integration and digital leadership. He has presented at national conferences on the initiatives he has so successfully implemented for the students and staff of his district. He also plans and develops high quality professional development activities through a variety of methods to ensure that his staff are well prepared for the needs of students in a 21st Century classroom.”\n\nLambert has been with the Beekmantown Central School District for 29 years. He received his master’s and his bachelor’s from Union College, Schenectady, NY.\n\nRae Lynn Helman, director of pupil personnel Services at Letchworth Central School, has been selected for the 2022 Outstanding Educator Award by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given annually to a SAANYS member who has made outstanding contributions in New York State schools through public education, professional organizations, or research and/or writing in the field of education.\n\nHelman notes that one of her most significant accomplishments has been watching students whom “others may have doubted, walk across the stage to receive a diploma.” She has worked with both general teachers and special educators on professional development and creative thinking that has increased their ability to support each student. Her efforts have resulted in an increased graduation rate for students with disabilities.\n\nThe parent of an autistic child herself, Helman says that, as an educator, “It is imperative to build trusting relationships with all parents and guardians to ensure that we are working together to meet the often complex needs of children with disabilities. This begins by having open and honest communication and listening to what may be behind the sometimes emotional exchanges.”\n\nHelman has spent the past 30 years working with and for children with disabilities. She has participated in the special education legislative summit in Washington, DC and is actively involved in statewide advocacy organizations. She notes that “my lifelong goal is to ensure positive outcomes for each child under my watch, and I work very hard to do that.”\n\nLetchworth School Business Administrator John Novak comments that “Since coming to Letchworth, Mrs. Helman has developed and implemented multiple new programs to better serve the students of our District including a Preschool Evaluation Team, Special Class in Integrated Settings classrooms for both three and four year olds (the only programs in our county serving these children), and extended school year programs.”\n\nNovak adds that “Mrs. Helman also provides professional service in a variety of roles including serving as the Children’s Advocacy Network Representative for the New York Council for Exceptional Children and Facilitator for the regional Special Education Administrators Group providing needed support, professional development, and sharing of resources through technology for administrators through the challenging times of the pandemic.”\n\nHelman has been in her current role for seven years.

Irving Schwartz was a founding member of SAANYS. This award is given annually to a retired SAANYS member who, in retirement, has made significant contributions to the welfare of the association, education, and the greater community.\n\nRegan has been active in education in the state of New York since 1972, including serving as a building leader/principal for almost 25 years. During his time as a building leader, Regan’s focus was always on the people, especially the students, rather than the “administrivia.” He stayed true to a set of best practices that included gaining respect, not popularity; setting clear goals; being a good listener; being a role model; being direct and constructive with feedback; not hesitating to delegate; and having meetings that count. Regan notes that by following these best practices, he and his staff “bought into what WE had established for our school and then … did it!”\n\nCurrently an instructor in the Educational Leadership Program at Buffalo State College and an adjunct professor of education at Niagara County Community College, Regan notes that he also inculcates a set of best practices for teaching his “Supervision of Teaching” graduate class. Those best practices include: establishing clear goals and expectations; making resources available for students to achieve these goals; developing a coherent instructional framework and regularly monitoring and evaluating it carefully; collecting evidence of students’ learning and learning needs with a balance of theory and practice; and creating an orderly, safe, and positive environment for learning to thrive.\n\nRegan adds that Irving Schwartz “made such significant contributions to the welfare of SAANYS, to public education, and to his greater community. I can only hope someday to accomplish a fraction of what this amazing educator did!”\n\nWilliamsville Central School Administrator John E. McKenna, Ed.D. notes that “Dr. Regan is the quintessential educator with in-depth knowledge of current educational practices, stellar character, and an extraordinary ability to motivate others. He is a caring, dedicated leader who is a true asset to SAANYS and the entire education profession. There is no one who is more deserving of the Irving Schwartz Distinguished Retiree Award than Dr. Douglas J. Regan.”\n\nThomas McCully, EdD, with Buffalo State College says that, in retirement, Dr. Regan has become “more involved in activities that continue to support a variety of efforts to ensure that young people receive the best education possible. He has also continued to serve fellow retirees through his leadership in SAANYS. Dr. Regan has made the local SAANYS region a wonderful resource for retirees by hosting informative luncheon meetings as well as a variety of events that bring retired administrators together to enjoy each other as well as to keep current on the latest issues that might impact them or the schools they once served.”\n\nRegan received his bachelor of science and master of science degrees from the State University College at Buffalo, and his doctorate in education from SUNY Buffalo.\n\nDr. Daniel Walh, principal at Transit Middle School in the Williamsville Central School District, has been has been selected as the 2021 New York State Secondary School Principal of the Year by the School Administrators Association of New York State (SAANYS). This award is given annually to a member of SAANYS to recognize outstanding principals who have succeeded in providing high-quality learning opportunities for students as well as demonstrating exemplary contributions to the profession.\n\nWalh will also represent New York as the NASSP NYS Principal of the Year as sponsored by SAANYS’ national affiliate, the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP). NASSP will select a National Principal of the Year from all the state finalists.\n\nServing as principal of Transit Middle School for ten years, Walh has been noted for leading many initiatives that together have resulted in Transit Middle School having been recognized as the top performing middle school in Western New York for well over a decade (Business First of Buffalo, 2010-2020). Prioritizing time for teacher collaboration and learning; enhancing staff and student connections; understanding the importance of positive behavior supports and meeting individual student needs; and leading high-quality instruction and creating opportunities for all students are all hallmarks of Walh’s leadership.\n\nCommented Charles Smilinich, principal of Dodge Elementary School, “Through his persistence, passion, and personal commitment to the students and the community, he has continued the tradition of keeping Transit Middle School as a high functioning, community orientated, hub of student and family learning. He has created an environment where school pride abounds and students and teachers feel safe, secure, valued, and destined for greatness.” Student Colby Yu noted, “Middle school was a wonderful time. During my time there, I can definitely say it helped with broadening my creativity along with networking and working well with others. Dr. Walh showed me the importance of leadership directly and indirectly, and I surely appreciated his guidance.”\n\nWalh also established a Transit Shared Decision Making Team (SDM) consisting of administrators, teachers, and parents at the school. This collaborative team explored the issue of equity at the school and implemented many initiatives to add voice to individuals and honor their unique differences. One of the initiatives was an equity survey of the 8th grade students. After learning from the results of a survey that only 40 percent felt their identity was being valued at school, the SDM team created a schoolwide activity inviting students to share their ancestry, country of origin, languages spoken, and states and countries they have lived in. This resulted in a vast amount of data that was used to create three floor-to-ceiling displays in the main foyer in which every student’s ancestry was represented with flags from that country, and “welcome” was written in each of the 33 languages spoken by the school community. During after-school events, visitors to the school have often commented how welcoming it is to see their family’s heritage honored and valued.\n\nCommented teacher Katie Neff, “Through these challenging unprecedented times, Dr. Walh takes time to email the teachers and thank them for what they are doing. He reminds them that they are appreciated and valued. These small gestures mean so much.”\n\nWalh received his bachelor of science in elementary education from the State University of New York College at Buffalo, master of science in education administration from University of Phoenix-De"
