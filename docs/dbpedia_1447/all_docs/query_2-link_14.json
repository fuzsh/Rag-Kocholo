        "text": "VOTERS in Nassau and Suffolk will be electing most of their county and town officials as well as local judges on Tuesday in contests that often have little significance beyond the locality. But many of the elections will have considerable significance and ramifications.\n\nThe Nassau County Executive contest is clearly the most significant in the two counties. There is considerably more at stake than the fates of the three leading contenders—Francis T. Purcell, the Republican‐Conservative candidate; Irwin J. Landes, the Democrat‐Liberal, and County Executive Ralph G. Caso, who was repudiated by his own Republican Party and is running as an independent.\n\nA Purcell victory would reaffirm the supremacy of the Nassau Republican chairman, Joseph M. Margiotta, and his G.O.P. organization just as a Purcell defeat would probably number Mr. Margiotta's days as county leader.\n\nThe expected defeat of Mr. Caso would not only probably end his political career but also serve notice on other public officials that incumbency is no guarantee of re‐election. William Cahn, who seemed a fixture as Nassau District Attorney, was defeated three years ago.\n\nAnother prominent Nassau Republican, State Senator John R. Dunne, is still on the ballot in the County Executive race as an independent candidate, but he has endorsed Mr. Purcell in an effort to make peace with Mr. Margiotta and to stave off any challenges of his State Senate nomination next year. Mr. Dunne will have to bide his time before striking out on new political paths at least as long as Mr. Margiotta is around.\n\nA victory for Mr. Landes, despite his newly disclosed tax difficulties, would project him as a corner in Democratic statewide politics. A Democrat who can win in the suburbs would be an asset on a state ticket.\n\nHowever, a Landes defeat would be a stunning blow to the already weak Nassau Democratic organization, which would have missed the opportunity of a lifetime to capitalize on an unprecedented split in Nassau Republican ranks.\n\nTwo other Democrats could still emerge from such a defeat in relatively strong positions.\n\nDenis E. Dillon, the Democratic District Attorney, is a heavy favorite to win re‐election overwhelmingly over Gregory P. Peterson, Republican, although Mr. Dillon has not uncovered widespread political and governmental corruption, which is frequent in oneparty governments.\n\nIndeed, the Republicans were ready to endorse Mr. Dillon until Democratic leaders protested. They did not want him helping G.O.P. candidates. He does, however, have the endorsements of the Conservatives and the Liberals as well as his own Democratic Party.\n\nMr. Dillon could become a strong prospect for a future County Executive nomination or statewide office after Tuesday.\n\nLewis J. Yevoli, who took the County Comptroller nomination as a consolation prize after being nosed out by Mr. Landes for the Democratic County Executive nomination, appears to be running a stronger race than Mr. Landes. His opponent is the colorless incumbent, M. Hallsted Christ. If Mr. Yevoli wins while Mr. Landes is losing, he will be political comer at least in the county.\n\nThe Conservative Party has as much at stake as its two big brother parties. Will the Conservatives provide the mar. gin of victory for Mr. Purcell and Mr. Christ? What will be the impact of a loss of Conservative endorsement for two of Mr. Margiotta's favorite politicians—former Representative Angelo Roncallo and Howard E. Levitt, Mr. Margiotta's law partner—who are running for the Supreme Court?\n\nWill the Conservatives provide the margin for two Democratic candidates for county judge, Marie G. Cantagata and David M. Shane?\n\nThe outcome will determine future Conservative bargaining power.\n\nThe voters will also decide the fate of two Republican politicians who were caught up in scandals, later cleared, and are now seeking to resume their political careers. They are Mr. Roncallo, who is seeking a Supreme Court judgeship, and John E. Kingston, the former Assembly majority leader who is running for County Court judge.\n\nOn the town level, a Margiotta protege, Hempstead Town Supervisor Alfonse M. D'Amato, hopes to be elected the town Presiding Supervisor—in effect the second‐ranking official in the county—and follow the same route to the top as Mr. Caso and Mr. Purcell before him.\n\nIn Suffolk, District Attorney Henry F. O'Brien, a Democrat and one of the most controversial prosecutors in the state, will be trying to survive the furor over his conflict with former Police Commissioner Eugene R. Kelley, as well as a strong challenge from a former Republican Assistant District Attorney, Patrick Henry.\n\nMr. O'Brien accused Mr. Kelley of corruption and Mr. Kelley retaliated with unprecedented criminal charges of homosexuality against Mr. O'Brien. Both men were cleared after a lengthy state‐imposed investigation.\n\nMr. O'Brien's seeming propensity for controversy was evident again recently when his fellow Democrats in Smithtown bitterly but privately protested the District Attorney's socializing with Nicholas Barbato, the Smithtown Republican leader who has been the target of bossism and corruption charges by Smithtown Democratic candidates.\n\nAn O'Brien victory would nevertheless continue the pressure on the Suffolk Republican organization, already bat. tered and scarred by recurrent scan dais. A prosecutor of the opposite party is always a threat.\n\nEven more significant is the question of which party will control the County Legislature and whether the Democratic capture of an 11‐7 majority two years was an electoral fluke.\n\nDemocrats can afford to lose only one seat since the loss of two seats would mean a 9‐9 tie. County Executive John V. N. Klein could break a tie in favor of his fellow Republicans for the selection of the legislative hierarchy, which controls most of the Jobs and the flow of legislation.\n\nIf the Democrats manage to pick up legislative seat—giving them a twothirds majority—they would have enough votes to override vetoes of legislation by Mr. Klein and to shuffle money around in the budget regardless of Mr. Klein's desires. “That would be a highly dangerous development,” said Mr. Klein's chief deputy, Arthur Bergmann.\n\nIndividual Legislators will also have a major stake in Tuesday's election. If the Republicans regain the majority, Michael J. Grant of Brentwood, the former Presiding Officer, will presumably resume his old post.\n\nThe current Presiding Officer, Floyd S. Linton, a Democrat, wants to win reelection handily to preserve his political claim to County Executive when Mr. Klein steps down.\n\nAnother Democratic county legislator, Dr. Martin J. Feldman, a dentist, doesn't want to wait that long. He is ready to take on the politically potent Mr. Klein in 1979, when the County Executive will presumably be seeking a third term. Dr. Feldman has to win easily Tuesday to stake a claim to the County Executive nomination two years hence.\n\nOn the town level in Suffolk—once completely dominated by the Republicans—the G.O.P. is looking for a comeback. Half the 10 towns now have Democratic Supervisors and half Republican. Significantly, Democrats head the administrations in four of the six western and more populated townships, while Republicans are concentrated in the thinly populated east end towns.\n\nThe town posts are important because town hall patronage provides the jobs, influence and contributions that a build a political organization from the ground up.\n\nSome of the more significant town elections are in Smithtown, Islip and East Hampton.\n\nIn Smithtown, Patrick Vecchio, a former New York City police officer who headed John V. Lindsay's security detail and is now deputy director of the State Tax Commission Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Unit, is running a determined uphill campaign against the Smithtown Republican organization, its powerful leader, Mr. Barbato and the incumbent Republican Supervisor, Charles F. Cacciabaudo.\n\nLast year, the Smithtown Republicans, probably the best‐organized G.O.P. town organization in the county, were stunned when Assemblyman Robert C. Wertz, who was considered a potential successor to Mr. Klein, squeaked through to re‐election only by virtue of the Conservative Party vote. Mr. Klein is also a protégé of Mr. Barbato, probably the most powerful town leader in the county. The loss of town hall would deprive the local G.O.P. organization of its patronage and influence base."
