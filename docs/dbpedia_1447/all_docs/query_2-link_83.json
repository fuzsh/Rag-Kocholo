and\n\nWhereas, Title I of the Health Security Act would require employers to pay for eighty percent of a comprehensive set of health care benefits for all employees, including Medicare recipients, and prorated payments for part-time and seasonal workers; and\n\nWhereas, such employer mandates would result in job loss, a reduction in profits and productivity for American business in general, and small business in particular, and result in higher prices for consumers and lower wages for workers; and\n\nWhereas, small business owners justifiably fear these employer mandates will be utilized to fund an entitlement created, managed, and regulated by the federal government, no different from Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or Unemployment Insurance; and\n\nWhereas, such employer mandates have every characteristic of the kind of mandatory payment that is most damaging to small business and the jobs it creates - it is, in fact, a payroll tax; and\n\nWhereas, almost all employers would be required to fulfill this obligation by paying a specific percentage of payroll to a regional health alliance; these mandatory payroll-based premiums constitute a huge, new payroll tax to pay for sixty percent of the proposed new health care system; and\n\nWhereas, a national health board would have the unchecked power to increase at any time the percentage of payroll required to be paid by employers to the regional health alliance; and\n\nWhereas, this payroll tax would be particularly injurious to new businesses, which create one in three new jobs in the United States because the tax mandates an additional fixed cost on those businesses every time they want to grow and hire new employees; and\n\nWhereas, payroll taxes assessed to pay for mandatory benefits also impose upon small business owners a new cost over which they have no control, thus limiting their ability to provide the best possible compensation package for each individual business's survival and its employees; and\n\nWhereas, employer mandates would also impose upon employers a wave of paperwork to be submitted to regional alliances to prove compliance with the law and to calculate payments; such massive amounts of paperwork and the cost associated with it would, in essence, be a hidden tax on employers; and\n\nWhereas, because most small businesses are labor intensive, particularly in the retail and service sector, small firms are disproportionately damaged by a payroll-based tax; a payroll tax also acts as a disincentive for maintaining existing employees; and\n\nWhereas, while small business in general would be adversely affected by employer mandates, small businesses owned by minorities and women would be affected to an even greater extent because these firms tend to be the smallest of our businesses; and\n\nWhereas, based on data from the Census Bureau, the Congressional Budget Office, and other reliable sources, sixty percent of employers in the United States have fewer than five employees, accounting for three million of our employers; of this group, seventy-four percent do not provide health care insurance for their employees; and\n\nWhereas, employer mandates preclude a health care reform approach that makes it possible for these small businesses to respond to a reformed health care insurance market; instead, it immediately and disproportionately raises the payroll costs of these businesses by 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of payroll, and ultimately makes them responsible for eighty percent of a very rich standard health care standard benefits package; and\n\nWhereas, there exists near unanimity of opinion among the American people, congressional leaders, economists, and even proponents in the White House that employer mandates would result in job loss and prove damaging to small business; and\n\nWhereas, sixty-four percent of Americans are concerned that the Health Security Act will cause employers to eliminate jobs, and seventy-three percent of Americans believe the plan would be injurious to small business; and\n\nWhereas, the Council of Economic Advisors has acknowledged that six hundred thousand jobs could be lost under the President's plan; the small business subsidy plan is in and of itself an acknowledgement of the burden that would be placed on small firms by employer mandates; and\n\nWhereas, a one thousand member survey of the American Economics Association in June, 1993, indicated that eighty percent of the economists interviewed projected a decrease in employment among all employees as the result of requiring employers to provide health care benefits to low-wage employees; and\n\nWhereas, another study conducted by the Employment Policies Institute in March, 1994, concluded that requiring employers to pay for workers' health care insurance expenses would increase labor costs, leading to the loss of 2.1 million jobs; and\n\nWhereas, a Consad Research Corporation study found that three leading health care reform plans requiring employer mandates would affect 7.5 million to 18 million jobs in terms of reduced wages, reduction of other benefits, and potential cuts in hours worked; job loss estimates ranged from four hundred thousand to over one million. Now, therefore,\n\nBe it resolved by the Senate:\n\nThat this body memorializes the President of the United States and the Congress of the United States to refrain from including employer mandates as part of any health care reform legislation.\n\nBe it further resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that any federal health care reform enacted into law shall:\n\n(1) preserve the right of all Americans to choose to maintain their existing health insurance policy;\n\n(2) preserve the right of all Americans to choose their own doctors and medical service providers;\n\n(3) preserve the right of all Americans to finance their choice of doctors and medical service providers through private health insurance by making participation in an alliance, cooperative, collective, or any other purchasing entity strictly voluntary; and\n\n(4) guarantee nondiscriminatory tax treatment for the purchase of private health insurance no different than the tax treatment which might be provided to those who purchase health insurance through a government-controlled alliance, cooperative, collective, or any other arrangement.\n\nBe it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the President of the United States, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, and each member of this state's congressional delegation.\n\nReferred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nS. 1449 -- Senator Matthews: A SENATE RESOLUTION TO CONGRATULATE MISS CRYSTAL CUYLER OF ESTILL, SOUTH CAROLINA ON HER GRADUATION FROM ESTILL HIGH SCHOOL, TO COMMEND HER AS ONE OF THE BEST 1600 METER RUNNERS IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA HIGH SCHOOL RANKS, AND WISH HER LUCK IN HER FUTURE ENDEAVORS.\n\nThe Senate Resolution was adopted.\n\nH. 5255 -- Reps.

I really feel awfully bad, this morning to hear my friend, John Courson, the Senator from Richland, make the statement he made. First of all, I want to commend Sen. Patterson, Sen. Smith and others who attempted to put together this compromise which I thought was a very reasonable compromise in moving this thing in the direction that it ought to go and to bring about some unity and healing for the people of South Carolina and those individuals who have labored so hard to put this issue behind us. It is regretful, it is regretful, Sen Courson, that this came so close and that we were not able at this point to get some one to take the leadership.\n\nI certainly would hope that the Governor of this State, who I feel has the clout, and could have the leadership, with the members of the House -- Republicans who are in great number over there -- to say to them that this is an opportune time, the fullness of time, Sen. Smith, to move forward on this issue. I think that it would have been one of the most courageous acts, Sen. from Florence, that the leadership of this State could have taken. It would have been and could have been a historical moment for anybody in this State in a leadership position to stand up and say this is the moment to decide. This IS the opportune time to bring about the kind of healing that this whole compromise would have brought into being. So it is very regretful that, at this time, the leadership responsibility has not materialized.\n\nI would hope that somehow, some way, some bold, courageous leadership would advance and take up the command in this whole fight for unity, healing and brotherhood in this state. We've come a long way in South Carolina, Sen. Williams, to listen to the choir, or the ensemble, single the beautiful music on the program in honor of our president pro tempore in this chamber. It does give a message to South Carolinians. But we must go just a little bit further, because perception and symbolism mean quite a bit. So it's so sad to see that we don't have that leadership in the House of Representatives and our State leader has not seen fit to take up that mantle and run with it.\n\nOne day, I hope, somebody will be courageous enough to make the sacrifice.\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nOn motion of Senator WILSON, with unanimous consent, ordered printed in the Journal.\n\nRECESS\n\nAt 12:10 P.M., on motion of Senator MOORE, the Senate receded from business not to exceed ten minutes.\n\nAt 12:42 P.M., the Senate resumed.\n\nSenator McCONNELL was recognized to address remarks to the members.\n\nRemarks by Senator McCONNELL\n\nThank you, Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Senate:\n\nI know the Senator from Richland is somewhere around, but I want to address you briefly on the subject that we talked about this morning. Two Senators from Richland had an opportunity to address each one of you, because there is going to be a lot of political posturing in the days ahead over this particular subject. I want to give you a backdrop. The Senator from Greenville, Senator Verne Smith, unfortunately had to go back to the Conference Committee. I am not stepping on anybody's toes nor do I mean to, if I hurt your feelings. If you feel the shoe fits you, I don't mean it to fit you. I am going to try to give you, as best I can, a statement of where we are on this subject.\n\nThe Senator from Richland, the Senator from Greenville and I have followed the question of the Confederate Battle Flag almost religiously; watching everything every step of the way. We did not fire off into this subject until we felt the Flag had been attacked. There is no license on who could have been involved in it; it was simply a matter of interest--simply who wanted to be involved in that. I did not see a flock of House Members coming up to defend the Flag. I did not see a flock of the House Members at the Confederate Memorial Day Services, Senator from Richland, neither in Charleston nor in Columbia or anywhere else. When it comes down to the question of the heritage and the celebration of the Flag and of the people who fought under that Flag, some of those speaking now, I never saw or heard from about this issue. We were concerned from a heritage standpoint, and I challenge anybody to tell me about somebody who loves having the Confederate Flag flying atop that dome more than the Senator from Richland, the Senator from Greenville, or myself. It's no easy task for us to sit down and look at a proposition which transfers its location from the dome to some other location. That is not an easy job to do. But some of us who have tried to defend that Flag, Senator from Richland, have been too bashful about it. We have not told you about the fact that our ethics records have been checked; we have not told you about some of the attacks that we have been the recipients of. The same goes for the other side that have had to come out, step out and stand up for what they believe in. They had to take the backlash that came with it. Senator from Richland, I know you have had to undergo the same thing--the extremes on this issue. Here we are in the final days of this debate and it's decision time. Yes, I would like it to stay on the dome. Yes, I wish the Flag would continue to fly on the dome, and I am prepared to fight for that position. But how many other people, when we really get down to putting the rubber on the road on this issue, are going to fight? People are bashful about even talking about it; about even voting on it, because it is a highly politically and emotionally charged subject. It burns and cuts in more than one direction. It's an issue that we have struggled with. The Flag is the tip of the iceberg of this issue though; the issue is bigger than the Flag. The issue to us is the monuments, the graves, the emblems, the heritage, the history. How do we in South Carolina, having a large flock of citizens who love those emblems, and having another large group of citizens who don't care for those emblems because those emblems have been misused, (misused in their face to the point they distrust them and see in them something other than what we see in them) somehow bring all that together. So that as a people in the years to come, we can celebrate our heritage and do so through some duality in this State and through tolerance so that we are not at one another's throat, so that we are not rehashing over old arguments and old fights. There is no easy answer to this. The quick way out would be to draw the line in the sand on it. But let me tell you about the lines in the sand. The members of the House have been unable or unwilling to address it. There is the fact that we have known for over six months that law suits were coming to bear on the State of South Carolina on the question of the Flag. A Federal law suit, a State law suit now, and there will be, I hear, other law suits brought on the Flag. Suppose, one of these law suits is successful. Where are we? The Flag is gone from the dome. Who all is going to be in the brigade to charge back here to put the Flag back up? When the Chambers of Commerce, whoever is Governor, the leading newspapers and others say, enough is enough, it's gone, so put it behind you. How does the Senator from Richland and the Senator from Greenville and other associated groups react? What do we do? Do we let the Flag go to a quiet corner of a museum? Do we stand up and try to sell flying it? How many people are going to stand up in here under that climate to put the Flag back on the dome or to fight to put it on the lawn? What's going to happen if the law suit is successful? First of all, you are going to have a renewed effort to bring the Flag back, a renewed effort to keep it off the dome--division, division, division. Controversy, that's what we are heading toward. We are heading toward some rather rough rhetorical times. Tempers and division, if we are successful in defending the law suits and we continue to keep it up there. We will be back here next year fighting it again. But suppose that an overzealous Governor decides to challenge the Concurrent Resolution and orders General Services not to fly it, how many are going to vote then, how many are going to stand up and say it is time for us to go to Court and challenge the Governor? The division again in the public, the continuation of the debate here.\n\nYou see, people are not telling the public about the perils of the law suits, the challenges, the fact that it is up there by Concurrent Resolution. They are not talking about that back home. They say, oh I just want to keep it flying on the dome. Well, I got an Amendment through the Senate. It went over to the House. What happened to the Amendment in the House? You have not seen the Amendment back over here. In fact, Senator from Richland, the Amendment was offered one time in the House and pulled back down--nothing was done over there to enhance the legal protection of the Confederate Battle Flag on the dome. Where is this commitment to protect it? I stood in here, I took some heat from some of my friends on that. I was willing to stand up for what I believed in on that, but the point I am making to you here is that the fervor over there in the House, where is the fervor, where is the dedication? Everybody has known that the law suits were coming, and I have not seen legislation come out of the House to enhance the protection of the Flag. I think it is time to talk plain about this matter. We are involved in the law suit, I think our side will be successful. But if it is, we are going to continue to have this debate and we will be back next year. If we are not, we are going to have this debate also.\n\nSo, what did the Senator from Richland, Senator Courson, try to do? I am going to give you the backdrop to that answer first. We tried the Stars and Bars to go up the dome but that didn't fly. We looked at two flags; we looked at a whole host of flags. At some point, there has to be a realization by those of us who are very loyal to this Confederate Battle Flag and to the Confederate emblems that we have got to give what we are asking for and that is toleration and incorporation, a duality in South Carolina. Thus, what the Senator from Richland talked about was one of the most important ingredients about it--settlement, permanence. It was not just an attempt to do something about the question of the Flag, but it was to settle it once and for all across this State, for generations to come, that these emblems were not racist emblems per se. It's how they are used. There would be no attacks on the monuments. There would be no attacks on street names. The confrontation over Confederate items would cease. We would together have created, what I call a partnership in progress for the people of this State. We don't like looking at a proposition to move it down off the dome. But neither do I suspect politically some of the opponents like having to recognize this heritage, especially in light of some of the statements by the NAACP.\n\nI want to say this firmly, and I don't mean to charge us up. I had some people call in and say, Senator, why are you caving in? Why are you giving up? Are you scared of the boycott? I am not scared of that boycott. That's like water on a duck's back to me. I think the thing will fizzle out. It will get about as high as the Vanguard rocket got off its launching pad. The problem is that it doesn't solve things. I want to be able to celebrate my ancestry, my heritage and not feel like I trample on the feelings of others.\n\nTake the Senator from Florence, Senator Glover. I wish a lot of you had had the opportunity to hear some of her presentations and to hear what to me was a learning experience which came from her heart about trying to understand what it was that we saw in those flags and in that history. The Senator from Charleston, Senator Ford, who took the time to go to a Confederate Ghost Walk to see and learn something about it, to find out what it was that made some of us tick. The Senator from Richland, Senator Jackson, who made a bold public statement that took courage and conviction, to step forward and say, \"I don't view it as a racist emblem, I just don't think it belongs where it is.\" In each instance, initiatives to try to understand. The Senator from Richland, Senator Patterson, I have never heard you say anything disrespectful or ugly about the Confederate emblems. Never have I heard you get up here and blast them. And my old friend, the Senator from many counties. He and I are from the same county. We march to a different drummer on occasions, but inside his message he seeks to understand what it is that you love about your idols and to find some mutual way that we together can share South Carolina's past.\n\nSome ask, why are you putting a monument up there on the State House grounds? Those people who carried the struggle for civil rights to give South Carolinians the basic right to sit at a lunch counter, or to go in a bathroom, these people were the warriors for civil rights. They had the courage of their convictions, they were willing to lay it on the line. It is part of South Carolina's story, of its evolution and its Constitution. The same way they view those people in their civil rights is the way many of us view the folks who answered the call of this State who went off to serve in gray for states rights. They fought for the State's rights and their own view of the Constitution. There is a commonality in our past, both in tragedy, and in victory, and in a lesson. But we, at some point, have to get together and share it, or at least respect it. You don't have to like it. You don't have to believe it, but respect it, because other persons' motives and their love for it is pure.\n\nTheir reasons are why that respect should be there. So Senator from Richland, and Senator from Greenville, Senator I don' know what is being pictured of you. I know what the far right will say about the compromise as capitulation. Why have you given in? Why are you succumbing to the threats and stuff? That is not the motivating reason for this. The motivation for trying to work it out comes from days, weeks and months of talking, learning, understanding, and sharing one another's differing views. Certainly the Senator from Richland or the Senator from Orangeburg knows why it is we want it up there, not to celebrate the Klan or something like that. On another hand why the Senator from Richland or many of the other black politicians want a monument, is not just because you got a monument, so I want a monument. But it's because they are part of this State and they are part of this history. I submit to you it is easy for any of us to just posture on this issue and say, I absolutely am not going to do anything other than keep the Flag on the dome. I wish it were as simple as that. But the issue is not that simple--the road ahead is pretty rough. None of us knows what the final outcome is going to be. But what are we going to do? We will come back next year in the midst of conflict to square off and again try to work something out or do we try to work something out now from the standpoint of each understanding where the other is coming from. It's a hard issue. The Senator from Richland is right. The Senator from Richland has walked battlefields. I have walked battlefields. I go out on the weekends, put on a uniform and fight. I have fought in both blue and gray. You start to get a taste of what 102 degrees is with heavy wool on, crawling through woods with ticks and poison ivy. You start to begin to understand what they went through when they answered the call and left their homes.\n\nI tried to understand the apprehension to the Flag when I talked to Senator Ford and he told me about people outside of the building waving Confederate Flags, Klansmen, reaching for him, wanting to get their hands on him. Then you begin to understand something about where his animosity of that emblem comes from. To those of us who are pro-flag, where we made our mistakes, Senator, you and I were too young years ago, was not a larger standing-up to those who misused these emblems. Yes, I think, the dome is a fitting place for the Flag, but I understand those who don't, and I wish I didn't have to consider having to move it. But what needs to be talked about is trying to come together, Senator from Clarendon. So that you respect what I like, and I respect what you like. I am not going to tell you what you are about and you are not going to tell me what I am about. I am about what I am, a person. That's the sort of dialogue we must engage in. I go back to the Senator from Florence, Senator Glover, who really touched the hearts of some and the Daughters of the Confederacy at the Hearing. You would have never heard of this years ago, the Daughters wanting her to come and speak to their group. That is the sort of communication, sort of give and take we've got to get, Senator Glover. You touched the hearts of some and opened up some communication. All I can tell you is that when we celebrate the ancestors, Senator, and the gentlemen come out here and put on the uniforms in gray to put the honor guard at the State House monument, it is out of respect for our ancestors who made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThe Flag is politicized now by some right-wing groups that have political agendas. The question of the Flag has nothing to do with whether or not you are pro-NAACP, anti-NAACP, or anything else. We in this State need to act on the Flag for the proper reasons and out of mutual respect. If it were a question of putting it in a quiet corner of a museum, because it is a racist emblem, there would be nothing to talk about. These ladies and gentlemen have talked about a final settlement, a permanent settlement. Not just of the Flag, but of the emblems, of the celebrations, of everything, so that a year from now we are not involved in this sort of debate. This represents a movement for them, because the NAACP in a 1986 or 1987 Resolution called for the removal of the monuments and the Flag, Senator from Clarendon, and that is not a tolerable situation. These legislators have not asked for that. They have not demanded that. They have not badmouthed it or anything else. They simply talked about a sharing arrangement and mutual respect. And I ask each of them to seriously give that some thought.\n\nI close by telling you, and I think I speak for Senator Courson and Senator Smith, we live and breathe everything there is about the Confederate soldiers. We read, we talk, we collect different things. You and I like to visit battlefields. It is no easy task for us to stand up and say, if this will settle it, we will vote and take it off the dome. I don't consider this surrender; I don't consider it to be a sellout; I consider it to be a mutual arrangement so that we mutually can respect one another and be together part of this State, and be a State that not only does that but has found the common ground so that we can celebrate Confederate ancestors, civil rights ancestry and heritage side by side. That is the enrichment of a society. That is a unified society and a free society. At some point, I think it was Dr. King who said, and I can only paraphrase, you can live together as friends or will end up dying as enemies. I have seen African-Americans put on the blue uniforms, Senator. They are in reenactment now. It is a wonderful sharing experience. It is a just common ancestry, a common suffering. I can never convince some of you of why all the War was fought. You can never convince me of the other. But we can mutually respect where one another is coming from. I simply tell each of you it is an issue which can be settled and made permanent in the laws of the State of South Carolina. That is progress. That is partnership. That is mutual respect. I felt like I just needed to get up here, Senators, because there are those who are saying, why are you caving in? I have gotten some calls like that. It is not caving in. We fought. You and I fought for a referendum, for amendments. We have done everything that we can do. We have helped raise the money and do everything to make sure that the memory of those Confederate Soldiers is preserved so that they did not die in vain. And that it is preserved not for me but for the next generation. So it will not be something they must hunt up in a dusty book over in a museum. It is something we believe is a story to tell. In a previous speech I talked about all these people had left when the War was over. Remember Sherman burned almost a 40-mile wide path of destruction through this State. All these people had when they returned, was the legacy of their valor and that is what they cherished. That is where, if you want to call it the romanticism or whatever, became surrounded around those emblems and the men in gray, and their supreme sacrifice. This is why Pickett's charge still conjures up the feelings not of hopelessness and despair but rather of pride. Because on that day they marched and put the question of valor above life itself. Senators, I salute each one of you who have sat down and worked with us. It has not been easy for any of you politically. It is not easy for us. I can only hope like the Senator from Richland that regardless of where we go during the Summer, whoever is victorious temporarily, when we return in January that we will try to work something out which permanently puts this behind us. That when Confederate Memorial Day comes around or you come in my office and see a flag, you and I can look at one another and understand where we are coming from. In the same way whether it comes to the 54th Flag, the First South Carolina Flag or the Black Liberation Flag or whatever, each of us can understand and respect where each is coming from. I hear some say, the Black Liberation Flag is not an American Flag. They have not done their research, they don't even know the story of the Marcus Garvey movement and the story of those colors, and the civil rights struggle it was carried in. But see, I have learned something out of this debate and this process, and I guess I say with a great deal of respect to each one of you that you all have each one tried to sit down and work out something that we all can live with what we think. We may not all be 100 percent for it. It is hard for me, as it is hard for you, but it is the example that becomes the rule and the rule, hopefully, will bring the sort of tranquility and hope to the people of this State.\n\nSo, Mr. President, I want to thank the Senate for the attention. Senator from Richland, the Senator from Greenville, who I hope can hear me, it's been a pleasure standing with you all. I don't think we are any less loyal to what we believe in. If I go to my grave now, I want to know that one of the things I have done is preserve the memory of those people who wore the gray.\n\nOn motion of Senator WILSON, with unanimous consent, ordered printed in the Journal.\n\nSenator MITCHELL was recognized to address remarks to the members.\n\nRemarks by Senator MITCHELL\n\nMembers of the Senate, some of you will recall that I moved to have remarks made by Senator Courson, Senator Patterson and any others be placed in the journal. I did that because I have certainly been moved today and I have not been a part of the negotiations relative to the issue of the symbol of our state. Very able and capable people are taking this on and I feel they have done a yeoman job.\n\nTwenty years ago, I was elected to the House of Representatives and there were only thirteen blacks and now there are four of us left, Senators Washington, Matthews, Patterson and myself. This was an issue that was taken up early by Senator Patterson. He has indicated that it is not he who is getting credit for anything, because I have sat here and I have listened to giants. I have seen three hundred-eighty degree changes of people and their attitudes as it relates to this issue. I have heard the story and I have read the story about the Senator from Greenville whose father was released as a confederate veteran. He had to walk home to South Carolina.\n\nIn other stories that show that there was a great intolerance during a time of misunderstanding. I have not joined in this, nor have I sort to make it part of my life, except to say that I have always voted to have the flag removed. I have never heard anyone who has applicated such in any way denigrated. It is just that there is an inconsistency in regards to what we talk about and what we do. Misconceptions just like the, \"Charge of the Light Brigade\", soldiers ought to ask why there is else but to do or die. I have seen giants rise in this body and maybe it is why I sought election to it, because it convey a different attitude and certainly one of great maturity. If ever there has been a time in which a State has shown that the senior body is one of wisdom, reconciliation, understanding, and compassion with a relative respect which is so essential for communication.\n\nI heard the Senator from Charleston talk about what he learned about Marcus Garvey. He did suggest some things that are arbitrarily rolled together to represent nations or states or political subdivisions, but philosophical ideas that go beyond these things to be able to bring people together. We were brought together at one time when it was advantageous to the nation to whether or not those who fought and fell under philosophies of others truly understood is not a question, they did.\n\nNo one must ever forget history because it has a way of repeating itself. The one thing is we can learn from it. Heritage we can honor it and certainly as for the future we can improve it. We have improved it by virtue of coming together on one of the most controversial issues that have been in the State House for at least twenty years, when the first blacks were elected to the General Assembly and sat in the House of Representatives. I want to commend each and every one of you. Senators McConnell, Verne Smith, John Courson, Kay Patterson, McKinley Washington, Maggie Glover, John Matthews, Robert Ford, Darrell Jackson and others who have shown a sensitivity to an issue that our state needs to take on and move on.\n\nIt may be they would not go this time, but the bridges have been built. The barriers have been destroyed. There must be continuity in continuing the dialogue and communication, so that there will be no breakdown. This is an issue that if we can resolve, we can resolve any other problem that comes before us and affect us as a State and as a people. Thank you. God bless you, and keep up the good work.\n\nOn motion of Senator WILSON, with unanimous consent, ordered printed in the Journal.\n\nDEBATE INTERRUPTED\n\nS. 1196 -- Senators Rankin and Elliott: A BILL TO AMEND TITLE 31, CODE OF LAWS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, 1976, BY ADDING CHAPTER 12 SO AS TO AUTHORIZE THE CREATION OF A REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY TO ACQUIRE AND DISPOSE OF FEDERAL MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE AUTHORITY, ITS POWERS, DUTIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES.\n\nOn motion of Senator PASSAILAIGUE, with unanimous consent, Report of the Committee of Conference was taken up for immediate consideration.\n\nSenator PASSAILAIGUE spoke on the report.\n\nPoint of Quorum\n\nSenator RICHTER made the point that a quorum was not present.

Title 31 of the 1976 Code is amended by adding:\n\n\"CHAPTER 12 Redevelopment Authority to Acquire and Dispose of Federal Military Installations\n\nSection 31-12-10. Short title.\n\nThis chapter may be cited as the \"Military Facilities Redevelopment Law\".\n\nSection 31-12-20. The General Assembly finds that:\n\n(1) As a result of the closure and realignment of military installations in the United States, federal property located in the State has and will become available for the state's use. It is in the best interests of the citizens of this State for the State, municipalities, and counties to work in concert and oversee and dispose of federal military facilities and other excess federal property, in an orderly and cooperative manner. It is the intent of this chapter that redevelopment authorities may be appointed to deal with military facilities that have been scheduled for closure by the United States Congress and to consult with the federal government pursuant to federal law relating to defense base closure and realignment. If any other incidental excess federal property is included with a scheduled closing, that property may also be dealt with by the authorities.\n\n(2) The redevelopment of these facilities may often require substantial periods of time and substantial investment in redevelopment of the properties, including public infrastructure on the properties themselves and in the communities immediately surrounding the properties in order to re-integrate the former military facilities into the surrounding communities, and all reasonable means should be provided to assist the redevelopment authorities created pursuant to this chapter to fund improvements for redevelopment, including, in the case of properties located within incorporated municipalities, tax increment financing as authorized by Section 14 of Article X of the Constitution of South Carolina.\n\nSection 31-12-30. As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:\n\n(1) `Area of Operation' means the area within the territorial boundaries of the counties entitled to representation on an authority which consist of both the real property to be disposed of by an authority as well as any other properties disposed of directly by the federal government to public or private persons or entities, other than disposal to the federal government for other military uses, in connection with military installation closure and realignment, together with such areas of the surrounding community as may need planning for infrastructure improvements to support the redevelopment project area.\n\n(2) `Authority' means a redevelopment authority created pursuant to Section 31-12-40.\n\n(3) `Municipality' means an incorporated municipality of this State.\n\n(4) `Obligations' means bonds, notes, or other evidence of indebtedness issued by the municipality to carry out a redevelopment project or to refund outstanding obligations.\n\n(5) `Redevelopment plan' means the comprehensive program of the authority for redevelopment intended by the payment of redevelopment costs to redevelop properties scheduled for disposal which may tend to return properties to the tax rolls, replace lost jobs, and integrate the properties back into the community, thereby enhancing the tax bases of the taxing districts which extend into the project redevelopment area and the economic health of the community in which it lies. Each redevelopment plan shall set forth in writing the program to be undertaken to accomplish the objectives and shall include, but not be limited to, estimated redevelopment project costs, possible sources of funds to pay costs, the most recent equalized assessed valuation of the project area as of the time of creation of a tax increment finance district pursuant to Section 31-12-200, an estimate as to the equalized assessed valuation after redevelopment, and the general land uses to apply in the redevelopment project area.\n\n(6) `Redevelopment project' means any buildings, improvements, including street improvements, water, sewer and storm drainage facilities, parking facilities, and recreational facilities. Any project or undertaking authorized under Section 6-21-50 may also qualify as a redevelopment project under this chapter. All such projects may be owned by the authority, the municipality, the county, or any other appropriate public body. This term shall include portions of the redevelopment project located outside the redevelopment project area so long as they provide needed infrastructure support for the redevelopment project area.\n\n(7) `Redevelopment project area' means an area within the incorporated area of a municipality and designated pursuant to Section 31-12-200, which is not less in the aggregate than one and one-half acres. It shall include both the real property to be disposed of by an authority as well as any other properties disposed of directly by the federal government to public or private persons or entities, other than disposal to the federal government for other military uses, in connection with military installation closure and realignment. Redevelopment project areas designated pursuant to Section 31-12-200 shall not be counted against the limits on acreage of redevelopment project areas within municipalities contained in Section 31-6-30(7).\n\n(8) `Redevelopment project costs' means and includes the sum total of all reasonable or necessary costs incurred or estimated to be incurred and any costs incidental to a redevelopment project. The costs include, without limitation:\n\n(a) Costs of studies and surveys, plans, and specifications; professional service costs including, but not limited to, architectural, engineering, legal, marketing, financial, planning, or special services.\n\n(b) Property assembly costs including, but not limited to, acquisition of land and other property, real or personal, or rights or interest therein, demolition of buildings, and the clearing and grading of land.\n\n(c) Costs of rehabilitation, reconstruction, repair, or remodeling of a redevelopment project.\n\n(d) Costs of the construction of a redevelopment project.\n\n(e) Financing costs including, but not limited to, all necessary and incidental expenses related to the issuance of obligations and which may include payment of interest on any obligations issued under the provisions of this chapter accruing during the estimated period of construction of any redevelopment project for which the obligations are issued and including reasonable reserves related thereto.\n\n(f) Relocation costs to the extent that a municipality determines that relocation costs must be paid or required by federal or state law.\n\n(9) `Taxing districts' means counties, incorporated municipalities, schools, special purpose districts, and any other municipal corporations or districts with the power to levy taxes.\n\n(10) `Real property' shall include all property assessed under authority of Section 12-4-540 when such term is used in this chapter with regard to tax increment financing.\n\nSection 31-12-40.

No more than one authority may be created with jurisdiction over a single federal military installation. Only one authority may be designated within any county and the Governor shall exercise his authority under this chapter in such a manner as to ensure that the composition of any authority created under this section shall be structured or restructured in accordance with the requirements contained hereinbelow as additional properties may be added through other closures and realignments, as properties are disposed of and as federally defined Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA's) are redefined, from time to time. If an authority is designated, it shall be the sole representative of the State for negotiations with the appropriate federal authority for reuse and disposal of property.\n\n(B) If the federal property subject to disposal is contained wholly within one county, which county does not lie in an MSA extending over more than one South Carolina county and is not included in a multicounty authority under subsections (C) or (D), the authority must include:\n\n(1) two representatives of the State, nominated by a majority of the Senate and a majority of the House, who must be appointed by the Governor;\n\n(2) three representatives of the county appointed by the county governing body;\n\n(3) three representatives of each municipality in which the municipality's boundaries contain all or a portion of the military properties scheduled for disposal, appointed by the municipal governing body; and\n\n(4) one at-large appointment by the Governor, who shall be a resident of the county.\n\n(C) If the federal property subject to disposal is contained within more than one county, with no portion of such counties lying within an MSA which extends over more than one South Carolina county, the authority must include:\n\n(1) two representatives of the State nominated by a majority of the Senate and a majority of the House, who must be appointed by the Governor;\n\n(2) two representatives of each county appointed by the respective county governing body;\n\n(3) two representatives of each municipality in which the municipality's boundaries contain all or a portion of the military properties scheduled for disposal, appointed by the respective municipal governing body; and\n\n(4) one at-large appointment by the Governor, who shall be a resident of one of the counties.\n\n(D) If the federal property subject to disposal is contained wholly or partially within a county, all or a portion of which lies in an MSA which extends over more than one South Carolina county, the authority must include:\n\n(1) one representative of each South Carolina county which contains all or a portion of the federal property subject to disposal, appointed by the respective county governing body;\n\n(2) one representative of each South Carolina county in the MSA not entitled to a representative under subsection (D)(1), appointed by the respective county governing body;\n\n(3) one representative of each municipality located wholly or partly within the MSA with a population of at least 50,000 as determined by the latest official federal census, appointed by the respective municipal governing body;\n\n(4) such additional representatives as may be necessary to assure that any municipality within whose boundaries the major portion of properties scheduled for disposal lies shall have a total number of representatives being two less than the collective number of representatives from all other appointing bodies or officers provided for in subsections (D)(1) through (D)(8), appointed by the municipal governing body;\n\n(5) if the major portion of properties scheduled for disposal lies within a single county but not within the boundaries of any single municipality, such additional representatives as may be necessary to assure that county two less than the collective number of representatives from all other appointing bodies or officers provided for in subsections (D)(1) through (D)(8), appointed by the county governing body;\n\n(6) one member elected by a majority of the Senate;\n\n(7) one member elected by a majority of the House of Representatives; and\n\n(8) one at-large appointment by the Governor, who shall be a resident of one of the counties which lie, wholly or partially, in the MSA which is entitled to an appointment under subsections (D)(1) or (D)(2).\n\n(E) No member of an authority may be an elected official or have held an elected office within one year of the date on which the member begins service on an authority. Nor may any member hold another office of honor or profit of this State while serving on the authority as prohibited by the South Carolina Constitution. Nor may any member of an authority established pursuant to subsection (D) serve or have served as an officer of, or as a member of the executive committee of, any authority, commission, committee, or other entity relating to or concerned with the effects of the closure of a federal military installation which has been established by an executive order of the Governor prior to the effective date of this Chapter, within one year prior to the date on which the member begins service on an authority. Each member of an authority must comply with the provisions of Chapter 13 of Title 8 of the 1976 Code of Laws including the requirement to file a statement of economic interests.\n\n(F) All executive orders of the Governor establishing any authority, commission, committee, or other entity relating to or concerned with the effects of the closure of a federal military installation shall expire on March 1, 1995. The Governor may issue no executive order relating to the purposes of this chapter except to create or to modify the membership of an authority as provided in Section 31-12-40.\n\n(G) Upon the creation of an authority under the provisions of this Chapter with regard to property scheduled for disposal which was also the subject of an executive order of the Governor issued prior to the effective date of this Act, the authority may, by its resolution, assume all or part of the responsibilities and activities of the entity previously authorized by the executive order.\n\n(H) The appointments made pursuant to subsections (B)(2), (B)(3) and (B)(4), subsections (C)(2), (C)(3) and (C)(4), and subsections (D)(1), (D)(2), (D)(3), (D)(4), (D)(5) and (D)(8) shall be subject to the advice and consent of the state Senate.\n\n(I) An authority also may be created by resolutions of municipalities and of counties eligible to make the majority of the appointments to an authority pursuant to subsections (B), (C) or (D), respectively.\n\n(J) A vacancy occurring during the recess of the Senate may be filled by an interim appointment by the appointing body or officer.\n\nThe Senate must be notified of the interim appointment, which shall be submitted no later than the end of the third week of its next ensuing regular session. The Senate may give or withhold its advice and consent to an appointment at any time after submission of the appointment, provided that if the Senate does not advise and consent to an appointment prior to Sine Die adjournment of that session, the office shall be vacant and the interim appointment shall not serve in holdover status notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary. In no event may the same individual be reappointed by the appointing body or officer until such time as the term for which the interim appointee would have served expires.\n\n(K) A vacancy due to the failure of the Senate to give advice and consent to any appointment may be filled while the Senate is in session by an interim appointment of a different person by the appointing body or officer until Sine Die adjournment of that session.\n\n(L) A vacancy due to the failure of the Senate to give advice and consent to any appointment may be filled during the recess of the Senate by an interim appointment by the appointing body or officer in the same manner as in Subsection (I).\n\nSection 31-12-50.

A member is subject to removal by an appointing body, with or without cause, upon a two-thirds vote of an appointing body. An appointing officer may remove a member of an authority with or without cause. A member shall receive, as the authority determines, reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses and other out of pocket expenses incurred in the discharge of the member's duties.\n\nSection 31-12-60.
