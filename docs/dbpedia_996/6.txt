Born to Solomon and Anna Stein Shore, immigrants from Russia, the young Frances Rose lived in Winchester, Tennessee. When she was two years old, she became infected with poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis), a disease that was unpredictable at the time and one of the only effective treatments was rest. His parents provided him with intensive care to quickly beat the disease. However, she continued to have a slight deformity of one of the feet, which caused a limp that physically did not bother her. Being a little girl, she loved singing and was encouraged by her mother but also by her father, who often took her to the store he was in, in order to entertain the guests with many songs improvised for the occasion. In 1924 the Shore family moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where the father opened a department store. Although shy because she was limping, Frances Rose was heavily involved in sports and was a cheerleader at Hume-Fogg High School.

She had a romantic relationship with actor Burt Reynolds.
