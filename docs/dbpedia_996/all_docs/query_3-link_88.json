        "text": "DAYTONA BEACH, FLA. – Jackie Chulya of the Columbia women's golf team has been named as the recipient of the 2016 Dinah Shore Trophy by LPGA officials on Wednesday morning on the Golf Channel as part of the NCAA Women's Golf Championship coverage. A native of Bangkok, Thailand, Chulya has put together an illustrious collegiate career both on the golf course and off with contributions to both her community at Columbia and back home in Thailand.\n\nAdministered by the LPGA Foundation, the Dinah Shore Trophy Award recognizes female collegiate golfers who excel in both academics (3.2 on a 4.0 scale) and athletics – playing in at least 50 percent of the team's scheduled events – while maintaining a 78.00 or less scoring average. In addition, nominees must demonstrate outstanding leadership skills and community service.\n\nAs a junior, Chuyla was unanimously named the 2016 Ivy League Player of the Year after finishing with the second-best scoring average in program history (74.95). She set the single-season program record for the most birdies made (62) and par-4 scoring (4.16), and was also named the co-winner of the William Terminello award, most valuable player of the Columbia women's golf team.\n\nChulya is not only is a major contributor to her golf team, but is heavily involved in Columbia's Student Athletic Advisory Committee (SAAC) and Thai Club. As vice president of Thai Club, she promotes Thai culture across the campus through food festivals, carnivals and study breaks. While excelling in golf and staying involved at school, Chulya maintains a 3.82 GPA.\n\nThe Dinah Shore Trophy Award is a joint effort between The LPGA Foundation, Friends of Golf (FOG) organization and the Kraft Nabisco Championship - one of the LPGA's four major championships and the largest contributor to the Dinah Shore Scholarship Fund. As part of the Dinah Shore Trophy Award, a $10,000 grant will be awarded to the Columbia University women's golf program.\n\nFormer winners of this prestigious award include: East Carolina University's Katie Kirk (2015), University of Arkansas' Emily Tubert (2014), Michigan State University alum Caroline Powers (2013), North Dakota State's Amy Anderson (2012), University of California graduate Pia Halbig (2011), University of Central Florida alum and current Symetra Tour member Katie Detlefsen (2010), Duke University grad and LPGA Tour player Amanda Blumenherst (2008, 2009), University of Arkansas alumna and 2012 Rolex LPGA Player of the Year Stacy Lewis (2007), and the University of South Carolina's Erica Battle (2006).\n\nThe LPGA Foundation announced the Dinah Shore Scholarship Fund in March of 1994 in honor of the late Dinah Shore, Vanderbilt University graduate and an honorary member of the LPGA and LPGA Tour Hall of Fame. The Dinah Shore Trophy Award has contributed more than $174,000 to women's collegiate golf programs including this year.\n\nAbout The Contributing Organizations\n\nFriends of Golf (FOG) is a fundraising organization founded and administered by Eddie Merrins, golf professional emeritus at Bel-Air Country Club in Beverly Hills, Calif. FOG contributes annually to collegiate, high school and junior golf programs throughout the country, and Dinah Shore was considered the “First Lady” of FOG.\n\nA part of the LPGA Tour since 1972, the Kraft Nabisco Championship (now the ANA Championship) was designated as a major in 1983. Three-time champion Amy Alcott began a winner's tradition of jumping into the lake at the 18th hole after her victory in 1991. The event was called the Colgate Dinah Shore from 1972-81 and the Nabisco Dinah Shore from 1982-99. Dinah Shore's legacy and heritage is preserved with the “Dinah Shore Walk of Champions” at the 18th hole at Mission Hills Country Club. In addition, a statue of Dinah Shore, serving as the walk's focal point, was created by noted sculptor George Montgomery, who was Shore's former husband.\n\nEstablished in 1991, The LPGA Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization committed to empowering and supporting girls and women through developmental and humanitarian golf initiatives. Key funding priorities include: junior golf programs; scholarships and the Dolores Hope LPGA Financial Assistance Initiative for those in the golf industry. The LPGA Foundation is supported by corporate and private donations, foundation grants and contributions from LPGA members.
