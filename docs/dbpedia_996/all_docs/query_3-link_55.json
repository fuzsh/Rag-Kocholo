Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.”\n\nIn 1980, former Israeli foreign minister Yigal Allon, who had played an important role in the Jewish state’s fight for independence, died at age 61.\n\nIn 1984, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau announced he was stepping down after more than 15 combined years in power.\n\nIn 1996, Daniel Green was convicted in Lumberton, North Carolina, of murdering James R. Jordan, the father of basketball star Michael Jordan, during a 1993 roadside holdup. (Green and an accomplice, Larry Martin Demery, were sentenced to life in prison.)\n\nIn 2012, Davy Jones the heartthrob singer who helped propel the made-for-TV rock band The Monkees to the top of the pop charts, died in Stuart, Florida at age 66.\n\nIn 2016, Justice Clarence Thomas broke 10 years of courtroom silence and posed questions during a Supreme Court oral argument dealing with gun rights, provoking gasps from the audience.\n\nToday’s Birthdays: Former astronaut Jack Lousma is 88. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople is 84. Motivational speaker Tony Robbins is 64. Legal affairs blogger Eugene Volokh is 56. Actor Antonio Sabato Jr. is 52.
