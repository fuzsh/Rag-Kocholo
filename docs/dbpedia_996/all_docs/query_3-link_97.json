        "text": "The stacked lineup for The Dinah Shore 2023 has arrived. The largest annual music festival for LGBTQ women in Palm Springs, CA announced that Princess Nokia, Doechii, and G Flip would be headlining the four-day festival slated for September 20-24.\n\nOther artists performing over the span of the weekend include Phem, Black Box, Keeana Kee, and Xana, with DJ sets by DJ Alex D, DJ China G, DJ Gracy D, DJ Les Ortiz, DJ Mo, and DJ Tatiana.\n\n“The Dinah is such an incredible experience every year, and we can’t wait to see you there in September to be a part of it!” the Dinah Shore’s official Instagram page says in a post. Another reads, “We love you Dinah fam, and we want you to know that you are always welcome, seen, heard and valid here.”\n\nTickets for the four-day festival are going fast, with two out of three available tiers already sold out. The mid-level tier for $299 is still available, and individual day tickets to Friday and Saturday’s main events are both $100.\n\nThe pool parties happening consecutively from Friday to Sunday range from $40-$80, and the opening and closing night parties are priced at $40 each. Bottle service packages are available on Friday and Saturday nights, costing $750.\n\nAlong with music offerings, the festival is set to feature performers who were the winners of their “Emerging Artists Contest,” featuring the breathy, ethereal songs of former professional athlete turned pop sensation Mariah Counts, and the “futuristic funk” of “Porno Groove” creator Oomy.\n\nAttendees can get down in the several bars and nightclubs hosting everything from mixers to more formal events throughout the weekend, get wild during fun in the sun at one of several pool parties, or both.\n\nThis year marks the 32nd year the world famous Dinah Shore Weekend has taken place, with the 2022 iteration seeing performers like Fletcher, Taylor Dayne, Haviah Mighty, and Zolita, among others.\n\nThe event will be taking place at the Margaritaville Resort Palms Springs, with tickets available at: thedinah.com."
