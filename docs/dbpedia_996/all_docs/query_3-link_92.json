        "text": "Today's highlight in history\n\nOn Feb. 29, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson's National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, also known as the Kerner Commission, warned that racism was causing America to move 'toward two societies, one black, one white — separate and unequal.'\n\nOn this date\n\nIn 1504, Christopher Columbus, stranded in Jamaica during his fourth voyage to the West, used a correctly predicted lunar eclipse to frighten hostile natives into providing food for his crew.\n\nIn 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed a seven-member commission to facilitate completion of the Panama Canal.\n\nIn 1916, singer, actress and TV personality Dinah Shore was born Frances Rose Shore in Winchester, Tenn. (Shore, who claimed March 1, 1917, as her birth date, died in 1994 just days before she would have turned 78.)\n\nIn 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a second Neutrality Act as he appealed to American businesses not to increase exports to belligerents.\n\nIn 1940, 'Gone With the Wind' won eight Academy Awards, including best picture of 1939; Hattie McDaniel won for best supporting actress, the first black performer to win an Oscar.\n\nIn 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced he would seek a second term of office.\n\nIn 1960, the first Playboy Club, featuring waitresses clad in 'bunny' outfits, opened in Chicago.\n\nTwelve years ago (2004): 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' won a record-tying 11 Academy Awards, including best picture; Sean Penn took the best-actor prize for 'Mystic River' and Charlize Theron won best actress for 'Monster.'\n\nEight years ago (2008): Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama accused rival Hillary Clinton of trying to 'play on people's fears to scare up votes' with a TV ad showing sleeping children and asking who would be more qualified to answer a national security emergency call at 3 a.m.\n\nFour years ago (2012): Davy Jones, 66, the heartthrob singer who helped propel the made-for-TV rock band The Monkees to the top of the pop charts, died in Stuart, Fla."
