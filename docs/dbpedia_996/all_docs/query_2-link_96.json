        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - Dinah Shore, who delighted radio\n\nand television audiences over decades with her skilled singing\n\nand Southern charm, died Thursday. She was 76.\n\nShore, who was recently diagnosed with cancer, died at her\n\nhome here after a short illness, said publicist Connie Stone.\n\nShore's grown children and ex-husband, movie Western star\n\nGeorge Montgomery, were with her when she died, she said.\n\nHer television career spanned the 1950s to the early 1990s,\n\nwhen she had a half-hour talk show, \"A Conversation with\n\nDinah,\" on The Nashville Network.\n\nShe started in 1951 with \"The Dinah Shore Show,\" a live,\n\n15-minute musical show.\n\nThe more elaborate \"The Dinah Shore Chevy Show\" premiered\n\nin 1956 and ran until 1963. Her singing of the jingle, \"See\n\nthe USA in Your Chevrolet,\" and signing off with a big\n\nkiss to the audience became trademarks.\n\nFrom 1974-79 she was in \"Dinah,\" from 1970-74 in \"Dinah's\n\nPlace,\" and from 1979 to 1984, \"Dinah and Friends.\"\n\nReferring to the TV camera, she said in a 1989 Associated\n\nPress interview: \"I don't know how to be afraid of that\n\nold red eye. It's one person to me. I don't visualize large\n\nnumbers of people out there. I'm comfortable with it.\"\n\nPrior to going into television, she was a singing star on\n\nradio known for such hits as \"I'll Walk Alone\" and \"The\n\nAnniversary Song.\"\n\nShe occasionally appeared in films in the 1940s, including\n\n\"Follow the Boys\" and \"Fun and Fancy Free.\"\n\nShe was born Frances Rose Shore on March 1, 1917, in Winchester,\n\nTenn.\n\nA graduate of Vanderbilt University, she began her broadcast\n\nsinging career in 1938 on New York's WNEW, joining the NBC\n\nnetwork later that year and signing a contract with RCA\n\nVictor in 1940. A year later she joined Eddie Cantor's radio\n\nprogram; by 1943 she was starring in her own radio program,\n\nsponsored by General Foods.\n\nMore recently, her \"A Conversation With Dinah\" on The\n\nNashville Network ran from August 1989 to March 1991 as\n\na weekly show. She then did specials for TNN, including\n\none in 1991 in which she interviewed ex-beau Burt Reynolds.\n\nShe appeared on a TNN tribute show to Eddy Arnold in May\n\n1992.\n\nShe married Montgomery in 1943, and had two children, Melissa\n\nAnn Hime, born in 1948, and John David Montgomery, born\n\nin 1954. She divorced Montgomery in 1962. A second marriage\n\nto Maurice F. Smith in 1963 lasted only a year.\n\nFor more than two decades she had played host to the Dinah\n\nShore Classic golf tournament in the Palm Springs area.\n\nShe was also a champion of animal rights.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
