        "text": "Every four years we add Feb. 29 to the calendar. What's also referred to as leap day, it’s so our calendar better matches up with Earth’s orbit of 365.2422 days.\n\nSince Feb. 29 doesn’t occur every year, that can sort of mess up birthdays and anniversaries.\n\nThink of poor Frederic from Gilbert & Sullivan’s opera “The Pirates of Penzance.\" He was indentured to pirates until his 21st birthday but was born Feb. 29, so he was stuck with them for 84 years!\n\nPeople born on a leap day seem to celebrate their birthdays on Feb. 28 most years. Such as rapper Ja Rule, who was born Feb. 29, 1976. But in 2020, the last time his actual birthday rolled around, he posted on Twitter/X: “Hey everyone tomorrow is my REAL BIRTHDAY!!! I haven’t had one in 4 YEARS... to my Leap year gang it our time!!!”\n\nOf course, plenty of historic events have happened on that date as well. Here are some notable events to have occurred on Feb. 29.\n\n1504 – Christopher Columbus predicted eclipse\n\nExplorer Christopher Columbus and his crew were stranded in Jamaica and relying on assistance from the native Arawak tribe. But the natives grew weary of the Spaniards after six months. Threatened with starvation, Columbus used the prediction of a total lunar eclipse that would be visible on Feb. 29, 1504, to intimidate the Arawak chief into continuing to provide food for his hungry men.\n\nAuthors have adopted this trope in several stories, including “King Solomon’s Mines” by H. Rider Haggard and “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court” by Mark Twain.\n\n1692 – Warrants issued in Salem witch trials\n\nHysteria overcame the village of Salem in colonial Massachusetts in February 1692, when teenage girls accused several people of practicing witchcraft. The first warrants for the arrest of Sarah Good, Sarah Osbourne and Tituba were issued on Feb. 29.\n\nGood was hanged and Osbourne died in jail. Tituba, an enslaved Native American woman, was imprisoned, then sold to an English settler.\n\n1940 – Hattie McDaniel became the first Black actor to win an Oscar\n\nThe Academy Awards ceremony for 1939 was held on Feb. 29, 1940. “Gone with the Wind” won eight Oscars, including best picture.\n\nHattie McDaniel, who won best actress in a supporting role for the film, became the first Black actor to win an Academy Award. It would be 24 years before another Black actor won an Oscar (Sidney Poitier won best actor for 1963’s “Lilies of the Field”).\n\n1960 – ‘Family Circus’ and Playboy Club debuted\n\nIn an ironic twist, two fixtures on the opposite ends of the American pop culture spectrum first appeared on Feb. 29, 1960.\n\nBil Keane’s wholesome comic strip, “The Family Circus,” debuted in newspapers that day. The single-panel cartoon appeared in nearly 1,500 newspapers by the 1990s.\n\nOn the flip side, the first Playboy Club, owned by Playboy magazine publisher Hugh Hefner, opened in Chicago that night. The private club was noted for the Playboy Bunny waitresses wearing revealing outfits with bunny ears, bow ties and cottontails.\n\n1968 – The Beatles’ ‘Sgt. Pepper’ won album of the year\n\nThe Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” one of the most famous records of all time, became the first rock album to be named Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards on Feb. 29, 1968.\n\nThe concept album – and its just-as-famous cover – was a defining part of the Summer of Love and the 1960s’ evolving music scene. The Beatles broke up in 1970, but their music endures more than 50 years later.\n\n1972 – Hank Aaron got paid\n\nBaseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron is celebrated as the home run king for eclipsing Babe Ruth’s career record of 714 in 1974. But the Atlanta Braves slugger broke another record on Feb. 29, 1972, when he became the first MLB player to be paid a $200,000 average annual salary. (That’s about $1.5 million today.)\n\nTo put that in perspective, Shohei Ohtani just signed a 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers for $700 million.\n\n2000 – Sparky Anderson elected to baseball Hall of Fame\n\nSpeaking of baseball: On Feb. 29, 2000, former Cincinnati Reds manager Sparky Anderson and 19th-century Reds second baseman Bid McPhee were chosen by the veterans committee to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Anderson was the manager of the Big Red Machine in the 1970s, which won back-to-back World Series in 1975-1976. McPhee was a barehanded fielder and the best defensive player of his era.\n\nThe two joined two other Reds Hall of Famers that year. The election of Tony Pérez, the clutch first baseman of the Big Red Machine, and broadcaster Marty Brennaman were announced earlier, giving the class of 2000 a decidedly Red tint.\n\n2004 – ‘Lord of the Rings’ won 11 Oscars\n\nAt the Academy Awards ceremony on Feb. 29, 2004, “Lord of the Rings: Return of the King” tied the record for most Oscars with 11, including Best Picture and Best Director for Peter Jackson. The finale of the adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic trilogy was the first fantasy film to win the top Academy Award.\n\n2012 – Davy Jones of The Monkees died\n\nThe Monkees’ heartthrob Davy Jones, best known for singing “Daydream Believer,” died of a heart attack on Feb. 29, 2012, at age 66.\n\nThe British-born singer was one of four actor-musicians hired to portray a pop rock band in the Emmy Award-winning NBC television series “The Monkees” in 1966. But to the delight of fans and the consternation of rock critics, the fictional band became a real band that scored three chart-topping singles and four No. 1 albums, selling 75 million records worldwide.\n\nWhat famous people were born on Feb. 29?\n\nJa Rule, rapper (born 1976).\n\nAntonio Sabato Jr., actor and model (1972).\n\nTony Robbins, motivational speaker (1960).\n\nDinah Shore, actor (1916-1994).\n\nJimmy Dorsey, bandleader (1904-1957).\n\nTake this quiz to test your knowledge of Cincinnati history"
