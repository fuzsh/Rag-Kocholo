        "text": "Some celebrities only get to celebrate their birthday once every four years.\n\nSeveral famous figures were welcomed into the world on February 29, including rapper Ja Rule. “My @foxtailatsls residency kick [sic] off crazy wit [sic] my 10th bday party lol,” he quipped via Instagram in February 2016 while celebrating turning 40.\n\nTony Robbins went big for his 60th birthday, his 15th birthday in leap years, by throwing a massive party and benefit concert at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. He donated 100 percent of the $18 million that the event raised to Operation Underground Railroad, a nonprofit organization that aims to eradicate child sex trafficking.\n\n“Tony believes that the secret to living is giving,” the motivational speaker’s wife, Sage Robbins, said in a statement in 2020. “He has devoted his life to helping people realize their passions and change their circumstances. I cannot think of a better way to celebrate this milestone birthday than to support his mission and commitment to O.U.R., with the goal of saving thousands more children from some of the worst conditions on Earth.”\n\nScroll down to see stars who were born on February 29:"
