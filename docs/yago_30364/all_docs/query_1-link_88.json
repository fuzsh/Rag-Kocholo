        "text": "TBS is going into the Steve Carell business.\n\nThe Turner-owned cable network has ordered a comedy pilot written and executive produced by The Office alum and his wife, Nancy Carell, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nThe couple created and will write and executive produce Tribeca, a satirical look at a police procedural anchored by Angie Tribeca, a 10-year veteran of the LAPD’s elite RHCU — Really Heinous Crimes Unit. The single-camera comedy explores an eccentric but brilliant group of people who investigate crime, reveal way too much personal information, and refuse to rest until justice has been served … sort of. These dedicated men and women are more than counter-intuitive; they are nonintuitive. Carell will direct the pilot, which hails from his Carousel Productions banner.\n\nPHOTOS: Faces of Fall TV 2013\n\nFor TBS, the comedy joins fellow pilots Do It Yourself starring Bill Engvall and the untitled half-hour from Josh Heald (Hot Tub Time Machine, Conan).Should Tribeca move to series, it would join a roster that includes Bill Lawrence‘s upcoming comedy Ground Floor, the 10th season of American Dad, Cougar Town, Sullivan & Son, Men at Work and a roster of unscripted fare.\n\nTribeca comes as Carousel continues its push into television. The banner recently set up unscripted celebrity competition series Slide Show at Fox, with Shine America on board to produce.\n\nFor her part, Nancy Carell is a Saturday Night Live alum whose credits also include The Goode Family, The Office and roles in Bridesmaids and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, among others.\n\nSteve Carell is repped by WME."
