Those familiar with Saturday Night Live, The Daily Show , and The Office would have definitely noticed Nancy Carell onscreen. In addition to being an actress, Nancy is also a comedian and writer. She is the wife of Steve Carell, a renowned American actor, comedian and television personality. Let yourself be carried further into the world of Nancy. Here is a look at her bio, number of children, height and other facts.\n\nNancy Carell – Bio and Age\n\nNancy Ellen Carell, née Walls, was born on July 19, 1966, in Cohasset, Massachusetts, United States, to Robert and Carol Walls. She was raised in Cohasset and attended Cohasset High School before attending Boston College. During her stay, she played a major role in my mother ‘s Fleabag school improv drama troupe before graduating from college in 1988.\n\nNancy Carell’s role with her college’s impromptu drama troupe showed just how infatuated she was with acting. The role was also pivotal in her decision to carve out a niche for herself in the showbiz world. Not long after graduating, her career as a comedian took off on Chicago ‘s Second City . Her impressive artistry in the troupe earned her a spot on the Saturday Night Live cast in the mid-’90s (1995-1996). Her near-perfect portrayal of the character Bobbie Battista, a CNN news anchor on SNL , left a lasting impression on many and inadvertently thrust them into the limelight.\n\nHer fame grew more after she appeared as a correspondent on The Daily Show from 1999 to 2002, where she reigned over ninety episodes on the show. Alongside this, Nancy Carell has also had a few voiceover roles, some of which include her portrayal of Helen Goode in The Goode Family , an animated series created by Mike Judge. Moreso, she guest-starred in seven episodes of the American TV sitcom The Office as Carol Stills, her husband’s love interest. Steve portrayed Michael Scott on the sitcom.\n\nWhile she did well in television series and comedy shows, she also landed roles in movies. In 2003, she portrayed the character of flight attendant Patty in the comedy film Anger Management . Her other films include Bridesmaids (2011) and Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012)."
