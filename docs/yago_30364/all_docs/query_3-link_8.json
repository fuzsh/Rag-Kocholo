        "text": "Steve Carell and his wife Nancy Carell stepped out for a red carpet date night at a Cannes Film Festival screening on Tuesday (23 May).\n\nThe couple were attending the screening of the new Wes Anderson film Asteroid City, starring big names including Tom Hanks and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nFollowing suit with most of the male guests of the evening, Steve cut a dapper figure in a classic black tuxedo for the occasion.\n\nNancy, on the other hand, opted for a stunning long sleeve dress in bright red, featuring sculpting draped detail. She wore her shoulder length hair in soft waves, adding an air of old school Hollywood glamour to her chic look.\n\nFans of the US Office may recognise Nancy Carell from when she starred opposite Steve's famous Micheal Scott character. Nancy played realtor Carol who sold Micheal his condo in the early years of the show, before becoming his girlfriend.\n\nIn the series, Steve's character unsuccessfully proposes on the couple's fourth date, but in the real world the couple have now been happily married since 1995 and have two children together.\n\nThe pair weren't the only happy couple on the red carpet for Asteroid City in Cannes on Tuesday, as Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson walked the red carpet together with Brian Cranston and his wife Robin Dearden. The group posed together for the papparazzi and waved together as they headed to the screening.\n\nTom and Rita have now been married for 35 years, celebrating their milestone anniversary last month.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
