        "text": "From Nevada to the Occidental College\n\nWhen Janice Rude enrolled in university in 1960, she never thought she would meet the love of her life there. She was raised in Reno, Nevada, and was brought up to be a hard worker.\n\nJanice remembers her father being strict and tough at times; however, he always supported her desire for education. She registered at Occidental College, where her life would change forever.\n\nFrom Home to the Cafeteria\n\nOccidental College, located in Los Angeles, almost became an all-boys school after its establishment in 1887. Janice and Prentiss were lucky this never happened, or they would have never met and fallen in love. As soon as school started, Janice started to work at the local cafeteria to pay her tuition.\n\nShe would wake up at the crack of dawn and serve the thousands of students around. The athlete team were regulars. They would visit the cafeteria early in the morning before practice. Janice knew them all; however, there was one who caught her eye more than anyone else.\n\nThe Willsons\n\nPrentiss Willson came from a family of intellectuals. They thought highly of Prentiss and believed he would eventually turn to a great position and have a spectacular and respected career.\n\nHe arrived at Occidental College in 1961, one year after Janice, and joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity as expected from him. Kappa Sigma was a family tradition that had to be preserved.\n\nCrumbly Cereal Station\n\nIt was a bright skyed morning, and Janice just arrived at school as every other morning. Like always, she entered the cafeteria from the back entrance and checked where she was positioned that day. Cereal station. Her favorite.\n\nAs she approached the counter, she spotted a young man that was waiting for service. Her heart began racing, her tongue became dry, and for a moment there, she stopped breathing.\n\nAn Early Start\n\nThat same morning, Prentiss wanted to get an early start to the day. He was planning on having a good run before his classes started and wanted to get his blood going and his mind flowing.\n\nIn the cafeteria, he helped himself to some eggs, bread, and bacon. The place was waking up, other students began coming through the wide heavy cafeteria doors, and then, as if the world froze, their eyes met.\n\nWhere It All Began\n\nTime had stopped. Janice and Prentiss looked deep into each other's eyes and were oblivious to all that was happening around them. Janice was stunningly beautiful, and Prentiss was the most handsome guy around.\n\nJanice felt her cheeks turning into a darker shade of red while Prentiss almost lost his breath, dazzled by her glamour. He couldn't get his eyes off her, however, she shifted her focus to the food tray he was holding. She felt too uncomfortable looking him in the eye.\n\nAlways First in Line\n\nThe next morning, and the ones to follow, Prentiss made an effort in waking up early and being the first in line. He wasn't going to let any other athlete get a hold of Janice's attention.\n\nWhenever their eyes crossed, Janice became insecure and immediately turned away. She thought Prentiss was gorgeous but didn't want him to realize that. Until one day...\n\nIce Breaking\n\nAs the days passed and they met each other's eyes more frequently, Janice became more and more confident, and eventually, she was able to hold her head high and look him straight forward. She was even able to put on a small smile whenever he approached.\n\nOne morning, Prentiss walked into the cafeteria, more handsome than ever. He was tall and had such an elegant presence. Janice just stood there and stared, not knowing what a significant role this man would have in her life.\n\nIt Was Now or Never\n\nThat same morning, Prentiss felt it was time. He knew he had to approach her but didn't know how. Whenever he saw her standing behind the cereal bowls in the cafeteria, her delicate and soft smile melted his heart.\n\nHe managed to somehow gather his courage and say \"hi\" in a quiet and shy manner. Janice blushed, and she couldn't do anything but look away.\n\nHer First Name\n\nThree weeks later, Prentiss discovered her name. Janice knew his name all along as she heard it before from the Kappa Sigma. She found herself wandering in the cafeteria all morning, memorizing his name and drifting up to higher skies.\n\nPrentiss couldn't stop thinking about her, and now that he knew her name, he tried to get as much information about her as he could. Little did he know that, eventually, this young lady would turn his world around.\n\nOne Year Ahead\n\nThe fact that Janice was one year older than Prentiss didn't stop him from believing he had a chance with her. All he saw was a beautiful girl, and he wanted to get to know her better.\n\nEvery day at 6 am, he would arrive at the cafeteria, hoping for a short exchange of words with her and wishing for the best start to the day. And the day was indeed great.\n\nThanksgiving Break\n\nThanksgiving break was just around the corner. Most students were preparing to go back home for a short break, however, Prentiss was nowhere to be found. He didn't show up at the cafeteria that morning as he usually did.\n\nAlthough they had progressed and managed to hold a short conversation every now and then, and even though they hadn't met outside of the cafeteria walls, when she realized he wasn't showing up, she was concerned.\n\nPrentiss' Address\n\nJanice was upset, heartbroken, and disappointed, but as she was making her way through the golden autumn leaves, she said to herself that she wouldn't let this get to her. There was a reason for him just disappearing, and she was about to find out what it was.\n\nAfter asking around, she learned that he had already gone home for his Thanksgiving break. However, one of Prentiss's fraternity brothers willingly gave Janice his address - but the journey wouldn't be quick.\n\nThree Hours on the Road\n\nSanta Maria seemed to be on the other side of the world. Traveling there from Los Angeles would mean a 150 miles journey, all by herself. Couldn't Prentiss' parents live closer?\n\nThe road was unfamiliar, and the radio turned into her voyage companion. Arriving at someone's house without any notice was unheard of; however, she felt it was the thing she had to do. Three hours later, she arrived at the house and was about to knock on the door.\n\nBig House on the Prairie\n\nPrentiss' parents lived in an old-fashioned ranch, bigger than any other house Janice ever knew. It was surrounded by fields, and it had a lovely porch right at the front.\n\nPrentiss curled up on the couch and sunk into the book he was reading. All he was anticipating was a Thanksgiving home-cooked meal.\n\nEarly Regrets\n\nJanice wasn't aware of this, but Prentiss regretted the fact that he never got a chance to say goodbye to her before leaving on his break. He felt bad, however, there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nJust as those thoughts were going through his head, there was a knock on the door. He got up and approached the door, unaware of who was on the other side.\n\nSurprise Surprise\n\nAt one point, Janice wanted to turn back as she felt awkward. However, just as she was about to leave, the footsteps she heard had already reached the door.\n\nPrentiss couldn't get the shocked expression off his face. He was stunned. The last person he was expecting to see at his doorstep was beautiful Janice.\n\nThanksgiving Gift\n\nJanice said she was sorry for arriving unannounced, but Prentiss didn't care as the girl he was dreaming about, the stunning cafeteria Janice, came to see him purely because she missed him. He was overwhelmed.\n\nWith no hesitation, he walked her in and introduced her to his mother and father. Prentiss recalled that the bonding with his mother was immediate, and the two instantly clicked.\n\nThe New Couple on Campus\n\nThe four of them had a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner together, and then it was time for Janice to return to college for the rest of the break. From that day onwards, things were not the same on campus.\n\nThey would rarely be seen not holding hands, strolling around like Cinderella and Prince Charming. Their eyes sparkled and shone, and everyone knew this was meant to be. What was the future holding for these two? Only time would tell.\n\nEarly Proposal\n\nJust as December kicked in and before Christmas arrived, Prentiss asked Janice to marry him. It might have seemed too fast, but Prentiss felt it was the right thing to do. He knew Janice was his girl from the moment he laid eyes on her.\n\nThe proposal was planned to be romantic and special, and with the help of his friends, Prentiss managed to pull off an evening to remember. Life couldn't get better. However, things were about to change.\n\nMadly in Love\n\nJanice didn't take her time and immediately answered, \"yes.\" There was no hesitation, and Prentiss placed the golden band with the glittering diamond rock on her finger. They were young and in love and had their whole life in front of them.\n\nWhile they were planning their wedding and the rest of their lives, they weren't aware that soon they would be fighting for their existence and for their love.\n\nPaper Announcement\n\nPrentiss' fraternity brothers and Janice's sorority sisters were all overwhelmed. The local newspaper announcement regarding the engagement caught them by surprise, but they were all happy and delighted for the two.\n\nJanice's friends were going on and on over the ring while the guys were thrilled by the way they revealed the news. One thing was missing from the announcement, and that was the planned wedding date.\n\nTrouble Ahead\n\nNot everyone was so happy over the big news. Janice's father was a simple middle-class, blue-collar worker, and he had an issue with Prentiss' intellectual upper-class parents.\n\nIt wasn't only that he disapproved of the match, but he also told Janice that if she didn't break up with Prentiss, he would stop paying her tuition fees. He was not going to allow this to happen. Janice's mother thought otherwise.\n\nA little Too Far\n\nJanice's mother wanted to help Janice. She understood that her daughter was in love and that love was stronger than anything else. Things were going to go a little too far.\n\nShe considered remortgaging their house so she could pay for Janice's tuition fee. She (Janice's mother) wanted to show Janice's father that there was no room for threats and that Prentiss and Janice were going to get married.\n\nDecision Time\n\nJanice feared leaving school. Not only education was very important for her, but she was also terrified that Prentiss would not think as highly of her if she dropped out of school.\n\nAdding on to that, she was worried that Prentiss' eyes would begin to wander off until eventually getting caught by some other girl. Some other girl with a degree.\n\nWhat Should She Do?\n\nUnsurprisingly, Prentiss supported Janice. He assured her that her dropping out of college would mean nothing to him, and, in his eyes, she didn't have to have a degree. Even his mother was being supportive and suggested they elope.\n\nIt was January and, for Janice, it was decision time. Does she break up with Prentiss and finish school or does she drop out and live happily ever after with the man she loves?\n\nTwo Broken Hearts\n\nThe winter couldn't have been colder. Heartbroken, Janice gave back to Prentiss the beautiful engagement ring he gave her. He was devastated and didn't believe his wounded heart could ever be repaired.\n\nThe days flew by, graduation was on their doorstep, and instead of becoming a world-famous biologist like she always wanted, Janice found herself running her family's business in Reno, Nevada.\n\nIt's a New Life\n\nPrentiss eventually picked himself up and healed his broken heart. After Occidental College, the gates of Harvard were calling, and he began studying law. He would then become one of the San Francisco Bay area's most successful tax attorneys.\n\nHe married his next girlfriend; however, something inside wouldn't set Janice free, as he never truly got over her. If only he would have known that life's path would bring the two back together again.\n\nMoving On\n\nAlthough Janice wasn't involved in the profession she wanted, she managed to become very successful and achieved great things by running the family business. She became an honorary member of the American Diving Association’s Hall of Fame. She, too, married her next love in life.\n\nFunny enough, neither of the marriages worked out, and both Prentiss and Janice got divorced. When it's meant to be, no other will do. They were fortunate to meet their soul mates early in life; however, not fortunate enough to stop life's barriers from calling the verdict.\n\nTogether in Pain\n\nAs if the two were mystically connected, they both lost their dear mother at about the same time, and unplanned, they were both grieving their loss. This loss would soon bring them back together.\n\nWhile each was going through their mother's possession, they came across something that would eventually reunite them and end a five-decade period of being apart.\n\nHidden Treasures\n\nPrentiss was barely over grieving his mother. Not completely healed from the breakup with Janice that happened all those years ago, he suddenly pulled out an old piece of newspaper. It was yellow and flakey but was the most wonderful thing he could find - a memory of the happiest time of his life.\n\nWhen Janice was going through her late mother's folders, she too found the same piece of old newspaper announcing her engagement to Prentiss all those years ago. She felt her heart pinch, and she was overwhelmed by the findings. Prentiss was eager to try and contact Janice, but was Janice keen on meeting up with Prentiss after all those years?\n\nAs If They Never Parted\n\nPrentiss swallowed his fear and reached out. Janice couldn't believe it. In no time, they agreed to meet - and something about this just felt right, for the both of them. San Francisco mainstay, Cliff House, was where the two planned to meet. It was on June 20th, 2010, almost fifty years after they broke each other's hearts. Their eyes met, and the world froze.\n\nIt was like the old days in the cafeteria when they would stare at one another, not aware of what was going on around them. It was as if they were falling in love all over again.\n\nHolding On to the Past\n\nJanice's mother knew it, and Prentiss' mother knew it too. They belonged to each other. For what other reason would they keep that old newspaper announcement? Deep inside, Janice and Prentiss knew it too.\n\nA little over six months and the couple were engaged again. They had to complete this chapter in their lives. Two lost souls had finally found each other, and they couldn't ask for more.\n\nBack to the Future\n\nThey both wanted to honor their late mothers, so they used the old announcements as part of their new engagement notice in the papers. They even married at the same place they initially intended to, for the sake of the good old days.\n\nOld college friends attended their big day, and the excitement and emotions were poring all over. This was the greatest day of their lives, and they were waiting for it for almost half a century.\n\nThe Final Finale\n\nThe stars shone on Janice and Prentiss, and finally, the two could exchange their vows and commit to one another forever. This time, their love would last for life as there were no barriers in their way.\n\nWhen two people know they are meant to be together and are lucky enough to find their soulmate early in life. Nothing can beat them, as there is no stronger power than one person's will, and there is no stronger power than the power of love.\n\nJanice and Prentiss had their love story spread over the course of more than half a century, which is pretty darn impressive. Many couples don't last that long, and the statistics are even lower when it comes to Hollywood. However, there are still some celebrity couples who break that mold. Read on to learn more about them.\n\nNow, we’re not saying true love doesn’t exist, but couples that have been (happily) married for years on is becoming rarer than ever, particularly when it comes to celebrity couples. But we've listed a few unicorns for ya', who’ve proven that true love does to exist, even in the digital age. Let’s take a look at these admirable famous couples whose relationships have us hashtagging them as #goalz.\n\nCyndi Lauper and David Thornton – Together Since 1991\n\nFor the singer of “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun”, you kind of wouldn’t expect Cyndi Lauper to be going with one guy for most of her life, right? Well, it seems Ms. Lauper is precisely the opposite and has remained with her partner in crime David Thornton for a staggering 28 years! Despite the fact that Hollywood is rife with lawsuits and divorce proceedings, these two prove that relationships in Tinseltown can, in fact, survive, and even thrive.\n\nWe think it’s owing to the fact that when the pair met, Cyndi was at her worst, going through a bit of a rough patch with her relationships. At the time she had been dating her manager on and off, but it seemed that Dave Wolff was causing her more drama than happiness. Fast forward, and Thornton and Lauper met, became friends, and before they knew it tied the knot in 1991. The rest is happy history.\n\nSam Elliott and Katharine Ross – Together Since 1984\n\nNot many gentlemen have a voice that naturally registers as low as Sam Elliott’s. A legend in his own right, Elliott recently starred alongside Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in the remake of the classic, tragic love story, 'A Star is Born'. Donning a cowboy hat and sporting a mean mustache, Elliott gave a performance that critics loved.\n\nAs for his personal life, it’s no secret that family is key to Elliott, and that’s exampled in his 35-year-long marriage to Katharine Ross. The pair met on set in 1978 while shooting 'The Legacy'. After six years, the pair tied the knot and have since gone on to have two children together. Happily ever after. We love it.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi – Together Since 2004\n\nSince Oprah bowed out, Ellen DeGeneres took the top spot on the podium of America’s most popular and beloved talk show hosts. The charismatic and charming DeGeneres didn’t have the smoothest transition in coming out as gay, but she also helped to raise awareness and the profile of the LGBTQ community. With her Australian wife Portia De Rossi by her side, the pair are enjoying the spoils of their success together.\n\nRecently, rumors came about their divorce, to which De Rossi reacted: “The divorce rumors came and then we really knew the perceptions had changed,” Portia explained. “I’m not kidding. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when that started happening I thought, ‘Oh, now we’re finally accepted.’ We get the same problems as every celebrity couple.” You go, girls!\n\nWill Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith – Together Since 1995\n\nBox office hit after box office hit, Smith has starred in films like 'Men in Black', 'Bad Boys', 'The Pursuit of Happyness', 'Independence Day', and most recently, the live-action remake of Disney’s classic 'Aladdin'. Instantly recognizable with his charm and wit, he’s a legend. But what we love most is that the guy we see on the screen is just a super chill, nice dude in real life.\n\nA doting dad and a devoted partner to his wife of 23 years, Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith is something of a role model. You might have seen Jada in 'Magic Mike XL' and she does a very good job! Anyway, 23 years later, they’re killing it – here’s to 23 more!\n\nTim McGraw and Faith Hill – Together Since 1996\n\nA power couple on the country music scene, there aren’t many marriages as strong as Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's. The extremely talented, gorgeous couple remain the king and queen of Nashville, with their three daughters perhaps treading in their footsteps. The couple has been married for 22 years and put it down to a strong friendship that has been the basis of a stronger marriage.\n\nTheir love and commitment to one another is pretty astounding, especially given how tough it can be in the limelight. Fun fact: did you know they were each engaged to their respective partners when they met, before deciding to give their relationships up and take the plunge? And look where it got them!\n\nElton John and David Furnish – Together Since 1993\n\n“How wonderful life is now you’re in the world” – a line we’re sure Furnish has heard many, many times from his Rockstar husband, Sir Elton John. The pair met 25 years ago, in 1993, and since then figured they were just meant to be!\n\nDespite the fact that, back in the 90s, same-sex marriage was frowned upon, the pair still fought for their love and stuck together. They did, however, take the plunge once it was legalized, and are blissfully married to this day.\n\nBeyoncé and Jay Z – Together Since 2008\n\nQueen Bey and Jay Z married in April 2008, and have since gone on to become one of the richest couples in the world. With a net worth amounting to over 1.2 billion, it’s no wonder they could afford to buy their precious daughter, Blue Ivy, twins Rumi and Sure, a mini gold Mercedes Benz car.\n\nThey seemed to have a dream relationship, but you never really know what happens behind closed doors.\n\nTom Selleck and Jillie Mack – Together Since 1987\n\nAt 38, single, Selleck was feeling a bit lonesome. And what do we do when we’re lonely? We take ourselves out on a date! For Selleck, it was to see 'Cats', a show that he loved so much he kept going back for more. But there was a reason for his fascination with the musical – actress, dancer Jillie Mack starred in it! The pair went for dinner and the rest is history – 32 years of history, to be exact.\n\nShe was then seen at every event Selleck was invited to – red carpets, awards shows, and ceremonies - she was “his girl.” The two tied the knot in 1987, welcoming their bundle of joy, Hannah, into the world just a year later, at which point Selleck quit 'Magnum P.I' to focus on his family.\n\nSacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher –Together Since 2010\n\nWhether you know him as Ali G, Borat or Bruno, Sacha Baron Cohen has to be one of the funniest (but also one of the most controversial) men in Hollywood. And by his side, an equally funny and stunning wife, Australian actress Isla Fisher. Meeting back in 2002, the pair first laid eyes on one another in Sydney. What seemed to be love, at first sight, saw the pair walking down the aisle two years later in a Jewish ceremony in Paris.\n\nIsla converted to Judaism for her man, and now they have three children together, splitting their time between London and LA. What a life, right? We absolutely loved Isla Fisher opposite Gal Gadot and Zach Galifianakis in 'Keeping Up with the Joneses' (even if it bombed slightly). But we’re here to celebrate Isla and Sacha’s love. And many years more.\n\nJulia Roberts and Daniel Moder – Together Since 2002\n\nJulia Roberts is one of those Hollywood actresses who’s going to be looked back on as one of the greats. Rising to fame in 'Pretty Woman', opposite the very suave and charming Richard Gere, it was the start of a long and successful career in Hollywood. Her smile won over the hearts of Americans and the world, but the man who wakes up to it almost every morning is cinematographer Daniel Moder.\n\nDespite a rocky start to love and dating, Roberts found Moder and hasn’t had a reason to look back since. We think the reason they’ve remained strong in their marriage is that they choose to say out of the limelight and keep their private life, well, private.\n\nOprah Winfrey and Stedman Graham – Together Since 1986\n\nThe ultimate inspiration for any female with a dream, it seems that Oprah Winfrey has also nailed it when it comes to her love life. The magnanimous talk-show host and multi-billionaire knows a thing or two about life and relationships, and while she’s not married her long-term partner Stedman Graham, she's still managed to keep a steady relationship for 32 years!\n\nGraham himself is a businessman, author, and podcaster. While many men would shy away from a woman so powerful and wealthy, Graham has been in for the long haul. The pair were acquainted in 1986 and have been by each other’s sides since then.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer and David E. Kelley – Together Since 1993\n\nSet up on a blind date back in 1993, Michelle Pfeiffer had no idea she’d be meeting the man she was going to marry. After 25 years of marriage, Pfeiffer claims that TV writer David E. Kelley makes her feel “like the luckiest girl in the room!” Pfeiffer says that “Life is made up of the choices and I’ve not always made good choices but I know I picked the right man.” Well, that’s quite the compliment!\n\nWithin 10 months, the pair were saying “I do”, much to people’s surprise. But people were wrong, and while they speculated it wouldn’t last, we think 25 years is enough proof, don't you?\n\nJeff Bridges and Susan Geston Bridges – Together Since 1977\n\nJeff Bridges is an esteemed Hollywood hard-hitter, doing so not without the support and love of his beautiful wife, Susan Geston. Falling for Susan back in 1975, Bridges fondly remembers meeting Geston on the set of 'Rancho Deluxe'. The Montana beauty bewitched Bridges' body and soul – he knew as soon as he laid eyes on her that she was the one.\n\nThe pair wed less than two years later, and have remained married for over four decades, sharing three daughters with lots of laughs and love on the way.\n\nRon and Cheryl Howard – Together Since 1975\n\nThe prolific Hollywood director Ron Howard has to be one of Tinseltown’s finest. With a filmography that’s extremely impressive, Howard has directed films like 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'The Grinch', 'The Da Vinci Code', and more recently, 'Solo: A Star Wars Story'. And as with any successful person, there’s always a strong support network behind them.\n\nTo spend 44 years with someone is incredible and gives all us hopeless romantics hope that we might be able to get that one day too. The secret, according to the pair, is healthy communication.\n\nMichael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan – Together Since 1988\n\nMichael J. Fox rose to fame on our television screens going as far back as 1976. For you millennials, he’s the guy who plays Marty McFly in the 'Back to the Future' trilogy. Anyway, we’re here to talk about love, something which Michael J. Fox and his darling wife Tracy Pollan have loads to give to one another.\n\nThe pair got together in the 80s, first meeting while Pollan was shooting 'Family Ties', but it wasn’t until two years later on the set of 'Bright Lights, Big City' that they started getting more serious. Fast forward three decades and Fox and Pollan are still together, especially through crucial years up to today, with Fox suffering from Parkinson’s disease.\n\nPhoebe Cates and Kevin Kline – Together Since 1989\n\nDoes anyone remember Phoebe Cates from the comedy-horror 'Gremlins'? Anyway, Ms. Cates was quite the sensation in the 80s and was in fact, already married when she starred in 'Gremlins'.\n\nAs it turns out, when she was only 19 years old she married someone 16 years her elder - Kevin Kline. Despite the age gap, this hasn’t seemed to faze either of them – thirty years on and the pair are still very much in love.\n\nHugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness – Together Since 1996\n\nWe absolutely adore this next couple who’ve managed to stand the test of time. Our favorite man from down under, Hugh Jackman is one incredibly talented individual. And right beside him, his wife Deborra-Lee Furness, a woman to whom his love is seemingly never-ending. He’s always gushing about his lady love, and frankly, we are a little jealous!\n\nThe pair tied the knot in 1996 and have since adopted two children together: Oscar Maximillian and Ava Eliot. While some would raise their eyebrows at the 13-year age gap, the pair prove that love is enduring and transcends all “barriers.” Deborra came to Hugh long before showbiz and success, so we’re sure that this love is built to last.\n\nSting and Trudie Styler – Together Since 1982\n\nFrom The Police to his solo act, Sting has an instantly recognizable voice which puts him down in history as one of the greats. What’s more is his personal life: he and his wife Trudie Styler have been together for more than a quarter of a century! Meeting in 1982, the pair dated for ten years before finally tying the knot in 1992.\n\nIt seems that to spend 35 years with someone must mean they’re doing something right - close friends say that the couple's love is almost teenage-like, in the sense that they’re just so into each other. And Sting himself backs this up, revealing that Trudie remains the light in his life (as well as their four kids together).\n\nSteven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw – Together Since 1991\n\nFew names command the quiet of the room like Steven Spielberg. The prolific director and magic-maker, as we like to refer to him, has been married for almost three decades to actress Kate Capshaw.\n\nSpielberg took a risk by taking on the lesser-known actress to star in the now-iconic 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', ignoring leading ladies like Sharon Stone. People questioned, but hey, this is Spielberg we’re talking about. Spielberg hasn’t looked back, almost thirty years later. When love calls, you better listen!\n\nGisele Bündchen and Tom Brady – Together Since 2009\n\nIf there’s one couple that always glitters on the red carpet, it’s certainly the Brady couple. Brazilian supermodel Gisele and her New England Patriots quarterback husband, Tom Brady, are incredible together. It just took a meeting to really seal the deal. In 2006, the pair met at a mutual friend’s house, and since then, they've been joined at the hip.\n\nSuper aligned with their beliefs and lifestyle, this couple was made for each other. We’re sure when Brady was a teen, he wouldn’t have dreamed of marrying a stunning Brazilian woman – but hey, life! The pair tied the knot in 2009 and haven’t looked back, welcoming a boy and a girl into their lives.\n\nSir Patrick Stewart and Sunny Ozell – Together Since 2013\n\nSir Patrick Stewart is a bit of an icon when it comes to 'Star Trek' and 'X-Men'. The esteemed actor got his start in theatre and perfected his craft before responding to the call of Hollywood. Stewart, who has married twice before, has apparently found love and a companion in Sunny Ozell, a Brooklyn-based jazz singer.\n\nDid we mention the fact that she was 39 years his junior? Anyway, The pair have been married for 6 years, and look to be going for quite a few more!\n\nWarren Beatty and Annette Bening –Together Since 1992\n\nWith a 21-year age gap, we’re once again shown that age is just a number. Especially when that gap hasn’t stopped Annette Bening and Warren Beatty for 27 years. The pair married in 1992, just a year after she split from her former husband Steven White.\n\nBeatty, on the other hand, is a bit of a legend, and he’s been acting for almost 50 years. His creative talents as a filmmaker and actor wowed many women in the past, and we’re sure Bening was no exception! The pair have raised four kids together, and are looking toward a bright future together.\n\nBryan Cranston and Robin Dearden –Together Since 1989\n\nYou might recognize him from his role opposite Frankie Muniz, but boy, what a performance Cranston gave in the hit series 'Breaking Bad'! However, it was on the set of 'Airwolf', back in 1986, when Cranston and Dearden first laid eyes on each other. Bryan was the bad guy and Dearden the victim, and from there the pair married. 31 years later, we’d say that that was one hostage situation that came out with a happy ending!\n\nAfter all those years, we’d like to get the secret to keeping a marriage together and to strengthen it with all the challenges married couples face. Pretty incredible, but we suppose the fact the pair have lots of royalties coming in doesn’t hurt at all.\n\nMark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa- Together Since 1996\n\nThese very attractive individuals made everyone a little jealous when they tied the knot, but despite their picture-perfect marriage, things aren’t always what they seem. In 23 years of marriage, the pair have had their fair share of trials and tribulations, but it seems that they have no regrets.\n\nTheir fated meeting on 'All My Children' saw Ripa opposite Consuelos as his love interest. Funny how fiction can mirror reality sometimes. The pair eloped to Las Vegas and tied the knot, but not before they broke up briefly first. Nowadays, that’s in the past and they seem to be very happy together.\n\nHarrison Ford and Calista Flockhart –Together Since 2010\n\nWith his debonair charm and signature smirk, it’s no wonder Harrison Ford wooed the likes of Calista Flockhart. The pair have been married just shy of 10 years, and really seem to be enjoying married life together. Ford, who’s now 77, married the 54-year-old in 2010.\n\nThe pair have been together ever since and support each other through everything – for Harrison Ford, it’s aviation! Couples that support one another, stay together.\n\nJennifer Grey and Clark Gregg – Together Since 2001\n\nWhether you remember her as the furious older sister in 'Ferris Bueller’s Day Off', or in the iconic 'Dirty Dancing' as ‘Baby’, she’s certainly a memorable face from the 1980s. It seems that she was born with a natural charm and gift – and her beauty really hasn’t faded after all these years. And it may surprise you to know that she’s married to Clark Gregg, who you would’ve seen more recently in Marvel’s 'Avengers' franchise as Agent Phil Coulson.\n\nThe pair have been married 18 years, tying the knot in 2001.\n\nOlivia Newton-John and John Easterling – Together Since 2008\n\nSuperstar singer and actress Olivia Newton-John is fighting cancer yet again, but the gorgeous smiling Aussie has fought it each and every time, and certainly not alone! Her battle is made just that tiny bit easier by having a partner like John Easterling.\n\nHer partner Easterling is an American businessman and environmentalist who’s the chairman of Amazon Herb Company. While the pair have no natural children together, Easterling plays dad to Olivia’s daughter, Chloe Rose. Did you know this wonderful couple renewed their vows in Peru? We wish them all the best.\n\nFelicity Huffman and William H. Macy – Together Since 1997\n\nAnother couple coming across each other in the early 80s, next up is Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy. The pair have been together a grand 22 years, and we know that this couple values family.\n\nIt seems that they’ve found the secret to keeping things interesting and growing a committed, long-lasting relationship despite their hectic acting careers and the media.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. – Together Since 2002\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer meets Fred Jones, and apparently, they liked the look of each other enough to get married. Anyway, characters aside, the pair has remained married for almost twenty years. The secret? “We were just friends. That’s one of the reasons I think our relationship has always been so good,” Freddie said.\n\nThe pair met on the set of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and started their friendship there. So hey, friends first, lovers later!\n\nViola Davis and Julius Tennon – Together Since 2003 Years\n\nThe magnetic and charming Viola Davis is a leading lady who’s not to be trifled with, that’s for sure! But despite her strong, usually fierce character portrayals, she’s got her lover man behind the scenes.\n\nMarried to Julius Tennon, the pair tied the knot in 2003 and have enjoyed married life ever since, even adopting a little girl together.\n\nTom Hanks and Rita Wilson – Together Since 1988 years\n\nThe Hollywood icon Tom Hanks is known for securing his own piece of Greece and holidaying there as frequently as possible (and who wouldn’t?). The Oscar winner needs no introduction, nor do we need to detail his filmography – besides, we’re here for love anyway!\n\nHis wife Rita came across his path in 1988, on the set of 'Volunteers'. Since then, the pair haven’t left each other's sides. And hey, if it’s on a remote Greek island, that’s even more reason to stick together.\n\nDustin and Lisa Hoffman – Together Since 1980\n\nNow, this is a marriage to celebrate - Dustin and Lisa Hoffman have been married for nearly forty years! Dustin Hoffman, who’s now 80, has proved with his marriage to Lisa that true love never dies. The Hoffmans married in 1980, and Lisa, in fact, came out and said jokingly “I say in Hollywood it is like dog years, so you have to multiply that by seven.”\n\nShe also went on to say that marriage is no walk in the park: “We work hard at it. I knew I was going to end up with Dusty, and that my life would be traveling around with him.” You have to love that commitment to her partner! Did you know the pair were friends for years before they started dating? So that’s pretty much a lifetime together.\n\nPierce Brosnan and Keely Shaye Smith - Together Since 2001\n\n007 himself, Pierce Brosnan, was in fact, contrary to his leading part, quite the committed man. Despite his signature role’s philandering, Brosnan has been with his lovely lady, Keely Shaye Smith, for just over 18 years. One of the most popular James Bond actors, Brosnan was marked by tragedy before moving forward with his wife Keely Shaye.\n\nHis first wife passed tragically, leaving him quite devastated.

Both were previously married before they met, but following separations, the pair were single when they met at a party. They quickly realized they had something special, and one date turned into more dates, and finally, marriage.\n\nThey kept it under wraps of course, and only close friends knew they’d wed. What we love most about this couple is that in 21 years of marriage, they’ve both ensured not to take one another for granted.\n\nAdam Sandler and Jackie Sandler – Together Since 2003\n\nHollywood funnyman Adam Sandler is pretty much a comedic genius when it comes to the genre. Anyone who disagrees, well, they clearly haven’t seen 'Happy Gilmore'. The king of late 90s comedy films, Sandler kept himself busy (and still is keeping busy). You’d think with a hectic schedule that your love life would take a bit of a hit, but not the case for Sandler.\n\nHe makes sure to set aside time for his family, which we think is extremely important. Devoted to his two daughters and wife of 20 years, Jackie, Sandler is quite the family man. We’re sure that the checks he brings into the family also help with keeping that marriage strong.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis and Christopher Guest – Together Since 1984\n\nThe stunning Jamie Lee Curtis and her beau Christopher Guest have been married for over thirty years. We love the way they “met”, too: Curtis, in fact, spotted Christopher Guest on the cover of a magazine one day. From that one picture, she proclaimed that this man would be her future husband. And it actually happened!\n\nThe pair have two children together. And did you know that Christopher Guest has the title of Baron? Pretty cool!\n\nMelissa Gilbert and Timothy Busfield – Together Since 2013\n\nNow this one is just shy of reaching a decade, but hey, it seems that anything longer than a year is a record in Hollywood.

Previously, Melissa’s marriages didn’t quite work out, divorcing twice. But luckily for Melissa, it seems that she may have found the one in Timothy Busfield.\n\nThe couple, despite their relatively short marriage thus far, has big plans for the future, with a goal to start their own theatre company. It seems that maybe this joint venture could help them come closer together rather than push them apart. We wish them all the best!\n\nJohn Travolta and Kelly Preston– Together Since 1991\n\nHitting our screens with some knee-dropping, toe-tapping and electric dance moves, the star of 'Saturday Night Fever' is a Hollywood heavyweight.

We wish them all the best, and wonder if Travolta still has those dance moves. In 2020, Preston sadly passed away at the age of 57.\n\nDavid Beckham and Victoria Beckham – Together Since 1999 Years\n\nThe international football superstar and popstar-turned luxe fashion designer have been married for 21 years!

While their kids are growing and showing their talents already, that doesn’t mean mom and dad are showing any signs of slowing down.\n\nHave you seen how incredible this pair looks together when they’re out just for dinner? We wish them all the best and are hoping to see them spend another 21 years together.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick – Together Since 1992\n\n'Sex and the City' meets 'Ferris Bueller', this Tinseltown couple has been together through it all.

The pair first locked eyes on one another when they were introduced through Sarah’s brother.\n\nIt seems that while they keep their personal life under wraps, Sarah Jessica did provide some insight as to her true feelings: \"Call me crazy, but I love him. We're very devoted to our family and our lives. I love our life. I love that he's the father of my children, and it's because of him that there's this whole other world that I love.”\n\nAnna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias – Together Since 2001\n\nWe're sure Enrique has serenaded his wife of 17 years, Anna Kournikova, many, many times! The couple started dating after meeting in 2001 on the set of his “Escape” video clip. At 21, Kournikova gave up the Wimbledon pursuit and decided to follow her heart instead.\n\nOver the years, the couple has graced red carpets and been on everyone’s favorite couple list.

And Michael Douglas, well, his reputation precedes him – we really don’t have to list his slew of films!\n\nProminent in Hollywood, the pair have grown from strength to strength, and stuck by one another. Despite signing a prenup before saying “I do”, it’s highly unlikely that the pair will need to call in the lawyers, a la 'Intolerable Cruelty'! Almost twenty years later, the pair have two kids together and have earned a lavish lifestyle. Cheers to that!\n\nDenzel and Pauletta Washington – Together Since 1983\n\nWe’re pretty sure En Vogue’s hit “Whatta Man” was inspired by Denzel Washington. Churning out successful films like butter, Denzel Washington is just incredibly charismatic. Over the years, he’s amassed a fortune of over $220 million, which he shares with his wife Pauletta Washington.\n\nWith one of the most enduring marriages in Hollywood, married for 36 years, Denzel credits his wife as being the reason their marriage “works.” The pair met on the set of TV movie 'Wilma', and Denzel was smitten.
