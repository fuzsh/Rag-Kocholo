        "text": "Steve Carell is famous for playing dumb-but-lovable Brick in Anchorman, the voice of greatest-baddie-ever Gru in Despicable Me, and the world's oldest virgin in (well, dur), 40-Year-Old Virgin. And now, he can add DILF to his list of achievements.\n\nYes: Steve Carell is officially sexy, even when he's wearing dad-trousers and a pirate shirt in his new movie, Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY. Based on a children's book that's HUGE in the US but little-known this side of the pond, the film sees Steve's character Ben having the day from hell, after his son wishes on a birthday candle that his perfect family could experience a sucky day, just for once.\n\nWe decided to test Steve's no good, very bad day credentials by asking him how he would cope with some terrible, horrible situations. Then made him blush by telling him we think he's totally hot.\n\nClick below to watch the interview Steve wanted to \"go on forever\"..."
