        "text": "Most patrons coming into the Marshfield Hills General Store asked the same question. “Is he here?”\n\nThe “he” in question was Emmy-nominated actor Steve Carell, who bought the store in 2008. His sister-in-law Tish Vivado runs the business.\n\n“People always ask if he is here and I joke back, ‘Yes, but you just missed him,’” Vivado said. “He comes in a lot for coffee or Snapple and his kids love it, too.”\n\nSince buying a home in Marshfield in 2005, Carell has become the seaside town’s most popular resident. But he doesn’t see it that way.\n\n“I think Steven Tyler is the pride of Marshfield. I’ve heard he is a great guy and I would love to meet him some day,” Carell, 48, said. “It’s a lovely town. I love being there. It’s a great place to come back to. My family loves it. It’s a second home for my kids. I feel like it’s home.”\n\nOriginally from Acton, Carell has been married to Cohasset actress Nancy Walls since 1995. They have two children, Elisabeth Anne, 10, and John, 7.\n\nSitting in a suite at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Manhattan, Carell was talking to reporters to promote his new romantic comedy, “Crazy, Stupid, Love.” He was more than willing to set aside some time to talk about his adopted home town and living on the South Shore.\n\n“It’s very different from L.A. It’s the atmosphere that my wife and I both grew up with. And it’s something we want to share with our kids. We want them to be with all of their cousins, aunts and uncles and grandparents,” Carell said. “It’s family. It’s coming back to the family and I think that’s important.\n\nCarell bought the Marshfield Hills General Store in 2008 because he said he thought it was a local landmark worth preserving. “The main impetus to keep it going is that not many of those places exist and I wanted this one to stay afloat,” he said. “Just generally speaking, there are not that many local sort of communal places as there used to be. So much interaction has now become over the Internet that I think it’s nice for people to actually go and talk and have a cup of coffee and communicate with one another. It sounds very old school, but it is important to me.”\n\nCarell really became a darling around town when he gave the “MarshVegas” shout out from the red carpet at the 2007 Academy Awards. And, like other Marshfield residents, he’s not really sure where the nickname came from. “I’ve seen T-shirts based on that but I don’t know who coined it and I don’t know specifically what it refers to.”\n\nA six-time Emmy nominee, Carell exited “The Office” in April. Since then he has had more time to spend on the South Shore. “We hang out at Green Harbor. My son was in camp and my daughter took sailing lessons. She’s on the swim team. We’re just embracing the summer months here,” Carell said, adding they might eat breakfast at Arthur and Pat’s, spend rainy days bowling at the Alley Kat Lane in Kingston. He was also spotted working out at the YMCA in Hanover. One favorite is Friendly’s Fribbles. “We don’t have Friendly’s in L.A. and I took my son to Friendly’s for the first time, which he loved. ... There’s a lot to do in the area and I’m discovering new things to do all the time.”\n\nCarell’s new movie opens in theaters Friday.\n\nDana Barbuto may be reached at dbarbuto@ledger.com."
