        "text": "In the new Steve Carell comedy, \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\" – which is neither crazy nor stupid – Carell's character is dumped, after 20-odd years of marriage, by Julianne Moore.\n\nCarell moves out, and tries to move on. But every so often he sneaks back to his old home in the middle of the night just to clip the hedges and fertilize the grass – like some lost John Cheever character.\n\n\"There is a sadness to it,\" says Carell, 48. \"That's what I loved about that scene, and what I found very appealing about the script. It felt very human to me. It felt very real.\"\n\nIt was that feeling that helped the star – also acting as producer – attract a strong cast including Ryan Gosling as a local Lothario who gives Carell pickup lessons, and the charmingly awkward Emma Stone and ferocious Marisa Tomei as the objects of their attentions.\n\n\"We got people we knew wouldn't give the easy, expected performances,\" Carell says. \"Because it's not a simple subject matter and it's not something that we wanted to be cloying or sentimental. It's a comedy, but you want it to be true.\"\n\nAt its best – \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Date Night,\" a long run on TV's \"The Office\" – Carell's comedy always has been.\n\nHe grew up in Acton, Mass., where his mother was a psychiatric nurse, his father an electrical engineer. Carell played hockey, played the fife, and played around with radio broadcasting. He majored in history in college, and thought perhaps he'd go to law school.\n\nExcept when it came down to actually filling out the application, he couldn't answer one of the first questions – the one asking, simply, why he wanted to be a lawyer.\n\n\"I had never considered acting as a career choice, although I'd always enjoyed it,\" he says. \"I enjoyed hockey and singing in the choir, and I didn't think of them as potential careers, either... But I began to realize I really loved acting, and telling stories. Reading a book, watching a movie, going to a play, it's transporting, and very, very exciting. And to be a part of that, creating things with your imagination, whoa.\"\n\nWhich is exactly what he told himself when he began to dare think about doing it for real. Whoa. Stop. Don't.\n\n\"I just felt that, after all of the education they had given me, I owed my parents a more – for want of a better word – 'legitimate' career,\" he says. \"But they're the ones who sat me down and said, 'Look, you need to do what makes you happy.' And a few months later I moved to Chicago. I thought Los Angeles, New York – I'd get lost in the shuffle. I wanted to learn and I wanted to work and I figured Chicago was the best place to do that – and also the best place, potentially, to fail and then pick yourself up afterward. And pretty soon I started getting plays.\"\n\nThey were tiny plays and even tinier roles. There was restaurant work in between, and at first only the smallest steps forward.\n\n\"People ask, 'Oh, when did you realize you had made it?' expecting some major success,\" he says. \"I remember exactly when I knew I had made it. It was 1988, when I finally stopped waiting tables, when I could finally pay the rent just by being an actor. There were other things that came later – Second City, and off-Broadway and TV — but that moment, realizing I was making a living just by acting, that was a huge demarcation.\"\n\nThere were other big changes to come.\n\nCarell moved to New York, and began getting regular roles – mostly one-shot guest appearances – on sitcoms. He auditioned for \"Saturday Night Live\" (and lost the gig to Will Ferrell). He married SNL cast member Nancy Walls, and started a family, an apparently happy union that gives \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\" even more relevance for him.\n\n\"I've been married 16 years next month and I can't even comprehend (splitting up),\" he says. \"Some people fantasize about it, thinking 'Oh, wouldn't it be great to be back on the market again, dating?' I don't think the reality would be anywhere near the fantasy of it. I think it'd be a scary, potentially very sad place to be.\"\n\nIn 1999, Carell got a gig on \"The Daily Show\" with Jon Stewart, where he and a few other deceptively straight-arrow comedians began to do some terrific slashing satire.\n\n\"There were a lot of smart, funny people there, and you put a lot of smart funny people together, and you can get all this infighting, and intrigue,\" he says. \"But 'The Daily Show' wasn't like that. People were there to work and to have fun. You really just couldn't wait to go into the office everyday and make other people laugh. And the other people, they were really stand-up guys. I've known Stephen (Colbert) since '88, and he's one of the smartest, most talented people I've ever met.\"\n\nCarell stayed with the show for five years. Then, in 2005, came the one-two punch of \"The Office\" and \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\"\n\n\"Almost everyone was betting against 'The Office,'\" he said. \"We did the pilot and I think five more shows, and then (the network) just wanted to wait and see. And the show did evolve a bit... But I think from the very beginning on it, my take was that Michael needed to be – well, ultimately not likable but someone who could possibly be sympathetic. It couldn't get warm and fuzzy, but you didn't want it to be too harsh.\"\n\nPurists who loved the original British show would claim that was exactly what made the first series so brilliant. But, Carell points out, that was a completely different format.\n\n\"(Creator) Ricky Gervais' take on it was perfect, but he had it structured as a 12-episode arc,\" Carell says. \"And there's a real elegance to that. Series like that, like 'Fawlty Towers,' where Basil Fawlty is such an awful human being — they're little capsules of wonderful television. But for a show that's trying for a long run, you need the character to have some qualities you can identify with. He can't be too much of a jerk.\"\n\nCarell's Michael was just enough of a jerk to make people laugh, and enough of a real person to keep people watching. And just as the show ended its first season, \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" came out, with Carell playing a character who remains, well into adulthood, untouched by human hands. It was the first in an ever-more raunchy series of Judd Apatow comedies — and the most cringe-worthy moment had to be when Carell's hero, talked into some \"manscaping,\" got his chest waxed.\n\nAs painful as the real-life scene was, the recuperation was, somehow, even worse.\n\n\"It started to grow back, but then I got all these ingrown hairs, and a rash broke out,\" Carell confides. \"And I had to keep shaving it, to match it for shots later in the film, so I'd be getting razor stubble, too. It was a mess. It took a solid two months to fully grow back after the film. My wife couldn't bear to look at it. She made me wear a T-shirt all the time.\"\n\n\"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" was an amazing hit, and although not every movie followed in its successful path – \"Evan Almighty\" remains a movie-comedy disaster to rank alongside \"Ishtar\" – more than enough were hits. The obvious Hollywood move for Carell, then, would have been to hire a sharp lawyer, find a way to tear up his TV deal, and jump into films full-time.\n\nBut he didn't do that.\n\n\"I definitely wanted to honor my contract,\" Carell says. \"And I wanted to make sure the show was going to continue after I left – I didn't want my leaving to end anything for anyone else ... So I'm confident now the show is not only going to go on, but thrive – I think adding James Spader is a great choice. And going when my contract was up, it felt like the right thing for me. Isn't it better to leave before people want you to? Otherwise, it's like being at a party too long, you know?\"\n\nHe sighs.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he says after a moment. \"Who knows, maybe in retrospect it'll seem like the dumbest choice I could have made, but I really don't have any second thoughts. Only about leaving my friends, really. They're people I spent a lot of time with and grew very close to, and that's the part that's painful. Right now they're two weeks away from starting the next season and I won't be there. It's like they're getting ready to go back to school and I already graduated. It's odd.\"\n\nNot that he has too much time to mope. He's got this movie to promote. He's also filming another one, \"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World,\" a dark indie comedy he describes as \"pretty much the flip side of 'Armageddon' – instead of being about how the president sends up astronauts to blow up the asteroid it's about how you spend your life when you know everything is going to be over in two weeks.\"\n\nCarell's character spends it looking for his childhood sweetheart. It's a pretty romantic theme, but then many of the movies he's been in – playing the lonely widower in \"Dan in Real Life,\" the heartbroken gay uncle in \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" the stuck-in-a-rut spouse in \"Date Night,\" the nice-guy in \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" the dumped husband in \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\" – are about people looking for love, or trying hard to hold on to it.\n\nFor an actor who's made a lot of money – and a lot of people laugh – by being cluelessly annoying, it seems he's really a sensitive, flowers-and-candy guy at heart.\n\n\"I guess I am drawn to those stories,\" he admits. \"I mean, this movie is all about love – the love between a husband and a wife, first love, puppy love, the love between friends, family – and how important that is… That's not a sexy way to sell a summer comedy I guess, But it's definitely a bit different from the other comedies that are out there now, which I hope is a good thing. And if it makes people happy and feel good then that makes me feel good. It's like, I'm sending this little boat of positivity out there and just hoping it causes some ripples.\""
