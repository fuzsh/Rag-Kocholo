Meanwhile, while he and Dwight are away from the office, Jim and Pam organise an \"office Olympics\" where employees compete in ridiculous games.\n\nA Benihana Christmas: Part 1\n\nMichael sends out an inappropriate photoshopped Christmas card and gets his heart broken for the holidays by girlfriend Carol. Andy takes Michael out drinking with Dwight and Jim, while tensions on the party planning committee result in two rival parties being thrown.\n\nMichael's Birthday\n\nIn celebration of his birthday, Michael takes the Dunder Mifflin gang ice skating, while Kevin nervously waits for some medical test results.\n\nDiwali\n\nCorporate won't pay for the office Halloween party, so Michael convinces everyone to attend a party for the Hindu holiday Diwali. At the party, Ryan freaks out when Kelly's parents seem to expect him to ask for Kelly's hand in marriage."
