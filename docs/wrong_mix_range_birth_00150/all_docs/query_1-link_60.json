        "text": "Yoko Ono is a renowned Japanese singer, contemporary artist, and filmmaker. Coming from a wealthy and educated background, she chose to make a career in singing and performance art, which brought her both positive and negative publicity. This was mainly due to her link-up with The Beatles member, John Lennon, which was assumed to be the reason behind the group’s break-up. Nevertheless, she fought and rose to create a name for herself in the world of music and performance art. By delivering unusual acts, she moved beyond the boundaries of music, art and theatre, thereby being highly influential in motivating the punk and new generation. But, it was after her husband’s assassination that she emerged as a strong individual, and gave some of her best solo hits and best-seller albums to the music industry. Among her numerous solos, ‘Season of Glass’ is considered to be her best album, which received immense appreciation outside the standard critical and avant-garde community. During her over half-decade career, she gave some hit music albums, which include ‘Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band’, ‘Rising’, ‘Wedding Album’, ‘Live Peace in Toronto 1969’, and ‘Double Fantasy’, apart from over 16 films, such as ‘Bottoms’, ‘Cut Piece’, ‘Two Virgins’, ‘Rape’, Freedom’, and ‘Making of Fly’."
