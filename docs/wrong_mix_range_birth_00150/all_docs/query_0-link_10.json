        "text": "#10: John Lennon & Yoko Ono\n\nRumors persist as to how these two lovers came together in the late ‘60s, but no one can deny the existence of the 1968 experimental album “Two Virgins,” in which John Lennon and Yoko Ono went “au naturel” for the cover. As the Beatle drifted away from his bandmates, he resumed intense artistic endeavors with his Japanese counterpart, as they created their own philosophy known as “Bagism,” conducted “bed-ins” and recorded the timeless “Give Peace a Chance” at Montreal’s Queen Elizabeth Hotel. Despite a brief separation in the early ‘70s, John and Yoko reunited and lived in New York’s Upper West Side until a fateful 1980 evening.\n\n#9: Tom Waits & Kathleen Brennan\n\nThe gruff voice of Tom Waits may lead one to believe that he’s lived a long life of desolation and solitude, but that’s not quite the case. Back in the early 1980s, Kathleen Brennan worked for director Francis Ford Coppola, and when the film “One from the Heart” went into production, she met the film’s composer, Tom Waits, at a New Year’s Eve party. Soon after, the artists were married, and through Brennan’s extensive background in the arts, she introduced a new musical ideology to her husband, which ultimately led to the groundbreaking 1983 album “Swordfishtrombones” along with a joint venture in songwriting.\n\n#8: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne\n\nAs the husband and wife couple of Arcade Fire, these two met in 2000 while Régine Chassagne was playing a little jazz at her Montreal alma mater. A young Win Butler must have been impressed on a multitude of levels, as the Haitian-Canadian Chassagne signed up for the fire, literally and figuratively, and gave birth to a son just a few years later. As the front man of Arcade Fire, Win provides the theatrics, with Regine adding an ethnic touch on background vocals and a variety of instruments. As a result, the couple innovated a new indie sound.\n\n#7: Jack White & Meg White\n\nOk, some of you Mojoholics may be freaking out right now, simply because you still believe these two musicians to be a brother and sister act. In reality, however, Jack and Meg were married from 1996 to 2000. Before The White Stripes hit it big, the male in this musical marriage was born John Anthony Gillis, but upon getting hitched, Jack honorably took the last name of his bride. And so, the former drummer introduced his wife to the trade, and they slowly rose to fame via their raw musical union, first as the chromatic king and queen of underground rock and later as internationally renowned artists.\n\n#6: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill\n\nIn the mid-90s, these two country acts had released only a handful of albums as solo artists, but during a 1996 tour, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill sparked up a romance, were married by the end of the year and shocked the country music industry along the way. Prior to becoming successful crossover artists in their own right, however, the couple released the heart-wrenching “It’s Your Love,” which not only announced their romance to the world but played a pivotal role in their continued commercial success. While Faith’s album output has been less than Tim’s over the years, you could say it may’ve been because she was a little busy giving birth to three children, albeit with a little help from her spouse.\n\n#5: Stevie Nicks & Lindsey Buckingham\n\nTruth be told, the original Fleetwood Mac lineup had released nine albums by the time Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined the band, and by that time, the new couple had known each other since her senior year of high school and released a 1973 album entitled “Buckingham Nicks.” But upon over 10 years with Fleetwood Mac and the dissipation of a relationship, Buckingham couldn’t take it any more and subsequently left to embark on a solo career, which often focused on his romance with Nicks. Of course, John and Christine McVie from the band’s earlier line-up had their own troubled relationship, which along with their bandmates’ tumultuous relationship, played a pivotal role in the classic 1977 album “Rumours.”\n\n#4: Tina Tuner & Ike Turner\n\nIn 1958, an 18-year-old gal by the name of Anna Mae Bullock found herself transfixed by the lead singer of a local rock band, and that same year, she sang background under the name “Little Ann” on Ike Turner’s “Box Top.” It wasn’t long until young Anna Mae was pressured to adopt the name Tina Turner for a stage act, and by 1960, “A Fool in Love” became the couple’s first Billboard hit. For more than 15 years, the lovers were known as one of the leading acts of R&B, but their troubled marriage finally broke apart due to Ike’s physical abuse. Even so, the music lives on, and it’s electric.\n\n#3: Jay Z & Beyoncé\n\nTruly a powerhouse couple of the digital age, these two artists found each other while they were still hustling their way to the top of their respective genres. In the early 2000s, with Hova already a respected solo artist and business mogul, he met Beyonce Knowles, the lead singer of Destiny’s Child. And by 2002, the secretive couple turned heads with their collaborative effort on “’03 Bonnie & Clyde,” and the next year, Beyonce released her sensational debut album “Dangerously in Love.” Jay and Bey wouldn’t marry until 2008, but that union would solidify them as an unstoppable force across numerous pop culture platforms.\n\n#2: Johnny Cash & June Carter Cash\n\nAs seen in the 2005 film “Walk the Line,” these two country artists had a storybook romance tinged with a bit of chaos - but then again, that was only part of the story. Nearly 15 years after first meeting the young starlet of the Carter Family, Johnny Cash finally made his move during a Canadian performance, which marked the beginning of a historic and creatively proficient relationship. In fact, Johnny and June remained together for the next 35 years. It was only death that could separate them, as June passed away in May of 2003, followed by Mr. Cash a few months later. They were friends, lovers and musical collaborators until the end.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\nPaul McCartney & Linda McCartney\n\nGeorge Jones & Tammy Wynette\n\nGwen Stefani & Tony Kanal\n\nThurston Moore & Kim Gordon\n\nChris Frantz & Tina Weymouth\n\n#1: Sonny Bono & Cherilyn Sarkisian [aka Sonny & Cher]\n\nBack in the mid-‘60s, Phil Spector was highly regarded as one of the best music producers, and though his legacy would take a dark turn, two of his backup singers made their own mark in pop history. As “Sonny and Cher,” the couple released their first single in 1964, followed by a 1965 debut album, which paved the way for entertaining, and maybe a little bit cheesy, variety programs. A song like “I Got You Babe” has become an essential karaoke jam for decades of lovers, and while Sonny and Cher didn’t survive as a musical act or marriage, they managed to maintain their image through mutual support and respect all the way until Sonny’s accidental death in 1998.\n\nDo you agree with our list?
