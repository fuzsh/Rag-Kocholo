        "text": "Minoru Niizuma (1930 - 1998) worked extensively with stone throughout his entire career. After graduating from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, Niizuma moved to New York in 1959 in search of further knowledge of the power tools necessary to work with stone on a larger scale. From 1964 through 1970 he was an instructor at the Brooklyn Museum Art School and from 1972 through 1984, he was an adjunct professor at Columbia University. Throughout this time, Niizuma developed significant relationships with various other Japanese artists, including Yoko Ono, Tomio Miki, and Isamu Noguchi. Niizuma is known for photographing Yoko Ono’s performance art, “Cut Piece” at Carnegie Hall.\n\nNiizuma worked mainly in marble and granite, but did not shy away from other stones, like limestone, alabaster, and onyx. Niizuma also worked with bronze and wood. As his understanding of each stone developed, so did his search for beautiful stone. He visited various quarries throughout the world, and sourced the majority of his stone from Italy, Portugal, and Vermont. Niizuma participated in and was the director for many stone symposiums where he and others would use the stone from the area to create sculptures that would be showcased in the area. In Evora (Portugal), St. Margarethen (Austria), Vermont (US), and Iwate (Japan), Niizuma worked with the local marble and granite to create sculptures that remain there to this day.\n\n“Minoru Niizuma, Stone Carver”\n\nWritten by Thomas Messer, Director of The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1975\n\nMinoru Niizuma belongs to a vanishing breed of stone carvers whose purpose is to animate inert mass by converting it into eloquent form. This he achieves by translating much of himself, often in the most immediate sense, through physical proximity and muscular exertion into variously colored and textured marble surfaces which then, as if in gratitude, acknowledge through the resulting formal perfection the imprint of the sculptor’s mind and hand.\n\nThe basic forms are relatively few and the surface treatment is often repeated with appropriate modifications. A cube for instance deftly balanced on its point with part of its surface highly polish contrasts with parallel rough grooves that run like furrows opened by a plough in the good earth. The same quasi-geometric cube shape may reappear upright, supported by an integral pedestal in black marble whose delicate white veins add to the formal vibrancy a lifelike dimension. Then again, an all white triangular structure this time supported by an oak stand is set into a seemingly rhythmic flow by a wavy, grooved hypotenuse.\n\nThe examples in Portuguese, Italian, Bavarian, and US marble could be multiplied but through all of them Niizuma achieves lightness, dynamism, and formal grace that nevertheless compatible with the solidity, the gravity, and the elemental power of the stony matière.\n\nNiizuma’s tone sculpture is capable of projecting meanings and evoking associations without need of an explicit subject matter. The artist’s confident reliance upon the communicative power of his materials and surface, of course, on the basic oriental tradition - one so easily admired yet wholly beyond emulation in western traditions of modern art.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWritten by Lisa Taylor, Director, Cooper-Hewitt Museum, Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Design, 1986\n\nMinoru Niizuma is an artist of major importance. His place in the history of modern sculpture is assured. He is among the few internationally known sculptors working in stone today. Although his background is Japanese, his work is universal; although he has deep respect for tradition, his art is completely contemporary.\n\nMy admiration for Niizuma’s work has grown steadily over the years. It has been an immensely pleasurable and exciting experience to witness his creative development - to observe the transition from his earlier work, which was dramatic and bold to his recent work, which is elegant and restrained. Along the way he has met any challenges, such as the one presented by this exhibition of pieces executed entirely in black granite and white marble.\n\nIt was not until Niizuma had worked in stone for thirty years that he admits to having begun to understand and appreciate this medium. At that time, he claims to have started to allow stone to speak to him and direct him, rather than to inflict his own personality on it. When he discovered that stone possesses a life of its own, he began to carve less and his work became quieter and more sure.\n\nWhile there is an Oriental precedent many centuries old for working in monochrome, it is usually associated with brushwork and not the shaping of stone. The work Niizuma produced in Portugal shows a new kind of power that comes with assurance. It is simple, straightforward, handsome, contemplative, and proud. It shows great sensitivity and masterful skill. Above all, The World of Silence suggests accord between artist and material."
