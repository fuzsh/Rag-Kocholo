        "text": "Groundbreaking avant-garde icon, unrelenting advocate for peace, visionary artist across mediaâYoko Ono has remained a singular creative voice since she became a public figure in the â60s. Born in 1933 in Tokyo, where she began her classical training in piano and voice, Ono left Japanâs biggest cityâwhere she survived WWII firebombsâin 1945, moved to the U.S. in 1953, and settled in New York City in the â60s. She had established herself as a trailblazing experimental artist by the time she met John Lennon, her eventual husband and primary musical collaborator. Her work with Lennon, including her boundary-expanding influence on his late-era Beatles work, pushed against convention, most notably for its activism, like 1969âs protest-ready âGive Peace a Chance,â but also for its intimacy: 1968âs delicate hotel-bedroom recording âRemember Loveâ is so bare that it feels like listening in on a whispered secret. A defiant current, often turbocharged by her singing styles, runs through Onoâs solo work, by turns ballistic (1970âs sensory overloader âWhyâ), ferocious (1973âs booming âWoman Powerâ), and hopeful, like her folky 1973 song âNow or Never,â a scathing indictment of American injustices. Just a couple months after Lennonâs murder in December 1980, Ono released the song on the tape he had been holding when he was shotââWalking On Thin Iceââwhich became her first and only pop hit in 1981. Onoâs ability to cross genres while remaining wholly herself has also inspired countless composers, noise merchants, and riot grrrls alike, and two remix records featuring acolyte collaborators backing her singing (2007âs Yes, Iâm a Witch and 2016âs Yes, Iâm a Witch Too) prove not only a fitting tribute to her wide-reaching influence, but also an apt avenue for her message to pursue peace and love to resonate with new generations."
