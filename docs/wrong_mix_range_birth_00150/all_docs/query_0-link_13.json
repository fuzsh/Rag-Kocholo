        "text": "Yoko Ono (Tokyo, Japan 1933). Studied at Gakushūin University (Tokyo) and Sarah Lawrence College (New York). Multimedia artist, singer, songwriter, filmmaker and peace activist, also known for her work in performance art, Ono has completed 20+ films since 1966. She has had screenings and exhibitions, including major solo shows, at The Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum (New York), Kunsthalle Bielefeld, Schirn Kunsthalle (Frankfurt), Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao), Art Gallery of Ontario (Toronto) and countless other venues internationally. Ono is the recipient of a Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt Human Rights Award (2012), the Venice Biennale’s Golden Lion Award for Lifetime Achievement (2009), MOCA Award to Distinguished Women in the Arts (2003), the Oskar Kokoschka Prize (2012), and has received an Honorary Doctorate of Law from Liverpool University (2001) and an Honorary Degree of Fine Arts, Bard College (2002). She lives in New York.\n\nDave Fleischer (1894–1979) & Max Fleischer (1883–1972) grew up in a household of six siblings in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Early on, Dave worked as an usher at the Palace Theatre on Broadway where he was exposed to vaudeville performances. He later worked as a film cutter for the American branch of Pathé (at the time the world’s largest film production, distribution company, and manufacturer of film equipment). Both experiences proved highly useful when in 1921 he joined forces with brother Max to launch their first film studio, Out of the Inkwell Films, Inc. (later named Fleischer Studios). Max Fleischer was born in Kraków and immigrated with his parents to the US in 1887. He later studied at Cooper Union and the Arts Students League of New York. In addition to being an animator, producer, and film director, Max was responsible for a number of technical innovations, including the invention of the rotoscope. In addition to a slew of collective achievements, the Fleischer brothers produced and released the first sound cartoons, revolutionizing film and animation.\n\nBruce Baillie (1931–2020) was born in Aberdeen, South Dakota. He studied at the London School of Film Technique, the University of Minnesota and the University of California at Berkeley. In the early 1960s, Baillie quickly became a catalyst of west coast avant-garde filmmaking, co-founding Canyon Cinema and San Francisco Cinematheque with filmmaker Chick Strand in 1961, before making his own astounding contribution as filmmaker to the New American Cinema, alongside peers—including Jonas Mekas, Kenneth Anger and Jack Smith—and influencing a variety of artists from George Lucas to Apichatpong Weerasethakul. His film Castro Street (1966) was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress’ National Film Registry (1991). Many of his films have also been restored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Baillie was the recipient of the Maya Deren Independent Film Award, Rockefeller, Guggenheim,and American Film Institute Fellowships. He died in Camano Island Washington in April 2020.\n\nYvonne Rainer (San Francisco, California 1934) is an American dancer, choreographer, writer and filmmaker. She studied at the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance (1959) and was co-founder of The Judson Dance Theatre (1962). Hand Movie is the first in a series of short and feature-length films created by the artist between 1966-2002. Retrospectives of Rainer’s work have been presented at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Kunsthaus Bregenz; Museum Ludwig; the Getty Research Institute; Jeu de Paume, École des Beaux Artes; Raven Row and other venues. Rainer’s published work includes Feelings Are Facts: A Life (2006); The Films of Yvonne Rainer (1989); A Woman Who…: Essays, Interviews, Scripts (1999); and Moving and Being Moved (2017). She is the recipient of Rockefeller (1988), MacArthur (1990) and Guggenheim Fellowships (1969, 1988), among many other accolades and awards.\n\nMarcel Broodthaers (1924–1976) was a Belgian poet, filmmaker, artist and political activist whose early associations include Le Groupe Surrealiste Revolutionnaire. Primarily a (frustrated) poet during the initial course of his practice, Broodthaers maintained a life-long interest in the circulatory power of printed matter. He made his first film in 1957, and produced more than 50 short films between 1967–1976. He later worked principally with assemblies of found objects and collage, often containing written texts, and produced large-scale environmental pieces that reworked and satirized the notion of the museum. His work has been included in many solo and group exhibitions, including at The Walker Art Center, Tate Modern, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Museum of Modern Art, Jeu de Paume, Palais des Beaux Artes, and three editions of documenta (1997, 1982, 1972). Broodthaers died on his birthday January 28, 1976. He is buried in Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels.\n\nSky Hopinka (Ho-Chunk/Pechanga 1984) was born and raised in Ferndale, Washington and spent a number of years in Oregon and California. He received his BA from Portland State University and his MFA in Film, Video, Animation and New Genres from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. His work has been exhibited around the world, including at ImagineNATIVE, Sundance, TIFF, NYFF, the Whitney Biennial, and five editions of Media City Film Festival. His film Jáaji Approx. was awarded MCFF’s Third Prize (2014). He is the recipient of the More with Less Award from the Images Festival (2016), the New Cinema Award at the Berwick Film and Media Arts Festival, and the Mary L. Nohl Fund Fellowship (2018). Hopinka was a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University (2018-2019), Sundance Art of Nonfiction Fellow (2019), a Guggenheim Fellow (2020) and Herb Alpert Award recipient (2020). His newest collection of poetry Perfidia will be released in October 2020.\n\nHollis Frampton (1936–1984) was an American avant-garde filmmaker, photographer, writer, sculptor, theoretician, teacher and pioneer of digital art born in Wooster, Ohio. In 1958 he moved to New York with the intention of becoming a poet but abandoned the idea in favor of photography. His move to film centred around the rise of avant garde filmmaking in New York in the early 1960s, where he emerged as one of the medium’s major figures, producing films alongside contemporaries Michael Snow, Joyce Weiland, Jonas Mekas and many others. Frampton’s more than 60 films, his photographic and other artworks have been exhibited widely and are in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Art (Washington), the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art among many others. A compendium of Frampton’s collected writings On Camera Arts and Consecutive Matters was published by MIT press in 2009. Frampton died in Buffalo, New York after a brief battle with lung cancer.\n\nKevin Jerome Everson (Mansfield, Ohio 1965) is an artist working in film, painting, sculpture and photography. He holds an MFA from Ohio University, a BFA from the University of Akron and is Professor of Art at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville. He has received mid-career retrospectives at Centre Pompidou (2019); Tate Modern (2017); Modern and Contemporary Art Museum, Seoul, Korea (2017); Viennale (2014); Visions du Reel (2012), the Whitney Museum of American Art and Media City Film Festival (2011). His work has been featured at the 2008, 2012, and 2017 Whitney Biennials and the 2013 Sharjah Biennial. Everson is the recipient of the Herb Alpert Award (2012), Heinz Award in the Arts and Humanities (2019), Guggenheim and American Academy in Rome Fellowships, among many other awards and accolades. He has completed nearly 200 films since 1997.\n\nOona Mosna (Windsor, Ontario 1981) is an artist, author and curator living and working in Windsor-Detroit and internationally. She has organized 1,000+ single screenings, retrospectives and performances with artists including Mati Diop, Barbara Hammer, Sergei Loznitza, Apichatpong Weerastethakul, Ephraim Asili, Valie Export, Kevin Jerome Everson, Artavadz Pelechian and hundreds more for venues including the Toronto International Film Festival, The Presidential Palace (Santiago, Chile) and the Detroit Institute of Arts.
