        "text": "ONO, Yoko (born 1933), with LENNON, John (1940-1980).\n\nLondon: Lisson Gallery, 1967. [Exhibition programme/synopsis] FIRST and ONLY EDITION. Slim booklet comprising four text sheets (26 x 21cm), staples twice to left hand side. Illustrated cover/first sheet \"Have You Seen A Horizon Lately?\". Includes the two-page article 'Some Notes on the Lisson Gallery Show' penned by Yoko Ono. Lightly handled, rust to staples else fine. Housed in a vintage card wallet/folder with pencil title. A slight, yet exceptionally scarce item dating from the very early stages of the Lennon-Ono creative partnership (and possibly prior to their romantic relationship). This the only copy we have seen. Original visitor's information sheets for Yoko Ono's show at Lisson Galley, Marylebone, produced by her first husband Tony Cox, and featuring some collaborations with her show sponsor John Lennon. The exhibition comprised two major themes/elements labelled 'Environments' and 'Objects', the latter including pieces titled 'Air Bottles' (jointly credited to John Lennon) and 'Windflute for John'. Ono and Lennon first met less than a year before this exhibition, at the Indica Gallery, London, while Ono was preparing her 'Unfinished Paintings' exhibit. Lennon was impressed with her work and ideas and the two began a correspondence; Lennon would sponsor her next London showcase titled 'Half-a-Wind' which included the famous 'Half-a-Room' installation. It brought a previously unseen level of internationalism to Lisson Gallery, resulting in queues of visitors that stretched around the block of Bell Street. Item #67021\n\nPrice: Â£2,500.00"
