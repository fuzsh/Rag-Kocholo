Taking her portfolio to different magazines, she received interest from both Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue, and went on to take photographs for a number of different publications. She worked on architectural, fashion, human interest, and working women stories, pushing her work but chasing new opportunities. For example, she photographed furniture for House & Garden, but soon found the work boring and so asked art director Miki Denhof for something more interesting. It was this request that prompted Denhof to take a chance on her and allow her to photograph people and homes too. \n\nWood’s real aim was the do picture stories for magazines such as Life and Look. Editor Betty Leavitt gave Wood an opportunity at Look, from which she became a regular contributor. Her most notable work there was on the 1969 cover story on John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Wood first visited the couple when Yoko was in hospital, and then at their home in Weybridge, England. In an interview on her website, Wood describes the importance of establishing a rapport with her subjects; the couple had seemed tense at first, but after going on a shopping trip with them and the article writer on the King’s Road, the ice was broken and many successful photos were taken around their home. The photograph used on the cover of Look (swipe to see cover) was taken in the couple’s garden. \n\nWritten by @megangalleria\n\n#susanwood #sistersofthelens #susanwoodphotography #womensphotography #womenphotographer #1960sphotography #yokoono #johnlennon #johnandyoko #lookmagazine\".",
