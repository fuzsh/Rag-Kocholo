        "text": "Fifty-three years after Bed-In, Yoko Ono stages a new global intervention by pausing commercial advertisements on the world’s most prominent digital screens to share a message of peace with the global community. An invitation for the world to unite, Ono will broadcast her powerful, universal mantra IMAGINE PEACE every evening at 20:22.\n\nThe public art installation presented by CIRCA in collaboration with Serpentine, will feature local translations of Yoko Ono’s message to the world. IMAGINE PEACE launched 3 March on London’s Piccadilly Lights and is screening across the CIRCA network in London, Los Angeles, Milan, Melbourne, New York, Seoul and Tokyo every evening throughout March 2022.\n\nIMAGINE PEACE is a concept born from Yoko Ono and John Lennon’s tireless work as peace activists. In March 1969, the couple staged their first Bed-In – a weeklong peace protest from their honeymoon suite at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel, boldly communicating their commitment to social justice. This new declaration for peace also marks Ono’s return to London’s Piccadilly Circus, twenty years since she installed a poster carrying the message “Imagine all the people living life in peace” taken from the Lennon-Ono anthem – “Imagine” in March 2002.\n\nYoko Ono’s invitation to IMAGINE PEACE has been expressed since the early 2000s through billboards, advertisements, posters and tweets. “Imagining,” said Ono, “is something that we can all do, even when we have different opinions about how to get there.” In 2007, in memory of John Lennon Ono conceived the IMAGINE PEACE TOWER on Viðey Island off the coast of Reykjavík, Iceland, a tower of beaming light, which represents wisdom and love, and acts as a beacon for all those wishing to contribute to world peace.\n\nMARCH PROGRAMME\n\nIMAGINE PEACE by Yoko Ono\n\n3 – 31 March, CIRCA 20:22\n\n20:22 GMT ➳ London, Piccadilly Lights\n\n20:22 PST ➳ Los Angeles, Pendry West Hollywood\n\n20:22 ACT ➳ Melbourne, Fed Square\n\n20:22 CET ➳ Berlin, Limes, Kurfürstendamm\n\n20:22 CET ➳ Milan, Cadorna Square, EssilorLuxottica\n\n20:22 EST ➳ New York, Luxottica, Times Square\n\n20:22 KST ➳ Seoul, COEX K-Pop Square\n\nHourly JST ➳ Tokyo, Shibuya Crossing\n\nA limited edition print by Yoko Ono is available to purchase on CIRCA.ART for £100. 100% of proceeds will be donated to the United Nations CERF.\n\nThe United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), one of the fastest and most effective ways to ensure that urgent humanitarian assistance, including food, clean water, medicine, education and shelter, reaches people in need whenever and wherever crises strike."
