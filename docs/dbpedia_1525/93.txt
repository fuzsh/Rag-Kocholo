Amid the events of this past week, we felt the need to dedicate an episode of our podcast to the BLACK LIVES MATTER movement and specifically how it relates to musical theatre. Theatre/film/television actress Sharon Catherine Brown joins us for a conversation about her career that has broken through racial boundaries on Broadway and the toll it takes on the black artists willing to do it. After listening to the episode, reach out to us. How can we celebrate black lives in this art form? Who are some of your favorite black artists in musical theatre? Record a voice memo and/or email us at amusicalpodcast@gmail.com.
