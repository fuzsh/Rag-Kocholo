With Black History Month coming to a close, Broadway and television actress Sharon Catherine Brown (Dreamgirls, Caroline or Change) joins host Patrick Oliver Jones to talk about her long family line of performers as well as when she knew she was born to be a drama queen. They also discuss how both of them met in the recent production of Anne of Green Gables at Goodspeed Opera House, which has aspirations of a future in New York City.

Listen below!

Brown was born in New York City and is the daughter of actor Johnny Brown, who portrayed Nathan Bookman on the 1970s sitcom Good Times as well as starred opposite Sammy Davis, Jr. in the Tony-nominated musical Golden Boy. As a young girl she made her Broadway debut in Maggie Flynn as one of the orphans, alongside other newcomers like Irene Cara, Giancarlo Esposito, and Stephanie Mills. And Brown relays a harrowing experience one performance when the set started to crumble underneath her feet.

With her father on Good Times, she auditioned for the role of his daughter but for some reason wasn't cast in the role, but years later she would appear on the show as fun girl Nancy Colton. While Brown has appeared in soap operas like Generations and other sitcoms like The Jeffersons and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, it is her episode on A Different World that sticks out to her and the recognition she's received online as an opera singer, even though she is not an actual opera singer.

But theater is where she got her start and remains her first love. From Broadway productions of Dreamgirls and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat to the national tours of The Wiz and Jekyll & Hyde, ShayCat (as she's known to friends) has experiences and a resume that any actor would love to have. She is making history and leaving a legacy with every performance. It is a surety of herself and confidence in her actions that makes her someone to admire and applaud, because she knows her worth as an actor. She has gone through her own challenges and felt the ups and downs of this career and has come through them a better performer and a better person.

Listen to her episode on Why I'll Never Make It, available on all podcast platforms.
