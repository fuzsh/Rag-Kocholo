        "text": "Bobby (pictured second from left) addressed rumors of a falling out with Tan (middle) in January 2024, two months after he announced his exit from Queer Eye after eight seasons.\n\n\"I want people to know that Tan and I—we will be fine,\" he told Vanity Fair. \"There was a situation, and that's between Tan and I, and it has nothing to do with the show. It was something personal that had been brewing—and nothing romantic, just to clarify that.\"\n\nIn March 2024, Tan responded to allegations that he had campaigned to replace Bobby on Queer Eye with his friend Jeremiah Brent.\n\n\"Netflix and the production companies did a full-on casting. I didn't put my friend up for the job. They ended up getting it because they were the best person for the job,\" he said on Instagram. \"But I didn't get them hired by getting rid of somebody else.\"\n\nFollowing years of rumors of a feud between the two, on a December 2023 episode of her podcast Let's Be Clear, Shannen's former Charmed costar Holly Marie Combs alleged that Alyssa had once made an ultimatum to a show producer to choose between herself and Shannen, which ultimately led to the latter leaving the show in 2001.\n\nIn February 2024, Alyssa said on Instagram, \"I did not have the power to get anyone fired\" and that \"this was so long ago that any retelling of these stories from anyone is just revisionist history.\"\n\nA day later, Shannen said at a panel event at MegaCon Orlando, \"There is no revisionist history happening in the truth that I know we told.\"\n\nIn September 2023, while playing a game called Stir the Pot with her daughter Kelly Osbourne on E! News, Sharon said the That '70s Show alum was the rudest celebrity she had ever met, branding him, a \"rude, rude, rude, rude little boy\" and a \"Dastardly little thing.\"\n\nHe did not respond to her remarks publicly.\n\nFive years prior, Sharon told Larry King that when Ashton appeared on The Talk in 2014, he had an \"attitude\" after she got his name wrong.\n\n\"He goes, 'What are you, what have you done in this industry?'\" she recalled. \"And I was like, 'Kid, don't start with me, because I'm gonna eat you up and s--t you out.' So I was just like, 'You don't know what you're dealing with, kid.'\"\n\nDuring a 2022 TikTok challenge, JoJo Siwa described Candace Cameron Bure as the \"rudest\" celebrity, later explaining that she felt snubbed when Bure once refused to take a picture with her on a red carpet. Shortly after the dig, however, the Full House alum apologized: \"I kind of broke your 11-year-old heart. I didn't take a picture with you. Ugh! I feel crummy, I feel—JoJo, I'm so sorry.\"\n\nThe two made amends. But months later, Candace was asked if she expects the Great American Family network, of which she serves as chief creative officer, to feature same-sex couples as leads in holiday movies. She said no, adding, \"I think that Great American Family will keep traditional marriage at the core.\"\n\nJoJo, who came out as a member of the LGBTQ+ community in 2021, wrote on Instagram that the actress' comment is \"rude and hurtful to a whole community of people.\"\n\nDuring an appearance Watch What Happens Live, the Happy Days actor was asked why he didn't get along with the Forrest Gump star on the set of the 1989 flick Turner & Hooch.\n\n\"I was directing that movie for 13 days and then I was called into [producer] Jeff Katzenberg's office and he said, 'You have everything with you? Go home,'\" he said.\n\nWinkler did, however, seem to get along with Hanks' four-legged co-star. \"I got along great, great with that dog,\" he said. \"Love that dog.\"\n\nHe also refused to admit if he's even seen the flick.\n\nThe costars reignited their ongoing feud when Tyrese publicly called out Dwayne on Instagram after the Fast and Furious 9 release date was pushed back to April 2020. That same day, it was announced that a Fast and Furious spinoff starring Dwayne and Jason Statham would hit theaters in 2019. The following month, Tyrese threatened to quit Fast 9 if Dwayne was in the movie.\n\nTyrese then opened up about the feud, telling Van Lathan on The Red Pill podcast, \"I have yet to talk to The Rock to this day, and we will have a conversation.\" He shared that he did have a conversation with the former wrestler's producing partner, but not the actor himself.\n\n\"I found myself being the messenger on behalf of various people associated to the franchise, but stupid me was the only one who went public about those feelings, which is my own fault,\" Tyrese said. \"It's not professional, it's not cool.\"\n\nNo more bad blood here.\n\nTaylor and Katy had been in a feud for years, even allegedly inspiring Taylor's song \"Bad Blood.\" The drama, which reportedly started over a backup dancer and competing tours, came to an end after Perry sent Taylor a literal olive branch before her Reputation Tour kickoff.\n\n\"So I just got to my dressing room and found this actual olive branch,\" Taylor said in an Instagram video. \"This mean so much.\"\n\nTaylor captioned the video, \"Thank you Katy.\"\n\nSex and the City costars Kim and SJP had dodged feud rumors for years. But they were reignited after Kim decided not to return for a third movie and made comments about her costar that raised eyebrows.\n\n\"What was your reaction to Kim Cattrall telling Piers Morgan that you were never friends just colleagues?\" Andy Cohen asked SJP on a Sept. 2017 episode of Watch What Happens Live.\n\nAs she explained, \"Just...heartbroken. I mean that whole week, you and I spoke about it because I was just...I don't know I found it really upsetting because that's, you know, that's not the way I recall our experience.\"\n\n\"So...it's sad but I'm kind of...I don't know, I always think that what ties us together is this singular experience is the thing. It was a professional experience but it became personal because it was years and years of our lives. So I'm hoping that that sort of eclipses anything that's been recently spoken,\" she continued. \"That many years spent doing something so special that people had a connection with is such a privileged.\"\n\nAnd though they didn't film scenes together, Kim did make a small appearance on And Just Like That.\n\nThe former Grey's Anatomy star sparked a feud with the series creator in 2008 when she removed her name from the Emmy Awards consideration. The actress stated that her reason for the move was because she wasn't \"given the material to warrant a nomination.\"\n\nShonda later opened up about Katherine's decision during an interview with Oprah Winfrey on Oprah's Next Chapter in 2012. \"On some level it stung and on some level I was not surprised,\" she said. \"When people show you who they are, believe them. I carry that [mantra] with me a lot. It has served me well.\"\n\nIt was the New York Fashion Week fight heard 'round the world when Nicki and Cardi got into a heated altercation at the Harper's Bazaar Icon party. The following month, Cardi opened up about the catalyst for the fight with Nicki.\n\n\"For a while now she's been taking a lot of shots at me,\" Cardi said in W magazine's Art Issue. \"I spoke to her twice before, and we came to an understanding. But she kept it going.\"\n\nThe real spark of the fight came when Cardi saw that Nicki had allegedly liked and then unliked a tweet about Cardi's parenting skills, which Nicki has denied.\n\n\"I was going to make millions off my Bruno Mars tour, and I sacrificed that to stay with my daughter,\" Cardi continued. \"I love my daughter. I'm a good-ass f--king mom. So for somebody that don't have a child to like that comment? So many people want to say that party wasn't the time or the place, but I'm not going to catch another artist in the grocery store or down the block.\""
