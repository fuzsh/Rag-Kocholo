        "text": "Sharon Stone picked up something shiny on her Turkish vacation, and unfortunately it wasn't jewellery!\n\nThe actress recently sparked concern as she posed for a snap to show off her holiday attire, but fans quickly clocked she had a black eye to complement her black-and-white outfit.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nAt the time, Sharon wrote 'this trip has been tough; but I’m tougher,' sparking concern amongst her followers.\n\nSharon has since dispelled concern that she suffered the black eye at the hands of another, and recounted the rather painful incident that led to the shiner's development.\n\nShe told her nearly four million followers: 'I know you're all worried about how I got a black eye so I thought I'd let you know. I've been in so many hotels in so many countries that I got up in the middle of the night to pee and didn't know where I was and smacked my face on the marble.'\n\n'No, nobody did anything to me, and yes, I'm just fine and I'm having a great time and I'm being welcomed very beautifully on my trip everywhere that I've gone, and I'm having just the greatest time,' Sharon, who recently supported her son at his high school graduation, continued.\n\nMoving her sunglasses to reveal the bruise, she said: 'It's getting better, but it really is a good-looking shiner. You should see what I did to that marble floor. Thanks so much for caring about me. I care about you too.'\n\n'Black Eye update,' she captioned the clip. 'Thank you all for your kind messages.'\n\n'Even a black eye looks good on you,' one social media user complimented, as another agreed: 'Even with a shiner you’re still gorgeous!'\n\nIf anyone can pull it off, it's Sharon!"
