        "text": "She’s skipping town in brown.\n\nSharon Stone went for a chic travel look as she was photographed at Milan’s Malpensa airport on Tuesday, eschewing a more cozy traveling outfit in favor of a full Tod’s leather look for her flight.\n\nThe “Basic Interest” actress, 65, wore the designer label’s $4,895 jacket in stretch Nappa leather with coordinating brown pants ($5,645) featuring patch pockets.\n\nShe kept the brown leather theme going right down to her shoes, donning a pair of Tod’s loafers ($945) with gold chain detail.\n\nStone wore an array of necklaces including a doubled-up Van Cleef & Arpels Magic necklace, a diamond-studded piece and a pendant necklace with what appears to be a script “S” on it, adding a pair of sparkly drop earrings.\n\nFor more Page Six Style ..\n\nSee the best celebrity looks of the week in our new series, “Instantly Iconic Style”\n\nBrowse the best fashion and beauty products, according to celebs\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe “Casino” actress wore her blond hair in a side-swept style, carrying a patterned Tod’s duffle bag across her body to complete the fashionable look.\n\nAlthough her outfit was an unusually dressed-up look for a flight, the Oscar nominee went understated in terms of her beauty routine, going makeup-free as she smiled widely at the camera.\n\nThe star has made a splash all summer long, posing in a less-than-bundled up series on bikini photos on Instagram, showing off her curves.\n\nHer leather look follows an Instagram post Stone shared on Tuesday announcing she was donating a fun auction item to the Sweet Relief Musicians Fund, promising to follow the winning bidder on Instagram.\n\nWith Milan Fashion Week beginning, the time is ripe for some high-end Italian fashion moments, which will certainly include an appearance at the Dolce & Gabbana show as Stone serves as a face of the brand.\n\nPerhaps she’ll take her chic style to the catwalk as well."
