She has enjoyed a prolific career on the British stage and screen and is a three-time Olivier Award winner. She was was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in 2017 New Year Honours for her services to drama.\n\nClarke launched her career on stage, landing her first professional role in 1988 as Dolores Hope in O Babylon! The Musical. From there, she launched her career on the West End, with some of her earliest roles, between 1996 and 2004, being General Cartwright in Guys and Dolls, Joanne Jefferson in Rent, Miss Sherman in Fame, Rafiki in The Lion King, and Matron Mama Morton in Chicago. During that period, she also originated the role of Killer Queen in the 2002 premiere of the Queen jukebox musical We Will Rock You, earning her first Olivier nomination for best performance in a supporting role in a musical.\n\nIn the later 2000s and early 2010s, Clarke furthered her British stage career in roles including Motormouth Maybelle in Hairspray, Asaka in Once on This Island (a role she first played in 1994), Davina the Diva Harp in Jack and the Beanstalk, and Carmina the Camel in Aladdin, among others.
