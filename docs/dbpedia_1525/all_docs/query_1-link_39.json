        "text": "In 2024, we really are getting some of the best true-crime podcasts ever. True-crime continues to be perhaps the most addictive podcast genre out there, bringing all the mystery and primal fear of a Law & Order episode directly into our ears (while also allowing us to catch up on the drama on the go.)\n\nSo, whether you’re already an obsessive or just wading into the world of cold cases and red herrings, here are Vogue’s picks for the best true-crime podcasts to try now.\n\nSerial\n\nYou can’t delve too deeply into the true-crime podcast genre without eventually reckoning with Serial, the Sarah Koenig-hosted series that was developed by the team behind This American Life and came under the New York Times’ ownership in 2020. All four seasons are worth checking out, but the first—which revolves around the 1999 killing of Korean-American high school student Hae Min Lee—hews the closest to true-crime, while also injecting a healthy dose of investigative journalism into the blurry territory of the case it covers.\n\nS-Town\n\nThis podcast from the producers of Serial has been out since 2017, but if you haven’t had the chance to catch up on it yet, let me assure you that the narrative holds up, even a handful of years later. In it, an Alabama horologist (i.e. time scientist) named John asks This American Life to investigate an alleged murder in his loathed hometown of Woodstock—the titular “shit town”—and ends up deeply affecting the staff of the show with his personal story. The moral center of the podcast may be questionable, as McLemore killed himself in 2015 while the podcast was still in production, but it makes for genuinely fascinating listening.\n\nSomeone Knows Something\n\nThe 2007 death of Angel Carlick is still actively being investigated, but in Someone Knows Something—a CBC podcast about the disappearance and murder of the 19-year-old from Canada’s Yukon territory, nicknamed “Happy-Go-Lucky” by her loved ones—Carlick’s life is eulogized and celebrated while investigator David Ridgen attempts to bring a sense of closure for Carlick’s surviving family.\n\nSistas Who Kill\n\nDescribed by hosts (and best friends) MaRah and Taz as “a true-crime podcast about Black Women told by Black Women,” this podcast shifts the lens through which true-crime is often filtered in order to spotlight how Black female perpetrators are mistreated by the criminal justice system. Among the cases considered is one involving former HBO actress Lakeyria Doughty, who in 2021 was accused of fatally stabbing of her girlfriend.\n\nLast Podcast on the Left\n\nTechnically, this series focuses on “all the horrors our world has to offer, both imagined and real,” but the body of work that hosts Marcus Parks, Ed Larson, and Henry Zebrowski have built up around real-life figures like Jeffrey Dahmer, Patty Hearst, and (more recently) Gypsy Rose Blanchard is impressive enough for Last Podcast on the Left to qualify as one of the very best in the true-crime genre.\n\nDirty John\n\nWe’ve never devoured a podcast as quickly as we did this one about an interior designer named Debra who meets a handsome, perfect-seeming doctor named John who claims to have just returned from volunteering with Doctors Without Borders in Iraq. As you might imagine, John isn’t quite who he claims to be, and at the risk of spoiling the at-times-unbelievable story that Dirty John chronicles, let us assure you that this one most definitely ends up falling into the true-crime category.\n\nCold\n\nHosted by investigative reporter Dave Cawley, each season of Cold focuses on a missing-persons case. First up is a retelling of Susan Powell’s disappearance in West Valley City, Utah, in 2009, for which Cawley corralls police documents, diary entries, and never-before-heard wiretapped audio.\n\nLOST HILLS: Dark Canyon\n\nThe death of Mitrice Richardson—a 24-year-old who was arrested by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department in 2009 for failing to pay her bill at a Malibu restaurant, and then disappeared shortly after her release—is given crucial context in this podcast from New Yorker writer Dana Goodyear, whose holistic deep-dive into “the dark side of Malibu, California” is not to be missed.\n\nUp and Vanished\n\nWhile the first season of this podcast revolves around the unsolved case of Tara Grinstead, a high school teacher and former pageant queen from South Georgia who was last seen in October 2005, the second—which is even better executed—focuses on the disappearance of Arizona native Kristal Reisinger, who vanished from what was described as a “full-moon drum circle” in Colorado in 2016 and hasn’t been seen since.\n\nDarkness: The Orange Door\n\nHosted by former University of Texas journalism students Tinu Thomas and Haley Butler, season one of Darkness tells the story of 21-year-old Jennifer Cave, who in August 2005 was set to start a new job. But when Jennifer’s boss called her mother, Sharon, to inquire about Jennifer’s whereabouts on her first day, Sharon knew something was wrong. Immediately, Jennifer’s parents began calling friends. When they still couldn’t locate her, they took matters into their own hands, and visited Jennifer’s friend Colton Pitonyak’s apartment within the Orange Tree Condominiums. They would find that Pitonyak wasn’t home—but on the other side of the door lay Jennifer’s brutally murdered body. As two women who walked the same campus paths that Jennifer had 15 years earlier, Thomas and Butler felt compelled to share Jennifer’s tragic story through exclusive interviews and transcripts from family, friends, and detectives—and their work is utterly absorbing.\n\nDark Downeast\n\nMaine! Connecticut! Massachusetts! In Dark Downeast, investigative journalist Kylie Low sheds light on cases—from unsolved murders to missing persons and survivor stories—in settings that one might otherwise associate with quaint, seaside getaways. Listeners hear from loved ones and detectives in detailed accounts that put the victim, and their legacy, at the heart of each story.\n\nBear Brook\n\nIt’s the summer of 1985, and we’re in the woods of New Hampshire—specifically, Bear Brook State Park. In the midst of an innocent game of hide and seek, three boys come across a barrel, which they decide to kick and knock over without looking inside.\n\nFifteen years later, a second barrel is found just 300 feet away from the first. The barrels’ contents lead to the discovery of four slain bodies: a woman and three young girls. Who are these victims? What happened, and why? New Hampshire Public Radio host Jason Moon delves into a decades-long cold case—ultimately uncovering a serial murderer.\n\nIn the Dark\n\nIn the Dark is back! The award-winning investigative-journalism podcast first made waves with its 2016 debut, when journalist Madeleine Baran and a team of reporters revisited the 1989 abduction of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling. For season two, Baran and team focused on the case of Curtis Flowers, a man who was tried six times for the same crime in Mississippi.\n\nIn its newly released third season, In the Dark joins The New Yorker to collaborate with writer Heidi Blake on a four-part series about the Dubai royal women who risked everything to flee Sheikh Mohammed.\n\nThe Apology Line\n\nIn the early 1980s, a phone number papers New York City’s streets, allowing strangers to spill their secrets via voicemail. Messages pour in, and for 15 years, what began as a social experiment takes on a life of its own. Those recordings, collected by Allan Bridge—known as Mr. Apology—are uncovered by Bridge’s second wife, Marissa, who lets listeners into what it means to be the keeper of secrets—and the toll that responsibility can take.\n\nBone Valley\n\nTo be candid, I’ve only just begun listening to this podcast, but like everyone else who’s learned of Leo Schofield’s conviction, I’ve become immediately hooked. In 1987, 18-year-old Michelle Schofield was found dead in Florida, and two years later, her husband Leo was convicted for the murder. However, fingerprints were discovered at the scene that would eventually match with Jeremy Scott, a man whose violent history includes armed robbery and assault. In just nine episodes, Gilbert King and Kelsey Decker re-examine Leo’s fight for justice and uncover new evidence that links Scott to a string of murders.\n\nWest Cork\n\nThis podcast tells the story of French film producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier, who was found dead near her holiday home in 1996. First recorded by Jennifer Forde and Sam Bungey in 2021 but still every bit as spine-tinglingly chilling today, West Cork takes the listener inside a tight-knit community in which suspicion is slowly beginning to attach itself to everyone. Many of the podcast’s guests have never spoken publicly before, including members of Toscan du Plantier’s family and locals still shaken by the circumstances surrounding her death.\n\nThe Lady Vanishes\n\nThe 1997 disappearance of Marion Barter, the former wife of Australian soccer great Johnny Warren, is the subject of this podcast. The bizarre circumstances of Barter’s disappearance (she was last seen getting on a plane for an overseas holiday) are closely reviewed, but the human resonance of the still-unexplained loss of a mother, teacher, and friend is deeply felt in every episode.\n\nDeath of an Artist\n\nEver since Havana-born artist Ana Mendieta fell to her death from the window of her 34th-floor Greenwich Village apartment in 1985, activists and fans have insisted that her husband, Carl Andre, was to blame. This six-episode podcast from Pushkin Industries is hosted by art historian Helen Molesworth, who provides context not only for Mendieta's death but for the extraordinary life she lived (and the body of artistic work she left behind).\n\nSuspect\n\nThis 2021 podcast follows the classic format of examining a specific cold case with painstaking detail. Here, it’s the unsolved murder of 24-year-old Arpana Jinaga, who was found strangled in her Washington State apartment in 2008 after a Halloween party in her building. Journalists Matthew Shaer and Eric Benson take listeners back to the night in question and through a trial, poring over the issues embedded in the case—from the misuse of DNA to the broken relationship between race and policing.\n\nCrime Junkie\n\nJust as the name suggests, hosts Ashley Flowers and Brit Prawat are obsessed with anything and everything related to true crime. Each week, they look into some of the most compelling (and mysterious) cases ever, including stories from the 1940s and more recent convictions. Below, Flowers and Prawat discuss the murder of Loren Donn Leslie, whose remains were found along Canada’s Highway of Tears, a 450-mile stretch of road where dozens of women, most of whom were Indigenous, have been known to vanish or be found murdered.\n\nThe Deck\n\nWith The Deck, Crime Junkie’s Ashley Flowers deals you in on some of the coldest unsolved cases. Flowers explains that for years, some law enforcement agencies have replaced the faces of traditional playing card decks with images of missing and murdered people. By distributing these new cards throughout prisons, investigators hope inmates might come forward with helpful information. Every week, The Deck sheds new light on a cold case like Jenny Linn (Queen of Hearts in California) or Ivory Green (Jack of Spades in New York), sharing stories from their loved ones and detailed interviews with detectives. The goal? Maybe somehow, somewhere, these “cards” end up in the right hands, and justice will finally be served for these victims.\n\nDown the Hill: The Delphi Murders\n\nOn Valentine’s Day in 2017, two teens, Liberty German, 14, and Abigail Williams, 13, were found murdered near a hiking trail in Delphi, Indiana, after going missing the day before. When police released a short audio clip believed to belong to the male suspect, it included only three words: “down the hill.” But the eerie voice, yet to be identified, was enough to make my hair stand on end. Here, the podcast breaks down the tragic story that continues to haunt Indiana today.\n\nThe Dropout\n\nWhile the shocking story of Elizabeth Holmes’s rise and fall as the founder of disgraced medical tech company Theranos has been retold across a number of platforms, few have captured her toxic mix of ambition and hubris as powerfully as ABC News podcast The Dropout. (It even served as the basis for the Emmy-nominated Hulu show starring Amanda Seyfreid.) An added bonus? The podcast’s host, Rebecca Jarvis, released a follow-up miniseries charting the developments around Holmes’s trail in California in 2022, which proved to be just as riveting as any John Grisham courtroom drama.\n\nThe Clearing\n\nThe Clearing offers an unexpected spin on the conventional true-crime podcast formula, with its central voice being not just an investigative reporter, Josh Dean, but also the daughter of the culprit, April Balascio, who tipped off police in 2009 after suspecting that her father was responsible for a spate of murders in the early 1980s. Charting both her father’s devastating crimes and the trauma he inflicted on his own family, besides the families of his victims, The Clearing is sensitive rather than sensationalist as it deals with this thorny subject, marking it out as a rarity in the world of true-crime reporting.\n\nDr. Death\n\nAnother podcast that proved so riveting it was quickly adapted into a TV series, Dr. Death charts the horrifying career of Christopher Duntsch, the now-imprisoned neurosurgeon who performed a series of disastrous operations on patients around the Dallas-Fort Worth area over several years, leaving 33 injured and many eithers maimed or paralyzed. Not only does the show offer insight into Duntsch’s sociopathy as he continued to cause harm, but it also highlights the dangers and dysfunctions within the American medical system. A warning: Some of the details of Duntsch’s malpractice veer into grisly territory, so it’s not a podcast for the squeamish or faint of heart.\n\nKiller Fun\n\nHosts Jackie, who holds a Master’s degree in Psychology from Harvard, and internet sleuth Christy are the brains behind Killer Fun. We love a well-researched podcast with lighthearted dialogue on topics ranging from hit shows to true crime. More merry than morbid, the episodes make for easy listening if you’re looking for something on the lighter side.\n\nLISK: Long Island Serial Killer\n\nFor two decades until 2010, an unidentified suspect murdered nearly a dozen people, mostly female sex workers, and left their bodies along a secluded stretch of Long Island’s Ocean Parkway. This podcast, inspired by the bestseller Lost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery, recalls the gruesome case with unheard interviews from family members, police, and more.\n\nMrBallen Podcast: Strange, Dark & Mysterious Stories\n\nNavy SEAL John Allen, better known as internet personality MrBallen, spills unsolved secrets on his weekly podcast. Following a near-death experience while serving in Afghanistan, MrBallen discovered a love for true crime, sharing podcasts on serial killers and strange disappearances. His no-holds-barred style is matter-of-fact, descriptive, and will get you hooked 30 seconds in. N.B.: the episodes aren’t for the faint of heart and come with warnings.\n\nMy Favorite Murder\n\nTrue-crime junkies who don’t take themselves too seriously should start here. MFM is a biweekly safe space for comedians/hosts Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark to break down the cases that keep them up at night, from the Golden State Killer to Black Dahlia and the Zodiac murders. The show’s devoted listeners, also known as “murderinos,” have made it one of the podcast world’s biggest hits, spawning a live show and a book: Stay Sexy & Don’t Get Murdered.\n\nMorbid: A True Crime Podcast\n\nBest friends Alaina Urquhart and Ashleigh Kelley have range: In addition to serial killers and mysterious deaths, they tackle other true-crime subgenres such as spooky myths, creepy history, and haunted places.\n\nRoot of Evil\n\nHosted by sisters Yvette Gentile and Rasha Pecoraro, Root of Evil takes a look back at one of the most infamous cases in the history of American crime: the Black Dahlia murder. But Gentile and Pecoraro’s interest in the case runs deeper than most. The great-granddaughters of one of the prime suspects, George Hodel, now believe that Hodel was indeed culpable; but alongside their investigations into the murder, they also look back at the effect the case had on their family, making this as much a tale of intergenerational trauma as it is a deep dive into the infamous murder of Elizabeth Short.\n\nThe Shrink Next Door\n\nA bizarre tale led by the charismatic host Joe Nocera, a New York Times journalist who decided to dive into the case after his psychotherapist neighbor, Ike Herschkopf, mysteriously disappeared, The Shrink Next Door looks at how therapy can go very, very wrong. Talking to a number of Herschkopf’s previous patients—among them Marty Markowitz, who vividly describes the way his therapy sessions spun out of control as Herschkopf began inserting himself into Markowitz’s life—the podcast’s many twist and turns make it as compelling as it is horrifying.\n\nScamanda\n\nAward-winning journalist Charlie Webster takes listeners on an emotional rollercoaster in this blockbuster podcast, following the bizarre but very real story of a woman named Amanda. After she was diagnosed with cancer, Amanda became an early influencer, documenting her illness through a popular blog. Her posts caught the eye of investigative producer Nancy where things start to unravel very quickly. Let’s just say when a story seems too good to be true, it usually is.\n\nSouthern Fried True Crime\n\nNative Tennessean Erica Kelley uncovers true crime stories of the Deep South in a series that almost feels like you’re sitting on a back porch somewhere, hearing the latest local gossip. Kelley’s southern twang adds to the ambiance, bringing small-town crimes to light while also laying bare “how southern fried the justice system can be.”\n\nTom Brown’s Body\n\nThe tiny city of Canadian, Texas is the backdrop for this narrative podcast—hosted by Skip Hollandsworth of the award-winning Texas Monthly magazine—about the 2016 disappearance of a popular high school senior. When Brown’s remains are found two years later, everyone in the Panhandle community is a suspect (as the true-crime cliché goes), including members of Brown’s own family.\n\nTrue Crime Obsessed\n\nConsuming too much true crime can leave you desperately in need of a comedic pick-me-up. That’s where the hilarious, theater-loving duo Patrick Hinds and Gillian Pensavalle come in. Without ever making fun of the actual crime, the cohosts recap popular true-crime documentaries, from Tiger King to Making a Murderer, with a much-needed lighthearted, sassy twist. Listen to their take on I.D.’s The Atlanta Child Murders, which covers the nearly 30 Black children who disappeared or were murdered in Atlanta during the early ’80s.\n\nWhite Lies\n\nThis devastating podcast from NPR, which looks back to the 1965 murder of Reverend James Reeb—a white pastor involved in the civil rights movement—in Selma, Alabama, is a powerful window into the secrets and unspoken truths of race relations in the American South. A finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in audio reporting, White Lies is a masterful work of audio journalism broaching subject matter that still feels depressingly relevant in the age of Black Lives Matter.\n\nWelcome to Your Fantasy\n\nMurder meets G-strings in historian Natalia Petrzela’s eight-episode dive into the sordid, largely unknown story “behind the powerful mullets, oiled pecs, and non-stop parties” of the Chippendales dancers. The twisted tale tracks how mastermind Steve Banerjee built the male revue into a phenomenon—and how drugs, greed and crime tore it all down.\n\nYour Own Backyard"
