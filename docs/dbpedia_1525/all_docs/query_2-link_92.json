Also she wouldn’t have time to dye her hair back since she’s in jail… lol\n\nI don’t think bleaching hair dye is on the approved list of items an inmate an purchase in jail.\n\nThat could be used as a weapon in the pen!\n\nQuote PhylFan: I like her hair color better with the darker hue, hope she keeps it.\n\nICAM Looks so much healthier and just does so much more for her complexion and face. She looks younger too. Love the cinnamon hue\n\nI hope she keeps it too. That colour looks terrific on her!\n\nRemember all the threads about Patti’s hair and how we were all trying to figure out what colour HER roots were?\n\nLOL, who said blond was her natural color… That could be why she didn’t need touch ups during her time on the ranch…\n\n(i mean the character, not the actress…)\n\nQuote PurrrrrrrKitty: I read an article by Sharon Case saying.... her hair color will become lighter and lighter as she becomes Sharon and returns to her normal life...\n\n“As she becomes Sharon” LMAO!!! Wait…wasn’t she ALWAYS Sharon…or did she automatically change into Sheri in more than just name?\n\nSo then if I want to be someone else or look like someone else…all I have to do is change my name?\n\nOK…my name is Kim Kardashian!!!\n\nWas it just me or did Sharon’s hair look nicer when she was being “Sherri”… it was more styled and polished… not stringy and all in her face aha."
