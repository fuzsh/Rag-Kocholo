        "text": "Antonio Brown as Hippo\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1\n\nThis NFL player entered “Masked Singer” history when he became the first costumed celebrity to be unmasked in front of America. Brown stumped all four judges after his wacky performance of “My Prerogative” by Bobby Brown.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Odell Beckham Jr.\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Deion Sanders\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Deion Sanders\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Allen Iverson\n\nTommy Chong as Pineapple\n\nSeason 1, Episode 2\n\nThis comedic legend said he’s willing to do “anything to get on stage,” and dressing up in a costume while singing “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor was not beneath him. Chong left all four judges up in smoke, although Jenny came close by guessing his frequent co-star, Cheech Marin.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Sugar Ray Lenoard\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Cheech Marin\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Jimmy Buffett\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Kid Rock\n\nTerry Bradshaw as Deer\n\nSeason 1, Episode 3\n\nThis NFL Hall of Famer won four Super Bowl titles as the quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers, but it was when he suited up as the Deer and serenaded viewers with “Get Your Shine On” by Florida Georgia Line that he revealed his hidden singing talent. Despite being known for his prowess on the playing field and not his voice, Bradshaw only fooled half of the judging panel.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Terry Bradshaw\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Peyton Manning\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: John Elway\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Terry Bradshaw\n\nMargaret Cho as Poodle\n\nSeason 1, Episode 4\n\nThis Emmy and Grammy nominated comedian was not joking around when she belted out “Time After Time” by Cyndi Lauper, leaving the judges completely confused about her identity. Although Cho was the singer unmasked, it was Ken who left with his tail between his legs after he failed to guess his own co-star from “Dr. Ken” was hiding inside the Poodle costume.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Judge Judy\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Kathy Griffin\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Melissa Rivers\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Jillian Michaels\n\nTori Spelling as Unicorn\n\nSeason 1, Episode 5\n\nThis former teen star from “Beverly Hills 90210” and frequent tabloid headliner took advantage of the anonymity Unicorn provided her while she pranced around the stage singing “I Love It” by Icona Pop. In a rare occurrence, Ken was the only judge able to pin down the Unicorn’s identity before Spelling was unmasked.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Gabby Douglas\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Lauren Conrad\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Tori Spelling\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Denise Richards\n\nRicki Lake as Raven\n\nSeason 1, Episode 6\n\nThis actress and Emmy-winning talk show host went through an emotional journey on “The Masked Singer” as she re-emerged into the public eye after the heartbreaking death of her ex-husband. In Lake’s last performance she sang “Brave” by Sarah Bareilles and her clues hinting at being a talk show host were enough to put one panelist on the right track.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Ricki Lake\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Raven-Symone\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Sheryl Underwood\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Meghan McCain\n\nLa Toya Jackson as Alien\n\nSeason 1, Episode 7\n\n“Thank you so much for supporting me [and] supporting the Alien,” La Toya Jackson said after her dramatic unmasking in the seventh episode of “The Masked Singer.” Backstage after the show wrapped, La Toya said, “This experience was absolutely fabulous. It was wonderful. I enjoyed every single moment of it. It felt wonderful being anonymous. I’m glad that people got the chance to see a different side of my personality.”\n\nRobin’s final guess: La Toya Jackson\n\nJenny’s final guess: Sofia Richie\n\nKen’s final guess: Paula Abdul\n\nNicole’s final guess: La Toya Jackson\n\nRumer Willis as Lion\n\nSeason 1, Episode 8\n\nThis Hollywood starlet and eldest daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore wowed the panel week after week with her surprisingly strong vocals. She may have been eliminated earlier than anyone expected, but her rendition of “Don’t You Worry ‘Bout a Thing” by Stevie Wonder stumped all the judges.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Michelle Williams\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Kelly Rowland\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Dawn Robinson\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Hailee Steinfeld\n\nJoey Fatone as Rabbit\n\nSeason 1, Episode 8\n\nBest known as a member of the megastar boy band NSYNC, Fatone will be remembered for never breaking character as the neurotic, twitchy Rabbit. In “The Masked Singer,” Fatone proved he is capable of taking the lead vocal, but after his rendition of “My Girl” by The Temptations, the panel was on to him.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Joey Fatone\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Donnie Wahlberg\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Kevin Richardson\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Joey Fatone\n\nGladys Knight as Bee\n\nSeason 1 Finale (Third Place)\n\nThis legendary soul diva belted her way into the Season 1 finale and relished the ability to put her spin on modern classics like “Wrecking Ball” by Miley Cyrus. For Knight’s final performance she sang “I Can’t Make You Love Me” by Bonnie Raitt and by that point her unmistakable tone was just too obvious to fool the judges (well, except Ken).\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Gladys Knight\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Glady Knight\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Anita Baker\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Gladys Knight\n\nDonny Osmond as Peacock\n\nSeason 1 Finale (Runner-up)\n\nThis American icon and former teen idol wasn’t afraid to “Shake a Tail Feather” as he rocked the house to the hit song by The Five Du-Tones. Osmond managed to sing his way to second place in the first season of “The Masked Singer” while befuddling all but one judge.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Weird Al Yankovic\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Donny Osmond\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Neil Patrick Harris\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Neil Patrick Harris\n\nT-Pain as Monster\n\nSeason 1 Finale (Winner)\n\nThis chart-topping rapper and hit-making producer made history as the first winner of “The Masked Singer.” As the Monster, T-Pain was able to put his singing prowess at the forefront while keeping his identity hidden until the very end. Unfortunately, none of the judges were able to correctly pinpoint his true persona.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Jamie Foxx\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Michael Vick\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Darius Rucker\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: CeeLo Green\n\nJohnny Weir as Egg\n\nSeason 2, Episode 1\n\nThis two-time Olympic figure skater and fashion designer sizzled as the Egg singing “Just Dance” by Lady Gaga. Despite not being a professional singer, his clues and flamboyant style were enough for half the panel to guess his identity. Weir was the first eliminated from Season 2.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Johnny Weir\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Johnny Weir\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Jonathan Van Ness\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Christian Siriano\n\nTyler ‘Ninja’ Blevins as Ice Cream\n\nSeason 2, Episode 1\n\nThis professional YouTuber, gamer and internet personality confused everyone as the funky Ice Cream singing “Old Town Road” by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus. He became the second contestant eliminated after just one performance on Season 2, leaving the panelists totally stumped.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: DeadMau5\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Rob Dyrdek\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: PewDiePie\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Marshmallow\n\nLaila Ali as Panda\n\nSeason 2, Episode 2\n\nThis former professional boxer and daughter of the legendary Muhammad Ali shocked everyone when she unmasked following an energetic performance of “Stronger (What Doesn’t Kill You)” by Kelly Clarkson. Ali may have been undefeated in the boxing ring, but she lasted just one episode in “The Masked Singer.”\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Loni Love\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Wanda Sykes\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Queen Latifah\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Venus Williams\n\nDr. Drew Pinsky as Eagle\n\nSeason 2, Episode 3\n\nThis television personality and addiction specialist left everyone guessing when he belted out “I’d Do Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That)” by Meat Loaf. Pinski has been known to work with rock stars, but learned the profession of many of his clients isn’t as easy as it looks.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Howard Stern\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Adam Corolla\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Craig Ferguson\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Jeff Foxworthy\n\nPaul Shaffer as Skeleton\n\nSeason 2, Episode 4\n\nThis singer, composer, actor and comedian was tired of being known for playing second fiddle to “Late Show” host David Letterman and branched out to entertain the masses on “The Masked Singer.” After his performance of “Are You Gonna Be My Girl” by Jet, half the panel pegged Shaffer as the Skeleton.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Paul Shaffer\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Paul Shaffer\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Martin Short\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Raymond Teller\n\nSherri Shepherd as Penguin\n\nSeason 2, Episode 5\n\nThis actress, comedian and former co-host on “The View” dodged early correct guesses of her identity and by the time Shepherd rocked the house to “All About That Bass” by Meghan Trainor the entire panel was confused. Despite having suspicions in earlier weeks, even Jenny couldn’t guess her former co-star was hiding underneath the Penguin mask.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Mindy Kaling\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Nicole Byer\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Wanda Sykes\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Starr Jones\n\nRaven-Symone as Black Widow\n\nSeason 2, Episode 6\n\nThis comedic actress, singer and rapper was thrilled to enterain audiences anonymously after being in the spotlight since she was a child star on “The Cosby Show.” Following an inspirational performance of “Believe” by Cher, Symone was unmasked after half the judging panel guessed her identity.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Raven-Symone\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Amber Riley\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Miranda Lambert\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Raven-Symone\n\nKelly Osbourne as Ladybug\n\nSeason 2, Episode 7\n\nThis television personality and daughter of Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne felt empowered in her Ladybug mask after years of being insecure. Osbourne showed off a rock edge, singing “Youngblood” by 5 Seconds of Summer and was none too thrilled when most of the judging panel thought she was Lindsay Lohan.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Lindsay Lohan\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Paris Jackson\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Lindsay Lohan\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Jamie Lynn Spears\n\nPatti LaBelle as Flower\n\nSeason 2, Episode 8\n\nThis powerhouse diva was instantly recognized for her unique, legendary tone. The Grammy-winning singer fooled almost no one, but Ken remained adamant Bjork was under the Flower mask, even after LaBelle’s final performance of “Eye of the Tiger” by Survivor.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Patti LaBelle\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Patti LaBelle\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Bjork\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Patti LaBelle\n\nMichelle Williams as Butterfly\n\nSeason 2, Episode 9\n\nThis gospel singer and member of the iconic girl group Destiny’s Child used “The Masked Singer” as a form of therapy, re-emerging into the limelight after a difficult year. Throughout the season she played with various genres of music, but following her performance of “Sorry Not Sorry” by Demi Lovato, the panel of judges had no question it was Williams (well, except Ken).\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Michelle Williams\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Michelle Williams\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Mel B\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Michelle Williams\n\nAna Gasteyer as Tree\n\nSeason 2, Episode 10\n\nThis hilarious actress and “Saturday Night Live” alum proved her voice was no joke as she belted out “The Edge of Glory” by Lady Gaga. Her bizarre Christmas references and powerful vocals confused the panel for weeks, but she wasn’t able to hide her identity for long and half the panel pegged Gasteyer as the Tree.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Amy Sedaris\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Ana Gasteyer\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Bebe Neuwirth\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Amy Sedaris\n\nVictor Oladipo as Thingamajig\n\nSeason 2, Episode 11\n\nThis NBA All-Star showed off his hidden musical talents on “The Masked Singer” and developed a flirtatious relationship with Nicole, who he brought to tears with his voice. Perhaps more shocking than Oladipo’s voice was the fact that Ken was the only judge to guess his true identity following a performance of “Winter Wonderland” by Bing Crosby.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Montell Jordan\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Paul George\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Victor Oladipo\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Markelle Fultz\n\nSeal as Leopard\n\nSeason 2, Episode 11\n\nNobody on “The Masked Singer” seemed to have more fun getting into character than Seal as the eccentric, royal Leopard. His act threw the panel off for weeks before Seal’s identiry became apparent after his performance of “Big Spender” by Shirley Bassey.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Seal\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Eric Benet\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Jeff Goldblum\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Seal\n\nAdrienne Bailon as Flamingo\n\nSeason 2 Finale (Third Place)\n\nThis singer and Emmy-winning co-host of “The Real” had taken a break from singing and admitted to being insecure about the sound of her own voice. Her confidence grew each week as the panel gave her encouraging compliments and she managed to make it all the way to the finale. Bailon finished in third place after a scorching hot performance of “Proud Mary” by Tina Turner.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Adrienne Bailon\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Adrienne Bailon\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Jessica Simpson\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Adrienne Bailon\n\nChris Daughtry as Rottweiler\n\nSeason 2 Finale (Runner-up)\n\nThis multi-platinum rock singer was no stranger to reality singing competitions after finishing in fourth place on Season 5 of “American Idol.” Hoping to prove he had more musical versatility than his career has shown so far, Daughtry threw on the Rottweiler mask and made it all the way to the finale, finishing in second place. Following his final performance of “Alive” by Sia, the panel still had no clue Daughtry was hiding under the mask.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Darren Criss\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Jason Mraz\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Dave Franco\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Darren Criss\n\nWayne Brady as Fox\n\nSeason 2 Finale (Winner)\n\nThis five-time Emmy winner, comedian and Broadway star had developed a plan from day one to confuse the panel and lead them to believe he was Jamie Foxx. As the weeks passed by, Brady wowed viewers with his voice, dance moves and charisma as the Fox. Following his final performance of “Try a Little Tenderness” by Otis Redding, Brady won the Golden Mask and became the Season 2 champion.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Wayne Brady\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Jamie Foxx\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Jamie Foxx\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Wayne Brady\n\nLil Wayne as Robot\n\nSeason 3, Episode 1\n\nThis five-time Grammy-winning rapper left jaws on the floor when he was unmasked as the Robot during the Season 3 premiere. Rather than rap, Wayne showed a lesser known side of himself, rocking out to “Are You Gonna Go My Way” by Lenny Kravitz. The panel had no clue Wayne was behind the mask and called it the most shocking reveal to date.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Shaun White\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Johnny Knoxville\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Flavor Flav\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Floyd Mayweather\n\nDrew Carey as Llama\n\nSeason 3, Episode 2\n\nThis actor, comedian and game show host had everyone guessing as he pranced around crooning “It’s Not Unusual” by Tom Jones in a llama suit. The panel couldn’t believe the host of “The Price is Right” was behind the mask, but Carey admitted he wanted to do the show “for a laugh.”\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Adam Carolla\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Kelsey Grammar\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Joel McHale\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Woody Harrelson\n\nChaka Khan as Miss Monster\n\nSeason 3, Episode 3\n\nThis 10-time Grammy winner is known as the Queen of Funk, she but toned things down in hopes of fooling the judges on “The Masked Singer.” After a dramatic performance of “You Don’t Own Me” by Lesley Gore, half of the panel recognized her iconic voice before she was unmasked.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Chaka Khan\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Queen Latifah\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Reba McEntire\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Chaka Khan\n\nTony Hawk as Elephant\n\nSeason 3, Episode 4\n\nThis X Games legend and stuntman is the last person most viewers expected to see in a singing competition, which is why none of the judges could figure out he was belting out the ’90s classic “Friday I’m in Love” by The Cure. Hawk admitted to joining the show to have some fun and sang a song by The Cure in honor of his wife.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Travis Pastrana\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Lance Armstrong\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Beto O’Rourke\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: DJ Steve Aoki\n\nDionne Warwick as Mouse\n\nSeason 3, Episode 5\n\nThis R&B Hall of Fame singer “had a ball” playing dress up as the elegant Mouse, but her unmistakable voice made it easy for the judges to guess her identity (well, except Ken). With 56 songs charting on the Billboard Hot 100 to her credit, it is no wonder why almost everyone knew Warwick was singing “This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)” by Natalie Cole from behind the mask.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Dionne Warwick\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Dionne Warwick\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Tina Turner\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Dionne Warwick\n\nTom Bergeron as Taco\n\nSeason 3, Episode 6\n\nThis Emmy-winning host and comedian was flabbergasted he was able to fool the entire judging panel on “The Masked Singer” – especially considering Nicole had been on “Dancing with the Stars” and Jenny wrote a blurb on the cover of one of his books. Nonetheless, Bergeron shocked everyone when he removed the mask from his Taco suit following a performance of “Can’t Help Myself” by The Four Tops.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Martin Short\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Jerry Springer\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Martin Short\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Barry Manilow\n\nSarah Palin as Bear\n\nSeason 3, Episode 7\n\n“This is something our country needs right now,” Palin expressed after removing her Bear mask and hearing a collective gasp from the studio audience on “The Masked Singer.” The judges were absolutely gobsmacked when the former governor of Alaska and Vice Presidential candidate revealed herself to be the zany creature singing “Baby Got Back” by Sir Mix-a-Lot. Palin admitted it’s the weirdest thing she’s ever done.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Tina Fey\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Candace Cameron-Bure\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Jodie Sweetin\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Christina Applegate\n\nBella Thorne as Swan\n\nSeason 3, Episode 8\n\nThis actress and former child model rocked the house to “I Hate Myself For Loving You” by Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and despite giving a shoutout to Ken during her performance, nobody had any clue who she was. Thorne co-starred with Ken in “The Duff” and became the second former co-star of his he failed to recognize on “The Masked Singer.”\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Nina Dobrev\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Kristen Stewart\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Olivia Munn\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Megan Fox\n\nJoJo Siwa as T-Rex\n\nSeason 3, Episode 9\n\nThis young singer, dancer and YouTube star brought an unprecedented amount of energy to her T-Rex character. Whatever she lacked in vocals she more than compensated for with her dynamic presence, but she was still sent packing following her performance of “Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)” by A.R. Rahman & The Pussycat Dolls.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: JoJo Siwa\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: JoJo Siwa\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Liza Koshy\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: JoJo Siwa\n\nRob Gronkowski as White Tiger\n\nSeason 3, Episode 10\n\nThis three-time Super Bowl champion for the New England Patriots brought his passion and unorthodox dance moves to the stage, making it all the way to the Super 9 of Season 3 despite having no musical skills. Gronkowski’s last performance of “I’m Too Sexy” by Right Said Fred was enough for half the judging panel to guess his identity.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Rob Gronkowski\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Rob Gronkowski\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: J.J. Watt\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Jon Cena\n\nJordyn Woods as Kangaroo\n\nSeason 3, Episode 11\n\nThis plus size supermodel and former bestie to billionaire Kylie Jenner made a splash as the feisty, yet sexy Kangaroo. Following a year of bad press, Woods hoped to show the world a different side of herself and impressed audiences with a voice she didn’t even know she had. Woods was unmasked after her performance of “No Air” by Jordin Sparks and Jenny was the only judge who guessed her identity.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: La La Anthony\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Jordyn Woods\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Cat Deeley\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Blac Chyna\n\nBret Michaels as Banana\n\nSeason 3, Episode 12\n\nFor weeks the panelists were convinced the yellow fruit was actually a blue collar comedian, naming Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall and even Larry the Cable Guy. But when Banana revealed he didn’t have a background in comedy, Jenny (and soon two other judges) shifted focus to Michaels.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Bret Michaels\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Bret Michaels\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Brad Paisley\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Bret Michaels\n\nHunter Hayes as Astronaut\n\nSeason 3, Episode 13\n\nThe renowned country singer hid his true identity by taking on all other music genres, but Nicole wasn’t fooled. She was the only panelist who knew Hayes was hiding inside the Astronaut costume thanks in part to a “birthday party” clue she realized was a Fourth of July concert in which they performed together.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Jonathan Taylor Thomas\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Ben Platt\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Skylar Astin\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Hunter Hayes\n\nJackie Evancho as Kitty\n\nSeason 3, Episode 14\n\nNo one was more shocked to see Evancho hiding behind the Kitty mask than Nick, who first met her 10 years earlier when she was a finalist on “America’s Got Talent.” Evancho decided to put on the sultry costume so that people would see a different side of her now that she’s all grown up.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Ashley Tisdale\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Lea Michele\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Anna Kendrick\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Vanessa Hudgens\n\nBarry Zito as Rhino\n\nSeason 3, Episode 15\n\nStop the presses! For the first time in Season 3, Ken correctly guessed the identity of the unmasked singer. Of course, he stole Jenny’s guess from weeks earlier, but that didn’t really matter in the long run. Ken was convinced after a “JAG” clue pointed to Zito being a guest star on CBS’s Navy drama, of which Ken was a superfan.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Trace Adkins\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Barry Zito\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Barry Zito\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Jason Aldean\n\nBow Wow as Frog\n\nSeason 3 Finale (Third Place)\n\nDespite being a front-runner all season long, this rapping and hip-hopping amphibian had to settle for third place in the grand finale. Two of the panelists correctly guessed Bow Wow’s true identity, while the other two were ribbittingly wrong.\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Bow Wow\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Lil’ Romeo\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Kid Cudi\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Bow Wow\n\nJesse McCartney as Turtle\n\nSeason 3 Finale (Runner-up)\n\nThroughout the season the panelists’ guesses included every boy band member known to man, but in the end it proved to be singer-songwriter McCartney. One of the physical clues, a photo album, notably teased the heartthrob’s early career as an actor on soap opera “All My Children.”\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Adam Lambert\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Jesse McCartney\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Nick Jonas\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Jesse McCartney\n\nKandi Burruss as Night Angel\n\nSeason 3 Finale (Winner)\n\nAt long last, the winner of the third Golden Mask was revealed to be business mogul/Grammy-winning songwriter/realty TV star Burruss. “It feels incredible!” said the show’s first-ever female winner. “For a long time I really stopped singing by myself … and I really appreciate you guys for helping me build my confidence back up.”\n\nRobin Thicke’s final guess: Kandi Burruss\n\nJenny McCarthy’s final guess: Kandi Burruss\n\nKen Jeong’s final guess: Tisha Campbell\n\nNicole Scherzinger’s final guess: Taraji P. Henson\n\nBusta Rhymes as Dragon\n\nSeason 4, Episode 1\n\nDespite the rapper having an identifiably gravelly voice, he fooled half of the panelists, with only Robin Thicke and Nicole Scherzinger guessing correctly. “I felt like I was in an oxygen tank without oxygen,” Busta Rhymes declared in his post-show interview.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Busta Rhymes\n\nRobin’s final guess: Busta Rhymes\n\nJenny’s first impression: Adrian Peterson\n\nJenny’s final guess: DMX\n\nKen’s first impression: Marshawn Lynch\n\nKen’s final guess: Michael Phelps\n\nNicole’s first impression: Busta Rhymes\n\nNicole’s final guess: Busta Rhymes\n\nMickey Rourke as Gremlin\n\nSeason 4, Episode 2\n\nIn a “Masked Singer” first, Mickey Rourke decided he was too hot inside the costume and so he self-eliminated before the voting process even began. Amazingly, Jenny McCarthy still guessed the raspy-voiced actor correctly. Unfortunately, Nicole Scherzinger didn’t even get to guess because Rourke removed his mask beforehand.\n\nRobin’s first impression: N/A\n\nRobin’s final guess: Jerry Lee Lewis\n\nJenny’s first impression: Mickey Rourke\n\nJenny’s final guess: Mickey Rourke\n\nKen’s first impression: N/A\n\nKen’s final guess: Steve Austin\n\nNicole’s first impression: N/A\n\nNicole’s final guess: N/A\n\nBrian Austin Green as Giraffe\n\nSeason 4, Episode 3\n\nEven though Brian Austin Green was childhood friends with Robin Thicke, the judge failed to guess his secret identity. Guest panelist Joel McHale came the closest when he thought the Giraffe was actually “Beverly Hills 90210” star Jason Priestley.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Jaleel White\n\nRobin’s final guess: Travis Barker\n\nJenny’s first impression: Travis Barker\n\nJenny’s final guess: Seth Green\n\nKen’s first impression: Will.I.Am\n\nKen’s final guess: Shia LaBeouf\n\nNicole’s first impression: Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nNicole’s final guess: Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nMark Sanchez as Baby Alien\n\nSeason 4, Episode 4\n\nThis character made “Masked Singer” history as the first-ever puppet to take the stage. Mark Sanchez, a retired NFL quarterback and current sports commentator, was officially one of the most shocking reveals of all time, as the panelists were mostly convinced Baby Alien was a stand-up comedian.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Triumph the Insult Comic Dog\n\nRobin’s final guess: Jason Biggs\n\nJenny’s first impression: Ralph Macchio\n\nJenny’s final guess: Nick Kroll\n\nKen’s first impression: Matt LeBlanc\n\nKen’s final guess: Freddie Prinze Jr.\n\nNicole’s first impression: David Schwimmer\n\nNicole’s final guess: Jeff Dunham\n\nWendy Williams as Lips\n\nSeason 4, Episode 5\n\nAfter being eliminated on her first appearance, the infamous talk show host admitted she couldn’t sing and couldn’t dance, but that she knew “how to have fun.” The two female panelists immediately recognized Wendy Williams’ trademark voice and laugh, while the two male judges were swayed by some of the clues and guessed incorrectly.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Sandra Bernhard\n\nRobin’s final guess: Sandra Bernhard\n\nJenny’s first impression: Wendy Williams\n\nJenny’s final guess: Wendy Williams\n\nKen’s first impression: Mariah Carey\n\nKen’s final guess: Allison Janney\n\nNicole’s first impression: Wendy Williams\n\nNicole’s final guess: Wendy Williams\n\nBob Saget as Squiggly Monster\n\nSeason 4, Episode 6\n\nFor the first time in Season 4, Ken Jeong correctly guessed a contestant’s true identity … and it’s all thanks to Bob Saget. The comedian and TV star was almost unanimously chosen by the panel as the Squiggly Monster, with Nicole Scherzinger being the only holdout as she thought it was “Veep” star Gary Cole instead.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Bob Saget\n\nRobin’s final guess: Bob Saget\n\nJenny’s first impression: Bob Saget\n\nJenny’s final guess: Bob Saget\n\nKen’s first impression: Fabio\n\nKen’s final guess: Bob Saget\n\nNicole’s first impression: Ying Yang Twins\n\nNicole’s final guess: Gary Cole\n\nClint Black, Lisa Hartman Black as Snow Owls\n\nSeason 4, Episode 7\n\n“The Masked Singer” history was made when two people took the stage at the same time in a double costume. The panelists were on the right track that a pair of country singers were hiding inside the Snow Owls egg, but only Nicole Scherzinger correctly guessed Clint Black and Lisa Hartman Black.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Amy Grant & Vince Gill\n\nRobin’s final guess: Amy Grant & Vince Gill\n\nJenny’s first impression: Maureen McCormick & Barry Williams\n\nJenny’s final guess: Amy Grant & Vince Gill\n\nKen’s first impression: Derek Hough & Julianne Hough\n\nKen’s final guess: Danny DeVito & Rhea Perlman\n\nNicole’s first impression: Donny Osmond & Marie Osmond\n\nNicole’s final guess: Clint Black & Lisa Hartman Black\n\nLonzo Ball as Whatchamacallit\n\nSeason 4, Episode 8\n\nThe first of the night’s double eliminations was NBA player Lonzo Ball, who claimed he did the show because it’s one of his mom’s favorites. The panelists thought the hairy monster might be a sports star, but only Ken Jeong correctly named Lonzo Ball because of a “triple B” clue.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Tyler the Creator\n\nRobin’s final guess: Michael Strahan\n\nJenny’s first impression: Winston Duke\n\nJenny’s final guess: Devin Booker\n\nKen’s first impression: Damian Lillard\n\nKen’s final guess: Lonzo Ball\n\nNicole’s first impression: Uncle It\n\nNicole’s final guess: Carmelo Anthony\n\nDr. Elvis Francois as Serpent\n\nSeason 4, Episode 8\n\nAs for the second elimination of this episode, Nicole Scherzinger was able to guess the viral YouTube doctor’s true identity when he hissed that he’d sung with one of the panelists before. Nicole and Dr. Elvis had previously performed “Rise Up” together in an episode of “After the Mask.”\n\nRobin’s first impression: Wanya Morris\n\nRobin’s final guess: Donald Faison\n\nJenny’s first impression: John Legend\n\nJenny’s final guess: Taye Diggs\n\nKen’s first impression: Usher\n\nKen’s final guess: Daveed Diggs\n\nNicole’s first impression: Okieriete Onaodowan\n\nNicole’s final guess: Dr. Elvis Francois\n\nPaul Anka as Broccoli\n\nSeason 4, Episode 9\n\nThe veteran singer and songwriter of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” stumped all of the judges except for Robin Thicke, who just happened to be a fellow Canadian. Paul Anka was the last contestant to be unmasked before the show moved on to the Super Six stage of the competition.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Bob Newhart\n\nRobin’s final guess: Paul Anka\n\nJenny’s first impression: Jerry Springer\n\nJenny’s final guess: Neil Sedaka\n\nKen’s first impression: Martin Short\n\nKen’s final guess: Ringo Starr\n\nNicole’s first impression: Bill Murray\n\nNicole’s final guess: Wayne Newton\n\nTaylor Dayne as Popcorn\n\nSeason 4, Episode 10\n\nJenny McCarthy grew up listening to Taylor Dayne records, which is how she knew the legendary singer was hiding inside the buttery Popcorn costume. “You guys made me cry under this mask,” the emotional artist said during her exit interview with Nick Cannon.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Tina Turner\n\nRobin’s final guess: Tina Turner\n\nJenny’s first impression: Tina Turner\n\nJenny’s final guess: Taylor Dayne\n\nKen’s first impression: Tina Turner\n\nKen’s final guess: Tina Turner\n\nNicole’s first impression: Diana Ross\n\nNicole’s final guess: Taylor Dayne\n\nChloe Kim as Jellyfish\n\nSeason 4, Episode 10\n\nChloe Kim had all of the panelists laughing when she told a story about sliding into Ken Jeong’s DMs two years earlier and being “left on delivered.” Ken responded he was going to go home and respond to her right away because the Olympian snowboarder is such a heroic figure in his household.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Addison Rae\n\nRobin’s final guess: Gabby Douglas\n\nJenny’s first impression: Daisy Ridley\n\nJenny’s final guess: McKayla Maroney\n\nKen’s first impression: Yara Shahidi\n\nKen’s final guess: Chloe Kim\n\nNicole’s first impression: Sofia Richie\n\nNicole’s final guess: Grimes\n\nTori Kelly as Seahorse\n\nSeason 4, Episode 10\n\nAll of the clues about previously appearing on a singing competition show are what convinced Robin Thicke and Nicole Scherzinger to name this former “American Idol” contestant as their final pick. “I feel more like an entertainer now,” Tori Kelly proclaimed after being unmasked as the colorful Seahorse.\n\nRobin’s first impression: JoJo\n\nRobin’s final guess: Tori Kelly\n\nJenny’s first impression: Halsey\n\nJenny’s final guess: Halsey\n\nKen’s first impression: Fergie\n\nKen’s final guess: Christina Aguilera\n\nNicole’s first impression: Maren Morris\n\nNicole’s final guess: Tori Kelly\n\nNick Carter as Crocodile\n\nSeason 4 Finale (Third Place)\n\nThe latest boy band alum to grace the stage was Nick Carter of Backstreet Boys fame. The panelists all guessed different 90s stars, but Jenny McCarthy hit the nail on the head when she named Nick Carter. With four correct first impression guesses in Season 4, Jenny was later awarded the Golden Ear trophy.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Jordan Knight\n\nRobin’s final guess: Howie D\n\nJenny’s first impression: Nick Carter\n\nJenny’s final guess: Nick Carter\n\nKen’s first impression: Bradley Cooper\n\nKen’s final guess: Nick Lachey\n\nNicole’s first impression: Nick Lachey\n\nNicole’s final guess: Jordan Knight\n\nAloe Blacc as Mushroom\n\nSeason 4 Finale (Runner-up)\n\nYou may know his voice from hit singles “Wake Me Up” and “I Need a Dollar,” but not many people knew Aloe Blacc’s name before his unmasking. The soul/R&B singer credits his daughter with giving him inspiration for how to act in his Mushroom get-up. “It’s not a skirt! This is a mushroom stem,” he said about his flowing costume.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Billy Porter\n\nRobin’s final guess: Aloe Blacc\n\nJenny’s first impression: Maxwell\n\nJenny’s final guess: Ne-Yo\n\nKen’s first impression: Justin Timberlake\n\nKen’s final guess: Pharrell Williams\n\nNicole’s first impression: Donald Glover\n\nNicole’s final guess: Aloe Blacc\n\nLeAnn Rimes as Sun\n\nSeason 4 Finale (Winner)\n\nHow fitting that Sun won the Golden Mask — after all, this shining star was the first contestant to perform this fourth season and set the bar extremely high with her “Cuz I Love You” cover. Throughout the competition the panelists threw out all kinds of guesses, but in the end both Jenny McCarthy and Nicole Scherzinger guessed Sun was actually child singer LeAnn Rimes.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Natasha Bedingfield\n\nRobin’s final guess: Katharine McPhee\n\nJenny’s first impression: Demi Lovato\n\nJenny’s final guess: LeAnn Rimes\n\nKen’s first impression: Gwyneth Paltrow\n\nKen’s final guess: Mandy Moore\n\nNicole’s first impression: Katharine McPhee\n\nNicole’s final guess: LeAnn Rimes\n\nKermit the Frog as Snail\n\nSeason 5, Episode 1\n\nThe fifth season of “TMS” promised to be a “game-changer” and it did not disappoint. Nobody could have predicted the infamous green Muppet was hiding inside the Snail costume, which led to one of the most shocking reveals in the show’s history. “I’m never gonna hear the end of this from Miss Piggy,” Kermit the Frog joked in his unmasked interview.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Seth MacFarlane\n\nRobin’s final guess: Seth MacFarlane\n\nJenny’s first impression: Adam Carolla\n\nJenny’s final guess: Ted Cruz\n\nKen’s first impression: Jay Leno\n\nKen’s final guess: Jay Leno\n\nNicole’s first impression: Adam Carolla\n\nNicole’s final guess: Billy Crystal\n\nCaitlyn Jenner as Phoenix\n\nSeason 5, Episode 2\n\n“My kids have always known dad’s a little crazy,” said Caitlyn Jenner after being unmasked as the fiery bird. Both Ken Jeong and Jenny McCarthy picked the Olympic gold medalist and reality TV star as their first impression, but Ken chickened out at the last second and switched his final guess to RuPaul Charles, prompting Caitlyn to call him an “idiot.”\n\nRobin’s first impression: Laverne Cox\n\nRobin’s final guess: Laverne Cox\n\nJenny’s first impression: Caitlyn Jenner\n\nJenny’s final guess: Caitlyn Jenner\n\nKen’s first impression: Caitlyn Jenner\n\nKen’s final guess: RuPaul Charles\n\nNicole’s first impression: Perez Hilton\n\nNicole’s final guess: Jonathan Van Ness\n\nDanny Trejo as Raccoon\n\nSeason 5, Episode 3\n\nA true shocker, nobody could have predicted the famed Hollywood actor was masquerading as the garbage-eating Raccoon. In his exit interview, Danny Trejo singled out Jenny McCarthy for the work she does helping kids with autism. “I love the work that you do. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart,” he proclaimed.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Danny DeVito\n\nRobin’s final guess: Tony Danza\n\nJenny’s first impression: Dustin Hoffman\n\nJenny’s final guess: Gary Busey\n\nKen’s first impression: Mike Tyson\n\nKen’s final guess: Danny DeVito\n\nNicole’s first impression: Gary Busey\n\nNicole’s final guess: Sylvester Stallone\n\nLogan Paul as Grandpa Monster\n\nSeason 5, Episode 4\n\nNicole Scherzinger came close to guessing the identity of the orange, furry, bearded Grandpa Monster, by naming Jake Paul instead of his brother, Logan Paul. “You thought I was Jake?” asked the sad-faced internet personality. Hey, does that mean Nicole gets half a point?\n\nRobin’s first impression: Johnny Manziel\n\nRobin’s final guess: Johnny Manziel\n\nJenny’s first impression: Morgan Freeman\n\nJenny’s final guess: The Miz\n\nKen’s first impression: Emmitt Smith\n\nKen’s final guess: Kevin Hart\n\nNicole’s first impression: Cam Newton\n\nNicole’s final guess: Jake Paul\n\nNick Cannon as Bulldog\n\nSeason 5, Episode 5\n\nGuest host Niecy Nash surprised the panel when she announced the votes wouldn’t count and she’d be the sole person to eliminate one of the contestants. She then declared she was sending Bulldog to the dog pound. The gold-plated puppy removed his mask to reveal none other than the show’s original host Nick Cannon, who’d been out sick with Covid-19 for the first four episodes. None of the panelists made official guesses this week.\n\nRobin’s first impression: N/A\n\nRobin’s final guess: N/A\n\nJenny’s first impression: N/A\n\nJenny’s final guess: N/A\n\nKen’s first impression: N/A\n\nKen’s final guess: N/A\n\nNicole’s first impression: N/A\n\nNicole’s final guess: N/A\n\nMark McGrath as Orca\n\nSeason 5, Episode 6\n\nAs the first-ever wild card in “TMS” history, Mark McGrath will go down in the record books. However, not as the winner. The Sugar Ray frontman and TV host had the panel tearing up with his story about losing his father, though none of them correctly named him as the celeb hiding behind the Orca mask when he was later eliminated.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Billie Joe Armstrong\n\nRobin’s final guess: Billie Joe Armstrong\n\nJenny’s first impression: Dave Grohl\n\nJenny’s final guess: Kelly Slater\n\nKen’s first impression: Jon Bon Jovi\n\nKen’s final guess: Billie Joe Armstrong\n\nNicole’s first impression: Dave Grohl\n\nNicole’s final guess: Dave Grohl\n\nBobby Brown as Crab\n\nSeason 5, Episode 7\n\nDespite his iconic voice and stage persona, only half the panel was savvy enough to guess Bobby Brown was hiding inside the Crab costume. Both Ken Jeong and Jenny McCarthy added points to their Golden Ear tallies after correctly naming him as their first impressions.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Kool (Robert Bell)\n\nRobin’s final guess: Ray Parker Jr.\n\nJenny’s first impression: Bobby Brown\n\nJenny’s final guess: Bobby Brown\n\nKen’s first impression: Bobby Brown\n\nKen’s final guess: Bobby Brown\n\nNicole’s first impression: Jackson 5 member\n\nNicole’s final guess: Keith Sweat\n\nTamera Mowry-Housely as Seashell\n\nSeason 5, Episode 7\n\nThe former “Sister, Sister” star readily admitted she hasn’t sung on a big stage in 20 years, but you couldn’t tell it from the Seashell’s professional-sounding voice. Host Nick Cannon claimed he knew Tamera Mowry-Housely was masquerading in the ocean costume since they grew up together, but the only panelist who named her was Nicole Scherzinger.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Ashley Judd\n\nRobin’s final guess: Haylie Duff\n\nJenny’s first impression: Vanessa Hudgens\n\nJenny’s final guess: Vanessa Hudgens\n\nKen’s first impression: Kristin Chenowith\n\nKen’s final guess: Sarah Silverman\n\nNicole’s first impression: Hillary Duff\n\nNicole’s final guess: Tamera Mowry-Housely\n\nTyrese Gibson as Robopine\n\nSeason 5, Episode 8\n\n“When you have two daughters you look for those moments to sit in front of the TV and do something fun as a family,” the “Fast and Furious” franchise star told host Nick Cannon during his unmasked interview. “So here I am now with a Robopine outfit on!” Only Nicole Scherzinger correctly guessed Tyrese Gibson was hiding inside the porcupine costume.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Ginuwine\n\nRobin’s final guess: Terrence Howard\n\nJenny’s first impression: Jamie Foxx\n\nJenny’s final guess: Jamie Foxx\n\nKen’s first impression: Jamie Foxx\n\nKen’s final guess: Wesley Snipes\n\nNicole’s first impression: Jamie Foxx\n\nNicole’s final guess: Tyrese Gibson\n\nHanson as Russian Dolls\n\nSeason 5, Episode 9\n\nMMMBop! One of the most famous boy bands of the 1990s and 2000s, Hanson, competed together as the Russian Dolls. Midway through the competition, Nicole Scherzinger caught on to their true identities, not being swayed at all when a fake fourth doll appeared on stage.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Black Eyed Peas\n\nRobin’s final guess: Sugarland\n\nJenny’s first impression: Boyz II Men\n\nJenny’s final guess: Hanson\n\nKen’s first impression: Donnie & Marie Osmond\n\nKen’s final guess: Jonas Brothers\n\nNicole’s first impression: “Glee” Cast\n\nNicole’s final guess: Hanson\n\nDonnie Wahlberg as Cluedle-Doo\n\nSeason 5, Episode 10\n\nFor the first time ever, a costume was unmasked that wasn’t a contestant.

Only Jenny McCarthy was savvy enough to name the boy band singer as her first impression, winning her a second consecutive Golden Ear trophy. “This experience has [reminded] me how much I love singing, how much I love music,” the artist formerly known as Piglet said as the final credits rolled.\n\nRobin’s first impression: John Rzeznik\n\nRobin’s final guess: Nick Lachey\n\nJenny’s first impression: Nick Lachey\n\nJenny’s final guess: Nick Lachey\n\nKen’s first impression: Adam Lambert\n\nKen’s final guess: Jeremy Renner\n\nNicole’s first impression: Cody Simpson\n\nNicole’s final guess: Brian Littrell\n\nDwight Howard as Octopus\n\nSeason 6, Episode 1\n\n“It was hot in this suit!” Dwight Howard exclaimed to host Nick Cannon during his unmasked interview. “The mask weighed about 55 pounds.

Fox as Mother Nature\n\nSeason 6, Episode 1/2\n\nFor the first time ever, a contestant was eliminated in one episode but then unmasked in the next, resulting in a nail-biting cliffhanger.

Even though the judges had name-dropped Honey Boo Boo in the past, no one thought the reality TV star was hiding inside the enormous beach toy with her mother.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Kat Dennings & Beth Behrs\n\nRobin’s final guess: Kat Dennings & Beth Behrs\n\nJenny’s first impression: Kim Zolciak & Erika Jayne\n\nJenny’s final guess: Snooki & JWoww\n\nKen’s first impression: Kim & Khloe Kardashian\n\nKen’s final guess: Kim & Khloe Kardashian\n\nNicole’s first impression: Kristen Wiig & Annie Mumolo\n\nNicole’s final guess: Kristen Wiig & Annie Mumolo\n\nJohnny Rotten as Jester\n\nSeason 6, Episode 9\n\n“We’ve only got one life,” Johnny Rotten expressed during his unmasked interview with host Nick Cannon. “We must explore all the possibilities and be limited by no one for no reason.” The punk legend took a little time to explain all of the cake in one of his clue packages. “In Britain we were banned everywhere,” he admitted. “Couldn’t play! We managed to get this gig playing for orphans and they had cake and they smothered us in it. So children got us, but adults didn’t!”\n\nRobin’s first impression: Alice Cooper\n\nRobin’s final guess: Flea\n\nJenny’s first impression: Dee Snider\n\nJenny’s final guess: Dee Snider\n\nKen’s first impression: Roger Daltrey\n\nKen’s final guess: Roger Daltrey\n\nNicole’s first impression: Sammy Hagar\n\nNicole’s final guess: Gene Simmons\n\nNatasha Bedingfield as Pepper\n\nSeason 6, Episode 9\n\n“It’s fun to be spicy,” Natasha Bedingfield revealed during her unmasked interview with host Nick Cannon. “I just want people to feel something so I’m really trying to tell the story.” Throughout her clue packages, Pepper revealed that someone very close to her was going through a difficult time. “My son had brain surgery just before the pandemic,” Natasha explained.\n\nRobin’s first impression: Carly Rae Jepsen\n\nRobin’s final guess: Mandy Moore\n\nJenny’s first impression: Lana Del Rey\n\nJenny’s final guess: Dido\n\nKen’s first impression: Kesha\n\nKen’s final guess: Pink\n\nNicole’s first impression: Natasha Bedingfield\n\nNicole’s final guess: Natasha Bedingfield\n\nWillie Robertson as Mallard\n\nSeason 6, Episode 10\n\n“I felt comfortable being a mallard,” Willie Robertson admitted during his unmasked interview with host Nick Cannon. “When they said duck, I thought, yeah! It was just one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. The first night I thought, there is no way. Most of the people that you named, I’m friends with. So I was laughing a lot because I was like, ‘he’s gonna die when he finds out they thought I was him.’ I was so nervous being in front of you and this has just been a blast. This has been one of the funnest things I’ve ever done.”\n\nRobin’s first impression: Larry the Cable Guy\n\nRobin’s final guess: Alan Jackson\n\nJenny’s first impression: Toby Keith\n\nJenny’s final guess: Jason Aldean\n\nKen’s first impression: Billy Ray Cyrus\n\nKen’s final guess: Billy Ray Cyrus\n\nNicole’s first impression: Dierks Bentley\n\nNicole’s final guess: Dog the Bounty Hunter\n\nBobby Berk as Caterpillar\n\nSeason 6, Episode 10\n\n“I can go on tour with your husband,” Bobby Berk remarked to Jenny McCarthy after she gushed over the TV host’s voice during his unmasked interview with Nick Cannon. Bobby continued to address the panel, stating, “Thank you guys for being out there in the world and entertaining people. More than ever we need amazing people like you that make us smile. No matter how stupid some of the things you say are.”\n\nRobin’s first impression: Howie D.\n\nRobin’s final guess: AJ McLean\n\nJenny’s first impression: Brian Littrell\n\nJenny’s final guess: Owen Wilson\n\nKen’s first impression: Aaron Carter\n\nKen’s final guess: Dan Levy\n\nNicole’s first impression: Chris Brown\n\nNicole’s final guess: Tyler Hubbard\n\nFaith Evans as Skunk\n\nSeason 6, Episode 11\n\n“Thank you for the great compliments. You make a girl feel good!” Faith Evans told the panelists after unmasking as the smelly critter.

Her husband David Foster, aka the banana, added, “I don’t have the pleasure of knowing Ken, though I’m a huge fan. But the other three I know and so it was kind of thrilling to try and fool them. But we didn’t really fool them. Is that because we’re a duo or what?”\n\nRobin’s first impression: Jennifer Nettles & “that other guy”\n\nRobin’s final guess: Ryan Tedder & Leona Lewis\n\nJenny’s first impression: David Foster & Katherine McPhee\n\nJenny’s final guess: David Foster & Katherine McPhee\n\nKen’s first impression: David Foster & Katherine McPhee\n\nKen’s final guess: David Foster & Katherine McPhee\n\nNicole’s first impression: David Foster & Katherine McPhee\n\nNicole’s final guess: David Foster & Katherine McPhee\n\nTodrick Hall as Bull\n\nSeason 6 Finale (Runner-up)\n\n“We grow up and we believe in ourselves as little kids,” Todrick Hall expressed after he removed his Bull mask. “Somewhere along the line the world starts to pick apart at you and they start to make you realize the things about you that are different.

It’s the privilege of a lifetime to get to be yourself.

When this opportunity came up it was so perfect. I think what held me back is that everyone knew I was a comedian, so everyone was like, ‘Don’t sing, no one wants to hear that. It’s like Michael Jordan playing baseball. No one needs that from you. Do what you’re good at.’ This show really allowed me to forget all of the insecurities I had around singing and really explore my voice.”\n\nRobin’s final guess: Whitney Cummings\n\nJenny’s final guess: Nikki Glaser\n\nKen’s final guess: Kristen Wiig\n\nNicole’s final guess: Iliza Schlesinger\n\nWilson Phillips as Lamb\n\nSeason 8 Finale (Runner-up)\n\n“It’s a journey that we will never forget,” they told host Nick Cannon during their unmasked interview. “It’s been amazing.

I dance on TikTok. I have like over 10 million viewers who watch me dance. I said, ‘I must be amazing. I’m gonna compete.’” When asked what it’s like to be on the talent rather than the judge, Howie explained, “Everything is backwards here. I’m usually on the panel.

But I am just so proud of myself because I conquered my fear and y’all were so great. Everyone was so awesome. I deal with anxiety and this was something that I wanted to show.

Just bump it up a notch.” In closing, she told her fans, “Thank you so much for this opportunity. I really do feel like although I had a mask on, this is more of my personality that I got to share for the first time.
