        "text": "Sharon Elkin is a recurring character on The Fosters. She is the mother of Stef Adams Foster and the ex-wife of Frank Cooper, and has a husband, Will. Sharon was one of the people to help at Stef and Lena's wedding along with Lena's mother, Dana. She returned afterward to attend Frank's funeral. She makes her first appearance in I Do.\n\nSharon is portrayed by Annie Potts.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nSharon has short strawberry blonde hair with brown eyes. She is shorter than her ex-husband, Frank, her daughter, Stef, and her husband, Will. In the later seasons, she cuts her hair shorter and dyes it grey.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nDuring Stef and Lena's wedding, Sharon seems very impatient, but also is accepting and a bit jumpy at times. She also wants what's best for her and her family. She is accepting of her daughter's sexual orientation and is always supportive of her. Her progressive state of mind seems to change and evolve throughout the series, as she becomes more accepting of sexual orientations and abortions. When Sharon found about Emma's abortion her first instinct was to make sure the girl was okay. Despite this, Sharon can also be quite abrasive and talks about sexual notions around others, which don't seem to bother her. Sharon has a great sense of humor and is noted to be the comic relief in the episodes she's in.\n\nSeries[]\n\nAppearances (11/101)[]\n\nSeason 1 (3/21)\n\nI Do\n\nThe Honeymoon\n\nPadre\n\nSeason 2 (1/21)\n\nChristmas Past\n\nSeason 3 (4/20)\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nMixed Messages\n\nIf and When\n\nUnder Water\n\nSeason 4 (2/20)\n\nThe Long Haul\n\nUntil Tomorrow (voice only)\n\nSeason 5 (1/22)\n\nMother's Day\n\nTurks & Caicos (Mentioned)\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFrank Cooper[]\n\nFirst Relationship:\n\nStart Up: Prior to Pilot (1x01)\n\nBroke Up: Prior to Pilot (1x01)\n\nFrank is Sharon's ex-husband.
