Britney shared the news with fans on X, expressing her enthusiasm for the project.\n\nAlthough casting has not been revealed, people are already speculating on who could play the pop legend. Everyone is excited to learn more about this highly anticipated film. Here are the top ten actors that are most likely to play Britney Spears in her upcoming biopic:\n\n1. Millie Bobby Brown\n\nMillie Bobby Brown is a well-known name in the discussion regarding who would play Britney Spears in the planned biopic. The 20-year-old Stranger Things actress has openly expressed her desire to play the pop legend.

Although Brown does not know Spears directly, she has a unique grasp of her tale and believes she can honestly reflect it.\n\n2. Sydney Sweeney\n\nAlthough Sydney Sweeney, 26, lacks some of the musical taste of other potential actresses for the Britney Spears biopic, people are enthralled by both her acting abilities and her resemblance to the pop icon.\n\nMany believe Sweeney's portrayal of Spears' story, as described in The Woman in Me, might be more dramatic. Sweeney, most known for her role in Euphoria, has been in films such as Madame Web, Everyone But You, and Immaculate since she was a preteen. Her rising resume and uncanny similarity to Spears propel her to the forefront of casting arguments.\n\n3. Dove Cameron\n\nDove Cameron, a popular Disney Channel star, has been proposed by fans as a suitable contender to play Britney Spears owing to her expertise in acting, music, and dancing.\n\nCameron, 28, rose to prominence for her twin roles in Disney's Liv and Maddie. She has subsequently acted in series such as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., released music, including her 2022 song Boyfriend, and participated in musical theater plays such as Hairspray Live! and Clueless: The Musical.\n\n4. Florence Pugh\n\nThe 28-year-old Florence Pugh is an unexpected pick to play Britney Spears. Her portrayal in films such as Oppenheimer, Midsommar, Little Women, and Black Widow has won her admirers. In the 2023 movie A Good Person, Pugh also contributes vocals. Despite being an unexpected choice, her acting and singing abilities make her a viable contender.\n\n5. Sabrina Carpenter\n\nSabrina Carpenter, a 25-year-old actress and musician, immediately rose to the top of fans' Britney Army lists for the role of Britney Spears in a planned biopic.

The 26-year-old actress is well-known for her part in the Netflix series Outer Banks as Sarah Cameron. Her role as the hilarious influencer Whiskey in the Knives Out sequel, Glass Onion, also brought her recognition. Cline is a good contender for the biopic because of her performances in these parts, which showcase her attractiveness and range.\n\n7. Elle Fanning\n\nElle Fanning, known for her performances in Hulu's The Great, left a lasting impression on Halloween 2022 by appearing as Britney Spears. She wore Spears' classic 2001 MTV Video Music Awards outfit, which included a green bra, shorts, a cape, a headset microphone, and a prop snake hung around her neck.\n\nThis costume not only paid respect to Spears' iconic performance of I'm A Slave 4 U, but it also demonstrated Fanning's talent for combining her acting profession with imaginative, pop culture-inspired parodies.\n\n8. Grace Van Dien\n\nGrace Van Dien, 27, is another actress under consideration for the Britney Spears movie. Van Dien is known for her appearances in Stranger Things, the teen drama Greenhouse Academy, and Charlie Says, where she played Sharon Tate. She has also acted in the NBC series The Village.

Bella Thorne\n\nFans have argued that Bella Thorne may be a good fit to play Britney Spears, citing her blonde appearance and simple social media posts, which remind them of Spears' public attitude.
